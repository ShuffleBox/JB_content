00:00.000 --> 00:09.440
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, episode 260, recorded on September 28, 2022, from

00:09.440 --> 00:12.240
a very sunny Pasadena, California.

00:12.240 --> 00:13.240
I'm Chris.

00:13.240 --> 00:14.240
And I'm Wes.

00:14.240 --> 00:15.240
Hello, Wes.

00:15.240 --> 00:18.960
From the footsteps of JPL, let's do the news.

00:18.960 --> 00:23.600
This week, the GNU Toolchain infrastructure project was established.

00:23.600 --> 00:28.400
The project will take advantage of the Linux Foundation's Kernel Infrastructure team to

00:28.400 --> 00:31.000
provide hosting for the GNU tools.

00:31.000 --> 00:37.560
Yes, Carlos O'Donnell of Red Hat summed it up in a mailing list post, saying, quote,

00:37.560 --> 00:43.440
during the Sourceware Infrastructure BoF sessions at the GNU Cauldron, the GNU Toolchain community

00:43.440 --> 00:51.040
in collaboration with the Linux Foundation and OpenSSF announced the GNU Toolchain Infrastructure

00:51.040 --> 00:54.960
project, or what everybody likes to call GTI.

00:54.960 --> 01:00.560
He went on to say, quote, the collaboration includes a fund for infrastructure and software

01:00.560 --> 01:05.360
supply chain security, which will allow us to utilize the respected Linux Foundation

01:05.360 --> 01:11.520
IT services that currently host Kernel.org, and to fund other important projects.

01:11.520 --> 01:16.580
And to be fair, that does seem like the Kernel team is quite happy with the infrastructure

01:16.580 --> 01:19.800
that is provided for Kernel.org.

01:19.800 --> 01:25.760
To not understand this entire situation, you have to realize that for the past two decades,

01:25.760 --> 01:30.740
Red Hat has been sponsoring the hosting of the GCC compiler and the related GNU Toolchain

01:30.740 --> 01:33.600
infrastructure at Sourceware.org.

01:33.600 --> 01:38.580
Recently, an application was made to bring Sourceware under the umbrella of the Software

01:38.580 --> 01:42.940
Freedom Conservancy, at least for fundraising purposes.

01:42.940 --> 01:48.100
But it turns out there was a separate initiative developed in secret.

01:48.100 --> 01:53.960
This was all revealed after a rather intense discussion during a GNU Tools Cauldron session

01:53.960 --> 01:57.280
at the recent Linux Plumbers conference.

01:57.280 --> 02:02.020
Now nominally, the session was going to be about some new services that were being worked

02:02.020 --> 02:04.040
on for Sourceware.

02:04.040 --> 02:09.240
But the presenter, Sourceware overseer Mark Wheelard, did not end up getting very far

02:09.240 --> 02:14.880
into that presentation before being interrupted and reminded of an agreement, evidently made

02:14.880 --> 02:21.520
ahead of the session, that the real focus would be on the SFC proposal.

02:21.520 --> 02:24.800
At least according to Mark, representatives of the projects that are currently hosted

02:24.800 --> 02:28.940
on Sourceware, well they seem to like the SFC proposal.

02:28.940 --> 02:32.020
The Free Software Foundation does as well.

02:32.020 --> 02:36.280
Now we should note, there was some yelling from the audience at this point, and it seems

02:36.280 --> 02:40.480
to make it clear there is a little disagreement left on that point.

02:40.480 --> 02:41.480
This is all sounding bizarre.

02:41.480 --> 02:48.920
I mean, it's a technical session with shouting from the audience and secret plans being announced.

02:48.920 --> 02:49.920
It's very odd.

02:49.920 --> 02:53.720
And at this point, O'Donnell finally revealed the secret alternative plan to the rest of

02:53.720 --> 02:57.860
the group, stressing these challenges that were coming for the toolchain community.

02:57.860 --> 03:01.800
They're going to require resources beyond what the Software Freedom Conservancy, or

03:01.800 --> 03:04.400
the SFC, could provide.

03:04.400 --> 03:09.800
Specifically, he talked about cybersecurity requirements that could lead to the exclusion

03:09.800 --> 03:15.600
of GNU tools from important projects, at least if its development systems are not seen as

03:15.600 --> 03:19.600
being managed in a sufficiently secure manner.

03:19.600 --> 03:24.280
Details on exactly what those requirements might be, or how they could be met, were not

03:24.280 --> 03:25.800
provided at the time.

03:25.800 --> 03:30.840
Though O'Donnell did note that the toolchain development model seems to function a lot

03:30.840 --> 03:35.280
like the Linux Kernels model, so there really could be some value in taking advantage of

03:35.280 --> 03:39.920
the infrastructure that the Linux Foundation has already set up to support the kernel.

03:39.920 --> 03:41.520
Yeah, no doubt.

03:41.520 --> 03:45.480
And I think it's important to note at this stage that these changes do not alter the

03:45.480 --> 03:49.560
governance or leadership structure of the GNU projects.

03:49.560 --> 03:51.440
This isn't about governance at all.

03:51.440 --> 03:56.740
It's really about infrastructure and just offloading the work of managing that infrastructure

03:56.740 --> 03:58.280
to someone else.

03:58.280 --> 04:04.240
Yeah, and on that point, I mean, from the busy developer perspective, I can definitely

04:04.240 --> 04:06.080
see the appeal.

04:06.080 --> 04:12.080
The problem seems to be the way that GTI was developed, somewhat in secret, and then is

04:12.080 --> 04:15.360
just surprisingly revealed.

04:15.360 --> 04:19.840
Really does seem to have caused some considerable consternation, at least in some elements of

04:19.840 --> 04:21.720
the toolchain community.

04:21.720 --> 04:26.440
So you know, regardless of whatever burdens that might be alleviated, however much easier

04:26.440 --> 04:32.660
you make it for them, I'm not sure everyone is able to forget the origin of the proposal

04:32.660 --> 04:34.540
so easily.

04:34.540 --> 04:39.000
And it's just once again, one of those things that involves the Linux Foundation that has

04:39.000 --> 04:40.000
some good.

04:40.000 --> 04:44.300
Obviously, that kernel.org infrastructure has been a good thing for Linux, that management

04:44.300 --> 04:46.820
has been solid.

04:46.820 --> 04:51.560
But the way it's gone about with these secret plans and how seemingly most of the project

04:51.560 --> 04:56.680
was on board with going with the conservancy, and then this big change, it all seems a little

04:56.680 --> 04:57.680
unsettling, doesn't it?

04:57.680 --> 05:01.820
And I thought Jonathan Colbert from LWN really nailed it when he wrote, quote, the secretive

05:01.820 --> 05:07.380
way this project has been handled is a poor example of how to deal with a community.

05:07.380 --> 05:12.960
Regardless of what reality may be, GTI looks to a number of people involved like a murky,

05:12.960 --> 05:22.160
hostile takeover of an important piece of community infrastructure.

05:22.160 --> 05:27.900
It's been quite a while since we last checked in on a mobile Linux effort.

05:27.900 --> 05:32.940
So we wanted to catch you up on some work from July through September for Plasma Mobile

05:32.940 --> 05:34.560
Gear.

05:34.560 --> 05:40.100
Some of these updates are pretty major, and others are just nice to see, like the addition

05:40.100 --> 05:46.480
of a clear all notifications button and a do not disturb quick setting.

05:46.480 --> 05:48.720
I consider that a pretty major feature right there.

05:48.720 --> 05:51.760
It was great to just see all this work come together.

05:51.760 --> 05:56.820
There was work that went into making it possible as well to install Plasma Mobile alongside

05:56.820 --> 06:02.360
Plasma desktop and streamline some of the configurations between them as well.

06:02.360 --> 06:06.120
That's going to be absolutely essential for developers that are building apps for this.

06:06.120 --> 06:09.060
Also great to see some good stuff for podcast listeners.

06:09.060 --> 06:12.980
The interface in the podcast app has gotten some nice improvements, including the way

06:12.980 --> 06:17.140
the episode pages list and the information within is listed.

06:17.140 --> 06:22.000
Some reworking there that helps with sleep timer functionality, but here's a good one.

06:22.000 --> 06:26.900
They've added the possibility to push all local episode states to a G Potter sync server.

06:26.900 --> 06:32.660
So you can sync the state of your pods across your multiple Plasma Mobile devices.

06:32.660 --> 06:38.740
Of course, any mobile operating system needs support for phone calls, and this time around

06:38.740 --> 06:44.060
Plasma Mobile Gear definitely got some improvements there, including improved support for screening

06:44.060 --> 06:50.380
incoming calls and some lock screen overlay support for that call screening, plus more

06:50.380 --> 06:55.160
reliable behavior when you're accepting calls showing notifications about calls and importantly

06:55.160 --> 06:58.860
switching call audio modes automatically.

06:58.860 --> 07:03.260
They've also introduced a new swipe control to easily answer calls.

07:03.260 --> 07:04.720
That all seems like pretty good stuff.

07:04.720 --> 07:06.520
But catch this one there Westpain.

07:06.520 --> 07:11.280
They've also introduced some really clever support for call blocking of unknown numbers.

07:11.280 --> 07:16.400
And it makes it possible to change the notification logic according to the address book, or if

07:16.400 --> 07:18.820
a number matches a certain pattern.

07:18.820 --> 07:21.180
I'd like to have that on my commercial phone right now.

07:21.180 --> 07:23.540
Just mark everything as spam.

07:23.540 --> 07:27.020
I mean, sure, this isn't going to replace your daily driver just yet.

07:27.020 --> 07:34.860
But thank goodness a team of people are working away at this.

07:34.860 --> 07:40.820
Solid progress to report for the Asahi Rust based direct rendering manager video driver

07:40.820 --> 07:44.940
for Linux on that shiny Apple M hardware.

07:44.940 --> 07:51.740
Finally that driver successfully managed to render its very first cube.

07:51.740 --> 07:54.060
This is a milestone.

07:54.060 --> 07:58.620
They reached it this past week and Asahi Lina has been working on bringing up this new driver

07:58.620 --> 08:03.420
and just recently managed to also get the display working over the HDMI port with the

08:03.420 --> 08:05.220
driver as well.

08:05.220 --> 08:11.420
And to make things even more exciting, it appears Wayland support is well underway.

08:11.420 --> 08:17.340
Tweeting early on the 28th of September, Asahi Lina says KDE isn't starting all the way up

08:17.340 --> 08:21.020
just yet, but Wayland, quote, works.

08:21.020 --> 08:26.460
Hey, I have that problem on my x86 system sometimes, so not so bad.

08:26.460 --> 08:29.660
Let's be real though, it's going to be months.

08:29.660 --> 08:33.420
And then it's going to be even more time until it's in the hands of end users.

08:33.420 --> 08:38.340
And that's all to say nothing about the fact that Rust support hasn't even landed in the

08:38.340 --> 08:50.100
Linux kernel yet, but it will be landing soon, and we'll have more on that in the near future.

08:50.100 --> 08:55.140
An important security item for our friends in the Matrix Fediverse this week.

08:55.140 --> 09:00.700
Two critical vulnerabilities in end-to-end encryption were found in some of the SDKs

09:00.700 --> 09:05.340
which power Element and many other popular clients.

09:05.340 --> 09:09.780
These have now been fixed, and thankfully the Matrix team have not seen any evidence

09:09.780 --> 09:13.360
of these exploits being used in the wild.

09:13.360 --> 09:17.740
To make it even a little better, all the critical vulnerabilities actually require cooperation

09:17.740 --> 09:20.940
from a malicious home server in order to be exploited.

09:20.940 --> 09:26.580
We should also note that this is not a bug in the protocol, just a bug in some of the

09:26.580 --> 09:29.940
SDKs used by a lot of clients.

09:29.940 --> 09:36.220
Because of that, not all clients are affected, so go check with yours, but the Matrix team

09:36.220 --> 09:41.660
have used this as an opportunity to underscore their ongoing efforts to replace some of these

09:41.660 --> 09:49.860
first-generation SDKs with a new, clean, carefully written Rust implementation, complete with

09:49.860 --> 09:52.700
an independent public audit.

09:52.700 --> 09:57.740
But until that glorious future comes, patched clients are available now.

09:57.740 --> 10:03.300
Go get those package updates.

10:03.300 --> 10:05.500
Linode.com slash LAN.

10:05.500 --> 10:08.920
You go there to get $100 in 60-day credit on a new account, and what a great way to

10:08.920 --> 10:10.140
support the show, right?

10:10.140 --> 10:13.180
Because you're letting them know you heard about it here, but you also get to check out

10:13.180 --> 10:14.180
something awesome.

10:14.180 --> 10:17.580
And $100, well that's real money that you can do something with.

10:17.580 --> 10:19.780
Linode is fast, reliable cloud hosting.

10:19.780 --> 10:22.580
I think they're the best in the business, and they have the best support in the business.

10:22.580 --> 10:27.460
Real humans, all day, every day, and really nobody else has architected their business

10:27.460 --> 10:29.700
the way Linode has to make that possible.

10:29.700 --> 10:33.500
And Linode's how we run everything we've built in the last few years in the cloud, including

10:33.500 --> 10:39.260
that new website of ours, if you haven't checked it out yet, that renders, builds, and is deployed

10:39.260 --> 10:40.260
on Linode.

10:40.260 --> 10:45.580
You know, they started about 19 years ago, and they've just built a great product.

10:45.580 --> 10:50.580
And now they've got a great reputation, and they're 30 to 50% cheaper than the hyperscalers

10:50.580 --> 10:51.580
out there.

10:51.580 --> 10:53.780
But that doesn't mean you skimp on the features.

10:53.780 --> 10:57.860
Linode today has 11 data centers around the world for you to choose from.

10:57.860 --> 11:02.100
But my friends, they are turning it up past 11 in 2023.

11:02.100 --> 11:08.320
They are going to introduce 12 new data centers around the world.

11:08.320 --> 11:11.700
And I'm happy as a West Coaster, I'm happy to say that Seattle is going to have one of

11:11.700 --> 11:14.080
these data centers.

11:14.080 --> 11:15.780
But they're literally all over the world.

11:15.780 --> 11:22.160
Many places from Amsterdam, Stockholm, I mean, Paris, just tons of places, Rome, it's going

11:22.160 --> 11:23.400
to be a dozen.

11:23.400 --> 11:27.180
And then they're also working on a brand new concept called distributed sites, where they've

11:27.180 --> 11:31.260
identified 50 additional cities, where they're going to introduce a new concept where you

11:31.260 --> 11:35.740
can get basic computes in difficult to reach locations.

11:35.740 --> 11:39.460
Linode is always investing in making the service and the product better, the hardware, the

11:39.460 --> 11:41.460
support, and the reach.

11:41.460 --> 11:46.980
And on top of that, they have great back end features, like S3 compatible object storage,

11:46.980 --> 11:53.060
cloud firewall, great backups, Kubernetes support, super fast networking, and so much

11:53.060 --> 11:54.060
more.

11:54.060 --> 11:58.780
So go build something, go learn something, try it out for yourself, and support the show.

11:58.780 --> 12:03.500
You just go to linode.com slash LAN to get that $100 in 60 day credit, kick the tires

12:03.500 --> 12:04.500
for yourself.

12:04.500 --> 12:12.660
One more time to support the show, linode.com slash LAN.

12:12.660 --> 12:15.580
collide.com slash LAN.

12:15.580 --> 12:22.060
Collide is endpoint security that uses the most powerful untapped resource in IT, the

12:22.060 --> 12:23.060
end users.

12:23.060 --> 12:24.060
Yes, that's right.

12:24.060 --> 12:27.180
If you're trying to achieve security goals for yourself, for a third party auditor, for

12:27.180 --> 12:32.880
the new boss, I've had to do it for the FDA, for the FCC, for the FBI, okay, maybe not

12:32.880 --> 12:33.880
the FBI.

12:33.880 --> 12:35.060
But you get the idea.

12:35.060 --> 12:39.420
The conventional wisdom has been to treat every device like it's Fort Knox, go all in

12:39.420 --> 12:44.900
on security with old device management stuff like MDMs that force disruptive agents onto

12:44.900 --> 12:50.400
employees devices, slow them down, and treat privacy as an afterthought.

12:50.400 --> 12:55.940
To say it politely, not to mention, they'll often introduce their own security vulnerabilities.

12:55.940 --> 12:59.340
Like how many times have we seen that every single time?

12:59.340 --> 13:01.860
It's just a tired old way of doing things.

13:01.860 --> 13:07.180
And I can tell you from personal experience, it turns IT admins and end users into enemies.

13:07.180 --> 13:13.000
It creates security problems, users don't like it, IT staff always look at it as a compromise,

13:13.000 --> 13:16.000
and eventually creates a culture of shadow IT.

13:16.000 --> 13:17.500
It's awful.

13:17.500 --> 13:22.340
Kalyde does things differently, instead of forcing changes on its users, Kalyde sends

13:22.340 --> 13:26.900
them security recommendations via slack, Kalyde will automatically notify your team when their

13:26.900 --> 13:32.020
devices are insecure and give them step by step instructions on how to solve the problem.

13:32.020 --> 13:35.980
And by reaching out to employees via a friendly slack DM and educating them about company

13:35.980 --> 13:42.780
policies, Kalyde can help you build a culture in which everyone contributes to security

13:42.780 --> 13:47.060
because everyone understands how and why to do it.

13:47.060 --> 13:51.220
Even for IT admins, Kalyde provides a single dashboard that lets you monitor the security

13:51.220 --> 13:54.080
of your entire fleet.

13:54.080 --> 13:59.160
Even if they're on a Mac, Windows, or of course Linux, you can see at a glance which

13:59.160 --> 14:04.540
employees have their disks encrypted, their OS up to date, and a password manager installed.

14:04.540 --> 14:09.220
Make it easy to prove compliance to yourself, your auditors, your customers, leadership,

14:09.220 --> 14:10.780
you get the idea.

14:10.780 --> 14:16.700
That's Kalyde, user-centered cross-platform endpoint security for teams that slack.

14:16.700 --> 14:19.820
You can meet your compliance goals by putting users first.

14:19.820 --> 14:23.260
Visit Kalyde.com slash LAN to find out how.

14:23.260 --> 14:25.780
You go there, they're going to hook you up with a goody bag, including a free t-shirt

14:25.780 --> 14:27.420
just for trying out a free trial.

14:27.420 --> 14:30.060

14:41.620 --> 14:47.780
We're visiting NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory this week to celebrate the incredible achievements

14:47.780 --> 14:51.180
of Linux in modern space exploration.

14:51.180 --> 14:58.840
So it's rather fitting the Linux powered Mars helicopter Ingenuity completed its 33rd flight

14:58.840 --> 15:00.560
this week.

15:00.560 --> 15:01.560
That's just amazing.

15:01.560 --> 15:05.440
And currently it's around 96 million miles away from where we sit right now.

15:05.440 --> 15:12.580
The little Linux copter originally only had five flights planned.

15:12.580 --> 15:14.940
So the fact that hit 33 is just incredible.

15:14.940 --> 15:18.220
At the time when they launched this thing, expectations were low.

15:18.220 --> 15:20.140
I mean, keep in mind there's Mars itself.

15:20.140 --> 15:22.420
It only has three eighths Earth's gravity.

15:22.420 --> 15:30.540
It also has a much thinner atmosphere, 1.5% of Earth's atmospheric density, 1.5%.

15:30.540 --> 15:32.220
Imagine flying in that.

15:32.220 --> 15:37.260
And then to make matters worse, Mars only has 43% of the solar radiance.

15:37.260 --> 15:39.580
So charging batteries is tricky.

15:39.580 --> 15:43.300
And there's just a bunch of other variables on another planet where we've never flown

15:43.300 --> 15:46.360
before that made this a big unknown.

15:46.360 --> 15:51.380
So things started humbly with a little Linux copter, simple, basic, essential tests were

15:51.380 --> 15:56.380
done one bit at a time during one of the high speed spin tests back in early April.

15:56.380 --> 15:57.380
In fact, there was a problem.

15:57.380 --> 15:59.020
They had to shut it down.

15:59.020 --> 16:02.340
There was a watchdog service because, of course, this thing's running Linux and they got watch

16:02.340 --> 16:03.880
guard services on there.

16:03.880 --> 16:08.740
And it noticed there was too long of a delay between the transition between the pre flight

16:08.740 --> 16:10.260
and the flight system.

16:10.260 --> 16:12.740
So it called foul and shut everything down.

16:12.740 --> 16:19.020
But the team was capable of fixing that from Earth with a very remote software update.

16:19.020 --> 16:23.380
After that really seems like things have been mainly for the most part by the numbers with

16:23.380 --> 16:27.420
these flights, with the team pushing things a bit further and getting more data and cool

16:27.420 --> 16:29.660
pictures every single time.

16:29.660 --> 16:35.740
But in the last few months, there's been concern because Mars is in the middle of winter and

16:35.740 --> 16:38.100
it gets real cold on Mars.

16:38.100 --> 16:40.060
Yes, it does.

16:40.060 --> 16:48.400
Overnight temperatures can get as low as negative 124 degrees Fahrenheit, negative 86 Celsius.

16:48.400 --> 16:54.580
Winter on Mars also means even less of that limited solar energy you mentioned hitting

16:54.580 --> 16:56.940
those cute little solar panels.

16:56.940 --> 17:01.300
And that makes it difficult to maintain charge in the batteries.

17:01.300 --> 17:06.620
Though good news during the day, the panel creates just enough energy to make short hops

17:06.620 --> 17:07.620
possible.

17:07.620 --> 17:15.780
And that's how 33 flights later now, amazingly, Linux's role in the future of space exploration

17:15.780 --> 17:19.580
is pretty much guaranteed.

17:19.580 --> 17:25.700
And this week, JPL's expertise was on call once again for the asteroid striking DART

17:25.700 --> 17:26.700
mission.

17:26.700 --> 17:27.700
Wow.

17:27.700 --> 17:28.700
Yeah.

17:28.700 --> 17:29.700
Oh, my goodness.

17:29.700 --> 17:30.700
Yeah.

17:30.700 --> 17:31.700
Seven.

17:31.700 --> 17:32.700
Six.

17:32.700 --> 17:33.700
Wow.

17:33.700 --> 17:34.700
Four.

17:34.700 --> 17:35.700
Three.

17:35.700 --> 17:36.700
Two.

17:36.700 --> 17:37.700
One.

17:37.700 --> 17:38.700
Oh, my gosh.

17:38.700 --> 17:39.700
Oh, wow.

17:39.700 --> 17:40.700
Visual confirmation.

17:40.700 --> 17:41.700
All right.

17:41.700 --> 17:42.700
We got it.

17:42.700 --> 18:03.700
And we have impact, a challenge for humanity in the name of planetary defense.

18:03.700 --> 18:05.900
Fantastic.

18:05.900 --> 18:08.140
Planetary defense indeed.

18:08.140 --> 18:14.900
DART stands for Double Asteroid Redirection Test, and, well, it seeks to develop a method

18:14.900 --> 18:20.380
to protect our beloved Earth in case of a future asteroid impact threat.

18:20.380 --> 18:22.260
How does it do it?

18:22.260 --> 18:29.460
Well, actually pretty simply, just by shifting the asteroid's orbit through kinetic impact.

18:29.460 --> 18:38.100
Launched back in November 2021, DART is approximately 600 kilograms, and it had to fly 6.8 million

18:38.100 --> 18:47.180
miles away all to slam into the asteroid Dimorphos, which is just 160 meters across.

18:47.180 --> 18:53.140
It's a difficult job, said JPL's Julie Belrose, who leads the DART spacecraft navigation team.

18:53.140 --> 18:57.020
She went on to say, quote, it's a big part of what the navigation team is working on.

18:57.020 --> 19:03.260
It's getting DART to a 15 kilometer wide box in space 24 hours before impact.

19:03.260 --> 19:08.460
At that point, the mission's final trajectory correction maneuver, aka the firing of thrusters

19:08.460 --> 19:13.100
to modify the direction of flight, that'll be executed by mission controllers back here

19:13.100 --> 19:15.140
on Earth.

19:15.140 --> 19:19.540
But from then on, it was all up to DART.

19:19.540 --> 19:22.260
Yeah, the thing flew itself right into the rock.

19:22.260 --> 19:26.420
The autonomous navigation system is fascinating, and it's a particular area of interest for

19:26.420 --> 19:29.900
Wes and I that we hope to get a little more information about when we visit JPL in the

19:29.900 --> 19:30.900
next day.

19:30.900 --> 19:36.740
But watching Linux become the dominant operating system of space, it's just been fascinating

19:36.740 --> 19:39.100
and so encouraging to watch.

19:39.100 --> 19:42.540
We're going to keep an eye on this and everything else going on in the world of Linux and all

19:42.540 --> 19:43.540
open source.
