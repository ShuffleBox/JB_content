00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,240
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, episode 178, recorded on February 28, 2021. I'm Chris.

2
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:11,240
And I'm Wes.

3
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:13,200
Hello, Wes. Let's do the news.

4
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:18,520
This week, Red Hat announced yet another way to get no-cost access to Red Hat Enterprise

5
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:22,040
Linux, but it's only for those who qualify.

6
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:27,260
No, you're not experiencing dÃ©jÃ  vu. This is an additional program from the one they

7
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:32,640
expanded in January, where they brought the production count up to 16 for developers.

8
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:38,600
This is seemingly perhaps an olive branch to people who use RHEL in production of open

9
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:42,940
source software or for infrastructure that supports open source software. But there's

10
00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:46,040
a couple of hoops you got to jump through to qualify.

11
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:51,520
Hoop number one is you have to email Red Hat to be approved. You've got to actually tell

12
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:55,280
them you're interested in this program and then, in theory, go through the process, sign

13
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:59,320
up, make an account until you get access to all those goodies.

14
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:04,560
I think Red Hat's Jason Brooks made their intention clear with this quote.

15
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:09,700
We want to make sure that those organizations engaged with open source have access to RHEL

16
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:13,680
as they build and test the future of open source software.

17
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:18,500
And I think this point is kind of important. To me, it kind of sounds like you have to

18
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:25,800
email them and kind of ask and justify why you should deserve access to this. And then

19
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:29,400
they will review it and then decide if you qualify.

20
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:32,840
They do say who gets it when they're kind of talking, trying to set expectations on

21
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:37,940
their site. They say the program is available exclusively to open source projects and other

22
00:01:37,940 --> 00:01:43,420
organizations that support the production of open source software. They go on to say

23
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:49,440
generally all software distributed under a Fedora approved license is considered open

24
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:56,300
source for the purpose of this program. Projects sponsored by for-profit companies can also

25
00:01:56,300 --> 00:02:01,900
be eligible for RHEL for open source infrastructure subscriptions with the caveat that subscriptions

26
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:06,800
obtained through the program must be used solely for independent project infrastructure.

27
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:10,980
So there's a couple of gotchas in there and I have a few additional questions on top of

28
00:02:10,980 --> 00:02:16,940
that, Wes. Like what happens if my company is sponsoring open source software today and

29
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:22,560
we develop open source software for a couple of years and then we stop? Maybe the developers

30
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:27,900
leave or the project's over. Do we then have to email Red Hat and get a quote to pay for

31
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:32,360
our licenses? Do we get to keep those licenses that were issued to us even though we no longer

32
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:37,300
support open source software? And how do I format this email when I write in asking,

33
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:40,860
please, sir, can I have some free Linux? How do I format that email?

34
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:44,420
You can tell there are definitely going to be those questions. They even note way down

35
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:48,820
at the bottom of their blog post, we realize this program doesn't cover situations where

36
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:54,480
open source projects are using public CI infrastructure provided by third parties. This and other

37
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:59,500
programs are still being worked on. That's a pretty big hole here.

38
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:03,820
Yeah, it is. That hole is big enough that it's an entire market or two of users. And

39
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:08,920
then you combine the hassle of having to email in and beg for your Linux. I think this is

40
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:15,900
enough of a barrier that people will just use Rocky Linux or they'll use cloud Linux.

41
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:19,460
They're not going to bother with these games because if you're thinking about it, you're

42
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:23,980
spending up some VMs for some infrastructure. Are you really going to mess with this sort

43
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:31,220
of loan to you Linux where it's sort of vague and not really clear what happens down the

44
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:32,220
road long term?

45
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:34,960
And yes, you get access to things like the forums, but you don't actually get support

46
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:39,380
with this. It's self-serve support. Well, I can get that with every other Linux distribution

47
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:40,380
as well.

48
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:46,060
Well, they did sort of dangle support for some organizations. We may also be able to

49
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:51,580
offer no cost support depending on the scope and nature of the organization, which that's

50
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:57,100
kind of just more questions to my mind. This might be useful for people and organizations

51
00:03:57,100 --> 00:04:01,900
and projects that are in the Red Hat ecosystem pretty closely already. They had a quote from

52
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:06,300
folks at GNOME who appreciate having this access. And maybe if you're already administrating

53
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:09,440
a lot of Red Hat boxes, you're using those tools all the time. And now you can just do

54
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:13,860
that for the open source you're involved with. Okay. I mean, that's probably a good thing,

55
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:19,200
but I agree with you. The value proposition, if you don't need, you're not insistent on

56
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:22,660
having access to real RHEL, I'm not sure I get it.

57
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:26,900
I think your point's well taken that if you're producing software that's going to run on

58
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:30,500
RHEL, that's just made your life easier. And that's totally worth acknowledging. And it

59
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:34,420
is good to see because this is going to cover those areas a little bit more completely where

60
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:39,700
the developer program didn't really make sense. And so I do want to commend them for that

61
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:43,700
because my criticism of the developer program was it meant a lot of use cases were going

62
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:49,300
to kind of be shoehorned as a developer, like infrastructure. But now this is going to make

63
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:54,420
that a little more clear. But they also say this isn't going to work for a large list

64
00:04:54,420 --> 00:05:00,140
of organizational types, academic institutions. This doesn't really solve their problem. Healthcare

65
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:06,520
organizations does not solve their problem. There's a lot of categories of firms like

66
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:11,540
that that are not going to qualify for this. And I think Red Hat's answer there is pretty

67
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:17,340
clear. You should just buy commercial RHEL. You have a use case for commercial RHEL in

68
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:21,340
those cases. And I don't know if I completely agree, at least in the academic sense. What

69
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:22,340
is your thought?

70
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:27,860
Well, yeah. So they do say Red Hat is continuing to explore new programs for traditional nonprofits

71
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:32,700
and academic institutions and government entities. So I think they acknowledge that maybe in

72
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:36,820
some of those cases it might make sense. You know, there's a lot of folks who are on CentOS

73
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:41,500
or people involved with scientific Linux perhaps for a while that are already in that ecosystem

74
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:45,460
probably could use some free RHEL to support scientific research, say.

75
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:49,700
Yeah. You know, actually, it's funny you mentioned scientific Linux. There are signs of life

76
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:55,140
again with that project post CentOS news. And that's interesting to develop. And it

77
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:58,500
is good that they kind of acknowledge that government was one that I didn't mention.

78
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:03,940
And it's clearly a huge one for them. Government and academic could use a solution here. And

79
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:10,460
I think then it would be a little more complete. But they're going to need support packages.

80
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:11,460
It's going to be tricky.

81
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:15,580
I think it's hard to blur that line of which organizations do or don't. I think that's

82
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:20,980
part of the reason they're trying to set some clear or not so clear guidance from the start

83
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:22,240
with this new program.

84
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:26,820
It does make a little more sense than the developer program. I'll give them that. And

85
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:30,860
this is it's almost cliche to say at this point, but it is the elephant in the room.

86
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:36,100
So I'm going to just say it. This totally should have been flushed out before the CentOS

87
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:41,860
announcement. I grok that the intention was to get the news out to CentOS users as fast

88
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:46,980
as possible so they could start planning. And that is an honorable intention. But man

89
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:51,140
oh man, if the left and the right hand couldn't have worked a little bit more together on

90
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:55,340
this one to kind of package this up. Imagine this now in its full context. You've got the

91
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:59,700
expanded 16 production system developer program. You've got this where it's not really limited

92
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:04,540
to any amount of systems. It's more about the type of industry or job function and type

93
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:09,300
of system. Yeah. But it's opened up to a lot more people. Yeah. Now then you also still

94
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:13,900
have CentOS stream, right? It's not like CentOS is gone. And so if the announcement was, hey,

95
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:18,180
you've got all these ways where you can actually just run RHEL how you used to run CentOS.

96
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:23,740
And by the way, CentOS is transitioning in a year. Plus that would have been a totally

97
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:29,440
different story than CentOS is going away as you love it. And then months of really

98
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:35,460
nothing while projects sprung up to replace what they took away before the complete picture

99
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:39,940
was out in the public. Meanwhile, behind the scenes, all knowing that this was going to

100
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:44,940
happen, the Red Hat staff knew this was the direction they were going in with these RHEL

101
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:50,300
programs, but just simply failed to execute in a way that communicated it properly. And

102
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:56,060
instead they just took one on the chin and lost reputation and lost the faith of the

103
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:59,860
open source community. Yeah. You know, here they even explicitly say that this is something

104
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:05,860
they are, they were already doing with organizations. They knew they needed to clean this up. Yeah.

105
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:10,980
But it's here now. And by the end of 2021, once CentOS has gone to stream, it's, there's

106
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:14,900
going to be a clear delineations now. It's still kind of fuzzy between all of them. Well,

107
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:20,420
you know, Alma Linux just put out an RC1. Tracking the CentOS clones as they land here

108
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:27,340
on the show. Well, while we're talking about Red Hat, OpenShift 4.7 landed this week. And

109
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:31,620
the notable thing here really is Red Hat is attempting to simplify the migration of virtual

110
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:38,100
machines to containers and also just migrating from your maybe quote unquote legacy VM stack

111
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:43,300
into OpenShift. Well, those virtual machines, they might not even be running Linux because

112
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:47,660
according to Red Hat's Peter Lauterbach, the OpenShift team has been working closely with

113
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:54,660
Microsoft on this one too. One other thing I want to talk about is that we've done virtualization

114
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:59,940
validation with Microsoft. This has actually been the case since we actually GA'd the product

115
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:06,540
several releases ago. So anything that's supported from Windows 2012 R2 onwards all the way up

116
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:13,820
to Windows 10 is a supported validated configuration, not only from Red Hat, but from Microsoft

117
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:14,820
as well.

118
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:19,820
I'll take anything that makes managing Windows a little easier.

119
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:23,740
Leno dot com slash land. Go there to get a one hundred dollars 60 day credit towards

120
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:29,620
a new account. Yeah, I said one hundred dollars. I know it's great. Leno provides virtual servers

121
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:34,660
to make it easy and affordable to host anything you want in the cloud. We use them for all

122
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:40,020
of the new infrastructure as JB 3.0. I started a couple of years ago personally using them.

123
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:44,340
And then when the opportunity to go independent came and I knew I'd need a whole new generation

124
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:49,780
of infrastructure, Leno was the obvious choice. 30 to 50 percent cheaper than places like

125
00:09:49,780 --> 00:09:55,280
AWS or Google. But they've been around since 2003. So they've honed this machine. They

126
00:09:55,280 --> 00:10:01,140
know what they're doing. SSD storage, 40 gigabit connections, a super easy to use UI to manage

127
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:04,780
everything. Wes and I were messing with things over the weekend and I knew Wes was up to

128
00:10:04,780 --> 00:10:08,020
something because I started seeing the emails come in with some of their built in monitoring

129
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:12,500
tools. You get alerts when certain events happen, which is always a great way to kind

130
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:16,340
of get an indication that something's going on on your box. But of course, it was just

131
00:10:16,340 --> 00:10:21,100
Wes being awesome. But, you know, I was thinking we talk a lot about how we use it for hosting.

132
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:25,700
But something I don't mention a lot is it's a great way to learn. And with our one hundred

133
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:31,420
dollar credit, when you go to Leno.com slash LAN, you can build a configuration of performance

134
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:36,500
and distribution and server location that's perfect for you. So you get great performance

135
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:41,060
and a platform to learn on. Think about maybe cybersecurity. This is something you could

136
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:46,200
really, really use hands on experience with. And not everyone has a dozen different rigs

137
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:49,900
of different compute power and software stacks that they can mess around with. But with our

138
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:53,780
one hundred dollar credit, you could really get a lot of runway there and learn something

139
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:59,060
fundamental about cybersecurity. There's so many great opportunities to learn there.

140
00:10:59,060 --> 00:11:03,140
But perhaps, perhaps it's worth seeing if you could extend your existing infrastructure

141
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:07,540
with Linode. Maybe cloud monitoring that you roll yourself with something like Zabbix.

142
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:13,280
They have a one click app deployment for enterprise class open source monitoring. Zabbix is an

143
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:18,500
all in one monitoring solution that you can deploy on Linode and then monitor your systems

144
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:23,980
from the cloud. Try it out with our one hundred dollar credit and see how far you can get.

145
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:28,260
Leno.com slash LAN. Go there, support the show and get that one hundred dollar credit.

146
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:33,380
And a big thank you to Leno for sponsoring independent content like this here show. Leno.com

147
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:35,900
slash LAN.

148
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:41,180
Well I know you don't need yet another laptop, Chris. But what if I told you about a new

149
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:48,060
modular repairable laptop that doesn't look too bad either? This week, the framework team

150
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:53,780
unveiled their first product, the framework laptop, a thin, lightweight, high performance

151
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:59,180
13.5 inch notebook that can be upgraded, customized and repaired.

152
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:04,820
Modular, repairable, upgradable, customizable. These are not usually the terms you hear thrown

153
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:08,860
around for a modern laptop anymore, so it definitely caught our attention. Let's talk

154
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:15,220
a little bit about the specs. 11th gen Intel core processors in there. Optional Wi-Fi 6E,

155
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:20,920
up to 64 gigabytes of DDR4 RAM, four terabytes of storage. It can go up to four terabytes

156
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:25,940
of storage, which is Gen 4 NVME storage. And then, of course, like Wes said, it's thin,

157
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:32,460
lightweight, got that 13.5 inch screen, which is running at a three by two screen ratio.

158
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:37,740
But the standout item here, like the feature, the headline feature of the framework laptop

159
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:42,060
supposedly is going to be this expansion card system, which is one of these things that

160
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:47,540
could be both brilliant and also disastrous, depending on how it's implemented. The idea

161
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:53,460
is you have these modules that have ports that can be interplaced with each other. USB-C

162
00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:58,980
is the back end connectivity, so you can get DisplayPort in there, micro SD, fast storage,

163
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:05,060
a high end headphone, amp, or just a USB-C port itself. Like you mix and match the modules

164
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:09,300
as you want. And that's going to be one of its strongest features, differentiators, you

165
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:10,300
could say.

166
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:14,420
So that is providing these modules get built and are there third parties that are interested

167
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:20,420
in. In theory, this is all open and anyone could build a module. Question is, will they?

168
00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:25,340
Now for upgrades, both storage and Wi-Fi are socketed and there's two slots of upgradable

169
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:30,840
memory. Even the entire main board can be swapped if you want to support a new CPU gen.

170
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:36,100
That's forward looking, I like it. High use parts like the battery, screen, keyboard and

171
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:41,900
color customizable magnetic attach bezels are also easy to replace. There's even QR

172
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:46,020
codes on each item that take you directly to guides on their site.

173
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:51,140
That's all pretty nice. And I'm starting to get a picture here of this laptop that I buy

174
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:56,980
once and then I upgrade for two or three cycles perhaps, and I can get different modules.

175
00:13:56,980 --> 00:14:05,160
The Linux support story in here is a little tricky. It's there, there is Linux support,

176
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:10,700
but it's it's not like a headline feature of this thing. It was mentioned once in their

177
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:15,020
post. Yeah. In the DIY edition of the laptop, which should honestly probably be what I'd

178
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:19,160
want to get anyways, but see, they know. Yeah. Yeah. Otherwise it's like windows 10 home

179
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:24,420
or windows 10 pro depending on who you are, but they're going to have the DIY DIY edition

180
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:27,860
for those of you who do prefer to install your own Linux. I don't even think it's going

181
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:32,320
to come preloaded, but all the parts, if you look at this thing, Intel processor, Intel

182
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:37,300
wifi, it's, it's all going to be supported by Linux. That's like, they don't have to

183
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:42,100
do much. And because the interconnect is likely using USB-C for all the different modules,

184
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:46,580
that's also going to work with Linux. We'll be fine. But it does remind me of my, one

185
00:14:46,580 --> 00:14:54,400
of my all time favorite laptops was the Apple power book, Pismo and wall street generations.

186
00:14:54,400 --> 00:15:00,060
They were, they were pretty cool laptops because they had these interchangeable modular base,

187
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:06,700
two of them, and you could change out the DVD drive for a battery. You could put a hard

188
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:13,060
disk in the slot, or if you were like me and we're a baller, you took two batteries and

189
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:17,620
you put them both in the module bay and you got all day battery life out of this laptop.

190
00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:25,220
It was awesome. Rocking like Mac OS classic nine or something really old. I mean, this

191
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:30,020
is a long time ago, but back then I grok the benefit of a modular laptop. It was like,

192
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:38,060
great to have. And so you're right. This would speak to me if you could do things like pop

193
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:44,860
in a graphics card, right? That's the kind of stuff. I appreciate that the CPU is socketed.

194
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:48,140
I'd love to see that more in modern laptops in the memory and all that, and the storage

195
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:52,340
is all socketed and even the motherboard is replaceable, but that's only as long as it

196
00:15:52,340 --> 00:15:57,780
fits within those thermal envelopes and that power profile. And there will be a point one

197
00:15:57,780 --> 00:16:01,680
or two CPU generations down the road where that's likely no longer going to be the case.

198
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:06,300
And you'll only get so much runway out of that replacing the motherboard CPU set up.

199
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:10,580
Yeah, but it's better than what we've got now, right? Yeah. I mean, even if you could

200
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:15,580
buy one generation of motherboard CPU after your generation, that'd be great. That really,

201
00:16:15,580 --> 00:16:19,240
cause that really would be, I mean, yeah, I'd like to see them do this. You know, they're

202
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:24,900
not really taking orders yet. It's still in the pre-order stage, but I looked at the crew

203
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:28,040
behind this and I thought, because that's what's going to make or break some fantasy

204
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:29,040
like this.

205
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:31,900
Who's actually trying to make this thing? It's a nice vision, but.

206
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:37,620
Yeah, well it is. And they acknowledge that they're making big claims. They say that consumer

207
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:43,260
electronics is littered with the graves of companies with grand ideas and failed executions.

208
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:47,180
The proof is going to be in the products. And they then go on to talk about what a great

209
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:53,500
team they have, which right now seems to be around 13 officially with about nine open

210
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:59,780
positions. Some of them rather critical, but I looked at their founder and I looked at

211
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:06,140
their system software engineer and they have some serious credentials, Wes. They have been

212
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:11,740
around. The founder spent years at Oculus and then even spent some years at Facebook

213
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:17,340
after the acquisition working on both software and hardware teams. Same with the main software

214
00:17:17,340 --> 00:17:22,860
engineer. Seemed like they were both directly responsible for essentially every Oculus product

215
00:17:22,860 --> 00:17:30,640
we've ever seen. And the other people on the team have experience from ASUS, Google, Dell.

216
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:34,100
There's others that they come from some decent pedigree.

217
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:38,660
And organizations that are building and shipping products, right? I think that's what stands

218
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:41,740
out here is it does seem like a team of people who've done this before have been through

219
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:48,660
successful releases of products and have clearly learned a lot. I think my main question is,

220
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:53,560
what's the market for this going to be? They're shooting pretty high here. I don't know what

221
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:58,680
kind of funding they have or what that runways look like and how much success do they need

222
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:03,100
to really make it here is going to be a question. Now, I think there has been more interest

223
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:07,500
in the general public and right to repair laws, repairability in general. Maybe this

224
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:12,900
stands out. I think what might make it or break it though is how thin does it really

225
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:15,540
end up being and are the aesthetics up to par?

226
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:19,620
Yeah. And then you got the nice things like how good is the keyboard? How's the screen

227
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:23,700
look? How's the track bad? How's the Wi-Fi reception? There's a lot that goes into a

228
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:24,700
good laptop.

229
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:26,420
Yeah. Does Bluetooth actually connect?

230
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:34,300
Yeah. It's a harder job than we could probably even imagine, but they do seem to have those

231
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:39,100
credentials. I'm very skeptical. I'd love to see something like this and even if it

232
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:44,020
just sort of pushed the industry or if it gave the folks over at System76 some ideas

233
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:48,300
they could do with a laptop, I'd be happy, right? I'm probably never going to buy this

234
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:51,460
laptop, but I'd love to see them push the market a little bit.

235
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:54,980
Right. At least hopefully this signals to other companies out that there might be some

236
00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:55,980
interest here.

237
00:18:55,980 --> 00:19:00,940
Well, something Google's been showing some interest in is funding Linux Kernel Security

238
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:05,780
Development. Google and the Linux Foundation have announced plans to fund two full-time

239
00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:11,020
maintainers to exclusively focus on Linux Kernel Security Development, Gustavo Silva

240
00:19:11,020 --> 00:19:12,020
and Nathan Chancellor.

241
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:16,660
Chancellor, who's been working on the Kernel for four and a half years, will be focused

242
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:23,260
on triaging and fixing bugs in Clang and LLVM while working on establishing continuous integration

243
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:29,300
systems to support that work. Now, this doesn't really sound like working on the Kernel, but

244
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:34,020
once those compiler aims are well established, Chancellor plans to begin adding features

245
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:39,680
and polish to the Kernel using those compiler technologies. He was quoted in the announcement

246
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:45,060
as saying, I hope that more and more people will start to use the LLVM compiler infrastructure

247
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:50,860
project and contribute fixes to it and the Kernel. It will go a long way towards improving

248
00:19:50,860 --> 00:19:53,820
Linux security for everyone.

249
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:58,940
As for Gustavo, he'll be focused full-time on eliminating several classes of buffer overflows

250
00:19:58,940 --> 00:20:04,740
by transforming all instances of zero-length and one-element arrays into flexible array

251
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:10,180
members, which is the preferred and least error-prone mechanism to declare those variables.

252
00:20:10,180 --> 00:20:16,380
Additionally, he is actively focusing on fixing bugs before they hit mainline, while also

253
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:22,380
proactively developing defense mechanisms that cut off whole classes of vulnerabilities.

254
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:27,620
He's well qualified for this work, he sent his first Kernel patch in 2010, and today

255
00:20:27,620 --> 00:20:32,980
is an active member of the Kernel Self-Protection Project. He's consistently one of the top

256
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:39,980
five most active Kernel developers since 2017, with more than 2,000 commits in mainline.

257
00:21:02,980 --> 00:21:09,980
He's also one of the top five most active Kernel developers since 2017, with more than

258
00:21:32,980 --> 00:21:39,980
2,000 commits in mainline.

259
00:22:02,980 --> 00:22:20,940
There's a shiny new version of Firefox out this week, and while we don't cover every

260
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:24,140
release, this one seemed pretty special.

261
00:22:24,140 --> 00:22:29,740
Version 86 is out, and one of their headline features is Total Cookie Protection, which

262
00:22:29,740 --> 00:22:36,220
they say is a major privacy advance in Firefox. It's essentially creating a cookie jar for

263
00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:38,380
each website, and I love that term.

264
00:22:38,380 --> 00:22:41,740
I know, there are consequences to this, but that's one of those features that made me

265
00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:44,340
think, why haven't we always been doing this?

266
00:22:44,340 --> 00:22:49,500
86 also has simultaneous picture-in-picture mode for multiple videos, which is going to

267
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:55,020
be fantastic for me because my security cameras on LadyJupes are all RTSP video feeds that

268
00:22:55,020 --> 00:23:01,300
I can pop out now into multiple independent players. Very excited about that. I actually

269
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:07,100
have switched back to Firefox recently, and I've seen notable performance improvements

270
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:09,580
even from the last time I tried it out.

271
00:23:09,580 --> 00:23:14,160
One of the performance improvements you might notice this time around is they've moved Canvas

272
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:18,420
Drawing and WebGL to the GPU process. That makes sense.

273
00:23:18,420 --> 00:23:24,380
That's going to be really nice. Some improvements to reader mode and also printing land in this

274
00:23:24,380 --> 00:23:29,740
version. But really, for me, it's all about the picture-in-picture mode, the cookie protection,

275
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:34,580
and taking those rendering processes and moving them to the GPU. You bring all of that together,

276
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:37,660
and I think it's one of these releases of Firefox where if you haven't tried it out

277
00:23:37,660 --> 00:23:42,700
for a while, it is definitely worth checking in because it's going to be noticeable.

278
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:47,300
You know, I gave that multiple picture-in-picture mode a shot, and it works pretty well. I'm

279
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:50,980
kind of impressed with that functionality in general. It feels pretty seamless, and

280
00:23:50,980 --> 00:23:55,460
honestly, regardless of the Linux desktop that I use it on, it just works, and that's

281
00:23:55,460 --> 00:23:56,460
impressive.

282
00:23:56,460 --> 00:24:02,300
Yeah. You know, in this release, they consolidated the way they do video decoding in Firefox

283
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:06,300
and not only improved performance, but actually managed to improve security and how they do

284
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:07,300
it as well.

285
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:11,500
You know, I've been using Firefox a lot more myself, and you mentioned those reader mode

286
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:15,780
improvements. Honestly, that's one of the reasons. It's been built in forever now, and

287
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:19,380
it just keeps working. I try to use it on basically every site.

288
00:24:19,380 --> 00:24:24,260
And on that theme of being back on Firefox for a bit, I really don't have any extensions

289
00:24:24,260 --> 00:24:29,040
anymore that are not available for Firefox, and the ones that I have used in Chrome and

290
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:34,300
I am now using in Firefox, I find small little things that seem like they are either better

291
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:39,300
integrated with Firefox or just the way it's all handled seems to work better in Firefox

292
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:43,460
than it does for the same exact extension. There's a handful of them in Chrome.

293
00:24:43,460 --> 00:24:45,780
You know, I have the same experience.

294
00:24:45,780 --> 00:24:49,320
I don't know what they're doing there, Wes, but I like it, and I've been really impressed

295
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:55,060
it's nice to make it theme and make it look like my desktop. It feels more like a native

296
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:57,940
Linux desktop web browser to me than Chrome does now.

297
00:24:57,940 --> 00:25:00,720
