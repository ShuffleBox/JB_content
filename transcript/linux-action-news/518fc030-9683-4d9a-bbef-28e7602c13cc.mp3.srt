00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,340
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, our weekly take on Linux and the open source world.

2
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:20,780
This is episode 77, recorded on October 28th, 2018.

3
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:21,780
I'm Chris.

4
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:22,780
And I'm Joe.

5
00:00:22,780 --> 00:00:23,780
Hello, Joe.

6
00:00:23,780 --> 00:00:27,640
It is great to be connected with you on episode 77 of the show.

7
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:33,600
We have major stories to get into, and let's start with one that I am elated to announce.

8
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,680
Linus is back in charge of the kernel.

9
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:42,520
Yeah, Greg KH has posted the 4.19 kernel and said, right, with that, then back to you,

10
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:43,520
Linus.

11
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:44,520
Yeah.

12
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:45,520
All right.

13
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:46,520
All done.

14
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:47,520
Actually, he had a really good post.

15
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:50,240
I mean, these things are typically pretty brief when you're doing a release, like here's

16
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:53,200
the new stuff and have at it.

17
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:57,920
But this time, he took a moment when he knew everybody would be watching, and he wrote

18
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:00,020
out a great post.

19
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:01,760
And he talked a little bit about the past few months.

20
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:06,500
He says, this is a quote from his mailing list, post, the last few months have been

21
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:11,400
a tough one for our community, as it's our community that is fighting from within itself,

22
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:14,280
with prodding from others outside of it.

23
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:18,180
Don't fall into the cycle of arguing about those others.

24
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:22,600
That is the trap that countless communities have fallen into over the centuries.

25
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:24,020
We share the same goal.

26
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:26,280
Let us never lose sight of that.

27
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:28,520
So here is my plea to everyone out there.

28
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:33,600
Let us take a day off or two, rest, relax with friends by sharing a meal, recharge,

29
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:36,700
and then get back to work to help continue to create the system that the world has never

30
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:39,580
seen the likes of together.

31
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:43,600
And then towards the end, he says, and with that, Linus, I'm handing the kernel tree back

32
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:44,600
to you.

33
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:47,840
You can have the joy of dealing with the merge window.

34
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:51,080
Did you see the interview that Swapnil did with the two of them?

35
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:52,080
No, I didn't see that.

36
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:53,520
It was really interesting, actually.

37
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:57,880
It was at the Open Source Summit Europe in Edinburgh this week.

38
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:59,680
And it was a really good chat that he had with them.

39
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:06,800
And what really came across to me was that they just care about the technicalities of

40
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:07,800
it.

41
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:09,200
They were really getting into the details of everything.

42
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:12,600
And they kind of touched on the politics side of things.

43
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:18,400
But it just seems to me that they don't care, Linus and Greg, about that stuff.

44
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:22,400
They do obviously want things to run smoothly.

45
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:26,880
And we know that Linus has got this email filter now that he's talked about.

46
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:31,760
But he really wants to just concentrate on making the best bit of software possible.

47
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:35,200
And that seems to be all he's ever really cared about.

48
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,800
You know, I might check that out.

49
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:41,120
I would agree that when I had the opportunity to chat with Greg, or when I've just read

50
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:45,560
the mailing list, their focus really is the technical details of how to build a kernel.

51
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:50,000
And that may be why they kind of took a while to get around to a code of conduct.

52
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,400
That's not what their focus was.

53
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:55,080
Either way, it's good to see Linus back in action.

54
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:59,080
And all eyes are on Linus now.

55
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:04,400
His first correction of a patch has already made news since he's been back in the captain's

56
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,400
chair.

57
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:10,640
It's already across all the news sites about quoting Linus, about how he responded to a

58
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:14,000
patch request, and how it compares to previous responses.

59
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,720
And the whole analysis has already begun.

60
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:16,720
And it's been one day.

61
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:17,720
Yeah.

62
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:21,440
And if you actually look at what he wrote in that email, it was very calm, wasn't it?

63
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:28,000
It was very much about technical details and no kind of ad hominems or any of that.

64
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,280
He's delivered on his promise, at least so far.

65
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:32,920
It's not been very long, but fingers crossed.

66
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:35,000
It was still classic Linus, though.

67
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,120
There's a dig in there about how all developers want their kernel modules to be on by default

68
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,120
at boot.

69
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:41,880
And there's a couple of moments in there.

70
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:46,760
It's not mean, but it's still, he's very clear about why this isn't okay and what the technical

71
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:47,760
mistake was.

72
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:52,840
I also read an interview that he did at that summit, and he was asked about the eBPF stuff

73
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:53,840
in the kernel.

74
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,760
And he was kind of broadly positive about that.

75
00:03:55,760 --> 00:04:00,660
This eBPF stuff is going to represent a massive change in the way developers can interact

76
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:02,440
with the kernel and build tools.

77
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:05,200
BPF probably sounds familiar, the Berkeley Packet Filter.

78
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,800
It's something that PF Sense has built in.

79
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:07,800
The BSDs have it.

80
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:08,800
It's great.

81
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:13,720
And it's helped them create a really powerful packet filter.

82
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:15,940
That wasn't good enough, though, for the Linux camp.

83
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:22,080
They're implementing eBPF, extended BPF, which is building on top of a virtual machine that

84
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:26,760
accepts bytecode inside the kernel, which can be used to create incredible tools.

85
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:31,520
If you use something like TCP dump, you're already using eBPF, and you just didn't know

86
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:32,520
it.

87
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:38,360
We did an expansive coverage of eBPF and the tools that it can create, how you can use

88
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:39,360
it today.

89
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:42,360
And even hardware that's being built around this new technology.

90
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:43,360
It's episode 388.

91
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:49,080
You go to techsnap.systems.com and yeah, I think the kernel developers are excited about

92
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:53,480
it because it's been around for about four years in the core kernel.

93
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:57,800
But we're just now starting to see really cool tools being built around it.

94
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59,880
And so it's getting a lot of attention.

95
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:03,160
And the kernel developers are starting to talk about it more and more.

96
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:04,880
And that's what drew our attention to it.

97
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,500
That's why we made that TechSnap episode.

98
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:07,760
It's really awesome.

99
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:11,480
Yeah, and don't tell him listeners, but I got paid to listen to that twice and I would

100
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:14,400
have done it for free.

101
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:15,400
You know what, Joe?

102
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:16,400
It was worth it.

103
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:17,400
You're a good editor.

104
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:20,040
Yeah, so TechSnap.systems.com if you want to see that.

105
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:23,600
And that's the kind of stuff, though, going back to your point about them being excited

106
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:26,040
about the technical details of the kernel.

107
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:27,640
That's the kind of stuff that shows it.

108
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:30,040
They really enjoy that stuff.

109
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:34,440
And it's pretty awesome to see that passion after all of these years.

110
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:36,460
And it feels good to have Linus back.

111
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:40,080
And so far, it seems like it was a productive absence.

112
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:44,800
Yeah, and one of the best things that I took from these interviews was them treating this

113
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:47,560
code of conduct as a last resort.

114
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:50,960
And that they're moving forward, they've got that in place.

115
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:53,140
And it's not going to be something that's used all the time.

116
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:59,880
It's just there as a kind of safety net for if the other procedures and protocols fall

117
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:00,880
down.

118
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:03,120
And if there are serious problems, then they'll go back to that.

119
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:07,560
So my fears have been completely laid by the interviews that I've seen and read over the

120
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:08,560
last week.

121
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:13,640
Well, your fears about Google may be allayed soon, too, at least if Pine64 is successful.

122
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:18,280
Yeah, Pine64, who are well known for their various single-board computers that look a

123
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:21,960
little bit like Raspberry Pis, but are generally more powerful, I think.

124
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:26,520
And of course, the Pinebook, which I have paid for and am waiting to be dispatched anytime

125
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:27,520
soon.

126
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:30,640
So hopefully, I'll have an update on that soon.

127
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:35,180
And they are planning to make a phone now and a tablet, by the looks of things, both

128
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:37,960
of which will be based on plasma mobile.

129
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:40,960
Hey, hey, hey, I love hearing that.

130
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:45,400
This is also another story out of the Open Source Summit Europe edition.

131
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:49,620
And tip of the hat to Itz Foss for going out there and getting this story directly from

132
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:53,260
Jonathan Riddle, the main man behind KDE Neon.

133
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:59,180
And it appears that Itz Foss also contacted the Pine64 team and got confirmation from

134
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:01,440
them as well that they're working on these plans.

135
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:05,360
So we have confirmation from Pine64 and Jonathan Riddle.

136
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:06,640
Something's in the works here.

137
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:08,520
Yeah, stress in the works.

138
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:09,520
This is not available yet.

139
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:13,880
It's not even pre-order time, but it's kind of build the hype time.

140
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:16,240
And I'm on board with that hype, man.

141
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,280
This sounds amazing.

142
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:18,520
There was a line in there.

143
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:23,920
Itz Foss asked why they don't have the Librem 5 on display at their booth.

144
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:28,560
And Jonathan said that the Librem has been more focused on GNOME than KDE.

145
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:33,240
And so they felt like going with Pine, it sounds like, if you read between the lines,

146
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:38,120
was a better direction to go than plan on the Librem 5.

147
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:40,280
It's kind of what I grok from that.

148
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:42,460
Well, that's one way to look at it.

149
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:45,920
Another way is why not both?

150
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:49,880
And that's kind of how the Librem 5 is.

151
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:51,440
Why not both on that?

152
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:55,200
You have to concentrate on one more than the other to some extent.

153
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:59,620
And it looks like Purism are going to be focusing almost completely on GNOME, but they're going

154
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:02,600
to have this plasma mobile option.

155
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:08,200
And so it kind of makes sense that if various hardware makers are looking to build a phone

156
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:12,400
that's free software, why not work with everyone?

157
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:16,760
Having the Pine folks involved has really piqued my interest in a way that maybe another

158
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:19,200
hardware vendor would not have.

159
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:23,160
And you could end up seeing a bit of a Pine platform develop here, because you'll have

160
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:28,560
the phone, a tablet, of course, you'll have the Pine book, or you could just get yourself

161
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:32,200
the Pine A64 board and use that.

162
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:35,160
And those are around 15, 20 US greenbacks.

163
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:41,800
I mean, you have a really low cost platform where plasma is going to be a first class

164
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:42,800
citizen.

165
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:43,800
I don't know.

166
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:47,720
Maybe my plasma fanboy is shining a little too brightly here, but I think this is a very

167
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:49,360
exciting development.

168
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:53,920
And I don't expect it to make billions, but I do expect it to provide lots of fun entertainment

169
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:54,920
for myself.

170
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:56,700
And that makes me happy.

171
00:08:56,700 --> 00:09:01,400
One word of warning, though, is take their prices with something of a pinch of salt,

172
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:04,840
because the Pine book is supposed to be $99, right?

173
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:06,480
It's this amazingly cheap laptop.

174
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,020
OK, it's ARM based.

175
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:09,020
It's not super powerful.

176
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:12,040
It's only got like a couple of gigs of RAM or whatever.

177
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:13,040
But it's $99.

178
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:14,040
Well, hmm, asterisk.

179
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:21,920
By the time you've paid for shipping to the UK, I paid $138.99, including shipping.

180
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:24,080
And that doesn't include import taxes.

181
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:31,040
So I'm expecting it to be somewhere around $175, $200-ish by the time I get it, which

182
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:32,040
is still cheap.

183
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:34,540
But just be aware of that.

184
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:40,160
They tend to not put the shipping costs up front, which is a little bit disingenuous.

185
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:41,760
But I still want this to happen.

186
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:45,840
And I still want to get my Pinebook, which I ordered quite a while ago, to be honest.

187
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:47,240
But I understand they're a small company.

188
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:49,880
They need to get the order together and everything.

189
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:54,600
But I don't think we'll be seeing this before the Librem 5, put it that way.

190
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:57,280
But I'm happy to be surprised on that one.

191
00:09:57,280 --> 00:10:03,240
Well, maybe you should save your crypto for HTC's blockchain phone, although not quite

192
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:04,840
what was originally promised.

193
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:06,280
Yeah, talk about hype.

194
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:12,000
This is a phone that you can pre-order, but only using either Bitcoin or Ether.

195
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,480
I love it.

196
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:17,120
Yeah, which is a bit strange, really, because then they never know exactly how much money

197
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,440
they're going to get for it.

198
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:19,840
Because it's quite expensive, isn't it?

199
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:20,840
Well, I don't know, Joe.

200
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:23,120
It depends on how much of a Bitcoin baller you are.

201
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:29,640
Because right now, depending on the price of Bitcoin, it's selling for 0.15 Bitcoin,

202
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:30,680
which actually is a ton of money.

203
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:33,400
That's about nearly $1,000 US dollars.

204
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:38,120
Yeah, which most phones are about that these days, to be fair, like any sort of iPhone

205
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:42,080
or high-end Samsung or Pixel or whatever.

206
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:45,040
And this is, you know, it's no slouch, is it?

207
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:50,440
Six gigs of RAM, 128 gigs of storage, Snapdragon 845.

208
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:53,080
This is pretty much flagship territory, isn't it?

209
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:56,000
So that's about the right price, I would say.

210
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,840
Well, certainly market price.

211
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:00,960
Maybe the whole market's a bit inflated at the moment.

212
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:06,440
Yeah, it's expensive, but it could be a lot cheaper in a couple of days, couldn't it,

213
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:07,440
with the way Bitcoin goes.

214
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:08,440
Yeah, I suppose.

215
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:10,920
Maybe they'll just adjust the price upwards, though.

216
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:13,760
So what makes it a quote-unquote blockchain phone?

217
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:18,120
I mean, they had all these ideas about using it for Bitcoin trading and whatnot and having

218
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:20,380
a secure crypto wallet.

219
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:21,920
But here's what they ended up with.

220
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:24,300
And I suppose in a sense, this isn't bad.

221
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:28,020
But it's not really necessarily dependent on a phone.

222
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:29,520
It's implemented at the app level.

223
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:36,040
HTC made a social key recovery mechanism in case you lose your phone and get stolen, etc.

224
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:39,420
And you're able to keep the recovery details with a few trustworthy friends.

225
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:41,680
You can spread it out amongst them.

226
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:44,200
And then they have to download an app to manage your key.

227
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:49,200
Hey, that's just great right there, asking people to install a random HTC app for you.

228
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:55,400
And then HTC then uses a secret sharing algorithm, direct quote, to send the info to your friends,

229
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:57,840
which then you can piece together if needed.

230
00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:01,200
Because it's stored out in a distributed personal blockchain, you see.

231
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,800
So it's a blockchain phone.

232
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:06,680
And the phone's also being opened up to third-party developers if they want to make an app based

233
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:08,880
on the similar back-end technology.

234
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:10,760
So that's why it's a blockchain phone.

235
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:12,000
We didn't mention the name of it.

236
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,360
It's called the Exodus.

237
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:16,840
It's almost like the headlines write themselves, isn't it, when this doesn't do very well.

238
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:18,000
Yeah, you're right about this.

239
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:23,360
And then, of course, expect the followed headline, blockchain technologies are failing.

240
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:24,360
Yeah.

241
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:26,060
Well, we'll see.

242
00:12:26,060 --> 00:12:29,000
We might be surprised, but I doubt it.

243
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:35,200
A very few select Firefox users may have a little surprise in their hamburger menu soon.

244
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:38,960
Yeah, it might be recommending that you sign up for ProtonVPN.

245
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:44,120
So if you're out and about at a coffee shop or whatever using unsecure Wi-Fi, and you

246
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:49,280
could use a VPN, then a randomly selected, very small number of Firefox users will get

247
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:55,680
this pop-up, this suggestion, saying, hey, sign up for ProtonVPN for $10 a month.

248
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:58,160
And then you'll be all secure and everything.

249
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:00,840
And oh, yeah, Mozilla's going to get a bit of a kickback from it.

250
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:02,800
But yeah, that's fair enough, right?

251
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:03,800
Advertising in your browser.

252
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:04,800
OK.

253
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,800
So does this bother you, Joe?

254
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,800
Because it seems like this might bother you a little bit.

255
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:12,000
I mean, they've got to make a living making that browser, right?

256
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,340
Well, I really don't know how to feel about this.

257
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:19,280
Because on the one hand, it feels a bit dirty for them to put adverts in their browser.

258
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:22,700
But then they have to keep going.

259
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:25,020
And the Google money is going to dry up.

260
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:26,340
We've been talking about this for ages.

261
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:30,980
The main revenue stream for Mozilla is the Google search money.

262
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:35,160
And that's a bit weird and has been for a long time, because Firefox is this direct

263
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:37,240
competitor to Chrome.

264
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:41,680
And so Google could pull the plug at any point, potentially.

265
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:46,440
Now, you do have to also consider that they did get quite a lot of money out of Yahoo,

266
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:48,160
over a billion dollars.

267
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,400
You do love to bring that up.

268
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:53,840
Well, you know, a billion dollars is not an insignificant figure, is it?

269
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:58,840
Both the company who Yahoo now is, basically, are looking to challenge that and not pay

270
00:13:58,840 --> 00:13:59,840
up.

271
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:04,960
So you can kind of see why they want to diversify their revenue streams, for want of a better

272
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:05,960
phrase.

273
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:06,960
So here's their pitch, though, Joe.

274
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:11,520
They say, we've examined each vendor's privacy and data retention policies to ensure they

275
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:14,520
log as little user data as possible.

276
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:20,040
And we also considered numerous other factors, including local privacy laws, company track

277
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:25,400
record, their transparency, and quality of support as a result of this evaluation.

278
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:29,040
Mozilla has selected ProtonVPN for this experiment.

279
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:33,920
What they're telling you is, look, end user, we know picking a VPN is hard.

280
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:38,920
So we went through all of the options, whittled it down to ProtonVPN, and hey, they're based

281
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:39,920
out of Switzerland.

282
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:41,080
Isn't that swell?

283
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:43,200
So we think this is the one you should use.

284
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:47,760
And we're going to just go ahead and make life easier for you and just put a button

285
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:51,440
in your hamburger menu where you can sign up right here now.

286
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:54,760
And to be fair, ProtonMail is what they're mostly known for.

287
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:59,920
I've never heard anything but good things from the audience and people in the community.

288
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:01,300
Everyone has always said that's great.

289
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:03,080
It does seem like they picked a good one.

290
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:04,840
Well, I hope so, yeah.

291
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:07,760
I think overall, this is a valuable test.

292
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:12,820
First of all, it's like they stress several times, a very small percentage of the Firefox

293
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:18,680
user base, but also maybe this is the kind of thing that Mozilla should be doing.

294
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:21,700
They have a bit of trust here with end users, and that's why people are using their web

295
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:23,280
browser.

296
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:27,760
And this issue of who's a safe VPN provider, who's not going to just hand over all of my

297
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:33,700
records to some IP enforcement cop when they come knocking or whatever the case may be,

298
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:36,520
people have these issues, these questions.

299
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:38,920
And you can trust Mozilla to a degree here, I think.

300
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:42,320
I believe them when they say they went through and vetted a bunch of different ones.

301
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:46,400
I'm sure the one that was willing to work with them and give them a cut also played

302
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:49,200
a factor here, but I believe them.

303
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:52,640
And that may be a valuable service they're providing to end users now.

304
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:57,360
And if they get two bucks out of 10 bucks a month, I kind of like that too, because

305
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:59,000
I want Mozilla to keep on going.

306
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,200
And I don't want them to be hooked to the Google sauce.

307
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:04,920
My understanding is it's significantly more than $2, but either way, they're still making

308
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:06,720
a fair bit of revenue here.

309
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:13,200
And you're right, I'd much rather trust an organization like Mozilla than any other similarly

310
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:21,040
sized or bigger tech giant, because they seem to have kind of decent founding principles.

311
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:23,200
They're not all about maximizing profits.

312
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:27,640
Yeah, they're all about making enough revenue to keep going and self-sustain and everything,

313
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:31,120
but they're not this big evil corporation, are they?

314
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:33,080
Yeah, I think there's a degree of that.

315
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:37,400
And also, I just fundamentally trust their motivations for making a web browser, and

316
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:40,560
they line up with my intentions.

317
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:44,600
So at the end of the day, that's why I kind of have the most trust for Mozilla, even regardless

318
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:45,600
of their size.

319
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:46,600
Yeah.

320
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:52,300
Well, speaking of Yahoo's billion, Red Hat became a billion dollar company back in 2012.

321
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:57,440
And today, IBM is announcing that they are acquiring Red Hat for $34 billion.

322
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:58,440
Wow.

323
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:01,260
That's all I can say to that.

324
00:17:01,260 --> 00:17:02,260
This is huge.

325
00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:03,720
This is simply huge news.

326
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:07,920
And Jim Whitehurst, the president and CEO of Red Hat, wrote, joining forces with IBM

327
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:12,520
will provide us a greater level of scale, resources, and capabilities to accelerate

328
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:17,680
the impact of open source as the basis for the digital transformation and bring Red Hat

329
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:19,960
to an even wider audience.

330
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:24,840
Now he also says they're going to preserve their unique culture, and that IBM is going

331
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:29,320
to operate Red Hat as essentially a arms reach sub-corporation.

332
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:31,320
Do you buy that?

333
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:33,840
Well, that's what you would say, wouldn't you?

334
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:34,840
Yeah.

335
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:35,840
I suppose you would.

336
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:37,880
It's certainly going to be the case for a while.

337
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:42,400
But how long that will be, I don't know, really.

338
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:46,360
I mean, my initial reaction to this was, well, at least it's not Microsoft.

339
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:47,360
Hmm.

340
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:49,200
You know, that is interesting.

341
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:53,840
My first thought was, I wonder if there was a bidding race and Microsoft was in the contending.

342
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:58,720
A lot of times when it breaks like this, you learn after the fact that several companies

343
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:03,880
were in the bidding process, and you do have to kind of wonder if that was going on here.

344
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:08,320
What strikes me about this is this would have been a good purchase for Microsoft, because

345
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:14,720
in this press release and how IBM's already talking about it, it's all 100% cloud.

346
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:20,160
This is a direct quote from IBM's chairman, the acquisition of Red Hat is a game changer.

347
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:23,660
It changes everything about the cloud market.

348
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:24,940
This is all about the cloud.

349
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:25,940
It's not about desktop.

350
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:29,400
You know, so this would have been right in their Azure wheelhouse.

351
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:34,720
But as somebody who does keep an eye on the desktop, I do wonder what this means long

352
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:37,240
term for the Fedora project.

353
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:40,320
I'm talking in two years, or even CentOS.

354
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:43,120
What does this mean long term for those freebies from Red Hat?

355
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:45,360
Well, I don't think two years is long term here.

356
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:48,880
I think in two years, we won't see any difference at all.

357
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:54,020
I think maybe five to 10 years is when we'll start seeing a potential difference here.

358
00:18:54,020 --> 00:18:57,280
But the thing is that it's an open source company, isn't it?

359
00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:02,040
It's a fundamentally open source company, Red Hat, that has been acquired here.

360
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:11,320
And if you start making changes to the culture of that, then it's not worth buying in the

361
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:12,400
first place, is it?

362
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:14,400
What they're buying is an open source culture.

363
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:17,960
And okay, it's a very profitable open source culture.

364
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:23,680
But if they just kick that out and start saying, there's no more free versions, there's no

365
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:28,360
more Fedora, there's no more CentOS, and start cracking down on things like Scientific or

366
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:33,600
whatever, that's just going to be such bad PR for them that why did they bother in the

367
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:34,600
first place?

368
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:39,080
People will move away from them to things like SUSE and Ubuntu.

369
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:40,080
Yeah.

370
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:47,140
And I think CentOS and Scientific and Fedora play an important in the door role.

371
00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:51,960
You always heard Adobe knows that there's a percentage of Photoshop that gets pirated,

372
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:55,880
and they're actually okay with that, because then they have another stat that shows them

373
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:59,560
a percentage of those users end up just buying the software, and it's like a pre-sales tool

374
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:00,560
for a lot of them.

375
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:03,600
Yeah, it might be five or 10 years down the road after they've finished being a student

376
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,680
or whatever, but yeah, eventually it pays off.

377
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:11,040
I think the other thing you have to ask when a big, big announcement like this first hits

378
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:16,460
and you're trying to figure out how to process it, is the new owner going to be a better

379
00:20:16,460 --> 00:20:19,440
owner of the old things?

380
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:22,240
And I think the question here is, will IBM be a better owner?

381
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:25,440
Will they be a better steward of Red Hat's technologies?

382
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:27,760
Now you got to give IBM credit in this space.

383
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:30,600
For years now, they have been very pro-Linux.

384
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:34,940
They have probably been responsible for some of the largest enterprise Linux deployments

385
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:37,880
in history, and they did those commercials that were pretty great.

386
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:40,020
People I'm sure remember those.

387
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:41,880
So there could have been a worse company here.

388
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:45,060
I mean, I'm not saying it was going to be Oracle, but it could have been a company like

389
00:20:45,060 --> 00:20:47,900
Oracle here, you know?

390
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:48,900
Maybe not.

391
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:49,900
It's a bit old, but.

392
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:53,440
It's funny, you say a worse company and mention Oracle, okay, that's probably the worst it

393
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:59,360
could have been, but I can think of one on a par with Microsoft that seemed very likely

394
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:00,360
to me, Amazon.

395
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:02,960
Oh, I thought you were going to say Google.

396
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:05,760
Yeah, I guess so, right, because of all that AWS.

397
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:10,840
Well, yeah, and the fact that Amazon Linux is based on Red Hat, it kind of makes sense,

398
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:11,840
doesn't it?

399
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:12,840
Yeah, you're right.

400
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:15,860
Ooh, I would love to know if there's a bidding war here, because I totally could see Amazon

401
00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:16,860
in the mix too.

402
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:22,400
I could see Amazon, Microsoft, and Google, and IBM, of course, all bidding.

403
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:23,400
Absolutely.

404
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:27,480
And I'll tell you, the industry take here is that out of the group, IBM has the best

405
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:32,400
sales team, and that that's been an area that Red Hat's been okay in, but could have been

406
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:37,040
doing better, and that's where IBM could take things to the next level.

407
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:40,760
So what do you think the feeling inside the Red Hat camp is now that this news is broken?

408
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:44,640
Well, I've heard from a few that it's bad.

409
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:49,840
That the big concern is that they do have a very unique culture, and that that culture

410
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:52,040
could be damaged.

411
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:56,540
End of days could be described as some of the feelings that are being expressed.

412
00:21:56,540 --> 00:21:59,080
But I can't speak for everybody, who really knows?

413
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:01,240
I think most of them are just processing this.

414
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:06,040
I think the corporation is going to have a big old company-wide meeting to have a talk

415
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:08,240
about this, because this is happening on a Sunday.

416
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:10,960
I don't think that was the intention.

417
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:15,880
But earlier today, the news started to leak, Reuters and Bloomberg had rumors, it started

418
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:20,280
to spread over Reddit and Twitter, and so they just decided to leap on it before they

419
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:23,280
had a chance to send around the company-wide email.

420
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:26,980
So put yourself in their position for a moment, a Red Hat employee's position.

421
00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:31,280
You're browsing your Sunday Twitter, and you see that your company's been bought.

422
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:32,500
What kind of revelation is that?

423
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:37,440
And then the email comes in saying that we're being acquired.

424
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:40,400
That must be one heck of a Sunday.

425
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:45,760
Yeah, you'd think that there'd be procedures in place, that your immediate manager or whatever,

426
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:47,520
or they'd be in all hands.

427
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:52,200
You don't want to hear this stuff on Twitter, it must be very alarming for them.

428
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:54,440
They just don't really have much information.

429
00:22:54,440 --> 00:23:01,840
You would hope that on Monday, when the meeting happens, and when people are actually at work

430
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:06,600
talking to their colleagues, and they have some more clarity on this, that things won't

431
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:14,060
feel as bad for them, because like them or not, Red Hat are the poster child for making

432
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:15,400
money with open source.

433
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:19,920
They're pretty much all we have in terms of making serious money.

434
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:22,520
Joe, allow me to interject for just a second here.

435
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:26,040
What you're referring to as Red Hat is actually now known as IBM.

436
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:28,760
They're the leaders in making money.

437
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:31,820
It does kind of make me wonder if Canonical is next.

438
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:35,680
If you were going to ask me to make a prediction, I would have said Canonical is going to get

439
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:37,680
bought first.

440
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:39,400
So now what?

441
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:43,800
Because that's a massive behemoth for Canonical to try to sell against.

442
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:49,120
Well, we've seen SUSE get bought and now Red Hat, so who else is left?

443
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:50,120
Well we just won't know, Joe.

444
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:52,300
We'll just have to keep watching the news and report it here.

445
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:57,320
You can get the latest, including the developments of this IBM purchasing Red Hat story, and

446
00:23:57,320 --> 00:24:01,760
if anything major breaks between now and Linux Unplugged, we'll cover it there too.

447
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:04,840
But in the meantime, just to make sure you're getting it every single week, and getting

448
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:10,120
that analysis, go to linuxactionnews.com slash subscribe for all of the ways to get new episodes.

449
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:13,840
And go to linuxactionnews.com slash contact for ways to get in touch.

450
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:18,040
And we'll be back next Monday with our weekly take on the latest Linux and open source news.

451
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:20,280
I am at Chris LAS.

452
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:21,880
I'm at Joel Ressington.

453
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:25,040
Thank you for joining us, and we will see you next week.

454
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:40,040
Bye for now, see you later.
