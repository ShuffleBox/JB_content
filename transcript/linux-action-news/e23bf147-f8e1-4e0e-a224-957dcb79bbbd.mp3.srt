00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,680
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, our weekly take on Linux and the open source world.

2
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:20,560
This is episode 33, recorded on December 19th, 2017.

3
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:21,560
I'm Chris.

4
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:22,560
And I'm Joe.

5
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:23,560
Hello, Joe.

6
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:24,560
It's good to be with you.

7
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:28,360
We are recording out of time, ahead of time this week for the holidays, and we've put

8
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:30,580
together a holiday special.

9
00:00:30,580 --> 00:00:34,820
Look back at some of the big stories from 2017, the things that really changed Linux

10
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:35,820
and open source.

11
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:41,400
Yeah, so let's start with 32-bit support, and a number of distros dropped it this year.

12
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:46,040
It seems that 2017 is at least the beginning of the end for 32-bit Linux.

13
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:53,280
Yeah, it kicked off really, to my recollection, on January 23rd when Arch announced that they

14
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:57,480
were beginning the process, they say due to decreasing popularity, which is what a lot

15
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:00,440
of the distributions recently cited, like Tails and others.

16
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:05,840
Yeah, Ubuntu 17.10, of course, there's no 32-bit desktop image for that, although there

17
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:12,360
are still 32-bit packages in the archive and will be probably for quite a while.

18
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:17,680
I think we've seen the tide turn in 2017 away from 32-bit.

19
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:23,120
Because of containerization and things like that, it's not going to completely go away.

20
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:27,960
But I think certainly in the desktop world, you have distros like Solus that never even

21
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:35,480
bothered with 32-bit support, because realistically, the only machines that are still working and

22
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:39,460
going to actually give you any sort of performance are netbooks, and even they are pretty old

23
00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:41,200
hat now.

24
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:45,520
But everything else for the last 10 years-ish has been 64-bit capable.

25
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:50,640
So it's time for 32-bit to die on the desktop, I think.

26
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:51,640
I suppose so.

27
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:52,640
We did see some pushback.

28
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:56,440
In fact, I recall even you and I were talking about how I think you still have a 32-bit

29
00:01:56,440 --> 00:02:01,280
system in production or so that you still find perfectly useful and functional.

30
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:04,480
So there's people out there that are still rocking 32-bit.

31
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:10,760
But if you look at just the date math, I don't think Intel has shipped a non-64-bit chip

32
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:14,680
in eight years, nine years for the desktop.

33
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:17,200
Yeah, it's time.

34
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:21,080
The system I had, I kind of remember why I had installed 32-bit.

35
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:27,280
I think I had some issue with some application, and I just stuck with it through sheer stubbornness.

36
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:31,360
But then I upgraded to a newer version of Ubuntu and just went 64-bit.

37
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:34,420
And now I don't have any 32-bit systems at all.

38
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:39,680
One of the other stories we watched unfold throughout the year was the slow and obvious

39
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,600
failure of Limux.

40
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:47,860
Yeah, in Munich in Germany, it was the poster child for open source and government, a project

41
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:50,940
that was around for about 10 years.

42
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:55,320
And this year, they voted to return to Windows and started to see that rollout happen now.

43
00:02:55,320 --> 00:03:00,360
And it's just the end of a chapter, the end of an experiment that went horribly wrong,

44
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:01,360
unfortunately.

45
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:06,780
But you know, Joe, when Munich closes a door, Microsoft opens a window, and those users

46
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:11,620
that will be switching back to Windows 10 will at least be able to install Ubuntu or

47
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:17,720
maybe even Fedora because this was the year where Ubuntu arrived in the Windows Store

48
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:22,560
and SUSE and Fedora were announced to be there soon, the subsystem for Linux went out to

49
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,700
all Windows 10 users.

50
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:29,440
This was the year that this really took place, like it all clicked in and Microsoft delivered

51
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:32,640
on this run bash on top of Windows reality.

52
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:35,480
Yeah, it's kind of everything but Linux, isn't it?

53
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:40,660
The kernel, it's open SSH now as well, as we talked about recently.

54
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:46,360
It's Microsoft embracing open source, realizing where the market's going, and taking decisive

55
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:50,880
action to not be left behind, which I'd rather they didn't, because I'd rather they were

56
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:55,460
left behind and people moved over to Linux, but the market reality is they've decided

57
00:03:55,460 --> 00:04:00,960
to embrace this stuff, and it's probably going to eat into the potential converts over to

58
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:01,960
Linux.

59
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:06,660
Perhaps there's nothing like seeing Ubuntu in the Windows Store, you go into the Microsoft

60
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:11,640
Windows Store, and you search for Ubuntu, and there's this big logo and screenshots,

61
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:13,400
it's really quite the experience.

62
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:18,340
But it's not the true Linux experience, so it may stop the bleeding, but I'm not super

63
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:19,340
worried about it.

64
00:04:19,340 --> 00:04:23,200
In the meantime, I'm just too distracted by Bitcoin and all of the forks we saw this year.

65
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:26,080
Yeah, it's been a funny old year for Bitcoin.

66
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:32,200
Of course, now the value is about 20 times what it was at the beginning of the year.

67
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:35,520
We did say we were recording this earlier, it could crash in the next few days before

68
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,640
this is published, so let's hope that it is.

69
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:39,680
I suppose it's always possible, right?

70
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:44,960
But yeah, two hard forks appeared, and there was the threat of a third one.

71
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:50,440
The first one was Bitcoin Cash, and then the second one, Bitcoin Gold.

72
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:56,260
And to be honest, I haven't even really cashed in my Bitcoin Cash or Gold.

73
00:04:56,260 --> 00:05:00,200
To me, it seems not even really worth doing.

74
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,200
What about you?

75
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:03,440
Have you managed to get hold of yours and sort it out?

76
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:09,200
I haven't really pursued it that far, because the whole Bitcoin fork fiascos just got me

77
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:15,880
more interested in some of the cooler cryptocurrencies, like Monero and Dash, that to me may have

78
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:19,720
longer-lasting usefulness on the internet than Bitcoin.

79
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:24,120
So I don't know, it's funny, these forks got me less interested in Bitcoin and more interested

80
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:27,400
in other cryptocurrencies, which I think is a good thing.

81
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:28,880
I'm not sure, Joe.

82
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:32,760
But at the same time, I was kind of expecting these forks to destabilize it and make the

83
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:35,920
price go down, and it's just had the complete opposite effect.

84
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:39,440
Whether or not that price would have gone up regardless, I don't know, but it's almost

85
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:46,760
legitimized it as the Coke or the Pepsi, whatever, the name you know in cryptocurrencies.

86
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:51,160
Yeah, I should save this rest for a predictions episode in the future.

87
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:56,440
But I really have been struck by everything that turns out initially to be negative news

88
00:05:56,440 --> 00:06:01,000
for Bitcoin eventually just led to the rise of the price of Bitcoin, Joe.

89
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,840
So it's pretty nuts to watch all of this stuff.

90
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:05,600
And these forks still are going.

91
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:09,400
I see people talking about them online, so it's not like they're dead.

92
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:14,840
And it's a good space to trial and error different approaches to these technologies.

93
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:20,400
So it seems to have been a net positive, just like some people speculate there's too many

94
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:25,140
Linux distributions and other people say it's a natural evolutionary course where all these

95
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:27,080
different ideas get to be tried out.

96
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:30,320
I think it's a one-to-one comparison to cryptocurrencies.

97
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:34,360
Yeah, I think that's a reasonable way to look at it.

98
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:38,200
If you look at these two forks, they weren't just for a laugh, were they?

99
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:43,840
They were there to solve a particular technical problem, and that is there is not enough space

100
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:44,840
in each block.

101
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:49,600
There are not enough transactions per block, and that is eventually going to cause a huge

102
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:50,600
problem.

103
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:54,560
We've already got transaction fees through the roof unless you want to wait for a very

104
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:57,960
long time for your transaction to be processed.

105
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:04,140
And so there are very sound technical reasons why these forks happened, but it just seems

106
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:11,120
that unless Bitcoin itself adopts these changes, these changes are not going to actually be

107
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:14,240
implemented and it's not going to solve the problem.

108
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:18,040
Because Bitcoin is the name you know, and I suppose the people who made these forks

109
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:24,400
hoped that Bitcoin Cash would take over, but it hasn't happened yet and I just can't see

110
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:25,400
it happening.

111
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:26,400
Right.

112
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:30,440
The good news is all this stuff is open source, so it could be brought back in upstream if

113
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:33,520
there was some significant technological improvement.

114
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:38,200
I'm getting to the point though where I wonder if this stuff isn't going to be solved at

115
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:39,200
another layer.

116
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:44,560
Not to go too far into this, but you picture the blockchain and Bitcoin as like layer one

117
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:49,360
and two of the network stack, and there's application layers that could sit on top of

118
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:53,180
that, SQL databases that can process transactions instantly.

119
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:59,600
If you think about Coinbase, one of the largest, most popular ways to buy Bitcoin right now,

120
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:05,760
those transactions are happening off the blockchain, inside a SQL database instantly, and then

121
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:08,000
they sync up to the blockchain.

122
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,800
When you go to a store and you buy something with your credit card here in the States,

123
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:16,600
the Visa network isn't instantly verifying the transaction.

124
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:24,080
They have a 30 day lag, but they solve it at the application layer.

125
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:26,200
And I think that might be true with Bitcoin too.

126
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:32,240
You could build transaction software, your Stripe type services on top of Bitcoin that

127
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:38,840
use off-blockchain backends, like SQL databases, and then synchronize it to the blockchain

128
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:42,200
like Coinbase does or other large Bitcoin exchanges do already.

129
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:46,440
Yeah, I think that is pretty much going to happen, and that's why I think the value is

130
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:51,000
going to continue to rise, and we'll get into that next week when we put some hard numbers

131
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:56,840
on our predictions for Bitcoin.

132
00:08:56,840 --> 00:09:00,160

DigitalOcean.com, promo code, here's the thing.

147
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:58,000
Okay, so by far the biggest news story in the Linux world this year was back in April

148
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:05,160
when Mark Shotworth dropped the bombshell that Ubuntu was abandoning Unity, abandoning

149
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:10,800
the phone, switching back to GNOME, and it was all changed for the Ubuntu project.

150
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:14,960
This is the story of the year that affected me the most personally because unless I was

151
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:18,160
a canonical employee, I couldn't have been more on the front lines.

152
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:23,380
I was sitting at a large conference table with the folks at Dell that all were responsible

153
00:10:23,380 --> 00:10:25,680
for shipping Ubuntu machines.

154
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:29,040
The moment, in fact, I was the one that broke the news to them.

155
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:32,920
By the way, you're no longer going to be shipping Unity and you should have seen their faces.

156
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:36,880
I mean, I couldn't have been in a better room other than Mark Shotworth's office, I suppose,

157
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:43,320
and then I was in New York towards the completion of this journey, watching the team come together,

158
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:47,680
the remaining staff, and the final push towards 1710.

159
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:54,840
So I saw both ends of bewilderment and the homestretch completion, and it really caused

160
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:58,740
a lot of reflection in the whole community, I felt, Joe.

161
00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:00,920
People were asking, where is this going?

162
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:02,020
What does this mean for GNOME?

163
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:06,060
What does this mean for the Plasma desktop now that all these companies are in on GNOME?

164
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:07,320
Is there going to be a huge fork?

165
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:09,200
Is there going to be controversy and fights?

166
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:12,000
There were so many questions, but so few answers.

167
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,440
Yeah, there was a lot of confusion early on in April and May, but then Canonical really

168
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:23,080
upped their communication game, didn't they, with DDA blogging, the desktop progress, and

169
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:26,480
of course the Ubuntu rally that you went to in New York.

170
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:32,960
And a lot of the questions were answered over the six months after the announcement, and

171
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:37,500
for me, I think they were answered in a very positive way.

172
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:40,720
If you look at Ubuntu 1710, it is a solid release.

173
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,040
It wasn't just stock GNOME.

174
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:43,720
It isn't just them abandoning the desktop.

175
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:47,540
They did work on it and refine it and make it their own.

176
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:54,640
So I think a lot of the doubters, myself included, were kind of silenced, really, by the work

177
00:11:54,640 --> 00:12:00,500
that they actually did on it and the release that came out that wasn't what I had expected

178
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:02,440
when I read that announcement, put it that way.

179
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:08,520
And I think they've really set the table for the 1804 release next year, and I think it's

180
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:15,420
going to be, I hope, a pretty polished release of the Linux desktop and maybe the one I eventually

181
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:16,700
switch to.

182
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:21,660
I'm thinking the future is bright for all of us who have been looking for a great workstation

183
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:24,440
operating system to settle down on.

184
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:28,000
More and more really good options are coming along, and I think 1804 is going to be one

185
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
of the better ones.

186
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:33,800
Just wait for one of my predictions on the next episode, and you might end up using something

187
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:34,800
I'm going to predict.

188
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,240
Very good, sir.

189
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:40,200
In the meantime, there's been one story this year that you've kind of been my go-to guy

190
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:42,440
on, what does all of this mean?

191
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:44,760
And it's all of the hoopla around Cyanogenmod.

192
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:50,600
Yeah, so this was technically around this time last year that it started.

193
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:53,840
There had been problems with Cyanogenmod for a long time.

194
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:59,640
I'd noticed in, I think, September of last year that I hadn't had any snapshot updates

195
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:05,020
for Cyanogenmod for a few months, and the writing seemed to be on the wall for them.

196
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:10,680
And then it was right around Christmas that Cyanogenmod's servers got turned off, and

197
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:13,520
a fork appeared, and it became LineageOS.

198
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:18,480
And a lot of the original people who were involved with Cyanogenmod jumped ship over

199
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:23,000
to LineageOS, and I had really high hopes for it at the beginning of the year.

200
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:28,140
I was really hoping that they were going to deliver on a number of devices and keep supporting

201
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:31,120
them with OTAs, and they did.

202
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:33,100
My hopes came true.

203
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:36,000
It's been solid all year long.

204
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:43,920
They're now working on their next version based on Android 8, actually 8.1, and it's

205
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:44,920
been solid.

206
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:49,680
I've been using it all year long on various different Android devices.

207
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:51,920
It's really just a continuation of Cyanogenmod.

208
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:57,080
There have been a few little tweaks here and there, but fundamentally, you've got the same

209
00:13:57,080 --> 00:14:01,400
open source ROM without all the Google bloat.

210
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:05,200
But if, like me, you want to add a bit of that Google bloat back in, you can.

211
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:08,600
But if not, you've got a mostly open source mobile operating system to use.

212
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:10,520
I knew it was going to happen like this.

213
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:16,060
I just know myself at this point, but when they announced LineageOS, I hated the name.

214
00:14:16,060 --> 00:14:17,060
I just hated it.

215
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:19,560
And now here we are in December, I don't mind it at all.

216
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:20,560
No problem.

217
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:21,560
I've totally gotten used to the name.

218
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:26,480
In fact, I'm really excited about the project, very happy that, like you said, it's going

219
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:27,900
in the right direction.

220
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:33,920
But intellectually, I've been finding what's going on over at Yolo almost more interesting.

221
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:41,240
I'm going to end up using LineageOS, but I've been finding that I enjoy the Sailfish X saga

222
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:42,240
much more.

223
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:47,720
Yeah, so Sailfish wasn't looking too good at the beginning of the year, whereas it's

224
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:53,120
had a reasonable year actually with this Sailfish X project, as you mentioned, that is on the

225
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:58,800
Xperia X phone, which is a ROM you can buy from Yolo.

226
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:01,840
And financially, they're still not in great shape.

227
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:07,520
They still owe quite a lot of people for the tablets that they crowdfunded and never delivered.

228
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:09,760
But they have got a revenue stream now.

229
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:14,600
They are developing Sailfish and I want them to succeed.

230
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:21,400
I want them to be more open source, don't get me wrong, but I want there to be at least

231
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:26,400
another operating system for phones that is usable.

232
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:30,680
I heard that sentiment over and over again from the audience over the year, but probably

233
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:34,760
the most poignant moment was when I was in New York, I was talking to a couple of canonical

234
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:39,480
developers who really liked the idea of having a revenue stream to just fund this type of

235
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:43,320
development because they've been through that mobile process now.

236
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:46,800
And I think they ended up ordering the Sailfish X phone.

237
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:52,040
What was it, Joe, is it the Sony Xperia that you could install it on?

238
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:56,760
And I think they ended up pre-purchasing that phone in anticipation of all of this.

239
00:15:56,760 --> 00:16:01,480
And you could see they have palatable excitement about something that's an alternative to Android.

240
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:06,720
Yeah, the Xperia X is the phone, yeah, and I have used Sailfish on various other devices

241
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:12,880
and I must say that of all of the Linux-based alternative mobile operating systems, it's

242
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:13,880
the best.

243
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:19,080
It sounds fairly good, but Sailfish is really solid from what I've seen of it.

244
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:20,320
I completely agree.

245
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:24,640
I really enjoyed it for the limited amount of time that I did run it.

246
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:30,080
The situation on Android could be improving in the near future, the next few years.

247
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:37,720
This year, Google announced Project Treble, the modular base for Android that may actually

248
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:43,920
allow updates to be sent out to consumers to keep them protected, to keep their operating

249
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:44,920
system up to date.

250
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:50,200
It essentially broke out the low-level system architecture of Android and the upper levels.

251
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:57,560
Yeah, so it means that there's a lot less work for the OEMs to put in to keep the ROMs

252
00:16:57,560 --> 00:17:01,120
up to date and to keep the versions of Android up to date.

253
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:08,680
And so in theory, if they deploy this properly, it means that you won't have months and months

254
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:15,000
and months of lag between updates and often with some devices that you buy, there's just

255
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:21,060
no updates or you might get one maybe and then you get these huge security vulnerabilities

256
00:17:21,060 --> 00:17:24,220
coming out and then they're just not patched against that.

257
00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:29,840
So in theory, and I keep saying that because it takes work from the OEMs in the first place

258
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:35,760
to implement this, but in theory, this is really good news going forwards and not only

259
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:41,840
actually for people who want to use the official ROM that comes with the phone, it also makes

260
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:46,480
custom ROM development far easier because there's just less work involved importing

261
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:48,720
ROMs to the device.

262
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:53,680
But if this doesn't solve your Android woes, then maybe the Librem 5 will because this

263
00:17:53,680 --> 00:18:01,920
year on October 11th, 14 days ahead of the deadline, the Librem 5 was fully funded.

264
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:08,760
They reached $1.5 million in crowdfunding for a fully free open source phone with hardware

265
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:09,760
kill switches.

266
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:13,440
Yeah, and I said at the time we need to hire their PR department because they did a brilliant

267
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:15,120
job of promoting this, didn't they?

268
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:18,240
I think they did the best I've ever seen in the open source community.

269
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:22,000
It should be a case study for other projects that want to do a hardware software combo.

270
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:26,720
If you recall, Joe, towards the end of it too, a couple of big whales came in, which

271
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:28,320
that's not necessarily reproducible.

272
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:32,440
Well, yeah, eventually it got pushed over 2 million, didn't it?

273
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:36,560
Thanks to those big whales, as you say, which we still don't know who that was, but maybe

274
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:37,880
we'll find out next year.

275
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:39,720
Yeah, we'll keep following the Librem 5.

276
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:43,940
I'm very interested in that development and I'm sure there'll be more news throughout

277
00:18:43,940 --> 00:18:47,540
2018, but let's talk about Firefox OS for a moment.

278
00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:50,880
The news wasn't so good in 2017 for Firefox OS.

279
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:55,280
Yeah, we kind of saw this one coming that there hadn't been any devices for a while

280
00:18:55,280 --> 00:19:00,420
and there weren't any plans for any, but officially this year Mozilla shut down the Connected

281
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:06,280
Devices Group, which was the department within Mozilla responsible for Firefox OS.

282
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:10,520
So it officially died, but thankfully Mozilla had plenty of other things that they got up

283
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:11,520
to this year.

284
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:16,120
Yeah, it was a bit of a controversial year for them, kicking it off with acquiring Pocket.

285
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:20,400
Yeah, and this came off the back of installing Pocket by default, which ruffled a lot of

286
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,400
feathers.

287
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:25,120
I actually use Pocket all the time for this show and others.

288
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:30,880
It is a very useful service, but I don't know about bundling it by default.

289
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:34,880
But when they acquired Pocket, they promised to open source it and I was really excited

290
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:38,840
about that because an open source client, fantastic.

291
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:41,720
More importantly, an open source server so I can roll my own.

292
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:46,000
That would be exactly what I want because I don't want the adverts.

293
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:50,920
I want to be able to potentially have some bloat stripped out of it.

294
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:56,640
It'd be great to have it on a droplet running and have complete control over it.

295
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:59,280
So come on, Mozilla, what's happening with open sourcing that?

296
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:00,280
Get on with it, please.

297
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:05,140
See, I actually thought you and I were going to have a disagreement about this.

298
00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:07,760
When the whole Pocket thing went down, I was a Chrome user.

299
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:09,080
I was all in on Chrome.

300
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:12,040
I was looking over from afar going, geez, these guys are really getting upset about

301
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:13,040
this.

302
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:17,080
So of course, I had Firefox installed, so I checked it out and I'm like, oh, Pocket,

303
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:18,080
this is a lot like Instapaper.

304
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:20,680
Well, I use the hell out of Instapaper.

305
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:23,080
It seems like a feature you'd want built into your browser.

306
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:26,760
And Apple has shipped it in Safari for a few years now.

307
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:29,280
I'm pretty sure Internet Explorer has something similar.

308
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:32,680
Really, I think Chrome's the only browser that doesn't have this functionality built

309
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:33,680
in.

310
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:37,560
So it got me thinking, well, if Mozilla had just built a Pocket competitor into Firefox,

311
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:39,440
would people have been as upset?

312
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:40,900
I don't think they would have.

313
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:41,960
It is a great app.

314
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:46,600
I think it's a pipe dream that the whole thing's going to be open sourced, especially the back

315
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:47,600
end.

316
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:51,840
Because one of the things that Mozilla touted when they purchased Pocket was this great

317
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:56,960
human recommendation engine on the back end that's curating the best content of Pocket.

318
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:01,720
And there's no way, there's no way they can ship that because that requires a staff.

319
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:06,580
So they're either going to give you some sort of pared down Node.js server application or

320
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:08,200
it's just never going to happen.

321
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:09,200
That's an early prediction.

322
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:12,200
That's a tease for our predictions episode, Joe.

323
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:13,920
Well I'd be happy with a pared down version of it.

324
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:17,600
I have no interest in any of the social stuff and the recommendation.

325
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:20,680
I just want to be able to save links and view them offline.

326
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:21,680
Thank you very much.

327
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:22,680
Fair enough.

328
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:25,820
I think one of their strategies that made a lot of sense to me personally this year

329
00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:28,480
was the introduction of Firefox Focus.

330
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:31,880
This seems to be the way to go after mobile for Mozilla in my opinion.

331
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:35,440
Yeah, I remember trying this out when it first came out and really being impressed with how

332
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:36,440
fast it was.

333
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:42,440
It was definitely the fastest browser I'd ever used on Android, but I remember thinking

334
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:47,000
at the time that it could do with a few more features and those features have been forthcoming,

335
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,400
but I wonder does that somewhat defeat the purpose of it?

336
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:55,220
If you add too much in the way of features, does that make it not as fast and it's kind

337
00:21:55,220 --> 00:21:57,800
of focused on privacy as well.

338
00:21:57,800 --> 00:22:04,560
So I think it remains to be seen how this develops, but it's good that they have got

339
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:09,400
a different approach because it seems that Firefox itself, the main version of the browser

340
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:14,040
is not doing that well on Android compared with Chrome.

341
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:18,480
So they have to try something to stay relevant in the mobile market and it's something that

342
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:21,680
I'm definitely going to keep an eye on throughout 2018 I think.

343
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:26,640
I've always enjoyed the ad tracker counter as a cool little demo to show people how creepy

344
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:32,120
the internet is, but there is an area where Mozilla has had more success and that's Project

345
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:33,120
Common Voice.

346
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:38,080
What I love about Project Common Voice is it just feels like an initiative for the people

347
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:44,200
to make something better on the web in general without a direct benefit from Mozilla.

348
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:47,360
Yeah, this is them doing their public service, isn't it?

349
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:51,760
Collating all of these people's voices, reading the various things that you have to do and

350
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:57,280
also the data of people listening to the voices and confirming whether or not they've transcribed

351
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:58,560
it properly.

352
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:02,120
We need something like this if we're going to compete with what Amazon and Google and

353
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:05,440
Apple have got going with their lady in a tube, as you call them.

354
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:11,080
Yeah, and even just to offer basic speech recognition to websites and open source applications

355
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:16,680
that can't afford nuances, multi-million dollar licensing agreement and all of the data exchange

356
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:17,680
required.

357
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:21,240
That's why I think this is one of Mozilla's power spots, like they're in the power stroke

358
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:22,860
with this particular project.

359
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:25,720
They also really nailed the Firefox Quantum release this year.

360
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:30,760
Yeah, I've seen nothing but universal praise for this release and for me it's just something

361
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:36,400
that got upgraded on Ubuntu and I was just using it as a matter of course, and it's definitely

362
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:39,600
faster than the previous versions of Firefox.

363
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:44,060
I think some people have a little bit over-egg the pudding on how much faster and better

364
00:23:44,060 --> 00:23:48,280
it is and they changed the layout a little bit, which I didn't like at first, but I've

365
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:52,480
got used to now, but it is definitely a huge step forward for them.

366
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:57,800
They need to stay competitive with Chrome if they've got any chance and I don't know,

367
00:23:57,800 --> 00:24:01,080
do you think they really have got any chance of winning back market share from Chrome at

368
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:02,080
this point?

369
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:05,100
I mean, I'm not sure they've won back market share from me.

370
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:10,620
It's enough of a cumulative improvement that I find it launches faster, I find it loads

371
00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:16,300
web pages at least as fast, if not maybe slightly faster, and I would say maybe what it actually

372
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:19,480
is is the order in which it loads the web page, I prefer.

373
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:22,600
That's what we're getting down to now, is how the web page is rendered on my screen.

374
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:26,360
I like the way Firefox is doing it better than the way Chrome is doing it now as it's

375
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:31,240
loading, but it also seems to do it without putting as much of a drag on my system, which

376
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:35,320
I also really like because it leaves resources available for other applications.

377
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:39,800
I'm pretty happy with it and I'm one of those fools who likes the new UI because I've heard

378
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:43,000
a lot of people complain about it, but I think it's pretty great.

379
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:47,740
That and all the other improvements they've baked into it, it's become my daily driver.

380
00:24:47,740 --> 00:24:50,100
But they're not without their controversies this year too.

381
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:54,800
In fact, going into 2018, I think Mozilla might be one of the companies that's embroiled

382
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:56,600
in some of the biggest controversies.

383
00:24:56,600 --> 00:25:02,600
Yeah, the lawsuit with Yahoo, which stems from a deal that they did to become the default

384
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:08,260
search provider, which would net them over a billion dollars, but had a clause in it

385
00:25:08,260 --> 00:25:13,320
that said, if Yahoo is sold, then Mozilla can walk away from the deal, keep the money

386
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:15,360
and change the default search provider.

387
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:19,280
Well, Yahoo was sold, as we know, to Verizon.

388
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:24,200
They changed their default search back to Google and intend to keep the money.

389
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:28,680
And Yahoo, or Oath as they become, and Yahoo Holdings, are having none of it.

390
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:31,640
And they want their money back and they don't want to pay any more money.

391
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:35,240
And so they're trying to weasel out of this deal.

392
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:39,520
And neither of us are lawyers, but I'm fairly confident that Mozilla are going to get away

393
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:42,040
with this and get to keep the money and keep making it rain.

394
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:46,240
Yeah, if I was a betting man, I would bet this is going to work out OK for Mozilla.

395
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:52,220
I'm not so sure how this whole Mr. Robot looking glass add-on situation is going to go.

396
00:25:52,220 --> 00:25:56,080
They're at least going to spend the first half of 2018 digging themselves out of this

397
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:57,080
hole.

398
00:25:57,080 --> 00:25:59,720
Yeah, so much squandered goodwill.

399
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:05,640
Just when they were coming off the high of Firefox 57 Quantum, they go and do this at

400
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:10,320
the end of the year and push an extension to people's browsers without them even knowing

401
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:11,320
about it.

402
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:16,040
And it's some confusing thing about Mr. Robot that hardly anyone even knows about.

403
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:18,140
I can't believe they've made this mistake.

404
00:26:18,140 --> 00:26:20,360
And I hope that people get fired over this.

405
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:24,080
It's not good when people lose their jobs, but it's also not good when they damage the

406
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:27,000
reputation of a major open source project.

407
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:31,540
Yeah, I hope there's some reflection in the upper levels of Mozilla.

408
00:26:31,540 --> 00:26:35,040
It's been a good year overall for them, though, so hopefully they still have some goodwill

409
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:36,040
to cash in.

410
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:42,260
I debated dropping Firefox after the extension fiasco, but if I'm being honest, I think I

411
00:26:42,260 --> 00:26:45,760
still trust Mozilla more than I trust Chrome.

412
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:51,040
And I like the advances in Firefox this last year, and I think they're on a good trajectory

413
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:54,000
for 2018 with Firefox specifically.

414
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,560
So I'm just going to keep an eye on it, and we'll keep reporting on what happens here

415
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:57,560
