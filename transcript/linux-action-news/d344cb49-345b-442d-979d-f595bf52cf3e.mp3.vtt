00:00.000 --> 00:08.560
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, episode 152, recorded on April 5th, 2020.

00:08.560 --> 00:09.560
I'm Chris.

00:09.560 --> 00:10.560
And I'm Joe.

00:10.560 --> 00:11.560
Hello, Joe.

00:11.560 --> 00:16.200
Good to be connected with you, and great to start with the news of Linux kernel 5.6.

00:16.200 --> 00:19.600
It's released, and it's packed full of goodies.

00:19.600 --> 00:23.600
The biggest one is WireGuard, finally, it's in the kernel.

00:23.600 --> 00:26.360
We've been talking about WireGuard for years, and for good reason.

00:26.360 --> 00:28.720
It is a great VPN.

00:28.720 --> 00:30.120
We'll get to that in just a second.

00:30.120 --> 00:34.300
I'll first mention that the other thing I noticed that landed in this was initial support

00:34.300 --> 00:40.120
for USB4, which was contributed by Intel, and is based on their Thunderbolt driver code.

00:40.120 --> 00:42.940
This also, for 32-bit users, has some good news.

00:42.940 --> 00:48.560
It's the first kernel that is ready to operate past the year 2038, if you're in 32-bit mode.

00:48.560 --> 00:53.360
There's good fixes in there for AMD and NVIDIA graphics stacks, as well as, and you're gonna

00:53.360 --> 00:58.960
really appreciate this one, Joe, mainline support for the Amazon Echo smart speaker.

00:58.960 --> 01:06.240
I saw that, and I was very surprised by it, because who's running Linux on their Echo

01:06.240 --> 01:08.360
smart speaker?

01:08.360 --> 01:09.360
Nobody yet.

01:09.360 --> 01:13.720
But, I mean, picture a world where Mycroft has developed a little bit further, and now

01:13.720 --> 01:18.160
people could repurpose their first and second generation, or whatever it might be, generation

01:18.160 --> 01:22.160
Echo hardware, flash it with Linux, and install a Mycroft service on there, and now you got

01:22.160 --> 01:23.480
a Mycroft tube.

01:23.480 --> 01:25.120
I'd be down for that.

01:25.120 --> 01:27.280
Are they even flashable, though?

01:27.280 --> 01:30.760
Not yet, but they're getting there.

01:30.760 --> 01:33.600
I'm not sure how far you really would want to take this thing yet, because eventually

01:33.600 --> 01:37.640
you also have to get the Wi-Fi working, and they don't have full microphone array support

01:37.640 --> 01:38.640
at this point.

01:38.640 --> 01:41.440
They have a single mic, and to make this thing really effective, you want the microphone

01:41.440 --> 01:42.840
array.

01:42.840 --> 01:48.040
I would say it's at least a decent idea, and I'm also always a fan of just getting Linux

01:48.040 --> 01:49.340
on all of the things.

01:49.340 --> 01:53.600
If it doesn't require a lot of kernel bloat, if it isn't a massive amount of effort, if

01:53.600 --> 01:57.760
it's not some crazy architecture they have to maintain forever now, I'm kind of a fan

01:57.760 --> 01:58.760
of going for it.

01:58.760 --> 01:59.760
Yeah, I suppose so.

01:59.760 --> 02:03.440
Even if it's not Mycroft you're running on it, maybe you could use it with Home Assistant

02:03.440 --> 02:06.520
or something like that, if it's running its own proper Linux OS.

02:06.520 --> 02:08.960
But you really did mention the big story.

02:08.960 --> 02:12.800
The lead for kernel 5.6 is the death of OpenVPN.

02:12.800 --> 02:17.120
I kid, but really WireGuard is so great, and I'm a big fan.

02:17.120 --> 02:21.200
Jason Donfield has created something that is remarkable.

02:21.200 --> 02:23.480
Version 1.0 is stable.

02:23.480 --> 02:28.620
It has been stable for a while, but even more so, it's been recently reviewed professionally

02:28.620 --> 02:36.080
to check to see if there's anything misconfigured or improperly developed or designed.

02:36.080 --> 02:42.560
And the lead developer, Jason Donfield, commissioned that code base audit in anticipation of it

02:42.560 --> 02:43.560
being included in 5.6.

02:43.560 --> 02:48.820
In fact, he writes, I've been neurotic about having the 5.6 kernel ship without any show

02:48.820 --> 02:50.080
stopper bugs.

02:50.080 --> 02:54.760
WireGuard has been stable for a long time now, but that doesn't make me any less nervous

02:54.760 --> 02:57.060
about the real deal in 5.6.

02:57.060 --> 03:02.040
To that end, I've been doing code reviews and having discussions, and we've also had

03:02.040 --> 03:04.620
a security firm audit the code.

03:04.620 --> 03:09.480
The audit didn't turn up any vulnerabilities, but they did make a good defense in depth

03:09.480 --> 03:10.880
suggestion.

03:10.880 --> 03:15.280
Jim Salter on Ars Technica has a really good write-up of the new release, and I will also

03:15.280 --> 03:17.720
link in his introduction guide.

03:17.720 --> 03:22.080
If you've heard us talk about WireGuard, you haven't wrapped your head around it yet, Jim's

03:22.080 --> 03:23.080
got a good piece on that, too.

03:23.080 --> 03:26.880
Well, if you're crazy enough to run an Arch server, then you're going to be able to take

03:26.880 --> 03:32.960
advantage of this, and no doubt you will be sorting that out with Wes soon, but realistically,

03:32.960 --> 03:37.260
is anyone going to be able to use this kernel in an enterprise distro anytime soon?

03:37.260 --> 03:38.640
There is that aspect of it.

03:38.640 --> 03:42.600
Some great new feature hits the main line Linux kernel, but then it's really a wait

03:42.600 --> 03:46.440
around and see how long it takes until it's implemented at the distro level.

03:46.440 --> 03:49.480
That is true with the exception of Ubuntu 20.04.

03:49.480 --> 03:54.080
I believe Canonical released a statement saying that they would backport WireGuard to the

03:54.080 --> 04:00.360
5.4 kernel they're using, and to that end, there is a WireGuard-Linux-CompatCode branch,

04:00.360 --> 04:04.260
which will continue to be maintained so that the WireGuard kernel module can still be deployed

04:04.260 --> 04:05.800
to older kernels.

04:05.800 --> 04:11.720
So it is still retrofittable, and it's easily solvable with a DKMS-style solution.

04:11.720 --> 04:16.160
But as you know, it takes a while to go the DKMS route.

04:16.160 --> 04:19.040
Every update is quite a painfully long experience.

04:19.040 --> 04:22.760
Yeah, that's why it will be great to just have it baked in upstream.

04:22.760 --> 04:26.400
It will take a little bit for the mainline distros to get it, but certain areas will

04:26.400 --> 04:30.240
get it soon, and I think the big part that we'll start to see now that it's actually

04:30.240 --> 04:33.120
in the kernel is cool projects built around it.

04:33.120 --> 04:36.800
There's already a whole bunch that are getting created now, but you'll start to see a bunch

04:36.800 --> 04:41.920
of more GUIs that can sit on top of the WireGuard tools, and I would hope, integration with

04:41.920 --> 04:46.760
a lot of edge products, like your PFsenses and things like that out there.

04:46.760 --> 04:48.640
Plug for OpenSense, by the way.

04:48.640 --> 04:54.520
But with 5.6 released, that means that 5.7 is now in the works, and something coming

04:54.520 --> 04:58.000
to that is going to be the exFAT driver.

04:58.000 --> 04:59.560
This is the one we've been waiting for.

04:59.560 --> 05:05.080
This is the specially Samsung-developed exFAT file system driver that's landing in kernel

05:05.080 --> 05:06.080
5.7.

05:06.080 --> 05:11.760
Now, if you recall, there was sort of a temporary read-only kind of sketch version that was

05:11.760 --> 05:13.840
added in Linux 5.4.

05:13.840 --> 05:15.600
That's going to be swapped out now.

05:15.600 --> 05:21.640
So by the time I'm using Xubuntu 22.04 in about three years, it means I'll be able to

05:21.640 --> 05:28.320
plug my exFAT-formatted SD cards in and not have to install exFAT Utils and exFAT Fuse.

05:28.320 --> 05:31.000
Boy, future Joe's just going to love that.

05:31.000 --> 05:34.240
When you put it that way, it's almost silly.

05:34.240 --> 05:38.880
These things take a while, but I'm sure if you've got a Manjaro machine, it'll be a lot

05:38.880 --> 05:39.880
sooner than that.

05:39.880 --> 05:40.880
Yeah.

05:40.880 --> 05:44.760
You could always run, you could go wild and just run one of them interim releases, you

05:44.760 --> 05:45.760
know?

05:45.760 --> 05:46.760
Throw caution to the wind, Joe.

05:46.760 --> 05:49.320
No, I would not do that, I'm afraid.

05:49.320 --> 05:52.520
I might test them, but I'm far too sensible for that.

05:52.520 --> 05:57.440
Meanwhile, you're talking to a guy who's running the 20.04 dailies right now, and I'm beta testing,

05:57.440 --> 06:02.000
I'm trying out the new beta for Fedora as well in a VM because, you know, why not?

06:02.000 --> 06:07.440
Well, if you want to check out a beta of Ubuntu Touch, now you can buy a phone with it pre-installed.

06:07.440 --> 06:10.560
Not just any phone, a PinePhone, a UBports Community Edition.

06:10.560 --> 06:12.480
The pre-orders are open right now.

06:12.480 --> 06:17.460
It's a PinePhone as you know it, but this one will not only come pre-loaded with an Ubuntu

06:17.460 --> 06:22.680
Touch image, but also a special limited edition Ubuntu Touch back, which is actually kind

06:22.680 --> 06:23.680
of cool.

06:23.680 --> 06:28.040
Starting on this port, they say in the announcement for essentially 18 months, from the first

06:28.040 --> 06:30.680
leggy builds to actually something semi-usable.

06:30.680 --> 06:36.820
I don't know if it's quite in the daily driver category yet, but it's improving very quick.

06:36.820 --> 06:40.240
And of course, with the PinePhone, you could run anything you could load on there.

06:40.240 --> 06:44.400
So this would just be one of the many options you'd have, and hopefully one of the better

06:44.400 --> 06:45.400
ones.

06:45.400 --> 06:52.220
So this is available for $150 plus shipping, and also potentially import charges and taxes

06:52.220 --> 06:53.220
and things.

06:53.220 --> 06:54.220
So watch out for that.

06:54.220 --> 07:00.720
But of that $150, $10 will be going to the Ubiports Foundation, which is pretty cool.

07:00.720 --> 07:03.880
And my understanding is, there's no reason if I have a Braveheart Edition phone like

07:03.880 --> 07:09.880
the one I have here, I could flash it with Ubiports Ubuntu Touch, and it would work fine,

07:09.880 --> 07:10.880
right?

07:10.880 --> 07:12.400
There's no incompatibilities there?

07:12.400 --> 07:14.560
No, this is a slightly revved version.

07:14.560 --> 07:19.080
The motherboard's slightly different, and there's a few small improvements, but as far

07:19.080 --> 07:21.800
as I understand it, they are just the same phone.

07:21.800 --> 07:27.520
So you can just download an Ubuntu Touch image, flash it on an SD card and boot it up, and

07:27.520 --> 07:29.560
you'll have more or less the same experience.

07:29.560 --> 07:33.000
I want to see more distributions available for phones like this, especially as hardware

07:33.000 --> 07:35.040
like the PinePhone becomes available.

07:35.040 --> 07:36.040
I do want to set expectations.

07:36.040 --> 07:37.360
You know, it's not perfect.

07:37.360 --> 07:39.100
Like I said, it's not daily driver yet.

07:39.100 --> 07:44.360
And I think the builds that will be released on the phone hardware likely won't have camera

07:44.360 --> 07:46.320
support, but I think that's not too far away.

07:46.320 --> 07:50.040
I think they have a camera fix coming soon, from what I've seen on Twitter.

07:50.040 --> 07:52.200
So I'd say keep your expectations set accordingly.

07:52.200 --> 07:57.160
But it's a great device to play around with, and 150 bucks for something like this is remarkable.

07:57.160 --> 08:00.800
And mine, you know, my Braveheart Edition, which is an early build, admittedly, feels

08:00.800 --> 08:02.580
really solid in the hand.

08:02.580 --> 08:03.580
Feels like a real device.

08:03.580 --> 08:05.500
Yeah, it is a real phone.

08:05.500 --> 08:09.880
It's a proper device, but it's not the only phone that you'll be able to get Ubuntu Touch

08:09.880 --> 08:12.960
pre-installed on, at least at some point in the future.

08:12.960 --> 08:17.700
Yeah, it was sort of buried in all the other news, but they did announce a partnership

08:17.700 --> 08:19.880
with the German phone startup, Vala.

08:19.880 --> 08:24.000
They write on their blog they're joining forces as a sponsor and will have a place on the

08:24.000 --> 08:25.260
advisory board.

08:25.260 --> 08:29.640
They expect that Ubuntu Touch will be available as a pre-installed option on the new Vala

08:29.640 --> 08:30.640
phone.

08:30.640 --> 08:31.640
How about that?

08:31.640 --> 08:34.520
Just when you thought the world had moved on and we were going to be locked into Android

08:34.520 --> 08:36.920
and iOS forever.

08:36.920 --> 08:40.640
Projects like the PinePhone come along and do what Purism never could.

08:40.640 --> 08:46.360
And projects like UbiPorts continue to prove that if they just keep working at it over

08:46.360 --> 08:50.720
time, they get it better and better and the hardware is coming to a certain point and

08:50.720 --> 08:53.880
the software is coming to a certain point and they are meeting up at this juncture.

08:53.880 --> 08:56.880
And it's remarkable to actually see it still continue on.

08:56.880 --> 08:59.200
I think it's still in the realm of hobbyists.

08:59.200 --> 09:00.560
And I don't think there's anything wrong with that.

09:00.560 --> 09:01.560
There should be.

09:01.560 --> 09:02.640
There should be hobbyist devices.

09:02.640 --> 09:06.760
These mobile devices are an absolutely critical part of the computing ecosystem.

09:06.760 --> 09:09.940
And I think it's really important that we have an option for hobbyists because that's

09:09.940 --> 09:11.240
how we learn and push the boundaries.

09:11.240 --> 09:17.120
Yeah, I think that it's going to be a while, if ever, before these kind of OSes and phones

09:17.120 --> 09:18.920
replace people's main phones.

09:18.920 --> 09:25.120
But I think there are some people who can get by with a relatively limited feature set.

09:25.120 --> 09:30.200
And then there are other people who will have this as a second phone to play around with

09:30.200 --> 09:32.360
and help improve.

09:32.360 --> 09:36.180
I think that's the key thing here that we're still in this testing phase.

09:36.180 --> 09:39.800
This is not about competing with Android and iOS necessarily.

09:39.800 --> 09:45.400
It's about finding a niche that is separate from those two, which is the same kind of

09:45.400 --> 09:48.580
niche where custom ROMs like Lineage sit.

09:48.580 --> 09:50.200
They're going all the way to 17.1.

09:50.200 --> 09:51.800
And that's actually part of the big news.

09:51.800 --> 09:58.060
The Lineage OS 17.1, based on Android 10, is now officially available.

09:58.060 --> 10:02.320
It seems AOSP threw them a few curveballs throughout the development of 17.1.

10:02.320 --> 10:07.000
Yeah, and this isn't available for all of the officially supported phones yet, although

10:07.000 --> 10:13.360
it is available for mine, but I haven't flushed it yet because that takes half a day at least

10:13.360 --> 10:15.560
of setting everything back up again.

10:15.560 --> 10:18.760
But yeah, this was a slightly longer development cycle for them.

10:18.760 --> 10:25.920
And the reason that it's 17.1 is because they had started work on 17.0, but then they rebased

10:25.920 --> 10:30.760
on the Google Pixel 4 branch of Android on Source Project.

10:30.760 --> 10:35.760
And so they decided that it made sense to rev it to 17.1.

10:35.760 --> 10:40.160
This release also is making the switch to Lineage Recovery as a de facto solution for

10:40.160 --> 10:41.920
actually installing the OS.

10:41.920 --> 10:46.560
And they've also introduced Permissions Hub, which conflicted with Privacy Guard, so that

10:46.560 --> 10:48.480
has had to be dropped.

10:48.480 --> 10:54.620
And also, instead of offering official super user binaries that you could flash, now if

10:54.620 --> 10:58.120
you want root, you have to go the Magisk root.

10:58.120 --> 11:01.920
Now I'm not a Lineage user, Joe, so correct me if I'm wrong, but my understanding is there's

11:01.920 --> 11:06.360
essentially a downside that you can still root, but you can't really hide the fact that

11:06.360 --> 11:08.040
you're rooted in this new system.

11:08.040 --> 11:12.000
Yeah, it's kind of hit and miss with Magisk, depending on the device, as to whether you

11:12.000 --> 11:15.880
can hide the fact that you're rooted and that your bootloader is unlocked.

11:15.880 --> 11:19.440
But you could never do that with the old routing method anyway.

11:19.440 --> 11:20.980
It was just a lot simpler.

11:20.980 --> 11:24.920
It was just instead of having to interact with Magisk, you just flash this root binary

11:24.920 --> 11:28.880
and if you didn't care about hiding it, then it was just simpler.

11:28.880 --> 11:29.960
And that's what I always did.

11:29.960 --> 11:35.440
So now I'm going to have to use Magisk, which I'm not particularly bothered about, but it's

11:35.440 --> 11:36.440
just a bit of difference.

11:36.440 --> 11:37.880
You know, I don't like change.

11:37.880 --> 11:39.480
I guess, yeah, that's true.

11:39.480 --> 11:43.480
But I guess I think about LineageOS and I think, man, it's awesome that it's going so

11:43.480 --> 11:49.740
strong and that they took the time to integrate security fixes and do proper rebasing so that

11:49.740 --> 11:54.240
when they did ship, it was in a really good state.

11:54.240 --> 12:00.160
But I also still feel like I've been watching the walls close in on the custom ROM community

12:00.160 --> 12:05.240
for years and it just seems like it's getting tighter and tighter and tighter and it's very

12:05.240 --> 12:07.560
much the boiling frog type approach.

12:07.560 --> 12:11.200
It doesn't seem to be that they're startling anyone very fast, but as hardware changes

12:11.200 --> 12:15.800
and security requirements ramp up and Google makes architecture changes to Android, then

12:15.800 --> 12:21.300
security changes that are paired with hardware features, it to me just seems like the walls

12:21.300 --> 12:22.760
are getting in pretty tight now.

12:22.760 --> 12:26.600
The oxygen, as they say, is almost out of the room and I can't think of another metaphor

12:26.600 --> 12:29.160
I could throw in there, but I think you get where I'm going.

12:29.160 --> 12:30.760
Yeah, I think you're right though.

12:30.760 --> 12:37.720
I think that in another five, 10 years maybe, things like Lineage won't be possible on most

12:37.720 --> 12:38.720
phones.

12:38.720 --> 12:44.320
I think that it'll still probably be around for legacy devices that are out of support,

12:44.320 --> 12:49.200
but the newer phones that come along, well, they're just getting more and more locked

12:49.200 --> 12:50.200
down, as you say.

12:50.200 --> 12:56.560
I don't think that that is Google and OEMs necessarily wanting to make the custom ROM

12:56.560 --> 12:57.840
scene go away.

12:57.840 --> 13:01.760
It's just them not caring about it and just caring more about these security features,

13:01.760 --> 13:07.080
which ultimately close down the platform even more, which is sad.

13:07.080 --> 13:12.040
It's good that we've got projects like the PinePhone which are open, but that's not exactly

13:12.040 --> 13:13.040
flagship hardware.

13:13.040 --> 13:14.400
It's a $150 phone.

13:14.400 --> 13:18.540
It's low-end and I think you're right that ultimately you're going to either have the

13:18.540 --> 13:23.920
hobbyist phones or you'll just have to use whatever ROM it comes with, which is sad.

13:23.920 --> 13:24.920
It's sad.

13:24.920 --> 13:28.240
It's always been a little bit like Linux, hasn't it?

13:28.240 --> 13:34.160
In that you can buy a PC, a laptop or whatever, and just install whatever distro you want

13:34.160 --> 13:38.440
on it, whereas with mobile hardware, with iPhones it's always been the case, but with

13:38.440 --> 13:43.400
Android phones, at least some of them, like the Nexus phones or whatever, were fully

13:43.400 --> 13:49.600
supported by these ROMs and Google made it easy for projects like Lineage to get their

13:49.600 --> 13:54.840
ROMs going on there, whereas now that seems to be a thing of the past.

13:54.840 --> 13:57.480
That's the line of thinking I had with this as well.

13:57.480 --> 14:01.600
I also thought it just underscores the importance of things like the PinePhone.

14:01.600 --> 14:06.960
It seems though like the PinePhone is developing at a rate faster than I expected and the software

14:06.960 --> 14:09.960
around it is developing at a rate faster than I expected.

14:09.960 --> 14:13.700
Maybe I came out a little cynical at this point because I've seen these phone attempts

14:13.700 --> 14:20.760
so many times now, but it does give me hope that Lineage maybe, Lineage on that thing,

14:20.760 --> 14:24.360
Ubuntu Touch on there, Mangero Mobile Edition on there.

14:24.360 --> 14:28.960
I know that there's even conversations around the Fedora project to get parts of Fedora

14:28.960 --> 14:30.300
working on the PinePhone.

14:30.300 --> 14:35.480
It's happening and it's happening faster than I expected because really we're only like

14:35.480 --> 14:39.240
1.5 hardware iterations into the PinePhone right now.

14:39.240 --> 14:44.320
Yeah, you would assume that there will be newer, more powerful versions in the future

14:44.320 --> 14:49.200
because it looks like it's being relatively successful within the niche that we're talking

14:49.200 --> 14:50.560
about here.

14:50.560 --> 14:57.360
I'm really hoping that is going to be something that continues because I think if you're a

14:57.360 --> 15:04.440
hardware company like Pine64 that just puts their hands up and says, we're not here to

15:04.440 --> 15:09.000
make software, we're not going to pay a whole team of developers, but we're going to help

15:09.000 --> 15:14.200
you, we're going to work with you, the community, to make these ROMs happen.

15:14.200 --> 15:17.240
That seems to be the right approach to it to me.

15:17.240 --> 15:21.520
The market seems to have shown us this approach, I mean it's not directly comparable, but it

15:21.520 --> 15:25.740
seems similar to the way PC manufacturers over the years operated.

15:25.740 --> 15:29.560
They didn't create Windows or they didn't create the Linux distro they installed on

15:29.560 --> 15:31.120
there typically.

15:31.120 --> 15:35.960
Traditionally they would create hardware, they'd work with Microsoft to create drivers

15:35.960 --> 15:39.200
and then they would ship that and support that and they would focus on the hardware

15:39.200 --> 15:42.280
and Microsoft would focus on the software.

15:42.280 --> 15:46.040
Those lines of course have all been blurred now because Microsoft has hardware and there's

15:46.040 --> 15:51.180
Linux distros that are created by the OEMs directly and you know, it's all blurred now,

15:51.180 --> 15:55.880
but it does seem to have been a model that was successful for a long time and made guys

15:55.880 --> 16:02.040
like Michael Dell very rich and there's still a huge market in there in that business model

16:02.040 --> 16:07.120
and I could see it applying to the PinePhone, especially if the enthusiast market continues

16:07.120 --> 16:15.640
to grow and operating systems like Lineage, imagine a scenario Joe, imagine Lineage having

16:15.640 --> 16:19.960
top performance like best hardware support, best apps.

16:19.960 --> 16:24.800
You could put a Lineage image on the PinePhone and it just rocked everything.

16:24.800 --> 16:29.660
I would do that, I would do that in a heartbeat and I would probably be the first time I became

16:29.660 --> 16:32.080
a regular user of Lineage OS.

16:32.080 --> 16:36.300
Not because I have any problem against it, it's just if I spend a lot of money on a thousand

16:36.300 --> 16:39.920
dollar Android device, I want it to be fully supported and I'm going to run the software

16:39.920 --> 16:41.880
they put on there because it better well damn be good.

16:41.880 --> 16:43.380
Yeah, I know what you mean.

16:43.380 --> 16:49.560
My installation, Lineage 16 on my OnePlus 3T is pretty broken right now to the point

16:49.560 --> 16:53.620
where often when I get a notification, I swipe down and then I click on it, say it's a Telegram

16:53.620 --> 16:59.520
message and then I just get a black screen and I have to then kill Telegram or whatever

16:59.520 --> 17:01.280
and restart the app to get it.

17:01.280 --> 17:06.620
It's in a terrible state and you know, that's because I've done all sorts to it probably

17:06.620 --> 17:12.560
and that's why when I do this 17.1 update, I'm just going to do wipe and completely start

17:12.560 --> 17:15.520
again and hopefully not have these problems.

17:15.520 --> 17:19.320
And yeah, Lineage in my experience is a little bit buggy and according to Poppy, he tried

17:19.320 --> 17:23.620
Lineage on the 3T and said it was slower than the official ROM, but I've never tried the

17:23.620 --> 17:24.620
official ROM.

17:24.620 --> 17:25.920
The first thing I did was wipe it when I got it.

17:25.920 --> 17:28.700
So I don't know, but I do see what you mean.

17:28.700 --> 17:32.960
As for Lineage on the PinePhone, there's no reason why it couldn't happen, but as far

17:32.960 --> 17:36.980
as I know, there are no Android ROMs available because the point of the project was that

17:36.980 --> 17:40.560
it was proper GNU slash Linux operating systems.

17:40.560 --> 17:43.540
So I don't think there's been a huge push to put Android on it.

17:43.540 --> 17:45.660
I'd love to check it out.

17:45.660 --> 17:50.760
So if anyone does know of an Android ROM that I can flash on the PinePhone, then do let

17:50.760 --> 17:51.760
me know.

17:51.760 --> 17:53.640
But I think that hasn't happened yet.

17:53.640 --> 17:54.640
Yeah, fair enough.

17:54.640 --> 17:55.640
That makes sense.

17:55.640 --> 17:58.800
And I think if something like the PinePhone is successful, I'd like to be able to run

17:58.800 --> 18:00.280
any OS I want on there.

18:00.280 --> 18:05.560
And because the hardware is reasonable and documented and easy for projects to get their

18:05.560 --> 18:08.560
hands on, it seems like it could actually happen.

18:08.560 --> 18:12.640
And maybe the big news out of Huawei this week accelerates some of this.

18:12.640 --> 18:17.060
Yeah, Huawei have joined the Open Invention Network, which is essentially an organization

18:17.060 --> 18:21.920
that lets companies join and cross-license their patents royalty-free, patents of course

18:21.920 --> 18:25.720
to do with the Linux system, whatever that exactly means.

18:25.720 --> 18:29.240
Yeah, the definition, which is something that changes from time to time.

18:29.240 --> 18:34.240
It was actually adjusted when Microsoft joined back in October of 2018.

18:34.240 --> 18:35.840
That's how long ago that was.

18:35.840 --> 18:39.040
No, that was only a couple of months ago, wasn't it?

18:39.040 --> 18:40.120
No, no, no.

18:40.120 --> 18:41.120
I thought so too.

18:41.120 --> 18:43.960
In fact, I wasn't even sure if it was this year, or if it was maybe late last year.

18:43.960 --> 18:48.400
Looked it up and Nat Friedman announced it in October of 2018.

18:48.400 --> 18:49.400
Pretty wild.

18:49.400 --> 18:54.640
Huawei joining is a big deal because not only do they agree to cross-license their patents,

18:54.640 --> 18:59.680
but they also agree that they won't assert any patent infringement against each other.

18:59.680 --> 19:03.820
And Huawei has a huge portfolio, as you might imagine.

19:03.820 --> 19:10.080
The Open Invention Network, OIN's CEO, told The Register in an interview that he was,

19:10.080 --> 19:11.320
quote, delighted.

19:11.320 --> 19:16.080
It's probably one of the top five companies that we've been chasing for quite some time.

19:16.080 --> 19:19.360
I think my first conversations with Huawei were nine years ago.

19:19.360 --> 19:21.280
Back then, they weren't doing that much in open source.

19:21.280 --> 19:25.180
But in the last six and a half years, they've become very committed to open source and a

19:25.180 --> 19:29.960
very active member of the board of the Linux Foundation.

19:29.960 --> 19:35.640
They go on to say, Joe, as far as equipment suppliers go, Huawei has been a model.

19:35.640 --> 19:39.720
Now, I'm just blown away by this because of the political situation where companies in

19:39.720 --> 19:44.340
the U.S. are not permitted to work with Huawei, but this sort of seems like a backdoor way

19:44.340 --> 19:45.340
to do it.

19:45.340 --> 19:49.760
Yeah, because with Huawei's Android phones, they're not allowed to ship any of the Google

19:49.760 --> 19:54.580
proprietary stuff, but they are allowed to base it on Android open source.

19:54.580 --> 19:58.880
So it kind of makes sense that they want to get more heavily involved in the open source

19:58.880 --> 20:03.820
side of things because even from a PR point of view, it's a good move.

20:03.820 --> 20:06.660
And there'll probably be practical benefits as well.

20:06.660 --> 20:11.360
We also know they're making big investments in their Harmony OS and in their IoT arm.

20:11.360 --> 20:13.000
So that will be really interesting.

20:13.000 --> 20:15.120
Plus they're a big arm shop.

20:15.120 --> 20:18.780
They have very sophisticated camera assemblies, all of this.

20:18.780 --> 20:19.780
It could have very big implications.

20:19.780 --> 20:24.400
And you also wonder if there's some patent suits now that are going to get upended, perhaps

20:24.400 --> 20:25.400
canceled.

20:25.400 --> 20:29.380
Yeah, you have to wonder what's going to happen with the Verizon suit that they filed.

20:29.380 --> 20:31.240
Maybe they might back out of that.

20:31.240 --> 20:38.160
The OIN CEO added in their quote, it's important that open source software cuts across geopolitical

20:38.160 --> 20:39.160
boundaries.

20:39.160 --> 20:40.160
I kind of agree.

20:40.160 --> 20:44.540
I like that they weren't, I don't know if the right word is to say like scared out of

20:44.540 --> 20:48.080
doing this, but that they were brave enough to go forward even given the political situation

20:48.080 --> 20:50.520
because it's undoubtedly a massive contribution.

20:50.520 --> 20:51.840
Yeah, you never know.

20:51.840 --> 20:55.680
Maybe the likes of Amazon and Samsung might join as well.

20:55.680 --> 20:57.960
It's certainly what the OIN wants.

20:57.960 --> 21:02.600
They worry about giant corporations like Samsung and Amazon joining their network.

21:02.600 --> 21:07.480
I worry about possibly never receiving my Atari VCS console.

21:07.480 --> 21:09.240
This has been quite the saga, hasn't it?

21:09.240 --> 21:11.000
How long ago was it that you backed this thing?

21:11.000 --> 21:12.000
I was wondering.

21:12.000 --> 21:13.000
I was going to look it up.

21:13.000 --> 21:16.800
I'm not positive, but I think it was 227 years ago.

21:16.800 --> 21:25.600
I think it was what, summer of 2018 and it was supposed to ship in summer of 2019.

21:25.600 --> 21:29.560
And I don't know about you, but it's getting pretty warm in London.

21:29.560 --> 21:33.480
Feels like summer 2020 to me and you still don't have it.

21:33.480 --> 21:36.040
I'm starting to wonder if I'll ever get it.

21:36.040 --> 21:40.640
The Xbox co-creator, Rob Wyatt, we've talked about him before and his company Tin Giant

21:40.640 --> 21:45.000
is now suing Atari because he says that they owe him more than $261,000.

21:45.000 --> 21:51.880
Yeah, he's alleging breach of contract and defamation from them saying that he never

21:51.880 --> 21:54.720
did the work properly and that's why they didn't pay him.

21:54.720 --> 22:00.480
So even if Atari wins this, it's going to probably take quite a long time and cost quite

22:00.480 --> 22:02.440
a lot of money.

22:02.440 --> 22:05.080
And so you assume that's going to delay things a little bit.

22:05.080 --> 22:11.360
They do say that they've got a number of them ready to go, but obviously all of the supply

22:11.360 --> 22:16.600
chain problems that we've seen are slowing it down, but it just seems to be a lot of

22:16.600 --> 22:17.800
excuses from them.

22:17.800 --> 22:18.800
Yeah.

22:18.800 --> 22:19.800
Okay.

22:19.800 --> 22:23.320
So they did just post an update on their Medium blog before all this lawsuit stuff kind of

22:23.320 --> 22:27.960
erupted on March 19th and it reads right here at the top, we have confirmed delivery of

22:27.960 --> 22:32.600
enough parts by the end of March to build our first 500 Atari VCS production units.

22:32.600 --> 22:38.680
A good portion of those first Atari VCS units are earmarked as dev kits for more developers.

22:38.680 --> 22:43.840
We believe it would be unfair to use the balance to fulfill only a small number of IndieGoGo

22:43.840 --> 22:44.840
orders.

22:44.840 --> 22:51.520
So Atari's plan is to ship to all backers at the same time when enough VCS units and

22:51.520 --> 22:54.640
peripherals are available.

22:54.640 --> 22:57.840
But there's no timing on that because, you know, coronavirus.

22:57.840 --> 23:00.040
Yeah, which is a bit strange.

23:00.040 --> 23:06.960
Only you can just look at who was the first to back the project and send them their console

23:06.960 --> 23:13.040
because isn't that the whole point of crowdfunding to get in early and get it before anyone else?

23:13.040 --> 23:17.920
Whenever a crowd funder has a hardware delay and they're not being upfront and honest,

23:17.920 --> 23:24.120
there is usually language in here that is a little bit suspicious.

23:24.120 --> 23:28.720
When they write, we believe it would be unfair to use the balance to fulfill only a small

23:28.720 --> 23:30.600
number of IndieGoGo orders.

23:30.600 --> 23:38.120
So Atari's plan is to a wait for an arbitrary date for be an arbitrary number of both VCS

23:38.120 --> 23:41.280
units and all of the peripherals become available.

23:41.280 --> 23:46.040
Those are three different milestones in one sentence that they cannot commit to any times

23:46.040 --> 23:47.040
on.

23:47.040 --> 23:53.540
And this is such a typical weasel community backed community funded type update where

23:53.540 --> 23:56.860
they weasel in the words there a little bit and they make it sound like they're doing

23:56.860 --> 23:58.360
the best thing for their backers.

23:58.360 --> 24:02.600
We don't want to be unfair, so we're not going to ship to anybody.

24:02.600 --> 24:06.320
Really after all this time, you're not desperate to have people making YouTube videos and posting

24:06.320 --> 24:09.280
pictures of it on Reddit and Twitter saying it's alive.

24:09.280 --> 24:10.320
It's really coming.

24:10.320 --> 24:14.240
That wouldn't directly benefit everything you're doing to have some hype built and have

24:14.240 --> 24:15.960
actual units out in the field.

24:15.960 --> 24:16.960
Really?

24:16.960 --> 24:17.960
I'm not buying that.

24:17.960 --> 24:22.040
Well, the generous reading of it would be that it's a bad business decision to hang

24:22.040 --> 24:24.600
on to those finished consoles and not ship them.

24:24.600 --> 24:30.920
A more cynical person might question the veracity of their claim that they have those units.

24:30.920 --> 24:31.920
Yes.

24:31.920 --> 24:32.920
Yes.

24:32.920 --> 24:37.280
Now, because I've spent my heart and money on this, I'm getting in the cynical category.

24:37.280 --> 24:41.940
And with Rob Wyatt's having to sue them, I mean, the guy's the co-creator of the Xbox

24:41.940 --> 24:45.560
and these units, if they're getting so close to ship, they must have gotten that work done

24:45.560 --> 24:46.560
somehow.

24:46.560 --> 24:47.560
Did somebody else do that work?

24:47.560 --> 24:48.560
What's the story there?

24:48.560 --> 24:50.120
Why isn't Atari being upfront about that?

24:50.120 --> 24:53.280
Just saying it just doesn't pass the smell test anymore.

24:53.280 --> 24:54.280
Yeah.

24:54.280 --> 25:00.960
Now, this was going to be this cool Linux-based console that looks like the old Atari and

25:00.960 --> 25:05.100
even have the joystick controller and everything.

25:05.100 --> 25:07.960
But this dream seems to be fading.

25:07.960 --> 25:10.120
See, I think it's still going to ship.

25:10.120 --> 25:15.320
It'll just be horribly underwhelming, poorly executed, and die off in the first generation.

25:15.320 --> 25:17.680
And it'll be, of course, super late.

25:17.680 --> 25:18.680
But it'll ship.

25:18.680 --> 25:20.040
And I'll have the hardware.

25:20.040 --> 25:23.280
And if nothing else, maybe I can just put desktop Linux on it.

25:23.280 --> 25:24.280
Maybe.

25:24.280 --> 25:26.240
Who knows what route they're going to go.

25:26.240 --> 25:29.840
They were originally going to make it quite securely locked down so you could boot a live

25:29.840 --> 25:30.840
Linux on it.

25:30.840 --> 25:36.320
But it seems the plans have changed so much that it'll end up being just a regular x86

25:36.320 --> 25:41.800
box with a skinned version of Ubuntu, probably, that hopefully you'll be able to replace with

25:41.800 --> 25:44.200
just regular Ubuntu with Kodi or something.

25:44.200 --> 25:45.400
It'd actually be pretty great.

25:45.400 --> 25:47.800
That'd be pretty nice if I could make a media center box.

25:47.800 --> 25:49.720
It's a nice looking rig.

25:49.720 --> 25:51.680
You know, the guy's already spent the money for it, Joe.

25:51.680 --> 25:52.680
So why not?

25:52.680 --> 25:56.440
It's not like I'm making a bad purchase now.

25:56.440 --> 25:57.440
I already did that.

25:57.440 --> 25:58.440
Yeah.

25:58.440 --> 26:00.280
Just think what you could have done.

26:00.280 --> 26:03.440
Just imagine if you'd invested that money in Bitcoin back then, how much it'd be worth

26:03.440 --> 26:04.440
now.

26:04.440 --> 26:05.440
Oh, that stings.

26:05.440 --> 26:06.440
Why?

26:06.440 --> 26:07.440
Why?

26:07.440 --> 26:08.440
Why?

26:08.440 --> 26:09.440
Why?

26:09.440 --> 26:10.440
Why?

26:10.440 --> 26:11.440
Why?

26:11.440 --> 26:12.440
Why?

26:12.440 --> 26:13.440
Why?

26:13.440 --> 26:14.440
Why?

26:14.440 --> 26:15.440
Why?

26:15.440 --> 26:16.440
Why?

26:16.440 --> 26:17.440
Why?

26:17.440 --> 26:18.440
Why?

26:18.440 --> 26:19.440
Why?

26:19.440 --> 26:20.440
Why?

26:20.440 --> 26:21.440
Why?

26:21.440 --> 26:22.440
Why?

26:22.440 --> 26:26.960
We'll be back next Monday with our weekly take on the latest Linux and open source news.

26:26.960 --> 26:28.700
You can find me at chrislats.com.

26:28.700 --> 26:30.840
You can find me at trellrest.com.
