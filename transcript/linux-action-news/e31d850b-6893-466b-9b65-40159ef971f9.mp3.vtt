00:00.000 --> 00:16.140
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, our weekly take on Linux and the open-source world.

00:16.140 --> 00:20.560
This is episode 81, recorded on November 25th, 2018.

00:20.560 --> 00:21.560
I'm Chris.

00:21.560 --> 00:22.560
And I'm Joe.

00:22.560 --> 00:23.560
Hello, Joe.

00:23.560 --> 00:27.980
Good to be connected with you, and we're going to kick off this week's episode with one of

00:27.980 --> 00:31.840
our favorite topics to speculate about, and that's Fuchsia.

00:31.840 --> 00:37.880
It's just, you can't resist it, especially when Huawei is testing Fuchsia on the Honor

00:37.880 --> 00:38.880
Play.

00:38.880 --> 00:42.520
Yeah, now this hasn't been officially announced, but people have been digging through the Fuchsia

00:42.520 --> 00:46.760
source code, and they saw the Honor Play in there, and so people have kind of put two

00:46.760 --> 00:52.560
and two together and realized that it looks like Google are working with Huawei again

00:52.560 --> 00:56.280
like they did on the Nexus 6P.

00:56.280 --> 01:00.200
And this could maybe be the first phone, but that seems like a long shot.

01:00.200 --> 01:04.040
It seems like maybe they just need a device to do some testing on.

01:04.040 --> 01:05.740
Yeah, perhaps.

01:05.740 --> 01:07.360
You could really see this going either way.

01:07.360 --> 01:08.360
We don't know.

01:08.360 --> 01:12.300
Google has yet to really speak publicly about Project Fuchsia.

01:12.300 --> 01:14.440
We know it's open source.

01:14.440 --> 01:17.280
We know it's been getting worked on for years now.

01:17.280 --> 01:20.120
It's kind of going a slow but steady pace.

01:20.120 --> 01:25.260
Many people speculate eventually that Fuchsia will replace Android completely.

01:25.260 --> 01:29.040
While the operating system is still in its current state, far from finished, we know

01:29.040 --> 01:32.280
that Huawei will possibly be the first OEM now.

01:32.280 --> 01:38.000
That's kind of a milestone in the development of a project like this, a target device to

01:38.000 --> 01:39.800
try to get working.

01:39.800 --> 01:44.760
And from the commit logs, we know that Fuchsia is booting its specific Zycron.

01:44.760 --> 01:45.760
What's it called, Joe?

01:45.760 --> 01:46.760
The Zycron kernel?

01:46.760 --> 01:47.760
Zircon.

01:47.760 --> 01:48.760
Zircon?

01:48.760 --> 01:49.760
Zircon.

01:49.760 --> 01:50.760
Yeah, okay.

01:50.760 --> 01:52.980
The Zircon kernel is actually booting on the Honor Play.

01:52.980 --> 01:58.600
So it's either way you look at this, whether this is going to be a shipping device, it's

01:58.600 --> 02:00.980
actually a huge milestone regardless.

02:00.980 --> 02:03.960
And it's not a particularly high-end device, far from it, really.

02:03.960 --> 02:04.960
It's very much mid-range.

02:04.960 --> 02:08.520
I've just had a look now, and you can pick one up for 250 pounds in the UK.

02:08.520 --> 02:10.400
So this is not a high-end flagship.

02:10.400 --> 02:12.520
It looks very much like an iPhone, though, doesn't it?

02:12.520 --> 02:15.320
It's one of those clones of the iPhone X.

02:15.320 --> 02:18.240
Well, and it's not just the Honor Play, really.

02:18.240 --> 02:26.240
The patch itself adds support for the high-silicon 970 system on a chip to Fuchsia's kernel.

02:26.240 --> 02:30.800
And the Honor Play is just one of a handful of devices that use that chipset.

02:30.800 --> 02:35.720
So there's some higher-range phones that this technically is adding support for as well.

02:35.720 --> 02:41.360
But to me, this isn't great news, really, because Huawei have been pretty hostile to

02:41.360 --> 02:46.040
the custom ROM community in that this year they locked down their bootloader, so you

02:46.040 --> 02:48.400
can't really flash custom ROMs anymore.

02:48.400 --> 02:56.520
So you'd think that with a new project like Fuchsia that they would go for a more hacker-friendly

02:56.520 --> 03:01.960
OEM, but maybe that sort of points towards the new direction they've been going in since

03:01.960 --> 03:03.560
they ditched Nexus.

03:03.560 --> 03:09.320
Oh, Joe, you have this adorable free software perspective that you just can't shake.

03:09.320 --> 03:12.840
You got to think about this from total market domination perspective.

03:12.840 --> 03:18.880
You see, you get everybody to eat the shit sandwich up front, and then later on everything's

03:18.880 --> 03:19.880
great.

03:19.880 --> 03:23.880
So for example, you want to ship the iPhone X without a headphone jack, and you don't

03:23.880 --> 03:27.520
want that to be the number one story, you remove it in the iPhone 7.

03:27.520 --> 03:30.040
You get everybody to eat the shit sandwich ahead of time.

03:30.040 --> 03:33.900
This is what's been going on with these bootloaders for ages now.

03:33.900 --> 03:38.280
First it was get the unlock codes from the website, then it was get the unlock codes

03:38.280 --> 03:41.460
from tech support, then it was no unlock codes for you.

03:41.460 --> 03:46.880
It's a gradual progression, so that way you have to run the OS they've blessed.

03:46.880 --> 03:49.880
The experience, sorry, I should get that right.

03:49.880 --> 03:54.760
The experience that they've blessed for you, Joe, and in the future it may be a Fuchsia

03:54.760 --> 03:58.800
based experience, and they want you to understand that story, Joe.

03:58.800 --> 04:02.520
And if you don't understand that story and that experience, then that's the wrong device

04:02.520 --> 04:03.520
for you.

04:03.520 --> 04:06.880
Heaven forbid you just reflash it with an operating system that works better for you

04:06.880 --> 04:09.600
and has a great legacy application support.

04:09.600 --> 04:13.480
Heaven forbid that, no, you need to understand their story, Joe.

04:13.480 --> 04:18.080
Well, yeah, they're moving much more towards the Apple way of doing things where good luck

04:18.080 --> 04:19.920
flashing a custom ROM on an iPhone.

04:19.920 --> 04:23.600
Yeah, why do they have to do this just as I'm starting to really enjoy the Pixel?

04:23.600 --> 04:25.020
Go figure, right?

04:25.020 --> 04:27.840
But just between you and me, don't tell anybody else this.

04:27.840 --> 04:31.640
As long as they don't touch Chrome OS, I'm pretty happy.

04:31.640 --> 04:35.200
Chrome OS I think is the real success story for Linux.

04:35.200 --> 04:40.240
Android has always felt like a bastardized version of Linux.

04:40.240 --> 04:44.120
Like they took everything that's great about Linux and open source and kind of killed it

04:44.120 --> 04:50.120
and just wrecked it and then shipped this vulnerability in a pocket to everybody that's

04:50.120 --> 04:51.120
out there.

04:51.120 --> 04:54.760
So now we have like a billion Android users that have zero day exploits on their phone

04:54.760 --> 04:56.760
that are always connected to the internet.

04:56.760 --> 05:02.840
The tech snap broadcaster in me just cries at this security travesty, and I'm ready to

05:02.840 --> 05:04.740
just get rid of Android.

05:04.740 --> 05:11.000
It feels like it was a bad experiment to compete with the iOS ecosystem that never really worked.

05:11.000 --> 05:15.880
And I like Android where it's gotten to, but I'm ready for it to be gone.

05:15.880 --> 05:20.840
Chrome OS, however, if they replace Chrome OS with a Fuchsia kernel and a Fuchsia user

05:20.840 --> 05:26.000
land, me and Google are going to have some words.

05:26.000 --> 05:27.000
Fair enough.

05:27.000 --> 05:30.340
Well, it's all speculation really, isn't it, at this stage?

05:30.340 --> 05:37.000
It could be like one of the many projects that Google have tried and ditched, and we

05:37.000 --> 05:39.320
may actually never see it ship on devices.

05:39.320 --> 05:43.600
It could just be a backup plan for them for all we know, but somehow I don't think that's

05:43.600 --> 05:44.600
the case.

05:44.600 --> 05:49.920
I think that we will be seeing Fuchsia devices within the next couple of years, but who knows.

05:49.920 --> 05:50.920
Yeah.

05:50.920 --> 05:55.080
Knowing Google, we're going to see Android devices for years.

05:55.080 --> 06:00.080
We just recently talked about Android getting multi-year kernel support in just the most

06:00.080 --> 06:02.840
recent Android releases in Linux Unplugged.

06:02.840 --> 06:07.820
They're doing work right now to make Android devices supported for years.

06:07.820 --> 06:12.400
So they may have a multi-OS strategy here, but going back to your point about discontinued

06:12.400 --> 06:17.440
devices, I mean, everybody loves to give Google a hard time about discontinuing services,

06:17.440 --> 06:22.440
but this week, Valve discontinued a device that I actually thought was the future of

06:22.440 --> 06:23.440
the company.

06:23.440 --> 06:30.320
It's here, the Steam Link box, which they heavily discounted it and then sold the lot

06:30.320 --> 06:31.320
of them, and that's it.

06:31.320 --> 06:33.200
They're not making any more of them.

06:33.200 --> 06:35.640
Heavily discounted them for a period of time.

06:35.640 --> 06:40.960
They were selling them for $2.50.

06:40.960 --> 06:41.960
That's remarkable.

06:41.960 --> 06:47.520
Now, I guess I should back up here because you might not even know what the Steam Link

06:47.520 --> 06:49.040
is if you're not a gamer.

06:49.040 --> 06:55.720
The Steam Link device was this tiny, slim piece of hardware that had USB and Ethernet

06:55.720 --> 06:57.480
and HDMI out the back.

06:57.480 --> 07:01.900
It was smaller than any set-top device that you might find on the market right now, even

07:01.900 --> 07:03.960
like the Nvidia Shield or the Apple TV.

07:03.960 --> 07:09.120
It was tiny, and it would link back to a more powerful PC.

07:09.120 --> 07:13.520
Maybe they had the latest GPU or had a decent CPU and it had some memory, and you could

07:13.520 --> 07:18.320
really render some graphics, and it would stream that to the Steam Link to your TV,

07:18.320 --> 07:22.440
which would have a controller, of course, like the Steam Controller or the Xbox controller

07:22.440 --> 07:25.480
or whatever you might like hooked up to your television.

07:25.480 --> 07:30.960
The idea was all over your LAN with low latency and great response time, you could stream

07:30.960 --> 07:36.960
something from a much more powerful PC, maybe even a Windows PC, heaven forbid, or right

07:36.960 --> 07:41.200
to the Steam Link connected to your television, and you could get that console experience

07:41.200 --> 07:42.780
regardless.

07:42.780 --> 07:48.200
The great thing, of course, for us geeks was that the Steam Link was running Linux.

07:48.200 --> 07:49.840
This was all over your LAN.

07:49.840 --> 07:54.360
No weird internet connection latency issues or problems with streaming because it's just

07:54.360 --> 07:55.360
on your Wi-Fi.

07:55.360 --> 07:59.200
You get good Wi-Fi, and you've got great game streaming.

07:59.200 --> 08:02.260
Well, this ties in with the death of the Steam boxes as well.

08:02.260 --> 08:06.520
It's them wrapping up the hardware business and just doing pure software now because you

08:06.520 --> 08:09.880
can get the same functionality with an Android device, with the Android app.

08:09.880 --> 08:13.080
I mean, I presume your Nvidia Shield can do it.

08:13.080 --> 08:14.080
That's been Valve's answer.

08:14.080 --> 08:17.320
Oh, we're going to solve it with the apps, but if there has been something for the Nvidia

08:17.320 --> 08:21.080
Shield TV that is Valve-created, I haven't seen it yet.

08:21.080 --> 08:22.960
I don't know.

08:22.960 --> 08:25.060
The thing is, this is a dedicated system.

08:25.060 --> 08:27.880
You have it on a dedicated input.

08:27.880 --> 08:33.480
It's hardware versus an app, and when it comes to gaming, it does make a difference, and

08:33.480 --> 08:38.360
I'm surprised by this because I really thought, in a way, this was sort of the future of what

08:38.360 --> 08:40.480
Valve wanted to offer.

08:40.480 --> 08:45.600
Microsoft is launching Xbox in the cloud, which is streaming gaming.

08:45.600 --> 08:49.200
Google is launching streaming gaming.

08:49.200 --> 08:54.620
Nintendo offers streaming gaming in a limited way right now with the Nintendo Classic.

08:54.620 --> 08:59.540
It's becoming a phenomenon, and then, of course, speaking of the Nvidia Shield, there is also

08:59.540 --> 09:03.780
the GeForce streaming service, which actually seems to be the best out of all of them in

09:03.780 --> 09:05.120
my testing.

09:05.120 --> 09:13.280
All of this is streaming over the internet, though, and it is susceptible to bad latency,

09:13.280 --> 09:20.400
routes that get slow, just average Comcast issues that strike people every single day.

09:20.400 --> 09:25.000
It's susceptible to all of these kinds of problems that impact the internet, whereas

09:25.000 --> 09:31.040
the Steam Link system was over the land, and it seemed like, to me, the cleverest of them

09:31.040 --> 09:32.040
all.

09:32.040 --> 09:37.640
You invest in one machine, which you could stick in the garage or a closet somewhere,

09:37.640 --> 09:43.040
and you can Steam Link and stream to all of your PCs and your televisions.

09:43.040 --> 09:47.080
It to me was the perfect system, and I thought Valve was ahead of everybody else.

09:47.080 --> 09:51.440
While everyone else is trying to figure out how to stream video games over the internet,

09:51.440 --> 09:52.440
Valve was like, well, screw that.

09:52.440 --> 09:55.960
We'll just stream it over your land, problem solved.

09:55.960 --> 10:01.040
To see them back off and say, oh, well, you can do it on these Android devices, which

10:01.040 --> 10:07.680
have random input latency issues and have random Wi-Fi issues, and you can't put it

10:07.680 --> 10:12.440
on your television, and don't worry about not being able to hook up a controller, but

10:12.440 --> 10:16.400
you could play it on your phone, that's good enough.

10:16.400 --> 10:18.120
To me, I'm shocked by this.

10:18.120 --> 10:19.960
Well, I'm not shocked.

10:19.960 --> 10:25.120
In three years since it launched, they still didn't have a Generation 2 with Gigabit Ethernet,

10:25.120 --> 10:28.080
which was what everyone wanted, surely.

10:28.080 --> 10:29.080
Come on, really?

10:29.080 --> 10:33.640
I mean, maybe, but you're talking 1080p gaming here.

10:33.640 --> 10:39.480
I thought what you'd expect to see is once 4K really became established in the home,

10:39.480 --> 10:43.300
Valve would just iterate on top of this thing and release a 4K version.

10:43.300 --> 10:49.480
And it seemed like the perfect machine because it ran Linux, it was controlled by Valve,

10:49.480 --> 10:54.800
it was tiny, it was accepting any kind of controller that you wanted to play with, and

10:54.800 --> 10:59.060
it would stream games from a machine that ran Linux or Windows or probably even a Mac

10:59.060 --> 11:00.880
if there was a game that ran on a Mac.

11:00.880 --> 11:02.560
You could do that.

11:02.560 --> 11:10.160
And now, at best, what you're going to get is an Android layer underneath all of this,

11:10.160 --> 11:14.920
which will add latency, add complexity, require updates.

11:14.920 --> 11:16.440
It's not the same experience.

11:16.440 --> 11:21.720
And so, I'm frustrated because I thought Valve was way ahead of the game here.

11:21.720 --> 11:26.620
And also, I wasn't able to get one at $2.50, so that might be...

11:26.620 --> 11:29.760
That's what you're really annoyed about, yeah.

11:29.760 --> 11:34.680
What I really want to know now is how long are they going to support this from Steam?

11:34.680 --> 11:39.120
Is it going to just drop off within a year or so, or are they going to have to support

11:39.120 --> 11:40.120
it long term?

11:40.120 --> 11:41.120
I think a long time, Joe.

11:41.120 --> 11:45.880
I mean, I think if you bought it at $2.50, that may be one of the better $2.50 you've

11:45.880 --> 11:49.760
ever spent, especially when you consider there's apps that you've probably bought at that and

11:49.760 --> 11:52.480
then deleted.

11:52.480 --> 11:58.880
Just going by the recent code contributions by Valve engineers, they have been working

11:58.880 --> 12:00.320
on the streaming technology.

12:00.320 --> 12:04.920
They've been making upstream contributions to different projects to improve compatibility

12:04.920 --> 12:10.400
with Steam Link streaming as of three weeks ago.

12:10.400 --> 12:13.720
So this is obviously from an application layer, something they're going to support for a long

12:13.720 --> 12:14.720
time.

12:14.720 --> 12:19.200
And it seems like a pretty trivial effort to continue to support this device because

12:19.200 --> 12:24.440
you're talking an H.264 stream and then the controls and a communications channel for

12:24.440 --> 12:25.440
all of that.

12:25.440 --> 12:30.040
But the magic sauce is keeping that low latency, which is where a lot of the recent code contributions

12:30.040 --> 12:31.040
have been.

12:31.040 --> 12:38.400
They're continuing to innovate in that area and then contributing that to upstream projects.

12:38.400 --> 12:41.480
That's not something you do when you're pulling out of a project.

12:41.480 --> 12:42.960
Yeah, true.

12:42.960 --> 12:45.920
Well, $2.50 is not much.

12:45.920 --> 12:51.520
What about the $300 or so that you spent on the Atari VCS and still haven't received?

12:51.520 --> 12:53.120
Yeah.

12:53.120 --> 12:55.600
Less and less enthusiastic as time goes on.

12:55.600 --> 12:57.780
I kind of forgot about it.

12:57.780 --> 13:02.400
And then when I read this, it's hard to get psyched.

13:02.400 --> 13:05.160
I think I've kind of lost my enthusiasm.

13:05.160 --> 13:10.880
So the Atari VCS is supposed to be a box which will offer a bunch of retro games and more

13:10.880 --> 13:12.520
running Linux.

13:12.520 --> 13:20.440
And now we have what are essentially raw notes from Rob Wyatt, who's working on the Atari

13:20.440 --> 13:22.100
VCS operating system.

13:22.100 --> 13:23.860
He's the system architect.

13:23.860 --> 13:30.680
And these raw notes, they don't leave me super inspired, but it all kind of doesn't surprise

13:30.680 --> 13:31.720
me either.

13:31.720 --> 13:36.600
What is it that doesn't inspire you then, the fact that it's going to be more locked

13:36.600 --> 13:38.360
down than you'd hoped or what?

13:38.360 --> 13:43.880
Well, I think in part, now that some time has passed, it feels a bit like the Ubuntu

13:43.880 --> 13:49.000
phone versus Android situation all over again.

13:49.000 --> 13:55.680
A plucky upstart is going to come along and disrupt some entrenched market leaders.

13:55.680 --> 13:57.080
That's not very likely.

13:57.080 --> 13:58.080
But lockdown?

13:58.080 --> 13:59.860
I don't know if I agree with that.

13:59.860 --> 14:05.880
In fact, in their blog, in these notes, one of the notes is the VCS is all about democratizing

14:05.880 --> 14:07.440
the game console.

14:07.440 --> 14:09.660
They've been locked down for far too long.

14:09.660 --> 14:13.440
The VCS can have an Atari World, which has an online store.

14:13.440 --> 14:18.560
It's safe and secure with parental controls and the ability to launch apps that can do

14:18.560 --> 14:21.740
all of the stuff that a modern console should.

14:21.740 --> 14:26.680
But outside of our world, we'll support users installing their other operating systems,

14:26.680 --> 14:32.480
the ones they like, very much like the original PlayStation 3, but without the hardware restrictions.

14:32.480 --> 14:35.460
Famously, the PlayStation 3 had a virtualizer.

14:35.460 --> 14:39.280
You can install Linux, but then you couldn't get to the GPU.

14:39.280 --> 14:42.280
Their virtualizer, they say, won't have those kinds of limitations.

14:42.280 --> 14:45.760
Yeah, but why not just give you access to all of the hardware?

14:45.760 --> 14:50.200
Why do you need to have any virtualization at all?

14:50.200 --> 14:51.200
It's going to be x86-based.

14:51.200 --> 14:54.760
Why can't it just boot Linux properly?

14:54.760 --> 14:56.120
That's what I meant by lockdown.

14:56.120 --> 15:00.980
I suppose that's not realistic in a console, and having at least hardware pass through

15:00.980 --> 15:05.880
for the GPU and everything is as good as you're going to get, but it's still a little bit

15:05.880 --> 15:07.440
disappointing to me.

15:07.440 --> 15:11.480
Because I thought this thing was going to be more hackable.

15:11.480 --> 15:12.740
That's kind of how I read it.

15:12.740 --> 15:16.400
Maybe that's just wishful thinking by me, but I thought this was going to be a device

15:16.400 --> 15:21.040
that, okay, it would have this experience that they would put on it, but it would be

15:21.040 --> 15:24.120
completely hackable and you could just do whatever you wanted with it because it is

15:24.120 --> 15:25.120
essentially a PC.

15:25.120 --> 15:29.120
Yeah, I think they're trying to strike the balance between a secure environment that

15:29.120 --> 15:36.340
they can claim to game makers or publishing companies like Netflix or Hulu.

15:36.340 --> 15:41.560
This is a secure environment where piracy cannot take place because everything is signed

15:41.560 --> 15:44.000
and we've double-checked everything.

15:44.000 --> 15:48.800
In fact, they say any OS that is installed will need its startup code modified because

15:48.800 --> 15:55.400
our hypervisor and boot code will enter the OS directly in 64-bit protected mode, which

15:55.400 --> 15:59.080
the current Linux boots in real mode, which is an interesting aside, but the Atari OS

15:59.080 --> 16:03.520
is based on a modified version of the Linux kernel, and they're going to patch components

16:03.520 --> 16:08.520
in there and build components in there that they sign to verify the integrity of it, and

16:08.520 --> 16:09.520
then it boots up.

16:09.520 --> 16:12.960
They can verify everything's good, then they can say, yeah, you can sell your $60 game

16:12.960 --> 16:18.960
on our platform because we can guarantee nobody's pirated, or yeah, you can stream your multimillion

16:18.960 --> 16:24.800
dollar movie industry production on our box because no one's going to be pirating this,

16:24.800 --> 16:28.960
but to make everybody happy, we're going to make this hypervisor available where you can

16:28.960 --> 16:34.040
install your Ubuntu or your Arches or your Fedoras and you'll get access to the GPU.

16:34.040 --> 16:39.500
Yeah, I suppose realistically that's the best we were going to get, but it still feels

16:39.500 --> 16:46.780
a bit disappointing to me because if that experience isn't that great, or if Atari just completely

16:46.780 --> 16:52.740
moves on from this and moves on to gambling apps and the other stuff that they're working

16:52.740 --> 16:58.400
on to make serious money and just completely abandon this down the road, like in a year

16:58.400 --> 17:03.800
or two or three or five, whatever, then at least if it was just a PC, then you could

17:03.800 --> 17:11.720
install Ubuntu on there, get Kodi working on it, whatever, but not being truly open

17:11.720 --> 17:16.200
to that hacking limits the possibility of that, I think.

17:16.200 --> 17:20.600
Yeah, but then it would also be just a PC and it would have all of the issues that just

17:20.600 --> 17:26.560
a PC has, which maybe we're cool with taking care of, but the average consumer isn't.

17:26.560 --> 17:32.700
And their goal as a team is to get the OS and all of the built-in apps to consume just

17:32.700 --> 17:36.680
under a gig of storage, and then they want to leave the rest for users.

17:36.680 --> 17:42.340
So in a way, what the console offers them is a fixed hardware base, so all the drivers

17:42.340 --> 17:43.960
will be built into the kernel.

17:43.960 --> 17:47.300
They're not going to have to use modules, and they feel like that's going to make less

17:47.300 --> 17:49.460
security attack surfaces.

17:49.460 --> 17:55.180
It makes it less of a security risk, and in some cases, it'll make it maybe a little harder

17:55.180 --> 18:00.620
to put alternative operating systems on the core, like on the root of the hardware.

18:00.620 --> 18:05.120
But if they're creating something that has a hypervisor, where you can get access to

18:05.120 --> 18:11.080
a lot of the physical hardware, it is the best compromise we have seen yet in an appliance

18:11.080 --> 18:15.720
type device that is trying to appease industry licensing requirements.

18:15.720 --> 18:19.400
But I agree, it isn't that exciting anymore.

18:19.400 --> 18:22.480
It is a bit ho-hum at this point for me.

18:22.480 --> 18:27.240
And at this point, I don't regret backing it, because in a way, it could be a collector's

18:27.240 --> 18:31.540
item even if it goes belly up, but I am not excited about it.

18:31.540 --> 18:37.340
And it feels a little uninspired.

18:37.340 --> 18:40.680
You see them in here talking about getting the base system up and running and what that

18:40.680 --> 18:41.680
took.

18:41.680 --> 18:46.340
And to be honest, getting a recent Linux kernel booting on an x86 based platform and then

18:46.340 --> 18:51.900
getting the audio to work, I don't mean to be demeaning, but that's the easy part.

18:51.900 --> 18:56.780
And if that's where they've been struggling so far, I don't really have a lot of expectations

18:56.780 --> 18:57.780
anymore.

18:57.780 --> 18:58.780
Yeah.

18:58.780 --> 19:02.120
No wonder the CEO, when he was asked when this thing's going to ship, his answer was

19:02.120 --> 19:03.120
2019.

19:03.120 --> 19:06.120
So nice and vague there.

19:06.120 --> 19:07.120
Yeah.

19:07.120 --> 19:08.120
You know, that might surprise you.

19:08.120 --> 19:09.120
You might get it in early January.

19:09.120 --> 19:13.680
Well, you know, I'll tell you what, when I do get it, I'll have a full review.

19:13.680 --> 19:18.120
So I'll give you my impressions the moment I receive the item.

19:18.120 --> 19:22.360
I was sort of impressed by some news out of Amazon this week.

19:22.360 --> 19:25.960
It's specifically around their EC2 service, but I think this is something that's going

19:25.960 --> 19:30.360
to set a new benchmark for the industry and is going to really take off.

19:30.360 --> 19:33.760
It's predictive scaling for EC2 powered by machine learning.

19:33.760 --> 19:38.240
Yeah, they've had auto scaling for about 10 years nearly at this point.

19:38.240 --> 19:39.340
But this is different, isn't it?

19:39.340 --> 19:45.760
This is using algorithms and machine learning to look at your usage, combine that with a

19:45.760 --> 19:53.480
load of other factors, and then predict when you need more or less compute power, which

19:53.480 --> 19:58.700
potentially is going to save customers, big customers at least, a lot of money.

19:58.700 --> 20:03.920
What I like about this story is this is really kind of the promise long term of the cloud.

20:03.920 --> 20:05.420
This is why you go to the cloud, right?

20:05.420 --> 20:10.700
So Amazon writes, using data collected from your actual EC2 usage and further informed

20:10.700 --> 20:15.660
by billions of data points drawn from our own observations, we will use well trained

20:15.660 --> 20:21.880
machine learning models to predict your expected traffic, including daily and weekly patterns.

20:21.880 --> 20:25.380
They do note in here, and this is kind of some interesting insight, the model needs

20:25.380 --> 20:31.700
at least one day of historical data to start making predictions, and then that is reevaluated

20:31.700 --> 20:36.940
every 24 hours to create a forecast for the next 48 hours.

20:36.940 --> 20:40.480
But like you said, Joe, it actually can help save some money too.

20:40.480 --> 20:44.100
So not only is it super simple to set up, which I think will be part of the benchmark

20:44.100 --> 20:46.940
now for cloud providers, it's a three step wizard.

20:46.940 --> 20:50.800
You go through it, you turn it on with a single click, go through the three steps, and then

20:50.800 --> 20:51.980
it's on.

20:51.980 --> 20:57.400
But the part that's kind of nice is it can also predict when things are gonna slow down.

20:57.400 --> 21:03.260
So it helps you avoid over provisioning, which will reduce costs.

21:03.260 --> 21:04.540
That's kind of nice too.

21:04.540 --> 21:05.920
The whole thing's pretty slick.

21:05.920 --> 21:09.860
The whole way it works is really kind of slick, and the visualization system is pretty cool.

21:09.860 --> 21:14.380
And you know that Microsoft and Google are scrambling now to match this feature.

21:14.380 --> 21:18.740
I was just thinking too, like, could this trickle down to like the digital ocean and

21:18.740 --> 21:25.520
OVH level as well, where all of them are collecting like your network stats and your CPU usage

21:25.520 --> 21:29.240
and your memory usage, like that's data they have, but they then need a system that sits

21:29.240 --> 21:35.340
on top of that and analyzes that intelligently and says, well, historically, you may need

21:35.340 --> 21:40.540
more resources or I bet a lot of cases, in fact, I bet the majority of cases for like

21:40.540 --> 21:43.580
OVH and digital ocean, you might need less resources.

21:43.580 --> 21:45.840
Well, yeah, that would be very useful for me.

21:45.840 --> 21:50.140
Every two weeks when I put out late night Linux, it would ramp up the resources for

21:50.140 --> 21:54.940
eight hours, 10 hours, 12 hours, and then ramp down and would potentially save quite

21:54.940 --> 21:55.940
a lot of money.

21:55.940 --> 21:56.940
Yeah.

21:56.940 --> 21:57.940
I'm surprised this hasn't really been a bigger thing.

21:57.940 --> 22:03.440
Like, I mean, like you said, you've had auto scaling for a while, but this is a whole new

22:03.440 --> 22:07.740
level of auto scaling, auto prediction.

22:07.740 --> 22:12.700
It is finally taking advantage of what computers are inherently good at and then applying them

22:12.700 --> 22:14.580
to our infrastructure.

22:14.580 --> 22:17.720
And Drone.io has a similar idea.

22:17.720 --> 22:23.020
The Drone.io co-founder and Packet are teaming up for a free continuous delivery service

22:23.020 --> 22:25.120
for open source developers.

22:25.120 --> 22:29.620
And I thought it was good to highlight this just because there are systems now that we

22:29.620 --> 22:33.500
can participate in to have the computers do the hard work.

22:33.500 --> 22:39.260
It's becoming more and more common for open source software to be deployed against different

22:39.260 --> 22:42.940
types of architectures, ARM, Intel, et cetera.

22:42.940 --> 22:47.140
And having systems that can automatically do these builds and test them is key.

22:47.140 --> 22:50.540
And so if this is something that applies to you, if you're working on a project out there

22:50.540 --> 22:54.540
where you need something like this, I encourage you to check out the link in the show notes,

22:54.540 --> 22:55.540
linuxactionnews.com.81.

22:55.540 --> 22:56.540
Yeah.

22:56.540 --> 23:01.660
The only requirement is that your code is on GitHub and free and open source.

23:01.660 --> 23:04.800
So it's pretty good marketing by them, I think.

23:04.800 --> 23:09.540
Give it away to free and open source projects and then anyone who wants to do proprietary

23:09.540 --> 23:13.660
stuff, here's our offerings for not very much per month or whatever.

23:13.660 --> 23:15.580
So yeah, hats off for them.

23:15.580 --> 23:16.740
They've got us talking about it.

23:16.740 --> 23:17.740
Yeah.

23:17.740 --> 23:20.100
And it is a more and more common business model.

23:20.100 --> 23:23.580
And it's one that I think is pretty great because it benefits the open source community

23:23.580 --> 23:28.380
and they get a little attention for it and everybody wins.

23:28.380 --> 23:32.720
Well, maybe except for some cases, not everyone wins.

23:32.720 --> 23:36.700
And that's something we have to figure out, especially during the nuclear holocaust.

23:36.700 --> 23:40.980
Yeah, let's end on a nice cheerful note and talk about nuclear weapons.

23:40.980 --> 23:41.980
Yeah.

23:41.980 --> 23:44.540
Okay, great.

23:44.540 --> 23:46.740
And there is a Linux tie-in here, of course.

23:46.740 --> 23:47.740
Of course there is.

23:47.740 --> 23:52.540
Well, what actually makes me feel better about this whole thing is that this new supercomputer,

23:52.540 --> 23:58.220
which is going to be doing the various testing for the existing nuclear arsenal to make sure

23:58.220 --> 24:02.820
that it's all well and good, is running a proper operating system, Red Hat Enterprise

24:02.820 --> 24:03.820
Linux.

24:03.820 --> 24:05.780
So I can sleep safe at night.

24:05.780 --> 24:12.860
Right, in Livermore, California sits Sierra, the world's second most powerful supercomputer.

24:12.860 --> 24:18.380
Sierra looks unassuming, just kind of looks like a basic server farm with a visual style

24:18.380 --> 24:19.380
to it.

24:19.380 --> 24:25.460
But it's actually a massive connected hive of 190,000 processing cores.

24:25.460 --> 24:30.500
It was completed earlier this year and has been on a bit of a shakedown cruise since

24:30.500 --> 24:31.500
then.

24:31.500 --> 24:34.740
The researchers are throwing different kinds of jobs at it right now to kind of see what

24:34.740 --> 24:42.140
it can do, like climate models, astrophysics, medicine, you know, the basics.

24:42.140 --> 24:46.060
But early next year, Sierra's real work will begin.

24:46.060 --> 24:51.500
The system will be air gapped, disconnected from any external network to prevent any kind

24:51.500 --> 24:53.340
of unauthorized access.

24:53.340 --> 24:58.680
And then once that happens, it begins its real calculations, the calculations it was

24:58.680 --> 25:05.100
purpose built to carry out simulations of nuclear weapon launches and their detonations.

25:05.100 --> 25:07.500
And potentially quite a lot more that's classified.

25:07.500 --> 25:09.260
So we'll never get to hear about it.

25:09.260 --> 25:11.660
But yeah, oh, well, at least it's running Linux, eh?

25:11.660 --> 25:12.660
Yeah.

25:12.660 --> 25:16.660
And like we mentioned, this is the world's second most powerful supercomputer.

25:16.660 --> 25:21.040
I believe the number one is in Tennessee, and it is actually almost essentially the

25:21.040 --> 25:23.680
same thing as the Sierra system.

25:23.680 --> 25:25.880
So it's an open architecture that's available to the public.

25:25.880 --> 25:27.620
So we actually know quite a bit about it.

25:27.620 --> 25:30.500
And that also runs Red Hat Enterprise Linux.

25:30.500 --> 25:34.280
And it's doing jobs available to us plain civilians.

25:34.280 --> 25:38.260
And so we actually have a lot of insights into what this super high tech one for the

25:38.260 --> 25:39.660
military does.

25:39.660 --> 25:42.980
And they say in a video that we'll have linked in the show notes that they're already working

25:42.980 --> 25:48.860
on the next version called El Capitan, which should have an order of magnitude more processing

25:48.860 --> 25:49.860
power.

25:49.860 --> 25:51.820
Oh, man.

25:51.820 --> 25:56.300
I'm just happy when I can get Vulcan games working off of my dock connected over Thunderbolt,

25:56.300 --> 25:57.300
Joe.

25:57.300 --> 25:58.300
Yeah.

25:58.300 --> 25:59.940
Shouldn't it have been called Mojave instead of El Capitan?

25:59.940 --> 26:03.940
Yeah, that is weird that it's two different Mac OS release names back to back.

26:03.940 --> 26:04.940
I don't like that.

26:04.940 --> 26:06.660
It doesn't sit well with me, Joe.

26:06.660 --> 26:07.660
But you know what?

26:07.660 --> 26:08.660
We'll keep an eye out.

26:08.660 --> 26:09.660
We'll keep watching.

26:09.660 --> 26:10.660
And we'll report here.

26:10.660 --> 26:15.260
Check out linuxactionnews.com slash subscribe for all the ways to get new episodes.

26:15.260 --> 26:18.540
And go to linuxactionnews.com slash contact for ways to get in touch.

26:18.540 --> 26:19.540
Yeah, do that.

26:19.540 --> 26:20.660
Not enough of you have done that recently.

26:20.660 --> 26:23.940
Tell us what kind of stories you want to hear, linuxactionnews.com slash contact.

26:23.940 --> 26:27.620
More importantly, we need to get this on your radar.

26:27.620 --> 26:35.260
Join us at Linux Fest Northwest, April 26th through the 28th, 2019 at the Bellingham Technical

26:35.260 --> 26:38.940
College right here in the beautiful Pacific Northwest.

26:38.940 --> 26:43.620
I think if enough of you show up, I might just be able to convince Joe into doing a

26:43.620 --> 26:46.220
live show at Linux Fest Northwest.

26:46.220 --> 26:47.520
Yeah, you never know.

26:47.520 --> 26:52.220
The plan is for me to be there, so just my arm, I suppose, as long as it's not too early

26:52.220 --> 26:53.220
in the morning.

26:53.220 --> 26:58.140
Come on, that could be so much fun doing a Linux Action News there live at the Fest.

26:58.140 --> 26:59.140
You got to be there.

26:59.140 --> 27:00.460
Yeah, it does sound like a lot of fun.

27:00.460 --> 27:03.500
So yeah, come April 26th to 28th.

27:03.500 --> 27:04.940
I'm really looking forward to it, Joe.

27:04.940 --> 27:07.940
It's also Linux Fest Northwest's 20th anniversary.

27:07.940 --> 27:11.820
So it's the one to go to if you've never been before.

27:11.820 --> 27:15.860
But in the meantime, we'll be back next Monday with our weekly take on the latest Linux and

27:15.860 --> 27:16.900
open source news.

27:16.900 --> 27:18.900
I am at Chris Elias.

27:18.900 --> 27:20.660
I'm at Joe Ressington.

27:20.660 --> 27:23.820
Thank you for joining us, and we will see you next week.

27:23.820 --> 27:50.820
Until then, thanks for listening, and we'll see you later.
