00:00.000 --> 00:09.340
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, episode 225, recorded on January 26th, 2022.

00:09.340 --> 00:10.340
I'm Chris.

00:10.340 --> 00:11.340
I'm Wes.

00:11.340 --> 00:12.340
Hello, Wes.

00:12.340 --> 00:13.880
Let's do the news.

00:13.880 --> 00:18.920
We start this week with news that has ramifications for the entire industry.

00:18.920 --> 00:23.620
It seems that NVIDIA is looking to abandon its acquisition of ARM.

00:23.620 --> 00:26.880
Or at least, that's what Bloomberg reported on Tuesday.

00:26.880 --> 00:32.240
Yeah, it sounds like people that were quote unquote familiar with the matter leaked the

00:32.240 --> 00:38.160
information to Bloomberg that internally NVIDIA doesn't expect the deal to be finalized.

00:38.160 --> 00:46.240
Now publicly, both NVIDIA and Softbank's spokespersons have relayed that they hold

00:46.240 --> 00:51.720
hopes that the deal is completed and that they think it would be great for the industry

00:51.720 --> 00:52.920
if the deal was completed.

00:52.920 --> 00:58.240
So as far as they are publicly commenting right now, they're still giving an air of

00:58.240 --> 00:59.240
confidence.

00:59.240 --> 01:05.840
Of course, but you know, Steele has faced a lot of scrutiny from regulators all over

01:05.840 --> 01:06.840
the world.

01:06.840 --> 01:11.880
I mean, the US's FTC, British regulators, and even regulators in China.

01:11.880 --> 01:15.000
So perhaps this news in some sense isn't all that surprising.

01:15.000 --> 01:16.760
Yeah, I think that is true.

01:16.760 --> 01:20.160
I think a lot of us wondered when I know when we talked about it on this show, we're like,

01:20.160 --> 01:21.600
is this actually going to happen?

01:21.600 --> 01:24.240
Like, I suppose it still could.

01:24.240 --> 01:27.320
It seems like though, either way, NVIDIA is going to be out some cash.

01:27.320 --> 01:29.160
Yeah, that's right.

01:29.160 --> 01:34.520
It's going to be out $2 billion that functioned as a down payment on the transaction.

01:34.520 --> 01:41.000
And then we'll also have to pay $1.25 billion USD as something of a breakup fee when it

01:41.000 --> 01:42.360
walks away from the deal.

01:42.360 --> 01:44.280
Ah, we've all been there NVIDIA.

01:44.280 --> 01:47.640
We've all been there.

01:47.640 --> 01:53.120
It seems the Hi-5 unmatched, that small RISC-V board we've told you about in the past.

01:53.120 --> 01:56.200
Well, it may be ending production.

01:56.200 --> 01:57.200
Noooo!

01:57.200 --> 02:01.320
I really wanted to get my hands on one of these.

02:01.320 --> 02:07.160
The Si-5 Freedom U740 SoC was a sweet little setup, it seemed.

02:07.160 --> 02:12.360
I never got to try one, but you could get it with 16 gigs of RAM, micro SD and an M.2

02:12.360 --> 02:18.720
mini-SSC storage, one PCIe 16x slot and Gigabit Ethernet on that thing.

02:18.720 --> 02:24.280
But it seems that supply chain issues have made things extremely difficult for the Si-5

02:24.280 --> 02:29.400
folks and they have had problem after problem in the last year.

02:29.400 --> 02:34.800
And they noted, quote, with such great ecosystem adoption, demand has exceeded our already

02:34.800 --> 02:36.800
high expectations.

02:36.800 --> 02:40.400
And we're close to selling out on our production inventory.

02:40.400 --> 02:44.120
Given the challenge of supply chain issues that we overcame for the first run of these

02:44.120 --> 02:49.640
boards, issues that we continue to face, we've decided to focus on the next generation of

02:49.640 --> 02:54.840
Si-5 Hi-5 development systems rather than trying to put together another build of the

02:54.840 --> 02:58.440
Hi-5 unmatched platform in 2022.

02:58.440 --> 03:03.560
Those remarks came from Phil Dworsky, the Global Head of Strategic Alliances for Si-5,

03:03.560 --> 03:08.920
and he finished his comments up by saying, quote, our sincere apologies to anyone wanting

03:08.920 --> 03:14.040
a Si-5 Hi-5 unmatched board who hasn't been able to obtain one.

03:14.040 --> 03:17.520
Please stay tuned for news on the next generation system soon.

03:17.520 --> 03:21.360
This seems pretty understandable, especially with the supply chain issues going on and

03:21.360 --> 03:25.040
smaller manufacturers sort of suffer the worst.

03:25.040 --> 03:32.560
But I do have to admit, it does raise a red flag with me when a hardware vendor comes

03:32.560 --> 03:38.840
out and says, hey, I know you were expecting this, but we were so successful.

03:38.840 --> 03:41.280
We can't actually deliver.

03:41.280 --> 03:45.920
And so because we're so successful, we're going to scrap that really successful thing

03:45.920 --> 03:49.660
and do something completely different that we don't have a timeline for and can't give

03:49.660 --> 03:52.840
you an estimate on for a really long time.

03:52.840 --> 03:54.640
But trust us, it's going to be great.

03:54.640 --> 03:59.120
It does seem like a risk of losing some of the excitement and hype they've got going

03:59.120 --> 04:00.120
right now.

04:00.120 --> 04:01.120
Yeah.

04:01.120 --> 04:05.380
It's got to be a pretty tricky position they're in if that's the route they're going, right?

04:05.380 --> 04:06.960
It's not your first choice.

04:06.960 --> 04:10.680
But at the same time, I imagine, you know, limited resources, limited supply lines.

04:10.680 --> 04:14.120
So you do have to make some strategic decisions sometimes.

04:14.120 --> 04:17.440
I guess we just have to hope that whatever they come up with next is pretty great.

04:17.440 --> 04:18.440
Yeah.

04:18.440 --> 04:19.440
And it makes sense.

04:19.440 --> 04:24.480
You know, you take this time to design and build and hope that when you're done with

04:24.480 --> 04:27.040
that process, the supply chain is recovered, I suppose.

04:27.040 --> 04:31.920
And you know, I'm always down for a faster SOC.

04:31.920 --> 04:36.400
And I'm always interested if I could have maybe socketed RAM or a little bit more.

04:36.400 --> 04:37.480
We'll keep an eye on this.

04:37.480 --> 04:42.840
And Michael Arbelov at Ferronix is keeping an eye on it as well.

04:42.840 --> 04:47.960
Security company Qualys has uncovered a dangerous memory corruption vulnerability in Polkit's

04:47.960 --> 04:48.960
PKExec CVE-2021-4034.

04:48.960 --> 04:59.240
If you're not familiar, Polkit, formerly known as Policykit, is a systemd setuid root

04:59.240 --> 05:03.880
program that's installed on a whole bunch of Linux distributions.

05:03.880 --> 05:07.280
And this has really been discovered as far back as November.

05:07.280 --> 05:09.720
And it's a really easy vulnerability to exploit.

05:09.720 --> 05:15.360
We don't talk about all vulnerabilities, but these ones we tend to cover because it's one

05:15.360 --> 05:20.900
of those where if any ordinary user has shell on a system, well, that could be a standard

05:20.900 --> 05:25.380
user or maybe a service that you're running as a user.

05:25.380 --> 05:31.560
If that unprivileged user has access to the local machine, they could utilize this exploit

05:31.560 --> 05:35.120
to get root privileges on a vulnerable computer.

05:35.120 --> 05:36.120
So it's kind of a big deal.

05:36.120 --> 05:40.180
And Qualys wrote in their brief description of the problem, quote, this vulnerability

05:40.180 --> 05:43.060
is an attacker's dream come true.

05:43.060 --> 05:44.560
And here's kind of why they say that.

05:44.560 --> 05:45.640
And we're not trying to scare you.

05:45.640 --> 05:49.580
We're just trying to make sure you know why it's important this gets patched.

05:49.580 --> 05:54.480
Because PKExec is installed by default on just about every major distro out there.

05:54.480 --> 05:59.080
Qualys themselves exploited it on Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, and CentOS.

05:59.080 --> 06:02.900
And they said they really don't see why it wouldn't affect any other distribution that

06:02.900 --> 06:04.120
has PKExec.

06:04.120 --> 06:08.880
And it's been vulnerable since 2009.

06:08.880 --> 06:14.060
And that vulnerability allows any unprivileged local user to exploit that vulnerability to

06:14.060 --> 06:15.240
become root.

06:15.240 --> 06:16.240
So it's bad.

06:16.240 --> 06:17.240
Yeah.

06:17.240 --> 06:22.640
And although this vulnerability is technically a memory corruption issue, turns out it's

06:22.640 --> 06:29.040
still pretty much instantly exploitable, pretty reliably in an architecture independent way.

06:29.040 --> 06:31.760
So your architecture won't save you this time.

06:31.760 --> 06:35.800
It even works if the pull kit daemon itself isn't running.

06:35.800 --> 06:40.640
If you're curious, you want to give it a try on one of your systems or just learn more,

06:40.640 --> 06:43.760
a proof of concept has been released.

06:43.760 --> 06:47.120
And of course, if you haven't patched, well, there's a patch available and distribution

06:47.120 --> 06:50.440
repository near you.

06:50.440 --> 06:52.080
Cute.

06:52.080 --> 06:57.960
The framework that powers the KDE desktop is announcing support for ads in client side

06:57.960 --> 06:59.640
applications.

06:59.640 --> 07:06.480
This does not sound great at first, especially when NeoWin is running headlines like ads

07:06.480 --> 07:09.760
may be coming to KDE, the popular Linux desktop.

07:09.760 --> 07:12.700
That's probably not what's going to happen here.

07:12.700 --> 07:19.440
But the Qt toolkit, which the Plasma desktop is built on top of, is adding upstream support

07:19.440 --> 07:23.720
for placing ads in Qt based applications.

07:23.720 --> 07:29.160
And according to the documentation, they support a quote variety of platforms, including Windows

07:29.160 --> 07:36.600
10, Ubuntu 20.04, Raspbian Buster, Mac OS, Android 7, and iOS.

07:36.600 --> 07:43.200
I don't know how they view broad platform support, but maybe more than one or two Linux

07:43.200 --> 07:44.200
distributions.

07:44.200 --> 07:45.200
I don't know.

07:45.200 --> 07:49.740
Maybe KDE neon, for example, would be good to support, but I really doubt we're going

07:49.740 --> 07:56.520
to see ads inserted in Acadian Live or your Dolphin file manager or console.

07:56.520 --> 07:58.800
I just don't think that's where this is going to go.

07:58.800 --> 08:00.040
Well, watch out.

08:00.040 --> 08:03.440
It seems like they're not just targeting desktop and mobile.

08:03.440 --> 08:09.640
No, their press release explains that their new offering aims to, quote, disrupt the IoT

08:09.640 --> 08:10.640
industry.

08:10.640 --> 08:14.000
lino.com slash lan.

08:14.000 --> 08:16.680
Go there to get $100 in 60 day credit on a new account.

08:16.680 --> 08:20.560
Yeah, you can really try things, and you go there to support the show.

08:20.560 --> 08:22.840
Linode is fast, reliable cloud hosting.

08:22.840 --> 08:23.840
Go try it for yourself.

08:23.840 --> 08:24.840
Go try it for your next project.

08:24.840 --> 08:27.720
It's how we've hosted everything for the last couple of years.

08:27.720 --> 08:31.040
And I've been hearing from some of you that you are concerned about Google booting out

08:31.040 --> 08:33.160
its legacy G Suite users.

08:33.160 --> 08:38.600
Well, maybe now is the time to move away from expensive proprietary cloud storage and switch

08:38.600 --> 08:42.860
to Nextcloud and just use Linode's object storage with it.

08:42.860 --> 08:43.860
It's easy.

08:43.860 --> 08:44.860
It's simple.

08:44.860 --> 08:46.280
It's what we do.

08:46.280 --> 08:49.720
We've been running Nextcloud up there for, I don't know, I guess it's been about two

08:49.720 --> 08:50.720
years.

08:50.720 --> 08:53.640
It's almost one of the very first things we migrated to Linode.

08:53.640 --> 08:59.600
And the real revolution for us was switching the backend storage to object storage.

08:59.600 --> 09:05.520
In previous Nextcloud implementations, we would just slice off a big chunk of disk and

09:05.520 --> 09:07.240
try to keep it under that size.

09:07.240 --> 09:10.640
And if we couldn't because we were working on a project, then Chris was logging in and

09:10.640 --> 09:16.240
he was adding more disk and reconfiguring Nextcloud in the middle of a project.

09:16.240 --> 09:17.360
That was the thing.

09:17.360 --> 09:18.600
That was a real thing.

09:18.600 --> 09:23.520
And since we switched over to object storage, we never hit that anymore.

09:23.520 --> 09:26.960
And I just slice off every few months a bunch of storage to a local box that I have here.

09:26.960 --> 09:29.080
And it works so, so great.

09:29.080 --> 09:34.280
And one of the things I'm really impressed by is how smoothly Linode is rolling out these

09:34.280 --> 09:36.000
MVME storage upgrades.

09:36.000 --> 09:39.120
So I mean, you're getting super fast PCIe storage now.

09:39.120 --> 09:42.240
Just went live in the London data center, I think yesterday.

09:42.240 --> 09:44.800
So these are just getting rolled out faster and faster all the time.

09:44.800 --> 09:48.560
So if you're a performance hound, or if you've got an application that needs a lot of storage

09:48.560 --> 09:52.160
throughput, Linode's team can help you sort through the possibilities for accessing the

09:52.160 --> 09:53.960
power of these new MVME disks.

09:53.960 --> 09:56.160
And they've got 11 data centers around the world.

09:56.160 --> 09:59.980
So you're going to find something that works for you or is close to your customers.

09:59.980 --> 10:02.800
They've been doing this for 18 years and they just keep getting better and better.

10:02.800 --> 10:07.040
And they've got the best customer support with $100, you can really go try it out.

10:07.040 --> 10:10.880
Go pick your distribution of choice or your application stack of choice and just deploy

10:10.880 --> 10:14.680
it and go build something and get started.

10:14.680 --> 10:18.600
Linode.com slash LAN.

10:18.600 --> 10:22.200
And a big thank you to Ting, linux.ting.com.

10:22.200 --> 10:26.760
If you're sick of overpaying for cell service, go see how much you could save and then get

10:26.760 --> 10:30.400
25 bucks off that at linux.ting.com.

10:30.400 --> 10:35.000
I've been a customer since 2013 of Ting and they have been a sponsor since a little bit

10:35.000 --> 10:36.180
after that.

10:36.180 --> 10:40.480
And there's two reasons why I have been a customer and they have been sponsors.

10:40.480 --> 10:43.240
Number one, the value is obvious.

10:43.240 --> 10:45.200
And number two, I like this company.

10:45.200 --> 10:50.480
I like what they're doing and I like how they are pushing the mobile duopolies around.

10:50.480 --> 10:53.960
You see, Ting is an MVNO, so they can offer a ton of value.

10:53.960 --> 10:58.080
They can really focus on the customer relationship and not focus on digging holes in the ground

10:58.080 --> 11:03.100
to stand up towers, you know, and you still get access to those big network towers.

11:03.100 --> 11:07.960
But you deal with Ting and they have nationwide coverage with a great mix of plans with fast

11:07.960 --> 11:10.400
data, LTE and 5G.

11:10.400 --> 11:15.120
And they were recently named the number one carrier by Consumer Reports in 2021.

11:15.120 --> 11:20.600
Their plans are simple and straightforward and it's just a simpler way, a smarter way

11:20.600 --> 11:21.600
to do mobile.

11:21.600 --> 11:26.480
You know, in almost every plan, I think every plan, you'd have to double check though, you're

11:26.480 --> 11:28.480
going to find one that'll work for you though.

11:28.480 --> 11:31.160
Almost every plan should work for you, but I think they're going to have the perfect

11:31.160 --> 11:32.160
plan.

11:32.160 --> 11:37.280
They have unlimited talk and text and it's great for a family or great for a small business.

11:37.280 --> 11:41.000
We have used Ting in the years past when we all were attacking Linux Fest Northwest.

11:41.000 --> 11:42.200
I mean, not in a good way.

11:42.200 --> 11:46.720
Like the whole crew just like descended upon Linux Fest Northwest, Ting and Telegram.

11:46.720 --> 11:49.360
That's how we did everything that year.

11:49.360 --> 11:51.440
It's great for stuff like that too.

11:51.440 --> 11:54.880
So small business, family, or just yourself and you want to save some money.

11:54.880 --> 11:59.540
And every plan gets access to Ting's award winning customer service with nationwide LTE

11:59.540 --> 12:03.360
and 5G coverage and no contracts ever.

12:03.360 --> 12:05.940
It's simple to switch to Ting and pretty much any phone's going to work because of their

12:05.940 --> 12:07.240
wide network support.

12:07.240 --> 12:11.800
So go to linux.ting.com, check your current phone, create an account and pick the plan

12:11.800 --> 12:12.800
that's right for you.

12:12.800 --> 12:14.840
Ting will send you a SIM card.

12:14.840 --> 12:22.520
You pop that in your phone and you get active in just minutes, linux.ting.com.

12:22.520 --> 12:30.320
On Wednesday, Valve officially announced that the Steam Deck will launch on February 25th.

12:30.320 --> 12:32.120
How's this actually going to work though?

12:32.120 --> 12:37.320
Well, it's going to go by the date each user put in their reservation of course.

12:37.320 --> 12:42.280
Starting off with those first lucky few who actually got in before Valve's servers crashed.

12:42.280 --> 12:48.040
On February 25th, the first batch of order invitation emails will be sent out.

12:48.040 --> 12:54.320
And then each person who gets one has just 72 hours to make the actual Deck purchase

12:54.320 --> 12:59.040
before that opportunity moves on to the next lucky person in line.

12:59.040 --> 13:05.680
The most important 72 hours of the year, Liam over at linuxungaming.com has a really good

13:05.680 --> 13:09.960
write up on this and I'm really glad he did because I, I guess I just forgot, but I was

13:09.960 --> 13:14.800
under the impression that I'd placed my order, I'd authorized the full amount.

13:14.800 --> 13:20.140
I didn't realize I was going to have to be checking my email on a specific day, watching

13:20.140 --> 13:25.160
for one of the many emails that I will land no doubt in my updates tab on Gmail.

13:25.160 --> 13:28.960
Now as far as the details, yep, you're going to be looking for the email around the 25th

13:28.960 --> 13:33.840
and then after the 28th, they plan to start sending weekly invitations for more people

13:33.840 --> 13:34.840
to place their order.

13:34.840 --> 13:37.440
So that's actually, that's actually pretty soon.

13:37.440 --> 13:42.960
Seems, seems kind of like Valve's implying they expect things to move reasonably well.

13:42.960 --> 13:48.680
Now behind the scenes, as we see all of that going on, Valve's also been working with developers

13:48.680 --> 13:52.280
to improve the AMD graphics situation on Linux even further.

13:52.280 --> 13:57.180
Of course that benefits the Deck and there's been a lot of work to get more games Steam

13:57.180 --> 14:02.960
Deck verified as well as some additional work has recently gone into the anti-cheat stuff.

14:02.960 --> 14:08.000
But I think the neat thing to see is some new features that the Deck is going to introduce

14:08.000 --> 14:10.840
and one of them is dynamic cloud sync.

14:10.840 --> 14:15.260
It's now live on Steam and Valve's is just the first for any gaming platform currently

14:15.260 --> 14:16.260
in operation.

14:16.260 --> 14:20.440
I don't know about that, Xbox has some pretty good sync stuff, but it does seem to have

14:20.440 --> 14:26.240
one particular use case they've covered that the other platforms don't and that is it does

14:26.240 --> 14:31.380
a dynamic sync when you put the Deck to sleep and then the idea is you can go over to your

14:31.380 --> 14:36.480
PC and resume that same game right where you left off.

14:36.480 --> 14:41.120
Now before you get too excited, we should definitely note that this won't just auto

14:41.120 --> 14:47.660
magically work on existing games, developers will need to patch to support this functionality.

14:47.660 --> 14:49.960
Here's a little more detail on how it works.

14:49.960 --> 14:54.380
When you go put your Deck to sleep, it's going to sneakily connect to the internet and proceed

14:54.380 --> 14:58.760
with the same upload of the save data that it would have done if you'd actually bothered

14:58.760 --> 15:01.000
to quit out of your game.

15:01.000 --> 15:05.800
Then if you hop on over back to your home PC, play a little more and decide, nah I liked

15:05.800 --> 15:10.200
the couch better, move back to your Deck, well the Deck's going to get a notification

15:10.200 --> 15:13.280
that there's some new save files available.

15:13.280 --> 15:17.160
And that's the point that developers have to implement a flag that smartly reloads those

15:17.160 --> 15:21.320
new save files or quits out and restarts the process or whatever they need to do to make

15:21.320 --> 15:23.760
sure that new data gets loaded in.

15:23.760 --> 15:28.920
Oh, the rough life of those who will own both a Steam Deck and a gaming PC.

15:28.920 --> 15:31.520
I feel ya, it's a tough one out there.

15:31.520 --> 15:34.960
