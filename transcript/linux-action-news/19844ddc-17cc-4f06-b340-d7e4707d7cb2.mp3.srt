00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,080
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, our weekly take on Linux and the open source world.

2
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:20,360
This is episode 26, recorded on November 5th, 2017.

3
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:21,360
I'm Chris.

4
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:22,360
And I'm Joe.

5
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:23,360
Hello, Joe.

6
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:27,440
Remember, remember, it is the 5th of November, so watch out for those fireworks.

7
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:30,280
And let's jump into our first news story this week.

8
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:32,400
We've got a roadmap for Plasma Mobile.

9
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:34,880
Yes, and a very sensible one at that.

10
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:42,160
So Sebastian Kuehgler, I think is his name, has blogged about this roadmap.

11
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:47,320
And it just makes total sense that they've got these various stages, prototype first,

12
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:51,200
which they've already got, then a feature phone, then a basic smartphone, and then a

13
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:52,800
featured smartphone.

14
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:56,600
And as usual, there's a very humble tone to it.

15
00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:00,680
It's not trying to say that we're this amazing thing, it's trying to say, we've got this

16
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:01,680
great potential.

17
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:05,240
And if everyone comes and helps and helps shepherd it the way they want, it could be

18
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:06,240
something amazing.

19
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:08,260
Yeah, that's exactly the word I was thinking of.

20
00:01:08,260 --> 00:01:09,260
Also realistic.

21
00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:13,580
They say their development strategy is to build a basic system and platform around their

22
00:01:13,580 --> 00:01:16,100
core values and then extend on that.

23
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:20,040
And when I said realistic, I like their timeline, they're saying we don't have a specific timeline

24
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:22,000
for this roadmap for two main reasons.

25
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,760
For one, it's a participatory project, so we need more help and the more help we get,

26
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:27,760
the faster it'll get done.

27
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:29,480
So that's going to have an impact.

28
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:34,360
Secondly, they say we don't want to deliver half-ass software just because we set a timeline.

29
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:37,440
We want to create quality software to build products upon.

30
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:38,440
Seems pretty realistic.

31
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:40,040
Yeah, very realistic.

32
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:45,800
And one thing that jumped out at me was that they would consider Android app support.

33
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:51,240
Obviously that's way down the line for the kind of the final featured smartphone, but

34
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:54,000
at least they're not dismissing it like Ubuntu did.

35
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,560
Pig-headedly, they would say Shot of Worth was not interested in having Android app support,

36
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:05,200
which okay, would have been harder at the time for Ubuntu phone and now it's getting

37
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:09,040
a little bit easier, but I think that is a very reasonable goal.

38
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:14,760
If you want people to use your system, then you're going to have to have Android app support.

39
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:16,040
Look at Sailfish.

40
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:20,600
That's what has allowed that to become, okay, it's a very small niche, but at least it's

41
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:22,160
starting to slowly take off.

42
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:25,240
And I think that a big part of that is the fact that you can run at least some Android

43
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:26,240
apps on it.

44
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:31,640
Yeah, it seems in 2017 and early 2018, if you're going to ship a mobile product, that's

45
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:32,640
a fundamental must.

46
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:37,440
You have to have that big app ecosystem or no one in the featured smartphone category

47
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,680
is going to want it.

48
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:39,680
Yeah, exactly.

49
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:43,940
I initially started as a skeptic of the Plasma mobile project, but reading through this blog

50
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:48,200
post, which we'll have linked in the show notes at linuxactionnews.com slash 26, I'm

51
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:53,080
on board, and this steady pace of improvement should be just in time for the Purism folks.

52
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:56,160
Well, that's certainly what they're hoping.

53
00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:02,160
So Matthias Klump, who is a PureOS developer at Purism, has blogged about testing Plasma

54
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:07,160
mobile on an i.mx6 test board.

55
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:12,400
And it's all basic stuff, and he says it doesn't run that well, but it's kind of the first

56
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:19,320
step towards actually getting a proper operating system and a good UI running on a device.

57
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:23,840
It looks more tablet-sized rather than phone-sized, but that's not the point of this.

58
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:27,680
This, as I said, is very much the first step.

59
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,200
This is about working out the kinks.

60
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:36,160
This is about getting Kaywin and Wayland working on this thing, getting their Debian testing-based

61
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:38,480
operating system booting on this thing.

62
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:41,040
And it's good to see this progress, really.

63
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:43,680
But there was a bit of a red flag in this blog post.

64
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:44,920
I don't know if you noticed it.

65
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:46,280
No, I don't think I did.

66
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:47,280
What was it?

67
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:54,360
He says, last weekend, I did an initial experiment in getting Plasma mobile working on this i.mx6.

68
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:58,320
Now they've just completed their crowd funder.

69
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:02,000
They've just got their $2 million plus.

70
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:08,160
Why is this guy working on it at the weekend and not during his work days?

71
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:12,160
It seems like the kind of thing that he should be getting paid in his work day to do.

72
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:14,240
Am I reading too much into that?

73
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:19,840
Maybe we could chalk it up to some enthusiasm and say that he was getting all excited about

74
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:23,100
going into work on Monday and getting this thing working.

75
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:24,200
How about that?

76
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:28,160
Maybe or maybe they have flexible work hours or something.

77
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:32,680
It seems a little bit hobbyist, and that worries me.

78
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:36,960
If they're going to do this, if they're going to pull off this huge task of getting a mobile

79
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:44,480
operating system and a phone that's totally independent to market, then they need to really

80
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:49,480
be serious about it and not do it in a kind of amateur hobbyist way.

81
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:50,480
That's true.

82
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:52,240
I completely agree.

83
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:55,400
For all we know, perhaps this kind of experiment is more fun when you can have the hookah pipe

84
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:58,280
with them and they don't have hookah at the office.

85
00:04:58,280 --> 00:04:59,920
Yeah, maybe.

86
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:03,360
Maybe I'm being too picky here.

87
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:07,560
Maybe it's just that it arrived last thing on a Friday afternoon or something and he

88
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:11,320
took it home and carried on working on it.

89
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:12,800
I say stay skeptical.

90
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:13,800
Yeah.

91
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:17,360
Well, let's hope that they are very serious about it because they're going to need to

92
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:18,360
be.

93
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:22,320
The Mozilla Foundation is getting serious about boosting privacy in an upcoming version

94
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:23,880
of Firefox.

95
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:30,080
Version 58, which is expected in January of 2018, is going to have a feature that I'm

96
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,080
looking forward to.

97
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:37,640
Yeah, they're going to block browser canvas fingerprinting, which uses HTML5 specs to

98
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:42,840
basically take a snapshot of the browser and then to assign a unique or potentially unique

99
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:46,120
fingerprint which identifies you.

100
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:50,520
My first question would be, why is this even a thing?

101
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:54,440
Why hasn't this been stopped by Mozilla a long time ago?

102
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:56,380
That's kind of a fascinating story.

103
00:05:56,380 --> 00:06:01,780
This effort was really pioneered by the Tor project for their Tor browser, which is of

104
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:03,920
course built on top of Firefox.

105
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:06,540
It's almost all Firefox.

106
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:10,440
They came up with this solution over there and Mozilla sort of took a look at it and

107
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:14,940
said, yeah, okay, this is something we'd be willing to do.

108
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:16,920
This isn't really going to solve the problem either.

109
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:20,920
I have to be completely honest because there's been talks of blocking this kind of stuff

110
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:26,080
for a while and so trackers are already coming up with new methodologies.

111
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:31,080
They call it a fingerprint because it's essentially pretty statistically close to identifying

112
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:32,080
you.

113
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:37,480
It has a good, good, good chance that it's you and it looks at things like your fonts,

114
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:42,760
your WebGL capabilities, the window size you have, the resolution, it takes all of these

115
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:49,320
attributes that the HTML canvas spec can get access to and it puts it all together, generates

116
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:54,480
a hash and then that hash becomes the fingerprint and they create a database and that gets shared

117
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:56,080
and they get to sell it for money.

118
00:06:56,080 --> 00:07:00,140
It's a real racket we all should have gotten into and then they can use that to track you

119
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:04,360
across different sites, even when you have certain types of tracking turned off.

120
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:09,040
Yeah, and it means that at least in the case of Tor, they can tell who you are potentially

121
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:14,840
because they can compare your Tor usage with your regular Firefox usage, but as you say,

122
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:19,060
this is an arms race, so I think it is important that they've done it, but there are other

123
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:22,240
things that they are going to have to stay on top of as well.

124
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:27,900
Speaking of Tor, just a quick mention for Linux and Mac users of Tor in the audience.

125
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:30,480
Keep an eye out for an update coming soon.

126
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:36,320
Tor M oil, which is a flaw that's been discovered in Tor, is triggered when users click on links

127
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:41,560
that begin with file colon slash slash and this is applicable on Mac OS or Linux.

128
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:45,520
It was applicable on Windows, it's already been patched and it allows the operating system

129
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:49,600
to directly connect to the remote host and bypass the Tor browser.

130
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:54,040
The VR segment was the security research firm that found this and the Tor project says that

131
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:58,320
in the meantime, use the stable release, don't click on file colon slash slash links and

132
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:00,160
keep an eye out for an update very soon.

133
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:04,120
Well, to channel Alan Jude, patch your shit.

134
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:07,560
So Canonical has joined the GNOME Advisory Board.

135
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:13,300
Yeah, the GNOME Foundation announced on November 1st that Canonical, as they put it, the creator

136
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:17,800
of the Ubuntu operating system, has joined the GNOME Foundation Advisory Board and the

137
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:22,080
board now includes companies like Google, the Linux Foundation, the Free Software Foundation

138
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:23,280
and others.

139
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:27,720
This was pretty much inevitable, wasn't it, when they made the switch to GNOME and it's

140
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:33,240
good to see that they are not sort of shirking their responsibility and they are taking this

141
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:38,400
desktop stuff seriously, even though some of us, including me, thought that they weren't

142
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:40,060
going to do that.

143
00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:41,060
So fair play to them.

144
00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:44,920
They are living up to their responsibilities and contributing to GNOME where they should

145
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:45,920
be.

146
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:49,200
In the long term, I'll be looking to see how much influence do they get?

147
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:55,060
Do they get a full representation at the council and will Canonical be able to bring over some

148
00:08:55,060 --> 00:08:59,960
of their user study data from Unity and Unity 8 that they conducted even more recently to

149
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:00,960
GNOME?

150
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:01,960
And could that be helpful in some way?

151
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:05,700
Those are things that were recently sort of hinted at by Will Cook, the Ubuntu desktop

152
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:09,560
manager on Linux Unplugged, and I think that stuff could be pretty useful because it's

153
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:17,040
not often that open source projects pay for real user testing.

154
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:19,120
LinuxAcademy.com slash Unplugged.

155
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:23,160
You go there to support this show and you get a free seven-day trial to a platform that's

156
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:27,680
built by Linux geeks, educators, and developers to teach you more about Linux.

157
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:31,900
It's a full-featured training library with everything you need to learn new skills and

158
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:36,840
advance your career with self-paced in-depth video courses, hands-on scenario-based labs,

159
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:39,960
learning paths, which are content that's been planned by their instructors for specific

160
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:40,960
career tasks.

161
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:44,660
Oh, and real human instructors that are available to help you whenever you need help.

162
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:48,640
And if it's time for a certification, they've got courses created specifically to prepare

163
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:50,160
you for those exams.

164
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:55,600
They also have practice exams and quizzes, flashcards, all kinds of little nuggets they

165
00:09:55,600 --> 00:10:00,120
call them, tiny bits of wisdom if you just want a deep dive on a topic, iOS and Android

166
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:01,480
apps for the go.

167
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:04,280
LinuxAcademy.com slash Unplugged.

168
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:09,200
A platform to learn more about every Linux cloud and DevOps topic.

169
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,400
LinuxAcademy.com slash Unplugged.

170
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:18,440
Okay, let's talk about Bitcoin and an article that jumped out at me this week.

171
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:21,380
Little bit clickbaity, but that doesn't change the facts.

172
00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:26,520
And the headline of this is one Bitcoin transaction now uses as much energy as your house in a

173
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:28,800
week.

174
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:36,160
So doing the maths of how many transactions there are, which is currently around 300,000

175
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:41,700
per day, and looking at the difficulty level and how much electricity is actually needed

176
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:49,080
to mine Bitcoin, which is basically just processing transactions, that's the crux of it, works

177
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:58,280
out at 215 kilowatt hours per transaction, which is ridiculous.

178
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:05,160
In the UK, the average price is about 13 pence per kilowatt hour, which means that each transaction

179
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:12,520
is costing about 30 pounds worth of electricity per transaction, not per Bitcoin mined.

180
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:18,200
And it just goes to show that, okay, I know traditional servers use a lot of power and

181
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:22,840
banks have a lot of servers and all the rest of it, but this is just ridiculous.

182
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:24,240
I'll give you my red flag on this.

183
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:31,960
So this is a piece over at Motherboard, which is quoting a blog post over at DigiCommunist,

184
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:41,800
which is citing a published report by IEA.org, which is the International Energy Agency and

185
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:46,920
their key world energy statistics for 2017, which is only available as a PDF, a 97-page

186
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:48,260
PDF.

187
00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:50,920
And so this is several layers abstracted.

188
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:56,360
And so in this, you lose the nuance of what kind of hardware is doing the mining.

189
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:59,200
Is this based on CPU calculations?

190
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,860
Is this based on GPU?

191
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:02,740
Is this based on ASIC?

192
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:06,600
Is it based on all cryptocurrencies like Litecoin and Ethereum?

193
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:10,360
Is it based only on Bitcoin and which fork of Bitcoin?

194
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:15,200
These are all questions that fundamentally alter the amount of energy that is being consumed

195
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,360
by a miner.

196
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:22,520
And so a GPU miner would use considerably more power than, say, an ASIC miner, which

197
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:26,080
is a purpose-built processor and it's much more efficient.

198
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:30,080
And you have to be very clear on the type of hardware doing the mining to be able to

199
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:32,080
derive the correct amount of power consumption.

200
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:34,000
Well, that is true.

201
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:40,200
But even if it's an order of magnitude less than that, that's still pretty bad.

202
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,200
I would agree.

203
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,760
It's probably still got to be pretty outrageous.

204
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:48,760
Back in my heyday of Bitcoin mining, I literally warmed my garage studio with several Bitcoin

205
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:49,760
miners.

206
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,560
So I converted essentially that into heat.

207
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:55,800
I would have been running heaters anyways, and this allowed me to run less heaters.

208
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:59,640
There is some justification in that, I suppose.

209
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:02,960
This is going to come to a head, though, if cryptocurrencies become even more popular than

210
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:03,960
there are today.

211
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:09,520
I will point out a couple of possible advantages that cryptocurrencies have over other traditional

212
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:11,220
stores of value.

213
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:14,760
Information for cryptocurrencies potentially could be powered by renewable sources.

214
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:21,760
Say here in Washington, predominantly our electricity is rather cheap because it's hydroelectricity.

215
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:27,900
There's no renewable resource for gold or other precious materials that we mine from the Earth

216
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:30,520
that are also considered stores of value.

217
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:35,960
Bitcoin is the one that we have invented ourselves based on math that could actually be powered

218
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:37,040
by the sun.

219
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:38,640
It's potentially possible.

220
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:42,000
But I would think it would have to get popular enough that there would be a market to demand

221
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
that.

222
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Well, that is true.

223
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:48,920
And as I said, all the fiat currencies fly around the world from server to server.

224
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:54,600
And gold hasn't had much to do with currencies for quite a long time now.

225
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:59,880
But I have an instinct that the fiat currencies are using less power than this.

226
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:04,280
Maybe I'm totally off base, and maybe this is a drop in the ocean compared to what the

227
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:07,680
dollar uses or whatever and the various exchanges.

228
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:13,480
But it just seems that in an age where people are very concerned about energy usage and

229
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:18,400
trying to move over to renewables and stuff and cutting energy usage where you can, it

230
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:21,440
just seems like an awful waste of electricity to me.

231
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:26,520
Would it be great if it was also going towards solving big problems like sort of how SETI

232
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:29,000
at home or some of the cancer research?

233
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,680
Yeah, folding at home, that sort of thing.

234
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:31,680
Yeah.

235
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:34,440
And there are actually some cryptocurrencies around that, but they're just not nearly as

236
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:37,240
popular as the ones that just grind out hard math problems.

237
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:38,240
Yeah.

238
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:43,120
It's a shame that that wasn't really thought of in the initial design of Bitcoin because

239
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:47,840
that would have basically alleviated my concerns on this.

240
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:48,840
Maybe there's hope, Joe.

241
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:51,400
In the meantime, we have a zombie among us.

242
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:54,360
SCO versus IBM is not dead yet.

243
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:55,360
Surely.

244
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:56,360
Surely it must be dead.

245
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:57,360
No.

246
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:58,920
It was dead years ago, wasn't it?

247
00:14:58,920 --> 00:14:59,920
No.

248
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:00,920
Nope.

249
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:01,920
This is the story that won't die.

250
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:07,800
It all started off in 2003 and the dispute centers on Project Monterey, a joint effort

251
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:13,180
by SCO and IBM to build a unified Unix capable of running on several different microprocessor

252
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:16,160
architectures, but it eventually went bust.

253
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:19,080
And that's sort of the heart, the crux of the matter.

254
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:20,080
Yeah.

255
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:27,520
So SCO decided to sue IBM over various different aspects of it, saying that IBM had taken proprietary

256
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:33,760
code from them and given it to the Linux community effectively, and that that was undermining

257
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:35,880
their business as a result.

258
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:37,360
And it's just gone back and forth.

259
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:43,280
We've had so many court cases about this and we think that it's over and then it just somehow

260
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:44,980
gets resurrected.

261
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:50,740
This is sort of an interesting one, though, because there is a bit of a possible crack

262
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:54,280
in the system for SCO to wiggle its way in.

263
00:15:54,280 --> 00:16:00,480
It really all hinges on this misappropriation of their original code in a Monterey, which

264
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:04,800
then IBM was able to point to and say, there's existing public code out there.

265
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:09,280
We just contributed code to AIX and Linux that was already public.

266
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:16,040
The problem is, according to SCO, there was never an official or formal partnership or

267
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:20,280
joint venture as a matter of law to do this.

268
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:26,040
They were considered on good business relationship terms, which apparently is a legal thing,

269
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:31,160
but there was no agreement for this code exchange and then it eventually becoming public.

270
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:33,420
It was like a handshake, I guess.

271
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:37,680
But this is only a partial success for SCO, really, because they were trying to pursue

272
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:42,800
three different cases effectively, or three different aspects to the case, and only one

273
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:48,440
of them has been ruled to be worthy of continued challenge.

274
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:52,920
And that is the one about the intellectual property, whereas the kind of bigger one about

275
00:16:52,920 --> 00:17:00,060
torturous interference, which is where they're alleging that IBM deliberately sabotaged

276
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:05,480
their business practices, basically, by giving this code to the Linux community to make it

277
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:13,480
so that Linux was a viable competitor in the enterprise space to SCO's proprietary Unix.

278
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:17,480
That is not going to be allowed to be pursued, probably.

279
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:23,160
So I don't think that this is as huge as some people think it is, basically.

280
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:27,560
I think that it's not going to go away and they might make a few quid from IBM, but I

281
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:31,120
don't think they're going to be going after the likes of Red Hat and making billions of

282
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:32,440
dollars.

283
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:37,020
Continuing from our Department of Legal Stories that you probably don't really want to follow,

284
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:41,920
so we're going to read them for you, there is a bizarre legal action being filed against

285
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:48,080
the Software Freedom Conservancy by, well, a former friend of theirs.

286
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:51,320
Yeah, the Software Freedom Law Center.

287
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:58,680
This is, on the face of it, very strange because the Software Freedom Law Center and Conservancy

288
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:03,360
are often thought of in the same breath, really.

289
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:06,600
They're considered to be almost the same thing by a lot of people.

290
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:07,600
Indeed.

291
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:15,080
The Software Freedom Law Center was the organization that helped launch the Software Freedom Conservancy.

292
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:17,560
They're often thought together.

293
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:21,840
This is the Software Freedom Law Center telling Conservancy that they want their trademark

294
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:25,480
back, which is just very strange.

295
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:32,680
It seems that there are things going on behind the scenes here that are not public.

296
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:38,720
It must be because these people were friends and now they've clearly had a falling out.

297
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:39,960
I completely agree, Joe.

298
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:42,400
It's a week of red flags for you and I.

299
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:47,960
This process was started by the Law Center, by the Software Freedom Law Center, on September

300
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:48,960
22nd.

301
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:52,000
This has been in the works for a little while.

302
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:56,560
There is quite a bit of different theories behind the scenes about what's going on here.

303
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:59,400
I don't know if I'm going to pick a particular theory at this point.

304
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:02,120
I'm still doing my end of the research.

305
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:06,920
This all came out on November 3rd and I find it very surprising.

306
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:10,360
It's bizarre because these two organizations have been so closely linked.

307
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:14,920
They haven't always agreed, especially some of the folks behind the scenes haven't always

308
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:20,960
agreed with each other, but they've generally seen as trying to accomplish the same goal.

309
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:25,700
Keeping in mind that the Software Freedom Law Center filed a petition on September 22nd,

310
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:31,160
you can't help but note that the news of this came out just shortly after the new kernel

311
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:36,920
enforcement statement that the Software Conservancy was strongly behind.

312
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:44,720
The message of this enforcement statement was legal as a last action resort to be initiated

313
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:48,400
only when other community efforts have failed to resolve the problem.

314
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:54,800
That was the kernel developers and the conservancy agreeing that legal enforcement is the last

315
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:59,200
action and we should try to make other things work first, take other avenues.

316
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:02,040
Yeah, there's no way this is a coincidence.

317
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:07,640
The Software Freedom Law Center clearly don't agree with the idea that lawsuits should be

318
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:08,640
the last resort.

319
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:13,800
But I think another thing that is key to this is if you go back to around that same time

320
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:22,280
in September this year, Eben Moglen published a blog post that basically said that organizations

321
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:26,160
like conservancy are pretty much irrelevant now.

322
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:32,640
In this post, he talks about how in the early days of free software, it was quite easy to

323
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:37,340
set up charitable status for these projects.

324
00:20:37,340 --> 00:20:42,320
They were making quite a good living out of that, I think, the Software Freedom Law Center.

325
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:48,620
Then under the Obama administration, the IRS had some staff changes and that made it much

326
00:20:48,620 --> 00:20:52,280
more difficult to get this charitable status.

327
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:58,160
That's why they set up organizations like conservancy to be an umbrella organization

328
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:05,000
to help small free software projects with all the fiscal staff.

329
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:09,120
He's now saying that the IRS staff has changed and now they're much more amenable.

330
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:15,800
It's much easier for a smaller project to have financial independence effectively, helped

331
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:20,640
of course by the Software Freedom Law Center who take their cut or at least get paid to

332
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:23,360
do all the legal work for them.

333
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:28,840
It could just boil down to that, that they want to start making a few quid again now

334
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:29,840
that they can.

335
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:30,840
It's possible.

336
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:31,840
A little competitive edge.

337
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:34,200
I'm not sure I buy that argument.

338
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:36,240
It seems like a good public explanation.

339
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:40,280
I'll give it that, but it doesn't make real sense if you think about it.

340
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:45,280
The Software Freedom Conservancy would even have a place even if all of the IRS policies

341
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:47,460
had lined up in favor of the law center.

342
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:52,400
The reason I say that is you need something that is consistent in the storm and US politics

343
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:59,040
can swing and a Democrat could come into office in four years or in eight years and the IRS

344
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:02,600
policies could realign in a way that was hostile towards open source projects.

345
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:08,000
You need a place like the conservancy to house projects like GIMP, which are over 20 years

346
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:12,360
old and don't need to be subject to the whims of the US political system.

347
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:13,920
Yeah, that is a good point.

348
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:17,520
It just begs the question as what exactly has gone on here?

349
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:21,780
What are the internal politics of these two organizations that have gone from being so

350
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:26,440
cozy to now being so hostile to each other?

351
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:32,000
It just seems very strange to me and I'm sure that we're going to hear more about this over

352
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:36,680
the coming weeks and months because there's a story underneath here and it's going to

353
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:38,760
come out one way or another.

354
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:42,040
Indeed and when there's an interesting development in the story that we think you guys will want
