00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,200
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, our weekly take on Linux and the open source world.

2
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:19,940
This is episode 14, recorded on August 13, 2017.

3
00:00:19,940 --> 00:00:20,940
I'm Chris.

4
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:21,940
And I'm Joe.

5
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:24,180
Hello, Joe, and happy mid-August.

6
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:28,040
We're officially in the mid of the summer months, and there's one thing on everybody's

7
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:33,160
mind right now, and that's solving universal software installation on Linux.

8
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:37,240
Apparently, the biggest problem plaguing our land, and there's been a bit of movement this

9
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:38,240
week.

10
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:44,680
Yes, so it seems that Ikey over at Solus has decided to adopt Snaps, as well as Flatpak,

11
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:50,000
which they were talking about adopting and have, but hasn't really gained much traction

12
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
because there's not much that needs to be Flatpacked.

13
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,840
He's given in finally, and has now accepted that Snaps are going to be part of Solus.

14
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:05,080
Originally, it was going to be in the kind of upcoming future ISO, whereas he's done

15
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:09,360
a lot of work over the weekend, by the looks of things, and it's going to be in the very

16
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,120
next release.

17
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:15,920
Supporting both Flatpaks and Snaps is sort of the obvious solution because they are,

18
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:19,880
as they grow, starting to serve different needs.

19
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:24,640
And what I like about Ikey's implementation for both of them in Solus is they both have

20
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:29,280
full-fledged big-boy sandboxing via their individual technologies.

21
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:30,280
That's a big part of this.

22
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:34,040
Other distributions have implemented various levels of support, but they don't always nail

23
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:35,440
the sandboxing part.

24
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:40,120
And I think there was a fair amount of cross-project collaboration there.

25
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:45,700
I've invited Ikey and Wimpy on Linux Unplugged next Tuesday to sort of give me that sort

26
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:49,160
of picture of it, because I think that might be part of the interesting details here.

27
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:55,760
However, the bigger takeaway here is we're really settling down on these two formats.

28
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:59,760
AppImage, by its very nature, doesn't really need this cross-team collaboration.

29
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:01,600
You can just sort of run AppImages.

30
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:06,480
But this low-level stuff for Flatpaks and Snaps, where there's really built-in proper

31
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:12,440
sandboxing support and there is a community aspect of it to bring in more developers working

32
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:18,120
with these, this is a huge thing for all distributions to sort of adopt and implement correctly.

33
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:21,920
And this would be a model for a lot of them to follow, because if you don't adopt it properly

34
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:26,280
or implement it correctly, you could sort of bungle the whole thing.

35
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:30,920
And the key issues that I see that stand out are where do you draw the line from what you

36
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:35,080
package in your repositories versus what you ship as Flatpaks?

37
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:38,680
And how do the outside projects view it, like the GNOME project?

38
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:42,280
How do they view that relationship and how it should be set up?

39
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:45,240
That's a really deep thing for distributions to think about.

40
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:48,060
And then how do you implement the security, the sandboxing?

41
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:51,360
And I really think Solus has nailed it, and it would be a good model for other distributions

42
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,520
to look at if they're trying to make this decision.

43
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:58,680
Well, yeah, and also you kind of glossed over the community aspect there, but I think that

44
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:03,660
the way they've worked together, the Solus and Ubuntu teams, to make this happen has

45
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:08,120
got to be the model for how other distros are going to do it, because you can't expect

46
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:09,560
them to do this completely alone.

47
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:13,680
And so hopefully going forward, we're going to see more of this collaboration, because

48
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:18,440
if you're going to have a universal package format, you need collaboration.

49
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:19,440
Absolutely.

50
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:24,120
And also, I'd like to see this sort of resolved so we can move on and just start shipping

51
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:30,520
software, you know, and just get people like companies and open source projects to start

52
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:33,160
shipping their software as Snaps or Flatpaks.

53
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:36,980
Yeah, although it's quite telling that in one of the Google Plus posts that Aiki made

54
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:42,160
about this, he said, personally, I think everyone's lost their marbles chasing universal apps

55
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:46,280
as if it's the number one problem we have in Linux, as opposed to the tangible, attractive

56
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:50,280
features to bring developers across and create awesome stuff for our platform.

57
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,840
But hey, whatever.

58
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:56,760
That's easy for Solus to say with their fairly well-maintained repositories where they frequently

59
00:03:56,760 --> 00:04:01,000
update things to make apps like Discord work when there's all of a sudden new dependency.

60
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:06,940
Not all distributions are as diligent with their repository hygiene.

61
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:10,720
And so yeah, I do totally understand where he's coming from.

62
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:15,480
But it's because the problem, I think, isn't as pronounced in Solus as it is in other distributions,

63
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:16,480
in part.

64
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:18,080
And also, in part, because he's right.

65
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:20,960
It isn't the number one problem we're trying to solve right now.

66
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:24,280
But there are companies that have an interest in this.

67
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:28,560
And there are long-term problems that have been nagging Linux for a very long time that

68
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:32,160
people are in positions to solve, and they really want to solve them now.

69
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:34,480
So you kind of have to jump on the bandwagon when it's here.

70
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:35,480
And I think that's what he's done.

71
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:38,040
He's made a really practical choice in how to implement it.

72
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:42,700
And one thing I'll always give the Solus project and Nike specifically, and one of the reasons

73
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:48,620
why it's one of my top contenders as a distribution, is he'll take a strong stance on something.

74
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:55,500
But he is totally willing to take in information, consider that, and then change his position.

75
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:58,760
And every time he's done it, I'm like, yep, that makes a lot of sense.

76
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:02,480
Every single time, it's been like, yeah, that seems like a really clear decision to make,

77
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:03,960
and other people should probably follow that.

78
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:09,320
Yeah, first of all, with Flatpak, it seemed a bit strange, and it was a bit of a U-turn.

79
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:15,480
But he's kind of not afraid to U-turn or flip-flop, whatever you want to call it, if it makes

80
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:16,480
sense.

81
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:20,640
And yeah, that is what makes Solus good, I think, that you've got someone who is willing

82
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:23,560
to change his mind based on new evidence and new thinking.

83
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:29,800
Yeah, and he famously articulated the anti-Flatpak, anti-snap stance on Linux Unplugged a while

84
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:30,800
ago.

85
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,920
And he made a really good cognizant argument against it.

86
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:37,880
And now he's made a really good cognizant argument for it.

87
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:40,340
So I can't wait to talk to him more about it.

88
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:44,360
But now we just wait and see where this actually goes, because we've got to get people shipping

89
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:45,360
software.

90
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,120
And Canonical's playing a role in that.

91
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:52,080
And they're also looking at reshaping their community infrastructure a bit, which may

92
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:55,960
down the road play into some of this, like community adoption of snaps.

93
00:05:55,960 --> 00:06:00,280
Yeah, Popee has been very busy writing blog posts over the last week or so, by the looks

94
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:01,600
of things.

95
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:06,200
The first one we're going to talk about is the Ubuntu Community Hub proposal.

96
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:11,480
And in this blog post, he basically says that the Ubuntu community portal that they've got

97
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:14,320
now is just not up to scratch.

98
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:16,040
It hasn't been maintained very well.

99
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:17,040
It's a bit old.

100
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:20,360
A lot of the information is outdated.

101
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:25,060
And as a result of that, it's hard for people to come into the Ubuntu community.

102
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:28,920
And so he's proposing, well, it's quite a long-winded blog post.

103
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:33,960
But what it essentially amounts to is a discourse forum.

104
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:35,840
Is that too harsh to boil it down?

105
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:38,660
No, I think it's, you know, he's thought a lot about this.

106
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:40,920
And they're thinking a lot about community.

107
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:42,800
And you've boiled it down pretty much correctly.

108
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:46,120
They're proposing they replace the community portal with something that Popee considers

109
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:49,280
more dynamic and collaboratively maintained.

110
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:53,120
They would raise the profile of conversation and content, maybe pull over really great

111
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:56,600
legacy content from some of the places they'd be spinning down.

112
00:06:56,600 --> 00:07:01,240
So really, they're not looking at replacing all their other sites, more like add to them,

113
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:06,120
because things like the well-established Ask Ubuntu or Ubuntu forums wouldn't go anywhere.

114
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:07,840
So this would be more like a supplement to them.

115
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:11,880
But is it not just potentially adding more confusion, yet another place to get information

116
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:12,880
about Ubuntu?

117
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,640
Yeah, I think it could be to a degree.

118
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:19,400
I think also you have to wonder if community hasn't changed a bit online.

119
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:23,920
I think it's less and less common for people to be able to stand up their own silos and

120
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:25,520
have community come to them.

121
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:29,080
I think it's more common now you have to go to the community wherever they're at.

122
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:31,960
And sometimes they're on Mumble.

123
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:33,200
Sometimes they're on Discord.

124
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:34,420
Sometimes they're on Twitter.

125
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:37,200
Sometimes they're on whatever.

126
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,920
The list could go on and on.

127
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:44,640
I just think that there's so many established resources for people, and they are so allergic

128
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:48,280
now to creating new accounts and having yet another password that could get leaked or

129
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:52,800
compromised or yet another thing that's going to email them, that they've sort of settled

130
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,080
in now.

131
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:59,800
And I think it's more about having a beachhead in those areas, like Telegram is another example,

132
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:01,960
and just having a presence there.

133
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:04,640
You must feel this to a degree with your community around late-night Linux.

134
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:09,840
Well, I think that that is somewhat fractured.

135
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:13,160
And it's kind of mostly in the Telegram group, I suppose.

136
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:17,020
But we do have people who don't really hang out there and are more interested in commenting

137
00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:18,740
directly on the website.

138
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:23,800
And I mean, back in Linux lotto days, we had hoped to have one community on the website

139
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:29,160
and try and kind of focus it then and have the comments and email notifications of replies

140
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:30,160
and stuff like that.

141
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,980
But it just didn't really work out that way.

142
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:33,160
Some people want to be on Twitter.

143
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:34,560
Some people want to be on Google+.

144
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:37,320
So you just kind of have to be everywhere, really.

145
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:42,320
It feels like the golden era of the forum or building your own Wiki around your community

146
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:47,000
where you have lots of active contributors is sort of passed as there are bigger fish

147
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,280
out there that people want to spend their time with.

148
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:53,920
But it's not necessarily a wrong approach here.

149
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:57,440
They're essentially saying, well, discourse sort of solves that problem.

150
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,080
Because discourse is commonly used.

151
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:01,160
It's something that a lot of people have accounts with.

152
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:04,160
It's something that they already have familiarity with, so you're not asking them to spend their

153
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:05,780
time to learn something new.

154
00:09:05,780 --> 00:09:08,980
It's something dynamic and modern that people are used to seeing.

155
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:11,440
So I think that's exactly what Popey is going for.

156
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:15,560
And he's thought a lot about this, plus trying to solve other problems like onboarding and

157
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:17,000
communications.

158
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,880
So hopefully this works.

159
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:22,200
I just wonder how much traction it'll actually pick up.

160
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:27,720
Is it just me, or Discord and discourse, are they just too similar and confusing?

161
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:28,720
Very.

162
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:29,720
Yeah, it's so annoying.

163
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:31,400
It feels like namespace collision.

164
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:35,380
I suppose one of the things that could be really great about this is they could see

165
00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:38,940
a re-insurgence of new users with the switch to GNOME.

166
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:44,000
So having the good infrastructure in place as those new people show back up or return

167
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
could be a good timing.

168
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Yeah.

169
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Well, I think things are changing fundamentally.

170
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,400
I mean, they have changed fundamentally.

171
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:54,080
It feels like they really went for it with the phone stuff and convergence, and that

172
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,200
just didn't work.

173
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:59,640
And it's like Shuttleworth picked up the company and just shook it like an Etch-A-Sketch, just

174
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:04,900
totally shook it off and just remade it, basically.

175
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:06,440
And so that's what we're seeing now, aren't we?

176
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:12,520
We're seeing developments in all the different places, and we're finding it was like a huge

177
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:15,600
explosion almost, wasn't it, of the whole project.

178
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,160
And now the dust has settled.

179
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:21,160
I'm using too many metaphors and stuff here, but you know what I mean.

180
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:25,240
Things are shaping out in their own ways, and this is a huge part of it by the looks

181
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:26,240
of things.

182
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:30,960
Meanwhile, development on what is turning into one of the most interesting releases

183
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:35,080
of Ubuntu in many, many years is going on.

184
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:40,260
So all of these big changes, and there's staffing changes, a lot of things you have to imagine

185
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:41,560
behind the scenes are changing.

186
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:44,360
People have roles they've never had before.

187
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:49,320
And all of that's happening while development continues on on what actually seems to be

188
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:53,400
a fairly impressive version of Ubuntu 17.10.

189
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:59,080
And to sort of help solidify that, they're making a call for people to stop by and help

190
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:00,840
them polish the experience.

191
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:08,800
Yeah, the 24th and 25th of August, the Ubuntu Artful Desktop fit and finish sprint.

192
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:14,520
So they're going to be working on this during the day, they're kind of paid developers and

193
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:20,160
people at Canonical, but they're inviting community members to come in in the evening.

194
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:24,400
And there'll be beer, soft drinks and pizza, by the sounds of things.

195
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:29,200
I don't think they want just anyone, I think you've got to be able to offer something to

196
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,200
them.

197
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:35,320
They talk about CSS experts and people who know quite a lot about GNOME Shell and GTK

198
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:36,560
themes and stuff like that.

199
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:41,500
And they're really trying to just, as the name suggests, iron out all the little paper

200
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:46,080
cut bugs, make it as smooth an experience as possible when you install this, because

201
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:48,560
they realize how important this release is.

202
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:54,040
I really encourage you, if you're in the London area, even if you're not an Ubuntu user, consider

203
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:55,040
going.

204
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:59,540
Imagine maybe building a relationship with one of the developers of Ubuntu by helping

205
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:00,680
out with something there.

206
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:02,500
So they have a deadline for filling out the form.

207
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:07,440
It is Friday, August 18th, and you'll need to find the link in our show notes.

208
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:10,600
They don't have a lot of room, so you'll need to fill out that form.

209
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:13,360
And then if you can't make it to, let them know if you do sign up, just to kind of help

210
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:14,720
them out so they can manage all that.

211
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:17,320
I like this a lot.

212
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:22,440
I like this a surprising amount, because I'm racking my brain right now, Joe, and I'm trying

213
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:26,960
to think of any other distribution that I've heard do this, where they'll say, come into

214
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:33,200
our corporate offices, sit down at some computers that we'll set up, and bang on our desktop,

215
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:37,080
just so we can make sure the fit and finish is as top-notch as possible.

216
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:38,080
Have you ever heard of any other...

217
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:42,520
I've heard of Microsoft and Apple doing this, but I've never heard of a distribution doing

218
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:43,520
this.

219
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:46,680
Well, isn't that because the likes of Red Hat would pay people to do it, rather than

220
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:48,720
just giving them some pizza and beer?

221
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:49,720
Maybe, yeah.

222
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:50,760
Maybe they would hire a group.

223
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:55,260
They would probably go through some sort of contracting agency that would go out and hire

224
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:57,480
people for a temporary 30-day job.

225
00:12:57,480 --> 00:13:00,880
I mean, they would probably be very corporate about it, where this is more like, come and

226
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:03,840
have a beer, and eat some pizza, and bang on GNOME for us.

227
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:07,440
So if you have a little GNOME shell skills, or even CSS, because, I mean, let's be honest,

228
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:11,240
that's what these themes are made out of, and of course, you got to probably be a little

229
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:15,360
familiar with Linux, because it's not so much about total new user experience as it is the

230
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:18,160
refinement of a professional desktop.

231
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:22,760
I think it's a great idea, and I'd love, if anybody goes, I'd love for them to let me

232
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:28,120
know how it went, because there's some things there in Ubuntu 17.10 that I think are going

233
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:29,120
to be game changers.

234
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:32,000
I can't wait to review this distribution.

235
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:37,600
There's, for me personally, big stuff landing in Ubuntu 17.10.

236
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:43,720
And I've talked about it before, but for one of them, I have to repeat, I'm so thrilled

237
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:51,120
that they are working on proper hardware accelerated video playback on the Linux desktop, and they're

238
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:55,820
doing it by working with the low-level codecs, patching that stuff.

239
00:13:55,820 --> 00:13:58,240
They're working with Chromium, like Chromium 60.

240
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:05,160
They're enabling video acceleration, and you can see a 50% savings in CPU overhead using

241
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:06,520
the VA API.

242
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:12,880
Now, not only does that translate to better battery savings, but for me, the biggest thing

243
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:17,560
is it just means my fan runs less, and it makes my laptop less annoying, and my laptop

244
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:19,680
gets less hot.

245
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:25,280
And if you have a Haswell or newer CPU, it's going to work.

246
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:30,160
And you're going to install 17.10, and you're going to have a 50% CPU reduction in something

247
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:34,240
you've maybe done, like watch a YouTube video on a daily basis.

248
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:35,360
This is a huge benefit.

249
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:37,600
Now, of course, it's not going to be perfect.

250
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:41,880
It's going to take probably several releases of working on this, but I can't wait for this

251
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:45,280
to land in 17.10, and they're sending the code upstream, too.

252
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:46,400
They're sending it upstream.

253
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:51,240
So this could land in Fedora, this could land on all the other desktops out there, and it

254
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:55,400
would be massive for battery life on Linux, and it's going to be massive for 4K video

255
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:56,400
playback.

256
00:14:56,400 --> 00:15:00,560
What I really like about this, and we're kind of taking this info this week from the Ubuntu

257
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:07,480
desktop weekly update, is if you look at the screenshot, not only is it probably a laptop

258
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:12,120
that's 720p by the looks of things, it's only got four gigs of RAM, so they're not doing

259
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:16,680
this on huge powerhouse machines, they're doing it on realistic machines that people

260
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:17,680
actually have.

261
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:18,680
Yeah.

262
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:23,520
They also are adding patches, and they're sending these upstream, that will enable or

263
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:28,040
disable network connectivity, which I think is then the little checker, I think that's

264
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:29,040
just brilliant.

265
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:31,880
And it's going to be a little toggle switch in privacy settings of GNOME Control Center

266
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:34,680
to allow you to turn on or off the connectivity checker.

267
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:40,000
Yeah, you know, we talked about at length when they first announced that they were ditching

268
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,400
Unity and going to GNOME, and I was very cynical about it.

269
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:48,480
I said that they're basically abandoning the desktop, and people said, well, hopefully

270
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,560
it's going to make GNOME better as a result.

271
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:54,400
And I was very skeptical of that, but here we are.

272
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:55,400
The proof is here.

273
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:57,120
They already are contributing to GNOME.

274
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:59,680
They're making it better for everyone.

275
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:04,100
We haven't even touched on the patches that they've done to PulseAudio, which I think

276
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:08,820
are pretty solid, and the fixes to Bluetooth, which are also all upstream stuff.

277
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:10,800
So yeah, I'm very happy with this.

278
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:15,280
I'm looking forward to trying out 1710, and I'm really hoping to see other distributions

279
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:17,920
pick up some of this upstream code and ship it.

280
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:27,440
A 50% reduction in CPU is just such a huge win for just upgrading your free desktop.

Go there to support the show and sign up for a free seven-day trial.

283
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:36,580
It's a platform to learn about Linux, everything from the low-level stuff up to the high-level

284
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:42,840
stuff that you can really boost your resume, AWS, Azure, OpenStack, which is an incredible

285
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:46,620
topic or learning to develop like PHP or Ruby.

286
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:50,200
What I really like about Linux Academy is they'll work with your busy schedule.

287
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:54,180
And one of the problems when you're super busy with self-paced learning is that every

288
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:57,520
now and then you just start slipping.

289
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:59,220
It's a willpower thing.

290
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:03,360
And what I love about Linux Academy is they have these gentle ways to get you back on

291
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:04,360
track.

292
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:07,020
They put you in a slow and steady pace to win the race.

293
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:12,520
It's a perfectly fine-tuned system that I can go in and adjust depending on what I have

294
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:14,240
going on that week.

295
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:17,820
And it allows me to stick to goals for learning.

296
00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:21,440
They also have content plans specifically for getting your certs or particular career

297
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:26,520
track and a community stacked full of Jupyter broadcasting members, LinuxAcademy.com slash

And thanks to Linux Academy for sponsoring Linux Action News, LinuxAcademy.com slash Unplugged.

301
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:39,840
Okay, let's talk about Nextcloud.

302
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:42,080
We haven't spoken about them for a while.

303
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:49,260
And this week they announced a partnership with various education companies and organizations.

304
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:55,960
I think the most interesting one is Moodle, which is a platform used by universities and

305
00:17:55,960 --> 00:18:01,600
colleges all over the world, and they say more than 80 million users.

306
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:06,320
And so it's effectively just apps for Nextcloud, which anyone can install.

307
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:11,620
But they've been working hard with these various organizations to integrate stuff really well.

308
00:18:11,620 --> 00:18:16,040
And it just seems like such a logical step for them, doesn't it, to push into education?

309
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:19,400
Because that is a guaranteed market for what they're trying to do.

310
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:21,760
Yeah, that does seem like a really great step for them.

311
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:26,960
They've also worked with Moodle to integrate authentication on the Moodle side of things.

312
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:28,600
So that's pretty great.

313
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:30,040
Stop and think about that for a second.

314
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:36,080
That means Nextcloud can plug into all these existing established Moodle user databases.

315
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:39,320
So you install an app on your Moodle.

316
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:41,320
That's pretty funny, actually.

317
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:46,600
I bet it gets old if you work with Moodle, but for somebody who doesn't, that's funny.

318
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:47,600
So you have this new app.

319
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:51,640
Then you can offer users the ability to access files from Nextcloud.

320
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:55,200
You can also then manage the sharing rights from within Moodle.

321
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,900
That's big, I think.

322
00:18:56,900 --> 00:19:00,660
And if you look at the list here, you have five new apps that were created specifically

323
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:04,520
as part of this collaboration between Nextcloud and these partners.

324
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:05,920
It's a big deal for Nextcloud.

325
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:09,200
And you can go get these apps individually with your existing installation, because they're

326
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:13,160
open source and they're up in that app store, quote unquote.

327
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:17,520
Or you can go get the bundle, which I think is also really smart, because then in the

328
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:20,160
education market, it's something they can wrap their head around and just start deploying.

329
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:22,640
Yeah, and it kind of makes sense from a business point of view.

330
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:25,480
If they want to keep everything open source, they don't have that freemium model that they

331
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:30,080
used to have, they need to offer support and hosting and stuff.

332
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:33,440
And education is a good sell for that, isn't it?

333
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:34,440
Yeah, absolutely.

334
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:38,260
And if you're going to be looking at Moodle and Nextcloud together, why not view them

335
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:43,640
in the new version of Firefox, version 55, which is the one I'm officially excited about,

336
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:44,640
Joe.

337
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:46,120
Yeah, because now we've got cool web VR.

338
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:47,400
Oh, no, hang on.

339
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:48,400
That's on Windows.

340
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:49,400
Oh, wait.

341
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:50,400
Yeah.

342
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:56,000
But we have got better performance and just general improvements across the board.

343
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,120
I mean, I've tried this out.

344
00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:01,920
It's not in Ubuntu 16.04 yet, so I had to just download the tar and extract it and run

345
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:02,920
it.

346
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:08,160
And just instantly, on my i3 laptop, it was just way faster at everything.

347
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:09,160
Yep.

348
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:11,040
My experience as well, much, much faster.

349
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:15,120
And I'm using only the plugins that work with electrolysis.

350
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:18,120
So that's part of, I think, why it's working really fast for me.

351
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:22,680
I was digging around on hacks.mozilla.org, and I'll try to link this in the show notes.

352
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:23,680
Holy crap, Joe.

353
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:25,160
Holy, holy smokes.

354
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:30,040
This is amazing work that they've been doing, and it's the progress of a bunch of various

355
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:35,920
different projects coming together inside Mozilla and landing in version 55 of Firefox.

356
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:40,440
And it means all kinds of things are faster at every single level of Firefox.

357
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:44,760
So we know a couple of big name things, but it's like 100 little things, too.

358
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:47,920
And I'll have that linked in the show notes if you want to geek out on that.

359
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:49,120
It's pretty cool.

360
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:54,800
But for me, I think the big takeaway feature that I'm a really big fan of is they've made

361
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:58,160
the Flash plugin click to activate by default.

362
00:20:58,160 --> 00:20:59,720
That's long, long overdue.

363
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:00,720
Yeah.

364
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:04,240
And you could always do with an extension, but I always end up with tons of extensions,

365
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:06,080
so it's nice to just have it baked right in.

366
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:09,600
And the next versions of Firefox, we're going to have a couple of new versions landing over

367
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:11,280
the next few months.

368
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:17,320
And they're also looking pretty great, including a new UI, so literally pretty great.

369
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:21,200
Version 57 of Firefox is slated to be released sometime in November.

370
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:24,440
It'll be the biggest user-facing change, just the one all the users are going to end up

371
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:25,440
talking about.

372
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:28,680
It's going to ship the new Photon UI, which you can actually get your hands on if you

373
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:29,800
dig around.

374
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:32,320
And that should probably get a lot of people talking about Firefox.

375
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:37,160
Yeah, it's in the nightly on Android and on the desktop, and I've tried them both.

376
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:42,700
And the mobile one, it doesn't look massively different, but the desktop just feels much

377
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:43,940
more modern, really.

378
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:46,080
Just everything about it is a little bit more modern.

379
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:52,000
And one of the features that wasn't in the version of 55 that I tried, which is strangely

380
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:57,280
rolling out to users on a kind of case-by-case basis, I'm not exactly sure what's happening

381
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:58,280
with that.

382
00:21:58,280 --> 00:22:05,100
But on the 57 nightly, you've got this screenshot within Firefox button.

383
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:08,000
And so it's right up there on the top right next to downloads and stuff.

384
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:12,840
And you click that, and then you can select the area of the screen that you want, including

385
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:15,160
if you want to scroll way down.

386
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:20,320
And so you can take a huge, long, thin screenshot of a forum thread or something like that.

387
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:24,400
And that's baked right into Firefox, which is a good feature as well, I think.

388
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:28,480
It saves you having to print screen and then open it with GIMP and then crop it.

389
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:30,100
It's kind of all right there.

390
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:31,100
That is really cool.

391
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:32,100
I'll play with that.

392
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:38,800
Now, I got to also say, I've been getting a few emails, and they're along the lines

393
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:45,640
of, once 57 ships, I got to switch to Chrome, because the Zool-based add-on that I have

394
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:47,560
isn't getting replaced.

395
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:49,600
And it won't work with 57.

396
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:52,280
And a year ago, they made a Chrome version.

397
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:53,360
And so I've been eyeballing that.

398
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:54,920
And this is a common story.

399
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:56,740
And I could see it happening to me too.

400
00:22:56,740 --> 00:23:01,120
So 57 will also be a divisive release, because there are people that think that's their stake

401
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:05,520
in the ground is once the Zool-based add-ons are discontinued, I'm out.

402
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:06,520
Yeah.

403
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:08,160
It's going to be real crunch time, isn't it?

404
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:10,920
Because at the moment, the developers don't have to do that.

405
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:17,000
Because although the new web extensions are enabled in 55, they're not mandatory.

406
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,600
Whereas once we get to 57, that's it.

407
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:24,880
So maybe at that point, they'll actually develop the new extensions.

408
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:27,840
But I'm kind of not holding my breath for a lot of them.

409
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:30,260
But there's kind of a bigger point here.

410
00:23:30,260 --> 00:23:35,020
We've been talking about what Mozilla have been up to for the last five, six weeks.

411
00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:41,260
And it seems like, much like Ubuntu, when they cut the dead weight of the mobile thing,

412
00:23:41,260 --> 00:23:44,280
in the case of Mozilla, it was Firefox OS.

413
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:46,880
And with Ubuntu, it was Ubuntu Touch and Convergence.

414
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:51,840
It was kind of like, once they accepted defeat on that, it cut the dead weight and allowed

415
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:54,760
them to progress in other areas.

416
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:57,820
Am I just constructing a narrative here that doesn't exist?

417
00:23:57,820 --> 00:23:59,800
Am I reading too much into it?

418
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:02,320
If it's a narrative you're constructing, it's one that I agree with.

419
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:04,060
It seems to be the case, for sure.

420
00:24:04,060 --> 00:24:08,560
And I have to wonder, from a team standpoint, imagine you're sinking your heart and soul

421
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:09,880
into a project.

422
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:11,580
And it's not taking off.

423
00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:13,620
It's not doing particularly great.

424
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:16,400
But you just keep grinding away at it.

425
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:20,960
And you start to feel the inevitability of defeat.

426
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:23,640
Then all of a sudden, things shift.

427
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:27,380
And you're now working on the thing that you originally signed up at that company to work

428
00:24:27,380 --> 00:24:31,540
for, what you have been passionate about all along, what brought you to that company in

429
00:24:31,540 --> 00:24:34,340
the first place and got you notoriety.

430
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:35,640
And now you're back working on that.

431
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:37,920
And you've been thinking about that for ages in the back of your mind.

432
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:40,120
Man, if I could only get back to that project, I would do this.

433
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:41,120
I would do this.

434
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:42,120
I would do this.

435
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:44,800
And well, man, now that we learned how to do that on a super low memory profile, I would

436
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:46,900
love to bake that back in.

437
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:48,540
And then things change.

438
00:24:48,540 --> 00:24:51,840
And all of a sudden, you've been unleashed and you're working on your project again.

439
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:59,240
Maybe there's a bit of like a, finally, you've released us sort of a swing back and a huge

440
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:02,080
new burst of motivation to really bang this stuff out.

441
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:06,720
And there's essentially like a greater competitiveness now than they seem to have ever had.

442
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:09,400
And it's got to be as a result of that, at least to a degree.

443
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:10,400
I have to agree.

444
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,400
Yeah.

445
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:12,400
All right.

446
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:17,880
Well, before we move off Firefox, let's quickly mention that Epiphany, or is it GNOME web?

447
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:18,880
I don't know.

448
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:24,160
The browser that is the GNOME default, the new version of that is going to support Firefox

449
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:25,160
sync.

450
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:26,480
So that's pretty cool.

451
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:27,480
It really is.

452
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:32,480
It's a nice lightweight web kit browser on the Linux desktop, but take advantage of Firefox

453
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:35,760
sync and including the syncing of tabs and passwords.

454
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:39,040
And it'll even sync with Firefox, even the mobile version of Firefox.

455
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:42,360
This is going to be a super great feature built into Epiphany.

456
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:46,800
And also, we have a link in the show notes of this story, dig around on their blog.

457
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:53,080
They also have a good write up of some web kit woes on Linux and which distributions

458
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:58,040
like Arch and Fedora are getting it right and which distributions are potentially shipping

459
00:25:58,040 --> 00:26:00,240
really bad code like OpenSUSE.

460
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:01,240
All that's in the blog too.

461
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:02,240
It's linked in the show notes.

462
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:03,240
All right.

463
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:07,400
Well, let's round things off and talk about Android 8, which is going to be released pretty

464
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:09,520
soon by the looks of things.

465
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:14,680
And one feature that they're going to introduce, which I think is really important, is streaming

466
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:16,560
OS updates.

467
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:24,040
So at the moment to get your OTA updates with Android, it downloads it to the user partition

468
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:27,360
and then copies it over the system partition.

469
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:33,620
And so if your phone is full of photos and videos and apps and doesn't have enough space

470
00:26:33,620 --> 00:26:39,120
for the huge binary that it needs to download, then your OTA update won't work.

471
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:41,600
And then you're stuck using an old vulnerable version.

472
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:44,920
That's if you get an update in the first place.

473
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:52,000
Whereas now it's going to effectively just download it straight to that system partition,

474
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:58,160
but only if you are using certain devices that support this A-B partition layout.

475
00:26:58,160 --> 00:26:59,160
Right.

476
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:03,520
And the other thing too that these those, it's not just like the gig image that it downloads

477
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:06,080
or even the 200 megabyte image that it downloads.

478
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:09,040
It's that when it extracts it, then it needs an additional space.

479
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:12,080
So it needs the compressed image space and it needs to extract it.

480
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:16,160
And so existing Android has a system partition and like a cache partition.

481
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:20,880
And that's where it's just a set of reserved space on your phone sitting there waiting

482
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:24,500
to be used for updates, which most Android phones don't even get these updates.

483
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:26,580
And it just sits there wasting space.

484
00:27:26,580 --> 00:27:31,500
So starting with Android 7, Google introduced a new feature called seamless updates, which

485
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:34,400
created a system A and a system B partition.

486
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:38,300
As you'd expect, only the Pixel supports this at this time for some reason.

487
00:27:38,300 --> 00:27:44,240
And then starting with version 8, that A-B partition swap update where you update partition

488
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:47,460
B while you're running from partition A and then you swap them at boot time.

489
00:27:47,460 --> 00:27:49,320
And if there's a failure, you just swap back.

490
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:52,760
We've heard Fedora and Canonical talking about this a lot recently too.

491
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:56,280
But they're going to start streaming updates, Joe, to that second partition at the block

492
00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:57,280
level.

493
00:27:57,280 --> 00:28:02,400
Like block updates over the internet, I would imagine compressed right into this partition,

494
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:05,080
no big image to download and extract.

495
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:09,820
So they're going to be able to remove using that cache partition altogether.

496
00:28:09,820 --> 00:28:11,600
And it'll just be block by block.

497
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:13,000
It'll come down to your phone.

498
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:16,760
And when it's all settled in the right order, you'll reboot and you'll be running from a

499
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:17,760
new partition.

500
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:19,840
DD over the network, essentially.

501
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:20,840
Yeah.

502
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:21,840
Yeah, really.

503
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:26,680
And they're going to actually backport it to 7.0 as well.

504
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:30,400
Mostly I would imagine to upgrade Pixel phones because, again, only the Pixel support this.

505
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:33,000
But an OEM could do this if they wanted to.

506
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:36,680
It's built into 7.0 and it's going to be extended in Android 8.0.

507
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:40,480
But the big question is, why are none of the OEMs doing this?

508
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:46,840
Oh, that's the long, dark tunnel that is the debate about Android OEMs and who's responsible

509
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:51,960
for what and how long they should be supported, at least at the end of the day, as I love

510
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:54,420
to say.

511
00:28:54,420 --> 00:28:59,400
This is going to make it possible and safer to upgrade these phones if vendors choose

512
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:00,580
to do it.

513
00:29:00,580 --> 00:29:04,640
If the vendors choose to take advantage of it, they now have a better mechanism in place

514
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:05,800
to facilitate it.

515
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:07,360
That seems like a good thing.

516
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:10,920
And if you're buying a Pixel, you've got more bulletproof updates.

517
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:12,540
That seems like a good thing.

518
00:29:12,540 --> 00:29:14,780
It does sort of put a little salt in the wound.

519
00:29:14,780 --> 00:29:19,240
There was no way for me to read this article and not be sort of bitter about it because

520
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:25,060
this is a great, safe way to upgrade a phone OS, but the vast, vast majority of the users

521
00:29:25,060 --> 00:29:26,060
will never get it.

522
00:29:26,060 --> 00:29:27,060
Yeah.

523
00:29:27,060 --> 00:29:28,880
Well, you never know.

524
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:33,200
Now that we've got this extra feature of the streaming updates, maybe more OEMs will take

525
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:34,200
it on board.

526
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:35,200
And you know what?

527
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:39,720
For our audience, it would really be good enough if the ROM community took it on because

528
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:43,840
this could be just an awesome way for ROMs to update, especially ones that frequently

529
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:44,840
update.

530
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:47,240
And every time you update, there's a chance of a problem.

531
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:53,720
So if you can build a safer mechanism, the biggest users of this might actually be the

532
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:54,720
ROM community.

533
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:55,960
And that could be good, too.

534
00:29:55,960 --> 00:30:00,560
Yeah, every time I flash a new nightly update, I hold my breath.

535
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:01,560
Right?

536
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:03,440
Wouldn't that be nice if that was a little more stress-free?

537
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:05,680
And this could achieve that.

538
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:09,800
Even if your Samsungs and your Hawaii's and your HTCs aren't getting the updates they

539
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:15,360
need, at least guys like Joe are.

540
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:16,360
Very good, Joe.

541
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:20,120

And so next week's episode will be a day late because I'm going to be going to our camp

548
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:47,600
and won't be around to record as we normally do on Sunday.

549
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:50,600
So look out for that basically a day later than normal.

550
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:55,400
Yeah, and if you have a question for Joe, go over to late night Linux website and submit

551
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:58,680
a question for those guys because you guys are seeking questions right now for odd camp.

552
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:00,560
So put a plug in for that too.

553
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:04,400
And catch us next Monday, even if it's a day late, maybe it'll be Tuesday, but catch us

554
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:08,520
next week for our weekly take on Linux and open source news.

555
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:09,960
I'm at Chris LAS.

556
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:11,520
I'm at Joe Rissington.

557
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:14,120
Thank you for joining us and we'll see you next week.

558
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:32,520
