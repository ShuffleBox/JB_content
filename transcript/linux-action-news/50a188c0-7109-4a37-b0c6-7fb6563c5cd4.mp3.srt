00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,560
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, episode 110 recorded on June 16th, 2019.

2
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:09,560
I'm Chris.

3
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:10,560
And I'm Joe.

4
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:11,560
Hello, Joe.

5
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:12,680
Good to be connected with you.

6
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:18,600
And we start out this week with Mozilla's plans to offer a premium subscription, potentially

7
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:19,800
inside of Firefox.

8
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:24,880
Yeah, this is something that was rumored kind of just before we recorded last week, but

9
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:28,480
I didn't have any official confirmation, so I dismissed it.

10
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:31,120
But sure enough, Mozilla have now confirmed this.

11
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:32,760
We don't have many details.

12
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:37,080
All we know is that there will be some sort of subscription service.

13
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:39,420
Firefox will continue to be free.

14
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:45,320
It's likely to be the VPN service that they've already been promoting and possibly some other

15
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:46,320
stuff.

16
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:50,440
Well, what we know at this point is Mozilla seems to be getting ready, at least in the

17
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:57,240
early stages of offering a plan, a subscription, some sort of reoccurring bill that would allow

18
00:00:57,240 --> 00:01:02,500
users to access certain premium features inside Firefox.

19
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:05,400
One could imagine a VPN service or cloud storage.

20
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:09,760
It's really kind of unclear at this point what the service will offer.

21
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:15,040
But Mozilla's CEO, Chris Beard, mentioned that both a VPN service and a cloud storage

22
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:17,320
service would be a safe bet.

23
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:22,920
And Mozilla seems intent on offering a subscription starting in October of this year.

24
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:27,140
So this is yet another example of them preparing for the future when the search revenue dries

25
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:28,140
up.

26
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:34,300
And I've seen quite a lot of cynicism about this, because Mozilla have got loads of money.

27
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:36,000
They've got loads coming in at the moment.

28
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,360
But you have to think long term as an organization.

29
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:42,720
And that search revenue will dry up eventually.

30
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:43,880
We don't know when that's going to be.

31
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:45,080
Is it going to be two years?

32
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:46,080
Is it going to be five years?

33
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:47,400
Is it going to be 10 years?

34
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:48,520
Who knows?

35
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:53,400
But it's not a great idea to wait until your revenue stream dries up and then think of

36
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:55,040
the new one.

37
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:57,560
It's kind of a good idea to have them cross over.

38
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:59,520
So I'm all in favor of this.

39
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:02,640
Some people are really outraged about it and saying, well, that's it, I'm moving off to

40
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,280
Brave or whatever.

41
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:06,080
But it's going to be totally optional.

42
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:08,080
I'm probably not going to opt into it.

43
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:13,200
But if a few hundred thousand people do, a few thousand people, whatever, then at least

44
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,000
there's some revenue coming in for them.

45
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Yeah, absolutely.

46
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:21,280
I feel like what's setting some people off might be the language Mozilla is already using

47
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,560
before they've even launched the service.

48
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:28,240
I get where they're coming from, but Mozilla is trying to reassure everyone and they write

49
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:34,520
a high performing, free and private by default Firefox will always continue to be the central

50
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:37,800
element to our core service offering.

51
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:40,440
That's according to the senior vice president of Firefox.

52
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:42,600
He released that in a statement.

53
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:44,680
I actually think it's a brilliant move.

54
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:50,080
Not only does it make them directly responsible for revenue generation so they don't have

55
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:54,400
to depend on a partner, which I think is very critical for their long term sustainability,

56
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:58,740
but to me it seems like they're clearly leveraging a strength of their brand.

57
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:04,200
People trust Mozilla and Firefox to have the best interest of the web and individual privacy

58
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:06,480
and security in mind.

59
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:09,240
And I appreciate sort of a slow approach, a slow ramp up.

60
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:12,640
They're starting with VPN services, they're starting in certain areas, but you can kind

61
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:16,400
of get the feeling, especially when you look at the broader picture here, they're really

62
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,120
building towards something else.

63
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:23,920
And to that end, Joe, that's why I think they're embarking on this total rebrand process and

64
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:26,800
really trying to come up with a new central brand for Firefox.

65
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:31,680
And they're now talking about Firefox not as a web browser, but Firefox as a quote unquote

66
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:32,680
brand.

67
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:36,480
It's a brand that is an umbrella of services now.

68
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:41,560
Yeah, there was a post on the Mozilla blog this week, Firefox, the evolution of a brand.

69
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:48,000
And it talks about the change in visual identity, which didn't they just change their logo of

70
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,120
last year, but whatever.

71
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:51,120
It's more than that, isn't it?

72
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:57,480
It is more about making Firefox itself be a brand, as you said, beyond just the browser.

73
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:01,080
And that seems quite smart to me because Firefox is a name that a lot of people know.

74
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:04,840
They might be using Chrome, but they're at least aware of Firefox.

75
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:12,480
And if they can expand that brand to encompass these services, then that's a pretty smart

76
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:13,720
move by them, I think.

77
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:14,720
I think that's just it.

78
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:18,760
They need something outside the browser that still takes advantage of what they would say

79
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:21,080
is their brand equity.

80
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:25,520
They write on their blog, the Firefox you've always known as a browser is stretching to

81
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:32,040
cover a family of products and services, united by putting you and your privacy first.

82
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:36,840
Now Firefox has a new look to support its evolving product line.

83
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:44,380
Today we're introducing the Firefox parent brand, an icon representing the entire family

84
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:46,260
of products.

85
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:48,960
What that family includes, you got to wait and see.

86
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:54,560
Well, there's already some things, Firefox send, Firefox monitor, Firefox lockwise, which

87
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:59,560
was originally lockbox, there must have been some issue with trademarks there or something,

88
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:05,480
and obviously the Firefox browser, and anything else they come up with with this VPN service

89
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:07,000
or whatever.

90
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,720
And it's all using the same brand identity.

91
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:12,120
And I think it looks all right, really.

92
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:17,240
Some people have said that it looks horrible and looks like some other stuff, but it seems

93
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:18,240
all right to me.

94
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,520
Unicorn puke, I think I've heard.

95
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,360
Yeah, I don't think it's that.

96
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,200
People are saying that it's too rainbowy or whatever, but-

97
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:25,760
It's missing a few colors of the rainbow, Joe.

98
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:26,760
It's not that rainbowy.

99
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:30,120
There's a few key colors missing from those logos.

100
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:33,960
Well, yeah, exactly.

101
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:38,120
There's no green in it, for example.

102
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:41,980
I honestly think that it looks quite modern and stuff.

103
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:46,060
We've gone through logo changes recently, and no one likes it.

104
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:51,400
No one likes a refreshed brand, but if you don't change your logos ever, then you end

105
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:53,040
up looking dated.

106
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:58,120
And so, I don't know, I'm not a hugely visual person, but I think that this looks all right

107
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:59,120
to me.

108
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,120
Yeah.

109
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:03,440
And when you look at where they're going with all of this, to me, I can't help but think

110
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,080
this is the right way to do it.

111
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:10,360
This is a mature, you build on top of user trust and on top of brand trust, and you layer

112
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:16,300
on services that can directly finance a bigger, broader mission.

113
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:21,240
You compare that with Librem 1, which is really kind of a haphazard rush job, where they took

114
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:26,020
a bunch of open source projects, rebranded them without permission, threw them all on

115
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:31,880
a single digital ocean droplet and said, privacy and security, everybody, without really having

116
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:35,880
any kind of market trust, where Mozilla is doing the exact opposite.

117
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:40,280
Yeah, you can have your issues with Mozilla's political stances or some of the things they've

118
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:43,920
done in the past, or even the business deals they've made.

119
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:50,180
But you can't really argue with the mission they've been on to make the web more open.

120
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:55,040
And you really can't argue with the fact that they have really taken user privacy and

121
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,840
security seriously.

122
00:06:56,840 --> 00:07:00,940
It's clear from the recent releases of Firefox, and it's been clear from the communications

123
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:02,280
from the company.

124
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:06,560
And instead of it just being some company that's been around for a couple of years,

125
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,080
this is Mozilla.

126
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:13,260
They really have a shot here at making something unique, private and secure.

127
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:18,720
As an on and off Firefox user and a long time fan of what Mozilla is trying to do, I'm ready

128
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:21,520
to directly finance their mission.

129
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:25,880
That's something I can get behind, not for tribalism signaling or because I want everybody

130
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:31,400
to think I'm all in on privacy and security, but just because I believe in the long term

131
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:34,400
mission and their track record.

132
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,520
And that that's a big thing here, the track record.

133
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:39,720
Well, I don't think I'm going to contribute to this, but I'm going to continue to use

134
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:40,720
Firefox.

135
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:44,840
I'm going to visit all the different websites with Firefox and send my message that way

136
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:47,360
that Firefox is not irrelevant.

137
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:53,320
And if enough of us continue to use it, then it will stay around, hopefully.

138
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:58,440
And I think a small percentage of users will go for this subscription service.

139
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:01,560
And hopefully that'll be enough to keep them afloat and keep them on their mission.

140
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:03,960
Oh, you mean Firefox free?

141
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:04,960
That's cool.

142
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,720
You can be a Firefox premium user, Joe.

143
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:09,920
You can be a free user, a Firefox basic.

144
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:13,200
You know that's where it's going.

145
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:17,640
You know the story that got my attention, like totally like, what this week was Apple

146
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:23,040
joining the open source cloud native computing foundation, which is a Linux foundation jam.

147
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:27,120
Yeah, I was completely taken aback by this and looking into it.

148
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:29,240
It's not a huge financial contribution.

149
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:36,480
It's maybe around $50,000, but it's more about the message that it sends than the actual

150
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:37,480
contribution.

151
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:43,000
Well, and part of that membership also gets you a seat on the governing board.

152
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:50,800
So Apple's senior engineer, Tom Adorn, will join the board of the cloud native computing

153
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,400
foundation.

154
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:54,240
So that $50,000 gets you something.

155
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:58,680
It gets you something, but it makes me wonder, why would Apple be interested in this?

156
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:06,160
I know that they use AWS quite a lot for iCloud, which is just funny that your Apple stuff

157
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:10,720
is all being backed up to a Linux server somewhere, but I just don't understand the motivation

158
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:11,720
behind this.

159
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:16,820
Well, as an iPhone user, I'm perfectly happy to have my backend services powered by Linux.

160
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:24,240
Let me tell you, Apple is joining 89 existing members that make up a group of companies

161
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:29,480
that you've heard of, like Adidas is in there, Atlassian, Box, GitHub, the New York Times,

162
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:30,480
Reddit, Spotify, Walmart.

163
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:33,400
I mean, it's a big group of people.

164
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:37,680
And in typical fashion, Apple isn't commenting on the announcement at all.

165
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:44,920
They won't tell us anything, but they have released a small quote saying, we are, quote,

166
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:49,360
heavy users of open source cloud native technologies, and we are looking for a way to give back

167
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:50,360
to the community.

168
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:51,360
That's all they said.

169
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:58,080
You know, you think about it though, I'm sure not only is iCloud heavily reliant on Linux,

170
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:05,480
but OS X, or I'm sorry, Mac OS is a Darwin based operating system, which is open source.

171
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:11,540
And Apple's big new hotness is Swift, the programming language, which is open source.

172
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:16,480
And while they haven't typically participated very vibrantly in the open source community,

173
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:20,440
that kind of has changed with the launch of Swift a couple of years ago.

174
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:27,160
If you follow Swift on GitHub, you can see where they're going well before Tim Cook gets

175
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:29,600
up on stage at WWDC.

176
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:35,440
They're legitimately participating as a full fledged open source community, including committing

177
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:39,020
changes before they're even announced on stage.

178
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:42,480
And I think this is just part of the new reality.

179
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:46,880
The new reality is you got to play in this space if you want to be used by developers

180
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:50,680
that are shipping enterprise grade and production grade applications.

181
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:54,080
It feels like the whole world has just gone topsy turvy.

182
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:59,480
When you've got Microsoft loving Linux now, and even Apple doing stuff like this, I just

183
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:03,160
would have never contemplated it 10 years ago.

184
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:04,240
I know.

185
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:05,800
That is, there is something weird to it.

186
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:10,380
Like when they, do you remember when Apple acquired CUPS, the common Unix printing system?

187
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:11,640
That felt really weird.

188
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:15,040
So we've been kind of ramping up to this for years now.

189
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:18,320
But wasn't that more about stopping it going GPL?

190
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:22,920
Yeah, and keeping a good printing system for Mac OS, which is also why WebKit is their

191
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:23,920
thing.

192
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:24,920
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

193
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:25,920
There's definitely some self interest here.

194
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:27,600
Well, I just can't get my head around it.

195
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:32,840
But what I can get my head around is CERN deciding that open source is probably better

196
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:35,400
for them than relying on Microsoft services.

197
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:39,200
You know how they're serious is they've given it a name, Malt.

198
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,200
That's how you know.

199
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:44,320
It's not like, it's not like a public gambling strategy where they're trying to play chicken

200
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:45,760
with Microsoft.

201
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:46,760
They're serious.

202
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:52,320
This actually started about over a year ago, as we record this, when CERN was anticipating

203
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:56,320
that things were going to change with the Microsoft software licensing scheme.

204
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:59,200
They have known this was coming to Microsoft's credit.

205
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:02,520
They gave them a heads up, hey, you know, that sweetheart deal we've been giving you

206
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:06,720
because, you know, you're a collaborative educational institute.

207
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:09,400
We've decided we're not doing that anymore.

208
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:13,600
And so when CERN got that notification, they began the Malt project.

209
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:19,520
Now, the Malt project looks at the wide community and high number of users that participate

210
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:24,120
in different CERN projects, and looks at how they can come up with a common technology

211
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:26,760
solution that addresses all of this.

212
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:29,520
This isn't something I really appreciated, but we'll have a link in the show notes.

213
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:33,880
And they write, given the collaborative nature of CERN and its wide community, a high number

214
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:39,200
of licenses are required to deliver services to everyone.

215
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:44,720
And when traditional business models on a per user basis are applied, the cost per product

216
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:49,080
can be huge and become unaffordable in the long term.

217
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:55,220
A prime example of this is CERN has enjoyed special conditions from Microsoft for the

218
00:12:55,220 --> 00:12:57,720
last 20 years.

219
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:00,720
Yeah, like eventually that was going to run out, right?

220
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:05,000
By virtue of the status of being an academic institution, we thought we'd be okay.

221
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:10,860
However, recently, the company has decided to revoke CERN's academic status, a measure

222
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:17,240
that took effect at the end of the previous contract in March of 2019.

223
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:22,780
It was replaced by a contract based on the number of users, increasing the license cost

224
00:13:22,780 --> 00:13:25,360
by more than a factor of 10.

225
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:30,840
Oh, my God, I don't mean to laugh, but this is just stuff that users of open source never

226
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:31,840
have to deal with.

227
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:34,240
Well, that's not strictly true if you think about things like RHEL.

228
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:35,240
Well, sure.

229
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:36,240
Yeah, right.

230
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:37,240
For servers.

231
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:38,240
It's not so bad.

232
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,240
You know, if you only had to license the servers.

233
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:40,240
Forget CALS.

234
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:44,480
I mean, RHEL doesn't have CALS, client access licenses, but you know, forget that.

235
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:45,480
It's not so bad.

236
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:49,760
But CERN felt like they were getting nickel and dimed when it came down to the individual

237
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:54,960
contributor and they would have to license Excel and Microsoft Office and Windows.

238
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:59,180
And then it got really, really expensive because they want to work with the scientific community

239
00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:04,480
and they want to take in input from individuals in the scientific community, but they don't

240
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:08,280
want to have to buy them Excel and Microsoft Office and Windows 10 licenses to do it.

241
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:14,120
Well, an organization like CERN who can put together the Large Hadron Collider and somehow

242
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:20,160
take us cascading into the darkest timeline that we find ourselves in now surely must

243
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:25,080
be able to do some good stuff with open source and replace these Microsoft bits of software.

244
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:26,080
I'm with you.

245
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:27,960
I'm completely with you, Joe.

246
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:29,020
I'm very happy for them.

247
00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:32,820
The only thing I'm concerned about is like their low hanging fruit that they're going

248
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:38,280
after is like, I mean, it's not like our weakest sauce, but it's not our strong sauce.

249
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:42,320
You know, they're going for replacing Exchange and replacing Skype.

250
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:44,480
That's their first step of implementation.

251
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:46,960
And if open source can solve that, they're going to continue on.

252
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:52,560
Couldn't they have started with like replacing IIS or replacing authentication or replacing

253
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:53,560
databases?

254
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:56,660
They had to start with Exchange and Skype, really?

255
00:14:56,660 --> 00:14:58,280
That's like worst case scenario.

256
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:03,880
This is an organization that proved the existence of a hitherto unknown particle.

257
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:07,600
They can sort out a FOSS version of Exchange and Skype, surely.

258
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:08,600
Yeah, maybe.

259
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:09,600
Fair enough.

260
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:10,600
I hope.

261
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:11,600
I hope you're right.

262
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,120
I mean, they are running quite a bit of Linux.

263
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:17,460
In fact, they run the Plasma desktop for some of their analysis machines.

264
00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:19,560
So it's not like they're totally new.

265
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:23,480
So I mean, I just feel like they're not starting with the easy stuff.

266
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:24,480
That's all.

267
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:25,480
They're starting with the hardest.

268
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:30,720
But this organization understands how to invest for a long term payoff.

269
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:34,440
So we're not probably going to see these things in six months.

270
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:40,260
But they understand that there's no point throwing that money away on Microsoft licenses

271
00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:44,800
when they could just invest a lot more than that right now in open source solutions, but

272
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:47,400
then benefit from them forever.

273
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:48,460
I hope you're right.

274
00:15:48,460 --> 00:15:49,500
That's a great perspective.

275
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:54,440
Like they understand the long game because of the very nature of their work.

276
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:57,440
And considering they have some Linux experience, you could be right.

277
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:01,360
I think what it is for me is Munich wrecked me.

278
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,760
You could see in Munich like all of this potential.

279
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:08,760
They were going to convert an entire government and thereby a state to Linux.

280
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:11,640
And then they just they screwed it up.

281
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:13,800
They screwed it up in like the old school way.

282
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:15,760
Like they built their own distro.

283
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:18,120
They forked their own version of open office.

284
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:24,300
Like it was just a mess that created a technical debt that was too much to support.

285
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:28,120
And I think that taught me the most successful Linux switches and deployments are when you

286
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:33,640
go mainline, when you are close to a vendor solution that can be supported by an industry

287
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:35,400
of consultants.

288
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:40,360
What I'm reading here is like, I don't know, it's not quite that.

289
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:42,280
It's feeling like it has potential for failure.

290
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:43,280
I shouldn't.

291
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:44,280
I shouldn't even say this.

292
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:47,440
I should just sit here and be like, great, great, certain switching to Linux, what's

293
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:48,440
to worry about?

294
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:49,440
I really should just say that.

295
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:53,320
I should even consider the ramifications and the possibilities where this could go wrong.

296
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:57,040
But I feel like that's the problem with doing this for over a decade.

297
00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:01,120
I've watched some transition to Linux that have gone exceptionally well.

298
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:04,780
And I've watched some transitions that have gone bad.

299
00:17:04,780 --> 00:17:11,840
And when you start your transition with trying to replace Exchange and Skype, you're either

300
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:15,360
doing it totally right and just trying to like bite off the hardest thing possible at

301
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:17,920
the very beginning, or you're doing it totally wrong.

302
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:19,840
And we just don't know yet, in my opinion.

303
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:21,720
I think we've been doing this show too long, man.

304
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:22,720
We've switched roles here.

305
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:28,040
I was supposed to be the cynical one, but I just have a lot of faith in the people.

306
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:30,880
They're the smartest people in the world, as far as I'm concerned.

307
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:35,560
I don't have a lot of faith in scientists and the scientific method and all of that.

308
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:36,560
So I don't know.

309
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:38,560
I'm going to remain positive about this.

310
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:40,560
And I'm going to say, don't worry.

311
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:44,720
It's not going to be short term, but in the long term, this is going to work out brilliantly.

312
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:46,760
This is the best thing that could have happened to open source.

313
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:51,040
And I think in 10 years, we'll be looking back at this saying that, wow, I'm so glad

314
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:52,040
they did this.

315
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:53,040
I hope so.

316
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:54,040
I really do.

317
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:55,040
I hope you're right.

318
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:57,960
I just look back at recent history and think, these guys forked the universe, and who knows

319
00:17:57,960 --> 00:17:58,960
what they're going to do next.

320
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:01,360
You just can't trust them anymore.

321
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:05,640
If they hadn't forked the universe, Huawei would be shipping their new Matebook Pros.

322
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:09,200
But now, in the new branch that we live in, those aren't shipping.

323
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:10,440
And I'm not happy, Joe.

324
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:12,600
I'm not happy.

325
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:19,380
I had dreams of the perfect MacBook killer running Linux in the Huawei Matebook Pro.

326
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:20,720
It looked like it had the potential.

327
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:24,920
Yeah, but the reason they're not going to ship it is because of potential problems with

328
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:28,720
Microsoft and them not allowing them to ship Windows on it.

329
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:34,360
So who knows what Linux compatibility would have been like, but I guess we'll never find

330
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:35,360
out now.

331
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:40,780
Yeah, it's looking bad for Huawei when they bet on the Windows horse.

332
00:18:40,780 --> 00:18:41,840
Who knows?

333
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:45,620
Everything coming out of there right now is just all over the map.

334
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:50,040
You get one story, and then you get another story that completely just contradicts everything

335
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:51,760
that you just read.

336
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:55,420
But one thing that seems clear is that they're no longer going to be able to take advantage

337
00:18:55,420 --> 00:18:57,280
of Android.

338
00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:00,880
And they got a lot of phones they want to ship, and they need to ship an operating system

339
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:02,120
on those phones.

340
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:06,640
And that operating system may turn out to be Aurora, which is a fork of Sailfish OS.

341
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:13,000
Yeah, well, here's what's really, to me personally, fascinating about this story is we are getting

342
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:18,360
more misinformation around this story than I think anything I've tracked in the last

343
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:20,160
decade for Linux.

344
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:27,480
I mean, we've heard everything from an Android clone is just around the corner to a completely

345
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:28,600
in-house OS.

346
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:33,880
And now this new report from The Bell, which is a publication out of Russia, reports that

347
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:40,000
Huawei is exploring, what Joe just said, Aurora OS as its alternative to Android.

348
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:45,720
The publication cites two sources in Huawei who claim to be executives who discussed using

349
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:53,160
Aurora OS, and the Minister of Digital Development, Communications, and Mass Media of the Russian

350
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:56,160
Federation was also a source for this story.

351
00:19:56,160 --> 00:20:04,960
Aurora OS is a Russian-made mobile operating system which is forked from Sailfish OS.

352
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:08,960
And this is where we find ourselves.

353
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:09,960
What a story.

354
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:15,760
Sailfish OS may be alive and well on Huawei phones.

355
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:19,760
It really is hard to know exactly what's going on, because according to The Bell, they've

356
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:22,640
shipped some of these phones for testing.

357
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:28,080
But then there's a report on China Daily saying that there's been a million phones shipped

358
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:30,400
and yet another operating system.

359
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:33,200
It does just seem to be a cloud of misinformation, as you say.

360
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,760
A million phones.

361
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:41,240
Yeah, and they say that it's been shipping this custom in-house OS called Hongmeng on

362
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:43,920
a million consumer devices.

363
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:47,860
That doesn't seem possible, but who knows?

364
00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:50,760
It's hard to really say what's true or false coming out of China.

365
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:55,160
But according to reports, Huawei's in-house software is said to be compatible with all

366
00:20:55,160 --> 00:21:01,240
Android applications and yet, and this is a quote from Huawei, has an increased focus

367
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:07,320
on security functions to protect personal data, of course.

368
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:11,400
If Google's going to shut them down, the number one thing to focus in on would be, well, but

369
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:13,200
now we're more private and secure.

370
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:15,760
This is one that we're just going to have to wait and see, and I suppose we'll just

371
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:19,840
have to keep reporting on the developments as we see them.

372
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:22,840
But I think that by the end of the year, we should know what's going on with this.

373
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:28,840
We'll hopefully see a phone shipping some sort of OS, and it'll be in the hands of reviewers

374
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:30,080
at least.

375
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:35,240
Maybe we can see some YouTube videos or something and see exactly where they go or which direction.

376
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:41,000
It seems like maybe, like Google, often have a few competing departments going in different

377
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,200
directions.

378
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:45,700
Maybe it's the same for Huawei and what actually bubbles to the surface will just be the best

379
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:53,240
of them, be it an Android-based one or Sailfish or a completely from scratch operating system.

380
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:58,280
I like to think that realistically, it's probably just going to be AOSP-based with some of their

381
00:21:58,280 --> 00:21:59,280
own services.

382
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:00,600
But we'll have to see.

383
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:02,320
They could take the lead in their market.

384
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:07,560
They could build an operating system that isn't just for phones but also works on tablets

385
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:11,480
and televisions and cars and smart wearables.

386
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:12,480
We'll see.

387
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:18,200
I think one thing that is true, at least in the West, is that the throw it at the wall

388
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:20,480
and see what sticks approach never works.

389
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:27,920
So they better get a cohesive, comprehensive, complete product ready if they want to compete

390
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:31,200
and they want to sell another million devices in the West like they have recently.

391
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:35,240
Well, what better way to throw off your competition than pumping out a load of misinformation?

392
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:39,160
So it wouldn't surprise me if suddenly just bang, they're ready with something that's

393
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:42,160
completely cohesive and thought through and developed.

394
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:43,160
You know what?

395
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:44,480
I like to think that's what they're doing right now.

396
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:46,740
A lot of the Matebooks are canceled.

397
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:48,100
The Matebooks aren't canceled.

398
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:49,840
We're going to ship our own operating system.

399
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:50,840
We're going to ship Sailfish.

400
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:51,840
We're going to ship our own OS.

401
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:53,880
No, it's going to be a remix of Android.

402
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:58,560
Keep everybody guessing until you figure out what the best strategy is.

403
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:01,800
Man, if that's what they're doing right now, I'm impressed.

404
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:03,120
I am really impressed.

405
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:04,120
And it should be.

406
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:05,120
I hope it is what they're doing.

407
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:09,600
Well, maybe Facebook could take a leaf out of Huawei's book because their cryptocurrency

408
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:14,080
is the biggest open secret in the tech market.

409
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:18,640
We've been hearing about this for months and months and months, and apparently it's going

410
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:20,560
to be announced this week.

411
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:22,800
And this isn't just some Mickey Mouse operation.

412
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:27,400
It's going to be backed by some huge names like Visa and MasterCard.

413
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:28,400
I know.

414
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:31,760
It doesn't matter how much rocking back and forth in the fetal position.

415
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:36,440
I do say, no, Mark, no, it's still going to happen.

416
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:40,000
It turns out all that fetal position rocking did nothing.

417
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:46,420
Not only is Visa and MasterCard on board, but the great and fine discerning individuals

418
00:23:46,420 --> 00:23:53,320
at Uber, PayPal, Stripe and Booking.com are also on board with this new cryptocurrency,

419
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:59,600
which will reportedly be called Libra, which triggers me so deep down I can't even get

420
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:01,380
into right now.

421
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:08,260
And it will be unveiled supposedly June 18th, 2019, according to TechCrunch, with a full

422
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:11,120
rollout planned for 2020.

423
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:17,080
It's expected to function as what is called in the community a stablecoin, which means

424
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:22,320
it will be pegged to a basket of government issued currencies in order to limit the volatility

425
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:29,720
of cryptocurrencies that are usually associated with things like Doge or Bitcoin.

426
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:36,260
Stability is a pretty big concern, especially if Facebook is hoping to attract users in

427
00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:38,820
developing countries, Joe.

428
00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:40,380
Imagine this.

429
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:45,680
Imagine a future where Facebook's currency, Libra, which I can't even say out loud without

430
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:51,580
laughing, becomes the default currency for nations.

431
00:24:51,580 --> 00:24:55,000
If that happens, I'm just going to turn in my internet card and go live in the mountains.

432
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,000
I'm done, Joe.

433
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,000
I'm done.

434
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:03,160
It's going to be called Libra because it's going to liberate everyone from the shackles

435
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:05,200
of the fiat currencies.

436
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:09,440
Oh, I don't mean to be a snowflake, Joe, but I'm getting triggered.

437
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:14,800
Look, Facebook have got the user base already.

438
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:19,120
If they wanted to, and this is speculation at this stage, but if they want to push it

439
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:25,600
in front of every single active user in prime advertising spots, potentially on mobile where

440
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:31,120
advertising is pretty minimal, like Google do, they put stuff on their homepage and it

441
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:35,280
just like Chrome, for example, they put it on there and then completely dominated the

442
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:36,520
browser market.

443
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:42,040
If anyone can push cryptocurrencies into the mainstream, it feels like it has to be one

444
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:48,280
of the huge companies, the huge tech companies, and Facebook seems as well placed as any to

445
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:49,280
do that.

446
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:53,160
Well, they can make the deals with Uber, so you could get Uber eyes with the Facebook

447
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:54,160
coin.

448
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:55,600
They could integrate it into Instagram.

449
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:59,940
Obviously, they can integrate it into their advertising platform for Facebook, which is

450
00:25:59,940 --> 00:26:04,780
user generated, and they can integrate it into the Facebook messenger.

451
00:26:04,780 --> 00:26:10,840
They are in a very, very, very good position with about, what is it, two billion users

452
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:11,840
a month?

453
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:15,960
They're in a pretty good position to pull something off like this.

454
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:19,840
It just makes me want to go live in a van down by the river.

455
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:27,360
Well, yeah, and the question is, is this just this sort of death rattle of a company that

456
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:34,760
is on its way down that's been just rocked by privacy scandals and is just becoming irrelevant

457
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:35,760
and irrelevant?

458
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:40,560
Instagram is still very much relevant, but Facebook itself, their main platform, seems

459
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:44,400
to be becoming less and less relevant, and I wouldn't imagine your kids would have anything

460
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:48,280
to do with it, for example, and all the older people who are on it are eventually going

461
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:54,280
to die, so eventually, Facebook will just go the way of MySpace, probably.

462
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:59,480
It's either just a desperate attempt by them to stay relevant, and this kind of thing,

463
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:04,320
you would imagine, has been worked on for months and years, probably, and so it was

464
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:13,840
probably started during the heady $20,000-ish days of Bitcoin, and it's probably taken this

465
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:18,200
long to actually work through all the bureaucracy and everything to get it to be announced,

466
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:23,600
and then even so, it's going to be at least another six months before you can use it.

467
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:28,440
So it's either just them desperately trying to stay relevant, or it is actually going

468
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:32,280
to work and it is going to bring cryptocurrencies to the masses.

469
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:36,260
I don't know, I think probably the former rather than the latter, if I'm being honest.

470
00:27:36,260 --> 00:27:37,260
It is the former.

471
00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:38,260
It is the former.

472
00:27:38,260 --> 00:27:41,800
We are just at the very, very beginning, and so many of the issues that you just cited

473
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:44,560
don't even matter to so many people around the world.

474
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:46,280
They're not even aware of them.

475
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:51,300
People that don't listen to this show, for example, they're not even aware of the issues,

476
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:57,820
and when you look at the involvement of major financial firms like Visa or MasterCard, it

477
00:27:57,820 --> 00:28:05,140
shows that they're jumping on board not because they want to, but because they have to.

478
00:28:05,140 --> 00:28:07,680
They have to, because of Facebook's size.

479
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:11,000
They have 2.4 billion monthly active users.

480
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:15,340
MasterCard and Visa have to respond to that, and there's another element to the story we

481
00:28:15,340 --> 00:28:19,480
haven't mentioned yet, which I think Facebook will push a lot in the announcement next week.

482
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:25,720
They're going to establish an independent body to manage all of this that keeps users'

483
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:31,720
privacy in mind and integrates with regulators and really kind of is the face of this cryptocurrency.

484
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:38,640
They're going to push that a lot next week, and I think that will shield them from a lot

485
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:43,120
of the skepticism and a lot of the critical analysis is this independent body that's made

486
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:53,080
up of these members like Uber, PayPal, Stripe, MasterCard, and Visa, and they'll bring legitimacy

487
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:55,920
to what should be just a ridiculous idea.

488
00:28:55,920 --> 00:29:03,200
Well, all I can say to you and our listeners is be prepared for your non-Linux friends

489
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:05,080
to start asking you about this stuff.

490
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:10,200
The kind of normals who are on Facebook will suddenly become aware of this, whether it's

491
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:15,200
this week when the announcement happens or whether it's early next year, presumably when

492
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:16,600
it actually comes out.

493
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:21,400
We will have to field questions about this, and so you'd better come up with a way to

494
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:24,000
explain to them why it's good or bad.

495
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:27,520
Yeah, and something else is like, go look at it.

496
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:33,720
Don't just parrot anti-Facebook FUD, which I would be one of the first to do, but actually

497
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:35,400
go look into it.

498
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:36,400
Go see what it is.

499
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:42,140
But Joe, I feel like the one thing as an old-time Bitcoin fan is you've got to think about this

500
00:29:42,140 --> 00:29:45,280
in one context and one context only.

501
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:47,640
How is this going to affect the price of Bitcoin?

502
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:49,720
A cryptocurrency goes legitimate, right?

503
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:50,720
Yeah.

504
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:52,440
I'm thinking it's going to massively boost it.

505
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:53,440
I do, too.

506
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:54,960
In fact, I think it's already priced in.

507
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:58,160
I think the Bitcoin community has already seen this coming, and that's why Bitcoin's

508
00:29:58,160 --> 00:30:03,560
getting near $9,000 right now, which, at the beginning of the year, what was it around

509
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:06,000
$6,000, maybe?

510
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:09,560
Maybe $6,000 when we started recording?

511
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:14,300
And now it's at $9,000 halfway through the year, and I think in part it's because of

512
00:30:14,300 --> 00:30:16,400
things like Facebook's Librecoin.

513
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:20,840
I think we're in serious danger of getting into Bitcoin prediction territory here, so

514
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:23,320
we should probably get out of here.

515
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:24,320
Right.

516
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:26,920
We should avoid that at all costs.

517
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:28,920
And we've learned our lesson on this show, Joe.

518
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:33,280
Anyways, we'll have links to all of this stuff if you guys want to read more.

519
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:38,800
And I'd also kind of like to know what you think about Facebook backing a cryptocurrency.

520
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:41,960
What do you think about that, especially if it's part of a larger group?

521
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:44,520
Let us know, linuxactionnews.com slash contact.

522
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:49,200
And while you're over there, go to linuxactionnews.com slash subscribe for all the ways to get new

523
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:50,200
episodes.

524
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:55,440
And coming up on June 25th, that's a Tuesday, at 12.30 Pacific, just before LUP, is another

525
00:30:55,440 --> 00:31:00,200
one of our study groups, and this one is Understanding Burnout, which is something I feel I should

526
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:03,040
learn a lot more about, and probably all of us should.

527
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:04,040
So yeah, come along to that.

528
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:05,040
Yeah.

529
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:06,040
Who knew IT was hard?

530
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:07,040
Who knew?

531
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:10,880
They don't tell you that when you sign up, meetup.com slash Jupiter Broadcasting for

532
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:11,880
the details.

533
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:16,560
We'll be back next Monday with our weekly take on the latest Linux and open source news.

534
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:18,680
I am at Chris LAS.

535
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:20,360
And I'm at Jarl Ressington.

536
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:23,400
Thank you for joining us, and we will see you next week.

537
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:41,960
Have a great night, y'all.
