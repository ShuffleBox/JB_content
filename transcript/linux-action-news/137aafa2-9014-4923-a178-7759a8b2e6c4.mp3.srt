00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,320
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News.

2
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:09,520
Episode 115, recorded on July 21st, 2019.

3
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:10,520
I'm Chris.

4
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:11,520
And I'm Joe.

5
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:12,520
Hello, Joe.

6
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:13,880
Good to be connected with you.

7
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:18,320
And I always like starting the show out with a new Linux release.

8
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:24,760
And this week, we're taking a look at EndeavorOS, their first stable release, which Joe, I'm

9
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:27,020
sure it might just where EndeavorOS comes from.

10
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:28,920
It's been a couple of days.

11
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:32,720
Well, how long ago was it that Antigos decided that they were packing it in?

12
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:34,160
That must be about a month ago, right?

13
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:36,460
I want to almost say two months as we record now.

14
00:00:36,460 --> 00:00:37,760
It's just right around there.

15
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:38,760
Yeah.

16
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:43,680
Well, around the time of the announcement that they were going to stop doing Antigos,

17
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:47,280
a few people from the community decided that they wanted to continue it.

18
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:51,640
It was decided that they wouldn't call it Antigos anymore, that they'd give it a new

19
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:52,640
name.

20
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:53,640
And so EndeavorOS was born.

21
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:59,120
Now, I was very skeptical, very skeptical that it was actually going to happen.

22
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:01,160
But it has happened.

23
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:04,280
And now we've got the first stable release of it.

24
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:06,480
And having checked it out, I'm quite impressed.

25
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:08,080
Yeah, me too.

26
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:11,000
I'm delighted to say I'm very impressed.

27
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,520
And I think you'll recall I was a little worried that it may have been derivative, that maybe

28
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:19,440
it was time to just let Antigos go.

29
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:22,080
And they had made a thing and let it pass.

30
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:25,720
But EndeavorOS is truly its own thing.

31
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:31,560
It really was not what I expected, starting from the installer being a little bit different

32
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:36,960
and the desktop environment that is chosen by default being completely different.

33
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:41,880
And one of the more interesting implementations of Joe's favorite XFCE.

34
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:46,120
Yeah, I was very pleasantly surprised because it used GNOME before, didn't it?

35
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:48,920
Whereas now they've switched to XFCE by default.

36
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:51,000
And they've only got an offline installer at the moment.

37
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,120
So it's XFCE or nothing.

38
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:57,160
But then obviously you can install anything you want on top of that.

39
00:01:57,160 --> 00:02:01,280
But supposedly in the works is an online installer which will allow you to pick from a bunch

40
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,520
of other desktop environments.

41
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:07,200
So if you want your GNOME or Plasma or whatever, then that will be coming.

42
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:12,440
Yeah, but I would still encourage folks out there, even if they're not big XFCE users,

43
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:15,520
check it out because it may surprise you.

44
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:20,400
At first pass, you might even question if it is indeed XFCE because they're using modern

45
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:25,920
GTK themes and some modern design ideas that just make it look really sharp.

46
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:28,040
It's a great implementation.

47
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:35,600
And it's nice to see another great option for easy to use, simple to set up, Arch.

48
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:40,480
And just like an Arch box, when you boot this thing up for the first time, they've installed

49
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:43,440
one of the graphical Arch news projects.

50
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:48,180
So right up on my screen was a whole bunch of news about different package changes and

51
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:49,180
all of that.

52
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:54,440
I must have had nearly 80 packages to update after my install, maybe even more.

53
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:58,740
But it felt good to use Pacman again.

54
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:01,680
And that was a nice implementation of XFCE.

55
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:07,400
And I am so happy to say that this really does appear to be its own thing.

56
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:09,400
I'm glad Endeavor OS is here.

57
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:13,800
And I really can't wait to hear more when you guys dive in on Choose Linux coming out

58
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:14,800
later this week.

59
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:18,120
Yeah, we're going to give it a go and spoiler, it's going to be pretty positive.

60
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:21,040
That'll be at chooselinux.show.

61
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:24,880
And you can go to chooselinux.show slash subscribe if you're not already to get that episode

62
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:25,960
this week.

63
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:30,580
There's also, well, I won't spoil it, but there's a really great handy app pick in that

64
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:36,640
that I've already installed because I got the exclusive sneak peek at it.

65
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:41,680
Something else I've used for a little while now and it's coming in a different form is

66
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:48,600
Retroarch and this may be Steam's biggest emulation launch yet.

67
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:55,280
But I'm putting that in quotes because there could be a big maybe in this story.

68
00:03:55,280 --> 00:04:00,200
Yeah, I was very surprised to hear that Retroarch was coming to Steam.

69
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:03,560
Of course, this is the open source emulation platform.

70
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:08,160
But what comes with an emulation platform are the actual emulators.

71
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:13,080
And that is often a legal gray area, not to mention the actual ROMs that you run on it,

72
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:16,520
which is also a bit of a legal gray area.

73
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:18,160
Retroarch is so great.

74
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:24,120
It has a UI that hearkens back to the very first iterations of the PlayStation 3 UI.

75
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:25,680
It's really nice and clean.

76
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:29,760
It fits well on a widescreen television.

77
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:37,960
Now if everything goes as planned, Retroarch will land in the Steam store on July 30th.

78
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:42,920
Now just a disclaimer, at first it will be the Windows only version.

79
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:47,240
The team does plan to launch the Linux and Mac OS versions, but they just want to absorb

80
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:49,760
the support of the Windows version first.

81
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:53,880
They're concerned about essentially getting tons of more users and I think rightfully

82
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:54,880
so.

83
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,680
But you can go get it for your Linux box today.

84
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:57,680
I've used it before.

85
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:58,680
It's great.

86
00:04:58,680 --> 00:04:59,760
And Joe's right.

87
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:06,260
It makes it really simple to get, say, the Dolphin emulator or any emulator for basically

88
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:09,320
any platform, including legal ones like DOSBox.

89
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:14,880
And it also makes it pretty easy to get the ROMs or cores as they call them.

90
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:15,960
It's a great platform.

91
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:16,960
I love it.

92
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:19,120
I am surprised to see it coming to Steam.

93
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:22,680
And I'm sure by default it won't ship with anything that's not legal.

94
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:29,200
But much like the Kodi argument often goes, it's only a few menu entries and maybe a community

95
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:31,840
repo away and you can install anything you want.

96
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:34,560
It's not Kodi's fault, but the software does enable it.

97
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:38,760
And we've seen that get things like Kodi boxes in trouble before.

98
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:41,140
So Valve may be watching this very carefully.

99
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:42,720
The project is trying to couch it.

100
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:46,120
In fact, they say there really is nothing to do with emulators.

101
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:50,280
I mean, sure you can use it for that, but there's other things you could use RetroArch

102
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:51,280
for.

103
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:54,040
I'm not sure what those use cases are.

104
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:59,400
So although Valve doesn't really appear to have any specific rules about whether emulators

105
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:06,280
are allowed or not, piracy obviously isn't, but emulators themselves aren't I think implicitly

106
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:07,280
disallowed.

107
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:10,840
Moral of the story is just go get RetroArch on your Linux box now.

108
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:14,500
Well, yeah, it's a great piece of open source software and great that it's getting the exposure,

109
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:16,640
the mainstream exposure of being in Steam.

110
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:21,040
Yeah, for those Windows users out there, maybe you're playing around with the Windows subsystem

111
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:22,040
for Linux.

112
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:23,040
I know I would be.

113
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:24,040
I've given it a crack.

114
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:29,840
Recently, I did install the insider builds of Windows and then had to do a whole bunch

115
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:31,360
of more patches.

116
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:37,120
And then I did get WSL2 installed, yay me, for a couple of days and then I stopped using

117
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,120
Windows.

118
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:42,560
But for those of you who prefer to use Windows, there's something that might help you run

119
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:43,560
Ubuntu now.

120
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:51,360
Yeah, there's a new meta package called Ubuntu-WSL, which is fairly limited at the moment, but

121
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:57,080
I think the plan is to expand it to give you a bunch of tools to just make Ubuntu work

122
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:58,880
better on the subsystem.

123
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:04,400
Yeah, and it seems like the message here is more will be added to this meta package.

124
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:09,960
Today it's really a collection of utilities, for example, some that let you create shortcuts

125
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:14,540
on the Windows desktop to launch right into that particular instance and shell, start

126
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:20,560
the Windows browser with WSL view, which can be very handy if you want to pass URLs around.

127
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:24,800
And the plan is to add updates to the meta package as they add these features to make

128
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:28,560
it integrate in with Ubuntu and WSL better.

129
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:33,720
I get the sense here, Joe, is that Canonical is going to look at the Windows subsystem

130
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:37,720
for Linux as just another platform that they target.

131
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:45,020
They spin up images for a lot of cloud providers and other particular hardware use cases.

132
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:47,520
This is just yet another target platform now.

133
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:51,080
Well, yeah, and it shows that they are very serious about this platform.

134
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:54,000
It's not something that they're just leaving to rot.

135
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:59,400
They're actively developing for it and treating it as an equal citizen with all those other

136
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:02,400
use cases like the cloud providers.

137
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:09,080
If I was using Windows, Joe, if I was doing system administration or development and my

138
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:14,860
boxes that I was developing for or managing were Ubuntu, I would be pretty thankful that

139
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:20,280
Canonical is actually taking this seriously because this would be a real tool for me.

140
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:25,400
I have lived in environments where Windows was the OS I had to use for work, and I was

141
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:33,200
a Linux user, and something like this would sort of be like at least a lifeline.

142
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:38,000
So I just channeling former Chris would really appreciate them actually putting the effort

143
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
into this.

144
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,500
And there's other distributions in there too, but it's nice to see this going to a whole

145
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:46,160
other level now with the Meta package, and then of course there's other distros out there

146
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:52,780
like Penguin, which is a sort of a Meta Linux designed specifically for the subsystem.

147
00:08:52,780 --> 00:08:54,080
That's fascinating as well.

148
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:58,720
There's some interesting things happening in Linux land on Windows.

149
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,520
It's weird, Joe, it's weird.

150
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:07,840
It is weird, but it's not as weird as Evil Gnome, which is quite rare spyware or malware

151
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:09,800
for the Linux desktop.

152
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:10,800
Feels good.

153
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:11,800
Feels real good.

154
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:13,080
Like somebody noticed this, Joe.

155
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:14,080
We got noticed.

156
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,080
It's great.

157
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:20,320
And what's even better is it's done as a gnome extension, at least it disguises itself as

158
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:23,000
a gnome extension.

159
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:27,240
And it does all kinds of things like screen cap, listen to your audio, and it's got a

160
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:28,240
great name.

161
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:32,480
I think if you find it, you get to name it Intezer, I believe is the company's name.

162
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,240
They're the ones that came across this.

163
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:37,480
And it looks like it hides itself fairly well.

164
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:41,560
I think you could potentially be infected with this and not necessarily notice it.

165
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:45,720
It's not like a crypto miner where suddenly you'd notice that, hang on, why is everything

166
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:47,200
so sluggish?

167
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:51,600
And then you'd have a look in top or whatever, and see something blatantly pegging your CPU.

168
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:55,520
Whereas this is going to just kind of sit there and do its thing and potentially not

169
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:57,000
be noticed by people.

170
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Yeah.

171
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,280
And it may be what we're seeing.

172
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:04,280
This is some samples that VirusTotal have analyzed in other companies.

173
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:08,560
It may be kind of an early stage version of this that is sort of going to be offered up

174
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:12,200
as a package that people could buy if they want to target Linux users.

175
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:16,680
And it's modular too, and it uses cron for some of its nefarious scheduling.

176
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:19,400
So it's a pretty clever little thing.

177
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:23,040
In fact, those modules, it's broken into five different modules, and this gives you an idea

178
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,360
of what it does.

179
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:29,240
Shooter sound captures the audio from a user's microphone and then uploads it to the command

180
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:30,880
and control server.

181
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:33,200
Shooter image captures the screenshots.

182
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,960
Shooter file scans the file system.

183
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:39,680
Also watches for newly created files and then uploads them.

184
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:40,680
Really handy.

185
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:44,120
A shooter ping, it's what receives new commands.

186
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:47,040
And then shooter key, which isn't quite completed yet.

187
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:49,200
Like I said, this is kind of early.

188
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:56,040
This is like a test version, but shooter key is most likely an unfinished keylogger module

189
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:57,960
that you turn on.

190
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:58,960
And it's great.

191
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:01,160
It's multi-process architected.

192
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:05,040
It looks like it's part of your gnome desktop experience.

193
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:10,720
It installs itself to.cache, gnome software, gnome shell extensions, and attempt to look

194
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,880
like a gnome extension.

195
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:19,400
And it runs gnome-shell-extension.sh, which would look like a valid extension process

196
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:21,920
to fire off those different modules.

197
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:27,040
So is this a one-off then, or is this the start of a new era, do you think?

198
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:31,440
I mean, it is a platform to build from, for sure.

199
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:37,520
Evil gnome is kind of rare too, because it is so specifically targeting desktop Linux

200
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:39,120
users.

201
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:41,040
The economics of it, I'm not so sure of.

202
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:42,440
Where it's going to go, I'm not so sure of.

203
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:47,120
It seems to be backed by a group that is known for making Windows malware that is of similar

204
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:50,920
functionality, and now this is just their Linux version.

205
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:53,960
So I don't suspect it's going to be widespread.

206
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:57,880
I think it's going to be a tool people can purchase for targeted attacks.

207
00:11:57,880 --> 00:12:02,320
But of course, the technical breakdown that we have linked in the show notes speculates

208
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:07,940
that this might actually become more widespread as it matures and people grab different versions

209
00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:08,940
of it.

210
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:09,940
So we'll see.

211
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:11,520
Their speculation is a little more worst-case scenario.

212
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:13,520
Mine is more like targeted attacks.

213
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:15,320
But the full breakdown is linked in the show notes.

214
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:21,400
It feels like everything's coming to Linux, eh, Skype, Spotify, Steam, malware.

215
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:28,000
And even MacBook Pro keyboards, at least starting with Linux 5.3, although don't get too excited

216
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
yet.

217
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
There's a caveat.

218
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:35,120
We may get initial support for MacBook keyboards and the trackpads.

219
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:38,440
Yeah, we talked about this a couple of weeks ago and it didn't look good at all.

220
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:44,440
That was when the SSDs were finally supported with the kernel module.

221
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:48,960
And we didn't think it was going to be possible to support the keyboard and trackpad, at least

222
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:49,960
not for a while.

223
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:53,840
But in typical Linux hacker fashion, they've made it happen.

224
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:59,560
This is great news for people who want to use the Apple hardware with Linux.

225
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:04,040
It's not going to be right away, but at least those machines are not going to be completely

226
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:06,240
useless when Apple abandons them software-wise.

227
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:07,240
Yeah.

228
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:12,000
Well, it's also really good for people that want to do software support or data rescue

229
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,200
or forensics.

230
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:17,960
So really, if you want all of the goodies to land, like Joe said, you kind of have to

231
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:18,960
wait a little bit.

232
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:26,600
The kernel 5.4 will have, in theory, the MVNE patch and the keyboard and trackpad patch.

233
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:31,560
The keyboard and trackpad stuff is in kernel 5.3, but the drive stuff doesn't land until

234
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:35,160
5.4, at least as things are planned now.

235
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:40,200
Keep in mind that this has been an issue since the end of 2015, so it's kind of been a while

236
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,200
now.

237
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:45,640
What really happened is on the newer generation of MacBooks, they took those devices off the

238
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:51,560
USB bus and made them SPI devices, which is really kind of, nobody does that.

239
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:57,120
And they also never documented the SPI protocol that their controller uses to communicate

240
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:59,200
with the devices.

241
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:06,720
So thankfully, a developer had time to reverse engineer large portions of the protocol, not

242
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:11,640
all of it yet, but has been able to write a basic Linux driver.

243
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:15,480
There's still some things that need to be worked out, but what's known today as good

244
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:22,200
enough for basic usage, and when you combine that with the MVNE patches that will land

245
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:27,720
in 5.4, after four years, we're finally able to get control of the mouse and keyboard and

246
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:28,880
write and read to the disk.

247
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:34,200
It's all very early, so I mean, it could be another four years before it's really production

248
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:35,200
grade.

249
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:36,200
Who knows?

250
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:37,200
Maybe it'll go much quicker now that the basics are in.

251
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:38,200
Maybe it's a couple of years.

252
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:43,080
Maybe it's a year, but it's not quite there yet, but it's so great to see, at least after

253
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:45,600
four years of having nothing, this level of breakthrough.

254
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:50,360
But it doesn't really matter if it does take another couple of years to become solid.

255
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:54,720
What matters is that it happens eventually, because you would imagine that these MacBooks

256
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:59,520
are going to get supported with macOS for at least another few years.

257
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:02,560
But then Apple just abandons stuff, don't they?

258
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:08,080
Like my old MacBook Pro that I've got with the amazing speakers, that's just been completely

259
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:10,880
abandoned but works perfectly with Linux now.

260
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:13,200
I think it's about, what, five years, is that what you said?

261
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:14,200
Five years?

262
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:15,200
Is that what macOS is?

263
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:16,200
That's my rough recollection.

264
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:18,880
It's something like that, I think, yeah.

265
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:26,120
I think what's less of a risk with this SPI protocol and reverse engineering how the T2

266
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:33,720
RAID chip works, them not supporting the macOS on that model of machine is, I think, going

267
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:34,720
to happen.

268
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:35,720
It's a known risk.

269
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:40,600
And, you know, five years is a good amount of time for us to try to work this out, apparently.

270
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:44,080
However, I think the larger risk, that is a risk, but I think the larger risk is that

271
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:49,120
Apple moves on to something else completely different, like a T3 chip or a T10 chip.

272
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:54,000
And it's, once again, a totally new device or a totally new protocol.

273
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,440
And then yet another generation of machines are unsupported.

274
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:03,680
All of the rumors in the Mac Pro area right now suggest that there are new keyboards in

275
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:04,680
the works.

276
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:07,340
And that could be a moment where they change it all over again.

277
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:08,340
Or maybe not.

278
00:16:08,340 --> 00:16:09,340
Yeah, who knows?

279
00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:13,880
Maybe eventually they'll probably switch over to ARM, at least for the Airs and whatever,

280
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:16,320
you know, the lower end stuff.

281
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:21,520
But the hardware that's out there already that would otherwise just sit in a drawer

282
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:25,440
or on a shelf somewhere could actually be actively used.

283
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:27,400
And that's one of the great things about Linux.

284
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:28,400
Exactly.

285
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:32,000
And I'll just point out that while I think, you know, there's definitely a work scenario

286
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:39,880
and a use case for Apple hardware, one of the things that I prefer about Linux and the

287
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:44,640
ecosystem around it is a much higher level of predictability.

288
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:48,000
You know, we can sit here and tell you this is going to land in kernel 5.3 and this is

289
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:53,400
going to land in kernel 5.4, and then you know from that moment forward it's supported.

290
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:56,560
With this kind of stuff, you're guessing when it comes to Apple.

291
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:58,240
It's that they like to be a black box.

292
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:00,400
That's part of the allure, part of their magic.

293
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:05,080
I get it, but when it comes to my work and my job, I just don't prefer it.

294
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:06,760
I prefer predictability.

295
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:11,780
I prefer the open, transparent nature of free software development.

296
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:17,080
And that's why for me, and I think maybe for a lot of people out there, Linux makes a better

297
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:18,080
engineering workstation.

298
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:21,320
At the end of the day, it's just a more predictable platform.

299
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:27,240
I know that sounds crazy, but at this level it is just simply a more predictable platform

300
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:28,240
for me.

301
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:32,840
One of the great things about the Linux and open source community is that often when someone

302
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:38,120
has had enough of a project, they'll step down responsibly, like we saw with Antigos,

303
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:41,960
and then something great will be born out of it, like Endeavor OS.

304
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:48,040
And this week, the maintainer for gpodder.net has said that he's had enough of that, but

305
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:49,440
he's not just dropping it.

306
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:52,440
He's actively looking for someone to replace him.

307
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:56,560
Yeah, gpodder is one of those great applications that I've used forever.

308
00:17:56,560 --> 00:18:01,440
It's a GTK Linux desktop podcast client, in a nutshell.

309
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:06,080
And you just give it an RSS feed and it just dutifully downloads it from henceforth.

310
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:10,960
And there is a website web service component to it as well that needs to be kept up to

311
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,240
date and secure, obviously.

312
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:16,340
And there's some basic maintainership of the application to keep it current.

313
00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:21,480
The requirements appear to be some Python knowledge, basic understanding of web technologies,

314
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:23,880
and an understanding of relational databases.

315
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:27,600
However, that said, I think there is a lot of opportunity with gpodder.

316
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:33,240
In fact, I think it could be one of the larger, more successful desktop Linux applications

317
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:37,340
that could be monetized, just my opinion.

318
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:41,080
So I really hope this finds a new home and somebody who's really fired up and enthusiastic

319
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:43,380
about keeping it going.

320
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:47,920
And I have so much gratitude and respect to Stefan for keeping it alive as long as he

321
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:48,920
has.

322
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:55,760
He has been one of those tried and true desktop applications that has just continued to tick

323
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:58,600
away and work for me year after year.

324
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:00,760
And I hope somebody takes it on and it keeps going.

325
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:05,520
Because he says, if somebody doesn't, it's likely he'd have to shut the project down

326
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:06,520
by the end of 2019.

327
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:09,440
Yeah, I really hope someone does step up for this.

328
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:13,640
But I think you're playing down the web service aspect of this.

329
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:19,640
It's a podcast directory, much like iTunes or Apple Podcasts, as they call it now.

330
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:23,320
It's a place that you can search for new podcasts.

331
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:29,480
And at the moment, if your podcast isn't on iTunes, then it's pretty much not in any applications.

332
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:32,720
Whereas if you go for something that's a bit more freedom respecting, like AntennaPod,

333
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:35,440
you can specifically search gpodder.net.

334
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:38,360
And I think we're in there, but then some of our other shows aren't.

335
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:40,840
So we need to get on that, I think.

336
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:43,280
Yeah, it just needs some love.

337
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:49,840
Just like Jono's show Shot of Jack, which I don't think has had an episode since 2010,

338
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:54,760
maybe, is in the trending or popular section.

339
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:57,720
The Linux action show AugFeed is also in there.

340
00:19:57,720 --> 00:20:01,680
It's like number 20 in there or something like that, which I don't think that's a very

341
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:02,680
active feed anymore.

342
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:06,120
So I think the web service needs some love, too.

343
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:10,220
And it's such a great idea, and we have so few open alternatives.

344
00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:13,520
And it is a nice, clean, simple UI.

345
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:15,520
It just needs some data love.

346
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:16,520
And it could be there.

347
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:19,640
Yeah, this is why I wanted to bring this up on the show, to shine a light on it and spread

348
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:22,480
the word and hope that other people spread the word.

349
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:26,320
And fingers crossed, we'll get someone who steps up and takes over.

350
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:30,640

354
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:49,600
And I have to give a personal, strong recommendation that you go over to error.show slash 70 and

355
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:53,960
listen to old and insecure episode 70 of the User Error Program.

356
00:20:53,960 --> 00:21:00,760
It is such a good show, and I absolutely loved every single minute of episode 70.

357
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:05,200
Yeah, the best thing I ever did was asking Dan and Poppy to come and join me on that

358
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:06,200
show.

359
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:10,360
And we'll see you next Monday with our weekly take on the latest Linux and open source news.

360
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:11,960
I'm at Chris LAS.

361
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:13,640
I'm at Joel Wessington.

362
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:16,240
Thank you for joining us, and we will see you next week.

363
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:36,680
Take care, I'll talk to you later.
