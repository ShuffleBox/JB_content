00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,340
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, our weekly take on Linux and the open-source world.

2
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:20,360
This is episode 52, recorded on May 6th, 2018.

3
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:21,360
I'm Chris.

4
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:22,360
And I'm Joe.

5
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:25,680
Hello, Joe, and congratulations on the one-year mark.

6
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:29,240
And we kick it off this week with a goodbye to 32-bit.

7
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:32,720
Yes, the march of progress continues.

8
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:38,480
And this week, we've learned that Ubuntu Mate and Ubuntu Budgie are both dropping 32-bit

9
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:41,640
ISOs going forwards with the 1810 cycle.

10
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:46,840
So 1804 is going to be the last 32-bit ISOs that you're going to have for those two flavors

11
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:47,840
of Ubuntu.

12
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:53,360
I would imagine that other flavors will follow suit this week, but right now, I think they're

13
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:56,400
the only ones that are confirmed.

14
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:59,120
So do we really care about this?

15
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:03,680
Do we have any 32-bit-only machines at this point that are even worth using?

16
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:06,120
I don't think I could say that I personally care.

17
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:10,920
But I was surprised to see that Ubuntu Mate was one of the first leading the charge here.

18
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:16,480
Because when I think of Mate, I think of it as a distribution for systems that maybe are

19
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:20,560
a little older that you want to get some new life into.

20
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:25,080
But when you look at the project's rationale, it's pretty hard to argue with this.

21
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:29,100
One thing to remember, starting with 1804, it's still early days, but they are getting

22
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:31,340
hardware telemetry back now.

23
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:35,800
And that's starting to give the project some early indications, including the fact that

24
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:42,240
a lot of people that are installing the 32-bit version of Ubuntu are doing so on 64-bit hardware.

25
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:45,920
So they look at that, and they also look at the fact that really nothing 32-bit has shipped

26
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:50,840
for 10 years, and that those resources could be spent maybe supporting the ARM version

27
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:52,240
even better.

28
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:56,520
And when you consider that only 10% of Ubuntu Mate users are even using the 32-bit version,

29
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:59,680
I really can't argue with their logic or their rationale.

30
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:02,240
But I imagine it will definitely impact some folks in our audience.

31
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:07,040
Because really, 32-bit hardware is still perfectly good as long as it boots and powers on, and

32
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:08,440
you just want to browse the web.

33
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:10,560
But the world is moving on.

34
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,560
What about you, Joe?

35
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:13,560
Don't you have a 32-bit machine kicking around?

36
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:14,800
I do.

37
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,600
It's not something that I use regularly.

38
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:21,580
I only really test lightweight distros on it occasionally, and older distros.

39
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:22,580
It's a very old machine.

40
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:28,520
I think it was one of the last laptops made that wasn't a netbook that was 32-bit only.

41
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:32,080
And I just can't really do much with it.

42
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:37,240
Even if you get, say, even Lubuntu running on it, yes, you can get that running.

43
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,480
You can get a browser up.

44
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:43,320
But most websites are so heavy these days that it's just painful to use anything, especially

45
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:45,160
anything multimedia or anything like that.

46
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:50,640
I mean, maybe if you're just reading PDFs or just reading RSS feeds or something, it

47
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:51,640
makes sense.

48
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:57,080
But if you really, really want to set something like that up, you can do it with an Ubuntu

49
00:02:57,080 --> 00:03:01,560
minimal installation, and all the packages are still there to get what is effectively

50
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:03,720
Ubuntu Budgie or Ubuntu Mate.

51
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:08,500
It's really just the ISOs that they are not going to be making available now.

52
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:13,280
So I don't think it's as big an issue as some people would like to say, but we saw this

53
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,280
last year, didn't we?

54
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:19,320
This ending of 32-bit support with Arch and various other distros.

55
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:24,320
And I think 2018 is the year that 32-bit will just die altogether, really, apart from the

56
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:26,640
odd specialist distro, maybe.

57
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:31,240
But one thing you mentioned there about Ubuntu Mate being associated with old hardware, that's

58
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:35,640
something that Martin Winpress is very keen to not have happen, that association.

59
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:40,680
Because as far as he's concerned, it is just a modern distro.

60
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:45,960
And okay, it might have a traditional paradigm, but that doesn't mean that it is aimed at

61
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,160
low-end hardware.

62
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:53,440
I think something like Lubuntu with LXD or LXQt, that is aimed at low-end hardware.

63
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:55,120
But don't say that about Mate.

64
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,960
You might upset him.

65
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:57,960
Or your favorite, Ubuntu.

66
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:02,360
Actually, that's one of my favorite things about Ubuntu Mate, is that you can take advantage

67
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:08,260
of absolutely modern hardware and have that traditional paradigm workflow for whichever

68
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:13,080
one that you potentially like, because you can switch between a bunch of different layouts.

69
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,880
It's one of the tools they have built into the distro.

70
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,840
So it really accommodates that.

71
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:22,000
But I think it still has, Mate itself might have that association.

72
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,040
Perhaps not Ubuntu Mate, but Mate itself.

73
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:29,600
But you look at this, it's really about the economics for the project.

74
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,600
There is less to test.

75
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:35,600
There is less security surface that they have to worry about.

76
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:38,800
There is a simplification in the code that they're shipping.

77
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:41,000
And there is a focus for the project.

78
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:45,840
Not to mention, it makes it easier from a QA standpoint, because they can focus on 64-bit

79
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:51,200
hardware and stop trying to keep some 32-bit old machine alive that the project may not

80
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,760
even have available to them.

81
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:54,840
32-bit hardware is getting scarcer and scarcer.

82
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:59,360
So there is all of these economic factors that make the project more efficient, it helps

83
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:04,160
them get their job done better, and it gives them a simplification, which you know they

84
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:06,240
could always use.

85
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,160
It's too hard of an opportunity to pass up.

86
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,560
And like you said earlier, I think we're going to see this spread.

87
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:14,480
Yeah, I wonder if we're going to be sitting here next week talking about all the other

88
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,880
flavors maybe.

89
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:16,880
I don't know.

90
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:21,200
But one flavor that you wouldn't expect it to be would be Lubuntu.

91
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:26,080
And they made the news this week on one of the Jupiter Broadcasting shows, didn't they,

92
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:31,600
on Ask Noah, when Simon Quigley came on and announced that finally they're moving to LXQt

93
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,960
for the main version in 1810.

94
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:37,160
This is a great milestone to see because the project's been working on this for like three

95
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:38,160
years.

96
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:40,800
We're going to finally see it happen in Lubuntu 1810.

97
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:44,320
It'll be the first release to ship with LXQt as default.

98
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:46,680
Simon goes into details on Ask Noah.

99
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:51,080
But the basics are is that the primary goal here is to offer users a lightweight computing

100
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:55,400
environment that will run on machines that have a wide range of hardware, some older

101
00:05:55,400 --> 00:06:00,160
hardware as well as more modern hardware, but use a mature LXQt environment.

102
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:04,800
Now you probably guessed that Qt in there is Qt, which is a modern toolkit that the

103
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:07,120
Plasma desktop is built off of.

104
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:13,880
So you get a lot of the benefits of Plasma's desktop, the Qt 5 toolkit, on a lightweight,

105
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:16,520
faster, fast, simple desktop environment.

106
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:20,960
I don't know if it's there for me personally, but I am really watching this with a lot of

107
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:21,960
anticipation.

108
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:28,800
I could see after the 1804 release cycle, so my next distro could easily see be powered

109
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:29,800
by LXQt.

110
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:35,160
Well, I had a quick look at Lubuntu Next, the 1804 version today, and I was quite impressed

111
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:36,160
with it.

112
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:40,000
It's been a while since I checked in with LXQt, and it's come a long way.

113
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:45,320
There are a few things that are slightly not right for me, and things that could be worked

114
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:49,520
on, and they've got, well, two years before the next LTS.

115
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:55,120
So I can kind of see where you're coming from with this, because it's just so lightweight

116
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,840
and simple.

117
00:06:56,840 --> 00:07:02,200
And because it is based on Qt 5, it means that it is modern, and you're going to have

118
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:07,480
all of the benefits with high DPI support and all the rest of it that Qt brings.

119
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:14,920
And they could not stay on LXDE for another LTS after this one, because LXDE is just totally

120
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:16,460
dead at this point, isn't it?

121
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:23,440
The only people who are interested in maintaining it are the Raspberry Pi Foundation, and is

122
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:24,440
that really relevant?

123
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:28,720
I suppose it is to the however many million Raspberry Pis they've sold, but to the rest

124
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:33,280
of us in the Linux community, I think we just have to accept that LXDE is dead.

125
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:36,080
I have a real soft spot for it, because it is so lightweight.

126
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:40,760
I've loved it on low-end hardware, but I think you just have to accept the future, much like

127
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:43,600
with the 32-bit thing going away.

128
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:47,680
You just have to accept LXDE going away, and it seems to be an admirable replacement to

129
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:48,680
me.

130
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:51,740
I agree, and I wouldn't be surprised if the Raspberry Pi Foundation doesn't just embrace

131
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:54,000
the Qt version down the road.

132
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:59,680
When this transition is complete in the 18.10 timeframe, we're going to see the discontinuation

133
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:00,680
of Lubuntu Next.

134
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:07,560
It'll just become main Lubuntu, and the current LXDE version, the 18.04, will become known

135
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:09,480
as Lubuntu Classic.

136
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:11,640
I do wonder how long that's going to last, though.

137
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:13,680
I wouldn't have thought until the next LTS.

138
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:16,320
Yeah, I'm not going to bet against you on that one.

139
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:20,080
Well, speaking of things that might not be sticking around for a while, it seems the

140
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:22,720
Korora project has run into some troubles.

141
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:27,120
Yeah, now this is a real shame, because Korora is a great distro, as far as I'm concerned,

142
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:31,480
or it was, maybe we have to talk about it in the past tense at this point.

143
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:35,840
Because it takes Fedora and just removes all the fiddling, and it's got a really great

144
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:40,760
default package set, and just all of the defaults generally are really easy, and I think it

145
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:44,800
is the ideal introduction to Fedora for new users.

146
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:49,560
So now that it's probably going to go away, that kind of sucks.

147
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:53,500
Yeah, this week the project took to their blog and said for the foreseeable future,

148
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:57,300
they will have no updates, they will not be tracking Fedora 28.

149
00:08:57,300 --> 00:09:02,560
Now the repositories will stay online, but there's not going to be any new packages or

150
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:03,560
updates.

151
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:04,560
They need to take a breather.

152
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:09,080
They say they have to just take a break, and they will keep the servers online with the

153
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:10,640
intention to come back eventually.

154
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:15,160
Yeah, and there's a comment on Reddit from one of the Korora developers, which basically

155
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:17,880
says that the lead dev just disappeared.

156
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:20,280
Yeah, I saw that thread too.

157
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:23,660
And I read through it and was shaking my head almost the entire time.

158
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:28,760
Not because I was disappointed, but because I feel like I've seen this before.

159
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:33,840
Anyone who's done some distro hopping in their day has run into a distro that they just love,

160
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,800
and then the project comes to an end.

161
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:41,680
And the story often starts with a lead of the project that is really the vision person,

162
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:46,240
the primary driver of the project, and it just becomes too much because of internet

163
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:52,000
trolls or responsibilities or insert various life reasons, and they go AFK for an extended

164
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
period of time.

165
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,700
And then you have the lieutenants of the project who do an admiral job just keeping things

166
00:09:56,700 --> 00:10:00,360
running for as long as they can, maintaining packages.

167
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:03,760
As long as all the services stay online and the domains are paid for, they can kind of

168
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:05,280
keep things moving.

169
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:11,260
And it just sort of slowly devolves into a demoralized story where the rest of the team

170
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:12,680
becomes burned out.

171
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:14,920
They feel like they can't affect change.

172
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:18,900
And of course, the entire time, they're trying to keep everything public-facing, looking

173
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:21,600
all great and smiley faces.

174
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:27,080
But the even deeper troubling thing here is Korora is just one of many stories this week.

175
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:28,800
In fact, another one is Void Linux.

176
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:32,360
Void Linux is going through almost the same exact issue.

177
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:34,600
Their project leader has gone MIA.

178
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:39,120
The remaining core team doesn't have access to some of the essential infrastructure tools

179
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:43,360
like their GitHub page and the domain names for the most popular domain.

180
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:45,080
It's just an awful situation.

181
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:49,180
And Void Linux and Korora Linux have very similar stories here.

182
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:52,700
It's enough to put you off using a small distro altogether, isn't it?

183
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:54,480
Just in case something like this happens.

184
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,240
Yeah, I'd really hope not, Joe.

185
00:10:56,240 --> 00:11:00,960
But I've gotten several notes from listeners this week who have said just that, that they

186
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:03,920
feel like they've been burned by going with a small distro.

187
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:09,640
And if you think about what that means, that's very dangerous because Linux thrives in an

188
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:13,560
environment where any idea is technically capable of succeeding.

189
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:15,520
We wouldn't have Ubuntu MATE.

190
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:17,840
We wouldn't have elementary OS.

191
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:22,040
We wouldn't have a bunch of other distributions that started with one or two people, in some

192
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:27,320
cases just one person, if people didn't take a chance on a small distribution.

193
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:32,200
At the same time, as Linux becomes more of the operating system for your new developers,

194
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:36,520
the web developers or your sys admins and your DevOps category labels that people like

195
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:43,440
to toss around, as Linux becomes that OS, the tolerance for this level of failure where

196
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:49,040
the OS you're using just becomes unsupported is going to be low.

197
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:53,980
And I think it will force a consolidation to larger distributions, which is sort of

198
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:56,040
creating big Linux.

199
00:11:56,040 --> 00:12:01,880
Maybe we've always been there, but I've always had the feeling that a new idea, something

200
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:06,960
like a Solus could come along and be disruptive and just on its technical merits could get

201
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:09,400
a decent user following.

202
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:11,200
But Solus is a great example.

203
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:15,000
Elementary OS is another where, yes, there is some governance in place, but both of those

204
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,560
projects are very much driven by one person.

205
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:23,800
And if that one person's circumstances change, then who knows what can happen with it, especially

206
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:27,080
if those circumstances change quickly.

207
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:29,960
And as we know, that can happen in life.

208
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:32,280
And so you do worry about them.

209
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:38,320
And that does put me off moving over to one of those types of distributions, even though

210
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:41,240
Solus is technically absolutely brilliant.

211
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:48,400
I mean, EO package as a package manager is just so fast and so straightforward and powerful

212
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:50,240
at the same time.

213
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:53,800
And not to mention all of the GUI tools that Ikey's built on that as well.

214
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:59,720
But I'm just reluctant to invest in it until it gets to a certain size and it can't get

215
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:01,960
to a certain size if people don't invest in it.

216
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:04,600
And so you get this vicious circle happening.

217
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:08,960
And I think that you might be right that it's very difficult for smaller distros to break

218
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:11,780
through and become the next major one.

219
00:13:11,780 --> 00:13:13,600
So I actually want to nitpick a bit on what you just said.

220
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:18,560
I would not compare Solus and elementary OS anymore in light of what we're seeing with

221
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:20,440
Void and Karora.

222
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:27,100
So in my eyes, a distribution like elementary OS has several clear paths to monetization.

223
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:29,820
Maybe they're not making as much money as they'd like with the App Center.

224
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:33,960
And maybe a lot of folks aren't adding a dollar amount when they hit that download.

225
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:38,460
But there are clear built-in paths to revenue to make a distribution sustainable.

226
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:41,240
And as a result, they've slowly added staff.

227
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:44,600
There's only a couple of people that are technically full-time, maybe even one.

228
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:51,940
But they have a structure in place that gives a path to revenue as their user base increases.

229
00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:55,680
Then you look at distributions like Karora and Void Linux and perhaps Solus.

230
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:57,600
I'm not sure what the situation is there.

231
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:01,700
They have a Patreon, I suppose, where there's not a clear path to revenue sustainability.

232
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:04,360
And I think that's what actually makes the difference.

233
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:05,360
I'm going to be honest.

234
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:06,360
You look at podcasts.

235
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:09,440
Podcasts that have advertisers stick around for decades.

236
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:13,100
Podcasts that don't have advertisers stick around for maybe 60 episodes.

237
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:14,400
It's the same thing.

238
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:19,440
When you put all of yourself into making something, having a path to revenue sustainability makes

239
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:23,040
the difference between you disappearing and sticking around.

240
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:28,920
And I know, as GNU slash Linux users, we hate to admit that money, good old capitalism plays

241
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:29,920
a role here.

242
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:31,760
But it, I think, does.

243
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:37,040
So I think the lesson from Void and Karora is that if a distribution doesn't have a clear

244
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:42,760
path to long-term sustainability when it comes to revenue, it's risky to bet on that distribution.

245
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:45,400
It doesn't mean that you shouldn't use the distribution.

246
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:46,400
I think it's great.

247
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:49,200
I love Arch Linux as an example.

248
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:53,000
But I think it's something you at least have to factor into your decision when it's part

249
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:58,120
of your workflow or your development setup or perhaps a production environment.

250
00:14:58,120 --> 00:14:59,640
You have to consider these factors.

251
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:00,800
Well, that is true.

252
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:06,360
But one of the greatest things about Linux is that you can migrate over to another distro

253
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:08,120
relatively easily.

254
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:12,720
In some cases, it can just be copy your home directory over.

255
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:13,720
Job done.

256
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:18,300
Switching from Ubuntu to Fedora, say, it can be so easy to migrate.

257
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:22,840
And if you're on a smaller distro and then things go wrong with it, then you've always

258
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:26,960
got that backup of the many other big distros that are rock solid.

259
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:28,160
That's not always the case.

260
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:29,800
So take Void Linux, for example.

261
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:35,640
One of the things that is standout about Void is that it doesn't use systemd.

262
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:37,120
There are less and less choices.

263
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:43,720
I mean, it's coming down to Dev1, FreeBSD, Gen2, and several others that don't use systemd,

264
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:44,720
and that's it.

265
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:49,040
So there were unique aspects amongst others, not just the failure to use systemd or the

266
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:53,560
neglect to use systemd or the decision, but there were other factors about Void.

267
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:55,680
But I think that's something to consider.

268
00:15:55,680 --> 00:16:00,000
There are certain distributions that offer something no other distribution does, much

269
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:05,920
like I feel Solus does as well and elementary OS, that there really is no one-to-one transition

270
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:07,160
in the Linux community.

271
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:10,280
It's about as disruptive as moving from, say, Mac OS to Linux.

272
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:11,400
I don't know, though.

273
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:16,840
I can see your point that it is maybe not quite as easy as I'm saying, but if you can

274
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:23,120
get the same desktop environment on a different system, then it can be broadly similar.

275
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:29,120
Yes, some of your workflow might change, but you can at least get it looking similar and

276
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:33,800
laid out and get all your files in the same places.

277
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:38,920
Maybe less so with something like Void, which is quite different, but certainly if you're

278
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:43,520
looking at something that's based on Ubuntu, I mean, to go from elementary, well, I suppose

279
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:47,520
again that's a bad example because of Pantheon, but yeah, maybe I'm wrong and maybe you're

280
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:48,520
right.

281
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:49,520
I don't know, Joe.

282
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:53,660
As you started describing, I thought, really, most of these end users are probably just

283
00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:58,700
firing up a web browser once the desktop session starts, so maybe it matters less and less.

284
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:00,800
It's really on the server where it matters more now.

285
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:01,800
Yeah.

286
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:03,520
Well, a web browser and a terminal, I think.

287
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:04,520
Fair enough.

288
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:05,520
To be fair.

289
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:06,520
Yeah.

290
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:07,520
Absolutely.

291
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:08,520
LinuxAcademy.com.

292
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:13,440
Go there to learn more about Linux Academy.

293
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:17,720
Start this show and sign up for a free seven-day trial to a platform that is built by Linux

294
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:22,920
enthusiasts and packed full of information to teach you more about everything built around

295
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:24,920
Linux and the core essentials.

296
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:28,520
Linux Academy is a full-featured training library with everything you need to learn

297
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:30,520
new skills and advance your career.

298
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:34,720
With self-paced, in-depth video courses on every Linux, cloud, and DevOps topic, my favorite

299
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,920
feature is the hands-on, scenario-based labs.

300
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:40,480
Well, maybe my second favorite feature then would be the instructor mentoring full-time

301
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:44,440
human beings that are ready to help and happy to do so.

302
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:47,760
And when they're not helping you, they're constantly adding and revising content on

303
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:49,000
Linux Academy.

304
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:54,280
Linux Academy just released 21 new courses and a couple of cool new features for learning

305
00:17:54,280 --> 00:18:00,580
AWS, including some quests and challenges, 150 hands-on learning activities, and a new

306
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:04,980
episode of Scale Your Code, which I used to talk about quite a while ago, which is a one-on-one

307
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:09,240
interview that they do with people in the industry where you can pick up the things

308
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:12,680
they've learned, how to scale, how to build a team, how to create a culture in a large

309
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:13,880
IT environment.

310
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:17,240
Scale Your Code has all of that, and it's part of Linux Academy.

311
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:21,720
It's just one of the many things that makes your subscription valuable, plus the practice

312
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:26,560
exams and quizzes, which will help you get ready for the big certification exams.

316
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:41,560
Okay, let's talk about Fedora 28 that was released this week, and there's a lot to cover

317
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:42,560
here.

318
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:47,360
Workstation, server, atomic host, even atomic workstation.

319
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:53,020
So I think it makes sense to start with the desktop version that they call workstation,

320
00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:55,280
and it's a pretty solid release, isn't it?

321
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:56,280
Solid.

322
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:57,280
The jury is still out.

323
00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:00,040
I'm pretty impressed so far.

324
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:03,440
Nothing like I've ever experienced would be the way I would put it.

325
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:06,520
This is Fedora, but not like you know it.

326
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:08,480
In a weird way, it's just like you know it.

327
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:13,140
If you've been using Fedora release after release, this is a pretty incremental update.

328
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:16,400
If you've been using a different distribution and you haven't tried Fedora out for three

329
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:19,460
or four releases, your mind is gonna be blown.

330
00:19:19,460 --> 00:19:25,320
For the first time, they're making it easy for users to just turn on third-party software

331
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:31,600
repositories, like RPM Fusion, like the proprietary Nvidia driver, like Chrome.

332
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:36,960
When you launch software and it has a blue drop-down box that comes up and says, would

333
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:40,040
you like to turn on third-party repositories?

334
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:46,000
You hit yes or enable, and now you have all of the software.

335
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:51,880
All of the software that in every review for the last, well, since Fedora first shipped

336
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:57,520
a release, I complained was a pain in the arse for people to install, is now just a

337
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:59,520
click away.

338
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:04,960
One click, and now you can search for Chrome in the GNOME software, and you can install

339
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:11,920
not Chromium, you can install Chrome on Fedora after you've just installed it from the ISO.

340
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:15,920
If you decide maybe you've made a bad moral decision, you go into the software sources

341
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:20,500
preferences or whatever they call it, and it's a big red remove button.

342
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:23,600
You click that, and all of that proprietary garbage is gone.

343
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:25,000
Yeah, Fedora, but not as we know it.

344
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:29,280
I think that's the only way to describe it, because Fedora has been known as being a freedom

345
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:30,320
loving distribution.

346
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:37,440
It's not quite FSF standards, but it is very much known for being the free software distribution.

347
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:41,920
For them to make it so easy, personally, I think it's a great decision, because it's

348
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:46,760
opt-in, and you could easily say, no thanks, I'll stick with free software only, but it

349
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:48,880
just makes it so much more accessible.

350
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:50,720
It's one of the things that has put me off before.

351
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:55,760
Yes, okay, I do know how to get RPM fusion working and all the rest of it, but to make

352
00:20:55,760 --> 00:21:00,360
it so easy, it's suddenly a much more appealing prospect to run this on the desktop.

353
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:03,960
You got to look at this from the software developer's perspective, where they have to

354
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:06,400
test in Chrome as part of their job.

355
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,820
They have to use machine learning as part of their job.

356
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:12,800
That's why they were provided a laptop with an NVIDIA card in it to begin with.

357
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:17,980
Fedora is just simply trying to address that need, while also not diminishing the experience

358
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:22,520
for users who don't want any of that crap installed, and they've really walked the line

359
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:28,160
here in a way that, after all of the years of really begging for this from the project,

360
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:30,600
I never imagined it would be done so well.

361
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:34,240
They've implemented it in a way that doesn't offend people that just want free software,

362
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:38,880
but yet they've made the experience simple and clear enough for those who've just switched

363
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,880
to Fedora and want to get to work.

364
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:47,520
I'm really impressed, and that polish extends to all aspects of Fedora 28's release.

365
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:49,360
It is a cohesive experience.

366
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:53,640
Let's focus on the server and cloud spins for a moment, because this is becoming a more

367
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:55,640
and more compelling aspect of Fedora.

368
00:21:55,640 --> 00:22:01,760
I have had a Fedora 24 cloud install up on Digital Ocean since Fedora 24 came out, and

369
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:04,760
I loaded Nextcloud inside a Docker container.

370
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:08,600
Now one of the things I've been doing, like a test lab, is upgrading that sucker every

371
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:11,160
single Fedora release since 24.

372
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:13,520
I upgraded it this weekend to 28.

373
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:15,280
I have yet to have anything break.

374
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:19,520
I always reboot the whole system and make sure Nextcloud's working.

375
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:24,600
Granted, it's a test lab machine, but that is a lot of upgrades I have done now.

376
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:27,840
And I think that's maybe the bigger story here.

377
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:33,960
So there is a small support window for Fedora releases, and I think that's kind of the cloud

378
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:36,800
that hangs over Fedora when you go to use it in production.

379
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:41,360
And to address that, the project is taking on a lot of different tracks that sort of

380
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,880
make that release window irrelevant.

381
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:48,120
So they have modularity, which maybe we can talk about more in a moment.

382
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:51,280
And then they have made a ton of improvements to DNF.

383
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:55,600
And then they have these cloud and server spins, or additions, if you will.

384
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:58,240
The cloud edition is a minimal install that's great on a VPS.

385
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:02,920
I put it on a Digital Ocean droplet, and I loaded Cockpit onto that sucker, and I've

386
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:09,000
been managing now for years, actual years now, upgrade after upgrade, running Nextcloud.

387
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:15,160
So this weekend, after having just another terrific Fedora experience, I made the decision

388
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:22,800
to consolidate three of my systems down to one Fedora 28 system, managed all with Cockpit,

389
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:25,040
using containers and virtualization.

390
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:28,060
And it's a really top-notch experience.

391
00:23:28,060 --> 00:23:31,920
First of all, one of the things that I appreciate as a former sysadmin is the documentation

392
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:35,020
around Fedora has really built up over the years.

393
00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:38,880
And it's not hurt by the fact that a lot of those commands you can use on CentOS, and

394
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:40,960
you can use on Red Hat Enterprise Linux.

395
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:43,480
So there's just so much documentation these days.

396
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:47,700
Like peak Ubuntu documentation, I feel like that's where Fedora is reaching now.

397
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:53,120
But the confidence they've given me now in release after release upgrades, working, has

398
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:55,920
really changed my thinking about the support window.

399
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:59,600
And then you combine modularity, which you got more information recently when you had

400
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:00,600
a chat with Matthew Miller.

401
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:04,600
Yeah, I had a great chat with him on the first episode of Late Night Linux Extra, which is

402
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:07,600
a new show that I've started, latenightlinux.com, get the plug in.

403
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:12,500
And it is something that I could see a lot of people really using.

404
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:15,140
He talked about people using different versions of Node, for example.

405
00:24:15,140 --> 00:24:19,440
And if you upgrade to a new version of Fedora, you don't necessarily want to upgrade the

406
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:21,360
version of the software that you run in.

407
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:25,280
And having that modularity does mean that it is less painful to have such a short support

408
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:26,280
window.

409
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:27,280
Right.

410
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:30,840
And the idea there is you could just install a version of Node.js and then the OS can float.

411
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:37,500
Now you combine that with containers and virtualization, and upgrades start to become less and less

412
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:38,500
relevant.

413
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:42,960
They're more of an implementation detail than they are the core of what's running all of

414
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:44,040
your applications.

415
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:48,920
I've now gone through several releases and I'm still running the same exact Nextcloud

416
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:51,360
setup and everything's working great.

417
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:55,600
And the base OS has made considerable changes in the meantime.

418
00:24:55,600 --> 00:25:00,520
And it's really just completely unaware, Nextcloud is just completely unaware of any of it happening.

419
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:05,000
And so really in summary, I'm so impressed with Fedora on the server now that I'm going

420
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:12,120
to consolidate several of my different VPSs into one running on Fedora 28, using Cockpit

421
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:14,760
to manage those containers and those VMs.

422
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:19,640
And I'll just keep upgrading the base OS and continue to use Cockpit to manage it, which

423
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:23,340
is a fantastic remote web GUI.

424
00:25:23,340 --> 00:25:25,980
It's nothing like the webman of the past.

425
00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:30,160
It's really one of the best remote administration implementations I've ever seen from not only

426
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:35,240
a functionality standpoint and integration standpoint, but also from a security design

427
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:36,240
standpoint.

428
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:39,560
And it's something I don't think the project is getting enough credit for.

429
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:44,000
It is something that back in the day we would have been blowing our minds over.

430
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,200
And now we're like, oh yeah, whatever, it's just something Fedora has.

431
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:48,060
No, you should really go look at Cockpit.

432
00:25:48,060 --> 00:25:49,060
It's pretty great.

433
00:25:49,060 --> 00:25:52,600
Now all of that said, I'm still not putting on my workstation.

434
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:54,960
In fact, there was sort of a thrill I had.

435
00:25:54,960 --> 00:26:00,200
I had my Kubuntu workstation in front of me with a bunch of SSH windows into Fedora boxes

436
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:01,200
this weekend.

437
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:02,360
That was my weekend.

438
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:07,080
And I'm not switching out my main workstation, because when it comes to GUI applications

439
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:11,760
and desktop environments, they are less forgiving about some of these upgrades.

440
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:13,400
It's less transactional.

441
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:17,480
There's more esoteric configurations and extensions or applets.

442
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:23,520
And I just still don't trust a eight or nine or 10 month window for my distribution and

443
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:24,600
my desktop environment.

444
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:27,640
I want that to be static and stable so I can get my work done.

445
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:32,920
But my server, where things are containerized and isolated and virtualized, that's a different

446
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:33,920
story these days.

447
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:35,400
It's sort of flipped for me.

448
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:37,720
And it is a very stock experience, isn't it?

449
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:43,800
Similarly with the spins, I tried out the XFCE spin and it looks very much like stock

450
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:44,800
XFCE.

451
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:49,080
It's not quite 100% stock, but it's much closer than something like Xubuntu that I'm used

452
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:50,080
to.

453
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:56,120
And I don't know, you can see a distro like Ubuntu taking GNOME and adding some real value

454
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:57,120
there.

455
00:26:57,120 --> 00:27:00,960
Whereas Fedora, I suppose the value is that it is more or less just upstream GNOME.

456
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:04,560
Yeah, and I think you can make a pretty good argument for both, especially from an end

457
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:05,640
user standpoint.

458
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:06,640
But I like it.

459
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:08,680
I kind of appreciate that they do that.

460
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:11,240
And I think they have a really good implementation of GNOME 328.

461
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:12,760
It's a solid release.

462
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:16,320
And I've talked about this extensively in Linux Unplugged, but they have done some real

463
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:21,760
pioneering work to make Thunderbolt 3 better than it is on any other desktop platform.

464
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:25,180
And that is one of the most impressive things you have to give Fedora 28.

465
00:27:25,180 --> 00:27:28,440
And you're starting to see that materialized in other GNOME-based distributions, but they

466
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:30,420
pioneered the work on Bolt.

467
00:27:30,420 --> 00:27:35,240
And I, as a user of Thunderbolt, really appreciate their work in that particular area.

468
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:36,520
So it's a great desktop.

469
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:37,680
It's a solid release.

470
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:41,040
I'm just not really looking forward to upgrading it all the time.

471
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:42,720
And there's promises of modularity.

472
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:45,860
There's promises of atomic workstation.

473
00:27:45,860 --> 00:27:50,200
But they're just not there yet for a workstation use.

474
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:53,200
And that's kind of what I keep coming back to with Fedora.

475
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:55,420
It's getting better in all of these areas.

476
00:27:55,420 --> 00:27:59,680
But for workstation, professional use, I don't know if it's there yet.

477
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:03,900
I bet a lot of people in the audience are using it right now and think I'm just crazy.

478
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:05,680
But it's just my personal opinion.

479
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:10,520
When you have to upgrade every nine or so months, it's not a great situation.

480
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:13,860
I would almost prefer to see something like Fedora rolling.

481
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:17,440
And I know raw hides a thing, but I would like to see an official Fedora rolling where

482
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:23,240
I could maybe pin certain things, like maybe a whole metapackage group like Plasma or my

483
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:24,240
web browser.

484
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:28,000
I could pin to specific versions and get back ports from Red Hat Enterprise Linux.

485
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,400
And I could have other parts that are rolling and moving.

486
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:34,320
I know it sounds crazy, but I think if any project could pull that off right now, it's

487
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:35,320
Fedora.

488
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:38,960
Well, you're talking to someone sitting in front of Zubuntu 16.04 still.

489
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:41,560
I haven't upgraded my main workstation.

490
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:43,040
And I'm not going to for a while.

491
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:48,400
16.04 is fine and I'll upgrade it to 18.04 in good time and then probably stick on that

492
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:49,740
for another couple of years.

493
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:54,060
So this model is very much not for me, but I can see the appeal of it.

494
00:28:54,060 --> 00:28:58,520
If you are a developer, if you want the latest stuff all the time, but you don't want to

495
00:28:58,520 --> 00:29:03,440
have the real bleeding edge like Arch, it seems to be sitting somewhere in the middle

496
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:04,440
of that.

497
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:06,520
I disagree because I think you could flip it around.

498
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:08,400
You don't have to just subscribe to the latest stuff.

499
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:12,720
See, I think if they pull this off right, you could sit on a Fedora workstation and

500
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:16,240
say, I want this specific version of XFCE.

501
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:21,920
I want this specific version of Audacity, this specific version of FFmpeg.

502
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:24,600
But you can let LS and all the GNU tools roll.

503
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:26,500
I don't care about the GNU tools.

504
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:27,920
Keep my grep fresh.

505
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:32,520
But I definitely want to make sure I only have this version of XFCE for as long as it's

506
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:33,880
supported in RHEL.

507
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:36,440
But I could have the Fedora version of LS.

508
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:38,560
And I think that would actually work for you pretty well.

509
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:41,120
Well, that feels a bit speculative.

510
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:43,600
And you mentioned the Atomic workstation.

511
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:47,960
They've changed the name to Silverblue, at least that's the code name for now.

512
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:52,640
I think that it's nowhere near being ready at this point for daily use, certainly for

513
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:58,120
most people, but it is good to see them innovating and thinking long term and not just being

514
00:29:58,120 --> 00:29:59,120
stale.

515
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:01,560
They need to do stuff like this, don't they?

516
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:02,560
Yeah.

517
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:07,580
And one of the really interesting things about Atomic is it's created in an era of big infrastructure.

518
00:30:07,580 --> 00:30:11,040
So you can like one click deploy it to Amazon.

519
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:14,440
It is available as a droplet, one click droplet on DigitalOcean.

520
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:19,780
The latest version Fedora 28, when you go to quote unquote download Fedora Atomic, there

521
00:30:19,780 --> 00:30:24,680
are options on the Fedora Atomic project page to just spin it up on a VM or you can download

522
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:25,680
the ISO.

523
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:29,800
It really is a distribution that's created to run like in a VM or in virtualization.

524
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:32,360
I gave it a go and it's so cool.

525
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:38,040
I was doing things like Atomic run and then I would say like the name of a container.

526
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:40,320
And maybe that in this case, the container was cockpit.

527
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:46,080
I would say Atomic run cockpit and it would go out and pull down all of the individual

528
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:52,080
dependencies as containers and build all of this Docker stuff up and run it all in containers

529
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:53,640
and spin it up for me.

530
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:57,160
But at the same time, it was outputting like the file system changes.

531
00:30:57,160 --> 00:31:01,840
So while there was a lot of container magic happening, I was very connected to the actual

532
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:04,400
work that was being done on my file system.

533
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:08,620
And I don't know how to really quantify that other than just saying that's the kind of

534
00:31:08,620 --> 00:31:13,060
output and an interface that really gives me confidence in a system.

535
00:31:13,060 --> 00:31:17,140
The magic scripts work and I also get output on everything they just did.

536
00:31:17,140 --> 00:31:22,860
And I really had the sense that if I was building out a Red Hat shop right now and I knew we

537
00:31:22,860 --> 00:31:26,680
were going to use a lot of CentOS and Red Hat Enterprise Linux, Fedora Atomic would

538
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:29,600
absolutely be a contender in this space.

539
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:30,760
It's a neat idea.

540
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:35,740
The core idea here is the base OS can be updated in transactional updates.

541
00:31:35,740 --> 00:31:37,960
Something goes wrong, you just move back.

542
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:43,640
All of the applications, even some of your administrative tools, are in containers.

543
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:47,200
And they sort of float independently of your base operating system.

544
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:53,400
So you can do flip upgrades, bring a system completely up to date and not even touch your

545
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:54,400
containers.

546
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:55,400
They still stay connected.

547
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:56,400
They're still talking to their storage.

548
00:31:56,400 --> 00:32:00,000
And the idea here is your release windows kind of go away.

549
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:05,440
And you just keep the transactional updates going over time and the system just runs until

550
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:06,440
the hardware dies.

551
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:10,560
Yeah, it is a huge release and there's a lot of moving parts with Fedora these days.

552
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:12,600
Yeah, I'm going to plug again for you.

553
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:17,040
Go check out Late Night Linux Extra because Joe had Matthew Miller on there to kind of

554
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:19,600
explain all of it in their own language.

555
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:20,600
And it clicks.

556
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:22,120
It really clicks when he talks about it.

557
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:25,760
Also, bonus mention, Daniel Foray is on there to talk about the next version of elementary

558
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:26,760
OS as well.

559
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:28,200
So go check that out.

560
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:32,760

565
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:50,120
Snap.

566
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:53,640
We'll be back next Monday with our weekly take on the latest Linux and open source news.

567
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:55,040
I'm at Chris Elias.

568
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:56,400
