00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,880
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, our weekly take on Linux and the open source world.

2
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:20,080
This is episode 79, recorded on November 11th, 2018.

3
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:21,080
I'm Chris.

4
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:22,080
And I'm Joe.

5
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:23,080
Hello, Joe.

6
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:26,880
It's good to be connected with you, and it's on a week where we have some upsets.

7
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:29,800
We have some big wins and some surprises.

8
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:35,320
Let's start with the controversy, and that is, can you or can you not boot Linux on these

9
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:37,200
new Macs with the T2 chip?

10
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,360
Well, the answer to that is, it's complicated.

11
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:47,360
So this T2 chip is an ARM chip that is in the new MacBook Air and the new Mac Mini,

12
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:51,440
and it's been in the iMac Pro for a while.

13
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:54,480
And it controls a lot of stuff to do with security on these Macs.

14
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:57,720
And one of the things that it controls is secure boot.

15
00:00:57,720 --> 00:01:04,880
And by default, it doesn't have the certificate to boot anything other than Mac OS or a bootcamp

16
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:07,100
version of Windows 10.

17
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:12,800
So you could say that they won't boot Linux, but you can turn that secure boot off, and

18
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:15,200
then you can boot into Linux.

19
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,200
Right.

20
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:20,940
It's secure boot, but not quite as we know it, because by default, it ships and only

21
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:22,240
Mac OS will ship.

22
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:28,300
A verified version, a signed copy of Mac OS from Apple is the only operating system that

23
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:29,840
will ship on this hardware.

24
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:31,380
That's part of the security nature of it.

25
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:36,120
So that way, you can't accidentally load a compromised version of Mac OS.

26
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:41,040
You can turn that off, but like Joe said, it's not necessarily following secure boot

27
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,040
as we know it.

28
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:47,320
It doesn't have that famous Microsoft security certificate, but there is a signed version

29
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:48,760
when you use bootcamp.

30
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:54,280
Apple manages that certificate for you using the bootcamp assistant, and when it creates

31
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:58,280
the installation media, it is impossible to boot Windows 10 on that hardware.

32
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:03,480
But even if you have that certificate, it doesn't necessarily mean you have any drivers

33
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:10,360
for the T2 chip, because the T2 chip not only does security, but it's also the SATA controller.

34
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:16,480
And so that's why even if you disable secure boot, and then you can boot into Linux, try

35
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:20,960
running Gparted or an installer, and it just simply doesn't see the internal SSD.

36
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:26,240
You could install it to like a Thunderbolt device or USB drive or whatever, but you can't

37
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:32,620
get it installed to the internal SSD of these new Macs, and that is what has annoyed a lot

38
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:33,620
of people.

39
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:38,680
Yeah, and I know breaking news here, the best system to run Linux isn't a Mac.

40
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:40,440
Everybody sit down and take a deep breath.

41
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:44,140
I know you're shocked by that, but I was having a conversation with a developer at Linux Academy

42
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:46,960
who uses Fedora on a Mac Mini.

43
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:50,480
And I was talking to him about it when the new Mac Mini came out, and he said, the old

44
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:54,680
Mac Mini had been around for so long that those of us that wanted to use Linux on it

45
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:57,940
had it really figured out, like you really knew all the ins and outs.

46
00:02:57,940 --> 00:03:02,520
And so it was actually a fairly viable Linux workstation that took up a small footprint,

47
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:05,880
and if you needed Mac OS for some reason, you could dual boot into it.

48
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:09,600
Sort of like people used to dual boot into Windows, well, there's a group of Linux users

49
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:15,200
that want to dual boot into Mac OS, but this new Mac Mini doesn't provide that currently

50
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:18,600
just simply because the driver support isn't there, and that's really the nature of the

51
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:19,600
upset.

52
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:23,800
But Chris's bit of advice would be just buy another piece of hardware, just get something

53
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:26,640
else besides a Mac, and you don't have to fight with this.

54
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:30,300
Not only are there vendors that make computers specifically born to run Linux, but there's

55
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:34,680
also machines that are sold by a lot of known vendors that are very simple to get Linux

56
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:37,920
running on it, and you can get to work instead of fight with the hardware.

57
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:42,860
Maybe down the road, Apple will acknowledge this need by developers, and they'll create

58
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:46,480
a signed version of the bootloader for Linux or something that the open source community

59
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:47,540
can use.

60
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:51,520
It's kind of confusing what they could actually do that could be scalable, but maybe there's

61
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:52,920
some action they could take.

62
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:56,400
But until Apple makes that effort, I wouldn't really vote with my wallet when it comes to

63
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,400
Apple hardware.

64
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:58,400
Personal opinion.

65
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,680
Well, I've got a confession to make.

66
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:02,840
I own two Macs.

67
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:06,740
The audience are probably not going to believe that, but don't worry, they're Core 2 duos.

68
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:11,200
One of them was given to me by Alan Pope on iMac, which has got a lovely screen, lovely

69
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:18,480
speakers, and I've also got an old MacBook Pro, the big 17-inch aluminum one.

70
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:19,480
The lunch tray.

71
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:24,840
Yeah, and that has got amazing speakers for a laptop, and that's what I use it for, media

72
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:25,840
consumption.

73
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:28,100
Now, the thing is, those two have both been abandoned by Apple.

74
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:31,440
They're not getting any more security updates on the old version of Mac OS that they're

75
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:32,440
running.

76
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:36,960
I think, actually, the laptop's actually an OS 10 Lion, I think that was before Mac OS.

77
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:40,920
Anyway, that is the angle that I'm looking at this from.

78
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:44,400
Right now, you would say, obviously, don't buy a Mac if you want to run Linux on it.

79
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:48,480
There's buy a Dell or entry-ware system 76, whatever.

80
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:50,920
But we're talking down the line here.

81
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:53,440
The used market, the hand-me-down scenario.

82
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:55,580
Yeah, exactly.

83
00:04:55,580 --> 00:04:59,600
And so that's where this is a problem for me.

84
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:05,240
If you can't install Linux on it now, then you might not be able to once it's been abandoned,

85
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:07,880
and it's not going to be supported for that long.

86
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:11,100
And this is very expensive hardware that is really good.

87
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:12,880
You can say whatever you want about Apple.

88
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:17,600
Their hardware is generally really good, and actually lasts quite a long time.

89
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:22,600
And the Core 2 Duo machines that I've got are working absolutely fine running GNU slash

90
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:23,600
Linux.

91
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,800
You know, proper, good, old-fashioned Linux.

92
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:31,280
And I say old-fashioned, they'll run the very latest kernel and all the security stuff.

93
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:33,160
You know, everything's fine with them.

94
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:35,860
Still getting plenty of life out of those old machines.

95
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:41,660
But don't you think by the time this new Mac Mini or MacBook Air gets to that hand-me-down

96
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:46,360
scenario point that perhaps the open source community will have come up with something?

97
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:49,520
Or is this T2 chip the big change here?

98
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:52,560
Because this is a custom Apple piece of kit here.

99
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:59,000
It's essentially an iOS device in a Mac using an ARM CPU with their A-series system on a

100
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:04,800
chip that even has the secure enclave, and that's doing the SATA management.

101
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:07,360
How could we ever have any potential of writing drivers for it?

102
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:10,080
I mean, does this T2 change the game, you think?

103
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:12,440
Maybe the hand-me-down scenario is gone now?

104
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:14,060
That's what I'm worried about.

105
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:16,360
But then never underestimate the open source community.

106
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:18,360
They are very clever people.

107
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:19,360
Right.

108
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:20,360
That's very true.

109
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:21,360
Yeah.

110
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:26,120
The only way it's likely to ever happen, in a weird ironic sense, is if this machine turns

111
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:29,640
out to be a success and a tunner on the market.

112
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:34,640
Which is, in a weird way, voting against making them compatible with Linux, even though that

113
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:37,880
is the very thing that drives their Linux compatibility.

114
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:39,280
That's an odd one.

115
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:42,880
Maybe we should just stay in the odd territory and let's talk about Microsoft and Linux,

116
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:44,960
which for some of us can still feel a bit odd.

117
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:45,960
Yeah.

118
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:50,200
So the Windows subsystem for Linux has received some new features in the Windows 10 October

119
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:56,520
2018 update, including one feature that I use in XFC all the time.

120
00:06:56,520 --> 00:07:01,720
I have right-click, open terminal here, and they've got it in Windows 10 now, open Linux

121
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:02,720
shell here.

122
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:03,720
In Explorer?

123
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:04,720
In Explorer?

124
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:05,720
Yeah.

125
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:06,720
Wow.

126
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:09,720
You can open a bash shell from Explorer now.

127
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:13,440
That's almost as big as a notepad now supporting Linux line endings.

128
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:16,080
Those two things right there are huge.

129
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,080
Yeah.

130
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:22,040
Back in the day, though, back in the day, when I was working on Linux and Windows systems

131
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:26,600
a lot, like Linux Samba servers that Windows systems were connecting to, and I tried to

132
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:31,200
open up a config file or a bash script in Notepad, it was a mess.

133
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,200
Yeah.

134
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:36,060
And then you go into Word wrap, and that's not working, and why isn't it?

135
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:38,920
So now that's going to be fixed, which is good, I suppose.

136
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:41,020
I mean, is all this good?

137
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:43,040
That's the question that I always ask here.

138
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:45,920
And a copy-paste support as well, which has got a lot better.

139
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:46,920
Right.

140
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:50,360
And then number two, even kind of outside of the Linux subsystem but kind of still in

141
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:53,800
the same category, is support for Chocolaty.

142
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:58,920
Now Chocolaty is sort of like brew for Mac OS or app for Debian.

143
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:04,100
And this was something I discovered when I did a Windows 10, live in Windows 10 week

144
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:09,200
challenge for Coda Radio like almost a year ago, and I just couldn't get anywhere without

145
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,200
a package manager.

146
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:13,440
I have really come to use a package manager as part of my workflow.

147
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:16,360
I want something, it's just an apt away.

148
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:21,280
And this is what Chocolaty brings to Windows 10, and Microsoft has teamed up with that

149
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:26,380
community and the box starter config tool to make it easier to automate those setups

150
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:30,700
and deployments of Windows machines that already have Chocolaty installed and ready to go up

151
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:32,160
to date.

152
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:35,360
That's pretty great because then if you're creating a standardized image for your IT

153
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:38,000
department, you can now just include Chocolaty as part of that.

154
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,560
Well, you say it's great, and I ask the question again, is this all good?

155
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:45,660
The better the subsystem gets, the less reason there is to use proper Linux.

156
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:50,760
It's still not proper Linux though, and the closer and closer they get, the more tantalizing

157
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:55,200
it is to just to get proper Linux because you get in that uncanny valley that's more

158
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,000
frustrating than anything else.

159
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:01,520
When it's the command prompt on Windows and you have tools like ping and DIR, it's like,

160
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:04,540
oh, it's kind of like bash, this is adorable.

161
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:08,800
But when you get really close but you still can't have it all, I think that's going to

162
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:13,840
encourage more people to try out desktop Linux than anything that Microsoft has done previously.

163
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:21,160
I look back at this whole history now of Windows subsystem and the open sourcing of.NET Core

164
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:26,840
and all of that that has sort of accumulated to what we have today, and that seems to be

165
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:29,320
that Linux is doing better than ever.

166
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:31,860
All this has done is just drove more Linux users.

167
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:36,760
It seems to have slowed Linux down in the least, and I imagine it'll just continue.

168
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:38,960
It's such a glass half full, man, aren't you?

169
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:43,560
No doubt you'll see the same thing here then, that Samsung have clarified what's going on

170
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:45,640
with this Linux on decks situation.

171
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:51,840
Oh, I wish I could be, but I watched the video and they really kind of disappoint in this

172
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:52,840
video.

173
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:54,680
So the idea is so beautiful.

174
00:09:54,680 --> 00:10:01,360
It goes back to convergence that we all dreamed of when Canonical set off on that great journey

175
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:02,840
one year.

176
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:06,740
And now fast forward to 2018 and the idea is back and this time it's being proposed

177
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:09,720
by Samsung, but this time it's a little different.

178
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:14,000
It's using a desktop environment that you can get installed on the Samsung phone that

179
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,940
you can then launch the Linux environment from, which runs out of a container and is

180
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:21,320
based on Ubuntu 16.04 as of right now.

181
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:25,120
Well, Ubuntu 16.04 is a solid Linux distro, isn't it?

182
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,120
Yep.

183
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:29,040
I mean, 18.04 would be nice and apparently they're working on that, but for now I'd take

184
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,460
16.04, no problem.

185
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:34,400
And if this is possible, it may be possible for the community to create their own install

186
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:38,080
of 18.04 or even another distribution of Linux altogether.

187
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:40,600
That's not what concerns me.

188
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:45,320
What concerns me, and bear in mind it is early days, but what concerns me is the video they

189
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:50,900
released is clearly doctored to make the system seem more performant.

190
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:55,320
And the mistake that they made was they have the seconds indicator on in their desktop

191
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:58,840
clock and so you can just see where they sped the video up because the counter just starts

192
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:04,600
flying and it's done when applications are loading or large complex things are loading

193
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:09,440
and they speed up the time of the video to make it seem like the device is faster.

194
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:14,440
And the concern I have is even with the video sped up, it seems barely fast enough.

195
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:18,840
What people speeding up videos to try and make a point, that wouldn't happen this week,

196
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:19,840
would it?

197
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:20,840
No, no.

198
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:27,360
But I spoke to some people at Canonical who actually saw this in the flesh this week and

199
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:30,400
they said it was actually really fast and they were really impressed with it.

200
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:35,160
So I don't know if that video is maybe an earlier build of it or something because apparently

201
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:36,600
this is really, really good.

202
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:40,360
I've not seen it firsthand, but I trust the people who've told me this.

203
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:45,100
Well, remember we were talking about this since the initial demo in 2017.

204
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:47,360
So this is something they must have been working on for a while.

205
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:53,200
So you would hope that if they've been sitting on it, it has been to refine it and it absolutely

206
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:57,080
seems like one of those you'd have to see it to really judge it and everybody has a

207
00:11:57,080 --> 00:12:00,880
different threshold for what speed means to them.

208
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:06,880
However, if this thing could get you a basic desktop web browser that supported like extensions

209
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:11,440
and all of the things that I come to expect from say a full Chrome or a full Firefox,

210
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:16,600
and I could easily get to a terminal and a few of my other favorite Linux apps, it doesn't

211
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:21,600
have to be a speed demon because those are SOS type situations where I'm plugging my

212
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:26,560
phone in and I am saving the situation by having access via my phone.

213
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:29,840
They pitch it as a tool for developers to create applications.

214
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:33,120
I can't help but see it as a sysadmin's lifeboat.

215
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:37,080
Like this is where you bring your emergency tool set, you can plug this thing in and get

216
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:39,980
access and bring your infrastructure back up online.

217
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:44,600
And if it's slightly slower than your Core i7 laptop, that's okay.

218
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:49,080
What really impressed me though was the Galaxy Tab S4 because this is the Note 9 and the

219
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:50,080
Tab S4.

220
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:51,080
Right.

221
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:54,600
The Note 9 needs an external screen, but the Galaxy Tab S4 doesn't.

222
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:55,600
Good point.

223
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,360
And it's on the tablet screen itself.

224
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,720
So it becomes a standalone device at that point.

225
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:02,360
Now that is pretty cool.

226
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:07,240
I was really kind of thinking it more from the phone angle in the pocket.

227
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:10,080
But you know, that actually sounds pretty good since the screen's built in.

228
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,880
I hadn't really given that much thought.

229
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:14,300
I wonder how that will perform.

230
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:18,360
It's almost, almost makes me want to grab one just to try it, Joe.

231
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:21,720
You know, like when you see that kind of stuff, you're like, is this going to be a flop?

232
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:23,040
Is this really possible?

233
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:25,560
You don't know until you use it.

234
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:29,240
Maybe I'll get lucky and have an opportunity to put my hands on it because it is, it is

235
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:30,240
tempting.

236
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:35,120
We have wanted this for a very long time and it could be an iPad Pro killer for some people.

237
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,120
Yeah.

238
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:40,120
Well, I may or may not have been looking on eBay today, but no, too much I'm afraid.

239
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:41,120
Are they?

240
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,120
I'm spending 500 quid on it.

241
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:43,120
Plus.

242
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:44,120
Yeah.

243
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:45,120
That doesn't surprise me.

244
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,120
Yeah.

245
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:50,000
Well, you know, I'll keep an eye on it and if the opportunity comes up, I will get my

246
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
hands on it.

247
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,280
Maybe I can get a review unit one of these days too because I'd love to try it because

248
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:55,600
it could be great.

249
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:56,640
It really could be great.

250
00:13:56,640 --> 00:14:00,060
And then you also have the advantage of having an Android tablet if you'd like to have things

251
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:03,960
like Netflix and some of the other streaming apps or commercial applications that are easily

252
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:05,120
available via the Play Store.

253
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:08,120
So there's a nice balance there potentially.

254
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:13,200
What I'm really, really hoping is that some enterprising people will port this to other

255
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:16,160
Android devices and it won't just be these two Samsung ones.

256
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:22,360
I don't know how realistic that is, but again, I have a lot of faith in this hacking community,

257
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:24,520
especially the Android community.

258
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:30,360
Do you remember the very early stages of Canonical's phone effort was essentially getting Ubuntu

259
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:32,160
running on top of an Android layer?

260
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:34,240
Yeah, which I think they should have stuck with.

261
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:36,640
That's what I was just going to say that.

262
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:43,240
Imagine for a moment if a hardware neutral vendor had created a really fast layer that

263
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:47,720
ran on top of Android and maybe back then the technology wasn't there because you maybe

264
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:50,360
didn't have kernels new enough to support containers.

265
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:54,480
And now instead of running it in a virtual environment, which is much more overhead,

266
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:58,560
you can run it in a container, which is much more minimal and requires a lot less hardware,

267
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:01,080
which means it's going to work a lot better on a mobile device.

268
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:04,960
So maybe the tech just wasn't quite there yet, at least in widespread adoption.

269
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:05,960
But you're right, Joe.

270
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:09,760
What would make me probably 100 times more excited about this is if this was an open

271
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:13,880
source project we were talking about that was going to be available for the Pixel phones,

272
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:17,700
it was going to be available for the OnePlus phones, et cetera, et cetera.

273
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:21,960
It being limited to Samsung devices honestly makes it less compelling to me because Samsung

274
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:24,760
devices are not particularly compelling to me.

275
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:27,160
I just don't like the Samsung software.

276
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:29,420
I think BigSpeak can die in a fire.

277
00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:31,680
Those kinds of things make them non-compelling devices for me.

278
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:36,000
So even though they're doing this, I'm just not super inclined to pick one up.

279
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:41,560
The tablet might be the only kind of exception to that because that's kind of neat that it's

280
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:42,620
on the same screen.

281
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:46,200
But you know, I'm following, like if this was a project that was widely deployable on

282
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:48,640
general hardware, 100 times more exciting.

283
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:51,440
Well, that was kind of promised by MaruOS.

284
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:53,360
And I remember being very excited about that.

285
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:59,680
That was Debian with XFCE in a container running on top of Android on a couple of Nexus devices.

286
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:02,720
But I haven't heard anything for months about that.

287
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:06,440
And I looked into it and yeah, there's not been any new releases for months and months

288
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:12,360
and months on that one, which is a real shame because I thought that had real promise.

289
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:16,440
But having Samsung and their proprietary stranglehold on it, this was all open source.

290
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:22,360
So I really hope that MaruOS springs back into life soon, maybe inspired by this.

291
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:25,360
But until then, I suppose we'll have to rely on Samsung.

292
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:26,360
Yeah.

293
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:27,360
I guess I couldn't have said it better myself.

294
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:31,800
Well, how about something that's available to just about every Android user that's on

295
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:32,800
Linux?

296
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,300
And that's two pieces of software.

297
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:39,400
Let's start with KDE Connect, which has a brand new fancy version, both for the desktop,

298
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:40,840
but their Android app as well.

299
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:44,800
Yeah, the very best thing about using the Plasma desktop as far as I'm concerned is

300
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:45,800
KDE Connect.

301
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:51,320
I'd say it's like 10 things about the Plasma desktop, but this is in the top five for sure.

302
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:56,520
It really kind of bridges the gap and is a type of convergence that is just about enough

303
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:57,520
for me.

304
00:16:57,520 --> 00:17:02,200
And it allows me to manage the notifications from both devices, control playback, even

305
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:06,360
share the clipboard, which is one of the most functional capabilities that I find.

306
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:10,720
And in a pinch, I'll also use my phone as a remote mouse.

307
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:15,660
And maybe the best thing about KDE Connect is how simple it is to set up.

308
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:19,840
You install the app on your phone, you go to KDE Connect settings in the system settings,

309
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:24,360
you enter the pin code in, and they're talking over Wi-Fi over a secure channel.

310
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:25,860
It's pretty brilliant.

311
00:17:25,860 --> 00:17:31,580
And they're upping their game with this next release, and they are dropping support for

312
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:38,800
older versions, 4.0 and older of Android, to gain some functionality, to gain some security.

313
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:42,820
And it does mean sort of closing the door on about 400 users of the software.

314
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:47,400
But that's the kind of decision that projects like this need to make from time to time.

315
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:51,920
And they based it on data, and I think it's a fair one for the wider user base.

316
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:53,800
Yeah, it is a shame.

317
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:59,920
But in order to target Android 8 and above in the Play Store, they had to make this decision.

318
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:03,760
And I was kind of wrestling with it myself, whether it was a good idea.

319
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:05,800
And they could just go F-Droid only.

320
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:09,880
But realistically, if they want to get this into the hands of as many users as possible,

321
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:12,600
it has to be in the Play Store as well as F-Droid.

322
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:16,040
And therefore, they have to play by the Play Store rules.

323
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:22,800
And 400 people is not insignificant, but they have to just use the data, as you say, and

324
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:23,800
make the decision.

325
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:26,920
So it's a shame that they had to do it, but I think they did have to do it.

326
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:31,000
One of the new features is the run command now supports triggering commands using the

327
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:38,080
KDE Connect URL syntax, which is really useful for integration, say, with NFC tags around

328
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:39,080
your place.

329
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:43,960
So maybe in your office, you could have an area where your phone registers an NFC tag,

330
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:46,960
and then it triggers an action on your computer.

331
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:50,820
That could be some cool ways to automate things that don't require any cloud integration or

332
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:51,820
anything like that.

333
00:18:51,820 --> 00:18:54,900
Your two boxes on the same LAN, triggering action based on tags.

334
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:59,240
You could have, say, an NFC tag by your bed if your computer's in the room that you sleep

335
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:03,200
in, when you trigger that, it could put the monitors to sleep.

336
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:07,680
And there's a lot of ways you can actually kick off scripts in KDE using that URL structure.

337
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:12,080
So I would have to try around and build something, but it really has my mind churning on the

338
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:13,080
possibilities.

339
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:14,200
That's going to be a great feature.

340
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:19,040
Well, the biggest feature for me is you can now send files to Pantheon files.

341
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:22,080
I'm not really interested in that, but you can send them to Thunar.

342
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:23,080
Yes.

343
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:26,800
And you know, really, the GNOME users aren't left out.

344
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:29,640
There is also GS Connect, which saw a new release.

345
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:34,480
Yeah, and this is using the KDE Connect app on the phone, but it's using a GTK front end

346
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:38,240
on the computer, so it's properly integrated with GNOME.

347
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:42,500
And with this new release, they rewrote it to better conform to GNOME's design guidelines.

348
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:48,120
So it looks nice, it works good in high DPI, and supports accessibility features now too.

349
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:51,420
But isn't this the beauty of open source that you can have one app on the phone that works

350
00:19:51,420 --> 00:19:52,420
for both of them?

351
00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:54,720
You know, you wouldn't get that with Samsung, would you?

352
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:56,680
Yeah, really back to the Samsung point, right?

353
00:19:56,680 --> 00:20:01,660
This is why this is a way more exciting project, is it's universally available to all of us,

354
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:06,160
and there's even availability for people that don't use the KDE desktop.

355
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:08,780
Or you Fedora users, you just got a treat in this new release.

356
00:20:08,780 --> 00:20:13,120
There's improvements to package kit support, especially for Fedora users, which was a fix

357
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:16,180
that was submitted by a single contributor to the project.

358
00:20:16,180 --> 00:20:17,840
And now it's rolled up in here.

359
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:22,760
And that kind of stuff is, to me, a lot more exciting than, say, the Samsung DeX.

360
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:27,560
I do kind of want to see both work, though, so there's room for both.

361
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:30,360
And I may end up being a user of both one day.

362
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:35,080
But it's nice to see both GS Connect and KDE Connect getting these updates.

363
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:38,840
One of the cooler projects out there for desktop integration, at least for the phones that

364
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:39,840
we have today.

365
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:42,720
But what about the phones that we're going to have tomorrow, or will that be the next

366
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:43,720
day?

367
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:44,720
Or will it be next week or next year?

368
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:47,840
Who knows with the Librem 5, eh?

369
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:49,480
Yes, we have an update.

370
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:53,200
And you know they're trying to set a tone in the post when they start by running down

371
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:56,240
the recent hurricanes and typhoons that have delayed production?

372
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:59,680
So they're kind of setting the table here.

373
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:02,640
And it looks like things are slightly behind schedule.

374
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:05,680
Now, they have verified a lot of the individual hardware components.

375
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:08,000
There's still some that are missing.

376
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:14,760
But as we record right now, Pureism CTO Nicole Ferber writes that she's a little reluctant

377
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:19,720
to commit exactly on timetables.

378
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:24,400
What she does know at this point is the PCB fabrication here in the USA will take 11 business

379
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:25,400
days.

380
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:28,640
They have to make 300 of those boards, which are complex.

381
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:34,400
And there's 160 different parts and more than 500 components in total per board.

382
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:38,080
And that just means it takes some time, even with the amazing machines they have to put

383
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:39,860
them all together.

384
00:21:39,860 --> 00:21:43,180
And that's the minimum driver of the timetable.

385
00:21:43,180 --> 00:21:44,180
Then you have the testing.

386
00:21:44,180 --> 00:21:47,680
They'll probably take another week or so until they can give the green light for PCB fabrication

387
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:52,360
to fully begin and complete production, about two weeks for them to then be built, and another

388
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:57,340
week for production, then assembly, and then testing, and then shipping.

389
00:21:57,340 --> 00:21:59,200
And that puts it right into the holidays.

390
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:01,380
So there's a lot of moving parts.

391
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:06,080
But their best, best, bestest effort is to try to get all of the backers, their new toys,

392
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:07,600
before the end of the year.

393
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:09,440
Yeah, this is just the development kits, though.

394
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:13,280
This isn't the final thing, which they'd originally promised first quarter.

395
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:15,840
I think they'd even said January of 2019.

396
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:17,680
So it has slipped massively.

397
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:20,160
They'd originally planned to ship these development kits in the summer.

398
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:24,040
So they're, what, basically five, six months behind.

399
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:27,720
And this got me thinking, you've done contracting before.

400
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:29,520
I've done contracting before.

401
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:34,400
And one trick that I learned very early on was to always tell the client that it was

402
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:37,320
going to take about twice as long as you thought it was going to take.

403
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:43,240
And then if it takes a little bit longer than you thought, then they're happy with it.

404
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:47,160
And maybe they should have been a bit more pessimistic here, because I can't help but

405
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:51,520
feel that they went for the very best case scenario with every stage.

406
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:54,200
And that was January 2019.

407
00:22:54,200 --> 00:23:00,120
Whereas in reality, the way this has slipped, it's probably going to be like Q4 2019.

408
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:01,120
I think it's safe to say.

409
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:06,080
And if they'd said end of 2019, and then somehow managed to do it in like spring, everyone

410
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:08,140
would have been over the moon with it.

411
00:23:08,140 --> 00:23:12,580
This is the idealism that we've all been kind of sniffing from the beginning, saying, boy,

412
00:23:12,580 --> 00:23:16,380
that seems a little ambitious, boy, that seems a little, that right there seems like it's

413
00:23:16,380 --> 00:23:17,520
really pushing it.

414
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:21,520
That's been the commentary about this entire thing since the very beginning.

415
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:25,500
And that is the dichotomy of purism at its core.

416
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:31,480
In order to be audacious enough to think that you could bend the PC industry into opening

417
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:37,280
up the hardware around the Intel chip, or that you could take on Android and iOS and

418
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:42,600
make a dent in the market and sell phones with physical switches to turn off hardware

419
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:46,840
components, and even think that there's consumers that could grok that advantage, is audacious

420
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:48,160
in its thinking.

421
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:51,100
It's very optimistic in its thinking.

422
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:56,240
And you almost have to have people willing to think that way for anybody to ever try

423
00:23:56,240 --> 00:24:00,100
something new, because nothing would ever change otherwise.

424
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:05,360
But then at the same time, those people are not very good at fully actuating all of the

425
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:06,840
potential negatives.

426
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:10,700
They need pessimists on their team that they listen to that sit there and go, well, that's

427
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:11,700
not a good idea.

428
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:12,700
That won't work.

429
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:15,160
And then they have to they have to have like an engaging back and forth.

430
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:18,800
And if the whole company is being run by a top down approach where it's idealism at the

431
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:22,460
top down, these are sort of the things that end up happening.

432
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:27,680
And so backers are just sort of left trying to guess these dynamics when they back it.

433
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:30,240
And then you sit back and just watch how the project unfolds.

434
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:33,640
Yeah, I was gonna say they could hire me if they wanted a bit of pessimism, but I'm a

435
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:34,640
bit busy these days.

436
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:38,520
Well, you know, Joe, you do give them this for free.

437
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:40,400
So there's always that.

438
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:44,600
This is consulting time with Joe and Peerism.

439
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:48,760
They have some subsystems left to validate as well, I should just point out like Bluetooth

440
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:54,880
camera, the wireless controller, the touch controller, the USB roll switching.

441
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:59,880
There's some major things they have validated the microphone, the Ethernet, the audio codec,

442
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:05,280
the charge controller, general USB compatibility, but there's still some fundamentals that they're

443
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:06,680
working with.

444
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:10,720
And they still have to forward port drivers because remember, they're working with hardware

445
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:13,760
that doesn't necessarily have the drivers that they're using in the current kernel that

446
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:14,760
they're using.

447
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:19,240
So there's a lot at play here besides just the manufacturing of the dev kits.

448
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:21,320
Yeah, there's so many moving parts here.

449
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:25,720
And who knew that making a phone, especially a phone that was trying to be as free as it

450
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:28,560
possibly could be, would be difficult.

451
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:33,160
Well, I think we told them that, didn't we, a year ago when we first heard about this.

452
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:35,760
It's like they're not attending our consulting meetings, Joe.

453
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:36,760
Yeah.

454
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:38,960
Why are we giving them all this advice for free?

455
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:43,000
All right, well, let's end on a bit of bad news.

456
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:47,560
And a sort of retrospective really, and that is that Nexus devices are finally dead.

457
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:54,840
The 5X and the 6P have received what's pretty much going to be their last OTA and their

458
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:56,040
last security update.

459
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:57,040
And so that's it.

460
00:25:57,040 --> 00:26:00,040
That's kind of the end of the Nexus devices as we know it.

461
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:04,560
Obviously they'll live on with custom ROMs, but official ROMs wise, that's it.

462
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:06,920
It's Pixel or nothing now.

463
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:13,520
Yeah, I am both a bit sad to see it go because I liked the idea of the Nexus line create

464
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:18,840
a Google reference device that was in a price range that mortals could afford, that developers

465
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:21,040
could buy to try building apps.

466
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:23,480
And it did serve that purpose for a while.

467
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:28,800
However, I've recently become the owner of a Pixel 3, the smaller one, and quote unquote

468
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:29,800
smaller.

469
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:36,720
And it's a fine phone with an incredible camera and a great size, good screen, nice performance.

470
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:41,740
It's really by far the best Android device I've ever used.

471
00:26:41,740 --> 00:26:46,760
And if that's the trade-off they had to take to get Android to that level, maybe it's worth

472
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:49,000
it for most consumers.

473
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,660
I miss my Nexus 6P.

474
00:26:50,660 --> 00:26:53,000
That's one of the reasons I got the Pixel 3 is because I knew this was coming.

475
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:57,240
I rode that 6P all the way to the end and it served me well.

476
00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:01,480
But the Pixel 3 is in every measurable way a better phone.

477
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:04,240
Well, that's because it's targeted at consumers, isn't it?

478
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:11,520
Whereas the Nexus devices were targeted at developers and enthusiasts and power users.

479
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:16,740
Whereas the idea, at least with the Pixel, is that it's going to be sold to the masses.

480
00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:20,840
Whether or not they're delivering on the numbers that they hoped they would, I don't know.

481
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:24,800
With three generations in now, Google's got a lot of money to burn on this.

482
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:28,480
So we'll see if this actually pans out long term.

483
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:32,480
Yeah, I doubt it's selling in big numbers, although I think it's selling through Verizon

484
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:33,640
now.

485
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:34,960
I kind of see a different take.

486
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:36,920
I mean, we don't have to make this about the Pixel.

487
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:41,400
But just a quick aside, I see it more as an Android phone for iPhone potential users because

488
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:42,920
it's sort of all neat and tidy.

489
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:44,000
It's taken care of.

490
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,120
It feels like an ecosystem.

491
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:48,240
There's Pixel buds and there's Pixel chargers.

492
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:51,720
But what the Pixel is really good at is just bringing in all the Google services.

493
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:56,000
So if you're in Google apps for your work, if you've got Google email and you've got

494
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:01,760
Google Calendar and Contacts and things like that, the Pixel is really a showcase for Google

495
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:02,760
services.

496
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:05,480
And that's what its biggest strength is.

497
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:10,600
And the Nexus line didn't quite get there, didn't quite close the gap.

498
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:14,840
Going forward, this just means that your Nexus device will keep working as it is, but you

499
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:20,360
won't be getting any kind of security updates or critical vulnerabilities of any kind fixed

500
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:22,160
from Google directly.

501
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:27,960
However, there are often community ROMs out there that will extend the life of your phone

502
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:30,200
for a couple of more years at least.

503
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:33,560
So this is a great opportunity now that Google is no longer supporting you.

504
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:40,560
If you still think your Nexus 5X or 6P is a viable device, this is a great time.

505
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:43,680
This is the perfect time to jump into the ROM community.

506
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:47,840
Get slow and learn and get more life out of your phone, just like Joe's getting more life

507
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:49,520
out of those old Macs.

508
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:50,520
Yeah.

509
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:51,520
Yeah.

510
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:56,480
My advice to you with your 6P is download.lineage.org slash angler.

511
00:28:56,480 --> 00:29:03,020
And you can have a ROM today as people listening to this brand new nightly that will be totally

512
00:29:03,020 --> 00:29:05,560
up to date with security updates and everything.

513
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:06,640
Nice.

514
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:12,440
And so it'll be, as you say, a year or two probably before it gets abandoned by lineage.

515
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:15,720
And by that point, the battery will be totally shot and you'll probably dropped it and stuff.

516
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:22,240
But I mean, even my Nexus 4 is getting security updates even now and that phone is years and

517
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:23,240
years old.

518
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:25,560
So it might even be more than a couple of years from now.

519
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:26,560
Yeah.

520
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:27,560
This is, like I said, it's the perfect time.

521
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:28,560
Like, what do I have to lose?

522
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:29,720
I've got the Pixel phone.

523
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:33,000
So if I break the phone, I'm fine.

524
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,680
And likely it'll go just fine.

525
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:36,720
So it's just a great opportunity.

526
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:37,720
So I will.

527
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:38,720
I will do that.

528
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:42,120
Because I also know that if I get stuck, I'm just going to telegram you, Joe, it's not

529
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:43,120
working.

530
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:44,120
All right.

531
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:48,160
Well, there's many, many more things developing every single week.

532
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:49,300
There's something going on.

533
00:29:49,300 --> 00:29:53,080
There's a lot out there and you can get a digest of it right here.

534
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:54,080
Every single week.
