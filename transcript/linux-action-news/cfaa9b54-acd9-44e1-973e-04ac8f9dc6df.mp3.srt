00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,920
Hello and welcome to Linux Action News, episode 181, recorded on March 21st, 2021.

2
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:09,920
I'm Chris.

3
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:10,920
And I'm Wes.

4
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:11,920
Hello, Wes.

5
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:12,920
Let's do the news.

6
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:15,440
We start this week with Ubuntu Touch.

7
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:21,840
And while we don't often cover individual releases, OTA-16 is noteworthy for several

8
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:22,840
reasons.

9
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:23,840
Get this, Wes.

10
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:27,940
Nearly four years ago, almost exactly, just a couple of weeks from now, that canonical

11
00:00:27,940 --> 00:00:31,100
dropped Ubuntu Touch and just it was essentially a code drop.

12
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:33,680
And then that became an independent project.

13
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:36,440
I can't believe it's been four years already.

14
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:41,080
But also noteworthy right now is there's some new fresh hardware landing in the hands of

15
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:48,240
Ubuntu Touch users, including the new Volaphone, which is now actually shipping and can absolutely

16
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:49,240
run Ubuntu Touch.

17
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:54,400
Well, with all this excitement, Dalton Durst joined us to discuss the release.

18
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:57,960
And it sounds like new hardware or not, there's something for everyone.

19
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:02,240
If you're a longtime user of Ubuntu Touch, this is the release where you say, huh, I

20
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:06,400
didn't notice a lot, but for some reason this feels better.

21
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:12,200
So with the news of this new release itself, the new hardware and a lot more, we asked

22
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:17,400
why is the project calling this their second biggest release yet?

23
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:22,820
This is the second largest release ever because a fourth, a quarter of all of the packages

24
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:26,000
that make up Ubuntu Touch changed.

25
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,060
But at the same time, you're going to download this release, you're an Ubuntu Touch user,

26
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:36,020
you download like 83 megabytes of changes, which for a 350 megabyte install is a kind

27
00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:37,880
of big.

28
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:41,760
And you say, well, what the heck changed here?

29
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:43,580
And you would think that'd be a bad thing.

30
00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:47,600
But really that, we'd feel successful if you said that.

31
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:56,720
Because this is the release where we upgraded from Qt 5.9 to Qt 5.12, which required changing,

32
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:58,480
it feels like everything.

33
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:01,120
I bet.

34
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:04,980
I think if I recall, it also kind of gets you in line for eventually the transition

35
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:09,120
from 16.04 base to an Ubuntu 20.04 base.

36
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:10,120
Exactly.

37
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:13,920
So that's where we're looking right now is we got to get off 16.04.

38
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:20,200
Of course, elephant in the room is that Ubuntu 16.04 is almost out of mainstream support

39
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:22,200
next month.

40
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:26,760
We're going to keep shipping a few images, a few updates using 16.04.

41
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:32,540
But our focus is on moving all of our software to 20.04 so that we can successfully release

42
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:37,660
Ubuntu Touch and hopefully no one notices the difference.

43
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:41,880
That's the funny thing you and I were talking about before we sat down to record is it's

44
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:47,480
kind of a success if you migrate from 16.04 to 20.04 and the end user can't really tell.

45
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:54,600
But with iOS or Android, it's a flagship marketing event with an entirely new UI sometimes dropped

46
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:55,600
in.

47
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:57,240
It's a much different beast.

48
00:02:57,240 --> 00:03:03,600
Yeah, it's an interesting difference between how you can develop an open source versus

49
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:06,280
developing for marketing sometimes.

50
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:12,280
You say that you're an agile shop and you can make changes iteratively, but that just

51
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:14,760
doesn't happen sometimes.

52
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:20,240
I think I'd rather get the innovation as the developers complete it rather than waiting

53
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:23,880
for a keynote up on a stage on some arbitrary date.

54
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:27,320
But there's a couple of other new things I've noticed that have landed in here.

55
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:32,200
The Morph browser is the default browser and it received a bunch of great upgrades this

56
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:33,200
cycle.

57
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:37,240
It made changes to the way the downloads work.

58
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:42,740
So now when you download a file, you get a recent downloads page that shows you what's

59
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:47,960
going on, what's about to finish, what has finished, more in line with other browsers

60
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:52,760
and certainly, well, not quite with other mobile browsers, but so it's unique to us

61
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:53,760
there.

62
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:54,760
Yeah, that's pretty nice.

63
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:55,760
That is really great.

64
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:56,760
All right.

65
00:03:56,760 --> 00:04:02,080
So then there was another thing you were talking about and that was getting new applications

66
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:04,280
into Ubuntu Touch.

67
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:07,440
That has been made a little bit easier this cycle.

68
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:08,440
Yeah.

69
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:13,800
So Clickable has been getting iterative improvements, well, basically it feels like since forever.

70
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:20,400
Clickable is our all in one, one stop shop tool for developing Ubuntu Touch apps.

71
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:25,540
So you can create new applications with it, build your applications and even deploy them

72
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:28,480
to the store all using Clickable.

73
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:34,280
And in recent updates, we got a new feature called Clickable IDE, which allows you to

74
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:42,680
run, well, basically random graphical applications such as a full IDE for developing Ubuntu Touch

75
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:44,520
applications like Qt Creator.

76
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:45,520
So how do I do that?

77
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:51,160
Yeah, you can go to clickable-ut.dev to get the information on how to get started using

78
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,160
Clickable.

79
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,160
Super easy to install.

80
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:56,240
We also got some new devices in recent times.

81
00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:00,520
Wes and I have had our eye on the Pixel 3a and rumor has it you have some hands on experience

82
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:01,520
with that one.

83
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:06,960
Yeah, I got a Pixel 3a XL and secret, secret, you can just tell the installer, oh yeah,

84
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:07,960
don't worry.

85
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:09,320
This is actually a 3a XL.

86
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:15,480
We're working on that, but for now you can just install the 3a image on the XL and things

87
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:17,620
are a little big, but it works.

88
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:25,920
But it is a fast device even compared to everything else that we have, which is very interesting

89
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:26,920
and fun to use.

90
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:27,920
Hi, Alfred.

91
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:28,920
I know you're listening.

92
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:31,500
Thanks for making it.

93
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:35,680
So that's a great one that I think a lot of people have and might be interested in learning

94
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:40,920
about, but you can also go to devices.ubuntu-touch.io to see if your device is supported because

95
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:42,800
we've got a lot of them out there right now.

96
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,800
Yeah, the 3a seems like a great one to try on.

97
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,760
I also saw the Volaphone.

98
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:50,480
Yes, the Volaphone has landed in people's hands.

99
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:58,800
It is a device that some SKUs have shipped with Ubuntu Touch pre-installed, which like

100
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:03,760
the PinePhone before, it is just a really exciting experience and a little nerve-wracking.

101
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:05,920
Oh boy, is the image going to work?

102
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:08,580
Is everything situated?

103
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:12,300
It feels so good when people start getting them in their hands and they say, man, this

104
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:13,300
is great.

105
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:14,720
Hey, I've got some feedback for you.

106
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:18,340
It's just, it's a great experience every time.

107
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:21,940
And then last but not least, tell me a little bit about what happens now.

108
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:27,280
Work begins on OTA-17, which starts, I would imagine, more work continuing the transition

109
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:28,280
to 2004?

110
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:29,280
Yes.

111
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:36,720
So we're working on bringing things together between, we have a few different branches

112
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:39,840
kind of of Ubuntu Touch development right now.

113
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:45,120
The standard Android 9 and mainline for different types of devices.

114
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:50,800
So trying to bring all of those back together so that they all go on to Ubuntu 2004 in one

115
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:55,800
big group and we don't need to deal with all this different branching stuff.

116
00:06:55,800 --> 00:07:03,120
But we've also got people working to improve our infrastructure and how we do releases

117
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:07,280
so that we can make 2004 as smooth as possible.

118
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:09,880
Thanks to Dalton for getting us up to date.

119
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:17,160
That URL to check if your device is compatible is devices.ubuntu-touch.io.

120
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:20,520
There's more details in their recent Ubuntu Touch Q&A as well.

121
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:24,600
Of course, we'll have that linked in the show notes.

122
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:26,120
Linux.ting.com.

123
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:30,920
This is how I do mobile and it's never been a better time to try out Ting.

124
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:35,560
And if you're a budget minded individual, check out Ting's set five plan.

125
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:40,240
For just $25 a month, you get unlimited talk and text.

126
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:44,920
You get five gigabytes of LTE or 5G data or all the data can be used as a hotspot.

127
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:50,640
You get nationwide LTE coverage and 5G where it's available for no contract at $25.

128
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:54,240
Really to make that work, all you have to do is sync your music and your podcast before

129
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:59,240
you hit the road and you can pretty much make that work and have wireless for $25 a month.

130
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:02,800
But if you need two gigs or you need a lot more than that, there's a perfect Ting plan

131
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:03,800
for you.

132
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:08,400
Every plan gets access to Ting's award winning customer service, the best in the business

133
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:11,160
and their nationwide access to networks.

134
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:15,140
I personally have been relying more on the Verizon network as time goes on, but I've

135
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:19,940
been a Ting customer forever, so I can tell you there is real benefit in multi network

136
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:23,860
coverage with just one company to interface and manage it all.

137
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:27,640
But just go to linux.ting.com to check your current phone because with all those different

138
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:30,840
networks, your phone is likely going to work.

139
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:35,400
And if you go to linux.ting.com, you get $25 in credit and it's simple.

140
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:36,400
The process is easy.

141
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:40,400
They have a really easy quick UI to check your phone and when everything checks out,

142
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:45,160
they just send you a SIM card, you pop that in your existing phone and you're cutting

143
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:47,200
your phone bill in half or more, right?

144
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:50,200
It's never been easier either with Ting's new plans.

145
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,680
They have some great prices now.

146
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:53,600
It's the next generation of Ting mobile.

147
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:54,880
It's here right now.

148
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:59,000
Go see how much you could save and get $25 off at linux.ting.com.

149
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,920
It's never been a better time to try Ting mobile.

150
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:06,480
Bring your phone, get $25 off and support the show.

151
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:12,080
Choose smarter, choose Ting mobile, linux.ting.com.

152
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:16,900
GNOME 40 is right around the corner with the release candidate shipping last week and the

153
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:21,020
official GNOME 40 debut on track for this week.

154
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:26,160
And as you might expect with a major release, there's going to be a few bumps.

155
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:31,000
To try to smooth things out though, Sri Ramakrishna has authored a blog post preparing extension

156
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,780
developers for porting their code to GNOME 40.

157
00:09:34,780 --> 00:09:39,160
Extension developers, there's a bit of PSA also in here for regular GNOME end users.

158
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:40,580
We'll get to all of that.

159
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:44,240
There's just been significant changes in GNOME Shell and specifically in the way that the

160
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:46,380
overview function works.

161
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:50,680
And so the team wanted people to understand there are some changes that are likely going

162
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:55,680
to, well, there are some changes mandatory to make extensions work in GNOME 40.

163
00:09:55,680 --> 00:10:00,960
To help with those updates, community member JustPerfection has created a porting guide

164
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:05,320
that you can use to learn how to modify your extension to work with the GNOME 40 Shell

165
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:06,840
release.

166
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:10,840
Because of the amount of changes and the fact that some distros for now are just going to

167
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:17,100
stick with GNOME 3.38, the GNOME project has decided to enforce version checking again

168
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:18,100
with extensions.

169
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:19,620
This is something that they used to do.

170
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:24,440
It's been off for a while and GNOME 40 Shell will check to make sure that the extension

171
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:29,240
has implicitly said it is compatible with 40, which means the developers will have to

172
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:34,760
go in and update their extension to say, yes, I'm compatible even if no other changes are

173
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:35,760
required.

174
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:41,160
The end result means that as an end user right now or soon after GNOME 40 is released, when

175
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:45,880
you go to the GNOME extensions website, there's not a lot listed there, although just about

176
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:49,480
one or two get added every single day during the development cycle right now.

177
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:50,480
But there won't be a lot.

178
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:54,080
Some of your favorite extensions will not yet be updated because there is this implicit

179
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:58,520
requirement that they at least go in and say it's compatible with 40, if not fix something

180
00:10:58,520 --> 00:10:59,800
to make it work with 40.

181
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:04,040
So you're going to see limited extensions around GNOME 40's release.

182
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:08,960
But it's nice to see the project trying to communicate this and smooth those bumps out

183
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:13,520
and prepare the way for GNOME 40 extensions and sort of set the expectations for both

184
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:19,160
developers and for end users, which I think is a step up from the way things used to be

185
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:20,160
with extensions.

186
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:21,440
This seems like a nice improvement here.

187
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:25,440
I hope this is a trend that continues and we see a little more back and forth between

188
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:29,080
the extension development community and changes coming upstream from GNOME.

189
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:32,160
I mean, it's always a little unfortunate when there's breaking changes.

190
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:36,480
But in this world, in the desktop space, we kind of need that if we're going to advance.

191
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:39,920
And I don't think any of us are really happy with the status quo of extensions.

192
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:43,840
So maybe there'll be better integration with CI testing systems.

193
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:47,360
I think there's also some efforts around, you know, GNOME OS and boxes to make testing

194
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:51,040
these things easier so that there are more paths, people can get out ahead of this release

195
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:54,440
and hopefully make all of our favorite extensions actually work.

196
00:11:54,440 --> 00:12:00,280
It's positive to see the team actually considering ways to automate extension integration testing

197
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:04,200
and to give that information back to developers while at the same time.

198
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:06,560
So that's like a technical thing they're actually trying to solve, right?

199
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:07,560
Good to see that.

200
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:11,920
But while at the same time, they're also trying to create a community space for extension

201
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:16,320
developers to communicate directly with each other and share ideas.

202
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:20,900
And they've been laying the groundwork for that for about a year now, close to it.

203
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:25,600
And I think those things combined with this implicit attempt to smooth these transition

204
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:31,240
bumps out with a transition guide and a blog post that draws attention to it is a much

205
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:36,560
more aggressive strategy at making the extension experience better on GNOME Shell.

206
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:41,640
Without fundamentally re-architecting the way GNOME Shell does extensions, they're trying

207
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:46,060
to get a lot of the benefits of areas you can improve without having to address that

208
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:47,360
core problem.

209
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:50,080
And I actually think it's a pretty clever strategy.

210
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:54,360
Yeah, well, I don't know that that, unfortunately, the underpinnings will be able to change anytime

211
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:55,360
soon.

212
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:58,400
And I think there's always going to be a certain amount of decoupling that extensions have,

213
00:12:58,400 --> 00:12:59,400
right?

214
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:01,400
They are third party, they're independently developed, they're developed on their own

215
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:03,220
timelines and tracks.

216
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:07,440
But if you can make that tooling so that if you do have time, if it is maintained, if

217
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:11,360
you make it easy from the get go and acknowledge, yeah, we're breaking your stuff, but here's

218
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:12,360
how to keep up to date.

219
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:17,280
You know, I've seen it argued a lot that GNOME Shell should have a stable API that extensions

220
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:18,280
can use.

221
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:21,280
You know, Plasma has something similar to that.

222
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:24,440
But the counter argument that I've seen to that is, yeah, okay, maybe there's a place

223
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:25,600
for some of that.

224
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:31,220
But oftentimes, extensions are being developed more on the edges, on the new features of

225
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:36,580
GNOME that haven't really stabilized yet, that wouldn't have an API yet anyways.

226
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:41,220
That's often where extension developers are kind of pushing the edge and kind of monkeying

227
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:44,600
with stuff that you wouldn't typically consider stable yet.

228
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:49,840
And I think that was an interesting argument for there is a place to let extension developers

229
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:55,120
innovate where a very static, stable API would be beneficial, but perhaps somewhat limiting.

230
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:59,380
So it's not that it's not without merit, it's just that there is also benefits to the way

231
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:00,380
it works now.

232
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:03,480
And when you're making a stable API, you want it to work, right?

233
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:06,680
Because you're going to hopefully not break that again, it will be set in stone.

234
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:12,640
So I do hope that GNOME can get there or get to a similar place, but got to figure it out

235
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:13,640
first.

236
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:16,700
One of the other things the community is getting figured out right now is how the heck we're

237
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:23,840
going to use legacy X11 only applications in our bright Wayland only future.

238
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:26,420
And it seems there's an important update in that regard.

239
00:14:26,420 --> 00:14:31,520
This week marked the inaugural release of X Wayland 21.1.

240
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:35,560
X Wayland, of course, is an X server that runs inside Wayland and provides backwards

241
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:40,200
compatibility for those legacy X apps that just never got updates to use Wayland.

242
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:43,200
Yeah, there could be some classics that never will see any updates.

243
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:44,560
And we're going to want to keep those around.

244
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:48,760
But there's like a big elephant in the room here.

245
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:55,080
Xorg itself really isn't getting much love and no one's really stepping up for the next

246
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:57,520
version to get released.

247
00:14:57,520 --> 00:15:00,200
And it's now long overdue for an update.

248
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:05,900
So Red Hat engineers have devised a plan for standalone X Wayland releases that are separated

249
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:11,480
from the rest of the Xorg server code base to at least get the updated X11 client on

250
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:14,440
Wayland support out to end users.

251
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:18,380
This fix or I guess you could say solution is something that Fedora may actually ship

252
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:23,840
soon in version 34 and one that Ubuntu even has an eye on for future integration with

253
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:24,840
their distro.

254
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:30,720
This really seems like a sign of the times for X11 and perhaps its next and last chapter.

255
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:35,480
I don't know, but with no plans for another release and most of the work that is being

256
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:41,040
done happening on X Wayland anyway, at least a big chunk before long, I think we might

257
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:47,320
start thinking of this as the X Wayland project rather than Xorg.

258
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:48,920
Leno.com slash land.

259
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:53,600
Go there to get a $100 60 day credit towards a new account and of course support the show.

260
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,100
Yeah, $100.

261
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:56,360
You can really try out Leno.

262
00:15:56,360 --> 00:16:00,580
They make cloud computing simple, affordable and accessible.

263
00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:05,120
They are the largest independent cloud computing provider and they make it easy to get your

264
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:07,440
idea online fast.

265
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:12,280
No matter what skill level you are at or what technology stack you use, Leno can help your

266
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:14,580
ideas come to life on the web.

267
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:20,120
If you need a personal web server, a blog or a portfolio, maybe a game server or VPN,

268
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:21,640
Leno has you covered.

269
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:25,400
And if you need the scale for a business application or something that goes viral, they can handle

270
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:26,860
that as well.

271
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:31,160
They have systems that reliably serve millions of visitors all the time.

272
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:35,120
But unlike entry level hosting services that lock you into their platform, Leno gives you

273
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:40,380
full back end access to customize, control the server to fit your needs.

274
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:43,740
Leno has a lot of rigs to choose from and did you know that some of those rigs have

275
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:47,040
dedicated AMD epic processors?

276
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:52,440
Cloud Spectator did a recent survey of the different providers, AWS, Azure, Google Cloud,

277
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:55,760
Alibaba, Digital Ocean and of course Leno.

278
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:58,740
They looked at all of them and guess what?

279
00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:00,500
The paper they released shows it.

280
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:02,460
Leno is fast.

281
00:17:02,460 --> 00:17:07,560
Leno is super fast for database use, their super fast CPUs that are a notch above everybody

282
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:13,880
else's, their AMD systems really scream and additionally, which is just as important,

283
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:19,360
not only are they high performance, but Cloud Spectator's study shows they are consistently

284
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:20,840
high performers as well.

285
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:23,080
I think that matters a lot.

286
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:27,960
Leno has a lot to choose from, from $5 rigs to custom super machines, so that $100 credit

287
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:30,660
will get you far and let you really try it out.

288
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:33,760
Go see why they are our cloud provider.

289
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:36,600
Everything we've built for JB 3.0 is hosted on Leno.

290
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:40,960
Go see why, Leno.com slash LAN.

291
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:46,960
For years now, we've been watching and waiting as Google has gradually developed their Fuchsia

292
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:49,680
operating system from the ground up.

293
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:55,840
Now evidence has appeared pointing to Google's Fuchsia OS getting its first and second proper

294
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:56,920
release.

295
00:17:56,920 --> 00:18:02,520
Despite not running on Linux, Google has also recently unveiled the proposal for how Fuchsia

296
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:08,680
could still run apps written for Linux platforms, including Android applications, while still

297
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:11,000
maintaining security and safety.

298
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:15,360
We talked about that recently, but now what we're seeing is it looks like there's going

299
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:19,600
to be another way besides just having to go get all the source code and build it for yourself,

300
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:23,440
but actual real releases.

301
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:27,240
The only release that Fuchsia has had so far have been ones that have been released internally

302
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:32,120
to Google staff, but now it looks like those of us in the public could get our hands on

303
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:33,120
it.

304
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:38,960
At the end of January, a new branch was created in the Fuchsia project entitled releases slash

305
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:39,960
F1.

306
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:45,160
Over the past few months, a few dozen code changes have been selectively added to this

307
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:49,160
F1 branch, all of them coming from the main branch.

308
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:55,280
This is the same process that's happened before all the other previous Fuchsia internal releases.

309
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:56,880
So it seems like something's up.

310
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:02,640
Yeah, you're going to have F1 and then you'll have an F2 branch and then an F3 branch.

311
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:07,720
And these are the final getting ready to go releases that we're going to see hit the public.

312
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:12,780
I mean, I'm not particularly looking forward to loading Fuchsia up in the emulator and

313
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:18,440
giving it a go, but part of me is just kind of, I'm just so looking forward to finally

314
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:22,080
getting it out there so we can see what it is, see what it's capable of and get an idea

315
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:25,640
of where it fits in the ecosystem and just get answers to some of the questions we've

316
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:27,560
had about Fuchsia for a long time.

317
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:30,360
I think you're saying you want to know what Linux is up against.

318
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:31,880
That's exactly what I want to know.

319
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:34,540
Well here's what you can probably expect.

320
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:37,680
We know Google has a pattern of milestone releases.

321
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:41,240
They've already released F1 and are working on F2 right now.

322
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:46,560
There seems to be about six weeks or so between these releases and actually they're already

323
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:48,840
tagging some things for F3.

324
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:49,840
Hmm.

325
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:54,640
I'm no Googler, but I just, I feel like the sooner I know about this, the better.

326
00:19:54,640 --> 00:20:01,040
I'm hoping maybe we'll hear more about Google's intentions with Fuchsia at Google IO 2021.

327
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:02,040
Maybe.

328
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:04,680
I mean, that might actually be a long shot.

329
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:05,680
It may happen.

330
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:09,760
We'll see, but I know you and you probably just want to know if you can run it on your

331
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:15,680
Raspberry Pi and you might just be installing it with the Raspberry Pi Imager, which has

332
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:20,200
just had a new release with some nice additions for power users.

333
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:24,820
The biggest new feature is the release of a hidden advanced options panel.

334
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:29,920
Just press control shift X and you can change some things about the OS you're about to flash.

335
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:31,080
What can you change?

336
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:35,800
Well first off you can enable SSH right there out of the box, set up the default hostname,

337
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:40,600
configure Wi-Fi or some more fiddly bits like disabling overscan or setting the setting

338
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:41,600
the right time zone.

339
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:46,640
Oh, it's so good to see this because headless is such a common use case for a Raspberry

340
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:47,640
Pi.

341
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:50,200
And these are things right out of the gate that you need to set up and you're either

342
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:54,680
setting up a keyboard and a monitor temporarily to turn this stuff on, or you know how to

343
00:20:54,680 --> 00:21:00,160
change the file on the default image to enable SSH, but either way it's, it's cumbersome.

344
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:05,240
It's manual and it's just so cool to see it built into the Imager.

345
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:11,080
Also really happy to see that they have now integrated in MVME drives as a target device.

346
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:14,360
So that's, that's really handy because you and I have switched to a workflow where we

347
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:17,320
use those to boot these devices because it's much faster.

348
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:20,960
It's nice to see them add some features aimed at advanced users for a change.

349
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:27,240
I don't really use the Pi Imager much myself, but I'd love to see other Imagers like Etcher

350
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:28,920
get inspired by these features.

351
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:34,240
Well that sounds nice, but I think what we really need is a cross distro standard because

352
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:37,020
right now there's a bunch of OSs that have something similar.

353
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:42,120
You can drop config files or file name the right thing in a certain directory say, but

354
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:46,520
they all do it a little bit differently and most of them aren't nearly this discoverable

355
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:47,920
or easy to use.

356
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:49,760
You're right of course Wes.

357
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:52,480
Something every distro bought into would, would really work.

358
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:57,880
You know, sounds like a problem for SystemD to solve.

359
00:21:57,880 --> 00:22:01,480
Well maybe, maybe not, but you know there is a lot that happens every single week and

360
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:05,160
what we try to do here is capture the things that matter the most and distill it down for

361
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:08,040
you in a nice digestible package.

362
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:09,280
Delicious you might say.

363
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:13,400

And be sure you catch episode 396 of Linux Unplugged.

366
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:27,020
We get the inside story of how Linux made it into JPL and eventually onto the surface

367
00:22:27,020 --> 00:22:28,140
of Mars.

368
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:32,160
As for us here on Earth, we'll be back next Monday with our weekly take on the latest

369
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:34,400
Linux and open source news.

370
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:36,760
Thanks for joining us and we will see you next week.
