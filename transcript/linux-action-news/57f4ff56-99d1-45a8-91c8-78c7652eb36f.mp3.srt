00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,480
Hello and welcome to Linux Action News Episode 240 for May 11th, 2022.

2
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:09,480
I'm Chris.

3
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:10,480
And I'm Wes.

4
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:11,480
Hello, Wes.

5
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:13,000
Let's do the news.

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,720
This week we have a special edition of the show.

7
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:22,860
Sometimes a news event is just so extraordinary we have to focus the episode to just get you

8
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:26,280
the most valuable information possible.

9
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:30,440
Today's Linux Action News is one of those episodes.

10
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:37,100
As we publish, NVIDIA has just announced a new long-term effort to work upstream to release

11
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:42,680
an open source kernel driver and related code for their GPUs.

12
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:45,160
Let that sink in for a moment.

13
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:49,560
The historic nature of this announcement really cannot be overstated.

14
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:55,560
What we know at this time is that NVIDIA's plans start with a focus on CUDA and compute

15
00:00:55,560 --> 00:01:00,520
the goal for 3D display by the end of the year.

16
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:07,060
This work is not only the result of a significant change in thinking at NVIDIA, but also years

17
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:10,960
of interfacing with internal Red Hat staff.

18
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:16,840
Christian Schaller is the director for desktop, graphics, infotainment, and more at Red Hat.

19
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:22,980
He's been there for nearly 10 years and has been directly involved in the nouveau project.

20
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:27,560
He joined us earlier to discuss the details of NVIDIA's announcement from the Red Hat

21
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:28,560
perspective.

22
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:34,160
We started by asking him how long Red Hat has been involved behind the scenes to make

23
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:35,160
this happen.

24
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:41,400
Yeah, we've been probably talking with NVIDIA, I mean, we have had the bigger discussion

25
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:45,400
with NVIDIA around this for literally for years, pushing them towards this.

26
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:48,540
But I mean, in terms of this concrete effort that is now coming to fruition, I would say

27
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:52,280
that we've been working more intensively on it for at least three months.

28
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:56,600
Is the upside for Red Hat that there is a good amount of RHEL systems out there doing

29
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:58,160
compute with NVIDIA GPUs?

30
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:02,640
I mean, the upside for RHEL is, A, there is a lot of those systems out there, and this

31
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:06,360
announcement will make it easier for us to support that.

32
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:10,680
I mean, one sort of growing customer request, of course, is that they want to enable secure

33
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:12,560
boot on their systems.

34
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:16,320
And the fact that NVIDIA driver hasn't been signed up to this point has been a major point

35
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:19,760
of contention for enabling secure boot.

36
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:25,480
So it sort of means that we can get to a point where it is possible to have a signed driver

37
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:27,540
for NVIDIA.

38
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:33,360
The other thing that we feel is hugely valuable is that as part of this, right, we can have

39
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:39,160
more shared infrastructure between the open source stack and NVIDIA's binary stack.

40
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:42,360
Because when you've been using Nuvo for the last few years or tested it, you probably

41
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:47,840
realize that the performance you get out of Nuvo is not particularly impressive.

42
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:52,880
And the reason for that is that we have never been able to reclock the GPU to make use of

43
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:54,120
the power.

44
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:59,360
So one thing maybe your listeners are not aware of is that ever since NVIDIA started

45
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:03,440
signing their firmware, the only reason Nuvo has been able to support anything has because

46
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:09,840
NVIDIA has been releasing a special firmware for Nuvo to enable us to initialize the hardware.

47
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:15,160
The problem with this firmware was that it didn't have all the knobs and whistles because

48
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:18,040
NVIDIA was slowly working to redo things.

49
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:19,400
So we couldn't reclock with that.

50
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:22,360
So a big thing coming out of this announcement will be that, you know, regardless of the

51
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:25,600
details of how things look out, we will be able to have a shared firmware eventually

52
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:29,760
between the open source stack, including Nuvo, and the binary stack, which means that we

53
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,400
can do the reclocking.

54
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:35,200
It certainly means that we will have a situation on the NVIDIA side looking, you know, pretty

55
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:38,320
close to, for instance, what you can see on the AMD side where there is a closed source

56
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:39,580
AMD driver.

57
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:42,980
But for most people, the open source AMD driver is more than good enough.

58
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:44,640
And that's what I'm abusing.

59
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:49,240
So if I'm understanding you, there will still be a role for the Nuvo driver and for the

60
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:52,760
NVIDIA driver, even if the NVIDIA components are open source.

61
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:53,760
Exactly.

62
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:59,200
I mean, the thing that is sort of unclear is, well, or what we know for sure is that

63
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:03,300
whatever ends up being the future, it's not going to be today's Nuvo.

64
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:07,200
It's going to probably be that we work with NVIDIA to sort of create some sort of new

65
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:14,480
shared kernel driver that, you know, will be based on what they're open sourcing.

66
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:16,000
But it probably won't be exactly that.

67
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:21,920
And that will then go upstream into the kernel and for Turing hardware newer, because this

68
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:28,200
thing only affects Turing on newer, that will then be eventually the new open source kernel

69
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:30,880
graphics driver for NVIDIA GPUs.

70
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:34,760
That sounds like a lot of ongoing collaboration with NVIDIA.

71
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:35,760
Yeah.

72
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:41,040
I know you can't read minds, but could you help me try to wrap my head around why the

73
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,960
change of heart and direction here?

74
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:47,240
Was it just pressure about things like Secure Boot and look, our customers want this.

75
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:52,600
And so NVIDIA is trying to make a partner happy or is this some bigger land shift?

76
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,040
I think it's a bigger mind shift.

77
00:04:54,040 --> 00:05:00,200
I think they have sort of realized that, you know, sticking with their current model beyond

78
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:04,520
just, you know, the practical concerns about like, how do you do Secure Boot and so on,

79
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:07,200
generates a lot of extra work and effort for them to write.

80
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:11,040
I mean, and it creates sort of a constant source of conflict with the kernel community

81
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:15,780
around, you know, GPL only headers and all this kind of things.

82
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:18,840
So I think this is sort of been something they've been working on for quite a while

83
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:24,040
before they sort of publicly shared with us that they were working on it, because it will

84
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:29,720
make their life easier and our life easier.

85
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:34,320
And by basically, like, you know, not having to sort of fight with the Linux community

86
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:38,440
in some sense about this.

87
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:41,480
It still feels like there's a big shift there.

88
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:45,920
Do you know, have there been other vendors partnering with NVIDIA on this effort?

89
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:49,280
Is it just been primarily a Red Hat NVIDIA effort?

90
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:52,120
I would say it's primarily a Red Hat NVIDIA effort.

91
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,480
And the reason for that is pretty simple.

92
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:57,840
I mean, there is no other Linux company out there who has significant resources on the

93
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:58,840
graphics side.

94
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:06,180
I mean, of course, I assume the other distros will be packaging this stuff.

95
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:10,920
But in terms of actually contributing upstream, I mean, if you look at both the kernel graphics

96
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:14,160
subsystem and Mesa and so on, you will see that, you know, there's Red Hat engineers

97
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:17,960
involved and, of course, engineers from other companies, but not necessarily from other

98
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:20,000
Linux distributions.

99
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Right.

100
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Do we know license details?

101
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Like, is it MIT?

102
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Is it GPL, I guess?

103
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
It must be GPL.

104
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Yes, it will be.

105
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:31,080
I think they do licensing it, GPL, MIT, I think was.

106
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:32,080
OK.

107
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:33,080
Yeah.

108
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:34,560
So the bits that touch the kernel will be GPL.

109
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:35,560
Yeah.

110
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:36,560
All right.

111
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:37,560
That makes sense.

112
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:42,560
So, of course, an added benefit here for NVIDIA in the long term is that they will be able

113
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:49,480
to take advantage of all those GPL-only kernel APIs that so far has been off-limits to them.

114
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:50,480
Hmm.

115
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:52,800
I hadn't even really considered it from that angle.

116
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:56,480
This will make their engineers' life easier, too.

117
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:57,480
Yeah.

118
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:58,480
Yeah, exactly.

119
00:06:58,480 --> 00:06:59,480
Uh-huh.

120
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:00,480
That makes a lot of sense.

121
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:04,080
I mean, I'm still kind of putting the picture, like, this just seems like a real commitment

122
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:07,200
here, because if they're working with the Nuvoo driver, too, down the road, or they're

123
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:11,040
willing to work with Red Hat to shape that into something new, it sounds like they're

124
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:17,840
willing to commit almost an undefined amount of engineering time to this, just sort of

125
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:18,840
ongoing engineering time.

126
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:19,840
Yeah.

127
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:20,840
No, I mean, definitely.

128
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:25,320
I mean, this is going to be their primary way of supporting Linux going forward, right?

129
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:30,160
I mean, the binary driver will continue living on, I mean, especially because for pre-turing

130
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:33,640
chipsets, that's the only driver that will be available from NVIDIA.

131
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:35,320
Ah, okay.

132
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:37,720
So there are certain chipsets that the new stuff won't work with.

133
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:38,720
Yeah.

134
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:46,160
So, I mean, you need a GPU from 2018 or newer to take advantage of this.

135
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:50,120
So I mean, it's definitely a big effort, and they have, you know, they are committed,

136
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:54,160
and they've been working very closely with us for quite some time now, not just on this,

137
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:55,160
right?

138
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:59,320
We have almost weekly meetings with them, for instance, on making sure that NVIDIA and

139
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:02,100
Valiant support is top-notch.

140
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:03,800
Is this the fruit of that?

141
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:07,680
Well, I think that the reason why they reached out to us maybe beforehand is because we have

142
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:10,160
sort of established a strong relationship with them over the last few years.

143
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:14,600
I mean, I think it's sort of the initial effort that we started working closely on was, you

144
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:18,800
know, the GLVND effort when we put in place infrastructure to allow Mesa and the binary

145
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:19,800
driver to coexist.

146
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:20,800
Right.

147
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:24,080
I feel like that was sort of like the proving ground, and it sort of set the tone in some

148
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,080
sense.

149
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:28,160
And then we have been working together on, you know, discussing these things, discussing

150
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:35,680
how we can improve Nuvo, and then how we work around Nuvo with them, and of course, a lot

151
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:37,440
of discussion about compute, too, right?

152
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:38,440
How do we package?

153
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:39,920
Getting bigger and bigger, right.

154
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:40,920
Yeah.

155
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:41,920
Yeah.

156
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:46,800
So, Christian, maybe you can refresh my memory because it feels like it's been ancient history

157
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:47,800
now.

158
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:55,840
Was NVIDIA's initial reaction, would you characterize it as unhappy with the Nuvo driver attempt?

159
00:08:55,840 --> 00:09:00,760
I'm wondering, have we seen a complete arc from, we're skeptical of this thing all the

160
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:06,720
way to now we're contributing to it, or am I misremembering that a little bit?

161
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:12,120
I don't know that I can say that they were, you know, statedly skeptical.

162
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:16,880
I mean, I think maybe, and this is purely from, call it a subjective perspective, this

163
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:20,840
was not what NVIDIA said, but I think maybe they at times were a little bit concerned

164
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:24,920
that Nuvo made their business model a bit harder.

165
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:31,440
I mean, you know, they often offered their GPUs in different market segments, and historically

166
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:35,920
they even shut off certain features through the driver.

167
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:40,960
So I think that probably fueled some skepticism, but over the years they have sort of moved

168
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:44,620
away from limiting things through the driver.

169
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:49,640
So I don't think that's a current concern for them, but of course, it definitely was

170
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:52,000
something that maybe colored things in the early years.

171
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Yeah.

172
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,360
You know, their approach and things change.

173
00:09:55,360 --> 00:10:00,200
So can you describe from your understanding how this is going to roll out from like say

174
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:04,680
a Fedora user's perspective, just sort of a kind of basics of how they're going to see

175
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:05,680
this rollout?

176
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:06,680
Yeah.

177
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:10,840
So what you will probably see happen is that, I mean, I expect relatively quickly, you know,

178
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:16,840
after day's release today, they will, we will have it packaged in Fedora.

179
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:21,560
And of course, if you're using Fedora to run CUDA based stuff, then you can of course start

180
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:25,040
making use of that right away.

181
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:29,480
And then of course, you will see a sort of steady stream of updates coming out from NVIDIA

182
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:34,200
towards the end of the year, adding more features and then, you know, ramping up the graphics

183
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,880
side of it.

184
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:41,360
And we will keep packaging that in Fedora, although of course, it's still an auto tree

185
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:42,360
driver.

186
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:43,360
I mean, to be clear about that, right?

187
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:46,400
So it's not, so there will still be, you know, some challenges around that fact.

188
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:50,600
But then in parallel with that, of course, we will be working with them and I mean, it

189
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:54,000
will happen in public, because it's not about just Red Hat and NVIDIA, right?

190
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:59,640
It's also about making sure we work openly with the existing Novo community and Mesa

191
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:02,080
community in general.

192
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:05,740
To come up with like, how can this look in the long run?

193
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:09,960
And how can we make sure that we have something that is, you know, suits all of NVIDIA's

194
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:14,440
needs and that suits all of the Mesa open source community's needs.

195
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:15,440
Hmm.

196
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,440
Okay.

197
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:20,560
You know, I have noticed recently, and I think Michael, our beloved Pharaonix also noticed

198
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:26,000
recently, there has been some compute specific code being submitted to the Linux kernel.

199
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,000
So this is all going upstream, it's not Fedora specific.

200
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,080
No, it's all going upstream.

201
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:36,520
I mean, as you can see from reading their blog post about this, I mean, the driver from

202
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:41,560
day one is publishing it on GitHub.

203
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:45,160
And then of course, part of the work with us, right, is, I mean, part of the reason

204
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:47,440
why we also want to do this shared driver is to get this upstream.

205
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:51,480
I mean, that will make life so much easier for everyone if it becomes the actual upstream

206
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:56,000
driver eventually that we have here and that is worked on by us and by community members

207
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,440
in general and of course, by NVIDIA engineers.

208
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:04,820
This really feels like every now and then in Linux, we've had these things that were

209
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:08,640
just these mountains that would just seem like they were going to be this way forever

210
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:10,080
and would never change.

211
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:12,480
And then one day they change.

212
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,660
And then we look on, okay, what's the next thing?

213
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:17,280
And I think for a lot of people, the next thing has always been, well, we got to get

214
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:18,640
that NVIDIA driver open source.

215
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:19,640
That's got to be the next thing.

216
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:22,280
That would really make life a lot easier for folks.

217
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:23,280
And now what?

218
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:24,760
Now what are we going to complain about?

219
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:26,360
Yeah, no, exactly.

220
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:31,840
I mean, you know, one thing I put a lot of blood, sweat, and tears into ever since joining

221
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:36,600
Red Hat is of course trying to beef up what we do around Fedora workstation and dealing

222
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:40,520
with NVIDIA driver has sort of, I mean, you know, we've worked with NVIDIA around GLWD

223
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:44,960
and so on because that was a critical point in making things smoother, but this will eventually

224
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:53,440
allow us to make NVIDIA an equally easy solution to work with as today with Intel and AMD, right?

225
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:57,440
Because it's, you know, upstream drivers, everything should work out of the box.

226
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:00,760
Since we're using the same firmware that NVIDIA is using for their closed source drivers,

227
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:06,040
it means that you don't get these kinds of delays that we, for instance, had with Novo.

228
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:12,000
And for me, this is sort of a huge step forward just in making Linux install and set up a

229
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
lot easier.

230
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:18,000
I feel that often if people these days try out Linux and trip up, it's often about like

231
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,160
either, you know, don't even knowing that you need to get this separate driver from

232
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:27,880
NVIDIA and then like, hey, why is my graphics performance so slow?

233
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:29,480
Or just having trouble still with it.

234
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:34,400
I mean, I think things have gotten a lot better thanks to, you know, getting things packaged

235
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:38,160
up and then made available to NOMO Software for us and so on and other people have put

236
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:43,560
it under ISOs to make it easier, but this will sort of, you know, remove all the needs

237
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:48,360
for all these kind of weird special casing and relying on third-party repositories and

238
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:49,840
all these kinds of things.

239
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:50,840
Yeah.

240
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:55,000
I mean, it feels like it's going to be a true, once we kind of see the full fruits of the

241
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,840
labor down, sounds like towards the end of the year and maybe beyond, we're going to

242
00:13:57,840 --> 00:14:02,360
see a smoother desktop Linux experience than we've ever seen before, it sounds like.

243
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:09,080
And Red Hat is, I feel like this is a great example of Red Hat really doing something

244
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:14,200
at the, doing the really hard long-term work, especially you and people over there, you

245
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:19,080
know, doing this long, hard-term work to make this possible for all Linux systems.

246
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:22,920
So I mean, I know everybody's super grateful and I want to say personally, thank you, because

247
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:25,600
I have some NVIDIA cards right here in the studio and this is going to make life easier

248
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:26,600
for us.

249
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:30,360
Is there anything we haven't touched on that you think might be relevant to the discussion?

250
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:33,560
I mean, there's so much up in the air right now, any more clarity we could give?

251
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:37,160
No, I think it takes just, of course, one bigger reminder is that, you know, this is

252
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:39,120
not going to be an overnight fix, as we talked about.

253
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:42,800
NVIDIA's driver leaves some time to start supporting all the graphics cases and of course,

254
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:46,480
it will take time to do this rewrite to get everything upstream.

255
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:51,920
So people should expect to be a little bit patient before this is available, but this

256
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:55,320
will allow us to resolve a lot of items.

257
00:14:55,320 --> 00:15:01,060
And it also allows us in my team to spend our resources better, because at the moment

258
00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:07,320
we have Ben Skaggs, who's been a Novo maintainer, more or less working full-time on Novo.

259
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:10,940
And a lot of that is sort of just, you know, in collaboration with NVIDIA, but still sort

260
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:13,160
of trying to figure out how things work and so on.

261
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:17,360
And I know we can maybe have him more help push Envelope forward as opposed to just sort

262
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:19,600
of trying to keep Novo alive.

263
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:20,600
Right.

264
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:22,280
Yeah, that could be.

265
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:25,280
That might be something that's, yeah, I appreciate you underscoring that.

266
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:27,720
Because that could be a long-term benefit of this as well.

267
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:32,640
And it seems like this is going to improve the situation for laptops too, that come with

268
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:34,040
NVIDIA cards in them.

269
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:37,860
And hopefully we'll be able to focus on things like, you know, maybe next year, the year

270
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:42,400
after that, we're really nailing energy usage or something like that and fixing sleep and

271
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:43,400
things.

272
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:44,400
Yeah, exactly.

273
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:47,600
I mean, and it means that, you know, we will all be sharing the same infrastructure and

274
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:53,720
then, you know, this will be a lot easier for the desktop environments, right?

275
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:56,360
Because eventually you can, for the most part, rely on the MESA stack for everything.

276
00:15:56,360 --> 00:16:00,880
So you don't need to have a special case or deal with all that OpenGL implementation

277
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:04,760
behaves a bit differently in so many cases and all these kind of things that creates

278
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:05,760
pain.

279
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:10,160
I mean, I think overall, I'm also just excited because I think it will allow us to more quickly

280
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:15,160
move forward with new features like, you know, one other big effort for graphics that we

281
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:21,040
have at Reddit at the moment, right, is trying to get HDR support plumbed through the system.

282
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:24,320
And that's one of these things where, you know, we need kernel drivers updated to support

283
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:25,320
it.

284
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:26,680
We need GNOME Shell updated to support it.

285
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:29,880
We need the GTK and Qt updated to support it.

286
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:33,480
So it's sort of like, and we need MESA updated to support it, we need open source Vulkan

287
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:34,480
drivers to support it.

288
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:38,920
So I mean, it's sort of like you need touching everywhere and then, of course, having NVIDIA

289
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:42,640
being such a critical part of the graphic ecosystem not being something we can touch,

290
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:46,840
but instead we have to then constantly wait for NVIDIA themselves to do updates in the

291
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:50,040
binder driver means that we can, you know, push these things forward a lot easier.

292
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:51,040
Right.

293
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:54,360
And it's also just going to make that story better for the distributions, right?

294
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:57,920
Because end users, especially new ones that are adopting Linux, they don't really appreciate

295
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:00,320
where the delay is in the feature set.

296
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:03,880
They don't understand that there's another vendor that has to release code.

297
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:07,280
They got their desktop distro and they want that feature and they don't really care why

298
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:08,280
it doesn't work.

299
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:09,280
Yeah.

300
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:12,520
Well, that may be a thing of the past in the near future.

301
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:15,040
Christian, thanks for helping explain all of this.

302
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:16,040
This is really exciting.

303
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:17,960
Yeah, I'm really excited too.

304
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:23,040
So I hope to hope, of course, also people who are listening in, if you are interested

305
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:26,800
in helping out, I mean, you know, the Mesa community is always happy for any contributors

306
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:28,920
to come along and help out.

307
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:34,360
Like any open source project, there are a lot more tasks and people at any given time.

308
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:35,360
No kidding.

309
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:37,320
We'll put some links out to help people find all that.

310
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:38,320
Thank you, Christian.

311
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:39,320
Thank you.

312
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:45,240
And I want to take a moment and thank our sponsors for making this reporting possible.

313
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:46,240
Thank you to Linode.

314
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:52,760
Go to linode.com slash land to get $100 in 60 day credit on a new account.

315
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:58,840
Linode offers just the best options for developers, businesses and Linux users that don't want

316
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:03,000
the complexity of hyperscalers and don't need their endless options.

317
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,320
Linode's how we run everything we've built for the last few years in the cloud.

318
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:07,960
And you can tell when you use the product.

319
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:08,960
They love Linux.

320
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:11,920
It's what got them going 19 years ago.

321
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:16,200
And now they have some of the best services, 11 data centers around the world, 30 to 50

322
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:19,720
percent cheaper than the hyperscalers that are trying to lock into their platform.

323
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:24,900
They got some of the best performance, the absolute best support, and I love great features

324
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:31,140
like their object storage, their clean, simple API, command line tools, cloud firewall, backups

325
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:32,140
and more.

326
00:18:32,140 --> 00:18:33,520
So go build something.

327
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:35,160
Go learn something.

328
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:36,380
Try it and support the show.

329
00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:39,960
Get $100 by going to linode.com slash land.

330
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:42,480
That's $100 for 60 days on a new account.

331
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:51,840
Linux.ting.com and a big thank you to Ting for sponsoring Linux Action News.

332
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:57,640
If you're sick of overpaying cell service like I was back in 2013, go to Linux.ting.com.

333
00:18:57,640 --> 00:19:01,440
I've been a customer since then because it's the smarter way to do mobile.

334
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:07,800
Ting offers nationwide coverage, a great mix of plans and fast data on LTE and 5G on the

335
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:13,040
big nationwide carrier networks, but you're interfacing with Ting, who was recently named

336
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:16,420
number one by Consumer Reports in 2021.

337
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:19,920
And Ting has great customer service and no contracts ever.

338
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:23,840
They got a plan that works for just about anybody out there, and you're going to start

339
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:25,320
saving right away.

340
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:28,180
So when you go to Linux.ting.com, you check your current phone.

341
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:31,900
If it's compatible, they're going to give you $25 in service credit.

342
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:35,360
But if you're ready to pull the trigger and buy a new phone, they'll give you $25 towards

343
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:36,360
a new device as well.

344
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:39,120
You're going to be amazed how simple and quick it is to get started.

345
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:42,960
They have a fantastic dashboard, and the plans are so straightforward, you're going to grok

346
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:44,360
it right away.

347
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:45,360
Go try it out.

348
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:49,960
See why I've been using it since 2013 and why Consumer Reports says they're the best.

349
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:55,640
Linux.ting.com.

350
00:19:55,640 --> 00:20:00,200
After we wrapped, Christian mentioned he believes this is also going to be a huge benefit for

351
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:03,360
Vulkan video encoding and decoding as well.

352
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:06,760
That's something I hadn't even considered or gotten excited about yet.

353
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:08,560
I can only imagine, right?

354
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:12,300
You got to figure that the improvements and innovation we're going to see as this code

355
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:15,640
begins to land upstream is just going to multiply.

356
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:18,240
Like we might not even have a full picture yet.

357
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:23,800
This might just be the biggest story in Linux for 2022 that might continue to evolve with

358
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:25,600
new developments all the time.

359
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,280
I think no doubt there is more to come.

360
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:31,400
So we'll keep an eye on this and everything else in the world of free and open source

361
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:32,400
software.
