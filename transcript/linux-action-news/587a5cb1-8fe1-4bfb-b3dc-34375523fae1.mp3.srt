00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,060
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, our weekly take on Linux and the open source world.

2
00:00:16,060 --> 00:00:20,520
This is episode 37, recorded on January 21st, 2018.

3
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:21,520
I'm Chris.

4
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:22,520
And I'm Joe.

5
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:27,240
Hello Joe, it's good to be connected with you, and man do we have a lot to cover this

6
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:28,240
week.

7
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:30,400
Let's start out with an open source classic.

8
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:33,580
It's really getting to be a fine vintage too.

9
00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:36,600
Version 3.0 of the Wine Project is out.

10
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:43,000
Yeah, after a year of development and 6,000 changes, there's a lot new in here, like Direct

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:49,440
3D 10 and 11 support, and Android stuff as well.

12
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:54,760
But in all honesty, as huge as this is, I haven't used Wine for years.

13
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:57,660
Is it something you really use regularly still?

14
00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:00,120
From time to time, and I may even more.

15
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:05,420
I mean, just for context, Wine was originally released on July 4th, 1993.

16
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:08,080
And yes, that is 24 years ago.

17
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:12,800
So it's just amazing to see them shipping 3.0 24 years ago.

18
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:14,400
Talk about sticking with it.

19
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:19,080
But some of the things I've seen prop up online make me think I may be taking another look

20
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:20,080
at Wine.

21
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:24,520
So version 3.0 supports Direct 3D 10 and 11.

22
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:31,080
There is an improved Direct Write and Direct 2D support, which with that also brings support

23
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:35,560
potentially for Adobe Photoshop CS 2018.

24
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:37,760
I suppose that is quite big.

25
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:44,640
But then again, every time I've ever used Wine, it's kind of, it's never quite right,

26
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:45,640
is it?

27
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:47,080
If you're talking about games, perhaps.

28
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:53,760
But if you're talking about productivity applications, you're talking about your one-off executables

29
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:55,680
that you need to do your job from time to time.

30
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:59,800
I actually have found it to be pretty, actually, I won't even say pretty.

31
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:01,800
When it does work, it's remarkable.

32
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:02,800
It is remarkable.

33
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:04,560
So yeah, it doesn't do everything.

34
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,720
But what it does do, it blows me away now.

35
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:10,900
And I'm saying this trying, like recently, I was just going through this whole spat of

36
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:16,640
Windows applications that, for example, my Garmin navigation unit, which is a Windows-only

37
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:19,840
application update, I was able to run that under Wine recently.

38
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:23,760
And that's even communicating over the internet and with a USB device.

39
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,880
I was very, very appreciative of that.

40
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:28,800
Yeah, something like that you don't really want to be installing Windows for.

41
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:33,820
But I think if you're spending a lot of time in something like Photoshop, does it really

42
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:35,920
make sense to do it in Linux?

43
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:38,500
Or does it make more sense to just dual boot?

44
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:39,760
It's certainly what I would do.

45
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:40,920
Yeah, I suppose so.

46
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:43,160
So what do you think of the Android graphics driver?

47
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:44,760
Yeah, now that is interesting.

48
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:49,520
Although, as far as I know, that is only the x86 version of Android.

49
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:53,560
So that is fairly limited in the number of devices that it supports.

50
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:58,640
But it does represent a kind of step into the present.

51
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:02,720
I was going to say future, but it's more the present, really, that you have to kind of

52
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,360
support Android these days.

53
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:08,040
And along those lines, this is also the version that officially supports Vulkan.

54
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:12,380
Yeah, and that means that any games that are using Vulkan are going to work much better

55
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:14,200
in Wine, which is good news.

56
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:17,440
I suppose that's the main real use of this, isn't it?

57
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:22,240
People who want to stick to Linux, but they really want to play some games that are just

58
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,480
not available.

59
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:28,600
Speaking of those Android users, those of you that have bought something from OnePlus

60
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:32,440
in the last few months may need to take a look at your credit card statement.

61
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:36,240
Yeah, now I did buy a OnePlus phone not all that long ago.

62
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:39,640
But thankfully, I bought that off Gumtree, which is like your Craigslist.

63
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:41,440
So no problem there.

64
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:47,080
But yeah, this is the latest in a line of bad news coming from OnePlus, isn't it?

65
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:54,200
So if you put your credit card info in the last, well, they say between mid-November

66
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:56,600
and January 11, 2018.

67
00:03:56,600 --> 00:04:02,400
So it could be before that, you never know, then your info was compromised.

68
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:05,760
So that really just does not look good for them.

69
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:10,960
We had the spyware stuff, the backdoors, whatever.

70
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:15,840
Now this, it's made me lose all confidence in OnePlus, I must say.

71
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:19,960
It sounds like the root cause was a malicious script that was operating intermittently,

72
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:25,760
capturing and sending data directly from the user's browser to the hackers.

73
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:28,900
So it was probably something that was compromised on their website would be a safe assumption,

74
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:30,320
but that is an assumption.

75
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,160
And there are some caveats.

76
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:35,840
If you bought something and paid via a saved credit card, something that you saved to your

77
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:37,900
profile, you're not affected.

78
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:41,960
And if you paid via the credit card via PayPal, you're not affected.

79
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:45,060
And if you just paid via straight PayPal, you're not affected.

80
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:50,040
So it seems it was something that was actively monitoring input on the user and then capturing

81
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,040
that data.

82
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,720
Well, this is what OnePlus saves.

83
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:56,380
But how do we know that that is necessarily the truth?

84
00:04:56,380 --> 00:04:57,600
That might be what they think.

85
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:02,640
But if someone was able to take control of a server that allowed them to capture that

86
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:05,920
data, who knows what other data is being captured as well.

87
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:11,560
And you would have thought probably the PayPal stuff is OK, but saved credit card information,

88
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:14,280
I would be concerned, put it that way.

89
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:20,080
If I had my credit card and hang on, I'm just thinking, I think I do have that was a long

90
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,080
time ago.

91
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:22,080
So now I'm OK.

92
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,080
Hopefully I think that card's expired.

93
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:24,080
Oh, good.

94
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:25,080
You never know, though.

95
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:26,640
It does give you pause, doesn't it?

96
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:30,920
I think you're probably OK, Joe, just because if I'm reading between the lines, if I put

97
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:36,440
my TechSnap hat on and my TechSnap goggles, what I'm reading here is that it was a website

98
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:40,800
JavaScript vulnerability or something that was inserted on their web page and it was

99
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,320
doing like a key logging.

100
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:46,720
So the reason why saved credit cards are safe is because it wasn't their database that was

101
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:47,720
breached.

102
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:52,720
It was the actual action of users typing in their credit card that was captured.

103
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:56,760
And so if you went via a method where you didn't type in your credit card, well, they

104
00:05:56,760 --> 00:06:00,200
may have captured other things on the site, but they didn't capture your credit card.

105
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:04,520
Yeah, but again, if they were able to inject JavaScript into that page, then who knows

106
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:05,960
what else they were able to do.

107
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:12,120
But I think you're probably right, but I'm still skeptical of them because it's still

108
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:16,640
quite vague what OnePlus is saying about it, saying mid-November, they don't know exactly

109
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:20,680
when it was compromised and therefore they don't know exactly what happened.

110
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:25,520
They haven't had time really to go through all the logs and work out exactly to what

111
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:26,760
extent they were compromised.

112
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:33,200
So I'm just thinking for my next phone now, I don't know because what else is there?

113
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:41,200
That's got a nice big screen and is hackable and has got first class lineage support.

114
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,560
I really don't know.

115
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:45,440
And also, crucially, isn't ridiculously expensive.

116
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:46,440
That's the main thing.

117
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:51,280
Yeah, you do wonder when something like this happens, what would the reaction be if this

118
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:57,320
was Motorola or Samsung or the Pixel phone when people ordered the Pixel phone or the

119
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:58,880
iPhone?

120
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:01,040
Imagine the outrage if this was the iPhone.

121
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:06,080
And OnePlus says that they cannot apologize enough for letting something like this happen

122
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:10,520
and that they are eternally grateful to have such a vigilant and informed community.

123
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:12,200
And it pains to let you down.

124
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:16,840
They say they've made contact or are attempting to make contact with all of the affected customers,

125
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:20,680
which gives the implication that they seem to know exactly which customers were impacted

126
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:21,680
by this.

127
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:24,760
Perhaps they know which vulnerability was on their website and when they patched it

128
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:27,740
and which orders took place during that window.

129
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:32,080
And all measures they say are in place to help prevent such incidents from happening

130
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:33,640
in the future.

131
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:37,400
Well the easiest way to stop happening in the future is to not buy anything from them

132
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:41,000
again, which is what I will do, unfortunately.

133
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,760
Well speaking of no longer being a customer, at least if all of the news headlines are

134
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:48,040
to be believed, Google will no longer be using Ubuntu.

135
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:53,040
Yeah, so this is their internal not quite a distro that runs on some of the workstations

136
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:58,760
within the company alongside Mac OS and Windows and Chrome OS on some of the others.

137
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:04,680
And it was originally Ubuntu, which was based on Ubuntu, and now they're switching to Debian

138
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:10,120
testing for the base of the distro, which isn't a huge change, is it, in reality?

139
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:14,760
What's interesting, Joe, is all of this is coming out of a lightning talk at DebConf

140
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:15,760
17.

141
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:19,320
And there's a couple other details that were dropped in there, including Debian's been

142
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:23,480
pretty heavily used at Google for a while now in different areas.

143
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:26,480
And Google's been a longtime strong Debian supporter.

144
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:32,160
In 2017, Debian credited Google for making their annual conference even possible in the

145
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:33,160
first place.

146
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:35,480
So there's been a pretty tight relationship there.

147
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:42,960
And if you're basing an OS off of a base Linux distro, it does make a lot of sense, especially

148
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:46,000
if you want rolling, to base it off Debian testing.

149
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,200
Do you think that's what this boils down to, that they wanted something rolling rather

150
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:52,360
than the Ubuntu snapshot way of doing it?

151
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:55,720
I do, especially if you want your own rolling distribution.

152
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:59,520
See that's what this is about, is Google wants their own rolling distribution.

153
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:03,600
Google takes each Debian testing package, rebuilds it, tests it, and then files and

154
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:04,820
fixes bugs.

155
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:09,800
And once all of those are resolved, it integrates it into its own GLinux release candidate,

156
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:11,180
which is what they're calling it now.

157
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:13,460
And then that goes out into their own repos.

158
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:17,080
And Google's building a real solution here, something that works for an entire in-house

159
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:18,140
automation system.

160
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:21,800
The new Linux images are automatically built from compressed tar format archives.

161
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:27,160
And then these images are then placed on an HTTPS server, which the remote workers can

162
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:31,440
access when they're in the Google complex or when they're working remote.

163
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:36,200
And these are running Debian pre-seed files that automate portions of the host installation.

164
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:40,240
So you can set down a laptop on the Google network, and the installation is fired up

165
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:44,760
via network boot, uses Puppet to integrate all of the configuration management and set

166
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:47,880
up all of the update paths and all of the source files.

167
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:51,960
And according to different news reports, this entire thing can be done in 30 minutes.

168
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:57,400
You take a bare laptop, you hook it into the network, and you can blast GLinux or blast

169
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:59,240
gubuntu on there, whichever one you want.

170
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:02,440
They're both still available, and the whole thing's ready to go in 30 minutes, managed

171
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:03,440
by Puppet.

172
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:06,680
And when you look at their infrastructure, when they're rebuilding individual packages

173
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:13,760
already, maintaining their own repos, doing pixie boot network imaging, why not just create

174
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:16,160
your own distro based off Debian at that point?

175
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:17,780
That's just the next logical step.

176
00:10:17,780 --> 00:10:24,040
So you're not going in for these conspiracy theories that they are hedging against Ubuntu

177
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:27,680
either going away or making more significant changes then?

178
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:28,680
Hmm.

179
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:29,680
I hadn't heard that.

180
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:30,680
I mean, it would make sense too.

181
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:34,640
That just seems like another benefit of doing this.

182
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:38,640
And if you're going to be rebasing everybody's desktop on GNOME anyways, this is the time

183
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:40,160
to make a change like this.

184
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:42,240
Yeah, that's true, I suppose.

185
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:47,240
If you're going to have to deal with major changes either way, then why not go back to

186
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:53,040
the source rather than being something that's based off something that's based off Debian?

187
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:56,000
Why not just base it off Debian in the first place?

188
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,140
Control your own destiny.

189
00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:01,920
That's perfectly viable for large corporations like Google.

190
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:06,560
For smaller businesses like Jupiter Broadcasting, I appreciate the curation and the maintenance

191
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:07,700
and the care.

192
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:10,800
And so it's just different solutions for different sized businesses.

193
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:13,520
I'm surprised this hasn't happened already in some ways.

194
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:16,720
I'm kind of tempted to just play around with and try it myself.

195
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:22,840
Yeah, I'd quite like to try it out on my own systems, but unfortunately, it's not a distro,

196
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:23,840
is it?

197
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:26,400
You almost in a way have to respect the fact that this thing's never leaked, at least as

198
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:27,400
far as I've seen.

199
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:29,680
I've never seen an ISO available for download.

200
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:34,200
They have gone to significant extents to prevent this thing from showing up in the public.

201
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:38,880
Oh, well, here's hoping.

Linux Academy dot com slash unplugged.

203
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:43,680
Learn to build your own Linux distribution from the fundamentals all the way up to the

204
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:46,920
things in the cloud that make you all the money and look good on the resume, self-paced

205
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:50,900
in-depth video courses on every Linux cloud and DevOps topic.

206
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:54,500
You get hands-on scenario-based labs that give you real experience so that way, not

207
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:58,960
only do you test better because you've done it, but when you go to work in production,

208
00:11:58,960 --> 00:11:59,960
you've done it before.

209
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:01,840
It's not your first time in production.

210
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:02,880
That's always a good thing.

211
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:06,240
And if you ever get stuck when you're working on any of the Linux Academy material, they

212
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:09,140
have real-time human beings ready to help you.

213
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:12,560
And if life's busy, I understand they have a course schedule, you set a time frame that

214
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:15,120
helps you stick to it and set learning goals.

215
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:18,320
And they have practice exams to help you get ready for the big test, flashcards forked

216
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:22,320
by the community, and a community stacked full of Jupiter Broadcasting members.

217
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:26,160
And they also have downloadable comprehensive study guides and lesson audio that you can

218
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:27,160
listen to offline.

219
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:31,360
And if you have a connection, maybe you're commuting on the bus or in the tube, well,

220
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:33,680
they have iOS and Android apps as well.

224
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:49,680
Okay, so Meltdown and Spectre, the story that just will not go away.

225
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:55,360
Let's start with an update from Greg Kh about where we are with the kernel and the question

226
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:56,800
of is my machine vulnerable?

227
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:58,720
Well, it's very straightforward.

228
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:03,280
You just grep a certain directory and it tells you whether you're vulnerable or not.

229
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:04,560
Or does it?

230
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:07,080
Yeah, that does depend on your kernel.

231
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:08,840
And we'll have a link in the show notes.

232
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:13,320
Just go to Linux action news dot com slash 37 to get this link.

233
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:14,480
And it's pretty neat.

234
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:18,480
It just lists out all of the potential things that your CPU could be vulnerable for.

235
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:23,520
I like this a lot because it just gives you a clear understanding unless you're not running

236
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:25,200
a current kernel.

237
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,200
Then it's well, then you don't get new things.

238
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:33,280
Well, yeah, if you run in a distro kernel, like we are with Ubuntu, for example, then

239
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:37,880
this just doesn't work, even though they have patched against Meltdown.

240
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:40,440
There's not really this easy way to know that.

241
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:41,440
Right.

242
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:44,320
There is an elegance to how simple this is.

243
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:48,240
This doesn't seem like a feature that would be impossible for the distro maintainers to

244
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:49,240
backport, though.

245
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:52,080
It's funny the tone that Greg's maintained throughout all this.

246
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:54,720
He's been very down on distro kernels, isn't he?

247
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:57,960
Yeah, in fact, there's a paragraph that I liked quite a bit.

248
00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:04,720
He says some quote unquote enterprise distributions did not backport the changes for this reporting.

249
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:09,660
So if you're running one of those types of kernels, go bug the vendor to fix that.

250
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:12,960
You really want a unified way of knowing the state of your system.

251
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:16,800
Which kind of makes sense if you're working directly on the kernel, then you want people

252
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:19,060
to use that version of it.

253
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:22,800
You don't want people to be using something that's being changed.

254
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:28,120
I think when it comes to Meltdown Inspector, the kernel team really wants a unified way

255
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:30,200
for everybody to manage this.

256
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:34,440
He goes as far as to say if your kernel doesn't have the sysfs directory or files, then there's

257
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:37,600
obviously a problem and you need to upgrade your kernel.

258
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:42,000
And I think the emphasis is we can't really fully address this unless everybody's on the

259
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
same page.

260
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Well, yeah, that's true.

261
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,820
Although, isn't the point of distros that they are different from each other?

262
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:52,520
There is something that differentiates them from the other distros and you take something

263
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:56,680
like Ubuntu, they've added value to the generic kernel, haven't they?

264
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:59,680
I suppose the markets already sort of bared this out, right?

265
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:02,200
Well, yeah, so it would seem.

266
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:06,920
So Red Hat's having a bit of a back and forth depending on which particular lens you look

267
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:08,480
at this situation.

268
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:14,240
They are doing an about face, trying to save face and blame everything on Intel, or depending

269
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:19,020
on who you ask, they're taking a unified approach to make sure everything is just exactly how

270
00:15:19,020 --> 00:15:23,320
the users expect it and we're waiting for things to come together upstream.

271
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:25,200
Just depends on which lens you put on that day.

272
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:30,800
Yeah, this is specifically this microcode update, which has come directly from Intel.

273
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:37,200
And that is to mitigate against the specter side of things rather than meltdown.

274
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:43,120
And Intel released this and I've patched a couple of my machines with it and it's worked

275
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:49,400
fine, but there've been reports of random reboots and machines that won't boot at all.

276
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:55,320
And Red Hat originally pushed it out and then they pulled it because it made sense to do

277
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:56,320
that.

278
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:58,120
It wasn't working properly.

279
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:02,600
And people have kind of come down on them saying that they just want to offload the

280
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:07,080
responsibility, which can you really blame them?

281
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:12,480
It's this black box binary that just gets pushed out by Intel and you just have to trust

282
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:14,120
that it's going to do what it's supposed to do.

283
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:18,640
Yeah, it's actually encrypted and signed, so they can't even pull it apart and kind

284
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:21,720
of deduce what it does.

285
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:26,400
And so Red Hat in a statement said, the microcode was supplied to us and it did not cover all

286
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:29,960
of the microprocessors that our customers possibly could use.

287
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:33,600
It appears subsequently that there may have also been two versions that could have some

288
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:34,700
regressions.

289
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:37,940
We're looking at providing our customers with a consistent experience.

290
00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:42,120
It's very difficult for us to say in this case, but applying this package and two other

291
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:46,200
cases, you can't just say talk to somebody else or in a third case, talk to another or

292
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:47,400
fourth party.

293
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:51,320
So what they're doing is they've decided to wait until there was a complete set of microcodes

294
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:55,800
available and then wait for the community project to catch up and then once everything's

295
00:16:55,800 --> 00:17:00,160
all there and tested and known to work well, they're going to revisit it, which I think

296
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:03,340
is probably Red Hat for saying then they'll republish it again.

297
00:17:03,340 --> 00:17:09,280
Until then, Red Hat is recommending that customers apply Spectre and Meltdown related patches

298
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:14,540
and then contact their CPU vendors for the firmware updates specifically, like the microcode.

299
00:17:14,540 --> 00:17:19,940
This is such a delicate balancing act, isn't it, between security and stability.

300
00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:26,240
You kind of have to weigh up the risk and yes, there is this serious vulnerability, but

301
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:29,160
what are the chances of it actually being exploited at this stage?

302
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:35,240
There's more and more proof of concepts coming out as each day goes by, but do you sacrifice

303
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:41,040
stability and performance and the fact that you might break things to mitigate against

304
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:44,000
something that is just kind of theoretical?

305
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:50,000
So I can see why they've taken this more conservative approach to patching.

306
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,160
Seems pretty reasonable to me.

307
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:55,120
It's a risk, but you got to weigh that against making your machine crash and I think that's

308
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:58,400
also why I like the way Canonical is approaching this.

309
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:03,680
This week they published candidate Ubuntu kernels that provide mitigations for Spectre

310
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:09,360
variants 1 and 2, which the fact that they even have a potential mitigation to variant

311
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:12,260
2 Spectre, I'm pretty impressed with, but they're not shipping it.

312
00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:13,720
They're not saying it's done yet.

313
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:18,360
They've released candidate kernels for 1710, 1604, and 1404.

314
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:20,480
Yeah, which is a very nice approach, isn't it?

315
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:26,200
It means if you want to do on-premises testing, then you can do it before you deploy it to

316
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:31,520
all of your workloads out there, rather than just pushing it out and letting all the users

317
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:33,800
test it for you.

318
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:41,120
It's available for those who want it and want to test it and really are prioritizing security.

319
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:47,720
It looks like that testing is almost complete now and hopefully we will see this around

320
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:50,360
about the time people are listening to this episode.

321
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:54,620
You should also see a corresponding Intel microcode update for many of the Intel CPUs

322
00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:58,340
and eventually an AMD 64 microcode update as well.

323
00:18:58,340 --> 00:19:03,120
It's the combination of the software updates and the microcode updates together that actually

324
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:07,000
mitigate most of the vulnerabilities as we know it.

325
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,120
Or do they, Joe?

326
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:15,360
Well, that's the thing, SkyfallAttack.com has cropped up and it says Skyfall and Solus.

327
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:20,120
Not to be confused with Solus, of course, Ike's delighted by this name.

328
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:27,560
It says more vulnerabilities in modern computers and it's basically saying that this is just

329
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:32,200
the beginning, Meltdown and Spectre, and there's going to be more coming out and there's something

330
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:34,640
under embargo that we're going to publish soon.

331
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:38,560
It's all very speculative, but it's all very worrying at the same time.

332
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:41,560
I feel bad for Ike, that's a lot of name collision.

333
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:46,640
I guess the implication is that Skyfall and Solus are two speculative attacks based on

334
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:50,600
the works highlighted in Meltdown and Spectre, but the full details are completely under

335
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:52,820
an embargo but will be published soon.

336
00:19:52,820 --> 00:20:00,280
So watch this space, the website says, which is very teasy and obviously trying to generate

337
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:01,280
hype.

338
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:07,520
And can you really trust anyone who doesn't specify a background color on their website?

339
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:08,960
Who can you trust then, Joe?

340
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:09,960
Who can you trust?

341
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:12,160
I say that because it looks gray with my theme.

342
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:16,000
If people don't specify white as a background color, then I know that they are lazy web

343
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,640
devs, but there we go.

344
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:22,120
You are a true XFCE user to the core, my friend.

345
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:26,920
It's a long story, but it's to do with my Firefox profile that I never fixed and I probably

346
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:27,920
should fix it.

347
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:33,200
So I've left it so that it does point that out to me, who's being lazy.

348
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:40,800
But someone who has not been lazy are the team behind NHS Ubuntu, and then they changed

349
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:43,340
it to NHOS.

350
00:20:43,340 --> 00:20:48,880
This was an Ubuntu-based distro that was very much aimed at the National Health Service

351
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:50,940
here in the UK.

352
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:56,160
And this gained a lot of attention after the huge ransomware attack last year that crippled

353
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:58,720
a lot of the NHS infrastructure.

354
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:04,620
And some people were hopeful that this would happen and that the NHS might change over

355
00:21:04,620 --> 00:21:07,920
to Linux, but I was always very skeptical.

356
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:12,200
And I was always assuming that they were going to be shut down because of the NHS trademark,

357
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:15,160
which they are very, very protective about.

358
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:17,120
And sure enough, that has happened now.

359
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:18,580
Yeah, that's a bit of a shame.

360
00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:24,880
The volunteer force behind NHOS wanted NHS Ubuntu to replace the current smart card verification

361
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:29,980
system that was running on Windows, and ultimately have the operating system replace Windows

362
00:21:29,980 --> 00:21:32,320
on the desktop as well.

363
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:36,900
And they went through trademark disputes, they made adjustments based on what they thought

364
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:40,200
they needed to, and they got to the end of it.

365
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:45,000
And well, they did what sort of reads as a rage quit, but a bit understandable when you

366
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,440
look in the context.

367
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:50,180
They feel like they were leveraged to negotiate with Microsoft, and that's why they got some

368
00:21:50,180 --> 00:21:52,320
attention but no official support.

369
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:57,320
They never really felt like they were wanted other than wanted to get a better deal from

370
00:21:57,320 --> 00:21:59,040
Microsoft.

371
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:03,260
We've seen that kind of negotiating tactic a lot where a government or a company gets

372
00:22:03,260 --> 00:22:07,320
locked into Microsoft and they don't really have an option to leave Microsoft, but they

373
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:11,480
will flirt or threaten to flirt with switching to LibreOffice.

374
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:15,080
And if you don't give us a great deal, we're going to switch to LibreOffice.

375
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:19,040
And it seems like it's sort of a negotiating tactic when there's no real sincerity behind

376
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:20,040
it.

377
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:22,080
Now, you see, I'm just not having that at all.

378
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:25,240
It's Marcus Boer who was the co-founder of this.

379
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:31,040
He said that they'd used it as a negotiating tactic and everything, but I just think in

380
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:34,160
reality it was just never going to happen.

381
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:41,000
And they almost had some meetings with some higher-ups in the IT department of the NHS,

382
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:47,360
but I just think that it was just a complete pipe dream of them to think that they were

383
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:55,640
ever going to break the monopoly stranglehold that Microsoft has over the NHS, as they have

384
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:58,080
over so many enterprises all over the world.

385
00:22:58,080 --> 00:22:59,080
Yeah, fair enough.

386
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:03,000
People have established workflows and they got a job to get done.

387
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,000
Yeah.

388
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:09,760
And changing the infrastructure of something as huge as the NHS is not something that happens

389
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:13,560
quickly, if at all, essentially.

390
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:20,860
There's still tons of machines running XP even now in the NHS, and so you can't expect

391
00:23:20,860 --> 00:23:25,840
them to seriously consider changing major infrastructure over to Linux.

392
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:29,760
It would be great if it would happen, and I would be all for it, but sometimes you just

393
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:32,260
have to be a bit realistic with these things.

394
00:23:32,260 --> 00:23:37,000
That's why I follow stories out of Barcelona with so much interest, is how does the grand

395
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,840
experiment work out?

396
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:42,520
And we'll check back in on stories like that and many other stories in Linux and the open

397
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:43,520
