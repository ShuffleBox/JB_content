Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, our weekly take on Linux and the open source world.

00:16.320 --> 00:20.460
This is episode 39, recorded on February 4th, 2018.

00:20.460 --> 00:21.460
I'm Chris.

00:21.460 --> 00:22.460
And I'm Joe.

00:22.460 --> 00:23.460
Hello, Joe.

00:23.460 --> 00:24.460
Good morning to you.

00:24.460 --> 00:28.260
It's good to be connected again, and we have some big news.

00:28.260 --> 00:30.560
Red Hat is acquiring CoreOS.

00:30.560 --> 00:36.640
Yes, as they say, expanding their Kubernetes and containers leadership in a move that can

00:36.640 --> 00:40.880
only be described as buying up the competition, as far as I'm concerned.

00:40.880 --> 00:45.040
Well, it's also an acquihire, too, really, which I hate that term, but it is about bringing

00:45.040 --> 00:49.040
on people that have been working with Kubernetes and container technologies for years as their

00:49.040 --> 00:52.120
core focus, now under the Red Hat brand.

00:52.120 --> 00:56.280
Although it sounds like it's going to maintain its own individuality, at least for a while,

00:56.280 --> 00:57.280
more like CentOS.

00:57.280 --> 00:59.960
Well, CentOS is the first thing that sprung to mind.

00:59.960 --> 01:05.960
That was eating potentially some of their business away, and so they decided to control

01:05.960 --> 01:08.120
it by buying it.

01:08.120 --> 01:10.440
But they have decided to let that continue doing what it's doing.

01:10.440 --> 01:12.640
So I could see with CoreOS they would do that.

01:12.640 --> 01:19.240
And it looks like they are more interested in the people making CoreOS and their expertise

01:19.240 --> 01:22.480
than the actual product itself, because after all, it's free software.

01:22.480 --> 01:26.440
They could just take that code and do whatever they wanted with it, as long as they comply

01:26.440 --> 01:27.840
with the license.

01:27.840 --> 01:30.200
This makes a lot of sense, this purchase, looking at this.

01:30.200 --> 01:34.160
Red Hat needed to do something like this to really move forward.

01:34.160 --> 01:38.400
This is just an area of the server market that is exploding right now, and Red Hat being

01:38.400 --> 01:42.520
one of the big names in that market, needed to have a complete, full offering and a real

01:42.520 --> 01:43.520
solid expertise.

01:43.520 --> 01:47.800
The thing is, is some of the technologies that CoreOS have developed are already the

01:47.800 --> 01:49.520
umbrella of the Linux Foundation.

01:49.520 --> 01:56.040
So now Red Hat is acquiring technology or people behind the technology that is essentially

01:56.040 --> 01:58.000
an industry standard at this point.

01:58.000 --> 02:01.720
And they've really been able to bring the competitive edge to Docker and have really

02:01.720 --> 02:04.360
sort of kept Docker and Docker Swarm at bay.

02:04.360 --> 02:09.520
And for $250 million, this is a steal.

02:09.520 --> 02:14.340
Think about it like this, Facebook paid a billion dollars for Instagram.

02:14.340 --> 02:19.320
This CoreOS stuff, it's not just CoreOS, it's all of the underlying technologies that they've

02:19.320 --> 02:21.240
open sourced and that they're experts in.

02:21.240 --> 02:22.800
This stuff is crazy valuable.

02:22.800 --> 02:24.640
It's what businesses are built out of.

02:24.640 --> 02:27.980
Well, there's a reason why Red Hat are the biggest open source company.

02:27.980 --> 02:29.040
They're very sharp, aren't they?

02:29.040 --> 02:31.720
They keep making the right business decisions.

02:31.720 --> 02:34.940
And thankfully, they keep everything open source.

02:34.940 --> 02:37.000
So you can't really knock them, can you?

02:37.000 --> 02:44.120
This is yet another very sharp business decision from them, because they know how to stay relevant

02:44.120 --> 02:45.520
in the open source world.

02:45.520 --> 02:48.500
And now going forward, they're going to remain relevant, aren't they?

02:48.500 --> 02:53.020
My down the road thing I'll be watching for after this acquisition is what happens with

02:53.020 --> 02:55.040
Fedora Atomic fully.

02:55.040 --> 02:58.840
Do they alter that project to be more something in line with CoreOS?

02:58.840 --> 03:00.740
Do they share technologies more between them?

03:00.740 --> 03:02.480
Because there's a lot of overlap there.

03:02.480 --> 03:05.280
And so that'll be interesting to watch just say a year from now.

03:05.280 --> 03:08.480
Or does Fedora Atomic continue on its own and just keep getting better?

03:08.480 --> 03:12.920
I suspect the latter, because it's always a good idea to have competition even within

03:12.920 --> 03:14.160
your own company, isn't it?

03:14.160 --> 03:19.520
If you've kind of got this arms race going on and pushing the features forward in both

03:19.520 --> 03:24.260
of them, then it's probably more valuable ultimately than just getting rid of one and

03:24.260 --> 03:26.360
putting all your eggs in one basket.

03:26.360 --> 03:30.000
So the big technology that's getting talked about in this acquisition is Kubernetes.

03:30.000 --> 03:34.920
And the interesting story behind Kubernetes is that it was a Google Skunk Works project.

03:34.920 --> 03:38.760
This is Google-backed technology that was spun off onto its own.

03:38.760 --> 03:40.880
And now that's what Red Hat's really acquiring.

03:40.880 --> 03:42.140
It's a fascinating story.

03:42.140 --> 03:46.100
If you'd like to know more, check out TechSnap.Systems slash 353.

03:46.100 --> 03:51.320
We have an easy intro into Kubernetes and a deeper context into why this technology

03:51.320 --> 03:54.560
is really important to Red Hat in the future, like Joe was just implying.

03:54.560 --> 03:58.320
It's a major purchase that's going to keep them relevant, and that episode explains why.

03:58.320 --> 04:03.560
Yeah, and there's also fun facts like their logo is Star Trek related, which you liked,

04:03.560 --> 04:04.560
no doubt.

04:04.560 --> 04:05.560
Of course I did.

04:05.560 --> 04:07.840
Now, there's something that everybody always loves.

04:07.840 --> 04:11.280
It's the soft spot we all have on our heart for LibreOffice.

04:11.280 --> 04:15.000
Why Joe, I remember when it was OpenOffice and StarOffice before that.

04:15.000 --> 04:18.640
Now we have version 6.0 of LibreOffice.

04:18.640 --> 04:23.160
This is something that I struggle to get excited about, but I think we have to talk about it.

04:23.160 --> 04:29.280
It seems like a very solid release to me in terms of features, in terms of the file compatibility

04:29.280 --> 04:34.440
and just pushing it forward and trying to remain competitive with what Microsoft are

04:34.440 --> 04:36.980
doing with their Office suite.

04:36.980 --> 04:42.320
And for me, it's already full-featured enough, even really old versions of it.

04:42.320 --> 04:47.120
I don't need very much functionality, but you do have to stay relevant if you're going

04:47.120 --> 04:51.160
to compete with Microsoft, and if you're going to have government switching over and enterprises

04:51.160 --> 04:54.800
switching over, this is the kind of thing that they need to be doing.

04:54.800 --> 05:00.000
And so it all seems pretty positive to me, but as I said, I'm struggling to get too excited,

05:00.000 --> 05:01.000
I'm afraid.

05:01.000 --> 05:02.000
Fair enough.

05:02.000 --> 05:03.000
I pretty much feel the same way.

05:03.000 --> 05:05.520
There are a couple of features that jumped out at me.

05:05.520 --> 05:08.600
For those of us that are trying to reclaim their vertical space, there's a new tabbed

05:08.600 --> 05:11.500
compact view mode for Ryder.

05:11.500 --> 05:15.720
And it's a streamlined version of the standard tab notebook bar that's more like the Office

05:15.720 --> 05:20.280
ribbon, but it's less vertical and it's more like a browser tab.

05:20.280 --> 05:23.440
That's sort of nice for those of us that are currently on a kick like I am.

05:23.440 --> 05:28.080
But probably the biggest feature of LibreOffice 6.0 is the ability to export Ryder documents

05:28.080 --> 05:29.080
to EPUB.

05:29.080 --> 05:33.320
Yeah, that could be a very useful feature in terms of e-readers, and EPUB is just such

05:33.320 --> 05:37.280
a standard now that I'm surprised that they didn't have that before, to be honest.

05:37.280 --> 05:41.920
The other thing that they've baked in, which I'm really happy to see, is open PGP document

05:41.920 --> 05:43.600
signing and encryption support.

05:43.600 --> 05:46.940
Yeah, and even individual paragraphs can be signed, can't they?

05:46.940 --> 05:48.520
That is a really cool feature.

05:48.520 --> 05:50.480
That almost is worth the upgrade right there.

05:50.480 --> 05:53.680
Yeah, it's definitely worth checking out, and hopefully the snap for it will be updated

05:53.680 --> 05:55.240
fairly soon.

05:55.240 --> 05:58.280
And that's something you've been immersed in all week, haven't you, at the SnapCraft

05:58.280 --> 05:59.920
Summit in Seattle?

05:59.920 --> 06:04.320
Yeah, it was downtown at the Hilton Seattle on 6th Avenue, and we drove down there every

06:04.320 --> 06:10.040
day from the studio, and I don't think we ever got home until before 10 p.m. a single

06:10.040 --> 06:11.040
night.

06:11.040 --> 06:12.800
Most nights, I think it was after 11 p.m.

06:12.800 --> 06:15.640
They work hard.

06:15.640 --> 06:20.180
And this is sort of like the New York event I went to six months ago, but much smaller

06:20.180 --> 06:24.600
in scale, and in some ways more intense in its focus.

06:24.600 --> 06:29.840
So at the New York event, there was about, I don't know, 300 people there?

06:29.840 --> 06:32.780
There's probably about 50 people at this event.

06:32.780 --> 06:38.440
And I had a chance to talk with developers from Slack, Microsoft, Azure, Electron, the

06:38.440 --> 06:45.360
.NET project, the Skype project, TypeScript, PowerShell, a Visual Studio code developer,

06:45.360 --> 06:54.160
JetBrains employees, and someone who's responsible for some packaging tasks at Plex, which was

06:54.160 --> 06:56.040
a fascinating discussion.

06:56.040 --> 06:59.900
It is way more complex than I ever thought possible.

06:59.900 --> 07:06.480
And they were there from about 9 a.m. till about 6 p.m., and usually a little bit later

07:06.480 --> 07:07.720
every single day.

07:07.720 --> 07:12.200
Then they would break off after that and go into individual groups, and essentially just

07:12.200 --> 07:14.980
keep working, but at a lower pace.

07:14.980 --> 07:20.080
And even when the internet went out, they were so intent on getting work done that they

07:20.080 --> 07:27.440
leaned on the hotel staff to move them to an entirely different hotel, a competitor's

07:27.440 --> 07:32.940
hotel, so they could keep working with their internet connection.

07:32.940 --> 07:35.120
And every time we walked in the room, it was very hushed.

07:35.120 --> 07:36.120
Everybody was very serious.

07:36.120 --> 07:40.920
They had one secret room where I'm not allowed to repeat what I heard in there or record

07:40.920 --> 07:43.120
anything, so I didn't spend a lot of time in there.

07:43.120 --> 07:46.920
I just went in there to kind of get a general impression of what it was like and document

07:46.920 --> 07:52.240
it, but I didn't really, didn't end up camping out there like I thought I might because what's

07:52.240 --> 07:54.160
the point if I can't repeat anything I heard?

07:54.160 --> 07:57.920
So we pulled people aside and chatted with them, and the main thing that we really took

07:57.920 --> 08:02.200
away is Canonical has come up with a way to solve a problem for them.

08:02.200 --> 08:06.420
So when they're going to Skype or they're going to Slack or they're potentially one

08:06.420 --> 08:12.320
day going to Plex, they're solving something that maybe they have a staff of people and

08:12.320 --> 08:15.480
all of these hacked-together scripts to pull off.

08:15.480 --> 08:19.080
And so it's a real problem they're trying to solve, and the auto-update mechanism of

08:19.080 --> 08:23.280
Snaps is extremely appealing to some of these companies.

08:23.280 --> 08:28.360
What I witnessed was a Canonical advantage that I don't think Flatpaks or App Images

08:28.360 --> 08:33.760
will ever have, and that is the fact that there are administrative personnel in Canonical's

08:33.760 --> 08:39.880
offices who can call administrative personnel at Plex's office and Microsoft's office, and

08:39.880 --> 08:44.840
the administrative personnel can coordinate scheduling for resources below them, and then

08:44.840 --> 08:49.660
those companies send their resources to an agreed-upon location, and their resources

08:49.660 --> 08:52.240
do the work that they've been tasked to do.

08:52.240 --> 08:58.160
That's the one advantage I feel that a bureaucracy can bring to open-source development is that

08:58.160 --> 09:01.760
when it gets to the layer where it has to be business-to-business, they can facilitate

09:01.760 --> 09:03.200
that communication.

09:03.200 --> 09:05.600
They can tell them, hey, we have a problem to solve.

09:05.600 --> 09:12.140
They can afford to pay staff members to advocate something to Microsoft, to Slack, and they

09:12.140 --> 09:18.040
can afford to say pay them for a year to campaign Slack before it actually bears any fruit.

09:18.040 --> 09:20.880
I'm not trying to take away from Flatpaks or App Images.

09:20.880 --> 09:22.200
Those are great solutions.

09:22.200 --> 09:23.440
They have their markets.

09:23.440 --> 09:27.620
I'm just trying to illustrate where I think SNAPs might have a competitive advantage,

09:27.620 --> 09:31.400
and they're going to carve out a certain type of applications that perhaps the other packaging

09:31.400 --> 09:33.160
formats won't.

09:33.160 --> 09:37.600
It's interesting that the big headline for it really was this Skype SNAP.

09:37.600 --> 09:43.680
I think they had the release of that embargo, didn't they, until this summit, and also have

09:43.680 --> 09:49.940
had the Slack SNAP as well recently, but if you look on insights.abuntu.com at the posts

09:49.940 --> 09:57.640
about this event, they are filed under IoT rather than desktop, and that is where I thought

09:57.640 --> 10:01.880
they were really focusing the SNAP stuff, because that's where it's profitable on digital

10:01.880 --> 10:05.600
signage and edge devices, as Shotworth calls them.

10:05.600 --> 10:10.680
So I was quite surprised that there was such a heavy desktop focus at this event.

10:10.680 --> 10:11.680
That's a good observation.

10:11.680 --> 10:17.080
I wonder if it's filed under IoT on their website, because it's sort of from the Click

10:17.080 --> 10:20.720
Packages era, which was very much focused on IoT.

10:20.720 --> 10:27.040
Maybe, maybe, but I know a lot of SNAP stuff is for IoT, so maybe they've just got that

10:27.040 --> 10:30.600
sorted at this stage, and now they're moving into the desktop more.

10:30.600 --> 10:36.200
Well, or having a big name use your package formats, even if it's a desktop application,

10:36.200 --> 10:39.280
probably still gets your foot in the door when you're trying to talk to QNAP about how

10:39.280 --> 10:40.560
they ship their updates.

10:40.560 --> 10:41.920
Yeah, that's definitely true.

10:41.920 --> 10:45.520
If you've got a huge name like Skype on board, then that's got to help in those meetings,

10:45.520 --> 10:46.520
isn't it?

10:46.520 --> 10:50.880
The other thing that they're very cleverly doing is they're working with the tool builders

10:50.880 --> 10:56.280
at the tool level, so say, Electron Builder, or insert whatever application, maybe it's

10:56.280 --> 11:01.360
Known Builder, when the developer hits export, so in the case of Electron Builder, when they

11:01.360 --> 11:07.600
go to export a Windows, Mac, and Linux version of an Electron app, they now have an option

11:07.600 --> 11:12.800
when they put in one additional export command to also just export from Electron Builder

11:12.800 --> 11:14.280
right to a SNAP package.

11:14.280 --> 11:18.520
It's early days, but this is the level they're thinking at, is work at the tool levels, so

11:18.520 --> 11:22.320
that way when the developers are hitting their targets, it's just baked right in, they can

11:22.320 --> 11:23.320
export right to SNAP.

11:23.320 --> 11:27.540
I can't say I'm really surprised at these huge names coming on board with SNAP, because

11:27.540 --> 11:32.080
Shotworth has thrown a lot of investment behind it, not just with these events in New York

11:32.080 --> 11:38.340
and Seattle, but a lot of developer resources and community management stuff.

11:38.340 --> 11:42.760
They're all in on SNAPs at this point, and they have been for a while, and now it's starting

11:42.760 --> 11:47.160
to actually work and produce results for them.

11:47.160 --> 11:50.760
So the real question is, who's going to be next?

11:50.760 --> 11:54.280
I suspect more Microsoft stuff went on in that secret room.

11:54.280 --> 11:59.640
Joe, I think that's probably an accurate suspicion, and in fact, I wouldn't be surprised if that

11:59.640 --> 12:03.480
Skype SNAP has some improvements in the near term future that us Linux users are going

12:03.480 --> 12:08.560
to extremely appreciate, and it might just make it the de facto way most of us install

12:08.560 --> 12:13.400
Skype in the future.

12:13.400 --> 12:14.400
DigitalOcean.com.

12:14.400 --> 12:17.880
Go over there, create your account, and then use our promo code, here's the thing.

12:17.880 --> 12:22.040
It's all one word, smash it together, and get a promo code of $10.

12:22.040 --> 12:26.760
Then you can spin up a $5 dropletter with any of their other rigs and try it out for

12:26.760 --> 12:27.760
free.

12:27.760 --> 12:31.120
You get a $10 credit, no credit card required, it just goes right to your account, and you

12:31.120 --> 12:32.700
can spin up that $5 dropletter.

12:32.700 --> 12:34.740
Take a look at all of the different options.

12:34.740 --> 12:38.160
They have ready to deploy pre-built applications.

12:38.160 --> 12:40.880
You want to go give Nextcloud a try like we did a few weeks ago?

12:40.880 --> 12:43.640
You can deploy it all with a single click on DigitalOcean.

12:43.640 --> 12:49.400
Or you can build just a base system, everything's SSD backed, all of the systems have SSD drives,

12:49.400 --> 12:52.320
and now they have serious compute systems as well.

12:52.320 --> 12:57.520
They have new optimized compute workloads, they have high memory systems, expandable,

12:57.520 --> 13:02.560
easy to use storage, and they've just revamped their pricing so it's a better deal than ever.

13:02.560 --> 13:04.880
My favorite DigitalOcean droplet is just three cents an hour.

13:04.880 --> 13:11.280
You get four gigs of RAM, two virtual CPUs, and 80 gigabytes of SSD, beautiful fast storage.

13:11.280 --> 13:15.360
And DigitalOcean has built-in monitoring, network level firewalls so the dirty packets

13:15.360 --> 13:19.800
never even hit your machines, and so many great ready to go applications at a single

13:19.800 --> 13:20.800
click.

13:20.800 --> 13:25.880
And coming soon, new features like per second billing, and lots of other cool stuff.

13:25.880 --> 13:30.440
Predictable pay-as-you-go pricing, an elegant API, and a straightforward dashboard.

13:30.440 --> 13:36.600
With Xeon.com promo code, here's the thing.

13:36.600 --> 13:37.840
Quick catch up from last week.

13:37.840 --> 13:40.200
We talked about testing Plasma Mobile.

13:40.200 --> 13:46.680
Well part two of that series of blog posts has been posted now, and it's more about testing

13:46.680 --> 13:49.440
it on actual mobile hardware.

13:49.440 --> 13:54.840
The first one was about testing it on virtual machines and x86 machines, but now this is

13:54.840 --> 13:58.840
about how to actually get it on something that it should be running on.

13:58.840 --> 14:05.480
And there are a few ways to do it with post-market OS, and Hallium, and a couple of devices that

14:05.480 --> 14:08.480
they've got actual images pre-built for.

14:08.480 --> 14:12.840
So you've got no excuse now, you've got to try out Plasma Mobile and see how much potential

14:12.840 --> 14:13.840
it has.

14:13.840 --> 14:17.240
I love that they have an image for the Nexus 7 2013.

14:17.240 --> 14:18.720
I have a soft spot for that tablet.

14:18.720 --> 14:22.840
If I still had that around, that feels like it would be perfect size for Plasma Mobile.

14:22.840 --> 14:26.820
Yeah, if someone wanted to get into custom ROMs and stuff like that, that is the one

14:26.820 --> 14:30.400
device I would recommend, because there are just so many ROMs for it, and it's also a

14:30.400 --> 14:31.400
great tablet.

14:31.400 --> 14:35.240
Once you stick lineage on it, it's still, even though it's, what, five years old at

14:35.240 --> 14:37.760
this point, it's still a really great tablet.

14:37.760 --> 14:39.560
So yeah, you should get a hold of one.

14:39.560 --> 14:42.640
You could probably get one off Craigslist for like 50 bucks or something.

14:42.640 --> 14:45.880
Yeah, you know, it might almost be worth it with these kinds of things.

14:45.880 --> 14:51.360
I see there's another approach too, if you have the Nexus 5 or 5X, 5X is still a pretty

14:51.360 --> 14:54.660
decent phone too for these alternative images.

14:54.660 --> 14:59.160
It's the Helium-based approach, I believe, but if you've got a 5X, give that a shot

14:59.160 --> 15:00.160
too.

15:00.160 --> 15:04.000
Yeah, and you'll see how far Plasma Mobile has come along.

15:04.000 --> 15:07.360
As I said last week, it's not really yet, but it's certainly getting there.

15:07.360 --> 15:11.600
Well, speaking of getting there and updates, Purism has another update on their Road to

15:11.600 --> 15:17.280
the Librem 5, and they talk a little in this post about PureOS and GNOME and KDE support.

15:17.280 --> 15:19.880
Yeah, that PR train keeps on chugging, eh?

15:19.880 --> 15:21.400
We're talking about it once again.

15:21.400 --> 15:26.080
Yeah, this is probably the post I wish they hadn't made, because it was the red flag to

15:26.080 --> 15:29.640
me that is really sort of concerning.

15:29.640 --> 15:34.500
They expand more, Todd does in this post, Todd, the CEO of Purism.

15:34.500 --> 15:39.640
He expands more in this post about how they'll be integrating both GNOME and KDE.

15:39.640 --> 15:43.720
Of course, in his parlance, he says partnered, because that's how everybody phrases it, and

15:43.720 --> 15:49.460
he says that users that use PureOS on the Librem 5 will get a choice of the GNOME environment

15:49.460 --> 15:52.200
or the KDE Plasma environment.

15:52.200 --> 15:56.320
And of course, that doesn't mean just the option of GNOME or Plasma desktop on the Librem

15:56.320 --> 15:59.560
5 or whatever mobile versions they are at that point.

15:59.560 --> 16:03.760
It also means an entire stack of Qt and an entire stack of GTK.

16:03.760 --> 16:09.280
Now I have to agree with you, I think, on this one, because okay, choice is always good,

16:09.280 --> 16:12.880
and offering people those two choices on the surface of things seems great.

16:12.880 --> 16:17.080
Okay, well, I prefer Plasma Mobile, I prefer GNOME, whatever.

16:17.080 --> 16:22.200
But when this was funded, we talked about how the margins on this were very small.

16:22.200 --> 16:24.720
They don't have a lot of money in relative terms.

16:24.720 --> 16:29.240
They've only got a couple of million dollars to play with here, which is not much when

16:29.240 --> 16:32.040
you're developing an operating system from scratch.

16:32.040 --> 16:36.600
And for me, just pick something and stick with it.

16:36.600 --> 16:41.600
Don't have all these choices, because it's not just GNOME and KDE either.

16:41.600 --> 16:47.980
There's even talk of UbiPorts or Ubuntu Touch being available for it, which is surely a

16:47.980 --> 16:52.600
terrible idea to have three potential avenues to go down.

16:52.600 --> 16:55.520
You've just got to pick one and stick with it and make it really good.

16:55.520 --> 16:59.860
And once it comes out and is good and all the rest of it, facilitate people porting

16:59.860 --> 17:03.620
other stuff to it and make it so that you can install other things on it.

17:03.620 --> 17:05.520
And that's the whole point of it being free and open.

17:05.520 --> 17:07.000
Yeah, this is a red flag.

17:07.000 --> 17:12.440
And it does concern me, because if they blow this, the dream may die with them.

17:12.440 --> 17:14.480
No one's really going to take this seriously.

17:14.480 --> 17:18.680
And the red flags are very obvious at this point.

17:18.680 --> 17:24.320
In my mind, this may actually just spell the doom of the project, because it betrays a

17:24.320 --> 17:26.280
problem with Todd himself, I believe.

17:26.280 --> 17:29.200
You see, I think Todd Weaver can't see past his own vision.

17:29.200 --> 17:35.000
And he believes that he can bridge the gap between his incredible PureOS that a few thousand

17:35.000 --> 17:38.520
people are using to the mobile operating system.

17:38.520 --> 17:42.240
And so when they talk about it in this post, they talk about their investment in GNOME

17:42.240 --> 17:46.720
so far and that user base and how that user base is going to be able to run their applications

17:46.720 --> 17:47.720
on their phone.

17:47.720 --> 17:49.900
That user base doesn't matter.

17:49.900 --> 17:54.600
If you have less than 300,000 active users on your distribution, you're not even in the

17:54.600 --> 17:55.600
top 10.

17:55.600 --> 17:57.320
You're maybe, maybe, maybe in the top 10.

17:57.320 --> 17:59.060
You're definitely not in the top five.

17:59.060 --> 18:04.640
So this precious investment of yours is meaningless.

18:04.640 --> 18:08.200
Those users will mean nothing if the Librem 5 is successful.

18:08.200 --> 18:13.100
But you are strapping an anchor to the Librem 5 because of this vision of yours and this

18:13.100 --> 18:17.820
investment that you've made in your PureOS GNOME users.

18:17.820 --> 18:22.840
Which don't make any sense, because the fundamental issue with the phone is that it is not a desktop.

18:22.840 --> 18:28.100
It's not an x86 computer with 512 gigs of storage and 32 gigabytes of RAM.

18:28.100 --> 18:30.560
It is a confined, limited environment.

18:30.560 --> 18:35.560
And the issue with offering both a plasma stack and a GNOME stack on your phone is that

18:35.560 --> 18:37.560
you muddy the story for developers.

18:37.560 --> 18:39.740
They need it really clear and simple.

18:39.740 --> 18:42.780
They need, this is how you write the application.

18:42.780 --> 18:44.320
This is the toolkit you use.

18:44.320 --> 18:46.160
These are the pre-made widgets that you use.

18:46.160 --> 18:48.440
This is how you package that application.

18:48.440 --> 18:51.760
This is where you ship the application to the end users.

18:51.760 --> 18:55.300
We have living proof of this in elementary OS.

18:55.300 --> 19:00.840
They're not the largest distribution in the pond, and yet they've seen over 70 new applications

19:00.840 --> 19:05.440
submitted to their little app center this year alone because they have a great story

19:05.440 --> 19:06.440
for developers.

19:06.440 --> 19:09.400
They have widgets and toolkits that are clear and easy to use.

19:09.400 --> 19:11.120
They have good documentation.

19:11.120 --> 19:12.520
It's a singular story.

19:12.520 --> 19:16.820
They're not telling them to write cute apps and GTK apps and use their own custom compositor

19:16.820 --> 19:19.480
or use something that was built by the KWIN project.

19:19.480 --> 19:21.240
And that's just issue number one.

19:21.240 --> 19:24.720
Issue number two is you already have a snowball's chance in hell of this thing being successful

19:24.720 --> 19:26.320
to begin with.

19:26.320 --> 19:28.120
Everybody knows that.

19:28.120 --> 19:32.480
And so the more you split your attention, your company's focus, and your developer's

19:32.480 --> 19:36.480
focus, the more technical debt that you're taking on, the closer and closer you inch

19:36.480 --> 19:38.320
the project to doom.

19:38.320 --> 19:42.640
And fundamentally, another issue is, is the GNOME developers aren't all that interested

19:42.640 --> 19:43.640
upstream.

19:43.640 --> 19:46.920
The Plasma mobile developers have been interested for years, and they're shipping it, as we

19:46.920 --> 19:49.760
just explained, on physical hardware right now for testing.

19:49.760 --> 19:52.080
The GNOME developers have kind of given up on mobile.

19:52.080 --> 19:55.700
They're not all that interested, and they have fundamental technical issues with the

19:55.700 --> 20:01.600
way GNOME Shell's built that you would have to overcome to make it work on your phone.

20:01.600 --> 20:03.400
And that's just right here off the top of my head.

20:03.400 --> 20:08.200
Well, overcoming those issues by maybe writing your own Wayland compositor, which Purism

20:08.200 --> 20:09.600
are now talking about.

20:09.600 --> 20:10.600
Yes.

20:10.600 --> 20:12.240
It just seems madness to me, that.

20:12.240 --> 20:15.440
Yeah, it's really unfortunate, because they're going to kill the dream here.

20:15.440 --> 20:19.360
Or they're going to create a meme that the open source community can never ship a mobile

20:19.360 --> 20:20.680
operating system.

20:20.680 --> 20:24.160
And what's frustrating is it feels like Todd, and this is why I say Todd Weaver can't see

20:24.160 --> 20:28.400
past his own vision here, is he hasn't taken any lessons from any of the previous open

20:28.400 --> 20:30.880
source projects that have taken a shot at this.

20:30.880 --> 20:37.280
It's like free R&D at his company, and he's just ignoring all this R&D research for years

20:37.280 --> 20:38.280
at his company.

20:38.280 --> 20:47.320
Symbian, Open Moco, Maemo, Neo 9000, Moblin, Limo, Bada, WebOS, Luna OS, MeeGo, Tizen,

20:47.320 --> 20:52.560
Nemo Mobile, Sailfish OS, Asteroid, Yala, Zipper, Ubuntu Touch, KDE Plasma Mobile, Gnome

20:52.560 --> 20:55.960
for Mobile, Replicant, Cyanogen Mod, Firefox OS.

20:55.960 --> 20:57.280
I could go on and on.

20:57.280 --> 21:01.820
These are all projects that have failed to reach mass adoption, and some of them have

21:01.820 --> 21:05.840
failed completely, and most of them actually have failed completely outright, because they

21:05.840 --> 21:07.880
couldn't see past their own visions.

21:07.880 --> 21:12.760
You know, this whole project was about producing a phone that runs completely free software

21:12.760 --> 21:15.400
and doesn't require blobs to run, right?

21:15.400 --> 21:18.760
And they seem to have the hardware sorted on that, and they're doing some testing and

21:18.760 --> 21:20.680
stuff, so that's all well and good, I think.

21:20.680 --> 21:25.640
That's not that difficult once you get the system on a chip sorted.

21:25.640 --> 21:32.840
And so it occurs to me, why don't they just take Lineage and use that and bundle F-Droid

21:32.840 --> 21:33.840
with it?

21:33.840 --> 21:34.840
Right.

21:34.840 --> 21:39.920
And then you've got a completely blob-less Lineage phone, which would solve the problem.

21:39.920 --> 21:44.360
No, I think within the company, there's people who are anti-Android, and more power to them,

21:44.360 --> 21:45.360
that's all good.

21:45.360 --> 21:47.100
That is what their customer base will do.

21:47.100 --> 21:51.080
If they still manage to actually ship the hardware, nobody's going to buy that phone

21:51.080 --> 21:53.200
and want to run some half-breed OS.

21:53.200 --> 21:56.960
They're just going to reflash it to a usable operating system designed for mobile, and

21:56.960 --> 22:00.180
then they probably won't get to take advantage of their physical kill switches, because Android

22:00.180 --> 22:04.320
hasn't been built to just lose its baseband and its Wi-Fi chipset all of a sudden.

22:04.320 --> 22:08.200
So that'll probably be something that only PureOS can do that most of the customer base

22:08.200 --> 22:11.120
likely won't take advantage of, because they won't be running it.

22:11.120 --> 22:15.520
Yeah, well, I was speaking to a developer from UbiPorts about it, and he said to me

22:15.520 --> 22:21.800
that it's not as easy as you'd think, just because GNU slash Linux will run on it.

22:21.800 --> 22:23.720
It doesn't necessarily mean that Android will.

22:23.720 --> 22:29.360
And I made the point to him, well, yeah, but porting Android to it is surely easier and

22:29.360 --> 22:33.360
cheaper than writing an entire operating system from scratch, which is what they're looking

22:33.360 --> 22:34.360
to do.

22:34.360 --> 22:35.360
Yeah.

22:35.360 --> 22:39.800
And I can see this anti-Android stuff, but there's no reason to be anti-Android if you

22:39.800 --> 22:43.960
run in lineage, which is totally free software, apart from the blobs that you normally need,

22:43.960 --> 22:45.480
which you won't need in this case.

22:45.480 --> 22:52.120
So there's no reason why you couldn't have a totally free replicant-style Android distribution.

22:52.120 --> 22:56.420
I think it's about getting the blessing of the Free Software Foundation, quite honestly.

22:56.420 --> 22:59.040
That I think they hope to be their competitive advantage of this phone.

22:59.040 --> 23:01.840
Yeah, but isn't replicant blessed by the FSF?

23:01.840 --> 23:02.840
Oh, I guess.

23:02.840 --> 23:03.840
I think it is.

23:03.840 --> 23:04.840
Yeah, I think they could do replicant.

23:04.840 --> 23:05.840
Yeah.

23:05.840 --> 23:06.840
I think they could do replicant.

23:06.840 --> 23:07.840
Well, there you go.

23:07.840 --> 23:08.840
Yeah.

23:08.840 --> 23:11.400
I don't mean to not seem past the vision here.

23:11.400 --> 23:15.680
To me, the idea that they're going to ship Plasma and Gnome, and that they're going to

23:15.680 --> 23:19.020
invest equally in both of them and bring Gnome...

23:19.020 --> 23:23.120
Even getting Gnome to where Plasma Mobile now is, is probably more work than somebody

23:23.120 --> 23:25.800
who's also trying to build a phone at the same time should take on.

23:25.800 --> 23:26.800
Yeah.

23:26.800 --> 23:31.280
The fact that they can't see this is going to be noticed by the community.

23:31.280 --> 23:35.820
Their average customer is a little more savvy than the person that's walking into a mobile

23:35.820 --> 23:38.260
store and getting an Android phone for free.

23:38.260 --> 23:41.000
We will see these red flags.

23:41.000 --> 23:43.160
This will not go unnoticed.

23:43.160 --> 23:44.160
I don't know, man.

23:44.160 --> 23:49.440
I think that a lot of the people who have backed this and spent their money, they've

23:49.440 --> 23:55.400
got so much hope in this that maybe they will see past these red flags and hope will keep

23:55.400 --> 23:57.000
burning inside.

23:57.000 --> 24:00.340
That is why I'm worried they're going to kill a certain kind of dream when this thing blows

24:00.340 --> 24:01.340
up in their face.

24:01.340 --> 24:05.200
Well, we'll still have UbiPorts after that, and I think that they've got some big things

24:05.200 --> 24:09.920
happening this year with the Unbox stuff and Android app support.

24:09.920 --> 24:15.700
I think that if they can get their marketing together and get the technical details of

24:15.700 --> 24:22.640
it all worked out, I think that UbiPorts is going to be really one to watch and potentially

24:22.640 --> 24:25.560
will end up on this Purism phone.

24:25.560 --> 24:30.080
They might just have to, if they want to ship it in early 2019, then they might just have

24:30.080 --> 24:33.800
to abandon what they're doing and just stick UbiPorts on it.

24:33.800 --> 24:37.200
Well I hope one feature that remains is calls being placed over Matrix.

24:37.200 --> 24:38.200
I love Matrix.

24:38.200 --> 24:40.680
I like to think of it as communications infrastructure.

24:40.680 --> 24:43.080
Yeah, well, it's looking pretty good for them.

24:43.080 --> 24:46.960
They've had an investment of $5 million this week from Status.

24:46.960 --> 24:49.600
An Ethereum-based company, right?

24:49.600 --> 24:55.040
Isn't Stasis, aren't they like an Ethereum-based platform with chat and all that kind of...

24:55.040 --> 24:56.040
I don't know.

24:56.040 --> 24:57.040
I didn't see this coming, I guess.

24:57.040 --> 25:01.920
Yeah, it seems like they'd be almost a competitor really, but well, Matrix is free software.

25:01.920 --> 25:03.540
It's getting a lot of money thrown at it.

25:03.540 --> 25:04.800
That's got to be good news, isn't it?

25:04.800 --> 25:08.400
Yeah, in fact, one of the things they plan to do, they hope to do in the future, is build

25:08.400 --> 25:14.280
a bridge from Matrix to the Status Ethereum chat system.

25:14.280 --> 25:16.040
So that kind of makes sense.

25:16.040 --> 25:20.340
And Status at the same time also invested in Rocket.im on the same day.

25:20.340 --> 25:21.340
Same amount of money.

25:21.340 --> 25:23.880
And Rocket.im rides on top of Matrix.

25:23.880 --> 25:25.520
It's sort of like a Slack competitor.

25:25.520 --> 25:32.520
And so Status.im has invested in both Matrix and the most popular front end, Rocket.im.

25:32.520 --> 25:37.760
Yeah, that blockchain VC money is going to a good home here, at least.

25:37.760 --> 25:42.360
Speaking of crypto funds going to a good home, the Free Software Foundation just got a big

25:42.360 --> 25:43.360
Bitcoin donation.

25:43.360 --> 25:47.680
Yeah, which was a million dollars worth, but now it's probably worth about 50 cents or

25:47.680 --> 25:48.680
something.

25:48.680 --> 25:49.680
It hurts.

25:49.680 --> 25:52.120
It hurts, Joe.

25:52.120 --> 25:57.920
As we record right now, Bitcoin has just broken below $8,000.

25:57.920 --> 26:00.680
It's down $1,000 today.

26:00.680 --> 26:03.000
It's at $7,983.

26:03.000 --> 26:09.320
Now I always base my floors on what I feel like the gut of the Bitcoin community is.

26:09.320 --> 26:14.040
And I told you, I think two days ago, I feel like the floor is 7,000 cold.

26:14.040 --> 26:15.600
We'll see if I'm right about that.

26:15.600 --> 26:17.720
I do have a theory on what's going on now.

26:17.720 --> 26:19.960
Like I've sat back and watched it for a little bit.

26:19.960 --> 26:27.000
And I think what we're seeing is the result of a pump and dump in altcoins.

26:27.000 --> 26:32.120
People were using altcoins to buy Bitcoin and back and forth, and that fizzled out.

26:32.120 --> 26:34.800
And now you're seeing a collapse in the Bitcoin price.

26:34.800 --> 26:40.080
Now this is, as of right now, I think it's like around a 65% correction from the last

26:40.080 --> 26:41.080
three months.

26:41.080 --> 26:42.800
So it's gone up like 500%.

26:42.800 --> 26:45.640
And now we're seeing a 65% correction.

26:45.640 --> 26:51.000
So we're about at mid to early November prices right now.

26:51.000 --> 26:54.120
Yeah, I've given up on trying to predict where it's going to go.

26:54.120 --> 26:59.160
I just watch it, and my few hundred quid's worth goes up and down.

26:59.160 --> 27:02.160
And I just have to be zen about it, really.

27:02.160 --> 27:04.360
I've never invested too much in it.

27:04.360 --> 27:10.360
But I wonder to what extent, because it's not just Bitcoin that's crashing and tanking,

27:10.360 --> 27:14.560
it's the other cryptocurrencies, the altcoins, as you say.

27:14.560 --> 27:21.280
And I wonder to what extent that is driven not by this stuff in India and Facebook banning

27:21.280 --> 27:23.480
adverts for cryptocurrencies.

27:23.480 --> 27:26.480
I wonder how much of it is being driven by deep fakes.

27:26.480 --> 27:32.200
Because there's a lot of people, a lot of nerdy people, who probably were mining altcoins

27:32.200 --> 27:37.520
before, who are now using their graphics cards to make these deep fakes, which are not necessarily

27:37.520 --> 27:38.520
celebrity things.

27:38.520 --> 27:42.800
Some of them are just fun things like Nicolas Cage or whatever.

27:42.800 --> 27:46.600
The cryptocurrencies were something that a lot of people like you got into just for the

27:46.600 --> 27:47.600
fun of it, wasn't it?

27:47.600 --> 27:48.640
Just for something to do.

27:48.640 --> 27:50.040
You had the hardware, so why not?

27:50.040 --> 27:52.160
And now people are starting to do these.

27:52.160 --> 27:56.600
I don't think that that has massively affected the price of Bitcoin, but it's interesting

27:56.600 --> 28:01.100
to think about that maybe people are starting to move on to other things that need powerful

28:01.100 --> 28:02.100
graphics cards.

28:02.100 --> 28:07.360
Yeah, I also think people are moving on to some altcoins that are more approachable by

28:07.360 --> 28:09.400
people with more common hardware.

28:09.400 --> 28:11.180
And that could be playing a bit of a role.

28:11.180 --> 28:15.600
It's usually several things that really cause large price manipulations, including people

28:15.600 --> 28:18.400
intentionally manipulating the price at the same time.

28:18.400 --> 28:22.280
So here's how I put the whole cryptocurrency market into perspective is I look at their

28:22.280 --> 28:25.600
market caps, and it's kind of astonishing, really.

28:25.600 --> 28:29.800
It starts out pretty strong, Bitcoin's way up there, then Ethereum comes in as like the

28:29.800 --> 28:33.340
number two with the largest market cap.

28:33.340 --> 28:38.760
And right now, Ethereum is $800 around there, it's around $813 for Ethereum.

28:38.760 --> 28:43.560
Number three in market cap is Ripple, and it's worth 80 cents right now.

28:43.560 --> 28:46.520
You go from $800 to 80 cents.

28:46.520 --> 28:50.320
Now there's other outliers in there like NEO and Bitcoin Cash and a few others.

28:50.320 --> 28:55.520
But it's really only the two top cryptocurrencies that are really worth anything in terms of

28:55.520 --> 28:57.240
the coin dollar.

28:57.240 --> 28:59.160
After that, it drops off dramatic.

28:59.160 --> 29:02.800
Now there's still like millions of dollars of market value in some of these coins.

29:02.800 --> 29:06.080
But they're being used at lower levels as more like back end currencies.

29:06.080 --> 29:09.120
Yeah, it's interesting times, but we were supposed to be talking about the Free Software

29:09.120 --> 29:10.120
Foundation.

29:10.120 --> 29:11.120
Right.

29:11.120 --> 29:12.960
And it's good to see that they've got this injection.

29:12.960 --> 29:19.080
I don't know if they sold it or whether they're holding because it could end up being worth

29:19.080 --> 29:24.240
a lot more for them, potentially, if they do hold and leave it a year or so.

29:24.240 --> 29:27.480
If my original prediction was right, that it's going to be worth 100,000.

29:27.480 --> 29:31.120
That's looking very unlikely at this point, but you never know.

29:31.120 --> 29:32.520
Yeah, that would be quite the rally.

29:32.520 --> 29:38.280
Now they say that this is a record breaking charitable contribution of 91.45 Bitcoins

29:38.280 --> 29:41.560
from the Pineapple Fund, which at the time, like Joe said, was a million.

29:41.560 --> 29:42.560
I don't know.

29:42.560 --> 29:44.360
I can't really say what they did with it.

29:44.360 --> 29:45.680
But they feel vindicated, I think.

29:45.680 --> 29:50.760
In this post, I think they see this as a real testament to the importance of the Free Software

29:50.760 --> 29:52.840
Foundation and free software in general.

29:52.840 --> 29:56.240
And they say they're honored to receive this generous donation from the Pineapple Fund.

29:56.240 --> 29:57.240
That's pretty awesome.

29:57.240 --> 30:00.600
Yeah, because the Pineapple Fund has donated to a lot of really good causes.

30:00.600 --> 30:04.880
So it's good to see that free software is part of it because after all, Bitcoin itself

30:04.880 --> 30:06.040
is free software, isn't it?

30:06.040 --> 30:08.520
So it's kind of it feels fitting.

30:08.520 --> 30:12.240
Well, there's always a lot happening every single week in the world of open source and
