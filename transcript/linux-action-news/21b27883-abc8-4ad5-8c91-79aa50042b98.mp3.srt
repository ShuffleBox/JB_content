00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,600
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, our weekly take on Linux and the open source world.

2
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:21,240
This is episode 85 recorded on December 21st, 2018.

3
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:22,240
I'm Chris.

4
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:23,240
And I'm Joe.

5
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:24,240
Hello, Joe.

6
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:29,840
It's good to be connected with you because today is an episode of the most definitive

7
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:33,080
series, like the things that defined 2018.

8
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:38,120
And if there was one person, one man I could choose to talk to about this, it would be

9
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:39,340
you, Joe.

10
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:43,000
And I think we've got to start with Red Hat.

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
What do you say?

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Yeah.

13
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,120
The news that absolutely dominated at least the second half of the year was that IBM was

14
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:49,120
going to buy Red Hat.

15
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:51,880
It sent shockwaves through the whole open source community.

16
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:54,360
I'm still feeling those shockwaves.

17
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:59,280
Yeah, not only that, but really, if you think about it, let's back up a little bit.

18
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:05,240
I mean, the year starts really with Red Hat announcing they're acquiring Core OS.

19
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:13,520
In January 2018, Red Hat announced for a mere $250 million, they would be purchasing one

20
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:18,840
of the most surprising and exciting upcoming Linux distributions, Core OS.

21
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:21,960
And then the rest of 2018 was really, how are they going to integrate them?

22
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:26,320
Yeah, well, it wasn't until June that we found out exactly what was happening with Core OS.

23
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:30,880
And that was when they announced Fedora Core OS, which amused quite a few of us harking

24
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:33,920
back to the old Fedora Core name.

25
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:36,320
That was my favorite part of the whole thing.

26
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:41,480
Although with the other things that have happened with Red Hat this year, it's sort of just

27
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:45,080
been put on stasis.

28
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:48,120
We haven't really seen a lot develop there.

29
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:51,840
But that doesn't mean that things from that general area have settled down.

30
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:57,280
In fact, this year, Red Hat managed to hit 1.0 on Red Hat Stratus, which is a storage

31
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:00,480
project that I've been following with a lot of interest.

32
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:02,500
It does look very, very interesting, doesn't it?

33
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:09,200
This is their bet against ZFS because they, unlike Canonical, don't seem to think that

34
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:11,020
they can ship ZFS.

35
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:12,560
So they need an alternative.

36
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:15,040
And it does look like a really well thought out project.

37
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:19,040
We did a special on it recently on Linux Unplugged.

38
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:25,360
However, just in this last month, the ZFS leadership, or ZFS leadership, has decided

39
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:29,720
to rebase a lot of the different projects on ZFS for Linux.

40
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:36,280
So the ZFS on Linux that is shipping will be the authoritative version of ZFS.

41
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:40,120
So Red Hat Stratus has more competition.

42
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:42,640
But the licensing issue hasn't gone away.

43
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:47,440
Canonical seem to be doing fine with it and have got away with it, for want of a better

44
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:51,760
deal, but Red Hat just don't want to go down that route.

45
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:56,480
And I think that ultimately we're all going to benefit from that because if you've got

46
00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:01,520
two competing projects, and okay, Stratus is a long way off, it's certainly a long way

47
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:06,740
behind ZFS, but with the resources that Red Hat have got, especially now that they've

48
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:12,560
got the IBM money as well, maybe it won't be too long, maybe a year or two before we've

49
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:17,080
got something that is approaching ZFS in terms of features.

50
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:21,320
And that will hopefully foster good competition and drive them both forward.

51
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:22,320
Hmm.

52
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:23,320
I do like that.

53
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:24,400
That is what I hope as well.

54
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:28,380
And I wouldn't count Project Stratus out too from just a competitive standpoint because

55
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:32,840
they're really basing it off of a bunch of comprehensive existing technologies baked

56
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:37,120
into Linux and then bringing it all together with a comprehensive API.

57
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:40,080
And the industry tends to respond really well to that.

58
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:43,760
So Stratus has a huge potential in the marketplace.

59
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:47,840
But in the meantime, ZFS isn't standing still.

60
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:50,160
And I think that's probably good for everybody, right?

61
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:53,820
I mean, it's really good to have competition in this area.

62
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:57,720
So we've had a little while for the dust to settle on this announcement.

63
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:02,640
And I remember at the time not being as worried as a lot of people.

64
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:06,880
And I don't think that my opinion has changed over the last few months.

65
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:07,880
How do you feel about it?

66
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:09,800
Do you think that your attitude has changed?

67
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:15,680
I have not yet really gotten enough data to make a new decision.

68
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:21,440
I have, however, heard from a considerable amount of Red Hat employees.

69
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:24,280
And they seem to be doing better with the news.

70
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:25,800
This has been my data point, really.

71
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:32,160
It has been, I would say, the day that you and I recorded the Linux action news that

72
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:37,080
the IBM acquisition of Red Hat was announced, we recorded that.

73
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:43,280
A little behind-the-scenes information for people is, Joe and I sometimes sit around

74
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:48,760
and just shoot the shit for like an hour before we record.

75
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:53,580
And because we did that, we happened to delay the recording just enough for the news to

76
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:56,760
break on a Sunday, which never happens.

77
00:04:56,760 --> 00:05:00,940
That's why we record Linux action news on a Sunday, because there's no news on a Sunday.

78
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:04,880
So you can summarize everything and get it out before the news cycle begins again.

79
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:09,920
That's great, except IBM threw that whole thing off when they announced the acquisition

80
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:11,960
of Red Hat.

81
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:17,300
And while we were recording that episode, I must have heard from a dozen different Red

82
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:21,560
Hat employees that were sending me messages, and they were freaking out.

83
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:25,180
They were beside themselves.

84
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:33,580
And then Monday, there was an all-staff meeting, which I had an opportunity to see.

85
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:39,340
And the sentiment was mostly the same, that we're really doomed here.

86
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:44,960
And then as time has gone on, a new mantra seems to have developed amongst the Red Hat

87
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:45,960
crew.

88
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:51,320
And it is one that is, maybe we can impart our culture upon IBM.

89
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:56,320
Maybe IBM will be receptive, so that way they can stay competitive in the new marketplace.

90
00:05:56,320 --> 00:06:01,960
Maybe this is the perfect time for this acquisition, because we can impart something on IBM.

91
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:05,560
I don't know if that's actually possible.

92
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:12,400
So I, as an independent observer, remain a little skeptical of this entire acquisition.

93
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:16,900
But I can tell you from the people that I've been communicating with, they have transitioned

94
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:20,300
from freaking out to, there's some potential here.

95
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:22,960
The people inside think there's potential.

96
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,120
And that gives me some hope.

97
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:27,200
Well, I've been positive from the start, and I haven't changed.

98
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:33,120
I haven't seen any evidence that things have got worse, or are going to get worse.

99
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:40,000
And it just means a load more money going into open source, $34 billion going into open

100
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
source effectively.

101
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,320
And I don't see how that can be a bad thing.

102
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:53,320
Okay, Red Hat are not sort of free software, and they're not doing it for ideological reasons.

103
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:54,320
They are very pragmatic.

104
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:58,960
They are a company who believes that open source is the best way to do things.

105
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:03,080
And open source software is free software effectively.

106
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:09,440
So basically, no one can complain, even if they do some pragmatic stuff like Fedora made

107
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:13,000
it much easier to install proprietary drivers and things this year.

108
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,800
But who cares?

109
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:18,600
The underlying OS is still open source free software.

110
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:22,400
And if you've got all that extra money going into it, it's got to be good.

111
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:25,160
It's GPL code at the end of the day.

112
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:27,760
And I have a couple of canaries in the coal mine.

113
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:32,040
And the number one canary in the coal mine that I have, amongst my whole collection at

114
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:34,980
this point, really, is Jim Whitehurst.

115
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:41,320
If something happens to Jim, if he leaves, anything like that, that's the number one

116
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:45,400
dead canary in the coal mine signal that something is wrong.

117
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:51,620
And if he if he remains on board, and he continues to be public and communicate and tweet about

118
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:56,360
what's going on and all those things, I think that's a sign that things are going well.

119
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:58,040
And it's only one of many signs.

120
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:59,040
It's not the only sign.

121
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:00,160
I'm not saying that.

122
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:02,440
But it is a good signal out of them.

123
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:04,880
And so far, that's remained a pretty strong signal.

124
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:09,040
Yeah, I think you're right that that would be a big red flag, but I don't think it's

125
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,040
going to happen.

126
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:13,160
I think if anything, it's going to go the other way and he's going to end up more senior

127
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:16,720
at IBM and changing the culture over there.

128
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:17,960
Yeah, I hope so.

129
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:19,520
That's what the Red Hat employees hope.

130
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:20,520
Yeah.

131
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:23,920
And when I was going through the year's worth of news to collate all of this, one thing

132
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:29,440
kept jumping out at me one word kept jumping out at me over and over again, in so many

133
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:32,600
stories and that word was Microsoft.

134
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:33,880
No surprise there.

135
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:37,720
It's just been a huge year for them in the Linux and open source world, which is such

136
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:39,460
a weird thing, isn't it?

137
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:46,800
How can Microsoft this old enemy be so relevant to Linux and open source now?

138
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:51,520
You've seen just such a huge shift there, and I think that apart from IBM buying Red

139
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:55,840
Hat, the second biggest news story of the year was Microsoft buying GitHub.

140
00:08:55,840 --> 00:09:01,160
Well, is it GitHub or is it Microsoft joining the open invention network?

141
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:02,160
I'm not sure.

142
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,160
It's probably GitHub.

143
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:04,160
Yeah, it's probably GitHub.

144
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:05,160
Yeah, man.

145
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:13,560
Git and all of the other things, them dropping Edge HTML for Chromium, all of this has just

146
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:20,600
been almost at least every other week, almost to the to like the date, there is some major

147
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:22,040
Microsoft news.

148
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:26,120
Even this week, there is big Microsoft news that we're just not covering because of the

149
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:29,480
nature of this episode.

150
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:37,160
And I got to say, the last two years have been a process of me realizing that I was

151
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:44,000
a child, and then I'm no longer a child, and that I had childish things that I thought

152
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,560
were important that were not important.

153
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:55,360
And it's been a little humbling, to be honest with you, because in the 90s and in early

154
00:09:55,360 --> 00:10:02,360
2000s, I built my whole career around fighting Microsoft, about building and providing better

155
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:07,480
solutions than what you could accomplish on Windows.

156
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:13,840
And back then, I was the only jackass saying you could do things with Apache and MySQL.

157
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:17,680
You didn't need IIS and Microsoft SQL or Oracle.

158
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:22,880
I was the jackass that was saying, why not host these files on a Samba server using

159
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:25,880
XFS instead of a Windows server using NTFS?

160
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:29,820
I was that guy, which is now the norm.

161
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:30,960
Everybody says that now.

162
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:32,480
It's the normal thing to recommend.

163
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:40,440
But back then, to me, it was a religious battle, and I was fighting the good fight to defend

164
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:46,640
Linux's honor against an onslaught of FUD by the Microsoft Corporation.

165
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:50,000
And now I look back at that and I think, what was all of that about?

166
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,600
What did I accomplish?

167
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:59,800
Maybe you could say that all of us put in a good fight, and now Microsoft has been forced

168
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:05,560
to do things the open source way, but I'm not sure that's actually the case.

169
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:09,160
This year and last year have been really humbling for me.

170
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:12,240
I think you should start a new podcast called The Linux Hipster.

171
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:16,280
I was into Linux before anyone else was.

172
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:18,400
I was into Linux before it was cool.

173
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:23,320
I was into Linux before you could run it in a VPS.

174
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:30,760
But isn't it true that Microsoft really have changed and that the Microsoft under the Balmer

175
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:36,720
years is different from the Microsoft under Nadella?

176
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:43,800
I would have said no until I went down there, and I was invited down there for Coder Radio

177
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:49,760
to chat a little about what they're doing with.NET Core, which I now appreciate in

178
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:50,960
a much different scale.

179
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:57,240
But back then, it was really just about Microsoft open sourcing.NET Core, which now is one

180
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:59,900
of many, many, many, many things they've open sourced.

181
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:03,160
But back then, it was just that.

182
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:09,240
I was trying to figure it out, because just for the audience, I've grown up, lived in

183
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:10,960
the Pacific Northwest.

184
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:13,440
Microsoft has been in my backyard my entire life.

185
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:16,120
I have done contract work for Microsoft.

186
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:18,000
I have done intern work for Microsoft.

187
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,440
I have turned down multiple jobs for Microsoft.

188
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:26,880
I've had many family members that work at Microsoft, more than a few, and also friends

189
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:27,880
that work at Microsoft.

190
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:33,600
So over the years, at least a dozen times a year, I'm down there at the campus, just

191
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,000
down there for lunch even.

192
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:41,020
And so I followed them very closely since they became a company.

193
00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:45,280
And I really hated them for the longest time.

194
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:54,260
But I really have to say, later on, as really Balmer left and things changed, I got a greater

195
00:12:54,260 --> 00:12:59,920
appreciation through different interactions that I had opportunities to have that things

196
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:01,420
were really changing.

197
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:07,120
And I think the number one signal to me about this is a real change, not just a PR change,

198
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:13,680
not just a Twitter message, but the real signal to me was that they were firing people.

199
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:20,480
They were firing people that were longtime Microsoft veterans that were blocking this

200
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,400
transition.

201
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:27,640
And they were bringing in new people, like somebody I met in the.NET Core team, Joey.

202
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:30,880
Joey, he's probably a listener of this show.

203
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:33,840
He was a college student that ran Gen 2.

204
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:40,440
And they brought him on to replace a 25-year Windows veteran, because that Windows veteran

205
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:46,640
couldn't see things in the new paradigm, the new lens in which Microsoft looked at the

206
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:47,640
market.

207
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:51,280
But Joey, a college student Gen 2 user, could.

208
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:55,640
Well one thing that I think we have to keep in mind here is that Microsoft is a large

209
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:58,080
company that makes a lot of money.

210
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:04,100
And OK, right now, they're focused on Linux and open source, because that is a good revenue

211
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:05,680
stream for them.

212
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:09,600
But that doesn't necessarily mean that they're going to be like that forever.

213
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:12,960
So I think we have to treat this with some caution.

214
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:17,100
But at the same time, I don't think that they should necessarily be judged as a company

215
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:19,440
on their previous actions.

216
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:22,040
I think we should judge each action as it comes.

217
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:25,400
And them buying GitHub is a huge deal.

218
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:28,680
And we have to watch to see what happens with that.

219
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:32,600
And them joining the open invention network is clearly good.

220
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:36,280
They've contributed all these patents for people to use.

221
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:38,080
But I think we do have to keep an eye on them.

222
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:41,640
They do have that bad history of Linux as a cancer and everything.

223
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:45,560
And that might have been under a different regime, but it's still the same company.

224
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:52,200
So I think just cautious optimism is the best approach when it comes to Microsoft and Linux.

225
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:58,200
I would say I agree, only if you were willing to apply that same cautious optimism to every

226
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:04,400
commercial company that is currently making revenue from open source services.

227
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:08,280
2019 is really the year of services.

228
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:11,400
Apple is going to try to make all of their money from services.

229
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:16,240
All of the companies are, even the companies that were hardware based for the last 30 years

230
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:19,000
are going to try to make their money off of services.

231
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:25,000
And the thing is, that's something that Microsoft has wanted for a very, very, very long time.

232
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,360
Microsoft has been begging the market to go to services.

233
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:31,200
And so they're totally ready for this.

234
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:33,600
They're totally fired up and ready to go.

235
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:37,760
And I think this is a trend that's probably going to last 10 years.

236
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:46,720
So I agree, we have to remain vigilant, but we have to remain vigilant for all commercial

237
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:51,040
companies that are contributing to free software.

238
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:55,720
Because they're all contributing to further their own interests.

239
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:58,040
Microsoft is just one of the larger ones now.

240
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:59,160
Oh, yeah, definitely.

241
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:04,120
We should keep an eye on all of those companies, including Canonical, who've had a pretty

242
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:06,240
good year, I would say.

243
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:08,800
The release of 1804 stands out.

244
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:12,520
That's the first LTS that they've released with Canonical on the desktop.

245
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:16,200
And Shuttleworth has said that it's going to be supported for 10 years.

246
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:19,480
And he's talking about doing an IPO in 2019.

247
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:22,080
Things seem to be lining up pretty well for Canonical.

248
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:28,720
Not just well, I would say a near perfect public execution.

249
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:31,040
1804 was good.

250
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:32,240
It was really good.

251
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:37,120
And we've gotten some really solid derivatives based off of 1804.

252
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:41,240
Some of the best derivatives I think we've ever seen of Ubuntu are based off of 1804

253
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:42,240
right now.

254
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:43,800
Very, very good.

255
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:48,200
But this is also now the pivot of the company.

256
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:51,320
They really ate the shit sandwich in 2017.

257
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:56,480
And 2018 was Canonical really firing on all cylinders.

258
00:16:56,480 --> 00:17:00,280
1804, I think, was one of their best releases in history.

259
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:02,720
1810 is a very solid mid-release.

260
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:10,440
Snaps, which have been a company focus, have had a very, very good year.

261
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:16,800
And Canonical has been part of that big Kubernetes conversation, which everyone's having towards

262
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:18,560
the end of 2018.

263
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:23,760
So they're doing really good right now, at least publicly on all the areas they're trying

264
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:25,080
to give attention to.

265
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:27,520
2019 is really theirs to lose.

266
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:28,520
Definitely.

267
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:33,520
Thinking about Snaps, Firefox and Chromium are the obvious huge examples.

268
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:37,960
But they've had a lot of proprietary commercial software as well, which some people aren't

269
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:38,960
happy with.

270
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:43,440
But realistically, if you want to press forward as a platform, you're going to need.

271
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:49,240
And it feels like they are gathering some momentum now so that they can go to the likes

272
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:54,280
of Adobe to get some of that software running on Linux.

273
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:59,340
And I think that you're right, it is theirs to lose next year.

274
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:05,100
They really need to double down on the Kubernetes and server and container stuff, as well as

275
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:06,100
the desktop.

276
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:09,600
And they could be in a really strong position this time next year.

277
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:14,480
They could be preparing for an IPO, the IPO may have happened, they might have been sold.

278
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:18,040
But either way, they could be in a really strong position.

279
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:19,040
I hope so.

280
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:22,200
I don't know why, but part of me wonders if they were an American company, perhaps there

281
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:24,140
would be more buzz right now.

282
00:18:24,140 --> 00:18:28,840
Because if you look at their sheer market dominance with virtual servers and containers

283
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:35,480
and Internet of Things devices, they're beating Red Hat in a lot of really important categories.

284
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:39,960
But yet we talk about Ubuntu like it's some desktop operating system.

285
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:43,280
It's just simply not getting the respect it deserves in 2018.

286
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:45,280
I hope 2019 changes that.

287
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:50,560
Yeah, but they don't have the market share when it comes to the boring, not exciting

288
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:52,580
stuff that Red Hat does.

289
00:18:52,580 --> 00:18:57,800
Red Hat is making all of that revenue from mostly quite boring installations that are

290
00:18:57,800 --> 00:19:01,320
just running infrastructure that we don't tend to think about.

291
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:03,300
I mean, yes, you are absolutely right.

292
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:10,520
But I think Ubuntu and its different older releases have a fair share of that same exact

293
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:11,660
workload.

294
00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:13,860
It just doesn't get the credit it deserves.

295
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:18,240
And I grant you, it's been a while since I have been going to clients and fixing their

296
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,400
boxes.

297
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:26,320
But there were absolutely conversations I had about solving issues with CentOS by moving

298
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:27,320
to Ubuntu.

299
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:33,580
And I look at the market dynamics and I look at the stats of people that download our shows

300
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:35,200
and that email us.

301
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:41,560
And it just, to me, seems like there is a real phenomenon happening here that the market

302
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:43,680
hasn't fully realized.

303
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:48,120
I could be wrong because there's so many on-premises business applications where CentOS or Red

304
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:53,480
Hat Enterprise just really, really is the perfect tool for the job.

305
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:58,120
But from my anecdotal experience over the last few years, I feel like Ubuntu is one

306
00:19:58,120 --> 00:20:05,880
of the biggest rising technologies that isn't getting the full, like it's just, the conversation

307
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:08,840
doesn't fully represent the growth it's seen.

308
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:09,840
Well, yeah.

309
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:17,160
And Canonical seems more agile than Red Hat because they are smaller and younger and thirstier,

310
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:18,840
hungrier.

311
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:20,120
Not owned by IBM.

312
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:21,380
Well, yeah.

313
00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:27,800
But you can't beat that entrenched market share and name you know.

314
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:33,360
It's something that management are never going to fire you for, for going with Red Hat, whereas

315
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:35,160
with Ubuntu, it's a bit more of a risk.

316
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:42,120
So I think you've got an interesting dynamic building there between this sort of new innovative

317
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:45,280
Ubuntu and the old school, solid Red Hat.

318
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:50,240
When you're really talking about this market, too, you got to think about the whole lifecycle.

319
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:53,400
It really starts at the student level.

320
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:56,000
It starts with what is the student learning about?

321
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,600
What are they getting certified in?

322
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:01,760
What are they going to try to find courses in?

323
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:07,440
And then that drives different courses, like that drives different educational institutions

324
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:09,040
to build courseware there.

325
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:11,960
And it sort of creates an ecosystem.

326
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:18,680
And so Ubuntu has to find a place in that ecosystem, because there are a lot of different

327
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:23,640
places where you can become Red Hat certified, you can become AWS certified.

328
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:30,380
But an Ubuntu certification or a canonical server or IoT device certification isn't really

329
00:21:30,380 --> 00:21:32,220
a thing.

330
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:37,060
And that plays a part too, and it kind of creates demand in itself.

331
00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:42,600
And of course, you don't really see people running RHEL or CentOS on their laptop, generally,

332
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:43,600
do you?

333
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:44,600
Maybe not.

334
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:45,600
You see tons of Ubuntu.

335
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:46,600
Maybe some Fedora.

336
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:47,800
Yeah, true.

337
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:50,480
You do see Fedora, but that's not quite the same thing, is it?

338
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:56,140
It's very similar, whereas the beauty of Ubuntu, the strength that they have is it is the same

339
00:21:56,140 --> 00:22:02,120
operating system, whether it's on a laptop or a server.

340
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:06,400
It's just the same thing, whether it's deployed on thousands of machines or just one person

341
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:09,000
downloading it, installing it on an old laptop.

342
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Right.

343
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,760
And if you're paying or not, you're going to get five years of support.

344
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:13,760
Yeah, exactly.

345
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:19,360
So it will be very interesting to see what happens this next year between Ubuntu and

346
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:20,360
Red Hat.

347
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:22,920
And we kind of look at this as a fight, but I don't think it is.

348
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:25,960
I think there's enough market there for them both to do well.

349
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:26,960
I agree.

350
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:27,960
I think so too.

351
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:32,740
I think there's plenty of market, and they both are, just by their very nature, serving

352
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:33,740
different niches.

353
00:22:33,740 --> 00:22:38,200
Well, something that there seems to be an increasing market for is gaming on Linux.

354
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:42,040
And this year has been a huge, huge year for gaming on Linux.

355
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:43,760
I just can't believe it.

356
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:46,160
I really can't believe it.

357
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:52,160
All of a sudden, this gift of Proton landed on us, and it's changed everything.

358
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:58,840
I've been playing so many great games on my machine that I just, I think the list right

359
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:07,080
now is unofficially near 2,500 games that are supported via Proton, or also known as

360
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:08,300
Steam Play.

361
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:13,920
And for me, it's really meant that my desktop is now full of different game icons that I've

362
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:16,440
just been waiting to play for so long.

363
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:22,860
Yeah, by all accounts, this has really opened up gaming on Linux and made quite a few people

364
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:27,160
able to ditch their Windows partition because there's just so many games available now.

365
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:31,200
Not all of them, of course, some of the AAA titles, or a lot of the AAA titles are not

366
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:32,200
available.

367
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:38,760
But it's been a kind of weird year from Valve because they've pretty much given up on hardware,

368
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:40,580
or at least that's the way it feels.

369
00:23:40,580 --> 00:23:44,900
But then they've also invested all this money into making the games work on Linux.

370
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:50,220
And that makes you think maybe they might have another go at the hardware situation

371
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:52,120
with the Steam machines next year.

372
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:53,120
I don't know.

373
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:56,720
And then you got to remember the whole thing with the Steam links, too.

374
00:23:56,720 --> 00:24:04,360
I expected by this time in 2018, we'd be talking about the Steam link 4K, or whatever it would

375
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:10,000
be called, 60 frames per second 4K Steam link streaming from your desktop PC.

376
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:15,760
And instead, Valve just killed the whole product line and just decided to do the app model,

377
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:19,000
which is not what I saw coming at all.

378
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:25,460
However, having a couple of months now to marinate on this particular change, it does

379
00:24:25,460 --> 00:24:28,040
seem to be the better choice.

380
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:32,360
And it kind of seems obvious now in retrospect.

381
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:35,240
But it has been a year that I didn't expect.

382
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:37,640
I thought we'd have a couple of Steam machines.

383
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:41,040
I thought we'd have a new generation of Steam link hardware.

384
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:45,480
I thought we'd have games shipping on Windows and Linux at the same exact time thanks to

385
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:47,760
Vulkan.

386
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:50,840
And it's been some of that.

387
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:55,320
And some of that's come in different forms that I didn't expect thanks to Proton.

388
00:24:55,320 --> 00:25:00,800
But it hasn't really been nearly what I thought it would be.

389
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:05,200
And I guess that's just how it goes sometimes.

390
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:11,720
You kind of have your expectations, you observe the results, and then you reset those expectations.

391
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:19,120
And then you come to the uncomfortable understanding that everything happens on Valve time when

392
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:22,280
it comes to anything that Valve makes.

393
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:27,720
And maybe it's a case that they felt a bit burnt from making hardware and selling hardware

394
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:33,340
because there's so much that goes into that with the certifications and all the prototyping

395
00:25:33,340 --> 00:25:34,480
process and everything.

396
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:38,400
And don't forget that if you have hardware, you also then have to work on the software.

397
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:41,840
Whereas if you just get rid of the hardware and say, here's an Android app, or here's

398
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:46,960
an app that works on the Raspberry Pi, someone else is taking care of all the hardware for

399
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:47,960
you.

400
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:52,560
It's a whole business model of this is our Steam store, it's running on hardware that

401
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:56,120
you have put together yourself, this is your gaming PC.

402
00:25:56,120 --> 00:26:01,720
So if they just concentrate on the software, then it's probably much less of a headache

403
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:04,120
for them and ultimately much more profitable.

404
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:08,820
Well, of course, all of that is well and good unless your kernel performs like crap, thanks

405
00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:10,120
to Meltdown Inspector.

406
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:13,480
Yeah, technically this was kind of end of last year, wasn't it?

407
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:17,440
But really, it's echoed throughout the entire year.

408
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:22,240
But from a personal perspective, it hasn't really changed that much for me.

409
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:27,560
I've not really noticed a slowdown on any of my hardware and servers that I look after

410
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:33,400
don't have the kind of workloads that are really affected by the Spectrum Meltdown mitigations.

411
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:39,920
So really, it's been a bit of a storm in a teacup for me, but I know that certain workloads

412
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:45,800
it has really affected and it's driven up the cost of computing for a lot of people.

413
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:51,040
That actually would be really interesting to know linuxactionnews.com slash contact

414
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:53,280
has this impacted your workload?

415
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:59,860
I mean, we know theoretically if it's a disk network and CPU intensive workload, you're

416
00:26:59,860 --> 00:27:02,480
more likely to be impacted by this.

417
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:08,960
But I have to say, it seems like the kernel team has done a really, really clever job

418
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:11,140
of striking a balance here.

419
00:27:11,140 --> 00:27:15,220
And that's one of the things that has been one of Linus's big focus points since he's

420
00:27:15,220 --> 00:27:20,720
been back is really making sure that we do this in a smart way.

421
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:24,880
In fact, one of the one of the biggest mitigations that just been submitted to the kernel is

422
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:29,760
an opt in where processes can choose to have protection instead of having protection by

423
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:33,300
default with a significant performance penalty.

424
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:38,880
You can say, you know, I'm one of those processes that's it's a snowflake.

425
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:40,080
I am a unicorn.

426
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:41,400
I am very important.

427
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:45,540
I need the meltdown specter protection.

428
00:27:45,540 --> 00:27:47,520
And I opt for that.

429
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:50,800
And I will eat that performance impact for that.

430
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:53,320
And then the kernel says, all right, okay, very good.

431
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:54,680
I will protect you.

432
00:27:54,680 --> 00:28:00,720
But otherwise, your applications are unimpacted by the performance penalties of these different

433
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:01,720
mitigations.

434
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:04,520
And that's a pretty smart way, I think, to handle this.

435
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:09,280
Well, yeah, if you've got a load of machines that are behind firewalls and stuff and only

436
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:15,980
on your internal network, then you don't really need to bother with these mitigations.

437
00:28:15,980 --> 00:28:18,920
The risk isn't really that bad.

438
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:22,160
Whereas if you've got public facing web servers and stuff, then obviously, you do need to

439
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:23,160
do that.

440
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:26,000
And so it is good, I think that we've got this choice now.

441
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:30,280
And it was a very sensible approach, and a very clever solution to it.

442
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:34,320
But we can't talk about the kernel without the code of conduct and Linus leaving for

443
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:35,680
a while and coming back.

444
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:40,160
There was a lot said about this at the time.

445
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:42,680
But nothing's really changed since then, has it?

446
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:46,200
Well, we've gotten a more behaved Linus Torvalds.

447
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:51,080
I actually think this was handled in a masterful way.

448
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:54,280
Let's recap, just because it's the end of the year, and that's what we're doing right

449
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:55,280
now.

450
00:28:55,280 --> 00:29:00,880
It starts with a rather aggressive article that was about to be published in The New

451
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:01,960
Yorker.

452
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:06,360
They reached out to contact Linus to get his input on it.

453
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:11,240
And he was then alerted to what was about to be a shitstorm coming his way.

454
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:13,880
He decided to take some time off.

455
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:18,560
They applied a rather rushed code of conduct to the kernel.

456
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:21,440
And he took his break, code of conduct went live.

457
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:23,340
The entire internet freaked out.

458
00:29:23,340 --> 00:29:26,380
The New Yorker piece ran.

459
00:29:26,380 --> 00:29:27,500
Time went by.

460
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:33,040
They modified that code of conduct to be a little more amicable for people involved.

461
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:37,880
Linus came back, and he seems to have toned down his interactions.

462
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:43,240
And I think he very tactfully avoided a huge shitstorm that was coming his way.

463
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:49,500
And business is now continuing on like nothing happened, with Linus that swears a bit less.

464
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:53,260
And I think in some ways, this was the ideal scenario.

465
00:29:53,260 --> 00:29:58,960
Because now we have the ground rules for participating in the kernel that everybody understands.

466
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:04,680
And we still have the original visionary that started the project involved directing the

467
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:05,680
project.

468
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:10,040
This to me seems like the absolute best case scenario that we could have gotten.

469
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:14,480
You look at all of the different political situations that have happened in the same

470
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:17,520
general flavor over 2018.

471
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:20,440
And I think Linus navigated it perhaps the best.

472
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:21,680
Yeah, I agree.

473
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:26,920
I was worried for a while that this was going to make serious changes, and maybe even the

474
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:28,640
most serious change that he would go.

475
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:31,320
You wanted to have a bet that he wasn't going to come back.

476
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:32,320
Yeah.

477
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:33,320
Yeah.

478
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:34,320
I was seriously worried about that.

479
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:39,660
But it seems to have all blown over, and it is just business as usual.

480
00:30:39,660 --> 00:30:45,000
Whether or not there are tensions simmering below the surface that will kind of bubble

481
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,000
over.

482
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,480
That's almost guaranteed.

483
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:48,480
Yeah.

484
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:49,480
Yeah.

485
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:51,880
I think we're going to see some more of this next year, but I really hope not.

486
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:57,640
I really hope that they just stick to writing great code and making the kernel be the best

487
00:30:57,640 --> 00:30:58,640
that it possibly can be.

488
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:01,160
But I think we're going to have to see on that one.

489
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:06,680
Well, we can't go any farther with an end of year review without talking about Chrome

490
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:07,680
OS.

491
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:08,680
Yeah.

492
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:13,360
This was the year that Chrome OS went from being a web browser to being a full fledged

493
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:16,920
operating system, or at least took some massive steps towards that.

494
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:20,960
Not only did we get a Chrome OS tablet this year, but the bigger deal really was that

495
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:23,960
whole being able to run Linux apps on Chrome.

496
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:30,400
You got the user land, of course, but the GUI apps, like the X11 apps from Linux now

497
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:32,520
on Chrome OS.

498
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:37,720
And on top of those application level things, they also made improvements like around Chrome

499
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:43,460
OS 70 to bring native file support to Chrome OS so you could browse Samba shares.

500
00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:46,800
It's really becoming a full fledged development environment.

501
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:52,600
Google went from a web browser for your desktop to a development environment to create web

502
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:59,440
applications and they're empowering that with access to Linux and Linux applications.

503
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:04,480
But the big question is, is this going to be enough to sell these machines running Chrome

504
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:09,120
OS to serious professionals, be they developers or something else?

505
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:12,160
And let me ask you a question.

506
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:15,400
You bought a laptop this year, a very nice ThinkPad.

507
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:18,480
Did you consider buying a Chromebook for one second?

508
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:20,560
No, not for the ThinkPad.

509
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:21,560
I have since then.

510
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:26,760
I got the ThinkPad to record podcasts, but I have thought about a Chromebook since then

511
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:31,960
for email and Google apps and things like that, because now as part of Linux Academy

512
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:38,100
we're using Google apps and Jupiter Broadcasting uses Google apps and a lot of places use Google

513
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:43,080
apps and maybe a Chromebook would be a perfect machine for that.

514
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:49,040
But more than that, I think Chrome OS started the year as a web browser OS and I think it's

515
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:52,960
ending the year as a workstation OS.

516
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:57,780
And that is no small transition to make in one year.

517
00:32:57,780 --> 00:33:02,560
And it's not applicable to all of us, but it's pretty remarkable that it's applicable

518
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:04,520
to some of us.

519
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:07,520
That's a massive transition they're going to make and continue to make.

520
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:12,000
And then you look at it with like Samsung decks and other things in this general area

521
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:16,680
and Microsoft with the Windows subsystem for Linux, something's happening here.

522
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:21,200
Well, that something is companies waking up to the power of Linux.

523
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:26,320
And by Linux, I mean, proper Linux, not Android or Chrome OS as we used to know it, be it

524
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:30,600
desktop or server, you know, proper GNU slash Linux.

525
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:35,180
These companies are realizing, hang on, this is actually pretty good and maybe we should

526
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:36,520
do something with it.

527
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:40,280
It's not that hard to actually just ship things people want.

528
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:42,280
Hold on a second.

529
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:46,320
I mean, really, that's what we're seeing, like Samsung and Google are just now figuring

530
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:47,320
that out.

531
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:48,320
Hello.

532
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:53,480
Hello, everybody, and welcome to the reality of what Linux users want.

533
00:33:53,480 --> 00:34:00,000
And Chrome OS and Windows and Samsung and others, I recently had an interview with the

534
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:07,280
developer of ISH, I-S-H, which is an entire Linux environment for iOS.

535
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:12,320
All the major platforms right now are offering Linux in some form or another, and it turns

536
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:16,160
out the best Linux experience is when you run Linux.

537
00:34:16,160 --> 00:34:18,640
Yeah, surprise, surprise.

538
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:23,720
Well, you said it was Canonical's year to lose, but really it's Linux's year to lose.

539
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:25,920
But I do not see that happening.

540
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:26,920
Well, we'll see.

541
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:28,000
I have a few predictions.

542
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,360
I think you have a few predictions.

543
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:34,600
Let's just maybe wait and see where things are going to go in 2019.

544
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:39,960
Don't miss a single episode of Linux Action News because we cover it as it unfolds every

545
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:40,960
single week.

546
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:45,400
Go to linuxactionnews.com slash subscribe for all the ways to get new episodes, including

547
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:50,520
next week's episode, which is my predictions and Joe's predictions for 2019.

548
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:54,080
Yeah, and a look back at our previous predictions.

549
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:58,440
Will I be editing out the Bitcoin stuff or will we have to just face the music on that?

550
00:34:58,440 --> 00:35:00,080
Oh, we'll see.

551
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:02,640
I think that's painful, Joe.

552
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:04,800
We have to wait and see.

553
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:09,640
Yeah, you can go to linuxactionnews.com slash contact for ways to get in touch with us.

554

Washington Technical College.

556
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:25,880
We'll be doing the first live Linux Action News on location, and we'd love to have you

557
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:26,880
there.

558
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:29,920
Yeah, I'm not at all nervous about doing a live show in front of people during the day,

559
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:30,920
not drinking or anything.

560
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:31,920
No, it'll be fine.

561
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:32,920
Don't worry.

562
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:33,920
It'll be great.

563
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:34,920
Yeah, of course.

564
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:38,600
We'll be back next Monday with our weekly take on the latest Linux and open source news.

565
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:40,880
I am at Chris LAS.

566
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:42,520
I'm at Joe Ressington.

567
