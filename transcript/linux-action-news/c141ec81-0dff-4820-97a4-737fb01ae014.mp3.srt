00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,360
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, episode 117, recorded on August 4th, 2019. I'm Chris.

2
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:11,360
And I'm Joe.

3
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:15,600
Hello, Joe. Good to be connected with you on a very busy news week. Let's start off

4
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:19,560
with Mangero's plans to ship Free Office.

5
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:26,080
Yeah, Free Office, which is free as in beer, but not free as in freedom. This is a proprietary

6
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:33,120
suite, which they had initially planned to ship by default in Mangero. But then after

7
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:37,480
a fair bit of backlash, shall we say, they've decided that they're not going to ship it

8
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:42,420
by default, but they'll give you the option to install it, or LibreOffice, or no Office

9
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:43,420
Suite.

10
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:48,440
A pretty common reaction online was negative. People thought it was a bad idea to shove

11
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:54,880
a proprietary Office product into a free Linux distribution when LibreOffice exists and it's

12
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:58,920
pretty functional. I had a chance to chat with Philip, one of the founders of Mangero

13
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:04,640
on Linux Unplugged 3.12. And what I took away from the conversation was that it was more

14
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:10,680
about trying to create a bit of differentiation for Mangero from the rest of the pack.

15
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:15,000
So there's something unique about the distribution, but also trying to improve compatibility for

16
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:22,640
users that treat their Office Suite like a tool. And they wanted perhaps improve compatibility

17
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:26,360
with the commercial products on the market, which SoftMaker's free Office is pretty well

18
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:31,260
known for. I think the project looked at it as a very practical move. There was no monetary

19
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:35,560
exchange to take it on. It was more of a let's just try to do something different and improve

20
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:39,820
compatibility for users. The reaction was strong. And so now it sounds like it'll be

21
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:41,320
an option during install.

22
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:45,720
Yeah, you're going to be faced with a screen that gives you the option of either free Office,

23
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:50,160
LibreOffice, or no Office Suite. And I think that's what they should have done in the first

24
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:56,720
place, really. I think that it was a bad idea to ship proprietary software by default. Fair

25
00:01:56,720 --> 00:02:01,360
enough to give people the option to install it. But I think just having that on your default

26
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:08,480
ISO is just, it's not a great look really for a Linux distribution.

27
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:14,680
I think I agree. Making an option is best for everyone. Because myself, when I install

28
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:19,040
Mangero, I'll choose the no Office option. That's perfect for me. I don't really want

29
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:26,800
it. I don't use it that much. So that's what my dog in this hunt is, full disclosure. However,

30
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:30,140
so I could have an informed conversation with Philip, I downloaded free Office and gave

31
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:35,160
it a go. And after using it for about an hour and opened up a couple of different things,

32
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:40,140
compared it to LibreOffice and Google Docs, which is my, sorry to say, when I do need

33
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:47,120
a word processor or spreadsheet, I use Google Docs. So I compared it to that as well. And

34
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:52,520
I walked away with something. And that is good enough is not good enough for people

35
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:57,740
that are opening up business documents, where they need to properly be able to import proprietary

36
00:02:57,740 --> 00:03:02,520
Office formats and then save as different proprietary Office formats and keep functionality,

37
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:06,880
make sure formatting is correct, and have a workflow that's really similar. Imagine

38
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:13,000
that mythical migrating user who's coming from Windows to Linux, free Office sort of

39
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:20,520
replicates that Office look and feel, combined with the compatibility. And in my experience,

40
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:26,080
it's also faster, a little faster, starts up a little bit quicker, feels a little lightweight

41
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:31,800
on the system. And you combine that with the look and feel and the compatibility. I think

42
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:35,720
it is a solid argument that it's better than LibreOffice for a certain type of worker.

43
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:38,160
So again, I think having the option to install is a good thing.

44
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:43,520
Yeah, by all means, make it easy to install this proprietary Office suite and point people

45
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:47,440
towards it and recommend it or whatever. But I just think shipping it by default, it's

46
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:51,840
just crossing a line. Some people talked about shipping graphics drivers by default, but

47
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:57,160
I think that's different. That is making the most of your hardware. Whereas this is just

48
00:03:57,160 --> 00:04:02,880
different. This is productivity software that we're talking about that you don't actually

49
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:05,680
need to make your computer work properly.

50
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:10,320
Yeah, I agree. There's not an equivalence to a hardware enablement. But there could

51
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:17,720
be an equivalence to codecs or making Steam super simple to install. You don't need Steam

52
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:23,620
to make your computer work. You don't need H.264 playback and MP3 playback to make your

53
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:28,680
computer work. It's nice to have, just like opening up Office documents that you need

54
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:32,000
to interact with to do your job is nice to have.

55
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:37,800
Yeah, but there is no open source version of Steam. There's no open Steam or whatever.

56
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:43,000
There are different ways to get games that can be open source or whatever. But I don't

57
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:48,480
think that is a fair equivalent because LibreOffice is good enough for some people, at least for

58
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:53,400
me. And I use it actually quite a bit and I just have no need for a proprietary Office

59
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:59,080
suite. I think it comes down to make it easy to install, but don't ship it by default.

60
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:01,080
That's what I personally want to see.

61
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:05,420
That's reasonable and I can't really argue that. I want to sort of pivot for a second

62
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:09,160
and talk about the meta aspect of this story, which we in a way have touched on several

63
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:16,600
times this year already. And that is outrage driven development. Project announces intention

64
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:26,440
to do X, community reacts very strongly, and then project amends announcement to do Y instead,

65
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:31,400
which is generally a compromise in some way. And sometimes that truly is for the best,

66
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:35,700
like in the case of the 32-bit support for Ubuntu. I am reminded of that famous Steve

67
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:41,320
Job quote that's roughly, if you asked consumers before the automobile came out what they wanted,

68
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:43,040
they'd say a stronger, faster horse.

69
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:47,040
Yeah, I do get what you're saying there, but this is open source development we're talking

70
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:52,920
about and it's supposed to be a community effort. And okay, some people go about it

71
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:58,520
in the wrong way, being too strident and Twitter rants and all the rest of it, but isn't the

72
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:03,880
whole point of it that the community drives the direction of development?

73
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:08,600
Absolutely. You quantified it right there. That's why I'm worried because Twitter and

74
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:15,060
the forums don't represent the tens and tens of thousands of people that are running Manjaro.

75
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:19,680
Just as the people that got really upset on Twitter and the dozen or so news articles

76
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:25,800
were written and the outrage comments on Reddit don't represent the tens of millions of Ubuntu

77
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:33,760
desktop users. But yet what we talk about as community is just a hyper-representation

78
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:39,000
of the most outraged individuals who are taking the effort to go to different outlets, some

79
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:43,640
which are very low effort like Reddit and Twitter, and they're expressing their outrage.

80
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:49,760
I saw so many comments about people dropping Manjaro over this. This sort of, I want to

81
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:53,080
punish them attitude for doing this. It's not just that people are upset, they want

82
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:58,380
to punish them. And then the developers, who all of a sudden have this onslaught of very

83
00:06:58,380 --> 00:07:05,880
loud feedback, cave because we all see this as this is the voice of the community when

84
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:11,720
it's just the representation of a small portion. You know this because our shows have a lot

85
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:17,240
more people downloading than we get comments from. And it's just the nature of doing business

86
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:22,400
on the internet. You get a lot of people that just enjoy content or will use a distribution,

87
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:26,760
faithfully upgrade from release to release of Manjaro and be perfectly happy with it

88
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:30,400
and not really care. You know most people probably just figure, right, well if they

89
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:34,720
install FreeOffice, I'll just uninstall it and then I'll install LibreOffice. Job done.

90
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:40,680
And that's it. End of story. And what we end up getting is this hyper-representation from

91
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:46,560
the outrage. And that's really what bothers me here is because that is driving decisions.

92
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:49,440
And it's not fully representative of the entire community.

93
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:53,480
There's not really a way to get representation from the entire community. You just have to

94
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:58,840
listen to the vocal people or ignore them or whatever. They are the people who are in

95
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:04,560
your community who are talking to you. And so you have to decide whether you think that

96
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:11,960
they are a true representation of the silent majority or whether they're just crackpots

97
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:15,560
or whatever. And that is a difficult thing to do.

98
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:18,800
I think it's a skill you have to build up. I think it's something that takes perhaps

99
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:24,400
years of exposure to calibrate correctly. And some personality types may be better or

100
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:29,600
worse at handling that kind of feedback as well. So there's a personal factor in there.

101
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:34,280
Yeah, but it's just part of running a project. You just have to be able to deal with this

102
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:35,280
stuff.

103
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:39,320
Add that to the list of required skills to run a large open source project. All right,

104
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:44,680
problem solved. Moving on to other large open source projects are coming together, perhaps

105
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:46,520
maybe to benefit end users.

106
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:50,840
Yeah, the Linux App Summit is going to be held in Barcelona in November from the 12th

107
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:56,880
to the 15th. And there's going to be representatives from both KDE and GNOME all working together

108
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:57,880
there.

109
00:08:57,880 --> 00:09:01,280
Joe, I believe this is the artist formerly known as the Libre Application Summit. But

110
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:06,040
I think that was when it was more just the GNOME camp. And now that KDE and GNOME folks

111
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:10,760
are coming together to sort of talk about some future collaboration on the desktop,

112
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:15,880
they've renamed it. And it's, I think, a pretty positive sign of where the two projects could

113
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:19,380
be going in the future. And the headlines are going crazy. They're coming together to

114
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:24,400
create a new desktop era for Linux. I don't know about that. But it seems like it's a

115
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:29,080
good sign. And it's looking like this is the next generation or the next phase of this

116
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:30,080
conference.

117
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:35,960
But really, this isn't anything hugely new, because the different projects in open source

118
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:42,120
have generally worked together before. And this supposed rivalry between GNOME and KDE

119
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:48,720
is just not even really true. It's the users, if anything, might be starting this. But I

120
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:54,400
think that what actually stands out here is that they're going to actively start working

121
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:59,120
together, rather than just kind of playing nice with each other and occasionally interacting

122
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:04,960
or whatever. This is going to be some serious coming together to improve the Linux desktop.

123
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:10,800
I mean, is that pie in the sky? I don't think so. I think genuinely, this is a really good

124
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:11,800
move.

125
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:15,720
I think the truth lies somewhere there in the middle. Like you say, a lot of this has

126
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:20,920
already been happening for a long time. There have been common standards efforts for years.

127
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:24,600
I think what we're getting here is a bit of a sales pitch from a group that is trying

128
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:29,080
to grow a conference into something that's a serious contender in the industry. And so

129
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:35,280
they're using a lot of enthusiastic language. I'll give you an example. KDE and GNOME will

130
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:40,600
no longer be taking a passive role in the free desktop sector. That's just that sentence

131
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:46,840
right there. That reeks of sales bullshit. First of all, it's demeaning to the project's

132
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:54,720
years of efforts. And it implies that they have somehow been just sitting around observing

133
00:10:54,720 --> 00:11:00,080
the free desktop market, but not actively participating in it, which is an insane sentence

134
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:05,800
because they are the free desktop market. So it's just ridiculous on its face. And they

135
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:10,200
then continue on with the joint influence of the two projects. The summit will shepherd

136
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:17,460
the growth of the free desktop by encouraging the creation of quality applications.

137
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:21,480
This is one of those fallacies that we run into a lot in open source development. We

138
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:26,920
have this great belief because we have seen it work a few times, a few times super successfully

139
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:34,540
too. If we build it, they will come. If we build the perfect framework, if we have the

140
00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:42,520
ideal toolkit, if we use just the right language, they will come. That's not what drives the

141
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:52,680
desktop market. I think it should be obvious and painfully clear to this group in particular

142
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:57,840
that that's not the dynamics at play in the desktop market. It hasn't been for about 25

143
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:58,840
years.

144
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:05,160
So a lot of this to me reads as they're really excited about this event. They hope they can

145
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:09,480
lay some foundational groundwork here to really work towards something in the future. And

146
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:13,240
they need a lot of people to get on board. And so they've got to talk about it in a really

147
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:18,680
big way. And the way it's being represented in the rest of the community as this incredible

148
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:28,440
event of the two projects coming together, while that feels good, it's just a conference.

149
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:36,040
It's not like some joint declaration of cooperation that the foundations have issued with co-signatures

150
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:41,040
of all of the primary developers. It's some event organizers that are promoting something

151
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:43,040
that's happening in Barcelona in November.

152
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:48,760
I thought I was supposed to be the cynical one. That's a very cynical read of it. I'm

153
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:53,280
just much more positive. Maybe I've just swallowed the Kool-Aid on this one. But I think it's

154
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:57,920
got to be good for them to be getting together and working together like this.

155
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:03,040
You might be right. The way to really know would be to go. I won't be making it to Barcelona

156
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:07,280
this year. But if they ever made it to the US, like next year or something, I'd check

157
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:12,280
it out and see if I'm wrong. I'd sure love to see some information about how they plan

158
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:17,680
to entice third-party developers. I'd like to see some action plans on how to go after

159
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:22,680
the market that is creating applications that run on the cloud. That seems like such a perfect

160
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:26,960
market for the free desktop groups to target. A real type of power user that's comfortable

161
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:31,960
with change that needs to develop on the platform that they're targeting anyways. Oh, my gosh.

162
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:36,840
They practically could just give them an invite. So maybe that'll come out of this conference.

163
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:40,000
But that might just be too practical. Maybe I'm expecting too much.

164
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:45,540
Maybe. Well, Barcelona in November is lovely. So maybe I could try and go.

165
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:47,040
You could be our special correspondent, Joe.

166
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:49,040
Yeah, yeah. Sounds good to me.

167
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:52,040
You be careful. You might get held to that.

168
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:58,800
All right. Well, let's talk about Android. And we got a pretty big update this week regarding

169
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,800
search providers in Europe.

170
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:05,240
I guess I was naive. I did not see it going this way. So first, it's kind of what you

171
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:11,060
expect. A real basic screen in Android that will have Google and three other search providers

172
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:15,680
that you can choose from that have been randomized. Google writes, we'll introduce a new way for

173
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:20,080
Android users to select a search provider to power a search box on their home screen

174
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:24,120
and as the default in Chrome if it's installed. Not too surprising.

175
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:28,400
But if you want your search engine to be part of this, then you're pretty much going to

176
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:29,400
have to pay.

177
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:33,560
Now, this is the part I should have expected but hadn't really given the thought. It's

178
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:38,840
going to be an auction, Joe. To get your search engine on that list next to Google's name,

179
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:44,520
you have to participate in what Google calls a first price sealed bid auction to select

180
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:48,560
the other general search providers that appear on the choice screen.

181
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:54,240
Google will conduct auctions on a per country basis for a period from January 1st, 2020

182
00:14:54,240 --> 00:15:00,800
to December 31st, 2020. Following the initial round of auctions, any subsequent rounds will

183
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:08,560
only occur once per year, which means these are high value spots. In each country's auction,

184
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:13,200
search providers will state the price that they are willing to pay each time a user selects

185
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:16,520
them from the choice screen in that given country.

186
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:20,400
Yeah, and then each search engine is just going to get an invoice every month from Google.

187
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:24,680
This is how many people wanted to use you, so you've got to pay us this much money. This

188
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:31,840
really is Google just doing the absolute bare minimum to comply with the European Commission.

189
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:37,280
And Google had previously argued that it needed that search revenue that was tied to results

190
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:43,320
in Chrome and on the Android platform to monetize what they said was, quote, a significant investment

191
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:47,440
in the system. However, the commission rejected that assessment, noting the billions Google

192
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:53,800
earns in the Play Store alone, as well as all of that very valuable data that Google

193
00:15:53,800 --> 00:16:00,200
is collecting on Android users. But to monetize this, and to make it super exclusive once

194
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:06,160
a year, and there's only three other slots along with Google's own search results. So

195
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:10,900
it's going to be really expensive. And you have to get cracking because if you want your

196
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:16,320
search engine in that list, you need to apply to bid by September 13th of 2019.

197
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:20,240
But what's interesting is that if you are running a search engine, you don't necessarily

198
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:27,640
have to pay to be part of this. Because if three search engines aren't willing to pay,

199
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:34,120
then any of those extra slots will just be chosen at random from a list of search providers

200
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:38,200
that were interested in it but didn't want to pay. So I don't know whether that's actually

201
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:42,080
going to happen. It seems capitalism will probably mean that there won't be any free

202
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:46,120
slots. But it'll be interesting to see whether that actually happens. Although we won't probably

203
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:51,640
hear about it because this is all kind of sealed, confidential, and that no numbers

204
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:53,360
are going to be revealed to the public.

205
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:59,120
It does kind of make me giggle, though, picturing Bing and DuckDuckGo, like shell corporations,

206
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:02,480
being set up all around the world bidding on these. So that way DuckDuckGo and Bing

207
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:07,880
would be just a big conspiracy to screw with Google. That makes me laugh. Hey, let's do

208
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:11,560
a quick update on DNS over HTTPS, a.k.a. Doh.

209
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:16,880
Yes, I was looking to implement this by default in Firefox. But before they do that, they

210
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:18,160
are running some tests.

211
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:21,960
When we were talking about this a couple of weeks ago, I was kind of curious how this

212
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:26,960
would work for managed networks like enterprises that have centralized DNS that they use for

213
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:31,840
very specific reasons or parental controls. Well, it turns out Mozilla's thought of that,

214
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:36,120
or at least they are thinking about that right now. And they're running a test. They want

215
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:40,780
to understand how often users of Firefox are subjected to managed networks or parental

216
00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:47,960
control software. Also, a really common way to do ad blocking, right, is by DNS blocking.

217
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:52,960
So they have to attempt to discover how common this is and how they can accommodate it.

218
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:57,120
Selina Duckelman writes on the Mozilla blog that they'll be capturing this information

219
00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:03,760
locally, including when people are using safe versions of Google or YouTube. And they will

220
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:08,560
analyze that and then they'll send up the metrical information, if that's a word, to

221
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:12,840
the Mozilla servers, but not the actual URLs you're going to.

222
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:16,620
So this is sort of a safe way to participate in the study for them without them having

223
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:21,100
to actually look at all of your DNS queries and all of that garbage that would sort of

224
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:26,000
violate your privacy like crazy. And of course, they are offering a way for you to opt out

225
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
as well.

226
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,680
I don't really know what they're planning to do with the data that they collect here

227
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:34,320
because what are they going to find out? A certain percentage of users fall into these

228
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:36,400
categories. But then what?

229
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:41,120
I could see a couple of uses. If it's super low, if it's like one percent of our users

230
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:45,480
have managed DNS, which I doubt, but let's just say that's what it is, then that makes

231
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:49,680
just a great stat in the blog where we can just completely ignore this because only one

232
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:53,920
percent of our users have this problem. So it could be that. But I doubt it. I think

233
00:18:53,920 --> 00:19:00,040
the more generous interpretation would be they'll use this to develop the different

234
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:06,880
features and support in DNS over HTTPS. So they will have to build in some types of accommodation

235
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:12,720
for safe search and for managed enterprise DNS. And perhaps this will give them some

236
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:15,480
insights into what areas they have to focus on.

237
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:20,320
Well, right now it's pretty easy to go into the settings and enable or disable DNS over

238
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:26,160
HTTPS. And I would imagine that once it is default, that's going to be similar. So I

239
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:32,080
think that administrators are not going to have a hugely bad time of it. And most users

240
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:37,160
will be fine. So it's going to be one more part of the setup process for people who have

241
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:39,960
specific uses. I don't think it's going to be a huge issue.

242
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:44,320
I started playing around with it just recently. I'm going to give it a go for a while. And

243
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:50,600
I noticed now there's just a field right in there to specify your own DNS over HTTPS server.

244
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:54,720
And to make that a little bit easier, there's a snap now. I think it's like it might be

245
00:19:54,720 --> 00:20:00,160
called like a cloud, Cloudflare or something. It's a version of the Cloudflare DNS over

246
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:05,680
HTTPS proxy server that you can install on your own system and run it on your own box

247
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:08,860
and try it for a little bit. It can be kind of a neat way to just mess around with the

248
00:20:08,860 --> 00:20:13,360
whole software stack. I'll try it for a bit, see where it goes. I think the biggest question

249
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:17,320
on all of our minds is, will we ever get used to saying doh?

250
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:22,480
I certainly won't. And DNS over HTTPS is a mouthful. We need something that's, I don't

251
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:24,040
know, easier to say.

252
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:29,280
We need a new contract, Joe. One for the web. And I think your good buddy, Tims Burners-Lee,

253
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:30,840
may have just the solution.

254
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:36,560
Yeah, the way he sees it, things are very different from 30 years ago when he invented

255
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:40,560
the web. And he thinks that it's gone into some pretty dodgy directions. And he thinks

256
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:46,680
that what we need is for everyone to sign up for this contract for the web. And suddenly,

257
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:48,720
that's going to make everything much better.

258
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:55,360
The idea is get major governments, major corporations, get everyone in between to literally sign

259
00:20:55,360 --> 00:21:00,720
a contract that companies and governments should ensure everyone can connect to the

260
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:06,720
internet and keep all of the internet available, affordable, and accessible all the time, and

261
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:12,560
respect and protect people's fundamental online privacy and data rights. Clearly something

262
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:17,800
that's pretty easy to get behind. What company wouldn't want to be on that list? It looks

263
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:23,360
dead. Burners-Lee goes on to describe this as a journey from digital adolescence to a

264
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:26,940
more mature, responsible, and inclusive future.

265
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:31,520
Is anyone going to pay attention to this? It seems pretty unlikely to me.

266
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:35,400
I mean, maybe. I mean, a lot of my attention these days is really focused on Solid.

267
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:40,120
Yeah, whatever happened to that? That was his project to... I don't even know what it

268
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:43,800
was supposed to be, some sort of like next generation web or something.

269
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:45,880
Yeah, a new way to do linking of data.

270
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:49,840
Yeah. And if you look at the website, it says the apps are coming. The first wave of Solid

271
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:56,800
apps are being created now. So who knows? Maybe he's just working on a few things at

272
00:21:56,800 --> 00:22:03,400
the same time. But it just feels like he's trying to stay relevant, maybe?

273
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:11,400
Maybe. I'm of two minds. I do see that. It feels like these initiatives go nowhere because

274
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:16,720
the internet and the web are just not a cohesive small thing that can be influenced like that

275
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:23,800
anymore. But then I also think about what people say about Richard Stallman. And I'm

276
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:28,520
somewhere in the middle on those particular things too. I feel like in a way, it's good

277
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:35,720
to have something to strive for. Like what is the bar? What should we as citizens of

278
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:39,480
the internet be pushing for? And that's a pretty good list.

279
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:44,040
I could get behind that list of ideals. I could say I'm pretty skeptical anything's

280
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:48,360
going to become of this. But maybe it's good to have that goalpost.

281
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:53,960
Yeah, I suppose you're right. Having one good force tugging in the positive direction can't

282
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:56,840
really be a bad thing. So maybe I should stop being cynical.

283
00:22:56,840 --> 00:23:00,000
Well, and I suppose in that regard, it's good to have his name attached to it.

284
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:04,720
Yeah, I suppose. And if they can get some seriously big organizations signing up to

285
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:07,880
this, then maybe it can create some momentum.

286
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:11,880
Now our last story of the week. When I first saw the headline, I kind of snickered a little

287
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:17,000
bit and I thought this is kind of silly. And then it clicked in my head how I would personally

288
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:21,800
use this. And well, now I'm kind of excited about moving the Linux desktop into virtual

289
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:29,360
reality. This may actually be a genuinely decent use case for VR on Linux.

290
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:33,480
Right. Well, this I have to hear because I did not stop snickering, I'm afraid.

291
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:38,000
Well, Collabra has made this announcement and it was development that's sponsored by Valve.

292
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:43,400
And there's real functional code today. Those are all three, like, unusually great things

293
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:49,300
about an announcement. It's called XR Desktop, and it sits on top of either Plasma or Gnome

294
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:55,040
Shell and extends the window environment into virtual reality, into a 360 degree space where

295
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:58,200
you can manage windows in that space.

296
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:05,400
Now this is, for me, perhaps the only solution to what is otherwise an insatiable appetite

297
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:11,500
for monitors that I have. I want so many screens, Joe. It's ridiculous. I would like to have,

298
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:17,820
if I truly could, a screen per application. Really would. So this is actually potentially

299
00:24:17,820 --> 00:24:23,080
a possibility because not only can you lay windows out, but because it's a full 3D space,

300
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:27,720
you can have them far away. You can move them closer. There's core elements to what they're

301
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:33,400
proposing, the workflow that I find super appealing. Essentially unlimited screen space

302
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:38,500
in a whole virtual world. When I'm sitting here doing these shows, I could be sitting

303
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:45,640
here with a VR headset on my face with hundreds of windows. It could be paradise, Joe. I could

304
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:46,640
be in ADD heaven.

305
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:51,480
It sounds like a nightmare to me. I can't think of anything worse. I suffer really badly

306
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:56,780
from motion sickness and it seems to be getting worse as I get older. So this, just no way

307
00:24:56,780 --> 00:25:04,180
would I possibly want it. It's like something from an 80s movie. It just seems laughable

308
00:25:04,180 --> 00:25:05,880
to me that you would want to do this.

309
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:11,720
That might be why I like it too. Well, I'll tell you what. Honestly, it is so early days.

310
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:18,360
This is really rough stuff. I'm very skeptical about the interface. They've done a good job

311
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:24,120
to map UI controls to the VR controllers. I got to give them credit for that. I'm not

312
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:29,500
on board with using my Oculus controllers to manage my desktop though. I want a keyboard

313
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:34,760
and mouse. There's a lot of rough stuff here, but here's what we do know so far. It integrates

314
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:39,520
with the existing desktop environment's compositors. In the case of Kaywin, it's sort of like a

315
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:44,800
Compiz plugin, if you will, and in the case of Gnome Shelts and Patches. So you can run

316
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:50,160
both the virtual space and your actual desktop environment at the same time if you want.

317
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:54,760
They've written a GLib wrapper to Vulkan, which they call Gulkan, which makes it easy

318
00:25:54,760 --> 00:26:02,080
to use Vulkan rendering for this entire environment. And they have early support even for Wayland

319
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:03,080
on Gnome Shelts.

320
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:06,960
Now, I don't think this is going to be the future of the Linux desktop. In fact, I don't

321
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:11,500
even think this is going to be a mainstream thing. But I really appreciate the idea that

322
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:16,920
if you plug a VR headset into Linux in the future, there's actually something functional

323
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:20,640
you can do with it. It doesn't just show up as a second weird display that has the wrong

324
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:25,560
aspect ratio and Linux just looks like a dumpster fire trying to manage it. If you plug that

325
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:29,040
thing in and all of a sudden your desktop applications extended to it like a mirrored

326
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:33,760
environment and it was functional, that's pretty impressive. And if they just got to

327
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:35,560
there, I'd be a happy camper.

328
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:39,040
Yeah, fair enough. It's not something I'm going to use. But I suppose bringing more

329
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:43,480
functionality on Linux to existing hardware, that's always got to be good.

330
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:48,120
This is more likely going to get me to hook up my Oculus to a Linux desktop than gaming

331
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:53,600
would. I know that sounds silly. But like I said, I've just got a voracious appetite

332
00:26:53,600 --> 00:27:00,200
for screens. I want all those screens. So then actually, I was thinking we should do

333
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:04,320
a challenge and try to get Wes to set this up for us during the sprint that we're doing

334
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:11,360
in a couple of weeks. Don't say anything. Don't tell anybody. We'll surprise them.

335
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:15,160
They'll get Linux action news every single week at linuxactionnews.com slash subscribe

336
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:17,400
for all the ways to get new episodes.

337
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:21,260
And you can go to linuxactionnews.com slash contact for ways to get in touch with us.

338
00:27:21,260 --> 00:27:26,680
And go check out the new linuxacademy.com brand new website launch and it looks slick.

339
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:30,680
Yeah. Did you have anything to do with this dark mode thing?

340
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:34,640
It's taking over Joe. Oh man, I love it.

341
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:38,240
We'll be back next Monday with our weekly take on the latest Linux and open source news.

342
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:39,760
I'm at Chris LAS.

343
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:41,080
I am at Joe Rossington.

344
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:44,040
Thank you for joining us and we will see you next week.

345
00:27:44,040 --> 00:28:11,040
See you later.
