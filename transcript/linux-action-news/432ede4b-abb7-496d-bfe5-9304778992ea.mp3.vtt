WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:09.400
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, episode 151, recorded on March 29th, 2020. I'm Chris.

00:09.400 --> 00:10.400
And I'm Joe.

00:10.400 --> 00:15.400
Hello, Joe. Good to be connected with you. Have you noticed the web just seems a little

00:15.400 --> 00:16.400
better this week?

00:16.400 --> 00:20.900
Well, it is, according to Mozilla. They've launched a new test pilot, Firefox for a better

00:20.900 --> 00:21.900
web.

00:21.900 --> 00:28.000
Yeah. I mean, I like a better web. Who doesn't want a better web? So, Scroll, if you recall,

00:28.000 --> 00:33.540
is a $5 a month service that stops ads from loading on certain websites. But what's interesting

00:33.540 --> 00:39.840
about it, it's not technically an ad blocker, but rather it lets publishers know that for

00:39.840 --> 00:43.400
this user, they shouldn't serve ads in the first place when you visit.

00:43.400 --> 00:47.520
Now, while they're rolling this up, by the way, I will mention just here on the side,

00:47.520 --> 00:52.380
for right now, the price is actually $2.50. So, I guess it's a sale. It's an extension

00:52.380 --> 00:57.780
we're talking about here that Mozilla's introducing, which would technically work in other browsers.

00:57.780 --> 01:04.640
But the experience, they say, is best in Firefox. And the extension includes Scroll as well

01:04.640 --> 01:10.640
as a, quote, customized enhanced tracking protection setting that will block third-party

01:10.640 --> 01:14.560
trackers, fingerprinters, and crypto miners. You know, the kind of setting that should

01:14.560 --> 01:18.680
be turned on by default, but that's according to Mozilla. It will work across different

01:18.680 --> 01:22.640
desktop browsers, but that aspect might be Firefox only for now.

01:22.640 --> 01:28.680
This deal with Mozilla should get Scroll, in theory, a much larger user base, but neither

01:28.680 --> 01:32.280
company would actually disclose what the financial terms were.

01:32.280 --> 01:36.600
Yeah, so it'll block all the tracking except for Scroll, who will be tracking which of

01:36.600 --> 01:41.000
these websites you're visiting so they can divvy up the money that you're paying proportionally

01:41.000 --> 01:43.120
among the websites that they support.

01:43.120 --> 01:47.320
Yeah, at this point, it's not really clear what the extent of that data is. Obviously,

01:47.320 --> 01:53.400
you need to know how long you spent reading an article to proportionally pay that publisher.

01:53.400 --> 01:57.520
This whole thing kind of reminds me of like the Brave Rewards system, but there just hasn't

01:57.520 --> 02:05.220
been a huge adoption of that where this, with Mozilla behind it, could see some adoption.

02:05.220 --> 02:09.240
Like if you look right now, it's pretty light. The Verge, for example, is part of it, but

02:09.240 --> 02:14.720
most websites aren't. And right now, that hasn't changed. There hasn't been a lot of

02:14.720 --> 02:20.080
velocity there. Mozilla's stepping in, giving it their seal of approval. Maybe that changes

02:20.080 --> 02:21.080
things.

02:21.080 --> 02:25.800
Well, yeah, this is a huge vote of confidence in Scroll as a solution to the problem of

02:25.800 --> 02:31.280
how to pay publishers without loads of tracking and advertising. And surely, that vote of

02:31.280 --> 02:36.040
confidence is going to bring more publishers on board. That's if Mozilla still is relevant

02:36.040 --> 02:39.880
and Firefox is relevant. Is it relevant enough still? I don't know.

02:39.880 --> 02:45.240
Well, the problem seems to be very relevant. This is an issue that goes back as old as

02:45.240 --> 02:51.200
the web. How do you monetize content that people expect to read for free? Some publishers

02:51.200 --> 02:55.120
with a large audience, like the Wall Street Journal and the New York Times, have been

02:55.120 --> 03:01.000
successful at a paywall, while most publishers are not. Without a good answer to this question,

03:01.000 --> 03:07.000
the industry seems to have relied on very privacy invasive techniques to really track

03:07.000 --> 03:12.960
you across all properties, to really properly monetize you. And it never really reflected

03:12.960 --> 03:19.640
on the value of content. In fact, it sort of encouraged, well, not sort of, it absolutely

03:19.640 --> 03:25.720
encouraged clickbait, because more views equals more ad dollars. Whereas a system like this

03:25.720 --> 03:31.080
rewards quality content. The more time you actually spend reading and digesting an article,

03:31.080 --> 03:32.400
the more they get paid.

03:32.400 --> 03:36.560
I think the key to how this is different from Brave is that we're talking about actual

03:36.560 --> 03:42.800
cash here, rather than Brave, which is tokens and, let's face it, magic internet beans.

03:42.800 --> 03:48.800
Yeah. I think for this to really take traction with the publishers, they've got to return

03:48.800 --> 03:53.720
real money. Maybe it's not as much as advertising, but in some cases, for some sites, maybe it

03:53.720 --> 03:57.620
would be more. They've got to really deliver results. And then I think publishers would

03:57.620 --> 04:02.600
be all in. This is a win-win. Publishers get rewarded for good content. They don't have

04:02.600 --> 04:09.400
to cow-toe to advertisers. And users win out because pages load faster, they use less battery

04:09.400 --> 04:13.200
life on mobile, they take less bandwidth, and they're less privacy invasive.

04:13.200 --> 04:15.160
Or you could just use an ad blocker.

04:15.160 --> 04:20.280
Yeah. No, I mean, you joke, but I think that's a fair point. And that's free, right? And

04:20.280 --> 04:21.840
it's all publishers.

04:21.840 --> 04:25.840
Yeah. I haven't seen an ad on a website for a long time.

04:25.840 --> 04:30.200
Yeah. And I hope, man, I hope that publishers understand that's who they're really competing

04:30.200 --> 04:35.960
with. There's some analogy here to when the iTunes MP3 store launched at 99 cents a track

04:35.960 --> 04:40.840
when you could go on LimeWire and download them for free. They had to make it super easy,

04:40.840 --> 04:45.280
they had to make it convenient, and they had to make it a reasonable price. And then users

04:45.280 --> 04:50.000
switched to the actual commercial legitimate versions. Something like that could happen

04:50.000 --> 04:55.080
here. But I think publishers need to remember their real competition is not things like

04:55.080 --> 05:00.360
Brave or Scroll or whatever you want to call it. It is truly ad blockers.

05:00.360 --> 05:05.080
Yeah, I think the iTunes analogy isn't quite right. I think Spotify is more spot on there

05:05.080 --> 05:10.280
really because there's the free tier where you can, again, listen to adverts. And I think

05:10.280 --> 05:13.400
that is what killed music piracy more than iTunes.

05:13.400 --> 05:15.200
Streaming killed the download star, you're saying?

05:15.200 --> 05:16.200
Yeah, pretty much.

05:16.200 --> 05:18.000
Yeah, I could see it.

05:18.000 --> 05:22.640
But the thing is that we already have this free, convenient way to not see adverts that

05:22.640 --> 05:29.600
involves just installing an extension, which it seems not just tech savvy people are switched

05:29.600 --> 05:38.080
on to. So how can they make this a thing? You've got this kind of problem here in that

05:38.080 --> 05:45.280
you need to have all the publishers on board for it to really have value. Whereas if you've

05:45.280 --> 05:52.080
only got a handful, then that $2.50 or $5 a month doesn't seem worth it. And I think

05:52.080 --> 05:58.040
you've also got to convince people that they need to support good journalism and good content

05:58.040 --> 06:04.000
generally and make the argument that using an ad blocker is ultimately going to lead

06:04.000 --> 06:10.160
to clickbait and just lower the quality of the web. And this is something I suppose Mozilla

06:10.160 --> 06:14.120
should be doing. This is within their remit. Whether it's going to work or not, I don't

06:14.120 --> 06:17.720
know. But who else is going to drive this forward but Mozilla?

06:17.720 --> 06:22.080
But taking a data approach to it as well. We'll have links in the show notes, but it appears

06:22.080 --> 06:28.480
that Mozilla has been running pilots that indicate that 18% of the test users after

06:28.480 --> 06:36.440
the free period opted to subscribe. Now, 18% doesn't sound like a lot, but when you consider

06:36.440 --> 06:44.900
that the industry average is 3% and 5% is considered a massive success, 18% would suggest,

06:44.900 --> 06:52.680
and Mozilla makes this assumption, that users reflect the value in paying for good journalism.

06:52.680 --> 06:59.040
And if we give them an easy way to monetize good journalism, they'll take it.

06:59.040 --> 07:04.520
But once again, this is only available in the USA for now, as is this way with all of

07:04.520 --> 07:08.880
the new things that Mozilla seem to be coming out with for Firefox. And at the moment, it

07:08.880 --> 07:15.120
is a test pilot, but that could change relatively soon. They seem to move fairly quickly with

07:15.120 --> 07:16.120
these things.

07:16.120 --> 07:21.840
Well, something that's available to anyone that has a Raspberry Pi 4 is Plasma Big Screen.

07:21.840 --> 07:26.480
Now I know that all your Raspberry Pi 4s are velcroed down in your dinette, whatever that

07:26.480 --> 07:27.480
is.

07:27.480 --> 07:28.480
Quite literally, yes.

07:28.480 --> 07:36.400
But I've got one kicking around, so I tested this. And what it is, is a big screen experience,

07:36.400 --> 07:42.600
as the name suggests. It is the plasma shell, but it's not a plasma desktop. It's using

07:42.600 --> 07:47.760
the same technologies that make the plasma desktop. And it's designed to be a 10-foot

07:47.760 --> 07:52.880
UI for smart TVs, or give you that smart TV experience, so you could turn any TV into

07:52.880 --> 07:53.880
it.

07:53.880 --> 07:58.560
Well, my monitor has got HDMI in and some really terrible speakers, so I was able to

07:58.560 --> 08:04.720
test it as if it was a TV. And they're calling this a beta. I think that's a bit generous,

08:04.720 --> 08:10.600
to be honest. It felt alpha quality to me. But I like what they're doing, and I think

08:10.600 --> 08:13.840
it's got potential, but it does need a lot of work.

08:13.840 --> 08:20.480
Now what I didn't mention is the Mycroft integration, which is heavy. That integration is integral

08:20.480 --> 08:27.960
to it. As soon as you turn it on, Mycroft starts talking at you, making you register

08:27.960 --> 08:32.120
it as a Mycroft device. So I had to create an account, and I had to type this alphanumeric

08:32.120 --> 08:37.040
thing in and register it. And that finally made it shut up.

08:37.040 --> 08:38.520
Did you try any voice commands?

08:38.520 --> 08:41.840
I did, but the Raspberry Pi doesn't have a microphone, right? So therefore, you need

08:41.840 --> 08:46.280
to plug a microphone into it. So I plugged my audio interface that I'm talking to you

08:46.280 --> 08:52.960
over now into it, went into the settings, selected it, and nothing. It just didn't seem

08:52.960 --> 08:58.400
to be working with it. And I don't know. I tried everything, and I was like, hey, Mycroft,

08:58.400 --> 09:01.720
hey, Mycroft. And it just would not listen to me. I even tried talking to it in an American

09:01.720 --> 09:05.840
accent, and that didn't work. So maybe my accent was not good enough.

09:05.840 --> 09:06.840
What does that sound like?

09:06.840 --> 09:10.400
Hey, Mycroft. And it just wouldn't have it.

09:10.400 --> 09:14.960
Yeah, that's totally it. Well, so the idea here is that Mycroft offers what are so-called

09:14.960 --> 09:19.680
quote unquote skills. Each skill takes care of a particular voice interaction. They say

09:19.680 --> 09:24.400
there's a large variety from weather to date and time and reminders to online service clients

09:24.400 --> 09:29.320
and integrations with things like SoundCloud and YouTube. And they can display information

09:29.320 --> 09:36.520
using QML inside this big picture, big screen environment. For people listening that want

09:36.520 --> 09:39.560
to kind of conceptualize what it looks like, of course, you can just check out the links

09:39.560 --> 09:44.880
in the show notes. But if you have an Android television, specifically of the Nvidia Shield

09:44.880 --> 09:50.080
variety, this is like a really clean version of that. If you took out all of the trying

09:50.080 --> 09:55.960
to push like game stream and different services and just focused on that UI, this is what

09:55.960 --> 10:00.200
you would have a nice, clean implementation of it. But I'm not surprised to hear it's

10:00.200 --> 10:07.200
early days. These TV interfaces are surprisingly fiddly and they take a lot of work. I feel

10:07.200 --> 10:11.600
like they have a pretty good base, though. The Raspberry Pi 4 is a solid device to target.

10:11.600 --> 10:17.240
I am so impressed, even months into using them for production servers. I am impressed

10:17.240 --> 10:21.880
and I'm picky and I'm impressed. It's also using KDE neon for the base. So it's a great

10:21.880 --> 10:29.320
way to get new cute and plasma libraries in there. And then Libre CEC or Lib CEC, which

10:29.320 --> 10:33.300
allows you to control your big screen TV with remote control. And they've tried to bring

10:33.300 --> 10:39.800
these things together along with their completely open UI stack to give you an open UI for your

10:39.800 --> 10:46.000
television. Is it family ready? Does it have that spousal approval factor? I don't think

10:46.000 --> 10:50.920
so. But I am really pleased to see something in this space that isn't Kodi. Not that Kodi

10:50.920 --> 10:53.480
isn't fantastic, but it's one project.

10:53.480 --> 10:58.440
Well, that's where I was going to go next with this. Do we need this? We have Kodi fully

10:58.440 --> 11:05.280
open source. The brand might be a little tainted by piracy and stuff, but it is a very, very

11:05.280 --> 11:13.360
functional open source, full screen, big screen TV experience. Do we really need something

11:13.360 --> 11:16.000
from the KDE team for this space?

11:16.000 --> 11:21.680
Yes, I'll tell you why. Kodi is so great. If I have a library that I want to point Kodi

11:21.680 --> 11:26.520
at and I want to watch media, man, there's just no better TV video player on the planet

11:26.520 --> 11:34.920
than Kodi. However, if your interest is more things like Netflix or Twitch or Plex or YouTube,

11:34.920 --> 11:38.740
or if Kodi is just one of the many things you want to do with your set top box and you

11:38.740 --> 11:44.120
don't want it to be the entire set top box experience, that's where this fits in. And

11:44.120 --> 11:48.280
to be honest with you, Joe, it's why I still use an Nvidia Shield. I have Kodi as one of

11:48.280 --> 11:53.680
the apps. And when the job calls for Kodi, I use Kodi. But on that same box, I also

11:53.680 --> 12:00.120
have VLC. I also have an actual official Netflix app. I have an official YouTube app. I have

12:00.120 --> 12:06.700
an official Plex app. These are for me, cornerstone pieces to the living room. And I know there's

12:06.700 --> 12:12.780
plugins that would offer me that same basic functionality in Kodi, but it's not good enough

12:12.780 --> 12:16.020
for me. And it's really not good enough for the family. Truth be told, it's probably good

12:16.020 --> 12:20.940
enough for me. And that's where I could see this UI that you implement on a Raspberry

12:20.940 --> 12:25.140
Pi 4 instead of something that's like an Nvidia Shield that's hundreds of dollars and not

12:25.140 --> 12:29.420
even available in every country. Once it gets good enough, this could replace that kind

12:29.420 --> 12:33.060
of functionality. I think my assessment's in line with yours based on what I've seen

12:33.060 --> 12:37.600
so far. It's not there yet, but I am tempted to fire it up on a new Pi.

12:37.600 --> 12:41.720
Yeah, it's something that I want to play with more, especially I want to try and get the

12:41.720 --> 12:48.140
Minecraft stuff going, but I wonder whether they'll ever get official Netflix apps and

12:48.140 --> 12:53.720
stuff like that for it. That seems a bit farfetched to me. If you can't even get Kodi working

12:53.720 --> 12:58.820
properly and consistently and not breaking all the time with Netflix, then are you really

12:58.820 --> 13:05.660
going to get an official app on a new open source TV interface? It seems unlikely.

13:05.660 --> 13:11.560
Yeah, probably not. I suppose the best option might be a well-presented web UI.

13:11.560 --> 13:17.300
Which is good enough. That's how I use Netflix. So if it was properly embedded, it would be

13:17.300 --> 13:22.180
fine, I think. And it is basically just a Plasma desktop underneath, so there's no reason

13:22.180 --> 13:23.320
they can't do that.

13:23.320 --> 13:27.540
You make a good point, actually. And I think you're touching on something that as a community

13:27.540 --> 13:33.260
we are not discussing because it's very uncomfortable. And that is a lot of the things we want to

13:33.260 --> 13:38.920
watch are wrapped up in proprietary services and proprietary apps. And the web experience

13:38.920 --> 13:43.780
is there, but it is not the same. Like if I'm just thinking about our home television

13:43.780 --> 13:49.540
experience, I have Amazon Prime because I've had Prime forever. I have CBS All Access because

13:49.540 --> 13:52.860
I'm going to pay for the development of Future Trek. That's just who I am. Even if I don't

13:52.860 --> 13:56.420
watch it via that service, I'm going to pay for it. So I have the app, and when it's available

13:56.420 --> 14:01.460
I like it. I like to watch the behind the scenes stuff and the little mini shows via

14:01.460 --> 14:07.760
their app. Netflix, yep, I got that. YouTube TV, too much, but yep, I got it. These are

14:07.760 --> 14:11.740
all proprietary streaming services that are wrapped up in proprietary apps that are available

14:11.740 --> 14:18.280
for iOS and Android that have web versions that are OK, some of them not even optional.

14:18.280 --> 14:21.500
And then there's even more services that have launched just this year. Disney Plus is an

14:21.500 --> 14:26.900
example of one that my kids love. Peacock from NBC is about to launch. There's a Hulu

14:26.900 --> 14:31.340
app. There's Spotify apps. All of these are available in some form or another via the

14:31.340 --> 14:35.360
web, but it's a new experience. And it's just not what you're down for when you sit down,

14:35.360 --> 14:38.980
you turn on the television, you just want to hit a button on your remote and start enjoying

14:38.980 --> 14:43.680
content. And I think fundamentally the issue is these different service providers, if you'll

14:43.680 --> 14:48.180
call them that, these, that's essentially what they are. They're content as a service.

14:48.180 --> 14:52.920
They just can't be bothered to make desktop apps for Linux. And so it's hard for projects

14:52.920 --> 14:58.140
like Plasma Big Screen to integrate them. And Kodi kind of gets around that with some

14:58.140 --> 15:02.460
hacky plug-ins here and there, but it's not 100%. And as a community, we're just not really

15:02.460 --> 15:07.020
talking about this. Maybe we don't have an answer. Well, I tend to use the web version

15:07.020 --> 15:11.780
of everything. Like the Amazon one's fine. Netflix one's fine. I don't have many of the

15:11.780 --> 15:17.360
other services, but I think they're good enough as a kind of stopgap, certainly for people

15:17.360 --> 15:22.860
like me who don't mind the odd little glitch here and there. But I think for that kind

15:22.860 --> 15:29.420
of spousal approval, family friendly thing, maybe it's not going to be good enough. Well,

15:29.420 --> 15:32.900
even just the TV experience, because I would, I would bet you're probably what, doing that

15:32.900 --> 15:38.980
on a laptop or a desktop? Yeah, this is on a desktop with a big monitor essentially,

15:38.980 --> 15:43.700
like a TV. Yeah. It's different when you're on a couch and you're 10 feet away, like what

15:43.700 --> 15:47.660
this is exactly positioned for. And you're doing it with a remote that has, you know,

15:47.660 --> 15:52.080
a directional control and a select button. Yeah, which I didn't have one of those to

15:52.080 --> 15:56.600
try this out. I was just using the wireless keyboard, which I always use. And you can

15:56.600 --> 16:01.220
just use the arrow buttons and enter to kind of emulate that. But then you can also alt

16:01.220 --> 16:06.780
tab and stuff to some extent on this. So you can see it's desktop routes in there. Ultimately,

16:06.780 --> 16:11.700
these challenges that we've just highlighted won't be resolved unless there is a demand

16:11.700 --> 16:17.380
for that content in that layout. And it's projects like this that will get us there.

16:17.380 --> 16:21.940
And so I will probably give it a go at some point. I may wait a few months for development,

16:21.940 --> 16:26.980
but I could see here at the studio where it's just me and Wes mostly. This would be perfect.

16:26.980 --> 16:30.620
Well, you probably want to get off that Nvidia shell because it's running Android and Android

16:30.620 --> 16:35.980
is terribly insecure, isn't it? Hey, apparently. Although thankfully, they haven't figured

16:35.980 --> 16:41.220
out that you go after television apps yet. But two different malware detection vendors,

16:41.220 --> 16:46.380
just as a broad category this week, are making a bunch of noise about apps in the Google

16:46.380 --> 16:53.100
Play Store that are riddled with spyware, I guess, monitoring, monetization techniques,

16:53.100 --> 16:54.420
what do you even call it anymore?

16:54.420 --> 16:59.500
Yeah, adware spyware, there's various definitions of it. But either way, I suppose crapware

16:59.500 --> 17:01.140
is probably the best way to put it.

17:01.140 --> 17:06.020
Yeah, one of them was in 56 different apps that they checked. A lot of them were targeted

17:06.020 --> 17:11.220
at children, surprise, surprise. And it seems like we're looking at a 1.7 million device

17:11.220 --> 17:15.980
install base here. There's a cool aspect to this show, real cool guy developer trick that

17:15.980 --> 17:21.100
they did to get clicks that looked organic on the ads they were serving up. Because of

17:21.100 --> 17:24.460
course, users aren't necessarily going to just tap ads that show up on their device,

17:24.460 --> 17:28.220
even if they can present them to the end user doesn't mean they're going to tap them. So

17:28.220 --> 17:31.220
if you could come up with a cool guy way to still get some clicks, then you're really

17:31.220 --> 17:38.380
making the money. And this round of malware used Androids motion event mechanism to simulate

17:38.380 --> 17:42.260
clicks based on just moving around in your pocket or moving around in your hand, it would

17:42.260 --> 17:47.140
translate that to rando clicks to make it look real to advertisers. So they were able

17:47.140 --> 17:53.940
to fraud legitimate ad services like Google's AdMob. Another couple of interesting bits

17:53.940 --> 18:00.220
that I suppose are somewhat noteworthy. They wrote these apps in native Android languages,

18:00.220 --> 18:03.620
you know, use Java in the right spots, use other languages in the right spots to make

18:03.620 --> 18:07.740
it look like legitimate background apps or games. And then there's the separate group

18:07.740 --> 18:14.460
Dr. Webb, who found a whole other batch of infected apps not even related to this using

18:14.460 --> 18:17.820
a whole nother branch of malware called Android Circle one.

18:17.820 --> 18:24.060
Hang on a second. What happened to the App Defense Alliance? This is something we reported

18:24.060 --> 18:30.220
on back in November last year, where Google partnered up with three antivirus firms, ESET,

18:30.220 --> 18:34.920
Lookout and Zimperium. And the idea of that was that they kind of pool their resources

18:34.920 --> 18:40.020
and make sure stuff like this did not happen. They'd be scanning applications that were

18:40.020 --> 18:44.620
submitted to the Play Store and monitoring them and working with the technology that

18:44.620 --> 18:50.100
Google already has and avoiding this from happening. And yet I keep reading about more

18:50.100 --> 18:55.660
and more cases where researchers are finding these malicious apps in the Play Store.

18:55.660 --> 19:00.540
In that something three different vendors, all of which would be using their technologies

19:00.540 --> 19:06.300
to scan play submissions before they even went live. And yet here we are. And last time

19:06.300 --> 19:11.180
on the show when something like this came up, I just said, hands up. Android is the

19:11.180 --> 19:16.040
new windows for end users. Don't let friends and family use Android. Guys like you who

19:16.040 --> 19:22.120
know about lineage or people who maybe aren't looking for background changers or pop the

19:22.120 --> 19:26.760
bubble games that are going to install Android malware. They're fine. If that's not you,

19:26.760 --> 19:32.620
you're fine. But friends and family that are not savvy, don't let them run Android. Not

19:32.620 --> 19:36.900
only do they end up with crap phones from carriers that generally are loaded with carrier

19:36.900 --> 19:42.740
crap and underspect, but even if they get a good Android device, there's still hundreds

19:42.740 --> 19:47.580
of thousands of apps that make it into the Play Store that are riddled with crap that

19:47.580 --> 19:52.420
will make their phone slow, steal their private information and drain their battery.

19:52.420 --> 19:56.860
That's not a good situation where someone on a Linux podcast is saying essentially use

19:56.860 --> 19:59.080
iOS, not the Linux based phone.

19:59.080 --> 20:04.080
It's really so sad. It took me a while to get to this point, because I wanted to think

20:04.080 --> 20:09.660
maybe with the pixel devices and this this Android malware alliance that we talked about

20:09.660 --> 20:12.980
in November, I thought maybe finally Google will get this together.

20:12.980 --> 20:17.880
It's funny. I don't think I would go so far as to say use an iPhone and Android is not

20:17.880 --> 20:22.520
secure. But I think there was a time when I would have said, just stick to the Play

20:22.520 --> 20:27.920
Store and you'll be fine. Whereas now I think it's just stick to well-known applications.

20:27.920 --> 20:32.380
If you're installing Facebook, WhatsApp, all of the standard stuff, then yeah, you're going

20:32.380 --> 20:38.300
to get all the tracking that goes along with that. But at least that's big billion dollar

20:38.300 --> 20:39.300
business tracking.

20:39.300 --> 20:48.180
You're selling me on this. I'm really not selling myself on this. Don't go for obscure

20:48.180 --> 20:53.300
apps essentially and read reviews. But then I suppose they can be faked as well.

20:53.300 --> 20:58.260
And the problem is, is that is great advice for people that are the type of user that

20:58.260 --> 21:03.900
listen to a podcast like this. But for my family members, like my aunts and uncles,

21:03.900 --> 21:08.900
it's just completely lost on them. If it's in the Play Store, they have the expectation

21:08.900 --> 21:13.460
that it's completely safe to install. And I would bet you my family members have been

21:13.460 --> 21:19.180
bitten by stuff like this because I've been handed their phones at family events and they

21:19.180 --> 21:24.600
hand them to me and they're hot to hold. And they have like two hours of battery life.

21:24.600 --> 21:28.660
And some of them are newish. They're like some big LG device with a ginormous screen

21:28.660 --> 21:34.780
and 15 cameras on the back. And they just got it for a great deal from the Verizon store.

21:34.780 --> 21:40.740
But then what is Google to do? We get up in arms when they kick open source apps out because

21:40.740 --> 21:44.580
they don't follow the rules. But if they make the rules even stricter, then it's going to

21:44.580 --> 21:49.900
be much harder for developers to get their apps in there. Like with iOS, my understanding

21:49.900 --> 21:55.740
is that is not straightforward at all. It's not open in the slightest in terms of getting

21:55.740 --> 22:00.820
your apps and you have to jump through hoops to get them into that app store. But then

22:00.820 --> 22:05.620
we don't hear many stories about malware making it through the gates. No, it's mostly those

22:05.620 --> 22:11.220
billion dollar companies. Like there was just some story about Zoom. Even if you didn't

22:11.220 --> 22:15.120
have a Facebook ID, the Zoom iOS app was sending your information to Facebook and they just

22:15.120 --> 22:19.900
fixed that. But that kind of stuff happens all the time on iOS. Yeah, it's tricky because

22:19.900 --> 22:27.860
how often do you hear about Google having an issue around executing at scale and scope?

22:27.860 --> 22:32.100
Like that's not generally their thing. They don't generally have issues executing at scale.

22:32.100 --> 22:35.660
But with the Play Store, it seems like they are. Well, maybe they'll have an answer for

22:35.660 --> 22:40.540
this at Google IO. Oh, hang on. No, that's not happening this year. Ah, too soon. Yeah,

22:40.540 --> 22:45.200
to be fair to them, it was a sensible decision. And a quick update on something that we reported

22:45.200 --> 22:50.540
on last week, and that is Chrome and Chrome OS releases, which were paused, but it seems

22:50.540 --> 22:56.540
only for a week because instead of just security updates, they're going to continue on with

22:56.540 --> 23:01.380
Chrome and Chrome OS updates. So what was the point of the pause? It's not like a week

23:01.380 --> 23:05.420
is enough time. If somebody in their area was going to get sick, it could still happen.

23:05.420 --> 23:11.600
It's not like Corona is gone. Maybe they just were pausing to do an assessment of what resources

23:11.600 --> 23:15.420
they had. And maybe they did the math and worked out that if a certain number of people

23:15.420 --> 23:21.260
go down, you know, they'll be all right. So yeah, a bit strange. Yeah, you know, given

23:21.260 --> 23:25.500
the benefit of the doubt, maybe they were preemptively over communicating expectations

23:25.500 --> 23:29.180
saying, Hey, as we go remote, we don't know as a team what we can deliver. Oh, by the

23:29.180 --> 23:32.860
way, we're remote. Now. I think we've got our feet underneath us. Okay, we're resuming

23:32.860 --> 23:37.380
normal operation. Interesting, though, that Microsoft are not going to be releasing Windows

23:37.380 --> 23:42.580
preview releases in May because of all of this. So maybe Google's a little bit more

23:42.580 --> 23:47.820
agile than Microsoft. Oh, Microsoft always slightly behind the trends. Well, a company

23:47.820 --> 23:54.260
that tried to ride on the trends was Telegram. And they had this huge ICR $1.7 billion of

23:54.260 --> 23:58.300
investment. And they've been struggling ever since to get their coins out there. They call

23:58.300 --> 24:04.140
them grams, struggling with regulators. And this week, they were dealt a serious, serious

24:04.140 --> 24:09.460
blow, which looks like it might be the end of this project. Not just the end of the project,

24:09.460 --> 24:14.940
but spell serious long term trouble for telegram. This week, a federal court judge sided with

24:14.940 --> 24:19.460
the US Securities and Exchange Commission against telegram and granted a preliminary

24:19.460 --> 24:26.460
injunction against that 1.7 billion initial coin offering. In an opinion, an order filed

24:26.460 --> 24:30.900
on Tuesday with the New York Southern District Court read a spot in the United States that

24:30.900 --> 24:36.020
is very aggressive against cryptocurrencies. The SEC has shown substantial likelihood of

24:36.020 --> 24:41.540
success in proving that telegrams plan to distribute grams is offering securities, and

24:41.540 --> 24:47.700
they have a test called the Howie test, h o w e y. So Howie Howie, and essentially anything

24:47.700 --> 24:53.700
that meets this test is considered a securities and the telegram gram in their quote unquote

24:53.700 --> 24:59.180
emergency filing, they have an emergency filing jokes, it's an emergency. They say it clearly

24:59.180 --> 25:04.060
meets this test. And so they're clearly essentially trading on the idea that if you bought in

25:04.060 --> 25:09.200
now you could sell for a higher rate later to a bunch of people, which is true. That's

25:09.200 --> 25:10.200
hard to argue.

25:10.200 --> 25:16.500
Yeah, that's the whole point of an ICO, right? You sell a bunch of investment in your cryptocurrency

25:16.500 --> 25:22.060
low. And then once it launches, the value goes up. And then you cash out and make a

25:22.060 --> 25:26.460
bunch of money. It's basic investment. But they were trying to argue that it wasn't an

25:26.460 --> 25:29.340
investment and they just have lost.

25:29.340 --> 25:34.940
Yeah, and the SEC is arguing the telegram knew all along. They understood that purchasers

25:34.940 --> 25:41.620
would not be willing to pay $1.7 billion to acquire grams merely as a means to just store

25:41.620 --> 25:47.860
and transfer value. Telegram recognized and developed a scheme according to the SEC to

25:47.860 --> 25:51.900
maximize the amount of initial purchasers and would be willing to pay by creating a

25:51.900 --> 25:57.820
structure to allow these purchasers to maximize the value they receive upon resale to the

25:57.820 --> 26:02.620
market. In other words, they knew all along, they built it this way. And that proves their

26:02.620 --> 26:08.540
case. So telegram has been served an injunction that prevents them from issuing grams or doing

26:08.540 --> 26:13.660
anything with the cryptocurrency until after their hearing. They could fight this, but

26:13.660 --> 26:18.820
it is extremely unlikely that telegram is going to fight this. And it is very likely

26:18.820 --> 26:24.380
the telegram will end up having to pay the money back, which they don't have. They don't

26:24.380 --> 26:29.460
have 1.7 billion just sitting in a bank account. The guy behind telegram is rich, but he's

26:29.460 --> 26:35.180
not that rich. And if telegram is ordered to pay it back, they're going to face a very

26:35.180 --> 26:37.380
particular kind of painful situation.

26:37.380 --> 26:44.260
Yeah, I'm thinking, do we move to signal, WhatsApp or what? We use telegram heavily.

26:44.260 --> 26:48.140
I know. It would really be a shame to see telegram go away. But I think in the back

26:48.140 --> 26:51.740
of our minds, we've always wondered what's the end game here? What's the monetization

26:51.740 --> 26:52.740
strategy?

26:52.740 --> 26:57.560
Yeah, I talk to everyone on that. Like all my friends basically are on there. So I'm

26:57.560 --> 27:03.420
sure we'll all move to something pretty quickly if it does go away. But it just seems strange

27:03.420 --> 27:10.620
to think that all our chat history and everything will just be gone. And surely not, but $1.7

27:10.620 --> 27:12.360
billion is a lot of money.

27:12.360 --> 27:15.140
Time to start a people's movement to open source all the telegram.

27:15.140 --> 27:19.820
Yeah, there's been various open source bits of it. But maybe if the back end was somehow

27:19.820 --> 27:25.060
open sourced and federalized, we could maybe keep it going peer to peer. It seems a long

27:25.060 --> 27:26.060
shot though.

27:26.060 --> 27:30.480
Yeah. Plus, you know, Vlad's got a really good internet connection in his basement.

27:30.480 --> 27:33.300
So you got to go down to Putin, you got to convince him to get the server out of there

27:33.300 --> 27:38.500
and put it up like on DigitalOcean. It's going to cost. Well, whatever happens with this
