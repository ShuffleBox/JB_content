00:00.000 --> 00:09.560
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, episode 132, recorded on November 17th, 2019. I'm

00:09.560 --> 00:10.560
Chris.

00:10.560 --> 00:11.560
And I'm Joe.

00:11.560 --> 00:14.840
Hello, Joe. Good to be connected with you and good to be back here in the seat. And

00:14.840 --> 00:18.200
we start things out with huge news from Docker.

00:18.200 --> 00:23.120
Two bits of news, really. The first is that Mirantis has acquired Docker Enterprise. And

00:23.120 --> 00:29.720
the second is that Docker has somewhat restructured and secured $35 million worth of investment.

00:29.720 --> 00:34.780
Yeah, okay. So Mirantis, they're a prominent open stack in Kubernetes cloud company. They

00:34.780 --> 00:40.460
acquired the Enterprise product line from Docker, the developers for that product line,

00:40.460 --> 00:46.560
the sales associates, the support staff, the general aspects of the business, sans, I would

00:46.560 --> 00:52.420
imagine a few individuals, right over to Mirantis. And this deal is effective immediately. The

00:52.420 --> 00:57.420
CEO and co-founder of Mirantis said in an email, quote, we're not disclosing the terms

00:57.420 --> 01:03.520
of the deal. The deal closes Wednesday, November 12, in the morning 2019. So it's already done

01:03.520 --> 01:04.740
as we record this.

01:04.740 --> 01:09.360
I think you've buried the lead on what they managed to buy here. Because the most important

01:09.360 --> 01:13.200
bit is the 750 Enterprise customers that they bought.

01:13.200 --> 01:19.240
Is it 750 is a lot of customers for like, if I was doing a business, for sure. Like

01:19.240 --> 01:26.560
if I had, you know, Fishnets, as my container company, sure, that's a lot. But if I'm Docker,

01:26.560 --> 01:33.020
seems like 750 isn't a ton. Now, the thing is, about 130 of those are huge, ginormous

01:33.020 --> 01:37.460
Enterprise customers. So they're, they're big customers. So they're very valuable customers.

01:37.460 --> 01:41.760
And it's a good starting point. We've been wondering on the show, what was going to happen

01:41.760 --> 01:46.760
next with Docker, we've noted their struggles to raise funding to define their product.

01:46.760 --> 01:51.560
Everyone's managed to make money off Docker, except Docker. And looking at this, it seems

01:51.560 --> 01:57.320
like they've figured out a new strategy. And it's developers, developers, developers. Because

01:57.320 --> 02:03.080
looking at this, it seems like the split is the closed source stuff is going with Mirantis.

02:03.080 --> 02:07.080
And the open source stuff is staying with Docker proper. And they're going to refocus

02:07.080 --> 02:12.000
as a developer workflow, and applications tooling company.

02:12.000 --> 02:16.160
But I don't understand how they managed to get $35 million for that. I don't understand

02:16.160 --> 02:21.320
the business model. They didn't have a successful business model before. And now they've sold

02:21.320 --> 02:26.800
the only bit that was making them any money. And somehow they managed to raise $35 million

02:26.800 --> 02:31.560
worth of VC. For what? How are they going to make money out of that?

02:31.560 --> 02:36.320
Well, the funding came from Steve Ballmer, who's focused on funding companies who focus

02:36.320 --> 02:40.520
on develop... Okay, all right, too much. No, they got actually the money from Benchmark

02:40.520 --> 02:46.280
Capital and Insight Partners. 35 million is no joke, for sure. That's a lot of money.

02:46.280 --> 02:52.520
I think it is the defining, quote unquote, of the company, like redefining around development

02:52.520 --> 02:57.800
workflow. In their announcement, they write, Today, we start the next chapter in the Docker

02:57.800 --> 03:03.480
story, one that is focused on developers. And then later on in the post, they note,

03:03.480 --> 03:09.240
Docker's focus is to build on these foundations to advance developer workflows for modern

03:09.240 --> 03:15.260
apps. I think they truly see themselves as the de facto server application distribution

03:15.260 --> 03:22.740
platform. Write in your environment, guarantee it works, Docker it all up, and ship it off

03:22.740 --> 03:28.360
to your customers. Customers being a loose definition of anybody who's the consumer of

03:28.360 --> 03:29.360
what you're making.

03:29.360 --> 03:34.800
Right. And I don't see any reason why Docker won't continue to be well used, but I don't

03:34.800 --> 03:37.080
see any revenue model there.

03:37.080 --> 03:47.240
Yeah, I have to agree with you. I wish I could come up with something. Dang it, Joe.

03:47.240 --> 03:52.560
Mirantis have said that they will continue to support the Docker Enterprise products.

03:52.560 --> 03:58.720
But with Docker Swarm, the orchestration software, they're only committing to two years of that

03:58.720 --> 04:05.400
support. So it seems like the plan is to kind of shepherd those customers over to Kubernetes,

04:05.400 --> 04:07.840
which is what most of the industry is doing anyway, right?

04:07.840 --> 04:13.920
Yeah, they talk about joining their technology with Kubernetes and bringing, quote, simplicity

04:13.920 --> 04:21.640
and choice to enterprises with a cloud first mandate, end quote. So I think Kubernetes

04:21.640 --> 04:27.160
has won this round is what is happening here. It'll give them a nice transition path likely

04:27.160 --> 04:31.360
if you're using Docker Swarm. And you still got two years of support. And in their frequently

04:31.360 --> 04:36.000
asked questions, if you want to get support tomorrow morning when you're at work, you

04:36.000 --> 04:39.720
just call the same rep you've always called. They'll still answer the phone. They're still

04:39.720 --> 04:45.800
working for them. And that's great for those people. A lot of times, some of these mergers,

04:45.800 --> 04:50.680
some of these positions, like the sales positions and the support positions, they get reduced

04:50.680 --> 04:54.800
because there's redundancy. So it's nice to see that if you've been working with a rep

04:54.800 --> 04:59.720
for the last couple of years, that same reps going to answer the phone, at least they say.

04:59.720 --> 05:05.240
Here we are another day, another speculative execution vulnerability. Two, in fact.

05:05.240 --> 05:09.640
Yeah, Joe, we're getting two for the price of one this week. I think Intel's feeling

05:09.640 --> 05:15.160
the holiday spirit. Two different speculative execution attacks. We don't always bring these

05:15.160 --> 05:21.000
up. But these ones are noteworthy, both in what they do, but also in just the depth of

05:21.000 --> 05:26.960
which Intel has to try to patch this thing. So let's talk about these two bucks. So Riddle

05:26.960 --> 05:32.800
and Fallout, the attacks leak data by exploding four newly discovered micro architectural

05:32.800 --> 05:41.280
data sampling side channel vulnerabilities, or MDS is for short, in Intel CPUs. Unlike

05:41.280 --> 05:45.660
existing attacks, we've talked about before these new attacks leak arbitrary in flight

05:45.660 --> 05:53.000
data from CPU internal buffers, including data that was never stored in CPU caches.

05:53.000 --> 05:57.880
In the research, they show that existing defenses against speculative execution attacks are

05:57.880 --> 06:05.400
inadequate. And in some cases, they actually make things worse attackers can use the leaked

06:05.400 --> 06:10.880
sensitive data despite the mitigations in place. And due to vulnerabilities, they're

06:10.880 --> 06:16.880
so deep inside the CPU, they can get access to quite a bit. For an example, the Fallout

06:16.880 --> 06:21.520
attack can be used to break kernel address space layout randomization, which is a big

06:21.520 --> 06:26.840
one for getting access to information in RAM. They also show the riddle defense can allow

06:26.840 --> 06:31.680
unprivileged code on machines as with recent CPUs that are patched that can execute that

06:31.680 --> 06:37.600
code. It's really bad because the fix is more than just a simple firmware thing. And in

06:37.600 --> 06:42.840
some of these, we thought this was already addressed. But now here we are. And it turns

06:42.840 --> 06:46.720
out not all of this was as fixed as Intel might have led us to believe.

06:46.720 --> 06:52.120
We've been talking about these since late 2017, early 2018. And there have been a lot

06:52.120 --> 06:58.480
of these different attacks and vulnerabilities. But there's always been a kind of theoretical

06:58.480 --> 07:05.840
element to them and a weighing up of the risk of do you really need to apply the patches,

07:05.840 --> 07:12.360
depending on the workload that you're using? And I think Intel have kind of hoped that

07:12.360 --> 07:16.660
it would just sort of go away and people would just think, well, this theoretical risk is

07:16.660 --> 07:21.980
there, but it's a pretty small risk. But now with the latest round of vulnerabilities,

07:21.980 --> 07:27.800
it's starting to feel a bit more real and a bit of a higher risk. And maybe Intel's

07:27.800 --> 07:34.620
strategy of not fixing this at the hardware level quickly, and maybe even delaying the

07:34.620 --> 07:39.000
new generations of their chips until they'd fixed it. Maybe that is turning out to be

07:39.000 --> 07:41.160
not such a great idea.

07:41.160 --> 07:47.700
So I see it as two things. It's possible Intel is working on the next generation that solves

07:47.700 --> 07:54.080
a lot of this at the hardware level, but it's a little ways out and they don't want to hurt

07:54.080 --> 08:00.220
sales of existing products in the pipeline. That's possible. Or it's possible that Intel

08:00.220 --> 08:06.360
is just planning to try to fix this with software and then get the speed up over time. And I

08:06.360 --> 08:10.300
think that was the one that none of us thought would actually be their long term play. We

08:10.300 --> 08:14.880
all kind of thought, OK, that'd be the move for the processors on the market right now.

08:14.880 --> 08:19.560
But by the time 2020 is around, we'll have a new architecture, some improvements that

08:19.560 --> 08:22.960
will fix this and everything will be good. And these software patches will be just a

08:22.960 --> 08:24.680
thing of these generations.

08:24.680 --> 08:29.800
Now it looks like that might have been wishful thinking. And it's not like Intel can just

08:29.800 --> 08:36.220
reinvent this overnight. These are things they've built up over many, many generations.

08:36.220 --> 08:42.240
So software has been made with assumptions that some of these features are in place.

08:42.240 --> 08:46.600
Maybe Intel has looked at it and said, this is the only route. Better make sure everybody

08:46.600 --> 08:51.380
is using LVFS or something similar.

08:51.380 --> 08:55.640
But the way they've treated the security researchers is not great, really.

08:55.640 --> 09:00.860
Yeah, that is concerning. Yeah. And also the open source community. They've made some improvements

09:00.860 --> 09:06.860
in a lot of ways, but projects are still not super happy. And just recently, Greg KH from

09:06.860 --> 09:10.680
the kernel was talking about how if you really, truly want to be secure, not only do you need

09:10.680 --> 09:14.440
all these microcode fixes, but you also just need to turn off hyperthreading.

09:14.440 --> 09:20.720
Yeah, which significantly impacts performance and just makes your cloud instances much more

09:20.720 --> 09:22.160
expensive to run.

09:22.160 --> 09:27.060
Yeah. When Intel does a release like this, they work with 300 different organizations

09:27.060 --> 09:31.040
to prepare and coordinate the release of their own spins of Intel's updates. They have a

09:31.040 --> 09:35.400
whole ecosystem of partners. But then you think about it, they have a stack of software.

09:35.400 --> 09:40.160
It's not just CPU microcode, but there's also microcode in the GPU and in the different

09:40.160 --> 09:45.260
buses. There's like chips in there, Joe. They all need updates, like all kinds of chips

09:45.260 --> 09:47.360
that do different things. They call it the microchip.

09:47.360 --> 09:53.020
Yeah, and we're talking about an operating system on these CPUs, essentially. It's basically

09:53.020 --> 09:55.240
a computer within your computer.

09:55.240 --> 10:01.840
It's crazy. And so they're coordinating across all of these different companies, across these

10:01.840 --> 10:07.760
software stacks, and trying to patch this thing and go after it. And they kind of implied

10:07.760 --> 10:11.820
six months ago that some of this stuff was fixed that turns out now isn't. We'll have

10:11.820 --> 10:16.620
some links in the show notes for lots of good details. I actually encourage some homework

10:16.620 --> 10:20.600
on this one because the MDS attacks are pretty interesting. You can go read that directly

10:20.600 --> 10:26.680
at mdsattacks.com. They have a really quick write up. It's not super flashy. They're not

10:26.680 --> 10:31.240
like trying to sell merch. It's just some solid research from some universities and

10:31.240 --> 10:33.920
a little bit of corporate research too.

10:33.920 --> 10:37.520
Well maybe one solution is just to switch to ARM, and that's at the heart of the Pine

10:37.520 --> 10:41.400
Phone, which you can now buy, at least as we record.

10:41.400 --> 10:47.280
The Braveheart Edition, which they stress is a limited edition aimed solely for developers

10:47.280 --> 10:52.560
and early adopters, those who like to tinker. It's called the Braveheart Edition, and I

10:52.560 --> 10:58.000
love it. They say estimated dispatches in late December, early January 2020.

10:58.000 --> 11:00.560
You're saying this is for people who like to mess with computers.

11:00.560 --> 11:08.320
I think it is indeed. I pre-ordered one, $150 US greenbacks as we record. A couple of notable

11:08.320 --> 11:14.960
things about it. It has a 1440 by 720 screen with an 18 by 9 aspect ratio. It's got a 64

11:14.960 --> 11:20.160
bit quad core, 1.2 gigahertz ARM, Cortex A53, and a Mali 400 GPU.

11:20.160 --> 11:26.400
Yeah, this is pretty low end, but it's designed to run proper Linux, things like Ubuntu Touch

11:26.400 --> 11:29.760
or Postmarket OS. That's what makes this stand out.

11:29.760 --> 11:34.240
Yeah, in fact, it won't even ship with an OS. They write on here, various open source

11:34.240 --> 11:41.800
mainline Linux or BSD mobile OSes. Various. It's quaint. Pick your own, and you could.

11:41.800 --> 11:47.160
It's got 16 gigabytes of eMMC. It also has a microSD, so you can go up to two terabytes.

11:47.160 --> 11:50.740
It's got two gigabytes of RAM, so you could probably pretty comfortably run a lot of mobile

11:50.740 --> 11:56.680
operating systems. I think I'd probably go for Ubuntu Touch, my first attempt. I love

11:56.680 --> 12:02.020
that it has USB-C for both charging, but also it does DisplayPort out of that. You could

12:02.020 --> 12:03.800
even try some conversion section.

12:03.800 --> 12:07.360
Yeah, and it's even got a 3.5 mil headphone jack.

12:07.360 --> 12:09.360
How did they do that? Holy smokes.

12:09.360 --> 12:15.040
How did they fit that in there? I mean, this is not going to take on the latest iPhone

12:15.040 --> 12:20.040
or Android phone. It's not designed for that. The whole point of it is, it's basically a

12:20.040 --> 12:24.840
development device. It's a device for people who just want to tinker with the likes of

12:24.840 --> 12:32.000
Ubuntu Touch. It's kind of like almost a reference device for that. It's cheap, it's low spec,

12:32.000 --> 12:37.120
and it's all about the community in terms of the software for it. Pine are going to

12:37.120 --> 12:42.240
make the hardware as usual, and it's up to the community to put software on it.

12:42.240 --> 12:46.440
I've always dreamed of a line of mobile phones that you could load your own OS on like you

12:46.440 --> 12:52.440
can on a PC. The PC isn't perfectly free, but you can load just about any compatible

12:52.440 --> 12:57.640
operating system you want. It's an open platform in that sense. I see a world where you and

12:57.640 --> 13:00.960
I both have the same hardware, but we're running two different operating systems.

13:00.960 --> 13:06.240
Yeah, I could see that happening. I've ordered mine, so we will actually potentially be in

13:06.240 --> 13:08.960
that situation where we're both running different operating systems then.

13:08.960 --> 13:12.920
I guess so. I guess it won't be theoretical so soon. I think that's what I love about

13:12.920 --> 13:19.400
the Pine phone. It brings that down to a really approachable price. I could easily see them

13:19.400 --> 13:23.120
bringing that up over time as they get the device sorted, and they get the software sorted,

13:23.120 --> 13:28.440
and hardware refined. There's so much potential here. That's why we reached out to Lucas.

13:28.440 --> 13:33.880
We're going to have him on Linux Unplugged this week, on Tuesday's episode of Linux Unplugged,

13:33.880 --> 13:41.040
which will be episode 328, linuxunplugged.com. Don't go there yet, because there won't be

13:41.040 --> 13:42.920
anything, but in a couple of days there will.

13:42.920 --> 13:45.640
Maybe by the time you're listening, depending on when you catch this, or if you're way in

13:45.640 --> 13:47.120
the future, it's totally there.

13:47.120 --> 13:51.280
Well, they call it the Braveheart edition, and it's not the only Brave thing in the news

13:51.280 --> 13:52.840
this week.

13:52.840 --> 14:01.000
No, Brave has hit version 1.0. The Brave open source browser is out of beta.

14:01.000 --> 14:05.680
If we had a klaxon, I think it would sound at this point, blockchain, blockchain, blockchain.

14:05.680 --> 14:08.080
That's what this browser seems to all be about.

14:08.080 --> 14:13.360
Oh, okay, maybe a little bit. But they've kind of done it in a pretty slick way. So

14:13.360 --> 14:18.480
the blockchain is used for their BAT token, which is a unit of your attention. And it's

14:18.480 --> 14:23.420
also they use some sort of blockchain system for their syncing. So you link devices to

14:23.420 --> 14:29.040
a chain, and then they all sync amongst each other. That's really a cool way to do it.

14:29.040 --> 14:37.320
But the core of Brave is they are trying to find a way to monetize for creators in a way

14:37.320 --> 14:42.920
that doesn't violate privacy. And it isn't creepy. While building all of that into a

14:42.920 --> 14:47.000
really optimized, fast, blink-based browser.

14:47.000 --> 14:51.160
I kind of went all in over the weekend to test it for the story. I've never used their

14:51.160 --> 14:57.560
monetization stuff. And I thought, well, I'll give it a go. And it's not bad. They've done

14:57.560 --> 15:03.240
it in sort of a tasteful way. You can opt into certain ads. The selection is all done

15:03.240 --> 15:09.800
on device. It's not tracking you to do it. And you earn these points that you can tip

15:09.800 --> 15:16.120
creators with. So say, late night Linux was on there. Somebody who went to your website

15:16.120 --> 15:23.820
a lot could accumulate these tokens by viewing the private ads. And then they could tip those

15:23.820 --> 15:29.820
to you. You can then, with one of their partners, actually convert that into currency in your

15:29.820 --> 15:31.260
local neck of the woods.

15:31.260 --> 15:37.000
Which is something I've thought about before, but it just always seemed a bit of a pipe

15:37.000 --> 15:40.680
dream. Like, you're not really going to make that much money out of it. And it's not really

15:40.680 --> 15:43.960
worth it as a publisher to go through the effort of setting it up.

15:43.960 --> 15:46.160
If it got to a certain scale, I could see it.

15:46.160 --> 15:50.520
Yeah, I think there's a certain critical mass of users that would have to get there. And

15:50.520 --> 15:56.040
you have to be an early adopter at some point. But I used this browser to do all my research

15:56.040 --> 16:01.000
for this episode of Linux Session News. And went through the setup and everything. And

16:01.000 --> 16:06.920
it was pretty nice. And I could select the dark mode. And it was a nice browser to use.

16:06.920 --> 16:13.240
I didn't initially set up the reward stuff. But then I thought, well, I'll give that a

16:13.240 --> 16:17.840
go. And I tried to enable it. And then I just started to get all these notifications just

16:17.840 --> 16:23.040
for random stuff that just annoyed me. And I had a bit of a bad experience with it. I

16:23.040 --> 16:28.920
must say I had a good experience with the browser. The browser itself is lean, works

16:28.920 --> 16:35.720
well. I mean, it's Chromium blink based. So what do you expect? It worked perfectly. But

16:35.720 --> 16:40.840
when I started to go into that value add stuff, it just felt a bit spammy to me.

16:40.840 --> 16:44.360
Yeah, I found it better on the desktop. I found it a little too much on the mobile,

16:44.360 --> 16:50.160
so I was glad to see you could turn it down. Well, my experience was a lot more positive

16:50.160 --> 16:57.860
than I expected. I've tried a many blink based browsers. And also I spent a lot of time which

16:57.860 --> 17:04.680
is Chrome and Chromium. I am a very happy Firefox user except for a handful of websites

17:04.680 --> 17:12.940
I use that just work better under Chrome. They often have to do with audio and video.

17:12.940 --> 17:17.520
And they just work better under Chrome. And I keep slipping back to Chrome. And it is

17:17.520 --> 17:22.880
something that truly does bother me because I do feel like it's too invasive. It knows

17:22.880 --> 17:28.920
too much about what I'm doing. Brave does everything Chrome does for me. Everything's

17:28.920 --> 17:35.440
just as compatible. All of the extensions I like work. But none of the shame of using

17:35.440 --> 17:38.680
the Google tracking product. And that's why I was kind of impressed with the way they

17:38.680 --> 17:44.000
do the sync system. I was impressed with the speed. It seems to use less memory than Chrome

17:44.000 --> 17:51.020
does. For me, it's now the number one competitor to Firefox. They're doing and talking a lot

17:51.020 --> 17:54.800
of the same walk that Firefox is now, but they've been doing this for years. I mean,

17:54.800 --> 18:00.320
they're talking about building in automatic tracker blocking, brave shields. There's just

18:00.320 --> 18:07.640
like a heavy focus, a real intentional focus on privacy and security. A lot of what we're

18:07.640 --> 18:12.200
hearing coming out of Mozilla now, including surprise, surprise, a built in VPN.

18:12.200 --> 18:17.160
Well, we're talking about this coming out of beta finally getting to a 1.0. But the

18:17.160 --> 18:24.160
reality is this has been around since 2016, early 2016. And Mozilla have been watching

18:24.160 --> 18:29.560
it and copying some of the features and all the good stuff we've been saying about Firefox

18:29.560 --> 18:36.760
over the last year or so, with the privacy stuff, blocking of tracking. A lot of that

18:36.760 --> 18:43.320
has been inspired at least by brave. That's kind of good enough for me. I'm invested heavily

18:43.320 --> 18:51.080
in Firefox. And so I can't see myself switching to brave. I can see myself having it installed

18:51.080 --> 18:55.960
as a kind of secondary browser. But I do wonder whether it'll be able to do quite everything

18:55.960 --> 18:56.960
that Chrome does.

18:56.960 --> 19:00.840
Yeah, I agree. I don't think there's anything here that's going to draw people away from

19:00.840 --> 19:06.480
Firefox that are really longtime Firefox users. And Mozilla is making the right moves

19:06.480 --> 19:13.960
to sort of catch up. But there is some real nipping of the heels here. So with version

19:13.960 --> 19:21.280
1.0, here's some interesting stats. They have 3 million active users on a daily basis. That's

19:21.280 --> 19:29.080
a lot. When they last measured, they had 8.7 million monthly active users overall. And

19:29.080 --> 19:35.160
they've just released 1.0 on Android, iOS, Windows 10, Mac OS, Linux, all the platforms.

19:35.160 --> 19:40.500
They just did a nice, solid execution of a really solid 1.0. So they're kind of just

19:40.500 --> 19:44.500
getting started. I know we've talked about brave a lot. One of the things that caught

19:44.500 --> 19:48.480
my attention was when they switched off of running on Electron. That was a huge move

19:48.480 --> 19:56.080
back in 2018. And then in June of 2019, they rewrote their ad blocking rule matching algorithm

19:56.080 --> 20:03.460
and implemented it in Rust. And there's claims that things like 69 times faster than implementations

20:03.460 --> 20:12.080
that are in C++. And they used the algorithms of uBlock Origin and Ghostery, two of my favorites,

20:12.080 --> 20:16.760
to kind of design their algorithm. Only it's crazy fast. There's just things about brave

20:16.760 --> 20:22.440
that for Chrome users are very compelling. And I think that's who their market is, is

20:22.440 --> 20:27.000
this is a Chrome browser without the shame and a lot of nice privacy stuff built in.

20:27.000 --> 20:33.400
And maybe, given the heritage of this project, a possible way to monetize creators. Because

20:33.400 --> 20:38.360
it's not slouches involved with this project either. There's real experience behind this

20:38.360 --> 20:39.360
browser.

20:39.360 --> 20:43.440
Well, yeah. Brendan Eich, who was a co-founder of Mozilla and invented JavaScript, we're

20:43.440 --> 20:48.040
talking about someone who has some very serious experience in this area.

20:48.040 --> 20:52.240
And they're executing really well. I was really impressed. The last time I checked in with

20:52.240 --> 20:55.300
brave, I was like, oh, yeah, it's nice. And I didn't reinstall it the next time I reloaded

20:55.300 --> 21:01.640
my system. So it's been since their change away from Electron that I checked it out.

21:01.640 --> 21:07.300
So a little over a year now. And I am not installing Chrome anymore. I'm installing

21:07.300 --> 21:09.840
brave now. I also really like the mobile app.

21:09.840 --> 21:12.600
I didn't try the mobile app. Maybe I should give it a go.

21:12.600 --> 21:16.160
Yeah, get a little blockchain action going there, Joe. I love me some syncing. It's just

21:16.160 --> 21:20.420
something about doing some research like on your phone and you create a quick bookmark

21:20.420 --> 21:24.160
folder and you go back to your desktop to finish it up and it's all right there. And

21:24.160 --> 21:28.400
the icons for the favicons are all in there and everything's perfect. And just I love

21:28.400 --> 21:33.040
it. And they're not the only one to do it. But I like that it's I like this way they

21:33.040 --> 21:35.880
link them. You'll have to you'll have to try it to see what I'm talking about. You do have

21:35.880 --> 21:41.720
to scan a QR code from your phone on your screen. Here's a little bit of manual process.

21:41.720 --> 21:44.360
But it feels feels really well done.

21:44.360 --> 21:50.060
Well, a launch that looks like it's not going to go very well is Google's stadia game streaming

21:50.060 --> 21:55.480
service, which is supposed to be happening pretty much as you listen to this. Now, Chris,

21:55.480 --> 22:00.200
you preordered the founders edition. Are you excited for this?

22:00.200 --> 22:04.660
I still am. However, I kind of agree with the verges headline, the whole world is waiting

22:04.660 --> 22:09.360
for stadia to flop. It's a real issue for Google because it's one of these services

22:09.360 --> 22:13.640
that's going to take a couple of years to fully mature from a game development standpoint,

22:13.640 --> 22:18.800
but also from just a service feature standpoint. But I bet you a lot of people don't even think

22:18.800 --> 22:23.140
this thing will last two years because of Google's reputation for killing projects.

22:23.140 --> 22:26.920
And then when it when it comes to something where you're going to buy games and they're

22:26.920 --> 22:35.280
going to be in a library that's in stadia, it really gets kind of uncomfortable because

22:35.280 --> 22:41.960
there's a lack of trust that Google will keep this thing around. And it looks like on launch,

22:41.960 --> 22:48.240
it's not quite what we were expecting. Chrome gameplay won't support 4k HDR or five one

22:48.240 --> 22:52.800
surround they'll be added in updates later. So that sort of stinks because that's how

22:52.800 --> 23:00.280
I was planning to play. This is via Intel graphics laptops on Linux in a Chrome browser.

23:00.280 --> 23:04.240
So I won't get full resolution. That's a little unfortunate. There's other things that don't

23:04.240 --> 23:08.280
work like some of the sharing features for me. The one that bothers me the most is family

23:08.280 --> 23:13.140
sharing won't be available. It won't be supported on day one. So you'll have to buy each game

23:13.140 --> 23:17.320
for each of your kids. This is going to be a big thing for me is I have family sharing

23:17.320 --> 23:23.400
across my Google accounts. It was implied that this would be a supported feature. And

23:23.400 --> 23:27.360
it simply isn't. It's really kind of, I don't know, it's a little underwhelming. Also, I

23:27.360 --> 23:31.720
probably the number one killer thing, Joe is they're only going to have 12 games that

23:31.720 --> 23:32.720
launch.

23:32.720 --> 23:37.320
Yeah, that's not ideal. And you've got that Nvidia shield in the living room area in the

23:37.320 --> 23:42.360
studio with that enormous TV and the nice sound system, everything. You're not going

23:42.360 --> 23:44.120
to be able to use it on that straight away.

23:44.120 --> 23:49.880
Now, I can unplug my shield and hook up the Chromecast Ultra that comes with the Founders

23:49.880 --> 23:54.240
Edition. That's another issue, by the way. Other Chromecast Ultra units that are in the

23:54.240 --> 23:57.900
market today, they're out in the field that people own, they won't play Stadia games.

23:57.900 --> 24:03.160
My Chromecast Ultra will, but existing Ultras will not until an over the air update comes

24:03.160 --> 24:10.400
along sometime after the launch of Stadia. It's just not great. Now the dozen games thing,

24:10.400 --> 24:14.740
the reason why I think that's so low, this is my speculation, but it's because they are

24:14.740 --> 24:19.720
requiring developers to make modifications to the game. They're not just taking straight

24:19.720 --> 24:24.660
PC or console ports, which some YouTubers are reporting. They are actually having development

24:24.660 --> 24:31.720
shops modify the games to work with the Stadia system. And that, that's really hard. I watched

24:31.720 --> 24:36.960
a lot of interviews with different members of the Stadia team. And I think what happened

24:36.960 --> 24:41.080
here is they engineered the hell out of this thing. They came up with some incredible solutions

24:41.080 --> 24:45.880
to solve latency. They came up with some great tricks to run the games faster on the server,

24:45.880 --> 24:50.520
but still send you 60 frames a second so they can be ahead of you. They really ironed out

24:50.520 --> 24:57.640
some Herculean and coding issues that are magic. But in doing all of this, I don't really

24:57.640 --> 25:03.000
think they focused on game partnerships and development shop partnerships. And so where

25:03.000 --> 25:07.680
the Microsoft service, when it launches, we'll launch with more than 50 titles. Stadia is

25:07.680 --> 25:12.600
going to launch tomorrow with a dozen. And I don't know for sure, but I bet a lot of

25:12.600 --> 25:16.400
them would probably just work under Proton and I wouldn't need this.

25:16.400 --> 25:21.280
Yeah, I think that what we've got here is Google wanting to be first to market because

25:21.280 --> 25:27.940
that's always very important. And the xCloud service from Microsoft is still in preview.

25:27.940 --> 25:32.440
And so it hasn't officially launched, whereas Stadia will launch tomorrow. It will be the

25:32.440 --> 25:38.240
first to market of the big players at least. Obviously, there's been plenty of game streaming

25:38.240 --> 25:44.160
services in the past that have just not really worked out and ultimately failed. But of the

25:44.160 --> 25:49.680
big players, they're going to be first. And maybe it's just not ready. I mean, it certainly

25:49.680 --> 25:50.920
sounds that way.

25:50.920 --> 25:58.760
I know it sounds crazy, but I had a great experience with OnLive back in 2010. It worked

25:58.760 --> 26:02.800
great for me. And I've used other streaming services. There's one on my NVIDIA Shield

26:02.800 --> 26:07.680
and it's been fantastic for me. I played like a whole Batman game and it was fun. We really

26:07.680 --> 26:13.640
enjoyed it. Never had to download any software, never had to try to load a Windows Proton

26:13.640 --> 26:17.080
environment. It's just great. It worked and I loved it. Never concerned, never had an

26:17.080 --> 26:22.720
issue with lag. And those are existing services that are on the market today. Google has quite

26:22.720 --> 26:27.080
the networking infrastructure. So they could, from a networking standpoint, they can really

26:27.080 --> 26:31.800
pull this thing off. But something else that they're doing, which is very clever, is because

26:31.800 --> 26:37.760
they have the horsepower. They're running these games at 120 frames per second and they're

26:37.760 --> 26:45.160
sending you 60. So they're using that difference to compensate for lag or to figure out what

26:45.160 --> 26:52.320
you're doing next. They're ahead of you, essentially. And it's just enough of a window that they

26:52.320 --> 26:57.600
can do some really cool tech. And you could see how they could integrate this across their

26:57.600 --> 27:03.080
product line with Android, with YouTube. So you're watching a play through on YouTube

27:03.080 --> 27:07.720
and one link in the show description and now you're playing the game inside your browser.

27:07.720 --> 27:13.000
The Chromebooks, this turns all Chromebooks into gaming machines overnight once this thing's

27:13.000 --> 27:17.360
done. There's a lot of tie-ins across their entire ecosystem with Google Play and Google

27:17.360 --> 27:21.200
Store credits and all of that where you can use Google Play credits to buy games that

27:21.200 --> 27:25.000
you can play on Stadia. If they don't make this work, it's shameful.

27:25.000 --> 27:31.160
Yeah. And if they don't make it work, then is this finally curtains for the idea of it?

27:31.160 --> 27:36.160
Because as you say, you had good experiences before, but the economics just did not make

27:36.160 --> 27:43.040
sense. How much is just one GPU? Hundreds of dollars. And in order to have all of that

27:43.040 --> 27:48.600
infrastructure, there's so much investment there that they're not going to get back directly

27:48.600 --> 27:54.120
through revenue. So they're going to have to monetize it in other ways. And maybe that's

27:54.120 --> 27:58.400
where everyone else failed and maybe Google will succeed because they can just mine data

27:58.400 --> 28:03.880
and somehow make more money out of it. But it just seems like the whole concept is just

28:03.880 --> 28:05.680
doomed to failure to me.

28:05.680 --> 28:11.200
Keep in mind, the free version of Stadia doesn't launch until sometime next year. In my mind,

28:11.200 --> 28:14.320
that's when the rubber really has to meet the road. That's when the service becomes

28:14.320 --> 28:18.600
available to everyone, is once it goes free. You'll have to pay for games, although there'll

28:18.600 --> 28:22.440
probably be a couple that are decent that are included for free. But that's really when

28:22.440 --> 28:27.500
this thing goes live. This is like a pre-launch. You've had to pay for a founder's edition.

28:27.500 --> 28:31.800
They're trickling the shipments out. They're not landing on launch day like the impression

28:31.800 --> 28:36.160
was. Mine doesn't show up until somewhere between December 2nd and December 8th or something

28:36.160 --> 28:37.160
like that.

28:37.160 --> 28:39.520
What, you mean a Google employee is not going to drive it to your house?

28:39.520 --> 28:42.960
You heard about that. Yeah, that's rough. Yeah, that's how... There's just been a lot

28:42.960 --> 28:47.720
of... Google has a hard time shipping, as they put it, atoms. As they say, they're great

28:47.720 --> 28:53.480
at bits, and they struggle with shipping atoms. Fair enough. It does seem to be the case.

28:53.480 --> 28:59.460
I don't know what their deal is. I think if they stick with this thing for the long term,

28:59.460 --> 29:03.340
they really could have something. If they integrate it across all of the Google products,

29:03.340 --> 29:08.260
they make it simple to game from Chrome and YouTube, easy to link people right to a state

29:08.260 --> 29:12.240
in a game, all of the stuff that they promised, they actually make their wireless controllers

29:12.240 --> 29:17.160
truly wireless and not require a USB-C cable when you use them. There's all these things

29:17.160 --> 29:21.000
they can do that are technically doable once this thing's a service, because they don't

29:21.000 --> 29:25.400
have to ship you a console for any of this. It's really just a matter of them pulling

29:25.400 --> 29:30.920
it off. If I was going to bet on one, though, I'd bet on Microsoft. I'd bet on Microsoft.

29:30.920 --> 29:33.840
I know Sony's working on theirs, but I'd bet on Microsoft.

29:33.840 --> 29:38.840
Yeah, I think I have to agree with you there. I do want Google to succeed with this, because

29:38.840 --> 29:44.880
it's all run in Linux in their data centers. Ultimately, we will all as a community benefit

29:44.880 --> 29:51.280
at least in some ways with graphics drivers and just generally upstreaming of at least

29:51.280 --> 29:53.360
some of the stuff to make this work.

29:53.360 --> 29:58.080
That's fundamentally it. Because Google requires that the game manufacturers make their games

29:58.080 --> 30:03.760
run on Linux using Vulkan, the hope is it opens up a wider set of games to be published

30:03.760 --> 30:10.040
on Linux. Stady is the streaming platform that enables that. I really, really, really,

30:10.040 --> 30:13.440
really doubt that's the case for Sony's, and I know it's not the case for Microsoft's.

30:13.440 --> 30:16.760
Well, you're definitely going to have to tell us all about your experiences when it does

30:16.760 --> 30:17.760
finally arrive.

30:17.760 --> 30:21.580
Yeah, they point out you don't have to wait for the hardware. Once it ships and you get

30:21.580 --> 30:26.480
your email, your account's active. It's a service, so you could go play in Chrome and

30:26.480 --> 30:30.880
just wait for your controller to show up later. So I will, Joe. I'll play video games and

30:30.880 --> 30:32.780
report packs so you don't have to.
