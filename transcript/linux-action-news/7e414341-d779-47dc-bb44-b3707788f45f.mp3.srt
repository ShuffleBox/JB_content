00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,280
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, our weekly take on Linux and the open source world.

2
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:20,520
This is episode 72, recorded on September 23rd, 2018.

3
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:21,520
I'm Joe.

4
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:22,520
And I'm Wes.

5
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:23,520
Hello, Wes.

6
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:24,760
Thank you for joining me again.

7
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:28,000
Chris might be back next week, we'll have to see, but I'll have to put up with you in

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000
the meantime.

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,640
So let's start with some news from Mozilla.

10
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:39,340
They have released Firefox Reality 1.0, which is their virtual reality browser.

11
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:44,400
You can get it today for the HTC Vive, Oculus, or a Daydream headset.

12
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:47,640
Now unfortunately, I don't own any of those, do you?

13
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:54,240
I have one of the little off-market rebranded headsets, so I did install and give it a go.

14
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:58,720
Wasn't a great experience for me because my hardware was so bad, but it's an intriguing

15
00:00:58,720 --> 00:00:59,720
concept.

16
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:00,720
It is intriguing.

17
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:05,240
And I think that it shows that Mozilla don't want to be left behind on this one.

18
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:10,760
They were left behind on the mobile market to quite a large extent, certainly with Firefox

19
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:12,440
OS, which never really took off.

20
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:19,640
Okay, it's kind of carrying on as KaiOS, but it shows that they are taking this VR thing

21
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:20,640
seriously.

22
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:25,400
And it might be a fad, it might not be a fad, it might be the future, who knows?

23
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:28,080
And I think that they have to kind of do this, don't they?

24
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:31,200
They have to be there at the beginning of it.

25
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:35,200
Yeah, if you're not at the stage where it feels like, well, maybe this is a risky bet,

26
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:39,080
who knows if this is going to take off any time soon, well, then you're probably joined

27
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:40,080
too late.

28
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:46,000
And right now, the VR space is pretty dominated by some heavy, large corporation-like entities.

29
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,640
It's nice to see Mozilla getting an open source foot in the door early.

30
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:51,760
It's a little bit bare bones at this stage, though, isn't it?

31
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:55,800
There's no bookmarks, for example, which, does that really matter?

32
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:56,800
Does anyone use bookmarks?

33
00:01:56,800 --> 00:02:01,360
Okay, I use bookmarks quite a lot, but I hear that some people don't, but that is coming

34
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:03,080
soon, hopefully.

35
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:07,720
It looks like some of this work has been possible thanks to their new GeckoView component.

36
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:12,560
We talked a little about that last week in LAN Episode 71, and that means they haven't

37
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:15,000
had to redo a bunch of labor to create this.

38
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,780
Instead, there's a common core that they can share with Firefox Focus and some of the other

39
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:22,640
Firefox technologies that they already have on these platforms.

40
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:24,920
And there is a privacy mode as well, isn't there?

41
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:27,080
I wonder what that might be used for.

42
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:31,000
I can think of quite a few things, Joe.

43
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Yes.

44
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,160
Well, let's move on.

45
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:37,400
Let's talk about AMP, accelerated mobile pages.

46
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:43,280
Now, Google has come in for a lot of criticism regarding AMP, including from me, about how

47
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:51,540
they have had quite a tight control over it and are basically forcing the mobile web onto

48
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:54,960
their servers and onto their standards.

49
00:02:54,960 --> 00:03:00,200
They have always maintained that it is open source and supposedly open standards, but

50
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:04,160
the governance model was very much top down from Google.

51
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:09,360
Well, now they have decided that they're going to go for a new governance model.

52
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:15,400
They say they want this new model to explicitly give a voice to all constituents of the community,

53
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:18,720
including those who cannot contribute code themselves, such as end users.

54
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:22,240
Yeah, they certainly want to try and make it more inclusive.

55
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:26,000
I'm not sure about individuals, but they certainly want more companies to get involved with this

56
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,160
so that it is not just a purely Google project.

57
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:33,120
At least that's the impression they want to give here.

58
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:36,340
Sounds like a couple reasonably sized players have signed on.

59
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:39,440
People like Washington Post, eBay, and Cloudflare.

60
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:45,280
That's a good mix of e-commerce sites, publishers, and then actual hosting platforms.

61
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:49,080
One of the biggest problems though has been so far, Google's really the only one that

62
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:53,320
serves a big AMP cache, so all of your AMP pages come from Google.

63
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:55,160
Will any of these other sites step in?

64
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:58,960
Cloudflare looks like one that could be a possibility, but I don't know, is two of the

65
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:01,960
biggest providers really that much more diversity?

66
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:07,480
Well, it's certainly a good start and Cloudflare, I would say, almost certainly have the resources

67
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:15,200
to do this, but I would like to see it being much less centralized because at the moment,

68
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:19,520
almost all AMP traffic goes through Google servers and therefore they have all the metrics

69
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:22,280
on that, all the data.

70
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:25,640
The thing is that the underlying technology is really good.

71
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:28,520
It's taking the mobile web back to basics.

72
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:33,600
It's stripping out a lot of the stuff that you don't need and making it super fast.

73
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:37,040
Everyone agrees that that is a good idea.

74
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:42,160
It's just the implementation that has been the problem so far and potentially with this

75
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:47,400
new governance model, getting more companies and people involved with it, we might get

76
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:51,920
to the stage where it's not all being funneled through Google's servers, but then you do

77
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:55,520
have to ask what's in it for Google at that point.

78
00:04:55,520 --> 00:05:00,200
How will this work if there is a big federated list of various caches you can use?

79
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:05,080
How do you pick who has control of that marketplace and why?

80
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:10,280
Are they going to be given equal footing on the Google search list because that's really

81
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:12,240
where all the traffic is driven from?

82
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:16,000
Right, and that's been one of the main things that made some publishing platforms feel like

83
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,520
they've really been pushed into supporting AMP, even though they do have such a loss

84
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:20,700
of control.

85
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:24,880
It's also good to see that they are taking inspiration from the likes of Node.js and

86
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:30,240
Kubernetes and looking at forming a foundation here, which really would separate it out from

87
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,240
Google.

88
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:32,920
All the verbiage sounds right to me.

89
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:36,240
I think there's some good principles here and everything they're saying is the way I

90
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:39,340
would want to see an open source project run.

91
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:42,580
Now there will be an AMP contributor summit next week.

92
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:46,080
Maybe there we will start to see, is there really interest from the broader community?

93
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:48,000
Is AMP a technology that can be saved?

94
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,280
Well, fingers crossed.

95
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:54,840
Another technology that originally came from mobile, the Ubuntu phone, Ubuntu Touch, was

96
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:59,720
MIR, and that is not dead, contrary to popular belief.

97
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:02,840
It's actually reached a 1.0.0 release this week.

98
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:06,720
1.0 is a big deal for just about any open source project.

99
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:11,360
The first blush, I was a little confused about just what was so important about this release.

100
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:15,960
I really think it's XDG shell support being stable.

101
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:19,580
You can build on that, you can depend on it, and really that means you can tie into the

102
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:22,360
Wayland world and build on top of MIR.

103
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:23,360
Well, exactly.

104
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,460
That's the exciting thing here.

105
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:31,320
It's potentially going to allow a lot of other projects to hook into Wayland.

106
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:37,260
And as we know, the X server is just, it's so old, there's so many security issues, Wayland

107
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:38,520
is the future.

108
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:43,520
It is the present for a lot of people on Fedora, for example, and we know that Ubuntu tried

109
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:49,540
it with the 17.10 release, but then reverted back to X for the LTS.

110
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:56,080
And I got some messages from unofficial canonical PR man, Martin Winpress, about this.

111
00:06:56,080 --> 00:07:01,680
And he told me that the Marte desktop are planning to use this to offer Wayland support.

112
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:06,080
And he told me to expect more about that in the coming weeks.

113
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:12,000
And at the canonical sprint that they've just had in Belgium this week, a minimal Marte

114
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,320
shell was demoed using this MIR and Wayland combination.

115
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:20,840
And he also told me that potentially LXQt might be going down the same route, although

116
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:25,480
I did ask someone in that community and he was very much silent, refused to answer on

117
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:26,480
that.

118
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:32,680
So I think they're still deciding, but it goes to show that this technology could potentially

119
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:39,600
open the door to Wayland for a lot of other desktop environments and people making distros.

120
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:44,560
I think that's been one difficulty moving past X is it's just been such an entrenched

121
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:45,800
ecosystem.

122
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:50,100
And while Wayland has a lot of neat technology baked into it, it just hasn't necessarily

123
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:53,800
been the right abstraction level for a lot of existing platforms.

124
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:56,800
Now the big guys, Gnome and Plasma, not a big deal.

125
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:01,200
They've implemented their own extensions and made it work, but we haven't seen the same

126
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:05,760
kind of proliferation of various desktop options that we've had in the good old days.

127
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:12,000
As they put it, MIR has both sensible default behavior and a simple yet powerful API.

128
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,240
So that sounds like just about the best building block I could hope for.

129
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:18,140
Do you think it's a little bit early for a 1.0 though?

130
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:21,080
Is that just a statement from them saying that it's not dead?

131
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:25,680
It does seem like it is a little bit of a statement and just having that Wayland extension

132
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:26,680
support.

133
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:30,280
It seems like this is a signal to the community that, hey, look, we still exist and we're

134
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:32,160
something that you should think about using.

135
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:36,480
Well, something that you shouldn't still be using at least not for much longer is Ubuntu

136
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:37,480
14.04.

137
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:42,840
But if you are, don't worry because you can pay Canonical or you will be able to pay Canonical

138
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:45,960
for extended maintenance.

139
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:47,760
And this isn't a real surprise, is it?

140
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:53,000
We saw this with 12.04 and now, again, we're seeing it with 14.04.

141
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:58,280
No doubt we'll see it with 16.04, but it's of note because it shows that that obviously

142
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:00,200
went well for them, 12.04.

143
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:03,440
It must have paid for itself at least.

144
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:09,800
And it shows that Canonical are very serious about being a serious enterprise player and

145
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:14,520
being able to compete with the likes of Red Hat for the huge long-term support that they

146
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:15,520
offer.

147
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:20,920
Clearly, this is marketed at big, slow-moving enterprises who do want to remain in compliance,

148
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:26,120
but you know, it's just a lot of work to upgrade your distro sometimes, guys, so why not spend

149
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:27,120
a little more money?

150
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:29,280
It looks like it is part of Ubuntu Advantage.

151
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:34,760
So if you're already paying for that service, well, most plans include ESM already.

152
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:40,880
Or if you want to buy in quantities of a thousand machines or above, it's $50 per node per year.

153
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:44,840
Which is not a great deal of money compared to the money that you would spend upgrading

154
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:45,840
it.

155
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:52,680
I mean, most of us think, okay, one server or whatever, going from 12.04 to 14.04 or

156
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:55,360
14 to 16, it's not a huge issue.

157
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:59,640
But if you've got a lot of machines or if you're running certain applications which

158
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:04,460
are just going to break, there's a lot of slow-moving infrastructure out there that

159
00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:06,960
just cannot upgrade.

160
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:12,800
And so that's why you end up with these Red Hat deployments that are 10 years old.

161
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:18,640
And if Canonical are really serious about IPIing or potentially selling the company,

162
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:22,080
then they need to be competitive with the likes of Red Hat.

163
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:24,400
And so here we are.

164
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:31,480
It's interesting to note that they say, contact Canonical sales to start planning for Ubuntu

165
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:36,040
14.04 end of life or talk about your Ubuntu 12.04 estate.

166
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:42,840
Because when they announced the 12.04 extended maintenance, they said that it would be good

167
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:48,240
through April 2019, they didn't say to April.

168
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,680
It's kind of confusing language.

169
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:54,120
They're a UK-based company mostly, and that's kind of an American way to put it.

170
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:56,080
So does that mean it was going to end then?

171
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:57,080
It looks like it isn't.

172
00:10:57,080 --> 00:11:02,040
It looks like they're going to continue to support 12.04 potentially, which is kind of

173
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:03,280
a big deal, isn't it?

174
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:07,000
It's a long, long time that they will have been supporting it.

175
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Yeah, you're right.

176
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
It is confusing.

177
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:13,140
And over on their Advantage page, it says ongoing security fixes for the kernel and

178
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:15,920
essential packages through April 2019.

179
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:17,720
But who knows quite what's going on?

180
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:21,360
I'm sure if you're a customer, they'll provide you a little more details.

181
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:26,860
It does seem pretty pragmatic to me because, well, unfortunately, this is going to happen.

182
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:29,440
People are going to take time to move off these distros.

183
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:32,200
And a lot of them will just be unpatched and won't have this access.

184
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:35,400
Now, if you're a big enough customer to get it, that just means there's less machines

185
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:37,360
out there running without patches.

186
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:38,360
And that makes me smile.

187
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:41,960
Yeah, it's definitely a good thing, but it's not the only news coming out of Canonical

188
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:42,960
this week.

189
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:48,640
There was a blog post by Will Cook, who I know from Late Night Linux, about running

190
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:53,760
Ubuntu VMs on Windows and how that has been made much, much easier.

191
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:57,840
It looks like they've done some digging in the Ubuntu report data and found out that

192
00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:00,800
actually a lot of people are using Ubuntu as a virtual machine.

193
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:04,240
Now that's probably not a huge surprise.

194
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:07,440
And for me, I was used to the experience to get in something like VirtualBox.

195
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:11,960
And having used Hyper-V a bit for some of the other distros I like to play with, well,

196
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:14,920
the experience just hasn't been quite the same.

197
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:20,560
But now it's going to be a first class experience with improved clipboard integration, dynamic

198
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:26,760
desktop resizing, and shared folders, and an improved mouse experience so you can move

199
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:29,000
between the guest and the host.

200
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:35,720
It seems that they've worked with Microsoft here to just make it a very smooth, very easy

201
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:36,720
experience.

202
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:37,720
Yeah, it's interesting.

203
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:42,280
Microsoft actually has contributed back upstream to the XRDP project, which is an open source

204
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:45,800
implementation of Microsoft's own remote desktop protocol.

205
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:50,980
So it looks like some of the new Microsoft in ball here contributed to open source, helping

206
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:54,160
make open source software run better on their platform.

207
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:58,760
And this is yet more evidence of Microsoft and Canonical cozying up together, isn't it?

208
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:04,920
We started with the subsystem for Linux, which was launched with just Ubuntu available.

209
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:09,320
And now we're getting this Hyper-V integration.

210
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:12,680
It feels like there's a real relationship building there.

211
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:15,600
And I think that that is going to worry a lot of people in the community.

212
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:21,200
Yeah, I mean, they even say in this article, or Will says, our friends over at Microsoft.

213
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:24,120
So you can tell these barriers have been broken down.

214
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:27,080
They've worked on, collaborated on many projects now.

215
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:31,080
So it's not a relationship that easily falls by the wayside, especially when both sides

216
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:34,060
of the relationship stand to benefit here.

217
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:36,240
How do you feel about this?

218
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:37,240
Does it worry you?

219
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:39,000
Does it make you uncomfortable?

220
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Do you remember the Microsoft of old or do you believe the hype that Microsoft has changed

221
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
now?

222
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,740
I mean, I've definitely noticed a lot of changes just in the ways they're spending their time

223
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:51,680
and the people who work there now, whether or not it's permanent, it's hard to say, right?

224
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:53,700
I mean, corporations are fluid.

225
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:57,880
They're made of people that leave and come and go and cultures change over time.

226
00:13:57,880 --> 00:14:02,760
But I do think we should be at least somewhat open minded to appreciating the Microsoft

227
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:06,520
we have at present and be willing to work with them where it makes sense.

228
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:09,400
They've shown they're willing to put in some time and effort to open source.

229
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:13,040
And I don't think that we shouldn't think that they are some angel that no longer has

230
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:14,400
their own interests in mind.

231
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:17,760
So we should view it through, you know, they want to make money and have a good place in

232
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:18,760
the market.

233
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:22,440
There just might be some opportunities for open source to benefit at the same time.

234
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:23,920
Well, they're following the money, aren't they?

235
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:26,440
I always say this, the money's in open source.

236
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:32,200
And keeping people on Windows means they're more likely to tie in with Microsoft services

237
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:38,920
like Azure and making the Linux experience on the Windows desktop flawless.

238
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:42,520
Well, that's a good way to do that, isn't it?

239
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:43,520
Yes.

240
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:46,000
I know there is some worry that, you know, there might just be people that don't need

241
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:51,720
to run full Linux anymore, or they won't need to run it, you know, booted from bare metal.

242
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:56,920
And that may be very true, but there's a number of people stuck on Windows already that can't

243
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:57,920
do that.

244
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:00,120
Maybe their enterprise doesn't let them install things like VirtualBox.

245
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:05,000
Well, Hyper-V is a lot better now, or they have been forced to use an external VM running

246
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,040
on some other infrastructure and suffered for that.

247
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:13,680
So in a pragmatic sense, yes, I am a little bit worried that there might be less people

248
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:17,940
out there booting up from a live USB for the first time.

249
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:21,880
But if they're still getting to experience the joys of using open source technology,

250
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:24,840
especially on the command line, that makes me happy.

251
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:29,520
Well, I mentioned the Windows subsystem for Linux, and we've had more news about that

252
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:30,520
this week.

253
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:36,600
There's a new distro available, and it is the first distro that has been specifically

254
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:41,280
built for the Windows subsystem for Linux, and it's called WLinux.

255
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:44,840
It feels a little strange even calling this a Linux distribution.

256
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:49,800
It's certainly a distribution of open source software, but it's not even at this point

257
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:52,240
intended to run on a real Linux kernel.

258
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:56,360
Yeah, it's funny that, isn't it, that it's everything but Linux, and yet people still

259
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:57,360
call it Linux.

260
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:02,640
It's almost like RMS was right, isn't it, calling it GNU slash Linux, and him saying

261
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:04,080
that Linux is just the kernel.

262
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:11,200
But yeah, I spoke to Hayden Barnes about this today, and he is the developer of WLinux,

263
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:14,720
and he has got a very pragmatic approach here.

264
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:20,920
He's taken Debian and customized it to work as well as it possibly can on the subsystem,

265
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:24,240
and one of the first things that he did was remove system D.

266
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:25,880
Get it right out of here, Joe.

267
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:27,320
You don't need it on Windows.

268
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:29,000
Well, apparently not, no.

269
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:34,320
In many ways, this seems like a first, a distribution focused solely on the subsystem.

270
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:38,320
There's a lot of ways left where the subsystem is just not a complete implementation of the

271
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:44,920
whole kernel interface, so it might make sense to see this tailored, updated, they even talk

272
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:48,400
about how they might be able to respond to some certain security issues or other bugs

273
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:53,160
that are present in upstream software, patch them here before they get fixes all the way

274
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:58,320
back in upstream, which, as you might imagine, patches specifically for running on the subsystem,

275
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:59,920
well, they don't always get prioritized.

276
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:05,440
Well, I asked Hayden what sets this apart from standard Debian, which of course is available

277
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:12,000
on the subsystem, and he said, well, apart from being made from some parts of Debian

278
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:16,800
stable and some from Debian testing, it's also the customizations that he's made here

279
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:24,760
that mean that instead of just kind of sticking a Linux distro on top of Windows, it really

280
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:30,720
is designed from the ground up to work with it, and that's how he justifies the $20 price

281
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:31,720
tag.

282
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:36,200
And I think it markets something that you really have to be a Windows subsystem user

283
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:40,880
to think about, because for me, I might just install Debian or Ubuntu, because I know Linux,

284
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:45,560
I like working with a full Linux distribution, but I think for a lot of subsystem users,

285
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:46,560
that's not really their goal.

286
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:50,520
They just want to have access to things like developer tools, which are pre-installed on

287
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:54,780
WLinux, they don't want to have to futz around with trying to get graphical apps working

288
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:59,940
when they might not be a Linux graphics expert, which, hey, not all of us are.

289
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:04,480
So if you're willing to just shell out $20 to know that you can get all of the developer

290
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:07,820
tools you might need for, let's say, your day job or the open source project you're

291
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:13,620
working on without having to leave the comfort of your Windows workstation, well, it doesn't

292
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:14,960
seem like that much.

293
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:19,280
One thing he did say regarding the price to me was that in various other countries, the

294
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:23,160
price is going to be lower or even potentially nothing.

295
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:28,840
He mentioned developing countries, it would be cheaper, which is interesting that in the

296
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:31,840
UK, it's only $10 rather than $20.

297
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:34,100
So apparently, we're a developing country.

298
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:35,820
And you're finally recognizing it.

299
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:37,860
That's good, Joe.

300
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:41,640
It does seem like there is a fledgling community building here.

301
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:45,180
They're trying to set up some paid bug bounty programs, and it sounds like they've actually

302
00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:47,060
paid out some bugs already.

303
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:50,560
So that money may be going right back into the community.

304
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:56,420
Yeah, and it's interesting that they're focusing on the graphical apps as well, which are somewhat

305
00:18:56,420 --> 00:19:03,580
possible in a kind of hacky way, but they're really kind of doubling down on that and making

306
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:10,580
it work with an external X server, which, just a quick mention for Flatpaks running

307
00:19:10,580 --> 00:19:17,260
on the subsystem as well now, Alexander Larson, who is the kind of lead dev on Flatpak, tweeted

308
00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:21,040
about this this week that he said it's got some hacky workarounds, but it basically works

309
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:26,040
and showed some screenshots of it, which it was inevitable at some point this was going

310
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:27,040
to happen.

311
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:32,740
But it's pretty cool to see that the Linux community are just doing it for the sake of

312
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:34,100
it, just for the fun of it almost.

313
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:35,100
Right.

314
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:38,380
I mean, you just can't stop us once you give us a playground we can hook into those POSIX

315
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:43,540
APIs that we know and love, while software and tweaks are going to be the result.

316
00:19:43,540 --> 00:19:44,540
All right.

317
00:19:44,540 --> 00:19:50,220
Well, let's end with a story that broke as we were recording last week, which I'm kind

318
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:54,840
of glad that we had a whole week to digest this because it's pretty big news, isn't it?

319
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:59,100
And that is that Linus has decided to take a break from kernel development.

320
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:05,820
We don't know exactly how long for, but it's at least for the rest of the 4.19 cycle.

321
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:10,580
And this has caused a bit of a stink on the internet this week, would you say?

322
00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:12,940
Oh, my yes, Joe.

323
00:20:12,940 --> 00:20:19,860
And at the same time, or really shortly before, I think, well, the old code of conflict has

324
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:22,500
been replaced with a new contributor covenant.

325
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:28,180
Yeah, now this new code of conduct based on the contributor covenant, that is a very standard

326
00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:29,180
code of conduct, isn't it?

327
00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:33,780
It's used across a lot of open source projects.

328
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:40,420
And it kind of brings Linux into line really with the rest of the industry.

329
00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:46,020
Before it stood out as this kind of separate thing, where Linus could just do whatever

330
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:50,260
he wanted, be rude to people on the mailing list and say all sorts of offensive things

331
00:20:50,260 --> 00:20:55,460
and get away with it, whereas now, he pretty much can't do that anymore.

332
00:20:55,460 --> 00:20:56,980
And that's why he's taking a break.

333
00:20:56,980 --> 00:21:02,140
He said in the email announcing this, this week, people in our community confronted me

334
00:21:02,140 --> 00:21:05,260
about my lifetime of not understanding emotions.

335
00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:10,100
My flippant attacks and emails have been both unprofessional and uncalled for, especially

336
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:12,820
at times when I made it personal.

337
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:15,460
In my quest for a better patch, this made sense to me.

338
00:21:15,460 --> 00:21:19,020
I know now that this was not okay, and I am truly sorry.

339
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:23,740
I'm going to take time off and get some assistance on how to understand people's emotions and

340
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:26,000
respond appropriately.

341
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:30,340
Now that was the first thing that I had heard about it, and then I learned about this new

342
00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:31,340
code of conduct.

343
00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:35,580
And I was trying to put together what exactly had happened here.

344
00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:41,860
And then on Wednesday, there was an article in the New Yorker, and that article was primarily

345
00:21:41,860 --> 00:21:48,780
focused on the lack of women in the Linux kernel development community and how it has

346
00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:51,860
been hostile to them.

347
00:21:51,860 --> 00:21:57,780
And in the article in the New Yorker, it said that they had reached out to Linus, and by

348
00:21:57,780 --> 00:22:02,580
the looks of things, the foundation as well, in advance of publishing it, saying that plenty

349
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:06,840
of examples of him being hostile to women and other people.

350
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:08,820
And it seems that that is what has triggered this.

351
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:14,300
Clearly, there's been conversations going about these matters for really years, but

352
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:19,980
that article brought it all to a head, probably in some ways to try to manage the PR around

353
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:20,980
it.

354
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:22,540
This new agreement was kind of pushed into place.

355
00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:26,180
There's a number of developers who, at least in theory, agree with some of the principles

356
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:30,320
in the code, and as you say, it is adopted in a number of other large, successful open

357
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:31,820
source projects.

358
00:22:31,820 --> 00:22:37,340
But the way it was just adopted so abruptly, without a big community-wide discussion, doesn't

359
00:22:37,340 --> 00:22:38,900
sit well with a lot of other people.

360
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:43,980
Well, the funny thing is that it doesn't sit well with people on both sides of the argument.

361
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:49,220
Because there are people who are saying that this is politics invading the Linux kernel,

362
00:22:49,220 --> 00:22:52,460
and we don't need this, and everything was fine before.

363
00:22:52,460 --> 00:22:57,700
But then you have people on the other extreme saying that this doesn't go far enough, and

364
00:22:57,700 --> 00:23:02,380
it's really just paying lip service to the issues that are underlying here that have

365
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:04,940
been festering for a long time.

366
00:23:04,940 --> 00:23:12,180
And the fact that anyone who is in violation of this code of conduct gets reported to a

367
00:23:12,180 --> 00:23:13,940
committee that are all men.

368
00:23:13,940 --> 00:23:22,740
So if you are a woman, or transgender, or whatever, you are not represented on that

369
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:26,120
board of people who are supposed to be sorting this out.

370
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:30,420
So it's just a real mess of strong opinions.

371
00:23:30,420 --> 00:23:34,380
And that's kind of why I'm glad that we had this week to think about it.

372
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:38,020
But even then, I still don't know exactly where to stand on this whole thing.

373
00:23:38,020 --> 00:23:42,460
I think it's difficult because this sort of large community culture change takes a long

374
00:23:42,460 --> 00:23:44,000
time to fully happen.

375
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:50,260
And we're still in that awkward, quiet period after all the announcements and all the drama.

376
00:23:50,260 --> 00:23:54,980
What will really matter is how does the technical advisory board actually function in this new

377
00:23:54,980 --> 00:23:55,980
role?

378
00:23:55,980 --> 00:23:59,860
What sort of disagreements, what sort of violations get reported, and how are those dealt with?

379
00:23:59,860 --> 00:24:03,940
Is this probably something we just have to watch over the next months and years to come?

380
00:24:03,940 --> 00:24:04,940
Yeah, definitely.

381
00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:10,300
But there's one thing that is clear to me, and that is that politics has become involved

382
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:12,820
in kind of development now.

383
00:24:12,820 --> 00:24:17,780
And whether or not you think that's a good thing or a bad thing, well, that's up to you,

384
00:24:17,780 --> 00:24:18,780
dear listener.

385
00:24:18,780 --> 00:24:23,100
But we are now in new times, aren't we?

386
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:31,340
The politics have come into this world, like it or not, and it's going to change it.

387
00:24:31,340 --> 00:24:35,740
And whether that is for better or worse, it really just depends on people's perspective,

388
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:36,740
I think.

389
00:24:36,740 --> 00:24:41,620
Yeah, people's perspectives, actions, and if the kernel community can find a way to

390
00:24:41,620 --> 00:24:46,860
embrace these changes without a lot of collateral damage, are people's intentions good?

391
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:51,140
Or does this become just another way to have more flame wars on the mailing list?

392
00:24:51,140 --> 00:24:54,340
Yeah, well, we'll soon see about that.

393
00:24:54,340 --> 00:24:59,060
Well, this is a story that is not going to go away, and I have a feeling we may well

394
00:24:59,060 --> 00:25:01,620
be talking about it in future weeks.

395
00:25:01,620 --> 00:25:05,660
So if you want to stay up to date with all of the developments there and for the rest
