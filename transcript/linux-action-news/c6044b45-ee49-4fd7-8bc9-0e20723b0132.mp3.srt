00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,120
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, our weekly take on Linux and the open source world.

2
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:20,440
This is episode 19, recorded on September 17th, 2017.

3
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:21,440
I'm Chris.

4
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:22,440
And I'm Joe.

5
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:23,580
Hello, Joe.

6
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:27,800
It's good to be with you, but nobody cares about that because it's GNOME Release Week,

7
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:31,480
and 3.26 has been released.

8
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:32,480
It has.

9
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:40,080
And the headline for me is marginal improvements, nothing showstopping, no amazing developments.

10
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:44,160
It's just kind of polishing and making everything that little bit better.

11
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:45,640
Is that fair to say?

12
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:49,240
Maybe from the outside, as a GNOME user, there's quite a few things in here that I think are

13
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:50,240
pretty great.

14
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:53,860
And it's also just after their 20th birthday, which is pretty great.

15
00:00:53,860 --> 00:00:58,640
The first new thing that I'm looking forward to is the new settings application, which

16
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:00,720
has a new navigation sidebar.

17
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:05,200
Everything's listed on the side, clear, easy to read, good color contrast, so it's quick

18
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:09,720
to scan through it, Wi-Fi right at the top, which is a frequent thing that I need to get

19
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:11,200
access to.

20
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:16,580
And in the browser area, they've added synchronizing with Firefox sync, like we talked about recently.

21
00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:18,200
So that's built in now too.

22
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:22,480
That settings panel, looking at it, it just feels like why was it not like that before?

23
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:24,200
That's just how it should be.

24
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:26,140
Yeah, exactly.

25
00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:28,900
It's something similar to what the Plasma desktop's working on.

26
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:33,200
And I make an old man joke here when I say this, but it honestly reminds me a lot of

27
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:38,780
macOS System 6's control panel, where you had just a clear, easy black and white icons

28
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:43,400
on the left hand side, you clicked mouse or keyboard, and then the respective settings

29
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:46,360
showed up on the right hand pane, and it works.

30
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:47,560
So why not use it?

31
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:51,400
There's a few other things that GNOME users will appreciate.

32
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:56,540
There's now some nice smooth animations for maximizing and unmaximizing windows and snapping.

33
00:01:56,540 --> 00:02:00,240
They're actually really done well, and elementary OS users are familiar with sort of those

34
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:01,440
nice perks.

35
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:07,420
And this is the first release where the GNOME project is recommending Wayland over X11,

36
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:11,440
because they got a new fancy display setting screen where you can independently control

37
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:14,320
DPI and resolution settings for different monitors.

38
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:18,240
I think that might have been from some of the work with our friends at Canonical recently.

39
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:22,120
And that's baked in, but it only works with Wayland, so they call it a preview mode right

40
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,120
now.

41
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,380
Well, you mentioned Canonical there.

42
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:29,800
This is going to be the release that's in Ubuntu 17.10, so it's pretty important to

43
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:30,800
them.

44
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:31,800
Yeah.

45
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,680
And the crew over at Canonical celebrated.

46
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:40,440
Will Cook and Popey brought a laptop cake to the release party with GNOME on the display.

47
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:42,500
You have to go check out Twitter for this.

48
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:47,120
It's really well done to sort of say, hey, guys, we're happy to celebrate this with you.

49
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:52,440
And I'm really glad this is the version that's landing in 17.10, because as a pro desktop,

50
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:59,520
Boxes, the front end to emulation or virtualization, it has added a really nice feature now where

51
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:03,920
you can share folders between virtual machines and your computers.

52
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:07,640
You can create one folder in like your home directory, and then your virtual machines

53
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:11,700
can get access to that folder in your home directory between them.

54
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:15,320
That's going to be really nice, a big feature for Boxes that I've been waiting for for a

55
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:16,460
long time.

56
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:21,120
But just to make things easier in GNOME software, updates are now going to be grouped by type

57
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:24,520
to provide more accurate progress information when being installed to it.

58
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:27,240
Core updates, feature updates, things like that.

59
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,760
Similar features have now been added to logs.

60
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:30,460
It's grouping similar messages together.

61
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:34,700
And Terminal now makes it easier to work with hyperlinks, so a lot of small little features

62
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:39,900
that pro users of the GNOME desktop will really appreciate in GNOME 3.26.

63
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:41,360
One public service announcement.

64
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:44,260
This is critical to all you GNOME users, I know.

65
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:47,560
Tweak tool has been renamed to just Tweaks.

66
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:50,640
You have been warned.

67
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:54,640
And all joking aside, there is one more big PSA with this release of GNOME.

68
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:57,880
There are no longer status icons in the bottom left.

69
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:02,200
That little annoying tabby things that held your Skype icon or your Dropbox or Telegram

70
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,200
icons gone.

71
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:08,240
And the only way you're getting those suckers back is by using a third party extension like

72
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,240
top icons.

73
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:13,920
Yeah, that to me is a mistake, I think, because, okay, some of them can be annoying, but some

74
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,720
of them can be really useful as well.

75
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:19,000
I have one right now for Mumble that is really useful.

76
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,640
So I would definitely be installing that extension if I was a GNOME user.

77
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:24,640
Yep.

78
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:27,840
And I think a lot of the distributions that ship GNOME out of the box will just start

79
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:29,560
shipping that extension now.

80
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:31,460
And we'll see different ways of implementing that.

81
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:32,720
Some will do it as a package.

82
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:36,000
Some will do it as an extension from extensions.gnome.org.

83
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,460
It's going to be a hit and miss on that implementation.

84
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:40,040
It might be a bumpy ride.

85
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:44,480
And that's why Plasma fans might be happy with recent discussions going on between the

86
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:49,440
Plasma camp, guys over at KDE and gals over at KDE, and the Purism camp.

87
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,440
Yeah, we reported on this recently, didn't we?

88
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:56,840
The Librem 5 from Purism, which is their phone that's going to run GNU slash Linux.

89
00:04:56,840 --> 00:05:00,480
And in all the mockups, I would say screenshots, but they're just mockups, aren't they, at

90
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:03,120
this stage, it's been GNOME.

91
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:05,400
And that's what they use on their Pure OS.

92
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:07,200
So it would make logical sense.

93
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:12,420
But hang on a second, that's going to take a hell of a lot of development to make work.

94
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:20,040
And so Matthias Klump, one of the PurOS developers, got in touch with the KDE team via the mailing

95
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:27,280
list back at the end of August to discuss the possibility of getting Plasma Mobile working

96
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:30,380
on this, or at least some components of Plasma Mobile.

97
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:33,360
And now it looks like that is going to happen.

98
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:37,680
So you're going to actually have a choice between KDE Plasma or GNOME.

99
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:41,760
That's at least the plan as it stands now, this week, shall we say.

100
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:45,280
Maybe the most interesting thing about this development is reading the mailing list posts

101
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:49,420
that Joe found, and we'll have linked in the show notes, because it shows sort of some

102
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:54,200
real interesting insights into the Librem 5 project.

103
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:57,420
And it's from an engineer developer's perspective.

104
00:05:57,420 --> 00:05:59,600
So it's just raw information.

105
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:05,600
And I actually found that more compelling, just reading that mailing post made me want

106
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:09,740
to back the Librem 5 more than anything written on their actual fundraiser page.

107
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:16,360
So what I took away from reading those discussions is this truly is what you and I were saying

108
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:22,640
would be great, which is a open source phone hardware platform that could run basically

109
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:25,880
anything that you could get installed on it.

110
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:32,280
And PureOS, which is a Debian derivative, would have a GNOME option or a Plasma option.

111
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:36,480
And it looks like based on these conversations, the Plasma Mobile stuff that they've been

112
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:40,840
working on for a while now is a little bit further along and would integrate better with

113
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:44,600
the whole matrix solution that the Librem 5 would end up using.

114
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:50,040
Because that matrix solution is a catch-all, it solves web browsing, email, messaging,

115
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:53,000
calendar and phone calls.

116
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,680
They don't have a huge demand on the phone UI.

117
00:06:56,680 --> 00:07:01,160
And when looking at the different options, it appears the Plasma stuff is further along.

118
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:02,800
And it's not just you and I who are thinking this.

119
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:06,480
The folks over at the KDE community have a quote here in the announcement.

120
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:14,480
They say, having full access to Purism's hardware platform is a dream for the KDE community.

121
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:18,460
Partnering with Purism allows us to integrate Plasma Mobile seamlessly with a commercial

122
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:19,920
device for the first time.

123
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:23,280
And the Librem 5 will make Plasma Mobile shine the way it deserves.

124
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:24,280
It's very positive.

125
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:28,200
OK, well, let me be positive for a bit and then characteristically negative afterwards.

126
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:31,480
So it's definitely a good thing that they're hooking up with Plasma.

127
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:35,320
Plasma Mobile for me is a great mobile OS.

128
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:36,880
It's got such great potential.

129
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:40,740
It's got the groundwork done by their own admission.

130
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:43,560
It's not really for mainstream consumer use.

131
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:45,400
And I like the modesty of that.

132
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:49,600
I like them being realistic about it and saying there's a lot to do on it.

133
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:51,420
But as you say, it's further along than GNOME.

134
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:55,960
So I think it is a brilliant choice for them to go that route.

135
00:07:55,960 --> 00:08:01,600
However, this strikes me as disorganized.

136
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:05,840
Why did they launch saying it was going to be GNOME and now they're saying it's going

137
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:08,440
to be KDE and probably GNOME as well?

138
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:13,240
And it just seems like they haven't really got it together properly.

139
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:14,740
There's no specs for this phone.

140
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:15,880
It's all just up in the air.

141
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:18,880
It's kind of just like, well, give us a bunch of money and we'll just trust us.

142
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:20,560
We'll make something good.

143
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,380
And a lot of people have backed this.

144
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:26,200
And since the KDE announcement, a lot more money has come in and it's looking like it

145
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:29,720
might maybe happen now.

146
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:34,160
But do you see what I mean about it being a bit all over the place?

147
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:35,160
I do.

148
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:39,560
What I took away from the discussion in those mailing lists was we think we've got the underlying

149
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:43,400
base OS because of the hardware platform we've chosen, because of the features that are now

150
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:47,600
built into the Linux kernel, and because of our PureOS Debian-based derivative.

151
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:50,220
We think we've got that piece really nailed down.

152
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:52,480
So we know we can boot a Linux-based OS on this thing.

153
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:53,760
We're pretty solid on that.

154
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:57,480
But what we don't have really nailed down is how you're going to tap on this thing to

155
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:01,840
launch the stuff you need, what that UI looks like, how we present that if we build our

156
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:02,840
own.

157
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:07,020
And I would say that is a particularly hard nut to crack.

158
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:08,360
So I could totally see where you're coming from.

159
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:10,580
That should be something they have figured out.

160
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:15,360
The devil's advocate position I'll take in this is you can only fund so much research

161
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:21,280
and time and development into that initiative until you've been funded.

162
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:26,880
So because it's such a challenge, it's hard to really justify spending the money on fixing

163
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:31,280
it until you have an indication that things are going to go that direction.

164
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:32,280
Am I making any sense?

165
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:35,840
I'm trying to come up with their position, and I'm probably missing some point.

166
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:42,000
But I guess that would be my positive devil's advocate response, because mostly, I agree

167
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
with you, Joe.

168
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,840
Well, yeah, that all makes sense what you said, but they could have had these discussions

169
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:55,120
with KDE before they launched the CrowdFunder and had more of a firm plan.

170
00:09:55,120 --> 00:10:00,240
I really want it to succeed, I really do, but I just wish they were a bit more organized

171
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,240
with it.

172
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:04,760
And hopefully, now that is happening, and hopefully, we're going to get a choice of

173
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:09,480
GNOME or KDE, which would make most people happy.

174
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:13,760
But I'm telling you, I'd still try and install Xfce on it, just for the lulz.

175
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:17,120
Well, then maybe Manjaro has just the answer for you, Joe.

176
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:22,920
Yeah, the new Manjaro laptop, which has been announced in association with Station X, which

177
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:29,320
is quite a small company based in the UK doing a similar thing to what Entroware does, except

178
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:35,840
that they, instead of focusing on a narrow range of Linux distros, they basically support

179
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:37,860
them all.

180
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:43,640
And now they're going to have a version of their Spitfire, which is basically the same

181
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:49,020
machine as the Apollo from Entroware or the Galago Pro from System76, only it's going

182
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:56,080
to be a Manjaro edition with a cool Manjaro logo, laser etched into the back of it, and

183
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:57,600
some tweaks to Manjaro as well.

184
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:03,120
So it's not going to be just standard Manjaro, there's kind of kernel tweaks and firmware

185
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:08,160
stuff to make it work well with the battery and CPU and everything.

186
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,680
So it's very good news for Manjaro.

187
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:11,640
They've got some hardware out there now.

188
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:14,080
Yeah, this really seems to be the new thing.

189
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:17,200
On a totally different scale, this reminds me of the box sets it used to be able to get

190
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,200
for different distributions.

191
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:22,800
Like I used to get a SUSE box set and a Mandrake box set and a Red Hat that was just six, seven

192
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:27,320
disks of stuff, and it was like an $80 purchase, but after every major release, I get that

193
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:28,320
big box.

194
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:29,680
Now you order a laptop.

195
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:30,680
And this thing's not bad.

196
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:31,680
I mean, it's called the Spitfire.

197
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:32,680
I like that name.

198
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:38,040
It's got a seventh generation Kaby Lake i7, 32 gigs of RAM, and a bunch of different SSD

199
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:39,360
and hard drive options.

200
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:43,340
Pre-orders will begin on October 13th, and they think they'll probably start shipping

201
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:46,640
the machines by the end of October.

202
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:50,000
These are Clevo-based machines with the modifications like Joe mentioned.

203
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:54,360
I'm not huge into the derivative versions landing on these laptops.

204
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:57,920
One of the things I like about Entraware's implementations is pretty straight implementation.

205
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:59,160
I like that a lot.

206
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:03,960
I'm not totally jazzed by the idea of this thing running a slightly different kernel

207
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:08,580
than main Manjaro, but I'd have to take a look at it first before I made any real judgments

208
00:12:08,580 --> 00:12:09,580
on that.

209
00:12:09,580 --> 00:12:14,040
Well, it is going to be supported by the Manjaro team, and so you can just do updates as you

210
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:16,400
would normally, and everything should be fine.

211
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:20,200
So at least they haven't just butchered a version of it on their own.

212
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:23,720
At least they've been working with the distro to make sure it's all good.

213
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:29,120
But listening to you talk about this on Linux Unplugged recently, I heard you dissing Manjaro

214
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,120
a lot.

215
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:36,000
I know you're a kind of hardcore Antegos Arch guy, but you don't like Manjaro by the sounds

216
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
of things.

217
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,040
Is it just because it's XFCE, or is it because of the updates as well?

218
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:44,040
I think XFCE is just the icing on the Manjaro cake, Joe.

219
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:47,480
I just love that aspect of it so much.

220
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:57,160
But I think Manjaro is a great idea, and I just don't really like the policy of delaying

221
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:59,280
updates for quote-unquote testing.

222
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:05,640
I think that is potentially hazardous, and I know they say this isn't the case, but there's

223
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:09,940
a potential for sometimes security updates to be included as bug fixes, and for those

224
00:13:09,940 --> 00:13:13,160
to be withheld just for quote-unquote testing.

225
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:19,240
Now say you have a distribution Manjaro size, say they have less than 50,000 users, or even

226
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:21,360
less than 500,000 users.

227
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:26,920
There's only a few maybe 10,000 people that are running on the testing version, and then

228
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:31,960
between that 10,000 user base, there's even a smaller subset that are using the same packages

229
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:36,480
and versions that you are on the same spin that you are.

230
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:40,520
And so there's actually really no real-world testing that happens there.

231
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:41,860
This isn't Debian.

232
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:42,860
This isn't Red Hat.

233
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:49,620
So to me, it feels more like stability theater than actual Arch with safety bumpers.

234
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:53,680
But it works for people, and the defaults are nice, the desktop configurations are nice,

235
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:59,000
performance optimizations are very nice, Manjaro was one of the first places to do some of

236
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
those things.

237
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:04,320
So I like all of those things about Manjaro, I just wish there was an option when I logged

238
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:09,040
in to check a box and just switch all of my repositories to Arch, and have everything

239
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:10,040
still work.

240
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:11,960
Then I think I'd probably be in the sweet spot with Manjaro.

241
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:14,840
Yeah, I don't mind that today, I disagree to some extent.

242
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:21,480
I think that there is enough testing of it, albeit it's not a lot of testing, but I think

243
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:26,280
you only need a little bit to justify the delay, because it's only a slight delay as

244
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:27,280
well.

245
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:33,240
And as you say, proper security patches get pushed straight away, so it is really just

246
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:34,240
bug fixes.

247
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:39,420
And I know, okay, sometimes bug fixes can be security fixes as well.

248
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:43,600
So I can see where you're coming from, but I have a real soft spot for Manjaro, because

249
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:46,440
I've installed Arch, it's a huge pain.

250
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:49,660
And Turgos, I've just had bad experiences with, I can't even remember why.

251
00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:52,840
And I've always enjoyed using Manjaro when I've used it.

252
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:58,000
And having a really nice XFCE setup with Numix icons, and everything looks nice to me when

253
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,040
I've used it.

254
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:05,040
So it's kind of my backup if I ever want to go down that rolling route and have a nice

255
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:06,320
XFCE desktop.

256
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:11,080
So yeah, I just felt a bit slighted here and you dissed my beloved Manjaro.

257
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:17,680
Well, I'm glad you're here to defend them, because I think they do deserve some defense.

258
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:24,200
I would conclude my other problem with the separate software repos is it's a separate

259
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:28,640
set of infrastructure to manage, which they have had some accidents a couple of times

260
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:29,740
in the past.

261
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:33,400
It's a different area of their expertise that's going to always be stressed and won't be the

262
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:35,440
primary focus for them.

263
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:38,240
And it's something that's particularly harder for a small team to pull off.

264
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:43,620
The infrastructure around it, the security around it, just reauthorizing your SSL certs.

265
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:47,700
If they were using mainline arch repositories, this would be something that the distribution

266
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:50,280
didn't even have to worry about, didn't even have to focus.

267
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:54,260
And they could spend the rest of their time and resources on making that desktop even better.

268
00:15:54,260 --> 00:15:57,520
But I'm glad it works, and maybe one day I'll give it another spin.

269
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:59,800
I did try it for a while, and I was impressed.

270
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:04,840
And it functionally worked great for me.

271
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:07,060
LAS.ting.com, L-A-S.ting.com.

272
00:16:07,060 --> 00:16:08,360
It's a smarter way to do mobile.

273
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:13,180
The average Ting bill is just $23 per phone, because it's $6 for a line and then just your

274
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:15,680
minutes, your messages, and your megabytes.

275
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:20,240
I got an unbelievable story in Discord in the haircare channel, if you want to go check

276
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:24,520
it for yourself, from a listener who signed up for Ting.

277
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:28,680
And Hurricane Irma came in, knocked out their internet.

278
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:33,260
They switched on their Ting device, just tapped the hotspot mode, because it's in there.

279
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:35,480
If you want to use it as a data device, go ahead.

280
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:38,280
They turned it on, and they ended up with an $80 bill.

281
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:41,520
It's the largest Ting bill they've ever got, because they used a lot of data.

282
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:43,880
They were their primary connection.

283
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:47,200
And they emailed Ting and explained what happened.

284
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:50,240
And Ting knocked it down to, I think it was $60 or $20.

285
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:52,420
They took a huge chunk out, because they're a great company.

286
00:16:52,420 --> 00:16:56,940
And they've been around for a while now, because it's two cows that owns them.

287
00:16:56,940 --> 00:17:01,520
And they've built a company around really doing mobile in a different way.

288
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,160
They don't have to worry about building the antennas.

289
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:07,440
Instead, they worry about building a great system around it with an easy-to-use dashboard,

290
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:10,200
simple to understand plans, GSM and CDMA networks.

291
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:15,320
You can bring your own device, $6 for the baseline, minutes, messages, megabytes, whatever

292
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:16,960
you use, whatever features you want.

293
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:17,960
It's there.

294
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:19,540
It's nationwide coverage with no contracts.

295
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:21,600
Go to last.ting.com.

296
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:22,600
That's last.ting.com.

297
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:35,160
OK, let's talk about Blueborn, the big vulnerability of basically all Bluetooth devices, including

298
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:41,760
Android and Linux that was announced this week with a cool logo and everything and cool

299
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,800
website.

300
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:46,120
This looks like a really big deal.

301
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:49,560
But somehow, I'm not that worried about it.

302
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:52,640
Yeah, as Linux users, we might be in the best position.

303
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:56,160
As always, Android users are in the worst position.

304
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:58,360
And Apple users are not affected at all.

305
00:17:58,360 --> 00:17:59,600
And here's the really fun part.

306
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:03,800
The attack does not require that your device be paired.

307
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:06,280
Does not have to even be discoverable.

308
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:11,000
It just requires at the time that you have an active Bluetooth connection.

309
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:16,960
So if you connect to a car stereo or a headphone or a speaker, it will take over that connection

310
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:17,960
essentially.

311
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:18,960
It can do man-in-the-middle attacks.

312
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:24,720
And in some situations, depending on the vulnerability, it can execute remote code, mostly on Android

313
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:25,720
devices.

314
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:30,680
Yeah, which is actually the only worrying bit to me because Linux, I barely use Bluetooth,

315
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:31,680
if at all.

316
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:33,240
So I'm not worried about that.

317
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:38,000
But Android, OK, so I'm using Lineage, and I haven't quite got the update yet.

318
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,320
I'm expecting that in a couple of days.

319
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:42,400
So that should be fine.

320
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:49,420
But my smartwatch, my Sony smartwatch 3, which is never getting another update, that's vulnerable.

321
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:52,520
And is that going to let people get into my phone?

322
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:53,760
Maybe.

323
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:56,240
Is your smartwatch Bluetooth or is it Bluetooth LE?

324
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:58,960
Bluetooth LE connections are not vulnerable to this attack.

325
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:01,060
No, it's not LE as far as I know.

326
00:19:01,060 --> 00:19:03,360
So I am basically screwed.

327
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:09,760
Yeah, that means you're probably vulnerable to all four CVEs on Android, which do result

328
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:14,720
in information leaks, man-in-the-middle attacks, and remote code execution.

329
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,960
Google Pixels are getting the patches already.

330
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:21,260
Google has notified OEMs and provided code upstream.

331
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:24,800
But of course, it's up to every ODM and OEM to patch.

332
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:28,740
Linux 3.3 and later are affected by this.

333
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:34,120
And any Linux system using BlueZ is also affected by this vulnerability.

334
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:38,480
All those vendors, supposedly, vendors being distribution maintainers in this case, have

335
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:39,600
been notified as well.

336
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:43,480
I've always pronounced it as Blues, I don't know, it's one of those things that you don't

337
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:44,480
really say much.

338
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:45,480
Oh, yeah.

339
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:46,480
Yeah.

340
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:47,480
Blues Zed.

341
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:48,480
Yeah.

342
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:52,480
But the reality is, there are going to be millions, if not billions of Android devices

343
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:57,960
out there that are not going to get patched against this for a long, long time.

344
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:02,040
So are we going to start seeing this get exploited on a major scale?

345
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:04,000
It looks like it's quite straightforward to do.

346
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
So maybe.

347
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Yeah.

348
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,760
Add this to the list of millions and millions of different types of attacks that are out

349
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:11,960
there on unpatched devices.

350
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:18,040
But this just seems to be the new world we live in because we've got Bluetooth in everything

351
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:23,960
from toaster ovens to every watch and smartphone sold these days, and cameras.

352
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:26,040
So that ship has sailed, Joe.

353
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:27,360
That ship has sailed.

354
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:29,920
What we need is public code for all of the things.

355
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:34,040
Yeah, especially if public money is being spent on that.

356
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:39,640
And so the FSFE, the Free Software Foundation Europe, have launched public money, public

357
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:47,120
code, which is a website and a campaign with a nice video which explains in quite a clunky

358
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:53,600
way, I think, but never mind, how if you're going to spend public money on code being

359
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:58,200
written, then it damn well should be released under an open source license.

360
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:02,560
And this is something I've been talking about for years and we all have surely because it

361
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:10,120
just it's outrageous that they spend public money on code and software that's proprietary

362
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:12,840
and that we can't all benefit from.

363
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:13,840
Yeah.

364
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:18,640
In the big picture, it locks government into contracts where vendors can exploit them.

365
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:22,080
And that exploitation results in lots of public funds.

366
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:25,320
There is an obvious counter argument to this.

367
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:31,300
And that counter argument would be national security secrets, secret patented code that

368
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:34,440
has to be used for certain things.

369
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:37,680
But government is so much more than just national security.

370
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:38,680
You have local government.

371
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:42,800
Here in the United States, we have the National Park Services and state governments that could

372
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:46,120
all use this, wildlife agencies.

373
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:50,280
There's no reason that this couldn't be widely adopted wherever applicable.

374
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:54,960
There's 7,218 signatures right now on this open letter.

375
00:21:54,960 --> 00:22:00,680
I also take pause in trying to force any technological decision via legislation.

376
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:04,400
It seems like if open source is competitively better, it would eventually just take over

377
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:05,480
in government.

378
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:11,000
And to that point, at FOSDOM 2017, there was a talk about the gaining momentum of open

379
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:15,420
source in government, which is a good talk if you want to go look it up, it's audio.

380
00:22:15,420 --> 00:22:18,620
So it does seem to be already picking up some momentum.

381
00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:23,000
In this case, because it is public money, I do think that stuff, whenever possible,

382
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,000
should be open.

383
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,240
And whenever it can't be open, there needs to be some sort of documented reason why,

384
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:28,800
and explain what the functionality is.

385
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:33,680
Yeah, if it's kind of weapons systems or whatever, then that kind of makes sense.

386
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:39,920
But if it's, I don't know, the software running a library or whatever, there's just no reason

387
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:42,640
why that shouldn't be open.

388
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:46,520
Public code.eu if you want to sign the open letter.

389
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:49,600
Maybe you could do that in a Firefox multi-account container.

390
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:53,200
Yeah, is this going to be enough to tempt you back to Firefox, Chris?

391
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:54,200
I wonder.

392
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:58,080
I've been using Firefox for a long time, well, forever, pretty much.

393
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:01,640
And I have Chrome installed generally, but I stick to Firefox.

394
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:04,360
And now I've got even more reason to use it.

395
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:08,600
So multi-account containers, it's quite straightforward.

396
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:15,160
You set up your containers, and you can log into sites in different tabs as different

397
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:18,520
identities completely, because they're totally containerized.

398
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:24,320
So for example, the Google Suite, you can log into your Gmail and your drive and everything

399
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:27,520
with one tab in one account, and then a totally different account.

400
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:30,360
So I might have my personal account, and then I might have an account for one of the shows

401
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:31,560
that I do.

402
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:36,200
And so this, I've tested out already, is all immediately useful to me.

403
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:41,280
So well done, Mozilla, for coming up with an official extension to do this.

404
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:46,560
And my next question is, should it be integrated into mainline Firefox without an extension?

405
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:48,160
I don't know about that.

406
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:49,160
I don't know.

407
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:50,820
Is it bloat, or is it useful?

408
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:52,740
It's useful for me.

409
00:23:52,740 --> 00:23:58,240
As long as it's an extension that's kind of freely available, that's probably enough.

410
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:00,080
I say yes and yes to both your questions.

411
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:04,260
It is tempting me more and more, as Chrome is pissing me off more and more.

412
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:05,760
And I think it should be built in.

413
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:10,600
It does add bloat, but it reduces bloat on my system in another way, which is running

414
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:16,040
three browsers at once, plus one browser with another window open in incognito mode.

415
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:20,480
Because I'm in all kinds of accounts for the different shows all day long, plus my own

416
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:23,040
personal accounts and my work accounts.

417
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:27,320
So I would use the snot out of this feature, and I would probably be running less instances

418
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:30,420
of Chrome and GNOME Web if I could use this.

419
00:24:30,420 --> 00:24:34,600
So again, I'm thinking it's time for me to take Firefox way more seriously.

420
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:37,240
And I love that they're building in these advanced features.

421
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:38,800
There's one major limitation.

422
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:40,920
It's super obvious if you think about it.

423
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:45,040
Firefox sync is only going to work with one quote unquote account slash container.

424
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:47,100
So you can only have one sync account.

425
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:52,280
You can have multiple containers for different online accounts, but only one Firefox sync

426
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:53,440
account for the browser.

427
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:54,440
That's kind of obvious.

428
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:55,440
Yeah.

429
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:58,200
So does this smell like a Firefox challenge?

430
00:24:58,200 --> 00:24:59,200
Yeah.

431
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:02,200
Maybe after I get back from New York, this might be the time to give it a go.

432
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:06,360
Because you know, also in the next couple of months, version 57 ships with the new interface.

433
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:07,360
Yeah.

434
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:08,640
I think it's getting close, Joe.

435
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:10,240
There might be time to jump on board.

436
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:11,240
Yeah.

437
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:14,360
Just when I keep thinking about moving to Chrome, Mozilla pulls stuff like this and

438
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:17,360
makes me think, yeah, I'll stick around for a little bit longer.

439
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:19,160
Stick around just that little bit longer.

440
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:21,240
Well we hope you guys will stick around for a little bit longer too.

441
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:25,140
Go to linuxactionnews.com slash subscribe for all the ways to get new episodes.

442
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:27,760
I won't be here next week, but the show will go on.

443
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:30,720
I'll be in NYC for the Ubuntu rally.

444
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:34,080
I'll be on my way to NYC by the time the first episode airs.

445
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:35,460
I'll be missing two weeks.

446
00:25:35,460 --> 00:25:42,120
You can follow my live progress at jupiterbroadcasting.com slash rover, where I'll also post episodes

447
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:43,280
from the Ubuntu rally.

448
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:47,720
So all that live tracking and episodes that I publish from there, jupiterbroadcasting.com

449
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:48,720
slash rover.

450
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:49,720
Yeah.

451
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:53,480
So stick around for a couple of guest hosts while Chris is away.

452
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:57,680
And if you go to linuxactionnews.com slash contact, you'll find all the ways to get in

453
00:25:57,680 --> 00:25:58,840
touch with us.

454
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:04,120
And you can support the network and our coverage of Linux and open source over at patreon.com

455
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:05,880
slash Jupiter signal.

456
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:10,640
So I'll be back next Monday with our weekly take on the latest Linux and open source news.

457
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:12,680
I'm at Chris LAS.

458
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:14,240
I'm at Joe Rissington.

459
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:17,200
Thank you for joining us and he'll see you next week.

460
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:35,760
See you later.
