00:00.000 --> 00:09.360
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, episode 242, recorded on May 25th, 2022.

00:09.360 --> 00:10.480
I'm Chris.

00:10.480 --> 00:11.480
And I'm Wes.

00:11.480 --> 00:12.480
Hello, Wes.

00:12.480 --> 00:14.840
Let's do the news.

00:14.840 --> 00:20.200
We start this week with an almost clichÃ© kernel release from Linus Torvalds, announcing

00:20.200 --> 00:23.040
Linux 5.18.

00:23.040 --> 00:28.700
Linus wrote in the 5.18 announcement, no unexpected nasty surprises this last week.

00:28.700 --> 00:31.820
So here we go with the 5.18 release right on schedule.

00:31.820 --> 00:37.240
And that obviously means that the merge window for 5.19 will open tomorrow.

00:37.240 --> 00:42.200
No surprises, perhaps, but there have been some controversial additions.

00:42.200 --> 00:48.920
5.18 brings the first wave of support for Intel's software-defined silicon, or SDSI,

00:48.920 --> 00:49.920
functionality.

00:49.920 --> 00:54.620
The purpose of which is to disable access to specific processor capabilities in the

00:54.620 --> 00:58.880
absence of a certificate from Intel saying otherwise.

00:58.880 --> 01:02.640
Yeah, my brain almost has a hard time believing the words coming out of your mouth, Wes, but

01:02.640 --> 01:05.020
it is all true, and it's all GPL.

01:05.020 --> 01:06.720
So that's good, right?

01:06.720 --> 01:09.000
No, it leaves us feeling uneasy.

01:09.000 --> 01:10.920
But here's what we do know.

01:10.920 --> 01:15.480
David Box, who submitted the patch set, he made at least one aspect of this clear.

01:15.480 --> 01:18.560
The interface to the mechanism itself is relatively simple.

01:18.560 --> 01:22.040
It's not like Intel's doing anything weird on your Linux box.

01:22.040 --> 01:28.880
What happens is this system appears as a device on the bus that offers a couple of operations.

01:28.880 --> 01:34.400
Install an authentication key certificate or a capability activation payload.

01:34.400 --> 01:38.280
So the certificate is used to authenticate any request to enable a feature, while the

01:38.280 --> 01:41.600
payload actually contains the requests themselves.

01:41.600 --> 01:46.200
And unless this device has been used to store an acceptable certificate and payload, the

01:46.200 --> 01:51.880
features that it governs will be unavailable to software that is running on this new Intel

01:51.880 --> 01:53.480
CPU.

01:53.480 --> 01:58.920
This new SDSI hardware also maintains a couple of counters that it uses to track how many

01:58.920 --> 02:04.760
times you've tried and failed to load a certificate or enable a feature.

02:04.760 --> 02:09.920
And well, if you exceed the threshold for those counters, the mechanism will be disabled

02:09.920 --> 02:11.120
entirely.

02:11.120 --> 02:15.880
No new shiny features for you, unless you power cycle your box.

02:15.880 --> 02:22.560
Yep, and Intel says this is great because it's a system that enables shipping cheaper

02:22.560 --> 02:27.880
CPUs with features that could be of interest to users down the road, but are just unavailable

02:27.880 --> 02:30.080
until the additional payments are made.

02:30.080 --> 02:35.020
Um, yeah, I mean, to be clear at this stage, we don't really know what those features

02:35.020 --> 02:36.020
are going to be.

02:36.020 --> 02:38.360
So that will be worth waiting for.

02:38.360 --> 02:42.020
But we do know at this point, the Linux support should be ready.

02:42.020 --> 02:49.000
And as for me, well, I'll be ready to vote with my wallet.

02:49.000 --> 02:55.280
Looking ahead to Linux 5.19, butterFS users are in for a fresh treat.

02:55.280 --> 03:01.200
David Sterba of SUSE has submitted almost 4000 lines of code with some exciting new

03:01.200 --> 03:04.520
features from one of our favorite file systems.

03:04.520 --> 03:09.520
Indeed, and surprise, surprise, performance has been the focus of a lot of this patch

03:09.520 --> 03:10.520
set.

03:10.520 --> 03:15.520
Probably the fruits of a lot of low level code optimizations by various groups at SUSE,

03:15.520 --> 03:18.600
Facebook, and some other large supporters.

03:18.600 --> 03:20.600
What are you getting for all that effort?

03:20.600 --> 03:26.960
Well, starting in 5.19, butterFS will now avoid blocking on space reservation.

03:26.960 --> 03:31.360
That's a change that should see about a 7% throughput improvement for both reads and

03:31.360 --> 03:32.360
writes.

03:32.360 --> 03:37.140
There's also been some improvements to locking code when you're using the no copy on write

03:37.140 --> 03:38.360
option.

03:38.360 --> 03:41.960
That's about a 3% throughput performance improvement.

03:41.960 --> 03:45.880
And there's a nice to see improvement in the butterFS send code.

03:45.880 --> 03:50.120
They've reduced pressure on the page cache there by dropping extent pages sooner.

03:50.120 --> 03:52.400
The list just keeps going on here.

03:52.400 --> 03:55.680
We're not going to go into all of them here on the show, but it's well worth checking

03:55.680 --> 03:56.680
out in the notes.

03:56.680 --> 04:01.080
And I've got to think, you add up all these small little pieces, it's going to be some

04:01.080 --> 04:03.160
performance improvements you can feel.

04:03.160 --> 04:05.520
Yeah, how often does that happen?

04:05.520 --> 04:09.320
Everything gets created, and then each release, it just gets better and faster.

04:09.320 --> 04:13.800
I mean, I feel like at this point, butterFS is becoming one of the better turnaround stories

04:13.800 --> 04:14.800
in free software.

04:14.800 --> 04:16.580
It's really gotten good.

04:16.580 --> 04:21.800
And it's just great to see that the network effect of its adoption is really paying off.

04:21.800 --> 04:27.560
If you haven't tried out butterFS for a laptop install, maybe a Raspberry Pi, it's worth

04:27.560 --> 04:32.240
a go.

04:32.240 --> 04:37.400
Alan's Christoph Steiner, aka ATAF, shared a noteworthy update this week on the F-Droid

04:37.400 --> 04:38.400
infrastructure.

04:38.400 --> 04:43.720
It included some nice improvements for developers submitting apps, and just for us end users.

04:43.720 --> 04:44.720
Absolutely.

04:44.720 --> 04:49.200
And for those of you out of the loop, F-Droid is a free alternative to Google Play.

04:49.200 --> 04:52.680
It's something focused on free software.

04:52.680 --> 04:57.200
You could perhaps load it on a device that has no Google services, and more and more

04:57.200 --> 05:03.280
apps are co-publishing in F-Droid, or perhaps some apps are only publishing there.

05:03.280 --> 05:08.440
As you can imagine, running something like this over time, it sort of gets built organically,

05:08.440 --> 05:12.520
and it requires a big pile of automation to manage the process of building thousands of

05:12.520 --> 05:13.800
apps from source.

05:13.800 --> 05:14.800
Yeah.

05:14.800 --> 05:16.440
I mean, think about that for a moment.

05:16.440 --> 05:20.480
You got to check out the source repos for all of those apps, you got to check to see

05:20.480 --> 05:25.440
if they've been updated, you got to actually go through and build them, make a new release,

05:25.440 --> 05:28.240
securely sign them, that's pretty tricky as well.

05:28.240 --> 05:32.560
And then, of course, make sure that they get put into your test infrastructure, spin up

05:32.560 --> 05:36.560
a virtual machine, make sure that they still work.

05:36.560 --> 05:42.960
And yeah, all of that has sort of been built over the many years F-Droid has existed, and

05:42.960 --> 05:45.680
it's all running on Debian.

05:45.680 --> 05:47.400
But no, not the latest release of Debian.

05:47.400 --> 05:48.400
Of course not.

05:48.400 --> 05:53.760
It's an old install of Debian, like five years old Debian Stretch, I think.

05:53.760 --> 05:56.000
Yeah, is that old in Debian terms?

05:56.000 --> 05:58.340
I think it's getting there.

05:58.340 --> 05:59.480
You can understand, right?

05:59.480 --> 06:05.240
Because upgrading to more recent releases, that's not like a simple app-get upgrade.

06:05.240 --> 06:09.360
It's a lot more complicated, and the project says they also need to overhaul their build

06:09.360 --> 06:11.080
process to get there.

06:11.080 --> 06:15.360
And that's tricky, because they really need to provide a platform to build those thousands

06:15.360 --> 06:16.360
of apps.

06:16.360 --> 06:20.960
They can't just upgrade the base image as often as they might like.

06:20.960 --> 06:22.500
Ain't that the truth?

06:22.500 --> 06:27.120
But work is underway, even if it's going to take some time.

06:27.120 --> 06:28.600
Thankfully though, this is nice to see.

06:28.600 --> 06:33.560
Kallax Institute, who builds Kallax OS in F-Droid, they're sponsoring 42 hours a month

06:33.560 --> 06:39.080
of time dedicated to improving the build infrastructure and improving automation more generally.

06:39.080 --> 06:42.280
And you developers out there, well, you'll be happy to hear that the outcome of some

06:42.280 --> 06:48.000
of this process should be faster application submission and improved signing automation.

06:48.000 --> 06:57.840
That maybe opens up some possibilities for parallelizing the whole thing submission process.

06:57.840 --> 07:03.480
Google has announced the Summer of Code 2022 project winners, and the list actually includes

07:03.480 --> 07:06.360
more than a few names that you probably know.

07:06.360 --> 07:10.480
Debug Point News has done a nice job of listing out the ones most folks would be interested

07:10.480 --> 07:16.280
in, but there were a few that stood out to us, including FFmpeg, Google sponsoring some

07:16.280 --> 07:23.640
work on a high-throughput JPEG 2000 decoder, as well as some work to enable CUDA C++ support.

07:23.640 --> 07:27.920
Another lucky project this year is Debian, where the primary focus is going to be trying

07:27.920 --> 07:31.520
to complete the Android SDK in Debian's packaging base.

07:31.520 --> 07:33.620
Well, you got to have that.

07:33.620 --> 07:39.280
There's also some summer fun coming to Tor, LibreOffice, the GNOME Desktop.

07:39.280 --> 07:44.560
One that I thought was interesting is it looks like there's a project to sync GNOME Health

07:44.560 --> 07:48.960
app with Apple Health, Nextcloud, and other apps.

07:48.960 --> 07:52.120
I don't think I even knew there was a GNOME Health app, so that's interesting.

07:52.120 --> 07:56.040
There's also a project to add Chromecast support to GNOME Network Display.

07:56.040 --> 07:57.040
Yes, please.

07:57.040 --> 07:58.040
I know, right?

07:58.040 --> 08:02.500
Yeah, I think they have Miracast now, and really just several other nice-to-see things

08:02.500 --> 08:08.040
for GNOME, some Nautilus stuff, but don't worry, Plasma's getting some summer fun too

08:08.040 --> 08:11.540
if you're a desktop of the Plasma-variety user.

08:11.540 --> 08:14.660
Nothing too exciting though, nothing that really jumped out at me, but we will have the full

08:14.660 --> 08:19.920
breakdown and a link to the Debug Point news article in our show notes, because it's not

08:19.920 --> 08:21.560
just those projects.

08:21.560 --> 08:27.780
There's a bunch of others getting some love, like Xorg, GIMP, VLC, etc., so go to linuxactionnews.com

08:27.780 --> 08:32.720
slash 242 for a link to that.

08:32.720 --> 08:38.820
Well, we all knew it would happen eventually.

08:38.820 --> 08:44.520
This week, Canonical announced that Ubuntu 22.10, which is shipping in the fall, will

08:44.520 --> 08:49.520
switch to Pipewire by default as its audio server.

08:49.520 --> 08:55.480
Now technically we should note here that Ubuntu already includes Pipewire, 2204 LTS for instance

08:55.480 --> 09:00.080
ships with both Pipewire and PulseAudio installed.

09:00.080 --> 09:06.140
But it's mainly included for Wayland compatibility, you know, all that fancy new stuff, and not

09:06.140 --> 09:09.400
in use currently as the default server.

09:09.400 --> 09:16.360
But starting with the next release, that finally changes.

09:16.360 --> 09:17.840
Linode dot com slash LAN.

09:17.840 --> 09:22.200
Go there to get $100 in 60 day credit on a new account, and that's where you go to support

09:22.200 --> 09:23.320
the show.

09:23.320 --> 09:29.280
Linode offers options for developers and businesses that don't want the complexities of hyperscalers

09:29.280 --> 09:31.900
and don't need their endless options either.

09:31.900 --> 09:35.020
You know they're always trying to lock you into their esoteric platform, and I feel like

09:35.020 --> 09:37.320
Linode is the jetpack for my business.

09:37.320 --> 09:40.660
Seriously, it lets me compete with the likes of Spotify.

09:40.660 --> 09:45.760
I can deliver an on par experience with Linode's infrastructure at pricing that my business

09:45.760 --> 09:47.880
can actually afford.

09:47.880 --> 09:51.880
And their pricing is 30 to 50% cheaper than the major hyperscalers out there.

09:51.880 --> 09:56.200
And they've been doing this for nearly 19 years, iterating on making the best platform

09:56.200 --> 09:58.520
to run your applications.

09:58.520 --> 10:01.960
Everything we've built in the last couple of years, we built it on Linode.

10:01.960 --> 10:05.520
And we've learned that they have the best customer support in the business.

10:05.520 --> 10:08.480
And this is the number one signal I hear from the audience.

10:08.480 --> 10:13.000
Hey Chris, yeah they got me with the performance, but then I had this problem and the support

10:13.000 --> 10:14.560
was unbelievable.

10:14.560 --> 10:19.680
Tier one support, when you pick up the phone or you send them a message or a ticket, $3.65

10:19.680 --> 10:21.760
a year they're working on it for you.

10:21.760 --> 10:25.040
And on top of that, they just have some of the best performance with 11 data centers

10:25.040 --> 10:26.360
around the world.

10:26.360 --> 10:33.320
They are their own ISP, so they have just the fantastic, bestest internet ever.

10:33.320 --> 10:35.640
It's so much fun to mess around with, I have to say.

10:35.640 --> 10:39.400
And then they have great features that we use, like object storage, their cloud firewall,

10:39.400 --> 10:41.120
their backups, and so much more.

10:41.120 --> 10:44.820
And the dashboard makes managing all of this straightforward and simple.

10:44.820 --> 10:49.360
So if you're just looking for a portfolio or a gaming server, they can do that.

10:49.360 --> 10:52.480
But if you're looking to run the back end of your business and you want to scale up

10:52.480 --> 10:56.720
to millions of users, yeah, they absolutely do that as well.

10:56.720 --> 11:01.040
Go build something, go try something, go learn something, and support the show.

11:01.040 --> 11:06.720
Go to linode.com slash LAN, get that $100 in 60 day credit, and go kick the tires for

11:06.720 --> 11:14.640
yourself while you support the show, linode.com slash LAN.

11:14.640 --> 11:20.340
And a tremendous thank you to Ting for their sponsorship of Linux Action News, linux.ting.com.

11:20.340 --> 11:22.840
Are you sick of overpaying for your cell service?

11:22.840 --> 11:29.840
Yeah, go see how much you could save and then take $25 off of that when you go to linux.ting.com.

11:29.840 --> 11:32.040
Ting is a mobile virtual network operator.

11:32.040 --> 11:36.420
That means they focus on the customer relationship, the value, and they ride on top of the existing

11:36.420 --> 11:40.480
network built by the big mega nationwide carriers.

11:40.480 --> 11:45.880
You know who I'm talking about, and Ting utilizes their networks, the same fast LTE and 5G,

11:45.880 --> 11:50.240
but you interface with Ting, who was recently named the number one carrier by Consumer Reports,

11:50.240 --> 11:51.360
and you save a bunch of money.

11:51.360 --> 11:56.040
Their plans are simple and straightforward, and there's no contracts ever.

11:56.040 --> 12:00.400
And Ting's customer service, of course, it's up there, and those little things all come

12:00.400 --> 12:04.720
together, like simple plans, great pricing, network access, multiple network access I

12:04.720 --> 12:10.240
might add, support, all of it just comes together to create a fantastic experience.

12:10.240 --> 12:15.180
That's why I've been a Ting customer since 2013, for reals.

12:15.180 --> 12:16.180
Go check them out.

12:16.180 --> 12:21.760
The linux.ting.com plans that are really competitively priced and easy to understand, and if you

12:21.760 --> 12:23.520
ever get stuck, they'll help you.

12:23.520 --> 12:26.600
And you can do it all online, and pretty much any phone's going to work with Ting, so just

12:26.600 --> 12:30.480
head to linux.ting.com, check your current phone, create an account, and pick the plan

12:30.480 --> 12:37.880
that's right for you, linux.ting.com.

12:37.880 --> 12:42.920
And we end this week on a rumor that could change the industry.

12:42.920 --> 12:47.880
Bloomberg and others are reporting that within the next week, Rodcom could announce an agreement

12:47.880 --> 12:53.800
to acquire VMware, at least according to people familiar with the matter.

12:53.800 --> 12:59.800
Absolutely a big deal, and you'll recall in 2016 Dell acquired EMC, which owned VMware

12:59.800 --> 13:05.280
at the time, for an historic $67 billion, still one of the largest acquisitions in tech

13:05.280 --> 13:06.280
history.

13:06.280 --> 13:12.160
And after five years of being part of Dell, VMware was then spun out in November of 2021

13:12.160 --> 13:16.800
with an agreement to continue to work together with Dell for the next five years.

13:16.800 --> 13:24.280
Now also along with that, Dell CEO Michael Dell owns approximately 41% of VMware.

13:24.280 --> 13:27.660
He plays a critical role still at the company as chairman of the board of VMware, so he's

13:27.660 --> 13:30.160
going to have a say in whatever happens here.

13:30.160 --> 13:36.320
And VMware currently has a market valuation of around $50.3 billion.

13:36.320 --> 13:41.660
The takeover discussions are ongoing, but there's also no guarantee that the talks actually

13:41.660 --> 13:44.320
lead to an agreement.

13:44.320 --> 13:48.080
Representatives for the two companies didn't immediately respond to requests for comment.

13:48.080 --> 13:53.720
But the Wall Street Journal does note that the bid could be around $140 a share or totaling

13:53.720 --> 13:54.720
$60 billion.

13:54.720 --> 13:55.720
Wow.

13:55.720 --> 13:59.600
I mean, $60 billion is a lot.

13:59.600 --> 14:04.800
No getting around that, but it's interesting because it's not really what Dell originally

14:04.800 --> 14:07.920
paid for VMware back in the day.

14:07.920 --> 14:14.080
Dell's chief executive officer, Pat Gelsinger, told Bloomberg TV he has mixed feelings about

14:14.080 --> 14:15.920
the potential acquisition.

14:15.920 --> 14:18.240
And he does have some standing to comment.

14:18.240 --> 14:23.680
Gelsinger was VMware CEO for eight years before recently returning to Intel.

14:23.680 --> 14:24.680
First it's a rumor.

14:24.680 --> 14:28.800
You know, I'm, you know, happily reading the newspapers like you on that.

14:28.800 --> 14:33.760
But you know, for us, you know, I, you know, I'm excited about VMware being an innovative

14:33.760 --> 14:35.600
partner for the future.

14:35.600 --> 14:40.320
And any potential transaction for them, I'd want to make sure that innovation is alive

14:40.320 --> 14:41.960
and well.

14:41.960 --> 14:46.220
And while that's not a strong condemnation or really a strong endorsement, I would say

14:46.220 --> 14:51.540
as far as CEO speak goes, it's rather bearish on the idea overall.

14:51.540 --> 14:55.160
That's probably reflective of how we're all feeling right about now.

14:55.160 --> 14:59.360
Of course, VMware is also a platinum member of the Linux Foundation.

14:59.360 --> 15:01.440
So whatever happens here could impact that.

15:01.440 --> 15:07.340
A platinum member pays around the tune of $500,000 a year for the title.

15:07.340 --> 15:09.840
So we're going to keep an eye on this and everything else happening in the world of

15:09.840 --> 15:13.720
Linux and open source news because there will be knock on effects.

15:13.720 --> 15:18.960

15:23.400 --> 15:27.440
And don't miss the new show Office Hours at officehours.hair.

15:27.440 --> 15:31.020
It's a podcast made just for the Jupiter broadcasting community.

15:31.020 --> 15:33.280
If you're not a J.B. listener, don't tune in.

15:33.280 --> 15:35.200
It's not recommended for you.

15:35.200 --> 15:36.200
OfficeHours.hair.

15:36.200 --> 15:42.600
But hey, you can still find this show back every single week with the latest Linux and

15:42.600 --> 15:44.400
open source news.
