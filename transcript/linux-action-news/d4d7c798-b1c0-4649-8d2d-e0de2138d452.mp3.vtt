00:00.000 --> 00:16.120
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, our weekly take on Linux and the open source world.

00:16.120 --> 00:20.480
This is episode 71, recorded on September 16th, 2018.

00:20.480 --> 00:21.480
I'm Joe.

00:21.480 --> 00:22.480
And I'm Wes.

00:22.480 --> 00:24.320
Thank you very much for joining me again, Wes.

00:24.320 --> 00:28.160
Chris is back at home and recovering, but we thought we'd better let him rest a little

00:28.160 --> 00:29.200
bit more.

00:29.200 --> 00:33.720
He should be back for LUP on Tuesday, but for now, you've got me and Wes again.

00:33.720 --> 00:35.180
So thank you very much.

00:35.180 --> 00:40.120
Let's start with Fedora and Fedora Silverblue.

00:40.120 --> 00:42.120
And they want people to take it for a test drive.

00:42.120 --> 00:43.120
Yeah, that's right.

00:43.120 --> 00:47.580
And well, you might not really know what Silverblue is just from the name.

00:47.580 --> 00:52.860
It used to be called Fedora Atomic Workstation Special Interest Group.

00:52.860 --> 00:53.860
That's a mouthful.

00:53.860 --> 01:00.000
It's a little bit easier, and it's a it's kind of a new type of Fedora based off OS

01:00.000 --> 01:01.000
Tree.

01:01.000 --> 01:06.440
Yeah, they say it has RPM OS Tree at its core to provide fully atomic upgrades, which we've

01:06.440 --> 01:08.840
seen on Project Atomic on the server.

01:08.840 --> 01:12.800
But now we're seeing this on the desktop, which is really cool.

01:12.800 --> 01:17.440
And it's not kind of ready for full time uses.

01:17.440 --> 01:19.480
It's not kind of daily driver ready.

01:19.480 --> 01:23.080
And they are pretty clear about that, hence why they want people to test it.

01:23.080 --> 01:24.080
Yeah, that's right.

01:24.080 --> 01:30.380
So Thursday, September 20th, 2018, Team Silverblue and Fedora QA are holding a test day for users

01:30.380 --> 01:33.880
to try out and test this new workstation variant.

01:33.880 --> 01:36.080
Anyone can help make changes in Fedora.

01:36.080 --> 01:40.480
Be a part of it if you want to see this released, they do say that you don't have to necessarily

01:40.480 --> 01:41.480
do it on that day.

01:41.480 --> 01:44.680
They're just kind of trying to focus everyone's attention on that.

01:44.680 --> 01:49.160
But if you don't have time to do it on that day, you can do it before or afterwards.

01:49.160 --> 01:52.720
And there's a wiki where you can enter your results from the various tests that you have

01:52.720 --> 01:53.920
to do.

01:53.920 --> 01:57.340
And obviously, Flatpak is a huge part of this, because that's how they are delivering the

01:57.340 --> 01:59.060
desktop apps.

01:59.060 --> 02:02.460
So they can keep the core completely separate from the applications.

02:02.460 --> 02:04.880
And as we know, Flatpaks can now auto update.

02:04.880 --> 02:08.100
So this is the future, as far as I can see.

02:08.100 --> 02:11.480
It's not quite the present, but it's just around the corner, I think.

02:11.480 --> 02:16.680
Yeah, you know, really, RPM, OS Tree and all the related technologies, I'm pretty impressed

02:16.680 --> 02:17.680
by.

02:17.680 --> 02:21.380
And some of their goals are exciting, like support package layering for OS extensions

02:21.380 --> 02:24.840
in GNOME software, support rebases and rollbacks.

02:24.840 --> 02:29.040
They've got some good details about why having a smart integrated system like this offers

02:29.040 --> 02:33.360
some unique alternatives that you can't quite get with other snapshot systems, say like

02:33.360 --> 02:36.920
if you're using ZFS and taking snapshots before you upgrade.

02:36.920 --> 02:39.360
The operating system doesn't really know about, you know, how that works.

02:39.360 --> 02:41.060
You're doing that at a different layer.

02:41.060 --> 02:44.620
But with systems like Silverblue, well, you have a lot more options.

02:44.620 --> 02:48.440
Can you imagine people just go rollback a major, all of your OS packages, and then your

02:48.440 --> 02:50.380
applications are separate in Flatpak?

02:50.380 --> 02:53.400
So that seems like a really robust system.

02:53.400 --> 02:55.200
We've seen something similar, haven't we?

02:55.200 --> 02:58.900
With endless OS, but that's very much aimed at a different market.

02:58.900 --> 03:03.020
That's not aimed at developers and people who want the latest of everything.

03:03.020 --> 03:09.160
It's kind of aimed for more developing markets and low end hardware, whereas this, Fedora

03:09.160 --> 03:14.920
Silverblue is very much aimed at the latest hardware, developers, sys admins.

03:14.920 --> 03:20.380
So it's good to see a kind of different take on the same kind of underlying technologies.

03:20.380 --> 03:23.200
It seems like a trend in the way that we're developing software.

03:23.200 --> 03:27.940
Well, something I'm looking forward to using in the near future is Nano 3.0, which has

03:27.940 --> 03:30.160
been released, called Waterflowing Underground.

03:30.160 --> 03:33.720
Sort of a strange name for it.

03:33.720 --> 03:37.320
And Nano, it's not a big and exciting project.

03:37.320 --> 03:42.480
It's just something that I use almost every day to edit config files on servers.

03:42.480 --> 03:45.640
I think you use Nano as well, don't you, Wiz?

03:45.640 --> 03:46.640
When I have to.

03:46.640 --> 03:51.120
And, you know, Joe, if you would just switch on over to Arch, you'd have it already.

03:51.120 --> 03:54.560
I played around with it just earlier today.

03:54.560 --> 03:59.280
I'm not a huge Nano user, only because I've been using VI for so long, my fingers are

03:59.280 --> 04:00.280
broken now.

04:00.280 --> 04:04.800
But some of the things that they've included in 3.0, well, they're just really nice, especially

04:04.800 --> 04:07.840
for a fundamental part of an operating system.

04:07.840 --> 04:10.480
Things like reading files 70% faster.

04:10.480 --> 04:14.480
A bunch of new shortcuts, I tried out Control Delete or Control Shift Delete, which erase

04:14.480 --> 04:16.360
the next word or the previous word.

04:16.360 --> 04:19.680
Now, of course, those are old hat for us VI users.

04:19.680 --> 04:22.120
But it's a pretty big usability improvement in Nano.

04:22.120 --> 04:24.440
Is it enough to tempt you to switch to Nano?

04:24.440 --> 04:25.440
Definitely not.

04:25.440 --> 04:29.520
But it is enough to convince me to get a little better at using Nano when I'm on a system

04:29.520 --> 04:30.520
that doesn't have VI.

04:30.520 --> 04:32.680
Yeah, I don't have very complex requirements.

04:32.680 --> 04:37.800
That's why I've always just stuck with Nano and never bothered to learn VI or Emacs or

04:37.800 --> 04:39.200
anything like that.

04:39.200 --> 04:43.020
But it's good to see that it is being actively developed.

04:43.020 --> 04:47.160
And there are major improvements happening, like you said.

04:47.160 --> 04:50.080
So I don't know, I don't think I need to move off at any time soon.

04:50.080 --> 04:52.920
No, and it's important to have just an easy to use.

04:52.920 --> 04:55.920
You know, VI is great when you use it, but it's like any other power tool.

04:55.920 --> 04:59.040
If you just need to, you know, change one config file, you don't need to learn a whole

04:59.040 --> 05:01.080
new paradigm of text editing.

05:01.080 --> 05:02.680
Nano fills that gap very nicely.

05:02.680 --> 05:07.060
Well, speaking of filling gaps, we know that Dropbox is going away for a lot of people

05:07.060 --> 05:09.720
who don't use EXT4.

05:09.720 --> 05:12.800
And Nextcloud seems to be the obvious replacement for that.

05:12.800 --> 05:15.780
And they've had a release this week as well, Nextcloud 14 has come out.

05:15.780 --> 05:18.600
There's lots of good things to talk about with Nextcloud 14.

05:18.600 --> 05:21.760
But in particular, it seems like they're really focusing on accessibility.

05:21.760 --> 05:25.120
Yeah, there don't seem to be kind of huge new features here.

05:25.120 --> 05:31.640
It just seems to be a focus on usability and refinement of the user experience.

05:31.640 --> 05:35.880
And you mentioned the accessibility there, they've massively improved the experience

05:35.880 --> 05:38.520
for people who are using screen readers.

05:38.520 --> 05:41.560
And that's something that a lot of people don't think about.

05:41.560 --> 05:46.920
And it is good to see them implementing this stuff to make it usable for everyone.

05:46.920 --> 05:51.300
I think that makes a huge difference, especially, you know, oftentimes those groups aren't large

05:51.300 --> 05:55.760
enough for proprietary applications to really feel a need to design around them.

05:55.760 --> 06:01.000
But when we're trying to build, you know, free and open source software for all of humanity,

06:01.000 --> 06:04.080
that is a really important group of people that deserve to use that software just as

06:04.080 --> 06:05.560
much as everyone else.

06:05.560 --> 06:09.440
But we need to have a good culture to encourage those designs.

06:09.440 --> 06:12.280
And it's great to see Nextcloud taking those concrete steps.

06:12.280 --> 06:14.440
I tried to install this on a droplet today.

06:14.440 --> 06:18.040
And I just got this weird error, and I just didn't have time to deal with it.

06:18.040 --> 06:26.120
So I just did snap, install Nextcloud, dash dash edge, and boom, it just sets it all up.

06:26.120 --> 06:29.700
So if you do want to just quickly test it out, I would strongly recommend the snap because

06:29.700 --> 06:33.320
it just makes it so much easier, sets all the database and everything up for you.

06:33.320 --> 06:35.780
Oh, that is so handy.

06:35.780 --> 06:38.800
One other thing I saw here is they've also done a bunch of improvements to make small

06:38.800 --> 06:43.960
screens like mobile or tablet devices work, which as someone looking to maybe move over

06:43.960 --> 06:47.320
to Nextcloud in the near future, that's an essential component for me.

06:47.320 --> 06:48.320
Oh, definitely.

06:48.320 --> 06:49.320
Yeah.

06:49.320 --> 06:54.360
I mean, that's been a criticism of mine before, that it's not as mobile friendly as something

06:54.360 --> 07:00.260
like Dropbox or Google Drive, where it's just a first class mobile experience.

07:00.260 --> 07:01.920
And I don't think we're there yet with Nextcloud.

07:01.920 --> 07:05.160
But it's good to see that they're moving in that direction that they are starting to take

07:05.160 --> 07:12.040
note of the fact that real people, for want of a better word, not developers, and perhaps

07:12.040 --> 07:15.880
the people who are listening to this show, most people don't use computers very much

07:15.880 --> 07:16.880
anymore.

07:16.880 --> 07:17.960
They use their phones and tablets.

07:17.960 --> 07:22.320
So I think if you're going to have mass adoption of this, you do need to focus on that.

07:22.320 --> 07:23.320
Yeah.

07:23.320 --> 07:24.320
And it's just so handy, right?

07:24.320 --> 07:25.320
If you can easily go...

07:25.320 --> 07:26.320
I know so many people, right?

07:26.320 --> 07:28.920
You have Dropbox, you throw a file up there, then you have access to it on your phone,

07:28.920 --> 07:33.280
which might otherwise be a somewhat hostile environment to doing complex workflows, Nextcloud

07:33.280 --> 07:34.280
could be a big asset.

07:34.280 --> 07:37.120
Well, Mozilla are certainly focusing on mobile.

07:37.120 --> 07:43.120
And this week, they announced that Firefox Focus is going to move over to the Gecko engine.

07:43.120 --> 07:44.840
It's pretty exciting, really.

07:44.840 --> 07:49.800
And if you're not familiar with Firefox Focus, well, it's basically private browsing as an

07:49.800 --> 07:50.800
app.

07:50.800 --> 07:52.780
It automatically blocks ads and trackers.

07:52.780 --> 07:57.400
And it looks like they even have just an instant history erase button in this newest release.

07:57.400 --> 07:59.360
Yeah, it's a really great little browser.

07:59.360 --> 08:03.960
It's super fast because obviously blocking all of that tracking stuff is just going to

08:03.960 --> 08:05.480
make your experience much better.

08:05.480 --> 08:12.320
It's not really full featured enough to use as a main browser, I don't think.

08:12.320 --> 08:17.040
And I wonder how much of that is because it was based on WebView before.

08:17.040 --> 08:20.400
And maybe it's going to be a nice experience now they're moving over to Gecko.

08:20.400 --> 08:21.640
Certainly seems like it.

08:21.640 --> 08:25.300
Gecko is the existing Firefox rendering engine.

08:25.300 --> 08:30.280
But up till now, Firefox Focus was just using WebView, which is built into Android, doesn't

08:30.280 --> 08:31.280
have a lot of features.

08:31.280 --> 08:36.720
They really kind of expect you to use the Android APIs and not the web APIs with WebView.

08:36.720 --> 08:41.800
Mozilla has done a ton of work to refactor Gecko into what they're calling GeckoView,

08:41.800 --> 08:45.960
which is Gecko packaged as a reusable Android library.

08:45.960 --> 08:50.560
Which sounds like an excellent win for open standards rather than having to use the Android

08:50.560 --> 08:52.040
APIs and everything.

08:52.040 --> 08:57.840
This is web standards which anyone can use and they're encouraging people to bake this

08:57.840 --> 08:59.720
into their applications, aren't they?

08:59.720 --> 09:00.720
The GeckoView.

09:00.720 --> 09:06.220
Yeah, they've also released Android components, a collection of independent ready to use libraries

09:06.220 --> 09:09.860
for building browsers and browser-like applications on Android.

09:09.860 --> 09:12.680
And now GeckoView is just one of those components.

09:12.680 --> 09:17.440
Now this is going to be a fairly slow rollout of the GeckoView version of Firefox Focus.

09:17.440 --> 09:22.040
So that means that the app that you download is going to be bigger because it's going to

09:22.040 --> 09:24.380
have both for a while.

09:24.380 --> 09:29.320
But they're going to slowly test it with more and more people until hopefully it's going

09:29.320 --> 09:31.160
to become default fairly soon.

09:31.160 --> 09:32.160
Yeah, stay tuned.

09:32.160 --> 09:33.160
Go give it a try.

09:33.160 --> 09:35.920
You can go check, you know, whatever user agent in your browser.

09:35.920 --> 09:40.940
If you see Gecko in there, then you know you're using the new GeckoView version.

09:40.940 --> 09:44.320
You might wonder why you would want to use this sort of like trimmed down browser.

09:44.320 --> 09:48.480
I think for people who aren't experts who don't really know how to manage all the complexities

09:48.480 --> 09:53.480
that are involved with cookies and tracking everything involved in the modern web today,

09:53.480 --> 09:54.480
Focus is just that.

09:54.480 --> 09:58.000
It's focus, it's small, and you know that your privacy is protected because Mozilla

09:58.000 --> 09:59.000
cares about it.

09:59.000 --> 10:02.960
It is actually in the beta version, so you can test it out straight away if you want

10:02.960 --> 10:03.960
to.

10:03.960 --> 10:08.960
But moving on to Chrome OS, version 70 is going to bring native network file share support,

10:08.960 --> 10:14.880
which is excellent news for people in the enterprise or education markets who want to

10:14.880 --> 10:17.640
be able to connect to Windows file shares.

10:17.640 --> 10:23.220
It's the continued progression of Chrome OS becoming a big boy operating system.

10:23.220 --> 10:28.120
First it was just for web interfaces, then we got Android app support, now Linux apps,

10:28.120 --> 10:29.800
and finally Windows network shares.

10:29.800 --> 10:33.040
I might actually be able to use this in my day to day.

10:33.040 --> 10:35.640
Now this feature has been around for a little while.

10:35.640 --> 10:40.640
It was first implemented back in March, but only now are they switching on the flag to

10:40.640 --> 10:42.120
actually enable it.

10:42.120 --> 10:46.920
Yeah, looks like you should be expecting to see it in the upcoming M70 release.

10:46.920 --> 10:52.400
Accompanying that, and really showing that Google is aiming for enterprises' big installations

10:52.400 --> 10:57.840
of Chrome OS, there is going to be a Chrome policy to enable or disable NetBio Samba share

10:57.840 --> 10:59.540
discovery automatically.

10:59.540 --> 11:03.080
By default for non-enterprises, that'll just be there, so when you pop up Chrome OS, you

11:03.080 --> 11:05.800
can automatically discover all the shares on your network.

11:05.800 --> 11:08.720
If you need more control, well, they've got a solution for you.

11:08.720 --> 11:12.840
This does beg the question of what's the point of Chrome OS then?

11:12.840 --> 11:16.280
Surely the point of it was that it was so simple.

11:16.280 --> 11:17.680
It was just a web browser.

11:17.680 --> 11:19.280
There was nothing to go wrong with it.

11:19.280 --> 11:22.160
There was nothing to maintain.

11:22.160 --> 11:28.400
Security was tight, and as they keep adding more and more features to it, it does make

11:28.400 --> 11:34.000
me wonder, well, what sets it apart from just a normal Linux desktop at that point?

11:34.000 --> 11:36.800
It has definitely lost its tight focus.

11:36.800 --> 11:41.000
Now they are adding things piecemeal and slowly, and it does seem like they've started with

11:41.000 --> 11:45.360
a minimal base and added things on as they could, so that might be better from a management

11:45.360 --> 11:49.880
and a security aspect, but the question remains, can they do this without making it feel bloated,

11:49.880 --> 11:52.760
and will it still be simple for end users to use?

11:52.760 --> 11:57.560
I think that it will, and maybe it's unfair to compare it to a proper Linux desktop because

11:57.560 --> 12:04.480
you can do so much more with the Linux desktop, but I do worry about feature creep and I worry

12:04.480 --> 12:08.280
maybe unnecessarily really because I suppose they have to broaden their markets, don't

12:08.280 --> 12:10.640
they, and they want to get into enterprise.

12:10.640 --> 12:15.800
Clearly that's what this is about, and they want to appeal to more and more people, and

12:15.800 --> 12:22.000
perhaps they have exhausted the market that they already have access to, and they need

12:22.000 --> 12:26.960
to implement these new features to be relevant to other markets, and because you can turn

12:26.960 --> 12:31.520
this stuff off, it means you can use it as you were anyway, so it's probably not going

12:31.520 --> 12:33.460
to affect the existing users.

12:33.460 --> 12:38.120
It does feel a bit like Google's exploring around to find out how many features are just

12:38.120 --> 12:42.240
enough to make it usable to a broader audience, but aren't too many.

12:42.240 --> 12:43.520
Does it stop here?

12:43.520 --> 12:44.520
Will we see more?

12:44.520 --> 12:45.520
I guess we wait and see.

12:45.520 --> 12:48.960
I think, though, that if they really want to crack the enterprise market, they need

12:48.960 --> 12:51.640
to think about longer support times.

12:51.640 --> 12:57.920
Just recently, the Chromebook Pixel, the original really expensive one, dropped out of support,

12:57.920 --> 13:01.840
and that was after five years, and that's five years since it first came out.

13:01.840 --> 13:06.200
Obviously there would have been people buying them a year or two into that, which doesn't

13:06.200 --> 13:09.160
seem like long enough to me, really.

13:09.160 --> 13:10.160
Four or five years support.

13:10.160 --> 13:14.960
If you look at something like Windows XP, how long was that supported for?

13:14.960 --> 13:20.240
And you look at Red Hat Enterprise Linux, you can get 10 years.

13:20.240 --> 13:25.440
I think that surely must be where they need to go next.

13:25.440 --> 13:28.840
I wonder, though, because it's coming from the phone marketplace where it's like two,

13:28.840 --> 13:32.000
three years of support, five years might seem kind of generous.

13:32.000 --> 13:35.160
Well, certainly in the consumer space, yeah.

13:35.160 --> 13:39.240
Most people's Windows laptops probably didn't last much longer until they slowed down to

13:39.240 --> 13:42.480
the point where they were unusable, and people used to go and buy a new one.

13:42.480 --> 13:48.120
Now they just buy an iPad to replace it, but I think in enterprise, I don't know, isn't

13:48.120 --> 13:51.960
five years, well, five years sounds about right, but it's not five years.

13:51.960 --> 13:52.960
Is it in reality?

13:52.960 --> 13:57.320
Because it's five years since the product is launched, and people don't necessarily

13:57.320 --> 14:02.480
get hold of it straight away, and it might be a year or two or maybe even more down the

14:02.480 --> 14:03.480
line.

14:03.480 --> 14:07.880
And so you're potentially looking at two to three years of actual usable support there,

14:07.880 --> 14:10.040
and I don't think that's going to wash in the enterprise.

14:10.040 --> 14:14.160
Yeah, and you do have to wonder, too, especially with such a connected operating system, how

14:14.160 --> 14:15.840
usable is it outside of the support?

14:15.840 --> 14:18.400
Without support, is it really even a good value proposition anymore?

14:18.400 --> 14:22.480
Well, I would say certainly not, because that's where the whole security aspect comes from,

14:22.480 --> 14:24.000
is staying up to date.

14:24.000 --> 14:30.920
And Chrome OS has been so good over the years at updating itself, and it's all been a flawless

14:30.920 --> 14:34.440
background thing that no one even notices.

14:34.440 --> 14:38.360
Whereas once you get to the end of that support, you're not getting your security updates anymore.

14:38.360 --> 14:40.240
It's just unusable at that point.

14:40.240 --> 14:42.720
Sounds like, Joe, you're still not sold on Chrome OS.

14:42.720 --> 14:46.960
No, I'm not, but I'm definitely not sold on Windows 10.

14:46.960 --> 14:52.920
There was a big kerfuffle this week about a feature that Microsoft slipped into a Windows

14:52.920 --> 14:58.680
Insider build, but then pulled out of it fairly quickly.

14:58.680 --> 15:01.920
So imagine this, you've just set up your new Windows machine.

15:01.920 --> 15:05.660
One of the first things I usually do is, well, install the web browser of my choice.

15:05.660 --> 15:11.360
You start doing that, and up pops this dialogue, hey there, you already have Microsoft Edge,

15:11.360 --> 15:14.160
the safer, faster browser for Windows.

15:14.160 --> 15:17.760
And then it's got a default there, just open Microsoft Edge, don't bother installing any

15:17.760 --> 15:20.280
of that other open source software that you've got.

15:20.280 --> 15:24.400
It's really not a surprise that they removed this straight away, but what were they thinking

15:24.400 --> 15:26.120
even trying this in the first place?

15:26.120 --> 15:31.880
I mean, okay, it didn't make it into a final release or anything, and it was just a very

15:31.880 --> 15:32.880
short experiment.

15:32.880 --> 15:39.040
But especially with all the antitrust stuff that they've had in Europe, why would they

15:39.040 --> 15:40.740
possibly do this?

15:40.740 --> 15:43.840
It does really bring back a bad taste from that era.

15:43.840 --> 15:46.960
Now I think it's fair to say that Google does some of their own, if you're using another

15:46.960 --> 15:51.760
browser when you're searching Google, they'll often pop up things suggesting that they prefer

15:51.760 --> 15:54.120
Chrome, they recommend Chrome to you.

15:54.120 --> 15:59.120
But using an online service versus an operating system, to me, I know the industry might think

15:59.120 --> 16:02.480
other things, but to me, those still aren't the same thing.

16:02.480 --> 16:08.700
Now when I read more into this, I was suddenly reminded of Proton, which is Valve's system

16:08.700 --> 16:12.000
for playing Windows games in Steam.

16:12.000 --> 16:16.480
And I remember talking about that and speculating, why are they doing this?

16:16.480 --> 16:19.000
And then it dawned on me.

16:19.000 --> 16:25.740
The reason that this big warning came up in Windows is because it's part of them moving

16:25.740 --> 16:30.200
towards an App Store only system for installing software.

16:30.200 --> 16:35.040
You will still have the option, at least for now, to install just random binaries downloaded

16:35.040 --> 16:41.160
from the web, but when you install something like Spotify, it then says, hey, why don't

16:41.160 --> 16:43.440
you just get it from the App Store?

16:43.440 --> 16:52.300
And so perhaps it was Valve seeing this coming that has kind of reignited the fire under

16:52.300 --> 16:57.920
Linux and Steam OS and that backup plan that they always had, because that was the primary

16:57.920 --> 17:01.600
reason or at least that's what we all speculated at the time before them coming up with Steam

17:01.600 --> 17:03.680
on Linux and Steam OS.

17:03.680 --> 17:11.440
It was because Microsoft might go to an iOS style, no sideloading, everything coming from

17:11.440 --> 17:13.560
the App Store system.

17:13.560 --> 17:20.040
And this seems to be more evidence of Windows, very, very slowly at least, moving towards

17:20.040 --> 17:21.040
that.

17:21.040 --> 17:26.200
Yeah, we've already seen some minimal versions that have more restrictions placed on them

17:26.200 --> 17:30.720
and Windows has become something of a connected internet operating system.

17:30.720 --> 17:35.600
Windows 10 versus Windows 7, for instance, well, it's a big difference from the old Windows

17:35.600 --> 17:39.120
that we all knew and, well, maybe not loved, but we're accustomed to.

17:39.120 --> 17:43.240
Yeah, suddenly it kind of all clicked together in my head and it made me realize that Valve

17:43.240 --> 17:47.920
are very clever for investing more into the Linux side of their business.

17:47.920 --> 17:51.320
So yeah, well done for seeing that coming.

17:51.320 --> 17:52.560
Suddenly it makes sense to me.

17:52.560 --> 17:55.040
Well, let's end with some excellent news.

17:55.040 --> 17:59.360
And we did talk about this on Linux Unplugged 266, so we'll not talk too much here.

17:59.360 --> 18:02.960
Microsoft Jupiter Broadcasting has joined forces with Linux Academy.

18:02.960 --> 18:07.160
Now you may have noticed a lack of adverts on shows since the beginning of September.

18:07.160 --> 18:08.160
That wasn't a mistake.

18:08.160 --> 18:09.720
That wasn't us forgetting to do them.

18:09.720 --> 18:12.680
That was part of this merger.

18:12.680 --> 18:15.880
Now I don't know about you, Wes, but I am incredibly happy about this.

18:15.880 --> 18:21.620
It means that I can now work on Jupiter Broadcasting basically full time and you've switched your

18:21.620 --> 18:22.620
job over, haven't you?

18:22.620 --> 18:25.080
Now you're doing podcasting full time.

18:25.080 --> 18:26.080
That's right.

18:26.080 --> 18:28.240
And yeah, I could not be more excited about this.

18:28.240 --> 18:31.840
We've all been putting a lot of work into this on both sides of the fence.

18:31.840 --> 18:36.700
And really Jupiter Broadcasting and Linux Academy were already pretty well aligned.

18:36.700 --> 18:41.240
We both care a huge amount about Linux, open source technologies, and inspiring people

18:41.240 --> 18:43.800
to use those and create awesome stuff.

18:43.800 --> 18:49.720
Now we can leverage all of that together, create much better content, have more focus,

18:49.720 --> 18:51.400
and inspire the community.

18:51.400 --> 18:55.320
Now nothing is really going to change apart from the lack of adverts because, well, they

18:55.320 --> 18:58.680
liked what we were doing and they want us to keep doing it.

18:58.680 --> 19:03.320
But one thing that has changed is User Error has come back with a new set of hosts, including

19:03.320 --> 19:08.780
me and Alan Pope, better known as Popey, and Daniel Foray from Elementary.

19:08.780 --> 19:15.560
And also a fourth seat, which was empty on episode 48, which was kind of a comeback episode.

19:15.560 --> 19:17.160
But that will be kind of rotating.

19:17.160 --> 19:19.280
Chris will come along sometimes.

19:19.280 --> 19:24.120
Maybe even you, Wes, maybe other friends of the show, basically whoever we want.

19:24.120 --> 19:26.720
So do check it out, error.show slash 48.

19:26.720 --> 19:27.720
It was good fun.

19:27.720 --> 19:29.080
I enjoyed it a lot.

19:29.080 --> 19:32.360
I think it's a great show and it's a great rebirth.

19:32.360 --> 19:36.520
And it's just a sign of more good things to come as a result of this merger.

19:36.520 --> 19:39.000
Yeah, I am really excited about this.

19:39.000 --> 19:42.560
It's a huge opportunity for me and for us all.

19:42.560 --> 19:48.080
And it means that we can open source some of the code that makes the backend stuff work

19:48.080 --> 19:50.040
and also help out the community.

19:50.040 --> 19:55.840
So do check out episode 266 of Linux Unplugged, where we speak about it quite a bit more.

19:55.840 --> 19:59.960
Now if you don't want to miss that or any of the exciting stories we cover here on Linux
