00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,680
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, our weekly take on Linux and the open source world.

2
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:21,240
This is episode 38, recorded on January 28th, 2018.

3
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:22,240
I'm Chris.

4
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:23,240
And I'm Joe.

5
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:24,240
Hello, Joe.

6
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:25,440
It is good to be connected with you again.

7
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:29,920
Hey, we get to start out this week talking about something that you and I chat about

8
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:31,860
off air quite a bit.

9
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:35,160
And that's the future of open source powered mobile devices.

10
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:38,260
Yeah, and one of the great hopes for that is plasma mobile.

11
00:00:38,260 --> 00:00:43,480
And this week, we've had a blog post from one of the KDE community members about testing

12
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:46,840
of ISOs for plasma mobile.

13
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:55,700
And they are x86 ISOs, which you can run on either KVM or QEMU or VirtualBox or as I did

14
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:58,160
on an actual bit of hardware.

15
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:00,160
And I've got the perfect device for this.

16
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:06,480
It's a little 11 inch Asus Vivobook, which is touchscreen, but with the keyboard, obviously.

17
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:09,940
And I tried it out, and I was really impressed with it.

18
00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:14,100
This is some action they're taking after they conducted a survey to see how users might

19
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:17,120
be able to best contribute back to plasma mobile.

20
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:18,980
And it was, let us test it.

21
00:01:18,980 --> 00:01:23,400
And so they've put some effort into making it, like Joe said, testable on multiple different

22
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:26,160
virtualization platforms and on real hardware.

23
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:29,980
I gave it a go in VMware Workstation, and it doesn't work.

24
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:33,880
So that's one of the virtualization platforms you might skip right over.

25
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:36,600
So I'm pretty curious about your experience, Joe.

26
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:40,120
Well, it boots saying that it's KDE neon.

27
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:45,000
And the thing is that because it's got the Linux kernel, and it's got all of the standard

28
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,280
desktop Linux hardware acceleration drivers and all that kind of thing, it means that

29
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:55,960
you don't have any of the lag that you have with ropey driver integration on mobile devices.

30
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:59,600
And of course, you've got the power of the i3 processor as well.

31
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:05,640
So it was very smooth, and everything pretty much worked.

32
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:08,280
It's not really a desktop operating system, obviously.

33
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:10,880
So it's not the kind of thing that you're going to install and keep.

34
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:12,800
I just run it live off the USB stick.

35
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:16,080
But everything just seemed to be working well.

36
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:19,680
And I was quite surprised because the last time I tried it out on a mobile device, it

37
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:23,680
was kind of working and not really that well.

38
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:26,120
And yeah, this has got a lot of rough edges.

39
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:30,280
As they say, it's alpha quality.

40
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:33,840
And I think that it is kind of decent alpha quality.

41
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:37,280
Did you find the text readable and all of the touch targets tappable?

42
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:40,400
Yeah, all that stuff worked perfectly.

43
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,080
That is pretty impressive for an alpha.

44
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:45,920
The other thing that strikes me is they are coming to the people a bit.

45
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:51,000
So they've created a plasma mobile matrix room that folks can give feedback.

46
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,200
And they also have a plasma mobile telegram group, which people that are on mobile may

47
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:58,060
be very likely to join to give them feedback.

48
00:02:58,060 --> 00:03:02,000
And then they have the traditional mailing lists and IRC rooms that an open source project

49
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
tends to have.

50
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,840
What I really like the best about this is the humble, modest attitude that they have.

51
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:11,160
They're not coming out saying this is the most amazing thing ever.

52
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:14,040
They're coming out and saying, we need people to test it.

53
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:15,220
We're working on this.

54
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:16,220
It's work in progress.

55
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:18,200
It's alpha quality.

56
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:22,240
And that makes me much more forgiving towards it.

57
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:26,240
If they tried to say it was a finished product, then I'd be pretty down on it.

58
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:28,080
But it's not a finished product.

59
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:33,080
They want the community to get involved with testing and making it better.

60
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:40,800
And I really do feel that it is the best hope for an interface at least in terms of a mobile

61
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:43,720
operating system that's based on Linux.

62
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:49,400
It also strikes me that this effort isn't tied to a particular hardware initiative,

63
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:54,540
which if you look back at previous attempts, it's almost always tied to a specific hardware's

64
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:55,960
success or failure.

65
00:03:55,960 --> 00:04:01,040
And when that hardware succeeds or likely fails, then the contributions to the mobile

66
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:05,240
operating system cease, even when it's just contributions back upstream.

67
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:11,160
Whereas this is a general mobile touch platform that is hardware agnostic, it just takes advantage

68
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:12,920
of the Linux underpinnings.

69
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:18,680
And so it could just continue on at a slow but steady and humble pace for years until

70
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:20,840
the right device comes along to run it.

71
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:26,520
Well, that right device may well be sooner than we think if Purism actually deliver on

72
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:27,520
their promises.

73
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:28,520
Yeah.

74
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:33,760
After a couple of months, we have some news about what's going on with the Librem 5 phone.

75
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:36,480
Purism has posted a Librem 5 phone progress report.

76
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:40,880
And it mostly focuses around the design team and what they're working on about putting

77
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:46,200
that team together and creating a unified look for PureOS devices.

78
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:49,920
And there's hints of something I've heard of before in here, Joe, something familiar.

79
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:50,920
Yeah.

80
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:51,920
Convergence.

81
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:54,160
We've heard that word before, haven't we?

82
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:58,160
Realistically, Joe, laptops, tablets, phones, it's not enough.

83
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:01,240
Using GTK, Qt, not enough.

84
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:04,680
Also need to have our own operating system and then, of course, make it converge.

85
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:09,720
Yeah, but convergence is one of those words that doesn't really mean anything or it can

86
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:11,320
mean so many different things.

87
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:17,340
And I think that in the case of Purism, what they mean by it is more a case of a consistent

88
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:23,440
look and feel rather than devices that will act as a mobile device or a proper computer.

89
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,160
Ah, we need a new term then.

90
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:29,080
Well, whatever you want to call it, the fact is you're going to need to have GNOME running

91
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:34,600
on the mobile device and the desktop PureOS.

92
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:37,280
Otherwise you're not going to have a consistent experience.

93
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:41,820
And that's what's confusing about this because they're very enthusiastic about Plasma Mobile,

94
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:43,320
as am I.

95
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:48,480
And even say in this blog post that GNOME is less advanced when it comes to mobile.

96
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:54,920
And yet they're having to keep both options open because of this convergence thing.

97
00:05:54,920 --> 00:06:00,920
And maybe the best strategy would just be to say, we'll have GNOME over here for the

98
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:06,760
desktop operating system and we'll have Plasma Mobile for the Librem 5.

99
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:08,440
That seems like the smart approach.

100
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:12,560
For resource reasons, if nothing else, I don't know how many times as a community we're going

101
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:17,040
to watch open source companies go down this path where they think that they can build

102
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:21,720
the one true operating system that will work across all the devices that developers will

103
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:23,520
want to run to.

104
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:30,720
And meanwhile, larger companies in this space, Dell, Dell, they are succeeding because they're

105
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:35,640
shipping vanilla Ubuntu strapped onto their hardware.

106
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:40,640
And they're trying to innovate at the hardware level and they're seeing a huge growth in

107
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:43,360
the Sputnik product line because of that strategy.

108
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:48,040
And it just seems on the other opposite end of the spectrum in an attempt to differentiate,

109
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:51,540
smaller OEMs are trying to build their own operating systems.

110
00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:56,480
But their customer base, Linux users, are smart enough to sit back and go, that's not

111
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:57,480
sustainable.

112
00:06:57,480 --> 00:07:00,240
That's not even something that is in demand.

113
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:04,820
So their own customer base is hip to what they're trying to do and it never succeeds.

114
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:09,040
And instead you have companies, which Purism seems to be on the path to becoming one of

115
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:15,760
these, unfortunately, that split their attention and they become a jack of all, master of none.

116
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:22,300
When you read this update, it is clear that they should be all in on KDE's Plasma Mobile.

117
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:23,300
It's clear.

118
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:24,300
They praise it.

119
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:28,800
They have a line in here where they say Purism's contribution to KDE may be generally focused

120
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:33,400
on hardware integration and testing rather than design because it's good to go.

121
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:36,760
They think it's just pretty much there, they're blown away by it.

122
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:40,640
Then they talk about how Gnome is just this big pile of hurt that they're going to have

123
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:43,880
to submit a bunch of patches upstream to make it work correctly.

124
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:49,200
So that way the tiny user base that uses PureOS will be able to run the same crazy desktop

125
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:53,400
GTK applications on their phone.

126
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:55,920
How does this make sense to anybody that's organizing this project?

127
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:59,120
Well, I think the tendency is to be quite insular, isn't it?

128
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:04,720
And to think that just because you and all your team are using PureOS, you want to have

129
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:08,880
this convergence and you're kind of assuming that every laptop that you're selling with

130
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:11,360
PureOS is having it kept on there.

131
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:16,320
When in reality, I would have thought that most of the kind of people who want to buy

132
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:22,520
a Linux laptop, they have their own preferences about what Linux they want to use and what

133
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:24,080
desktop environment and all the rest of it.

134
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,600
So they want to customize it.

135
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:27,160
And so I'd be very surprised.

136
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:33,120
Well, I would like to learn the reality of people who have bought a Purism laptop.

137
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:37,940
Have you kept PureOS on there or have you installed Arch or Ubuntu or Fedora or whatever

138
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:39,680
it is that you normally use?

139
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:42,520
Let us know at LinuxActionNews on the Twitter.

140
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:46,440
I would be curious too or at LinuxActionNews.com slash contact.

141
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:47,820
That is a good data point to collect in.

142
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:52,080
But in the meantime, if I could be hired as a consultant for a moment, I would advise

143
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,080
this.

144
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:56,020
If you want to differentiate, if you want to go all in on something, differentiate by

145
00:08:56,020 --> 00:08:57,520
shipping plasma.

146
00:08:57,520 --> 00:09:01,680
Be the one vendor in this marketplace that's really killing it with plasma.

147
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:06,000
And if you want convergence, start with the mobile device, nail the mobile experience.

148
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,240
You will have more customers there than you've ever had with the laptops.

149
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:13,120
And then you'll have demand to make plasma work on your laptops.

150
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:15,200
And that's where the conversions can happen.

151
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:20,680
And QML and Qt and the plasma desktop are all perfectly positioned to enable you to

152
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:21,680
do this.

153
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:26,240
You don't really end up differentiating yourself in the Linux market by shipping yet another

154
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,240
GTK desktop.

155
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:29,160
That's kind of boring at this point.

156
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:32,040
You want to stand out to Linux users and ship something different?

157
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:33,040
Build it on plasma.

158
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:37,440
Ironically, he says, as he's switching back to the GNOME 3 desktop this week.

159
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,640
Yeah.

160
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:45,720
Well, another company that has heavily relied upon crowdfunding is Mycroft.

161
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:50,280
And this week, the Kickstarter went live for Mycroft Mark 2.

162
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:54,740
And already it has smashed through its goal within a matter of hours.

163
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:58,200
So this is definitely happening.

164
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:01,640
And they've made a lot of promises here.

165
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:06,120
They've said that they accept that last time they made some mistakes and they've learned

166
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:08,260
from that.

167
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:15,640
And $129, it's quite expensive for a voice assistant, although one with a screen, it's

168
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:17,800
not too bad.

169
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:20,200
But they are not messing around anymore.

170
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:22,920
They're not pitching this as a development device.

171
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:25,100
They're saying this is consumer ready.

172
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:28,720
They are making massive, massive promises here.

173
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:33,760
And as much as I really want them to deliver on those, I am somewhat skeptical to say the

174
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:34,760
least, I'm afraid.

175
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:39,520
Yeah, they really do double down on the beam forming microphones that take six microphone

176
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:44,100
inputs, locate the person speaking, and then hone in on them.

177
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:48,520
They talk about the two 10 watt speakers that are in this thing.

178
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:52,920
And they talk in here about how they worked with one of their partners to build in acoustic

179
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:59,520
echo cancellation, noise reduction, and other technologies to help Mycroft hear you while

180
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:01,580
it's really blaring loud sounds.

181
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:06,320
This is, in my opinion, what the Amazon show could have been.

182
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:08,120
This is what Amazon should have built.

183
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:09,920
I can see why it's doing well.

184
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:16,520
It's promising room filling sound, open source backed software, and a new screen interface

185
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:18,400
that looks pretty good.

186
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:23,000
Yeah, and integrating with what Mozilla has been doing with Project Common Voice, so they're

187
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,120
no longer having to rely on proprietary backends.

188
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:34,080
It all on paper sounds amazing, but the question that is on my lips is what are beans?

189
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:39,520
We've seen that video that Popey made of the Mark One, and it was terrible.

190
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:41,040
And that was the software's fault.

191
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:46,900
And okay, it's come along a little way since then, but realistically, how much cash are

192
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:52,120
they going to need to have injected from this Kickstarter to bring that software up to a

193
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:58,020
standard where it can compete with the Amazon one and the Google one and the Apple one?

194
00:11:58,020 --> 00:12:00,800
It just seems farfetched to me.

195
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:07,140
As my primary concern as well is the one question they're not really answering in their previous

196
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:12,440
blog posts and in this Kickstarter post is what is significantly different about this

197
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:15,200
unit that will improve the software situation?

198
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:19,720
Because if it was simply just hardware resources, then putting the Microsoft software on a faster

199
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:24,160
Raspberry Pi would have made it better, and we all know that's clearly not the case.

200
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:27,520
So significantly, what's changed about the software?

201
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:29,520
In the video, the voice sounds different.

202
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:32,320
It sounds a little newer as well.

203
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:36,800
And they're using language that is somewhat disingenuous, and so that is a bit of a red

204
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,320
flag on a Kickstarter for me.

205
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,800
I'll give you an example.

206
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:44,660
AI and voice technology are too important to our collective future to remain the property

207
00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:47,000
of the Silicon Valley giants.

208
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:55,160
The mark two by Mycroft is the device challenging them, which that's a pretty big exaggeration

209
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:56,380
to begin with right there.

210
00:12:56,380 --> 00:12:57,800
That's a lot to swallow.

211
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:01,980
But then later on, they lean into how the community is building this device and how

212
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:03,880
it's open source.

213
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:10,080
A key differentiator, they say, is that Mycroft's skill list is infinitely growing thanks to

214
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:12,260
our robust developer community.

215
00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:17,320
They're building skills that serve everyone's needs, not just for the corporations behind

216
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:18,320
them.

217
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:22,620
In addition to standard skills like weather updates and timers, you'll find these ones.

218
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:28,600
And then they list skills that are backed by corporations like Philip Hughes, YouTube,

219
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:34,800
Pandora, NPR, Roku, Facebook, Wolfram Alpha.

220
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,280
You get the picture.

221
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:41,140
Their front and center skills are, quote, for the corporations behind them.

222
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:44,180
And so they say they have an infinite list of skills.

223
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:51,240
From what I could tell, there is 31, 32 official skills that are created by Mycroft now.

224
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:55,860
There are 16 community skills that are considered functioning, 16.

225
00:13:55,860 --> 00:14:01,860
As of January 28, Amazon's voice assistant, the Echo, has 24,000 skills.

226
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:07,620
And if you look at just the skills that are rated four stars and above, there are 5,201

227
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:09,720
of them.

228
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:15,160
Compare that to Google Assistant, which has 1,800 different actions available right now.

229
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:19,560
So when they're using language that this is the device to challenge the Echo or the Google

230
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:25,220
Assistant, and that they have an infinite list of skills, that's a lot of exaggeration

231
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:26,220
for me to swallow.

232
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:28,300
It sounds like they're selling a little too hard.

233
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:31,380
Well, yeah, they are definitely exaggerating.

234
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:35,340
And you kind of have to do that for PR, don't you, if you want to sell the units and get

235
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:38,620
the money in and then hire the developers?

236
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:44,180
I just really want to give this the benefit of the doubt because they did make some mistakes

237
00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:48,600
and they have said that they've learned from them, from the manufacturing to the logistics

238
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:51,480
of actually sending them out and all of that stuff.

239
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:54,980
It sounds like it's going to be good.

240
00:14:54,980 --> 00:14:59,620
And the mock-up, the voice was working really well, it answered really quickly.

241
00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:05,780
If they can actually deliver that, then I think the skills list will grow very quickly.

242
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:10,580
And okay, they've exaggerated for now, but we need something like this.

243
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:16,140
I personally don't, but there are so many people who use these voice assistants.

244
00:15:16,140 --> 00:15:20,580
It's a growing market and we need to have something good and an open source.

245
00:15:20,580 --> 00:15:25,620
The problem I have with that analysis is you could say those same exact words for the first

246
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:27,660
Kickstarter they did.

247
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:29,080
Nothing's changed in that regard.

248
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:30,220
They're still exaggerating.

249
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:31,900
This is still something we need.

250
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:36,980
It's like they play to our emotional open source Linux user buttons here.

251
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:41,200
It's the same reason why convergence devices are getting funded.

252
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:46,500
There is a certain category of dream device that us geeks have and we're willing to fund

253
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:47,500
it.

254
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:51,420
But don't you think that they are best placed with all the experience that they've got with

255
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:57,740
the mark one and now going forward with this mark two, they are surely in the best position

256
00:15:57,740 --> 00:16:02,980
to have some sort of open source alternative to Amazon and Google and Apple.

257
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:03,980
Hmm.

258
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:04,980
Maybe.

259
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:09,980
Maybe that's sort of like saying that open BSD is an alternative to Windows and Mac OS.

260
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:14,420
The reality is, is that the third player in the market is either going to be Microsoft

261
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:17,260
with Cortana or Apple with the HomePod.

262
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:23,140
And the first player is so far ahead right now, Amazon, and Google had a huge, they just

263
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:24,460
released numbers.

264
00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:29,500
Three percent of assistance sold over the holiday season were Google assistant devices.

265
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:36,460
So Google seeing a huge growth in their assistant, a distant third is going to be HomePod or Cortana.

266
00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:42,100
And then maybe far off in the distance, there's a, there's a great spot for Mycroft.

267
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:46,040
I hate that you're right, but I just, I can't argue with you anymore.

268
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:49,620
If they could answer a few fundamental questions, what's significantly different about this

269
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:52,900
software stack that's going to make it better?

270
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:57,420
I would love to know more about what drives that screen and how that's created.

271
00:16:57,420 --> 00:17:00,940
If they had more to offer when it came to software that was a companion that would run

272
00:17:00,940 --> 00:17:04,920
on the desktop and an app that would run on the phone, and so I could have one centralized

273
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:10,260
Mycroft server, these would be pretty significant differences that might appeal to businesses

274
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:13,380
or small groups of people or open source projects.

275
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:17,660
But as it stands right now, I'm not seeing the market appeal.

276
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:26,020
I wish the open source private argument was a winner in this category, but the market

277
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:31,940
has so clearly demonstrated that they're willing to put these units from Google in their house.

278
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:37,380
Privacy is on the total end of the requirement spectrum and they're going at this all in

279
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:42,340
positioning this as privacy respecting because it's open source, community powered because

280
00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:47,020
it's open source, but the market doesn't give any consideration to that when they're buying

281
00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:49,260
these lady tubes.

282
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:52,020
I think you're right, but I think that there is a potential market for this.

283
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:57,500
I don't think that it's going to be anywhere near the market for the Amazon and Google

284
00:17:57,500 --> 00:18:03,860
ones, but I think that there are enough people who care about this stuff within our community

285
00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:10,060
to make it a viable business as long as it's good enough because there's people like you

286
00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:14,620
who want to control your lights and I heard you talking about wanting to turn your heater

287
00:18:14,620 --> 00:18:17,140
on from a bed and all that kind of stuff.

288
00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:21,560
So there is a market for it, but they have to deliver on their promises.

289
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:29,260
If they don't deliver on their promises this time, then that's it, it's finished.

290
00:18:29,260 --> 00:18:34,420
Last.ting.com, go there to support this show and get $25 in service credit if you bring

291
00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:38,660
a device and if you don't have one or you're ready for something new, they'll give you

292
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:40,780
$25 off a device.

293
00:18:40,780 --> 00:18:41,780
Think of that in a moment.

294
00:18:41,780 --> 00:18:42,780
I'll tell you more about that.

295
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:44,900
But first let me just sort of set up the ground rules here.

296
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:46,580
Ting is just simple mobile.

297
00:18:46,580 --> 00:18:49,600
It's $6 for the line and then you just pay for what you use.

298
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:53,460
And here in the States they have CDMA and GSM networks, so you just pick whichever one

299
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:59,760
is superior in your location, nationwide coverage, no contracts, pay for what you use.

300
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:03,140
Your minutes, your messages, and your megabytes.

301
00:19:03,140 --> 00:19:06,140
Whatever you use, that's what you pay, plus Uncle Sam's cut.

302
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:10,940
For me, it's so handy to have a MiFi that I turn on and off from time to time when I'm

303
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:11,940
traveling.

304
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:13,540
It's also very simple to do that with Ting.

305
00:19:13,540 --> 00:19:17,500
They have a great control panel and I can go in there and see how much the MiFi is using,

306
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:18,580
see if I'm comfortable with that.

307
00:19:18,580 --> 00:19:20,180
I can set usage alerts.

308
00:19:20,180 --> 00:19:21,860
It's super good functionality.

309
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:24,540
But remember I was telling you about $25 off a device?

310
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:29,060
Well on Ting's blog right now, do me a favor, start by going to last.ting.com so that way

311
00:19:29,060 --> 00:19:31,520
they know we sent you there.

312
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:36,900
Over on Ting's blog they have Hack Your Phone Plan, a smart phone plan for under $20.

313
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:39,860
It's essentially $16 a month plus the taxes.

314
00:19:39,860 --> 00:19:42,620
So it works out to be around $20.

315
00:19:42,620 --> 00:19:43,620
It's not a pipe dream.

316
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:46,420
It's something that they have a blog post about right now and you can learn more about

317
00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:47,420
it.

318
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:48,420
Start by going to last.ting.com.

319
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:58,380
Okay, so it's only a few months until we get Ubuntu 18.04, the LTS, and this week Will

320
00:19:58,380 --> 00:20:03,660
Cook has announced that that is going to default to Xorg.

321
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:06,980
It's not going to default to Wayland like 17.10 did.

322
00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:12,340
Wayland will be available as a session, but the headline here is that they're going back

323
00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:18,220
to Xorg for the LTS which is going to be used for five years, which you cannot argue with

324
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:19,660
the logic of it I don't think.

325
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:23,540
Right, they released 17.10 in October of 2017.

326
00:20:23,540 --> 00:20:28,500
They shipped it with Wayland by default and they've been collecting usage information,

327
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:33,300
bug reports, and they said they've just simply decided to ship Xorg by default now since

328
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:34,660
this is an LTS.

329
00:20:34,660 --> 00:20:38,740
Unlike JOSET, Wayland is still installed, but they broke it down to three main reasons

330
00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:41,620
why Xorg is going to be the default in that dropdown.

331
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:46,940
Number one, again, LTS releases, typically a larger percentage of businesses use these.

332
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:53,540
Screen sharing in software like web RTC services, Google Hangouts, Skype, anything where you

333
00:20:53,540 --> 00:20:57,400
have a button to share your screen, that's not working under Wayland yet.

334
00:20:57,400 --> 00:21:02,460
It may still be a ways off and that's a big feature that corporate desktops use.

335
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:07,820
But desktop control like RDP and VNC, they don't really work so well.

336
00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:09,620
They do work under Xorg though.

337
00:21:09,620 --> 00:21:14,940
And then number three, which is actually the number one issue that affects me, under Xorg

338
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:20,580
when the Gnome shell crashes, it just reloads because Xorg is still running.

339
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:24,240
But under Wayland, Gnome shell is the compositor.

340
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:29,620
It is doing all of the heavy lifting and if it crashes, your entire graphical session's

341
00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:30,620
gone.

342
00:21:30,620 --> 00:21:33,540
It's a pretty damning indictment of Gnome, isn't it, that you have to have a different

343
00:21:33,540 --> 00:21:36,660
display server because it crashes so often.

344
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:40,680
They must have had to tiptoe around this issue pretty carefully with their new re-established

345
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:45,820
relationship with Gnome because they write in the post, the point about when things go

346
00:21:45,820 --> 00:21:51,220
wrong with Gnome is an architecture issue of Gnome shell and mutter and the only way

347
00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:57,620
to fix it is a massive architecture change or using Xorg.

348
00:21:57,620 --> 00:22:03,620
Which, as I said, is a damning indictment and one of the many reasons I use XFCE, I'm

349
00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:04,620
afraid.

350
00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:08,580
Yeah, although Gnome Shell 4 may address this issue, there's currently discussions in place

351
00:22:08,580 --> 00:22:13,740
to re-architect Gnome so that it's more modular, but if they did that, it would break extensions

352
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:14,740
horribly.

353
00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:19,700
Yeah, but the thing is that Wayland is the future and we need to start moving over to

354
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:25,900
it and we need to start testing it properly, but a five-year LTS for Ubuntu, I don't think

355
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:27,940
is the right place to do that.

356
00:22:27,940 --> 00:22:35,100
They tried with 17.10 and they will almost certainly go back in 18.10, but the LTS, you

357
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:43,260
need it to work absolutely solidly and okay, Xorg is old and you've got these security

358
00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:49,780
problems and all sorts of issues, but it's been working for the last 20-odd years and

359
00:22:49,780 --> 00:22:54,980
it's been working for the entire history of Ubuntu, so give it another two years and hopefully

360
00:22:54,980 --> 00:22:59,100
at that point it will be solid enough, but I think you have to admire the fact that they

361
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:05,340
just are willing to accept this and say, no, it's not ready for the LTS and we're not going

362
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:08,760
to have this new flashy thing, we're going to stick with the old thing because we know

363
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:10,100
it works solidly.

364
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:14,340
And you know they tried it and it's data-driven, they gave it a go in 17.10 which was the logical

365
00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:19,140
place to try it, and at the end of the day, if you still want to be a Wayland warrior,

366
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:23,540
you can drop that box down, choose Wayland and submit bug reports all day long.

367
00:23:23,540 --> 00:23:28,820
Yeah, or just enjoy no screen tearing or all the other benefits if your hardware and software

368
00:23:28,820 --> 00:23:30,620
setup supports it.

369
00:23:30,620 --> 00:23:35,020
So yeah, it's kind of the best of both worlds and we're only talking about a default, which

370
00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:38,940
is what most people would use, but anyone who wants to use Wayland, at least it's in

371
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:40,980
there to use if you want.

372
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:42,420
Now here's a question for you, Joe.

373
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:48,460
What do you think is going to resolve first, fully fixed from Spectre and Meltdown or Wayland

374
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:51,180
shipping default on most Linux desktops?

375
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:53,260
That is a very tricky question.

376
00:23:53,260 --> 00:23:59,740
Meltdown I think is easier, but Spectre, that could be five years maybe before that's properly

377
00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:05,540
sorted out, or even longer really because we need new hardware, don't we, by the looks

378
00:24:05,540 --> 00:24:06,540
of things.

379
00:24:06,540 --> 00:24:10,820
Well, perhaps the middle finger of Mr. Linus Torvalds can help speed things along.

380
00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:16,100
He was in the news again this week for telling Intel how he feels about their current approach

381
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:17,100
to fixing all of this.

382
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:18,860
Yeah, he's not happy, is he?

383
00:24:18,860 --> 00:24:19,860
To say the least.

384
00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:26,100
No, he's essentially calling Intel out for shipping mitigation as a feature that you

385
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:31,100
can turn on or off, and he suspects that most people will leave it off for the performance

386
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:35,380
improvements of it, and he thinks it's utter garbage that they're doing this.

387
00:24:35,380 --> 00:24:40,540
The patch quality, the code quality says are awful, and Intel's management must be insane

388
00:24:40,540 --> 00:24:44,860
if they think they can turn this thing around into a feature of future processors for the

389
00:24:44,860 --> 00:24:45,860
next few years.

390
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:50,660
Yeah, and he even goes so far as to speculate that they're doing it this way because they

391
00:24:50,660 --> 00:24:54,260
don't want to have to recall millions of processors.

392
00:24:54,260 --> 00:24:58,660
This is a pretty big statement to make against Intel because they must have a pretty close

393
00:24:58,660 --> 00:25:02,000
working relationship with the Linux kernel development team.

394
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:06,700
There's a lot of code in the Linux kernel for Intel processors, plus their networking

395
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:10,300
stack, their graphics stacks, all the controllers that Intel makes.

396
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:14,240
It's a pretty key relationship, and I wasn't really sure how Intel was going to respond

397
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:18,620
to this because they're essentially calling them out on a lot of different issues from

398
00:25:18,620 --> 00:25:23,260
trying to deceive consumers, not fixing this thing for years, and like Joe said, trying

399
00:25:23,260 --> 00:25:24,580
to avoid a recall.

400
00:25:24,580 --> 00:25:26,100
That's inflammatory stuff.

401
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:27,300
Was Intel going to sue?

402
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:29,900
Was Intel going to release some sort of statement?

403
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:32,500
And they seem to have released a response at least.

404
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:36,660
They wrote a response to the register saying that they take the feedback of industry partners

405
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:42,660
seriously, and they are actively engaging with the Linux community, including Linus,

406
00:25:42,660 --> 00:25:45,820
as they seek to work together on a solution.

407
00:25:45,820 --> 00:25:47,980
Reed, we're lowering up.

408
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:50,340
No, I don't know.

409
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:53,260
They've got to be pretty scared, haven't they, Intel, at this point, because there are a

410
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:59,460
lot of lawsuits, class action lawsuits and stuff that are brewing, and this could maybe

411
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:01,100
possibly take them down.

412
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:03,500
Jesus, AMD sending you a check now?

413
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:12,300
Well, I mean, I've been saying it for a while that Intel need to get on this arm train because

414
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:16,100
otherwise the arm in the server room is going to eat their lunch.

415
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:21,380
And it's not going to happen for a while, but combine it with this, and okay, I'm not

416
00:26:21,380 --> 00:26:27,380
saying that this year they're going to go bust, but you can see a sort of fairly steady

417
00:26:27,380 --> 00:26:34,020
decline if they don't step up, and I think they just ought to start manufacturing arm

418
00:26:34,020 --> 00:26:36,660
processors, licensing those and making them.

419
00:26:36,660 --> 00:26:43,260
That would be a good revenue stream for them, and make some x86 processors that don't have

420
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:44,500
these vulnerabilities in them.

421
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:45,780
Yeah, you might be onto something.

422
00:26:45,780 --> 00:26:49,080
I mean, they have sort of missed the boat on mobile, and they can't really pull the

423
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:53,620
trigger on graphics to the point where they're even now working with AMD to ship AMD graphics

424
00:26:53,620 --> 00:26:55,460
with Intel CPUs.

425
00:26:55,460 --> 00:26:58,580
It is sort of remarkable where they've gotten to the last thing they've really remained

426
00:26:58,580 --> 00:27:02,220
good at is desktop CPUs, and now we have this problem.

427
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:07,860
And the other thing this is exposing is how slow Intel is to make changes.

428
00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:15,300
It's exposing this slow design and build process that has gotten murky over the years, and

429
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:19,540
it's going to prevent them from responding to this issue for several years.

430
00:27:19,540 --> 00:27:21,820
Some people like Linus are speculating three years.

431
00:27:21,820 --> 00:27:26,860
Well, yeah, if you think about it, the time it takes to design and manufacture a CPU,

432
00:27:26,860 --> 00:27:31,300
they've probably got the next two or even three generations already designed and underway

433
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:36,100
with all the testing and prototyping and all the rest of it, and so you can't really expect

434
00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:41,100
them to make major changes to them until, well, maybe they might scrap the third one

435
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:45,300
out or something, but they have CPUs to ship.

436
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:46,780
And you talked about desktop.

437
00:27:46,780 --> 00:27:52,600
Well, I think one of the major areas for them is Xeons, isn't it, for servers?

438
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:57,820
And that is where I think they're in the most danger of being taken over by these ARM clusters.

439
00:27:57,820 --> 00:28:04,340
In the meantime, you can pry my six-core i7 CPU out of my cold, dead hands.

440
00:28:04,340 --> 00:28:06,300
It's a great desktop chip for me.

441
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:07,300
Yeah, it is.

442
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:13,440
Let's hope that they can find some way around these vulnerabilities and have it not impact

443
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:15,240
performance too much.

444
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:19,580
But one camp that didn't get any heads up about these vulnerabilities were the BSDs.

445
00:28:19,580 --> 00:28:21,380
Yeah, that's a bit embarrassing.

446
00:28:21,380 --> 00:28:26,060
It makes you wonder where do they rank, and CSO Magazine is picking up on this thread

447
00:28:26,060 --> 00:28:31,500
and having some fun with it and speculates that perhaps the BSDs are slowly dying, and

448
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:34,340
it's just the BSD developers who don't realize it.

449
00:28:34,340 --> 00:28:38,540
Yeah, I had to put this in just to troll the BSD people.

450
00:28:38,540 --> 00:28:42,660
I think that it's quite speculative, isn't it?

451
00:28:42,660 --> 00:28:45,480
It's saying that there's not many developers.

452
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:49,480
The reason that there's not many bugs found in the BSD kernels is that there just aren't

453
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:56,900
many people looking, and that if you look at the number of developers, it is significantly

454
00:28:56,900 --> 00:29:03,020
lower than Linux, and that there's not many people using BSD in production.

455
00:29:03,020 --> 00:29:07,560
The odd one like Netflix, just small companies, I don't know.

456
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:14,820
It seems a bit tabloidy, but I just thought it would be funny to troll the BSD people.

457
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:21,180
I looked into it, and so the whole article really hinges around a talk that happened

458
00:29:21,180 --> 00:29:25,820
to the 34C3 conference in Germany at the end of December.

459
00:29:25,820 --> 00:29:32,020
The director of penetration testing at IO Active held this talk, and it was really more

460
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:34,440
about promoting his company.

461
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:38,740
The talk itself was a little already off the mark, and then this article is based on it,

462
00:29:38,740 --> 00:29:42,860
but this individual from IO Active who was giving the talk said that he looked around

463
00:29:42,860 --> 00:29:46,660
at the different BSD kernel vulnerability reports and saw how they compared to Linux, and he

464
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:51,860
thought to himself, how come there's only a handful of BSD security kernel bugs released

465
00:29:51,860 --> 00:29:53,360
every year as an advisory?

466
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:54,360
I'm going through the notes.

467
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:55,360
I only see a couple a year.

468
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:56,360
Can that be?

469
00:29:56,360 --> 00:30:00,660
Could it be their code is so good, or could it be because no one is looking?

470
00:30:00,660 --> 00:30:06,380
So he himself started digging into the code, and he found 115 kernel bugs across three

471
00:30:06,380 --> 00:30:13,460
BSDs, including 30 for free BSD, 25 for open BSD, and 60 for net BSD.

472
00:30:13,460 --> 00:30:15,680
He said many of these were low-hanging fruits.

473
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:20,420
He told the different BSD projects, and they all responded pretty well.

474
00:30:20,420 --> 00:30:24,360
But his core argument was, well, look at all these that I just happened to find when I

475
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:26,300
just casually looked.

476
00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:30,860
The BSDs responded with, none of these bugs really matter with the exception of a couple

477
00:30:30,860 --> 00:30:31,860
of them.

478
00:30:31,860 --> 00:30:36,180
They don't really have any actual way to exploit them, and we don't even consider these to

479
00:30:36,180 --> 00:30:38,100
be security issues.

480
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:41,780
So I remember back in the day, you and Alan would talk quite a lot about Netflix's infrastructure

481
00:30:41,780 --> 00:30:47,220
and the boxes that they put in ISP data centers and stuff.

482
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:52,260
Do you have a feeling for why Netflix went for BSD rather than Linux?

483
00:30:52,260 --> 00:30:57,520
Free BSD is famous for a smokin' fast network stack, and that wouldn't surprise me if that

484
00:30:57,520 --> 00:30:59,140
appealed to them particularly.

485
00:30:59,140 --> 00:31:03,460
But the thing is, there is also a ton of Linux at Netflix.

486
00:31:03,460 --> 00:31:09,260
And if you look at a lot of Netflix's open source projects, the majority of the code

487
00:31:09,260 --> 00:31:13,100
that they release is code that's meant to run on Linux.

488
00:31:13,100 --> 00:31:17,420
So I think there is a fair amount of free BSD in the storage infrastructure level, and

489
00:31:17,420 --> 00:31:22,220
in these boxes that they put out at the ISPs, which have cached versions of the most popular

490
00:31:22,220 --> 00:31:25,000
Netflix movies, those run BSD.

491
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:29,700
But the backend stuff, the web servers, the databases, the algorithms that figure out

492
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:31,860
what you like, that's Linux.

493
00:31:31,860 --> 00:31:37,100
I didn't know that, I thought that they were mostly free BSD.

494
00:31:37,100 --> 00:31:40,980
But it seems that you hear less and less of that these days, don't you?

495
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:42,860
Big companies using it.

496
00:31:42,860 --> 00:31:50,740
And Linux is just so popular now, and used in everything from smartphones to supercomputers,

497
00:31:50,740 --> 00:31:51,740
as we always say.

498
00:31:51,740 --> 00:31:57,700
It just feels that there's not really that relevance anymore, apart from ZFS, which you

499
00:31:57,700 --> 00:32:03,020
can get on Ubuntu, and you can make work on Linux.

500
00:32:03,020 --> 00:32:07,420
And most of the software that's running on Linux is permissively licensed anyway, and

501
00:32:07,420 --> 00:32:11,580
the kernel's GPLv2, which is not that restrictive.

502
00:32:11,580 --> 00:32:14,300
So I personally can't see any real argument.

503
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:19,940
I know there'll be BSD people who have got a ton of arguments for it, but I don't know

504
00:32:19,940 --> 00:32:25,820
about dying, but becoming less and less relevant maybe is the best way to put it with BSD.

505
00:32:25,820 --> 00:32:26,820
I'm not so sure.

506
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:33,220
I seem to recall articles about Linux dying off back in the day, and one of the aspects

507
00:32:33,220 --> 00:32:38,700
of the BSD license is you don't really ever have to say or contribute anything.

508
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:42,220
And so you can take and run that code, and you could run it for years.

509
00:32:42,220 --> 00:32:44,620
Like look at the Yahoo infrastructure, for example.

510
00:32:44,620 --> 00:32:48,340
They contribute open source code, but they don't really have to make a big deal out of

511
00:32:48,340 --> 00:32:49,340
it.

512
00:32:49,340 --> 00:32:55,020
Contrast that when, say, Google releases Android source code back upstream to the Linux kernel.

513
00:32:55,020 --> 00:32:56,080
That's a big deal.

514
00:32:56,080 --> 00:33:00,780
They're required to do it by the user license, and the entire process is out in the open,

515
00:33:00,780 --> 00:33:03,220
so it's there for everyone to see.

516
00:33:03,220 --> 00:33:05,180
So I think that also plays a factor here.

517
00:33:05,180 --> 00:33:10,180
The GPL sort of forces all of this out in the open, which means companies using Linux

518
00:33:10,180 --> 00:33:12,640
by that very nature get more exposure.

519
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:16,220
And you're going to definitely hear from some folks that say the license matters, and that

520
00:33:16,220 --> 00:33:21,460
BSD license or those MIT license, my co-host on Coda Radio, he prefers to release under

521
00:33:21,460 --> 00:33:25,460
the MIT license, and we've talked about it a lot on the show.

522
00:33:25,460 --> 00:33:28,740
He prefers to not release under the GPL, and he has a lot of reasons for that.

523
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:32,700
Well, it seems that he's not alone, because increasingly that's what people seem to be

524
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:33,700
going for.

525
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:36,140
It's, I think, the most popular license on GitHub, isn't it, MIT?

526
00:33:36,140 --> 00:33:37,860
Yeah, I do believe I read that.
