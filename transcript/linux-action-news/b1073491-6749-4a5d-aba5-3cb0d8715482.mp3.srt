00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,840
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, episode 140, recorded on January 12th, 2020.

2
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:09,840
I'm Chris.

3
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:10,840
And I'm Joe.

4
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:11,840
Hello, Joe.

5
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:13,400
Good to be connected with you.

6
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:16,560
And we start things out with a pretty high-profile exit.

7
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:20,880
Yeah, Bruce Perens has quit the OSI, the open source initiative.

8
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:23,960
He was one of the original founders of that.

9
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:26,520
And he's not happy with how things have been going there.

10
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:31,020
It seems like the crux of this issue stems back to a license that was drafted about a

11
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:36,160
year ago, called the Cryptographic Autonomy License, or the CAL.

12
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:40,400
And it was on the behalf of a distributed software platform called Holo.

13
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:45,600
This was submitted to the open source initiative for approval as a open source definition compliant

14
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:46,800
license.

15
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:51,700
And that's where the debate begins, and is ultimately left to the co-founder Bruce Perens

16
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:53,680
resigning and leaving the organization.

17
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:58,160
Yeah, not doing it quietly either, throwing around terms like stuffing the ballot box.

18
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:03,360
Yeah, there's a lot of history here, it seems, and different interpretations of events depending

19
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:04,360
on who you talk to.

20
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:07,800
And full credit to The Register, we'll have a link to their article.

21
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:13,560
They sourced as many individuals in the story as they could to try to get the broadest picture

22
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:14,780
possible.

23
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:19,100
It seems like from Bruce's standpoint, he felt the organization was heading towards

24
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:26,240
accepting a license that didn't respect freedom fully, and maybe even more importantly, contributed

25
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:32,600
to like an abundance of free software licenses, an overabundance of free software licenses

26
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:35,560
that could be leading to confusion for developers.

27
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:39,200
Yeah, he sees it as proliferation of software licenses.

28
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:45,720
And he told The Register that he believes only three licenses are necessary, the AGPLv3,

29
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:52,200
and Apache v2, which would certainly simplify things, I think, a little bit too much.

30
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:53,800
But I do get where he's coming from.

31
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:56,400
There are way too many software licenses.

32
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:57,840
Yeah, I kind of agree.

33
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:01,280
I mean, those maybe are not enough, the ones he's outlined.

34
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:06,640
But his point is that it's harmful to the community to have too many because it creates

35
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:11,900
a legal burden for developers where they have to consult a lawyer to ship software.

36
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:13,520
That might sound extreme.

37
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:19,920
However, that was a ongoing point of conversation in the Coder Radio podcast about that very

38
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:20,920
issue.

39
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:24,860
And it really is something developers have to struggle with, especially if it contributes

40
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:26,240
to their bottom line.

41
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:31,000
He's also quoted by The Register saying, most people who develop open source don't have

42
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,480
access to lawyers.

43
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:40,200
One of the goals for open source was you could use it without having to hire a lawyer.

44
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:44,960
You could put open source software on your computer and run it.

45
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:50,480
And if you don't redistribute or modify it, you don't really have to read the license.

46
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:56,180
His main contention here around this cryptographic license, this new one that led to this resignation,

47
00:02:56,180 --> 00:03:00,440
is that that license has language around how user data is handled.

48
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:05,800
And it specifically puts a burden on the user of the licensed software to make certain kinds

49
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:09,680
of data available to users on demand.

50
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:12,920
It's sort of a GDPR inspired type license.

51
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:15,180
And there's a pretty solid argument for that.

52
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:21,320
But Bruce's core point is you can't expect a single developer or a couple of developers

53
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:26,940
that are working on a project to be able to necessarily always abide by this certain provision.

54
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:28,480
It restricts freedom.

55
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:30,160
But the software landscape is changing.

56
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:34,160
And what we're talking about with the Cal license is a different type of software that

57
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:36,720
is distributed, that is peer to peer.

58
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:40,040
And arguably, you do need a new license for that.

59
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:41,520
Yeah, that's the thing.

60
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:44,960
I completely agree that there's too many licenses.

61
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:52,340
At the same time, it kind of seems like there is a need for a license exactly like this.

62
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:56,480
And that's most likely the argument you could make for every single one of those licenses

63
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:57,920
that's out there.

64
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:02,360
And so then I start to think, well, is it the end of the world for the developer to

65
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:07,160
have to do a little research before they try to make their income on an application?

66
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:08,160
I don't think it is.

67
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:14,100
I think enough of the world has bended to the laziness of developers that maybe on this

68
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:18,280
one thing, they could be asked to spend a day or two googling.

69
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:23,600
But imagine if we only had the three licenses that he talks about, we'd have no issues with

70
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,600
ZFS.

71
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:27,080
It would have already been on all the test shows.

72
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:29,360
Man, that's a utopia, isn't it?

73
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:33,880
When you think about it, and you could just keep it all in your head, all of the differences

74
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:36,880
and the requirements, you could just keep it all in your head.

75
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,760
It really would be nice.

76
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:44,920
Doesn't seem practical, especially with things like blockchain and peer-to-peer software.

77
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:50,360
It does seem like things change and you need software licenses to adapt to the new realities.

78
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:55,000
But it would be nice to consolidate some of the existing licenses and maybe trim some

79
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
of that fat.

80
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,840
But then you've got a lot of software out there that's already licensed with them.

81
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:01,000
So it's not an easy thing to do.

82
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Yeah, fair point.

83
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,600
Well, let's transition to something that's apparently almost impossible to do, and that's

84
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:10,920
to go pure system D for Debian, because we have results on their init system diversity

85
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:11,920
vote.

86
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:19,000
Yeah, after quite a complex and seemingly fair voting process, they went for proposal

87
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:24,300
B, which is system D, but we support exploring alternatives.

88
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:29,040
So pretty much where they were before this whole vote thing.

89
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:30,040
No one wins.

90
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:31,600
Well, I don't know.

91
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:36,520
Here's the language of proposal B that I think matters, quote, the Debian project recognizes

92
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:41,340
that system D service units are preferred configuration for describing how to start

93
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:42,680
a service.

94
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:47,000
However, Debian remains an environment where developers can use and explore and develop

95
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:51,360
alternate init systems and alternatives to system D features.

96
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,480
Now here's the key line.

97
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:59,000
Those interested in exploring such alternatives need to provide the necessary development

98
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,420
and packaging resources to do that work.

99
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:08,080
Later on, they write packages should include service units or init scripts to start daemons

100
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:09,880
and services.

101
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:15,560
Packages may use system D's facilities at a package maintainer's discretion, provided

102
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:18,520
it's consistent with other policy requirements.

103
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:22,120
This sounds like they're codifying the way things kind of have been.

104
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:29,000
With the exception, the kind of give I see here is as a project, we will make space for

105
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:34,320
alternatives if people show up to do the work, we have now made a policy to make space for

106
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:35,320
you.

107
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:36,320
Is that how you read it?

108
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:37,600
Yeah, I think so.

109
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:43,900
And it seems like quite a kind of roundabout way of not ultimately supporting much more

110
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:49,560
than system D. You're putting in the policy to say, if you want to do it, have at it,

111
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:52,760
but realistically, is anyone going to do that?

112
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:53,760
Probably not.

113
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:58,920
So it's kind of a win for system D only, which, how I read the original proposals from Sam

114
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:03,120
Hartman, the Debian project lead, it feels like that's the direction that he wanted to

115
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:10,640
go with it, to just double down on system D and just finally end that debate.

116
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:15,640
Whereas this is keeping the door open, but I think you're not going to have that many

117
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:20,200
people who really step up and provide those development resources.

118
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:26,000
Yeah, this does kind of seem like not enough for either side.

119
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,240
But imagine for a moment, if we could just snap our fingers and say all of the folks

120
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:34,800
from the dev one community come back over to Debian and just put all of your efforts

121
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:37,560
in maintaining the alternative packages.

122
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:42,320
Now Debian has codified room for them, like that they would make space for them.

123
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:46,500
Obviously this is sort of saying, show up and do the work and we'll make space, otherwise

124
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:50,800
we're going to continue on for system D.

125
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:58,440
But not firmly, like as somebody like myself, what I see here is perhaps a vulnerability

126
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:03,800
in the design of an open source community, where they can't just take decisive action,

127
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:07,720
whatever it might be, and then strike forward and build an innovative product on top of

128
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:08,720
that.

129
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:13,720
However, the bigger picture version of the Linux landscape tells me that this is precisely

130
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:21,560
what Debian is for and derivatives, especially popular ones like Ubuntu can take decisive

131
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:27,400
action with upstart or system D. And that's really where they can add a lot of value.

132
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:32,480
And it's sort of perfect if you look at the overall landscape of Linux, that some distribution

133
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:37,840
is thinking very deeply about this question because it is supremely important.

134
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:42,800
It is probably one of the most important components of a Linux system right now.

135
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:47,880
And so thinking about this matters and I don't really know where else you can allow space

136
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:50,080
for it other than in Debian.

137
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:56,240
I mean, there's projects like Gentoo and others that add tremendous value, but Debian's at

138
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:59,880
a scale where it really actually kind of matters too.

139
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:01,040
That's what I think is terrific here.

140
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:04,440
Well, it's interesting that you talk about Debian and Ubuntu.

141
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:09,720
Ubuntu has been around for 27 years, let's say 30, round it up.

142
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:13,340
What's more likely to still be around in 30 years, Debian or Ubuntu?

143
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:15,300
I'd say both.

144
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:21,760
At this point, there will still be Ubuntu systems in production in 30 years.

145
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:25,600
They may be running old releases, but they'll absolutely still be running because that's

146
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:28,800
just the way those kinds of things work.

147
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:34,480
I wonder, boy Joe, if we could go on the record now and then check in on a 30-year production,

148
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:36,480
that would really be something.

149
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:41,800
No, I think they probably will both still be around, but just serving different needs

150
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:42,800
really.

151
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:49,680
And I think Debian, although it does have something of a flaw in that there's no dictator,

152
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:55,120
that's also what's good about it and why it will ultimately probably keep going indefinitely.

153
00:09:55,120 --> 00:10:00,320
Yeah, I think you'll have Debian, you'll have Red Hat, and they'll all be dynamic environments

154
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:03,040
you can spin up on your Fuchsia system in seconds.

155
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:04,600
Probably, yeah.

156
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:10,480
They'll end up being a Fuchsia version of Debian, like with the herd.

157
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,080
It's just one of the user land environments.

158
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:13,280
Oh, you want one of those apps?

159
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:14,600
Yeah, sure, no problem.

160
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:15,600
Fuchsia supports that.

161
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:20,240
Well, before we get to that Fuchsia future, we've still got Android.

162
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:24,920
And something we reported on last year was the search engine ballot, where if you buy

163
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:29,480
an Android phone in Europe, the first time you turn it on, it's going to give you a selection

164
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:32,520
screen of which search provider you want to use.

165
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:35,380
And now we know what those search providers are going to be.

166
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:37,120
This is so Google.

167
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,120
It's so beautiful.

168
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:43,040
Google is profiting at the expense of competition because they've managed to turn this thing

169
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,500
into an auction.

170
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:49,640
So the search engines that are shown to users will vary for each EU country with the selection

171
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:55,160
screen described as a fourth price auction system.

172
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:59,520
Each provider tells Google how much it's willing to pay the company every time a user selects

173
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:01,520
their product as the default.

174
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:04,520
So when you select DuckDuckGo, they pay out a little bit.

175
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:09,120
The three highest bidders are then shown to users with the chosen provider paying Google

176
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:12,360
the amount offered by the fourth highest bid.

177
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:15,880
The process is then repeated every four months.

178
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:21,400
Well, apparently Microsoft didn't really feel like playing game in a lot of these different

179
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:22,660
EU countries.

180
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:25,160
And so they're at the bottom of the list.

181
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:28,240
I think they're only in one market.

182
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:30,200
And it's a bunch of search engines I've never heard of.

183
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:31,760
The whole thing seems kind of a mess.

184
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:37,760
Yeah, this is very much Google obeying the letter of the EU law and not the spirit of

185
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:40,640
it, as you say, profiting from it.

186
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:43,040
And DuckDuckGo are not very happy about it.

187
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:47,120
Even though they're having to pay, they're still doing it begrudgingly.

188
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:52,840
And it really is cheeky of Google to have done this, I think, but they obviously think

189
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:53,840
they can get away with it.

190
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:54,840
Yeah, well, they are.

191
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:55,840
They are.

192
00:11:55,840 --> 00:12:00,760
It's so Google, if this is if you followed Google as a company, and if you've read Into

193
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:07,520
the Plex, this is so in Google's wheelhouse, this whole auction system, and they can then

194
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:11,680
claim it's fair market prices and not Google setting the price.

195
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:14,320
It's how they also run AdWords.

196
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:17,760
That's all auction based as well and YouTube ads, all that's auction based.

197
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:21,560
Yeah, it's almost like they're treating this selection as an advert, which it kind of is

198
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:22,560
really.

199
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:23,560
Well, it is.

200
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:28,560
It's their software platform that's in front of users that is placing other companies that

201
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:30,160
compete with them.

202
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:33,720
Now, they were supposed to do it because they're a monopoly and they've figured out a way to

203
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:35,240
make money from it.

204
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:40,120
But it is probably some of the most valuable real estate you could buy as one of these

205
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:43,240
companies because it sets everything to that as the default.

206
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:47,840
Well, arguably, one of the other prime bits of real estate on an Android phone are the

207
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:49,720
pre-installed apps.

208
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:55,760
And if you get a cheap government subsidized phone in the US, then you might be getting

209
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:58,240
some nasty ones pre-installed.

210
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,680
This is shameful.

211
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:01,840
This is a story I would expect out of China.

212
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:04,920
And in fact, some of the software has ties to China.

213
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:09,000
But these are phones that have been subsidized by the US government.

214
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:13,560
Some of them are called Obama phones as a bit of a joke because they were launched in

215
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:14,560
2008.

216
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:17,560
Well, it was expanded in 2008, really.

217
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:26,940
And it's a low end UMX U686CL phone provided by the Virgin Mobile Assurance Wireless program.

218
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:30,720
The upside is you get an Android phone for $35.

219
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:38,400
The downside is it's loaded with not one, but two different kinds of horrible software,

220
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:42,920
including a fake auto update system that installs ads.

221
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:44,080
It's shameful.

222
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:49,120
And it's fundamentally one of the core issues I have with the Android platform.

223
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,200
Is it scale?

224
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:52,320
It's used to abuse users.

225
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,760
And Malwarebytes are calling it malware.

226
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:57,120
Well, they would, wouldn't they?

227
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:04,140
I am hesitant to say that myself because Virgin have come out and said specifically that they

228
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:06,180
don't consider it to be malware.

229
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:10,400
So I think it's left up to the reader and listener to decide.

230
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:14,560
But either way, it's apps that most people are not going to want on their phones.

231
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:18,280
I mean, of course, they're going to say that the moment you log into the mobile device,

232
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:24,000
the quote unquote wireless update app starts auto installing crap.

233
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,360
And it's stuff that doesn't take any user consent.

234
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:29,360
There's no agree to do any of this.

235
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:31,400
There's no OK.

236
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:37,500
And once it's loaded, it's an app variant of ad ups, which is from a Chinese based company

237
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:43,320
that just loads your Android device up with ads on the home screen, in the notifications

238
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:45,600
app, it overrides apps and websites.

239
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,520
It's extremely aggressive.

240
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:50,280
And a lot of it does location tracking, too.

241
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:53,120
And it just starts installing the moment you install it.

242
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:58,380
And there are so many other instances of these low cost Android phones from a variety of

243
00:14:58,380 --> 00:15:01,600
different providers and manufacturer that do this.

244
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:06,320
Blue, BLU, is one of the most infamous, where they installed a powerful backdoor and a root

245
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:12,480
kit and downloaders on 26 different phone models from various manufacturers that white

246
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:16,760
labeled their devices that were sold by mainstream carriers.

247
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:21,180
Android at the low end is user hostile.

248
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:27,160
And it's so upsetting to see Linux used this way to abuse the users.

249
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:30,040
It doesn't empower the users, it abuses them.

250
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:35,960
And honestly, people would be better buying used iPhones off of eBay than they would be

251
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:38,360
getting these $35 Android devices.

252
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:45,360
And that's so awful to have to say on a Linux podcast that Apple with their iOS devices

253
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:51,440
that you could buy used on eBay is a safer route to go if you're a consumer looking for

254
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:58,040
a cheap device than a phone you could go into a Virgin store or Verizon and buy directly.

255
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:59,040
It's mind boggling.

256
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:03,640
Yeah, arguably, you could say go down the lineage route, but for most consumers, that's

257
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:04,640
just not an option.

258
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:06,760
They don't have the technical skills to do that.

259
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:09,340
It's not even in the realm of possibility for them.

260
00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:15,160
Not only are they barely even aware of a concept of an operating system, but the idea to reload

261
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:20,240
it is so far above and beyond their capabilities in terms of research or connecting to the

262
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:24,920
computer or even conceptualizing the idea of an operating system in an image file.

263
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:26,480
It's so far beyond them.

264
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:27,960
It's not even a possibility.

265
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:30,840
And that's why I say for them, it's got to be iOS.

266
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:34,680
Now for savvy users, people that listen to this podcast that could go buy a used Android

267
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:37,240
device and reload it with Linux, yeah, sure, go for it.

268
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:38,740
But lineage on there, have at it.

269
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:39,740
It's going to be great.

270
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:43,840
But you can't expect people that are buying these subsidized devices to know how to do

271
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:44,840
that.

272
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:49,120
I mean, they're struggling with just basic malware on their phones now.

273
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:53,520
It really, it just has for years, Joe, it's just really upset me to see Linux abused like

274
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:54,520
this through Android.

275
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:58,720
Like it's, it's great that Linux is in so many pockets.

276
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:03,700
And it's great that it's brought so many OEMs into contributing to the Linux kernel.

277
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:06,200
But there has been a human cost.

278
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:07,880
And it's this kind of stuff.

279
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:09,920
And it's even worse in other countries.

280
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:14,520
Yeah, and Google could put a stop to this, at least with devices that they're certifying

281
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:18,620
and allowing to have the Google Play stuff on there, they could put some rules in to

282
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:19,620
stop it.

283
00:17:19,620 --> 00:17:24,080
And they could enforce those rules and make sure that OEMs do not get away with this.

284
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:28,240
It's such a shame because by the time mobile devices came around, we knew how to do things

285
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:29,240
better.

286
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:34,680
We had lived through the era of horrible Windows OEMs loading PCs up with crap.

287
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:38,720
And we had recognized what a flaw that was, especially groups like Google who are trying

288
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:41,000
to do things differently.

289
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,360
And here we are.

290
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:46,520
And it's just Windows and Mac OS all over again, only in the mobile space.

291
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:50,440
Well, don't worry, machine learning and deep learning is going to save us from all this.

292
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:52,680
And Amazon has got just the thing for that.

293
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:55,940
You know it's legit, Joe, because it's got a dot science TLD.

294
00:17:55,940 --> 00:17:57,280
It's Amazon dot science.

295
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:59,780
So this is for real here.

296
00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:01,400
It's called AutoGluon.

297
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:03,500
And it's named after what, Joe?

298
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:04,500
You looked this up.

299
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:05,500
I didn't look it up.

300
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:07,440
I knew that a gluon was a subatomic particle.

301
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:08,440
Nerd.

302
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:09,440
Yeah, no, OK.

303
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:10,820
And so that's where it gets its name from.

304
00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:16,100
And so they've open sourced this AutoML library that automates deep learning and machine learning

305
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:21,540
for real world applications involving image and text and certain types of data sets.

306
00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:23,280
So what does that mean in practical sense?

307
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:27,120
Well, in practical sense, if you're on a Linux system and you've got Python, you can pull

308
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:31,580
this down now and you can start throwing it at images and it will start recognizing the

309
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:35,620
crap in those images, like people, motorbikes, tree.

310
00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:37,780
So that's one of the many things it can do.

311
00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:42,400
But what it's doing on the back end is what Amazon says is the real magic.

312
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:47,140
The part where they're saying they're democratizing machine learning is because they've built

313
00:18:47,140 --> 00:18:53,780
a system that figures out a lot of the hard stuff, a lot of the tweaking where you try

314
00:18:53,780 --> 00:18:58,720
something, it doesn't work, you retry it, you tweak it a little bit, modify this, run

315
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:02,320
it again, it doesn't work, and you iterate on that 100 times.

316
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:03,960
They call this hyperparameters.

317
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:08,440
And they say it represents a considerable number of choices the developers must make

318
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:10,540
when they're constructing a neural network.

319
00:19:10,540 --> 00:19:13,740
Joe and I have this problem all the time when we're building our neural networks to do podcasting

320
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:14,740
for us.

321
00:19:14,740 --> 00:19:18,180
It involves all kinds of selections, like the number of layers in the neural network,

322
00:19:18,180 --> 00:19:22,460
how these layers should be connected, like the architecture of that network even, and

323
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:28,180
then how to train each individual network, what data sets to use, all of that is automated

324
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:33,240
by this library, this Python library that you pull down on your Linux box.

325
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:38,020
And it looks at what you're trying to do and it runs through these scenarios and solves

326
00:19:38,020 --> 00:19:43,140
a lot of these problems for you, tries different things very fast, and gets it all set up.

327
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:47,580
Essentially now, what their pitch is, and of course, the proof will be in the results,

328
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:52,540
but their pitch is the developers don't have to manually experiment with hundreds of individual

329
00:19:52,540 --> 00:19:57,300
choices that must be made when you're designing a deep learning model.

330
00:19:57,300 --> 00:20:02,020
They'll just simply click, specify when they'd like to have their trained model ready, and

331
00:20:02,020 --> 00:20:03,020
it runs.

332
00:20:03,020 --> 00:20:08,020
And this is open source, it's Apache licensed, so you can run it on your own machine.

333
00:20:08,020 --> 00:20:12,140
But I wonder why Amazon might be giving this to the community?

334
00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:16,580
Maybe to run these instances on AWS and make a lot of money?

335
00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:20,140
Machine learning as a service, Joe.

336
00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:22,780
It does seem like anyone can benefit from this, though.

337
00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:26,260
It really simplifies it down to just a few lines of code.

338
00:20:26,260 --> 00:20:31,180
And it feels like even I could maybe get started with this.

339
00:20:31,180 --> 00:20:36,580
I had that same thought when I looked at it, I was like, oh, I could actually throw this

340
00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:41,180
at some of my Shinobi surveillance footage and actually just have it start auto-tagging

341
00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:42,180
stuff in there.

342
00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:45,580
I was like, wow, this is super approachable.

343
00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:49,380
And one of the things I like about it is right now, it only works on Linux.

344
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:53,060
They're going to support other operating systems, like that's totally on the roadmap.

345
00:20:53,060 --> 00:20:56,460
But this is like cutting edge stuff.

346
00:20:56,460 --> 00:20:59,660
And it's so cool that Linux is the only supported OS right now.

347
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:05,660
It just really is a reaffirmation of the state of Linux in this area of computing.

348
00:21:05,660 --> 00:21:06,660
Yeah.

349
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:07,660
Linux first.

350
00:21:07,660 --> 00:21:08,660
Yeah.

351
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:09,660
It's great.

352
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:11,500
I mean, they'll get it for the other platforms.

353
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:16,060
But it's just, it's so, I don't know, it feels so great to be on this side of it for once.

354
00:21:16,060 --> 00:21:19,540
And it's been like this for a little while with this kind of stuff.

355
00:21:19,540 --> 00:21:23,260
And if anyone out in the audience gets a chance to play around with this and has some fun,

356
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:24,260
do let us know.

357
00:21:24,260 --> 00:21:27,860
So go to linuxactionnews.com contact and tell us how you're using it.

358
00:21:27,860 --> 00:21:32,260
I have actually now looked it up and I know a little bit more about what a gluon is.

359
00:21:32,260 --> 00:21:36,980
It's an elementary particle that acts as the exchange particle or gauge boson for the strong

360
00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:38,340
force between quarks.

361
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:39,340
Right.

362
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:40,340
The gauge boson.

363
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:45,020
And don't forget, you can go to linuxactionnews.com slash subscribe for all the ways to get new

364
00:21:45,020 --> 00:21:46,020

Think of it as a sunsetter for your evening.

367
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:56,340
In three minutes or less, everything happened in Linux and open source that day.

368
00:21:56,340 --> 00:22:00,100
We'll be back next Monday with our weekly take on the latest Linux and open source news.

369
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:02,100
I am at Chris LAS.

370
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:03,780
I'm at Joe Rissington.

371
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:04,780
Thanks for joining us.

372
00:22:04,780 --> 00:22:05,780
We'll see you next week.

373
00:22:05,780 --> 00:22:28,380
See you later.
