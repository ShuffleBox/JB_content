00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,040
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News.

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:09,000
Episode 119 recorded on August 17th, 2019.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
I'm Chris.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
And I'm Joe.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Hello, Joe.

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,680
Good to be connected with you extra early this week.

7
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:18,380
This is like the last time for a little while that we'll be doing this early, but you got

8
00:00:18,380 --> 00:00:20,920
a chance to come out to the Seattle area, so we had to take advantage of it.

9
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:24,920
Yeah, and that's meant that we've both had a chance to have a hands-on with XFCE 4.14

10
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:25,920
together.

11
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:30,240
Big news this week, XFCE 4.14 is released.

12
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:31,760
Now here's the timeline for you.

13
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:39,760
Just so we have perspective, 4.10 was released in 2012, 4.12 was released in 2015, and now

14
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:43,640
we have 4.14 in 2019.

15
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:50,480
Four years and five months of work, and I think the big takeaway is all the core components

16
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:51,980
are now GTK 3.

17
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:53,720
Just in time for GTK 4, eh?

18
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:54,720
Hey, man.

19
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:58,680
I'm still using some crazy applications that use GTK 2, so I don't know.

20
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:00,400
I just don't know anymore.

21
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:04,760
But I mean, with GTK 3, you're getting high DPI support in there.

22
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:10,040
Yeah, and we tried that out on XPS 13 with a 4K screen, and it's almost there, isn't

23
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:11,040
it?

24
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:12,800
It's not quite 100% though.

25
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:16,200
The way they've really implemented high DPI support is in the appearance settings, there's

26
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:20,400
now a GTK scale factor by two.

27
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:25,500
And that does make everything that's GTK double in size, but that doesn't increase things

28
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:31,360
like your mouse cursor, it doesn't switch over your theme to a high DPI icon theme,

29
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:36,760
it doesn't necessarily make the close, minimize, and maximize buttons in the title bar larger,

30
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:38,520
doesn't even necessarily make the menu bar larger.

31
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:42,880
There's still tweaks you have to make, but if XFCE has been your desktop of choice and

32
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:47,240
you've just recently moved to a high DPI system, it can do it now.

33
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:48,240
It's not perfect.

34
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:53,840
Honestly, it feels about as much fiddling as Plasma feels like it takes.

35
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:58,240
Other desktops are smoother, elementary nails it, but it's doable.

36
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:01,360
I actually checked out 4.14 on two different distros.

37
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:07,720
One was Endeavor OS, which is essentially Arch, and then the other is the Xubuntu 1910

38
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:11,040
daily image, and both seemed fairly similar to me.

39
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:13,320
The Xubuntu daily is what I tried out too.

40
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:16,920
I'll put a link to that in the show notes if you want to try it out.

41
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:19,680
It's not an impressive theme out of the box, right?

42
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:22,400
I mean, that's one of the things the project doesn't really bother with.

43
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,760
They let you set that.

44
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,320
But there is enough fundamentals here.

45
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:28,200
The new display dialogue has received a lot of attention.

46
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:31,960
It has profiles now for multi-monitor configuration.

47
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:37,200
There is sweet little just tweaks to different aspects of the settings screens.

48
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,920
The file manager has received a lot of bug fixes.

49
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:41,600
Overall, very rounded update.

50
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:47,520
My favorite feature I have to call out is in the official notifications service now,

51
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:50,480
they've gained support for what they call persistence.

52
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:54,800
In other words, notification logging and do not disturb mode, which I had to hack around

53
00:02:54,800 --> 00:03:00,560
to do not disturb mode on XFCE in the past, because that's the number one thing in 2019.

54
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:04,380
If you don't need high DPI and you sit down at an XFCE desktop, the notifications are

55
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:07,520
just a nightmare if you get a lot of them.

56
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:12,380
So having this is like the feature, the feature that I wanted in XFCE.

57
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:13,600
This is my feature right here.

58
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:14,600
I'm very happy to see it.

59
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:15,600
Nice.

60
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:18,640
But before you go dissing the theme too much, maybe I should turn my laptop around and show

61
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:25,640
you that I use pretty much the same theme on 1804.

62
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:28,080
I guess it works for some people, right?

63
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:32,320
I think when you look at the screenshots of XFCE with that theme, which is what's all

64
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:37,440
over the project's website and Zubunda's website, I think it's a big turnoff for a lot of people.

65
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:41,600
Because you can throw ArcDark on there and it looks like, it pretty much looks like a

66
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:43,080
gnome shell desktop.

67
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:46,680
Yeah, but I'm just happy enough with the default.

68
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:47,680
It's fine.

69
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:48,680
It's easy enough to change too, right?

70
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:52,640
So yeah, you probably, I don't know if you noticed, this is just like a really small

71
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:56,720
feature they snuck in there in Parole, which is their media player on XFCE.

72
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:57,920
It's based on top of Gstreamer.

73
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:02,520
They've added more support for network streams, but more importantly for you and I, podcast

74
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:03,520
support.

75
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:04,520
Yes, very nice.

76
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:08,720
One of the big features though is the multi-monitor support now.

77
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:15,160
In the display settings, they've got an extra tab where you can save profiles for different

78
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:19,420
combinations of screens, which is something that I think you're potentially going to take

79
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:21,760
advantage of.

80
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:25,820
Did not get a chance to try that because the XPS I have doesn't have a display connector

81
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:27,460
that works with my monitors.

82
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:31,320
But when I do get this loaded on my main desktop, totally taking advantage of that.

83
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:36,720
And I could see this too on the ThinkPad, I travel between the studio and home a lot

84
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:41,000
and I have a small screen at the RV and I have a couple of different screen options

85
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
here.

86
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
So I will have a chance to play with it.

87
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:48,360
And I hope, I hope, I hope this solves my multi-monitor issues I've had.

88
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:49,880
I've got some bad news, I'm afraid.

89
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:56,920
The bit of testing that I did with a laptop that's 720p and a 1080p external monitor over

90
00:04:56,920 --> 00:05:03,040
HDMI, it worked fine, but then I rebooted and just there was nothing on the screen.

91
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:04,040
Oh man.

92
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,040
Yeah.

93
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:06,040
Okay.

94
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,040
That's about what I get now.

95
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,040
So.

96
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:09,040
Yeah.

97
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:10,040
That's fine.

98
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:11,040
All right.

99
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:12,040
A bit of work there needed, I think.

100
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:13,040
Good release overall.

101
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:18,920
I think probably you and I might be the most excited people listening to the show, though.

102
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:24,360
It's just, you know, XFCE isn't the desktop that everybody thinks of as the big splashy

103
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:25,360
desktop.

104
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:30,080
I sure have learned to appreciate it's just get work done attitude and the slow pace of

105
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:35,320
change, but still implementing things like GTK3 over time actually kind of works for

106
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:36,320
my current usage.

107
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:37,320
Well, yeah.

108
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:43,920
I'm probably going to end up using this in Xubuntu 20.04 and by then it should hopefully

109
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:46,180
have matured significantly.

110
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:50,800
And these bugs that I've been talking about would have been ironed out and yet it will

111
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:51,960
be modern enough.

112
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:57,940
Okay, we'll probably be looking at some GTK4 applications and stuff by then, but realistically

113
00:05:57,940 --> 00:06:03,480
most of the stuff that I use that will be in 20.04 will just look absolutely fine.

114
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:07,600
And so it's slow pace, but that's what's good about it.

115
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,200
That's why I like it.

116
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:11,020
They're not made any massive changes.

117
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:16,960
It just looks like XFCE still and I'm going to be happily using it for many years to come,

118
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:17,960
I think.

119
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:18,960
Yeah.

120
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:22,760
I'm looking forward to Xubuntu 20.04 and I'm like, I want to upgrade right now.

121
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:27,240
I want to do not disturb stuff right now, but that is sort of silly with XFCE.

122
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:29,160
It's slow incremental updates.

123
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,160
Why rush?

124
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:32,160
Wait for it to get refined.

125
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:35,720
Kubernetes might be seeing a little bit of refinement after a recent security audit though.

126
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:36,720
Yeah.

127
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:40,460
The Cloud Native Computing Foundation, which is part of the Linux Foundation, put together

128
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:46,100
a security audit working group and they selected a couple of companies to do the actual audit

129
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:50,480
of Kubernetes and they've done it all completely out in the open from the very start of the

130
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:54,200
process to now the end where we've got the results of the audit.

131
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:55,200
Yeah.

132
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:59,840
The process took them, looks like about four months and the two different companies is

133
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:01,160
an interesting way to do this.

134
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:03,440
So hence the security audit working group.

135
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:08,600
They manage these two different contractors that went through a whole process of selection.

136
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:11,540
And isn't this just kind of the thing you love seeing some Linux Foundation money be

137
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:12,540
spent on?

138
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:17,080
And they even produced a few CVEs and security bugs from this thing.

139
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:22,960
And really for the most part, it was a lot of best practices or inconsistent practices

140
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:27,480
throughout the large project that weren't really being properly followed.

141
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:32,940
But it is very important for a project of this size to have been audited because there's

142
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:37,520
a lot of code out there, a lot of projects that have never been subject to an audit.

143
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:43,300
And we just don't know necessarily whether there are some seriously bad practices going

144
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:48,660
on there and some potentially unknown zero days in there.

145
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:49,660
So you're right.

146
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:52,780
This is exactly what the Linux Foundation should be spending money on.

147
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:57,920
What we got as a result is four different papers, a Kubernetes security review paper,

148
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:01,980
attacking and defending Kubernetes installations, a white paper that covers it all and different

149
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:03,800
threat models that we're looking at.

150
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:08,420
There was also a good batch of ancillary data that was created by these two companies that's

151
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:10,000
also being published.

152
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,260
If you are deploying Kubernetes in production, some of these can be consumed pretty quickly

153
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:19,640
and give you a good overview of best practices that should be implemented in your own Kubernetes

154
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:20,640
setup as well.

155
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:24,980
That was another thing the researchers found is that some end users are not properly implementing

156
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:27,160
and securing their systems.

157
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:33,220
And a lot of times it comes down to inconsistent TLS implementations and just basic stuff that

158
00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:36,740
is easy to overlook, but an aggregate creates problems.

159
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:40,060
So with Kubernetes out of the way, you have to wonder what's next for an audit.

160
00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:41,340
Yeah, yeah, you do.

161
00:08:41,340 --> 00:08:45,780
This process appears to be partially inspired by the Core Infrastructure Initiative, and

162
00:08:45,780 --> 00:08:52,320
they have a best practices badge program to get a badge when you're all secure.

163
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:56,580
And then the Linux Foundation bestows this badge upon you and it's a way for open source

164
00:08:56,580 --> 00:09:02,480
projects to show that they follow security best practices, which honestly could be respected

165
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:03,480
in the industry over time.

166
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:04,620
I could actually see this working.

167
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:07,700
It's kind of a clever idea and people will want their badge.

168
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:12,240
And the Linux Foundation argues that consumers of the badge can quickly assess which open

169
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:18,580
source projects have followed these best practices and will then be more comfortable selecting

170
00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:23,620
open source software and in theory, select projects that are of higher quality and better

171
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:27,940
audited and better secured, which means more secure software being deployed.

172
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:29,940
Well, that's true, but there is a flip side to that.

173
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:36,380
It means that you've got the open source projects that are well funded, backed by huge companies

174
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:39,980
that will get the badge and can afford to go through these audits and stuff, whereas

175
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:46,600
the smaller projects that potentially are as secure and perfectly well written won't

176
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:47,660
be able to afford that.

177
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:49,900
And so you end up with a two tier system.

178
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:50,900
True.

179
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:55,300
Although it's also an opportunity for the community to create their own process and

180
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:57,260
maybe their own badge system.

181
00:09:57,260 --> 00:10:04,060
I could actually see if this is a reoccurring thing where high profile projects are audited

182
00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:05,060
by two different groups.

183
00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:09,720
So you have people that are essentially peer reviewing each other's work and then you release

184
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:14,660
all of the findings up on GitHub like they've done, that could start a trend and maybe the

185
00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:19,020
community will come up with their own community certified badge, millions of eyes viewing

186
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:20,020
the source code kind of badge.

187
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:24,860
And you could just have a big scene eye, like an eye of Sauron.

188
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:29,260
So what you're saying is we're going to get one new standard and we should create another

189
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:30,460
one as well.

190
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:32,700
Seems like a pretty solid prediction to me.

191
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:35,840
And then we'll need a standard that covers all those standards, Joe.

192
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:38,740
You can see the process is already starting.

193
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:43,320
In all, they identified 34 vulnerabilities, four of which were high severity, 15 of which

194
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:47,660
were medium, eight low, and that seven were just informational.

195
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:48,920
That's some decent results.

196
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:53,520
And as you'd expect, the Kubernetes project is already releasing updates to address these

197
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:54,520
security issues.

198
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:58,340
Well, the Cloud Native Computing Foundation were very keen to have this all be out in

199
00:10:58,340 --> 00:10:59,580
the open.

200
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:02,920
And that's something Google is also trying to do with AMP, right?

201
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:09,660
The newer, bigger, faster AMP now with server-side rendering, which is going to change everything

202
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:17,240
and they say will increase a whopping 50% on a popular metric called the FCP metric.

203
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:18,240
Faster page loads.

204
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:21,500
And get ready for this, Joe, server-side script rendering.

205
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:25,580
That sounds like an amazing new innovation to me.

206
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:30,680
It'll be a big change, you know, something consumers have never seen before and obviously

207
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:32,580
will take AMP to the next level.

208
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:36,020
Of course, the downside of all of this means is that JavaScript is working its way into

209
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:42,820
AMP essentially, which is remarkable since AMP essentially started as a way to avoid

210
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:48,540
really heavy scripted websites and deliver you just the results.

211
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:52,740
We're essentially seeing a re-implementation of the web in AMP.

212
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:55,700
It's to me the ultimate power grab by Google.

213
00:11:55,700 --> 00:12:00,140
Well, do you remember when it used to be called accelerated mobile pages and they've just

214
00:12:00,140 --> 00:12:02,140
dropped that now and now it's just AMP?

215
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:03,140
Yeah.

216
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:07,220
AMP plus SSR now for server-side rendering.

217
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:11,780
There's been a lot of backlash to this because although it does mean that you can serve your

218
00:12:11,780 --> 00:12:17,260
pages more quickly and potentially compete with the Google cached stuff, it's just not

219
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:23,500
enough really because the feature creep that we've seen with AMP, the JavaScript, okay,

220
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:28,180
they're limiting the size of the JavaScript that you can use and they're trying to kind

221
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:33,220
of keep the whole thing as tight and efficient as possible.

222
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:39,500
But at this point, it just is a re-implementation of the web and they've already hooked in a

223
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:45,380
bunch of publishers by essentially forcing them to use AMP in order to appear in the

224
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:52,260
search results in a decent position and kind of sold the idea on one premise of it being

225
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:55,820
just a very slim HTML page.

226
00:12:55,820 --> 00:13:01,500
And now over the last few years, we've seen more and more features come in that it's just

227
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:03,300
essentially a standard website.

228
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:07,500
Yeah, it's a little bit of JavaScript now, but before there was no JavaScript.

229
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:11,360
So it could be a lot more JavaScript down the road.

230
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:16,340
And I bet the next announcement from the team over at the AMP Council now will be there.

231
00:13:16,340 --> 00:13:20,260
They're going to introduce this grand new feature called Common Gateway Interfaces and

232
00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:21,300
you're going to love it, Joe.

233
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:26,340
It's just going to be a great way to have active web server applications.

234
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:31,580
I guess I'm really kind of getting, I guess I'm getting a little sick of what seems to

235
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:37,740
be just a continual feature creep of AMP to take over the way we do web pages.

236
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:42,680
And I hoped that when they went to this new council format of advisors, we'd see something

237
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:43,820
a little more dialed down.

238
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:46,820
But what we're seeing to me seems to be a more aggressive grab.

239
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:53,380
And the worst part is, is we're still not solving the core issues of poor websites and

240
00:13:53,380 --> 00:13:55,260
poor server performance.

241
00:13:55,260 --> 00:14:00,980
And we're re-implementing things that we already have solutions for to get something that really

242
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:03,620
only seems to benefit Google.

243
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:07,580
There is some end user benefit, but there's nothing inherently unique about AMP that you

244
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:12,340
couldn't provide directly as a publisher if you just invested a little bit in the technology.

245
00:14:12,340 --> 00:14:17,700
Well, this is all interesting in relation to some stats that I saw this week from JumpShot,

246
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:23,820
which is the data arm of Avast, which shows that we've now reached over 50% of Google

247
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:28,620
searches that don't result in a click through to a website, because often they'll just be

248
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:31,560
a summary of the information that people needed.

249
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:36,520
And therefore, they don't need to go to the website and potentially see the ads on the

250
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:37,660
publisher's site.

251
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:39,820
They just see the ads that Google is serving.

252
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:41,580
Yeah, I think it's a combo of factors.

253
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:45,420
These zero-click searches, as they're being called, is in part because Google's scraping

254
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:48,780
a lot of sites, and then they offer up these knowledge cards, like you say, and then you

255
00:14:48,780 --> 00:14:50,080
just get the answer.

256
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:54,700
Or there are more and more decent Google properties.

257
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:59,020
When I search for flight info, I just tend to use Google Flights now.

258
00:14:59,020 --> 00:15:01,460
It starts right there in the search results, and I just engage with it.

259
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:05,060
And then next thing you know, I'm booking my flight through Google Flights.

260
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:09,580
And it's kind of convenient, and the prices seem to be fairly competitive.

261
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:13,760
And I think, in some regard, part of why they're seeing less click throughs is because they're

262
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:19,280
building better and better content, and also because they're displaying things in previews

263
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:20,780
and knowledge cards and whatnot.

264
00:15:20,780 --> 00:15:22,260
But I wouldn't have any illusions.

265
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:23,700
This is still good for Google.

266
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:27,140
People spending time on their website, viewing ads, still making them money.

267
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:31,460
Joe, I think we can summarize this by quoting at DZ on Twitter, Google backdoored themselves

268
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:37,180
into having an alternative HTML spec that many media companies must follow for competitive

269
00:15:37,180 --> 00:15:40,340
reasons, and to be honest, we're all still just a little upset about it.

270
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:42,020
That's really what it comes down to.

271
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:43,620
Yeah, that sounds about right.

272
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:47,020
Well, last week we talked about Linux Journal shutting down.

273
00:15:47,020 --> 00:15:51,700
And unfortunately, this week we have to talk about OSDisk.com shutting down.

274
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:58,660
When's the last time you ordered a DVD or CD-ROM disk for a Linux distro?

275
00:15:58,660 --> 00:15:59,660
One or two weeks ago.

276
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:00,660
Shut up.

277
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:01,660
Never.

278
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:02,660
Oh.

279
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:03,660
No way.

280
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:04,660
Never?

281
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:05,660
Never?

282
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:06,660
I've done it once or twice, maybe.

283
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:07,660
No.

284
00:16:07,660 --> 00:16:12,780
I mean, even back when I started, which wasn't that long ago, like 2007-ish, my internet

285
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:17,480
connection was fast enough to get the ISOs, and I had a bunch of blank CDs and just burnt

286
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:18,480
all my own.

287
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:19,480
Mm-hmm.

288
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:20,480
Yeah.

289
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:21,480
Yeah.

290
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:27,260
Really, once the speeds of home internet connections got fast enough and USB thumb drives became

291
00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:31,020
so available, it just didn't really make sense.

292
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:32,740
I actually kind of held out for a long time.

293
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:36,980
I liked having disks, because I could write the distro on there and it was frozen in time.

294
00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:38,500
I could put it on the shelf.

295
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:39,500
And it wasn't...

296
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:40,500
I just...

297
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:44,980
That feels wasteful to do with a thumb drive, but with a disk, it was like, ah, I've captured

298
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:47,100
a point in time.

299
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:53,340
Ramsey's the OSDisk founder, and the email out to customers starts so classy.

300
00:16:53,340 --> 00:16:56,740
After over 16 years, he writes, OSDisk.com has closed.

301
00:16:56,740 --> 00:17:01,380
If you've ordered from us, help is still available by emailing support at OSDisk.com.

302
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:02,380
That is so classy.

303
00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:05,540
Even though we're shutting down, we're still going to try to answer your emails for your

304
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:07,820
DVDs and CDs that you might have trouble with.

305
00:17:07,820 --> 00:17:08,820
Yeah.

306
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:11,740
Well, I did have a dig around on the website, and that's the first thing it hits you is

307
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:15,860
this message, but you can get rid of that and view the inventory.

308
00:17:15,860 --> 00:17:19,760
And really, I think it was more about the flash drives preloaded with various distros,

309
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:24,900
and you could get kind of slow USB 2.0 ones or for a bit more money, fast USB 3.0 ones.

310
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:31,060
But if you go to buy any of them now, the Add to Cart or whatever, then unfortunately,

311
00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:34,180
the message pops up again and says, no, no can do.

312
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:40,880
Not horrible prices either, 15 bucks for a 16 gig flash drive preloaded with Ubuntu 19.04.

313
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:43,820
For some people, that's not bad.

314
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:48,700
I mean, there are people that have very limited internet connections, and it's worth that

315
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:49,700
money to get that.

316
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:53,500
I suppose, but with things like Etcher these days that make it really easy to use a GUI

317
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:59,940
to get the image onto a USB stick and increasing speeds everywhere, it just kind of feels like

318
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:01,380
it belongs to a bygone era.

319
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:07,540
They did move on to flash drives from the DVDs and CDs, and I think that it's just the

320
00:18:07,540 --> 00:18:09,180
end of the road has been reached here.

321
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:10,180
Well, clearly it has.

322
00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:14,820
2019 feels like it's been a few of those, a few things that are of a bygone era that

323
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:15,980
are sort of spinning down.

324
00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:21,380
I mean, 16 years is a long time to serve the Linux customer base, so tip of the hat to

325
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:23,060
Ramsey for that.

326
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:28,700
And my new approach when I'm on limited bandwidth connections now is any time a distribution

327
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:31,540
offers a net installation option, I am using it.

328
00:18:31,540 --> 00:18:37,540
I have just had the best results with the Fedora net install medium.

329
00:18:37,540 --> 00:18:39,240
You can choose every desktop.

330
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:40,240
It's like it's almost better.

331
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:44,260
You get more options and you get a smaller ISO.

332
00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:49,540
It's my favorite combo is more options, smaller ISO, and it only pulls down the packages I

333
00:18:49,540 --> 00:18:51,060
need to get that installed.

334
00:18:51,060 --> 00:18:56,060
And so that's been my way on more bandwidth-constrained setups.

335
00:18:56,060 --> 00:18:57,860
Ironically, I use the network install.

336
00:18:57,860 --> 00:19:01,020
Yeah, I've always used that for Debian.

337
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:03,460
It's just the way to do it, really.

338
00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:04,460
Yeah, exactly.

339
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:06,540
You know, FreeBSD has one.

340
00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:11,360
Just tons of different distros have net installs, and it's a good way to go if you can't go

341
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:14,140
buy yourself a thumb drive, I suppose.

342
00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:21,300
But congratulations to Ramsey for 16 years of shipping over 300,000 disks and USB drives.

343
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:23,760
That's a lot of new Linux users.

344
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:27,220
Even if some of them already had Linux, you know at least a percentage of those were new,

345
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:29,100
and that's pretty great.

346
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:33,860
And they answered over 25,000 tech support tickets in their 16-year run.

347
00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:34,860
Wow.

348
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:37,180

talk from Texas Linux Fest, the keynote, a fantastic talk about why the distro wars need

355
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:00,340
to die.

356
00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:04,700
And next up in the feed, the whole Choose Linux crew get together to talk about L's

357
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:09,460
recent trip to Black Hat, B-Sides, DEF CON, and more from Hacker Summer Camp.

358
00:20:09,460 --> 00:20:11,780
Yeah, we had good fun chatting together in person.

359
00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:13,220
So yeah, do check that out.

360

362
00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:20,140
I am at Chris LAS.

363
00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:21,700
I'm at Joel Rissington.

364
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:24,380
Thanks for joining us, and we will see you next week.

365
00:20:24,380 --> 00:20:42,980
Until then, have a great day, and we'll see you later.
