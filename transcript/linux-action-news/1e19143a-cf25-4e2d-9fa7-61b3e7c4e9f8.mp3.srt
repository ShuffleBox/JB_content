00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,060
Hello and welcome to Linux Action News, our weekly take on Linux and the open source world.

2
00:00:16,060 --> 00:00:19,540
This is episode 9, recorded on July 9th, 2017.

3
00:00:19,540 --> 00:00:20,540
I'm Chris.

4
00:00:20,540 --> 00:00:21,540
And I'm Joe.

5
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:25,780
Joe, there's many things to dig into today, but I thought we'd start with one that was

6
00:00:25,780 --> 00:00:27,300
relatively uplifting.

7
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:31,640
There's a new release, Endless OS version 3.2 is out.

8
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:37,240
And the big news is it's rebased from Gnome Shell 3.8 to Gnome Shell 3.22.

9
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:39,040
That's not much of a jump, is it?

10
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:42,040
3.8 though, I believe is four years old, Joe.

11
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:45,240
That is a big important upgrade, if nothing else.

12
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:47,000
It was long overdue.

13
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:52,080
And they said that going forward, they intend to never have to relive this process again.

14
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:59,000
Yeah, they intend to hopefully rebase frequently, which seems like a very good plan to me because

15
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:04,380
you don't want to leave it that long, where it's an impossible task and it just gets harder

16
00:01:04,380 --> 00:01:05,380
and harder.

17
00:01:05,380 --> 00:01:09,580
I recently had a chat with Michael Hall on Linux Unplugged about Endless and what they're

18
00:01:09,580 --> 00:01:10,580
up to.

19
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:13,740
And if you're not familiar, because they are kind of new, it's an interesting project.

20
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:18,840
They're trying to take a Gnome Shell based desktop and make it work offline a little

21
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:19,840
better.

22
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:22,980
They want to preload it with content, preload it with existing data and make it work in

23
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:28,400
regions that don't have always on internet, which honestly is even some places here in

24
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:32,000
the United States, one of the places Michael Hall mentioned that they might be looking

25
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,180
to move into in the future is jails, which if you think about it is a great use case,

26
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:42,260
something that is secure, that is easy to use and works well offline, but also in countries

27
00:01:42,260 --> 00:01:44,300
that don't have proper internet connection.

28
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:46,580
And so they're working on some interesting special stuff.

29
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:51,660
And one of the other reasons that I pay some close attention to it is folks from the original

30
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:54,140
Gnome days are working on this stuff.

31
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:59,700
But you know, I kind of feel this is just not aimed at me because I have a solid internet

32
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:03,620
connection almost all the time and I'm not a new user.

33
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:07,500
So for me, I only really have an academic interest in this.

34
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:11,300
I think I kind of am in the same boat myself.

35
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:13,060
I really don't see myself using this.

36
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:17,540
Plus, I don't really see myself using something that legs a release or two behind Gnome.

37
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:21,140
I'm much more likely to want to use something that's pretty current.

38
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:25,800
And I'm still waiting to see the actual code go upstream.

39
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:29,540
There's a lot of talk about upstream and they say their intention is to reduce the difference

40
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:31,720
with upstream as much as possible.

41
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:35,260
And they're going to upstream everything they can as far as it makes sense for them to do

42
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:38,600
so, which I'm not quite sure what that means, but I believe them.

43
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:43,180
And they have pushed patches a few years ago when they first made that big switch with

44
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:44,180
Gnome 3.8.

45
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:47,940
But I don't think there's been a lot of code that's gone upstream since then.

46
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:49,980
So maybe we'll see some of that.

47
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:53,220
Part of that would be, of course, being based on a more modern version of Gnome Shell.

48
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:55,740
So that way their upstream patches were more relevant.

49
00:02:55,740 --> 00:03:00,740
Yeah, it's one thing to offer your patches upstream, but it's another for them to be

50
00:03:00,740 --> 00:03:01,740
accepted.

51
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:04,540
And it does look like they have some good ideas here.

52
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:08,380
So if they can stay current, there may be some stuff that the Gnome project might want

53
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:09,380
to take a look at.

54
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:16,260
Yeah, I think that for new users, it's good having the kind of phone-based icons and stuff.

55
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:20,700
Because a lot of people in developing countries never used laptops.

56
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:22,580
They went straight to the mobile experience.

57
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:28,420
And so it kind of makes sense to have more of a mobile-like experience on a laptop.

58
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:33,540
But if you've been using computers for years and years and years and are used to the kind

59
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:39,060
of traditional way of doing things, then this is just pushing it way more beyond even what

60
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:43,040
Gnome is into just pure mobile territory, basically.

61
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:45,380
It does feel a bit like a productized version of Gnome.

62
00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:49,580
And going back to your earlier comment about it being an academic fascination, that's what

63
00:03:49,580 --> 00:03:50,580
it is for me.

64
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:53,860
It's like, what if a company got together that knows Gnome that could build something

65
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:57,900
using OS tree and flat packs, and they could really deliver a product?

66
00:03:57,900 --> 00:03:58,900
What would it be?

67
00:03:58,900 --> 00:03:59,900
Well, this is it.

68
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:03,580
We're seeing that experimentation play out right here with Endless.

69
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:09,580
And maybe, maybe once they start getting some traction and more and more users start using

70
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:13,980
this stuff in production, some of these ideas will just work their way in.

71
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:18,180
Even if it's not code, if it's the concepts, might work their way into mainline Gnome Shell.

72
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:23,080
If you look at a screenshot of this thing, it looks like Windows 10 met Gnome Shell to

73
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:24,080
some degree.

74
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:28,380
Sounds like budgie to me.

75
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:33,380
Speaking of laptops, German laptop company Tuxedo is announcing its own Ubuntu flavor.

76
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:34,940
It's the season of distros, Joe.

77
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:37,180
Yeah, it seems to be the in thing.

78
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:43,260
If you are a Linux hardware seller, you should make your own distro because that's definitely

79
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:44,620
a good idea, right?

80
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:46,420
I would put a caveat next to that.

81
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:51,260
If you are a Linux hardware vendor who apparently doesn't sell enough units, I don't know what

82
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:55,780
Tuxedo sales are, but doesn't sell enough units to participate with an OEM program so

83
00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:58,980
that way Canonical just makes these changes for you, you're forced to do this.

84
00:04:58,980 --> 00:05:01,140
Might be another way to phrase that.

85
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:02,760
Yeah.

86
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:05,500
So we talked about Pop OS, didn't we, from System76?

87
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:09,500
Never heard of it.

88
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:16,540
So this time it's called Tuxedo Ubuntu 16.04 LTS, got to get the whole thing in there.

89
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:21,300
Yeah, which if I was going to make a distro, that's what I'd base it on because that's

90
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:22,460
what I use.

91
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:25,860
I'm sitting here looking at Ubuntu 16.04 right now.

92
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:30,060
Yeah, except it's not really Ubuntu 16.04 LTS, is it?

93
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:33,060
Because it's using a totally different kernel.

94
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:35,860
It's shipping with different proprietary firmware blobs.

95
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:41,980
It ships with the NVIDIA proprietary driver when necessary, adjustments on the grub, quote

96
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:48,360
unquote, and optimizations to other system-relevant files and their own theme, which you could

97
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:53,600
almost describe as a lacquer level of painting, and their own logos.

98
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,940
This is not really Ubuntu.

99
00:05:55,940 --> 00:05:58,060
This is something else.

100
00:05:58,060 --> 00:05:59,380
This is a modification of it.

101
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:03,740
In fact, to me, it's almost nonsensical to put Ubuntu 16.04 LTS because what part of

102
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:04,840
that is LTS?

103
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:06,800
What part of that is being maintained by Canonical?

104
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:10,280
Not the kernel, not the relevant system files, not grub.

105
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:13,620
So it's not really an LTS 16.04 Ubuntu anything.

106
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:18,080
Yeah, and Martin Winpress talked about this on the Ubuntu podcast, didn't he, about he

107
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:24,120
got a version of Ubuntu Mate on a review unit from Tuxedo, and they had just completely

108
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:25,220
butchered it.

109
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:29,660
All the trouble that Wimpy ran into was all justified in the name of improving the customer

110
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:30,660
experience.

111
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:35,280
And the one that they love to throw around with this new release is they took a Infinity

112
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:40,740
Book Pro 13, and they put Linux Mint 18.1 on there.

113
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:43,740
That got six hours of battery life.

114
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:49,660
Then they took their fancy Zubuntu fork on the same Ultrabook and got nearly twice the

115
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:55,780
battery life with almost 12 hours of battery performance just by swapping out the distro,

116
00:06:55,780 --> 00:06:56,780
Joe.

117
00:06:56,780 --> 00:06:58,420
Are you sure they didn't turn the brightness down as well?

118
00:06:58,420 --> 00:07:04,340
I think it has more to do with the kernel 4.11 that they swapped out to, those optimizations

119
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:08,700
to system relevant files, and the fact that I think they ran PowerTop and then just put

120
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:10,420
it in automatic mode.

121
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:11,420
Yeah.

122
00:07:11,420 --> 00:07:14,220
Well, and Linux Mint as well.

123
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:19,320
That's not a distro I would choose to use for pretty much anything, I'm afraid.

124
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:21,980
There's been so much going on, Joe, with all of this stuff.

125
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:22,980
Like you mentioned, you have Pop!

126
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:24,260
OS, you have Tuxedo going on.

127
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:25,720
Of course, Linux Mint is out there.

128
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:32,100
So it is interesting to get some data, some actual user data on laptops from the Linux

129
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:33,380
community right now.

130
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:37,460
Ferronics has published the 2017 Linux laptop survey results.

131
00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:40,500
They've had 30,171 responses.

132
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:41,500
So it's a lot of data.

133
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:42,780
You could draw different conclusions.

134
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:46,660
You can't necessarily say it's scientific, but it is pretty interesting.

135
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:51,960
Well, Tuxedo are concerned with battery life, but it seems that most people who run Linux

136
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:57,420
on their laptop aren't because that came out pretty much bottom of the list of what people

137
00:07:57,420 --> 00:07:58,420
want.

138
00:07:58,420 --> 00:08:03,080
Yeah, it was fourth in the survey, beat out by build quality, performance, and even being

139
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:05,180
preloaded with Linux.

140
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:06,760
Yeah.

141
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:10,960
And not many people buy machines preloaded with Linux, it seems still.

142
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:16,140
Only 10% of the respondents said that their most recent laptop came preloaded with Linux.

143
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:17,140
That surprised me a lot.

144
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:21,180
Yeah, because now we've got Dell machines, we've got all sorts of Linux vendors.

145
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:24,020
So you'd expect that number to be higher, I think.

146
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:28,360
But people are just stuck in a ways with their ThinkPads, it looks like.

147
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:31,420
They actually did break down the data amongst the different laptops.

148
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:35,380
And yeah, Lenovo was the number one hardware by quite a bit.

149
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:37,040
Lenovo really did pretty good.

150
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:43,860
Dell came in at second, Asus at third, HP fourth, Apple and Acer came in tied for fifth.

151
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:50,740
System 76 was the most popular dedicated Linux system provider, but it was only used by 2.1%

152
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:52,740
of the respondents.

153
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:53,740
That's a...

154
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:57,820
See, the reason why that surprised me, Joe, is this isn't a survey of the market of consumers

155
00:08:57,820 --> 00:09:00,520
interested in buying computers.

156
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:05,460
This is a survey of Linux enthusiasts that want to buy Linux computers, or computers

157
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:06,900
to run Linux.

158
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:13,620
So why is it that companies like System 76 are so low on surveys like this?

159
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:15,540
You suppose it could be store availability?

160
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:18,740
You know, Lenovo is in just about every electronics store here in the States.

161
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:20,660
Yeah, and Amazon and stuff, yeah.

162
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:21,660
Yeah, yeah, exactly.

163
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:24,380
Amazon, I bet you a big part of it is purchases on Amazon.

164
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:29,520
Dell, same thing, Dell is available in a lot of retail locations, also available online.

165
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:34,380
Apple not performing that strongly, even though all of those same things are true to Apple.

166
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:35,380
Not too surprising, though.

167
00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:38,900
If you're going to buy a MacBook, you're probably not buying it with the intention to run Linux

168
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:40,220
full time.

169
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:42,200
Some are, though, in this response.

170
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:48,900
So keeping the context of Pop OS and Tuxedo's Ubuntu 16.04 LTS, it is interesting then to

171
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:53,300
discuss what the most popular distros were in respondents.

172
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:55,340
You're probably not going to be too surprised by this one.

173
00:09:55,340 --> 00:10:02,420
Ubuntu was the most popular Linux distribution, running on 39.9% of the respondents' laptops.

174
00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:05,740
Second place was Arch Linux, followed by Debian.

175
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:11,020
And then rounding out the top 10 was Fedora at 14, Linux Mint came in at fifth, and then

176
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:15,500
OpenSUSE trailing in at 4%, Gentoo 3.9.

177
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:17,700
Just wow, look at this, Solus actually clocked in.

178
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:22,420
Good for Solus, clocking in at 2%, which is not bad for a brand new distro.

179
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:23,420
Yeah.

180
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:27,420
It does make me wonder how many people are actually running Arch and Debian, rather than

181
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:30,540
just saying that they're running Arch and Debian, and Gentoo as well.

182
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:34,060
Surely 3.9% of people can't actually be running Gentoo.

183
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:35,060
I believe it.

184
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:36,060
I believe it.

185
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:37,060
I do believe it.

186
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:40,260
I also think it's interesting that Solus almost has half the market share of SUSE already.

187
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:41,260
Yeah.

188
00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:42,260
That is interesting.

189
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:43,260
But I don't know.

190
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:49,220
We always say that SUSE is popular in Germany, but maybe the kind of people who run it don't

191
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:52,140
speak English and don't read sites like Pharaonyx, maybe.

192
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:53,140
Yeah.

193
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:54,140
This is what I was thinking.

194
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:55,140
Yeah.

195
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:56,420
Well, it wasn't just ran by Pharaonyx.

196
00:10:56,420 --> 00:10:57,580
Actually, he was lucky.

197
00:10:57,580 --> 00:10:59,580
A lot of places did pick it up.

198
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:01,220
I saw it spread out wide and far.

199
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:03,900
So he did get a good reach beyond just the Pharaonyx website.

200
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:06,540
But yeah, I think it was still mostly English outlets.

201
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:07,540
Yeah.

202
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:09,940
But yeah, good for Solus, 2%.

203
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:11,460
I'm sure Archie will be happy with that one.

204
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:13,500
I'd probably want 80% knowing him.

205
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:14,500
Yeah.

206
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:15,500
Yeah, of course.

207
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:16,500
Of course.

208
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:20,700
You got to have all the numbers.

209
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:23,580
Last.ting.com, go there before I get them to change that URL.

210
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:26,500
Go there when it was still cool and save money on your mobile plan.

211
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:29,620
It's really how mobile should have been done from day one in the States.

212
00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:33,800
They take your minutes, your messages, and your megabytes, and whatever you use, that's

213
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:34,800
what you pay.

214
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,820
Each line is just a $6 line.

215
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:37,820
And then it's just your usage.

216
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:39,860
So if you want three phones, you just pay six for each line.

217
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:41,460
You want to add a fourth, it's $6.

218
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:43,720
I love this plan for small businesses too.

219
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:48,180
The average Ting bill is just $23 per phone per month.

220
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:53,580
Last.ting.com will take $25 off a device, or if you bring one, and they have a CDMA

221
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:57,960
and GSM network, they'll give you $25 in service credit, and it just might pay for more than

222
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:59,060
your first month.

223
00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:03,460
No contracts, no early termination fees, and it's really simple to use with great customer

224
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:05,340
service nationwide coverage.

225
00:12:05,340 --> 00:12:11,900
Just pay for what you use, last.ting.com.

226
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:16,660
So the big news in the UK this week is that people are starting to finally get their Mycroft

227
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:25,940
devices, including the voice, or well, the alleged voice of Mycroft, Alan Pope, who received

228
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:31,200
his and asked it a couple of questions and filmed the results.

229
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:34,780
And funny is one way to look at it.

230
00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:35,780
Tragic is another.

231
00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:36,780
Yeah.

232
00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:37,780
Yeah.

233
00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:38,780
You know, we knew this moment was coming, Joe.

234
00:12:38,780 --> 00:12:42,380
We knew eventually the public was going to get their hands on this thing, and it was

235
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:48,060
either going to be surprisingly good, or it was going to be awkwardly bad, and a friend

236
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:51,660
of the show, Alan Pope, decided to ask Mycroft, what are beans?

237
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:55,460
Hey, Mycroft, what are beans?

238
00:12:55,460 --> 00:13:00,740
And then a very long, awkward pause of silence.

239
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:01,740
It's thinking, Joe.

240
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:02,740
It's thinking.

241
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:05,740
Hard, apparently.

242
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:06,740
Still thinking, Joe.

243
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:16,900
Beans serve in size 130g, total calories 132, fat calories 4%, daily value caret asterisk,

244
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:29,180
total fat 433 mg, 1%, saturated fat 61 mg, 0%, trans fat, cholesterol 0g, 0%, sodium

245
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:42,180
264 mg, 11%, total carbohydrates 25g, 8%, dietary fiber 7g, 97%, sugar 1g, protein 8g,

246
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:59,140
10%, vitamin C 5%, calcium 5%, iron 14%, thiamine 14%, vitamin B 6, 8%, folate 9%,

247
00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:08,260
phosphorus 10%, magnesium 12%, zinc 5%, asterisk percent, daily values are based on 2,000 calories

248
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:11,700
averaged over different types of prepared beans.

249
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:12,700
Oh, that's better.

250
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:17,060
Are you still talking?

251
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:23,300
Oh, that is a bad show right there.

252
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:24,380
Yeah.

253
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:28,340
And there's a bunch of other videos which are fairly, I think that's probably the worst

254
00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:36,740
of it, but it's just compared with Alexa or Google Home, I mean, it's just, it's light

255
00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:37,740
years behind.

256
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:38,740
Yeah, yeah.

257
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:41,580
You know, if we were going to break this problem down, though, we have two things.

258
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:46,540
So we have the hardware, which is Raspberry Pi based right now, and the industrial design,

259
00:14:46,540 --> 00:14:48,860
and the way the information is displayed on the device.

260
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:53,940
I'm actually going to give it a good solid pass on all of those things.

261
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:55,620
I think the industrial design looks pretty good.

262
00:14:55,620 --> 00:14:59,780
I like the way that the volume is represented by a light ring around the eyeballs.

263
00:14:59,780 --> 00:15:02,380
So the physical product, pretty good.

264
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:08,060
Now, the problem is the cloud backend that actually makes that product usable seems pretty

265
00:15:08,060 --> 00:15:09,060
horrible.

266
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:12,300
And when Mycroft, the company, was contacted about this, they say that they still have

267
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:16,980
a lot of work to do in order to improve the wake word recognition and concede that the

268
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:23,180
voice user experience is still young and the skills that have been developed need significant

269
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:24,180
refinement.

270
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:27,300
That's a bit of an understatement.

271
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:28,300
Yeah.

272
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:29,300
Yeah.

273
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:30,300
You're right about the look of it.

274
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:34,980
And yeah, do check out the YouTube videos that Popey made, we'll have links to them.

275
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:36,220
It looks good.

276
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:38,300
My wife said, oh, it looks really cute.

277
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:43,460
And you know, I can see people liking that, but yeah, just the software in it, I don't

278
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:48,100
know to what extent it's the software in the actual device, because that's got to have

279
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:53,580
some bearing on the delay there, because there's an awfully long delay while I was thinking

280
00:15:53,580 --> 00:15:56,620
about how to process your request.

281
00:15:56,620 --> 00:15:59,980
But the thing is that even some of the backend stuff is proprietary, so you can't just say

282
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:06,460
that it's not just because it's open source that that's the problem.

283
00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:10,580
To me, this is a very poor advert for all things free and open source.

284
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:13,600
Yeah, this is one of those stories that you hope doesn't get around.

285
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:16,820
You don't want to see this at the top of TechCrunch tomorrow.

286
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:20,500
This is one of those things where we hope we can just quietly work on while everybody

287
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:25,880
else like the Echo and the Google Home and the HomePod have their day in the sun.

288
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:30,540
The reality is, is we're way behind here, open sources, and this is a new frontier for

289
00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:35,700
us because it involves so much data, so much processing, it requires incredible network

290
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:38,100
connectivity and infrastructure.

291
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:41,700
This has got to be one of the biggest challenges that consumer open source is going to be facing

292
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:42,700
in a long time.

293
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:45,340
Well, is it or is it just going to be forgotten about?

294
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:51,620
I don't know, because I'd have a lot more sympathy for Mycroft as a company if they

295
00:16:51,620 --> 00:16:53,360
had delivered more quickly.

296
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:59,780
They did two crowd funders and we've waited how long, over a year, and this is the result

297
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:01,180
of it.

298
00:17:01,180 --> 00:17:05,100
If it had been delivered more quickly as a developer device, and it says it's rough around

299
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:12,780
the edges and all that kind of stuff, cause itself a prototype, but if it was quicker

300
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:16,780
I'd have more sympathy, and I'd have more sympathy with them taking so long if it was

301
00:17:16,780 --> 00:17:19,940
better, but you can't have both, can you?

302
00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:25,740
It's like that whole thing about do you want it quick, cheap, or good, and you pick two,

303
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:31,500
and they've done it slowly and badly, and it wasn't particularly cheap either.

304
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:35,480
Maybe they could follow the Sailfish model and just keep keeping at it, because eventually

305
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:39,680
you end up with an Intel based tablet that runs Sailfish OS and Android support up on

306
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:41,260
IndieGoGo Joe.

307
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:48,060
Yeah, so we spoke about this, didn't we, a few weeks ago, how there was an update for

308
00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:53,700
the first Yola tablet running Sailfish OS, which was a crowd funder and then was never

309
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:57,140
delivered and people still are waiting for their refunds.

310
00:17:57,140 --> 00:18:07,220
Well a new Sailfish tablet has appeared on IndieGoGo from a company called Uyota, something

311
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:12,980
like that, and it looks remarkably similar to the other tablet, doesn't it, in terms

312
00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:19,820
of specs and even the design of it, and it just seems like, for me once, shame on you.

313
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:23,940
I don't know, would you even consider backing this IndieGoGo?

314
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:28,260
Didn't even cross my mind for a hot second, which is interesting because back in the day

315
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:32,380
I think I might have, and I'm even kind of impressed by the specs, I'm willing to consider

316
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:36,740
an x86 tablet because the upsides are pretty high if it actually worked, and this thing

317
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:44,500
has a quad core, 1.8GHz processor, 32GB or 64GB of storage, 2GB of DDR3L RAM, it's got

318
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:50,040
a 7.85 inch IPS display with a 330 pixel density, which is nice.

319
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:54,900
It's a good looking rig, really, I just didn't even consider for a hot second backing this

320
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:55,900
thing.

321
00:18:55,900 --> 00:19:00,140
Yeah, the thing about it being x86 is you've got a remote chance, at least, of being able

322
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:03,740
to run GNU slash Linux on it if it doesn't work out.

323
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:05,760
Yeah, you've got that backup plan.

324
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:11,140
It looks nice though, and if I was confident that they were going to deliver, then I might

325
00:19:11,140 --> 00:19:15,420
seriously consider it because I would like to get my hands on a Sailfish tablet, and

326
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:23,100
of the other OSs, the other Linux based mobile OSs, I would say Sailfish is by far the best,

327
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:24,900
and that's probably why it's the only one that survived.

328
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:29,140
Yeah, I completely agree, I think you're right on all points, and the fact that you can run

329
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:33,340
Android applications on this thing sort of gives you the peace of mind that there's going

330
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:36,120
to be right out of the box things you can do with it.

331
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:43,220
Pricing on the Indiegogo starts at $199 with an estimated September 2017 ship day, then

332
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:47,580
it bumps up from there, if you say you want to get 64 gigs, you're looking at $220.

333
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:49,300
These are not bad prices.

334
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:56,540
Not bad prices and very quick delivery for an Indiegogo, if that actually doesn't slip,

335
00:19:56,540 --> 00:19:57,660
but we'll see.

336
00:19:57,660 --> 00:20:00,880
When I see those dates and I see these prices, this tells me that this is hardware that's

337
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:04,740
already manufactured, and it's a matter of just refining the OS to work on it properly.

338
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:07,100
Yeah, and it's hit its goal.

339
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:08,740
They smashed through it in just a few days.

340
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:14,980
They wanted $50,000 and they've got $67,000 now, and they seem to be getting more and

341
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:15,980
more backers all the time.

342
00:20:15,980 --> 00:20:17,700
Yeah, 12 days left still too.

343
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:19,720
Yeah, and it's quite a short campaign as well.

344
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:25,220
They obviously are looking to turn this around as quickly as possible, and one of the things

345
00:20:25,220 --> 00:20:30,820
they want the money for is to officially license Sailfish, because that's what Yola are trying

346
00:20:30,820 --> 00:20:31,820
to do now, aren't they?

347
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:34,020
That's their business model.

348
00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:39,060
And suddenly the blog post that we reported on a couple of weeks ago makes sense how they

349
00:20:39,060 --> 00:20:45,980
were planning to make some money from their licensing agreements and give that back to

350
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:48,020
the original backers.

351
00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:53,420
So it seems like, I'm not going to say Robin Peter to pay Paul, but it's kind of like the

352
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:58,180
people who are backing this tablet are going to be paying back the people who backed the

353
00:20:58,180 --> 00:21:00,860
last one kind of indirectly.

354
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:02,980
So that all makes sense now.

355
00:21:02,980 --> 00:21:05,020
Yeah, that is a good observation.

356
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:09,380
And also something else I noticed is they believe that they're going to be able to ship

357
00:21:09,380 --> 00:21:14,340
these things 45 days after they start assembling, and they're going to do assembly in Foxconn.

358
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:20,420
These are solid numbers and locations, which means this is a pretty sure bet, and yet still

359
00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:21,420
not backing it.

360
00:21:21,420 --> 00:21:22,660
I just want to see it ship.

361
00:21:22,660 --> 00:21:24,540
I want to see it ship for a little while.

362
00:21:24,540 --> 00:21:25,700
Then maybe I'll consider it.

363
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:30,500
Yeah, I mean, if they can actually deliver this, they're going to make some reasonable

364
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:36,020
money, and then people will be more filled with confidence.

365
00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:38,140
And I think people will buy it.

366
00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:43,780
And I would consider it at that point, because my tablets are getting a bit long in the teeth.

367
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:47,740
And you would hope that there might be lineage available for it.

368
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:53,140
And maybe some kind of GNU slash Linux, as I said, so it seems like a fair proposition.

369
00:21:53,140 --> 00:21:57,980
And this keyboard that comes with as an option looks quite nice as well.

370
00:21:57,980 --> 00:21:58,980
They call it a two-in-one.

371
00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:01,900
I think that's a little bit...

372
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:05,860
It's not really fair to call a case with a keyboard addition a two-in-one, but it still

373
00:22:05,860 --> 00:22:06,860
looks pretty cool.

374
00:22:06,860 --> 00:22:11,500
And if they wanted to send me one for free, I would be all over it, but I'm not risking

375
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:13,060
200 bucks on this, I'm afraid.

376
00:22:13,060 --> 00:22:17,980
Yeah, I'll wait for a couple of reviews, and then maybe I'll grab one and we'll do a review.

377
00:22:17,980 --> 00:22:19,380
But yeah, I do agree with you.

378
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:21,260
It looks like a good product if they can ship it.

379
00:22:21,260 --> 00:22:25,660
And Sailfish OS is one of my favorite alternative mobile operating systems.

380
00:22:25,660 --> 00:22:30,020
Yeah, I quite like Tizen as well, and I haven't used that for a long time, so I can only assume

381
00:22:30,020 --> 00:22:31,460
it's got better.

382
00:22:31,460 --> 00:22:35,340
But yeah, Firefox OS was a bit DOA, really.

383
00:22:35,340 --> 00:22:39,300
And then we know what happened with Ubuntu Touch.

384
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:41,300
Too soon, Joe, too soon.

385
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:45,220
All right, let's talk about Mozilla.

386
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:46,220
What are they up to?

387
00:22:46,220 --> 00:22:48,700
What are they spending their Yahoo billions on this week?

388
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:52,140
Well, we've been wondering where they're going to go and how they're going to stay relevant.

389
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:56,060
And Mozilla has announced its own Project Things framework designed to pull together

390
00:22:56,060 --> 00:23:01,180
existing Web of Things specifications and code under a global framework comprised of

391
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:03,500
device, gateway, and cloud components.

392
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:05,300
We've got too many standards, Chris.

393
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:06,500
We need another one.

394
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:12,500
This is sort of like the omni layer that sits on top of Google standards, Microsoft's, Amazon's,

395
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:16,940
Apple's, and Samsung's, which gets a huge cross section.

396
00:23:16,940 --> 00:23:21,900
And this stuff is so fragmented because each vendor has their own application protocol.

397
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:26,900
Google has Weave, Amazon has MQTT, Apple has HomeKit.

398
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:28,520
They have network protocols.

399
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:30,780
Most of them speak Wi-Fi to some degree.

400
00:23:30,780 --> 00:23:33,820
Some of them do Bluetooth and other things running over Bluetooth.

401
00:23:33,820 --> 00:23:36,820
And then, of course, there's the operating systems that most of these devices are powered

402
00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:43,140
by, Linux or Android of Things, Windows IoT, which nobody really uses, iOS for the HomeKit

403
00:23:43,140 --> 00:23:49,780
stuff, and Linux or Android or a mix for like a lot of the Samsung stuff and the Wemo products

404
00:23:49,780 --> 00:23:51,260
from Belkin.

405
00:23:51,260 --> 00:23:56,020
There's just a crap ton of mess, lots of different standards, tons of fragmentation.

406
00:23:56,020 --> 00:24:00,900
And what Mozilla wants to do is put a layer that sits on top of all this stuff and essentially

407
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:06,700
gives each device a web-like URL that anything can talk.

408
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:12,340
You know that old phrase about if all you've got is a hammer, everything looks like a nail?

409
00:24:12,340 --> 00:24:14,460
I kind of feel that way about Mozilla.

410
00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:18,020
To them, all they have is the web.

411
00:24:18,020 --> 00:24:21,100
And so that's the solution to every problem is the web.

412
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:27,420
They say that the goal is creating a decentralized Internet of Things by giving things URLs on

413
00:24:27,420 --> 00:24:32,820
the web to make them linkable and discoverable and by defining a standard data model and

414
00:24:32,820 --> 00:24:34,140
APIs to make them interoperable.

415
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:36,140
But do you know what I mean?

416
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:37,980
Look at the phone, right?

417
00:24:37,980 --> 00:24:39,520
What was the solution to the phone?

418
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:43,780
Make it basically web technologies and that didn't work out.

419
00:24:43,780 --> 00:24:49,660
So they're just constantly pushing this and I don't know whether that is the solution.

420
00:24:49,660 --> 00:24:53,540
I think that open standards are always good.

421
00:24:53,540 --> 00:25:00,380
And I think that Mozilla, I like to poke fun at them and everything, but of anyone to be

422
00:25:00,380 --> 00:25:04,980
in charge of this stuff and pushing standards in this area, Mozilla is a company who, well,

423
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:08,340
an organization that I am happy to do that.

424
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:12,980
But I just wonder if this is necessarily the right approach.

425
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:18,100
I don't really have any alternative approaches to offer, so maybe I shouldn't be criticizing

426
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:19,100
it.

427
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:21,580
Well, you know, the Linux Foundation does.

428
00:25:21,580 --> 00:25:25,460
There is something the Linux Foundation and Dell and a lot of other vendors have been

429
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:30,540
working on now for a couple of months that is essentially this, also runs on Raspberry

430
00:25:30,540 --> 00:25:33,220
Pis like the early prototypes of this do.

431
00:25:33,220 --> 00:25:34,220
So we'll see.

432
00:25:34,220 --> 00:25:35,780
They are a little late to this game.

433
00:25:35,780 --> 00:25:41,500
See, the issue is the problem is already here and this needed to be here, I would say a

434
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:43,660
year or two ago, to be honest with you.

435
00:25:43,660 --> 00:25:49,160
And like you said, it is cramming web technologies into an IoT solution.

436
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:53,840
The reason why I mentioned that again is this area, these Internet of Things devices, it's

437
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:57,340
all super crap cheap hardware that doesn't have a lot of room for overhead.

438
00:25:57,340 --> 00:26:01,700
So this software that Mozilla is releasing is implemented in JavaScript.

439
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:06,940
It runs on a Node.js web server and then you put that on a Raspberry Pi.

440
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:12,120
And they're also working on, now they are aware that non-web languages are important,

441
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:15,540
but the things they have on their priority list don't really feel like they apply to

442
00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:20,060
Microsoft and Apple and Samsung because when they go to cite other programming languages

443
00:26:20,060 --> 00:26:22,380
they might support in the future, they list Rust.

444
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:26,780
I love Rust, but Amazon doesn't love Rust, Apple doesn't love Rust, Microsoft doesn't

445
00:26:26,780 --> 00:26:28,440
love Rust, Samsung, they don't care.

446
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:32,180
So if you're going to try to build in support, maybe go for something the rest of the market's

447
00:26:32,180 --> 00:26:33,180
using.

448
00:26:33,180 --> 00:26:36,420
Yeah, why not do it properly with something low level like C?

449
00:26:36,420 --> 00:26:40,780
Right, something that you would eek the most performance out of would be what I would think.

450
00:26:40,780 --> 00:26:44,220
Now this is a management layer, so I kind of get it, and you want something people can

451
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:47,660
write to, but it's just more lacquer on top of lacquer.

452
00:26:47,660 --> 00:26:49,660
That's my theme today.

453
00:26:49,660 --> 00:26:56,860
Yeah, well, Mozilla, bless them, they have to keep trying to be relevant somehow, don't

454
00:26:56,860 --> 00:27:01,140
they, and it's not really working out on the desktop, so it makes sense that they'd go

455
00:27:01,140 --> 00:27:05,180
after the IoT because that's the new hotness, isn't it?

456
00:27:05,180 --> 00:27:08,160
That's where everything's going, supposedly.

457
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:11,820
And this problem that we just went through, it does underscore the fact that standardization

458
00:27:11,820 --> 00:27:12,820
needs to happen here.

459
00:27:12,820 --> 00:27:17,260
You're not going to have stuff securely implemented and maintained unless something like this

460
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:19,700
comes along, I would like it to be Mozilla.

461
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:22,020
Yeah, I wouldn't mind it being canonical, to be honest.

462
00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:26,380
I know they've got this big push, and okay, they've made some mistakes in the past, but

463
00:27:26,380 --> 00:27:30,100
they've always been really good at open sourcing everything, even if it takes them a while,

464
00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:31,820
like with Ubuntu 1.

465
00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:37,900
So I wouldn't mind them, I wouldn't mind Mozilla, as long as we have open standards, that's

466
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:39,620
all that really matters.

467
00:27:39,620 --> 00:27:41,300
Well that brings us to the end of this week's show.
