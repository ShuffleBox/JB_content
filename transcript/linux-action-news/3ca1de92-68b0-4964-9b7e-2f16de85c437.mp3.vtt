Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, our weekly take on Linux and the open source world.

00:15.820 --> 00:20.500
This is episode 75, recorded on October 14th, 2018.

00:20.500 --> 00:21.500
I'm Chris.

00:21.500 --> 00:22.500
And I'm Tom.

00:22.500 --> 00:23.500
Hello, Joe.

00:23.500 --> 00:27.180
It's good to be connected with you, and I smell a fork of brew, and we'll get to that

00:27.180 --> 00:28.180
in a little bit.

00:28.180 --> 00:33.680
There's a ton of news this week to jump into, so let's start with the highlight of the week.

00:33.680 --> 00:38.920
It's perhaps Linux's best Android alternative, Ubuntu Touch, and they have a brand new release.

00:38.920 --> 00:43.500
Yeah, OTA-5 has been released, hot on the heels of OTA-4.

00:43.500 --> 00:47.560
And if you look at the release notes, you'd be forgiven for thinking, hang on, isn't this

00:47.560 --> 00:50.040
the same deal as OTA-4?

00:50.040 --> 00:54.040
The major feature is that it's based on Ubuntu 16.04 rather than 15.04.

00:54.040 --> 00:55.560
Yeah, that's how I read it.

00:55.560 --> 01:00.640
Yeah, well, I spoke to Dalton from the project about this today, and he told me that with

01:00.640 --> 01:04.240
OTA-4, it wasn't kind of an automatic upgrade.

01:04.240 --> 01:09.880
You had to manually do that yourself if you were running an older version, whereas now

01:09.880 --> 01:13.160
with OTA-5, it is being offered to people.

01:13.160 --> 01:15.500
It is kind of an automatic upgrade.

01:15.500 --> 01:17.700
It's not opt-in, if you know what I mean.

01:17.700 --> 01:23.940
So it was almost like a soft launch with OTA-4, but now it's for real.

01:23.940 --> 01:29.120
They are confident in their 16.04 version, and they're calling it solid.

01:29.120 --> 01:30.700
Okay, I mean, that's good to hear.

01:30.700 --> 01:35.720
And for those that don't recall or don't follow closely enough, the phone images are an LTS

01:35.720 --> 01:36.720
behind.

01:36.720 --> 01:37.720
That's standard.

01:37.720 --> 01:38.720
Yeah.

01:38.720 --> 01:39.720
So they're not technically behind as far as the phone releases go.

01:39.720 --> 01:40.720
This is right on target.

01:40.720 --> 01:44.600
There's a couple of new features, though, that snuck into OTA-5 that I think are kind

01:44.600 --> 01:45.600
of cool.

01:45.600 --> 01:49.440
I think probably the one that's the most user-facing is going to be that Morph browser.

01:49.440 --> 01:51.580
I guess their old browser, was it called browser?

01:51.580 --> 01:53.500
And they're getting rid of that.

01:53.500 --> 01:56.700
And they have a new one that's based on the Qt Web Engine technology.

01:56.700 --> 01:57.700
And that is called Morph.

01:57.700 --> 02:03.840
And the reason it's called that is because it has support for Qt's automatic screen scaling.

02:03.840 --> 02:08.800
So you can come in with a very small display, a very large display, and it'll display an

02:08.800 --> 02:13.320
optimal size for that form factor for the web browser, which also means how the page

02:13.320 --> 02:15.400
gets rendered in the web browser.

02:15.400 --> 02:18.640
And this guy is based on a more recent version of the Chromium base, too.

02:18.640 --> 02:20.600
So it seems like Morph is a pretty solid addition.

02:20.600 --> 02:26.840
Yeah, it was available before as a browser-ng, I presume, next generation.

02:26.840 --> 02:31.680
But it wasn't quite ready, and that's why they didn't ship it by default, whereas the

02:31.680 --> 02:38.040
old browser was just crusty and broken, and a lot of things didn't render properly.

02:38.040 --> 02:41.080
So this was a key issue for them to fix.

02:41.080 --> 02:44.480
And that's why it's kind of the headline feature, really.

02:44.480 --> 02:48.320
There's a feature in here that only a community project like this would have.

02:48.320 --> 02:55.840
Big Apple and Google would never do this, and it's user-submitted backgrounds and audio

02:55.840 --> 02:56.840
creations.

02:56.840 --> 03:02.080
So you've got wallpapers and also notification tones and ringtones that are going to be included

03:02.080 --> 03:04.840
in this OTA image that were created by the community.

03:04.840 --> 03:06.400
And I bet you some of those are pretty neat.

03:06.400 --> 03:10.560
I'd almost want to flash this on a device if I had one that worked still.

03:10.560 --> 03:15.440
My Nexus device finally this weekend kicked the bucket and now just boot loops on me,

03:15.440 --> 03:17.240
and I don't know what I did wrong.

03:17.240 --> 03:22.640
So my play device has died, but if I had one I could try this on, I would definitely go

03:22.640 --> 03:23.640
check out those tones.

03:23.640 --> 03:27.360
And I don't know, I'm just saying maybe save them for future use.

03:27.360 --> 03:29.800
I bet I could fix that Nexus for you.

03:29.800 --> 03:30.800
You think so?

03:30.800 --> 03:31.800
I don't know if it'd be worth shipping it to you, though.

03:31.800 --> 03:35.080
Yeah, it's a long way, but I reckon I could have a go.

03:35.080 --> 03:37.760
Yeah, you do have a knack for fixing those boot loops.

03:37.760 --> 03:40.280
I guess you've run into it a few times.

03:40.280 --> 03:45.680
So another release this week was Plasma 5.14, which presumably you have been rocking and

03:45.680 --> 03:46.680
enjoying.

03:46.680 --> 03:47.680
Me?

03:47.680 --> 03:48.680
Nah.

03:48.680 --> 03:49.680
Couldn't be bothered, Joe.

03:49.680 --> 03:50.680
Not excited.

03:50.680 --> 03:51.680
No, I'm kidding.

03:51.680 --> 03:53.760
I actually had it installed before the release announcement was out.

03:53.760 --> 03:56.480
I'm very much liking Plasma 5.14.

03:56.480 --> 04:00.320
I'll kind of go into one thing that's probably the big headline feature, and that is that

04:00.320 --> 04:06.200
Discover, which is Plasma's software manager, among other things, has now added a firmware

04:06.200 --> 04:12.120
update feature that uses LVFS, which we talk about quite frequently, and FW Update Demon

04:12.120 --> 04:17.640
under the hood to update the firmware of your Linux boxes, which was something that could

04:17.640 --> 04:21.060
only be done via the GUI under GNOME software before.

04:21.060 --> 04:22.540
And so now Discover has shipped this feature.

04:22.540 --> 04:25.180
I have used it, and so far it's worked well.

04:25.180 --> 04:27.800
And are you using Wayland with it then?

04:27.800 --> 04:30.120
No, I have not made that switch yet.

04:30.120 --> 04:34.680
I don't really plan to until Neon makes that switch or Kubuntu makes that switch.

04:34.680 --> 04:39.360
Okay, fair enough, because they have landed some fixes for Wayland, specifically copy

04:39.360 --> 04:43.120
paste between GTK and non-GTK apps.

04:43.120 --> 04:48.340
That would be very attractive to me because I don't think that if I did make the switch

04:48.340 --> 04:50.880
that I could make the switch completely to Qt applications.

04:50.880 --> 04:53.280
I'd need to use a few GTK applications at least.

04:53.280 --> 04:57.920
Yeah, I think you asked on User Air this week, which if you are out there listening, going,

04:57.920 --> 05:00.400
why is everybody talking about Plasma?

05:00.400 --> 05:06.680
It's worth checking out User Air 50, air.show slash 50, because they talk about this, Dan,

05:06.680 --> 05:13.080
Poppy, and Joe here, and I think the key point that was brought up, a lot of work over the

05:13.080 --> 05:19.680
years has gone into making GTK and Qt applications look fine on the respective desktops.

05:19.680 --> 05:24.460
And under Plasma, there are specific settings where you can go in and choose what GTK theme

05:24.460 --> 05:29.360
you want apps to use, and there's one that makes it essentially look like breeze apps.

05:29.360 --> 05:31.640
And there's also a breeze dark option, which is the one I use.

05:31.640 --> 05:34.400
So basically all my apps kind of look the same.

05:34.400 --> 05:39.520
You really kind of have to be an expert on Qt widgets versus GTK widgets to know which

05:39.520 --> 05:40.720
one you're actually looking at.

05:40.720 --> 05:45.800
Well, you mentioned the Plasma Discover, the software center type application and how that's

05:45.800 --> 05:48.080
had some improvements.

05:48.080 --> 05:50.420
One of the big ones is support for snap channels.

05:50.420 --> 05:56.160
So now you can have the betas and the bleeding edge stuff if you want, as well as the stable,

05:56.160 --> 05:57.560
which is a pretty big deal.

05:57.560 --> 06:03.280
Yeah, especially since this week, they just launched the Plex server as a snap, and that's

06:03.280 --> 06:06.760
in the beta channel right now because it's a beta version of the Plex server.

06:06.760 --> 06:08.820
When stable comes out, it'll be in the stable channel.

06:08.820 --> 06:12.720
So having a software manager that understands the differences between these channels is

06:12.720 --> 06:14.760
more important than ever right now for some of us.

06:14.760 --> 06:18.040
Yeah, although would you be running a Plex server with a GUI?

06:18.040 --> 06:21.600
I suppose maybe if it's an old laptop that you want to do a couple of other things with.

06:21.600 --> 06:27.580
No, you know what I actually do it is on, I have a monster workstation that is, well,

06:27.580 --> 06:32.000
by my standards, back when we built it, it was like six cores and 64 gigs of RAM and

06:32.000 --> 06:35.960
tons of disks in there that I just slice off a little bit of that running Plex because

06:35.960 --> 06:39.320
that thing runs 24-7, and I don't even sit down at 24-7.

06:39.320 --> 06:41.240
Okay, fair enough.

06:41.240 --> 06:42.720
But it's not just snaps, is it?

06:42.720 --> 06:45.520
It's also flat pack support has been improved now.

06:45.520 --> 06:46.520
Right.

06:46.520 --> 06:49.360
This is a handy feature that they've added where if you try to install a flat pack, instead

06:49.360 --> 06:54.000
of just getting an error message that tells you to go fish, they will ask you if you would

06:54.000 --> 06:58.760
like to install the flat pack backend that you need to support flat packs, a nice addition

06:58.760 --> 06:59.760
there.

06:59.760 --> 07:03.840
The other just really quick, nice quality of life improvements, if you do presentations

07:03.840 --> 07:07.920
at work, or you're hooking up to external displays, they have a display configuration

07:07.920 --> 07:11.800
widget that comes up on your screen now that choose really common layouts or go right to

07:11.800 --> 07:15.580
advanced display settings as soon as it detects that new display connected.

07:15.580 --> 07:16.580
That's nice.

07:16.580 --> 07:20.580
But the other thing that I was really happy to see is something that used to be in Plasma

07:20.580 --> 07:26.280
ages ago is back, and that is support for SSH VPN tunnels right there in the network

07:26.280 --> 07:27.280
manager.

07:27.280 --> 07:30.600
You just click a button and you have an SSH VPN tunnel.

07:30.600 --> 07:31.600
It's pretty gorgeous.

07:31.600 --> 07:35.560
Yeah, all in all, this seems to be yet another solid release from the KDE team, doesn't it?

07:35.560 --> 07:38.080
Yeah, really consistent, nice improvements.

07:38.080 --> 07:42.200
They've been nailing it release after release for a while now, and I think that's contributing

07:42.200 --> 07:43.920
to a lot of attention there.

07:43.920 --> 07:47.600
I'd say the future for Plasma desktop looks really good.

07:47.600 --> 07:50.800
You mentioned the Wayland support that they're working on.

07:50.800 --> 07:56.080
Now we're getting down to refinement things, copying and pasting between Qt and GTK applications,

07:56.080 --> 07:59.600
and we're working on refining our support for these universal installer formats that

07:59.600 --> 08:02.000
are shipping and becoming more and more common.

08:02.000 --> 08:06.880
As major applications are shipped as flat packs or snaps, there is a real need to have

08:06.880 --> 08:10.200
good support in the software manager for the desktop environment.

08:10.200 --> 08:15.720
I think 5.14 is another really good release in a long run of good releases.

08:15.720 --> 08:20.380
Yeah, it's easy to kind of imagine that everyone installs software like we do with the command

08:20.380 --> 08:23.300
line, but I think the reality is that most people don't, do they?

08:23.300 --> 08:25.120
They actually do use the GUI.

08:25.120 --> 08:30.720
That's why it's really important for GUI software managers to get this support.

08:30.720 --> 08:34.200
I agree, and I have seen it over and over again when I sit somebody down with Linux

08:34.200 --> 08:38.880
for the first time, and they go get whatever that app is that isn't in the repo, Spotify

08:38.880 --> 08:45.960
or Chrome or whatever it is, and they download a dab or an RPM, and they double click it,

08:45.960 --> 08:50.720
and the software store or the software manager launches, and it's this massively complicated

08:50.720 --> 08:54.640
piece of software, and that is their experience of installing these things right now.

08:54.640 --> 08:59.080
So as they streamline this stuff and they make it automatically install flat pack backend

08:59.080 --> 09:03.520
type stuff, it makes that first user experience when you download that RPM or a dab or that

09:03.520 --> 09:08.960
flat pack file now a lot more straightforward, a lot clearer, and it eventually works and

09:08.960 --> 09:12.520
gets your software loaded and installed, which is not necessarily the case right now.

09:12.520 --> 09:15.760
Well, the question is, should you be installing flat packs?

09:15.760 --> 09:20.800
Certainly not according to a new website that popped up this week called flatkill.org.

09:20.800 --> 09:24.120
Little dramatic in its URL and in its stance.

09:24.120 --> 09:27.400
Red Hat's flat pack has been getting a lot of attention lately, right?

09:27.400 --> 09:31.840
It's the self-proclaimed new way of distributing desktop applications on Linux.

09:31.840 --> 09:33.880
It's secure, they say.

09:33.880 --> 09:38.820
And then it goes in to really kind of tear up flat packs, calls the sandbox a lie, says

09:38.820 --> 09:43.320
folks aren't getting the proper security updates that they need and they're left vulnerable.

09:43.320 --> 09:44.680
It takes a strong stance.

09:44.680 --> 09:48.400
It says that Red Hat developers don't care about security.

09:48.400 --> 09:50.440
There's some claims in here, Joe.

09:50.440 --> 09:56.240
Yeah, and on the surface of it, it seems to be almost justified, really.

09:56.240 --> 10:02.160
There's a fair bit of evidence to support these ideas that flat packs are not a great

10:02.160 --> 10:03.760
idea.

10:03.760 --> 10:10.600
But then when you really kind of step back from it, you realize that almost all of what

10:10.600 --> 10:16.920
is being said on this website is not necessarily a criticism of flat pack as a technology.

10:16.920 --> 10:21.000
It's more how flat packs are being implemented at the moment.

10:21.000 --> 10:24.400
That I think is the crux of the issue right there.

10:24.400 --> 10:26.560
He really doesn't have a case against flat packs.

10:26.560 --> 10:28.920
The issues are he or she pulls out.

10:28.920 --> 10:33.940
We tried to do a little digging and they've taken steps to hide their identity.

10:33.940 --> 10:39.320
They call out things like VS Code or Android Studio and Sublime Text, which are using unpatched

10:39.320 --> 10:42.880
versions of Git, version 2.93.

10:42.880 --> 10:49.460
Also they note that flat packs PyCharm comes with Git 2.19.0, which are vulnerable to a

10:49.460 --> 10:50.920
known exploit out there.

10:50.920 --> 10:55.080
So that's the case for saying that flat packs are insecure, is that some of the applications,

10:55.080 --> 10:58.920
like some of the larger ones like VS Code, are shipping with known vulnerabilities.

10:58.920 --> 11:04.200
In fact, one of the applications actually includes a method that someone could use to

11:04.200 --> 11:05.860
gain root access.

11:05.860 --> 11:10.240
So in one case, there's an application where you could follow a chain of exploits and get

11:10.240 --> 11:13.680
root access via a flat pack application.

11:13.680 --> 11:17.720
That's the crux of the argument here, but that comes down to how developers are or are

11:17.720 --> 11:19.280
not packaging their software.

11:19.280 --> 11:25.480
And I think what it betrays is a weakness in the universal packaging system.

11:25.480 --> 11:32.840
And that is when volunteers package these applications, like say VS Code or Steam or

11:32.840 --> 11:40.400
Audacity or VLC, they are not in sync with each individual release and necessarily tracking

11:40.400 --> 11:42.840
all of the components that are in that flat pack.

11:42.840 --> 11:48.760
I think that's why whenever possible, we really need developers packaging their own applications,

11:48.760 --> 11:49.760
not volunteers.

11:49.760 --> 11:52.900
It needs to be integrated into their build and deployment methodologies.

11:52.900 --> 11:57.440
But some developers are not interested in distributing their software like this.

11:57.440 --> 12:02.840
And so then you have this problem of, well, if the developer doesn't want to distribute

12:02.840 --> 12:08.160
it, then we can because it is free software and the license allows you to do so.

12:08.160 --> 12:12.080
And that's when you end up with volunteers doing it and then maybe stepping away and

12:12.080 --> 12:16.080
not keeping up, as you said, with the various security fixes and everything.

12:16.080 --> 12:20.720
These arguments have been made against applications in the Debian repository before.

12:20.720 --> 12:24.660
It is a software packaging issue, especially when it's volunteer based.

12:24.660 --> 12:28.500
And I think the answer there is that's Red Hat's problem to solve, frankly.

12:28.500 --> 12:32.600
If they're the primary sponsor of this project, then they're the ones that need to do that

12:32.600 --> 12:33.600
outreach.

12:33.600 --> 12:37.720
I don't think Plex just fell out of the cloud into a Snap.

12:37.720 --> 12:43.720
And in fact, I was physically there when the Plex folks met the Snap team because it was

12:43.720 --> 12:45.400
at an event in Seattle.

12:45.400 --> 12:47.440
I had a great conversation with this individual.

12:47.440 --> 12:50.800
I learned that they are shipping Plex on Linux based systems.

12:50.800 --> 12:57.000
I had no idea because of the embedded market and all kinds of weird architectural issues

12:57.000 --> 12:58.860
and packaging issues.

12:58.860 --> 13:00.440
And Snap really solves that problem for them.

13:00.440 --> 13:04.880
So it's lucky for us that we get to run it on desktop Linux, but it solves something

13:04.880 --> 13:08.920
like, and this is just from our private conversation that, so these are just my guesses and I'm

13:08.920 --> 13:13.360
changing the names to protect the innocent, but something like 15 different types of packages

13:13.360 --> 13:14.560
that they create.

13:14.560 --> 13:18.660
And they have a very, very complicated series of scripts that generate each one of those

13:18.660 --> 13:20.560
individual packages.

13:20.560 --> 13:27.120
And it took a corporate meeting where Canonical sponsored a sprint event and invited local

13:27.120 --> 13:28.120
partners to come.

13:28.120 --> 13:33.040
And it took a face-to-face where they started talking about the problems at Plex of targeting

13:33.040 --> 13:37.620
these 15 different types of packaging formats and how the Windows and Mac guys have to laugh

13:37.620 --> 13:41.560
over the fence as I'm sitting there creating a new script to target the next NAS that shipped

13:41.560 --> 13:42.640
this week.

13:42.640 --> 13:47.360
When the Canonical team could hear that particular need, they were able to begin a conversation

13:47.360 --> 13:50.840
saying, well, you know, Snaps can actually solve that problem and we could add the support

13:50.840 --> 13:53.600
for these architecture requirements that you have.

13:53.600 --> 13:54.600
And we could just put that upstream.

13:54.600 --> 13:59.080
Although it does go to show that these things take time because that sprint was months ago,

13:59.080 --> 14:00.080
wasn't it?

14:00.080 --> 14:01.080
Beginning of the year.

14:01.080 --> 14:02.080
Yeah.

14:02.080 --> 14:03.080
Yeah.

14:03.080 --> 14:05.240
We've only had this Plex Snap this week.

14:05.240 --> 14:08.400
And so it's not trivial for some of these applications.

14:08.400 --> 14:10.480
This is what Red Hat's got to start doing though.

14:10.480 --> 14:15.320
They've got to start making these relationships and the end users are the ones that suffer

14:15.320 --> 14:16.720
if the packages don't get updated.

14:16.720 --> 14:20.580
Now there also could be, you know, developer awareness that could be raised, but these

14:20.580 --> 14:23.380
core issues are nothing new.

14:23.380 --> 14:25.560
They happen on the Mac in DMG files.

14:25.560 --> 14:27.920
They've happened in Debian repositories before.

14:27.920 --> 14:29.640
They happen on Windows machines all the time.

14:29.640 --> 14:33.000
You install something with the install wizard and it blasts a whole bunch of old DLLs on

14:33.000 --> 14:34.240
your box.

14:34.240 --> 14:37.280
This is a common problem.

14:37.280 --> 14:40.080
And if it's not solved at the source, we're generally playing catch up.

14:40.080 --> 14:43.720
Well, you mentioned a fork at the top of the show and you were talking about Redis and

14:43.720 --> 14:49.360
specifically some modules that have been forked, but who has forked them is pretty interesting.

14:49.360 --> 14:54.880
You won't be too surprised when I say it's the Debian Linux project leader and the Fedora

14:54.880 --> 14:55.880
developer.

14:55.880 --> 15:00.120
So this is Chris Lam and Nathan Scott, and they're concerned that these changes to the

15:00.120 --> 15:05.320
Redis modules are going to make it so that they can't distribute Redis in Fedora or Debian.

15:05.320 --> 15:09.100
They write with recent licensing changes to several Redis Labs modules, making them no

15:09.100 --> 15:14.440
longer free and open source, GNU slash Linux distributions such as Debian and Fedora are

15:14.440 --> 15:20.120
no longer able to ship Redis Labs versions of the affected modules to their users.

15:20.120 --> 15:25.600
As a result, we have begun working together to create a set of module repositories forked

15:25.600 --> 15:28.760
from the code prior to the license change.

15:28.760 --> 15:34.120
We will maintain changes to these modules under their original open source licenses,

15:34.120 --> 15:37.800
applying only free and open fixes and updates.

15:37.800 --> 15:44.000
Now it is worth noting that these modules have not become proprietary, completely proprietary.

15:44.000 --> 15:46.320
It's a little bit more nuanced than that.

15:46.320 --> 15:50.960
What has happened is Redis have decided that they don't want people to take their code

15:50.960 --> 15:57.160
and make money from it, so they've added what they call the commons clause, which basically

15:57.160 --> 16:00.960
just says you can do whatever you want, you can have all the usual freedoms of free and

16:00.960 --> 16:04.000
open source software, but you just can't make money from it.

16:04.000 --> 16:08.520
Yeah, which if you think about all those Debian or Fedora installs that are up in maybe like

16:08.520 --> 16:13.220
a web server instance or even used inside a company as a database server so that way

16:13.220 --> 16:18.320
they can work on things and make a profit, it is not only a non-starter for those work

16:18.320 --> 16:22.320
cases, but it's restricting the freedom of the application.

16:22.320 --> 16:29.440
And this really seems targeted at companies like AWS, which were trying to build services

16:29.440 --> 16:33.000
around some of this software and then charge handsome fees.

16:33.000 --> 16:35.800
And I think Redis looked at that and thought, wait a minute, we should be the ones, we should

16:35.800 --> 16:36.800
be the ones making that money.

16:36.800 --> 16:38.380
That's our software.

16:38.380 --> 16:40.160
That's my, that's my into it of it.

16:40.160 --> 16:41.520
I don't know if that's true or not.

16:41.520 --> 16:45.220
Yeah, but that's not how free and open source software works.

16:45.220 --> 16:48.360
The license is no longer OSI compliant.

16:48.360 --> 16:52.960
And that means that distros like Debian and Fedora just can't distribute it anymore.

16:52.960 --> 16:57.120
This could have larger upstream ramifications on Ubuntu cloud servers as well.

16:57.120 --> 17:00.840
Well, thanks to these forks, hopefully that is going to solve the problem.

17:00.840 --> 17:02.240
Yeah, you're probably right.

17:02.240 --> 17:07.880
And I'm interested to see the results of the Debian project leader, Chris Lam, and the

17:07.880 --> 17:10.760
Fedora contributor, Nathan Scott, working together.

17:10.760 --> 17:14.160
That seems like maybe that could produce other interesting results down the road.

17:14.160 --> 17:15.960
Yeah, that is good to see them working together.

17:15.960 --> 17:21.680
And something else that's good to see, I think, is Microsoft joining the Open Invention Network,

17:21.680 --> 17:23.460
the biggest news of the week.

17:23.460 --> 17:24.460
No doubt about it.

17:24.460 --> 17:25.460
I think there's no think about it either.

17:25.460 --> 17:28.360
I think this is absolutely good news.

17:28.360 --> 17:32.380
Microsoft writes that they know their decision to join the OIN may be viewed as surprising

17:32.380 --> 17:33.380
to some.

17:33.380 --> 17:34.380
Just a bit.

17:34.380 --> 17:35.380
Yeah.

17:35.380 --> 17:36.440
Let's just take a moment and soak that one.

17:36.440 --> 17:40.480
And they say it's no secret that there's been friction in the past between Microsoft and

17:40.480 --> 17:44.080
the open source community over the issue of patents.

17:44.080 --> 17:47.480
For others who have followed our evolution, we hope this announcement will be viewed as

17:47.480 --> 17:51.920
the next logical step for a company that is listening to customers and developers and

17:51.920 --> 17:55.860
firmly committed to Linux and other open source programs.

17:55.860 --> 18:01.080
That is a remarkable statement by Microsoft, and this is undoubtedly a good contribution.

18:01.080 --> 18:05.120
I think for context, it would be good to keep track of what this is and isn't.

18:05.120 --> 18:10.120
The Open Innovation Network now has about 2,600 members, and Microsoft is the biggest

18:10.120 --> 18:13.040
fish in the pond when it comes to patents that they've contributed.

18:13.040 --> 18:15.160
It's a huge win for them.

18:15.160 --> 18:21.120
In a bit of an irony, OIN was launched in 2005 as a company that was going to protect

18:21.120 --> 18:25.560
development around Linux from companies like Microsoft, SCO, and others.

18:25.560 --> 18:29.360
So there's, I think, a bit of an irony to this that they're joining a group that may

18:29.360 --> 18:32.840
in part have started as a defense to Microsoft.

18:32.840 --> 18:39.560
So this decision means that by joining OIN, Microsoft agrees not to use any of its 60,000

18:39.560 --> 18:45.960
patents against other OIN participants for their use or distribution of the, quote, Linux

18:45.960 --> 18:50.460
system technologies, which is defined by the OIN as a specific thing.

18:50.460 --> 18:56.040
It's a set of libraries, Kubernetes is in there, part of Chromium is in there.

18:56.040 --> 19:00.540
So there's several core technologies in there that are in this Linux system definition that

19:00.540 --> 19:03.520
is now protected by all members of the Open Innovation Network.

19:03.520 --> 19:07.520
And then just kind of lastly here, the other thing to probably understand about this decision

19:07.520 --> 19:14.680
is Microsoft's participation in the OIN does not limit Microsoft's ability to assert its

19:14.680 --> 19:18.720
patents against non-OIN participants.

19:18.720 --> 19:24.320
So that means people outside the Open Innovation Network are not necessarily protected by this.

19:24.320 --> 19:29.440
Although it would be bad form and probably not go well in their new club here, it is

19:29.440 --> 19:34.960
by the letter of the law legal, even if they're using something that's in this Linux system

19:34.960 --> 19:36.680
definition.

19:36.680 --> 19:39.940
If they're not in the OIN network, Microsoft could still go after them.

19:39.940 --> 19:43.200
So it doesn't necessarily mean they're going to stop going after certain Android manufacturers

19:43.200 --> 19:44.200
for ex-fat patents.

19:44.200 --> 19:49.400
Well, Android was the first word that came to my mind when I read about this.

19:49.400 --> 19:52.020
Microsoft make an awful lot of money from Android.

19:52.020 --> 19:58.280
So by doing this, if they really are going to stop making money from Android like this,

19:58.280 --> 20:03.800
then they're cutting off a massive revenue source, which seems pretty unlikely to me.

20:03.800 --> 20:08.620
And the Free Software Foundation made a statement about Microsoft joining the OIN.

20:08.620 --> 20:10.680
And that was the first thing that they want to know.

20:10.680 --> 20:16.200
They want Microsoft to make a clear, unambiguous statement that it has ceased all patent infringement

20:16.200 --> 20:20.180
claims on the use of Linux and Android.

20:20.180 --> 20:26.120
And that's why I was sort of slightly questioning whether this is good news or not, because

20:26.120 --> 20:29.120
they technically don't have to do that, do they?

20:29.120 --> 20:33.960
As you said, I think it would be a bad look for them if they didn't do it.

20:33.960 --> 20:37.480
But it just seems almost impossible that they could do that, because there's so much revenue

20:37.480 --> 20:38.480
coming in from Android.

20:38.480 --> 20:41.400
I have a couple of thoughts on that.

20:41.400 --> 20:47.200
This doesn't really, I think, detract from how good of news this is, because an argument

20:47.200 --> 20:51.280
could be made that that is Microsoft's legitimate intellectual properties, and these Android

20:51.280 --> 20:54.800
manufacturers took a shortcut, and they used something that they should have checked.

20:54.800 --> 20:57.300
Their legal department should have checked for that.

20:57.300 --> 21:00.200
And it's not really Microsoft's fault that they decided to use exFAT, so that way they

21:00.200 --> 21:03.600
could make it really easy to copy files to a Windows box.

21:03.600 --> 21:07.000
So there may be an argument to say they're justified in charging those manufacturers.

21:07.000 --> 21:11.440
It is probably one of their biggest PR issues with the open source community.

21:11.440 --> 21:17.280
But this is, overall, undoubtedly good news, because it means that the technologies that

21:17.280 --> 21:19.900
are included in this are now going to be essentially safe.

21:19.900 --> 21:25.520
It would be a futile effort to go after some small shop that uses anything in this Linux

21:25.520 --> 21:27.800
system definition now.

21:27.800 --> 21:31.920
And likely any company that's of any reasonable size would have connections to members in

21:31.920 --> 21:33.280
the OIN.

21:33.280 --> 21:37.520
And undoubtedly, on top of that, membership of the Open Innovation Network is going to

21:37.520 --> 21:38.520
skyrocket now.

21:38.520 --> 21:44.000
Now that Microsoft's 60,000 patents are in there, it's worth it, and it's free to join.

21:44.000 --> 21:45.840
So there's really no downside for a lot of companies.

21:45.840 --> 21:48.520
I imagine that 2600 number is going to get a lot higher.

21:48.520 --> 21:49.760
Oh, yeah.

21:49.760 --> 21:54.640
But something else that the FSF points out is that Microsoft could completely withdraw

21:54.640 --> 22:00.780
from the Open Innovation Network with only 30 days notice, which, again, seems unlikely

22:00.780 --> 22:04.160
and would be a terrible look for them, PR-wise.

22:04.160 --> 22:06.480
But it is possible it could happen.

22:06.480 --> 22:10.400
I do follow the Free Software Foundation's core point there, but I kind of feel like

22:10.400 --> 22:14.840
they're playing this patent revenue thing up as the anti-Microsoft angle here.

22:14.840 --> 22:20.200
I think all of the hype around how much money Microsoft makes off of Android came off of

22:20.200 --> 22:27.120
an article that came out March 5, 2014, and the headline was, Microsoft makes $5 to $15

22:27.120 --> 22:28.720
from every Android device sold.

22:28.720 --> 22:34.720
And that exploded, and the estimation was that they likely make $2 billion per year

22:34.720 --> 22:35.720
from Android.

22:35.720 --> 22:37.280
And this is back in 2014.

22:37.280 --> 22:41.880
I think the logical error that people are making is to assume that that revenue has

22:41.880 --> 22:43.060
increased.

22:43.060 --> 22:46.880
There was additional follow-up stories in 2016 and 2017.

22:46.880 --> 22:50.900
I haven't seen much about it recently that actually talked about Microsoft's earning

22:50.900 --> 22:56.320
reports being slightly down in some cases because they weren't making as much from patent

22:56.320 --> 22:57.320
licensing.

22:57.320 --> 23:03.400
In 2016, revenue from Android patent licensing was down 26% from a year ago.

23:03.400 --> 23:08.040
So really, for all we know, the revenue may have already been on the decline as Android

23:08.040 --> 23:12.840
manufacturers updated their handsets with software that didn't use the patented technology.

23:12.840 --> 23:16.980
Well, that would explain it, wouldn't it, that if they're not making that much revenue

23:16.980 --> 23:22.040
and that revenue is declining, then it's not as big of a deal as it would have been several

23:22.040 --> 23:23.040
years ago.

23:23.040 --> 23:27.120
Yeah, I mean, let's just say for sake of argument, it's $900 million or it's a billion dollars.

23:27.120 --> 23:33.440
Is it worth Microsoft's time and effort and energy to spend a billion dollars investing

23:33.440 --> 23:36.440
in developers to use Azure?

23:36.440 --> 23:37.440
I think it might be.

23:37.440 --> 23:42.120
I think since Azure is really the future of the company, spending some money on patent

23:42.120 --> 23:48.640
revenue to encourage developers to use the core technologies that power Azure is a win

23:48.640 --> 23:49.640
for them.

23:49.640 --> 23:53.600
Well, they must have obviously done the maths and the accountants probably agree with you.

23:53.600 --> 23:58.280
We'll have to watch and see if anything is stated though about that Android patent revenue

23:58.280 --> 24:01.180
because that's really the sticking point for a lot of people.

24:01.180 --> 24:04.000
The Software Freedom Conservancy came out and made the same concern too.

24:04.000 --> 24:06.800
They had essentially a similar point.

24:06.800 --> 24:09.620
We may see Microsoft make an official statement.

24:09.620 --> 24:13.620
Either way, I think people shouldn't get hung up on that one particular thing.

24:13.620 --> 24:18.100
What lawyers figure out in the back rooms of really boring buildings is really of no

24:18.100 --> 24:22.780
concern to us because the practical matter is 60,000 really important patents are now

24:22.780 --> 24:27.720
available to a network that is specifically set up to protect Linux and some of the core

24:27.720 --> 24:30.160
technologies around it from patent trolls.

24:30.160 --> 24:31.160
That's massive.

24:31.160 --> 24:32.160
Yeah, you're right.

24:32.160 --> 24:35.800
Even if it turns out that they are going to continue to make money off Android, it's still

24:35.800 --> 24:37.480
ultimately good news.

24:37.480 --> 24:41.820
They're scrambling busy over there, but I have reached out to a couple of contacts at

24:41.820 --> 24:45.520
Microsoft and I invited them to come on Linux Unplugged to talk to us more to answer some

24:45.520 --> 24:46.520
of this stuff.

24:46.520 --> 24:50.440
I don't know if they can because they're traveling and whatnot, but we may have somebody on Linux

24:50.440 --> 24:51.440
Unplugged to talk about it.

24:51.440 --> 24:52.960
I look forward to that.

24:52.960 --> 24:53.960
All right.

24:53.960 --> 24:57.240
Well, let's end with some Google news.

24:57.240 --> 25:03.240
They had their event this week announcing the new phones and some boring stuff, but

25:03.240 --> 25:08.880
what jumped out at me was the Pixel Slate, which is the first Chrome OS tablet.

25:08.880 --> 25:12.720
You know, at first I didn't get it because I watched the thing live and I'm like, um,

25:12.720 --> 25:14.760
so they've totally reskinned Chrome OS.

25:14.760 --> 25:20.080
It looks like a totally different OS with a, um, it looks a lot like Plasma actually

25:20.080 --> 25:21.720
now that I'm looking at the pictures.

25:21.720 --> 25:22.720
Holy crap.

25:22.720 --> 25:25.200
Uh, and it's called the Slate Joe, not a tablet.

25:25.200 --> 25:26.960
Don't, don't get that confused.

25:26.960 --> 25:31.880
They say the biggest feature of this really is a full desktop web browser on a tablet.

25:31.880 --> 25:36.040
That's I think what they've built this thing around, eighth gen Intel processor.

25:36.040 --> 25:40.960
It can go up to an i7 with 16 gigs of RAM and 256 gigs of storage.

25:40.960 --> 25:46.520
It's got a 12.3 inch touch screen that Google says is faster and more efficient than traditional

25:46.520 --> 25:47.520
LCDs.

25:47.520 --> 25:52.000
It also includes, which is kind of a neat addition, a fingerprint sensor, which is built

25:52.000 --> 25:53.120
into the power button.

25:53.120 --> 25:56.780
This is a first for Chromebooks and kind of an interesting way to do it without having

25:56.780 --> 25:58.600
like a traditional button down the front.

25:58.600 --> 26:04.460
Oh, and that screen, that 12.3 inch screen is 3000 by 2000 resolution, which is an interesting

26:04.460 --> 26:05.800
aspect ratio.

26:05.800 --> 26:11.440
And the thing weighs 1.6 pounds and the hands-on reviewers have all said it's really well balanced.

26:11.440 --> 26:14.320
You can hold it with one finger in the middle and it stays there.

26:14.320 --> 26:16.140
It's beautifully balanced.

26:16.140 --> 26:20.240
This is clearly going after the iPad Pro market because it's that kind of size, isn't it?

26:20.240 --> 26:24.800
It's a huge tablet and don't call it a tablet, whatever.

26:24.800 --> 26:26.820
And it's all about productivity.

26:26.820 --> 26:28.920
It's not a media consumption device.

26:28.920 --> 26:36.440
It's supposed to be almost like a laptop replacement, but I don't know, don't Apple have that market

26:36.440 --> 26:38.520
sewn up already?

26:38.520 --> 26:43.440
Isn't this kind of going after a market that is just not going to go for it?

26:43.440 --> 26:47.000
Because to get the powerful one is very expensive here.

26:47.000 --> 26:48.480
Yeah, but so is the iPad Pro.

26:48.480 --> 26:54.200
You get the big iPad Pro with the full storage and LTE and you're paying these prices easy.

26:54.200 --> 27:00.280
I think, you know, funny, I first didn't get this device, but now it's actually on my consideration

27:00.280 --> 27:04.040
list and it's up against the iPad Pro.

27:04.040 --> 27:09.080
I've kind of just, I've soured on running a dozen Electron apps to do all of my work

27:09.080 --> 27:10.080
communication.

27:10.080 --> 27:15.240
You know, I have mail spring running, I have Slack running, I have all kinds of like esoteric

27:15.240 --> 27:20.800
messaging apps that are all available as apps on the iOS app store that I think would just

27:20.800 --> 27:24.800
be better running on a tablet than running on my Linux box and just free my Linux box

27:24.800 --> 27:25.800
of some of those tasks.

27:25.800 --> 27:27.840
And some of the mail clients are fantastic.

27:27.840 --> 27:32.040
So kind of been thinking, yeah, maybe I get an iPad and do my communication on that instead

27:32.040 --> 27:33.040
of the laptop.

27:33.040 --> 27:34.520
Didn't love the idea though.

27:34.520 --> 27:38.280
Then this thing comes around, it's in that iPad Pro price range.

27:38.280 --> 27:43.120
And if you're in the Google suite, so you work for a company that's all in on G apps,

27:43.120 --> 27:44.960
this might be a better device to use.

27:44.960 --> 27:45.960
Yeah.

27:45.960 --> 27:50.160
And don't forget of course that you can run Android apps to some extent and you can run

27:50.160 --> 27:52.400
Linux apps to some extent.

27:52.400 --> 27:55.080
So it's kind of an attractive proposition.

27:55.080 --> 27:57.100
What would potentially sell me on this?

27:57.100 --> 28:01.200
First of all, it'd have to be significantly less expensive, but also if you could run

28:01.200 --> 28:06.160
proper GNU slash Linux on it, if you could hack it and there's no indication yet whether

28:06.160 --> 28:08.000
that is going to be possible.

28:08.000 --> 28:10.400
What about that new Chrome OS feature just to run Linux apps?

28:10.400 --> 28:11.560
Is that good enough?

28:11.560 --> 28:12.560
Not for me.

28:12.560 --> 28:17.680
I mean, that is attractive, but I'd like to be able to install Xubuntu on it.

28:17.680 --> 28:19.800
It's the bottom line and use it.

28:19.800 --> 28:21.800
Of course you would.

28:21.800 --> 28:23.600
On that screen, Joe.

28:23.600 --> 28:24.600
You masochist.

28:24.600 --> 28:26.080
I don't know.

28:26.080 --> 28:29.920
Maybe plasma or something instead, but you know, proper GNU slash Linux rather than Chrome

28:29.920 --> 28:31.200
OS.

28:31.200 --> 28:34.960
And okay, Chrome OS has now grown to a point where it's not just a web browser like it

28:34.960 --> 28:39.920
was before, but it's still quite limited, even with Android app support, even with the

28:39.920 --> 28:41.560
next app support.

28:41.560 --> 28:45.160
It's not a proper Linux system, is it, as we know it.

28:45.160 --> 28:49.480
And the specs of this, you know, if you've got an i7 with 16 gigs of RAM, there's absolutely

28:49.480 --> 28:56.000
no reason why you couldn't run a plasma desktop on there or GNOME or anything and have a proper

28:56.000 --> 28:57.580
experience.

28:57.580 --> 29:01.640
And I think GNOME would actually be far more suited to it because it's kind of touch centric

29:01.640 --> 29:06.480
and GNOME is really good with touch input, but it does need a fair bit of grunt in terms

29:06.480 --> 29:07.480
of resources.

29:07.480 --> 29:13.640
I mean, I've got a really old Windows 8 tablet that I installed Linux on just to see if I

29:13.640 --> 29:14.640
could do it.

29:14.640 --> 29:18.520
And GNOME works really well in terms of the touch and the keyboard comes up and everything,

29:18.520 --> 29:23.480
but that tablet is just not powerful enough to run it, whereas this Pixel Slate, I think,

29:23.480 --> 29:24.960
would be well powerful enough.

29:24.960 --> 29:25.960
Oh, for sure.

29:25.960 --> 29:27.280
Yeah, I think so.

29:27.280 --> 29:29.560
Yeah, there's a couple of red flags for me.

29:29.560 --> 29:34.600
The price is a little higher than I'm comfortable with a Chrome device, especially one that

29:34.600 --> 29:37.000
is essentially a first gen.

29:37.000 --> 29:39.280
This has a new UI on top of it.

29:39.280 --> 29:43.880
And when I watched several of the hands on videos, in a couple of them, the UI is laggy

29:43.880 --> 29:47.180
as they're like doing the screen splitting and moving apps around.

29:47.180 --> 29:50.440
It actually is a little laggy and that's a little concerning for a device that could

29:50.440 --> 29:51.440
be up to nearly $1,600.

29:51.440 --> 29:55.840
The other thing to understand is the keyboard is sold separately for $200.

29:55.840 --> 29:58.640
And then if you want to get the fancy pen, that's another $100.

29:58.640 --> 30:04.000
So you're way in on cost here and it's a brand new take on this.

30:04.000 --> 30:09.340
It does really seem, though, from what a lot of reviewers have said, that Google has internalized

30:09.340 --> 30:13.800
a lot of the lessons of the Pixel phones and they've brought that to the tablet and they've

30:13.800 --> 30:17.040
made hardware-wise a very great device.

30:17.040 --> 30:21.020
So some of that stuff could get cleaned up with software updates, which are pretty smooth

30:21.020 --> 30:22.960
on Chrome devices.

30:22.960 --> 30:27.200
But the thing I'm surprised you haven't mentioned yet is they dropped the headphone jack.

30:27.200 --> 30:30.040
Oh yeah, of course.

30:30.040 --> 30:32.520
Did you catch their rationalization?

30:32.520 --> 30:37.160
It hasn't been printed a lot, but the rationalization goes like this.

30:37.160 --> 30:45.840
Mobile phones have removed the headphone jack, which has created a robust Bluetooth ecosystem.

30:45.840 --> 30:52.280
So that made it easy for them to remove the headphone port from the tablet because users

30:52.280 --> 30:57.480
have already bought all these Bluetooth accessories as a result of these mobile phone changes.

30:57.480 --> 31:01.080
As someone who uses Bluetooth every day, I can tell you this.

31:01.080 --> 31:06.720
Bluetooth is terrible and removing the headphone jack is the worst thing that's happened to

31:06.720 --> 31:10.800
tech for as long as I can remember.

31:10.800 --> 31:16.680
Even Samsung now are looking at removing it and so it seems that it's just going away.

31:16.680 --> 31:18.600
Within a couple of years, we're not going to have it anymore.

31:18.600 --> 31:24.080
And I've ranted about this many times on various different shows, but the ability to be able

31:24.080 --> 31:30.560
to have my Bluetooth device die battery wise and then just unplug my headphones, plug them

31:30.560 --> 31:35.560
into the phone or the laptop or whatever, it's just invaluable.

31:35.560 --> 31:40.400
And Bluetooth, okay, Bluetooth can get better or whatever, but just there's nothing quite

31:40.400 --> 31:42.520
like plugging in a headphone jack is there.

31:42.520 --> 31:44.240
I do miss it from time to time.

31:44.240 --> 31:48.920
I do adapt over time, but I thought it was interesting to see them make this transition

31:48.920 --> 31:53.400
on a tablet level because this is doing a little bit more of a desktop role where there's

31:53.400 --> 31:56.760
a lot of other reasons to have a headphone jack, including just trying to be polite when

31:56.760 --> 32:00.840
you're in a workspace and you're listening or watching something.

32:00.840 --> 32:02.960
I think it's one to watch.

32:02.960 --> 32:07.880
I don't know if it's one to buy yet, but I was surprised at how close they got.

32:07.880 --> 32:12.640
Once I put myself in the head of a G Suite user who's perhaps using several of the Google

32:12.640 --> 32:16.840
apps for work every day, I could actually see this thing being pretty useful and it

32:16.840 --> 32:22.400
would be handy to have a desktop grade web browser on a tablet.

32:22.400 --> 32:27.120
And I think Google needed to make this because the iPad Pro is eating up this market from

32:27.120 --> 32:31.880
one end and the Microsoft Surface line is eating up the other end, the higher end.

32:31.880 --> 32:33.760
So Google needed to respond to this.

32:33.760 --> 32:38.880
And also I think one last note, just interesting that this isn't running Android, it's running

32:38.880 --> 32:43.800
Chrome OS and when Google was asked about that, their response was, this is where we're

32:43.800 --> 32:44.960
investing now.

32:44.960 --> 32:48.360
As in, we're done making Android tablets.

32:48.360 --> 32:53.760
Well official prediction, this is not going to sell well and the other side of Christmas,

32:53.760 --> 32:57.920
say by Easter, you'll be able to pick these up for half the price that they are now.

32:57.920 --> 33:01.760
Yeah, I do wonder if maybe third parties could make a little bit cheaper units, but it depends

33:01.760 --> 33:02.760
on the hardware.

33:02.760 --> 33:05.800
You put nice components in there, put a good screen on there, the cost is going to go up.

33:05.800 --> 33:12.200
It is intriguing though to see this massive deployment of what is essentially desktop

33:12.200 --> 33:17.300
Linux to that quote unquote new user market that we always talk about.

33:17.300 --> 33:18.300
This is it.

33:18.300 --> 33:21.760
This is the front line of end users and they're running Linux with these machines.

33:21.760 --> 33:25.040
And now they've made one that's a business machine.

33:25.040 --> 33:29.960
It might not have been the desktop Linux that we all thought we would see in the 90s, but

33:29.960 --> 33:34.360
we are watching something pretty significant roll out here on some pretty fancy hardware.

33:34.360 --> 33:39.520
If you say a massive deployment, well that's what Google wants, but I can't say I'm afraid.

33:39.520 --> 33:42.720
Maybe not of this particular device, but of Chrome OS in general, I think they've achieved

33:42.720 --> 33:43.720
it.

33:43.720 --> 33:44.720
Yeah, true.

33:44.720 --> 33:45.720
True.

33:45.720 --> 33:46.720
Well, you guys know the drill.

33:46.720 --> 33:50.160
