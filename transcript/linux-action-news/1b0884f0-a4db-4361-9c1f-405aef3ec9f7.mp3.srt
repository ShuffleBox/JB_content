00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,080
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, our weekly take on Linux and the open source world.

2
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:19,680
This is episode 43, recorded on March 4th, 2018.

3
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:20,680
I'm Chris.

4
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:21,680
And I'm Joe.

5
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:22,680
Hello, Joe.

6
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:26,920
It's good to be connected with you one last time before I head out to Scale 16x.

7
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:32,400
And we start with some news that is decidedly retro for me, but it has lots of possibilities.

8
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:37,960
Yes, Yolo have announced Sailfish 3, the next generation of the independent mobile operating

9
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:38,960
system.

10
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:42,000
And they sure use the word independent a lot in this announcement, don't they?

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,160
They're very keen to stress that they are an alternative to Android and iOS.

12
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:48,020
Yeah, independent jumps out a lot.

13
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:50,600
There's another phrase that I thought was kind of funny.

14
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:55,040
Regional licensing jumps out a few times, and it's all over their video as well.

15
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:59,040
Those are two phrases I also heard come out of the lips of Mark Shuttleworth.

16
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:05,140
He said that that was one of Canonical's primary advantages against Google and Apple and Samsung.

17
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:09,260
They were independent, but yet still a business you could depend on to create a good product

18
00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:11,960
and establish a business relationship with.

19
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:15,120
And that was one of their propositions.

20
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:17,400
Sounds like that's the same proposition Yolo is trying to make.

21
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:22,000
Yeah, and speaking of regional, there are some regions where smartphones are not really

22
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
affordable.

23
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:28,200
But now, Yolo want to go after the feature phone market with Sailfish 3, which is kind

24
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:29,560
of a pivot for them, isn't it?

25
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:30,860
Yeah, I mentioned retro.

26
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:31,920
This is what I was talking about.

27
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:34,640
I'm actually really looking forward to seeing where this goes.

28
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:38,720
These feature phones are pretty popular in developing nations, but I think they're also

29
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:41,640
making a resurgence in Western nations.

30
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:44,840
And the version of Sailfish that's coming to these feature phones will come pre-installed

31
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:49,520
with some core Sailfish applications, including Facebook.

32
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:50,520
And more will be coming.

33
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:54,920
As well as some open source ones and an app store where users can download a few select

34
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:58,600
Android apps, depending on the capabilities of the feature phone.

35
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:03,400
This version will also be compatible with non-touchscreen phones and numerical keypads,

36
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:09,000
like a small, tiny phone with a week of battery running a free operating system.

37
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:15,240
Now, Sailfish 3 is going to roll out in stages sometime in Q3 of 2018, first landing on the

38
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:16,240
Sony Xperia XA2.

39
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:21,880
Yeah, there are a few new devices, including the Gemini PDA, which was supposed to be dual

40
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:26,880
booting Linux and Android, but now with Sailfish as an extra option on there, suddenly I'm

41
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:28,360
wishing I'd back that project.

42
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:32,080
Yeah, also a forthcoming tablet out of Russia is going to be running Sailfish.

43
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:34,440
I don't know much about it, but could be interesting.

44
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:39,360
Yeah, just when we thought they were dead or dying, it looks like they're making a comeback.

45
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:43,100
But I don't know how much faith I have in them as a company, really, because they've

46
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:48,840
been really up and down, haven't they, and mostly down, to be fair, with failed deliveries

47
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:51,520
of the tablet.

48
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:56,240
They've got this new licensing model, and they are very keen to stress it, as you said,

49
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:58,480
so maybe there is hope for them.

50
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:03,880
I don't think that in the West it's going to be a huge competitor to iOS and Android,

51
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:09,600
but I think that perhaps it will find its niche in developing countries, and maybe in

52
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:15,040
feature phones in the West, but I'm not convinced that there's as much demand for those as people

53
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:16,780
like to think.

54
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:21,520
You had that Nokia 3310 reboot last year, now you've got the banana phone from the Matrix

55
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:22,760
coming back.

56
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:26,320
I think that there's a lot of people who think they would be interested in that and may in

57
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:33,560
fact buy one, but come on, a week with that or even a day with that, you're going to be

58
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:37,520
wanting your Android phone back or your iPhone pretty quickly, I think.

59
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:40,560
The pragmatist in me says, you're probably right, Joe.

60
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:44,520
I have a sense I would get a feature phone and maybe just keep it around for novelty

61
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:49,100
sake or use it when I'm looking to disconnect for a day or two, but probably wouldn't end

62
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:51,400
up my daily driver.

63
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:55,000
Now something that Google's trying to do to make Chromebooks your daily driver is allow

64
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:00,440
you to run full-fledged Linux applications potentially, at least according to some screenshots

65
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:03,960
and information we've seen leak out onto the web.

66
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:08,920
Something called Crostini, which is being billed as virtual machines, but it may just

67
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:14,680
be containers, but either way, this seems to me to be a direct competitor to the Windows

68
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:18,240
subsystem for Linux that you have on Windows 10.

69
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:22,120
It seems like Google don't want to be left behind here and they want developers to be

70
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:23,520
able to use their Chromebooks.

71
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:27,960
Yeah, now we have seen some screenshots of how this would be implemented and it's a pretty

72
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:28,960
straightforward UI.

73
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:33,040
In the case of the screenshot that's come out, it's actually installing the terminal,

74
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:37,280
which that would seem to open up a lot of possibilities, and hence the Windows subsystem

75
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:38,760
for Linux comparison.

76
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:42,720
You have different companies now taking major positions here.

77
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:47,780
You have Microsoft with the subsystem, you have Google with potentially this Crostini

78
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:51,120
or whatever it is they're calling it, and then we're going to talk about Samsung later

79
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:54,800
on in the show also positioning that for developers.

80
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:59,360
Everybody is trying to carve out an on-the-go development workstation because if anything

81
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:02,880
Dell has shown the market, you can really succeed when you target them specifically

82
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:03,880
with hardware.

83
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:09,880
Yeah, I was going to say, XPS 13 seems to me the ultimate developer on-the-go workstation,

84
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:10,880
doesn't it?

85
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:13,520
Yeah, and they seem to figure that out, what, four years ago, five years ago?

86
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:16,360
Yeah, and now the other companies seem to be catching up.

87
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:21,000
Do you think that any of these solutions really are going to compete with a full-blown Linux

88
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,240
laptop running an i7 with 16 gigs of RAM plus?

89
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,240
I don't think so.

90
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:27,120
I think the momentum is already too strong there.

91
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:31,280
I think the edge cases where you need that extra resource or you need the real machine

92
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:36,040
or you need to be running closer to production, those add up and they end up just putting

93
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:41,920
you on a full-fledged Linux desktop, but if you're traveling, you need to just do something

94
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:45,600
really quick, you need an SSH connection, you need to build something, check something

95
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:48,500
in or out, that it could work for.

96
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:50,360
It could be a supplemental tool.

97
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:55,160
Yeah, possibly, possibly, and I suppose the education factor as well because Chromebooks

98
00:05:55,160 --> 00:06:01,040
are much, much cheaper and so it makes them even more attractive to schools teaching computer

99
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:02,240
science, doesn't it?

100
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:08,160
That was my first thought, was my son has been issued a Chromebook as part of his school

101
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,160
curriculum.

102
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:12,920
They create him a Google account, he's in there using Google Docs every day, he's getting

103
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:17,400
indoctrinated just like they used to do back in the day with Microsoft and Apple, and that

104
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:22,720
would mean potentially he could start playing around in the Bash terminal, I assume it's

105
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:28,320
Bash, in the Linux terminal of some kind on his Chromebook, and I really can't find anything

106
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:29,320
wrong with that.

107
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:33,340
Yeah, it's almost like an escape hatch, isn't it, from the otherwise being completely locked

108
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:34,640
in to Google.

109
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:39,820
I like to think that maybe Google wants to give people the power to compute on these

110
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:42,120
devices that are capable of doing more.

111
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:44,320
That would sure be a nice non-evil scenario.

112
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:50,800
Well, yeah, I mean, even my really ancient C720 is well capable of running proper Linux,

113
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:55,360
you're not going to be compiling kernels really quickly or anything, but you can do pretty

114
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:59,640
much basic browsing on it, and that's only got two gigs of RAM, and now the modern Chromebooks,

115
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:04,600
not even the really fancy ones, like the Pixel or whatever, but even a standard Chromebook

116
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:09,960
that's like two, three hundred dollars, is well capable of running proper Linux applications,

117
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:14,600
so I think this was long overdue, really, adding this functionality, at least as an

118
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,160
option for people who want it.

119
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:19,520
Well, as you say, proper Linux may not be required anymore, because you're going to

120
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:24,000
be able to run applications on Chromebooks, and on the Windows side of things, when the

121
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:29,920
subsystem no longer does it for you, you'll be able to run an enhanced version of 18.04

122
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:35,400
inside a hypervisor VM, with what they say is going to be surprisingly good performance.

123
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:42,840
Yeah, Microsoft is extending their hand to us Linux users yet again, and making it really,

124
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:50,000
really easy to run Ubuntu VMs on Windows with proper mouse integration and just no hassle

125
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:55,200
whatsoever, it really feels like bad news for Linux, as far as I can see, because it's

126
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:59,280
yet another reason for people to not bother installing Ubuntu to bare metal.

127
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:02,700
Why would you, when you can have such a flawless VM experience?

128
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:05,340
So they say it's going to be three mouse clicks away.

129
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:10,780
They're testing it today on Ubuntu 16.04, but they plan to ship 18.04, and I'll tell

130
00:08:10,780 --> 00:08:11,920
you why that is.

131
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:16,440
So like Joe said, it's got mouse integration, it also has full clipboard functionality,

132
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:20,080
drive redirect icon support, but there's something even bigger.

133
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:24,760
This is where the performance really comes in, is they've baked in XRDP.

134
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:30,600
It relies on the RDP protocol, which anybody that's used RDP on Windows servers knows,

135
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:33,160
it's probably the best thing out there as far as remote desktop goes.

136
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:38,280
You can really just work on it 24-7, and they've implemented that on Linux using the open source

137
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:40,280
XRDP project.

138
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:44,560
Over on the hypervisor side, they're connecting to Hyper-V sockets, which light up all these

139
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:45,560
great features.

140
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:48,120
These sockets enable this functionality.

141
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:55,480
And on the Linux side, it's called HV underscore SOC, which is baked into Ubuntu 18.04's kernel

142
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:57,120
out of the box.

143
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:01,580
4.15 has this upstream, this HV underscore SOC.

144
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:07,480
That supplies a byte stream based communication mechanism between the host partition and the

145
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:14,720
guest VM, the Ubuntu 18.04 VM, which is sort of similar communication style to TCP, except

146
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:19,080
it's going over an optimized transport layer called the VM bus.

147
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:24,560
And they have contributed those changes, which allow XRDP to utilize these hypervisor sockets

148
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:25,560
back upstream.

149
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:30,960
So it'll probably be coming to the XRDP project, but that means they're using this Hyper-V bus

150
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:36,440
at the kernel level to communicate between the VM and the 18.04 guest to really make

151
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:37,640
the display fast.

152
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:41,360
Yeah, the script's available to test this on 16.04 now.

153
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:44,840
And then in a few months when 18.04 comes out, you're going to be able to use it in

154
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:46,300
production.

155
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:51,220
And I just have to ask myself, how much longer can I pretend to be positive about this from

156
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:55,560
a Linux point of view and a FOSS community point of view?

157
00:09:55,560 --> 00:10:01,880
Because you can say, well, it shows that Linux is serious, Microsoft has to take it seriously.

158
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:08,440
But a company that size embracing this stuff, it's like they've woken up over the last few

159
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:11,120
years and realized that they have to do that.

160
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:15,920
And they're just potentially going to trample over any market share that we could have otherwise

161
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:16,920
had.

162
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:18,160
I look at it a little bit differently.

163
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:23,200
I look at it in the same light that I look at LibreOffice and Firefox and a bunch of

164
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:27,160
really other great open source applications being available for Windows.

165
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:30,420
They made it easier for people to switch to Linux in the long run.

166
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:34,320
In my opinion, the best way to switch somebody to Linux is for the first six months to a

167
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:38,760
year, switch them to a full open source suite of applications on their Windows or Mac desktop

168
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:41,140
and let them get used to that workflow.

169
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:44,280
I think that could be happening here because at the end of the day, you're going to have

170
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:49,000
more users running Ubuntu and Linux and using GPL software.

171
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,880
They might be doing it on the Windows desktop, but it's going to be more users using open

172
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:53,880
source software.

173
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:58,820
Well, that in of itself is good, but is it going to prevent them from moving over to

174
00:10:58,820 --> 00:11:03,080
using Linux full time because it's just so easy to use the good bits of Linux, the best

175
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:05,720
bits that they need from within Windows?

176
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:07,100
Or will it whet their appetite?

177
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:09,280
I think that's the part we just have to wait and see.

178
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:14,720
Well, let's hope that you're right and that I'm wrong.

179
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,560
Linux Academy dot com slash unplugged.

180
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:20,960
Go to Linux Academy and go to the slash unplugged page to sign up for a free seven day trial

181
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:23,280
and support the Linux action news.

182
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:28,240
Linux Academy is an advanced training platform to learn more about Linux and all of the fundamental

183
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:33,160
features around it, with self-paced in-depth video courses, hands-on labs, and real human

184
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:36,720
beings that are full time instructors that are there creating content and available to

185
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:37,720
help you.

186
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:41,880
And a great feature of the Linux Academy platform is the course scheduler.

187
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:43,720
You simply log in and create a course schedule.

188
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:48,380
You can specify how many hours you have available for each day of the week, and then they will

189
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:51,220
create a training schedule to fit your availability.

190
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:56,460
And if you want, they'll also send you emails to remind you about the studies and the tests

191
00:11:56,460 --> 00:12:01,040
that you are going to be taking to accomplish that learning track or course or whatever

192
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:02,280
it is that you have set up for yourself.

193
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:06,960
They have a wide range of types of courses, like ones for getting ready for certifications

194
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:12,880
or ones to deep dive on a single topic, say, firewalling on Linux, or entire sets, like

195
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:17,220
you want to learn this industry, Android development, as an example.

196
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:19,280
It's this entire umbrella topic.

197
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:23,000
You can work with all of that within their system and find something that works for your

198
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
schedule.

199
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:30,380
LinuxAcademy.com slash unplugged.

200
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:33,260
Another week, another purism story, but don't worry.

201
00:12:33,260 --> 00:12:34,700
It's not about their phone this time.

202
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:36,440
It's about their laptops.

203
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:40,020
And so they've got this Librem line of laptops, and what makes them stand out from the various

204
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:46,980
other Linux laptop sellers is their focus on attempting at least 100% free software

205
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:51,400
and the privacy that comes along with that and the security, of course.

206
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:55,300
And so now they've announced a new feature for the laptops that run core boot, which

207
00:12:55,300 --> 00:13:00,660
makes them tamper-evident, which means that you know with 100% certainty that none of

208
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:06,320
the code has changed since you last booted it, and that it can be trusted and is 100%

209
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:07,320
secure.

210
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:11,400
Yeah, and that certainty goes all the way from the BIOS level to the kernel to the initrid

211
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:13,080
to the boot configuration.

212
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:15,040
You can verify that they haven't changed.

213
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:19,600
This is a post by Purism's chief security officer over on their blog, and he writes,

214
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:24,100
we're excited to announce that we have successfully integrated HEADS into our TPM-enabled core

215
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:25,880
boot running Librem laptops.

216
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:30,400
This integration effort began in April of 2017 with the partnership of Purism and Trammell

217
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:35,920
Hudson's HEADS project, which required hardware design changes, core boot modifications and

218
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:40,720
operating system updates to reach the point where they could have this unified stack.

219
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:43,600
And now they have a tamper-evident boot process.

220
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:48,060
If you're running PureOS and their hardware, you do have to buy their hardware to make

221
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:52,140
this work, or you can find one of the projects that HEADS supports, which there are some

222
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:54,560
ThinkPads out there, to accomplish this.

223
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:59,920
And for certain types of workloads, like government workloads and enterprise-level security workloads,

224
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:01,280
this is a really big deal.

225
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:04,960
And HEADS has a lot of advantages over all the other boot verification technologies for

226
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:05,960
Purism specifically.

227
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:10,480
It's sort of in alignment with their goals, and it seems to be really solid, open-source

228
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:11,480
free software.

229
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:15,240
Secondly, the other thing they're emphasizing in this post is that they're able to use the

230
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:20,320
TPM chip, which has been a bit of a controversy in the Linux community, to their advantage

231
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:23,320
in this particular configuration to give the user control of the keys.

232
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:30,000
I spoke to Todd, the CEO of Purism, on Late Night Linux episode 31, and he really stressed

233
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:35,320
how this is a really attractive proposition to enterprise, and that is really where they're

234
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:36,320
going with this.

235
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:40,800
You kind of think of Purism and their lead-room line of laptops as being for enthusiasts and

236
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:46,080
people who really care about freedom and wanting to run core boot and all the rest of it, but

237
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:50,320
the reality is that where they're making their money is selling to enterprise.

238
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:54,680
And all that enterprise money is kind of going back in and hopefully going to give us this

239
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:59,960
lead-room 5 phone, and hopefully going to spread this idea that we can have completely

240
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:03,480
free software running machines, be it laptops or phones.

241
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:08,480
So I've been skeptical in the past of what Purism are doing, and you certainly pay a

242
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:14,160
premium for these products, but we're starting to see some real results now from them.

243
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:16,640
So I think you have to say fair play to them, really.

244
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:22,320
I still have my skeptical pants on for the lead-room 5 effort, but the laptop line is,

245
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:28,480
I think, one of the most differentiated custom Linux-first products on the market.

246
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:33,520
First of all, I've had their early build, and now I've had their latest build line of

247
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:37,960
laptop, and there's clear, solid lines of improvement where on each iteration they made

248
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:38,960
it better.

249
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:40,960
That's a great trend line in and itself.

250
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:44,360
Now they've been making these constant efforts towards secure boot, locking that down and

251
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:48,840
giving users control, and now we have the whole stack that's verifiable.

252
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:52,000
That's a big win, again, that they're at the front line of.

253
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:57,080
Yeah, and apart from anything else, Todd and the team that he surrounded himself with are

254
00:15:57,080 --> 00:16:00,060
excellent at PR, and we need that in this space, don't we?

255
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:06,120
We need people to go out and, not evangelize, but certainly spread the word about how important

256
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:10,520
software freedom is to security and privacy, and that's exactly what they're doing.

257
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:13,760
Yeah, and to that end, it doesn't hurt that the laptops don't look too bad either.

258
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:17,160
Yeah, I wouldn't mind having one for sure, but in the meantime, when I'm using other

259
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:22,120
laptops, it looks like the mainline kernel might be getting some UEFI secure boot improvements

260
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:23,120
of its own.

261
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:27,700
Yeah, this is an effort that has been brewing for a couple of years now, and it appears

262
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:32,660
to be pushed by Red Hat, and there's calls now for it to be integrated into the Linux

263
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:36,640
Next tree, which would suggest it's going to be coming to Linux stable soon.

264
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:41,140
From a high level, once this code is upstream, administrators will be able to enable further

265
00:16:41,140 --> 00:16:46,000
restrictions that would be placed on a Linux kernel when running in a UEFI secure boot

266
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:50,440
enabled environment, like blocking access to certain kernel parameters and modules,

267
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:54,980
blocking access to areas of slash dev, which obviously that's good because you could manipulate

268
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:56,760
aspects of the system there.

269
00:16:56,760 --> 00:17:00,920
Does this mean that I have to start actually using UEFI boot and not legacy mode like I

270
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:03,080
do for all the machines that I buy?

271
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:04,360
Yeah, Joe, I guess so.

272
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:06,080
No more legacy boot for us.

273
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:10,000
Well, you'll take my legacy boot from my cold dead hands, I'm afraid.

274
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
It's so much easier, I find.

275
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,860
You're just not going to have any problems.

276
00:17:12,860 --> 00:17:17,720
But I think if you are in the enterprise space, again, this is where this is really targeted,

277
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:18,720
isn't it?

278
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:20,800
Absolutely, and I totally grok why they would want that.

279
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:23,760
And I could even understand why people that are just on their laptops working out in the

280
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:28,320
public would want something like this, and it is even good for us to have on consumer

281
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:29,320
end devices.

282
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:32,560
So I can't complain that much when you compare it to a phone.

283
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:34,520
They're not nearly as locked down as these phones are.

284
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:38,880
Yeah, and as long as legacy boot remains available, then you can boot whatever you want.

285
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:44,440
But if you're the kind of company that's using Red Hat Enterprise Linux, then I think you're

286
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:46,800
going to be very interested in this sort of thing.

287
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:51,680
Speaking of phones and running Linux, Samsung would really like you to run Linux on the

288
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:53,780
Galaxy or don't say the Galaxy.

289
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:54,780
Maybe you say Dex.

290
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:57,120
They seem to be waffling a bit on the terminology.

291
00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:01,240
Yeah, well, Dex is the hardware interface, isn't it, that you plug the phone into, and

292
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:03,920
then you plug that into your screen and mouse and keyboard and everything.

293
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:08,040
Yeah, in fact, they just announced a new update to the Dex doc at Mobile World Congress.

294
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:11,240
Yeah, they seem to be taking this stuff really seriously, and it seems like they've got the

295
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:12,920
hype train full steam ahead.

296
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:13,920
I agree.

297
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:17,120
I've been able to glean a few insights out of the hype.

298
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:21,520
Number one is this is clearly and hard positioned towards developers.

299
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:26,600
Number two is they appear to be experimenting with different UIs.

300
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:29,680
I've seen what looks like Enlightenment on there.

301
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:33,880
I've seen a Gnome-looking desktop on there that I don't think was Gnome, but it seemed

302
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:35,240
to mimic Gnome.

303
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:39,100
There's a lot of different UI elements in this one video that we have linked in the

304
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:41,560
show notes that I found to be kind of interesting.

305
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:45,720
The other thing that's neat, you put it in the Dex doc now, the new Dex doc, the phone

306
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:51,800
turns into a giant touchpad, which is kind of a neat idea, and it appears you can still

307
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:56,360
use the speakers on the phone and the microphone on the phone in the Linux session.

308
00:18:56,360 --> 00:19:03,160
The Linux session is using the Android kernel, and in some demos, it looks like when you

309
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:08,000
mouse up to the top of the screen, another menu drops down, like you might see when you're

310
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,000
in VirtualBox, and you go to the top of your VirtualBox window, and then the host menu

311
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,720
drops down.

312
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:16,720
That was some of the things I was able to glean out of this current hype batch.

313
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:19,560
Using the phone screen as a touchpad, eh?

314
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:21,680
If only someone had thought of that a few years ago.

315
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:24,440
Hang on, they did with Ubuntu phone.

316
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:26,080
That didn't do them any good, did it?

317
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:29,080
They also push Eclipse hard.

318
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:33,200
You see screenshots of GIMP, Firefox, Thunderbird, Terminal.

319
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:37,720
There's a clear, clear product push towards developers, and the message that they kind

320
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:41,440
of have buried in all of this is one that I've thought about a lot.

321
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:46,780
In my opinion, these phones haven't arrived until you can write software for the phone

322
00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:47,840
on the phone.

323
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:51,960
As long as you still have to have a PC to write Android apps and iPhone apps, they're

324
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:55,800
baby operating systems, and you still need an adult operating system to actually get

325
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:56,880
the work done.

326
00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:03,240
But Samsung is attempting to give developers a current day development environment on an

327
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:08,720
Android phone, where you could write Android apps in this environment.

328
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:10,680
That's at least a good idea.

329
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:15,620
I just don't trust, after watching this video, that Samsung's the company to pull this off.

330
00:20:15,620 --> 00:20:16,800
It's some custom environment.

331
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:22,800
They appear to have bundled like Office 365 web apps on there, and it's just sort of what

332
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:26,500
you would expect from a large corporation taking a stab into a market that they've never

333
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:28,240
tried to be in before.

334
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:31,600
You kind of see them making the same mistakes that a lot of people have made before, trying

335
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:38,240
to write their own custom UI and trying to write as much new software as possible, when

336
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:42,320
you think they should maybe be doing something more like what MaruOS is doing, where they

337
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:47,320
take the Android open source project code, they take the Debian code, they take some

338
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:53,040
container code and just mash it all together, and it remains all open source.

339
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:54,040
That's the point.

340
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:58,540
That's the good thing about open source, it's not just some idealist view.

341
00:20:58,540 --> 00:21:04,200
There are pragmatic reasons to use it, and if you just bolt together loads of existing

342
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:08,160
open source software, it makes your job far easier.

343
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:13,800
But then there's always that lack of commercial advantage argument, but if they're selling

344
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:18,600
the hardware that makes this possible, then surely that's enough for them.

345
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:22,880
But maybe I'm speculating too much, but just looking at what they've done here, I'm just

346
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:26,040
very worried there's going to be a lot of proprietary code involved.

347
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:30,080
They do seem to have the budget to invest over the long haul to make this work, assuming

348
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:34,280
this isn't just some sort of sub-branch of the Dex product line, and if the Dex product

349
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:36,480
line goes away, this whole effort goes away.

350
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:37,480
Very possible.

351
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:43,360
My thoughts are, if this was like you say, running mainline Debian, or like Debian testing,

352
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:49,880
or Ubuntu, or Fedora, it would be immediately much more compelling, and it would be much

353
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:51,680
more useful.

354
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:55,680
It may be Debian under the hood for all we know, they're not really releasing the details.

355
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:59,400
So I'd really like to call on Samsung or their Dex team, if they really want to interface

356
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:03,440
with the Linux community, give us some details so we can start discussing this, we can start

357
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:05,960
maybe even participating a bit.

358
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:07,600
Reach out and let us know.

359
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:10,360

360
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:11,500
What's running under the hood?

361
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:12,500
What's running on top?

362
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:13,560
Is that enlightenment?

363
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:16,880
Give us some details so we as a community can start discussing this.

364
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:18,440

And if I can, I'll be publishing tech talk today from the road as well.

373
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:48,560
We'll be back next Monday.

374
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:54,280
I'll be live from scale, at least from the California area with our weekly take on Linux

375
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:56,720
and the whole open source world.

376
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,200
I'm at Chris LAS.

377
00:22:58,200 --> 00:22:59,520
