00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,140
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, our weekly take on Linux and the open-source world.

2
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:20,560
This is episode 81, recorded on November 25th, 2018.

3
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:21,560
I'm Chris.

4
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:22,560
And I'm Joe.

5
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:23,560
Hello, Joe.

6
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:27,980
Good to be connected with you, and we're going to kick off this week's episode with one of

7
00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:31,840
our favorite topics to speculate about, and that's Fuchsia.

8
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:37,880
It's just, you can't resist it, especially when Huawei is testing Fuchsia on the Honor

9
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:38,880
Play.

10
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:42,520
Yeah, now this hasn't been officially announced, but people have been digging through the Fuchsia

11
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:46,760
source code, and they saw the Honor Play in there, and so people have kind of put two

12
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:52,560
and two together and realized that it looks like Google are working with Huawei again

13
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:56,280
like they did on the Nexus 6P.

14
00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:00,200
And this could maybe be the first phone, but that seems like a long shot.

15
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:04,040
It seems like maybe they just need a device to do some testing on.

16
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:05,740
Yeah, perhaps.

17
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:07,360
You could really see this going either way.

18
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:08,360
We don't know.

19
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:12,300
Google has yet to really speak publicly about Project Fuchsia.

20
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:14,440
We know it's open source.

21
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:17,280
We know it's been getting worked on for years now.

22
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:20,120
It's kind of going a slow but steady pace.

23
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:25,260
Many people speculate eventually that Fuchsia will replace Android completely.

24
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:29,040
While the operating system is still in its current state, far from finished, we know

25
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:32,280
that Huawei will possibly be the first OEM now.

26
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:38,000
That's kind of a milestone in the development of a project like this, a target device to

27
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,800
try to get working.

28
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:44,760
And from the commit logs, we know that Fuchsia is booting its specific Zycron.

29
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:45,760
What's it called, Joe?

30
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:46,760
The Zycron kernel?

31
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:47,760
Zircon.

32
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:48,760
Zircon?

33
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:49,760
Zircon.

34
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:50,760
Yeah, okay.

35
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:52,980
The Zircon kernel is actually booting on the Honor Play.

36
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:58,600
So it's either way you look at this, whether this is going to be a shipping device, it's

37
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:00,980
actually a huge milestone regardless.

38
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:03,960
And it's not a particularly high-end device, far from it, really.

39
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:04,960
It's very much mid-range.

40
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:08,520
I've just had a look now, and you can pick one up for 250 pounds in the UK.

41
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:10,400
So this is not a high-end flagship.

42
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:12,520
It looks very much like an iPhone, though, doesn't it?

43
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:15,320
It's one of those clones of the iPhone X.

44
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:18,240
Well, and it's not just the Honor Play, really.

45
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:26,240
The patch itself adds support for the high-silicon 970 system on a chip to Fuchsia's kernel.

46
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:30,800
And the Honor Play is just one of a handful of devices that use that chipset.

47
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:35,720
So there's some higher-range phones that this technically is adding support for as well.

48
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:41,360
But to me, this isn't great news, really, because Huawei have been pretty hostile to

49
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:46,040
the custom ROM community in that this year they locked down their bootloader, so you

50
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:48,400
can't really flash custom ROMs anymore.

51
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:56,520
So you'd think that with a new project like Fuchsia that they would go for a more hacker-friendly

52
00:02:56,520 --> 00:03:01,960
OEM, but maybe that sort of points towards the new direction they've been going in since

53
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:03,560
they ditched Nexus.

54
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:09,320
Oh, Joe, you have this adorable free software perspective that you just can't shake.

55
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:12,840
You got to think about this from total market domination perspective.

56
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:18,880
You see, you get everybody to eat the shit sandwich up front, and then later on everything's

57
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:19,880
great.

58
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:23,880
So for example, you want to ship the iPhone X without a headphone jack, and you don't

59
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:27,520
want that to be the number one story, you remove it in the iPhone 7.

60
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:30,040
You get everybody to eat the shit sandwich ahead of time.

61
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:33,900
This is what's been going on with these bootloaders for ages now.

62
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:38,280
First it was get the unlock codes from the website, then it was get the unlock codes

63
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:41,460
from tech support, then it was no unlock codes for you.

64
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:46,880
It's a gradual progression, so that way you have to run the OS they've blessed.

65
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:49,880
The experience, sorry, I should get that right.

66
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:54,760
The experience that they've blessed for you, Joe, and in the future it may be a Fuchsia

67
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:58,800
based experience, and they want you to understand that story, Joe.

68
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:02,520
And if you don't understand that story and that experience, then that's the wrong device

69
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:03,520
for you.

70
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:06,880
Heaven forbid you just reflash it with an operating system that works better for you

71
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:09,600
and has a great legacy application support.

72
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:13,480
Heaven forbid that, no, you need to understand their story, Joe.

73
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:18,080
Well, yeah, they're moving much more towards the Apple way of doing things where good luck

74
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:19,920
flashing a custom ROM on an iPhone.

75
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:23,600
Yeah, why do they have to do this just as I'm starting to really enjoy the Pixel?

76
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,020
Go figure, right?

77
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:27,840
But just between you and me, don't tell anybody else this.

78
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:31,640
As long as they don't touch Chrome OS, I'm pretty happy.

79
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:35,200
Chrome OS I think is the real success story for Linux.

80
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:40,240
Android has always felt like a bastardized version of Linux.

81
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:44,120
Like they took everything that's great about Linux and open source and kind of killed it

82
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:50,120
and just wrecked it and then shipped this vulnerability in a pocket to everybody that's

83
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:51,120
out there.

84
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:54,760
So now we have like a billion Android users that have zero day exploits on their phone

85
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:56,760
that are always connected to the internet.

86
00:04:56,760 --> 00:05:02,840
The tech snap broadcaster in me just cries at this security travesty, and I'm ready to

87
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:04,740
just get rid of Android.

88
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:11,000
It feels like it was a bad experiment to compete with the iOS ecosystem that never really worked.

89
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:15,880
And I like Android where it's gotten to, but I'm ready for it to be gone.

90
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:20,840
Chrome OS, however, if they replace Chrome OS with a Fuchsia kernel and a Fuchsia user

91
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:26,000
land, me and Google are going to have some words.

92
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Fair enough.

93
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,340
Well, it's all speculation really, isn't it, at this stage?

94
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:37,000
It could be like one of the many projects that Google have tried and ditched, and we

95
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,320
may actually never see it ship on devices.

96
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:43,600
It could just be a backup plan for them for all we know, but somehow I don't think that's

97
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,600
the case.

98
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:49,920
I think that we will be seeing Fuchsia devices within the next couple of years, but who knows.

99
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:50,920
Yeah.

100
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:55,080
Knowing Google, we're going to see Android devices for years.

101
00:05:55,080 --> 00:06:00,080
We just recently talked about Android getting multi-year kernel support in just the most

102
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:02,840
recent Android releases in Linux Unplugged.

103
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:07,820
They're doing work right now to make Android devices supported for years.

104
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:12,400
So they may have a multi-OS strategy here, but going back to your point about discontinued

105
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:17,440
devices, I mean, everybody loves to give Google a hard time about discontinuing services,

106
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:22,440
but this week, Valve discontinued a device that I actually thought was the future of

107
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:23,440
the company.

108
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:30,320
It's here, the Steam Link box, which they heavily discounted it and then sold the lot

109
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:31,320
of them, and that's it.

110
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:33,200
They're not making any more of them.

111
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:35,640
Heavily discounted them for a period of time.

112
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:40,960
They were selling them for $2.50.

113
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:41,960
That's remarkable.

114
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:47,520
Now, I guess I should back up here because you might not even know what the Steam Link

115
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,040
is if you're not a gamer.

116
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:55,720
The Steam Link device was this tiny, slim piece of hardware that had USB and Ethernet

117
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:57,480
and HDMI out the back.

118
00:06:57,480 --> 00:07:01,900
It was smaller than any set-top device that you might find on the market right now, even

119
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:03,960
like the Nvidia Shield or the Apple TV.

120
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:09,120
It was tiny, and it would link back to a more powerful PC.

121
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:13,520
Maybe they had the latest GPU or had a decent CPU and it had some memory, and you could

122
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:18,320
really render some graphics, and it would stream that to the Steam Link to your TV,

123
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:22,440
which would have a controller, of course, like the Steam Controller or the Xbox controller

124
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:25,480
or whatever you might like hooked up to your television.

125
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:30,960
The idea was all over your LAN with low latency and great response time, you could stream

126
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:36,960
something from a much more powerful PC, maybe even a Windows PC, heaven forbid, or right

127
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:41,200
to the Steam Link connected to your television, and you could get that console experience

128
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:42,780
regardless.

129
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:48,200
The great thing, of course, for us geeks was that the Steam Link was running Linux.

130
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,840
This was all over your LAN.

131
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:54,360
No weird internet connection latency issues or problems with streaming because it's just

132
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:55,360
on your Wi-Fi.

133
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:59,200
You get good Wi-Fi, and you've got great game streaming.

134
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:02,260
Well, this ties in with the death of the Steam boxes as well.

135
00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:06,520
It's them wrapping up the hardware business and just doing pure software now because you

136
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:09,880
can get the same functionality with an Android device, with the Android app.

137
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:13,080
I mean, I presume your Nvidia Shield can do it.

138
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:14,080
That's been Valve's answer.

139
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:17,320
Oh, we're going to solve it with the apps, but if there has been something for the Nvidia

140
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:21,080
Shield TV that is Valve-created, I haven't seen it yet.

141
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:22,960
I don't know.

142
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:25,060
The thing is, this is a dedicated system.

143
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:27,880
You have it on a dedicated input.

144
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:33,480
It's hardware versus an app, and when it comes to gaming, it does make a difference, and

145
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:38,360
I'm surprised by this because I really thought, in a way, this was sort of the future of what

146
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:40,480
Valve wanted to offer.

147
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:45,600
Microsoft is launching Xbox in the cloud, which is streaming gaming.

148
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:49,200
Google is launching streaming gaming.

149
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:54,620
Nintendo offers streaming gaming in a limited way right now with the Nintendo Classic.

150
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:59,540
It's becoming a phenomenon, and then, of course, speaking of the Nvidia Shield, there is also

151
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:03,780
the GeForce streaming service, which actually seems to be the best out of all of them in

152
00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:05,120
my testing.

153
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:13,280
All of this is streaming over the internet, though, and it is susceptible to bad latency,

154
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:20,400
routes that get slow, just average Comcast issues that strike people every single day.

155
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:25,000
It's susceptible to all of these kinds of problems that impact the internet, whereas

156
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:31,040
the Steam Link system was over the land, and it seemed like, to me, the cleverest of them

157
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:32,040
all.

158
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:37,640
You invest in one machine, which you could stick in the garage or a closet somewhere,

159
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:43,040
and you can Steam Link and stream to all of your PCs and your televisions.

160
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:47,080
It to me was the perfect system, and I thought Valve was ahead of everybody else.

161
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:51,440
While everyone else is trying to figure out how to stream video games over the internet,

162
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,440
Valve was like, well, screw that.

163
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:55,960
We'll just stream it over your land, problem solved.

164
00:09:55,960 --> 00:10:01,040
To see them back off and say, oh, well, you can do it on these Android devices, which

165
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:07,680
have random input latency issues and have random Wi-Fi issues, and you can't put it

166
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:12,440
on your television, and don't worry about not being able to hook up a controller, but

167
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:16,400
you could play it on your phone, that's good enough.

168
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:18,120
To me, I'm shocked by this.

169
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:19,960
Well, I'm not shocked.

170
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:25,120
In three years since it launched, they still didn't have a Generation 2 with Gigabit Ethernet,

171
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:28,080
which was what everyone wanted, surely.

172
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:29,080
Come on, really?

173
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:33,640
I mean, maybe, but you're talking 1080p gaming here.

174
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:39,480
I thought what you'd expect to see is once 4K really became established in the home,

175
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:43,300
Valve would just iterate on top of this thing and release a 4K version.

176
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:49,480
And it seemed like the perfect machine because it ran Linux, it was controlled by Valve,

177
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:54,800
it was tiny, it was accepting any kind of controller that you wanted to play with, and

178
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:59,060
it would stream games from a machine that ran Linux or Windows or probably even a Mac

179
00:10:59,060 --> 00:11:00,880
if there was a game that ran on a Mac.

180
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:02,560
You could do that.

181
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:10,160
And now, at best, what you're going to get is an Android layer underneath all of this,

182
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:14,920
which will add latency, add complexity, require updates.

183
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:16,440
It's not the same experience.

184
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:21,720
And so, I'm frustrated because I thought Valve was way ahead of the game here.

185
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:26,620
And also, I wasn't able to get one at $2.50, so that might be...

186
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:29,760
That's what you're really annoyed about, yeah.

187
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:34,680
What I really want to know now is how long are they going to support this from Steam?

188
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:39,120
Is it going to just drop off within a year or so, or are they going to have to support

189
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:40,120
it long term?

190
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:41,120
I think a long time, Joe.

191
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:45,880
I mean, I think if you bought it at $2.50, that may be one of the better $2.50 you've

192
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:49,760
ever spent, especially when you consider there's apps that you've probably bought at that and

193
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:52,480
then deleted.

194
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:58,880
Just going by the recent code contributions by Valve engineers, they have been working

195
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:00,320
on the streaming technology.

196
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:04,920
They've been making upstream contributions to different projects to improve compatibility

197
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:10,400
with Steam Link streaming as of three weeks ago.

198
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:13,720
So this is obviously from an application layer, something they're going to support for a long

199
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:14,720
time.

200
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:19,200
And it seems like a pretty trivial effort to continue to support this device because

201
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:24,440
you're talking an H.264 stream and then the controls and a communications channel for

202
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:25,440
all of that.

203
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:30,040
But the magic sauce is keeping that low latency, which is where a lot of the recent code contributions

204
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:31,040
have been.

205
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:38,400
They're continuing to innovate in that area and then contributing that to upstream projects.

206
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:41,480
That's not something you do when you're pulling out of a project.

207
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:42,960
Yeah, true.

208
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:45,920
Well, $2.50 is not much.

209
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:51,520
What about the $300 or so that you spent on the Atari VCS and still haven't received?

210
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:53,120
Yeah.

211
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:55,600
Less and less enthusiastic as time goes on.

212
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,780
I kind of forgot about it.

213
00:12:57,780 --> 00:13:02,400
And then when I read this, it's hard to get psyched.

214
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:05,160
I think I've kind of lost my enthusiasm.

215
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:10,880
So the Atari VCS is supposed to be a box which will offer a bunch of retro games and more

216
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:12,520
running Linux.

217
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:20,440
And now we have what are essentially raw notes from Rob Wyatt, who's working on the Atari

218
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:22,100
VCS operating system.

219
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:23,860
He's the system architect.

220
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:30,680
And these raw notes, they don't leave me super inspired, but it all kind of doesn't surprise

221
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:31,720
me either.

222
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:36,600
What is it that doesn't inspire you then, the fact that it's going to be more locked

223
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:38,360
down than you'd hoped or what?

224
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:43,880
Well, I think in part, now that some time has passed, it feels a bit like the Ubuntu

225
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:49,000
phone versus Android situation all over again.

226
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:55,680
A plucky upstart is going to come along and disrupt some entrenched market leaders.

227
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:57,080
That's not very likely.

228
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:58,080
But lockdown?

229
00:13:58,080 --> 00:13:59,860
I don't know if I agree with that.

230
00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:05,880
In fact, in their blog, in these notes, one of the notes is the VCS is all about democratizing

231
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:07,440
the game console.

232
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:09,660
They've been locked down for far too long.

233
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:13,440
The VCS can have an Atari World, which has an online store.

234
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:18,560
It's safe and secure with parental controls and the ability to launch apps that can do

235
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:21,740
all of the stuff that a modern console should.

236
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:26,680
But outside of our world, we'll support users installing their other operating systems,

237
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:32,480
the ones they like, very much like the original PlayStation 3, but without the hardware restrictions.

238
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:35,460
Famously, the PlayStation 3 had a virtualizer.

239
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:39,280
You can install Linux, but then you couldn't get to the GPU.

240
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:42,280
Their virtualizer, they say, won't have those kinds of limitations.

241
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:45,760
Yeah, but why not just give you access to all of the hardware?

242
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:50,200
Why do you need to have any virtualization at all?

243
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:51,200
It's going to be x86-based.

244
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:54,760
Why can't it just boot Linux properly?

245
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:56,120
That's what I meant by lockdown.

246
00:14:56,120 --> 00:15:00,980
I suppose that's not realistic in a console, and having at least hardware pass through

247
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:05,880
for the GPU and everything is as good as you're going to get, but it's still a little bit

248
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:07,440
disappointing to me.

249
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:11,480
Because I thought this thing was going to be more hackable.

250
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:12,740
That's kind of how I read it.

251
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:16,400
Maybe that's just wishful thinking by me, but I thought this was going to be a device

252
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:21,040
that, okay, it would have this experience that they would put on it, but it would be

253
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:24,120
completely hackable and you could just do whatever you wanted with it because it is

254
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:25,120
essentially a PC.

255
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:29,120
Yeah, I think they're trying to strike the balance between a secure environment that

256
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:36,340
they can claim to game makers or publishing companies like Netflix or Hulu.

257
00:15:36,340 --> 00:15:41,560
This is a secure environment where piracy cannot take place because everything is signed

258
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:44,000
and we've double-checked everything.

259
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:48,800
In fact, they say any OS that is installed will need its startup code modified because

260
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:55,400
our hypervisor and boot code will enter the OS directly in 64-bit protected mode, which

261
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:59,080
the current Linux boots in real mode, which is an interesting aside, but the Atari OS

262
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:03,520
is based on a modified version of the Linux kernel, and they're going to patch components

263
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:08,520
in there and build components in there that they sign to verify the integrity of it, and

264
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:09,520
then it boots up.

265
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:12,960
They can verify everything's good, then they can say, yeah, you can sell your $60 game

266
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:18,960
on our platform because we can guarantee nobody's pirated, or yeah, you can stream your multimillion

267
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:24,800
dollar movie industry production on our box because no one's going to be pirating this,

268
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:28,960
but to make everybody happy, we're going to make this hypervisor available where you can

269
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:34,040
install your Ubuntu or your Arches or your Fedoras and you'll get access to the GPU.

270
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:39,500
Yeah, I suppose realistically that's the best we were going to get, but it still feels

271
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:46,780
a bit disappointing to me because if that experience isn't that great, or if Atari just completely

272
00:16:46,780 --> 00:16:52,740
moves on from this and moves on to gambling apps and the other stuff that they're working

273
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:58,400
on to make serious money and just completely abandon this down the road, like in a year

274
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:03,800
or two or three or five, whatever, then at least if it was just a PC, then you could

275
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:11,720
install Ubuntu on there, get Kodi working on it, whatever, but not being truly open

276
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:16,200
to that hacking limits the possibility of that, I think.

277
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:20,600
Yeah, but then it would also be just a PC and it would have all of the issues that just

278
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:26,560
a PC has, which maybe we're cool with taking care of, but the average consumer isn't.

279
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:32,700
And their goal as a team is to get the OS and all of the built-in apps to consume just

280
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:36,680
under a gig of storage, and then they want to leave the rest for users.

281
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:42,340
So in a way, what the console offers them is a fixed hardware base, so all the drivers

282
00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:43,960
will be built into the kernel.

283
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:47,300
They're not going to have to use modules, and they feel like that's going to make less

284
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:49,460
security attack surfaces.

285
00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:55,180
It makes it less of a security risk, and in some cases, it'll make it maybe a little harder

286
00:17:55,180 --> 00:18:00,620
to put alternative operating systems on the core, like on the root of the hardware.

287
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:05,120
But if they're creating something that has a hypervisor, where you can get access to

288
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:11,080
a lot of the physical hardware, it is the best compromise we have seen yet in an appliance

289
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:15,720
type device that is trying to appease industry licensing requirements.

290
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:19,400
But I agree, it isn't that exciting anymore.

291
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:22,480
It is a bit ho-hum at this point for me.

292
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:27,240
And at this point, I don't regret backing it, because in a way, it could be a collector's

293
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:31,540
item even if it goes belly up, but I am not excited about it.

294
00:18:31,540 --> 00:18:37,340
And it feels a little uninspired.

295
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:40,680
You see them in here talking about getting the base system up and running and what that

296
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:41,680
took.

297
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:46,340
And to be honest, getting a recent Linux kernel booting on an x86 based platform and then

298
00:18:46,340 --> 00:18:51,900
getting the audio to work, I don't mean to be demeaning, but that's the easy part.

299
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:56,780
And if that's where they've been struggling so far, I don't really have a lot of expectations

300
00:18:56,780 --> 00:18:57,780
anymore.

301
00:18:57,780 --> 00:18:58,780
Yeah.

302
00:18:58,780 --> 00:19:02,120
No wonder the CEO, when he was asked when this thing's going to ship, his answer was

303
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:03,120
2019.

304
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:06,120
So nice and vague there.

305
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:07,120
Yeah.

306
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:08,120
You know, that might surprise you.

307
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:09,120
You might get it in early January.

308
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:13,680
Well, you know, I'll tell you what, when I do get it, I'll have a full review.

309
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:18,120
So I'll give you my impressions the moment I receive the item.

310
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:22,360
I was sort of impressed by some news out of Amazon this week.

311
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:25,960
It's specifically around their EC2 service, but I think this is something that's going

312
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:30,360
to set a new benchmark for the industry and is going to really take off.

313
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:33,760
It's predictive scaling for EC2 powered by machine learning.

314
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:38,240
Yeah, they've had auto scaling for about 10 years nearly at this point.

315
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:39,340
But this is different, isn't it?

316
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:45,760
This is using algorithms and machine learning to look at your usage, combine that with a

317
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:53,480
load of other factors, and then predict when you need more or less compute power, which

318
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:58,700
potentially is going to save customers, big customers at least, a lot of money.

319
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:03,920
What I like about this story is this is really kind of the promise long term of the cloud.

320
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:05,420
This is why you go to the cloud, right?

321
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:10,700
So Amazon writes, using data collected from your actual EC2 usage and further informed

322
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:15,660
by billions of data points drawn from our own observations, we will use well trained

323
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:21,880
machine learning models to predict your expected traffic, including daily and weekly patterns.

324
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:25,380
They do note in here, and this is kind of some interesting insight, the model needs

325
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:31,700
at least one day of historical data to start making predictions, and then that is reevaluated

326
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:36,940
every 24 hours to create a forecast for the next 48 hours.

327
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:40,480
But like you said, Joe, it actually can help save some money too.

328
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:44,100
So not only is it super simple to set up, which I think will be part of the benchmark

329
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:46,940
now for cloud providers, it's a three step wizard.

330
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:50,800
You go through it, you turn it on with a single click, go through the three steps, and then

331
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:51,980
it's on.

332
00:20:51,980 --> 00:20:57,400
But the part that's kind of nice is it can also predict when things are gonna slow down.

333
00:20:57,400 --> 00:21:03,260
So it helps you avoid over provisioning, which will reduce costs.

334
00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:04,540
That's kind of nice too.

335
00:21:04,540 --> 00:21:05,920
The whole thing's pretty slick.

336
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:09,860
The whole way it works is really kind of slick, and the visualization system is pretty cool.

337
00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:14,380
And you know that Microsoft and Google are scrambling now to match this feature.

338
00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:18,740
I was just thinking too, like, could this trickle down to like the digital ocean and

339
00:21:18,740 --> 00:21:25,520
OVH level as well, where all of them are collecting like your network stats and your CPU usage

340
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:29,240
and your memory usage, like that's data they have, but they then need a system that sits

341
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:35,340
on top of that and analyzes that intelligently and says, well, historically, you may need

342
00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:40,540
more resources or I bet a lot of cases, in fact, I bet the majority of cases for like

343
00:21:40,540 --> 00:21:43,580
OVH and digital ocean, you might need less resources.

344
00:21:43,580 --> 00:21:45,840
Well, yeah, that would be very useful for me.

345
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:50,140
Every two weeks when I put out late night Linux, it would ramp up the resources for

346
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:54,940
eight hours, 10 hours, 12 hours, and then ramp down and would potentially save quite

347
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:55,940
a lot of money.

348
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:56,940
Yeah.

349
00:21:56,940 --> 00:21:57,940
I'm surprised this hasn't really been a bigger thing.

350
00:21:57,940 --> 00:22:03,440
Like, I mean, like you said, you've had auto scaling for a while, but this is a whole new

351
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:07,740
level of auto scaling, auto prediction.

352
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:12,700
It is finally taking advantage of what computers are inherently good at and then applying them

353
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:14,580
to our infrastructure.

354
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:17,720
And Drone.io has a similar idea.

355
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:23,020
The Drone.io co-founder and Packet are teaming up for a free continuous delivery service

356
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:25,120
for open source developers.

357
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:29,620
And I thought it was good to highlight this just because there are systems now that we

358
00:22:29,620 --> 00:22:33,500
can participate in to have the computers do the hard work.

359
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:39,260
It's becoming more and more common for open source software to be deployed against different

360
00:22:39,260 --> 00:22:42,940
types of architectures, ARM, Intel, et cetera.

361
00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:47,140
And having systems that can automatically do these builds and test them is key.

362
00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:50,540
And so if this is something that applies to you, if you're working on a project out there

363
00:22:50,540 --> 00:22:54,540
where you need something like this, I encourage you to check out the link in the show notes,

364
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:55,540
linuxactionnews.com.81.

365
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:56,540
Yeah.

366
00:22:56,540 --> 00:23:01,660
The only requirement is that your code is on GitHub and free and open source.

367
00:23:01,660 --> 00:23:04,800
So it's pretty good marketing by them, I think.

368
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:09,540
Give it away to free and open source projects and then anyone who wants to do proprietary

369
00:23:09,540 --> 00:23:13,660
stuff, here's our offerings for not very much per month or whatever.

370
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:15,580
So yeah, hats off for them.

371
00:23:15,580 --> 00:23:16,740
They've got us talking about it.

372
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:17,740
Yeah.

373
00:23:17,740 --> 00:23:20,100
And it is a more and more common business model.

374
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:23,580
And it's one that I think is pretty great because it benefits the open source community

375
00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:28,380
and they get a little attention for it and everybody wins.

376
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:32,720
Well, maybe except for some cases, not everyone wins.

377
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:36,700
And that's something we have to figure out, especially during the nuclear holocaust.

378
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:40,980
Yeah, let's end on a nice cheerful note and talk about nuclear weapons.

379
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:41,980
Yeah.

380
00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:44,540
Okay, great.

381
00:23:44,540 --> 00:23:46,740
And there is a Linux tie-in here, of course.

382
00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:47,740
Of course there is.

383
00:23:47,740 --> 00:23:52,540
Well, what actually makes me feel better about this whole thing is that this new supercomputer,

384
00:23:52,540 --> 00:23:58,220
which is going to be doing the various testing for the existing nuclear arsenal to make sure

385
00:23:58,220 --> 00:24:02,820
that it's all well and good, is running a proper operating system, Red Hat Enterprise

386
00:24:02,820 --> 00:24:03,820
Linux.

387
00:24:03,820 --> 00:24:05,780
So I can sleep safe at night.

388
00:24:05,780 --> 00:24:12,860
Right, in Livermore, California sits Sierra, the world's second most powerful supercomputer.

389
00:24:12,860 --> 00:24:18,380
Sierra looks unassuming, just kind of looks like a basic server farm with a visual style

390
00:24:18,380 --> 00:24:19,380
to it.

391
00:24:19,380 --> 00:24:25,460
But it's actually a massive connected hive of 190,000 processing cores.

392
00:24:25,460 --> 00:24:30,500
It was completed earlier this year and has been on a bit of a shakedown cruise since

393
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:31,500
then.

394
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:34,740
The researchers are throwing different kinds of jobs at it right now to kind of see what

395
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:42,140
it can do, like climate models, astrophysics, medicine, you know, the basics.

396
00:24:42,140 --> 00:24:46,060
But early next year, Sierra's real work will begin.

397
00:24:46,060 --> 00:24:51,500
The system will be air gapped, disconnected from any external network to prevent any kind

398
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:53,340
of unauthorized access.

399
00:24:53,340 --> 00:24:58,680
And then once that happens, it begins its real calculations, the calculations it was

400
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:05,100
purpose built to carry out simulations of nuclear weapon launches and their detonations.

401
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:07,500
And potentially quite a lot more that's classified.

402
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:09,260
So we'll never get to hear about it.

403
00:25:09,260 --> 00:25:11,660
But yeah, oh, well, at least it's running Linux, eh?

404
00:25:11,660 --> 00:25:12,660
Yeah.

405
00:25:12,660 --> 00:25:16,660
And like we mentioned, this is the world's second most powerful supercomputer.

406
00:25:16,660 --> 00:25:21,040
I believe the number one is in Tennessee, and it is actually almost essentially the

407
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:23,680
same thing as the Sierra system.

408
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:25,880
So it's an open architecture that's available to the public.

409
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:27,620
So we actually know quite a bit about it.

410
00:25:27,620 --> 00:25:30,500
And that also runs Red Hat Enterprise Linux.

411
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:34,280
And it's doing jobs available to us plain civilians.

412
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:38,260
And so we actually have a lot of insights into what this super high tech one for the

413
00:25:38,260 --> 00:25:39,660
military does.

414
00:25:39,660 --> 00:25:42,980
And they say in a video that we'll have linked in the show notes that they're already working

415
00:25:42,980 --> 00:25:48,860
on the next version called El Capitan, which should have an order of magnitude more processing

416
00:25:48,860 --> 00:25:49,860
power.

417
00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:51,820
Oh, man.

418
00:25:51,820 --> 00:25:56,300
I'm just happy when I can get Vulcan games working off of my dock connected over Thunderbolt,

419
00:25:56,300 --> 00:25:57,300
Joe.

420
00:25:57,300 --> 00:25:58,300
Yeah.

421
00:25:58,300 --> 00:25:59,940
Shouldn't it have been called Mojave instead of El Capitan?

422
00:25:59,940 --> 00:26:03,940
Yeah, that is weird that it's two different Mac OS release names back to back.

423
00:26:03,940 --> 00:26:04,940
I don't like that.

424
00:26:04,940 --> 00:26:06,660
It doesn't sit well with me, Joe.

425
00:26:06,660 --> 00:26:07,660
But you know what?

426
00:26:07,660 --> 00:26:08,660
We'll keep an eye out.

427
00:26:08,660 --> 00:26:09,660
We'll keep watching.

428
00:26:09,660 --> 00:26:10,660
And we'll report here.

429
00:26:10,660 --> 00:26:15,260
Check out linuxactionnews.com slash subscribe for all the ways to get new episodes.

430
00:26:15,260 --> 00:26:18,540
And go to linuxactionnews.com slash contact for ways to get in touch.

431
00:26:18,540 --> 00:26:19,540
Yeah, do that.

432
00:26:19,540 --> 00:26:20,660
Not enough of you have done that recently.

433
00:26:20,660 --> 00:26:23,940
Tell us what kind of stories you want to hear, linuxactionnews.com slash contact.

434
00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:27,620
More importantly, we need to get this on your radar.

435
00:26:27,620 --> 00:26:35,260
Join us at Linux Fest Northwest, April 26th through the 28th, 2019 at the Bellingham Technical

436
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:38,940
College right here in the beautiful Pacific Northwest.

437
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:43,620
I think if enough of you show up, I might just be able to convince Joe into doing a

438
00:26:43,620 --> 00:26:46,220
live show at Linux Fest Northwest.

439
00:26:46,220 --> 00:26:47,520
Yeah, you never know.

440
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:52,220
The plan is for me to be there, so just my arm, I suppose, as long as it's not too early

441
00:26:52,220 --> 00:26:53,220
in the morning.

442
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:58,140
Come on, that could be so much fun doing a Linux Action News there live at the Fest.

443
00:26:58,140 --> 00:26:59,140
You got to be there.

444
00:26:59,140 --> 00:27:00,460
Yeah, it does sound like a lot of fun.

445
00:27:00,460 --> 00:27:03,500
So yeah, come April 26th to 28th.

446
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:04,940
I'm really looking forward to it, Joe.

447
00:27:04,940 --> 00:27:07,940
It's also Linux Fest Northwest's 20th anniversary.

448
00:27:07,940 --> 00:27:11,820
So it's the one to go to if you've never been before.

449
00:27:11,820 --> 00:27:15,860
But in the meantime, we'll be back next Monday with our weekly take on the latest Linux and

450
00:27:15,860 --> 00:27:16,900
open source news.

451
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:18,900
I am at Chris Elias.

452
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:20,660
I'm at Joe Ressington.

453
00:27:20,660 --> 00:27:23,820
Thank you for joining us, and we will see you next week.

454
00:27:23,820 --> 00:27:50,820
Until then, thanks for listening, and we'll see you later.
