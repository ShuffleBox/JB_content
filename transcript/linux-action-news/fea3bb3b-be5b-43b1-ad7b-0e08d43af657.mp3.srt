00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,160
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, episode 159, recorded on October 18th, 2020. I'm Chris.

2
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:10,160
And I'm Joe.

3
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:14,480
Hello, Joe. Good to be connected with you. And we start this week with the new and improved

4
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:16,360
Plasma 5.20.

5
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:21,600
The KDE developers say it's one absolutely massive release. More features, more fixes

6
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:26,160
for long-standing bugs, more improvements to the user interface. I think they might

7
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:30,280
be slightly over egging the pudding here. It is a good release, but it didn't seem like

8
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:34,180
a massive change from the last one to me.

9
00:00:34,180 --> 00:00:38,200
Over egging the pudding. Yeah, from where I sit, it's a very small change. Because one

10
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:44,420
of the things that's fantastic about Plasma for a workstation is it just keeps the settings

11
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:48,720
that you've set. So if you deviate from the default and you do an upgrade, it almost always

12
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:53,640
keeps your deviation. And there's a lot of new things in Plasma 5.20. I think the biggest

13
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:59,080
one for example would be the task manager is now icon based and it's grouping windows

14
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:04,700
together. That's not how I use my task manager. And I did an update to 5.20 and everything

15
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:10,040
the way I like it is still just that way. And while it's really great to see these improvements

16
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:13,540
land and I think there are some really good ones in here, you might be right. Maybe they

17
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:20,040
are, as you say, over egging it just a bit. But I really appreciate as a workstation user,

18
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:25,400
I think I have gone through at least five or six fairly significant Plasma desktop updates

19
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:30,000
now on this desktop right here and it's all been really solid. It keeps working the way

20
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,280
I expect every single day. It just seems to get better. Well, I installed KDE neon because

21
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:41,800
I wanted to see it in its default state. And the icon only task manager so we're talking

22
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:47,760
about the panel or the taskbar as it would be in Windows. It's very Windows like now,

23
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:53,760
where you just have the icon. Now, to Linux users and people who are already used to a

24
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:58,560
different way of doing things, that's a bit alien. But I wonder if it is a good idea to

25
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:03,480
encourage new people who are used to this from not only Windows, but also Chrome OS.

26
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:07,400
And really kind of more like how mobile would work, I suppose, which has the most users.

27
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:12,720
Well, yeah, true. And the thing is that it's trivial to turn it back to what I would consider

28
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:16,920
normal, you just right click and then there's an option for alternatives. And then you can

29
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:22,320
just set it back. And it's just like, ah, okay, good, how we like because plasma is

30
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:28,040
just so configurable. But defaults are king and most people don't change them ultimately,

31
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:33,200
although maybe not with plasma because it is known for its configurability. So I don't

32
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:38,800
think it's a huge deal. I think that it could have upset people if it wasn't so easy to

33
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:39,800
change.

34
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:44,840
Yeah, the standard functionality is still there and working great. I think a lot of

35
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:49,480
the improvements that have gone into making plasma work on Wayland are easy to overlook

36
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:55,280
because Wayland is the story that just keeps on going. There's never really an end to the

37
00:02:55,280 --> 00:03:00,000
Wayland improvements, it seems. And so it's easy to overlook those. But we're getting

38
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,160
to a really usable state now. There's some significant usability things that are now

39
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:11,200
baked into Kwin for the plasma desktop that X users that are transitioning to Wayland

40
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:17,080
would just expect like the ability for your screenshot tool to work or for the task manager

41
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:22,960
to preview the windows of their running applications, or K runner just showing up in the right place.

42
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:27,480
Those things didn't necessarily work right under Wayland. And the KDE community has really

43
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:33,360
been hitting this hard since 2019. And a lot of those efforts that have been just nonstop

44
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:37,560
every single release improvements are all kind of coming together and paying off in

45
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:38,560
520.

46
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:42,520
Yeah, and they're still looking at this from something of a legacy angle because one of

47
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:47,040
the bullet points under the Wayland improvements is the whole desktop session no longer crashes

48
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:54,160
if X Wayland crashes, which is important because this transition has been very, very slow.

49
00:03:54,160 --> 00:04:02,280
And I don't think that we are anywhere near a full Wayland world yet. And so improving

50
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:07,560
aspects like X Wayland are going to be important probably for years to come still.

51
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:13,760
I do have to say with this release and with recent GNOME Shell releases, I think it is

52
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:19,660
possible to live daily life on Wayland in certain hardware combinations. I have several

53
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:24,140
machines and only one of them is full time Wayland because it just happens to be the

54
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:29,760
most stable combination, which is all Intel right now. And I think if you are on plasma

55
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:35,200
520, you're going to have pretty good results. There's other things in here though that are

56
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:40,180
nice because it just feels like it takes plasma closer to the metal. The system settings and

57
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:45,160
info center have gained a couple of new capabilities. Joey has a great article over at OMG Ubuntu

58
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:48,240
with screenshots of some of this that we'll have linked if you want to see it. But now

59
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:52,080
in there, you'll get smart monitoring for your hard drive so you get maybe a heads up

60
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:56,160
if you're going to have a hard drive issue, which seems really nice. And your touchpad

61
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:00,120
cursor speed can now be configured a little more accurately. And it's presented in a way

62
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:04,800
that's really easy to understand and use. It's just another example of bringing things

63
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:09,920
in a little bit closer, making it feel like plasma is fully integrated with the machine.

64
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:10,920
It's all one experience.

65
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:14,960
And there's some small areas of polish as well. Like they've redesigned the onscreen

66
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:20,200
display bubbles. Now they're much smaller and subtler. It's not a huge difference. I

67
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:25,480
had them side by side, the old one and the new one. And it does make a difference though.

68
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:30,320
Makes it feel slicker and just that little bit more polished, as I said.

69
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:34,520
I noted that you said you tried it with KD neon, which is what I'm using here as well.

70
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:39,340
And I think I've been running it since mid to late 2018 KD neon. And I've been upgrading

71
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:44,120
every single release of plasma as they've come out. And it has been a very rock solid

72
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:50,400
workstation. And like I started to mention at the top, it shows me how committed the

73
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:54,960
plasma desktop developers are to letting users create their own plasma desktop experience

74
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:58,080
and then trying to preserve it the best they can.

75
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:04,320
I feel like something's going on with neon. It's more than just a testbed for plasma developers.

76
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:08,840
I think they're making a sneaky workstation OS and they just don't want to admit it.

77
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:13,840
Well, that's something that Nate Graham talked about at Academy 2020 at the beginning of

78
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:18,880
October, how KD neon is kind of this halfway house. It's basically a distro, but it's

79
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:25,120
not officially. And maybe it should be a proper distro and the official showcase for KDE.

80
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:30,640
That's kind of how I've always seen it anyway, is it's the official showcase. It's the immediate

81
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:36,960
thought I go for. Okay, there's a new release of plasma. Well, let's download and install

82
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:41,040
KD neon because that's going to be the purest way to look at it.

83
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:46,520
Yeah, I've heard it implied that the existence of KD neon has deterred some distributions

84
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:50,840
from shipping plasma as their default desktop. And that's why we see so many of the enterprise

85
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:56,040
distributions and products that are focused at enterprise workstations using GNOME Shell.

86
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:59,560
That's the implication I've seen. I don't know if I buy that, but I do think that we

87
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:05,080
don't see enough enterprise workstation focused Linux desktops built on plasma. There's really

88
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:09,480
nothing out there right now. And I'd love to see KD neon just say, you know what, we're

89
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:15,280
gonna do it, we're gonna be the premier distribution for running plasma. And I guess maybe it would

90
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:20,000
take more resources, it would take a lot more than what the project probably currently has

91
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,280
scope for. I mean, they probably have their hands pretty busy just doing what they do.

92
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:28,800
So I wouldn't want to see it harm upstream plasma development. But I do feel like plasma

93
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:33,440
is pretty underrepresented in the workstation space, especially for how powerful it is and

94
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:37,800
what a great workstation desktop environment can be because it can really be suited to

95
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:42,160
match your environment's needs in a way that most desktops can't using really good sound

96
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:47,120
modern technology that has been clearly well maintained and has a good path forward. It

97
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:52,200
just seems like it just checks all the boxes. They even have an LTS release of plasma. And

98
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:56,660
yet we don't see it featured on any of these quote unquote enterprise distros. And maybe

99
00:07:56,660 --> 00:08:01,600
neon needs to close that gap. I don't know. Maybe it's not possible. But it just seems

100
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:05,920
like such a shame because it's a great desktop environment that you really kind of have to

101
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:10,040
go find yourself. You have to go seek it out and you have to even know about it. And it

102
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:12,240
just sort of puts them on a disadvantage in that regard.

103
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:16,720
Yeah, I agree. I'd like to see it more widely used. Apart from anything else, it's more

104
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:21,920
familiar to people coming over from the Windows world. Even by default, it's pretty similar

105
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:26,440
to Windows in terms of the user experience compared to GNOME, which is just a complete

106
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:32,840
paradigm shift, which like it or not, whatever, it is very different from Windows, whereas

107
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:36,160
plasma, not so much.

108
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:40,860
System76.com. Let me reintroduce you to who they are. Go over there, check out System76

109
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:44,880
and see the combination of hardware and software. And if you get something, tell them the Linux

110
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:48,660
Action News sent you. Laptops are assembled in the US. You may have known that. But did

111
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:54,000
you know that the Thaleo workstation is designed and built in the US? The Thaleo even has a

112
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,820
flash sale right now. So if you're listening as this episode comes out, head over to System76

113
00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:02,400
as soon as you can and take advantage of their flash sale because I don't know how long it's

114
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:07,160
going to last. You should jump in on that. What really makes System76 stand out now is

115
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:11,440
the special hardware combined with the excellent software. I've become a big fan of their auto

116
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:17,400
tiling extension recently released with Pop OS. It's built on modern tools, so it's sustainable,

117
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:22,580
a lot like their firmware tool, which is built on Rust. Also a sustainable, long term kind

118
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:27,280
of project. They measure twice and they cut once. It shows in their software and it shows

119
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:31,400
in their hardware. The current version of Pop OS just keeps getting better. Fractional

120
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:36,100
scaling has landed in Pop OS, hybrid graphics mode for external displays, and even more

121
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:41,460
is coming. So go over to System76.com. Reintroduce yourself to what they have to offer. It's

122
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:45,340
pretty great. System76.com. And when you're there, if you get something, tell them Linux

123
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:51,180
Action News sent you. System76.com. The integration of hardware and software has never been better.

124
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:57,980
System76.com. OpenOffice reaches the 20th anniversary mark and LibreOffice still seems

125
00:09:57,980 --> 00:10:00,320
to be struggling to get out from underneath their shadow.

126
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:05,720
Yeah, the board of directors at the Document Foundation published an open letter this week

127
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:11,000
detailing how little development there's been of OpenOffice over the last six years and

128
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:17,240
showing the relatively frantic development of LibreOffice and basically saying to them,

129
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:22,700
look, give it up, guys. We should all be using LibreOffice now. Just let it die. Forward

130
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:29,260
all your users onto us. Now, I look at this and I think I understand why the Document

131
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:34,620
Foundation is doing this. They do have a much more actively developed office suite, which

132
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:39,980
is just better than OpenOffice, but they don't have the mindshare. And we've talked about

133
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:45,980
this before. Normal people still think of OpenOffice as the free alternative to Microsoft

134
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:50,460
Office. I suppose less so now with Google Docs and things, but if you want something

135
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:56,160
locally installed, oh, you don't need to pay for that Microsoft license, just go for OpenOffice.

136
00:10:56,160 --> 00:11:02,260
So I do sympathize with them, but that's just not really how open source works. If you fork

137
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:07,860
something, you take the rough with the smooth. You are now in control of it, but you also

138
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:11,140
don't have the branding that the original product had.

139
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:15,420
Right. I'm sure people still refer to Nextcloud as own cloud very often.

140
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:19,260
I think that Nextcloud is a good example of this. I think they've done a better job of

141
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:24,620
marketing and getting their name out there. Maybe that's because we're in this Linux bubble

142
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:29,860
and maybe it's because it wasn't quite so established, own cloud as a brand. But to

143
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:35,840
me, that is a better example of how to do a fork and really push some marketing effort

144
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:41,580
with it. And LaborOffice have done to some extent, but here we are nearly 10 years after

145
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:46,380
they originally forked it. And still, they haven't got the mindshare that OpenOffice

146
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:48,780
has despite the lack of development with OpenOffice.

147
00:11:48,780 --> 00:11:54,400
Well, I can go back even further. It's 20 years since Sun initially open sourced the

148
00:11:54,400 --> 00:12:00,820
suite as OpenOffice. And then OpenOffice 1.0 didn't come out until two years later, 2002.

149
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:06,460
And then it wasn't until 2011 that Oracle transferred OpenOffice to the Apache Foundation.

150
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:10,860
And that's where we get 20 years from. So we have 20 years of OpenOffice. That's a long

151
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:15,020
time for a brand name. But when you look at the Nextcloud own cloud situation, there's

152
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:21,340
a key difference there. People are interested in file sync and hosted services that Nextcloud

153
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:26,180
offer. People are not interested in office software. What I think is really evident here

154
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:31,460
is the Document Foundation and the LibreOffice team have a complex around OpenOffice holding

155
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:36,500
them back. They look at that as that's what's limiting their success is the brand awareness

156
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:41,540
of OpenOffice instead of addressing the wider problem, which is making their product more

157
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:45,900
compelling. And yes, they've done things to make it nicer. But fundamentally, there's

158
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:49,640
just not a lot of room in this market. And there's not a lot of passion and interest.

159
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:54,260
And I think that's really what holds back LibreOffice, not that OpenOffice is beleaguered

160
00:12:54,260 --> 00:12:58,780
out there just sort of around absorbing all these random downloads. So I decided this

161
00:12:58,780 --> 00:13:02,700
morning to just take a crack at downloading OpenOffice to see what that experience is

162
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:09,940
like. If you're on a Debian system, it downloads 41 different devs in a tar gz file that expects

163
00:13:09,940 --> 00:13:14,660
you to go through and figure out the dependency chain on your own to install. And then on

164
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:18,100
the Windows side, it's a super old installation process didn't bother going through because

165
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:23,700
I don't have a Windows machine handy, but I could tell it was archaic in nature. Additionally,

166
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:28,100
every modern Linux distribution for the most part, with some exceptions, ships with LibreOffice

167
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:32,660
already pre installed. And if you attempt to install OpenOffice when you have LibreOffice

168
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:39,500
on a system, that's not going to fly. So there's probably not really this ginormous amount

169
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:43,620
of drive by downloaders that are going and getting OpenOffice that would have otherwise

170
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:47,900
gotten LibreOffice if only there was a note on the OpenOffice website telling them where

171
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:52,920
to go. And what's even further evident when you dig in is this has become very much a

172
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:58,260
personality conflict between two projects that are more alike than they are different,

173
00:13:58,260 --> 00:14:01,880
but yet they just can't seem to get along. And of course, there's a little bit of licensing

174
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:06,980
goodness in this mix that makes it so that LibreOffice can adopt changes in OpenOffice,

175
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:11,500
but OpenOffice cannot integrate changes from LibreOffice. So it's a one way improvement

176
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:16,940
window. And I don't really think the look of an open letter asking your competitor or

177
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:21,420
your former forked project to shut down and tell users to go somewhere else is a very

178
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:27,140
good one. It just comes across as, well, not very classy, and maybe a little combative.

179
00:14:27,140 --> 00:14:32,860
That is true, but I don't think that your download experience there was typical. You

180
00:14:32,860 --> 00:14:37,460
might say that the Windows experience is archaic or whatever, but isn't that the case with

181
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:42,820
most Windows applications? You just download the executable and then open it and next,

182
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:46,020
next, next, done, maybe reboot if you're unlucky.

183
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:50,100
Is that or is it the Windows store now? I don't know. I really don't.

184
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:54,300
I don't know. I haven't used Windows enough really in anger to know whether people are

185
00:14:54,300 --> 00:15:00,820
using the store these days. I think most people who use Windows don't actually install much.

186
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:06,020
Doesn't an administrator do that for them? Whether that is a part of a corporate network

187
00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:11,460
or whatever, or just someone's a technical friend or whatever sets things up for them.

188
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:15,480
But then if it's someone technical or a friend that's an enthusiast, they may already know

189
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:16,480
about LibreOffice.

190
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:20,140
Well, that's what I would argue that maybe not. Maybe not, you know.

191
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:21,140
It's possible.

192
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:23,280
And that's certainly what the Document Foundation are arguing.

193
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:26,900
That seems to be their main issue, is that people would know they exist if it wasn't

194
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:31,740
for that dang OpenOffice out there. And the OpenOffice folks responded in such. They said

195
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:36,160
we only wish that in addition to strongly encouraging a dual license contribution model,

196
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:41,740
the LibreOffice would also stop heavily campaigning for Apache OpenOffice's demise. And even if

197
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:47,420
somehow Apache OpenOffice died tomorrow, the idea that we would appoint LibreOffice or

198
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:52,500
any other singular project as OpenOffice's successor seems to indicate a lack of understanding

199
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:57,900
about nonprofit foundations and how they work. We must remain neutral. There are, after all,

200
00:15:57,900 --> 00:16:01,700
other open source office suites available, each with their own audience and niche.

201
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:05,940
I was actually surprised that you didn't argue that an office suite doesn't need to be updated

202
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:09,620
that often. And the fact that it's been like six years since there's been any significant

203
00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:14,700
update to OpenOffice is fine because the word processor is essentially done. I thought that

204
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:15,700
would be your argument.

205
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:22,180
Well, it's the compatibility argument that Microsoft keep changing the goal posts with

206
00:16:22,180 --> 00:16:25,660
macros and stuff like that, that you do need to stay on top of it. Otherwise, you're going

207
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:30,500
to have cross compatibility issues. You're going to send people documents that just don't

208
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:35,340
look right. I mean, even now, I still send people PDFs. I just render it to a PDF and

209
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:40,620
then there's no chance of it not looking right. Even with basics like just Word documents

210
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:43,980
that are just like a basic invoice with a couple of different fonts or whatever. I've

211
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:48,460
had that show up with the bank details not working stuff. And you only have that once

212
00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:50,060
when you have to send an invoice twice.

213
00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:55,580
Yeah, that's a very good point. I think also we would be negligent if we didn't mention

214
00:16:55,580 --> 00:17:02,020
that there's plenty of really good text editors available now if you just want to write. There's

215
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:06,900
purpose built text editors for all kinds of different writing. And then there is pretty

216
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:13,260
feature rich web based word processors like Google Docs and Office 365 that are available

217
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:17,380
to everybody that has an internet connection. And so I think when you combine the fact that

218
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:22,380
there is a very viable industry standard in Microsoft Office, when you add in a little

219
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:29,900
bit of open office brand recognition, combine that with the online word processors, and

220
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:34,540
it seems like there's probably not a very growing market for LibreOffice. It probably

221
00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:36,620
much has a very established user base.

222
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:41,860
Yeah, I agree. It's sad, but I think it's true. I don't think we can kid ourselves that

223
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:46,860
people are looking to run something locally and natively when they can just fire up a

224
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:51,380
web browser and open a Google Doc for free. All you need is a Google account which is

225
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:57,580
free to get. And we in the open source world don't like that idea. A lot of people don't

226
00:17:57,580 --> 00:18:01,940
trust Google or Microsoft or whatever and want to run things locally, but that does

227
00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:05,860
seem like not exactly a growth market to me. You're right.

228
00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:10,900
And I appreciate this is very much a dog bites man story in this regard, but it's painful

229
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:15,760
to see these two projects bicker publicly at each other in what seems like pandemic

230
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:21,780
and not really all of that meaningful differences, but they to them mean all of the world. And

231
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:27,100
you add in a little bit of license radicalization and it's just polar opposite opinions on certain

232
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:34,660
topics and they can't work together when clearly they each would benefit so much by collaborating

233
00:18:34,660 --> 00:18:39,140
and they obviously share more in common than they have in actual technical differences,

234
00:18:39,140 --> 00:18:43,340
but yet they just cannot see eye to eye. You add in the licensing differences between the

235
00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:49,460
projects and it's oil and water and it makes me a little disappointed to see it still because

236
00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:54,980
it's just it's such a waste of great resources, but yet they can't come to any kind of agreement

237
00:18:54,980 --> 00:19:00,420
any kind of terms together and it seems like there's bad blood and I got to agree with

238
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:05,700
the folks at open office and the Apache Foundation. It does feel like LibreOffice is champion

239
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:10,220
a death watch for open office. I mean, let's face it now you and I are kind of watching

240
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:13,380
and thinking, okay, we'll see how long an open office sticks around now. It's on our

241
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:14,380
minds now.

242
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:19,180
Yeah, and I'm sure that people will write to us about the various online hosted versions

243
00:19:19,180 --> 00:19:23,840
of LibreOffice that they're working towards, but it's just nowhere near Google Docs is

244
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:28,300
it or Microsoft. I've never actually used the Microsoft one, but even Dropbox has their

245
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:34,220
paper which is reasonably good and I just don't think that we are anywhere near there

246
00:19:34,220 --> 00:19:35,220
with LibreOffice.

247
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:39,420
Yeah, and I think the other thing and this is I guess maybe my last thing on this is

248
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:45,020
I feel like teams, especially teams that are working from home are picking tools that work

249
00:19:45,020 --> 00:19:49,740
for their jobs, you know, various kind of more specialized tools. An example here is

250
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:55,020
we very heavily use Kodi MD. So we have tons of documents we create at Jupiter broadcasting

251
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:59,380
lots and lots, but they're all in Kodi MD. We're not we're not using Google Docs or Office

252
00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:04,780
365 because we want everything in markdown. We want real time collaboration. We want syntax

253
00:20:04,780 --> 00:20:09,060
highlighting and we want to be able to render out real previews and share links with each

254
00:20:09,060 --> 00:20:14,100
other over messaging platforms and whatnot. And so we just gravitated to mostly using

255
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:19,580
Kodi MD now and don't really consider writing anything else. So I don't even bother installing

256
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:20,580
an office suite.

257
00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:25,100
You might want everything in markdown. Not everyone does.

258
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:29,580
Oh, they just don't yet.

259
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:34,700
Linode.com slash LAN. Go there to get a $100 60 day credit towards a new account. Linode

260
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:39,140
is the largest independent cloud computing provider. They started three years before

261
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:44,460
AWS because they saw the feature capabilities of Linux before just about anybody else. And

262
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:49,060
no matter what Linux skill you're at or what technology stack you use, Linode can help

263
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:53,300
your ideas come to life on the web. I was just going over my Linode dashboard. Their

264
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:59,580
cloud manager makes it really, really easy to use Linode. I currently have five running

265
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:04,380
rigs and four attached disks to those five running rigs. One of them is just using the

266
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:09,460
built in disk. But what's really nice about this is I wanted to create a reproducible

267
00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:13,380
system so I could test something before I deployed it in production. And I discovered

268
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:17,420
Linode images which allow you to take a snapshot of your disk and then you can just deploy

269
00:21:17,420 --> 00:21:22,300
them to any other Linode under your account. Man, is this super useful when you're trying

270
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:27,220
to bootstrap a master image for a large deployment or in my case, something I'm deploying over

271
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:31,960
and over and over again. You can upload that image to your cloud dashboard and just deploy

272
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:35,660
it when you need it. It's now available. There's no additional charge to store images

273
00:21:35,660 --> 00:21:39,780
for Linode users. They're limited to six gigs, but that's it. That's your only limitation.

274
00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:43,760
So now I'm rocking that preloaded with the stuff we need to do testing. It's also just

275
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:48,460
a great way to get a base install the way I want it. Linode has so many features that

276
00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:53,100
make it just a default for me when I'm deploying something. I don't bother setting up a local

277
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:57,140
server anymore when I need something quick because they have $5 a month rigs. But on

278
00:21:57,140 --> 00:22:00,860
top of that, what I really appreciate about Linode is they have access to infrastructure

279
00:22:00,860 --> 00:22:04,740
and bandwidth. It's just not realistic for my small business or myself personally to

280
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:09,380
get access to. And unlike other entry level hosting services that lock you into their

281
00:22:09,380 --> 00:22:13,380
platform, Linode gives you full back end access to customize and control your server to fit

282
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:18,500
your needs. I use their DNS manager to manage a couple of my domains right there inside

283
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:23,420
the Linode dashboard. It's really easy. They're independently owned and founded on a love

284
00:22:23,420 --> 00:22:27,060
for Linux, which means they're in this for the long haul. They're not just a shoot to

285
00:22:27,060 --> 00:22:31,540
the moon and see how big we can get. They have been building this over and over periods

286
00:22:31,540 --> 00:22:36,620
of years independently. And you guys know I love that. They've been supporting Linux

287
00:22:36,620 --> 00:22:40,860
and other open source initiatives like our favorite Kubuntu or our beloved Linux Fest

288
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:45,180
Northwest. So go see what I've been talking about. Go to linode.com slash LAN. You support

289
00:22:45,180 --> 00:22:49,900
the show that lets them know you heard it here, but also it gets you that $100 credit

290
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:57,300
towards a new account for 60 days. If it runs on Linux, it runs on Linode. Linode.com slash

291
00:22:57,300 --> 00:22:58,300
LAN.

292
00:22:58,300 --> 00:23:03,300
Another week, another Bluetooth vulnerability. This time it caused a bit of drama though.

293
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:07,740
Yeah, it seems like there wasn't very much heads up given to the distributions or kernel

294
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:12,740
maintainers and at the same time that there wasn't a lot of heads up given Intel kind

295
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:17,040
of just started committing that the fix would land in certain versions of stuff without

296
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:21,860
actually talking to the projects and then had to walk it back. They said, for example,

297
00:23:21,860 --> 00:23:25,700
the flaw we're about to talk about, the fix would be in kernel 5.9. And then they had

298
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:30,600
to walk that back and say, oh no, no, no, actually it's going to be in kernel 5.10.

299
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:33,660
And it's not like Intel doesn't know how to do this, right? They should know, especially

300
00:23:33,660 --> 00:23:39,260
after meltdown, really how to nail this. And they blew it again. They dropped this on the

301
00:23:39,260 --> 00:23:42,880
maintainers with no heads up. They got the announcement in the morning and the news was

302
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:44,620
public by the late afternoon.

303
00:23:44,620 --> 00:23:49,540
You mentioned kernel 5.10. Well, at one point Intel said, oh, it's all fixed. It's available

304
00:23:49,540 --> 00:23:53,940
in 5.10. And then people realized, hang on, that's not coming out until December. What

305
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:55,780
are you talking about Intel?

306
00:23:55,780 --> 00:24:00,460
And you got to be thinking like Fedora 33 and Ubuntu 2010 that are just about to release.

307
00:24:00,460 --> 00:24:04,340
They've got to be hustling now even after they've reached their relative freezes to

308
00:24:04,340 --> 00:24:08,780
try to get this fix in. So here's the problem and what you need to worry about is it's a

309
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:13,380
flaw that resides in BlueZ, the software stack that by default implements all Bluetooth core

310
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:18,900
protocols and layers for Linux. Besides Linux laptops, it's used in a lot of consumer and

311
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:25,020
industrial Internet of Things devices. And it impacts any version of Linux after version

312
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:29,380
2.46 of the kernel. So it's been around for a while.

313
00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:32,380
Well, that means most Internet of Things devices will be fine then.

314
00:24:32,380 --> 00:24:36,460
Yeah, I'm sure. Yeah, because they're on 2.2.

315
00:24:36,460 --> 00:24:37,460
Exactly.

316
00:24:37,460 --> 00:24:42,220
It's known as Bleeding Tooth. It's a set of zero click vulnerabilities in the Linux

317
00:24:42,220 --> 00:24:47,700
Bluetooth subsystem that can allow an unauthenticated remote attacker in a short distance, so they

318
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:53,180
have to be within range of your Bluetooth system, to execute arbitrary code with kernel

319
00:24:53,180 --> 00:24:56,700
privileges on devices that are vulnerable.

320
00:24:56,700 --> 00:25:01,980
But the reality is this is very specific. And if you were going to attack someone via

321
00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:07,300
a Bluetooth vulnerability, you'd probably be using the older BlueBorn. So it's not quite

322
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:12,420
the huge catastrophe that some people are making it out to be. It still needs to be

323
00:25:12,420 --> 00:25:13,420
patched.

324
00:25:13,420 --> 00:25:14,420
Yeah.

325
00:25:14,420 --> 00:25:20,060
And how Intel disclosed this appears to be not very responsibly or it certainly wasn't

326
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:26,020
managed very well. Either that or somehow everyone else was caught sleeping on this,

327
00:25:26,020 --> 00:25:27,820
which seems less likely to me.

328
00:25:27,820 --> 00:25:31,720
Ideally, Intel would have given the projects some heads up to start working on this because

329
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:35,260
once the information is out there, people will start working on tools to make it more

330
00:25:35,260 --> 00:25:39,820
and more efficient to exploit it. This advisory is assigned a severity score of 8.3 out of

331
00:25:39,820 --> 00:25:45,900
a possible 10. It's CVE-2020-1235-1 if you want to look it up. But I have to agree with

332
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:51,300
you, Joe. While technically it's an issue and it impacts many generations of Linux,

333
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:55,960
and I hate to see that, at the end of the day, it requires serious proximity to actually

334
00:25:55,960 --> 00:26:00,420
exploit it. And it's only going to be able to do so much depending on the software hardware

335
00:26:00,420 --> 00:26:04,160
stack combo. There's variations of success that they'll reach.

336
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:08,620
But it really just goes on the big pile of vulnerabilities for IoT devices that never

337
00:26:08,620 --> 00:26:12,620
get updates, which is, let's face it, most of them.

338
00:26:12,620 --> 00:26:17,460
Right. And without a doubt, it'll be all these vulnerabilities added up that the robots use

339
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:21,560
to exploit to take over and control everything and deploy their AI.

340
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:24,500
Sometimes I'm convinced that's already happened, man.

341
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:28,700
Pulled right out of the everyone saw this one coming file, the CUPS printing system

342
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:33,180
has essentially stopped development. It's seemingly dried up since the end of 2019.

343
00:26:33,180 --> 00:26:38,660
Yeah, it was Michael Larabelle over at Phronix who brought this to everyone's attention.

344
00:26:38,660 --> 00:26:42,420
And like he said, we all pretty much saw this coming when Michael Sweet left Apple at the

345
00:26:42,420 --> 00:26:50,140
end of 2019. There's not many people left to work on it. So instead of there being 300-ish

346
00:26:50,140 --> 00:26:55,980
commits per year, there's only been one in the whole of 2020. But the question is, does

347
00:26:55,980 --> 00:27:02,340
this really matter anymore? Because printing seems to have moved on to driverless and more

348
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:06,700
of the functionality happening on the actual printers themselves rather than needing something

349
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:07,980
complex like CUPS.

350
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:12,980
Oh, I think very much. I'll get to that. So the background here, why is the Apple involved?

351
00:27:12,980 --> 00:27:16,460
Well, they have to do with that Apple adopted CUPS, the common Unix printing system for

352
00:27:16,460 --> 00:27:24,920
Mac OS in 2002. And they hired its author, Michael Sweet, in 2007. That's also when Apple

353
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:30,980
essentially acquired the CUPS source code. Sweet continued to work on printing at Apple,

354
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:35,180
using CUPS until December 2019 when he left to start a new company, which by the way,

355
00:27:35,180 --> 00:27:40,380
I think it's actually working in the printing space, but more focused at receipt printers

356
00:27:40,380 --> 00:27:42,700
and smaller printing labels and stuff.

357
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:47,100
Yeah. Asked at the time, though, by the register, what was going to happen with the future of

358
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:51,900
CUPS? He said, quote, CUPS is still owned and maintained by Apple. There are two other engineers

359
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:56,020
still in the printing team that are responsible for CUPS development, and it will continue

360
00:27:56,020 --> 00:28:01,940
to have new bug fix releases, at least for the foreseeable future. So it's possible Apple

361
00:28:01,940 --> 00:28:07,640
is working on an internal fork or branch that they're updating that they will then do a

362
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:13,740
code dump. Not ideal, but possible. But I'll tell you what, Joe, this is why CUPS matters.

363
00:28:13,740 --> 00:28:20,900
CUPS changed my career. It was so massive for me. At the time, I worked at a bank that

364
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:25,940
had 40 branch locations. Every location had several tellers with the teller printers,

365
00:28:25,940 --> 00:28:31,420
and they had big laser printers for the loans. And nothing could really handle this kind

366
00:28:31,420 --> 00:28:36,380
of complex printing that they were doing, except for CUPS. I mean, it really, it saved

367
00:28:36,380 --> 00:28:40,940
our bacon. And we had something at the time like 700 printers, or some, no, it was even

368
00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:45,300
more than that. It was it was a ridiculous amount of printers. And you need something

369
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:49,460
that you can, you can go in there and you can tweak a little bit, you can customize,

370
00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:53,980
you can load in a PPD and get support for a printer all of a sudden, you need something

371
00:28:53,980 --> 00:28:58,880
that manages all of that and abstracts away the vendor implementations of protocols that

372
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:04,220
are always crap. And the thing that CUPS really was great at is they came out of the gate

373
00:29:04,220 --> 00:29:08,740
with the internet print protocol support, and PPD support. So vendors could easily release

374
00:29:08,740 --> 00:29:13,500
a file that made it possible to print on Linux, and it just changed the printing game for

375
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:17,780
Linux. The future projects that are out there, they're ambitious, I look forward to where

376
00:29:17,780 --> 00:29:22,020
they're going. But for example, the one that's kind of more targeted for Linux from open

377
00:29:22,020 --> 00:29:28,140
printing now, which is a fork of CUPS is removing PPD support. It's going to be great for home

378
00:29:28,140 --> 00:29:34,020
users that go by a combo printer and put it on the network and Linux auto discovers it

379
00:29:34,020 --> 00:29:38,220
like that is going to work better one day, which actually works pretty good today, but

380
00:29:38,220 --> 00:29:42,300
it's going to work better one day. But what is going to take a major hit is the enterprise

381
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:47,340
side of things where you have central print servers that manage print queues, and people

382
00:29:47,340 --> 00:29:51,580
have a total that they're allowed to actually print, there's print quotas, and things are

383
00:29:51,580 --> 00:29:56,400
tracked to particular clients because it goes back to billing. Those kinds of systems need

384
00:29:56,400 --> 00:30:03,840
something like CUPS. And I hate it when Linux has something and it's enterprise grade, and

385
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:08,900
you begin to depend on it, and then it fades. And we have to invent something new to replace

386
00:30:08,900 --> 00:30:14,980
it, which is often better in some ways, but maybe is kind of lacking certain features

387
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:20,100
in other ways that make it not as great, not as one-to-one replacement. I feel like that's

388
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:24,260
the future we're going into is we won't have a good one-to-one replacement to CUPS. To

389
00:30:24,260 --> 00:30:28,060
avoid going on though about printers forever, because I know not everybody cares, I just

390
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:33,500
put a few resources in the show notes. If you're curious about where printing is going,

391
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:37,340
what the Linux Foundation's open printing effort has in store, those links are in the

392
00:30:37,340 --> 00:30:46,040
show notes at linuxactionnews.com. Linux.ting.com. It's mobile that makes sense. You just pay

393
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:51,060
for what you use. $6 for your line, and then you just pay for your minutes, your messages,

394
00:30:51,060 --> 00:30:55,560
and your megabytes. I'm on Wi-Fi almost all the time, except for when I'm driving between

395
00:30:55,560 --> 00:31:00,260
the studio and Lady Joops. It's Wi-Fi for me, and so it makes a lot of sense to only

396
00:31:00,260 --> 00:31:06,140
pay for what I use. I maybe make two or three or four actual phone calls a week, tops, and

397
00:31:06,140 --> 00:31:10,000
maybe it's even one actual phone call a week. The rest are all over VoIP. Why would I pay

398
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:14,220
for those cellular minutes that I'm not using? And rest assured, Ting has you covered with

399
00:31:14,220 --> 00:31:17,980
three nationwide networks from coast to coast. There's a lot you can choose from. I've been

400
00:31:17,980 --> 00:31:24,580
enjoying Verizon recently, and this is no-contracts mobile. There's no lock-in here. You just pay

401
00:31:24,580 --> 00:31:29,180
for what you use, risk-free. You're in control the entire time, too. They have a fantastic

402
00:31:29,180 --> 00:31:34,620
dashboard that lets you take complete control over your account. You can set usage alerts,

403
00:31:34,620 --> 00:31:39,220
you can individually name different phones so you can check in on how little Susie's

404
00:31:39,220 --> 00:31:44,100
doing on her new phone. And let's talk about devices. Of course, they're compatible with

405
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:48,480
the latest and greatest Galaxies or iPhones or Pixels or whatever you might want to throw

406
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:52,500
on there, but I would encourage you, if you don't have a phone already, go to Ting.com

407
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:58,620
slash shop. Well, do the show a solid. Go to Linux.ting.com. That way you get a $25

408
00:31:58,620 --> 00:32:02,020
discount off the device, and it says, hey, I heard about it here on the show. I'm supporting

409
00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:06,580
Linux Action News. They've got a bunch of really nice devices, like the Motorola Moto

410
00:32:06,580 --> 00:32:12,380
E. Yeah, it's still a thing, and you can get it for $99 unlocked fully yours from Ting.

411
00:32:12,380 --> 00:32:16,300
But if you have a device, that might be a great way to go. They have a compatibility

412
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:21,060
checker. Head over to Linux.ting.com and click on the Check Your Phone link. Then go in there,

413
00:32:21,060 --> 00:32:25,180
put in your phone's IMEI, and it'll tell you if it's compatible with the Ting. If it is,

414
00:32:25,180 --> 00:32:27,820
it's click, click, click. You don't even have to talk to a human. You're good to go, and

415
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:33,700
you'll get that $25 service credit. So then your first month, it's probably paid for.

416
00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:42,180
That's how awesome Ting is. It's just that great. So go check it out. Get started. Linux.ting.com.

417
00:32:42,180 --> 00:32:46,040
Well, my heart skipped a beat this week when I received an email from the AntennaPod team

418
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:51,900
telling me that a major new version had been released. I was panicking. Oh, no, they haven't

419
00:32:51,900 --> 00:32:56,700
changed my favorite podcast player, have they? Well, they have, but only a little bit, and

420
00:32:56,700 --> 00:32:59,500
I think ultimately they are improvements.

421
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:03,940
If you're on Android and you're like a power podcast listener, you should probably be looking

422
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:08,460
at AntennaPod. It has features that none of the other podcast catchers have, but they've

423
00:33:08,460 --> 00:33:12,900
added a few things too that are new. An option to export your favorites to an HTML file.

424
00:33:12,900 --> 00:33:17,300
They'll ask you if you prefer streaming over downloading when you just stream the podcast

425
00:33:17,300 --> 00:33:21,420
very often, which is great if you don't have a lot of storage space or you're on Wi-Fi.

426
00:33:21,420 --> 00:33:26,340
And they have feed settings to reduce volume or skip an episode's intro or ending if you

427
00:33:26,340 --> 00:33:30,100
know kind of what the timing is. You can put them in there per feed and it'll just do that

428
00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:34,380
for every episode for you. And then the one that I am super happy to see, even though

429
00:33:34,380 --> 00:33:40,580
we don't take advantage of it today, support for chapter images is awesome because we do

430
00:33:40,580 --> 00:33:45,900
chapters in almost all of our shows with some exceptions. And to be able to display something

431
00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:50,140
up there is really nice in those rare times you need to show a visual. But there's just

432
00:33:50,140 --> 00:33:54,300
a ton of other good stuff in AntennaPod, so it seems that version two is even better.

433
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:56,460
I'm assuming you got a chance to kick the tires?

434
00:33:56,460 --> 00:34:01,140
Yeah, I immediately updated when I got this email and was immediately relieved. And then

435
00:34:01,140 --> 00:34:06,460
I've just been discovering little changes since. It did kind of feel like it was due

436
00:34:06,460 --> 00:34:11,000
for an update. It'd been a while. The last update, I didn't like it, changed it completely,

437
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:15,900
but I got used to it. And now they're adding these features like they've been able to set

438
00:34:15,900 --> 00:34:20,820
a certain number of seconds that you skip at the beginning or end and you can sync with

439
00:34:20,820 --> 00:34:28,220
G Podder and everything. It does feel like a proper modern podcast player now. And the

440
00:34:28,220 --> 00:34:32,820
fact that it is, I mean, it's really the only game in town in terms of open source podcast

441
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:38,600
players on Android at least. I feel like I could recommend it before this update because

442
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:43,860
it's open source to Linux people. Whereas now with the additional features, I feel like

443
00:34:43,860 --> 00:34:49,380
I can just recommend it just full stop. Like it is a great podcast player. They do mention

444
00:34:49,380 --> 00:34:54,580
in the press release for this that they're going to soon add support for podcastindex.org,

445
00:34:54,580 --> 00:35:00,300
which is the new database from Adam Curry, which is kind of his open competitor to Apple

446
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:04,700
podcast and Spotify. We'll have to see if that actually takes off. I'm a little bit

447
00:35:04,700 --> 00:35:09,240
skeptical, but it's good that they're thinking about the future anyway and adding that in.

448
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:14,240
And also related to this release was a community led effort to redesign the logo. And Intendapod

449
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:18,640
put it out to a public vote. There was a ratings and analysis and they made their decision

450
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:23,620
and they have a new logo as part of this process too that was made by their own community.

451
00:35:23,620 --> 00:35:28,260
Which does look more modern and seems to kind of fit in more with the other modern app icons

452
00:35:28,260 --> 00:35:34,220
that I can see on my phone. But it's different and I don't like change. So I wish I could

453
00:35:34,220 --> 00:35:39,860
just have the old one. But as much as I don't like change, a change is coming to this show.

454
00:35:39,860 --> 00:35:45,340
Yeah, it's mixed news, really. It's good news in the sense that our buddy Drew has a new

455
00:35:45,340 --> 00:35:50,460
job and it looks like a good job for him and we're excited for him. But it also means that

456
00:35:50,460 --> 00:35:54,460
we have a gap in who will be editing Linux Unplugged. And ladies and gentlemen, Linux

457
00:35:54,460 --> 00:35:58,640
Unplugged is a particularly challenging kind of show the way we do it. And there's really

458
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:03,700
only a few people that are qualified to edit. And with Drew stepping out to take on his

459
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:08,960
new gig, it leaves us with the need of an editor. And the only other qualified person

460
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:14,580
I know to edit that show is Joe, which is a big ask and it's a big time commitment.

461
00:36:14,580 --> 00:36:19,700
Yeah. And we kind of talked about this and how to try and make it work. And ultimately,

462
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:25,260
I only really have time to either do that or this. And so Wes is going to step up and

463
00:36:25,260 --> 00:36:30,340
take over from me on this show. I couldn't think of a better person to do it. Wes and

464
00:36:30,340 --> 00:36:35,500
Drew would be the kind of toss up. Drew's way too busy with his new job. Wes is the

465
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:36,500
man for the job.

466
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:40,500
Yeah. And Wes has always been helping the show behind the scenes. He's often stepped

467
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:47,140
in when one of us needed a weekend off. And he's always been following the news very closely.

468
00:36:47,140 --> 00:36:52,300
And so he's going to be able to step in and just hit the ground running. And that's going

469
00:36:52,300 --> 00:36:56,280
to be great for the show production, but it's also going to be great to just get his take

470
00:36:56,280 --> 00:37:01,300
on the news because he's got a really sharp eye. And he's thought a lot about these. And

471
00:37:01,300 --> 00:37:04,880
while I know Wes will do a great job, I of course will miss doing this show with you.

472
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:09,460
So you'll have to come by Linux Unplugged from time to time and harass us. And of course,

473
00:37:09,460 --> 00:37:13,940
I think you got to come back for the end of year predictions review.

474
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:17,700
Yeah, definitely. I'm going to come back and make sure that I beat you. I'll manage to

475
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:23,300
twist the facts so that I beat you on that. And you know, if you or Wes are away, then

476
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:27,460
I'll be around to step in. But it's just that weekly commitment that I don't have time for.

477
00:37:27,460 --> 00:37:33,300
Yeah. And as part of bringing JB back to Indie, JB 3.0, is we want to try to keep everything

478
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:38,220
sustainable. We don't want to overdo it and burn ourselves out. We've learned our lessons.

479
00:37:38,220 --> 00:37:43,460
We know what's sustainable and we know what's not. And so that's also at play here. It's

480
00:37:43,460 --> 00:37:46,860
just in part for the longevity of the show because I don't want to burn either one of

481
00:37:46,860 --> 00:37:50,300
us out. And it will be nice to have you come by and visit from time to time.

482
00:37:50,300 --> 00:37:55,100
And who knows what might happen in the future if circumstances change and timings and schedules

483
00:37:55,100 --> 00:37:57,260
work out better. I could end up coming back.

484
00:37:57,260 --> 00:38:00,740
Yeah. Although I'm never talking to you again, obviously.

485
00:38:00,740 --> 00:38:01,740
Yeah, obviously.

486
00:38:01,740 --> 00:38:05,820
Also, you know, maybe go subscribe to the All Jupiter Broadcasting Shows feed. You never

487
00:38:05,820 --> 00:38:09,420
know what could be in the future as things change. And the first place you'd see something

488
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:13,700
like a new show or something like that would be in the All Shows feed. So you can find

489
00:38:13,700 --> 00:38:18,600
the All Jupiter Broadcasting Shows feed in your podcast catcher or at our website.

490
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:23,380
I will be back for one last episode next week, though. So go to linuxactionnews.com slash

491
00:38:23,380 --> 00:38:26,400
