00:00.000 --> 00:09.900
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, episode 266, recorded on November 9th, 2022.

00:09.900 --> 00:10.900
I'm Chris.

00:10.900 --> 00:11.900
And I'm Wes.

00:11.900 --> 00:12.900
Hello, Wes.

00:12.900 --> 00:14.620
Let's do the news.

00:14.620 --> 00:17.660
We start this week with an observation.

00:17.660 --> 00:23.380
It was not a particularly busy news week in Linux, but there are a few things we wanted

00:23.380 --> 00:25.380
you to know about.

00:25.380 --> 00:31.200
Big Neomundu Summit, which is just wrapped up in Prague after a couple year hiatus.

00:31.200 --> 00:35.960
Yeah, unfortunately, we could not attend this year just due to scheduling conflicts.

00:35.960 --> 00:38.720
But the company did live stream the event.

00:38.720 --> 00:41.520
And we will have a link to each day in the notes.

00:41.520 --> 00:46.480
Sheldon Worth kicked off the three-day event with a bit of a keynote.

00:46.480 --> 00:49.720
All right.

00:49.720 --> 00:50.720
Hello, everybody.

00:50.720 --> 00:51.720
How's this working?

00:51.720 --> 00:54.720
Can you hear me at the back OK?

00:54.720 --> 00:58.440
What a treat to be here in Prague with all of you.

00:58.440 --> 01:00.880
Thank you for making the trip.

01:00.880 --> 01:08.420
It is my greatest, greatest, greatest pleasure to host you here.

01:08.420 --> 01:15.640
And I'm extremely excited for what we're going to be talking about, what we're going to achieve,

01:15.640 --> 01:20.800
and what we're going to enable other people to do with open source.

01:20.800 --> 01:26.000
The community-focused event followed multiple internal company get-togethers that took place

01:26.000 --> 01:31.360
at the same venue, with Mark Shettleworth noting that they had over 500 canonical staffers

01:31.360 --> 01:34.060
there during the Q&A portion of his talk.

01:34.060 --> 01:35.760
Why this specific place?

01:35.760 --> 01:36.760
Yes.

01:36.760 --> 01:40.180
Because we were 500 people last week, and we needed at least 500 rooms, and this place

01:40.180 --> 01:44.880
has 800.

01:44.880 --> 01:52.880
Yeah, and as that Q&A rolled on, Mark proceeded to touch on the tension between the feeling

01:52.880 --> 01:59.080
of being part of something larger and the tension of working from home, and how Canonical

01:59.080 --> 02:01.660
had to adapt during the pandemic as well.

02:01.660 --> 02:07.240
So at Canonical, I got to tell you, we work pretty darn hard, and we work from home, right,

02:07.240 --> 02:12.520
which kind of means everybody gets a corner office, which is great.

02:12.520 --> 02:22.440
But the times that we get together are critical to the health and sanity of a distributed

02:22.440 --> 02:23.440
workforce.

02:23.440 --> 02:30.280
So there's this tension, right, like I think you wouldn't work at Canonical if you didn't

02:30.280 --> 02:37.640
want to be working at home, but then if you were only working at home, you wouldn't feel

02:37.640 --> 02:40.520
part of something much, much bigger.

02:40.520 --> 02:44.800
So for me, it's really, really important that everyone at Canonical makes a commitment twice

02:44.800 --> 02:52.040
a year to get together, not just with their own team, but with lots of other teams.

02:52.040 --> 02:56.360
And I love watching the kind of experiences that people have, because people who've just

02:56.360 --> 03:00.520
joined the company are working inside one team for up to six months, working on one

03:00.520 --> 03:06.120
problem, and then suddenly they realize, wow, I'm in the middle of all of these interesting,

03:06.120 --> 03:10.360
potent, difficult, important threads, right?

03:10.360 --> 03:12.880
And that's really important.

03:12.880 --> 03:17.640
The pandemic, you'd think that the pandemic would be really easy for a remote first organization.

03:17.640 --> 03:18.640
It wasn't.

03:18.640 --> 03:21.020
It really wasn't, right?

03:21.020 --> 03:26.560
And I can tell you, we really missed this feeling of getting together, right, and working

03:26.560 --> 03:34.960
stuff out in person, reaffirming our commitments and our relationships in person, right?

03:34.960 --> 03:36.100
So how do we make that work?

03:36.100 --> 03:37.960
How do we make that work?

03:37.960 --> 03:43.260
Well, what I think is fun is that we try to pick interesting places, right?

03:43.260 --> 03:46.560
This is a very interesting place for lots of different reasons, right?

03:46.560 --> 03:52.280
First, lots of James Bond movies have been shot here over the years.

03:52.280 --> 03:55.280
And second, beer is cheaper than water.

03:55.280 --> 04:00.200
And third, the non-alcoholic beer is very good.

04:00.200 --> 04:03.760
So it seems like there are lots of great reasons to be here.

04:03.760 --> 04:08.000
And when we're in a place, we need a venue where we can all be together.

04:08.000 --> 04:11.840
This event might be the restart of the Ubuntu Summits.

04:11.840 --> 04:17.960
And unlike the Ubuntu Dev Summits of the past, Canonical's intention this time around seems

04:17.960 --> 04:23.960
to be aiming for a bigger tent, an opportunity for them to hear from the community and a

04:23.960 --> 04:32.040
chance for Canonical to showcase their solutions and ideas.

04:32.040 --> 04:37.200
Microsoft has a new version of.NET and one of its headline features is bigger, better,

04:37.200 --> 04:38.800
badder Linux support.

04:38.800 --> 04:42.320
Yes, dear audience member, you heard that right.

04:42.320 --> 04:49.160
One of.NET 7's big new features is improved support and performance on Linux.

04:49.160 --> 04:55.280
Now it even has native ARM64 support and yes, IBM Power as well.

04:55.280 --> 04:56.280
Wow.

04:56.280 --> 04:57.280
Okay.

04:57.280 --> 05:01.160
I mean, there's a lot in.NET 7, no doubt.

05:01.160 --> 05:04.160
That's really kind of a Coda radio story.

05:04.160 --> 05:09.800
But I was just thinking in the Linux terms, if I could travel back in time to young Linux

05:09.800 --> 05:16.120
using Chris in the late 90s, and I could tell him that one day Microsoft would have this

05:16.120 --> 05:20.640
product called.NET, this development language called.NET, and they were releasing this

05:20.640 --> 05:27.580
big new version and they were promoting its new Linux features, I could only imagine how

05:27.580 --> 05:30.200
young me would respond.

05:30.200 --> 05:33.920
I would guess his first question would probably be, how'd you get so damn fat?

05:33.920 --> 05:37.680
And then his second question would be, why did Microsoft pick such a stupid name like

05:37.680 --> 05:38.680
.NET?

05:38.680 --> 05:44.440
Sadly, even in 2022, we don't have answers for those questions yet.

05:44.440 --> 05:49.360
But sticking with Microsoft for just a moment longer, a surprising amount of you out there

05:49.360 --> 05:54.080
were upset when the death of the team's desktop Linux app was announced.

05:54.080 --> 05:56.320
Well, good news.

05:56.320 --> 06:02.080
This week, Microsoft launched the team's progressive web app for desktop Linux.

06:02.080 --> 06:03.360
And you know what?

06:03.360 --> 06:05.280
This might actually be an upgrade for y'all.

06:05.280 --> 06:10.640
I mean, typically, when we talk about a desktop app getting discontinued in favor of a web

06:10.640 --> 06:13.000
app, that's a downgrade.

06:13.000 --> 06:17.280
But teams was always just a web app in different clothing.

06:17.280 --> 06:22.320
And now this PWA brings the Linux version at least closer to being feature parity with

06:22.320 --> 06:24.600
the Windows teams version.

06:24.600 --> 06:28.800
This is how Microsoft puts it in their announcement, they say, quote, a progressive web app enables

06:28.800 --> 06:34.080
us to ship the latest Microsoft Teams feature faster to our Linux customers, and helps us

06:34.080 --> 06:39.560
bridge the gaps between the team's desktop client on Linux and Windows.

06:39.560 --> 06:46.480
The PWA experience is available for both edge and Chrome browsers running on Linux.

06:46.480 --> 06:48.000
Now that's all well and good.

06:48.000 --> 06:51.400
And I'm happy to see investment on Linux here.

06:51.400 --> 06:56.880
But it kind of sounds like maybe Firefox is being left out of this little browser bunch.

06:56.880 --> 07:00.520
If anyone out there has tried to let us know.

07:00.520 --> 07:06.840
That's one bit of research we're happy to outsource.

07:06.840 --> 07:12.040
The standards body behind OpenGL, OpenCL, Vulkan, and some of your other favorites out

07:12.040 --> 07:15.040
there have announced their next graphics API.

07:15.040 --> 07:16.480
And it's called Cameras.

07:16.480 --> 07:23.600
Yes, the Kronos group is working on this new API with the European Machine Vision Association.

07:23.600 --> 07:28.480
The work started back in March, and it's aiming to create a royalty free standard for controlling

07:28.480 --> 07:35.640
camera system runtimes across embedded, mobile, industrial, extended reality, automotive and

07:35.640 --> 07:37.200
scientific markets.

07:37.200 --> 07:43.200
Yeah, you know, having messed around a little bit with embedded remote camera systems, I

07:43.200 --> 07:44.720
can see the need for that.

07:44.720 --> 07:45.720
It is tricky.

07:45.720 --> 07:51.720
So this Cameras API would sit sort of between like software using say FFmpeg or whatever

07:51.720 --> 07:52.720
it might be.

07:52.720 --> 07:56.560
And then the hardware and transports that talk to the actual hardware, be it attached

07:56.560 --> 07:58.920
directly or over the network.

07:58.920 --> 08:04.080
They intend to also support multiple programming languages, and they're going to have a loadable

08:04.080 --> 08:07.800
layer system just like Vulkan and some of the other standards do.

08:07.800 --> 08:13.120
You can think of this layer feature as a command dispatch system that enables developers to

08:13.120 --> 08:19.160
use installable layers for validation, profiling, debugging, things like that.

08:19.160 --> 08:23.960
One question that's still in my mind at this point is what does the introduction of Cameras

08:23.960 --> 08:27.080
mean for Lib Camera?

08:27.080 --> 08:28.080
That's a good question.

08:28.080 --> 08:29.080
We don't know.

08:29.080 --> 08:31.120
I mean, Lib Camera, I think that's a Raspberry Pi project.

08:31.120 --> 08:35.880
So it's potentially single vendor where this wants to sort of create a universal standard.

08:35.880 --> 08:39.360
I mean, you know what you do when you have too many standards or in this case, too many

08:39.360 --> 08:40.360
APIs.

08:40.360 --> 08:43.960
You've got to do the right thing, Wes, and create a universal API that just covers everyone's

08:43.960 --> 08:44.960
use cases.

08:44.960 --> 08:47.960
That'll solve it.

08:47.960 --> 08:57.360
A quick mention for the new FWUPd release this week, version 1.8.7.

08:57.360 --> 09:02.840
The headline feature is more hardware support from Star Labs, including their upcoming Star

09:02.840 --> 09:08.460
Fighter laptop, though we might be most excited about the experimental support for Intel's

09:08.460 --> 09:11.280
discrete GPUs.

09:11.280 --> 09:17.300
Also included is support for fingerprint lengthy devices, Anker's Thunderbolt 4 Mini Hub,

09:17.300 --> 09:22.840
Elan Haptic hardware, and more than a few other devices.

09:22.840 --> 09:26.600
Some new features this time around, well, they include the ability to measure system

09:26.600 --> 09:33.600
integrity when you're installing UEFI updates, and support for XZ compressed metadata, which

09:33.600 --> 09:40.240
should reduce the bandwidth used to download firmware files by approximately 25%.

09:40.240 --> 09:43.960
We'll link to the release notes because we're really just scratching the surface on this

09:43.960 --> 09:48.400
one.

09:48.400 --> 09:50.680
Linode.com slash LAN.

09:50.680 --> 09:53.660
That's where you go to get $100 in 60 day credit on a new account.

09:53.660 --> 09:56.560
It's a great way to support the show while you're checking out Linode.

09:56.560 --> 09:59.160
They make cloud computing simple, affordable, and accessible.

09:59.160 --> 10:03.060
It's how we run everything we've built in the last few years, including our new website,

10:03.060 --> 10:06.760
or if we wanted to check out something that requires a GPU, or we wanted to build a matrix

10:06.760 --> 10:07.760
community.

10:07.760 --> 10:11.360
If you want to do anything from running something for your business, or hosting something for

10:11.360 --> 10:13.000
yourself, Linode's the way to go.

10:13.000 --> 10:17.200
30% to 50% cheaper than those big hyperscalers, and a machine that's going to fit your needs

10:17.200 --> 10:18.200
perfectly.

10:18.200 --> 10:20.600
And on top of that, great performance.

10:20.600 --> 10:24.320
They've got 11 data centers for you to choose from today, and a dozen more coming on next

10:24.320 --> 10:25.320
year.

10:25.320 --> 10:29.120
And great features such as object storage, cloud firewall backups, and Kubernetes support,

10:29.120 --> 10:30.120
and so much more.

10:30.120 --> 10:33.560
So go build something, go learn something, and support the show.

10:33.560 --> 10:37.100
Check out Linode by going to linode.com slash lan.

10:37.100 --> 10:45.400
Get that $100, and support the show, linode.com slash lan.

10:45.400 --> 10:48.120
And also, thank you to Kalyde.

10:48.120 --> 10:53.120
Kalyde is an endpoint security solution that uses the most powerful, untapped resource

10:53.120 --> 10:56.400
in IT, end users.

10:56.400 --> 11:01.800
Instead of forcing old-school MDMs on your users, Kalyde sends them security recommendations

11:01.800 --> 11:03.880
via Slack.

11:03.880 --> 11:07.900
Kalyde will automatically notify your team when their devices are insecure, and give

11:07.900 --> 11:12.480
them step-by-step instructions on how to solve the problem.

11:12.480 --> 11:17.400
By reaching out to employees via a friendly Slack DM, and educating them about company

11:17.400 --> 11:23.160
policies, Kalyde can help you build a culture in which everyone contributes to security,

11:23.160 --> 11:27.440
because everyone understands how and why to do it.

11:27.440 --> 11:32.360
For IT admins, Kalyde provides a single dashboard that lets you monitor the security of your

11:32.360 --> 11:38.280
entire fleet for Mac, Windows, and of course, Linux.

11:38.280 --> 11:46.400
So that's Kalyde, user-centered, cross-platform, endpoint security for teams that Slack.

11:46.400 --> 11:50.320
You can meet your compliance goals by putting users first.

11:50.320 --> 11:54.600
Visit Kalyde.com slash LAN to find out how.

11:54.600 --> 11:59.240
If you follow that link, they'll hook you up with a goodie bag, including a t-shirt,

11:59.240 --> 12:02.800
just for activating a free trial.

12:02.800 --> 12:11.360
That's K-O-L-I-D-E dot com slash LAN.

12:11.360 --> 12:17.280
We end this week with a nice fireside chat between Pat Gelsinger and Linus Torvalds.

12:17.280 --> 12:22.880
The casual conversation was conducted at Intel's Innovation 2022 event, where Intel's CEO got

12:22.880 --> 12:28.160
to sit down and have a wide range of topics to be discussed with Mr. Torvalds.

12:28.160 --> 12:33.640
Intel Innovation is their developer-focused event that they say spotlights the tools,

12:33.640 --> 12:39.240
training, and community to empower the world's developers to create what's next.

12:39.240 --> 12:44.600
So the topics are more developer- and ecosystem-focused than you typically get in some of these fireside

12:44.600 --> 12:46.840
chats with Linus.

12:46.840 --> 12:51.320
One of my favorite moments is when Linus talks about what's most important about open source

12:51.320 --> 12:53.720
to him personally.

12:53.720 --> 13:00.160
And I think one of the most important parts to open source for me has been that everybody

13:00.160 --> 13:04.920
needs to feel like they are in equal footing.

13:04.920 --> 13:12.640
We've had a lot of companies who do dual licensing, and it's perfectly legally fine, but it tends

13:12.640 --> 13:22.080
to result in politics and internal strife about the project when one company or one

13:22.080 --> 13:26.040
entity has more rights than the other entities.

13:26.040 --> 13:34.800
So I've personally tried to always keep all my projects that very clearly I'm not special,

13:34.800 --> 13:39.600
I'm the top-level maintainer when it comes to the kernel, but if somebody else does a

13:39.600 --> 13:45.720
better job and one day that will happen, they will take over because I don't have any special

13:45.720 --> 13:50.160
rights except for the fact that people trust me because I've been doing it for 30 plus

13:50.160 --> 13:51.160
years.

13:51.160 --> 13:54.760
It does seem like open source trust, this idea of contributing to the community and

13:54.760 --> 14:00.000
having the exposure of the community and then finally the trust of the community.

14:00.000 --> 14:01.000
Yes.

14:01.000 --> 14:07.040
But I mean, so you say, I don't actually like the notion of contributing to the community

14:07.040 --> 14:14.840
because that implies a certain amount of altruism that I'm not a huge believer in.

14:14.840 --> 14:22.440
So I really think it's more like you're not contributing to the community.

14:22.440 --> 14:28.720
What you're doing is you're trying to make a project better for yourself and the rules

14:28.720 --> 14:33.560
of the project end up then meaning that as you're making it better for yourself and trying

14:33.560 --> 14:40.500
to improve your own situation, you kind of indirectly contribute to the community.

14:40.500 --> 14:47.860
But you should always be motivated by your needs and that's actually how a lot of these

14:47.860 --> 14:54.560
open source projects, including very much the kernel, have improved so much is because

14:54.560 --> 15:00.680
I'm looking at all we've done in the last 25 years and none of it was stuff that I needed

15:00.680 --> 15:07.260
or I wanted because as far as I was concerned, 25 years ago, the system pretty much did what

15:07.260 --> 15:08.260
I needed.

15:08.260 --> 15:10.840
There's also this moment when things get a bit real.

15:10.840 --> 15:17.120
Linus tells Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger that people don't seem very happy at Intel anymore.

15:17.120 --> 15:19.120
I think everybody knows that issue.

15:19.120 --> 15:27.720
The problems on the execution side have been pretty painful for everybody and I don't see

15:27.720 --> 15:30.920
any of the hardware and fab issues.

15:30.920 --> 15:39.000
What I have seen are kind of the fallout from the Intel software development standpoint

15:39.000 --> 15:48.000
where the last few years have not been quite as ebullient as they were before and people

15:48.000 --> 15:54.020
have not been as happy with being inside of Intel because I don't think Intel has necessarily

15:54.020 --> 15:58.360
been a very happy place for a few years and I'm hoping that's changing.

15:58.360 --> 16:05.120
Well that's certainly my job to change it as well and we're getting on it as we rebuild

16:05.120 --> 16:10.880
and obviously having events like this one are about rebuilding our commitment, our engagement

16:10.880 --> 16:16.280
with the community, participating, driving standards as well.

16:16.280 --> 16:21.960
Linus then goes on to stress how vital hardware documentation is and how Intel could lead

16:21.960 --> 16:27.520
there, but another of my favorite moments was when Linus shared his thoughts on companies

16:27.520 --> 16:33.840
like Intel using software to limit hardware features for marketing purposes.

16:33.840 --> 16:40.840
And since I have your ear and this may be cut out, the thing I sometimes despise about

16:40.840 --> 16:45.920
different companies and Intel has had that problem is when you do market segmentation

16:45.920 --> 16:53.760
where certain features only exist in certain markets that aren't necessarily as available

16:53.760 --> 17:01.720
as others and I'm thinking of things like the transactional memory.

17:01.720 --> 17:07.840
I mean it's gone now, maybe it's never coming back, but that was very painful for us when

17:07.840 --> 17:14.600
only certain server CPUs had it and the people who actually needed to develop for it couldn't

17:14.600 --> 17:21.920
access it easily on their own desktops and that's I think an area where Intel can maybe

17:21.920 --> 17:28.360
improve and not let the market segmentation drive these kind of technical issues that

17:28.360 --> 17:30.840
make it hard for developers.

17:30.840 --> 17:35.560
You tell them Linus and respect to Intel for leaving that bit in the interview, they could

17:35.560 --> 17:37.760
have cut that criticism.

17:37.760 --> 17:43.160
Overall though it's a friendly low key chat, it's about 29 minutes long and we recommend

17:43.160 --> 17:44.160
it.

17:44.160 --> 17:48.280
