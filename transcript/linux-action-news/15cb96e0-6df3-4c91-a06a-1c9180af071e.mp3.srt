00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,680
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, episode 235, recorded on April 5th, 2022.

2
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:09,920
I'm Chris.

3
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:10,920
And I'm Wes.

4
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:11,920
Hello, Wes!

5
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:13,800
Let's do the news.

6
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:17,280
And we start with some good news, everyone!

7
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:20,000
At least for the Docker fans out there.

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,120
But for those of you on the Docker Inc. Death Watch instead, well, it seems you'll just

9
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:27,940
have to wait a little bit longer.

10
00:00:27,940 --> 00:00:36,160
The embattled containerization company this week announced a $105 million Series C funding

11
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:39,480
round, led by Bain Capital Ventures.

12
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:47,000
That brings its total funding to $163 million and a company valuation of $2.1 billion.

13
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,800
These valuations still make no sense.

14
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:51,440
That's that's 2.3 Linux.

15
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:53,140
That's what they're saying Docker is worth.

16
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:58,880
And yet, you're not kidding, Wes, analysts have been circling like vultures over Docker

17
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:04,000
expecting them any day to announce the collapse of the commercial structure around Docker.

18
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,640
And here, the folks at Bain Capital are willing to sink a whole bunch of more money into it.

19
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:13,160
But you know, doesn't mean that page after page of clickbait won't still be written

20
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:15,960
about Docker's limited days ahead.

21
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:18,100
And there is some credibility to it.

22
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:21,560
We have indeed seen major restructures at the Docker company.

23
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:26,220
We absolutely have seen some flipping between various product focuses trying to find some

24
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:28,840
traction in the market somewhere where they can make money.

25
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:34,880
But when you read between the lines, it really seems like the investors are more hyped about

26
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:40,240
the software market's overall growth potential than they are necessarily about Docker, except

27
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:44,600
for the fact that Docker Inc. is just seen as one of the companies that is selling the

28
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:49,280
shovels to this next wave of software developers they see coming.

29
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:53,720
For the company's part in the announcement for this latest round of funding, Docker's

30
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:59,960
CEO said, quote, together, we have focused on the needs of developers to help them quickly

31
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:05,480
and safely build, share, and run any app, anywhere.

32
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:10,460
As tens of millions of new developers join the market this decade, this funding enables

33
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:16,160
us to go faster in solving problems for the next generation.

34
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:20,720
Docker also said it has about more than 56,000 commercial customers.

35
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:25,760
But overall, Docker didn't really go into specifics about how this new investment money

36
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:26,760
will be used.

37
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:31,320
In fact, when you read through their announcement, one kind of gets the impression that maybe

38
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:36,680
this investment money is going to just simply cover the bills and keep the lights on.

39
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:43,520
Meanwhile, the folks behind the LexD project have been hard at work on the latest stable

40
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:47,320
release of their system container and virtual machine manager.

41
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:54,160
Yeah, this is often an overlooked tool, but it really has grown just a robust set of features

42
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:58,080
and a really nice, dependable, stable support lifecycle.

43
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:02,920
Yeah, I think that's highlighted in their release announcement where they say, quote,

44
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:09,500
this is our fourth LTS release and quite an exciting one for anyone coming from LexD 4.0,

45
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:16,580
as it significantly steps up LexD's abilities, especially when operating in a clustered environment.

46
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:21,480
As with all our other LTS releases, this one will be supported for five years, until June

47
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:28,880
2027, and will receive a number of bugfix and security point releases over that time.

48
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:33,880
LexD is really known for an impressive backwards compatibility story, but things do change

49
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:38,840
over time and it seems they're making some adjustments they write in the release.

50
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:42,420
This just became increasingly costly, the amount of code we had to keep around to handle

51
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:44,080
data migration.

52
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:48,900
This was also causing us to keep depending on old dependencies that have gone unmaintained

53
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:52,760
for years and becoming a potential security risk.

54
00:03:52,760 --> 00:04:00,300
As a result, LexD 5.0 was changed to only support upgrading from LexD 4.0 or higher.

55
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:07,220
But boy, is it worth an upgrade because a lot has happened since that last LTS, including

56
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:13,360
and definitely not least, virtual machine support is effectively at feature parity with

57
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,680
containers now.

58
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:21,420
That includes stuff like virtual TPM support, arbitrary PCI device pass through, and even

59
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:40,520
live migration and stateful snapshots.

60
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:46,520
Now for a change that the open source community is getting a front row seat to.

61
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:51,560
It's the overhaul of Fedora's installer, which ultimately means the overhaul of the

62
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:54,120
Red Hat Enterprise Linux installer as well.

63
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:58,760
Indeed, we covered this originally in January when we said, hey, this is in the works.

64
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:02,520
And it seems that the team has been reviewing the feedback since then and has also been

65
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:05,240
running usability studies over the last few years.

66
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:09,120
And they're bringing it all together in a design review process.

67
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:16,360
And seems that some of the feedback indicated their current hub and spoke design was a bit

68
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:17,360
confusing.

69
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:22,320
They note that users were having some difficulty understanding the selection options on the

70
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:27,280
hub screen and also determining which spoke steps to take to complete the installation.

71
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:30,120
Yeah, I think you'd probably agree with that, Wes.

72
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:33,000
Oh, yeah, definitely.

73
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,280
It seems that their new approach is more of an install wizard look, something that users

74
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:40,380
are probably going to be a little bit more familiar with.

75
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:45,120
And in a community blog post, they note that the advantages of this new approach are quote,

76
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:50,800
it supports a guided step by step workflow that allows users to focus on discrete tasks.

77
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:57,180
A wizard helps break down otherwise complex tasks into a series of small, simple steps.

78
00:05:57,180 --> 00:06:02,320
Now it is still early days here, but this is pretty encouraging to see.

79
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:06,560
You know, I've never been a huge fan of the current version of Anaconda, but I have to

80
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,280
admit there's a lot of good bones there.

81
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:11,320
There's a lot of good pieces that they have, especially some of that, you know, like the

82
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:15,480
new updated disk partitioning tool that they've built and obviously just a lot of the low

83
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:16,480
level pieces.

84
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:21,680
So it's kind of refreshing seeing the team being willing to take this criticism, look

85
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:29,520
at other ideas and also be really transparent about the whole thing.

86
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:33,480
While we're talking about Fedora, the team is brainstorming a possible GUI based Linux

87
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:35,040
recovery environment.

88
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:39,160
Yeah, Michael Lauderdale over at Ferronix flagged this one.

89
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:44,040
And it sure seems like it could be a nice compliment to Fedora's existing command line

90
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:46,480
based recovery environment.

91
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:51,880
We should note though that currently this is in the would be nice to have stage.

92
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:56,800
But it does seem like there is some genuine planning happening behind the scenes.

93
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,680
Wouldn't this be great to see?

94
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:02,720
Because you start layering tools on like this, right?

95
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:07,520
Maybe create a tool that can help fix an unbootable system or maybe it even has the ability to

96
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:13,200
browse and select previous snapshots, while also the team is building tools on top of

97
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:16,720
ButterFS and integrating DNF snapshot support.

98
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:21,200
We've got Flatpaks that are delivering applications and the underlying system upgrades have been

99
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:23,040
getting better and better.

100
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:26,920
So you start seeing like all of this layer together and what you get is like this next

101
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:33,600
level of reliability, a real kind of bulletproof reliability that's just an unbeatable feature

102
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:38,840
in enterprise desktops.

103
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:44,080
Everyone's favorite open source firmware update tool, FlopD, has a new release this

104
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:45,240
week.

105
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:50,800
Most notable this time around is support for some Logitech mice and keyboards, Wacom panels

106
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:58,920
on Lenovo laptops, and some additional support for fingerprint readers.

107
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:04,280
Lutris the long running open source game manager that I personally love and works across various

108
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:09,760
stores and platforms has released version 0.5.10 this week.

109
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:15,700
And what's notable is this version features initial Steam Deck support.

110
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:20,280
That Steam Deck support is partially thanks to their collaboration with Valve after receiving

111
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:23,560
a Steam Deck development kit.

112
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:28,760
Now Lutris's Flatpak version that's still being worked on right now is the next step

113
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:31,360
in better Steam Deck support.

114
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:35,400
Until that's fully baked, installing Lutris on the Deck actually requires putting the

115
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:40,640
root file system in read write mode, at least for getting things installed initially.

116
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:43,640
That's a little unfortunate.

117
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:47,920
You can understand something like Lutris, it needs access to all kinds of things on

118
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:53,580
your system for just a wide variety of types of games and hardware that it supports.

119
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:58,440
But in turn that means that this could be at risk of the install getting wiped out during

120
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:03,320
the next SteamOS update because of the read-only nature of the SteamOS system.

121
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:06,960
But we'll have more on that in a moment because I think what I wanted to mention that struck

122
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:11,720
me about this is we have talked about this, the Deck's ability to run even competitor

123
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:14,840
software and competing app stores and whatnot.

124
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:17,320
Just the ability to run applications.

125
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:21,800
But here we are seeing it in the real world and it's still just so novel and rare that

126
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:27,220
a hardware device like this will support running something like Lutris or another installer

127
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:29,760
that you know maybe Valve isn't even a big fan of internally.

128
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:34,600
And I don't know if this is ever going to materialize into some use case that we never

129
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:37,480
saw but now the Deck is super popular for.

130
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:41,840
But I would just be thrilled if even some of the sales here were attributed to the fact

131
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:46,280
that people knew they could buy the Deck and install whatever emulator they wanted to

132
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:49,660
play their favorite Nintendo game or their favorite retro game.

133
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:54,320
If this just became known as the device that lets you play anything on the go and because

134
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:58,640
of its open nature it got there, I think you could see a new trend being set in the industry.

135
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:03,840
I know that's pie in the sky but I think you see the early framework being laid right

136
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:05,480
here for that.

137
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:12,040
And here I thought you were just getting excited about running MS Access via Wine on the go.

138
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:13,400
That too of course.

139
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:19,160
Now as far as gaming features go, 0.5.10 also adds support for integration with games installed

140
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:22,040
via Origin and Ubisoft Connect.

141
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:27,960
There's also a new UI window for adding games directly to Lutris amongst a variety of other

142
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:32,280
improvements.

143
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:33,840
Linode.com slash LAN.

144
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:38,000
Go there to get $100 in 60 day credit on a new account and you go there to support this

145
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,200
here show.

146
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,360
Linode is definitely the Linux geeks cloud.

147
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:45,040
They've got 11 data centers worldwide and they've been hard at work in making Linode

148
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:49,960
the best experience for 19 years and they started with a passion for Linux.

149
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:55,360
And this week I've had a whole new appreciation for getting a passion around databases.

150
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:57,680
Just critical to the applications we run.

151
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:58,680
And now I get it.

152
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:01,840
Now I see why Linode has been rolling out hosted MySQL services.

153
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:03,760
I got to say I'm super tempted.

154
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:10,000
It just it's nice to have the experience, the performance and the reliability of Linode.

155
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
You know I mean I could sit here and tell you too it's like they're great support.

156
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,280
It's really all of those things.

157
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:18,120
They just are fantastic and they're always rolling out new features and getting better

158
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:19,120
than ever.

159
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:22,240
So go grab $100 in credit and try it out for yourself.

160
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:23,880
See why we like it so much.

161
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:28,520
From the best customer support, super fast networking and a Linux culture that runs deep,

162
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:30,400
there's a lot of great reasons to choose Linode.

163
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:31,440
So put it over the top.

164
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,440
Linode dot com slash LAN.

165
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:38,800
Support the show and get $100 in credit.

166
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,480
Linux dot ting dot com.

167
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:42,440
Are you sick of overpaying for your cell service?

168
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:43,440
I know I was.

169
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:46,840
So go see how much you could save and then take $25 off of that.

170
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:50,640
Linux dot ting dot com, they're a mobile virtual network operator, so they're focusing

171
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:55,920
on the customer relationship, the value, the great plans, not digging the holes, not letting

172
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:56,920
the pockets of the regulators.

173
00:11:56,920 --> 00:12:00,880
None of that stuff the duopolies have to do, but they get access to the big nationwide

174
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:03,580
networks and they have great customer service.

175
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:08,240
In fact Ting was just recently named the number one carrier by Consumer Reports in 2021 and

176
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:09,800
their plans are simple and straightforward.

177
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:15,000
It's one of the reasons why I've been a customer since 2013 and indeed their customer support

178
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
has come through when I have needed it.

179
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,600
And I love the fact there's no contracts, so for some reason it actually makes me want

180
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:21,600
to stick around more.

181
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:24,320
And it's simple to switch to Ting just about any phone's going to work.

182
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:25,320
So go try it.

183
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:26,960
Linux dot ting dot com.

184
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:28,520
Mobile's never been simpler.

185
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:29,760
It's how it should be.

186
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:34,440
Linux dot ting dot com.

187
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:41,400
With the release of Lutris 0.5.10 and the release of the Steam Deck in general, a debate

188
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:44,840
seems to be brewing in the community.

189
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:51,240
One that goes to the core of the Linux user experience and asks the fundamental question,

190
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:54,840
who are we building the desktop for?

191
00:12:54,840 --> 00:13:01,280
This was all kind of sparked by the developer of Lutris himself, Matthew Commandon.

192
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:06,780
In a tweet he said quote, we gotta stop this culture of only install flat packs, using

193
00:13:06,780 --> 00:13:13,960
root is dangerous, before it extends beyond the Steam Deck.

194
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:20,560
One thing I want is for desktop Linux to become like Android or Chrome OS.

195
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:25,480
And then later on he continued, on flat pack, apps don't have permission to access your

196
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:26,480
stuff.

197
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:29,080
It renders them much less useful than native ones.

198
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:34,520
I have a command to run to give all flat packs permissions to the whole file system to circumvent

199
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:35,520
this issue.

200
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:41,900
I'll add this, I think, you know, Matthew joined us in Linux Unplugged episode 399.

201
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:45,760
And I still reflect back on that conversation pretty frequently.

202
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:50,360
And I believe from what I know of Matthew, he has users best interest in mind here.

203
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:55,080
He doesn't want to take away power, just in the name of making things easier, safer.

204
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:58,920
He's probably amongst the crowd that really believes there's a way to strike the balance

205
00:13:58,920 --> 00:13:59,920
here.

206
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:03,680
And I think that's, I think that's actually a pretty reasonable position.

207
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:09,640
But I gotta say the reaction from the community was a lot stronger than I expected.

208
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:15,240
Yeah, there have been more than a few hot takes in the last couple days.

209
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:20,600
It kind of seems like we're getting back to something of a classic debate, though.

210
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:27,320
You know, the free software community has limited time and limited resources, and we

211
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:30,560
have to choose how we spend them.

212
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:35,720
Do we build things for expert users, for ourselves, for the users who are here and passionate

213
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:39,560
and know how to get things going themselves who can already put up with the state of

214
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:40,960
desktop Linux?

215
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:45,920
Or do we spend that time building for what we hope is the next million users, you know,

216
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:50,040
folks who have different requirements, and who might need a little more help?

217
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:51,760
Yeah, that's probably it.

218
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:56,680
It's not really a flat pack or snaps or universal apps are bad debate.

219
00:14:56,680 --> 00:15:00,100
I mean, that might be the context right now.

220
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:05,040
But it's it's really a debate about making desktop Linux more or less like Chrome OS

221
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:06,120
or Android.

222
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:11,160
And I think the thing that's new here is the deck is an irritant to this debate.

223
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:15,160
It's forcing our community to take a look at this issue again in a new way.

224
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:19,660
Yeah, once again, we walk down this path of Oh, gosh, look, it's Linux.

225
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:23,360
It's trying to be deployed desktop Linux out in the field.

226
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:27,440
But yeah, like with Android, like with Chrome OS, it also kind of makes us a little uncomfortable

227
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:30,200
because it's, well, it's not how we would do it.

228
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:33,720
It's not how we would build the systems we'd make for ourselves.

229
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:38,300
There's also of course, sort of the tertiary discussion around just security on the desktop

230
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:41,820
in general, we've seen these other platforms kind of, you know, take a new approach where

231
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:46,040
they are adding a lot more sandboxing and then having to, to build up new abstractions

232
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:48,440
and protocols to help share information.

233
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:55,320
So we don't have to do workarounds like granting everything access to the whole system.

234
00:15:55,320 --> 00:16:01,080
But you know, I do think we should acknowledge those are those are good goals, at least in

235
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:05,360
my opinion, but we haven't finished building that world.

236
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:08,400
We're not all the way in the same place say iOS is.

237
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:11,520
And it means that, you know, it can be tricky to get right.

238
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:15,040
And even if it is a safer system for users, doesn't mean that they're still gonna be able

239
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:16,960
to do everything that they want to.

240
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:18,960
Yeah, that's a good point, too.

241
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:24,200
It's like you can build a system very much like how iOS or Android have built it.

242
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:30,640
But then you also have to have this just complex ecosystem of API's and ways of accommodating

243
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:33,400
rich application development in such a locked down system.

244
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:37,360
And we could get there, but it's going to have to be more than XTG portals, right?

245
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:41,280
And I just don't know if we'll actually have the resources to make that a complete usable

246
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:42,560
environment.

247
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:48,480
But at the same time, like I don't have anything against one particular project or company

248
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:53,380
given a go at doing this, you know, let's let Valve have a go and see how it turns out.

249
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:57,520
It's one of the reasons I'm so curious about getting my hands on Steam OS 3 and running

250
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:58,520
it on a PC.

251
00:16:58,520 --> 00:16:59,900
What is that like?

252
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:02,480
How long can I survive on a system that's read only?

253
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,400
I'm really curious about that.

254
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:07,040
And I want to see them experiment.

255
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:10,060
And I just think that this is just getting to be really uncomfortable for some folks

256
00:17:10,060 --> 00:17:15,520
in the community now, because, like, there's users here now on this kind of platform.

257
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:17,060
They want Lutris.

258
00:17:17,060 --> 00:17:19,920
And I can totally see where Matthew's coming from.

259
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:25,320
And the uncomfortable fact is, well, these more locked down devices that run Linux, like

260
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:31,280
the Chrome OS devices, like the Android devices, they they seem to be wildly popular amongst

261
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:32,280
consumers.

262
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:33,280
Right.

263
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:36,680
And we're just sitting here going, but but it's not really that great.

264
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:39,800
And for some for some customers, it absolutely is.

265
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:41,080
But let them have it.

266
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:46,280
You know, as long as we continue to have choice in the Linux distro ecosystem, I don't think

267
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:47,600
this is going to be a problem.

268
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:52,640
Yeah, we're not yet at a spot where, you know, having switched things to read write means

269
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:55,640
that the anti-cheat stops working.

270
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:56,640
That would get me concerned.

271
00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:02,280
But, you know, just having it write only to start with, I think we can work with that.

272
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:08,100
And if not, well, you can put whatever Linux distro you want on there.

273
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:09,100
Very true, Wes.

274
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:13,440
And if one thing will always remain a constant, there's always going to be someone out there

275
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:14,440
scratching an itch.

276
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:19,520
So there will always be choice, even for the most nichey of niches.

277
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:20,800
And we'll keep an eye on all of them.

278
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:22,520
So why don't you keep an eye on us?

279

And last call, our East Coast Meetup is this weekend as we record details at Meetup.com

283
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:42,240
slash Jupiter Broadcasting.

284
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:47,760
We'll be back next week with our take on the latest Linux and open source news.

285
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:48,760
Thanks for joining us.

286
00:18:48,760 --> 00:19:04,680
And that's all the news for this week.
