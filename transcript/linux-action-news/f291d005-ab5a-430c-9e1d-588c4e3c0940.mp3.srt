00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,560
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, episode 132, recorded on November 17th, 2019. I'm

2
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:10,560
Chris.

3
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:11,560
And I'm Joe.

4
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:14,840
Hello, Joe. Good to be connected with you and good to be back here in the seat. And

5
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:18,200
we start things out with huge news from Docker.

6
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:23,120
Two bits of news, really. The first is that Mirantis has acquired Docker Enterprise. And

7
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:29,720
the second is that Docker has somewhat restructured and secured $35 million worth of investment.

8
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:34,780
Yeah, okay. So Mirantis, they're a prominent open stack in Kubernetes cloud company. They

9
00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:40,460
acquired the Enterprise product line from Docker, the developers for that product line,

10
00:00:40,460 --> 00:00:46,560
the sales associates, the support staff, the general aspects of the business, sans, I would

11
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:52,420
imagine a few individuals, right over to Mirantis. And this deal is effective immediately. The

12
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:57,420
CEO and co-founder of Mirantis said in an email, quote, we're not disclosing the terms

13
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:03,520
of the deal. The deal closes Wednesday, November 12, in the morning 2019. So it's already done

14
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:04,740
as we record this.

15
00:01:04,740 --> 00:01:09,360
I think you've buried the lead on what they managed to buy here. Because the most important

16
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:13,200
bit is the 750 Enterprise customers that they bought.

17
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:19,240
Is it 750 is a lot of customers for like, if I was doing a business, for sure. Like

18
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:26,560
if I had, you know, Fishnets, as my container company, sure, that's a lot. But if I'm Docker,

19
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:33,020
seems like 750 isn't a ton. Now, the thing is, about 130 of those are huge, ginormous

20
00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:37,460
Enterprise customers. So they're, they're big customers. So they're very valuable customers.

21
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:41,760
And it's a good starting point. We've been wondering on the show, what was going to happen

22
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:46,760
next with Docker, we've noted their struggles to raise funding to define their product.

23
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:51,560
Everyone's managed to make money off Docker, except Docker. And looking at this, it seems

24
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:57,320
like they've figured out a new strategy. And it's developers, developers, developers. Because

25
00:01:57,320 --> 00:02:03,080
looking at this, it seems like the split is the closed source stuff is going with Mirantis.

26
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:07,080
And the open source stuff is staying with Docker proper. And they're going to refocus

27
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:12,000
as a developer workflow, and applications tooling company.

28
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,160
But I don't understand how they managed to get $35 million for that. I don't understand

29
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:21,320
the business model. They didn't have a successful business model before. And now they've sold

30
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:26,800
the only bit that was making them any money. And somehow they managed to raise $35 million

31
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:31,560
worth of VC. For what? How are they going to make money out of that?

32
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:36,320
Well, the funding came from Steve Ballmer, who's focused on funding companies who focus

33
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:40,520
on develop... Okay, all right, too much. No, they got actually the money from Benchmark

34
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:46,280
Capital and Insight Partners. 35 million is no joke, for sure. That's a lot of money.

35
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:52,520
I think it is the defining, quote unquote, of the company, like redefining around development

36
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:57,800
workflow. In their announcement, they write, Today, we start the next chapter in the Docker

37
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:03,480
story, one that is focused on developers. And then later on in the post, they note,

38
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:09,240
Docker's focus is to build on these foundations to advance developer workflows for modern

39
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:15,260
apps. I think they truly see themselves as the de facto server application distribution

40
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:22,740
platform. Write in your environment, guarantee it works, Docker it all up, and ship it off

41
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:28,360
to your customers. Customers being a loose definition of anybody who's the consumer of

42
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:29,360
what you're making.

43
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:34,800
Right. And I don't see any reason why Docker won't continue to be well used, but I don't

44
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:37,080
see any revenue model there.

45
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:47,240
Yeah, I have to agree with you. I wish I could come up with something. Dang it, Joe.

46
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:52,560
Mirantis have said that they will continue to support the Docker Enterprise products.

47
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:58,720
But with Docker Swarm, the orchestration software, they're only committing to two years of that

48
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:05,400
support. So it seems like the plan is to kind of shepherd those customers over to Kubernetes,

49
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:07,840
which is what most of the industry is doing anyway, right?

50
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:13,920
Yeah, they talk about joining their technology with Kubernetes and bringing, quote, simplicity

51
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:21,640
and choice to enterprises with a cloud first mandate, end quote. So I think Kubernetes

52
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:27,160
has won this round is what is happening here. It'll give them a nice transition path likely

53
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:31,360
if you're using Docker Swarm. And you still got two years of support. And in their frequently

54
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:36,000
asked questions, if you want to get support tomorrow morning when you're at work, you

55
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,720
just call the same rep you've always called. They'll still answer the phone. They're still

56
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:45,800
working for them. And that's great for those people. A lot of times, some of these mergers,

57
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:50,680
some of these positions, like the sales positions and the support positions, they get reduced

58
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:54,800
because there's redundancy. So it's nice to see that if you've been working with a rep

59
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:59,720
for the last couple of years, that same reps going to answer the phone, at least they say.

60
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:05,240
Here we are another day, another speculative execution vulnerability. Two, in fact.

61
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:09,640
Yeah, Joe, we're getting two for the price of one this week. I think Intel's feeling

62
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:15,160
the holiday spirit. Two different speculative execution attacks. We don't always bring these

63
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:21,000
up. But these ones are noteworthy, both in what they do, but also in just the depth of

64
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:26,960
which Intel has to try to patch this thing. So let's talk about these two bucks. So Riddle

65
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:32,800
and Fallout, the attacks leak data by exploding four newly discovered micro architectural

66
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:41,280
data sampling side channel vulnerabilities, or MDS is for short, in Intel CPUs. Unlike

67
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:45,660
existing attacks, we've talked about before these new attacks leak arbitrary in flight

68
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:53,000
data from CPU internal buffers, including data that was never stored in CPU caches.

69
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:57,880
In the research, they show that existing defenses against speculative execution attacks are

70
00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:05,400
inadequate. And in some cases, they actually make things worse attackers can use the leaked

71
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:10,880
sensitive data despite the mitigations in place. And due to vulnerabilities, they're

72
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:16,880
so deep inside the CPU, they can get access to quite a bit. For an example, the Fallout

73
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:21,520
attack can be used to break kernel address space layout randomization, which is a big

74
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:26,840
one for getting access to information in RAM. They also show the riddle defense can allow

75
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:31,680
unprivileged code on machines as with recent CPUs that are patched that can execute that

76
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:37,600
code. It's really bad because the fix is more than just a simple firmware thing. And in

77
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:42,840
some of these, we thought this was already addressed. But now here we are. And it turns

78
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:46,720
out not all of this was as fixed as Intel might have led us to believe.

79
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:52,120
We've been talking about these since late 2017, early 2018. And there have been a lot

80
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:58,480
of these different attacks and vulnerabilities. But there's always been a kind of theoretical

81
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:05,840
element to them and a weighing up of the risk of do you really need to apply the patches,

82
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:12,360
depending on the workload that you're using? And I think Intel have kind of hoped that

83
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:16,660
it would just sort of go away and people would just think, well, this theoretical risk is

84
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:21,980
there, but it's a pretty small risk. But now with the latest round of vulnerabilities,

85
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:27,800
it's starting to feel a bit more real and a bit of a higher risk. And maybe Intel's

86
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:34,620
strategy of not fixing this at the hardware level quickly, and maybe even delaying the

87
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:39,000
new generations of their chips until they'd fixed it. Maybe that is turning out to be

88
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,160
not such a great idea.

89
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:47,700
So I see it as two things. It's possible Intel is working on the next generation that solves

90
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:54,080
a lot of this at the hardware level, but it's a little ways out and they don't want to hurt

91
00:07:54,080 --> 00:08:00,220
sales of existing products in the pipeline. That's possible. Or it's possible that Intel

92
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:06,360
is just planning to try to fix this with software and then get the speed up over time. And I

93
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:10,300
think that was the one that none of us thought would actually be their long term play. We

94
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:14,880
all kind of thought, OK, that'd be the move for the processors on the market right now.

95
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:19,560
But by the time 2020 is around, we'll have a new architecture, some improvements that

96
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:22,960
will fix this and everything will be good. And these software patches will be just a

97
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,680
thing of these generations.

98
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:29,800
Now it looks like that might have been wishful thinking. And it's not like Intel can just

99
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:36,220
reinvent this overnight. These are things they've built up over many, many generations.

100
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:42,240
So software has been made with assumptions that some of these features are in place.

101
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:46,600
Maybe Intel has looked at it and said, this is the only route. Better make sure everybody

102
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:51,380
is using LVFS or something similar.

103
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:55,640
But the way they've treated the security researchers is not great, really.

104
00:08:55,640 --> 00:09:00,860
Yeah, that is concerning. Yeah. And also the open source community. They've made some improvements

105
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:06,860
in a lot of ways, but projects are still not super happy. And just recently, Greg KH from

106
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:10,680
the kernel was talking about how if you really, truly want to be secure, not only do you need

107
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:14,440
all these microcode fixes, but you also just need to turn off hyperthreading.

108
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:20,720
Yeah, which significantly impacts performance and just makes your cloud instances much more

109
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,160
expensive to run.

110
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:27,060
Yeah. When Intel does a release like this, they work with 300 different organizations

111
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:31,040
to prepare and coordinate the release of their own spins of Intel's updates. They have a

112
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:35,400
whole ecosystem of partners. But then you think about it, they have a stack of software.

113
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:40,160
It's not just CPU microcode, but there's also microcode in the GPU and in the different

114
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:45,260
buses. There's like chips in there, Joe. They all need updates, like all kinds of chips

115
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:47,360
that do different things. They call it the microchip.

116
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:53,020
Yeah, and we're talking about an operating system on these CPUs, essentially. It's basically

117
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:55,240
a computer within your computer.

118
00:09:55,240 --> 00:10:01,840
It's crazy. And so they're coordinating across all of these different companies, across these

119
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:07,760
software stacks, and trying to patch this thing and go after it. And they kind of implied

120
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:11,820
six months ago that some of this stuff was fixed that turns out now isn't. We'll have

121
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:16,620
some links in the show notes for lots of good details. I actually encourage some homework

122
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:20,600
on this one because the MDS attacks are pretty interesting. You can go read that directly

123
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:26,680
at mdsattacks.com. They have a really quick write up. It's not super flashy. They're not

124
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:31,240
like trying to sell merch. It's just some solid research from some universities and

125
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:33,920
a little bit of corporate research too.

126
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:37,520
Well maybe one solution is just to switch to ARM, and that's at the heart of the Pine

127
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:41,400
Phone, which you can now buy, at least as we record.

128
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:47,280
The Braveheart Edition, which they stress is a limited edition aimed solely for developers

129
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:52,560
and early adopters, those who like to tinker. It's called the Braveheart Edition, and I

130
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:58,000
love it. They say estimated dispatches in late December, early January 2020.

131
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,560
You're saying this is for people who like to mess with computers.

132
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:08,320
I think it is indeed. I pre-ordered one, $150 US greenbacks as we record. A couple of notable

133
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:14,960
things about it. It has a 1440 by 720 screen with an 18 by 9 aspect ratio. It's got a 64

134
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:20,160
bit quad core, 1.2 gigahertz ARM, Cortex A53, and a Mali 400 GPU.

135
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:26,400
Yeah, this is pretty low end, but it's designed to run proper Linux, things like Ubuntu Touch

136
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:29,760
or Postmarket OS. That's what makes this stand out.

137
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:34,240
Yeah, in fact, it won't even ship with an OS. They write on here, various open source

138
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:41,800
mainline Linux or BSD mobile OSes. Various. It's quaint. Pick your own, and you could.

139
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:47,160
It's got 16 gigabytes of eMMC. It also has a microSD, so you can go up to two terabytes.

140
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:50,740
It's got two gigabytes of RAM, so you could probably pretty comfortably run a lot of mobile

141
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:56,680
operating systems. I think I'd probably go for Ubuntu Touch, my first attempt. I love

142
00:11:56,680 --> 00:12:02,020
that it has USB-C for both charging, but also it does DisplayPort out of that. You could

143
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:03,800
even try some conversion section.

144
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:07,360
Yeah, and it's even got a 3.5 mil headphone jack.

145
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:09,360
How did they do that? Holy smokes.

146
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:15,040
How did they fit that in there? I mean, this is not going to take on the latest iPhone

147
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:20,040
or Android phone. It's not designed for that. The whole point of it is, it's basically a

148
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:24,840
development device. It's a device for people who just want to tinker with the likes of

149
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:32,000
Ubuntu Touch. It's kind of like almost a reference device for that. It's cheap, it's low spec,

150
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:37,120
and it's all about the community in terms of the software for it. Pine are going to

151
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:42,240
make the hardware as usual, and it's up to the community to put software on it.

152
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:46,440
I've always dreamed of a line of mobile phones that you could load your own OS on like you

153
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:52,440
can on a PC. The PC isn't perfectly free, but you can load just about any compatible

154
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:57,640
operating system you want. It's an open platform in that sense. I see a world where you and

155
00:12:57,640 --> 00:13:00,960
I both have the same hardware, but we're running two different operating systems.

156
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:06,240
Yeah, I could see that happening. I've ordered mine, so we will actually potentially be in

157
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:08,960
that situation where we're both running different operating systems then.

158
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:12,920
I guess so. I guess it won't be theoretical so soon. I think that's what I love about

159
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:19,400
the Pine phone. It brings that down to a really approachable price. I could easily see them

160
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:23,120
bringing that up over time as they get the device sorted, and they get the software sorted,

161
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:28,440
and hardware refined. There's so much potential here. That's why we reached out to Lucas.

162
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:33,880
We're going to have him on Linux Unplugged this week, on Tuesday's episode of Linux Unplugged,

163
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:41,040
which will be episode 328, linuxunplugged.com. Don't go there yet, because there won't be

164
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:42,920
anything, but in a couple of days there will.

165
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:45,640
Maybe by the time you're listening, depending on when you catch this, or if you're way in

166
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:47,120
the future, it's totally there.

167
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:51,280
Well, they call it the Braveheart edition, and it's not the only Brave thing in the news

168
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:52,840
this week.

169
00:13:52,840 --> 00:14:01,000
No, Brave has hit version 1.0. The Brave open source browser is out of beta.

170
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:05,680
If we had a klaxon, I think it would sound at this point, blockchain, blockchain, blockchain.

171
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:08,080
That's what this browser seems to all be about.

172
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:13,360
Oh, okay, maybe a little bit. But they've kind of done it in a pretty slick way. So

173
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:18,480
the blockchain is used for their BAT token, which is a unit of your attention. And it's

174
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:23,420
also they use some sort of blockchain system for their syncing. So you link devices to

175
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:29,040
a chain, and then they all sync amongst each other. That's really a cool way to do it.

176
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:37,320
But the core of Brave is they are trying to find a way to monetize for creators in a way

177
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:42,920
that doesn't violate privacy. And it isn't creepy. While building all of that into a

178
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:47,000
really optimized, fast, blink-based browser.

179
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:51,160
I kind of went all in over the weekend to test it for the story. I've never used their

180
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:57,560
monetization stuff. And I thought, well, I'll give it a go. And it's not bad. They've done

181
00:14:57,560 --> 00:15:03,240
it in sort of a tasteful way. You can opt into certain ads. The selection is all done

182
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:09,800
on device. It's not tracking you to do it. And you earn these points that you can tip

183
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:16,120
creators with. So say, late night Linux was on there. Somebody who went to your website

184
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:23,820
a lot could accumulate these tokens by viewing the private ads. And then they could tip those

185
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:29,820
to you. You can then, with one of their partners, actually convert that into currency in your

186
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:31,260
local neck of the woods.

187
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:37,000
Which is something I've thought about before, but it just always seemed a bit of a pipe

188
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,680
dream. Like, you're not really going to make that much money out of it. And it's not really

189
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:43,960
worth it as a publisher to go through the effort of setting it up.

190
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:46,160
If it got to a certain scale, I could see it.

191
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:50,520
Yeah, I think there's a certain critical mass of users that would have to get there. And

192
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:56,040
you have to be an early adopter at some point. But I used this browser to do all my research

193
00:15:56,040 --> 00:16:01,000
for this episode of Linux Session News. And went through the setup and everything. And

194
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:06,920
it was pretty nice. And I could select the dark mode. And it was a nice browser to use.

195
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:13,240
I didn't initially set up the reward stuff. But then I thought, well, I'll give that a

196
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:17,840
go. And I tried to enable it. And then I just started to get all these notifications just

197
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:23,040
for random stuff that just annoyed me. And I had a bit of a bad experience with it. I

198
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:28,920
must say I had a good experience with the browser. The browser itself is lean, works

199
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:35,720
well. I mean, it's Chromium blink based. So what do you expect? It worked perfectly. But

200
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:40,840
when I started to go into that value add stuff, it just felt a bit spammy to me.

201
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:44,360
Yeah, I found it better on the desktop. I found it a little too much on the mobile,

202
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:50,160
so I was glad to see you could turn it down. Well, my experience was a lot more positive

203
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:57,860
than I expected. I've tried a many blink based browsers. And also I spent a lot of time which

204
00:16:57,860 --> 00:17:04,680
is Chrome and Chromium. I am a very happy Firefox user except for a handful of websites

205
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:12,940
I use that just work better under Chrome. They often have to do with audio and video.

206
00:17:12,940 --> 00:17:17,520
And they just work better under Chrome. And I keep slipping back to Chrome. And it is

207
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:22,880
something that truly does bother me because I do feel like it's too invasive. It knows

208
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:28,920
too much about what I'm doing. Brave does everything Chrome does for me. Everything's

209
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:35,440
just as compatible. All of the extensions I like work. But none of the shame of using

210
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:38,680
the Google tracking product. And that's why I was kind of impressed with the way they

211
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:44,000
do the sync system. I was impressed with the speed. It seems to use less memory than Chrome

212
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:51,020
does. For me, it's now the number one competitor to Firefox. They're doing and talking a lot

213
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:54,800
of the same walk that Firefox is now, but they've been doing this for years. I mean,

214
00:17:54,800 --> 00:18:00,320
they're talking about building in automatic tracker blocking, brave shields. There's just

215
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:07,640
like a heavy focus, a real intentional focus on privacy and security. A lot of what we're

216
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:12,200
hearing coming out of Mozilla now, including surprise, surprise, a built in VPN.

217
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:17,160
Well, we're talking about this coming out of beta finally getting to a 1.0. But the

218
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:24,160
reality is this has been around since 2016, early 2016. And Mozilla have been watching

219
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:29,560
it and copying some of the features and all the good stuff we've been saying about Firefox

220
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:36,760
over the last year or so, with the privacy stuff, blocking of tracking. A lot of that

221
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:43,320
has been inspired at least by brave. That's kind of good enough for me. I'm invested heavily

222
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:51,080
in Firefox. And so I can't see myself switching to brave. I can see myself having it installed

223
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:55,960
as a kind of secondary browser. But I do wonder whether it'll be able to do quite everything

224
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:56,960
that Chrome does.

225
00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:00,840
Yeah, I agree. I don't think there's anything here that's going to draw people away from

226
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:06,480
Firefox that are really longtime Firefox users. And Mozilla is making the right moves

227
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:13,960
to sort of catch up. But there is some real nipping of the heels here. So with version

228
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:21,280
1.0, here's some interesting stats. They have 3 million active users on a daily basis. That's

229
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:29,080
a lot. When they last measured, they had 8.7 million monthly active users overall. And

230
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:35,160
they've just released 1.0 on Android, iOS, Windows 10, Mac OS, Linux, all the platforms.

231
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:40,500
They just did a nice, solid execution of a really solid 1.0. So they're kind of just

232
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:44,500
getting started. I know we've talked about brave a lot. One of the things that caught

233
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:48,480
my attention was when they switched off of running on Electron. That was a huge move

234
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:56,080
back in 2018. And then in June of 2019, they rewrote their ad blocking rule matching algorithm

235
00:19:56,080 --> 00:20:03,460
and implemented it in Rust. And there's claims that things like 69 times faster than implementations

236
00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:12,080
that are in C++. And they used the algorithms of uBlock Origin and Ghostery, two of my favorites,

237
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:16,760
to kind of design their algorithm. Only it's crazy fast. There's just things about brave

238
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:22,440
that for Chrome users are very compelling. And I think that's who their market is, is

239
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:27,000
this is a Chrome browser without the shame and a lot of nice privacy stuff built in.

240
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:33,400
And maybe, given the heritage of this project, a possible way to monetize creators. Because

241
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:38,360
it's not slouches involved with this project either. There's real experience behind this

242
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:39,360
browser.

243
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:43,440
Well, yeah. Brendan Eich, who was a co-founder of Mozilla and invented JavaScript, we're

244
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:48,040
talking about someone who has some very serious experience in this area.

245
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:52,240
And they're executing really well. I was really impressed. The last time I checked in with

246
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:55,300
brave, I was like, oh, yeah, it's nice. And I didn't reinstall it the next time I reloaded

247
00:20:55,300 --> 00:21:01,640
my system. So it's been since their change away from Electron that I checked it out.

248
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:07,300
So a little over a year now. And I am not installing Chrome anymore. I'm installing

249
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:09,840
brave now. I also really like the mobile app.

250
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:12,600
I didn't try the mobile app. Maybe I should give it a go.

251
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:16,160
Yeah, get a little blockchain action going there, Joe. I love me some syncing. It's just

252
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:20,420
something about doing some research like on your phone and you create a quick bookmark

253
00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:24,160
folder and you go back to your desktop to finish it up and it's all right there. And

254
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:28,400
the icons for the favicons are all in there and everything's perfect. And just I love

255
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:33,040
it. And they're not the only one to do it. But I like that it's I like this way they

256
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:35,880
link them. You'll have to you'll have to try it to see what I'm talking about. You do have

257
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:41,720
to scan a QR code from your phone on your screen. Here's a little bit of manual process.

258
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:44,360
But it feels feels really well done.

259
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:50,060
Well, a launch that looks like it's not going to go very well is Google's stadia game streaming

260
00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:55,480
service, which is supposed to be happening pretty much as you listen to this. Now, Chris,

261
00:21:55,480 --> 00:22:00,200
you preordered the founders edition. Are you excited for this?

262
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:04,660
I still am. However, I kind of agree with the verges headline, the whole world is waiting

263
00:22:04,660 --> 00:22:09,360
for stadia to flop. It's a real issue for Google because it's one of these services

264
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:13,640
that's going to take a couple of years to fully mature from a game development standpoint,

265
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:18,800
but also from just a service feature standpoint. But I bet you a lot of people don't even think

266
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:23,140
this thing will last two years because of Google's reputation for killing projects.

267
00:22:23,140 --> 00:22:26,920
And then when it when it comes to something where you're going to buy games and they're

268
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:35,280
going to be in a library that's in stadia, it really gets kind of uncomfortable because

269
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:41,960
there's a lack of trust that Google will keep this thing around. And it looks like on launch,

270
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:48,240
it's not quite what we were expecting. Chrome gameplay won't support 4k HDR or five one

271
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:52,800
surround they'll be added in updates later. So that sort of stinks because that's how

272
00:22:52,800 --> 00:23:00,280
I was planning to play. This is via Intel graphics laptops on Linux in a Chrome browser.

273
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:04,240
So I won't get full resolution. That's a little unfortunate. There's other things that don't

274
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:08,280
work like some of the sharing features for me. The one that bothers me the most is family

275
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:13,140
sharing won't be available. It won't be supported on day one. So you'll have to buy each game

276
00:23:13,140 --> 00:23:17,320
for each of your kids. This is going to be a big thing for me is I have family sharing

277
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:23,400
across my Google accounts. It was implied that this would be a supported feature. And

278
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:27,360
it simply isn't. It's really kind of, I don't know, it's a little underwhelming. Also, I

279
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:31,720
probably the number one killer thing, Joe is they're only going to have 12 games that

280
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:32,720
launch.

281
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:37,320
Yeah, that's not ideal. And you've got that Nvidia shield in the living room area in the

282
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:42,360
studio with that enormous TV and the nice sound system, everything. You're not going

283
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:44,120
to be able to use it on that straight away.

284
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:49,880
Now, I can unplug my shield and hook up the Chromecast Ultra that comes with the Founders

285
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:54,240
Edition. That's another issue, by the way. Other Chromecast Ultra units that are in the

286
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:57,900
market today, they're out in the field that people own, they won't play Stadia games.

287
00:23:57,900 --> 00:24:03,160
My Chromecast Ultra will, but existing Ultras will not until an over the air update comes

288
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:10,400
along sometime after the launch of Stadia. It's just not great. Now the dozen games thing,

289
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:14,740
the reason why I think that's so low, this is my speculation, but it's because they are

290
00:24:14,740 --> 00:24:19,720
requiring developers to make modifications to the game. They're not just taking straight

291
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:24,660
PC or console ports, which some YouTubers are reporting. They are actually having development

292
00:24:24,660 --> 00:24:31,720
shops modify the games to work with the Stadia system. And that, that's really hard. I watched

293
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:36,960
a lot of interviews with different members of the Stadia team. And I think what happened

294
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:41,080
here is they engineered the hell out of this thing. They came up with some incredible solutions

295
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:45,880
to solve latency. They came up with some great tricks to run the games faster on the server,

296
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:50,520
but still send you 60 frames a second so they can be ahead of you. They really ironed out

297
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:57,640
some Herculean and coding issues that are magic. But in doing all of this, I don't really

298
00:24:57,640 --> 00:25:03,000
think they focused on game partnerships and development shop partnerships. And so where

299
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:07,680
the Microsoft service, when it launches, we'll launch with more than 50 titles. Stadia is

300
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:12,600
going to launch tomorrow with a dozen. And I don't know for sure, but I bet a lot of

301
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:16,400
them would probably just work under Proton and I wouldn't need this.

302
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:21,280
Yeah, I think that what we've got here is Google wanting to be first to market because

303
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:27,940
that's always very important. And the xCloud service from Microsoft is still in preview.

304
00:25:27,940 --> 00:25:32,440
And so it hasn't officially launched, whereas Stadia will launch tomorrow. It will be the

305
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:38,240
first to market of the big players at least. Obviously, there's been plenty of game streaming

306
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:44,160
services in the past that have just not really worked out and ultimately failed. But of the

307
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:49,680
big players, they're going to be first. And maybe it's just not ready. I mean, it certainly

308
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:50,920
sounds that way.

309
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:58,760
I know it sounds crazy, but I had a great experience with OnLive back in 2010. It worked

310
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:02,800
great for me. And I've used other streaming services. There's one on my NVIDIA Shield

311
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:07,680
and it's been fantastic for me. I played like a whole Batman game and it was fun. We really

312
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:13,640
enjoyed it. Never had to download any software, never had to try to load a Windows Proton

313
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:17,080
environment. It's just great. It worked and I loved it. Never concerned, never had an

314
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:22,720
issue with lag. And those are existing services that are on the market today. Google has quite

315
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:27,080
the networking infrastructure. So they could, from a networking standpoint, they can really

316
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:31,800
pull this thing off. But something else that they're doing, which is very clever, is because

317
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:37,760
they have the horsepower. They're running these games at 120 frames per second and they're

318
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:45,160
sending you 60. So they're using that difference to compensate for lag or to figure out what

319
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:52,320
you're doing next. They're ahead of you, essentially. And it's just enough of a window that they

320
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:57,600
can do some really cool tech. And you could see how they could integrate this across their

321
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:03,080
product line with Android, with YouTube. So you're watching a play through on YouTube

322
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:07,720
and one link in the show description and now you're playing the game inside your browser.

323
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:13,000
The Chromebooks, this turns all Chromebooks into gaming machines overnight once this thing's

324
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:17,360
done. There's a lot of tie-ins across their entire ecosystem with Google Play and Google

325
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:21,200
Store credits and all of that where you can use Google Play credits to buy games that

326
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:25,000
you can play on Stadia. If they don't make this work, it's shameful.

327
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:31,160
Yeah. And if they don't make it work, then is this finally curtains for the idea of it?

328
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:36,160
Because as you say, you had good experiences before, but the economics just did not make

329
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:43,040
sense. How much is just one GPU? Hundreds of dollars. And in order to have all of that

330
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:48,600
infrastructure, there's so much investment there that they're not going to get back directly

331
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:54,120
through revenue. So they're going to have to monetize it in other ways. And maybe that's

332
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:58,400
where everyone else failed and maybe Google will succeed because they can just mine data

333
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:03,880
and somehow make more money out of it. But it just seems like the whole concept is just

334
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:05,680
doomed to failure to me.

335
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:11,200
Keep in mind, the free version of Stadia doesn't launch until sometime next year. In my mind,

336
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:14,320
that's when the rubber really has to meet the road. That's when the service becomes

337
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:18,600
available to everyone, is once it goes free. You'll have to pay for games, although there'll

338
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:22,440
probably be a couple that are decent that are included for free. But that's really when

339
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:27,500
this thing goes live. This is like a pre-launch. You've had to pay for a founder's edition.

340
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:31,800
They're trickling the shipments out. They're not landing on launch day like the impression

341
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:36,160
was. Mine doesn't show up until somewhere between December 2nd and December 8th or something

342
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:37,160
like that.

343
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:39,520
What, you mean a Google employee is not going to drive it to your house?

344
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:42,960
You heard about that. Yeah, that's rough. Yeah, that's how... There's just been a lot

345
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:47,720
of... Google has a hard time shipping, as they put it, atoms. As they say, they're great

346
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:53,480
at bits, and they struggle with shipping atoms. Fair enough. It does seem to be the case.

347
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:59,460
I don't know what their deal is. I think if they stick with this thing for the long term,

348
00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:03,340
they really could have something. If they integrate it across all of the Google products,

349
00:29:03,340 --> 00:29:08,260
they make it simple to game from Chrome and YouTube, easy to link people right to a state

350
00:29:08,260 --> 00:29:12,240
in a game, all of the stuff that they promised, they actually make their wireless controllers

351
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:17,160
truly wireless and not require a USB-C cable when you use them. There's all these things

352
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:21,000
they can do that are technically doable once this thing's a service, because they don't

353
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:25,400
have to ship you a console for any of this. It's really just a matter of them pulling

354
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:30,920
it off. If I was going to bet on one, though, I'd bet on Microsoft. I'd bet on Microsoft.

355
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:33,840
I know Sony's working on theirs, but I'd bet on Microsoft.

356
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:38,840
Yeah, I think I have to agree with you there. I do want Google to succeed with this, because

357
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:44,880
it's all run in Linux in their data centers. Ultimately, we will all as a community benefit

358
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:51,280
at least in some ways with graphics drivers and just generally upstreaming of at least

359
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:53,360
some of the stuff to make this work.

360
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:58,080
That's fundamentally it. Because Google requires that the game manufacturers make their games

361
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:03,760
run on Linux using Vulkan, the hope is it opens up a wider set of games to be published

362
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:10,040
on Linux. Stady is the streaming platform that enables that. I really, really, really,

363
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:13,440
really doubt that's the case for Sony's, and I know it's not the case for Microsoft's.

364
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:16,760
Well, you're definitely going to have to tell us all about your experiences when it does

365
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:17,760
finally arrive.

366
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:21,580
Yeah, they point out you don't have to wait for the hardware. Once it ships and you get

367
00:30:21,580 --> 00:30:26,480
your email, your account's active. It's a service, so you could go play in Chrome and

368
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:30,880
just wait for your controller to show up later. So I will, Joe. I'll play video games and

369
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:32,780
report packs so you don't have to.

370
00:30:32,780 --> 00:30:33,920
It's a hard life.

371
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:37,600
That's right. If you want to hear how that goes, go to linuxactionnews.com slash subscribe

slash 22. The gang talks about the best ways to get involved in different open source communities

376
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:57,560
and finding like-minded people. It's pretty great. It's a great resource.

377
00:30:57,560 --> 00:31:01,720
Yeah, I had a lot of fun recording that episode, even if Elle did tell me off for not preparing

378
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:03,760
properly for my conference talk.

379
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:06,840
Well, she takes that very seriously.

380
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:10,920
