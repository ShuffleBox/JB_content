00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,360
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, our weekly take on Linux and the open source world.

2
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:20,600
This is episode 78, recorded on November 4th, 2018.

3
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:21,600
I'm Chris.

4
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:22,600
And I'm Joe.

5
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:23,600
Hello, Joe.

6
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:27,980
It's great to be connected with you, and we have a week of releases.

7
00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:32,760
People have been busy since their summer break, and we kick things off with the Fedora 29

8
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:33,760
release.

9
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:34,880
Yeah, this is a big release for them.

10
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:38,800
And I think the biggest thing that jumps out at me here is the modularity that they've

11
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:39,800
now got.

12
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:40,960
This is really neat.

13
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:44,140
This is something that Wes and I had a play with before Linux Unplugged.

14
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:49,680
And the idea is you can ship different versions of packages on the same Fedora base.

15
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:54,360
So this means that you no longer need to make your whole OS upgrade just to get, say, the

16
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:55,840
latest Node.js.

17
00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:02,240
Or vice versa, when Fedora 30 comes around and you have to upgrade because of the 13-month

18
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:07,520
roughly support cycle, you don't want to have to rebuild your whole application based on

19
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:13,720
the new version of Node.js and Fedora 30 so you can install Fedora 30 base but use the

20
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:18,240
modular version to install the Fedora 29 Node.js package.

21
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:23,300
It's a little confusing, but it solves a longstanding problem on Linux that Flatpaks and Snaps have

22
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:26,520
attempted to solve, but this is at the package level.

23
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:30,840
And it also is very handy in a distribution which has a very rapid update cycle.

24
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:35,320
Well, Snaps immediately come to mind when I read about this modularity.

25
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:39,880
You say that they've been attempting to solve it, but it feels like a fairly solved problem

26
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:40,880
to me with Snaps.

27
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:45,080
And Snaps are available in Fedora, so why did they need to do it?

28
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:48,240
It's a choose-your-flavor-to-solve-the-problem kind of thing.

29
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:54,200
So Snaps and Flatpaks you could think of as really the developer is able to directly publish

30
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:56,000
the software to the end user.

31
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,560
That's a developer model of distributing software and it's pretty popular right now.

32
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:07,360
Distributing packages via a repo is really a system administrator's way to distribute

33
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:08,360
software.

34
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:10,160
That's how sysadmins would invent a system.

35
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:15,680
You can have local repositories with your own keys and all this stuff that's very much

36
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:21,120
of a system administrator's way of managing software and only root can install those packages.

37
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:27,080
Again, the system administrator and they are a very valid way of managing software, especially

38
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:28,840
on production systems.

39
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:35,300
And so this is solving that software availability issue across multiple releases from the repository

40
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:37,220
and software management standpoint.

41
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:43,480
Because you can install say that Fedora 28 version of Node.js on Fedora 29 and now it's

42
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:46,960
getting updated with security fixes as part of your DNF upgrade.

43
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:49,160
It's just all of your packages.

44
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:53,640
It is included in that and so you can manage it as you would a standard piece of software

45
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:56,040
on your Linux box from the repositories.

46
00:02:56,040 --> 00:03:00,760
Yeah, it means that you don't have to have a million block devices when you do LSBLK

47
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:03,600
to try and see where you're going to DD your ISO.

48
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,920
So it makes that a bit cleaner as well.

49
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:10,300
I suppose you're right that it is more of a sysadmin way of doing things and it's more

50
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:11,640
traditional isn't it?

51
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:15,560
It's a new take on the traditional way rather than completely reinventing the wheel like

52
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:17,700
they have with Snaps and Flatpak.

53
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:20,540
So I suppose I should be more on board with this really.

54
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:25,040
It's an impressive bit of engineering too because it required some work at the DNF level,

55
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:29,920
it required some work at the repository level and even required some work in like the namespace

56
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:30,920
area.

57
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:33,400
So it's been sort of a cross project effort.

58
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:36,480
I don't know, that's always kind of impressive to see when a distribution pulls that off

59
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:39,840
and now it's just one of the features in the new release.

60
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:44,200
And of course the desktop version has got GNOME 3.30 and various other new packages

61
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:45,200
across the board.

62
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:48,560
Right, and they also have their different images for the different spins of Fedora now.

63
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:55,440
I have Fedora Cloud up on a DigitalOcean droplet and did the upgrade from 28 to 29 and my next

64
00:03:55,440 --> 00:04:00,520
cloud instance continued perfectly fine and now we're even using that for more things.

65
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:05,640
It's been a solid system and I went in via cockpit, I installed all of the available

66
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:11,160
updates then SSHed into the box and there's some basic DNF commands that Fedora always

67
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:15,440
does a great job of documenting where you go through, you grab the new package plug-in

68
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:19,040
to do an upgrade, then you tell it what version you're upgrading to and it goes.

69
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:22,600
And then it does a system D reboot and installs all the packages and when it comes back up

70
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:24,680
you're on the new version of Fedora.

71
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:29,800
And for four or five times in a row I have successfully upgraded from one version of

72
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:32,160
Fedora Cloud to the next version of Fedora Cloud.

73
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:37,000
Yeah, well with the support cycle as short as Fedora they really have to get those upgrades

74
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,240
bulletproofed, don't they?

75
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:41,680
Right, that was always my thinking, that's why I even set up this test box to begin with

76
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:46,720
to see how far I could push it and so far they've nailed it.

77
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:52,400
Also this week Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.6 has landed, this is a bit of business as usual

78
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,720
from the Red Hat camp after the recent big news.

79
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:57,320
Yeah, it's not a hugely interesting release, is it?

80
00:04:57,320 --> 00:05:03,920
It's as you say, business as usual, it's very much enterprise and cloud and hybrid cloud,

81
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:07,800
exactly the sort of stuff we saw in the IBM announcement.

82
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:13,320
We are living in the Red Hat hybrid cloud era, the words hybrid cloud show up in this

83
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:20,060
press release 12 times, they just really want to talk about this and I guess if you really

84
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:25,520
start defining down a category, hybrid cloud to them is sort of this bridging that they

85
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:30,000
think is going to be the next 80% of cloud adoption.

86
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:35,320
Maybe it will be, IBM thinks it's a trillion dollar market that we'll see, we'll see if

87
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:43,480
this plays out and Red Hat Enterprise version 7.6 lands with the world leading support for

88
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:47,200
hybrid cloud.

89
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:51,520
Well it kind of does make sense hybrid cloud though if you take it to mean a bit of on-premises

90
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:55,880
and a bit of public cloud, that's kind of quite a logical approach, isn't it, rather

91
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:57,840
than sticking all your eggs in one basket?

92
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:02,520
I agree, yeah, I think it's funny how these words kind of just take off, we can't just

93
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:07,200
have a cloud and we can't just have a data center, can't call it hosted computing, no

94
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:11,680
now it has to be hybrid cloud and you're right, when you look it up, the definition is exactly

95
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:17,160
that, a mix of on-premises, private cloud and third party public cloud services and

96
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:21,880
that's why orchestration software is such a big deal these days and that's why when

97
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:26,080
shops like Digital Ocean announced Kubernetes support, it's a really big deal because you

98
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:31,360
can use one set of tools to manage your systems that are right there on your LAN or off in

99
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:36,660
some other country or state on a third party hosting platform, all one tool, all one set

100
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:42,560
of commands, all one set of user structures, it's pretty powerful stuff and Red Hat's pretty

101
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:49,360
well positioned here because they are a dominant player in the on-premises Linux server environment

102
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:53,480
so it makes sense that they would be a pretty good partner in this area, it's just really

103
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:54,480
in your face.

104
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:58,840
Yeah, I think you mean IBM slash Red Hat as well, we've covered this.

105
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:05,160
Yeah, yeah, and to sort of try to make some hay from all of this hoopla around IBM and

106
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:07,560
Red Hat, the register had a bit of fun.

107
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:13,000
Yeah, they engage in what can only really be described as clickbait, the headline was

108
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:18,240
we may now know the real reason for that IBM takeover, a distraction for Red Hat to axe

109
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:26,680
KDE and it's like, okay, so they're going to deprecate KDE and by 2024, it's not going

110
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:27,680
to be in RHEL.

111
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:32,880
Well, I mean, it's never been massively well supported anyway and they're really gnome

112
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:41,520
focused so this is just not really good from the registers, it's really just them trying

113
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:45,240
to grab clicks and you'd expect better from them really.

114
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:50,800
Way to make a great impression on IBM when you know IBM and Red Hat are carefully watching

115
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:56,960
the press coverage right now and apparently Steve Elmy from Red Hat did an interview with

116
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:00,920
the registers, I wonder if he's going to be getting an email and he's quoted here saying,

117
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:06,080
based on trends in the Red Hat enterprise Linux customer base, there is an overwhelming

118
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:10,960
interest in desktop technologies such as Gnome and Wayland.

119
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:20,140
While interest in KDE has been waning in our installed base, you wonder if maybe that's

120
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:25,520
because they've been holding back their version of plasma and they've been pushing GTK, Gnome

121
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:27,640
and Wayland very heavily.

122
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:32,160
Maybe that's why the installed base seems to be more interested in Gnome.

123
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:37,640
Yeah, I remember last time I tried CentOS on the desktop, I installed plasma or KDE,

124
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:41,360
whatever, expected it to be plasma 5 and then it was KDE 4.

125
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:42,360
Yeah.

126
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:43,360
I was like, what?

127
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,360
Nobody wants that.

128
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:45,920
Did you see Jonathan Riddle's take on this?

129
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:54,520
Yeah, it was quite concise and typically Jonathan just saying like, yeah, it's not really a

130
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:55,520
big deal, is it?

131
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:56,520
It's not news, he says.

132
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:58,640
It's just kind of poor timing for Red Hat though.

133
00:08:58,640 --> 00:08:59,640
Yeah.

134
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:04,080
He says, it's a pity that rel users won't be there to enjoy it by default, but there

135
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:09,160
really never has been a great KDE experience in rel, so nothing's really changing here

136
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:13,080
and it just leaves it up into the community to ship plasma 5, which is way better and

137
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:14,080
way more modern.

138
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,080
Yeah.

139
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:20,840
But it's funny that now you've got your main three enterprise desktop Linux distros, rel,

140
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:27,960
sle from SUSE and Ubuntu, all running GNOME with no KDE.

141
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:34,280
I mean, I suppose with Ubuntu it's a bit easier to get plasma 5 going, but KDE and plasma

142
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:39,880
is not in SUSE enterprise Linux at all and now it's not going to be in Red Hat, which

143
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:42,280
is kind of going against the hype, isn't it?

144
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:49,320
Like we have this idea that plasma is really popular, but the reality is that in enterprise,

145
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:50,320
apparently not.

146
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:53,960
You know, I've thought a little bit about this because of all the desktops, plasma really

147
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:57,280
feels like a professional grade workstation.

148
00:09:57,280 --> 00:10:02,000
It's multi-threaded, it has multiple processes, so if something goes haywire, you don't lose

149
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,380
your whole desktop.

150
00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:07,560
It's got features that make it really great on an enterprise network and it plugs in with

151
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:10,720
collaboration software suites that most businesses use.

152
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:16,040
So it's always really seemed to me like a really great workstation choice for the enterprise.

153
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:19,520
And I have to wonder if it's not just historical momentum here.

154
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:23,680
Gnome has traditionally always been pretty popular on the Red Hat side of things and

155
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:28,320
Red Hat was sort of the originator of the enterprise grade Linux desktop, even if later

156
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,860
on they waned from it.

157
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:35,520
You have also sort of the weight and momentum of that carrying now through to other desktops

158
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:39,960
when they try to make their enterprise grade desktop their shipping gnome because that's

159
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:41,500
what Red Hat shipped.

160
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:45,240
That sort of momentum that can be started when one major player in the industry starts

161
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:51,480
a trend, I think is a bit of what it tributes to gnome success in these enterprise grade

162
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:52,480
desktops.

163
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:56,680
What we don't really hear is how these users are getting along with it, how stable it is

164
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:57,680
for them.

165
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:00,560
We don't really hear that kind of feedback from the general enterprise market.

166
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:06,520
And of course you have to remember that pre-Plasma 5, it wasn't that good, was it?

167
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:12,280
And Plasma 5 has only been around for, in enterprise terms, a blink of the eye because

168
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:14,400
enterprise moves very slowly, doesn't it?

169
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:19,240
So maybe eventually they'll catch on that it's good.

170
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:24,680
I mean, I don't think there's much debate, is there, that 5 is way better than 4?

171
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:25,680
That's my thinking.

172
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:28,800
Yeah, 5 is pretty solid and just keeps getting better and better.

173
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:33,160
And they've instituted that long-term support cycle, which you keep doing that, you stick

174
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:34,400
with it.

175
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:39,200
You may see a few enterprise distributions switch to it over time, maybe, maybe not.

176
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:43,600
But in the meantime, Sailfish is hoping to get some enterprise phones to switch over.

177
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:46,960
The new Sailfish 3 release is really going after the business customer.

178
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:50,480
Yeah, it seems that they've realized that that's where the money is.

179
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:55,640
They've kind of been going after enterprise and government installations for quite a while,

180
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:59,600
but now they're really doubling down on that with this Sailfish 3 release.

181
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:04,120
But that said, they are keeping the community stuff around as well with the Sailfish X program,

182
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:06,160
which they're expanding to a few new phones.

183
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:07,160
Yeah, fair enough.

184
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:08,720
Sailfish X is living on.

185
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:14,080
So I would say just what jumped out at me was sort of the verbiage in their version

186
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:15,080
3 announcement.

187
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:16,440
I thought this is interesting.

188
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:23,760
They say, Sailfish OS has matured to its third generation, Sailfish 3, which now fully packetizes

189
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:27,480
the offering for a multitude of corporate solutions.

190
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:32,560
In line with the regional licensing strategy, Sailfish 3 has a deeper level of security,

191
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:39,000
making it a solid option for various corporate and organizational solutions and other use cases.

192
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Okay, then.

193
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,240
It's almost like a Red Hat press release, isn't it?

194
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:44,240
It is.

195
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:48,520
It's like when you start targeting business, you just have to just pack as many words in

196
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:49,520
there as you can.

197
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:52,640
And that's somehow writing for business.

198
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:56,560
Yeah, well, management like that sort of thing, obviously.

199
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:59,560
There are a few nice new features in here for users, though.

200
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:02,160
They've got that quick settings up in the new top menu.

201
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:07,280
Security encryption for memory cards is now available, a new keyboard that supports gestures,

202
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:10,320
and this one sounds good too, USB on-the-go storage.

203
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:16,160
You can connect different kinds of external storage devices to your Sailfish 3 phone or

204
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:20,200
tablet or I guess whatever you're running on there, and then some camera improvements,

205
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:24,400
mostly just around how it operates with the lock screen and the camera roll, but good

206
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:26,560
stuff in there overall for end users as well.

207
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:31,720
Now unfortunately, I don't have a device that is compatible with Sailfish 3, but I'm tempted.

208
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:35,880
I'm very tempted because it looks very slick, doesn't it, from these screenshots.

209
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:39,320
And I used an earlier version of Sailfish and thought that was pretty well polished.

210
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:44,400
I thought it was probably one of the best alternative phone OSs I've ever used.

211
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:49,400
So you kind of figure if they've been working on it for a while, you get the Sailfish X

212
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:52,760
phone, like the Xperia XA2, you could run it on there.

213
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:53,760
Yeah, I was looking on eBay.

214
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:59,720
It was just slightly too much to kind of sell to my missus that I would spend that much

215
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:02,360
on just something to check out Sailfish.

216
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:06,580
But I've checked out two on my OnePlus One, but that was an unofficial ROM, so I don't

217
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:11,000
know exactly whether that's a fair test of it.

218
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,960
I would really like to get one of these Xperia devices, so I might have to convince her to

219
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:15,960
let me.

220
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:20,560
Yeah, may the negotiations go well for you, Joe, because I'd like to hear your take on

221
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:21,560
it as well.

222
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:29,640
I tried to give another new release this week a go, GhostBSD 18.10, which is the first release

223
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:34,680
of GhostBSD based around true OS under the hood.

224
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:38,020
And it's also got the Monte desktop for the end user.

225
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:39,680
You say tried to test this.

226
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:40,880
It didn't work out then.

227
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:45,400
Yeah, I used Vert Manager to just basically do some local virtualization, and I could

228
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:48,440
never get the desktop session to actually load.

229
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:51,440
I got all these crazy weird green bars across my screen.

230
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:53,640
I was surprised at how large it was, too.

231
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:57,280
It was like a 2.6 something gigabyte download.

232
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:58,280
Pretty big ISO.

233
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:00,000
Pretty, pretty large for the BSDs.

234
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Yeah, well, I decided to try this out on my old test laptop, which is just Intel graphics.

235
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,520
Works pretty well with Triscol, so you know that it's going to have a pretty reasonable

236
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:10,520
chance.

237
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:17,780
And it worked perfectly, GhostBSD 18.10, booted up no problem, installed no problem, installed

238
00:15:17,780 --> 00:15:21,120
some software, did a bit of media playback.

239
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:23,960
It was just a perfectly functional operating system.

240
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:26,960
And that's always been my experience of GhostBSD.

241
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:33,480
Even before it was based on TrueOS, for me, if you are BSD curious like I am, I know very

242
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:34,480
little about BSD.

243
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:37,640
I've never run it on any servers or anything.

244
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:42,560
I think GhostBSD is definitely the place to start, because I think when you're first getting

245
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:48,800
into something like Linux, for example, having a really nice desktop makes it easier.

246
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:52,120
It's kind of almost like a life preserver, isn't it?

247
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:59,000
It's like you've got that safety blanket of a desktop, and then you can go tinkering with

248
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:03,600
more of the command line stuff, and the package management, and all of that.

249
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:09,240
And if you're just starting from scratch with, say, FreeBSD, and you've got no GUI there,

250
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:14,600
it can be a little bit daunting, whereas having a really easy GUI installer, and if you've

251
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:21,600
got an old laptop that you can chuck it on, I would highly recommend this GhostBSD 18.10.

252
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:24,440
Install it, and get your feet wet with a bit of BSD.

253
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:28,760
Now I know that you got your feet very wet at MeetBSD in California.

254
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:31,000
Did GhostBSD come up at all there?

255
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:35,200
There's definitely a few people there that use GhostBSD on their desktops.

256
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:41,320
I heard a lot more, though, about TrueOS, which is an effort from a few IX Systems folks,

257
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:48,080
including Chris Moore, to create a base BSD in which products and other BSDs can be based

258
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:56,560
off of FreeNAS, TrueNAS, but also desktop BSDs, like the Trident desktop distribution,

259
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:58,320
and now GhostBSD.

260
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:02,640
So this is really neat, because instead of having all these crazy different bases, you've

261
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:08,600
got one base that has an easily programatical way to create a derivative.

262
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:12,800
And they're kind of calling them even distributions, in a sense, and this looks like a good one.

263
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:20,040
You've swapped out the default SSL system and went with LibreSSL, and you also get advantage

264
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:25,200
of the standard package tools in BSD, which are really easy to work with.

265
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:26,960
It's using ZFS by default.

266
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:30,100
It's got Network Manager to manage the network connections.

267
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:35,480
This thing's got the latest Intel drivers and the NVIDIA 390 driver.

268
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:39,080
This is a pretty great-looking BSD distribution, so yeah, I was a little disappointed I couldn't

269
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:41,120
get it to go.

270
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:45,740
If you were going to say upgrade, it would just be a package update, package upgrade

271
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:46,740
type command.

272
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:51,280
I mean, this is easy stuff even for Linux users that have never really tried BSD before

273
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:53,400
to dive in and just give it a go.

274
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:56,080
It's so easy, even us Linux users can figure it out, Joe.

275
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:59,360
Yeah, even I managed to get it installed, so it must be all right.

276
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:00,680
They would love to know that.

277
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:04,640
It's a good-looking distribution, and I think that's why folks down there at MeetBSD ran

278
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:08,520
it as a lot of them ran it as their desktop, although I will say there was more people

279
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:13,920
at MeetBSD just using the command line as their desktop than an actual desktop.

280
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:16,440
Why doesn't that surprise me?

281
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:21,520
So we talked about EndlessOS a few months ago shipping on some Asus hardware, and it

282
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:25,520
seems that it's shipping on some more hardware pretty soon.

283
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:30,640
Yeah, this is the hack, hack-computer.com, and they pitch it as a way for kids to learn

284
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:35,740
computers by giving them a fun, playful way to modify their environment, both with a graphical

285
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:41,040
tool and then show them at a code level what's being changed, maybe CSS or operating code,

286
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:44,320
whatever could be getting adjusted as they make settings changes in various applications

287
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:47,720
and games with what they call playful narrative.

288
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:52,700
And they say, parents, this is your opportunity to free up your computer and get a $300 computer

289
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:57,560
for your kid that'll come loaded with coding software, learning apps, and 12 free months

290
00:18:57,560 --> 00:18:59,320
of content and updates.

291
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:06,400
Well, again, this is an Asus machine, and it's a 14-inch full HD screen with four gigabytes

292
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:07,400
of RAM.

293
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:10,440
So that's not too bad for $300, is it?

294
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:12,200
Depending on the build quality.

295
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:17,200
Even if you put another Linux distro on there, that's not bad for a kind of entry-level laptop.

296
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:20,280
But it goes to show that Endless is not dead.

297
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:26,000
We talked about them laying off quite a few staff not too long ago, but this deal with

298
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:32,200
Asus must be worth something to them, and if they sell a fair number of these, it might

299
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:35,240
mean that they're kind of back in business.

300
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:39,240
There's a content deal at play here too, because the hack computer comes with that subscription,

301
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:45,760
and the idea is that as the kids' skill levels increase, every month there's new increasing

302
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:48,660
challenges that download to the computer.

303
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:52,520
Somebody has to be generating that, and I don't know, we don't know at this point, because

304
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:53,520
this is early.

305
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:58,360
I've contacted them to find out more information, and I've also signed up to be a beta participant

306
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:01,280
in their program, so I can try to learn more.

307
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:04,840
But right now, there are a couple of questions up in the air, like who's generating that

308
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:05,840
content?

309
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:06,840
Is it Endless?

310
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:07,840
Is that an Asus initiative?

311
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:11,680
At this point, we don't really have that information, but if you do, go to linuxactionnews.com slash

312
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:13,280
contact and let us know.

313
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:15,240
And if I find out more, I'll follow up.

314
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:20,280
Well, the big hardware news this week was that System76 have got some new desktop machines,

315
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:22,280
and they're looking pretty nice.

316
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:30,880
You've got Thelio, Thelio Major, and Thelio Massive, which start at $1,000, $1,100-ish,

317
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:36,240
and you could work your way up to $50,000, $60,000, maybe even $70,000 depending on how

318
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:37,800
you configure one of these.

319
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:45,820
My rig's somewhere between $3,000 and $5,600, depending on the drive and GPU configuration

320
00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:46,820
I go with.

321
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:53,040
The other middle tier, Thelio Major, starts with either Threadripper or Core X CPUs, and

322
00:20:53,040 --> 00:21:01,160
it goes up to 128 gigs of RAM, and you can get up to nearly 46 terabytes of storage in

323
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:02,160
this thing.

324
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:07,120
And then they have a high-end one that goes up to 768 gigs of ECC RAM and 86 terabytes

325
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:09,520
of storage.

326
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:11,000
It's pretty intense.

327
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:14,640
But I think maybe the other thing that is hard to really appreciate through an audio

328
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:18,160
medium is the effort they've put into these custom case designs.

329
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:23,840
They've got two types of wood that they've sandwiched in with a powdered metal, and it

330
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:24,840
looks really sharp.

331
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:26,400
They have maple or walnut.

332
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:32,640
Walnut's sort of a classical, rich brown wood, and maple has sort of a high-contrast contemporary

333
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:34,040
look to it.

334
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:36,480
And Carl had a back-and-forth with me over email.

335
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:38,320
He's very proud of this.

336
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:41,320
And there's some good stuff in this machine aside from just the design, but they paid

337
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:43,720
a lot of attention to the design.

338
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:46,200
There's no bumps between metal and wood.

339
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:49,280
It's seamless, and it looks really well done.

340
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:53,560
Even the back end of this machine, they've put a solar system design on the fan grill.

341
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:58,480
It's a lot of small attention to detail, including this cool daughterboard that they're breaking

342
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:01,200
out some of the proprietary functionality into.

343
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:03,080
That's a little bit controversial, though, isn't it?

344
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:09,360
Because they'd kind of hype this up to be open and open hardware.

345
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:14,720
And although this is certified by the Open Source Hardware Association, it is still just

346
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:21,760
using your standard Intel or AMD hardware that needs all the blobs to run.

347
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:25,960
And okay, the daughterboard does break some of that stuff out, and they've made that open

348
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:26,960
hardware.

349
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:28,240
But I think it has disappointed.

350
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:29,240
Well, I know it has.

351
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:33,520
I've seen the disappointment in some of the comments and discourse about this online.

352
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:36,640
And I don't know, did they over-hype this?

353
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:37,640
Maybe.

354
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:38,640
Yeah.

355
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:40,880
How could you deliver a fully open Intel system?

356
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:43,400
The only way they were going to deliver that is maybe if it was a RISC-based system.

357
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:46,400
And we don't even know for sure if that's true.

358
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:51,320
I say this is a tricky line for them, because they have an intention here to continue to

359
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:53,900
push this forward as much as possible.

360
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:56,680
And they have open sourced a lot of the design.

361
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:58,600
It's up on GitHub right now.

362
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:04,960
But yeah, I think maybe it was people, when they hear open hardware, they think something

363
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:07,200
a little different than what was delivered here.

364
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:13,440
At the end of the day, it's still a very respectable, very high-performance, good-looking system

365
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:16,200
that's more open than your average desktop PC.

366
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:20,000
And there is some innovation in this daughterboard, but we just have to wait and see how far they

367
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,000
push it forward.

368
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,900
And they do look cool in 80s as well, which I like.

369
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:26,740
As in they look like from the 1980s?

370
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:31,480
They don't look like 80s computers, they look like 80s furniture to me, with that wood and

371
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:32,480
metal combination.

372
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:33,480
Yeah.

373
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:36,200
But in a really cool, stylish way, not in a naff way.

374
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:37,200
Right.

375
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:40,640
No, they do look, I think, are some of the best looking desktops I've seen.

376
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:46,520
Kind of makes me want to build a new system here, and play around with Threadripper too.

377
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:48,080
Yeah, I wouldn't mind one of the cases.

378
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:52,360
I don't think they're selling the cases separately, which I think they could probably sell quite

379
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:53,360
a few of.

380
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:54,360
Yeah, they could.

381
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:57,080
They just want you to buy a computer with all the parts in it too.

382
00:23:57,080 --> 00:24:01,480
They said they will possibly have me out later this month to take a look at it in person,

383
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:05,560
because right now it's just pre-orders, and that's where I'm on the fence.

384
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:06,960
I do want to see it in person.

385
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:07,960
I'd like to hear it too.

386
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:09,960
That's a big thing for me.

387
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:12,860
And I'd like to see the way it's designed on the inside a little more.

388
00:24:12,860 --> 00:24:15,440
That hasn't been something that there's a lot of pictures of.

389
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:19,400
There's some good tea shots, but I'd like to see the inside of one of these things,

390
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:23,240
see how it's put together, see how the cooling system works.

391
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:26,920
It could be one of the better options for desktop Linux users.

392
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:30,400
We just don't know quite yet, but for those that are willing to try it, the pre-orders

393
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:31,400
are open.

394
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:33,880
Yeah, well, when you're down there, you'll have to try and pick me up a case when no

395
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:34,880
one's looking.

396
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:36,600
I'll just sneak it into my bag.

397
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:41,000
And if that happens, you'll find about it right here on the Linux Action News program.

398
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:46,120
