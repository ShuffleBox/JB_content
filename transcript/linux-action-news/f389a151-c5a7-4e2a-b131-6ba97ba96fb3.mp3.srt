00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,200
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News.

2
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:09,360
Episode 124, recorded on September 22nd, 2019.

3
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:10,360
I'm Chris.

4
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:11,360
And I'm Joe.

5
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:12,360
Hello, Joe.

6
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:13,360
Good to be connected with you.

7
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:16,280
And we start things off with some surprising news.

8
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:20,840
Richard Stallman has resigned from the FSF as well as from MIT.

9
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:25,640
Yeah, this was brewing for a good few days before Stallman actually resigned.

10
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:27,580
And that happened last Monday.

11
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:31,620
So it's kind of not exactly new news at this point.

12
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:34,060
And you guys did cover it on Linux Unplugged 3.19.

13
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:38,320
So we probably don't need to go into a huge amount of detail here.

14
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:43,240
But suffice to say, things finally caught up with Stallman.

15
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:44,240
Right.

16
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:48,360
My thinking on this is it isn't this one incident.

17
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:50,400
And I really liked the post.

18
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:53,880
I'll try to put a link in the show notes that Thomas Bushnell did on Medium.

19
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:57,680
He was, by his reckoning, and I think I agree, probably one of the developers that has worked

20
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:00,440
with RMS the longest.

21
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:04,480
And I think we have to acknowledge there was some bad reporting that happened here.

22
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:05,480
Absolutely.

23
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:07,240
There wasn't a concise, complete quote.

24
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:09,240
It was taken out of context.

25
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:14,320
However, truthfully, RMS has had plenty of opportunities to learn how to shut up when

26
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:17,920
it's necessary and hold his tongue.

27
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:20,280
And maybe that shouldn't be the reality of the world.

28
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:23,120
But that is, especially when somebody has the viewpoints of Richard Stallman, when he

29
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:29,400
has the leadership position that he does, he's responsible for relying too much on people's

30
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:32,880
careful reading of his notes.

31
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:38,120
He often, often has the defense, well, if you would carefully read what I said.

32
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:44,120
He's relied on that careful interpretation of a controversial stance for a very long

33
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:45,120
time.

34
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:48,080
And it isn't this one slightly misquoted incident.

35
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:54,880
It is a legacy of issues that even this individual, Thomas, who worked with RMS points out, it's

36
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:56,460
a larger problem.

37
00:01:56,460 --> 00:02:01,000
And it wasn't that RMS was necessarily defending one individual.

38
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:06,600
It was interjected in a bigger, more important conversation about how to come to terms with

39
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:11,680
a history of MIT's institutional neglect of its responsibilities towards women and other

40
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:15,040
groups and their complicity with Ipstein.

41
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:20,520
That was the larger conversation, RMS derailed it with his comments that weren't really necessary.

42
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:24,400
And they were joking in that thread about how this was all going to go public.

43
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,120
So we better be careful with what we say.

44
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:30,480
And we've been having a laugh at his expense with the clips and everything that you used

45
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:31,480
to play on lap.

46
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:33,920
But really, we should have been doing more than that.

47
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:38,320
We've known for a long time that he's had these views that are just abhorrent and just

48
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:40,360
too simplistic.

49
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:43,340
And I think that we as a community should have done more.

50
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:47,180
And I think that the FSF should have done more, MIT should have done more.

51
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:53,360
And it shouldn't have got to this point where it's blowing up in this massive controversy.

52
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,720
It should have been dealt with a long time ago.

53
00:02:55,720 --> 00:03:01,400
There should have been policy in place that stopped him being in charge for this long.

54
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:03,120
I want to make a couple of things clear.

55
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:07,040
I think, I agree, there probably should have been more that was done.

56
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:14,360
I think, and I'm not defending anyone here, but I think there's a bigger issue at play.

57
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:19,480
And it's a massive elephant in the room that we get close to talking about when we talk

58
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:24,080
about Linus and his outbursts, and when we talk about Richard Stallman and his behavior,

59
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,680
but we dance around it.

60
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:30,200
And it is that our community is packed full of neurodiversity.

61
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:33,520
We have people that are all over the place.

62
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:37,600
And that's part of why we have so many brilliant people in the open source and free software

63
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:38,600
community.

64
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:43,000
They're gifted, but they also see the world differently in some cases.

65
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,320
And I normally wouldn't say something like this on air, but I've been a part of this

66
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:54,120
community for over a decade, and I have met thousands of people in person.

67
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:58,040
And I've interviewed hundreds of developers.

68
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:02,460
And I can tell you that this is a observation I have made myself.

69
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:06,760
We have a bunch of really gifted people in our community, but that means sometimes they

70
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:10,000
behave different than what people consider the norm.

71
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:15,280
I think, in my personal opinion, most of us in the community kind of know this.

72
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:19,040
And so sometimes we've made allowances for behavior that wouldn't normally be considered

73
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,040
okay.

74
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:22,960
And I think maybe we've made a mistake there.

75
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:28,720
And by Richard taking this step himself, he's taken action before it got really, really

76
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:29,720
nasty.

77
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:34,240
And I think he's preserving the Free Software Foundation and the movement by doing this.

78
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:39,240
I think we'll look back with some history and some perspective, and we'll appreciate

79
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:41,000
the technical work that he did still.

80
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:46,160
And I think that's another thing that got him as much leverage and mileage is the technical

81
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:52,080
contributions both in code, but also in licensing and in free software.

82
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:55,720
And that sort of gave him a special treatment.

83
00:04:55,720 --> 00:05:01,440
But by Richard Stallman moving aside, it means that we can also deal with other leaders that

84
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:03,280
also exhibit these sort of similar behaviors.

85
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:09,580
If he remained in place, it's sort of sending a signal that we allow that kind of behavior.

86
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:15,280
And so by RMS stepping aside, it sends a signal that if you're in a position of leadership,

87
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:20,040
especially a significant position of leadership, you're held to a high standard.

88
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:23,240
And we will actually make sure that you meet that high standard.

89
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:29,760
This is a bit of a, I think, a growing up for free software and for open source.

90
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:38,000
It's sort of a transition away from outbursts and certain types of thinking to a more mature

91
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,300
and modern.

92
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:42,640
And those kinds of transitions always end up leaving people behind.

93
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:45,720
And the people that get left behind generally are very upset.

94
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,440
But ultimately, it needs to happen.

95
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:53,520
And we've seen two very different things happen there, first with Linus Torvalds, who got

96
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:58,180
called out for some behavior that he'd been exhibiting.

97
00:05:58,180 --> 00:06:04,800
And he took a step back, went away, and has come back now and has sorted himself out and

98
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:09,120
is still happily at the helm of Linux and everything's going fine.

99
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:11,280
So far, the kernel still seems to be pretty great.

100
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:13,760
Although I did have some issues with 5.2, I gotta say.

101
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:17,200
Well, yeah, that aside, the quality has been maintained.

102
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:21,560
And just because he's changed his management style doesn't mean that anything has changed

103
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:23,640
significantly technically.

104
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:30,800
Whereas Stormon is such a stubborn man, that people have tried to make him change and you

105
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:36,120
know, the whole insistence on calling it GNU slash Linux and all of that, he's just stuck

106
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:40,440
to his guns so much that he just cannot change, it seems.

107
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:43,680
And the world has changed and he's been left behind.

108
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:48,280
And he's been irrelevant as far as I'm concerned for a very, very long time now.

109
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:54,800
And I'm sort of glad, you know, put all of the controversy aside just from him as a man

110
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:57,960
and as a figurehead for the free software movement.

111
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:01,800
I'm very glad that he's now not going to be that figurehead anymore.

112
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:04,120
I wouldn't attribute feeling glad to this.

113
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:08,360
I think I recognize it was a necessity for the long term survival of the Free Software

114
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:14,920
Foundation, and MIT probably need to distance from as much of the scandal as they can.

115
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:18,560
But I don't really know what his involvement with GNU is going forward.

116
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:22,120
And he's still going to have quite a following, regardless of what people's opinions out there

117
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:26,480
might be, there will be people that continue to follow Richard Stallman, and he likely

118
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:31,620
could still get a pretty decent appearance fee to go to events.

119
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:35,280
After some time has passed, he may continue to talk about these issues, but now do so

120
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:38,640
without risking the Free Software Foundation.

121
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:40,920
Or perhaps he'll take this opportunity to retire.

122
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:43,640
Well, I do hope he retires, I think it's the right thing to do.

123
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:47,800
But I suspect you're right, and he will be back and we will hear more from him soon.

124
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:48,800
Right.

125
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:49,800
Time will tell.

126
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:50,800
Probably going to need a little bit of time.

127
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:53,240
People are still very upset.

128
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:55,080
It needs a cooling off period.

129
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:58,080
There's a larger conversation we need to have about neurodiversity.

130
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:59,860
That's my personal cause.

131
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:01,680
But I think now is not the right time to have it.

132
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:05,560
Right now, we need to respect that certain boundaries were crossed and let those people

133
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:07,600
have time.

134
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:12,920
And these other issues like what happens to RMS and the bigger conversation, we'll get

135
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:13,920
to.

136
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:17,400
When you think of diversity, though, you don't normally think of a knit system diversity,

137
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:21,660
but that is the very topic that the Debian project is struggling with.

138
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:26,740
And it all stems from what seems like a rather minor package in the grand scheme of things,

139
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:29,840
but the knock on effects of a decision could be massive.

140
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:37,880
Yeah, and that package is E login D. And this has reignited the system D debate in Debian,

141
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:41,320
which I thought was totally over, but apparently not.

142
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:47,920
Because when Debian adopted system D, they didn't completely drop support for other init

143
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:52,820
systems, but they just focused on system D. And a big part of the debate at the time leading

144
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:58,560
up to that decision was people saying that if you adopt system D, then you're going to

145
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:02,740
become completely dependent on it, and other things will just break.

146
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:07,800
And it seems that they were right, because now we're getting to a situation where things

147
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:13,520
are breaking, and a decision is probably going to have to be made here where either they

148
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:20,860
really focus on other init systems and making them work properly, or we can have a situation

149
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:25,760
where Debian is no longer the universal operating system and ports like, you know, BSD slash

150
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:30,160
Debian are just going to stop working and potentially go away.

151
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:31,160
Yeah, that's it.

152
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:34,120
And this issue has come to a head in such that Sam Hartman, the Debian project lead,

153
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:39,120
has had to step in and kind of set a state of where things are at in a public way, and

154
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,940
then ask for people to contribute to the conversation.

155
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:43,120
But a little bit of context here.

156
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:49,000
So the reason why E login D kicked off this whole wider conversation about staying diverse

157
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:54,360
with the init system or 100% focusing on system D is because E login D attempts to provide

158
00:09:54,360 --> 00:10:01,360
an implementation of services needed by common desktops for system D login D. So your desktop

159
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:06,140
environments that require system D will still work and let you log in even if you don't

160
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:10,520
have system D. This thing kind of sits in there and pretends to be that system D layer.

161
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:15,480
Now it has a lot of complexities, including package conflicts and other changes in future

162
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:17,960
versions of Debian that we'll need addressing.

163
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:21,280
And so the maintainers have sort of come to loggerheads on this problem.

164
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:25,160
I'm summarizing, we'll have a full link in the show notes at linuxactionnews.com slash

165
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:27,280
124.

166
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:33,480
But Sam says the reason why the Debian project lead is stepping in is because the developers

167
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:38,560
have essentially exhausted themselves emotionally on this after years of complex interactions

168
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:40,600
and considerations.

169
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:44,160
You have an issue where people are emotionally exhausted.

170
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:50,040
And so that's resulting in these technical issues, which are holding up this larger conversation.

171
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:57,000
And of course, let's not forget the large dev1 shaped elephant in this room, dev1 forked

172
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,880
from Debian when the system D decision was made.

173
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:04,400
And the whole raison d'etre of dev1 is to maintain init diversity.

174
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:07,800
Yeah, yeah, I was thinking that same thing.

175
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:14,540
So what it really comes down to is, in a lot of ways, dropping E login D is this massive

176
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:20,620
decision because it's sort of a knock on effect of becoming a system D only distribution.

177
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:24,400
But if you want to maintain init diversity, then you're going to need a whole bunch of

178
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:29,480
maintainers to step up to keep all of this stuff working in future versions of Debian.

179
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:33,720
And you're going to need maintainers to work together, which currently they've sort of

180
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:35,280
stopped doing that.

181
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:39,200
So it really comes down to a pretty essential decision for the project.

182
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:43,000
And it shows that once you thought something was settled in a setup like Debian, it doesn't

183
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,720
necessarily mean it's settled forever.

184
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:48,520
But surely that's a good thing that you don't just make a decision and stick blindly to

185
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:52,080
it if it looks like it may have been the wrong decision.

186
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:57,040
And I think that Sam is going about this the right way, bringing this up as a topic that

187
00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:01,960
needs to be discussed and trying to kickstart that discussion and potentially having all

188
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:04,920
the devs have their say in a general resolution.

189
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:07,440
Well wouldn't that be a fascinating process to watch?

190
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:08,880
Keep my eye out for that.

191
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:13,440
In the meantime, the rest of the systemd using world is moving forward with potentially a

192
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,960
radical new concept.

193
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:21,760
First he came for your audio subsystem, then he came for your init system, and now that

194
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:24,760
crazy Lenart's coming for your home directory.

195
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:25,760
And I think I like it.

196
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:30,120
Yeah, let's not forget that he also came for containers as well, systemd containerd, which

197
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:32,480
is still being worked on.

198
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:38,680
So systemd homed, this is Lenart's crazy new idea, whereby your home directory is going

199
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:40,320
to be a file.

200
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:43,800
No, a file on a Linux system?

201
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:44,800
Never heard of such a thing.

202
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:50,600
I want to make it clear that he's only talking about human user accounts, not the system

203
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:51,600
accounts.

204
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:55,380
There's a lot to this, but it's kind of brilliant.

205
00:12:55,380 --> 00:13:00,480
When you look at a lot of the traditional problems of user management on a Linux system,

206
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:04,840
they start to get a lot more complicated when you have 5, 10, 15 systems, and when you need

207
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:09,960
to share files like NFS mounts and whatnot amongst these systems.

208
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:14,640
And there really hasn't been much change in the last 39 years around the concept of a

209
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:16,520
Unix home directory.

210
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:22,160
So systemd homed is a concept that reworks how home directories work in Linux.

211
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:27,440
And it's, at least in his recommendation, using strong Lux encryption by default, automatic

212
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:32,160
enumeration of UIDs, and hot, pluggable home directories, Joe.

213
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:33,520
How do you like them, Apples?

214
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:39,660
It's as if he's taken a look at how home directories work and just said, let's scrap that completely,

215
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:46,080
and let's design it as it should be for the 21st century, for 2019 into 2020.

216
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:49,700
He has a really good talk on this, which we have linked in the show notes.

217
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:52,120
And keep in mind, this is all early days.

218
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:56,080
And I'll also add right here towards the front, one of the goals of this new system would

219
00:13:56,080 --> 00:14:01,600
be total compatibility with the old way of doing home directories and user accounts.

220
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:05,080
Here's a high level idea, though, of how it works.

221
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:06,880
Everything is contained in the home directory.

222
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:11,240
If a home directory exists on the system, the user exists.

223
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:16,080
So by laying out home folders with all of this information in a JSON format in the home

224
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:21,620
directory, it describes everything about the user's security and configuration to the host

225
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:23,080
operating system.

226
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:30,040
What Lenart is proposing here is that we separate user configuration from system configuration.

227
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:35,680
The user is a file, and changing system settings is separate from changing a user password

228
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:40,360
or moving their home directory or enabling or disabling a user account.

229
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:44,480
That's user level configuration stuff, not system configuration stuff.

230
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:46,380
So you break the two apart.

231
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:50,540
You use Lux encryption, and you tie that to the user's password.

232
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:54,680
So on a shared system, instead of having one password that everybody has to know, your

233
00:14:54,680 --> 00:15:02,160
home directory is encrypted to your user password, which will break a few things, like SSH logins,

234
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:03,880
but proposes much better security.

235
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:08,880
Because this was an issue my wife has at her clinic, is they have to share the encryption

236
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:11,280
password amongst all of the staff at the clinic.

237
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:14,460
And then they have a separate password to log in, and then they have separate passwords

238
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:15,920
for the services.

239
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:20,240
It's a little bit over complex, and it seems a little backwards to share the encryption

240
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:22,120
password with everybody.

241
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:27,560
Then another issue, this is the last kind of key point, is this will solve a major security

242
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:29,420
issue on laptops.

243
00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:34,060
And that is quite simply, when you log into your system and you have your drive unencrypted,

244
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:38,180
if you have a Lux encrypted home drive, like I have my Lux, my home partitions completely

245
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:39,180
Lux encrypted.

246
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:43,160
I enter a password before the system gets too far into booting, and then it mounts my

247
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:45,960
main disk and everything works.

248
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:51,800
However, when I put my laptop to sleep, which is pretty much what I do all the time, that

249
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:54,160
data remains unencrypted.

250
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:56,660
The encryption key is stored in memory.

251
00:15:56,660 --> 00:16:00,720
It's open on the disk, and if somebody grabs your laptop while it's sleeping, that data

252
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:01,720
is unencrypted.

253
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:06,060
And now they have physical access to your laptop with the data unencrypted.

254
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:07,960
This system would change that.

255
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:14,860
Because it would be tied to the user's password, systemd homed would remove the key from memory

256
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:18,580
when you suspend or lock the laptop or desktop.

257
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:23,880
From a technical point of view, this sounds very impressive, but it is divisive, because

258
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:27,520
you can't just go and change something that's been around for the best part of 40 years

259
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:28,520
without controversy.

260
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:29,520
Right?

261
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:31,200
I mean, that's just inevitable.

262
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:37,520
And from the reaction that I've seen so far, it seems to be basically a 50-50 split between

263
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:45,760
people who think, great, this is an amazing, new, modern approach to home directories.

264
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:49,440
And then the other 50% of people think, no, this is terrible.

265
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:51,160
It's been fine for 40 years.

266
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:52,780
Let's just leave it as is, please.

267
00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:56,860
I think you've got to cut out all of the knee-jerk reactions that just say, oh, here's systemd

268
00:16:56,860 --> 00:16:58,260
doing another thing.

269
00:16:58,260 --> 00:17:02,400
Because like many things with systemd, that's not really fair.

270
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:07,080
Systemd is kind of like the API that lets you address this stuff, but he's just basically

271
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:14,040
using Lux and PAM and all of the tools we already have to provide the functionality.

272
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:15,040
So there's that aspect.

273
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:18,300
But you've got to kind of ignore all the people that are like, oh, systemd gets even bigger.

274
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:21,480
Because it's really just pulling together a bunch of existing tools.

275
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:23,760
And that's just really the reality of it.

276
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:26,120
That's the case for a lot of things systemd does.

277
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:27,480
Here's the other thing.

278
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:32,800
Those people haven't had to manage dozens or hundreds of Linux and Unix systems.

279
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:36,720
It is at a whole other scale when you have to hack together some sort of centralized

280
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:38,080
LDAP system.

281
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:42,180
Or what I see most shops doing now is just marrying themselves to Active Directory and

282
00:17:42,180 --> 00:17:43,560
just saying, you know what?

283
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:46,280
When it comes to our authentication, we're just going with Microsoft.

284
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:49,600
I am shocked at how prevalent that is.

285
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:51,640
Recently I've just been exposed to that just recently.

286
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:53,860
And I was shocked that that's such a common thing.

287
00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:55,520
Because it's just solved.

288
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:56,960
It's easy to get it working with Linux.

289
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:58,560
You get central authentication.

290
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:03,240
You get the same common UIDs across all of the systems, which makes file permissions

291
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:04,440
work.

292
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:07,240
And it's easier to do deployments that way.

293
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:12,880
This is really about making this a configurable thing that can be managed, where you can query

294
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:14,800
user records.

295
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:19,400
You'll be able to entirely encapsulate a home directory on a thumb drive.

296
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:20,760
You take that thumb drive.

297
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:21,880
You sit down at a laptop.

298
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:23,460
You plug it in.

299
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:26,240
You now become a user on that system.

300
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:29,240
And everything is in that contained environment.

301
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:32,200
Your configuration, your authentication, your UID.

302
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:36,860
It can automatically translate to another UID on the system if that's already taken.

303
00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:37,860
It's really smooth.

304
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:40,560
And then when you're done, you pop that thumb drive out.

305
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:42,080
Everything about that user is gone.

306
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:46,180
And something else I know a lot of our audience will appreciate is they're going for day one

307
00:18:46,180 --> 00:18:51,800
YubiKey support for this, which is really kind of any PKCS 11 token device.

308
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:56,160
Not just the YubiKey, but sort of generally using the YubiKey as a term there on day one,

309
00:18:56,160 --> 00:19:00,480
which I think would be a huge addition for Linux.

310
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:03,160
One other thing, Joe, is this needs to happen now.

311
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:05,800
Because if you look at different systems, they're already kind of...

312
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:06,800
It's a mishmash.

313
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:12,200
Like you have all of these strapped on ancillary systems, or you have like SSH keys which completely

314
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:14,720
do a bypass on this system.

315
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:15,720
It's kind of a...

316
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:16,720
It's a mess right now.

317
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:17,720
I don't know.

318
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:18,720
I really...

319
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:21,640
I guess the more I try to convince you, the more I'm convincing myself that this is kind

320
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:22,640
of...

321
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:28,120
This would be the most modern way to manage home directories in operating systems.

322
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:29,120
This is really fresh.

323
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:32,000
And I don't know if he's gotten a few ideas from other projects that I'm not familiar

324
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:37,400
with, but he's addressing several security issues as well as making it easier to centrally

325
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:41,640
manage and give people true portability between machines.

326
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:44,120
I like how you just assume that I'm against this.

327
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:45,600
Well, you were skeptical, I think.

328
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,000
And now I'm just getting more into it.

329
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,200
The more I think about it, I'm like, this would be pretty cool if Linux was the OS to

330
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:51,960
pull this off before anybody else.

331
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:53,120
Yeah, that would be cool.

332
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:58,480
I think that not making it the only way, not making it mandatory, I think that has to be

333
00:19:58,480 --> 00:19:59,480
key here.

334
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:03,040
And it looks like that is going to be the case at least for now.

335
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:05,160
And I suppose we'll have to see how it works out.

336
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:10,680
But as long as you have the option to have a traditional home directory, then I don't

337
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:12,200
see a problem with it.

338
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:18,320
The problem I see is if we end up being forced into it, then I'm going to need a bit more

339
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:19,320
convincing, I think.

340
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:20,320
Yeah, fair enough.

341
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:22,920
And it sounds like that's the goal.

342
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:25,440
And it sounds like they're going to even try to make it portable between a system that

343
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:27,260
uses the new method and the old method.

344
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:31,200
But if you're scratching your head, or you think I'm crazy, or this sounds interesting

345
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:33,480
to you, I definitely recommend you check out the talk.

346
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:35,800
I'll have it linked in the show notes.

347
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:41,080
Lenart has slides that go into more detail, as well as he expands upon several points.

348
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:44,120
And like always, it's a very technically rich conversation.

349
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:45,960
So it's just fascinating to listen to.

350
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:48,040
Yeah, it's definitely worth a watch.

351
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:52,320
And so we've talked about the system D saga as that rolls on and on.

352
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:55,240
What about the Huawei and Google saga?

353
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:57,380
We've had a development this week with that.

354
00:20:57,380 --> 00:21:03,720
We've got news that the Mate 30 Pro will ship, but it won't ship with Google's Android apps.

355
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:08,480
Huawei CEO of the consumer products division revealed on stage at a press event in Germany,

356
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:12,040
the company was forced to stop shipping the Google mobile services.

357
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:15,240
But but Joe, don't worry.

358
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:19,640
They've got the Huawei mobile services, the HMS core, it's ready to go.

359
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:21,240
It's just not quite the same thing.

360
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:26,160
Yeah, and there are going to be certain apps available through their app store.

361
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:29,920
But then some key ones that won't be.

362
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:34,920
So the expectation among a lot of the tech presses, well, presumably, people will be

363
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:40,800
able to flash their own Google apps, you know, take a phone, like the OnePlus 3T, unlock

364
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:45,000
the bootloader, it's trivial to install Google apps on that.

365
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,680
But with Huawei phones, it wasn't that long ago that they stopped letting you unlock your

366
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:53,280
bootloader, which seems like a decision they may regret now.

367
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:57,780
You know, the name like Pro 2, you kind of expect a little more and the Mate 30 Pro will

368
00:21:57,780 --> 00:21:59,820
not ship with an unlockable bootloader.

369
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:04,800
There was some misreporting earlier in the week that suggested that perhaps it would.

370
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:07,160
However, that does not appear to be the case.

371
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:10,120
That must have been just a misreading of a statement by the CEO that was a little weird,

372
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:15,960
like we're going to offer customization, which who knows what that means that could be themes.

373
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:18,840
Also, Joe, I think what's notable here is they're really kind of locking themselves

374
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:22,720
in now because you could have sold the hardware and if you made it easy to unlock, then the

375
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:28,040
users that cared enough could have had an avenue to maybe load Google apps or different

376
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:29,860
ROM entirely.

377
00:22:29,860 --> 00:22:36,400
And they're also trying to claim that their solution is good enough and just use that.

378
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:41,920
It's two complete BS answers like the reason they gave for not allowing the unlocking is

379
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:42,920
for security.

380
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:46,300
Well, and also for the whole support thing as well.

381
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:50,760
Once you start flashing custom ROMs, then you can get into a lot of trouble and end

382
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:55,760
up costing Huawei money to support that, which, you know, I could understand the argument

383
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:56,760
at the time.

384
00:22:56,760 --> 00:23:01,520
I thought it was a bad move, but, you know, I could definitely understand it.

385
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:03,920
But the question I have for you is this.

386
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:05,920
What if they get away with it somehow?

387
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:10,880
What if there are enough apps and they can convince the big app makers to port their

388
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:11,880
apps over?

389
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:13,920
Wouldn't that be something?

390
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:18,800
If in the West they could ship a phone without the Google services?

391
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:23,880
Because we saw that happen with Amazon and, okay, they were very cheap devices, the cheap

392
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:28,000
tablets and a couple of phones, I think, that didn't do very well.

393
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,160
But those tablets seem to be doing all right for them.

394
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:31,880
But that's, you know, they're very cheap.

395
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:35,420
This is a high end, really nice phone.

396
00:23:35,420 --> 00:23:42,240
And if they could somehow pull this off, I think it would actually be a very good thing

397
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:43,240
for the market.

398
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:45,080
Yeah, I can't disagree with that.

399
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:52,800
I think the mistaken reasoning here is calling these things apps, the Google apps versus

400
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:54,200
the Huawei apps.

401
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:56,000
It's not really the apps.

402
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,840
It's the APIs and the cloud service behind all of that.

403
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:07,680
Like the Google Play API delivers so much functionality to Android now that it is a

404
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:11,640
completely different product without it.

405
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:15,160
Now I know a lot of people in our audience are capable of running an Android phone without

406
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:16,680
the G apps perfectly fine.

407
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:21,540
I did it for a few weeks and I was amazed at the better battery life that I got.

408
00:24:21,540 --> 00:24:24,720
But eventually, eventually I caved.

409
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:27,680
You know, I can't remember at the time if it was Google Maps or what it was.

410
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:31,480
But I had to, I had to install something that needed the Google Play API.

411
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:36,600
And once you make that change, it's like your phone becomes a completely different device,

412
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:41,800
including security updates directly from Google that are even broader now in Android 10.

413
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:43,520
It's not about the apps.

414
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:45,160
It's a false comparison.

415
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:49,320
And a lot of the apps that are good on the Android platform rely on Google's back end

416
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:54,760
APIs for push notifications or even for running in the background for an extended period of

417
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:55,760
time.

418
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:59,280
They're only available via Google's APIs.

419
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:04,240
And then there's the cloud infrastructure for text to speech and image recognition and

420
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:08,200
image enhancements when you use the camera and all of the things that Google does in

421
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:12,160
the cloud to make Android better are also gone.

422
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:14,280
So it's a much larger conversation than just the apps.

423
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:19,920
And that's why I think they're screwed because they'll always be on a less than OS if they

424
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:21,980
just ship Android.

425
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:25,560
Because the comparisons will be made between Android with Google apps and Android without

426
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:26,560
Google apps.

427
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:30,240
And it's just like how Samsung, even with their massive scale, has never been able to

428
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:31,520
fully compete.

429
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:33,200
I think Huawei will be in a similar position.

430
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:36,840
They'll get close, but they'll always have the Bigsby of voice assistance.

431
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:37,840
Yeah.

432
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:39,520
So basically, dream on, Joe.

433
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:40,520
It's not happening.

434
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:41,520
I don't know.

435
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:42,520
I don't know.

436
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:43,520
Maybe I'm crazy.

437
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:47,840
I think if they have their own, I don't know, maybe Linux based OS that was really great

438
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:52,320
that they just invested all this time in, then it would be their own unique product.

439
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:55,600
Maybe you'd have a better shot, especially if they could go after a market that was sick

440
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:58,640
and tired of all these smartphones and spying on you.

441
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:02,800
Maybe and they've still got their home market as well of Asia where Google is much less

442
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:03,800
important.

443
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:04,800
Yeah, absolutely.

444
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:05,800
It's a really good point.

445
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:07,960
They don't even need us, Joe, right?

446
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:12,960
But we all need Oracle because they've announced Oracle Autonomous Linux, which changes everything.

447
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:16,280
Wait, wait, oh, I'm sorry.

448
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:17,280
You got a correction here.

449
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:18,280
It changes nothing.

450
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:19,280
What?

451
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:25,160
You mean a version of Red Hat, essentially, that provisions itself, scales itself, tunes

452
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:29,000
itself, patches itself, all autonomously?

453
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,640
That's not going to completely change the market?

454
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:38,440
You mean like a CentOS box with central management or a really nice bash script?

455
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:46,120
I tease a little bit only because of just like how like full guns Larry was up on stage.

456
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:48,340
This is a quote from Larry Ellison.

457
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:52,200
If you're paying for IBM, you can stop.

458
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:57,380
One simple rule to prevent data theft, put your data in an autonomous system.

459
00:26:57,380 --> 00:27:00,000
No human error, no data loss.

460
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,960
That's the big difference between us and AWS.

461
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:04,500
That doesn't make any sense.

462
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:06,080
You want to avoid data loss?

463
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:07,080
Have a good backup.

464
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:08,080
Yeah.

465
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:09,080
Yeah.

466
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:15,400
I mean, it does sound like a pretty good product that would do well in enterprise.

467
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:21,520
I could see it doing well, but just the way it's been pitched and it's sort of overblown

468
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:23,080
seems a bit strange to me.

469
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:25,760
I suppose you have to do that, don't you, if you're trying to sell stuff?

470
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:26,760
Yeah.

471
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:32,040
And I think the reason why it doesn't ring as powerful as a message to us is because

472
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:33,760
other vendors have gotten there first.

473
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:36,720
In fact, this was the whole premise of CoreOS.

474
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:43,400
This is the premise of Ubuntu Core, Fedora Silverblue, what will become of Fedora CoreOS.

475
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:48,520
Like yeah, yeah, this is something that the vendors have been thinking about for a while.

476
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:55,000
And what you've done is repackaged a solution that is already mostly theirs.

477
00:27:55,000 --> 00:28:00,760
I don't mean to laugh, but it's just, it's like they really came at this like just trash

478
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:06,560
and everybody, but what they've brought to the market is really valuable if you're an

479
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:07,960
Oracle Cloud customer.

480
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:10,880
It's legitimately going to be nice on their infrastructure.

481
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:16,240
But for me, this rings as hollow as unbreakable Linux did when they announced that.

482
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:21,160
It was all the same big talk and it didn't really change much of the market.

483
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:23,560
It got users, it's still in use today.

484
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:29,680
Wikipedia says that as of 2016 at least, they had 15,000 customers subscribed to the support

485
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:30,680
program.

486
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:33,560
I'm curious to know what that number is in 2019.

487
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:36,200
So I don't have high expectations for this one, Joe.

488
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:40,160
But they had a cluster of Raspberry Pis that was basically a supercomputer running this

489
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:41,160
thing.

490
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:42,880
You telling me that didn't impress you?

491
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:44,000
Hmm, maybe.

492
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,720
Almost as much as the unofficial word on the street.

493
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:50,920
Just a quick follow up to last week, a new version of CentOS is out and I haven't tried

494
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:56,160
it myself, but word on the street is at the last moment, they got Raspberry Pi basic booting

495
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:57,160
support in there.

496
00:28:57,160 --> 00:29:01,360
I don't think the video stuff is supported yet, but you can boot CentOS on a Raspberry

497
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:02,360
Pi.

498
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:03,360
That, that impresses me.

499
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:07,780
Yeah, we were talking last week about how we've been waiting for CentOS that's based

500
00:29:07,780 --> 00:29:10,240
on RHEL 7.7.

501
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:13,080
And that has arrived now.

502
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:17,600
And also, it looks like CentOS 8 is just around the corner as well.

503
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:21,440
September 24 is what the wiki saying now for CentOS 8.

504
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:26,600
I am kind of excited about that version of CentOS because that's based on the version

505
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:29,280
of RHEL, which is based on Fedora 28.

506
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:35,100
Fedora 28 is the release where they enabled software modularity, they made it easier to

507
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:40,960
install third party drivers, they've updated it to a fairly recent version of Gnome, it

508
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:46,280
has improved virtual box support, it ships with newer versions of GCC, like it's a big

509
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:51,020
release of Fedora and looking back at it now, you can see that they were clearly trying

510
00:29:51,020 --> 00:29:54,280
to get it pretty solid as a possible RHEL base.

511
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:58,760
So this next version of CentOS 8 is a pretty major upgrade.

512
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:03,900
And it's probably the first time ever that I've been excited about a CentOS release,

513
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:10,120
which is a really weird thing to say because it's like the least like hype distro out there.

514
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:12,560
But here I am, I can't wait.

515
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:16,840
Having a long term support version of Fedora 28 is going to be great.

516
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:21,360
And let's face it, what you're most excited about is finally being able to use DNF on

517
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:22,360
CentOS.

518
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:25,520
You absolutely 100% true.

519
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:28,720
That is the major thing that and I think I'm gonna be able to put on the Raspberry Pi 4,

520
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:32,760
but it's primarily it's DNF.

521
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:36,320
Well one last thing while we're talking about things that I'm looking forward to, we have

522
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:43,240
launched linuxheadlines.show and it is a Linux news podcast in under three minutes every

523
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:44,240
weekday.

524
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:47,400
You wouldn't think we could get much in there but you'd be surprised and in fact it gives

525
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:51,400
us an opportunity to cover stories that don't make it on Linux action news.

526
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:55,080
This is where we have the long conversations but the things that are happening every single

527
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:57,320
day linuxheadlines.show.

528
00:30:57,320 --> 00:31:00,400
It really is a great way to stay up to date with what's going on in Linux and open source

529
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:01,640
every weekday.

530
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:03,760
So check it out, linuxheadlines.show.

531
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:05,480
And then be sure to get us every single week.

532
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:10,640
To do that go to linuxactionnews.com slash subscribe for all the ways to get new episodes.

533
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:13,820
And linuxactionnews.com slash contact for ways to get in touch with us.

534
00:31:13,820 --> 00:31:18,240
Of course we'll be back next Monday with our weekly take on the latest Linux and open source

535
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:19,240
news.

536
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:20,240
I'm at Chris LAS.

537
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:22,200
I'm at Joel Ressington.

538
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:24,800
Thank you for joining us and we will see you next week.

539
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:43,120
