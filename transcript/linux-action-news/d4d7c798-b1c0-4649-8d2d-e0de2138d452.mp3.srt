00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,120
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, our weekly take on Linux and the open source world.

2
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:20,480
This is episode 71, recorded on September 16th, 2018.

3
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:21,480
I'm Joe.

4
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:22,480
And I'm Wes.

5
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:24,320
Thank you very much for joining me again, Wes.

6
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:28,160
Chris is back at home and recovering, but we thought we'd better let him rest a little

7
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:29,200
bit more.

8
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:33,720
He should be back for LUP on Tuesday, but for now, you've got me and Wes again.

9
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:35,180
So thank you very much.

10
00:00:35,180 --> 00:00:40,120
Let's start with Fedora and Fedora Silverblue.

11
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:42,120
And they want people to take it for a test drive.

12
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:43,120
Yeah, that's right.

13
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:47,580
And well, you might not really know what Silverblue is just from the name.

14
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:52,860
It used to be called Fedora Atomic Workstation Special Interest Group.

15
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:53,860
That's a mouthful.

16
00:00:53,860 --> 00:01:00,000
It's a little bit easier, and it's a it's kind of a new type of Fedora based off OS

17
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Tree.

18
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,440
Yeah, they say it has RPM OS Tree at its core to provide fully atomic upgrades, which we've

19
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:08,840
seen on Project Atomic on the server.

20
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:12,800
But now we're seeing this on the desktop, which is really cool.

21
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:17,440
And it's not kind of ready for full time uses.

22
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:19,480
It's not kind of daily driver ready.

23
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:23,080
And they are pretty clear about that, hence why they want people to test it.

24
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:24,080
Yeah, that's right.

25
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:30,380
So Thursday, September 20th, 2018, Team Silverblue and Fedora QA are holding a test day for users

26
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:33,880
to try out and test this new workstation variant.

27
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:36,080
Anyone can help make changes in Fedora.

28
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:40,480
Be a part of it if you want to see this released, they do say that you don't have to necessarily

29
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:41,480
do it on that day.

30
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:44,680
They're just kind of trying to focus everyone's attention on that.

31
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:49,160
But if you don't have time to do it on that day, you can do it before or afterwards.

32
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:52,720
And there's a wiki where you can enter your results from the various tests that you have

33
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:53,920
to do.

34
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:57,340
And obviously, Flatpak is a huge part of this, because that's how they are delivering the

35
00:01:57,340 --> 00:01:59,060
desktop apps.

36
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:02,460
So they can keep the core completely separate from the applications.

37
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:04,880
And as we know, Flatpaks can now auto update.

38
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:08,100
So this is the future, as far as I can see.

39
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:11,480
It's not quite the present, but it's just around the corner, I think.

40
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:16,680
Yeah, you know, really, RPM, OS Tree and all the related technologies, I'm pretty impressed

41
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:17,680
by.

42
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:21,380
And some of their goals are exciting, like support package layering for OS extensions

43
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:24,840
in GNOME software, support rebases and rollbacks.

44
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:29,040
They've got some good details about why having a smart integrated system like this offers

45
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:33,360
some unique alternatives that you can't quite get with other snapshot systems, say like

46
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:36,920
if you're using ZFS and taking snapshots before you upgrade.

47
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:39,360
The operating system doesn't really know about, you know, how that works.

48
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,060
You're doing that at a different layer.

49
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:44,620
But with systems like Silverblue, well, you have a lot more options.

50
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:48,440
Can you imagine people just go rollback a major, all of your OS packages, and then your

51
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:50,380
applications are separate in Flatpak?

52
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:53,400
So that seems like a really robust system.

53
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:55,200
We've seen something similar, haven't we?

54
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:58,900
With endless OS, but that's very much aimed at a different market.

55
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:03,020
That's not aimed at developers and people who want the latest of everything.

56
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:09,160
It's kind of aimed for more developing markets and low end hardware, whereas this, Fedora

57
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:14,920
Silverblue is very much aimed at the latest hardware, developers, sys admins.

58
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:20,380
So it's good to see a kind of different take on the same kind of underlying technologies.

59
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:23,200
It seems like a trend in the way that we're developing software.

60
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:27,940
Well, something I'm looking forward to using in the near future is Nano 3.0, which has

61
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:30,160
been released, called Waterflowing Underground.

62
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:33,720
Sort of a strange name for it.

63
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:37,320
And Nano, it's not a big and exciting project.

64
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:42,480
It's just something that I use almost every day to edit config files on servers.

65
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:45,640
I think you use Nano as well, don't you, Wiz?

66
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:46,640
When I have to.

67
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:51,120
And, you know, Joe, if you would just switch on over to Arch, you'd have it already.

68
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:54,560
I played around with it just earlier today.

69
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:59,280
I'm not a huge Nano user, only because I've been using VI for so long, my fingers are

70
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,280
broken now.

71
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:04,800
But some of the things that they've included in 3.0, well, they're just really nice, especially

72
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:07,840
for a fundamental part of an operating system.

73
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:10,480
Things like reading files 70% faster.

74
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:14,480
A bunch of new shortcuts, I tried out Control Delete or Control Shift Delete, which erase

75
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:16,360
the next word or the previous word.

76
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:19,680
Now, of course, those are old hat for us VI users.

77
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:22,120
But it's a pretty big usability improvement in Nano.

78
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:24,440
Is it enough to tempt you to switch to Nano?

79
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:25,440
Definitely not.

80
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:29,520
But it is enough to convince me to get a little better at using Nano when I'm on a system

81
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:30,520
that doesn't have VI.

82
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:32,680
Yeah, I don't have very complex requirements.

83
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:37,800
That's why I've always just stuck with Nano and never bothered to learn VI or Emacs or

84
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,200
anything like that.

85
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:43,020
But it's good to see that it is being actively developed.

86
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:47,160
And there are major improvements happening, like you said.

87
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:50,080
So I don't know, I don't think I need to move off at any time soon.

88
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:52,920
No, and it's important to have just an easy to use.

89
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:55,920
You know, VI is great when you use it, but it's like any other power tool.

90
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:59,040
If you just need to, you know, change one config file, you don't need to learn a whole

91
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:01,080
new paradigm of text editing.

92
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:02,680
Nano fills that gap very nicely.

93
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:07,060
Well, speaking of filling gaps, we know that Dropbox is going away for a lot of people

94
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:09,720
who don't use EXT4.

95
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:12,800
And Nextcloud seems to be the obvious replacement for that.

96
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:15,780
And they've had a release this week as well, Nextcloud 14 has come out.

97
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:18,600
There's lots of good things to talk about with Nextcloud 14.

98
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:21,760
But in particular, it seems like they're really focusing on accessibility.

99
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:25,120
Yeah, there don't seem to be kind of huge new features here.

100
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:31,640
It just seems to be a focus on usability and refinement of the user experience.

101
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:35,880
And you mentioned the accessibility there, they've massively improved the experience

102
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:38,520
for people who are using screen readers.

103
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:41,560
And that's something that a lot of people don't think about.

104
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:46,920
And it is good to see them implementing this stuff to make it usable for everyone.

105
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:51,300
I think that makes a huge difference, especially, you know, oftentimes those groups aren't large

106
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:55,760
enough for proprietary applications to really feel a need to design around them.

107
00:05:55,760 --> 00:06:01,000
But when we're trying to build, you know, free and open source software for all of humanity,

108
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,080
that is a really important group of people that deserve to use that software just as

109
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:05,560
much as everyone else.

110
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:09,440
But we need to have a good culture to encourage those designs.

111
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:12,280
And it's great to see Nextcloud taking those concrete steps.

112
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:14,440
I tried to install this on a droplet today.

113
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:18,040
And I just got this weird error, and I just didn't have time to deal with it.

114
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:26,120
So I just did snap, install Nextcloud, dash dash edge, and boom, it just sets it all up.

115
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:29,700
So if you do want to just quickly test it out, I would strongly recommend the snap because

116
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:33,320
it just makes it so much easier, sets all the database and everything up for you.

117
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:35,780
Oh, that is so handy.

118
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:38,800
One other thing I saw here is they've also done a bunch of improvements to make small

119
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:43,960
screens like mobile or tablet devices work, which as someone looking to maybe move over

120
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:47,320
to Nextcloud in the near future, that's an essential component for me.

121
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:48,320
Oh, definitely.

122
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:49,320
Yeah.

123
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:54,360
I mean, that's been a criticism of mine before, that it's not as mobile friendly as something

124
00:06:54,360 --> 00:07:00,260
like Dropbox or Google Drive, where it's just a first class mobile experience.

125
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:01,920
And I don't think we're there yet with Nextcloud.

126
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:05,160
But it's good to see that they're moving in that direction that they are starting to take

127
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:12,040
note of the fact that real people, for want of a better word, not developers, and perhaps

128
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:15,880
the people who are listening to this show, most people don't use computers very much

129
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:16,880
anymore.

130
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:17,960
They use their phones and tablets.

131
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:22,320
So I think if you're going to have mass adoption of this, you do need to focus on that.

132
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:23,320
Yeah.

133
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:24,320
And it's just so handy, right?

134
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:25,320
If you can easily go...

135
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:26,320
I know so many people, right?

136
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:28,920
You have Dropbox, you throw a file up there, then you have access to it on your phone,

137
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:33,280
which might otherwise be a somewhat hostile environment to doing complex workflows, Nextcloud

138
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:34,280
could be a big asset.

139
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:37,120
Well, Mozilla are certainly focusing on mobile.

140
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:43,120
And this week, they announced that Firefox Focus is going to move over to the Gecko engine.

141
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,840
It's pretty exciting, really.

142
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:49,800
And if you're not familiar with Firefox Focus, well, it's basically private browsing as an

143
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:50,800
app.

144
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,780
It automatically blocks ads and trackers.

145
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:57,400
And it looks like they even have just an instant history erase button in this newest release.

146
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:59,360
Yeah, it's a really great little browser.

147
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:03,960
It's super fast because obviously blocking all of that tracking stuff is just going to

148
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:05,480
make your experience much better.

149
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:12,320
It's not really full featured enough to use as a main browser, I don't think.

150
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:17,040
And I wonder how much of that is because it was based on WebView before.

151
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:20,400
And maybe it's going to be a nice experience now they're moving over to Gecko.

152
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:21,640
Certainly seems like it.

153
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:25,300
Gecko is the existing Firefox rendering engine.

154
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:30,280
But up till now, Firefox Focus was just using WebView, which is built into Android, doesn't

155
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:31,280
have a lot of features.

156
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:36,720
They really kind of expect you to use the Android APIs and not the web APIs with WebView.

157
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:41,800
Mozilla has done a ton of work to refactor Gecko into what they're calling GeckoView,

158
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:45,960
which is Gecko packaged as a reusable Android library.

159
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:50,560
Which sounds like an excellent win for open standards rather than having to use the Android

160
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:52,040
APIs and everything.

161
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:57,840
This is web standards which anyone can use and they're encouraging people to bake this

162
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:59,720
into their applications, aren't they?

163
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:00,720
The GeckoView.

164
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:06,220
Yeah, they've also released Android components, a collection of independent ready to use libraries

165
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:09,860
for building browsers and browser-like applications on Android.

166
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:12,680
And now GeckoView is just one of those components.

167
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:17,440
Now this is going to be a fairly slow rollout of the GeckoView version of Firefox Focus.

168
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:22,040
So that means that the app that you download is going to be bigger because it's going to

169
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:24,380
have both for a while.

170
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:29,320
But they're going to slowly test it with more and more people until hopefully it's going

171
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:31,160
to become default fairly soon.

172
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:32,160
Yeah, stay tuned.

173
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:33,160
Go give it a try.

174
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:35,920
You can go check, you know, whatever user agent in your browser.

175
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:40,940
If you see Gecko in there, then you know you're using the new GeckoView version.

176
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:44,320
You might wonder why you would want to use this sort of like trimmed down browser.

177
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:48,480
I think for people who aren't experts who don't really know how to manage all the complexities

178
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:53,480
that are involved with cookies and tracking everything involved in the modern web today,

179
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:54,480
Focus is just that.

180
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:58,000
It's focus, it's small, and you know that your privacy is protected because Mozilla

181
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
cares about it.

182
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,960
It is actually in the beta version, so you can test it out straight away if you want

183
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:03,960
to.

184
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:08,960
But moving on to Chrome OS, version 70 is going to bring native network file share support,

185
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:14,880
which is excellent news for people in the enterprise or education markets who want to

186
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:17,640
be able to connect to Windows file shares.

187
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:23,220
It's the continued progression of Chrome OS becoming a big boy operating system.

188
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:28,120
First it was just for web interfaces, then we got Android app support, now Linux apps,

189
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:29,800
and finally Windows network shares.

190
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:33,040
I might actually be able to use this in my day to day.

191
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:35,640
Now this feature has been around for a little while.

192
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:40,640
It was first implemented back in March, but only now are they switching on the flag to

193
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,120
actually enable it.

194
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:46,920
Yeah, looks like you should be expecting to see it in the upcoming M70 release.

195
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:52,400
Accompanying that, and really showing that Google is aiming for enterprises' big installations

196
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:57,840
of Chrome OS, there is going to be a Chrome policy to enable or disable NetBio Samba share

197
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:59,540
discovery automatically.

198
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:03,080
By default for non-enterprises, that'll just be there, so when you pop up Chrome OS, you

199
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:05,800
can automatically discover all the shares on your network.

200
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:08,720
If you need more control, well, they've got a solution for you.

201
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:12,840
This does beg the question of what's the point of Chrome OS then?

202
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:16,280
Surely the point of it was that it was so simple.

203
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:17,680
It was just a web browser.

204
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:19,280
There was nothing to go wrong with it.

205
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:22,160
There was nothing to maintain.

206
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:28,400
Security was tight, and as they keep adding more and more features to it, it does make

207
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:34,000
me wonder, well, what sets it apart from just a normal Linux desktop at that point?

208
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,800
It has definitely lost its tight focus.

209
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:41,000
Now they are adding things piecemeal and slowly, and it does seem like they've started with

210
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:45,360
a minimal base and added things on as they could, so that might be better from a management

211
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:49,880
and a security aspect, but the question remains, can they do this without making it feel bloated,

212
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:52,760
and will it still be simple for end users to use?

213
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:57,560
I think that it will, and maybe it's unfair to compare it to a proper Linux desktop because

214
00:11:57,560 --> 00:12:04,480
you can do so much more with the Linux desktop, but I do worry about feature creep and I worry

215
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:08,280
maybe unnecessarily really because I suppose they have to broaden their markets, don't

216
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:10,640
they, and they want to get into enterprise.

217
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:15,800
Clearly that's what this is about, and they want to appeal to more and more people, and

218
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:22,000
perhaps they have exhausted the market that they already have access to, and they need

219
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:26,960
to implement these new features to be relevant to other markets, and because you can turn

220
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:31,520
this stuff off, it means you can use it as you were anyway, so it's probably not going

221
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:33,460
to affect the existing users.

222
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:38,120
It does feel a bit like Google's exploring around to find out how many features are just

223
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:42,240
enough to make it usable to a broader audience, but aren't too many.

224
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:43,520
Does it stop here?

225
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:44,520
Will we see more?

226
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:45,520
I guess we wait and see.

227
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:48,960
I think, though, that if they really want to crack the enterprise market, they need

228
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:51,640
to think about longer support times.

229
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:57,920
Just recently, the Chromebook Pixel, the original really expensive one, dropped out of support,

230
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:01,840
and that was after five years, and that's five years since it first came out.

231
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:06,200
Obviously there would have been people buying them a year or two into that, which doesn't

232
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:09,160
seem like long enough to me, really.

233
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:10,160
Four or five years support.

234
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:14,960
If you look at something like Windows XP, how long was that supported for?

235
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:20,240
And you look at Red Hat Enterprise Linux, you can get 10 years.

236
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:25,440
I think that surely must be where they need to go next.

237
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:28,840
I wonder, though, because it's coming from the phone marketplace where it's like two,

238
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:32,000
three years of support, five years might seem kind of generous.

239
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,160
Well, certainly in the consumer space, yeah.

240
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:39,240
Most people's Windows laptops probably didn't last much longer until they slowed down to

241
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:42,480
the point where they were unusable, and people used to go and buy a new one.

242
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:48,120
Now they just buy an iPad to replace it, but I think in enterprise, I don't know, isn't

243
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:51,960
five years, well, five years sounds about right, but it's not five years.

244
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:52,960
Is it in reality?

245
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:57,320
Because it's five years since the product is launched, and people don't necessarily

246
00:13:57,320 --> 00:14:02,480
get hold of it straight away, and it might be a year or two or maybe even more down the

247
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:03,480
line.

248
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:07,880
And so you're potentially looking at two to three years of actual usable support there,

249
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:10,040
and I don't think that's going to wash in the enterprise.

250
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:14,160
Yeah, and you do have to wonder, too, especially with such a connected operating system, how

251
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:15,840
usable is it outside of the support?

252
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:18,400
Without support, is it really even a good value proposition anymore?

253
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:22,480
Well, I would say certainly not, because that's where the whole security aspect comes from,

254
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:24,000
is staying up to date.

255
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:30,920
And Chrome OS has been so good over the years at updating itself, and it's all been a flawless

256
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:34,440
background thing that no one even notices.

257
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:38,360
Whereas once you get to the end of that support, you're not getting your security updates anymore.

258
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:40,240
It's just unusable at that point.

259
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:42,720
Sounds like, Joe, you're still not sold on Chrome OS.

260
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:46,960
No, I'm not, but I'm definitely not sold on Windows 10.

261
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:52,920
There was a big kerfuffle this week about a feature that Microsoft slipped into a Windows

262
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:58,680
Insider build, but then pulled out of it fairly quickly.

263
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:01,920
So imagine this, you've just set up your new Windows machine.

264
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:05,660
One of the first things I usually do is, well, install the web browser of my choice.

265
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:11,360
You start doing that, and up pops this dialogue, hey there, you already have Microsoft Edge,

266
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:14,160
the safer, faster browser for Windows.

267
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:17,760
And then it's got a default there, just open Microsoft Edge, don't bother installing any

268
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:20,280
of that other open source software that you've got.

269
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:24,400
It's really not a surprise that they removed this straight away, but what were they thinking

270
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:26,120
even trying this in the first place?

271
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:31,880
I mean, okay, it didn't make it into a final release or anything, and it was just a very

272
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:32,880
short experiment.

273
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:39,040
But especially with all the antitrust stuff that they've had in Europe, why would they

274
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:40,740
possibly do this?

275
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:43,840
It does really bring back a bad taste from that era.

276
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:46,960
Now I think it's fair to say that Google does some of their own, if you're using another

277
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:51,760
browser when you're searching Google, they'll often pop up things suggesting that they prefer

278
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:54,120
Chrome, they recommend Chrome to you.

279
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:59,120
But using an online service versus an operating system, to me, I know the industry might think

280
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:02,480
other things, but to me, those still aren't the same thing.

281
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:08,700
Now when I read more into this, I was suddenly reminded of Proton, which is Valve's system

282
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:12,000
for playing Windows games in Steam.

283
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:16,480
And I remember talking about that and speculating, why are they doing this?

284
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:19,000
And then it dawned on me.

285
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:25,740
The reason that this big warning came up in Windows is because it's part of them moving

286
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:30,200
towards an App Store only system for installing software.

287
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:35,040
You will still have the option, at least for now, to install just random binaries downloaded

288
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:41,160
from the web, but when you install something like Spotify, it then says, hey, why don't

289
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:43,440
you just get it from the App Store?

290
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:52,300
And so perhaps it was Valve seeing this coming that has kind of reignited the fire under

291
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:57,920
Linux and Steam OS and that backup plan that they always had, because that was the primary

292
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:01,600
reason or at least that's what we all speculated at the time before them coming up with Steam

293
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,680
on Linux and Steam OS.

294
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:11,440
It was because Microsoft might go to an iOS style, no sideloading, everything coming from

295
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:13,560
the App Store system.

296
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:20,040
And this seems to be more evidence of Windows, very, very slowly at least, moving towards

297
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:21,040
that.

298
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:26,200
Yeah, we've already seen some minimal versions that have more restrictions placed on them

299
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:30,720
and Windows has become something of a connected internet operating system.

300
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:35,600
Windows 10 versus Windows 7, for instance, well, it's a big difference from the old Windows

301
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:39,120
that we all knew and, well, maybe not loved, but we're accustomed to.

302
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:43,240
Yeah, suddenly it kind of all clicked together in my head and it made me realize that Valve

303
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:47,920
are very clever for investing more into the Linux side of their business.

304
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:51,320
So yeah, well done for seeing that coming.

305
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:52,560
Suddenly it makes sense to me.

306
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:55,040
Well, let's end with some excellent news.

307
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:59,360
And we did talk about this on Linux Unplugged 266, so we'll not talk too much here.

308
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:02,960
Microsoft Jupiter Broadcasting has joined forces with Linux Academy.

309
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:07,160
Now you may have noticed a lack of adverts on shows since the beginning of September.

310
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:08,160
That wasn't a mistake.

311
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,720
That wasn't us forgetting to do them.

312
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:12,680
That was part of this merger.

313
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:15,880
Now I don't know about you, Wes, but I am incredibly happy about this.

314
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:21,620
It means that I can now work on Jupiter Broadcasting basically full time and you've switched your

315
00:18:21,620 --> 00:18:22,620
job over, haven't you?

316
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:25,080
Now you're doing podcasting full time.

317
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:26,080
That's right.

318
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:28,240
And yeah, I could not be more excited about this.

319
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:31,840
We've all been putting a lot of work into this on both sides of the fence.

320
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:36,700
And really Jupiter Broadcasting and Linux Academy were already pretty well aligned.

321
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:41,240
We both care a huge amount about Linux, open source technologies, and inspiring people

322
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:43,800
to use those and create awesome stuff.

323
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:49,720
Now we can leverage all of that together, create much better content, have more focus,

324
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:51,400
and inspire the community.

325
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:55,320
Now nothing is really going to change apart from the lack of adverts because, well, they

326
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:58,680
liked what we were doing and they want us to keep doing it.

327
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:03,320
But one thing that has changed is User Error has come back with a new set of hosts, including

328
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:08,780
me and Alan Pope, better known as Popey, and Daniel Foray from Elementary.

329
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:15,560
And also a fourth seat, which was empty on episode 48, which was kind of a comeback episode.

330
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:17,160
But that will be kind of rotating.

331
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:19,280
Chris will come along sometimes.

332
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:24,120
Maybe even you, Wes, maybe other friends of the show, basically whoever we want.

333
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:26,720
So do check it out, error.show slash 48.

334
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:27,720
It was good fun.

335
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:29,080
I enjoyed it a lot.

336
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:32,360
I think it's a great show and it's a great rebirth.

337
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:36,520
And it's just a sign of more good things to come as a result of this merger.

338
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:39,000
Yeah, I am really excited about this.

339
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,560
It's a huge opportunity for me and for us all.

340
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:48,080
And it means that we can open source some of the code that makes the backend stuff work

341
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:50,040
and also help out the community.

342
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:55,840
So do check out episode 266 of Linux Unplugged, where we speak about it quite a bit more.

343
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:59,960
Now if you don't want to miss that or any of the exciting stories we cover here on Linux
