00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,480
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News. Episode 198, recorded on July 17th, 2021. I'm Chris.

2
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:10,480
And I'm Wes.

3
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:12,140
Hello, Wes. Let's do the news.

4
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:17,000
And this is Steam Deck. It's a handheld, high-powered gaming device that lets you take your Steam

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,800
library with you wherever you are. It's got a beautiful seven-inch display, ergonomic

6
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:26,880
controls that are really built for long play sessions, and a new look for Steam designed

7
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:31,800
for Steam Deck. You can think about Steam Deck like a portable gaming PC with built-in

8
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:32,800
controllers.

9
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:37,640
And it runs Linux. Arch Linux, actually, with a Plasma desktop.

10
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:42,240
Yep, that's right. And it's available for reservation right now. The first units, Valvik

11
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:44,840
Specs, will ship in December 2021.

12
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:53,840
It comes in at three different price points. $399, $529, and $649. Each price brings more

13
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:59,240
storage with the top two tiers offering faster built-in storage, but all levels come with

14
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:01,620
an SD card slot for some expansion.

15
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:05,580
In an interview with IGN, Gabe Newell says they had to work aggressively to get the price

16
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:10,520
points down to where they are now. Note, this clip I'm about to play from IGN, it has music

17
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:14,680
baked in. I apologize for that. But we think that the information from the bearded horse's

18
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:19,600
mouth is worth it.

19
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:24,000
One of the things we're testing on this is that price performance is going to be one

20
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:30,420
of the critical factors in the mobile space. And so we've had to be very aggressive in

21
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:34,320
terms of pricing on the deck.

22
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:38,880
Because of its form factor, many people are comparing the deck to the Nintendo Switch.

23
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:42,840
Sure, that was one of my first thoughts as well. But when you look at the specs, Valve

24
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:46,840
has managed to cram into the deck. I think maybe the comparison becomes a little less

25
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:52,600
clear. The deck has an AMD Zen 2 processor with 4 cores and 8 threads. It's got 16 gigabytes

26
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:58,200
of RAM and has an 8 core GPU that bursts up to 1.6 GHz. So in a lot of ways, this is more

27
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:03,400
comparable to a modern Xbox, but just in a portable form factor. And Valve's actually

28
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:09,040
hoping that the combination of this hardware running at 720p on the display will produce

29
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:14,960
really good gameplay, even at rather high game settings. And their goal is to potentially

30
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:15,960
sell millions.

31
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:20,880
So our view is if we're doing this right, that we're going to be selling these millions

32
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:28,800
of units, and it's clearly going to be establishing a product category that ourselves and other

33
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:33,440
PC manufacturers are going to be able to participate in. And that's going to have long-term benefits

34
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:37,240
for us. So that's sort of the frame in which we're thinking about this.

35
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:43,480
Valve is talking about defining a whole new product category here. One that would be powered

36
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:44,480
by Linux.

37
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:49,920
And the reaction overall seems really positive. You can really see if you've been watching

38
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:55,040
Valve for a while, a lot of the lessons they've learned building hardware over the years are

39
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:56,360
baked into the deck.

40
00:02:56,360 --> 00:03:01,300
Ultimately, it's an evolution of years of hardware and software design work. We've taken everything

41
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:06,320
we've learned from developing the Steam Controller, Steam Machine, Steam Link, and Valve Index,

42
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:10,680
along with the Steam Client, and applied all of that collective experience in designing

43
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:11,680
Steam Deck.

44
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:16,560
That's Eric from Valve, and a video they created for developers interested in supporting

45
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,160
the Deck.

46
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:22,760
One of those hardware lessons that set the Deck apart from devices like the Switch are

47
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:28,960
the built-in trackpads. And while definitely something we'll want to go hands-on with,

48
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:32,600
the way Valve describes them sounds promising.

49
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:37,040
The trackpads here are an evolution of the same technology that we've been working on

50
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:42,360
since the Steam Controller days and experimenting with internally. You also have seen some of

51
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:45,920
our trackpad work as part of the Index Controller, for example.

52
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:50,440
They can be used for many different things. We have a keyboard that lets you do dual thumb

53
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:56,160
typing. In-game, you can map them to areas of the screen for a mouse cursor to jump there

54
00:03:56,160 --> 00:04:02,240
and be kind of a one-to-one region type input. You can create on-screen menus that pop up

55
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:09,360
on top of the game and have many customizable macro buttons or keyboard keys. And you can

56
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:14,400
just use it for mouse input, where it's really powerful and reliable for the people that

57
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,760
are comfortable with that sort of input.

58
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:22,400
And something that Valve stresses multiple times in their interviews is the Deck is just

59
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:28,240
a PC. An open PC at that, you could even load Windows on it. And users will be able to connect

60
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:35,280
just about any device compatible with Linux to the Deck, but Valve is also working on

61
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:36,960
a direct dock solution.

62
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:40,080
Yes, we're producing a dock. It'll be sold separately.

63
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,800
Is there a price on that yet?

64
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,840
We don't have a price for you today.

65
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:46,120
Will that be available at launch?

66
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:48,120
Don't have that answer for you yet today either.

67
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:52,840
There's plenty of existing off-the-shelf solutions. I don't think that it'll be, you know, providing

68
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:56,340
this nice experience, but a similar functionality.

69
00:04:56,340 --> 00:05:02,360
Any USB-C dock that you can buy off the shelf will work with this, and it'll do USB, Ethernet,

70
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:05,160
and HDMI out, all of the things you would expect from a dock.

71
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:10,080
One thing we don't have a very clear picture of just yet is the battery life.

72
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:13,960
Well, there's a wide variety of experiences there. It's about two to eight hours, depending

73
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:17,480
on what you're doing. You can play Portal 2 for four hours on this thing. If you limit

74
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:20,440
to 30 FPS, you're going to be playing for five to six hours.

75
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:25,360
That's something we're going to want to test when we get our hands on the actual hardware.

76
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:29,880
One aspect that's caught the attention of some developers is the Deck's launch is really

77
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:34,440
focused on Proton for game compatibility. In fact, there's hardly a word about native

78
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:39,880
gameplay at all from Valve in the announcements or in their documentation for developers.

79
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:44,280
Steam Deck runs games using Proton. And if you aren't familiar with Proton, it was originally

80
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:50,200
released back in 2018, and it's a compatibility layer that allows Windows games to run on

81
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:51,200
Linux.

82
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:56,160
And it seems Valve is shooting for the moon when it comes to compatibility with Proton.

83
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:00,560
The team has been working on and improving Proton for a while now. Most APIs are already

84
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:05,000
supported by Proton, and most games already just work. And the team is building support

85
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,560
for more APIs and enabling more games by default.

86
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:12,940
Our goal is for every game to work by the time we ship Steam Deck. We are constantly

87
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:16,880
building on Proton, and there's a lot of work that has been done that doesn't yet affect

88
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:21,460
the public version of Proton, including testing of thousands of games, engaging with third

89
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:26,160
parties like anti-cheat providers, work targeting game compatibility, and more.

90
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:30,400
Yeah, Valve says they're actually going for 100% compatibility and that they'll be working

91
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:35,440
with anti-cheat vendors directly to try to get Proton compatibility. I have been contacted

92
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:40,760
by some developers in the Linux game space, however, that say that they've been nudged

93
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:45,880
or encouraged by Valve to focus on a Proton version of their game instead of a native

94
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:49,520
Linux port that they might have already had in the works. I don't know if that's true

95
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:53,600
or not, those are just the rumors going around on the internet that Valve seems to be really

96
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:57,680
pushing for Proton, but I could see in this early stage they really want the narrative

97
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:02,340
to be around compatibility. They don't want users or developers thinking games are all

98
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:06,320
going to have to be ported in order for them to work on the Deck. I can see Valve wanting

99
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:09,240
to focus a lot on that Proton compatibility right now.

100
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:13,440
Yeah, it seems clear that they want to have a narrative out there for developers. Listen,

101
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:17,800
this is new, it's different, you might not be experienced supporting a Linux-based platform.

102
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:18,800
We've got your back.

103
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:23,860
They definitely are getting developers hardware. It's just going to be a little bit and it

104
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:28,020
sounds like developer kits will be in very limited supply.

105
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:31,720
The answer is we're currently building dev kits and have earmarked some of those units

106
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:36,760
for partners like you to test your games. And these dev kits will be identical to the

107
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:40,620
same Steam Decks that we'll be shipping off to customers that they'll be playing later

108
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:46,060
this year, except for a few small cosmetic differences. And supplies are really limited

109
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:50,400
and so we're going to have a program where you're going to be able to request a dev kit

110
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:53,760
soon and we'll be sure to keep you posted and let you know the moment you can submit

111
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:54,760
a request.

112
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:58,560
Now I am a little concerned if they are pushing everyone towards Proton, if this is true or

113
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:03,360
not, and I could see that creating some incentives around the Steam platform, developers would

114
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:07,800
really be targeting the Proton environment, especially if something like the Deck really

115
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:11,480
took off and there were multiple versions by multiple hardware makers. I don't know

116
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:16,540
if you remember this, Wes, but Dell actually took a shot at creating a Switch-like machine

117
00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:18,640
a little while ago too, but bailed on the project.

118
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:19,640
Oh really?

119
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:23,680
Yeah, so you could see maybe if this sells well, Dell picks a project like that up again

120
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:27,520
and of course they're going to use SteamOS, it's free, and Valve is going to want to guarantee

121
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:32,320
that those games work like a console. And so maybe that's why they'd be pushing something

122
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:37,120
like Proton. I don't love that though, because I think the dream about Steam coming to Linux

123
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:42,440
originally was availability for all Linux distributions, getting games just native on

124
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:46,720
Linux, but if this is the case, I still am compelled to get one.

125
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:50,920
I mean, at the end of the day, it's a Linux machine that plays your games, right?

126
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:54,960
I love the form factor, I love that they're going to include the Plasma desktop, and like

127
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:59,120
they stressed over and over and over again, it's an open PC so you could really throw

128
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,300
anything on there.

129
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:04,520
Are you locked into Steam or can you, because you mentioned this a minute ago, Pierre-Luc,

130
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:10,080
or can I log into the Microsoft Store with my Game Pass Ultimate account or my Epic Game

131
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,080
Store account?

132
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:15,640
Again, you can really do anything that you would expect a PC to be able to do, so the

133
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:17,360
answer to those things is yes.

134
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:18,520
Yes, excellent.

135
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:24,760
The switch to Arch as the base for SteamOS is, frankly, a little surprising, and Valve

136
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:31,360
has confirmed users will have full access to Pac-Man and the usual Arch package repos.

137
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:36,040
We're going to dig more into the DeX Linux implementation with our expanded coverage

138
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:39,760
in this week's Linux Unplugged.

139
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:45,200
Well speaking of handheld-powered Linux devices, Ubuntu Touch OTA 18 has introduced a new way

140
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:49,300
for Ubuntu Touch to scale down the wallpapers that you have set.

141
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:51,600
You know, your high-resolution wallpapers, guess what?

142
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:54,960
They take a fair amount of RAM, and that's really going to benefit some of the lower-end

143
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:59,860
devices running Ubuntu Touch, like phones with less than a gigabyte of RAM.

144
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:04,960
This release also comes with an updated MediaHub component, which is being used by Ubuntu Touch

145
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:10,800
apps for audio and video playback, so expect a smoother, more reliable experience there.

146
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:14,880
And of course, there is, as always, a batch of bug fixes that just make your experience

147
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:20,800
smoother and more stable, but there is a significant fix in here for Google Pixel 2 devices that

148
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:23,760
were having audio call quality problems.

149
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:26,980
You'll definitely want to check the notes for that.

150
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:33,160
We covered Amazon's announcement of their Elasticsearch fork back in episode 173 in

151
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:35,000
late January.

152
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:42,440
This week, Amazon announced the first production-ready version of that fork, named OpenSearch.

153
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:46,160
Amazon first released OpenSearch back in April, but it was in alpha then.

154
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:48,800
It just really wasn't ready for production use.

155
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:52,800
Amazon's making the statement now with version 1.0, which is available up on GitHub, that

156
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:57,920
OpenSearch is ready for production environments, and Amazon is eager to remind everyone it's

157
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:01,080
very much open source and they would like your contributions.

158
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:02,680
In a blog post, they wrote,

159
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:09,920
We encourage anyone to use, modify, extend, embed, monetize, resell, and offer OpenSearch

160
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:13,120
as part of their products and services.

161
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:14,600
They go on to say,

162
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:18,080
Broad adoption benefits the entire community.

163
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:23,200
This has been in the works, really, since AWS launched its Elasticsearch service in

164
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:25,760
October of 2015.

165
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:32,120
That kicked off a whole series of events that have led us to this announcement today.

166
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:35,600
We are now living in a post-server-side public license era.

167
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:36,600
Yeah.

168
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:37,600
Okay.

169
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:42,280
So back in March of 2019, AWS created its own distribution of Elasticsearch.

170
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:44,840
Now that's distribution and not fork.

171
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:50,120
Because at the time, while they were unhappy that Elastic, the upstream developer of Elasticsearch,

172
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:54,240
sort of keeping some of their more useful components out of the core open source project

173
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:57,240
and making you pay for those.

174
00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:01,920
Amazon's new distro was called the Open Distro for Elasticsearch, and they were pretty clear

175
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:06,880
that they were not forking Elasticsearch and still intended to contribute back upstream.

176
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:11,800
Yeah, however, Elastic remained unhappy with the use of the Elasticsearch name by Amazon

177
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:14,200
and its trademarks, essentially.

178
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:18,920
And at the start of 2021, they changed the product to be dual license under their own

179
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:24,400
Elastic license and that SSPL or the server-side public license that was originally created

180
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:25,900
by MongoDB.

181
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:31,520
This relicensing had the effect of making it difficult for cloud providers to run Elasticsearch

182
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:36,880
as a service, since now they would have to publish all the proprietary magic in the backend

183
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:39,360
that actually makes that service work.

184
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:43,560
Elastic's move was also kind of unpopular with the open source community, especially

185
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:48,160
those who had contributed code, believing it would always be free to use under the Apache

186
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:59,800
2.0 license, but this time around with a new name and explicitly forked from Elasticsearch

187
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:02,800
just prior to those license changes.

188
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:08,120
The company also introduced open search dashboards, a fork of Kibana.

189
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:13,540
But now all of that is history, and the key question going forward is how successful was

190
00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:19,200
the company be in actually building a community around open search?

191
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:24,940
Linode.com slash LAN.

192
00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:29,040
Go there to get $100 in 60-day credit on a new account.

193
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:34,720
Linode started in 2003 as one of the very first companies in cloud computing.

194
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:40,120
And now, 18 years later, Linode is the largest independent open cloud provider in the world

195
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:45,680
with 11 global data centers serving nearly a million customers and businesses around

196
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:46,680
the globe.

197
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:50,800
Linode's mission, though, remains unchanged since the day it began, to accelerate innovation

198
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:55,480
by making cloud computing simple, affordable, and accessible to all.

199
00:13:55,480 --> 00:14:00,240
That's led to one of the best experiences out there, and why we host everything on Linode.

200
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:04,960
Linode has an easy-to-use, powerful cloud dashboard, S3-compatible object storage, bare

201
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:09,160
metal service cloud firewalls, DDoS protection, VLAN support, a powerful DNS manager, block

202
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:13,880
storage, object storage, Kubernetes support, and even simple one-click applications, plus

203
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:19,040
super fast networking and so much more, with pricing that's 30% to 50% cheaper than other

204
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:20,920
major cloud providers out there.

205
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:26,080
I find a simple $5 a month Linode offers a surprising amount of performance, and we love

206
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:28,680
their dedicated CPU instances for our encoding jobs.

207
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:33,880
And if you ever run into any trouble, Linode's got the best customer support out there, with

208
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:36,560
hundreds of guides and tutorials to help you get started.

209
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:39,400
And their community support, it runs deep.

210
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:44,080
They're making our Colony Reunion trip possible, with meetups in Salt Lake City and Denver,

211
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:47,340
and more along the way, all powered by Linode.

212
00:14:47,340 --> 00:14:48,600
So what do you gotta do?

213
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:53,920
Go use our $100 60-day credit to performance test your network, to build an application,

214
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:55,360
or to learn something.

215
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:57,840
You know, they do have a tutorial on IPperf.

216
00:14:57,840 --> 00:15:01,720
You can use that to diagnose your network performance and see what's up.

217
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:05,100
Plus, Linode could just be part of a multi-cloud strategy.

218
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:06,640
That's why you gotta go check it out.

219
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:09,720
There's a ton you can do, and a ton you can learn.

220
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:12,080
So go take advantage of that $100.

221
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:15,300
Sign up today at linode.com slash LAN.

222
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:21,000
Get that $100 60-day credit on your new Linode account, and of course, support Linux Action

223
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:38,880
News at linode.com slash LAN.

224
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:41,080
Are you ready for mobile to get simple?

225
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:42,080
Linux.ting.com.

226
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:46,420
You see, Ting is an MVNO, a mobile virtual network operator.

227
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:50,240
That means they're not digging holes and putting towers in, but they're getting access to the

228
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:51,240
same towers.

229
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:55,520
They're getting access to the big networks, but at a lower cost.

230
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:59,480
And with Ting Mobile, you get the same coast-to-coast coverage as you would with, say, one of those

231
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:05,640
big carriers, but you just pay less, and you get Ting's fantastic customer service.

232
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:10,320
All of Ting's plans are simple and straightforward, like their new set 12 plan, 12 gigs of data,

233
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:14,640
35 bucks a month, unlimited talk, unlimited text.

234
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:17,120
It's pretty great for 35 bucks a month.

235
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:20,360
And of course, they have family plans that are flexible that let you add as many lines

236
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:23,760
as you need, and every line has unlimited text and calls.

237
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:27,880
You get a shared pool of LTE and 5G, and they have flexible pricing.

238
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:33,200
If you use 2 gigs, 20 gigs, or a lot more, there's a perfect Ting plan just for you.

239
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:35,700
And every plan is contract-free.

240
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:41,680
With their great interface, fantastic, straightforward UI, it's simple to switch to Ting.

241
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:45,700
And pretty much any phone works with Ting because they do support so many networks.

242
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:51,520
So to get started, just go to linux.ting.com, check your current phone, create an account,

243
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:53,520
and pick the plan that's right for you.

244
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:55,920
When everything lines up, Ting will send you a SIM card.

245
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:58,920
You pop that in your phone, and you get activated in minutes.

246
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:02,640
Cutting your phone bill in half has never been easier with Ting's brand new plans.

247
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:04,840
It truly is the next generation of Ting mobile.

248
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:09,120
I've been a longtime customer, and I can tell you they've never had plans this great.

249
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:18,080
So go see how much you could save and take $25 off of that at linux.ting.com.

250
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:24,720
On Wednesday, July 14, Microsoft announced Windows 365, a new service that makes it possible

251
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:30,520
for users to run a full version of Windows right in a web browser on a device of their

252
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:31,520
choice.

253
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:37,700
The new service is based on a similar Azure offering, but at first will only be available

254
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:39,160
for businesses.

255
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:44,160
Although given Microsoft's tone and the announcements, it seems pretty likely it will become available

256
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:46,600
for consumers pretty soon.

257
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:53,240
Today we are continuing this journey and creating a new category with Windows, the cloud PC.

258
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:57,340
I'm excited to announce Windows 365.

259
00:17:57,340 --> 00:18:02,100
With Windows 365, we are making Windows available not just on Windows devices, but any device

260
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:04,180
harnessing the power of the cloud.

261
00:18:04,180 --> 00:18:06,440
This has never been done before, and think about it.

262
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:09,800
Just like applications were brought to the cloud with SaaS, we are now bringing the operating

263
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:12,120
system to the cloud with Windows 365.

264
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:16,400
That was Satya Nadella during the introduction, and they really emphasized the fact that you

265
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:21,840
can run this on Linux and Android and iPads, because Windows 365 is creating a virtual

266
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:24,280
PC in the cloud that you get access to.

267
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:28,580
The cloud PC you set up with Windows 365 can be completely personalized.

268
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:32,920
You get to choose how much RAM you want, like up to 16 gigs at least, and how much storage

269
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:35,600
you want, at least up to 512 gigabytes.

270
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:40,440
Things you tweak and change about the PC remain persistent even after you disconnect.

271
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:44,800
Microsoft says they've built this thing around a zero trust architecture, and they're also

272
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:49,240
offering an instant on boot experience, and well, I have to say all that seems pretty

273
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:50,240
likely.

274
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:52,760
I would expect Microsoft to invest heavily in the security architecture of this thing

275
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:58,560
such as it is, so that way services like Windows 365 would be compliant with some of the more

276
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:03,360
rigorous regulatory requirements out there, at least eventually.

277
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:07,060
And really, instant on, that sounds like a natural evolution of what Microsoft has been

278
00:19:07,060 --> 00:19:09,920
building with virtual machines for years.

279
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:10,920
Right.

280
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:15,600
There's a lot of things they've been working on here, including RDP, which is the back-end

281
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:16,600
protocol.

282
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:24,840
Now, Microsoft's been working on that since 1998 with Windows NT 4.0 Terminal Server Edition.

283
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:29,000
They've built numerous ways to deliver an RDP session, so it's not really a surprise

284
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,720
that they could get broad device compatibility that way.

285
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:39,440
What is new here is that this is a first-party offering right from Microsoft, and they're

286
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:43,200
strongly positioning it as a hybrid solution.

287
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:49,480
With Windows 365, the operating system itself becomes hybrid, accessible on the device as

288
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:50,480
well as the cloud.

289
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:55,100
Well, I guess in the aggregate, this might mean more Windows users.

290
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:58,440
You could especially see the use case scenario in the enterprise environment where you could

291
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:03,480
deploy cheap low-end hardware, maybe even Raspberry Pis, and just spin up a client that

292
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:07,720
connects to a Windows machine in the cloud that Microsoft is continually updating.

293
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:14,400
It's really going to be ideal, I hope, for potential and existing desktop Linux users.

294
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:18,760
You know, the ones that have that one Windows app that you just have to have for work or

295
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:19,760
whatever.

296
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:24,680
Now you'll be able to immediately and instantly load up a modern version of Windows that has

297
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:28,800
been built on a virtual server that is run by the OS vendor.

298
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:32,920
So not only does that mean more people are going to be able to use desktop Linux, Microsoft

299
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:36,480
says this is a long-term project, so it means they're going to be pushing the industry to

300
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:42,040
take this thing seriously and support Windows 365 like a full-fledged version of Windows

301
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:43,840
in a universal way.

302
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:45,280
That's huge for Linux users.

303
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:48,640
That means when they need Windows software, they're likely going to be able to run it

304
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:50,520
on Windows 365.

305
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:52,880
It's funny how this changes the framing a little bit.

306
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:57,680
I'm realizing that, okay, I don't love Windows in general, but I really don't like it running

307
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:58,680
on my device.

308
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:03,920
And if Microsoft makes it easy for me to just use Windows when I have to, that's honestly

309
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:04,920
pretty nice.

310
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:08,880
I've played with Azure virtual desktops a little bit and played with running VMs on

311
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:13,400
Azure, and none of it was as seamless as it sounds like Windows 365 is going to be.

312
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:17,080
And I'll say this too, Wes, I've always felt like the best way to run Windows is in the

313
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:21,040
safety of a virtual machine, and now they're just going to do it for you.

314
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:23,720
It is funny how long it took them to get here in a sense.

315
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:28,920
I mean, other providers like Amazon have had this for a while, but Microsoft being the

316
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:34,200
maker of the operating system, I think, does give them pretty good advantage as an example.

317
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:38,840
They've got some nice tie-ins with existing Microsoft admin tools built into this thing

318
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:39,840
already.

319
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:40,840
Yeah, I agree.

320
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:45,420
It does seem like this has been a long time in the works, a lot like the first story we

321
00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:47,400
started with with the deck.

322
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:51,280
The Steam Deck also feels like it's something that Valve has been working towards for a

323
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:52,480
long time.

324
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:58,520
But where Microsoft is going to stand out from, say, like the Amazon Web Services workspace

325
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:04,720
service, is Microsoft is going to offer a flat rate fee instead of a consumption-based

326
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:07,800
fee structure like it does for Azure and AWS does.

327
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:12,240
So they may have something that people can just pay a flat rate, maybe consumers could

328
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:17,920
pay like $10 a month and they get access to Windows 365 and Office 365 and they get everybody

329
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:19,160
all nice and locked in.

330
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:22,720
You know, that seems like where this is going.

331
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:26,600
But I look at it as an opportunity to enable more desktop Linux and I prefer to look at

332
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:27,600
it that way.

333
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:30,240
But we'll keep an eye on it and we'll keep an eye on everything else going on in the

334
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:31,240
open source Linux world.
