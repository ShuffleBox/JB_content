00:00.000 --> 00:09.480
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, episode 133, recorded on November 24th, 2019.

00:09.480 --> 00:10.480
I'm Chris.

00:10.480 --> 00:11.480
And I'm Joe.

00:11.480 --> 00:12.480
Hello, Joe.

00:12.480 --> 00:13.640
Good to be connected with you.

00:13.640 --> 00:16.840
We start this week with great news for security researchers.

00:16.840 --> 00:21.680
Yeah, Mozilla, GitLab, and Google have all increased their bug bounty amounts.

00:21.680 --> 00:25.200
Yeah, I'll get to some of the dollar amounts here in a second, because these are some big

00:25.200 --> 00:26.200
numbers.

00:26.200 --> 00:30.600
I thought it was noteworthy that Mozilla is expanding their program not only to include

00:30.600 --> 00:37.080
Firefox bugs, but also they're adding their core sites to their program like Firefox Monitor,

00:37.080 --> 00:41.120
the Firefox Private Network, a lot of their tools that they've been releasing as part

00:41.120 --> 00:46.400
of the overall Firefox brand are now getting included in part of their bug bounty program.

00:46.400 --> 00:47.400
And that's pretty neat.

00:47.400 --> 00:48.700
I also like to see what GitLab is doing.

00:48.700 --> 00:54.080
But I think the big story in all of this, like the real numbers, is the Android stuff.

00:54.080 --> 00:56.320
These are like, change your life kind of numbers.

00:56.320 --> 01:00.440
Yeah, the top amount if you find a security flaw in the Titanium secure element on the

01:00.440 --> 01:06.040
pixel devices, in a developer preview is $1.5 million.

01:06.040 --> 01:08.320
I mean, that is life changing.

01:08.320 --> 01:09.920
Yeah, it really is incredible.

01:09.920 --> 01:13.320
And there's other numbers for other bugs, obviously, they're still pretty mind boggling.

01:13.320 --> 01:19.320
There's a $500,000 reward, depending on the particular exploit category.

01:19.320 --> 01:20.900
There's a range here.

01:20.900 --> 01:24.500
But what I think it really is saying is that Google is getting more and more confident

01:24.500 --> 01:28.960
in the pixel, Titan, Android stack overall.

01:28.960 --> 01:30.520
Yeah, it is saying that.

01:30.520 --> 01:34.480
But it's also saying that they'd much rather have these vulnerabilities disclosed on their

01:34.480 --> 01:35.480
terms.

01:35.480 --> 01:39.640
Yeah, I can understand why it's a, it's a much more manageable situation there.

01:39.640 --> 01:43.840
There's a lot of end users, not to mention the reputation on the line, a couple of highlights

01:43.840 --> 01:44.840
from 2019.

01:44.840 --> 01:50.500
So far, their total payments Google's in the last 12 months have been $1.5 million.

01:50.500 --> 01:57.360
Over 100 participating researchers have received an average reward amount of over $3,800 per

01:57.360 --> 01:58.360
finding.

01:58.360 --> 02:01.980
That worth noting is a 46% increase from last year.

02:01.980 --> 02:05.560
And you've got to assume with them up in the dollar amounts, along with Mozilla and GitLab,

02:05.560 --> 02:08.160
that more people are going to go after this stuff.

02:08.160 --> 02:14.040
And we know there are already a lot of very shady companies finding these exploits and

02:14.040 --> 02:15.040
selling them.

02:15.040 --> 02:20.360
But obviously, it's better for everyone apart from those shady companies, if it's done properly

02:20.360 --> 02:21.520
like this.

02:21.520 --> 02:25.320
And it gives these researchers an opportunity to put their name out there in a really legitimate

02:25.320 --> 02:27.720
way that looks good on a resume.

02:27.720 --> 02:30.360
And a little cash infusion never hurt anybody.

02:30.360 --> 02:34.440
But it also is an implicit acknowledgement by Google that they really are trusting the

02:34.440 --> 02:39.340
Titan M platform, because that's where a lot of this focuses on, but also Android itself,

02:39.340 --> 02:41.160
on the pixel devices, at least.

02:41.160 --> 02:46.480
And I think that matters when you're looking at the security optics of both iOS and Android.

02:46.480 --> 02:52.400
I think Google taking this position is a bigger picture issue that matters more than it might

02:52.400 --> 02:53.400
look on the surface.

02:53.400 --> 02:57.720
Well, Google are keen to show that they care about Android security, but also for Chrome

02:57.720 --> 02:58.720
OS.

02:58.720 --> 03:04.760
And this week, although not officially announced, we've got a good indication that Chrome OS

03:04.760 --> 03:10.560
devices are going to be required to support FOPD and the LVFS project going forward.

03:10.560 --> 03:12.560
This is outstanding news.

03:12.560 --> 03:19.040
I think we all know and appreciate that up to date secure firmwares are a critical part

03:19.040 --> 03:21.520
of a nutritious security diet.

03:21.520 --> 03:25.640
And you can't have a secure box if you're not updating your firmwares properly.

03:25.640 --> 03:29.720
Now, how you do that really varies vendor by vendor.

03:29.720 --> 03:35.640
And over the last year and change, we have seen a massive consolidation around LVFS and

03:35.640 --> 03:36.640
the FOPD service.

03:36.640 --> 03:39.440
I think this is pretty neat.

03:39.440 --> 03:46.560
I also now have a tinge of concern because this project needs a little structure, I think,

03:46.560 --> 03:47.560
at this point.

03:47.560 --> 03:48.800
And I have all due respect for Richard.

03:48.800 --> 03:49.800
He's done an incredible job.

03:49.800 --> 03:51.120
And who the hell am I to say?

03:51.120 --> 03:56.160
But we now have a lot of vendors on board with this thing and a lot of end users using

03:56.160 --> 03:57.160
this thing.

03:57.160 --> 04:01.840
And to bring on a whole bunch of Chromebooks, I feel, takes this to a whole new level.

04:01.840 --> 04:06.520
Well, this comes from Richard Hughes' blog, where he says he's been told by several sources,

04:06.520 --> 04:12.960
but not by Google directly, that from Christmas onwards, the Designed for Chromebook sticker

04:12.960 --> 04:19.040
requires hardware vendors to use FOPD rather than random non-free binaries.

04:19.040 --> 04:24.700
And then he goes on to detail exactly how these vendors should contact him and should

04:24.700 --> 04:26.960
go about implementing FOPD.

04:26.960 --> 04:30.680
And it's quite complicated, to say the least.

04:30.680 --> 04:36.880
What came out to me is he's a bit frustrated that this hasn't gone super smooth with previous

04:36.880 --> 04:37.880
OEMs.

04:37.880 --> 04:41.200
He says here, I might sound like a grumpy, upstream maintainer.

04:41.200 --> 04:42.200
I apologize.

04:42.200 --> 04:46.480
I'm currently working with about half a dozen silicon suppliers who have all failed some

04:46.480 --> 04:48.800
or all of the above bullets.

04:48.800 --> 04:54.120
He goes on to say, I'm multiplexing myself with about a dozen companies right now.

04:54.120 --> 04:58.260
And supporting FOPD isn't actually my entire job at Red Hat.

04:58.260 --> 05:01.800
This project has been such a game changer for the Linux landscape.

05:01.800 --> 05:04.980
Not just desktops, not just laptops, not just Chromebooks, servers too.

05:04.980 --> 05:08.520
And this project feels like it's getting pretty dang important.

05:08.520 --> 05:12.000
And I know there's been some coordination with the Linux Foundation.

05:12.000 --> 05:14.160
There's been some changes there.

05:14.160 --> 05:18.660
But it kind of seems like maybe this is starting to become something important enough to dedicate

05:18.660 --> 05:19.660
full time to.

05:19.660 --> 05:22.920
Maybe it needs a project manager to help interface with these OEMs.

05:22.920 --> 05:23.920
I don't know.

05:23.920 --> 05:25.400
I'm just some podcaster in a studio.

05:25.400 --> 05:30.080
But I get a sense that this project has reached a new level.

05:30.080 --> 05:34.120
And I mean, really, when Lenovo came on board, let's be honest, when you started getting

05:34.120 --> 05:39.800
Dell and Lenovo and Acer and all these firmware updates for server platforms all started coming

05:39.800 --> 05:43.880
through LVFS, I think that's when we crossed a line of criticalness.

05:43.880 --> 05:48.440
But if Google's taking that sticker saying design for Chromebooks and saying compliance

05:48.440 --> 05:55.440
with this sticker means using LVFS in Fwepty, we cross into a whole new threshold, Joe.

05:55.440 --> 05:59.400
Well, yeah, hopefully Google are going to pony up the cash to make it happen, because

05:59.400 --> 06:04.760
it's clearly going to be very important to them, especially for their security story.

06:04.760 --> 06:07.160
So maybe this really is great news for the project.

06:07.160 --> 06:08.160
Oh, I think so.

06:08.160 --> 06:10.240
I mean, these are growing pains that I just brought up.

06:10.240 --> 06:11.560
I'm sure they can be solved.

06:11.560 --> 06:15.700
For all I know, Huesies is already well into a plan to solve this.

06:15.700 --> 06:19.360
It sounds like from this post, things are a little frustrating today.

06:19.360 --> 06:20.880
I hope to see this take off, though.

06:20.880 --> 06:24.720
I mean, there's so clearly a need for this.

06:24.720 --> 06:29.720
And if the more vendors we get into this, just the better the experience is for Linux

06:29.720 --> 06:30.720
users.

06:30.720 --> 06:35.560
Well, I actually finally cracked on the Chromebook thing, an ordered one over the weekend.

06:35.560 --> 06:37.000
Hopefully it'll be here within a day or two.

06:37.000 --> 06:38.360
It is an old one.

06:38.360 --> 06:39.360
It's used.

06:39.360 --> 06:40.360
It's an Acer Chromebook R11.

06:40.360 --> 06:41.360
It's got a touchscreen.

06:41.360 --> 06:44.840
It's one of those convertible things.

06:44.840 --> 06:48.440
It's going to be supported until June of 2022.

06:48.440 --> 06:51.080
So I'll have two and a half years with it, hopefully.

06:51.080 --> 06:53.960
And I'm led to believe it supports Android apps and Linux apps.

06:53.960 --> 06:56.640
So it'll be good fun to play with it.

06:56.640 --> 06:59.520
Have you seen if there's a firmware update available for you?

06:59.520 --> 07:04.420
Well, I haven't got it yet, but I don't suppose it's going to be supported by this.

07:04.420 --> 07:07.400
It looks like it's only going to be new ones, but you never know.

07:07.400 --> 07:08.400
Fingers crossed.

07:08.400 --> 07:10.800
Yeah, I mean, a lot of Acer systems are supported.

07:10.800 --> 07:15.200
So maybe it's not a big deal for them to add support for older Chromebooks, probably not

07:15.200 --> 07:16.200
likely though.

07:16.200 --> 07:17.200
Yeah.

07:17.200 --> 07:20.680
But I've been very keen to try it for a while, and I just thought, right, I'm going to have

07:20.680 --> 07:21.680
to do it.

07:21.680 --> 07:22.680
I got it pretty cheap.

07:22.680 --> 07:24.880
So yeah, I'll be talking about that, hopefully, in the future.

07:24.880 --> 07:29.320
Well, when you do get that, and you get around to putting Debian on there, you may have your

07:29.320 --> 07:32.380
choice of init systems all over again.

07:32.380 --> 07:34.120
It's like it's 2014 again, Joe.

07:34.120 --> 07:35.680
Yeah, I don't understand this.

07:35.680 --> 07:37.720
I've been following it for the last few weeks.

07:37.720 --> 07:41.080
And it's a resurgence of the system D and Debian debate.

07:41.080 --> 07:44.960
I thought that was all settled, but apparently not.

07:44.960 --> 07:47.800
It's a culture war essentially, Joe, inside the project.

07:47.800 --> 07:53.720
So this all really changed back in 2014 when Debian switched to using system D as the default

07:53.720 --> 07:55.180
init system.

07:55.180 --> 07:59.560
The intent was that other init systems would be supported, but system D would be the default

07:59.560 --> 08:01.160
for Debian.

08:01.160 --> 08:06.600
Since then, technically that support has continued, but not very functionally.

08:06.600 --> 08:13.440
And during the last release cycle, some tensions exploded, and bugs have been turned into fights

08:13.440 --> 08:14.440
as a result of this.

08:14.440 --> 08:16.840
The project isn't moving forward.

08:16.840 --> 08:21.020
And so it's time for another general resolution to try to resolve this.

08:21.020 --> 08:25.680
But from what I can read, Joe, even how this general resolution has been gone about is

08:25.680 --> 08:27.520
sort of up for debate.

08:27.520 --> 08:33.420
Well, yeah, initially, Sam Hartman, the Debian project lead, made three proposals, which

08:33.420 --> 08:39.760
is quite unusual, proposal A, B, and C. But then Ian Jackson came in with a slightly more

08:39.760 --> 08:41.920
nuanced proposal.

08:41.920 --> 08:45.520
But then there was even a fifth proposal by Dmitry Bogatov.

08:45.520 --> 08:51.480
And it feels to me that Sam Hartman was trying to push things towards system D has won.

08:51.480 --> 08:57.280
And although it's kind of nice if we can support the other init systems, system D is progressing

08:57.280 --> 09:02.200
at quite a pace, adding features, and the other init systems are just going to be left

09:02.200 --> 09:03.200
behind.

09:03.200 --> 09:05.240
So just kind of deal with it.

09:05.240 --> 09:06.240
Right.

09:06.240 --> 09:09.840
And that's in contrast with another philosophy that, and tell me if you think I'm wrong,

09:09.840 --> 09:15.480
that I see as Debian should be a platform for everyone for any contribution, no matter

09:15.480 --> 09:17.120
how small.

09:17.120 --> 09:23.640
And secondly, it's incredibly harder for projects to rip out the init system upstream.

09:23.640 --> 09:27.520
So if Debian goes with system D, it's kind of a foregone conclusion that projects like

09:27.520 --> 09:29.240
Ubuntu get affected by that.

09:29.240 --> 09:35.280
Where if they remain a universal platform of sorts, then the distributions build off

09:35.280 --> 09:38.120
of Debian can mix and match how they like.

09:38.120 --> 09:42.120
And it allows for just about anyone to participate.

09:42.120 --> 09:46.240
But there's no structure and process in place to determine what to do when something is

09:46.240 --> 09:50.100
blocking a release or when somebody isn't maintaining something like all of this has

09:50.100 --> 09:55.280
to be politically formalized more than just what the bug trackers process is, but it has

09:55.280 --> 09:57.520
to be something that's politically formalized.

09:57.520 --> 09:59.160
And I don't think there's the will right now.

09:59.160 --> 10:03.000
So I do think I agree with you that there's Sam's approach and then there's a more philosophical

10:03.000 --> 10:05.440
approach that are essentially at conflict here.

10:05.440 --> 10:08.400
And I honestly thought this was resolved when the Dev1 split happened.

10:08.400 --> 10:09.400
Well, so did I.

10:09.400 --> 10:16.120
I thought Debian was going all in on system D and leaving the init diversity and freedom

10:16.120 --> 10:17.120
to Dev1.

10:17.120 --> 10:22.760
But I think the problem here is that Debian has tried to be all things to all people,

10:22.760 --> 10:24.860
the universal operating system.

10:24.860 --> 10:32.080
What people were concerned about back in 2014 was that system D was going to take over and

10:32.080 --> 10:35.840
it pretty much has because if you look at the features of system D, there aren't really

10:35.840 --> 10:37.600
parallels with the other init systems.

10:37.600 --> 10:44.520
So you're inevitably going to have incompatibility and you're going to have to make that decision

10:44.520 --> 10:51.160
at some point to just cut the others loose and somewhat support them, but just concentrate

10:51.160 --> 10:52.160
on system D.

10:52.160 --> 10:57.960
I just don't really see the argument against it really because you're going to either have

10:57.960 --> 11:04.920
to use system D and not all of its features and fully support the other init systems

11:04.920 --> 11:08.120
or you just have to let them fall by the wayside.

11:08.120 --> 11:13.680
And we have Dev1 for the other init systems, so why not just go all in on system D?

11:13.680 --> 11:16.560
It seemed like that was the case initially with that split.

11:16.560 --> 11:21.820
However, reading into this for this story, I really got down into the weeds.

11:21.820 --> 11:25.400
And this is going to the core of the project.

11:25.400 --> 11:32.480
There is at the core of this thing, a health problem with the project and how they discourse

11:32.480 --> 11:37.600
in weaponizing bugs and in their core philosophy, they can't agree.

11:37.600 --> 11:43.540
There are fundamental issues over at Debian and that's what the story is showing us.

11:43.540 --> 11:47.680
And the more I read into it, the more I can kind of see both perspectives.

11:47.680 --> 11:52.480
There is a place for a great universal operating system that has a bunch of great init systems

11:52.480 --> 11:56.840
because if you look at them as all great open source projects that offer something unique

11:56.840 --> 12:00.400
and compelling for different use cases, then it makes a little more sense.

12:00.400 --> 12:05.720
Say a really low powered IoT device, wouldn't it be great if Debian could be a perfect base

12:05.720 --> 12:08.400
of an operating system for IoT devices?

12:08.400 --> 12:11.880
But perhaps default Debian might be getting too heavy.

12:11.880 --> 12:16.760
There's a lot of situations where for containers, it's nice to have a very simple system in

12:16.760 --> 12:17.760
a container.

12:17.760 --> 12:19.860
Yeah, but isn't that what things like Alpine are for?

12:19.860 --> 12:24.000
Can you really be a universal operating system in 2019, 2020 and beyond?

12:24.000 --> 12:28.200
I think for a certain demo, the people that are really fighting for this thing, they feel

12:28.200 --> 12:33.560
like they've been looked over by the system D has one crowd and that they just get dismissed.

12:33.560 --> 12:36.660
So all that said, I can totally understand your perspective because that was essentially

12:36.660 --> 12:39.960
mine until I really dug into this.

12:39.960 --> 12:43.040
And now I sort of see both sides and I don't know which way they're going to go.

12:43.040 --> 12:46.560
But I think it's going to fundamentally define the future of the project.

12:46.560 --> 12:49.680
I look at this as architectures.

12:49.680 --> 12:53.640
Every really good architecture has a use case for Debian that can be defended and justifies

12:53.640 --> 12:55.340
its development time and resources.

12:55.340 --> 12:58.920
And when an architecture doesn't, after a while, they tend to let it go.

12:58.920 --> 13:04.800
I wonder if that kind of methodology and approach couldn't be applied to init systems.

13:04.800 --> 13:09.120
But perhaps because of the political situation, that is much easier said than done.

13:09.120 --> 13:12.920
Well, there's going to be a lot of discussion in the project and they may come to a conclusion

13:12.920 --> 13:17.520
with this, but I've got a feeling it might rumble on for another five years.

13:17.520 --> 13:20.520
Well, here's something we'd only see in 2019.

13:20.520 --> 13:27.280
IBM and Microsoft are working together via the Linux Foundation to fight patent trolls.

13:27.280 --> 13:28.280
How about that?

13:28.280 --> 13:32.640
Yeah, I didn't see this one coming, but it kind of makes sense in retrospect.

13:32.640 --> 13:37.040
You've got a coming together here of a lot of powerful entities within the Linux and

13:37.040 --> 13:41.120
open source world, including Microsoft, which we just have to accept these days that they're

13:41.120 --> 13:42.640
one of them.

13:42.640 --> 13:47.020
And hopefully this means we're going to see an end to these patent trolls attacking open

13:47.020 --> 13:48.380
source software.

13:48.380 --> 13:49.380
I see it that way.

13:49.380 --> 13:55.440
These names with this annual subscription and the overall open innovation networks,

13:55.440 --> 14:00.680
huge patent portfolio to begin with, essentially are sending the message that for a large portion

14:00.680 --> 14:04.200
of IP that cover Linux, we're closed for business now.

14:04.200 --> 14:05.840
The patent troll stuff isn't going to work.

14:05.840 --> 14:10.640
It doesn't mean everybody's safe, like Shotwell, for example, but it does mean a lot of the

14:10.640 --> 14:13.780
infrastructure that businesses built on is safe.

14:13.780 --> 14:18.400
And that matters because people that are building products on free software and open source

14:18.400 --> 14:22.720
technology, they want to know that they're safe, they can operate, they can sell, and

14:22.720 --> 14:25.280
they're not going to get sued once their product hits the market.

14:25.280 --> 14:29.120
Well, yeah, and that probably explains why Microsoft and IBM are working together on

14:29.120 --> 14:30.120
this.

14:30.120 --> 14:31.120
They have a common goal here.

14:31.120 --> 14:32.120
Yeah, it does make sense.

14:32.120 --> 14:34.480
It's just so weird for me.

14:34.480 --> 14:41.520
I live in Microsoft's backyard and the early days of Microsoft were defined by betrayal

14:41.520 --> 14:42.520
from IBM.

14:42.520 --> 14:48.400
And so friends and family members that worked for Microsoft had a real hatred for IBM.

14:48.400 --> 14:50.140
So it's just weird.

14:50.140 --> 14:55.320
It's really weird, but that's been the sub headline to all these Microsoft and IBM stories

14:55.320 --> 14:57.840
for the last two to five years now.

14:57.840 --> 15:02.020
And so that weird is just going to become the new normal.

15:02.020 --> 15:03.760
It really has started to become the new normal.

15:03.760 --> 15:07.240
Well, supply chain attacks seem to have become the new normal.

15:07.240 --> 15:11.600
And I always like to end on a cryptocurrency story, so I couldn't resist this one.

15:11.600 --> 15:15.480
The official Monero website was hacked this week, and some of the binaries were replaced

15:15.480 --> 15:17.640
with currency stealing malware.

15:17.640 --> 15:21.360
Why bother trying to mine it when you can just steal it?

15:21.360 --> 15:24.880
It's the worst when it's a wallet that's stealing your money.

15:24.880 --> 15:25.880
That's really something.

15:25.880 --> 15:26.880
Oh, man.

15:26.880 --> 15:29.580
And it's so embarrassing when it's the binaries.

15:29.580 --> 15:35.720
If not just like some text on the website, but the actual binaries for Windows and Linux

15:35.720 --> 15:36.720
were replaced.

15:36.720 --> 15:43.160
So if you downloaded any Monero wallet software on Monday the 18th of November 2019, between

15:43.160 --> 15:52.160
2.30 a.m. UTC and 4.30 p.m. UTC, you definitely need to check the hashes of your binaries.

15:52.160 --> 15:53.720
I'm sorry to report.

15:53.720 --> 15:56.160
This is a really bad look for the project.

15:56.160 --> 16:00.680
If you're serving up downloads of binaries of wallet software, you need to make sure

16:00.680 --> 16:06.040
that it's secure and that people are not having their currency stolen.

16:06.040 --> 16:08.600
No kidding.

16:08.600 --> 16:17.560
As we record, just a note, the current price for Monero is $48.91 in U.S. greenbacks.

16:17.560 --> 16:21.640
So they did it all for 50 bucks.

16:21.640 --> 16:24.960
I wonder how many coins they got.

16:24.960 --> 16:29.440
I guess maybe somebody could actually check because it'd have to be a blockchain event,

16:29.440 --> 16:30.440
right?

16:30.440 --> 16:31.440
Yeah.

16:31.440 --> 16:36.560
Well, they've got to be worth more than the Dogecoin that I've still got.

16:36.560 --> 16:38.200
It's definitely profitable if you don't mind it.

16:38.200 --> 16:42.400
If you just steal it, I hear that cryptocurrency is much more profitable.

16:42.400 --> 16:46.400
Oh, dear.

16:46.400 --> 16:49.920
You know, we're getting dangerously close to the end of the year when we'll have to

16:49.920 --> 16:51.760
talk about the Bitcoin price again.

16:51.760 --> 16:52.760
I know.

16:52.760 --> 16:56.720
And for a short period of time, it looked like it was going to possibly pop 10,000.

16:56.720 --> 16:59.160
But again, as we record today, it's also not doing so well.

16:59.160 --> 17:00.160
It's down to $7,000.

17:00.160 --> 17:01.160
Not that I'm watching.

17:01.160 --> 17:02.160
I'm not watching, though.

17:02.160 --> 17:03.160
Of course not.

17:03.160 --> 17:08.400
I kind of wanted to see Monero be successful and now that it hasn't failed, I shouldn't

17:08.400 --> 17:09.400
say it like that.

17:09.400 --> 17:14.400
But the thing I liked about Monero is that it was a privacy-focused currency that I don't

17:14.400 --> 17:20.200
know, I see a need for that, especially for political dissidents and journalists and countries.

17:20.200 --> 17:25.080
Like, imagine trying to be a journalist exposing government deeds in China right now.

17:25.080 --> 17:28.800
Like, what are you using to buy your goods and pay people that are helping you?

17:28.800 --> 17:31.680
You know, there's a need for these kinds of things.

17:31.680 --> 17:35.000
Maybe in the West, people might have cushy lives and, you know, a nice stable government

17:35.000 --> 17:36.800
currency and they don't need to worry about this.

17:36.800 --> 17:41.060
But there are absolutely individuals in the world that need something like this.

17:41.060 --> 17:45.680
And then I just totally geek out on the idea of an open source currency that's backed by

17:45.680 --> 17:46.680
math.

17:46.680 --> 17:50.200
That's so much cooler than paper money that we just assign value to, just from like a

17:50.200 --> 17:51.200
geeky perspective.

17:51.200 --> 17:55.200
So Monero was one of the ones I was kind of secretly saying, come on, come on, go for

17:55.200 --> 17:56.440
it.

17:56.440 --> 18:00.320
But not a lot of trading volume compared to where I thought it would be by now.

18:00.320 --> 18:03.600
And just sort of one bad story after another, Joe.

18:03.600 --> 18:07.240
Well, bad news in the cryptocurrency world is always good news for me because it gets

18:07.240 --> 18:13.120
me closer to that $2,000 Bitcoin value on December 1st that I predicted.

18:13.120 --> 18:15.520
Damn it, Joe.

18:15.520 --> 18:21.320
It's not worth taking down the whole currency, Joe, not for a damn prediction.

18:21.320 --> 18:22.560
You stupid predictions.
