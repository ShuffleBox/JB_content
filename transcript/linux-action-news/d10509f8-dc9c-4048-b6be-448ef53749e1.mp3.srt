00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,960
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, episode 125, recorded on September 29th, 2019.

2
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:09,960
I'm Chris.

3
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:10,960
And I'm Joe.

4
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:11,960
Hello, Joe.

5
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:12,960
Good to be connected with you.

6
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:17,240
And we kick the show off this week with some big news from the CentOS project.

7
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:21,680
Yes, CentOS 8 has been released exactly as we thought it would be this week.

8
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:25,960
But also CentOS Stream has been released, something we weren't expecting.

9
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:30,440
Looking back at the reports of a delay, you wonder if maybe this was part of the eight

10
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:32,000
release delay.

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:39,400
CentOS Stream will or now is a rolling release distro that exists as midstream between the

12
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:45,300
upstream development in Fedora Linux and downstream development in Red Hat Enterprise Linux.

13
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:48,460
So it's kind of in between the two, which is a perfect spot.

14
00:00:48,460 --> 00:00:52,480
There was kind of a hole here before things would happen in Fedora, it would get in good

15
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:57,920
shape, then the Red Hat Enterprise team would come in, they'd grab that, and they'd start

16
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:58,920
working on that.

17
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:01,420
And then they'd eventually release a Red Hat Enterprise Linux based on that.

18
00:01:01,420 --> 00:01:04,840
But there was really no between, nothing back and forth.

19
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:07,400
This sits right in that middle spot now.

20
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:11,080
It's not an upstream, it's not a downstream, it's a midstream distro.

21
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:15,520
This is going to be a really useful distro for developers who are targeting RHEL, because

22
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:19,640
the updates that you're going to get in CentOS Stream reflect the updates that you're going

23
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:22,440
to get in the minor release versions of RHEL.

24
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:28,120
So what you get now in CentOS Stream will eventually become Red Hat Enterprise Linux

25
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:29,840
8.1.

26
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:31,480
That's kind of how this works.

27
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:36,840
I like that, because Fedora moves really fast, and I love it on my desktop, but it moves

28
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:40,800
a little too fast for me to use it properly on a server.

29
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:43,760
And RHEL, well that moves a little too slow.

30
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:48,840
And so CentOS sits right there in the middle, where it could sort of be that perfect amount

31
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:53,320
of movement, where things stay fresh, you get nice new packages, you kind of see where

32
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:58,200
RHEL's going, but it's not limited to nine months-ish of support.

33
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:00,360
You get many years of support.

34
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:04,520
That sounds ideal to me, and I've always kind of been a fan of the semi-rolling or fully

35
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:09,400
rolling model, and this just brings it in a sort of consumable way to the server.

36
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:13,240
Of course you will still have regular CentOS 8 and the various updates to that, which I

37
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:18,920
think will probably be more popular on servers, because a rolling release...

38
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:21,720
Yeah, it's good for Chris, but it's not necessarily good for everybody.

39
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:26,720
Yeah, I think if you're running it on one server that's not critical, then maybe it'd

40
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:27,720
be good, but...

41
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:30,880
Well, I mean, you're mad enough to use Fedora on a server, so what does that tell you?

42
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:31,880
That's right, man.

43
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:36,440
Hey, back in the bad old days, I was using Gentoo, so don't listen to me at all on this

44
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:37,440
topic.

45
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:42,040
But I think it's pretty neat too, because from not just a developer's perspective on

46
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:47,080
what's coming to RHEL, but also from a contribute back to one of the more significant Linux

47
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:52,320
distributions directly, by contributing back to CentOS Stream, those fixes and patches

48
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:56,600
will make it into RHEL in a more direct way than it does currently with Fedora.

49
00:02:56,600 --> 00:03:01,120
Some stuff from Fedora makes it, but not everything, and that's fascinating.

50
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:04,280
Didn't see this one coming, and now I'm just left with a few questions.

51
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:09,600
How will the CentOS project handle maintaining both the traditional CentOS and the Stream

52
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:10,600
version?

53
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:13,200
Will it fit right into their workflow, or perhaps it's a burden?

54
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,080
We'll just kind of have to wait and see.

55
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:19,860
And then additionally, I think another question we have is, what as an end user should I expect

56
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:23,680
in terms of package update frequency?

57
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:28,640
Every day I'm going to have 30 packages, or about 30 packages a month?

58
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:32,680
And those are just questions we won't know until we try it some more, which we both did

59
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:33,680
for the show here.

60
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:38,760
Yeah, I tried both versions, CentOS 8 and CentOS 8 Stream, and I went for the workstation

61
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:41,680
installation, and it was a bit rough to be honest.

62
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:42,680
Both of them were.

63
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:46,640
I think CentOS 8 was less rough, but there was a clear difference between them.

64
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:51,480
Just simple things like going to GNOME software, I got errors straight away, which was weird,

65
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:55,360
like about some extensions that were 404-ing or something.

66
00:03:55,360 --> 00:04:00,840
And in Stream, there was no GIMP, which was a bit weird, but then there was in the regular

67
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:01,840
CentOS.

68
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:06,880
I didn't spend a great deal of time with it, but CentOS is not really a desktop distro

69
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:11,520
is it, and that was made pretty clear to me when I tried it out.

70
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:12,760
Yeah, I suppose not.

71
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:18,840
Although you'll wonder if Stream could end up making a decent base for a workstation,

72
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:20,820
much like Ubuntu LTS does.

73
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:24,160
So it's worth checking out, but no, I tried it out on the server myself.

74
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:29,560
I wanted to see what it was like to try to go from 7 to 8, which I haven't figured out

75
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:31,000
yet, I have to be honest.

76
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,480
But I'm not very familiar, this is the only CentOS box I have, so I just haven't done

77
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:35,480
it before.

78
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:37,040
This is my first one.

79
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:42,440
And then I tried it out on Lin-Note as well, which has a one-click deployment image already

80
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:43,480
of it.

81
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:47,400
Once you get it set up, if you've used Fedora in the last few releases, you're right at

82
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:48,400
home.

83
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:51,360
You've got DNF by default installed, ready to go now.

84
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:55,360
Even the desktop graphic stack is more in line with what you get in Fedora, Wayland

85
00:04:55,360 --> 00:05:01,080
is available, and it comes with cockpit pre-installed, they refer to it more as like a, I think they

86
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:03,440
just call it the web interface, but it's cockpit.

87
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:09,960
And so you get a great web UI that is safe and pretty capable to manage the box if you'd

88
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:10,960
like.

89
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:15,360
And this is the first version of CentOS that ships with Podman, which replaces Docker,

90
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,280
and of course Docker is available as well.

91
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:21,280
I think it's the best release of RHEL ever, and so by that extension it's the best release

92
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:22,640
of CentOS ever.

93
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:28,240
I've never in my life been hyped about a CentOS release or a RHEL release, but I just think

94
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:34,520
as we round out 2019, we're in a position where we have really good long-term support

95
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:35,520
distributions.

96
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:39,560
Ubuntu LTS 1804 is in a really good spot right now.

97
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:45,080
It's gone through some release cycles, it is really solid on my production systems,

98
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:51,180
and CentOS 8 looks like it's a great release, and it's also supported for many years.

99
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:53,200
We have a spoil of choices right now, Joe.

100
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:57,360
Yeah, just when we get to the point where the underlying OS doesn't really matter anymore,

101
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,360
we spoil for choice.

102
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:01,220
That is a bit ironic.

103
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:07,020
One last note, we'll have a link in the show notes over to a post by Matthew Miller about

104
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:11,240
where Fedora and CentOS fit together, and he paints a pretty good picture.

105
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:15,160
He said, sometime after the previous RHEL release, Red Hat would then suddenly turn

106
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:17,280
more attention to Fedora than usual.

107
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:22,160
A few months later, Red Hat would split off a new RHEL version developed internally.

108
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:25,020
And then after some months, that'd be put into the world, including all of the source

109
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:27,560
from which then CentOS is built.

110
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:31,920
That source drop would continue for updates, and sometimes those would include patches

111
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:36,880
that were in Fedora, but there was never any real visible connection, and each step had

112
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:37,880
problems.

113
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:44,000
Intermittent attention, closed-door development, blind code drops, not quite enough ongoing

114
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,600
transparency, but now with this shift, it's really opening all of that up.

115
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:54,680
Fedora is the top upstream, it flows through CentOS stream, which makes it into RHEL, which

116
00:06:54,680 --> 00:07:00,720
opens up a whole layer of visibility we never saw before, and really, I think, safely positions

117
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:05,840
each project logically, where you could see they would stick around and survive in the

118
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:08,840
future IBM structure, IBM Red Hat structure.

119
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:11,680
There's a clear value position for each of those.

120
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,080
Yeah, I think that's true.

121
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:18,520
And it makes me wonder, are we going to see Fedora taking more risks and trying more new

122
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:21,880
stuff and kind of going out on a limb a little bit more?

123
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:24,080
Because you've got that CentOS buffer now.

124
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:25,080
Exactly.

125
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:27,360
So I think this could potentially be very good news.

126
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:31,680
Not so good news, though, for Docker, ironically, since a lot of the workloads these systems

127
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:34,440
are doing now involves containers.

128
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:38,860
Once valued at over a billion dollars, Docker has now told their employees they're having

129
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:40,360
significant challenges.

130
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:45,800
Yeah, an internal email has leaked from the CEO Rob Bearden, which says that they're looking

131
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:50,800
to get some more funding and kind of hold tight while we do it.

132
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:55,400
It does not paint a very good picture at all of how Docker is doing financially.

133
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:58,320
But is this a real surprise?

134
00:07:58,320 --> 00:07:59,560
Not really, is it?

135
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:05,560
Because Docker, although the technology is amazing and used by tons of people across

136
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:09,080
the industry, they don't really have that much of a business model.

137
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:13,520
Yeah, the company attempts to sell a range of products to help businesses manage their

138
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:15,680
deployments of multiple containers.

139
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:20,080
But the revenue hasn't really taken off in a way that matches the funding and the requirements.

140
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:24,040
It appears, according to these emails, which will have a story linked in the show notes,

141
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:29,680
that this has been an ongoing internal discussion about their struggle.

142
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:35,160
And he writes, quote, thank you for persevering in spite of the lack of clarity we've had

143
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:36,960
these past few weeks.

144
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:40,360
That doesn't sound like a very pleasant environment to work in.

145
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:42,800
And here's something else to consider.

146
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:50,640
Martin joined in May, he became the fourth CEO, and just their third since 2017.

147
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:54,400
They're really trying to get some traction here and they're struggling.

148
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:58,940
They have around 500 employees on the books, they're based out of San Francisco, and they've

149
00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:03,080
raised more than $200 million in funding.

150
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:04,440
And they're looking at going another round.

151
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:09,740
But it's a really tricky thing because their core product is baked into the operating system.

152
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:16,800
And like I just talked about, RHEL 8 is shipping Podman, which allows you to manage containers,

153
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:21,760
some would argue in a more secure way, that doesn't involve Docker.

154
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:27,660
And Canonical uses LexD, there's SystemD containers, there's several competing technologies that

155
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:33,360
are baked into platforms that then have their own management tools on top of them.

156
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:38,640
Or there's things like Kubernetes, which truly essentially make Docker just an implementation

157
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:39,640
detail.

158
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:43,880
I hope that they can sort themselves out because it would be a shame for them to go bust and

159
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:44,880
go away.

160
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,920
But somehow I'm not hopeful.

161
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,480
I completely agree.

162
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:52,180
It seems like there should be something there and they've done some good in this space.

163
00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:55,280
They deserve to find a way to make a living.

164
00:09:55,280 --> 00:10:00,080
I hope the Gnome Foundation gets some good news because they're currently facing a lawsuit

165
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:03,720
from the Rothschild Patent Imaging LLC.

166
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:08,120
There's a brief post about this on Gnome.org, where they quote Neil McGovern, the executive

167
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:12,880
director of the Gnome Foundation, and he says, we've retained legal counsel and intend to

168
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:15,720
vigorously defend against this baseless suit.

169
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:20,880
But he also says, due to ongoing litigation, we unfortunately cannot make any further comments

170
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:23,700
at this time, which is understandable, really.

171
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:26,960
But this is just a straight up patent troll going after Shotwell.

172
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:29,160
Yeah, and you are right, it is a patent troll.

173
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:30,360
It's literally what they do.

174
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:37,640
In fact, back in 2017, they sued a barbecue restaurant, as well as 15 other small franchises

175
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:41,400
and restaurants and family owned businesses for using QR codes.

176
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:47,040
And the real icing on the cake, of course, is the patent troll has enjoyed doing their

177
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:53,200
work out of the Eastern District of Texas, where that federal court has been a hotspot

178
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:57,800
for these types of patent suits and generally been one the patent trolls prefer to go to.

179
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:03,320
It's classic patent troll material, stuff that we used to be commonly seen years ago.

180
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:04,720
They're playing one of the greatest hits.

181
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:08,840
Yeah, and once again, this highlights the absurdity of software patents in the first

182
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:09,840
place.

183
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:10,840
Yeah.

184
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:14,240
And in this case, it seems to come down to how Shotwell can intelligently transfer images

185
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:18,580
over Wi Fi, at least according to the initial research I did into this patent complaint.

186
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:22,440
It's not something particularly unique to Shotwell.

187
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:24,580
But they're willing, again, to go after barbecue restaurants.

188
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:27,500
So they're gonna go after the Dome Foundation.

189
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:31,360
By the way, we'll have a link in the show notes if you would like to donate to Dome.

190
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:35,960
They offer things from PayPal, bank transfer, a check or even Bitcoin, any amount would

191
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:36,960
probably help right now.

192
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:40,520
We'll have that link at linuxactionnews.com slash one to five.

193
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:43,520
Yeah, sounds like that's going to be very expensive for them.

194
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:48,660
But something that's not expensive are Android Go edition phones, right?

195
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:55,560
And now we have Android 10, Go edition, which says it's faster and includes that new encryption

196
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:59,580
that we talked about before, AdMantium, I think it was called or AdMantium.

197
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:04,460
And as well as a couple other like design for mobility apps, I'm gonna say I'm a little

198
00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:07,240
jealous Joe, I wish I could find a phone that had Android Go on it.

199
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:10,920
Adiantium, by the way, shocker that you can't pronounce something.

200
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:14,160
Yeah, I'm not the official pronunciation guy.

201
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:15,160
That's not me.

202
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:19,480
Well, there are some Android Go edition phones available in the US, but this is very much

203
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:24,840
aimed at developing markets, phones with a gigabyte and a half of memory or less.

204
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:28,980
And I think realistically, if you got hold of one of these, you'd be wanting your pixel

205
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:30,360
back pretty quickly.

206
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:34,200
Yeah, I just I'm in love with the idea.

207
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:37,240
In some places, you can get a phone for as low as $27.

208
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:41,960
It might only have 3g and no storage, but $27 phone prices.

209
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:45,240
I feel like I'll never see those again in my life, at least for anything that I'd want

210
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:46,240
to use.

211
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:52,440
But I did grab their photo go gallery app that they've made available for Android Go.

212
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:56,440
They don't seem to make the YouTube Go app available, which is a bummer because I think

213
00:12:56,440 --> 00:13:00,080
it supports like downloading and lower bit rate videos, which would be great when I'm

214
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:01,560
on a MiFi.

215
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:05,140
But their photo app that they make available for Android Go is nice.

216
00:13:05,140 --> 00:13:07,920
It's much lighter than Google Photos.

217
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:11,860
When you get an official Android device with a real Google ROM, I know you're not familiar

218
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:16,620
with these, Joe, but when you get one, they got this app on there called Google Photos.

219
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:19,400
And of course, it's their upload photo analysis.

220
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:20,560
Get all your information service.

221
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:22,100
It's pretty good.

222
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:24,040
And it's pretty creepy.

223
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:27,600
But it's slow sometimes, especially when you have a bad connection and you just want to

224
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,360
view some pictures you took.

225
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:32,480
And this this app that they include here is really good.

226
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:34,360
You can just get it on the Play Store.

227
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:36,760
So I had a big recommendation on that one.

228
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:40,500
Well, YouTube wise, my recommendation for that is new pipe, which is available from

229
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:41,500
F-Droid.

230
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:43,760
We talked about it on Choose Linux a couple of months ago.

231
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:44,760
Yeah, that's right.

232
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:45,760
You should definitely check that out.

233
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:50,320
That's got the different bit rates or resolutions at least and supports downloading and all

234
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:53,200
sorts and yeah, completely free software as well.

235
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:57,220
It's called Gallery Go and I'll try to put a link to that in the show notes to the Play

236
00:13:57,220 --> 00:13:58,220
Store if I can.

237
00:13:58,220 --> 00:14:01,240
If they'll let me, they'll probably let me at least link to the US version.

238
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:05,400
But this release has come pretty soon after the regular Android 10 release.

239
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:09,360
So it shows that they are still very serious about this, which isn't a huge surprise given

240
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:12,080
that they do want to get into these developing markets.

241
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:13,480
It is pretty quick after the release.

242
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:14,480
You're right.

243
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:16,920
That's a fair observation there.

244
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:23,140
Also, speaking of observations, a developer, quote, a recognized developer as XDA developers.com

245
00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:33,520
writes it, has found a new commit merged into AOSP titled, quote, mount multiple DSU partitions

246
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:40,680
when present, end quote, which looking at the code and the name of it seems to offer

247
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:47,200
the ability to try out an OEM update before you commit to it.

248
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:50,840
You can try it and revert back if you don't like it.

249
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:52,400
Why do you suppose they would offer this, Joe?

250
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:54,920
It doesn't seem like this solves the issue.

251
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:59,600
The issue is people aren't updating and upgrading often enough or can't, not that they want

252
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:00,600
to revert back.

253
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:02,160
But maybe I'm wrong.

254
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:08,240
Well, anecdotally, I've seen people who are on older versions and have updates available,

255
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:11,320
but don't want to do it because they're worried it's going to break something.

256
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:14,920
So maybe it's aimed at those kind of people.

257
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:19,640
I mean, I always just do all the updates that I possibly can because they're generally going

258
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:21,880
to be security updates as well as feature updates.

259
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:27,720
But some people I've seen on iOS specifically, people just not wanting to do those updates

260
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:32,360
because what if it breaks X, Y and Z and people don't like change.

261
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:35,840
So giving them the option to see, okay, it's fine.

262
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:39,160
Everything works and then commit to it afterwards.

263
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:40,160
Seems pretty logical.

264
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:41,160
Yeah, perhaps.

265
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:46,140
It would be a really nice feature just in, you know, just in case you didn't like some

266
00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:52,060
new thing, the carrier added or the OEM added, seems really nice.

267
00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:58,980
Not so sure about Microsoft Edge on Linux, though, that I guess I would give it a go.

268
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:01,080
But there's rumors afloat, Joe.

269
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:05,600
Yeah, this week, Sean Larkin, who is the technical program manager for various things at Microsoft

270
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:10,800
including Edge, tweeted, we on the Microsoft Edge team are fleshing out requirements to

271
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:14,420
bring Edge to Linux, and we need your help with some assumptions.

272
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:18,240
And then links to a form, which is obviously not a Google form, but looks exactly like

273
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:22,160
a Google form from Microsoft Office.

274
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:24,560
And they're asking developers to fill in the survey for them.

275
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:27,280
So it looks like this might actually be happening then.

276
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:33,160
Yeah, they're curious about the, quote, scenarios you primarily use a web browser on Linux for.

277
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:37,320
Some of the options are automated testing, web development, or personal browsing.

278
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:38,800
They're curious about distributions.

279
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:43,680
They offer Ubuntu, Debian, OpenSUSE, Red Hat, Fedora, and other.

280
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:47,280
Just trying to get an idea of maybe who their target audience would be.

281
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:49,160
And I'd say, why not give them some help?

282
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:53,680
We'll have a link to the tweet and which then links to the form if you'd like to give them

283
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:55,600
your take on it.

284
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:58,600
It's always good to have more software on Linux.

285
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:02,400
And it would be a heck of a story, and really something to watch how they pull it off, like

286
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:03,680
how do they deliver it?

287
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:04,680
Do they snap it?

288
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:08,120
Do they make it available as a PPA?

289
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:13,280
How does Microsoft ship a browser on Linux in, say, early 2020?

290
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:16,960
Yeah, I'll try it out, not on my main machine, obviously.

291
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:18,480
Yeah, I'd give it a go to.

292
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:24,560
I would, because honestly, I probably at this point in time have more trust in my web browsing

293
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:26,720
data with Microsoft than I do Google.

294
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:27,720
Sorry, Googs.

295
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:31,760
I know that you probably don't want to hear that, but it's just where it's at right now.

296
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:34,200
That's why every day Chris is using Firefox.

297
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:35,480
Every day I'm using Firefox now.

298
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:36,960
I still got Chrome installed.

299
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,360
I'm all about Firefox.

300
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:42,120
Also, side note, it's butter smooth on Wayland.

301
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:47,720
Well something not so smooth this week is more rumblings in this Richard Storman saga.

302
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:54,120
This week he sent an email to the InfoGNU mailing list saying, on September 16, I resigned

303
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:58,360
as president of the Free Software Foundation, but the GNU project and the FSF are not the

304
00:17:58,360 --> 00:17:59,360
same.

305
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:06,000
I'm still the head of the GNU project, in brackets, the chief GNU-sense, and I intend

306
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,200
to continue as such.

307
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:09,920
He's such a funny guy, isn't he?

308
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:16,560
But then, later on in the week, a post appeared in his political notes, which is kind of his

309
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:17,560
blog.

310
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:22,520
He probably wouldn't like it being called that, but it is, saying that he was resigning

311
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:23,520
effective immediately.

312
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:29,480
Yeah, the quote, I hereby step down as head of the GNU project, effective immediately.

313
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:30,480
That's it.

314
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:31,480
Short and sweet on his site.

315
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:36,520
Yeah, there were actually a couple of these that appeared and then subsequently disappeared.

316
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:40,640
And now the whole political notes section of his site is 404ing.

317
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:44,920
Which was loading when we started recording this podcast, which is interesting, Joe.

318
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:47,200
It's gone down since we started recording.

319
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:52,800
It's all very, very strange, except if you look at the 404 message and realize that he's

320
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:56,840
running Apache 2.2.22 on Debian.

321
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:57,840
Right.

322
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:00,200
That's an old version of Apache, Joe.

323
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:03,680
There's several CVEs that don't look so good that are open for that one.

324
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:08,560
Additionally, if you were to connect to his SSH server and read the banner, it appears

325
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:14,800
to be a version from Debian Wheezy, which generously got its last security patches in

326
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:17,860
May of 2018, and that's being pretty generous.

327
00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:21,560
Perhaps the internet noticed that his server's out of date and is having a poke.

328
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:26,440
That's been weird, though, because if you look at his notes page, his resignation has

329
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:28,440
come and gone several times.

330
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:30,440
I have two tabs open right now.

331
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:33,840
One tab is before we started recording, and his resignation's right on there.

332
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:38,520
I hereby step down as head of the GNU project, comma, effective immediately, period, Richard

333
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:41,200
Stallman, end quote, right there on my page.

334
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:44,840
I open up the other tab that I just clicked on as we started talking about this, and it's

335
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:45,840
gone.

336
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:47,400
I don't know what this means.

337
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:52,760
If you go by what's in the mailing list, the GNU info mailing list, the last post there

338
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:57,480
is Richard Stallman saying he's staying, and there's been no updates to that, no other

339
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:58,480
posts.

340
00:19:58,480 --> 00:19:59,480
So I don't know.

341
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:04,520
It was up on his site, and unless he lost control of his server, it went back several

342
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:05,520
times.

343
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:09,760
There's archive.org examples of this, and then was taken off several times.

344
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:11,440
Perhaps they're finessing the announcement.

345
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:12,440
Who knows?

346
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:15,840
We're going to have to watch this this week, I think.

347
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:19,000
Hopefully we'll get an official announcement on that mailing list, and then we'll know

348
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
for sure.

349
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Well, we'll keep you up to date.

350
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:25,080

And I want to really recommend you check out Self Hosted this week, selfhosted.show slash

354
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:37,400
two.

355
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:42,400
We traveled to see Wendell Wilson from Level One Techs, got to tour his setup, and then

356
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:47,720
sit down and talk about why self host in that episode, and it turned out fantastic, selfhosted.show

357
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:48,720
slash two.

358
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:52,120
Yeah, there's all sorts in there, but what jumped out at me was him talking about his

359
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:55,480
home server, which he was very casual about, oh yeah, it's just this minor thing, but the

360
00:20:55,480 --> 00:21:00,360
storage in that thing alone, you could run a small office from, so he's very serious

361
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:01,360
about this stuff.

362
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:06,240
Yeah, he has a great setup and a super cool trick for presence detection, which really

363
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:07,240
got me thinking.

364
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:11,560
But this here show, we'll be back next Monday with our weekly take on the latest Linux and

365
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:12,720
open source news.

366
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:15,120
I am at Chris LAS.

367
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:16,840
I'm at Joel Rissington.

368
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:19,200
Thanks for joining us, and we'll see you next week.

369
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:42,200
See you later.
