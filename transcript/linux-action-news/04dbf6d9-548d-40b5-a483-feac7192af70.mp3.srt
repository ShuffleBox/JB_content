00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, our weekly take on Linux and the open source world.

2
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,560
This is episode 41, recorded on February 18, 2018.

3
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:21,560
I'm Chris.

4
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:22,560
And I'm John.

5
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:23,560
Hello, Joe.

6
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:26,800
It's good to be connected with you this week, and we start the week off with a bit of a

7
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:34,640
celebrity project, D-Trace, the famous, world-famous D-Trace, has been relicensed as GPL version

8
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:35,640
2.

9
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:40,600
So hang on, this is Oracle dropping the CDDL and going to GPL?

10
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:41,600
That can't be right.

11
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:42,600
I know.

12
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:43,600
Shocker, shocker.

13
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:46,240
Well, in part, this has been in the works since August.

14
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:48,880
So let's back up and talk about what D-Trace is.

15
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:53,440
D-Trace is a really comprehensive tracing framework that was created by Sun Microsystems

16
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:55,840
back in January of 2005.

17
00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:00,240
Now a tracing framework essentially allows a developer or administrator to watch everything

18
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:05,520
an application does on a system from the application layer all the way down to the kernel.

19
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:10,640
It can be used to get a global overview of a running system, such as the amount of memory

20
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:15,360
or CPU or file system and network resources that an active process is taking.

21
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:20,520
Extremely useful, but it's been rather closed off to Linux users for a long time.

22
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:26,640
And Oracle is relicensing the bits that communicate with the kernel to GPL version 2.

23
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:30,400
That doesn't mean the entire D-Trace stack is going to be GPL 2.

24
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:35,640
In fact, some of the user bits are being relicensed to a totally new license, at least a new license

25
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:42,760
to me, called the UPL, which is apparently the Universal Permissive License, which is

26
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:45,100
compatible with the GPL version 2.

27
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:46,100
Which is good enough, isn't it?

28
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:51,000
At least it's not like the CDDL, which is incompatible with GPL, asterisk, not according

29
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,640
to Canonical.

30
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:55,560
But this is much more straightforward now.

31
00:01:55,560 --> 00:02:00,640
We're not going to have a problem with combining it with GPL software because it's completely

32
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,880
permissive, that bit of it.

33
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:08,400
And so this begs the question, if Oracle can do this for D-Trace, could they possibly do

34
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:09,400
it for ZFS?

35
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:11,680
I wonder about that myself.

36
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:17,160
And there is a very interesting parallel here between ZFS and D-Trace.

37
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:25,020
There is the Oracle D-Trace, and then there's Open D-Trace, which is a totally different

38
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:28,320
project that's been going on for a while now.

39
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:34,240
And just like with ZFS, there's Oracle ZFS, and then there's Open ZFS.

40
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:40,400
Well, Open ZFS is nearly 50% new code from when they forked from Oracle.

41
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:44,720
And so the question that's on my mind is what happens to both Open D-Trace and Open ZFS

42
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:48,880
if Oracle does relicense at least their kernel bits to GPL, which it does seem they could

43
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:49,880
do?

44
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:51,960
This could be their GPL toe in the water, Joe.

45
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:56,880
Well, let's hope so because it means that we can get things working on Linux without

46
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:59,060
any question at all.

47
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:04,360
As I said, we've got it on Ubuntu, but it would be nice for there to be no question

48
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:06,400
mark as to whether that is allowed or not.

49
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:09,760
Yeah, or put another way, maybe Ubuntu was right to ship it if they're eventually going

50
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,580
to relicense anyways.

51
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:12,580
Who knows?

52
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:13,580
We'll just have to wait and see.

53
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:15,040
A note back about D-Trace, though.

54
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:18,800
So yeah, this started around August 1st of 2017, and they've been working towards it.

55
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:24,460
But more recently, the D-Trace Linux kernel Git repository went live with D-Trace commits

56
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:28,620
that have been re-based on top of recent upstream Linux kernel builds.

57
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:33,240
So we may see this submitted upstream to the main Linux kernel, and it just could be something

58
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:36,560
that we get as Linux users in short order.

59
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:41,680
Yeah, hopefully, but from potentially good news to potentially bad news, and that is

60
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:48,920
that Mozilla are adding sponsored stories to the Firefox new tab page, which has come

61
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:52,120
from their Pocket integration.

62
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:57,200
And from what I have seen of people's comments on this, this is just Mozilla moving in the

63
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,960
wrong direction.

64
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:02,080
What don't people freak out about Mozilla these days?

65
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:05,360
When Pocket got shipped, it was a huge controversy.

66
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:09,280
I still remember people being upset about Pocket, and as somebody who switched to Firefox

67
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:13,160
after version 57 again, Pocket's one of my favorite features.

68
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:17,360
And I got to admit something else, been using the new tab page, been using the recommendations

69
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:21,920
on the new tab page when I want a nice, relaxing read in the afternoon or the evening.

70
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:26,520
And while I'm not a huge fan of ads in my browser, if they do them right and it gives

71
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:31,400
them a sustainable revenue stream that isn't the teat of Google, then I'm actually a fan

72
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:32,400
of it.

73
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,280
I'm not a huge fan of it, but I'm a fan of it.

74
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:37,480
Well, that's kind of part of what they said when they announced this, that they want to

75
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:42,400
have relevant adverts that are not just clickbaiting nonsense.

76
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:47,000
And as you have proven, you're already finding it useful.

77
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,840
And they do have to fund it somehow.

78
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:52,720
And if that means that potentially moving away from the Googled money, which let's face

79
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,800
it, that will dry up eventually, won't it?

80
00:04:54,800 --> 00:05:01,260
When crime just completely dominates as it basically already has, then they're going

81
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:02,680
to need a new revenue stream.

82
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:08,600
And this, I suppose, is less offensive than some of the ones, but just coming off the

83
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:14,800
back of this Mr. Robot thing, it's just not the time, well, I suppose when is the time

84
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:20,040
to announce new things like this, but it's just going to rub people the wrong way.

85
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:23,760
And people don't want this from an open source browser.

86
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:25,080
And you're saying Pocket's useful.

87
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:26,640
I use Pocket all the time.

88
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:28,240
They did promise to open source it.

89
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,240
That was a long time ago.

90
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:32,040
There's been a Git repository, there's not much happening there.

91
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:35,840
They certainly not announced anything about running your own server.

92
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:41,880
They just seem to be too much like the competition that they're not differentiating themselves

93
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:43,560
in necessarily the right ways.

94
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:48,080
And the right ways would be to be totally open source, not have these weird proprietary

95
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:54,040
add ons thrust at you and to not be all about marketing and commercialization.

96
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:55,040
Fair enough.

97
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:56,040
I think those are all good points, Joe.

98
00:05:56,040 --> 00:06:01,680
The more you and I talk about Mozilla on this show, I realize they really suck at communicating.

99
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:08,320
They communicate as if they were an offshoot of the Internet Explorer Department at Microsoft

100
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:12,440
from the 90s and then they became a large company and all of a sudden they had to communicate

101
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:13,520
with the world.

102
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:19,580
If they came out and they communicated more effectively, I think people would be on board.

103
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:20,580
How have they communicated?

104
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:22,520
Well, here's an example.

105
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:26,680
The reason for doing this is because they believe they can create a platform that supports

106
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:31,960
high quality content that respects users' privacy and that puts control back into the

107
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:34,080
hands of users.

108
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:37,640
And they're going to do so in a way that is financially sustainable for the future health

109
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:38,960
of the web.

110
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:41,160
So they're going to explore the ways to do this.

111
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:43,960
Now, what are they saying there?

112
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:46,840
It sounds like they want to build a platform, it sounds like they want to create lock-in,

113
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:50,680
it sounds like they want to generate revenue and have hand selected content.

114
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:52,600
Those things all sound bad.

115
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:57,940
But what I believe the intention behind that paragraph is we want to find a sustainable

116
00:06:57,940 --> 00:07:03,520
funding model so that way we can keep fighting for the free web because if we go down, then

117
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:07,440
it's Microsoft and Google and a little bit of Apple that are going to run this whole

118
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:08,620
show.

119
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:12,640
And so we're trying to come up with a way to make money that still respects privacy,

120
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:17,480
that can be done in a classy way, that takes lessons learned from the rest of the web and

121
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:22,840
how we've tried to monetize, we being the internet, have tried to monetize ads on the

122
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:23,840
web for all of these years.

123
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:26,800
We're going to look at those lessons, we're going to take those lessons in and we're going

124
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:30,660
to implement something that's better so that way we can stop taking money from companies

125
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:34,020
like Yahoo and Google but keep fighting for a free web.

126
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:37,940
And if they literally said it like that, I don't think there would be any question about

127
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:40,760
why they're doing this, I don't think there would be any problem.

128
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:45,500
But because they speak like there's some sort of offshoot from the Internet Explorer Department

129
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:49,800
from the 1990s, they come across like bureaucrats.

130
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:53,600
And we don't trust bureaucrats anymore, we as in people of the Internet.

131
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:59,440
And when they start talking about platforms and high quality content and financially sustainable,

132
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:03,760
it comes across like a bunch of bureaucrats that are trying to figure out their next revenue

133
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:04,760
grab.

134
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:06,880
Yeah, I can't argue with any of that, man.

135
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:08,440
It's just communication issues.

136
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:11,060
Yeah, I think here's what I've decided to do now.

137
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:17,040
In light of the way I now look at Mozilla is I just have to go by their actions.

138
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:19,040
I do like how they're rolling this out.

139
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:22,540
So first of all, they're only going to do this in the US to start with.

140
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:25,680
So if you're outside the US, you're not even going to see this for a while.

141
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:30,180
It's only going to be in a certain small portion of the US user base.

142
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:35,100
And it's only on the new tabs page where they're going to have recommendations from pocket,

143
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:40,200
places you've been to recently, and one of their handpicked sponsored posts.

144
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:44,180
See that's a totally different thing than something like Google ads where it's a bunch

145
00:08:44,180 --> 00:08:49,880
of machines that are just choosing the ads based on random auctions and then just putting

146
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:52,840
up something based on keywords that they think is right.

147
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:56,680
This is going to be something in theory that somebody who's been charged with a job at

148
00:08:56,680 --> 00:09:03,260
Mozilla is going to be handpicking and putting a tile on a small sub portion of the US user

149
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:05,520
base of Firefox.

150
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:07,840
And that's how this is starting.

151
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:09,640
Those actions I completely agree with.

152
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:12,660
That seems reasonable and like a good way to roll this out.

153
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:18,120
And I'm also totally in support of them coming up with revenue models outside of their existing

154
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:19,120
ones.

155
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:23,360
It's just how they've talked about it, how they kind of slip it in, and the way that

156
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,880
this whole pocket thing has been received to begin with.

157
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:29,800
I think if this whole pocket controversy had been communicated properly from the beginning,

158
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:34,680
we wouldn't be still experiencing the ripples of people's dissatisfaction with that pocket

159
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:35,680
transaction.

160
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:41,920
Yeah, well, Google are also kind of guilty of miscommunicating when it comes to AMP accelerated

161
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:44,080
mobile pages.

162
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:48,560
People have long since said it's disingenuous of them to claim that the idea is to make

163
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:53,880
the web more open and faster for everyone.

164
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:57,240
And we talked about that previously, but this week they've come out with AMP Stories and

165
00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:02,440
AMP for Email, which pretty much backs up that it's not about the open web.

166
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:06,960
It's about Google wanting to dominate with things that they've come up with themselves.

167
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:10,200
That's a really strong opening statement, but I can't disagree.

168
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:13,880
The part that is the most offensive about this news today that I'm going to explain

169
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:19,360
is the part that I was actually very dismissive at first, because when I hear something that's

170
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:22,540
Snapchat-like stories, I have this mechanism in my brain.

171
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:26,000
It's kind of like the cloud to bud extension for a lot of people's browsers, it just muted

172
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
immediately.

173
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Oh, Snapchat?

174
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
I tune it out.

175
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:33,560
This is actually very insidious, though, and I can see why big organizations are going

176
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:35,080
to gobble this up.

177
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:43,200
In Google's failure to get buzz and failure to have Google Plus and even Wave take hold,

178
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:47,520
they've realized where their strengths lie, email and search.

179
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:49,520
That is their power zone.

180
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:53,860
So why not introduce social-like features to these platforms?

181
00:10:53,860 --> 00:11:00,720
So AMP Stories is going to bring visual interactive elements to Google Search, just like Snapchat

182
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:04,840
Stories, with visually rich storytelling, Google says.

183
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:09,680
And of course, it's all powered using AMP, it's cross-platform, and it'll be right there

184
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:10,840
in the search results.

185
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:15,680
Where the knowledge cards are today, there's now going to be interactive visual stories,

186
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:20,840
and all the publisher has to do is just turn a few extra features on on their publishing

187
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:24,400
platform, install a few Google plug-ins, and they can start publishing these interactive

188
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:27,360
stories right to Google Search results.

189
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:31,840
Google is saying, ah, we don't need our own social network, we own Search with this move.

190
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:36,340
But am I just radically out of touch here, or does this sound like a terrible idea, both

191
00:11:36,340 --> 00:11:38,580
stories and email?

192
00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:43,280
I don't want extra stuff added to these things.

193
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:48,520
And the idea of animated graphics and stuff happening in Search, I can't help but feel

194
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:53,400
that if this takes off, then 10 years down the line, we're going to look back on it the

195
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:59,640
same way we looked at Blink and Marquee in the early websites and animated GIFs and stuff.

196
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:02,160
It just is naff and just not what we need.

197
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:06,500
We want simplicity, not trying to make it fancy for its own sake.

198
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:07,720
So let's talk about the email part.

199
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:13,200
So yeah, they're also announcing AMP for Gmail, starting with Gmail developer previews of

200
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,840
AMP, which is available today.

201
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:20,440
These new features will allow users to perform simple tasks, such as booking calendar appointments,

202
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:24,560
checking into flights, all directly within an email using AMP for Email.

203
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:28,160
Yeah, you said AMP for Gmail originally there, which is what this actually is.

204
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:32,480
And yet they're calling it AMP for Email to try and suggest that it's for the open web,

205
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:33,600
it's for anyone to use.

206
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,760
But who else is actually going to use it?

207
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:36,760
Exactly.

208
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:43,080
Both AMP for the web and now AMP Stories and AMP for Email are solving problems that should

209
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:44,880
be solved in different ways.

210
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:47,960
And they're consolidating this all onto Google services.

211
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:51,240
I think Google realized that when they couldn't build their own social network, they just

212
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:52,720
needed to own the entire web.

213
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:55,760
So they're making a hard play with Chrome right now, and they're eating up market share

214
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:57,120
like a madman.

215
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:01,060
They're rolling out AMP, iterating on that, and they're not slowing down.

216
00:13:01,060 --> 00:13:06,240
And then now you combine that with their new annoying ad blocking, quote unquote, they're

217
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:10,880
baking into Chrome where Google, who makes all of their money from selling ads, is going

218
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:16,120
to determine what ads people should be able to see in the world's most popular browser.

219
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:21,380
And now in the world's most popular search, if you use their AMP technology, you can give

220
00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:26,560
users a very special experience that they'll only see on Google search.

221
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:28,800
And it works best in Google Chrome.

222
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:29,800
Obviously.

223
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:32,600
Yeah, it's just them wanting to completely dominate.

224
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:34,480
And can you really blame them?

225
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:39,440
That's what a business's whole job is to do, is to dominate a market.

226
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:42,720
And for us to complain about that is just ridiculous.

227
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,880
That's what they should be doing.

228
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:45,880
That's their job.

229
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:46,880
I agree.

230
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:50,480
Well, going back to our Mozilla discussion, Mozilla could be hammering these points.

231
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:55,520
I suspect, and who knows, this is total rampant speculation, but perhaps the financial agreement

232
00:13:55,520 --> 00:14:00,400
with Google is too great to come directly out and hit these points hard.

233
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:05,240
But we do need a Batman to swoop in with a cape on and save us from this particular problem.

234
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:12,360
Mozilla could be that Batman, and yet they can't communicate it clearly.

235
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:13,360
Last.ting.com.

236
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:15,240
It's a smarter way to do mobile.

237
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:19,680
And the average Ting bill is just $23 per phone per month.

238
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:21,520
It's pay for what you use wireless.

239
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:26,480
So you pay for your minutes, your messages, and your megabytes, and then $6 for the line

240
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:27,480
itself.

241
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:28,480
That's it.

242
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:29,480
Well, then Uncle Sam's tax.

243
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:30,480
That's it right there.

244
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:31,480
$6 for a line.

245
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:37,520
And then your usage, nationwide coverage, CDMA and GSM, no contracts, no quote unquote

246
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:39,640
commitments or service agreements.

247
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:44,400
And then, I don't know what, maybe it's just me, but all our sponsors have the best dashboards.

248
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:47,700
And Ting, nobody beats Ting's dashboard in the mobile industry.

249
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:48,700
Go check it out.

250
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:49,700
Last.ting.com.

251
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:50,700
Support the show.

252
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:55,000
Get $25 in service credit if you bring a device, because remember, I did mention they support

253
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:59,060
CDMA and GSM, which means there's lots of devices you can bring.

254
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:03,120
They have a BYOD page, and there's lots of devices you can choose from.

255
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:07,100
If you want to buy one brand new, I'm going to give a quick recommendation for the Moto

256
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:09,000
G5s Plus.

257
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:13,400
$254 when you go to last.ting.com, you own it outright.

258
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:16,380
No payments, no contract, nothing.

259
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:18,960
You own the device like you own your computer.

260
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:21,540
And it has CDMA and GSM support.

261
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:26,360
It has 32 gigs of built-in storage, but micro SD can go up to 128 gigs.

262
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:30,320
And my favorite feature, the Motorola's have the turbo power charging.

263
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:34,320
You can get six hours of battery life in 15 minutes of charging.

264
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:41,700
It also runs Android 8.0, so it's a good future phone as well for $254.

265
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:46,400
The Moto G5s Plus and many others are at Ting, last.ting.com.

266
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:55,500
Okay, let's talk about Ubuntu and a bit of drama that came out this week from a seemingly

267
00:15:55,500 --> 00:16:00,040
innocuous mailing list post by Will Cook.

268
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:05,000
It caused a massive storm on Reddit and all over, really.

269
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:10,600
And it all boils down to they want to collect some data on their user base.

270
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:15,400
And so there's no way that this could possibly be anything but evil and them spying on their

271
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:16,400
users, right?

272
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:20,160
Well, I think it's clear that they want to know exactly where every single Ubuntu user

273
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:25,720
lives down to the room and maybe perhaps even grab screenshots of their computing sessions,

274
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:26,720
right?

275
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:27,720
That's what came out of this announcement?

276
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:32,240
Yeah, and their webcams and stuff.

277
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:34,840
I understand people are concerned about this kind of stuff.

278
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:37,400
And yes, it would be checked on by default.

279
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:41,220
But the way they're talking about this is it would be in the installer.

280
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:44,000
So it would be an install option.

281
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,960
And you know, I hope they picked the right verbiage here.

282
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:49,720
Learn from our friends at Mozilla.

283
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:54,680
Make sure you communicate clearly that this is going to be a one time shot of information

284
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:56,200
after install.

285
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:59,400
Once the networking comes online, they're going to upload the information.

286
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:04,280
And then there's popcorn, which remains active in the background, which would report periodically

287
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:06,080
about the packages you install.

288
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:08,020
And then there's crash reporting software.

289
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:12,660
So we're not talking telemetry from Windows 10 here, where it's everything you do is being

290
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:15,760
submitted back to Microsoft on an ongoing basis.

291
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:18,700
We're really talking about one big shot after you install.

292
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:22,520
So that way, they get an idea if you have a trackpad and the kind of Wi-Fi that you

293
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:23,520
have.

294
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:25,280
And they're pretty clear about what they would look at.

295
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:31,920
The CPU family, disk sizes, GPU, OEM vendor, if you have Livepatch turned on, the disk

296
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:34,000
layout that you've chosen.

297
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,360
I think all of these things would help them make a better product.

298
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:39,560
So it makes sense why they would want this information.

299
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:43,480
I'd like to hear what you think, because I definitely have a couple of concerns.

300
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:47,080
A couple of red lights are flashing pretty rapidly in my brain right now.

301
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:49,500
And I don't know, I'd kind of like to know what you think.

302
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:52,960
I hate to sit on the fence, but that's where I am on this.

303
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:55,240
I haven't made up my mind yet.

304
00:17:55,240 --> 00:18:00,360
Because on the one hand, it is incredibly useful information that they can make the

305
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:02,120
product better with.

306
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:04,640
And it's going to benefit the users.

307
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:10,480
But on the other hand, it feels that they have to do it really, really well, otherwise

308
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:12,560
it could go horribly wrong.

309
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:16,600
Because he's talking about, in this mailing list post, publishing this data as well in

310
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:21,840
an anonymized format, which is essentially statistics, which is useful.

311
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:28,280
I would love to know what OEMs people are using and a bunch of that stuff, and how modern

312
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:32,080
CPUs people are using statistically.

313
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:38,200
But the thing is, although, yes, he's talking about the information being sent over HTTPS,

314
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:45,840
what I would really love to see is them open source exactly what's at their end of this.

315
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:50,840
And obviously, everything at our end is open source anyway, send it over a secure connection.

316
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:52,760
And then really, people can't complain, can they?

317
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:56,220
If they know exactly what's happening with this data and how it's being sent and how

318
00:18:56,220 --> 00:18:57,220
it's being collected.

319
00:18:57,220 --> 00:19:04,200
But I just fear that if they bungle even one slight part of that, it could go horribly

320
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:05,200
wrong.

321
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:08,960
I think the number one thing I do like about this is that they're going to make the data

322
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:09,960
public.

323
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:12,040
That could be fascinating for a lot of people.

324
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:13,040
And you are so right.

325
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:16,480
If they were open sourcing this, where it was something that other distributions could

326
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:22,160
even jump in on and use, that would be really valuable, or at least self-host.

327
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:25,640
The other thing I'll say that would make me feel a lot more comfortable about this, and

328
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:33,680
they're discussing this right now, is a really clear checkbox to opt out later on after install.

329
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:37,520
Because I have several questions about this, and making a clear, easy place for somebody

330
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:42,200
to go, like in the privacy section of GNOME settings to turn this off, would be a slam

331
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:43,200
dunk.

332
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,880
Because how does this work for OEMs?

333
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:50,520
If I buy an Ubuntu laptop from Dell, and they install it for me, are they checking that

334
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:51,520
box?

335
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:52,520
I would assume it would be a policy.

336
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:56,800
And because Canonical is one of their trusted partners, they would probably turn it on by

337
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:57,800
default.

338
00:19:57,800 --> 00:20:02,400
So I would like to have a checkbox in GNOME settings to turn it the hell off if I didn't

339
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,400
like it.

340
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:05,600
Personally, I'd actually probably leave it on.

341
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:10,000
And then the other thing I have to wonder about is how does this affect downstream distributions,

342
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,720
like Elementary OS or Ubuntu MATE?

343
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:17,000
How will they be impacted by this code upstream?

344
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:21,800
And it's even more interesting for distributions like Pop OS and Elementary OS that might not

345
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:23,720
be using the Ubiquiti installer.

346
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:27,840
Well, yeah, that is a big question about the downstream distros, and they need to work

347
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:32,800
with them, essentially, or at least make it really easy for them to either disable this

348
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:35,400
or enable it, depending on what they want to do.

349
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:38,880
And the flavors like Ubuntu MATE, well, they're using Ubiquiti.

350
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:43,560
So the question is, is it something that they're going to have to integrate into their control

351
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:48,560
panel or settings menu somewhere to disable it afterwards?

352
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:50,480
There's a lot of questions here.

353
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:54,760
And I suppose that's the point of proposing this on an open mailing list where everyone

354
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:56,440
can have their say.

355
00:20:56,440 --> 00:21:02,560
But I asked Poppy about when Will is planning to implement this or thinking about implementing

356
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:07,680
this, and it is in 1804, which is in a couple of months' time.

357
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:12,880
Which seems like an awfully short period of time to be thinking about this.

358
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:15,320
But 1804 is going to be a huge release for them.

359
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:18,080
It's going to have a lot of users, and there's a lot of valuable data there.

360
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:20,160
So you can see why they want to put this in there.

361
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:25,480
But is that enough time for all the flavors and downstream projects to be consulted and

362
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:26,480
have their say?

363
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:27,480
I suspect not.

364
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:29,920
Yeah, you nailed my main concern right there.

365
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:34,440
That's what I've kind of been biting my tongue about is it feels too soon for 1804, but I

366
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:38,760
totally understand why you would want 1804 because for the next five years, that's going

367
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:40,000
to have...

368
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:44,920
And I know because I went to the Ubuntu rally, and Mark Shuttleworth talked about in one

369
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:53,480
of his keynotes that the LTS has a ginormous larger user base than all of the other intermediate

370
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:54,480
releases.

371
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:57,520
People do jump from LTS to LTS.

372
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:00,800
1710 bucks the trend a little bit because it's so different.

373
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:06,500
But if you take 1710 out of the data, the LTSs can be as much as 20x users compared

374
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:08,720
to the intermediate releases.

375
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:13,040
And so there's a huge incentive to try to collect as much data as possible because those

376
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:14,600
are the releases that really matter.

377
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:15,920
I totally understand that.

378
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:18,840
I realize those are the dynamics that they're working with.

379
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:24,680
At the same time, 1804 comes out in April, and they are talking about building a back-end

380
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:30,480
infrastructure to store all of this information securely and privately.

381
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:34,440
That feels like that's a year-long project just in the design and building and testing

382
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:35,440
phase.

383
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:36,440
I don't know.

384
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:37,440
Not necessarily.

385
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:38,440
I think it is.

386
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:39,440
Absolutely.

387
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:42,360
Because you've got to test data leakage from the client side, transmitting it up to the

388
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:43,360
server.

389
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:45,840
You've got to make sure that nobody in the middle can figure out who's talking to the

390
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:48,480
server by getting involved in the session.

391
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:52,140
There's all kinds of things you discover when you take a data set and you make it public.

392
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:56,200
People have been often shocked how people can wheel down who is who.

393
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:58,560
It is really particular information.

394
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:03,680
It's your hardware, it's a vague area of where you're at, it's your versioning.

395
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:08,080
There's more and more layers to this that you can use to whittle down who an exact person

396
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:09,240
is.

397
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:11,880
There should be some public testing of that data first.

398
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:14,240
It should really start with a small subset.

399
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:17,600
Maybe it should have already been beta tested in 1710 at this point.

400
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:20,600
People should be reporting on it, and we should be finding these bugs out.

401
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:23,720
We should be discovering that things aren't working quite right.

402
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:29,520
This could be me channeling a little bit of fear from the way that the Unity Dash search

403
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:30,520
was rolled out.

404
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:35,120
I hate to draw a parallel here because they are not the same things, but Unity Dash search

405
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:39,600
came out, I think it was in 1204, mid-cycle.

406
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:45,400
It was one of the quote-unquote surprise features of 1204, and it very quickly was discovered

407
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:49,640
that it wasn't encrypting the data correctly, it wasn't storing the information correctly.

408
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:54,420
There was a lot of little small things that weren't major issues to fix, but didn't get

409
00:23:54,420 --> 00:23:57,480
discovered until a lot of people were using the software.

410
00:23:57,480 --> 00:24:00,040
Yeah, but come on, it's a checkbox.

411
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:03,160
It might be on by default, and most people might stick to defaults, but all you have

412
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:05,640
to do is just uncheck that, problem solved.

413
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:06,800
Yeah, okay.

414
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:07,800
You know what though?

415
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:12,160
If you go search Google today, you will still see people writing articles about the Unity

416
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:13,720
spyware.

417
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:19,160
That was true with the Amazon affiliate search stuff, and it still branded them badly.

418
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:24,680
If it was me, Joe, if I was shipping this, I would take it a little bit safe.

419
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:29,240
I would include the checkbox with all of the same information and the full disclaimer about

420
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:33,160
the types of information that would be collected, but I would start small.

421
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:38,800
And then over 1804's life cycle via updates, I would increase the functionality of what

422
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:44,240
that thing collects, and how it collects it, and how we store it as it evolves.

423
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:49,840
That you start small, you ship a minimum viable product, and you get the user consent upfront

424
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:54,920
during installation of 1804, and then you iterate on it over the life cycle of 1804

425
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:58,720
and make it more complete, and then you have time to build it properly.

426
00:24:58,720 --> 00:24:59,720
This is all new.

427
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:03,200
We're learning about it this week, and those are my initial concerns.

428
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:06,860
Thinking about it though, I could totally see how it helps them make a better product.

429
00:25:06,860 --> 00:25:09,840
If they have an idea that a lot of people are using a certain set of applications, then

430
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:15,720
they can focus on that security-wise and feature-wise, trackpads, Wi-Fi chips, GPUs, et cetera.

431
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:19,600
It is a necessary function for them to make a better desktop, and I'm going to turn it

432
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:22,840
on on my systems, and I'm just having a lot of faith that they'll work these things out

433
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:25,920
because I am concerned that they're rushing this whole thing.

434
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:30,000
Well, one of the data points that they will no doubt be collecting is whether or not you're

435
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,760
using the minimal install option in 1804.

436
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:36,800
And this is going to be another checkbox in Ubiquiti, which is going to allow you to install

437
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:40,080
Ubuntu but without loads of packages.

438
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:43,640
It's pretty much just going to be GNOME and a web browser, and that's it, so not even

439
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:46,480
an email client and no torrent client, that sort of thing.

440
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:52,840
Yeah, not to be confused with the mini ISO, like Joe said, it's just a checkbox, and probably

441
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:53,840
the one I'll be using.

442
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:57,240
I don't need Thunderbird or Rhythmbox or Cheese or Shotwell.

443
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:58,240
I think I'm going to use this.

444
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:02,240
Yeah, it's certainly what I would use if I was going to install the main Ubuntu.

445
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:07,160
Ubuntu have been offering a separate ISO for this for a while, but I think it's just a

446
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:08,280
much more sensible thing.

447
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:12,240
Why not just bake it into the installer instead of having to have a totally separate ISO?

448
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:14,080
So yeah, this is a great move from them.

449
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:20,040
Well, speaking of Ubuntu, if the dream of using your phone as the one device, the convergence

450
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:24,320
device, if you will, then the Linux on Galaxy project has probably gotten your attention.

451
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:28,800
We've talked about it before on the show, and there's been a bit of movement on Samsung's

452
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:29,800
part this week.

453
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:34,120
Yeah, now they're calling it Linux on DEX, D-E-X, which is the hardware that you need

454
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:38,040
to use it, but there still seems to be a bit of confusion about the branding.

455
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:43,200
But anyway, they've come out with a survey, and this is to try and ascertain exactly

456
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:46,480
what people want from this.

457
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:50,120
And as I always say with these surveys, if you don't take part in them and don't give

458
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:54,040
them the data that they need to make the decisions, then don't go complaining when the actual

459
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:55,040
thing comes out.

460
00:26:55,040 --> 00:27:00,400
And they ask you a whole bunch of stuff about whether you're a current Linux user and what

461
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:02,160
distro and stuff you use.

462
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:06,600
And also, I think the key question, one of the last ones is, would you be willing to

463
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:08,400
pay for this?

464
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:12,320
And I don't think many people are going to say yes to that, but you never know.

465
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:15,820
They have to make money somehow, even if it's not just on the hardware, because there's

466
00:27:15,820 --> 00:27:18,160
a lot of software support, isn't there?

467
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:21,840
It's not like the phones where they just push a few OTAs and then abandon it.

468
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:27,520
They're going to have to, I think, to make this secure, do a lot of development work.

469
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:30,720
So they're probably going to have to have a revenue stream in there.

470
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:34,080
And so it's probably going to be some sort of subscription model, although I'm hoping

471
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:39,920
that people will hack it and make it run lineage and totally open source software.

472
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:40,920
Yeah, interesting.

473
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:46,600
If you say you're willing to pay for Linux in the survey, they then ask you a 13th question,

474
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:49,880
and that is, how much money would you be willing to pay?

475
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:53,920
Well, you can see what I answered to that question then.

476
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:54,920
Did you say no?

477
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:55,920
Of course.

478
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:56,920
Yeah, I can take you said no.

479
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:57,920
Mm-hmm.

480
00:27:57,920 --> 00:28:03,640
Well, they ask you, would you be willing to pay $0 to $10, $10 to $50, $50 to $100, or

481
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:07,200
over $100, money does not matter.

482
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:12,400
I'm going to, you know what, just to skew the results, I'm going to answer that one.

483
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:17,240
But when I think about it, I'm not sure if I would be willing, if I've got to drop $1,000

484
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:23,000
on a phone, and I've got to drop $150 on a Dex doc, and let's be honest, to make that

485
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:28,760
work, I probably need at least one or two, because you have to have the Dex doc to invoke

486
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:30,360
this Linux desktop.

487
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:32,880
So you're going to want that at home and at work, or you're going to want that at a couple

488
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:35,600
of stations, otherwise, what's the point?

489
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:42,080
So it is getting kind of expensive to then buy Linux access on top of that, especially

490
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:47,520
if they end up using something that is just inherently available via kernel features.

491
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:50,680
That gets a little harder to justify paying a lot of money for.

492
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:52,800
They'd have to really nail the experience.

493
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:56,680
And then I'd probably be willing to do it.

494
00:28:56,680 --> 00:29:00,000
But something tells me they would try to sell it through some sort of weird Samsung store

495
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,600
and not the Play Store.

496
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:02,600
Yeah.

497
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:07,840
I think if it was a subscription model of, I don't know, $5 a month maybe, it might gain

498
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:12,360
some traction in enterprise, but I think it all depends on what that experience is actually

499
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:13,360
going to be like.

500
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:16,120
Is it going to be good enough for developers and stuff?

501
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:21,040
Because I can't see normal people using this, people who would use Windows normally switching

502
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:22,880
to Linux because it's available on this.

503
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:28,120
You're talking about people who are using the subsystem in Windows, pretty much, who

504
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:30,840
would be interested in having a device for this.

505
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:35,880
I don't know, there's been a lot of attempts at this before, and Samsung is a huge company,

506
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:39,920
and maybe it'll spur a bit more Linux adoption, but I don't know, I'm not holding my breath

507
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:42,320
for a massive success here, really.

508
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:45,600
You know, I'm about to hit the road and go to scale, and I have to be honest, it would

509
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:51,000
give me a bit of peace of mind if I knew I could take my phone with me and do everything

510
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,980
I need from the road.

511
00:29:52,980 --> 00:29:54,640
That's where they're getting for developers.

512
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:58,240
They're not there for content producers yet, but that's where they're getting for software

513
00:29:58,240 --> 00:29:59,240
developers.

514
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:04,120
And if you put your mind in that sort of frame of reference, it is sort of a compelling device,

515
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:10,240
a $1,000 phone, which you almost have to get anyways these days if you're a software developer.

516
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:14,420
It also can be your emergency workstation where you can bring up the Firefox web browser

517
00:30:14,420 --> 00:30:17,200
and a terminal and maybe Eclipse.

518
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:18,800
I can see where their head's at.

519
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:21,520
I don't know if anybody's willing to put their wallets there, but I guess we'll just have

520
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:22,520
to wait and see.

521
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:23,520
Yeah.

522
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:28,080
Well, a quick follow-up on last week, we talked about Linux running on the Nintendo Switch,

523
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:31,780
and it was just kind of a command line, and I said, we're not going to have GNOME running

524
00:30:31,780 --> 00:30:35,080
on this, and then I kind of jokingly said, ah, someone will probably hack it.

525
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:38,480
And sure enough, we've now had from the same people who hacked it in the first place fail

526
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:43,800
overflow, a demo of it running the Plasma desktop and Chromium browser, and actually

527
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:47,000
running quite nicely with touchscreen and everything.

528
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,720
Yeah, it does run really good.

529
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:52,000
That was the thing I noticed, and I was like, oh, damn, the Switch has good touchscreen

530
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,100
support under Linux.

531
00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:58,360
This is the moment where I realized, I bet I could justify this as a tax write-off for

532
00:30:58,360 --> 00:30:59,360
the job.

533
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:04,000
Maybe if I end up with one, but it totally crossed my mind.

534
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,000
Nice.

535
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:09,440
Well, you heard me mention earlier, I'm going to be at scale in just a couple of weeks.

536
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:13,600
March 8th through the 11th is scale in Pasadena, California.

537
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:14,600
I know, I know.

538
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:16,200
