Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, our weekly take on Linux and the open-source world.

00:16.240 --> 00:20.280
This is episode 12, recorded on July 29th, 2017.

00:20.280 --> 00:21.280
I'm Chris.

00:21.280 --> 00:22.280
And I'm Joe.

00:22.280 --> 00:23.280
Hello, Joe.

00:23.280 --> 00:26.800
We have quite a lineup today for folks who love to run Linux on the desktop and maybe

00:26.800 --> 00:30.400
something that we might look back and say was a bit historical.

00:30.400 --> 00:35.520
Why don't we jump into some of the interesting bits happening with the Ubuntu Mate project?

00:35.520 --> 00:36.520
They have a new Alpha.

00:36.520 --> 00:38.960
Yeah, Alpha 2 of 17.10.

00:38.960 --> 00:40.560
Why are we talking about an Alpha?

00:40.560 --> 00:45.920
Well, you kind of alluded to it last week, and now it's actually available to download.

00:45.920 --> 00:52.680
This I think is the biggest release 17.10 for Ubuntu Mate since they became an official

00:52.680 --> 00:53.680
flavor.

00:53.680 --> 00:58.560
Okay, it's only an Alpha at this stage, so you're not going to run it on production systems,

00:58.560 --> 01:03.640
but it's well worth checking this out because if you remember at the beginning of Ubuntu

01:03.640 --> 01:08.940
Mate, they picked up a ton of Unity refugees, people who did not want to change.

01:08.940 --> 01:11.040
They were used to GNOME 2.

01:11.040 --> 01:12.680
They were happy with it.

01:12.680 --> 01:15.400
All this Unity, this is a completely different way of doing things.

01:15.400 --> 01:19.040
We're not interested anymore, and so they happily settled on Ubuntu Mate, and they've

01:19.040 --> 01:21.880
been quietly using it ever since.

01:21.880 --> 01:26.960
And now Unity is going away, and so the next release of Ubuntu proper is going to have

01:26.960 --> 01:33.040
GNOME, and so there's a whole bunch of people who got used to Unity 7, and now they want

01:33.040 --> 01:35.760
to keep using that same workflow.

01:35.760 --> 01:43.520
And so Martin Wimpress, Wimpy, has been working away in the background with his mutiny layout

01:43.520 --> 01:48.400
for the panels, and now it's got global menus.

01:48.400 --> 01:54.300
It's got the HUD, so you can search within applications.

01:54.300 --> 01:58.680
He's basically trying to do the same thing again for the people who actually changed

01:58.680 --> 02:00.920
to Unity who don't want to change back.

02:00.920 --> 02:06.680
Right, giving them a landing spot, essentially, to move to, a new island for them to jump

02:06.680 --> 02:07.680
to.

02:07.680 --> 02:12.720
And you left out my favorite new feature, which is complete super key support throughout

02:12.720 --> 02:18.920
several of the different panel layouts, which is not only was it the representation of touching

02:18.920 --> 02:23.160
multiple projects, which is interesting to see the way the Ubuntu Mate project is doing

02:23.160 --> 02:24.160
this.

02:24.160 --> 02:28.360
They'll decide on a feature, and then they'll work across multiple projects with multiple

02:28.360 --> 02:31.160
different maintainers to get the feature implemented.

02:31.160 --> 02:34.640
So it's in the settings daemon, it's in the Mate menu, it's in the Brisk menu, it's in

02:34.640 --> 02:39.960
the dock applet, and now you can also do super key and then other buttons.

02:39.960 --> 02:43.840
So say you want to activate menus and other key bindings that use the super key.

02:43.840 --> 02:45.880
It's not just hard lock to menu launching.

02:45.880 --> 02:49.400
Now I want to step back for a second and double down on why we're talking about an alpha right

02:49.400 --> 02:51.640
here at the top of Linux Action News this week.

02:51.640 --> 02:57.540
I believe this is the ripple effect of the announcement from switching from Unity to

02:57.540 --> 02:59.280
GNOME by Mark Shuttleworth.

02:59.280 --> 03:01.960
This is the ripples of that.

03:01.960 --> 03:07.040
You not only have a pretty solid 1710 base because it's mostly an improvement bug fix

03:07.040 --> 03:11.520
if you take off all the GNOME and GUI stuff, you remove all the transition to GNOME stuff

03:11.520 --> 03:14.000
and 1710 is pretty rock solid.

03:14.000 --> 03:18.520
And so the Ubuntu Mate project has been able to leverage that and they already have something

03:18.520 --> 03:22.520
that I've been able to use at the alpha stage.

03:22.520 --> 03:27.880
And I ran the mutiny tweak specifically, you go into the Mate tweak applet and you say

03:27.880 --> 03:34.220
I want this layout for my panels and I chose the mutiny interface and then boom, and you

03:34.220 --> 03:35.520
have the mutiny layout.

03:35.520 --> 03:37.280
And it's pretty close, Joe.

03:37.280 --> 03:38.280
It's pretty close.

03:38.280 --> 03:42.120
And you turn on something like Compiz, which I recommend and I double checked with our

03:42.120 --> 03:45.400
friend Martin Wimpress, is still being maintained by a canonical employee.

03:45.400 --> 03:50.080
So Compiz is still getting the love and you turn on the mutiny interface, you enable Compiz

03:50.080 --> 03:52.660
and it gets really, really close, Joe.

03:52.660 --> 03:57.320
The only problem I can see is the dash isn't there yet.

03:57.320 --> 04:01.680
And it's something I spoke to Martin about today and I suggested Sling's Cold, which

04:01.680 --> 04:07.920
is a launcher which is quite similar to, I suppose it's more similar to Gnome Shell really,

04:07.920 --> 04:13.360
but it's got that kind of big icon touch screeny type interface.

04:13.360 --> 04:14.920
He said he's working on something.

04:14.920 --> 04:19.000
It's not Sling's Cold because he tried it and it didn't work that well, but he's working

04:19.000 --> 04:22.200
on that final piece basically.

04:22.200 --> 04:26.760
But the important thing to not forget here is that you don't have to use this mutiny

04:26.760 --> 04:27.760
layout.

04:27.760 --> 04:34.400
You can use traditional Ubuntu 10.04 Gnome layout, or he's got a Redmond layout, which

04:34.400 --> 04:38.840
is what I would use because look, I like the Windows XP layout.

04:38.840 --> 04:39.840
What can I say?

04:39.840 --> 04:41.640
Or rather the Windows 7, I suppose.

04:41.640 --> 04:45.640
I like to have a panel at the bottom, I like to have a menu in the bottom left, I like

04:45.640 --> 04:47.880
to have my clock in the bottom right.

04:47.880 --> 04:51.000
So it's versatile, it's diverse.

04:51.000 --> 04:52.940
You can have whatever you want with it.

04:52.940 --> 04:58.080
And thanks to Marte Tweak, it's a few clicks away to decide what you want.

04:58.080 --> 05:05.300
And you've got OS X or Mac OS, Clone, you've got Pantheon, which is subtly different and

05:05.300 --> 05:07.360
more like elementary OS.

05:07.360 --> 05:11.960
The thing is that he's got a lot of choices here, but it's, I should say they really,

05:11.960 --> 05:14.920
because it's not just Martin, it's the whole Ubuntu Marte team.

05:14.920 --> 05:20.000
But there's all these choices and it's really simple to select between them.

05:20.000 --> 05:23.640
And that to me is where this is really shining.

05:23.640 --> 05:28.240
It's not like Plasma where you've got all the options in the world, but it's quite hard

05:28.240 --> 05:29.240
to discover them.

05:29.240 --> 05:31.720
This is all in one place, it's really simple.

05:31.720 --> 05:37.440
And I've talked about moving to Plasma because XFCE is what I use and maybe that isn't going

05:37.440 --> 05:39.800
to make the transition to GTK3 and stuff.

05:39.800 --> 05:42.320
But let's be realistic.

05:42.320 --> 05:45.380
If I'm going to move anywhere, it's basically going to be to Ubuntu Marte.

05:45.380 --> 05:48.280
I was wondering, I mean, you seem pretty impressed by it.

05:48.280 --> 05:53.040
But one of the things that I like about Ubuntu Marte and the Marte desktop in general is

05:53.040 --> 05:55.160
where they have forked, I agree.

05:55.160 --> 06:01.600
So my favorite fork is Kaja, the file manager, which is more like the original Nautilus file

06:01.600 --> 06:03.280
manager with a lot more features.

06:03.280 --> 06:07.360
Yeah, well, instead of stripping the features out like Nautilus has had, it's just kept

06:07.360 --> 06:08.360
them.

06:08.360 --> 06:09.360
Yeah.

06:09.360 --> 06:10.360
So what would push you over?

06:10.360 --> 06:11.360
Why not make the switch?

06:11.360 --> 06:12.900
Is it just simply no reason?

06:12.900 --> 06:13.900
Everything's working?

06:13.900 --> 06:14.900
Yeah.

06:14.900 --> 06:18.320
So at the moment, I'm on 16.04, things are working fine.

06:18.320 --> 06:24.160
If 18.04 is working fine, then I'll just switch, you know, just upgrade Ubuntu to that.

06:24.160 --> 06:29.800
And it's only if they don't make that transition to GTK3 and things stop working and I actively

06:29.800 --> 06:33.360
have problems, then I will have to move to something else.

06:33.360 --> 06:37.880
And I was looking at possibly Plasma and there's a lot of innovation there.

06:37.880 --> 06:40.760
It is a very attractive proposition.

06:40.760 --> 06:43.440
And I am going to look around, obviously, at that point.

06:43.440 --> 06:47.080
But to be honest, it's as if I've got Ubuntu MATE in the bank.

06:47.080 --> 06:49.560
It's like, well, I've got that, that's safe.

06:49.560 --> 06:54.600
And if I can't find anything else, then I will default to that as the thing that I will

06:54.600 --> 06:55.600
move to.

06:55.600 --> 06:56.600
That's funny.

06:56.600 --> 06:58.120
That's really similar to my situation right now.

06:58.120 --> 07:01.720
I can see myself trending and I'll tell you why I think I see myself trending towards

07:01.720 --> 07:02.880
Ubuntu MATE.

07:02.880 --> 07:08.280
If they've nailed it down this well in 17.10, imagine how good it's going to be for 18.04

07:08.280 --> 07:09.760
with the LTS release.

07:09.760 --> 07:10.760
Yeah.

07:10.760 --> 07:14.200
I feel like I'm going to end up there, but in the meantime, I'm looking around and I'll

07:14.200 --> 07:18.240
say this, give it a full development cycle.

07:18.240 --> 07:20.280
So don't make your big switch yet.

07:20.280 --> 07:26.560
But when Ubuntu MATE 17.10 ships, if you are in love with your Unity 7 desktop, consider

07:26.560 --> 07:32.840
giving it a spin because not only is it really dang close right now, but obviously the project

07:32.840 --> 07:36.480
has a goal here and they're going to keep iterating on this and they're just going to

07:36.480 --> 07:37.980
keep making it better and better.

07:37.980 --> 07:43.320
And that's unfortunately something your Unity 7 desktop now lacks.

07:43.320 --> 07:48.360
I'm so glad that I never got involved with having to use Unity and stuff.

07:48.360 --> 07:54.600
I went to XFCE probably about two years before that whole Unity thing happened and I was

07:54.600 --> 07:59.720
just sitting there, everyone's stressing about this and I'm just sitting here using XFCE.

07:59.720 --> 08:00.720
Eating popcorn.

08:00.720 --> 08:04.560
You know who else was just sitting back eating popcorn is Fedora users.

08:04.560 --> 08:11.580
And we have a tweet from Matt Diem, the guy that runs the Fedora project, and this looks

08:11.580 --> 08:13.840
really positive for the new Fedora release.

08:13.840 --> 08:19.760
Yeah, it's early days, so we don't know exactly how they're doing, but from the numbers, it's

08:19.760 --> 08:24.320
not exact numbers, it's relative numbers to the other releases, it's looking really good

08:24.320 --> 08:26.540
for Fedora 26.

08:26.540 --> 08:30.960
It looks like, I don't know, is it speculation to say that maybe there's some Ubuntu users

08:30.960 --> 08:36.080
who are thinking, well, if I'm forced to go to GNOME, then maybe I'll check out some other

08:36.080 --> 08:37.480
distros that are running it.

08:37.480 --> 08:41.480
I could throw a little more anecdotal evidence your way if you want.

08:41.480 --> 08:47.440
I have received more so than any Fedora release in recent memory, feedback from Fedora users

08:47.440 --> 08:50.840
who said they're making the upgrade right away to 26.

08:50.840 --> 08:54.600
I don't know if I've heard from many folks that have made the switch, but I'm definitely

08:54.600 --> 08:58.520
hearing from folks that are existing Fedora users jumping into this one.

08:58.520 --> 09:04.200
I feel like my experience with Fedora upgrades for the last three or four release cycles,

09:04.200 --> 09:09.600
which has been near problem-free, is representative of what a lot of other people's experience

09:09.600 --> 09:10.600
has been.

09:10.600 --> 09:14.560
Well, isn't that because Fedora are not making any massive changes?

09:14.560 --> 09:20.840
It's just incremental improvements, and it's just kind of upgrading the packages, upgrading

09:20.840 --> 09:25.260
the kernel, and a few little features here and there, but there's nothing major.

09:25.260 --> 09:27.720
There's no moving from one desktop to another.

09:27.720 --> 09:31.880
There's no GTK2 to GTK3 stuff.

09:31.880 --> 09:36.600
If you're using 25 and you go to 26, it's going to be slightly newer, and it's going

09:36.600 --> 09:37.960
to work just as well.

09:37.960 --> 09:39.560
Yeah, I suppose that might be right.

09:39.560 --> 09:43.480
It feels to me that because the Fedora project is working on such crazy future stuff right

09:43.480 --> 09:48.360
now that that's unfair to them, but in reality, if you just look at the distro that we know

09:48.360 --> 09:52.400
and love today, the Fedora that we think of today, yeah, I suppose it has just been iterative

09:52.400 --> 09:53.400
updates.

09:53.400 --> 09:58.000
But where the project is going, Fedora might not look anything like it does today.

09:58.000 --> 10:03.680
And one of those is Voltron, the modular server preview by the Fedora community.

10:03.680 --> 10:07.000
When I was talking with Matthew Miller on Linux Unplugged about where the Fedora project

10:07.000 --> 10:11.660
is going with this, it sounds like they're trying to address the issue of upgrading individual

10:11.660 --> 10:16.840
components or installing newer parts of the system without affecting the rest of your

10:16.840 --> 10:17.840
Fedora system.

10:17.840 --> 10:21.840
So you essentially can virtualize out certain package sets and repos.

10:21.840 --> 10:24.000
Surely they should just be using snaps, shouldn't they?

10:24.000 --> 10:25.800
Yeah, or flat packs, I suppose.

10:25.800 --> 10:28.720
I think they're trying to address it at the package manager level.

10:28.720 --> 10:32.040
There's still efforts going on there to make this work right.

10:32.040 --> 10:36.120
And as a result, they're kind of building some new tools, and they're kind of improving

10:36.120 --> 10:37.640
some existing tools.

10:37.640 --> 10:41.720
So this seems like it could just overall bring up the quality of the Fedora project.

10:41.720 --> 10:47.760
Well, when I spoke to Matthew last, he wasn't very keen on snaps because it's very Ubuntu

10:47.760 --> 10:48.760
specific.

10:48.760 --> 10:49.880
You have to have the Ubuntu runtimes.

10:49.880 --> 10:53.160
And so it's not a surprise really that they're working on their own.

10:53.160 --> 10:57.040
Well, I mean, the flat pack is more for the desktop, isn't it?

10:57.040 --> 11:00.200
And whereas Boltron is very much server focused.

11:00.200 --> 11:05.720
So you can see why they don't want to just say, okay, let's submit, I suppose, and let's

11:05.720 --> 11:07.840
just accept that we're using snaps.

11:07.840 --> 11:09.440
They're doing their own thing as well.

11:09.440 --> 11:14.080
And what's probably going to end up happening, this is Linux, this is open source, you're

11:14.080 --> 11:18.340
never going to have one thing, are you always going to have a few competing technologies.

11:18.340 --> 11:21.960
And ultimately, that's probably going to be good, because you're going to have different

11:21.960 --> 11:23.240
options there.

11:23.240 --> 11:27.600
You can either do it the Boltron way, or you can do it the canonical way with snaps.

11:27.600 --> 11:33.240
I suppose if I had the option, I would prefer to have a sanctioned Fedora packaged version

11:33.240 --> 11:38.920
of PHP, NGINX, or Ruby, or whatever that I install via DNF, and then just update via

11:38.920 --> 11:39.920
DNF.

11:39.920 --> 11:45.760
Having to install a flat pack or a snap and all of that is a lot of extra stuff just to

11:45.760 --> 11:48.200
have a specific version of NGINX.

11:48.200 --> 11:51.000
So I think Boltron could really have something to offer here.

11:51.000 --> 11:55.360
And we may find as this develops further that it's more nuanced and they don't quite solve

11:55.360 --> 11:56.360
the same problems.

11:56.360 --> 12:00.080
Because in the back of my head, I'm combining this with other initiatives they have like

12:00.080 --> 12:04.460
Fedora Atomic, where they're using OSTree to do snapshots, then they're working on a

12:04.460 --> 12:06.160
workstation version of that too, Joe.

12:06.160 --> 12:10.040
So you take an entire snapshot of either the server or the workstation before an update,

12:10.040 --> 12:11.840
and then you make a hard switch.

12:11.840 --> 12:15.560
And if something breaks, you can just go right back to the version that worked fine.

12:15.560 --> 12:21.240
And that would be really nice on like a workstation class machine in a corporate environment.

12:21.240 --> 12:26.080
So I could see them really kind of combining a bunch of different features and making Fedora

12:26.080 --> 12:30.560
attractive for both server workloads and desktop workstation workloads.

12:30.560 --> 12:36.760
Yeah, and I suppose you could say that another organization and company that are making that

12:36.760 --> 12:38.880
easy is SUSE.

12:38.880 --> 12:44.160
And they've gone down the B2FS or ButterFS route to make that happen with the snapshots

12:44.160 --> 12:45.560
and everything.

12:45.560 --> 12:50.720
And OpenSUSE Leap 42.3 has been released.

12:50.720 --> 12:55.320
And it's bringing it more in line with SLE, SUSE Linux Enterprise.

12:55.320 --> 12:58.160
Is it fair to say it's basically the same at this point?

12:58.160 --> 13:02.960
Yeah, it's essentially SUSE Linux Enterprise 12 Service Pack 3.

13:02.960 --> 13:07.520
And then they've identified a few areas where they've deviated from the base system.

13:07.520 --> 13:11.800
So they avoid major version updates in the base system and in the desktop through this

13:11.800 --> 13:12.800
whole update.

13:12.800 --> 13:16.960
So it's really a pretty consistent, rather unadventurous matter, as they put it.

13:16.960 --> 13:23.240
So don't picture this as like a huge, big leap forward because we're talking it's Plasma

13:23.240 --> 13:29.680
Desktop 5.8 long-term support version, which is the default desktop, Gnome 3.20, which

13:29.680 --> 13:33.320
is exactly the same one that's used by the SUSE Linux Enterprise that it's based on.

13:33.320 --> 13:38.140
So yeah, Joe, I'd say if you know what you're getting with SUSE Linux Enterprise 12 Service

13:38.140 --> 13:41.320
Pack 3, then you know what you're getting with OpenSUSE Leap 42.3.

13:41.320 --> 13:46.280
Yeah, the fact is that SUSE Linux Enterprise, well, the clue's in the name.

13:46.280 --> 13:52.720
It's an enterprise distro and it feels like OpenSUSE is drifting more towards that.

13:52.720 --> 13:55.840
And to me, that makes it not that exciting.

13:55.840 --> 14:02.160
I don't know, I hate to admit that, but I mean, even their version numbers, 42.3, it's

14:02.160 --> 14:05.360
not something that's going to grab headlines, is it?

14:05.360 --> 14:10.480
And to me, it just seems like a solid distro that in reality, I'm probably never going

14:10.480 --> 14:11.480
to use.

14:11.480 --> 14:13.520
I suppose I kind of agree.

14:13.520 --> 14:17.720
I think it's exactly what it needs to be for the market it's going after.

14:17.720 --> 14:20.840
And I think that's why they go out of their way to say it's a rather unadventurous matter

14:20.840 --> 14:26.840
because they're trying to tell you this is a safe, stable way to use OpenSUSE so that

14:26.840 --> 14:28.960
you can use in the enterprise.

14:28.960 --> 14:33.360
I wonder if this will be successful because you combine this with their tumbleweed initiative

14:33.360 --> 14:37.720
and then you can kind of, you can choose whichever side of the spectrum fits you better where

14:37.720 --> 14:41.760
you can go a little more rolling or you can go way more enterprise.

14:41.760 --> 14:48.120
I think that's a very unique proposition and I think it's got to be leading to growth.

14:48.120 --> 14:54.660
For me, what it comes down to, my background with SUSE is I ran SUSE extensively for years

14:54.660 --> 15:00.240
in a large enterprise as both the desktop and the server.

15:00.240 --> 15:06.800
And then I've stayed current with OpenSUSE over the years on and off testing it.

15:06.800 --> 15:09.760
And I found it to be pretty good distribution.

15:09.760 --> 15:12.120
It doesn't really work for me though with Yast.

15:12.120 --> 15:16.600
I'm actually not a big fan of Yast and all of the files it touches and how slow it is.

15:16.600 --> 15:18.840
And I'm also not the largest fan of ButterFS.

15:18.840 --> 15:23.920
And back when I originally used SUSE, they were huge proponents of RiserFS.

15:23.920 --> 15:30.240
And so as it being the default and I was installing that distribution for the support, I put RiserFS

15:30.240 --> 15:31.240
on everything.

15:31.240 --> 15:36.300
And then Hans had to go murder his wife and the Linux community completely abandoned RiserFS.

15:36.300 --> 15:39.960
And of course, SUSE kept on shipping it, kept on leaving it as default, kept on, kept on,

15:39.960 --> 15:45.640
kept on until one day we were moving to XFS and I was left with all of my file servers

15:45.640 --> 15:47.100
having to be converted.

15:47.100 --> 15:50.260
And then it's funny to see that repeat itself now with ButterFS.

15:50.260 --> 15:55.880
So for me, that combined with the changes to the package manager over the years, which

15:55.880 --> 15:59.440
seems to be a really great package manager now, but of course, I've been around since

15:59.440 --> 16:04.280
the early days when I was using red carpet to manage software on OpenSUSE boxes.

16:04.280 --> 16:08.920
So I've really been there for a lot of transitions and they just kind of lost me the third or

16:08.920 --> 16:12.400
fourth time they sort of changed the package manager out.

16:12.400 --> 16:17.920
And so I don't ever see myself using it either because it's just too different of a Linux

16:17.920 --> 16:19.160
distribution for me.

16:19.160 --> 16:22.840
But I can watch it from afar and go, I love the two different approaches, rolling and

16:22.840 --> 16:23.840
stable.

16:23.840 --> 16:30.100
I think OBS and also where you can remix a box is the build service and whatnot is all

16:30.100 --> 16:33.640
of that is really a nice asset to the community.

16:33.640 --> 16:41.960
So they seem to have some great stuff, but like you, not ever really gonna run it myself.

16:41.960 --> 16:45.860
Last.ting.com, thank you to Ting for sponsoring Linux Action News and thanks to everybody

16:45.860 --> 16:52.960
for visiting last.ting.com where they'll take $25 off your first Ting device or if you bring

16:52.960 --> 16:58.100
one, check their BYOD page, they'll give you $25 in service credit.

16:58.100 --> 17:03.760
The average Ting bill is just $23 per phone per month.

17:03.760 --> 17:09.120
It's really simple, $6 for the line and then you just pay for your minutes, your messages

17:09.120 --> 17:10.240
and your megabytes.

17:10.240 --> 17:12.860
No contract, no early termination fee.

17:12.860 --> 17:18.920
You can bring a device, they have a GSM or CDMA network or you can buy one from them.

17:18.920 --> 17:21.240
No crazy software pre-installed.

17:21.240 --> 17:26.800
It's really a nice system, everything you'd expect nationwide coverage.

17:26.800 --> 17:29.700
People love Ting and you will too.

17:29.700 --> 17:34.480
Go to last.ting.com and by the way, just a quick tip, if you share a video telling Ting

17:34.480 --> 17:41.520
why they're a great fit for your family, you could win one of five Moto E4 Ss and $250

17:41.520 --> 17:43.720
in Ting credit which would last you a long time.

17:43.720 --> 17:47.840
You can find out more on their Twitter page, at Ting FTW or their blog.

17:47.840 --> 17:50.520
Just do me a favor and start by going to last.ting.com.

17:50.520 --> 17:59.160
Right Chris, we have to talk about Flash, there's no other way about it.

17:59.160 --> 18:03.160
Even though it's not really Linux related, even though you can kind of run it on Linux,

18:03.160 --> 18:08.120
even though you probably shouldn't, it's been the biggest news story of the week in tech

18:08.120 --> 18:09.120
generally.

18:09.120 --> 18:11.520
So I think we have to at least cover it a little bit.

18:11.520 --> 18:13.200
Every Linux user cares too.

18:13.200 --> 18:14.200
Yeah.

18:14.200 --> 18:19.400
So Adobe announced that Flash will die at the end of 2020.

18:19.400 --> 18:26.480
That is three and a half-ish years away, which to me seems a reasonable amount of time.

18:26.480 --> 18:31.040
All too often Google will just dump something and give you a few weeks notice or a few months

18:31.040 --> 18:32.040
notice.

18:32.040 --> 18:36.500
I think this is the responsible way for Adobe to do it, for them to accept defeat, but say

18:36.500 --> 18:40.420
that they're going to keep doing security patches and even features as needed.

18:40.420 --> 18:43.480
They said, I don't think there's going to be too many of them coming, but you never

18:43.480 --> 18:44.760
know.

18:44.760 --> 18:48.560
And they are going to encourage people to move to open standards.

18:48.560 --> 18:54.400
It's funny how they twisted the words in the announcement to say that they've always embraced

18:54.400 --> 18:55.400
open standards.

18:55.400 --> 18:56.400
Well, yeah.

18:56.400 --> 18:57.400
Okay.

18:57.400 --> 18:58.400
Adobe.

18:58.400 --> 18:59.400
Yeah.

18:59.400 --> 19:00.400
Nice one for that.

19:00.400 --> 19:04.000
The hype, I guess, positioning, you might say, the well positioning of open standards

19:04.000 --> 19:10.440
like HTML5, WebGL, and WebAssembly features, I think strongly in this blog post and for

19:10.440 --> 19:16.080
a long time Linux user, it's really something to see Adobe promoting HTML5, WebAssembly,

19:16.080 --> 19:18.360
and WebGL and saying they're killing Flash.

19:18.360 --> 19:22.720
Like that's a weird thing to be reading as a Linux user on Adobe's web page.

19:22.720 --> 19:23.720
Yeah.

19:23.720 --> 19:25.680
I've never been a massive fan of Adobe, I must say.

19:25.680 --> 19:32.280
Photoshop's pretty good until it got really bloated, but I've never liked them as a company,

19:32.280 --> 19:34.200
whereas this, I can't fault it.

19:34.200 --> 19:38.360
They are accepting defeat, they're giving plenty of time for people to move over, and

19:38.360 --> 19:41.400
they're promoting open standards at the same time.

19:41.400 --> 19:43.280
We're living in a topsy turvy world again.

19:43.280 --> 19:44.280
Yeah.

19:44.280 --> 19:47.120
The only thing I would ask for is maybe if they could have done this five years ago.

19:47.120 --> 19:50.120
But other than that, it's actually a pretty good move.

19:50.120 --> 19:51.120
Yeah.

19:51.120 --> 19:57.280
And if they could give us a tool to convert SWF files into an open standard, that would

19:57.280 --> 19:58.280
be nice as well.

19:58.280 --> 19:59.660
Oh, an open standard.

19:59.660 --> 20:00.760
Who needs that, Joe?

20:00.760 --> 20:02.480
Just let Flash die.

20:02.480 --> 20:03.480
Its time came.

20:03.480 --> 20:04.940
It had its reign.

20:04.940 --> 20:06.360
It's time to move on.

20:06.360 --> 20:09.260
Let's all just let Flash pass gracefully.

20:09.260 --> 20:14.740
But what about all the old animations, the old games, and more importantly, the old educational

20:14.740 --> 20:21.720
resources that were made in Flash and are still relevant and still being used by people?

20:21.720 --> 20:26.480
Oh, those new market opportunities for developers to come along and rewrite it in WebAssembly

20:26.480 --> 20:27.480
and WebGL.

20:27.480 --> 20:28.480
You were talking about that.

20:28.480 --> 20:29.480
Yeah.

20:29.480 --> 20:33.080
Well, yeah, it's always good to create work for the tech industry.

20:33.080 --> 20:37.400
I'm not going to complain about that, but the reality is that a lot of that content

20:37.400 --> 20:39.120
is just going to be left to rot.

20:39.120 --> 20:40.120
There is that.

20:40.120 --> 20:45.760
Perhaps, that is the motivation behind a petition to open source the Flash spec.

20:45.760 --> 20:47.180
Yeah, you knew this was coming.

20:47.180 --> 20:48.840
You could hear me teasing.

20:48.840 --> 20:53.080
This is a petition that says, hey Adobe, why not open source the Flash spec?

20:53.080 --> 20:57.240
It'd be good for everyone and it would be a good solution to keep Flash projects alive

20:57.240 --> 21:00.540
and safely archived for many reasons.

21:00.540 --> 21:04.640
We don't know how this is going to be done, they say, but that's the beauty of open source.

21:04.640 --> 21:09.120
Well, I would imagine that the higher ups at Adobe thought, yeah, that's a great idea.

21:09.120 --> 21:10.920
Let's have a quick look at the source code.

21:10.920 --> 21:13.480
Oh, no, no.

21:13.480 --> 21:17.080
Well, you see, Joe, you don't have to worry.

21:17.080 --> 21:22.120
The open source community is full of magical unicorns because this petition, quote, right

21:22.120 --> 21:27.280
from their page here, we understand that there are licensed components that you cannot release.

21:27.280 --> 21:30.540
Simply leave them out with a note explaining what was removed.

21:30.540 --> 21:35.720
We'll either bypass them or replace them with open source alternatives, comma, using our

21:35.720 --> 21:37.120
magic pony dust.

21:37.120 --> 21:39.320
They didn't put that part, but I think that was a typo.

21:39.320 --> 21:43.120
Yeah, and more importantly, what about all the comments that say, this is an ugly hack,

21:43.120 --> 21:44.920
but it kind of works, so let's leave it in.

21:44.920 --> 21:47.640
I want the comments to say, this should screw over Silverlight.

21:47.640 --> 21:48.640
Yeah, exactly.

21:48.640 --> 21:55.760
Yeah, I don't know if this petition is going to go far, but it seems very optimistic.

21:55.760 --> 22:00.560
It's also up on GitHub with a whole outlay of different references and discussion points

22:00.560 --> 22:05.120
and pointing out that Flash is an art medium.

22:05.120 --> 22:08.240
I make fun, but there is some seriousness to some of this.

22:08.240 --> 22:10.440
There are things that would be nice to be able to say.

22:10.440 --> 22:13.800
Toss up on archive.org and run in 10 years.

22:13.800 --> 22:20.080
Well, I read through the Newgrounds post on this, and Newgrounds, to me, you think Flash,

22:20.080 --> 22:22.360
you think Newgrounds, right?

22:22.360 --> 22:26.520
Or at least traditionally, I have all the animations and games and stuff on there.

22:26.520 --> 22:29.960
And they've basically said, well, we haven't really been using Flash for about 10 years

22:29.960 --> 22:33.760
at this point, and we're not really bothered by this.

22:33.760 --> 22:37.960
So I don't think it's as big a deal as some people would make out.

22:37.960 --> 22:41.120
But in terms of open sourcing it, I think that is just dreaming.

22:41.120 --> 22:47.560
And I think that the best case scenario here is Adobe is going to release a free as in

22:47.560 --> 22:54.760
bare but locked down proprietary tool that will convert your SWF file into something

22:54.760 --> 22:58.400
that is vaguely usable with open standards.

22:58.400 --> 23:04.360
Hmm, that would actually be a decent compromise, because in some sense, if we had an open source

23:04.360 --> 23:06.520
Flash, it may never go away.

23:06.520 --> 23:10.720
Well, we've already got one of them, Gnash and all that kind of stuff.

23:10.720 --> 23:14.040
Yeah, this is a good time for everybody to go double down on Gnash.

23:14.040 --> 23:17.160
Yeah, we just want it to go away, don't we, at the end of the day.

23:17.160 --> 23:20.880
And probably you're right, open sourcing it is just going to prolong that agony and just

23:20.880 --> 23:22.640
make it never truly go away.

23:22.640 --> 23:28.360
But I think that even if it was open sourced, it doesn't have to go away to go away, if

23:28.360 --> 23:29.360
you know what I mean.

23:29.360 --> 23:32.400
All it takes is the major browsers to stop supporting it, and then it's effectively gone

23:32.400 --> 23:33.880
away anyway.

23:33.880 --> 23:34.880
That's very true.

23:34.880 --> 23:39.120
The Debian projects probably isn't too concerned with all of this Flash nonsense, but they

23:39.120 --> 23:42.200
are a bit more concerned with reproducible builds.

23:42.200 --> 23:47.260
Yeah, so when I first got interested in open source, one of the first things that occurred

23:47.260 --> 23:50.880
to me was, okay, so we've got all this source code.

23:50.880 --> 23:54.440
And then I learned, okay, so that a lot of it has to be compiled into binaries.

23:54.440 --> 23:59.720
And it's like, well, how do I know that that binary is made from the source code and doesn't

23:59.720 --> 24:03.540
have a few backdoors slipped in or some extra code?

24:03.540 --> 24:07.400
And given the different compilers that people are using, the different systems they're running

24:07.400 --> 24:15.360
it on, you traditionally, and even in a lot of cases now, you can't produce a binary that

24:15.360 --> 24:20.880
is exactly the same, that has the same hash as the one that you're sucking down from your

24:20.880 --> 24:21.880
package manager.

24:21.880 --> 24:27.440
I wonder if this is even more of a concern in the Linux community where you have distros

24:27.440 --> 24:32.240
that are re-spinning and they're using packages from an upstream distribution, but you never

24:32.240 --> 24:36.220
really know what they're doing when they're re-spinning their desktop wallpaper.

24:36.220 --> 24:40.480
They could be including different versions of the applications than what say Debian has

24:40.480 --> 24:43.640
in their official repository and you wouldn't know.

24:43.640 --> 24:48.560
Well, put it this way, I'm not going to lose any sleep over it, but at the same time, if

24:48.560 --> 24:55.600
I know that you've got a reproducible build that you can have exact same binaries as it

24:55.600 --> 25:00.120
should be, I might sleep that little bit better at night, put it that way.

25:00.120 --> 25:01.120
I agree.

25:01.120 --> 25:05.160
So something interesting that developed this week was a post over at lwn.net that we'll

25:05.160 --> 25:06.160
have linked in the show notes.

25:06.160 --> 25:10.080
I think it was from the mailing list, so it's kind of a nice readable format.

25:10.080 --> 25:14.080
I didn't realize this, but the efforts that we've been hearing going on in other Linux

25:14.080 --> 25:20.880
distributions like Arch and Fedora and OpenSUSE and Tails, these are all in coordination

25:20.880 --> 25:24.920
with the Debian reproducible builds project and they've set up a cross communications

25:24.920 --> 25:31.800
and support project agnostic namespace at reproducible-builds.org.

25:31.800 --> 25:35.040
So this is a real community effort that's developing here.

25:35.040 --> 25:40.040
Yeah, and on the Debian side of things, if you look at the architecture that most people

25:40.040 --> 25:47.000
are actually interested in, which is the MD64, 94% of the packages available for Debian are

25:47.000 --> 25:50.280
reproducible at this point, which is virtually all of them.

25:50.280 --> 25:51.680
That is a big step.

25:51.680 --> 25:53.320
That is huge.

25:53.320 --> 25:56.680
That really makes me sleep soundly, put it that way.

25:56.680 --> 26:01.080
I think they are trying to raise awareness, though, because there are some projects where

26:01.080 --> 26:05.560
they filed bugs saying we need this or that fix to be reproducible and it's just kind

26:05.560 --> 26:08.500
of sat there for a couple of years now.

26:08.500 --> 26:12.520
So they are trying to raise awareness that we need a little bit of help from the maintainer

26:12.520 --> 26:14.160
side to get this all working.

26:14.160 --> 26:17.960
Well, I think that if anyone is going to coordinate something like this, Debian seems to be a

26:17.960 --> 26:19.800
very good project to do it.

26:19.800 --> 26:22.400
Yeah, and the effort seems to be a worthwhile effort, too.

26:22.400 --> 26:23.400
So it's nice to see.

26:23.400 --> 26:27.840
It looks like FreeBSD and NetBSD are also getting in on the fun.

26:27.840 --> 26:29.040
So that's kind of pretty cool to see.

26:29.040 --> 26:33.040
Yeah, I wonder if the BSD Now guys are going to talk about this and accept that they're

26:33.040 --> 26:35.600
getting help from Debian and Linux.

26:35.600 --> 26:37.680
I wouldn't bank on it.

26:37.680 --> 26:41.680
So we do have an update on a story we touched on briefly in the past.

26:41.680 --> 26:46.480
Mozilla has an initiative underway to bring voice recognition to the masses.

26:46.480 --> 26:50.840
And I wanted to just talk about Common Voice for a moment because they touch on something

26:50.840 --> 26:53.440
that I don't know if gets a lot of consideration.

26:53.440 --> 26:58.520
Common Voice, if you recall, is a project to sort of open source voice recognition or

26:58.520 --> 27:02.680
at least make voice recognition available to the web.

27:02.680 --> 27:05.200
And they frame this in a really interesting way.

27:05.200 --> 27:09.840
They talk about today's speech recognition technologies largely being tied up into just

27:09.840 --> 27:12.840
a few companies that have really heavily invested in them.

27:12.840 --> 27:18.120
And that's essentially down to Google, AT&T, IBM, and Nuance.

27:18.120 --> 27:21.960
And if you want something outside the browser, you essentially license it from one of those

27:21.960 --> 27:22.960
companies.

27:22.960 --> 27:27.860
And like in the case of Nuance, you can actually pay up to a penny per invocation.

27:27.860 --> 27:34.200
So that means, say, you're Mycroft or whatever, and you're using Nuance, and your users are

27:34.200 --> 27:37.840
sending you $0.01 per query.

27:37.840 --> 27:42.520
So per time, they say, hey, Mycroft, what is beans or whatever.

27:42.520 --> 27:45.880
That's going to add up really, really quickly.

27:45.880 --> 27:49.120
That's going to be hundreds of thousands, if not millions of dollars before you've even

27:49.120 --> 27:50.120
realized.

27:50.120 --> 27:51.120
Yep.

27:51.120 --> 27:52.120
Absolutely.

27:52.120 --> 27:55.440
And so Mozilla's point here is this is becoming a much more common way to interact with our

27:55.440 --> 27:56.600
devices.

27:56.600 --> 28:02.120
And soon, users, and maybe already, will have expectations of interacting with the web that

28:02.120 --> 28:03.120
way.

28:03.120 --> 28:04.120
I don't know if that's true or not.

28:04.120 --> 28:05.120
I don't really see it.

28:05.120 --> 28:08.960
My kids, who are not the greatest spellers yet, because they're very young, they're actually

28:08.960 --> 28:09.960
getting pretty good.

28:09.960 --> 28:14.120
And one of the ways that they get around the web is by using voice dictation, because they

28:14.120 --> 28:15.280
have no problem with that.

28:15.280 --> 28:18.800
They hit the button, they tell the thing what they want, and boom, they've got it.

28:18.800 --> 28:24.280
And I could see that really becoming big in education spaces and in all kinds of usability

28:24.280 --> 28:25.280
scenarios.

28:25.280 --> 28:30.680
So there is probably a legitimate need for some sort of opening up of speech on the web.

28:30.680 --> 28:32.980
And Mozilla's got to be the company to do it.

28:32.980 --> 28:35.920
But it feels like a big uphill battle.

28:35.920 --> 28:41.120
And they're trying to rally other browser companies to support a common web speech API,

28:41.120 --> 28:46.440
which is a W3C community group specification that would allow developers to write speech-driven

28:46.440 --> 28:49.000
interfaces that would use this service.

28:49.000 --> 28:53.120
So it would sort of open this up, make a more competitive market.

28:53.120 --> 28:56.080
The thing is, this is a very expensive thing to do.

28:56.080 --> 29:01.640
But at the same time, they're crowdsourcing a lot of the audio content that they need.

29:01.640 --> 29:07.840
And I've been doing 20 minutes here and there of verifying the various things that people

29:07.840 --> 29:09.080
have read in.

29:09.080 --> 29:11.680
And I've donated my voice as well to it.

29:11.680 --> 29:14.440
So they've got the community side of things, to some extent.

29:14.440 --> 29:18.880
But the resources that they need, let's face it, they've got Yahoo billions, or at least

29:18.880 --> 29:21.160
millions to play with.

29:21.160 --> 29:26.880
And we've talked many times about how Firefox is not doing massively well and Thunderbird

29:26.880 --> 29:29.160
they've basically dumped at this point.

29:29.160 --> 29:32.720
So it's not like they don't have the resources to do this.

29:32.720 --> 29:37.400
And I think that if this really is the future, I'm a bit curmudgeonly about this.

29:37.400 --> 29:38.400
I'm not seeing it.

29:38.400 --> 29:43.160
I know you've wholeheartedly embraced it with Alexa and all that kind of stuff and Siri

29:43.160 --> 29:44.160
on your phone.

29:44.160 --> 29:48.920
But if this is the future, then Mozilla needs to be part of that.

29:48.920 --> 29:55.880
Because say what you will about them, they do want to drive openness.

29:55.880 --> 30:00.960
Their solution to everything is the web, which, OK, well, maybe this is the right thing to

30:00.960 --> 30:04.000
do with a web API.

30:04.000 --> 30:05.000
I don't know.

30:05.000 --> 30:06.440
I'm not 100% convinced about that.

30:06.440 --> 30:08.400
They seem like the right company to do that, though.

30:08.400 --> 30:09.400
Yeah.

30:09.400 --> 30:12.240
Either way, I'm glad that they're involved with this.

30:12.240 --> 30:18.400
Because I trust them more than I trust Google or Apple or Microsoft or Amazon.

30:18.400 --> 30:22.520
I don't know if it's the future, but I do think it's going to become definitely another

30:22.520 --> 30:24.200
primary input method.

30:24.200 --> 30:26.840
Just sort of like Touch didn't replace the keyboard or mouse, same thing.

30:26.840 --> 30:30.640
I don't think Voice is going to replace anything, but it's going to definitely supplement input.

30:30.640 --> 30:31.640
But we'll have to see.

30:31.640 --> 30:34.140
And hopefully, this is an area where Mozilla can do some real good.

30:34.140 --> 30:36.840
And the place they have the most leverage is the web.

30:36.840 --> 30:39.640
So this seems like a recipe for success.

30:39.640 --> 30:41.560
And I like that they're keeping us updated.

30:41.560 --> 30:45.440
