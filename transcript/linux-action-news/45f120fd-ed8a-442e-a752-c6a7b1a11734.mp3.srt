00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,360
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News.

2
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:09,280
Episode 122, recorded on September 8th, 2019.

3
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:10,280
I'm Chris.

4
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:11,280
And I'm Joe.

5
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:12,280
Hello, Joe.

6
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:13,280
Good to be connected with you.

7
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:15,280
Android 10 starts us off this week.

8
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:18,440
I'm curious, did you pull the trigger on a Pixel device to try it out?

9
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:23,960
I actually looked on eBay, and they're not that expensive, and I was so tempted.

10
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:28,240
But no, I held back, so unfortunately I just had to watch videos and read articles about

11
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:29,240
it.

12
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:32,880
It's a lot to consume, and we have links to some of the best in the show notes, but there's

13
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:36,120
a few details that I guess you and I could talk about.

14
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:41,120
Mostly, it's worth, I suppose, mentioning the elephant in the room right at the beginning.

15
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:44,740
There's a handful of devices that are gonna get the new Android 10.

16
00:00:44,740 --> 00:00:52,640
Pixel devices, a couple other premium OEM devices, but a lot, and I mean most, of the

17
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:55,840
handsets may never get Android 10.

18
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:56,920
But it is rolling out.

19
00:00:56,920 --> 00:01:00,800
Most Pixel users have been able to try it in beta, which I've been using it for a long

20
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:04,320
time in beta, and I would imagine I must have the final update right now.

21
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:05,320
I just haven't checked.

22
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:11,840
And there's so many things in here, Joe, that I think both represent a lot of change for

23
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:16,680
Android, but also make it maybe my favorite Android release ever.

24
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:23,620
I know that sounds super enthusiastic, but there's legitimately good features that protect

25
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:28,360
privacy that have been missing from Android that are finally here in Android 10.

26
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:33,340
Well, like being able to grant an app permission to use your location, but only when you're

27
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:36,200
using the app and not when it's running in the background.

28
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:40,440
That just seems to be such a basic thing that you would have expected a long time ago, but

29
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:44,880
I suppose, well, at least we've got it now for those few phones that do have Android

30
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:45,880
10.

31
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:50,760
Also, a really nice addition, apps will not be able to access the unchangeable device

32
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:56,820
identifiers, which are things like your IEMI, things that you don't really want leaked out

33
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:59,120
there are blocked now.

34
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:02,800
There's no longer the possibility for apps to silently start and run in the background

35
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:03,800
anymore.

36
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:06,320
They will have to pop up a notification saying they're running.

37
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:09,320
Could be kind of annoying, could be great though.

38
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:16,080
Wi-Fi information is more restricted to the apps, and they're also working on required

39
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:21,000
encrypted storage, as well as other small tweaks that I think are just nice to see that

40
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,160
make it more approachable for human beings, which is always nice.

41
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:29,160
Google's adjusted where all of this stuff is now, so it's all located in one place in

42
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:31,120
the settings called privacy.

43
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,120
It's just really simple.

44
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:36,760
Yeah, it does seem to be simplified, although they have somewhat complicated other aspects

45
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:39,720
of it, like with the digital wellbeing stuff.

46
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:43,480
Now they've got do not disturb as well as this new focus mode.

47
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:50,520
If you're keeping track, there's now like six different ways in current Android to essentially

48
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:51,520
achieve the same thing.

49
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:57,520
You've got do not disturb, focus mode, app timers, which are part of the digital wellbeing

50
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:58,520
suite.

51
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:03,080
Then you have notification priority settings, which suppress some notifications.

52
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:07,360
Then you have channels within notifications, which hide some notifications that are different

53
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:10,880
for different apps, and then you have parental controls, which can lock some of this stuff

54
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:11,880
down too.

55
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:15,400
So you have six different ways to achieve kind of the same thing, but they all offer

56
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:17,240
a different solution.

57
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:24,560
This is the part of Android 10 where I feel like it gives the perpetual beta feeling to

58
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:25,560
Android.

59
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:27,240
Like it always is sort of changing.

60
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:29,200
New things are getting added that are great.

61
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,680
The way to do things gets removed.

62
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:36,000
Something that's obviously needed, like some of these privacy settings gets added.

63
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,680
It doesn't make any particular release feel like it's the release of Android.

64
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:44,520
It's just like another iterative release, which is both good and bad.

65
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:47,760
I would love to just sort of feel like it's iterative polish at this point, but it still

66
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:48,760
feels like fundamentals.

67
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:54,220
Well, a couple of releases ago, they did have a kind of spit and polish release where nothing

68
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:59,520
much changed and they did all the kind of basic under the hood stuff.

69
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:05,840
And so now we're kind of in the next couple of releases where they are adding all the

70
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:10,540
features and then they'll probably slow down again for the next one or maybe the one after

71
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:11,540
that.

72
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:17,000
It's kind of almost like with Ubuntu releases where you've got your interims and your LTSs.

73
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,880
Only with Android, it's not really official.

74
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:19,880
Yeah, it's true.

75
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:20,960
It's a good way to look at it.

76
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:27,720
I think also it sort of leans on the OEM's role in finalizing Android for better or for

77
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:32,860
worse before it goes out to most people, except for those of us on pixels really.

78
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:37,820
And while I can't really eloquently phrase the way I feel about this, I think the end

79
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:39,240
of the Verge review really nailed it.

80
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:40,320
We'll put a link in the show notes.

81
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:44,500
They write Android 10 is not a milestone, it's a mile marker.

82
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:49,240
It has made real progress and is heading in the right direction, but the landscape still

83
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:50,240
looks the same.

84
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:52,580
A lot of phones won't get the updates.

85
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:54,680
Some of the features are sort of conflicting with each other.

86
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:59,520
The new gesture system looks good, but it is lacking like the back button functionality

87
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:04,400
is really weak with the new gesture system just drove me crazy when I used it, but you

88
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:08,240
can see they're almost there like one more iteration and it's going to be pretty good.

89
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:13,040
But at this point, I would love to just see some of these features be nailed, the digital

90
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:18,380
well-being really solid, the touch gestures as good as they are on iOS.

91
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:21,340
Just nail those few things in a release.

92
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:25,960
And yet it's the release I'm probably the most excited about in a long time because

93
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:28,920
of some of these fundamentals they've improved.

94
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:31,180
I feel like Android's getting there now.

95
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:34,800
It's really kind of answering some of those privacy criticisms that I had, at least when

96
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:35,800
it comes to settings.

97
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:38,040
Who really knows what's going on in the background?

98
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:40,320
But at least when it comes to user configuration settings.

99
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:44,640
I'm very surprised that we haven't mentioned dark mode yet, which is something I've had

100
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:47,720
on LineageOS for what feels like years at this point.

101
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:49,920
I was just waiting smugly for you to bring it up.

102
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:52,600
You know, I just want to take my victory lap here.

103
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:56,480
Well, yeah, you did predict that this year was going to be all about dark mode, which

104
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:58,520
I think everyone agreed with.

105
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:04,460
But it seems pretty cool that it will even skin lighter apps that don't have a proper

106
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:05,460
dark mode themselves.

107
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:09,780
It'll just kind of interpret how they should be dark, although it does seem a bit hit and

108
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:10,920
miss at this point.

109
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:14,440
My expectation is that's going to take a little while to sort things out.

110
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:19,240
As far as kind of neat features go, USB port contamination and overheating detection has

111
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:21,760
to be, I think, one of my favorite.

112
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:26,360
This is a feature that will disable the USB port on your phone if it detects liquids or

113
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:28,520
debris in there that could short it out.

114
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:32,720
The Android system will post a notification informing the user that the USB port has been

115
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,640
disabled.

116
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:38,280
Once the USB port is cleaned out and free of any liquid or contaminants, the system

117
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:39,280
will notify the user.

118
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:41,720
It's safe to reinsert accessories.

119
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:46,200
And also, in addition, some of this will vary, though, keep in mind, depending on your OEM

120
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:47,200
implementation.

121
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:51,080
But in addition to this, they have a second feature in there that's been added to Android

122
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:56,680
10 that will advise the user to unplug the cable, the charging cable, from the phone

123
00:06:56,680 --> 00:07:02,440
when the phone starts overheating, which with some of these rando USB-C chargers out there

124
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:04,360
is totally possible.

125
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:09,720
So the system waits until it reaches 60 degrees Celsius, which it considers critical in the

126
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:11,520
battery charging area.

127
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,200
It'll start alerting the user.

128
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:18,200
And then emergency mode is when the system reaches 65 degrees Celsius.

129
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:21,560
I think the biggest feature is a feature that isn't there yet.

130
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:25,700
They've announced it, but it's coming soon to Pixel devices.

131
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:30,400
And that is live caption, which is basically giving you closed captions for everything

132
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,600
on the phone that has got voice.

133
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:38,800
So whether that is videos you're watching, or people you're talking to, or just anything

134
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:43,720
with content that's got voices on it, which is a major accessibility feature, but it's

135
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:49,120
also handy for just if you're on a train or just somewhere in polite company, haven't

136
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:52,800
got your headphones connected, and you want to watch stuff on mute.

137
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:57,080
Also just a couple of honorable mentions, Vulkan everywhere is a pretty big deal that's

138
00:07:57,080 --> 00:08:01,800
going to have longer term ramifications for Android gaming and desktop Linux.

139
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:05,520
That's pretty exciting because a lot of those games will likely get developed on Linux.

140
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:07,320
So I think that gets an honorable mention.

141
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:10,560
And then there's another feature which we don't really know how it's going to play out

142
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:13,480
yet, but it seems to have serious potential.

143
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:20,120
And that is, in a sense, Google has widened what it can patch via play services.

144
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:25,740
And the way they're writing about this is that really important Android zero day type

145
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:31,120
security issues will be pushed automatically via the play API.

146
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:34,440
Basically bypassing the OEM update process.

147
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:36,400
That could be great for Android security.

148
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:39,720
But again, we just kind of have to wait and see how that particular thing shakes out,

149
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:40,720
just like Vulkan.

150
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:45,600
Yeah, that looks like it's only going to be for phones that ship with Android 10, not

151
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,160
ones that get updated to it.

152
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:50,880
So I think it's going to be a while before we actually see that feature properly rolling

153
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:51,880
out.

154
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:54,320
And maybe one last honorable mention.

155
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,320
There's a lot here.

156
00:08:55,320 --> 00:09:00,520
We have really useful links in the show notes at LinuxActionNews.com slash 122.

157
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:06,400
But when you read Google's official developer blog post about Android 10, it is packed full

158
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:13,360
of phrases like on device learning and privacy and encryption and keeping your data secure.

159
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:18,600
There's a lot of things in this post that read like Apple talking points.

160
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:23,920
I think there's a real interesting push and pull happening in privacy right now.

161
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:27,480
And it's clearly changed the way they're thinking about Android.

162
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:29,920
I think this is a good benefit for everybody.

163
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:30,920
I don't know.

164
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:33,600
We'll have to wait and see how genuine some of these statements are.

165
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:37,120
But it's clear that they're getting a signal from the market that people care about this

166
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,120
kind of stuff.

167
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,600
I'll give you an example.

168
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:44,560
Android 10 uses on device machine learning to suggest contextual actions and notification.

169
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:48,580
Quote, keeping the machine learning processing completely on the device.

170
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:52,780
We've built this feature with user privacy in mind.

171
00:09:52,780 --> 00:09:56,360
That's the world's biggest data collection company saying they're shifting to on device

172
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:58,040
local processing.

173
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:00,200
I think that's a big sea change for them.

174
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:03,760
Well, they're certainly trying to project that image of caring about privacy and stuff.

175
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:06,220
So that would tie in with that.

176
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:09,840
How much of that processing is actually going to happen on the phone?

177
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:11,520
I'm a bit skeptical, really.

178
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:12,520
We'll see.

179
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:15,720
Certain devices could have dedicated silicon for this kind of thing.

180
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:17,600
The CPUs on these things are monsters.

181
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,320
They got a ton of memory.

182
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:23,600
I mean, these are better than computers I had as a kid by an order of magnitude.

183
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:24,600
It may be possible.

184
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:25,600
Possibly.

185
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:29,400
But we'll have to wait and see I'm skeptical, as I say.

186
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:32,640
One final honorable mention is the essential phone.

187
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:37,560
And that was updated on release day as well, which I was very surprised that you talked

188
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:38,560
about flagships.

189
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:43,280
I mean, that's getting on a bit now and essential I thought were not doing brilliantly financially

190
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:44,280
and stuff.

191
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:48,560
So I was very surprised to see them shipping Android 10 on release day.

192
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:50,440
Good to see them living up to that brand commitment.

193
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:51,440
That is really nice.

194
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:54,760
Yeah, it kind of does bode well for if they do put another phone out.

195
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:57,720
I think it will be good for consumer confidence there.

196
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:01,520
Well, while we're talking about phones, it's real, Joe.

197
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:06,920
The Pine phone is real and production may be ramping up sooner than a lot of us expected.

198
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:11,200
Well, it's certainly sooner than I thought it'd be shipping because I saw the dev kit

199
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,200
and hands on with it.

200
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:14,440
And that was only a couple of months ago.

201
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:16,840
And the software situation was rough.

202
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:18,920
It was really rough.

203
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:22,320
And Pine 64 had made no bones about that.

204
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:27,640
They said it wasn't ready, but in the last month or so, there have been some serious

205
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:35,520
developments with plasma mobile and Ubuntu touch and things are looking really pretty

206
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:36,520
good.

207
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:41,040
And so I can see why now they've gone into this very early production run where it's

208
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:43,020
only for developers.

209
00:11:43,020 --> 00:11:47,940
The orders that they're taking now, you have to email them and explain why you want it.

210
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:53,900
This isn't for people like me who just want to tinker with it or even app developers.

211
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:57,320
This is for people who are actually working on these mobile systems.

212
00:11:57,320 --> 00:12:01,520
Well, that probably makes a lot of sense considering the rough state it would be in the first initial

213
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:02,520
run.

214
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:07,080
Well, yeah, they don't want to ship something to normal people that isn't ready.

215
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:12,080
They are taking it very kind of gingerly and slowly.

216
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:16,400
And they are completely reliant on the community for the software of this thing, as is their

217
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:17,720
kind of usual style.

218
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:21,240
I do like that they're being upfront about that before they take anyone's money and they're

219
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,240
not making it easy.

220
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:24,420
There's not like a buy now button on their website.

221
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:28,080
You have to contact them, talk about how you're going to contribute.

222
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:30,960
And then they make it clear on their website when the future batches should be available

223
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:37,240
that might be more larger scale, better build that are probably the ones general consumers

224
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:40,240
would want to purchase or tinkerers even.

225
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:42,320
It's good that they caveat it though.

226
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:47,400
They always say like, well, these schedules might slip and we're not making any firm promises,

227
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:50,320
but we expect to be shipping on these dates.

228
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:56,820
And so it's going to be several months before I can buy one, I think, but that might end

229
00:12:56,820 --> 00:12:58,640
up slipping to be a few more months.

230
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:01,280
And they've been completely upfront about that.

231
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:02,760
And I really admire that.

232
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:06,960
The other thing to note is the price is pretty swallable for a phone in this state.

233
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:08,880
It's around $150.

234
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:09,880
That's not bad.

235
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:15,400
Yeah, but you can get a phone with similar specs for significantly less than that because

236
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:17,560
this thing is not exactly a flagship.

237
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:22,920
But given that it's small runs and a small company, $150 for a phone that's running a

238
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:29,360
proper GNU slash Linux based operating system as opposed to Android, I think that it's reasonable.

239
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:35,320
It's the kind of money that you're not going to have to convince your spouse too hard to

240
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:36,320
let you spend.

241
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:37,320
Yeah.

242
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:40,600
And my understanding is, correct me if I'm wrong, they're going to go with Plasma Mobile

243
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:44,800
for the default UI, but I've seen Ubuntu Touch running on this thing.

244
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:45,800
Yeah.

245
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:48,160
And Sailfish OS, there's quite a few different options there.

246
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:53,160
But also in this post, they mentioned the Pinebook Pro and how exactly the kill switches

247
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:54,160
are going to work and everything.

248
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:56,180
So it's well worth having a read about that.

249
00:13:56,180 --> 00:14:00,360
And I'm hoping that I'm going to get my hands on a review unit, which I'm hoping I might

250
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:01,360
get to keep.

251
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:06,520
I'll have to see about that fairly soon within the next few weeks, hopefully.

252
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:08,840
So I'll definitely be reporting back on that.

253
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:09,840
Ooh.

254
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:10,840
Yeah, fingers crossed.

255
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:14,960
Well, the theme of the software releases this week is privacy, and Mozilla has released

256
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:17,200
Firefox 69.

257
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:22,020
Enhanced tracking protection will be turned on by default, as well as blocking autoplay

258
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:24,780
for videos that start playing.

259
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:28,760
Not just the ones with sound, like a lot of those freaking news articles that start, but

260
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:29,760
it's muted.

261
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:30,760
That gets them anything?

262
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:31,760
Yeah.

263
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:32,760
It's blogging that now too.

264
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:35,200
There's just other nice little quality of life things in there.

265
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:37,560
Windows 10 users specifically get a few upgrades.

266
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:39,160
Mac users get a few nice things.

267
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:42,120
But us Linux users, we're happy with our tracking blocking.

268
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:43,120
That's fine.

269
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:44,120
That's good.

270
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:46,940
You know, I'm all Wayland right now with Firefox, Joe, it is smooth.

271
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:48,600
It is smoother than Chrome.

272
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:52,680
There's a few glitches with Chrome, but Firefox on Wayland, smooth.

273
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:57,560
We've had this cookie blocking and crypto mining blocking for a while, but it is important

274
00:14:57,560 --> 00:15:02,040
now that it is default and you know it's working when you get a little shield.

275
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:03,440
That's always reassuring, isn't it?

276
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:04,440
I do like the shield.

277
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:05,440
It's the small things.

278
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:10,600
I'll tell you, you know, there's a, like a esoteric quote unquote change in this version

279
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:16,920
of Firefox that I think shows a genuine depth of which they are thinking about user privacy.

280
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:22,080
They know with the deprecation of Adobe flash player, there's no longer a need to identify

281
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:27,320
users on 32 bit versions of Firefox or 64 bit versions.

282
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:31,440
So they're just taking that aspect out of the user agent to reduce fingerprinting because

283
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:35,120
it's one of the factors, you know, one of the things unique about you, if you're 32

284
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:39,800
bit or 64 bit that they can use, tracking can and they're just going to pull it out

285
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:40,800
because they don't need it.

286
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:41,800
You know what?

287
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:42,800
They don't need it.

288
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:43,800
Yeah, that is a good move.

289
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:47,440
And you can turn on the anti fingerprinting stuff already and they say that they're looking

290
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:52,520
to make it default in the near future, which is good because there was a post on the tour

291
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:58,480
blog this week about fingerprinting and I read it and I'm scared.

292
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:04,560
Quite frankly, I had no idea quite how in depth and easy this stuff was.

293
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:10,880
Yeah, there's all kinds of little ways your system leaks information about you that are

294
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:16,560
obvious in retrospect, like the user ID agent or specific font capabilities that your browser

295
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:18,560
presents that it has.

296
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:24,880
But I think what is happening behind the scenes is this tracking thing is really, really beginning

297
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:26,040
to brew.

298
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:30,880
We're going to see a lot of different things being claimed like Google just recently shot

299
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:36,280
over at Apple for their hardline anti tracking stance, then Apple shot back at them for having

300
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:38,000
no anti tracking.

301
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:42,680
And it's this public back and forth between two giant corporations, of course, at the

302
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:43,680
individual level.

303
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:49,160
And then you also have the industry, the ad industry, quote unquote, the IAB that is working

304
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:55,440
on a universal tracking system that sounds kind of spooky, but they think is really great.

305
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,480
This something here is about to break.

306
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:02,680
I wouldn't be surprised if it doesn't take till 2020, but something here's got to give

307
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:06,120
to tectonic plates that are just really pushing against each other right now.

308
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:10,720
Did you go to my unique.org and see if you're unique with your fingerprint?

309
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:12,000
All right, I'll go right now.

310
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
You ready?

311
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Am I unique.org?

312
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
This is the studio machine.

313
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,440
So this isn't my regular machine.

314
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:18,440
Let's see.

315
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:19,440
I'll view my browser fingerprint.

316
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:20,440
Ah, yeah.

317
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:21,440
Yes, I am.

318
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:22,440
Yeah.

319
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:23,440
So am I.

320
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:32,240
It says, yes, you can be tracked because I'm using Ubuntu version 69, UTC plus one, English,

321
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:35,120
because there's so many different things they can use to fingerprint you.

322
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:39,360
And of over a million samples that they have, I'm unique.

323
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:41,400
So I must be pretty easy to track.

324
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:44,400
Yeah, it's all kinds of things you don't like I said, you don't consider.

325
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:48,100
Does your browser support certain types of compression formats?

326
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:50,200
It can add all of these up.

327
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:52,840
And eventually kind of gets a pretty solid idea.

328
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:56,880
And for what they're going for, I mean, this isn't medical science, right?

329
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:57,880
It's ad tracking science.

330
00:17:57,880 --> 00:18:03,600
So if they get within pretty close, that's good enough for ad work, really.

331
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:04,600
And they get there now.

332
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:11,400
And so it's interesting to see Firefox just making really small adjustments deep down,

333
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:15,600
like taking out the 32 and 64 bit identifier, because, yeah, we don't have to support flash

334
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:16,600
anymore.

335
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:17,600
We don't need this.

336
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:20,400
And just kind of making these low level tweaks over time that are making it harder and harder

337
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,400
to track.

338
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:24,240
And you've got Apple, who's taking that hard line stance.

339
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:28,360
And then you've got Google, who's working with the IAB to try to come up with this universal

340
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:34,900
token that isn't tied to your name, but is unique to you, which would allow you to also

341
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:39,760
universally opt out if everyone used this system and respected that setting.

342
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:41,760
Well, just like do not track, eh?

343
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:44,120
Yeah, just like that.

344
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:51,480
It is really great to see Mozilla taking strides here and taking a lead, really.

345
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:56,120
I know that Apple's kind of doing it as well to some extent, but Mozilla is not being left

346
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:57,480
behind.

347
00:18:57,480 --> 00:19:02,820
And I'm tempted to turn on that anti-fingerprinting, but it does warn you that things will break.

348
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:05,840
So maybe I should just do it and see what happens.

349
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:07,400
Wouldn't be bad to try it for a little while.

350
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:08,400
Yeah.

351
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,200
I've tried NoScript here and there every now and then.

352
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:14,620
Yeah, I think what you see here with Mozilla is a real comprehensive, elegant approach

353
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:16,840
to this that is evolving over time.

354
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:24,140
You've seen Apple take some real sort of swath cuts at some low-hanging fruit and just taking

355
00:19:24,140 --> 00:19:28,680
some hard lines, which is good and sets a bar.

356
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:32,360
But I like Mozilla's approach of just iteratively, over time, finding every little knob they

357
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:33,360
can turn.

358
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:36,360
Yeah, it seems like Mozilla have been doing a lot of good stuff lately, so let's hope

359
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:37,360
they keep it up.

360
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:38,360
Yeah.

361
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:39,360
It feels like they're back on track these days.

362
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:43,880
Well, Red Hat is certainly on track with OpenShift, and they just continue to double down on that.

363
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:50,360
This week, they're releasing their code-ready containers, which, think of them as a minimal,

364
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:56,920
ready-to-go OpenShift 4.1 or potentially newer environment that you can use to develop software

365
00:19:56,920 --> 00:20:01,280
on your local system and then deploy for the cloud.

366
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:05,520
There are some somewhat hefty minimum requirements, to give you an idea of what you're working

367
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:06,520
with here.

368
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:11,680
You'll need four virtual CPUs, eight gigabytes of RAM, and 35 gigabytes of storage.

369
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:17,560
But when you have allocated all of that, you've got an OpenShift cluster that's ready to go

370
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:23,120
for local development in an environment that matches your production OpenShift environment.

371
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:24,520
And this isn't just for Linux.

372
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:28,520
It's using the native hypervisors on macOS and Windows as well.

373
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:29,880
Yeah, that's kind of clever.

374
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:34,520
That's kind of the clever part of this, is it really lets anyone that has an existing

375
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:40,560
investment in any particular desktop system still develop for new systems they're deploying

376
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:41,560
in the cloud.

377
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:48,280
And OpenShift is, I think, one of those key pieces of that whole IBM hybrid cloud pitch,

378
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:51,900
is OpenShift, because it's kind of the key piece of software orchestration that lets

379
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:54,160
you put it all together and manage it.

380
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:57,280
And so this is kind of a brilliant move.

381
00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:03,320
New investment in server infrastructure, deploy Red Hat and OpenShift, and then on

382
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:09,160
your existing Windows and Mac investments, deploy the development environment for free.

383
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:10,600
I mean, it's clever.

384
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:13,440
You could see how corporate America could use the heck out of this.

385
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:14,640
Oh, definitely.

386
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:21,080
And it goes to show that potentially, OpenShift is the new RHEL.

387
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:26,080
Maybe not yet, but down the line, it's where they will potentially be making most of their

388
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:27,080
money.

389
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:29,080
Yeah, well, RHEL will be just the...

390
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:30,080
Well, it is.

391
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:33,360
It's the implementation detail now, because it could also be core OS.

392
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:38,600
I mean, it's fascinating to consider something that we obsess about so much, Linux, to just

393
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:42,300
be a simple implementation detail here, but that's truly what it means.

394
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:49,360
And I think the other way to look at this is, this is Red Hat's version of WSL2.

395
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:54,400
Or one of the fundamental value propositions of Ubuntu in the corporate environment is

396
00:21:54,400 --> 00:22:00,680
you can have developers on a desktop OS that matches your Ubuntu systems in the cloud.

397
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:04,700
That's one of the things that's really made Ubuntu successful on the desktop.

398
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:06,840
And it's the reason why WSL2 exists.

399
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:11,200
It's the reason why Linux applications and Linux environments are coming to Chromebooks.

400
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:17,620
It's that develop in your production environment on your desktop mentality.

401
00:22:17,620 --> 00:22:21,360
That workflow seems to just be a killer workflow for developers.

402
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:24,080
And everybody wants to have their implementation of it.

403
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:29,400
Yeah, there's a reason why Red Hat did so well and got bought for so much money, eh?

404
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:31,320
That hybrid cloud future.

405
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:32,400
It's future money, Joe.

406
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:33,400
It's in the cloud.

407
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:34,800
We just haven't gotten there yet.

408
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:40,880
I think, though, it's a good indicator that there's always going to be a reason to invest

409
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:44,280
in some level of Linux desktop technologies.

410
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:48,520
Different implementations utilize the desktop stack in different ways.

411
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:53,280
This OpenShift one is more about just enabling development on other platforms.

412
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:59,620
And there are some that push the desktop forward and make it part of that corporate strategy.

413
00:22:59,620 --> 00:23:05,080
So in other words, desktop Linux success is often linked to the success on the server

414
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:06,620
system.

415
00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:08,200
It's a beneficial cycle.

416
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:11,920
Well, if it's not the proper Linux desktop, it'll probably end up being Chrome OS.

417
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:12,920
That's true.

418
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:13,920
I have a theory about that.

419
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:17,160
We've been doing a deep dive on Chrome OS in the last week to talk about it on Linux

420
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:18,160
Unplugged this week.

421
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:24,000
But not an immediately obvious thing, but Chrome OS very well may be the successful

422
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:28,080
Linux desktop future, much like Android brought Linux to the masses.

423
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:29,080
We'll see.

424
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:31,200
We have a little deep dive in this week's Linux Unplugged coming up.

425
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:34,600
I look forward to listening to it two or three times.

426
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:36,360
As the editor, you will.

427
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:38,840
