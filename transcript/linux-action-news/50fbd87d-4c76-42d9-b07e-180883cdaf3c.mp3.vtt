00:00.000 --> 00:09.780
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, episode 223, recorded on January 12th, 2022.

00:09.780 --> 00:10.840
I'm Chris.

00:10.840 --> 00:11.840
And I'm Wes.

00:11.840 --> 00:12.840
Hello, Wes.

00:12.840 --> 00:14.640
Let's do the news.

00:14.640 --> 00:20.520
And we start this week with some big news for what just might be my least favorite desktop

00:20.520 --> 00:21.520
Linux installer.

00:21.520 --> 00:24.120
Yes, that's right.

00:24.120 --> 00:29.920
Red Hat has announced it's planning to shift the Fedora and RHEL installer to a web-based

00:29.920 --> 00:30.920
UI.

00:30.920 --> 00:37.160
Now, if you're familiar with Anaconda, you'll know that it's long been based on GTK.

00:37.160 --> 00:42.040
But as part of some ongoing modernization efforts, it seems that Red Hat is actually

00:42.040 --> 00:46.160
looking at rewriting the UI on top of Cockpit.

00:46.160 --> 00:51.600
Yeah, Cockpit, or I think it's known as Web Console in RHEL, but we frequently refer

00:51.600 --> 00:57.240
to it as Cockpit, which is a web-based management system that's cross-distro, but really has

00:57.240 --> 01:00.160
a home in Fedora.

01:00.160 --> 01:03.120
And it turns out it already knows a little Anaconda D-Bus.

01:03.120 --> 01:04.120
We'll get to that.

01:04.120 --> 01:08.540
But it seems that this is an effort that has been under consideration for a little bit.

01:08.540 --> 01:12.320
And it's all in the really early stages of development.

01:12.320 --> 01:18.080
And the transition actually isn't expected to be that disruptive, because there has been

01:18.080 --> 01:21.360
an ongoing modularity effort in Anaconda.

01:21.360 --> 01:23.040
And there is that D-Bus component.

01:23.040 --> 01:26.920
So they think there's going to be kind of a smooth transition.

01:26.920 --> 01:34.280
Now, honestly, the Anaconda installer, like Wes alluded to, has been probably our most

01:34.280 --> 01:37.680
mixed aspect of the Fedora reviews over the years.

01:37.680 --> 01:42.760
And whenever we have somebody new try Fedora, like they're either a big fan of Anaconda

01:42.760 --> 01:44.680
or they don't like it at all.

01:44.680 --> 01:50.760
Yeah, I don't think you can be neutral on Anaconda, at least not yet.

01:50.760 --> 01:55.480
No, I think it's probably some of the most feedback the team receives as well.

01:55.480 --> 01:56.600
Cockpit is an interesting choice.

01:56.600 --> 01:57.760
So why cockpit?

01:57.760 --> 02:02.200
Well, I think, one, they're pretty happy with how the project has turned out.

02:02.200 --> 02:03.920
It's a mature solution.

02:03.920 --> 02:07.120
And it already has support for that Anaconda D-Bus back end.

02:07.120 --> 02:12.560
And I think another factor is the cockpit team is willing to engage and work with the

02:12.560 --> 02:13.560
Fedora team.

02:13.560 --> 02:15.440
I mean, that matters.

02:15.440 --> 02:20.160
And they have expertise that the Fedora team can leverage for this transition, and it seems

02:20.160 --> 02:24.760
they've even been willing to help build out a bit of a prototype to test this.

02:24.760 --> 02:27.280
I mean, a really early stages kind of thing.

02:27.280 --> 02:29.920
And they've been really good about communicating things.

02:29.920 --> 02:33.200
That matters a lot when you're trying to make a transition like this.

02:33.200 --> 02:37.840
But I think long term, it's probably also a little strategic.

02:37.840 --> 02:45.440
It's about creating a consistent management experience for Fedora, the Fedora spins and

02:45.440 --> 02:51.640
RHEL, and now just like you're going to manage your virtual machines and your disks and you're

02:51.640 --> 02:56.760
going to manage your packages and your updates and your services through cockpit, now you're

02:56.760 --> 02:59.840
also going to do the installation through cockpit.

02:59.840 --> 03:04.320
And if you think of it in an enterprise environment where you might already be doing it through

03:04.320 --> 03:10.680
some sort of remote session, God forbid VNC, which is like the go to solution right now,

03:10.680 --> 03:13.360
this is going to be a way better experience.

03:13.360 --> 03:19.160
And for those of us who do the occasional install, I don't think I'm going to hate this

03:19.160 --> 03:21.960
as much as I might have a couple of years ago.

03:21.960 --> 03:22.960
You know what I mean, Wes?

03:22.960 --> 03:24.480
Like, I think I see the logic here.

03:24.480 --> 03:29.480
Yeah, there's definitely some advantages to having it be a web based UI.

03:29.480 --> 03:32.300
I mean, the web is pretty universal at this point.

03:32.300 --> 03:34.680
But I do wonder how it might work exactly.

03:34.680 --> 03:39.280
I mean, is this going to be just a tiny little GNOME web embedded instance?

03:39.280 --> 03:43.880
How might it work in what might in the old days be more of a, you know, just a low key

03:43.880 --> 03:47.920
minimal terminal install, are we going to have those kinds of options?

03:47.920 --> 03:53.060
But that said, if you think about this as sort of lifting up some of the abstractions

03:53.060 --> 03:58.200
in the system, building more API's, making things more modular, as they have been working

03:58.200 --> 04:02.360
on in the back end of Anaconda, I think that's a really good thing, right?

04:02.360 --> 04:05.960
I mean, this is going to make cockpit more robust, it's going to let the team working

04:05.960 --> 04:10.080
on Anaconda maybe focus a little bit more on the specific implementation details and

04:10.080 --> 04:13.880
a little less on the presentation stuff, especially if that's, you know, partially being handled

04:13.880 --> 04:17.720
by the nice framework that cockpit already has set up.

04:17.720 --> 04:23.920
But as nice as that may potentially be, you can't get too excited just yet.

04:23.920 --> 04:29.360
Because at the current state, they can't really commit to anything on when you might actually

04:29.360 --> 04:31.200
get to try this out.

04:31.200 --> 04:36.960
So far, we don't even have a screenshot.

04:36.960 --> 04:42.280
And popping up the stack a bit, there's a lot of good work going into GNOME Shell and

04:42.280 --> 04:48.100
Mudder, which is the Wayland display server or X11 compositing manager for GNOME.

04:48.100 --> 04:52.280
And this is all intending to land in the 42 release.

04:52.280 --> 04:56.160
Now it looks like on the Mudder side, we're seeing a bunch of notable updates, some of

04:56.160 --> 04:59.400
which are allowing the input events to happen at a full rate.

04:59.400 --> 05:03.240
We've talked about that before, rather than being limited to the monitor refresh rate.

05:03.240 --> 05:08.280
So if you had a 60 hertz screen, that was the absolute max that GNOME was allowing input

05:08.280 --> 05:09.860
events to be captured at.

05:09.860 --> 05:14.440
And some applications, like 3D applications, video editors and video games, were sitting

05:14.440 --> 05:16.000
there pulling, waiting for more.

05:16.000 --> 05:17.000
That's fixed now.

05:17.000 --> 05:18.000
That's going to be nice.

05:18.000 --> 05:20.480
That's a big change for a professional desktop.

05:20.480 --> 05:25.420
Yeah, and great for those on like, say, 120 hertz monitors.

05:25.420 --> 05:26.420
That's really nice.

05:26.420 --> 05:31.360
Also, nice to see support for the Wayland DMA buffer back end extension, which gives

05:31.360 --> 05:35.120
you improved multi GPU support and direct scan out handling.

05:35.120 --> 05:36.120
Hey oh!

05:36.120 --> 05:41.280
And speaking of improvements in that area, Mudder will now prefer GBM over EGL streams.

05:41.280 --> 05:46.480
Now why that matters is because that's how you get the NVIDIA proprietary driver working

05:46.480 --> 05:47.480
on Wayland.

05:47.480 --> 05:50.600
And that now is set to default to prefer GBM.

05:50.600 --> 05:56.800
Well, even outside of Mudder, GNOME 42 has some other nice to see improvements, including

05:56.800 --> 06:01.880
better window tracking, support for extensions being able to opt in to running on the lock

06:01.880 --> 06:07.800
and login screens, and some efficiency improvements in the screen magnifier, which has now learned

06:07.800 --> 06:12.080
to be better at avoiding off-screen rendering.

06:12.080 --> 06:18.600
Following this alpha, GNOME 42 beta is expected sometime mid-February, with plans for an official

06:18.600 --> 06:23.600
release on March 23rd.

06:23.600 --> 06:27.920
We don't mention every release of Linux Mint, but this one seemed like a particularly good

06:27.920 --> 06:28.920
one.

06:28.920 --> 06:35.620
Linux Mint 20.3 has been released, and this one has security updates until 2025.

06:35.620 --> 06:40.380
New in this release is dark mode, as the team says is now omnipresent throughout the apps

06:40.380 --> 06:43.920
and the UI, giving a more coherent user experience.

06:43.920 --> 06:48.880
They've introduced a new document manager called Thingy, think of it as like a library

06:48.880 --> 06:53.200
that keeps track of your documents on your computer and how far you've read.

06:53.200 --> 06:55.960
It's pretty nice looking too.

06:55.960 --> 06:58.600
Themes have been refreshed and modernized in this release.

06:58.600 --> 07:05.960
And of course, Mint 20.3 features Cinnamon 5.2 along with some other desktops, but Cinnamon

07:05.960 --> 07:08.240
5.2 has gotten some nice work.

07:08.240 --> 07:14.000
And the integrated calendar now has event management functionality, and it syncs with

07:14.000 --> 07:20.540
potential calendar sources like Evolution, Google Calendar, Mozilla Thunderbird and whatnot

07:20.540 --> 07:22.800
right there in your little clock area.

07:22.800 --> 07:24.360
It looks great.

07:24.360 --> 07:26.180
That's pretty nice to see.

07:26.180 --> 07:33.280
Under the hood, Linux Mint 20.3 is powered by Linux kernel 5.4, building on top of the

07:33.280 --> 07:35.940
Ubuntu 20.04 base.

07:35.940 --> 07:40.560
And for you Flatpak users, it's got Flatpak 1.12.

07:40.560 --> 07:45.600
Also in the news for Linux Mint recently, it seems they've reached a deal with Mozilla

07:45.600 --> 07:50.720
to have the project directly package Firefox for Mint.

07:50.720 --> 07:56.280
Mint founder Clement Lefebvre wrote, quote, in the past, Linux Mint used its own default

07:56.280 --> 08:01.080
settings and configured Firefox in a specific way.

08:01.080 --> 08:06.080
Most of this configuration is now abandoned to go back to the Mozilla defaults.

08:06.080 --> 08:08.980
Yep, no more Mint homepage.

08:08.980 --> 08:10.860
It's the way Mozilla does it.

08:10.860 --> 08:17.280
So among the changes, search engines will be back to the Mozilla default, which means

08:17.280 --> 08:21.120
Google, not DuckDuckGo like it was before.

08:21.120 --> 08:26.200
And it also means that any other kind of small patches they made, say, like to the devs that

08:26.200 --> 08:32.080
Ubuntu made, those are being dropped now because it's just going to be as Mozilla ships it.

08:32.080 --> 08:38.040
Adding a little additional background, Clem went on to say, quote, for Mozilla, the goal

08:38.040 --> 08:44.080
is to make Firefox work the same way across all platforms, to ease maintenance and simplify

08:44.080 --> 08:47.160
development and bug fixing.

08:47.160 --> 08:53.860
For us, this change means a tremendous simplification in terms of maintenance and our development.

08:53.860 --> 09:00.120
Two additional points of interest here, one, Clem also seemed to imply that avoiding using

09:00.120 --> 09:04.840
the snap of Firefox was also a major motivation here.

09:04.840 --> 09:10.640
And two, if you've already made changes to these default settings, well, we'll respect

09:10.640 --> 09:11.640
that.

09:11.640 --> 09:13.120
That's not going to get wiped out.

09:13.120 --> 09:27.720
And if you're just relying on the defaults, then you're going to see some changes.

09:27.720 --> 09:33.360
Linode really offers you something better for developers, for businesses, for individuals,

09:33.360 --> 09:38.400
for those of you who just don't want the complexities of those big hyperscalers out there, and you

09:38.400 --> 09:43.160
don't need their endless options, but you still want a great price and you want better

09:43.160 --> 09:45.160
performance.

09:45.160 --> 09:47.440
Linode's how we run everything.

09:47.440 --> 09:52.260
Everything that we've built in the last 2.5 years now, it runs on Linux.

09:52.260 --> 09:56.520
And I noticed right when I first tried Linode, you can tell in the product that the company

09:56.520 --> 09:58.760
gets and loves Linux.

09:58.760 --> 10:02.260
They use it every day in their own environment, and it shows in their tooling.

10:02.260 --> 10:04.600
It's done really, really well.

10:04.600 --> 10:09.480
They started 18 years ago, and now they are the largest independent cloud provider in

10:09.480 --> 10:10.480
the world.

10:10.480 --> 10:13.680
And they learned that customer support is absolutely critical.

10:13.680 --> 10:17.800
So they've invested in having the best customer support in the business.

10:17.800 --> 10:21.420
And to round that out, they have 11 data centers around the world for you to choose from, great

10:21.420 --> 10:26.200
features like object storage, cloud firewall, a beautiful interface, backups that are simple

10:26.200 --> 10:28.700
and reliable, and a lot more.

10:28.700 --> 10:33.080
So go build something, go learn something, and try it for yourself while supporting the

10:33.080 --> 10:34.080
show.

10:34.080 --> 10:35.240
Linux.com slash LAN.

10:35.240 --> 10:40.000
Get that $100 in 60 day credit and kick the tires for yourself.

10:40.000 --> 10:43.920
Linode.com slash LAN.

10:43.920 --> 10:46.760
And a big thank you to Ting, Linux.ting.com.

10:46.760 --> 10:50.520
Go to Linux.ting.com and see how much you could save on cell service.

10:50.520 --> 10:55.340
And then take $25 off that, either your service or a device, Linux.ting.com.

10:55.340 --> 10:59.580
You see, Ting doesn't have to worry about making all the deals with the local governments

10:59.580 --> 11:01.220
and digging holes in the ground.

11:01.220 --> 11:03.520
They're a mobile virtual network operator.

11:03.520 --> 11:08.240
So that means Ting gets access to the same nationwide networks, LTE and 5G, but they

11:08.240 --> 11:13.300
can offer a better value and better customer support than the big duopolies can.

11:13.300 --> 11:15.120
And Ting has that nationwide coverage.

11:15.120 --> 11:17.640
They have a mix of plans and fast data.

11:17.640 --> 11:21.240
So go to Linux.ting.com and see what works in your area.

11:21.240 --> 11:24.840
It's a smart move too, because not only are you going to save, but Ting Mobile was recently

11:24.840 --> 11:29.840
named the number one carrier by customer reports in 2021.

11:29.840 --> 11:34.040
Congratulations Ting, and their plans are simple and straightforward.

11:34.040 --> 11:35.040
Very easy to understand.

11:35.040 --> 11:36.160
I appreciate about them.

11:36.160 --> 11:39.000
That's why I've been there since 2013.

11:39.000 --> 11:40.000
You just look at the plans.

11:40.000 --> 11:41.280
They make sense.

11:41.280 --> 11:43.160
You can tell it's a good deal.

11:43.160 --> 11:44.860
It's all really obvious.

11:44.860 --> 11:45.860
It's really simple.

11:45.860 --> 11:48.000
I really appreciate that.

11:48.000 --> 11:51.560
And really, you know, when they can, they're just going to give you unlimited.

11:51.560 --> 11:52.600
That helps keep it simple.

11:52.600 --> 11:56.200
Like you can get plans that have unlimited talk and text, and if you're a family that,

11:56.200 --> 11:59.680
you know, calls each other and text, what a great way to do a family plan.

11:59.680 --> 12:04.720
And every single plan gets access to Ting's award-winning customer service with nationwide

12:04.720 --> 12:10.360
LTE and 5G coverage, and the freedom of no contracts ever.

12:10.360 --> 12:11.580
I love that.

12:11.580 --> 12:13.120
And it's so simple to switch to Ting.

12:13.120 --> 12:15.920
Pretty much any phone will work because of their multi-network support.

12:15.920 --> 12:20.360
So just head to Linux.ting.com, check your current phone, create an account, and pick

12:20.360 --> 12:21.800
the plan that's right for you.

12:21.800 --> 12:22.800
Ting will send you a SIM card.

12:22.800 --> 12:23.800
You're going to pop that in.

12:23.800 --> 12:24.960
You'll be going in minutes.

12:24.960 --> 12:27.720
You're never going to be happier than when you start saving money.

12:27.720 --> 12:30.960
It feels great, and why not do it at the beginning of the year?

12:30.960 --> 12:35.480
I've been on a savings rampage recently, and Ting is absolutely one of the ways I get

12:35.480 --> 12:36.480
there.

12:36.480 --> 12:40.480
Linux.ting.com.

12:40.480 --> 12:47.100
Giving us flashbacks of Linux's early days, former Twitter boss Jack Dorsey is helping

12:47.100 --> 12:52.720
to launch a new fund that's aiming to help defend Bitcoin developers against potential

12:52.720 --> 12:54.960
litigation.

12:54.960 --> 12:58.400
His first port of call will be to come to the aid of the Bitcoin developers who are

12:58.400 --> 13:04.280
being sued by Craig Wright's Tulip Trading Limited over an alleged, quote, breach of

13:04.280 --> 13:06.480
fiduciary duty.

13:06.480 --> 13:11.060
To start with, the fund will be providing funding for outside counsel.

13:11.060 --> 13:13.920
It seems like this came just at the right time.

13:13.920 --> 13:17.720
The email that Jack Dorsey sent out to the Bitcoin developer mailing list went out this

13:17.720 --> 13:23.920
morning, and Dorsey described the open source community as, quote, especially susceptible

13:23.920 --> 13:25.540
to legal pressure.

13:25.540 --> 13:32.040
He wrote, in response, we propose a coordinated and formalized response to help defend developers.

13:32.040 --> 13:35.360
So Craig Wright claims to be Satoshi Nakamoto.

13:35.360 --> 13:39.240
Now in my personal opinion, and just about the opinion of everyone online, he is not

13:39.240 --> 13:42.320
actually Satoshi Nakamoto, the creator of Bitcoin.

13:42.320 --> 13:43.960
That's what you said about me as well.

13:43.960 --> 13:46.760
I think you're just a skeptic.

13:46.760 --> 13:52.400
I'll tell you what, hand on my heart, there's a better shot that Wes Payne is Satoshi Nakamoto

13:52.400 --> 13:55.320
than Craig Wright, in my personal opinion.

13:55.320 --> 13:58.320
Because Craig doesn't even seem to understand how Bitcoin works.

13:58.320 --> 14:05.840
What Craig wants is, and this is my understanding, but it seems he had coins from Mt. Gox.

14:05.840 --> 14:10.520
Perhaps he came into possession of these coins after they circulated in the market when they

14:10.520 --> 14:12.040
were stolen.

14:12.040 --> 14:13.520
That part is not clear to me.

14:13.520 --> 14:17.440
However, he has a large amount of coins that he then lost.

14:17.440 --> 14:22.360
And he wants the Bitcoin developers to alter the Bitcoin source code to give him his key

14:22.360 --> 14:23.360
back.

14:23.360 --> 14:25.760
He thinks it's their responsibility.

14:25.760 --> 14:30.840
He thinks he's found a law that makes it their responsibility to help him recover his lost

14:30.840 --> 14:31.840
keys.

14:31.840 --> 14:35.840
I'm sure anybody who's ever lost some Bitcoin would love the developers to do this.

14:35.840 --> 14:41.080
But clearly, if Craig was Satoshi Nakamoto, he would know that you can't just change the

14:41.080 --> 14:43.800
source code and have that get adopted.

14:43.800 --> 14:49.000
Every node operator would also have to update their node and accept these changes.

14:49.000 --> 14:53.480
This has happened in Bitcoin's history before when they tried to go to a larger block size

14:53.480 --> 14:56.680
and the nodes played a role in rejecting that change.

14:56.680 --> 15:01.240
So even if the source code could be changed, it wouldn't necessarily roll out.

15:01.240 --> 15:03.300
The network wouldn't have consensus.

15:03.300 --> 15:04.600
It wouldn't matter.

15:04.600 --> 15:08.080
But I'm sure Craig knows that since he's Satoshi Nakamoto.

15:08.080 --> 15:15.080
Also Craig is going after anyone who has posted a copy of Satoshi Nakamoto's original white

15:15.080 --> 15:19.700
paper about Bitcoin because he claims it's copyright infringement since he is Satoshi.

15:19.700 --> 15:21.360
He wrote the white paper.

15:21.360 --> 15:25.600
Anyone who is linked to it or posted online is committing copyright violations and he's

15:25.600 --> 15:27.320
going after them or at least a select group.

15:27.320 --> 15:31.720
Now, in my opinion, that just seems ridiculous as well because it's an open source project

15:31.720 --> 15:34.540
and the white paper is meant to be widely distributed.

15:34.540 --> 15:40.600
So the whole thing seems like a pretty loose understanding of how all of these things work

15:40.600 --> 15:42.320
and not likely going to go very far.

15:42.320 --> 15:45.800
But in the meantime, he's going to burn a lot of money and he's going to cause a lot

15:45.800 --> 15:47.720
of developers a lot of heartburn.

15:47.720 --> 15:51.800
And that's why it's pretty great that Jack Dorsey is trying to get this rolling to help

15:51.800 --> 15:52.800
shield them from that.

15:52.800 --> 15:54.320
Because I don't think it's just this, Wes.

15:54.320 --> 15:59.040
It's like any future litigation related to Bitcoin based projects.

15:59.040 --> 16:02.320
Dorsey even made mention of people working on lightning network apps.

16:02.320 --> 16:07.040
Yeah, whatever you may think of this particular example, it does seem to be highlighting a

16:07.040 --> 16:12.320
need as we see for other open source efforts that without someone helping on the monetary

16:12.320 --> 16:16.360
front on the organizational front, well, sometimes these projects just aren't set up in a way

16:16.360 --> 16:20.360
that can interface well with various legal systems.

16:20.360 --> 16:24.560
Back to some of the nitty gritty on the fun side, well, initially it's going to be staffed

16:24.560 --> 16:28.200
by volunteers and part time lawyers.

16:28.200 --> 16:32.120
And there'll be a board responsible for allocating the resources.

16:32.120 --> 16:33.560
Who's going to be on that board?

16:33.560 --> 16:35.400
Well, Jack Dorsey, of course.

16:35.400 --> 16:42.680
But also Chain Code Labs co-founder Alex Morkos and academic Martin White clarifying the fund's

16:42.680 --> 16:48.800
financial position to start with, Dorsey wrote, quote, at this time, the fund is not seeking

16:48.800 --> 16:53.680
to raise additional money for its operations, but will do so at the direction of the board

16:53.680 --> 16:58.520
if needed for further legal action or to pay for staff.

16:58.520 --> 17:05.360
Hmm, I was struck when I read this and I read into what Craig Wright is attempting to do.

17:05.360 --> 17:08.360
I think you mean Satoshi Nakamoto, Chris?

17:08.360 --> 17:09.360
Oh, right.

17:09.360 --> 17:10.360
Sorry.

17:10.360 --> 17:11.360
Of course.

17:11.360 --> 17:12.360
Right.

17:12.360 --> 17:13.640
In my opinion, Craig Wright, or also a.k.a.

17:13.640 --> 17:19.720
Satoshi Nakamoto, anybody who's been in Linux for a long time remembers SCO and just the

17:19.720 --> 17:25.920
disproportional amount of FUD that small company could produce about Linux, IP and their supposed

17:25.920 --> 17:30.040
ownership over components in Linux that made it so successful.

17:30.040 --> 17:34.680
And they fought and they fought and they they tried going after projects and developers.

17:34.680 --> 17:36.400
They tried going after companies.

17:36.400 --> 17:40.720
They even ultimately eventually tried to go after end users of Linux for a little bit

17:40.720 --> 17:43.320
in an embarrassingly desperate move.

17:43.320 --> 17:48.280
And there's so many echoes of that kind of maybe actually echoes isn't the right word.

17:48.280 --> 17:50.360
There's a lot of ways this rhymes with history.

17:50.360 --> 17:54.560
What's happening right now as Bitcoin becomes successful, somebody is trying to use the

17:54.560 --> 17:59.160
legal system to gain control and ownership over it to make money.

17:59.160 --> 18:02.320
And their position seems tenuous from the best, even from the very beginning.

18:02.320 --> 18:05.920
But that doesn't preclude them from doing years of legal battles.

18:05.920 --> 18:10.080
And so Jack Dorsey stepping down from Twitter might have been one of the better things for

18:10.080 --> 18:11.600
Bitcoin recently.

18:11.600 --> 18:13.720
And this is a great first start.

18:13.720 --> 18:18.680
But my opinion, I think what would be even better long term is actually something that's

18:18.680 --> 18:23.400
maybe decentralized that the community could fund, because I think there's a lot of Bitcoin

18:23.400 --> 18:27.940
users that would stop hodling a little bit of Bitcoin and come out of the woodwork and

18:27.940 --> 18:33.680
contribute to a fund to go after creeps like Craig, in my opinion, that are going after

18:33.680 --> 18:34.680
developers.

18:34.680 --> 18:36.440
And that kind of thing has to be stopped.

18:36.440 --> 18:40.320
And it's better for the entire Bitcoin community if it's stopped right now and early.

18:40.320 --> 18:45.000
Yeah, you got to wonder, you know, this is focused on Bitcoin, but are other cryptocurrency

18:45.000 --> 18:49.000
communities and projects in the space going to fall under its arena?

18:49.000 --> 18:51.720
Or will they need their own organizations?

18:51.720 --> 18:54.500
And yeah, as you say, you know, there are various approaches here.

18:54.500 --> 18:59.440
But this seems like adding in a bit more centralization, at least in some regards, how well is this

18:59.440 --> 19:03.420
board going to serve that community, I can definitely see where the community might want

19:03.420 --> 19:06.400
something a little more decentralized and autonomous.

19:06.400 --> 19:09.960
But perhaps this can be a good way to bootstrap things.

19:09.960 --> 19:15.000
Yeah, and I think you make a good point to like, where does this leave the other cryptocurrencies?

19:15.000 --> 19:20.360
Does it make them more legally exposed if they don't have a war chest standing by?

19:20.360 --> 19:24.960
Wes, do you recall when there was a patent lawsuit going around, I think it involved

19:24.960 --> 19:27.160
essentially using a playlist on a website.

19:27.160 --> 19:30.360
It's a vague recollection, but this was a thing a few years ago.

19:30.360 --> 19:32.360
Yeah, that sounds familiar.

19:32.360 --> 19:38.880
And it really was a matter of the person doing the litigation in that scenario started with

19:38.880 --> 19:44.560
a few low hanging fruits, small operations, and then won the case there and then built

19:44.560 --> 19:47.000
on top of that and built on top of that.

19:47.000 --> 19:50.120
And you do wonder if maybe something like that could end up happening in the cryptocurrency

19:50.120 --> 19:51.120
world.

19:51.120 --> 19:55.480
But this is all part of a brave new frontier, Linux had to go through these same exact growing

19:55.480 --> 19:56.480
pains.

19:56.480 --> 20:01.200
Yeah, it certainly seems like early days, both in the crypto space, and of course, for

20:01.200 --> 20:06.760
this new fund, seems like we should be hearing more from them as the ball gets rolling sometime

20:06.760 --> 20:07.760
soon.

20:07.760 --> 20:12.960
And it is probably worth mentioning just one more time that, no, they're not looking for

20:12.960 --> 20:13.960
money.

20:13.960 --> 20:15.840
They've got enough of that, at least for now.

20:15.840 --> 20:19.520
Well, we're going to keep the ball rolling right here every single week.
