00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,240
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, episode 153, recorded on September 6th, 2020.

2
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:10,240
I'm Chris.

3
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:11,240
And I'm Joe.

4
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:12,240
Hello, Joe.

5
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:13,240
Welcome back.

6
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:14,840
We start with some great news this week.

7
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:19,240
Lenovo has begun rolling out Fedora Linux on their laptops, with Ubuntu not too far

8
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:20,240
behind.

9
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:24,640
Yeah, we've known this was coming since April, but now it's finally rolling out.

10
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:28,320
And it's right there front and center on the Lenovo website.

11
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:33,220
You can buy an X1 Carbon Generation 8, and it's even slightly cheaper if you get it with

12
00:00:33,220 --> 00:00:34,220
Fedora.

13
00:00:34,220 --> 00:00:38,800
Yeah, not only front and center, like you mentioned, but it's just straight Fedora.

14
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:42,200
It's not necessarily a modified install, which is really nice to see.

15
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:46,240
It's currently only rolled out to the US, but it seems like other markets are going

16
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:51,960
to follow, as well as potentially the ThinkPad P1 Gen 2 and the ThinkPad P53.

17
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:55,880
And we'll also be seeing Ubuntu pre-installed on some of these Lenovo machines soon.

18
00:00:55,880 --> 00:01:03,480
Yeah, it's not quite clear, but a Lenovo employee on August 29, 2020, said that the Ubuntu X1

19
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:08,800
Carbon, along, quote, with a number of other Ubuntu systems, will be coming very soon.

20
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:13,000
But we hit an internal snag with getting the platform up that needed fixing.

21
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,940
And that meant laying the Ubuntu system just a little bit.

22
00:01:15,940 --> 00:01:17,640
So it seems like it's pretty close.

23
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:18,640
You'll have your choice.

24
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:23,300
And we also got an announcement this week from Canonical about the HP Z series laptops

25
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:25,800
or Z series, as you would say.

26
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:28,960
They are going to come preloaded with Ubuntu.

27
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:32,280
So that's HP reaffirming their commitment to selling laptops with Linux.

28
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:36,320
And so now, obviously, we've got Dell as well, and Lenovo.

29
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:41,280
That's three of the biggest players in the laptop market selling pre-installed Linux

30
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:46,280
machines, as well as, obviously, Entryware and System76 and all of the smaller independent

31
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:47,280
players.

32
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,360
It feels like we're really there.

33
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:54,840
What I think is interesting about each one of these OEMs is the machines they're choosing

34
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:57,640
to release that support Linux.

35
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:03,760
Like in the case of the HP Z series, those are high-end machines, right, with Quadro

36
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:08,480
RTX GPUs in them and the latest Intel CPUs.

37
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:13,680
And they have a high-end HP Studio Create type machine, too, that has high-end components.

38
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:19,000
Again, they talk a lot about machine learning in the announcement and GPU accelerated tasks,

39
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,580
lots of focus on that in HP.

40
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:27,660
In the Lenovo Carbon line, you see a developer workstation, a similar approach that Dell

41
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:28,760
is taking.

42
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:33,520
I think it's kind of this story of we think we have identified the user for these and

43
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:35,860
have now begun to build a product for them.

44
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:37,240
And they're all kind of syncing up.

45
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:40,280
And in a way, it's kind of like what took them so long.

46
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:46,000
Because it seems like System76 and Dell with the Sputnik project kind of proved this model

47
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,320
out, I don't know, five, six, seven years ago at least.

48
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:54,600
So I don't know what took them so long, but it's actually nice to see it.

49
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:59,840
And I think you have to appreciate the impact that upstream projects like the Linux vendor

50
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:05,100
firmware service and upstream working with the kernel and driver development have impacted

51
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:07,320
and made this possible.

52
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:14,000
It's pretty great because chances are if these things are running stock 2004 or stock Fedora

53
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,280
or even close to it, you're going to have a pretty easy time getting whatever distribution

54
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:19,520
you want on there.

55
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:23,160
Now that to me is truly like that's the moment there.

56
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:24,160
That's what I always wanted.

57
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:26,320
It's great to come loaded with something.

58
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:27,320
Good.

59
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:30,840
But I always wanted the ability to put whatever I want on that machine.

60
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:31,840
Oh, yeah.

61
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:34,000
And that's the good thing about the ThinkPads at least.

62
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,460
We've got that promise that it is just going to be vanilla upstream Fedora with no patches

63
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:39,680
or anything.

64
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:43,720
And so yeah, if it's going to work with Fedora, put Arch on there, Suza, whatever.

65
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:45,520
It's going to work pretty much guaranteed.

66
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:51,960
The other thing is I hope there's a revenue story at least in some capacity for the distributions

67
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:52,960
involved here.

68
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:55,320
I'm not quite clear on what it might be.

69
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:59,040
It seems like there's ancillary benefits besides just direct revenue, but it would be fantastic

70
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:03,360
if there is some revenue for those projects as well to help with development.

71
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,320
But they're nice looking machines.

72
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:08,520
It's interesting that none of them quite appeal to me.

73
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:12,600
I gave a real look at the ThinkPads and I'm not really in a position to buy one right

74
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:19,680
now, but just like going with my shopping eyes, would any of these appeal to me?

75
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,480
Not quite.

76
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:24,880
Maybe the HPs, but I don't really want to pay the premium for a Quadro either.

77
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:29,560
I want a GPU, but I don't want something that expensive.

78
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:34,640
So that's where things like the System76 lineup or the Entryware lineup almost kind of appeals

79
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:40,960
to my kind of Linux use a little bit more, but not trying to downplay the Lenovo stuff

80
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:44,440
and the HP stuff, because I think it means that you're going to appeal to businesses

81
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:46,640
a lot more and developers a lot more.

82
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:47,640
And that's great.

83
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:52,520
Well, as for the revenue for the various projects, well, for Canonical to certify a device to

84
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:56,960
work with Ubuntu, there's a lot of work goes into that and you have to pay them quite a

85
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:59,080
bit for the privilege of that.

86
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:04,600
So I would be very surprised if HP haven't paid Canonical a decent chunk of money for

87
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:05,600
this Z series.

88
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:06,600
Yeah, very likely.

89
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:11,080
I mean, even if it's not a lot, even if it's only a few dollars per machine, depending

90
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:15,600
on what the negotiation rate is, that means at least HP and Dell are doing that, which

91
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:20,080
means that the Ubuntu desktop is making money for Canonical.

92
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,840
That's also a big deal for Ubuntu users.

93
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:26,320
That means the Ubuntu desktop is a revenue source for Canonical and it's going to be

94
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:28,160
treated as such.

95
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:32,960
And I think that is, even if you don't buy an HP laptop or a Lenovo laptop, I think

96
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:34,520
that's good for Ubuntu desktop users.

97
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:38,640
Yeah, I think it's been the case for a while that it's been somewhat profitable, but obviously

98
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:44,420
the more profitable the desktop is for Canonical, the more likely it is to hang around.

99
00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:47,560
As well as obviously the political reasons, it wouldn't be a good look for them to get

100
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:50,920
rid of the desktop and just abandon it to the community.

101
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:56,700
But when this IPO comes around or whether they sell or whatever, if you've got a nice

102
00:05:56,700 --> 00:06:02,160
healthy profit margin coming from your desktop, then it's almost certainly going to survive.

103
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:05,600
Yeah, it's about time we cook up some new crazy prediction.

104
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:09,440
You know how the prediction's always been Microsoft is going to buy Canonical or something

105
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:10,440
like that.

106
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:17,320
I feel like the new one needs to be the Canonical change to become revenue, whatever, is they

107
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:23,080
become like a WSL first desktop where you use the Windows desktop, but it's all Canonical's

108
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:26,540
tools underneath and they just abandoned the desktop project.

109
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:27,680
It's totally never going to happen, right?

110
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:30,760
But it just seems like a great conspiracy like, oh, WSL is going to be the end of the

111
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:32,320
Ubuntu desktop or something.

112
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:33,320
Yeah.

113
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:36,000
Why not start our return episode with Wild Conspiracy Theory?

114
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Great idea.

115
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
I thought so.

116
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,240
You know, for a news show, it seems pretty solid.

117
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:44,120
Actually, why don't we go back to the news and talk about the PinePhone shipping, Manjaro,

118
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:45,520
for the next community edition?

119
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:46,520
Yeah.

120
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:51,440
So this is relatively hot on the heels of the post-market OS edition.

121
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:54,280
And this time it's going to have two different variants as well.

122
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:59,000
One for $149 that is just the basic two gigabytes of RAM model.

123
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:03,840
And then the $199 one, which is three gigabytes of RAM and double the storage.

124
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:10,260
And also includes the USB-C dock, which allows you to have potentially at least convergence.

125
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:14,820
So this is very similar hardware to the last community edition, but this is going to come

126
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:15,820
with Manjaro.

127
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:23,400
Now, I have a PinePhone and I checked out Manjaro on it and it's actually very promising.

128
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:25,120
It's early, but it's promising.

129
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,120
Yeah.

130
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:29,960
And I think they have sharp people in the Manjaro project that are working on those

131
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:35,120
ports because I've experimented on the PineBook Pro and at the end of the day, I stuck with

132
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,120
Manjaro on it.

133
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:40,600
And I think it's in part because these are so early in the development process that getting

134
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:45,360
access to that super fresh software and kernel and driver stack makes a difference on a device

135
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,360
like this.

136
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:48,960
I mean, it can make a huge difference in performance and battery life.

137
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:54,600
And like we just saw from the UberPorts project, camera frame rate even can be impacted significantly

138
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,200
by software updates.

139
00:07:56,200 --> 00:08:01,760
I think going back to this though, what's interesting about the $199 variant is that

140
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:05,960
bundled USB-C dock, they're calling that the convergence package.

141
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:12,320
And that dock has a 10100 Ethernet and two USB-A ports on it and an HDMI out.

142
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:13,480
So the idea is you...

143
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:17,720
And you power over USB-C. So the idea is you power with a USB-C cord, you hook up your

144
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:23,040
mouse and keyboard, you hook up an HDMI display, and now you're using that classic idea of

145
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:25,040
a converged device.

146
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:29,240
So then I imagine you'd have a somewhat usable desktop, but I can't picture the performance

147
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:30,240
is going to be great.

148
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:33,180
No, I think it's more proof of concept really.

149
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:38,240
But the thing is that if you can prove your concept on a low-end device like this, then

150
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:44,860
you suddenly apply that concept and code to a higher performance device, then it's presumably

151
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:46,360
going to fly on it.

152
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:48,120
So that's the hope at least.

153
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:50,920
We might get a PinePhone Pro at some point.

154
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:51,920
Who knows?

155
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:55,420
I mean, it's pure speculation at this point, but you have to figure that's where it's going.

156
00:08:55,420 --> 00:08:59,720
It might be another couple of years or whatever, but at some point, at least I'm hoping to

157
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:00,880
see that.

158
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:08,200
But what we've seen with UbiPorts and with postmarket OS is this is a deadline.

159
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:12,040
When these devices are waiting to be shipped, you've got to get your image ready.

160
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:16,640
And so instead of it being just a sort of, oh, well, we're developing it as it goes and

161
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:20,560
we'll have these milestones here and there, this is a deadline.

162
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:23,440
You've got to get something usable shipping on it.

163
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:29,280
And Manjaro at the moment has a lot of potential and it's got Andbox pre-installed and it's

164
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:32,600
looking really good, but there is a lot of work to do on it.

165
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:39,720
And so I'm hoping that this community edition will force them to get everything sorted and

166
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:43,640
push it forward and we'll get something that's really usable.

167
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:47,360
But the thing about the PinePhone is that it doesn't really matter if it ships with

168
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:49,900
something that's not 100%.

169
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:52,320
These phones are aimed at tinkerers and hackers, right?

170
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:56,140
And it's not difficult to get another operating system on there.

171
00:09:56,140 --> 00:10:02,560
So you end up with this kind of friendly competition amongst the various image makers for the PinePhone

172
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:05,160
and they also all work together.

173
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:11,000
And it's just a great hardware platform for those open source projects to work together.

174
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:16,880
You may have touched on a significant realization about software development for these mobile

175
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:22,880
platforms, which has been a huge challenge for open source for a decade now.

176
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:27,600
And it is the inherent impact that shipping something has on software development.

177
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,400
That is a huge aspect.

178
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:35,380
This milestone, you have a deadline, it kind of creates this sprint mentality and people

179
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:39,320
put in the extra work and they have to get it to a certain bar.

180
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:44,360
And without that mechanism, it's sometimes just you'd never quite get there organically

181
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:49,080
because it kind of requires a set of circumstances to get people compelled to do it.

182
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:50,480
Well, that's the hope at least.

183
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:55,680
And this is the experiment that we're seeing and fingers crossed, it has so far has gone

184
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:56,680
pretty well.

185
00:10:56,680 --> 00:11:02,400
If you look at the state of UbiPorts, it's looking really good now on the PinePhone.

186
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:07,320
What are your thoughts on this, as they call it a quote unquote scheme to donate $10 per

187
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:13,040
unit sold back to the Mangero project or whoever the community image might be?

188
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:18,000
I think it's a great idea in theory, but the margins are so low that I don't see how they

189
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
can afford to do it.

190
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:24,800
But I guess if they can, it's great because it is an incentive for these communities to

191
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:29,480
get together and make something that is worth shipping on a device.

192
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:31,760
And it's a great way for people to support those projects.

193
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:32,760
I agree.

194
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:37,400
I'd check a box or I'd be totally happy if the $10 was just bundled in the price to give

195
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:38,400
back.

196
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:42,960
I think that's a great idea and it helps justify the project spending significant resources

197
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:45,000
on getting it across the line.

198
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:49,460
So the pre-orders for the Mangero Community Edition open mid-September and we'll have

199
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:54,680
links in the show notes at linuxactionnews.com slash 153 if you want more information.

200
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:59,360
There's also a Telegram Pine64 news channel that you can check out if you're a Telegram

201
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:00,360
user.

202
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:03,280
Well, while we're on the mobile topic, I just wanted to quickly mention something that I

203
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:10,160
think is great news and that is that LineageOS is adding official support for the Pixel 2,

204
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:13,880
3a, 4 and some other devices.

205
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:20,520
This is 17.1 which is based on Android 10 and so now I think all of the Pixel phones

206
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:25,560
apart from the very latest one, the Pixel 4a, have got official lineage support or at

207
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:26,560
least will have soon.

208
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:32,200
You know, the install on my Pixel 3 is getting to that old sort of feels super slow.

209
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:36,800
You really feel it when you reboot it and it legitimately takes like an hour to kind

210
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,880
of get itself going again.

211
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:44,120
So I, you know, more than ever, am kind of looking over at LineageOS and going, how you

212
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:45,120
doing over there?

213
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:46,180
How's your Pixel 3 support?

214
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:50,080
So let me know on Twitter if you use it on the Pixel 3 and how the support is like the

215
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:52,960
Wi-Fi, the camera, the Bluetooth, all of that.

216
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:58,120
And if you use it with Android Auto, I'd like to know as well at Chris Last on Twitter.

217
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:03,520
Well, it is really easy to flash the stock image back onto it so you've got no excuses.

218
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:15,040
I think you should just do it.

219
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:20,240
If you're around Wi-Fi, then you really don't need to pay for a monthly set of data.

220
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:25,020
Like myself here at the studio and at home, the only time I'm really not on Wi-Fi is when

221
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:29,340
I'm doing my commute and I kind of look at that as a backup connection.

222
00:13:29,340 --> 00:13:36,400
Ting now offers LTE coverage on three nationwide providers, so you'll be able to use Ting wherever

223
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:37,400
you are at.

224
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:41,180
And one of the things that's fantastic since I was a Ting customer is they've now added

225
00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:44,580
Verizon Wireless as one of those providers.

226
00:13:44,580 --> 00:13:45,980
That brought me back.

227
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:51,080
Ting offers LTE for several networks and the ability to choose is a powerful tool for me

228
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,840
when I'm trying to get data on the road.

229
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:54,720
And just about any phone will work on Ting.

230
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:59,360
You can bring yours today and when you go to linux.ting.com, you'll get a $25 service

231
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:00,360
credit.

232
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:01,860
And you'll always be able to bring your phone number.

233
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:03,060
You can port that.

234
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:05,280
And there's tons of cool phones that you can buy from Ting.

235
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:08,600
I love that they still have a flip phone available.

236
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:13,520
It's like 70 bucks new, 75 bucks new, and it's a really simple device.

237
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:16,800
And the more phones you have on Ting, the less you pay per phone since it's shared across

238
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:17,800
your devices.

239
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:18,800
That's really nice.

240
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:19,800
It's just $6 a line.

241
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:20,800
There's no contracts.

242
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:22,120
There's no commitments.

243
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:25,200
The average Ting bill is just $23 a month per phone.

244
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:29,760
So you'll get a month of free service if you use linux.ting.com and get that $25 promo

245
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:30,760
code.

246
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:34,000
Head over to linux.ting.com, click on the check your phone, and see if your existing

247
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:38,560
phone will work, linux.ting.com.

248
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:42,000
Mozilla has been in the news quite a lot while we've been off air.

249
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,460
And this week is no exception.

250
00:14:44,460 --> 00:14:48,700
They've released Firefox 80 for Android, which has addressed some of the concerns that people

251
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:52,240
had about Firefox 79, but not all of them.

252
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:55,920
Yeah, our year-end review episode is going to be really interesting.

253
00:14:55,920 --> 00:15:00,640
But as of currently, Mozilla rolled out Firefox 79 a bit ago, and they had a year's worth

254
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:02,760
of changes baked into it.

255
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:08,280
But that release was met with some criticism, which the folks over at xtadevelopers.com

256
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:10,520
do a good job covering in their write-up.

257
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:11,520
But I'll give you an example.

258
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:16,240
Like for instance, Firefox 79 offered support for only a handful of extensions at launch,

259
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:20,600
and it didn't include the about colon config page, which would kill me.

260
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:25,440
Also, a lot of people had a botched password migration, and people didn't really like the

261
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:28,500
tab switcher and the removal of the back button.

262
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:32,920
So in an attempt to address these issues, Mozilla is rolling out Firefox 80 for Android.

263
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:38,680
And one of the top line changes for Firefox 80 is the back button is back based on, quote,

264
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:40,480
feedback from users.

265
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:45,240
And I've been trying this out, 80, and it's not great.

266
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:46,480
I don't want to say that.

267
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:48,360
I want to say it's amazing.

268
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:50,560
I don't need Chrome anymore.

269
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:53,840
But it's just not that good.

270
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:55,040
I had crashes.

271
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:56,620
It was slow.

272
00:15:56,620 --> 00:15:59,240
And it's not just because I'm used to Chrome on Android.

273
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:01,560
It just wasn't a great experience.

274
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:08,040
And I've spoken to people who have been using Firefox for years on Android, and they say

275
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:09,880
that 79 was just a disaster.

276
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:14,960
80 is slightly better, but it's still nowhere near what it was before.

277
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:16,760
It just seems like a misstep for Mozilla.

278
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:23,240
I get why they did it, but I just think that if they had a year to get this right, they

279
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:24,720
should have done a better job.

280
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:25,720
Yeah, that's a shame.

281
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:30,840
And when you say that I buy it, because you are a Firefox guy, so it really is your preferred

282
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:32,240
browser to use if you can.

283
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:34,800
Yeah, on the desktop, it's all about Firefox.

284
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,720
I'm looking at it right now.

285
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:38,800
Yeah, I hope they get this together.

286
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:44,480
I feel like the wheels are coming off a little bit, because this criticism and the general

287
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:49,560
state of Firefox mobile and some of the projects that they had in the oven, they all kind of

288
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:52,080
feel like they were converging on improving the situation.

289
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:56,080
But then a lot of the people involved, as we know, got laid off.

290
00:16:56,080 --> 00:17:00,200
And so it seems like while the product isn't at its best, they've also gotten rid of a

291
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:04,320
lot of people that were working on the bits to make it better.

292
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:09,040
And what we're left with now is maybe a little bit higher in the stack where we're going

293
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:13,080
to get fixes and not some of the fundamentals that may actually be driving the core issues.

294
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:15,760
But at least they've got that Google money now, eh?

295
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:19,240
Maybe I mean, if that keeps it alive, honestly, I'm okay with it.

296
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:20,680
I don't love it.

297
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:26,960
But if Google continues to finance the leverage that allows the web to stay truly open, I

298
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:28,400
can find peace with that.

299
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:32,440
I just don't see Firefox on Android competing.

300
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:33,640
It's just not good enough.

301
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:35,280
I think that on the desktop, it is.

302
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:38,920
I think that there are some things that Chrome does better, there are some things that Firefox

303
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:39,920
does better.

304
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:42,280
But ultimately, I think it's much of a muchness.

305
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:46,800
There are certain websites that don't work in Firefox, but that's not necessarily Mozilla's

306
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:47,800
fault.

307
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:53,600
But for me, it's an easy choice on the desktop, that I will mostly use Firefox and then occasionally

308
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,560
use Chrome for those things that I need.

309
00:17:55,560 --> 00:18:00,520
Whereas on Android, even someone who wants to use Firefox, I used it for a good couple

310
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:01,520
of days.

311
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:05,600
And in the end, I said to myself, I'd use it right up to recording and then see where

312
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:06,600
we are.

313
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:11,040
But in the end, it was at least a day or so ago that I just had enough, I just had to

314
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:13,040
go back to using Chrome.

315
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:18,820
And it's I just can't see people who don't care about software freedom at all, or even

316
00:18:18,820 --> 00:18:20,880
know what that means using it.

317
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:24,700
And so I just I can't see them gaining any traction on mobile.

318
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:27,400
And that is where most of the market is now.

319
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:32,260
You look at the changes they're doing, particularly with mobile and the extension support.

320
00:18:32,260 --> 00:18:37,280
And it's not that I don't appreciate and understand the circumstance and logic.

321
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:43,880
But I think ultimately, when you zoom out, what you see is, in response to Chrome's absolutely

322
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:49,200
crushing market dominance, they just keep trying to go for the average consumer, they're

323
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,600
trying to go for services and the average consumer.

324
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:55,600
And when they look at the usage, they'll say something like, well, you know, in quote,

325
00:18:55,600 --> 00:19:00,480
a small number of our users were using this feature or something like that.

326
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:06,000
And I guess I feel like the thing that they don't value is that market is the boosters,

327
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
they're the advocates.

328
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,720
They're like the most loyal army of Firefox users.

329
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:12,400
They're the people that are going to tell their friends and family and I don't know

330
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:15,880
how they expect browser adoption to work.

331
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:19,380
It's not going to be about going straight at the average consumer.

332
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:23,400
Because you can't compete with a Google ad on every single search result that suggests

333
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:28,760
you try Chrome, or pop ups on Windows 10, encouraging you to set Edge as your default.

334
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:31,580
As Firefox, they just can't compete with that.

335
00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:33,640
That's the lesson Netscape had to learn.

336
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:35,560
And so they've got to go at the technical market.

337
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:40,600
And that's why killing their developer tools and those parts of the company, to me, feel

338
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:45,160
like when you combine that with what seems to be their on surface strategy of Firefox,

339
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:48,440
it makes me think they truly don't get it.

340
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:52,480
And they're just going to continue down this path of going after the mythical new user,

341
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:57,000
that unicorn new user that understands what a web browser is and what the value is and

342
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:01,900
replacing the web browser that comes baked into their operating system of choice, versus

343
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:05,920
going after the technical crowd that's going to be the one deploying it for IT departments,

344
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:08,520
or telling their friends and family to install it.

345
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:12,680
I know it seems silly as a company to go after this tiny market, but this tiny market are

346
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:16,000
your best advocates, and you keep turning away from them.

347
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:21,840
And so my diagnosis is, they're just going to continue on more of the same now, and they

348
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:25,720
will continue to decline, and we will end up in a mono browser culture.

349
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:27,280
Well, we're there, aren't we?

350
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:29,080
We are very nearly there.

351
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:34,840
Our options are what, Chrome or Edge, basically, at this point, and I suppose Safari on the

352
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:35,840
iPhone.

353
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:38,880
I think that's pretty much it, and that's all WebKit or Blink.

354
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:42,640
Yeah, I wish I had more positive things to say about it, but just from what I've seen

355
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:48,160
from Mozilla, it feels like they need to really turn the corner somehow, and I just don't

356
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:52,480
know what that's going to be, but we live in hope, I suppose.

357
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:56,360
We may end up relearning the lessons from Internet Explorer.

358
00:20:56,360 --> 00:21:02,280
Speaking of lessons from the past, James Bottomley, who is the Linux SCSI subsystem maintainer,

359
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:06,680
I'm familiar with his work on Secure Boot and Linux, but he's also a distinguished engineer

360
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:12,880
at IBM Research, has put a post up that he has titled, Lessons from the Gnome Patent

361
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:13,880
Troll Incident.

362
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:19,000
Yeah, and he says that this description is somewhat brief and links to an article by

363
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:24,440
Amanda Brock and Matt Berkovitz, which is a little bit more detailed, but this, I think,

364
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:31,080
is a really good write-up of what happened with it all, because if you recall, Gnome

365
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:36,640
faced a legal challenge from Rothschild patent imaging over Shotwell, over what was quite

366
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:43,960
a spurious patent claim, and Gnome settled with Rothschild, but it wasn't made public

367
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:48,980
what exactly happened there, but there was enough leeway in the settlement for someone

368
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:54,160
to make it public, and now that's exactly what James has done with this post.

369
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:58,940
And it's pretty much what most people expected, I think, but it is interesting to see the

370
00:21:58,940 --> 00:21:59,940
details of it.

371
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:03,840
Yeah, he happened to be in just the perfect legal position.

372
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:08,000
The Gnome Foundation folks and the Shotwell folks, they couldn't release these details

373
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:13,780
themselves, but James can do it because he's released software under an OSI-approved license,

374
00:22:13,780 --> 00:22:18,020
so he's covered by the release and thus entitled to a copy of the agreement under Section 10,

375
00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:21,800
but he's not partied any of the covenants, which means he's not forbidden from disclosing

376
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:22,800
it.

377
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:26,200
It's in the perfect spot, and so he has linked it right at the top of his blog.

378
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:29,180
That right there, full stop, is news.

379
00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:32,760
If this was the entirety of this story, this is actually a pretty big deal because there

380
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:37,620
are a lot of lessons you can learn by just going through this as an open source project,

381
00:22:37,620 --> 00:22:43,080
but what's fantastic is he also did an analysis of the attack, and some of this won't surprise

382
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:44,080
you.

383
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:48,320
He writes a key element of the attack is to offer a settlement licensing for the sum less

384
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:53,600
than it would cost to even get a defense going, a legal defense, which is going to be base,

385
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:57,540
if you're lucky, $50,000, which is how they make money, right, because projects don't

386
00:22:57,540 --> 00:23:01,320
have that kind of money around, and they'll just say, well, why don't we settle?

387
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:06,000
It's going to be cheaper than going to court, and you will go to court.

388
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:11,460
One of the problems he writes is that when a patent is issued by the US Patent Office,

389
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:17,920
the court must presume it is valid, so any case that impunges the validity of the patent

390
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:23,040
can't be decided as a summary judgment, i.e. it has to go to court.

391
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:28,300
In the Gnome case that sued the Project Shotwell, the thing is, even there, Shotwell predated

392
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:33,440
the filing of the patent by several years, so just on its face, it should have been obvious

393
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:40,620
that it wasn't valid, but because the court must presume they're valid, you go, and simply

394
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:44,840
put, it means you're spending money, and probably you're lucky if you're going to get out for

395
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:47,700
under $100,000.

396
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:51,520
And in the case of Shotwell, the Gnome Foundation stepped up in a really big way, but they also

397
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:57,660
had some generous backers come in and offer some legal support, and the community.

398
00:23:57,660 --> 00:24:01,260
And if it wasn't for that, they probably would have had to settle.

399
00:24:01,260 --> 00:24:06,340
And this is, it's just, it's this weak attack that they come after these projects with,

400
00:24:06,340 --> 00:24:09,580
knowing that you can't even afford to take it to court.

401
00:24:09,580 --> 00:24:12,060
Yeah, no wonder everyone settles.

402
00:24:12,060 --> 00:24:16,420
And it just shows how broken the patent system is, at least the software patent system is

403
00:24:16,420 --> 00:24:17,420
in the US.

404
00:24:17,420 --> 00:24:20,380
Yeah, it really doesn't seem like it works for this particular thing.

405
00:24:20,380 --> 00:24:24,260
There were some compromises, and those are outlined in this post, which you can go read

406
00:24:24,260 --> 00:24:29,380
here, but the big takeaway high-level lesson is that troll-based attacks are going to continue

407
00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:34,760
to be a threat to open source, and the one source, Rothschild, may have been neutralized,

408
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:37,700
but others seem like they're going to be following this MO.

409
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:40,980
And maybe one of the bigger lessons to take from this is if these attacks aren't going

410
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:45,540
away, then we need to figure out some way to fund projects so they are not forced into

411
00:24:45,540 --> 00:24:46,600
settling.

412
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:52,340
Maybe it's some sort of community funding that's held by a foundation, something like

413
00:24:52,340 --> 00:24:55,140
this, because otherwise these trolls can just roll in knowing that most of these projects

414
00:24:55,140 --> 00:24:56,140
can't afford this.

415
00:24:56,140 --> 00:25:00,740
And if there's a defense fund that's set up in public and ready to go, like we did 16

416
00:25:00,740 --> 00:25:04,740
years ago when SCO was threatening to sue Linux users, we could potentially do that

417
00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:05,740
again.

418
00:25:05,740 --> 00:25:09,120
And just having that war chest there may prevent companies like Rothschild Patent Imaging from

419
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:10,120
even trying.

420
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:11,120
Maybe.

421
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:12,120
Maybe.

422
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:16,120
But as we saw with BountySource, hanging onto money is not easy.

423
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:19,540
It's kind of relatively straightforward if you've got money coming in and out, but if

424
00:25:19,540 --> 00:25:24,600
it's just money sitting in an account, it makes accounting for that money pretty tricky.

425
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:29,940
So it would need a proper organization to manage it.

426
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:34,740
You can't just have a bunch of people stick money in a PayPal account or whatever.

427
00:25:34,740 --> 00:25:37,460
It takes a lot to get this sorted.

428
00:25:37,460 --> 00:25:42,520
So maybe it is someone like Misr, maybe the Linux Foundation, someone with some clout

429
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:47,020
and respect in the open source industry needs to organize this, I think.

430
00:25:47,020 --> 00:25:49,900
Because otherwise, we're just going to get blindsided again.

431
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:50,900
It's fine.

432
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:54,980
You just hosted on an AWS bottle rocket with blockchain, Joe.

433
00:25:54,980 --> 00:25:55,980
Blockchain.

434
00:25:55,980 --> 00:25:57,980
That's all I got to say, right?

435
00:25:57,980 --> 00:25:58,980
Blockchain.

436
00:25:58,980 --> 00:25:59,980
Yeah, that's a good idea, actually.

437
00:25:59,980 --> 00:26:00,980
Just invest it all in Bitcoin.

438
00:26:00,980 --> 00:26:01,980
Right.

439
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:02,980
That'll definitely work out.

440
00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:03,980
Yeah, what could go wrong?

441
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:05,020
So bottle rocket's a real thing.

442
00:26:05,020 --> 00:26:09,340
It's Amazon's new open source Linux distribution that's built to run containers.

443
00:26:09,340 --> 00:26:14,300
It's designed, they say, to improve security and operations for a containerized infrastructure.

444
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:19,580
And they've done some obvious things here, like use SE Linux and the natural isolations

445
00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:22,680
you get from using namespaces and whatnot with the Linux kernel.

446
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:26,040
But they're also doing other things that I think are kind of neat, like they're using

447
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:30,400
device mappers, Verity Target, a Linux kernel feature that provides integrity checking to

448
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:31,940
help prevent attackers.

449
00:26:31,940 --> 00:26:33,620
They're disabling root logins.

450
00:26:33,620 --> 00:26:38,320
They actually kind of build this whole thing to be centrally managed and discourage administrators

451
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:40,900
actually connecting directly into it.

452
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:43,960
It has a lot of similarities to other projects trying to solve this.

453
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:48,580
But the implication here in this announcement is this has been built based on the needs

454
00:26:48,580 --> 00:26:52,100
they've observed of AWS customers directly.

455
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:56,140
Now I wasn't particularly interested in this when I first read about it because I thought,

456
00:26:56,140 --> 00:27:00,080
well, it's just an AWS thing and no one's going to benefit from it.

457
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:05,660
But then reading into it a bit more, you find out that it's your choice of either MIT or

458
00:27:05,660 --> 00:27:09,540
Apache license and the whole thing is open source.

459
00:27:09,540 --> 00:27:14,000
How useful it's going to be outside of AWS, I don't know.

460
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:19,140
If you plan to use this on prem or on a different cloud provider, then do let us know, linuxactionnews.com

461
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:20,320
slash contact.

462
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:22,080
They're fully taking advantage of GitHub with this one.

463
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:26,960
The project's up there, the issue tracker, their can board with their future project

464
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:28,080
issues on there.

465
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:31,440
And the thing that I thought was interesting is a lot of the stuff above the kernel that

466
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:33,360
they've written is all been done in Rust.

467
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:35,400
Yeah, I thought that would catch your eye.

468
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:37,960
Well, that brings us to the end of this week's news.
