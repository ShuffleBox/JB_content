00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,560
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, episode 152, recorded on April 5th, 2020.

2
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:09,560
I'm Chris.

3
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:10,560
And I'm Joe.

4
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:11,560
Hello, Joe.

5
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:16,200
Good to be connected with you, and great to start with the news of Linux kernel 5.6.

6
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:19,600
It's released, and it's packed full of goodies.

7
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:23,600
The biggest one is WireGuard, finally, it's in the kernel.

8
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:26,360
We've been talking about WireGuard for years, and for good reason.

9
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:28,720
It is a great VPN.

10
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:30,120
We'll get to that in just a second.

11
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:34,300
I'll first mention that the other thing I noticed that landed in this was initial support

12
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:40,120
for USB4, which was contributed by Intel, and is based on their Thunderbolt driver code.

13
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:42,940
This also, for 32-bit users, has some good news.

14
00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:48,560
It's the first kernel that is ready to operate past the year 2038, if you're in 32-bit mode.

15
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:53,360
There's good fixes in there for AMD and NVIDIA graphics stacks, as well as, and you're gonna

16
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:58,960
really appreciate this one, Joe, mainline support for the Amazon Echo smart speaker.

17
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:06,240
I saw that, and I was very surprised by it, because who's running Linux on their Echo

18
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:08,360
smart speaker?

19
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:09,360
Nobody yet.

20
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:13,720
But, I mean, picture a world where Mycroft has developed a little bit further, and now

21
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:18,160
people could repurpose their first and second generation, or whatever it might be, generation

22
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:22,160
Echo hardware, flash it with Linux, and install a Mycroft service on there, and now you got

23
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:23,480
a Mycroft tube.

24
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:25,120
I'd be down for that.

25
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:27,280
Are they even flashable, though?

26
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:30,760
Not yet, but they're getting there.

27
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:33,600
I'm not sure how far you really would want to take this thing yet, because eventually

28
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:37,640
you also have to get the Wi-Fi working, and they don't have full microphone array support

29
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:38,640
at this point.

30
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,440
They have a single mic, and to make this thing really effective, you want the microphone

31
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:42,840
array.

32
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:48,040
I would say it's at least a decent idea, and I'm also always a fan of just getting Linux

33
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:49,340
on all of the things.

34
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:53,600
If it doesn't require a lot of kernel bloat, if it isn't a massive amount of effort, if

35
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:57,760
it's not some crazy architecture they have to maintain forever now, I'm kind of a fan

36
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:58,760
of going for it.

37
00:01:58,760 --> 00:01:59,760
Yeah, I suppose so.

38
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:03,440
Even if it's not Mycroft you're running on it, maybe you could use it with Home Assistant

39
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:06,520
or something like that, if it's running its own proper Linux OS.

40
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:08,960
But you really did mention the big story.

41
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:12,800
The lead for kernel 5.6 is the death of OpenVPN.

42
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:17,120
I kid, but really WireGuard is so great, and I'm a big fan.

43
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:21,200
Jason Donfield has created something that is remarkable.

44
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,480
Version 1.0 is stable.

45
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:28,620
It has been stable for a while, but even more so, it's been recently reviewed professionally

46
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:36,080
to check to see if there's anything misconfigured or improperly developed or designed.

47
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:42,560
And the lead developer, Jason Donfield, commissioned that code base audit in anticipation of it

48
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,560
being included in 5.6.

49
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:48,820
In fact, he writes, I've been neurotic about having the 5.6 kernel ship without any show

50
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:50,080
stopper bugs.

51
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:54,760
WireGuard has been stable for a long time now, but that doesn't make me any less nervous

52
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:57,060
about the real deal in 5.6.

53
00:02:57,060 --> 00:03:02,040
To that end, I've been doing code reviews and having discussions, and we've also had

54
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:04,620
a security firm audit the code.

55
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:09,480
The audit didn't turn up any vulnerabilities, but they did make a good defense in depth

56
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:10,880
suggestion.

57
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:15,280
Jim Salter on Ars Technica has a really good write-up of the new release, and I will also

58
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:17,720
link in his introduction guide.

59
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:22,080
If you've heard us talk about WireGuard, you haven't wrapped your head around it yet, Jim's

60
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,080
got a good piece on that, too.

61
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:26,880
Well, if you're crazy enough to run an Arch server, then you're going to be able to take

62
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:32,960
advantage of this, and no doubt you will be sorting that out with Wes soon, but realistically,

63
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:37,260
is anyone going to be able to use this kernel in an enterprise distro anytime soon?

64
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:38,640
There is that aspect of it.

65
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:42,600
Some great new feature hits the main line Linux kernel, but then it's really a wait

66
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:46,440
around and see how long it takes until it's implemented at the distro level.

67
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:49,480
That is true with the exception of Ubuntu 20.04.

68
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:54,080
I believe Canonical released a statement saying that they would backport WireGuard to the

69
00:03:54,080 --> 00:04:00,360
5.4 kernel they're using, and to that end, there is a WireGuard-Linux-CompatCode branch,

70
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:04,260
which will continue to be maintained so that the WireGuard kernel module can still be deployed

71
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:05,800
to older kernels.

72
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:11,720
So it is still retrofittable, and it's easily solvable with a DKMS-style solution.

73
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:16,160
But as you know, it takes a while to go the DKMS route.

74
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:19,040
Every update is quite a painfully long experience.

75
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:22,760
Yeah, that's why it will be great to just have it baked in upstream.

76
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:26,400
It will take a little bit for the mainline distros to get it, but certain areas will

77
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:30,240
get it soon, and I think the big part that we'll start to see now that it's actually

78
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:33,120
in the kernel is cool projects built around it.

79
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:36,800
There's already a whole bunch that are getting created now, but you'll start to see a bunch

80
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:41,920
of more GUIs that can sit on top of the WireGuard tools, and I would hope, integration with

81
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:46,760
a lot of edge products, like your PFsenses and things like that out there.

82
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:48,640
Plug for OpenSense, by the way.

83
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:54,520
But with 5.6 released, that means that 5.7 is now in the works, and something coming

84
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:58,000
to that is going to be the exFAT driver.

85
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,560
This is the one we've been waiting for.

86
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:05,080
This is the specially Samsung-developed exFAT file system driver that's landing in kernel

87
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:06,080
5.7.

88
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:11,760
Now, if you recall, there was sort of a temporary read-only kind of sketch version that was

89
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:13,840
added in Linux 5.4.

90
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,600
That's going to be swapped out now.

91
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:21,640
So by the time I'm using Xubuntu 22.04 in about three years, it means I'll be able to

92
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:28,320
plug my exFAT-formatted SD cards in and not have to install exFAT Utils and exFAT Fuse.

93
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:31,000
Boy, future Joe's just going to love that.

94
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,240
When you put it that way, it's almost silly.

95
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:38,880
These things take a while, but I'm sure if you've got a Manjaro machine, it'll be a lot

96
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:39,880
sooner than that.

97
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:40,880
Yeah.

98
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:44,760
You could always run, you could go wild and just run one of them interim releases, you

99
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:45,760
know?

100
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:46,760
Throw caution to the wind, Joe.

101
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:49,320
No, I would not do that, I'm afraid.

102
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:52,520
I might test them, but I'm far too sensible for that.

103
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:57,440
Meanwhile, you're talking to a guy who's running the 20.04 dailies right now, and I'm beta testing,

104
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:02,000
I'm trying out the new beta for Fedora as well in a VM because, you know, why not?

105
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:07,440
Well, if you want to check out a beta of Ubuntu Touch, now you can buy a phone with it pre-installed.

106
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:10,560
Not just any phone, a PinePhone, a UBports Community Edition.

107
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:12,480
The pre-orders are open right now.

108
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:17,460
It's a PinePhone as you know it, but this one will not only come pre-loaded with an Ubuntu

109
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:22,680
Touch image, but also a special limited edition Ubuntu Touch back, which is actually kind

110
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:23,680
of cool.

111
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:28,040
Starting on this port, they say in the announcement for essentially 18 months, from the first

112
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:30,680
leggy builds to actually something semi-usable.

113
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:36,820
I don't know if it's quite in the daily driver category yet, but it's improving very quick.

114
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:40,240
And of course, with the PinePhone, you could run anything you could load on there.

115
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:44,400
So this would just be one of the many options you'd have, and hopefully one of the better

116
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:45,400
ones.

117
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:52,220
So this is available for $150 plus shipping, and also potentially import charges and taxes

118
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:53,220
and things.

119
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:54,220
So watch out for that.

120
00:06:54,220 --> 00:07:00,720
But of that $150, $10 will be going to the Ubiports Foundation, which is pretty cool.

121
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:03,880
And my understanding is, there's no reason if I have a Braveheart Edition phone like

122
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:09,880
the one I have here, I could flash it with Ubiports Ubuntu Touch, and it would work fine,

123
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:10,880
right?

124
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:12,400
There's no incompatibilities there?

125
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,560
No, this is a slightly revved version.

126
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:19,080
The motherboard's slightly different, and there's a few small improvements, but as far

127
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:21,800
as I understand it, they are just the same phone.

128
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:27,520
So you can just download an Ubuntu Touch image, flash it on an SD card and boot it up, and

129
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:29,560
you'll have more or less the same experience.

130
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:33,000
I want to see more distributions available for phones like this, especially as hardware

131
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,040
like the PinePhone becomes available.

132
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:36,040
I do want to set expectations.

133
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:37,360
You know, it's not perfect.

134
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,100
Like I said, it's not daily driver yet.

135
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:44,360
And I think the builds that will be released on the phone hardware likely won't have camera

136
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:46,320
support, but I think that's not too far away.

137
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:50,040
I think they have a camera fix coming soon, from what I've seen on Twitter.

138
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:52,200
So I'd say keep your expectations set accordingly.

139
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:57,160
But it's a great device to play around with, and 150 bucks for something like this is remarkable.

140
00:07:57,160 --> 00:08:00,800
And mine, you know, my Braveheart Edition, which is an early build, admittedly, feels

141
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,580
really solid in the hand.

142
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:03,580
Feels like a real device.

143
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:05,500
Yeah, it is a real phone.

144
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:09,880
It's a proper device, but it's not the only phone that you'll be able to get Ubuntu Touch

145
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:12,960
pre-installed on, at least at some point in the future.

146
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:17,700
Yeah, it was sort of buried in all the other news, but they did announce a partnership

147
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:19,880
with the German phone startup, Vala.

148
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:24,000
They write on their blog they're joining forces as a sponsor and will have a place on the

149
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,260
advisory board.

150
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:29,640
They expect that Ubuntu Touch will be available as a pre-installed option on the new Vala

151
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:30,640
phone.

152
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:31,640
How about that?

153
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:34,520
Just when you thought the world had moved on and we were going to be locked into Android

154
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:36,920
and iOS forever.

155
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:40,640
Projects like the PinePhone come along and do what Purism never could.

156
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:46,360
And projects like UbiPorts continue to prove that if they just keep working at it over

157
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:50,720
time, they get it better and better and the hardware is coming to a certain point and

158
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:53,880
the software is coming to a certain point and they are meeting up at this juncture.

159
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:56,880
And it's remarkable to actually see it still continue on.

160
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:59,200
I think it's still in the realm of hobbyists.

161
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,560
And I don't think there's anything wrong with that.

162
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:01,560
There should be.

163
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:02,640
There should be hobbyist devices.

164
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:06,760
These mobile devices are an absolutely critical part of the computing ecosystem.

165
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:09,940
And I think it's really important that we have an option for hobbyists because that's

166
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:11,240
how we learn and push the boundaries.

167
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:17,120
Yeah, I think that it's going to be a while, if ever, before these kind of OSes and phones

168
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,920
replace people's main phones.

169
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:25,120
But I think there are some people who can get by with a relatively limited feature set.

170
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:30,200
And then there are other people who will have this as a second phone to play around with

171
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:32,360
and help improve.

172
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:36,180
I think that's the key thing here that we're still in this testing phase.

173
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:39,800
This is not about competing with Android and iOS necessarily.

174
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:45,400
It's about finding a niche that is separate from those two, which is the same kind of

175
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:48,580
niche where custom ROMs like Lineage sit.

176
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:50,200
They're going all the way to 17.1.

177
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:51,800
And that's actually part of the big news.

178
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:58,060
The Lineage OS 17.1, based on Android 10, is now officially available.

179
00:09:58,060 --> 00:10:02,320
It seems AOSP threw them a few curveballs throughout the development of 17.1.

180
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:07,000
Yeah, and this isn't available for all of the officially supported phones yet, although

181
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:13,360
it is available for mine, but I haven't flushed it yet because that takes half a day at least

182
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:15,560
of setting everything back up again.

183
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:18,760
But yeah, this was a slightly longer development cycle for them.

184
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:25,920
And the reason that it's 17.1 is because they had started work on 17.0, but then they rebased

185
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:30,760
on the Google Pixel 4 branch of Android on Source Project.

186
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:35,760
And so they decided that it made sense to rev it to 17.1.

187
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:40,160
This release also is making the switch to Lineage Recovery as a de facto solution for

188
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:41,920
actually installing the OS.

189
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:46,560
And they've also introduced Permissions Hub, which conflicted with Privacy Guard, so that

190
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:48,480
has had to be dropped.

191
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:54,620
And also, instead of offering official super user binaries that you could flash, now if

192
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:58,120
you want root, you have to go the Magisk root.

193
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:01,920
Now I'm not a Lineage user, Joe, so correct me if I'm wrong, but my understanding is there's

194
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:06,360
essentially a downside that you can still root, but you can't really hide the fact that

195
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:08,040
you're rooted in this new system.

196
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:12,000
Yeah, it's kind of hit and miss with Magisk, depending on the device, as to whether you

197
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,880
can hide the fact that you're rooted and that your bootloader is unlocked.

198
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:19,440
But you could never do that with the old routing method anyway.

199
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,980
It was just a lot simpler.

200
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:24,920
It was just instead of having to interact with Magisk, you just flash this root binary

201
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:28,880
and if you didn't care about hiding it, then it was just simpler.

202
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:29,960
And that's what I always did.

203
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:35,440
So now I'm going to have to use Magisk, which I'm not particularly bothered about, but it's

204
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:36,440
just a bit of difference.

205
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:37,880
You know, I don't like change.

206
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:39,480
I guess, yeah, that's true.

207
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:43,480
But I guess I think about LineageOS and I think, man, it's awesome that it's going so

208
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:49,740
strong and that they took the time to integrate security fixes and do proper rebasing so that

209
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:54,240
when they did ship, it was in a really good state.

210
00:11:54,240 --> 00:12:00,160
But I also still feel like I've been watching the walls close in on the custom ROM community

211
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:05,240
for years and it just seems like it's getting tighter and tighter and tighter and it's very

212
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:07,560
much the boiling frog type approach.

213
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:11,200
It doesn't seem to be that they're startling anyone very fast, but as hardware changes

214
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:15,800
and security requirements ramp up and Google makes architecture changes to Android, then

215
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:21,300
security changes that are paired with hardware features, it to me just seems like the walls

216
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:22,760
are getting in pretty tight now.

217
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:26,600
The oxygen, as they say, is almost out of the room and I can't think of another metaphor

218
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:29,160
I could throw in there, but I think you get where I'm going.

219
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:30,760
Yeah, I think you're right though.

220
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:37,720
I think that in another five, 10 years maybe, things like Lineage won't be possible on most

221
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:38,720
phones.

222
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:44,320
I think that it'll still probably be around for legacy devices that are out of support,

223
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:49,200
but the newer phones that come along, well, they're just getting more and more locked

224
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,200
down, as you say.

225
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:56,560
I don't think that that is Google and OEMs necessarily wanting to make the custom ROM

226
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:57,840
scene go away.

227
00:12:57,840 --> 00:13:01,760
It's just them not caring about it and just caring more about these security features,

228
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:07,080
which ultimately close down the platform even more, which is sad.

229
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:12,040
It's good that we've got projects like the PinePhone which are open, but that's not exactly

230
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:13,040
flagship hardware.

231
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:14,400
It's a $150 phone.

232
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:18,540
It's low-end and I think you're right that ultimately you're going to either have the

233
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:23,920
hobbyist phones or you'll just have to use whatever ROM it comes with, which is sad.

234
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:24,920
It's sad.

235
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:28,240
It's always been a little bit like Linux, hasn't it?

236
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:34,160
In that you can buy a PC, a laptop or whatever, and just install whatever distro you want

237
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:38,440
on it, whereas with mobile hardware, with iPhones it's always been the case, but with

238
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:43,400
Android phones, at least some of them, like the Nexus phones or whatever, were fully

239
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:49,600
supported by these ROMs and Google made it easy for projects like Lineage to get their

240
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:54,840
ROMs going on there, whereas now that seems to be a thing of the past.

241
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:57,480
That's the line of thinking I had with this as well.

242
00:13:57,480 --> 00:14:01,600
I also thought it just underscores the importance of things like the PinePhone.

243
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:06,960
It seems though like the PinePhone is developing at a rate faster than I expected and the software

244
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:09,960
around it is developing at a rate faster than I expected.

245
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:13,700
Maybe I came out a little cynical at this point because I've seen these phone attempts

246
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:20,760
so many times now, but it does give me hope that Lineage maybe, Lineage on that thing,

247
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:24,360
Ubuntu Touch on there, Mangero Mobile Edition on there.

248
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:28,960
I know that there's even conversations around the Fedora project to get parts of Fedora

249
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:30,300
working on the PinePhone.

250
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:35,480
It's happening and it's happening faster than I expected because really we're only like

251
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:39,240
1.5 hardware iterations into the PinePhone right now.

252
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:44,320
Yeah, you would assume that there will be newer, more powerful versions in the future

253
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:49,200
because it looks like it's being relatively successful within the niche that we're talking

254
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:50,560
about here.

255
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:57,360
I'm really hoping that is going to be something that continues because I think if you're a

256
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:04,440
hardware company like Pine64 that just puts their hands up and says, we're not here to

257
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:09,000
make software, we're not going to pay a whole team of developers, but we're going to help

258
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:14,200
you, we're going to work with you, the community, to make these ROMs happen.

259
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:17,240
That seems to be the right approach to it to me.

260
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:21,520
The market seems to have shown us this approach, I mean it's not directly comparable, but it

261
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:25,740
seems similar to the way PC manufacturers over the years operated.

262
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:29,560
They didn't create Windows or they didn't create the Linux distro they installed on

263
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:31,120
there typically.

264
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:35,960
Traditionally they would create hardware, they'd work with Microsoft to create drivers

265
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:39,200
and then they would ship that and support that and they would focus on the hardware

266
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:42,280
and Microsoft would focus on the software.

267
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:46,040
Those lines of course have all been blurred now because Microsoft has hardware and there's

268
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:51,180
Linux distros that are created by the OEMs directly and you know, it's all blurred now,

269
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:55,880
but it does seem to have been a model that was successful for a long time and made guys

270
00:15:55,880 --> 00:16:02,040
like Michael Dell very rich and there's still a huge market in there in that business model

271
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:07,120
and I could see it applying to the PinePhone, especially if the enthusiast market continues

272
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:15,640
to grow and operating systems like Lineage, imagine a scenario Joe, imagine Lineage having

273
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:19,960
top performance like best hardware support, best apps.

274
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:24,800
You could put a Lineage image on the PinePhone and it just rocked everything.

275
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:29,660
I would do that, I would do that in a heartbeat and I would probably be the first time I became

276
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:32,080
a regular user of Lineage OS.

277
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:36,300
Not because I have any problem against it, it's just if I spend a lot of money on a thousand

278
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:39,920
dollar Android device, I want it to be fully supported and I'm going to run the software

279
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:41,880
they put on there because it better well damn be good.

280
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:43,380
Yeah, I know what you mean.

281
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:49,560
My installation, Lineage 16 on my OnePlus 3T is pretty broken right now to the point

282
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:53,620
where often when I get a notification, I swipe down and then I click on it, say it's a Telegram

283
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:59,520
message and then I just get a black screen and I have to then kill Telegram or whatever

284
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:01,280
and restart the app to get it.

285
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:06,620
It's in a terrible state and you know, that's because I've done all sorts to it probably

286
00:17:06,620 --> 00:17:12,560
and that's why when I do this 17.1 update, I'm just going to do wipe and completely start

287
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:15,520
again and hopefully not have these problems.

288
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:19,320
And yeah, Lineage in my experience is a little bit buggy and according to Poppy, he tried

289
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:23,620
Lineage on the 3T and said it was slower than the official ROM, but I've never tried the

290
00:17:23,620 --> 00:17:24,620
official ROM.

291
00:17:24,620 --> 00:17:25,920
The first thing I did was wipe it when I got it.

292
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:28,700
So I don't know, but I do see what you mean.

293
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:32,960
As for Lineage on the PinePhone, there's no reason why it couldn't happen, but as far

294
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:36,980
as I know, there are no Android ROMs available because the point of the project was that

295
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:40,560
it was proper GNU slash Linux operating systems.

296
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:43,540
So I don't think there's been a huge push to put Android on it.

297
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:45,660
I'd love to check it out.

298
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:50,760
So if anyone does know of an Android ROM that I can flash on the PinePhone, then do let

299
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:51,760
me know.

300
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:53,640
But I think that hasn't happened yet.

301
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:54,640
Yeah, fair enough.

302
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:55,640
That makes sense.

303
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:58,800
And I think if something like the PinePhone is successful, I'd like to be able to run

304
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:00,280
any OS I want on there.

305
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:05,560
And because the hardware is reasonable and documented and easy for projects to get their

306
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:08,560
hands on, it seems like it could actually happen.

307
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:12,640
And maybe the big news out of Huawei this week accelerates some of this.

308
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:17,060
Yeah, Huawei have joined the Open Invention Network, which is essentially an organization

309
00:18:17,060 --> 00:18:21,920
that lets companies join and cross-license their patents royalty-free, patents of course

310
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:25,720
to do with the Linux system, whatever that exactly means.

311
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:29,240
Yeah, the definition, which is something that changes from time to time.

312
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:34,240
It was actually adjusted when Microsoft joined back in October of 2018.

313
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:35,840
That's how long ago that was.

314
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:39,040
No, that was only a couple of months ago, wasn't it?

315
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:40,120
No, no, no.

316
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:41,120
I thought so too.

317
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:43,960
In fact, I wasn't even sure if it was this year, or if it was maybe late last year.

318
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:48,400
Looked it up and Nat Friedman announced it in October of 2018.

319
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:49,400
Pretty wild.

320
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:54,640
Huawei joining is a big deal because not only do they agree to cross-license their patents,

321
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:59,680
but they also agree that they won't assert any patent infringement against each other.

322
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:03,820
And Huawei has a huge portfolio, as you might imagine.

323
00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:10,080
The Open Invention Network, OIN's CEO, told The Register in an interview that he was,

324
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:11,320
quote, delighted.

325
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:16,080
It's probably one of the top five companies that we've been chasing for quite some time.

326
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:19,360
I think my first conversations with Huawei were nine years ago.

327
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:21,280
Back then, they weren't doing that much in open source.

328
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:25,180
But in the last six and a half years, they've become very committed to open source and a

329
00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:29,960
very active member of the board of the Linux Foundation.

330
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:35,640
They go on to say, Joe, as far as equipment suppliers go, Huawei has been a model.

331
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:39,720
Now, I'm just blown away by this because of the political situation where companies in

332
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:44,340
the U.S. are not permitted to work with Huawei, but this sort of seems like a backdoor way

333
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:45,340
to do it.

334
00:19:45,340 --> 00:19:49,760
Yeah, because with Huawei's Android phones, they're not allowed to ship any of the Google

335
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:54,580
proprietary stuff, but they are allowed to base it on Android open source.

336
00:19:54,580 --> 00:19:58,880
So it kind of makes sense that they want to get more heavily involved in the open source

337
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:03,820
side of things because even from a PR point of view, it's a good move.

338
00:20:03,820 --> 00:20:06,660
And there'll probably be practical benefits as well.

339
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:11,360
We also know they're making big investments in their Harmony OS and in their IoT arm.

340
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:13,000
So that will be really interesting.

341
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,120
Plus they're a big arm shop.

342
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:18,780
They have very sophisticated camera assemblies, all of this.

343
00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:19,780
It could have very big implications.

344
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:24,400
And you also wonder if there's some patent suits now that are going to get upended, perhaps

345
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:25,400
canceled.

346
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:29,380
Yeah, you have to wonder what's going to happen with the Verizon suit that they filed.

347
00:20:29,380 --> 00:20:31,240
Maybe they might back out of that.

348
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:38,160
The OIN CEO added in their quote, it's important that open source software cuts across geopolitical

349
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:39,160
boundaries.

350
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:40,160
I kind of agree.

351
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:44,540
I like that they weren't, I don't know if the right word is to say like scared out of

352
00:20:44,540 --> 00:20:48,080
doing this, but that they were brave enough to go forward even given the political situation

353
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,520
because it's undoubtedly a massive contribution.

354
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:51,840
Yeah, you never know.

355
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:55,680
Maybe the likes of Amazon and Samsung might join as well.

356
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:57,960
It's certainly what the OIN wants.

357
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:02,600
They worry about giant corporations like Samsung and Amazon joining their network.

358
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:07,480
I worry about possibly never receiving my Atari VCS console.

359
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:09,240
This has been quite the saga, hasn't it?

360
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:11,000
How long ago was it that you backed this thing?

361
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
I was wondering.

362
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
I was going to look it up.

363
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:16,800
I'm not positive, but I think it was 227 years ago.

364
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:25,600
I think it was what, summer of 2018 and it was supposed to ship in summer of 2019.

365
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:29,560
And I don't know about you, but it's getting pretty warm in London.

366
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:33,480
Feels like summer 2020 to me and you still don't have it.

367
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:36,040
I'm starting to wonder if I'll ever get it.

368
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:40,640
The Xbox co-creator, Rob Wyatt, we've talked about him before and his company Tin Giant

369
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:45,000
is now suing Atari because he says that they owe him more than $261,000.

370
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:51,880
Yeah, he's alleging breach of contract and defamation from them saying that he never

371
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:54,720
did the work properly and that's why they didn't pay him.

372
00:21:54,720 --> 00:22:00,480
So even if Atari wins this, it's going to probably take quite a long time and cost quite

373
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:02,440
a lot of money.

374
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:05,080
And so you assume that's going to delay things a little bit.

375
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:11,360
They do say that they've got a number of them ready to go, but obviously all of the supply

376
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:16,600
chain problems that we've seen are slowing it down, but it just seems to be a lot of

377
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:17,800
excuses from them.

378
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:18,800
Yeah.

379
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:19,800
Okay.

380
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:23,320
So they did just post an update on their Medium blog before all this lawsuit stuff kind of

381
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:27,960
erupted on March 19th and it reads right here at the top, we have confirmed delivery of

382
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:32,600
enough parts by the end of March to build our first 500 Atari VCS production units.

383
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:38,680
A good portion of those first Atari VCS units are earmarked as dev kits for more developers.

384
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:43,840
We believe it would be unfair to use the balance to fulfill only a small number of IndieGoGo

385
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:44,840
orders.

386
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:51,520
So Atari's plan is to ship to all backers at the same time when enough VCS units and

387
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:54,640
peripherals are available.

388
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:57,840
But there's no timing on that because, you know, coronavirus.

389
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:00,040
Yeah, which is a bit strange.

390
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:06,960
Only you can just look at who was the first to back the project and send them their console

391
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:13,040
because isn't that the whole point of crowdfunding to get in early and get it before anyone else?

392
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:17,920
Whenever a crowd funder has a hardware delay and they're not being upfront and honest,

393
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:24,120
there is usually language in here that is a little bit suspicious.

394
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:28,720
When they write, we believe it would be unfair to use the balance to fulfill only a small

395
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:30,600
number of IndieGoGo orders.

396
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:38,120
So Atari's plan is to a wait for an arbitrary date for be an arbitrary number of both VCS

397
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:41,280
units and all of the peripherals become available.

398
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:46,040
Those are three different milestones in one sentence that they cannot commit to any times

399
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:47,040
on.

400
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:53,540
And this is such a typical weasel community backed community funded type update where

401
00:23:53,540 --> 00:23:56,860
they weasel in the words there a little bit and they make it sound like they're doing

402
00:23:56,860 --> 00:23:58,360
the best thing for their backers.

403
00:23:58,360 --> 00:24:02,600
We don't want to be unfair, so we're not going to ship to anybody.

404
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:06,320
Really after all this time, you're not desperate to have people making YouTube videos and posting

405
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:09,280
pictures of it on Reddit and Twitter saying it's alive.

406
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:10,320
It's really coming.

407
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:14,240
That wouldn't directly benefit everything you're doing to have some hype built and have

408
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:15,960
actual units out in the field.

409
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:16,960
Really?

410
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:17,960
I'm not buying that.

411
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:22,040
Well, the generous reading of it would be that it's a bad business decision to hang

412
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:24,600
on to those finished consoles and not ship them.

413
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:30,920
A more cynical person might question the veracity of their claim that they have those units.

414
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:31,920
Yes.

415
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:32,920
Yes.

416
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:37,280
Now, because I've spent my heart and money on this, I'm getting in the cynical category.

417
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:41,940
And with Rob Wyatt's having to sue them, I mean, the guy's the co-creator of the Xbox

418
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:45,560
and these units, if they're getting so close to ship, they must have gotten that work done

419
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:46,560
somehow.

420
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:47,560
Did somebody else do that work?

421
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:48,560
What's the story there?

422
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:50,120
Why isn't Atari being upfront about that?

423
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:53,280
Just saying it just doesn't pass the smell test anymore.

424
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:54,280
Yeah.

425
00:24:54,280 --> 00:25:00,960
Now, this was going to be this cool Linux-based console that looks like the old Atari and

426
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:05,100
even have the joystick controller and everything.

427
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:07,960
But this dream seems to be fading.

428
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:10,120
See, I think it's still going to ship.

429
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:15,320
It'll just be horribly underwhelming, poorly executed, and die off in the first generation.

430
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:17,680
And it'll be, of course, super late.

431
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:18,680
But it'll ship.

432
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:20,040
And I'll have the hardware.

433
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:23,280
And if nothing else, maybe I can just put desktop Linux on it.

434
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:24,280
Maybe.

435
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:26,240
Who knows what route they're going to go.

436
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:29,840
They were originally going to make it quite securely locked down so you could boot a live

437
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:30,840
Linux on it.

438
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:36,320
But it seems the plans have changed so much that it'll end up being just a regular x86

439
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:41,800
box with a skinned version of Ubuntu, probably, that hopefully you'll be able to replace with

440
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:44,200
just regular Ubuntu with Kodi or something.

441
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:45,400
It'd actually be pretty great.

442
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:47,800
That'd be pretty nice if I could make a media center box.

443
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:49,720
It's a nice looking rig.

444
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:51,680
You know, the guy's already spent the money for it, Joe.

445
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:52,680
So why not?

446
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:56,440
It's not like I'm making a bad purchase now.

447
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:57,440
I already did that.

448
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:58,440
Yeah.

449
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:00,280
Just think what you could have done.

450
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:03,440
Just imagine if you'd invested that money in Bitcoin back then, how much it'd be worth

451
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:04,440
now.

452
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:05,440
Oh, that stings.

453
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:06,440
Why?

454
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:07,440
Why?

455
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:08,440
Why?

456
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:09,440
Why?

457
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:10,440
Why?

458
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:11,440
Why?

459
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:12,440
Why?

460
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:13,440
Why?

461
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:14,440
Why?

462
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:15,440
Why?

463
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:16,440
Why?

464
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:17,440
Why?

465
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:18,440
Why?

466
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:19,440
Why?

467
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:20,440
Why?

468
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:21,440
Why?

469
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:22,440
Why?

470
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:26,960
We'll be back next Monday with our weekly take on the latest Linux and open source news.

471
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:28,700
You can find me at chrislats.com.

472
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:30,840
You can find me at trellrest.com.

473
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:32,840
Thanks for joining us.

474
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:33,840
We'll see you next week.

475
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:35,840
See you later
