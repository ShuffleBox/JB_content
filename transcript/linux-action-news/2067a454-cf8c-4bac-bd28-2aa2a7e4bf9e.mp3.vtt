Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, our weekly take on Linux and the open source world.

00:15.980 --> 00:20.720
This is episode 24, recorded on October 22nd, 2017.

00:20.720 --> 00:21.720
I'm Chris.

00:21.720 --> 00:22.720
And I'm Joe.

00:22.720 --> 00:23.720
Hello, Joe.

00:23.720 --> 00:27.520
It's good to be with you again, and for the first time ever, Samsung is kicking off our

00:27.520 --> 00:28.880
news lineup this week.

00:28.880 --> 00:33.380
Indeed, they are, and dare we use the word convergence?

00:33.380 --> 00:35.360
That's pretty much what we're talking about here.

00:35.360 --> 00:41.680
So a few months ago, they announced the DEX Dock, D-E-X, I think that's how you say it,

00:41.680 --> 00:48.600
which allows you to put the S8 or the S8 Plus into a dock and then have what is essentially

00:48.600 --> 00:53.640
the same as Remix OS, which is Android with a proper desktop, windowed applications, that

00:53.640 --> 00:55.720
sort of thing, which was quite interesting.

00:55.720 --> 01:00.920
But now, Samsung have said that using that dock and one of their phones, you will soon

01:00.920 --> 01:08.280
be able to run proper GNU slash desktop Linux, which is suddenly much more interesting to

01:08.280 --> 01:09.280
me.

01:09.280 --> 01:12.200
And it does make the price of their higher end phones a little more palatable if you

01:12.200 --> 01:14.280
could use it as a desktop too.

01:14.280 --> 01:20.040
Samsung says their ideal customer here is the developer for Linux on Galaxy, as they

01:20.040 --> 01:21.040
put it.

01:21.040 --> 01:25.120
And they say they can now set up a fully functional development environment with all the advantages

01:25.120 --> 01:29.260
of a desktop setting that is accessible anytime, anywhere.

01:29.260 --> 01:31.540
And this is specifically in the Samsung announcement about it.

01:31.540 --> 01:36.080
So the only requirements are an S8 and a DEX Dock.

01:36.080 --> 01:39.760
And then once they ship this future Android update, whenever that is, we don't have any

01:39.760 --> 01:44.120
details on that, they claim you'll be able to choose the distro that suits you best.

01:44.120 --> 01:47.680
Yeah, and I'll be using the Linux kernel from Android.

01:47.680 --> 01:50.320
So there'll be slightly less overhead there.

01:50.320 --> 01:54.200
To be honest, this sounds an awful lot like Maru OS to me.

01:54.200 --> 01:57.640
So it sounds like containerization of Linux, essentially, right?

01:57.640 --> 02:01.680
You'll use the same kernel, you'll share a modern Linux kernel, you'll run things not

02:01.680 --> 02:05.320
in virtualization, but more like in parallel to Android.

02:05.320 --> 02:06.520
Is that your take on it?

02:06.520 --> 02:11.040
Well, yeah, exactly like Maru does already, which no one seems to talk about in these

02:11.040 --> 02:12.760
articles about this Samsung thing.

02:12.760 --> 02:16.640
Well, if Maru was worth billions of dollars like Samsung is, perhaps people will be talking

02:16.640 --> 02:17.640
about it more.

02:17.640 --> 02:21.440
I mean, the reason why this is a story is because these are mainstream consumer devices

02:21.440 --> 02:23.400
and this is a mainstream consumer company.

02:23.400 --> 02:27.920
Well, yeah, it doesn't get much more mainstream when it comes to phones, apart from iPhones,

02:27.920 --> 02:28.960
than Samsung ones.

02:28.960 --> 02:35.920
So it's interesting to see that they are targeting developers like this because really, it's

02:35.920 --> 02:38.880
just for normal people, the Samsung phones, right?

02:38.880 --> 02:44.240
So you'd think that there wouldn't be that much of their market would be developers.

02:44.240 --> 02:50.480
I don't see why, unless it's kind of a longer term goal that they've got for conversions.

02:50.480 --> 02:54.360
I actually think what you're picking up on is their very problem they're trying to fix.

02:54.360 --> 02:57.920
They don't have a strong developer geeky audience.

02:57.920 --> 03:03.020
A lot of those people are probably buying iPhones or Pixels, in most cases, in the States

03:03.020 --> 03:04.020
at least.

03:04.020 --> 03:05.020
Yeah, the OnePlus phones.

03:05.020 --> 03:07.600
Yeah, yeah, I should also mention those.

03:07.600 --> 03:10.840
There is a category of phones that are a little geekier that are being bought.

03:10.840 --> 03:13.080
I shouldn't just single out the Pixel.

03:13.080 --> 03:17.920
And I think this is Samsung's attempt to say, hey, come over here and check us out.

03:17.920 --> 03:20.780
We offer something the other guys don't.

03:20.780 --> 03:23.480
But to me, it comes across as a little tone deaf.

03:23.480 --> 03:26.780
Because any developer that's going to want to get serious work done remotely is going

03:26.780 --> 03:28.260
to have a laptop with them.

03:28.260 --> 03:32.620
It's just the keyboard, the monitor, everything all built into one device.

03:32.620 --> 03:33.760
It's kind of a long shot.

03:33.760 --> 03:35.960
And to me, it seems a little tone deaf.

03:35.960 --> 03:38.840
Their bigger customer market is going to be probably people more like you and I who just

03:38.840 --> 03:42.760
want to have a productive workstation on the go and are not trying to write apps.

03:42.760 --> 03:46.700
We don't have some crazy high performance requirement relative to what a smartphone

03:46.700 --> 03:47.700
can offer.

03:47.700 --> 03:51.200
Well, yeah, maybe people who just need to SSH into some servers and therefore all they

03:51.200 --> 03:52.200
need is a terminal.

03:52.200 --> 03:53.200
Yeah.

03:53.200 --> 03:54.200
And a keyboard.

03:54.200 --> 03:56.800
But I suppose, again, yeah, maybe they just use a laptop.

03:56.800 --> 04:00.640
So it may be there isn't a huge market for it, but I am interested in it.

04:00.640 --> 04:04.320
And I'm very interested to see how much of it's going to be open source when this comes

04:04.320 --> 04:05.320
out.

04:05.320 --> 04:10.600
Because Android, the underlying system is open source, at least most of it.

04:10.600 --> 04:17.200
And the containerization, surely they'll be using something like LexD or LexC to do this.

04:17.200 --> 04:22.020
But you would think that they're going to have to open source at least some of it.

04:22.020 --> 04:25.340
Typically my response to a story like this would be skeptical.

04:25.340 --> 04:27.360
And I am predominantly skeptical.

04:27.360 --> 04:30.200
But there are a few things that line up in Samsung's favor.

04:30.200 --> 04:32.440
First of all, the S8 is a well-selling device.

04:32.440 --> 04:37.400
Second of all, the DeX, the little dock that's required, is a well-reviewed functional selling

04:37.400 --> 04:38.400
device.

04:38.400 --> 04:41.600
So the main components are already in the marketplace.

04:41.600 --> 04:42.920
It's all software at this point.

04:42.920 --> 04:47.960
So it is achievable, and it may actually be achieved.

04:47.960 --> 04:52.240
When and how much of it, like you said, is open source, that's what remains to be seen

04:52.240 --> 04:54.240
because we don't have details on any of that stuff.

04:54.240 --> 04:57.840
Yeah, and I think crucially that DeX stock is affordable as well.

04:57.840 --> 04:59.760
It's like 50, 60 bucks, something like that.

04:59.760 --> 05:03.440
So you're not having to shell out hundreds and hundreds to make this work.

05:03.440 --> 05:06.880
So I think that adoption, well, I'm tempted.

05:06.880 --> 05:10.640
If I had the Samsung phone in the first place, then I would be, it's a no-brainer I would

05:10.640 --> 05:11.640
have it.

05:11.640 --> 05:15.040
It's making me think twice about maybe getting hold of one of these Samsung phones, but they

05:15.040 --> 05:17.160
are just so expensive.

05:17.160 --> 05:21.280
Well consider saving your pennies, Joe, and perhaps purchase a Purism laptop.

05:21.280 --> 05:27.640
They've announced that future Librem laptops will ship with the Intel management engine

05:27.640 --> 05:29.440
disabled by default.

05:29.440 --> 05:33.920
Now Chris, the first thing that pops into my head here is can we hire their PR department

05:33.920 --> 05:39.040
please to promote JB because they are doing such an excellent job.

05:39.040 --> 05:42.560
Every week they're in the news doing something that is interesting.

05:42.560 --> 05:44.280
That's actually newsworthy in itself.

05:44.280 --> 05:47.640
How many open source projects do you know of that crush it like this when it comes to

05:47.640 --> 05:48.760
the PR cycle?

05:48.760 --> 05:53.920
And because of their success, you're seeing projects that want to attach with that rising

05:53.920 --> 05:54.920
tide.

05:54.920 --> 05:59.320
So we've had the plasma mobile folks come along, GNOME folks have made announcements,

05:59.320 --> 06:01.200
and now Nextcloud is making announcements.

06:01.200 --> 06:06.800
And when's the last time we've seen these well-established, well-known open source projects

06:06.800 --> 06:12.840
rally together like this, oh, and I'm leaving out Matrix, which is a huge component of this.

06:12.840 --> 06:17.840
There is a real success story here in how they're messaging and how these really large,

06:17.840 --> 06:23.440
well-known, quote unquote, open source brands, and I use that debug term very loosely, are

06:23.440 --> 06:27.600
coming together around this effort that Purism has.

06:27.600 --> 06:30.220
And it's really, it works for everyone.

06:30.220 --> 06:32.080
It seems to be playing to everyone's strengths.

06:32.080 --> 06:33.080
This is kind of unprecedented.

06:33.080 --> 06:37.080
Well, it feels a little bit like the early days of Ubuntu, doesn't it?

06:37.080 --> 06:44.680
Where suddenly, there was this buzz and excitement about getting open source to the masses and

06:44.680 --> 06:49.600
talking about 100 million devices or whatever it was, and Ubuntu fridges.

06:49.600 --> 06:52.080
And okay, most of that never came to pass.

06:52.080 --> 06:56.360
But at the same time, there was that buzz and excitement.

06:56.360 --> 07:01.720
And now Ubuntu has kind of established an old hat on its way to becoming a public company.

07:01.720 --> 07:08.240
And now you've got Purism coming up in the market, being this exciting new freedom-loving

07:08.240 --> 07:15.680
company that is just on this mission to promote software freedom and open source, although

07:15.680 --> 07:17.440
they don't call it that.

07:17.440 --> 07:19.940
It feels like an echo of that time to me.

07:19.940 --> 07:22.460
That's definitely a positive take on it, and I hope you are right.

07:22.460 --> 07:27.000
So to break it down a little, you have positive technologies in the mix here.

07:27.000 --> 07:30.920
They're the research group that really did all of the heavy lifting on breaking this

07:30.920 --> 07:32.180
management engine.

07:32.180 --> 07:36.000
And there's a bigger backstory to this, and I'm really glad that Purism is riding this

07:36.000 --> 07:41.840
wave because the bigger backstory here is Intel with Skylake made a switch in the architecture

07:41.840 --> 07:43.240
of the management engine.

07:43.240 --> 07:49.340
And they went from some crazy ARM-ARC system or whatever, I have very little understanding,

07:49.340 --> 07:55.000
to an x86-based management system using the Intel Edison chips.

07:55.000 --> 08:00.640
And that makes it significantly easier for hackers and people who want to exploit the

08:00.640 --> 08:05.720
management engine to find exploits, because now it's x86 and all of your tools that work

08:05.720 --> 08:09.760
on the x86 chip to take apart stuff work on this management engine.

08:09.760 --> 08:14.080
So the pace has really picked up, plus we've just had recent vulnerabilities that Intel

08:14.080 --> 08:17.700
had to patch, which has added a lot of interest to this.

08:17.700 --> 08:23.560
But it does leave me wondering if this success is limited to the Skylake systems right now,

08:23.560 --> 08:28.040
because this took an unbelievable amount of engineering to trick this thing into booting

08:28.040 --> 08:31.560
in a way that allowed it to continue to boot even though not all the components are present.

08:31.560 --> 08:37.880
And I have seen some skepticism that because it's basically a black box, that processor,

08:37.880 --> 08:43.760
that it might just be reporting that the management engine hasn't loaded when really it has.

08:43.760 --> 08:47.660
And there's basically no way to know that because it's completely proprietary.

08:47.660 --> 08:49.200
They've really done a lot of poking around.

08:49.200 --> 08:53.400
I want to give them the benefit of the doubt, but this success will be unique to Skylake

08:53.400 --> 08:58.120
unless Intel has kept this management engine essentially the same between architecture

08:58.120 --> 09:01.400
improvements and updates, which is doubtful.

09:01.400 --> 09:03.800
But then again, I guess now they have this head start, they might be able to keep up

09:03.800 --> 09:08.200
with the pace, but I wouldn't be surprised if in a couple of generations or the next

09:08.200 --> 09:12.760
generation when Purism is offering updated laptops with new Intel chips in them, if they

09:12.760 --> 09:18.040
are unable to offer this management engine disabled initially, but then could perhaps

09:18.040 --> 09:22.040
later on offer a firmware update to their existing customers and say, we're committed

09:22.040 --> 09:27.080
to working on this, and if we crack it, we'll issue a firmware update because apparently

09:27.080 --> 09:31.360
the Librem 15 that I now own, which doesn't have the management engine disabled, will

09:31.360 --> 09:35.540
be receiving a firmware update that I can elect to apply, which will disable it retroactively

09:35.540 --> 09:36.540
for me.

09:36.540 --> 09:37.540
Yeah.

09:37.540 --> 09:42.520
And if you put your open source dreamer hat on for a second and just think about Intel

09:42.520 --> 09:49.920
needs some pressure put on them by the market in order to stop selling processors that are

09:49.920 --> 09:54.000
basically full of blobs, proprietary blobs.

09:54.000 --> 09:58.560
And the only way that they're going to stop doing that is through market forces.

09:58.560 --> 10:07.520
And so you need a company who's great at marketing like Purism to convince people that it matters.

10:07.520 --> 10:14.080
And that's the first step in making Intel realize that it matters to the point where

10:14.080 --> 10:18.600
people care enough to maybe stop buying their products.

10:18.600 --> 10:24.740
And with the rise of ARM, Intel are in a position now, okay, at the moment, they're still dominant

10:24.740 --> 10:28.600
in basically everything but embedded systems, including phones.

10:28.600 --> 10:31.720
But how long is that necessarily going to last?

10:31.720 --> 10:37.560
And unless they start taking this stuff seriously and taking privacy concerns seriously, which

10:37.560 --> 10:43.280
seem to be growing, certainly within the industry, maybe not normal people who just buy a phone

10:43.280 --> 10:47.980
and whatever or buy a laptop and don't care about it, but the kind of people who are fitting

10:47.980 --> 10:53.160
out data centers with potentially millions of dollars worth of Intel products are starting

10:53.160 --> 10:54.900
to take note of this stuff.

10:54.900 --> 11:00.880
And if Intel don't start addressing some of those concerns, then it could ultimately be

11:00.880 --> 11:01.880
the end of them.

11:01.880 --> 11:03.920
And this is a sweet spot for Purism.

11:03.920 --> 11:07.100
And it's something they can really focus in on.

11:07.100 --> 11:11.280
And I would encourage them still to consider dropping PureOS.

11:11.280 --> 11:16.360
I think if you were to ship a mainstream Linux distribution with hardware that now is well

11:16.360 --> 11:21.040
built, has physical kill switches for the radios, and ships with the Intel management

11:21.040 --> 11:25.480
engine disabled, the only negative on that checklist of features now is your own homebrew

11:25.480 --> 11:26.480
OS.

11:26.480 --> 11:30.720
And if you just offered a few options or just committed to one distribution of mainline

11:30.720 --> 11:34.200
distributions, it's a really compelling package and offering.

11:34.200 --> 11:38.200
But honestly, the kind of person who's going to buy this, they're going to immediately

11:38.200 --> 11:40.160
reload it with Arch or whatever.

11:40.160 --> 11:41.280
Yep, 100%.

11:41.280 --> 11:45.160
So why even waste the resources and invest the time in PureOS and instead focus your

11:45.160 --> 11:46.920
energy on other efforts?

11:46.920 --> 11:48.680
Just ship it with Trisco, maybe.

11:48.680 --> 11:49.680
There you go.

11:49.680 --> 11:51.560
I mean, legitimately, that could work.

11:51.560 --> 11:56.040
If nothing else, I understand they want to have it as a differentiating aspect of the

11:56.040 --> 11:57.460
Librem laptops.

11:57.460 --> 12:01.240
And it may be that things like this Next story play into that.

12:01.240 --> 12:04.880
Perhaps they want to ship PureOS because they want to be able to bundle things by default,

12:04.880 --> 12:05.880
like Next Cloud.

12:05.880 --> 12:10.920
Yeah, so we reported on this, I think, a couple of weeks ago, the end-to-end encryption, which

12:10.920 --> 12:15.000
is coming to Next Cloud imminently.

12:15.000 --> 12:21.720
And now Purism have partnered with Next Cloud to ship it on their machines.

12:21.720 --> 12:26.760
So again, excellent PR synergy, I suppose you would say here.

12:26.760 --> 12:31.800
Attach themselves to a company and project that is incredibly popular and privacy focused

12:31.800 --> 12:34.460
and seems to share a lot of the same goals as them.

12:34.460 --> 12:37.180
And so it just seems to be a very good fit for them.

12:37.180 --> 12:38.180
I agree.

12:38.180 --> 12:41.300
And there is implications of future collaboration.

12:41.300 --> 12:45.360
In the announcement on Purism's website, there's just one paragraph.

12:45.360 --> 12:49.280
And partway into the paragraph, they say, additionally, Purism will be discussing with

12:49.280 --> 12:54.120
Next Cloud about future Purism NAS that runs completely free software, including Next Cloud

12:54.120 --> 12:55.120
and services.

12:55.120 --> 12:57.760
Yeah, just casually tossed in there, yeah.

12:57.760 --> 13:01.820
Let's just make all the things, a phone, laptops, an operating system, and a NAS.

13:01.820 --> 13:02.820
Make all of them.

13:02.820 --> 13:06.400
Well, to be fair, a NAS is fairly straightforward.

13:06.400 --> 13:10.520
Of all of those things, a laptop, a phone, or a NAS, I know which one I'd rather build

13:10.520 --> 13:12.160
because it's the easiest.

13:12.160 --> 13:13.160
Absolutely.

13:13.160 --> 13:16.760
And really, there is a legitimate market for it as more and more people have their own

13:16.760 --> 13:18.160
media collections.

13:18.160 --> 13:21.160
So it's a big week for all of these projects.

13:21.160 --> 13:22.680
And it's cool to see them all working together.

13:22.680 --> 13:27.120
It's like your favorite open source friends coming together to work on a cool collaborative

13:27.120 --> 13:28.120
project.

13:28.120 --> 13:30.560
Yeah, open source supergroup almost.

13:30.560 --> 13:34.040
So we talked about, I think, last time, didn't we, firmware update?

13:34.040 --> 13:36.720
I never can say that.

13:36.720 --> 13:38.960
And how it was a great thing.

13:38.960 --> 13:43.300
And it turns out that they're kind of not doing that well financially.

13:43.300 --> 13:47.520
They've got a bit of support from Amazon for hosting, but they could really do with some

13:47.520 --> 13:50.720
donations to buy hardware to test stuff on.

13:50.720 --> 13:56.800
Yeah, a huge part of FW Update, as a quick reminder, it's the software project that is

13:56.800 --> 14:01.800
working with hardware manufacturers to update firmware and everything from your Intel chip

14:01.800 --> 14:03.760
to your Logitech receivers.

14:03.760 --> 14:10.160
And it is dependent on a hosting service called the Linux Vendor Firmware Project, which is

14:10.160 --> 14:13.400
where all the stuff goes through and then gets distributed down and whatnot.

14:13.400 --> 14:14.920
And that is where the testing comes in.

14:14.920 --> 14:17.360
That's where the hosting costs come in.

14:17.360 --> 14:21.480
And while the time for development of this project is graciously, essentially donated

14:21.480 --> 14:24.140
by Red Hat, the hosting is not.

14:24.140 --> 14:27.120
And so they're reaching out to the community to try to raise funds.

14:27.120 --> 14:30.240
And they have very humble goals.

14:30.240 --> 14:35.200
They're hoping to raise enough funds to buy secondhand hardware to do testing, which is

14:35.200 --> 14:36.200
great.

14:36.200 --> 14:37.680
I like keeping costs low.

14:37.680 --> 14:41.760
But to me, this is one of the most important open source desktop projects right now.

14:41.760 --> 14:43.680
And it's very important in the server space too.

14:43.680 --> 14:48.680
But just to get that desktop first class citizen style firmware updates, this is a really important

14:48.680 --> 14:50.040
project to me.

14:50.040 --> 14:53.920
And I'll be looking into Librepay because that looks like a cool site too.

14:53.920 --> 14:56.200
And I might be considering donating that way.

14:56.200 --> 14:58.440
Yeah, ideally they're looking for regular donations.

14:58.440 --> 15:00.080
I mean, everyone is, aren't they really?

15:00.080 --> 15:02.760
So you've got a sustainable funding model.

15:02.760 --> 15:06.560
And even if it's only a few cents a week, they'd be happy enough with that.

15:06.560 --> 15:11.960
So yeah, do follow the link in the show notes at linuxactionnews.com slash 24.

15:11.960 --> 15:13.560
And go help them out.

15:13.560 --> 15:17.480
Now the next story we have is one that we tend to dread a little bit, not because it's

15:17.480 --> 15:18.920
a bad story.

15:18.920 --> 15:21.400
It's just packed full of legalese and it's a little dry.

15:21.400 --> 15:23.600
But at the same time, it's a pretty big story.

15:23.600 --> 15:25.600
I think it's kind of historic.

15:25.600 --> 15:31.220
The 200 Linux kernel developers and copyright holders came together, well, they made some

15:31.220 --> 15:32.220
news this week, Joe.

15:32.220 --> 15:37.680
Yeah, they're fed up with one of the authors of Netfilter trying to enforce the GPL for

15:37.680 --> 15:38.880
his own gain.

15:38.880 --> 15:41.240
For monetization, as they call it.

15:41.240 --> 15:42.240
Yeah.

15:42.240 --> 15:48.240
And so the key issue here is the difference between suing people for financial gain and

15:48.240 --> 15:50.760
trying to make them actually come into compliance.

15:50.760 --> 15:52.880
And compliance is a key word here.

15:52.880 --> 15:58.760
And what they mean by compliance is if you take the Linux kernel, you make some changes,

15:58.760 --> 16:03.540
and then you release a product that has those changes, then you need to contribute your

16:03.540 --> 16:04.660
code back.

16:04.660 --> 16:06.280
And that's all we're really interested.

16:06.280 --> 16:07.280
That's what they're saying here.

16:07.280 --> 16:10.160
We're not interested in suing you and making money from you.

16:10.160 --> 16:16.400
All we want is you to respect the license and contribute to the community as a whole.

16:16.400 --> 16:20.460
And that, on the surface of things, seems completely reasonable to me.

16:20.460 --> 16:23.880
They're calling it the Kernel Enforcement Statement, and it adopts some termination

16:23.880 --> 16:30.600
provisions from the GPL-3 and also adds some additional time, some additional, quote unquote,

16:30.600 --> 16:35.720
permissions to give companies time to come into compliance before they get sued.

16:35.720 --> 16:40.400
Their aim here being to essentially reestablish confidence amongst large companies that might

16:40.400 --> 16:44.920
want to use Linux at the core of their products that if they screw up, if they make a misstep

16:44.920 --> 16:49.560
because of some strange legal issue that to them seems foreign, they're not going to immediately

16:49.560 --> 16:51.160
be punished for it in the courts.

16:51.160 --> 16:57.480
Yeah, the idea is that you get at least 30 days to sort it out and release your code,

16:57.480 --> 17:02.240
rather than just being pounced on immediately and sued and it costing you loads of money.

17:02.240 --> 17:05.280
Even if you win, it's going to cost you loads of money because you've got legal fees to

17:05.280 --> 17:06.280
pay.

17:06.280 --> 17:11.160
So they're basically putting this buffer in place, which, again, seems fair enough

17:11.160 --> 17:12.160
to me.

17:12.160 --> 17:16.080
How this is actually implemented is a bit fascinating and very geeky.

17:16.080 --> 17:20.480
It's a pull request to add a new file to the kernel's documentation directory.

17:20.480 --> 17:25.120
It adds a short document describing the views of how the Linux kernel community feels about

17:25.120 --> 17:27.200
enforcing the license of the kernel.

17:27.200 --> 17:31.020
So essentially, it's a document that they're adding to the source tree that essentially

17:31.020 --> 17:36.160
states the majority of the copyright holders of the important parts of the kernel view

17:36.160 --> 17:39.200
the license terms as X.

17:39.200 --> 17:43.040
Just so you know, if you use this license, that's how we're viewing these provisions.

17:43.040 --> 17:46.800
Basically they're asserting their legal interpretation of a clause, and what was explained to me

17:46.800 --> 17:51.560
by an audience member who's a lawyer is that that has a lot of weight in legal proceedings.

17:51.560 --> 17:56.720
If you start using something where the copyright holders have been explicit about their interpretation,

17:56.720 --> 17:58.520
it holds a considerable amount of legal weight.

17:58.520 --> 18:03.560
Oh, now that's interesting because obviously I have to use my favorite acronym, IANL, I'm

18:03.560 --> 18:10.640
not a lawyer, but I thought that if it's not in the license, then it wouldn't be necessarily

18:10.640 --> 18:11.720
legally binding.

18:11.720 --> 18:15.120
But if a lawyer has said that it is, then fair enough.

18:15.120 --> 18:17.980
I don't know if legally binding was the way he described it to me.

18:17.980 --> 18:23.480
It's more like you acknowledge this interpretation when you accepted the license, and so if you

18:23.480 --> 18:27.240
try to take them to court, you're going to have to argue while even understanding that

18:27.240 --> 18:29.160
interpretation you still feel you're right.

18:29.160 --> 18:30.160
Okay.

18:30.160 --> 18:34.920
And there's a huge list of developers and copyright holders who have act this, as they

18:34.920 --> 18:37.920
call it, basically acknowledging and giving their blessing to it.

18:37.920 --> 18:43.160
And I was looking down that list, I actually did a control F for Torvalds, he's in there.

18:43.160 --> 18:47.040
If he is on board with this, then it's good enough for me.

18:47.040 --> 18:52.520
He has done a fantastic job of shepherding this project over the last 25 years.

18:52.520 --> 18:59.720
And if he thinks this is a good idea, then as far as I'm concerned, it must be.

18:59.720 --> 19:02.880
DigitalOcean.com, create an account and apply our promo code.

19:02.880 --> 19:05.920
Here's the thing, it's all one word and you get a $10 credit.

19:05.920 --> 19:10.800
Now you can get started over DigitalOcean in less than 55 seconds and get a Linux system

19:10.800 --> 19:13.360
up on their crazy fast infrastructure.

19:13.360 --> 19:15.400
I've spun up a new rig this week.

19:15.400 --> 19:21.400
It's three cents an hour, and I'm running a full Ubuntu Mate 1710 desktop environment.

19:21.400 --> 19:23.800
I'll tell you guys about it in a future episode.

19:23.800 --> 19:24.800
I love it.

19:24.800 --> 19:29.840
It has incredible speed, it's SSDs for all of the systems, and I've attached 100 gigabytes

19:29.840 --> 19:33.240
of block storage to use as my home directory.

19:33.240 --> 19:37.120
DigitalOcean.com, use the promo code, here's the thing, and you'll get a $10 credit.

19:37.120 --> 19:41.320
And while you're there, now's a great time to play around with their new object storage.

19:41.320 --> 19:43.040
They call it Spaces.

19:43.040 --> 19:46.080
You can try it free for two months, and it's well done.

19:46.080 --> 19:49.840
If you're a developer or just an end user, you'll find uses for it.

19:49.840 --> 19:53.480
DigitalOcean.com, data centers all over the world and a dashboard for days.

19:53.480 --> 19:55.800
Use our promo code, here's the thing.

19:55.800 --> 20:03.200
Okay, well, there's no way we could have done a show without the biggest news of the week,

20:03.200 --> 20:06.720
which is that Ubuntu 1710 has been released.

20:06.720 --> 20:12.760
The biggest release of Ubuntu in five, six, seven years, something like that.

20:12.760 --> 20:15.760
Obviously, there's the main edition, and then there's the flavors.

20:15.760 --> 20:19.520
The flavors are not massively interesting, apart from Ubuntu Mate, which no doubt we'll

20:19.520 --> 20:23.860
get back to, but let's talk a bit about this main release.

20:23.860 --> 20:31.100
It's been basically six months in the making, converting from Unity to GNOME 3.

20:31.100 --> 20:34.780
At first, some skeptical people thought that it was going to be very stock.

20:34.780 --> 20:36.400
It turns out not to be.

20:36.400 --> 20:39.720
It turns out, in my opinion, to be way better than stock GNOME.

20:39.720 --> 20:48.400
Yeah, and under the hood, under GNOME, you have kernel 4.13, glibc 2.26, gcc 7.2, and

20:48.400 --> 20:53.200
a lot of other improvements to like Bluetooth and hardware accelerated video codecs, which

20:53.200 --> 20:58.360
will have a dramatic improvement, I hope, on video playback on laptops and battery life.

20:58.360 --> 21:00.840
All those things could use a big improvement.

21:00.840 --> 21:03.320
The big question is, do you think this is a good release?

21:03.320 --> 21:05.040
Have they made themselves proud here?

21:05.040 --> 21:06.320
I've been surprised so far.

21:06.320 --> 21:07.960
I've got it on several machines.

21:07.960 --> 21:12.780
I went through a phase of just installing it on a bunch of systems, and I'm progressively

21:12.780 --> 21:18.720
getting closer and closer to more production-important systems, and it's going really well.

21:18.720 --> 21:19.720
It's a solid release.

21:19.720 --> 21:21.960
It really does have the heart of Ubuntu in it.

21:21.960 --> 21:26.040
It feels like an Ubuntu experience, and it still leaves room for other distributions

21:26.040 --> 21:31.160
like SUSE and Fedora, which also offer really compelling GNOME experiences, so it really

21:31.160 --> 21:34.380
hit that sort of sweet spot where it's uniquely Ubuntu.

21:34.380 --> 21:39.560
It's definitely upstream GNOME, but I still think there's room to dance around a little

21:39.560 --> 21:43.840
bit in that GNOME desktop space and sort of experience the other distribution's implementations,

21:43.840 --> 21:49.140
but this is, I believe, one of the most competitive implementations of the GNOME desktop right

21:49.140 --> 21:50.200
now.

21:50.200 --> 21:56.840
So you haven't been tempted to install gnome-session and log out and then go into a standard stock

21:56.840 --> 21:57.840
GNOME session?

21:57.840 --> 21:59.280
No, you know, I'm really lucky.

21:59.280 --> 22:02.960
I'm one of those users that likes all of the defaults.

22:02.960 --> 22:06.200
All the stuff they've enabled in GNOME, I would just turn back on myself.

22:06.200 --> 22:07.200
Yeah.

22:07.200 --> 22:11.720
Well, the biggest thing for me is actually having a desktop that you can put icons on.

22:11.720 --> 22:14.880
I know a lot of people like to keep it clean, but I don't.

22:14.880 --> 22:19.200
That's where I store an awful lot of stuff for my sins, so that's nice to see.

22:19.200 --> 22:21.720
It's nice to see a proper minimize button.

22:21.720 --> 22:27.320
The dock on the left-hand side is very Unity-like, and so if you are a Unity refugee, then that's

22:27.320 --> 22:30.280
going to keep you happy to some extent.

22:30.280 --> 22:32.080
I never really used Unity.

22:32.080 --> 22:34.480
I tried it out many times and never liked it.

22:34.480 --> 22:40.740
I always liked it a little bit more than GNOME, and I feel that I don't think I could use

22:40.740 --> 22:42.200
a stock GNOME desktop.

22:42.200 --> 22:50.000
I'd have to tweak it extensively, whereas I could probably use this at a push.

22:50.000 --> 22:59.000
Obviously, I'm an XFCE user, so it's XFCE or MATE for me, or even LXDE makes me happy.

22:59.000 --> 23:04.560
So I'm probably the wrong person to judge it in terms of how it compares to stock GNOME,

23:04.560 --> 23:06.560
but I think it's usable.

23:06.560 --> 23:08.760
I think that they've done a good job for what it is.

23:08.760 --> 23:15.280
I still would have liked to have seen something like MATE, but at the same time, that is not

23:15.280 --> 23:19.080
quite there yet, is it, in terms of high DPI support and stuff like that?

23:19.080 --> 23:22.620
Yeah, and that's where they've really done a lot of good work, is polishing those rough

23:22.620 --> 23:25.920
edges like high DPI and fractional scaling.

23:25.920 --> 23:30.920
The very final theme touches that they polished off right before they shipped make a huge

23:30.920 --> 23:32.480
difference in usability for me.

23:32.480 --> 23:34.080
Yeah, and you mentioned Bluetooth.

23:34.080 --> 23:35.440
That's something they've been concentrating on.

23:35.440 --> 23:38.280
I've tested that out now, and that is brilliant.

23:38.280 --> 23:42.360
I wish all desktop environments and all distros worked as well as that does.

23:42.360 --> 23:48.240
I've been distro-hopping for about five to six months, and I didn't think I'd ever go

23:48.240 --> 23:53.880
back to using Ubuntu as my main desktop, but as of right now, 1710 has pulled me back,

23:53.880 --> 23:59.440
and I'm deploying different versions of 1710 on different machines for the work case, and

23:59.440 --> 24:01.400
I like all the different flavors, too.

24:01.400 --> 24:05.080
We should talk a little bit about the flavors as well, because it's not just all about the

24:05.080 --> 24:09.680
GNOME version of Ubuntu, a friend of the show, Martin Wimpress and team have released Ubuntu

24:09.680 --> 24:14.520
Mate 1710, and they say it's their best release they've ever produced.

24:14.520 --> 24:20.080
Well, yeah, it is rock solid from what I have tested it, and to be honest, it was rock solid

24:20.080 --> 24:25.480
a couple of months ago at the alpha stage, and not much has changed since.

24:25.480 --> 24:32.280
It hasn't needed to, and you've got this mutiny layout, which has been developed even further

24:32.280 --> 24:39.280
than it was before, to the point where it's not quite Unity, but it's very, very close.

24:39.280 --> 24:43.380
This is a cunning strategy of the Ubuntu Mate project, because what they are essentially

24:43.380 --> 24:47.120
creating is a refugee for Unity 7 fans.

24:47.120 --> 24:50.120
They've been working on these features for multiple releases now.

24:50.120 --> 24:55.600
The HUD support isn't new to the 1710 release, it's just been nailed in the 1710 release.

24:55.600 --> 25:01.840
The Super Key support wasn't new to 1710, it just works universally now regarding layout

25:01.840 --> 25:03.840
and has been nailed in 1710.

25:03.840 --> 25:08.320
So all these little things that Unity lovers are going to look for in a desktop environment

25:08.320 --> 25:11.120
have been getting slowly added to Ubuntu Mate.

25:11.120 --> 25:14.260
To a point now with 1710, it's pretty much there.

25:14.260 --> 25:19.040
It's just a couple of rough edges, and I think by the 1804 release, they're going to nail

25:19.040 --> 25:20.040
it.

25:20.040 --> 25:25.720
Well, the 1804 release is key to me, because I know it's supposed to be Linux Action news

25:25.720 --> 25:32.060
and it should be all about new stuff, but the statistics prove that most Ubuntu users

25:32.060 --> 25:33.280
use the LTS.

25:33.280 --> 25:40.120
So most people are still using 1604 and are watching this and testing this maybe, but

25:40.120 --> 25:43.120
probably not rolling it out in production.

25:43.120 --> 25:50.020
And this 1710 release is almost like a beta for the 1804 one.

25:50.020 --> 25:58.200
This is the testing ground, and it's kind of proof that the standard, the main Ubuntu

25:58.200 --> 26:02.480
is ready, and Ubuntu Mate, same story.

26:02.480 --> 26:07.520
It gives me great confidence that 1804 is going to be a great release for both of them.

26:07.520 --> 26:14.760
I've heard numbers as high as 20x the amount of LTS users to the non-LTS releases.

26:14.760 --> 26:17.000
So it's a huge, huge difference.

26:17.000 --> 26:22.840
And part of my reason for switching to this 1710 release is I'm crossing my fingers, and

26:22.840 --> 26:27.480
I'm hoping for a smooth upgrade to 1804, and then I'm just going to hang there for a couple

26:27.480 --> 26:31.640
of years on all of our production equipment, and I'm going to let Wayland get itself worked

26:31.640 --> 26:32.640
out.

26:32.640 --> 26:35.760
I'm going to let Pipewire get itself worked out, and I'm just going to sit back and use

26:35.760 --> 26:38.320
an LTS on the production equipment for years.

26:38.320 --> 26:43.980
And so I'm hedging now with 1710 for 1804 to be good, and then I'll just sit back and

26:43.980 --> 26:44.980
eat popcorn for a bit.

26:44.980 --> 26:47.760
Well, you mentioned Wayland, let's talk a little bit about that.

26:47.760 --> 26:55.080
The default session is Wayland now, which has been so in Fedora for a couple of releases,

26:55.080 --> 26:59.260
but Fedora does not have the user numbers of Ubuntu, let's face it.

26:59.260 --> 27:03.440
So this is going to be a huge test for Wayland.

27:03.440 --> 27:10.280
You're going to have it rolled out to a lot of people testing Ubuntu 1710, and once we

27:10.280 --> 27:14.360
get to 1804, that's when the real test is going to come, I think.

27:14.360 --> 27:18.040
And so they have to nail it over the next six months.

27:18.040 --> 27:24.360
But in my experience of a couple of pretty standard laptops, I had zero problems.

27:24.360 --> 27:27.360
I would have not known I was on Wayland, essentially.

27:27.360 --> 27:28.360
Perfect.

27:28.360 --> 27:29.440
That's good to hear.

27:29.440 --> 27:33.740
We had one crash on Wes's machine that we're attributing to Wayland, but we don't know

27:33.740 --> 27:35.240
for sure.

27:35.240 --> 27:41.280
The other reality to the 1710 release is that it is truly standing on the shoulders of other

27:41.280 --> 27:42.900
giants in the community.

27:42.900 --> 27:48.360
There has been a lot of hard work by the Fedora project and others to build the Gnome software

27:48.360 --> 27:54.400
center, to work issues out on Wayland, to build the Gnome shell up to where it is today.

27:54.400 --> 27:58.960
That is significant, and it's kind of ironic that Canonical is able now to come back to

27:58.960 --> 28:02.000
Gnome and is able to leverage that hard work.

28:02.000 --> 28:05.520
There's a certain irony to it, but at the same time, there's a certain beauty to it.

28:05.520 --> 28:07.440
Well, that's what open source is all about, isn't it?

28:07.440 --> 28:11.360
It's supposed to be, although people are competing with each other, really everyone is in it

28:11.360 --> 28:12.600
together.

28:12.600 --> 28:16.440
This week also, believe it or not, marked the 13th birthday of Ubuntu.

28:16.440 --> 28:18.960
So happy 13th birthday, Ubuntu.

28:18.960 --> 28:21.560
Yeah, unlucky for some.

28:21.560 --> 28:22.560
Hopefully not for them.

28:22.560 --> 28:29.920
You know, that release 13 years ago shipped with Gnome 2.8, Firefox 0.9, OpenOffice 1.12.

28:29.920 --> 28:30.920
Wow.

28:30.920 --> 28:31.920
Yeah.

28:31.920 --> 28:34.800
And now here we are with snaps.

28:34.800 --> 28:36.280
We haven't talked about that.

28:36.280 --> 28:41.160
Snaps feature prominently now with Ubuntu Marte, they're actually shipping a snap out

28:41.160 --> 28:44.700
of the box, which is a bold step.

28:44.700 --> 28:49.560
And it feels like Canonical have just gone all in at this point on snaps to the point

28:49.560 --> 28:56.440
where when you do a search for software, you get snaps alongside devs with equal standing,

28:56.440 --> 29:02.000
which makes me think that they are definitely confident that snaps are basically there,

29:02.000 --> 29:05.960
which I can't agree with, really.

29:05.960 --> 29:11.440
I think that they're ready for testing, they're ready for some use, but I don't think that

29:11.440 --> 29:17.440
it's quite 100% there for the kind of person who is going to use Ubuntu.

29:17.440 --> 29:22.040
That's probably why they put it in Ubuntu Marte and they did it with the Pulse audio

29:22.040 --> 29:26.240
mixer so that way, and that's a command line app, it's not a very popular app and it doesn't

29:26.240 --> 29:27.240
ship by default.

29:27.240 --> 29:30.200
I don't even know what's in the Debian repo at this moment.

29:30.200 --> 29:34.400
So that's sort of, I think, a perfect edge case because you have something that'll be

29:34.400 --> 29:39.040
really low use, but you can still ship it and test updating to it.

29:39.040 --> 29:44.400
I had a good conversation with Wimpy on Linux Unplugged about the backstory behind this

29:44.400 --> 29:45.400
move.

29:45.400 --> 29:48.080
And the backstory is really to learn what it's like to have a high load of an app and

29:48.080 --> 29:50.280
then ship updates to it as a regular thing.

29:50.280 --> 29:52.800
And they're seeing if it is ready or not.

29:52.800 --> 29:56.120
They're going into this with the mindset of we might come out of this with data that tells

29:56.120 --> 29:57.120
us we're not ready.

29:57.120 --> 30:02.220
Well, yeah, which is fair enough for that, as you say, a command line app, but what I'm

30:02.220 --> 30:08.400
talking about here is if you search for software in the GUI on Ubuntu proper, you get snaps

30:08.400 --> 30:12.040
in the results and it means that people are going to be installing them and they're going

30:12.040 --> 30:13.040
to be testing them.

30:13.040 --> 30:16.440
Now I have to get this double checked and if anybody in the audience knows, please let

30:16.440 --> 30:18.200
me know.

30:18.200 --> 30:23.160
The way I believe that works is GNOME software has a plugin architecture and so snaps is

30:23.160 --> 30:29.160
a plugin to GNOME software and plugins by default list higher in the search result than

30:29.160 --> 30:30.800
your distros repo.

30:30.800 --> 30:35.120
So that's a function of GNOME software, not a modification that Ubuntu made to give preference

30:35.120 --> 30:36.120
to snaps.

30:36.120 --> 30:40.820
Yeah, but at the same time, they're still there given equal billing and there's nothing

30:40.820 --> 30:42.360
stopping people installing them.

30:42.360 --> 30:43.360
Absolutely.

30:43.360 --> 30:44.360
And I'm sure that's what they hope.

30:44.360 --> 30:46.560
Well, yeah, they hope that people will test them.

30:46.560 --> 30:50.120
And I suppose 1710, as I said, is basically a beta for 1804.

30:50.120 --> 30:52.960
I know there's a lot of people would strongly disagree.

30:52.960 --> 30:57.840
They spent so much time getting this ready as a release, but as I say, 20x the number

30:57.840 --> 31:00.040
of people using the LTS is.

31:00.040 --> 31:06.640
So they've got the several months now to see how it works out with people using snaps.

31:06.640 --> 31:11.040
And I'm going to try to follow up on that story and get the get the data.

31:11.040 --> 31:14.080
I'm hoping that Canonical will share it with us one way or the other.

31:14.080 --> 31:18.440
I do feel like we have to give one honorable mention to the flavor I'm considering the

31:18.440 --> 31:23.320
most this release because I'm building remote desktops that are hosted on Digital Ocean

31:23.320 --> 31:24.320
and it's Ubuntu.

31:24.320 --> 31:27.480
So Ubuntu 1710 is on my radar this release cycle.

31:27.480 --> 31:29.640
Yeah, there's not massive changes.

31:29.640 --> 31:35.840
There's a few GTK 3 things, slowly but surely, all the elements are being ported to GTK 3

31:35.840 --> 31:39.360
and you get the feeling that it's going to be finished right around the time GTK 4 comes

31:39.360 --> 31:40.360
out.

31:40.360 --> 31:41.360
Yeah.

31:41.360 --> 31:43.400
But let's ignore that and let's just say that it's good progress.

31:43.400 --> 31:45.080
I am sitting here using Ubuntu.

31:45.080 --> 31:46.680
I love it.

31:46.680 --> 31:54.720
I've tested out 1710 and it works almost exactly the same way that 1604 does.

31:54.720 --> 31:59.560
And so I'm confident that 1804 is going to be a great release and I will upgrade to it

31:59.560 --> 32:02.480
and not look back for the next couple of years.

32:02.480 --> 32:06.440
Yeah, I might try it on my X2Go systems because I'm going to be able to take advantage of

32:06.440 --> 32:12.160
all of the core new features of 1710 like the new Bluetooth and USB audio device fixes

32:12.160 --> 32:13.680
which actually would come in handy.

32:13.680 --> 32:19.680
And I really appreciate the improvements to client-side decorations for GTK 3 themed apps.

32:19.680 --> 32:23.520
That's just going to make things look better and more modern on the XFCE desktop.

32:23.520 --> 32:24.520
So it's a serious contender.

32:24.520 --> 32:27.920
I'm going to load it up on a remote session and try it out for a bit and compare it to

32:27.920 --> 32:31.160
Ubuntu MATE and other desktops and see which one works best.

32:31.160 --> 32:32.520
And they're all really compelling releases.

32:32.520 --> 32:36.480
We'll have links to this stuff in the show notes like Joe mentioned linuxactionnews.com

32:36.480 --> 32:37.480
slash 24.

32:37.480 --> 32:42.080
Yeah, I hate to say it Wimpy, but come on Chris, come to the XFCE dark side.

32:42.080 --> 32:46.080
Well, I'll at least give it a spin, but I sure have been enjoying Ubuntu MATE right

32:46.080 --> 32:47.080
now.

32:47.080 --> 32:48.080
Okay, well we got to cut it off there.

32:48.080 --> 32:51.480
