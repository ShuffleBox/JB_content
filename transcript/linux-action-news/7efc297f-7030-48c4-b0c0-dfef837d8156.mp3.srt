00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,400
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, our weekly take on Linux and the open source world.

2
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:21,240
This is episode 62, recorded on July 15, 2018.

3
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:22,240
I'm Chris.

4
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:23,240
And I'm Joe.

5
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:24,240
Hello, Joe.

6
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:28,160
We kick things off this week with Arch's turn in the barrel.

7
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:32,800
It appears there was malware found in the Arch user repository.

8
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:34,080
Not a huge surprise, really.

9
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:37,960
Well, actually, the surprise is that it's taken this long for malware to appear in the

10
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:41,460
AUR because anyone can upload software there.

11
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:45,000
So you would assume that people would have tried this before.

12
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,180
Yeah, you know, I wouldn't be surprised if there has been stuff in the past that maybe

13
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:52,120
just didn't get attention like things do now.

14
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:56,800
Also though, I do recall from my days of installing Arch that when you get to that point of installing

15
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:01,720
software from the AUR, they're pretty careful about walking you through how to build a package

16
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:03,560
from the AUR by hand.

17
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:07,560
So that way, you know how package builds work and you kind of know what to look out for.

18
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:11,720
So there may be a little more baked in vigilance in the user base of the AUR, possibly.

19
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:17,320
Yeah, but that assumes that people actually read the manual and pay attention to it.

20
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:21,560
Surely, most people just go through that once and then just, ah, it's fine.

21
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:22,560
I'll just trust it.

22
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:25,800
If there's a problem, there'll be a Reddit thread about it or something.

23
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:28,000
Okay, there's a little bit of that.

24
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Yeah.

25
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,520
Plus there's also when you go to the AUR website, there's a comment section.

26
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:33,400
So you know, you always give that a scan too.

27
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:36,840
If anybody's in there shouting malware, you know, you move on.

28
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:41,040
But this obviously ties in with the recent stories about the Snap Store with the Crypto

29
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,800
Miner and Docker Hub as well.

30
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:44,560
Again, that was crypto mining.

31
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:47,920
This time it wasn't crypto mining, though, although it may have been laying the groundwork

32
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:48,920
for it.

33
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:51,200
It was just really a hardware survey, wasn't it?

34
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:56,160
A little bit like what Ubuntu have done, only without telling people this time.

35
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:59,600
Yeah, without the permission or the anonymity.

36
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,320
So there's those aspects to it.

37
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:06,520
But it is kind of funny to see that it just wanted machine ID, the output of uname-a,

38
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:12,040
your CPU information, output from the Pacman database of installed packages, and then the

39
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:16,320
systemctl list systemd units to figure out what you're running by default.

40
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:18,240
And that's all it wanted.

41
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,240
No big deal.

42
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:20,240
Send that up to a pastebin file.

43
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:21,240
That's it.

44
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:22,240
No big deal.

45
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:26,640
Yeah, but that was probably to ascertain what the best method to get crypto mining software

46
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,720
on people's machines was.

47
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:32,480
Oh, no, no, no, Joe, you completely misunderstand.

48
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:36,720
This was simply designed to give these users the best experience possible the next time

49
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,720
they install something from the AUR.

50
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:39,720
That's all.

51
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:44,280
But just for a little bit of the details here, Zactor appears to be the username of the AUR

52
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:46,780
who modified a package on June 7th.

53
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:52,720
The package, AcroRead, hmm, I wonder what that could be, was changed to run this script

54
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:57,520
and it set up a systemd unit to start itself up and do the collection in the background

55
00:02:57,520 --> 00:03:00,160
for you automatically for your convenience.

56
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:04,760
But obviously that script that it's calling can be changed on the remote server at any

57
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:06,920
time to do whatever he wants it to do.

58
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:11,000
So yeah, clearly crypto mining was the plan here, I think.

59
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,480
But it does beg the question, what can we do about this long term?

60
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:22,600
If we're moving to this system of repositories that anyone can upload to or that are certainly

61
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:28,200
less curated than they traditionally have been with the repos, we need to put some safeguards

62
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:29,760
in place, don't we?

63
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:34,360
Or is it just the Wild West, like we have with Windows, or we have had it with Windows

64
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:38,840
in the past where it's just random executables downloaded from websites?

65
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:44,280
I don't know if they're comparable, like for example, snaps have confinement in most cases.

66
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:48,400
So this script wouldn't have been able to get to the system information because it wouldn't

67
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,480
have had access to that information.

68
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:55,000
So they may not be one to one comparable here, just like a Docker container only has access

69
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,480
to the things that are within a container.

70
00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:01,960
So you can put malware in a container, but it doesn't get on the system unless there's

71
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:04,320
other exploits which it can chain on top of.

72
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:09,720
So in this particular case, it is a little more reflective of the earlier model that

73
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:10,720
the AUR represents.

74
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:14,760
I mean, it's been around for much longer than anything we just mentioned, Docker Hub or

75
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:17,420
the Snap Store or Flatpaks and Flat Hub.

76
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:20,280
It's been around for a very long time now.

77
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:22,880
And it's always been anyone can contribute.

78
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:27,140
That's sort of why it's called the Arch User Repository, they try to put it in the name.

79
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:30,680
And I don't necessarily think it means we need to fix it.

80
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:35,560
I just think it means that we have to continue education when you start to use any one of

81
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:36,880
those services.

82
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:40,240
And each one kind of has to be taken in its own way.

83
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:43,640
And that's why some people consider it dangerous to install things from the AUR.

84
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:45,560
I never was one of those people.

85
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:50,600
But all those people who always said it's dangerous can now point to this and say, hey,

86
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:52,440
look, I was right.

87
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:56,680
But I go back to my core point when we talked about Docker Hub and the Snap Store is it's

88
00:04:56,680 --> 00:05:02,980
really up to the users that are installing the software to do the due diligence, to look

89
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:08,800
into it, and to just do a quick cursory check of basic things like the user account, the

90
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:14,520
user views, and in the case of the AUR, the package build file, and just do that cursory

91
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:15,520
work.

92
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:16,720
It doesn't take very long.

93
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:20,080
And it is so worth it because you could avoid something like this.

94
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,120
I think they're really worth it.

95
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:24,760
I think they're very worth it because they make software and free software in particular

96
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:26,760
more available to more people.

97
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:29,200
You just have to do that due diligence.

98
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:34,840
But hang on a second, you said that users need to be more proactive and everything.

99
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:39,080
But part of the appeal for me of Linux is that I can give it to someone like my mom

100
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:45,000
and just say, don't install anything other than from the GUI App Store and you'll be

101
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,240
absolutely fine.

102
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:55,440
But if you start then putting snaps and whatever into that GUI App Store and then trying to

103
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:59,660
tell people that they are responsible for it, that's where the line gets a bit fuzzy

104
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:00,660
for me.

105
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:03,320
I don't know if we're there yet.

106
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:07,600
Generally speaking, say you look at GNOME software on the Ubuntu desktop, the software

107
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:11,700
that gets featured there is hand-selected by staff at Canonical.

108
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:18,640
So there is a human there that is curating that carousel when you're in GNOME software,

109
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:19,640
for example.

110
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:25,240
So you give this to mom or a family member and they stick to the stuff that's advertised,

111
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:27,040
I think they're always going to be OK.

112
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:28,840
And that might just have to be the solution.

113
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:33,520
The end users, what they get is sort of a more curated experience.

114
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:37,120
But if you're going to the AUR, you're beyond the end user phase.

115
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:41,360
And then I think that's where you can say, all right, there's a little more onus on you

116
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,360
now.

117
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:45,600
You're opting to go to this more advanced, just like if you're using Docker Hub.

118
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,520
You're beyond the end user stage.

119
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:53,640
And so now, just like when you become an advanced car driver or a pilot or whatever, when you

120
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:56,920
advance something like that, there's more responsibilities you take on.

121
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:57,920
That's just how it works.

122
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:01,880
Yeah, and you say if you're using the AUR, if you're using Arch, you're beyond the end

123
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:02,880
user at that point.

124
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:03,880
And Hergros!

125
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:06,800
Yeah, I suppose, or Manjaro maybe.

126
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:11,680
But even then, if you're beyond, you know, maybe I shouldn't say this, but if you're

127
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:18,560
beyond sort of Ubuntu, Fedora even, then you're kind of getting into the enthusiast side of

128
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:23,160
things and then you kind of should be responsible for what you're installing, I suppose.

129
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:27,760
Well, something that end users won't be touching but machines will be deploying is this

130
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:30,720
new minimal Ubuntu that was released this week.

131
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,920
Yeah, another minimal Ubuntu.

132
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:37,200
I think there are two or three of them, so that's a bit confusing.

133
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:41,200
But this is an image that is designed to be run in the cloud, isn't it?

134
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:45,960
Designed to be spun up hundreds at a time by orchestration software.

135
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:52,440
And the whole point of it is to be slim, boot fast, but be Ubuntu underneath and have Snap

136
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:56,400
and Apt and you can build whatever system you want on top of it.

137
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,680
So it's kind of the best of both worlds.

138
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:03,240
And it's kind of an attempt to compete with the likes of Alpine Linux, isn't it?

139
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:06,800
Yeah, and that's why I'm glad we finally are seeing this.

140
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:12,580
Maybe even I'd say a little late, because it's exactly where Ubuntu needed to be about

141
00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:13,580
a year ago.

142
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:16,560
So that way they could be really as part of where Alpine's at now.

143
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:19,640
However, they're still in a really strong position, so I wouldn't say it's too little

144
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:20,640
too late.

145
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:22,700
In fact, the results may have been worth the wait.

146
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:27,580
For the Docker Hub image, it's a 29 megabyte image.

147
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:30,840
That's remarkable, because you're really not missing out on anything.

148
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:35,840
You could apt-get install htop if you wanted to and have a much better process fewer.

149
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:38,040
Like it's real Ubuntu.

150
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:43,300
And that kind of goes to what I've been noticing about Ubuntu on a wider scale is they're not

151
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:47,680
going through these thousands of different product differentiating categories.

152
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:51,300
Like I'm starting to lose track right now over at the Red Hat camp.

153
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:56,400
You've got Red Hat, you've got CentOS, you've got Fedora Atomic, but now we've also got

154
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:59,520
Fedora Core OS, which isn't a big transition.

155
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:02,680
And then out there kind of outside all of this, you have Scientific Linux.

156
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:07,680
Like it's nebulous to me exactly what's going on, while at the meantime, I'm also using

157
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:11,760
Fedora Cloud and Fedora Server, and I don't know where that's going.

158
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:16,120
And then over on the OpenSUSE camp, it's really a mess in the SUSE area when you want to get

159
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:19,160
into Kubernetes or containerization or OpenStack.

160
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:22,400
There's different vertical stacks of SUSE for each one of those solutions.

161
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:26,400
Then you've got OpenSUSE, you've got multiple iterations of that, two of them, plus main

162
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:32,360
SUSE has two iterations, SUSE Enterprise for the desktop and SUSE Enterprise for the server.

163
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:33,620
It's mind-blowing.

164
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:38,440
But when you get to Ubuntu, there is one Ubuntu 18.04.

165
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:42,800
Now there's a mini version of it called Minimal, and there's the version you can install on

166
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:47,460
your desktop, and there's the version you can deploy on a VPS or on physical hardware.

167
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:49,820
It's all the same version.

168
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:51,340
It's all the same operating system.

169
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:55,640
There's one Ubuntu 18.04, just like there's one Ubuntu 16.04.

170
00:09:55,640 --> 00:10:00,880
It's much easier to understand, and it feels like these other distros that have these different

171
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:05,920
vertical slices, these differentiators are really just a sell into different markets,

172
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:07,380
and it just adds confusion.

173
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:10,080
It feels like a model from the 90s that Microsoft created.

174
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:15,480
Well, Ubuntu was always about Linux for human beings, and that philosophy seems to have

175
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:18,500
continued into their cloud offerings, doesn't it?

176
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:21,820
Just keep it as simple as possible and just have one Ubuntu.

177
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:27,080
I suppose it gets a little more complicated with Ubuntu core, but certainly with stuff

178
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:32,540
like this, you could take this minimal image that is supposed to be competing with the

179
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:37,240
likes of Alpine, and you could, in theory, install a full Ubuntu desktop on top of it,

180
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:40,800
and it wouldn't be much different from what you can download as an ISO.

181
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:44,960
I was joking with Will about that on Late Night Linux, and he said, don't do that.

182
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:46,160
I'm almost tempted to do it.

183
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:50,120
I still haven't got around to it, but the point remains, doesn't it, that you just have

184
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:54,600
one Ubuntu, and that seems to be a very strong strategy.

185
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:59,700
Yeah, and so these images are 50% the size of the standard Ubuntu server image, and they

186
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:03,700
boot 40% faster, and I know people will write in, and they will say, well, how much faster

187
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:04,880
does it need to boot, guys?

188
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:08,600
At this point, it's pretty quick, but it was made really clear to me when I was having

189
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:13,540
a conversation with someone who works inside AWS, and he was talking about how they're

190
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:18,560
trying to shave down seconds off of spinning up thousands of instance at once.

191
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:25,520
They'll turn on 1,000 Ubuntu servers at once, and that boot up time makes a huge difference,

192
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:31,280
and if you do analysis of some postmortems from Netflix outages, the boot time of their

193
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:36,880
Linux servers, because it's thousands that have to wait and boot, really stacks up, and

194
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:41,940
it creates this massive outage window where they've had to engineer around this problem,

195
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:46,800
and so if Canonical can shave that boot time off the top, like just by default, when you

196
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:50,580
use this image, you're going to get a 40% faster boot.

197
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:55,200
That makes real-world differences to companies like Netflix and others that have infrastructure

198
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,640
on virtual systems.

199
00:11:56,640 --> 00:12:00,400
But you do have to wonder, by the time you've built the other stuff that you need on top

200
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:04,480
of this image, whether you're going to still have that 40% saving.

201
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:06,680
I think it really depends on the workload, doesn't it?

202
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:09,100
Yeah, and it also depends on how you're using this.

203
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:13,160
These could be images that are inside containers, so they're sitting on a, you know, who knows

204
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:17,360
what base system, but these containers themselves can fire up faster when needed to respond

205
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:18,580
to customer demand.

206
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:19,660
That matters, too.

207
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:23,720
And you can build really specific systems, like think serverless.

208
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:26,040
You hear things like AWS Lambda tossed around.

209
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:27,940
It's a big hype right now.

210
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:31,520
In fact, we've done some experiments with just doing different things on the back end,

211
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:33,400
just spinning up a serverless infrastructure.

212
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:38,300
A week ago, I think it was, we talked about Rattlesnake OS, how they're building their

213
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:42,320
self-updating infrastructure around serverless on AWS Lambda.

214
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:46,800
Well, serverless is really just a way for you to execute a function, get a result back,

215
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:47,980
and move on.

216
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:53,120
And that's all powered by Linux systems on the back end spinning up instantly, creating

217
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:57,680
an environment for your code, executing it, delivering you the result, and then destroying

218
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:58,680
themselves.

219
00:12:58,680 --> 00:12:59,760
That's all serverless is.

220
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:03,000
And the faster you can spin those up, the more requests you can take, and obviously

221
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,560
the more margins you make.

222
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:06,360
But then you go back to the Alpine issue.

223
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:09,440
Is this too late from Ubuntu and Canonical?

224
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:12,280
Have they already lost out to Alpine in this space?

225
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:15,520
Yeah, I think that is the big question that we just won't know.

226
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:16,960
We'll have to wait and see.

227
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:19,200
They have an ecosystem.

228
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:24,160
Developers seem to enjoy using Ubuntu on the desktop, laptop, and then on the server

229
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:25,360
and cloud.

230
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:30,200
So that may translate to adoption of Ubuntu Minimal for containers and for other deployments.

231
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:35,480
So maybe that momentum will carry this, but Alpine has quite a bit of momentum now as

232
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:36,480
well.

233
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:38,080
I think it's kind of up in the air.

234
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:44,800
Yeah, I think that that is a big part of it, having the same system on your laptop as that's

235
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,440
running in your container.

236
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:52,460
Just that familiarity with how everything works and the little differences between distros,

237
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:56,600
it makes it more attractive to me to stick with Ubuntu in the cloud.

238
00:13:56,600 --> 00:14:00,120
So maybe this is enough for them, but I suppose we'll have to see.

239
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:05,720
But as we know, the cloud all runs on Python these days, and there's been a big shift over

240
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:07,280
at the project.

241
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:12,360
Its benevolent dictator for life has decided to step down.

242
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:16,280
Yeah, Guido van Rossum has had enough after all these years.

243
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:20,400
He's decided that he's going to remain a developer for the time being, but he's had enough of

244
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:21,920
being the leader.

245
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:26,200
Too much politics going on, and he's stepping down, and he's not naming a successor either.

246
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:28,840
He's just kind of saying, up to you guys, do what you want.

247
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:31,760
Yeah, that's actually literally what he's saying in his announcement on the mailing

248
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:32,760
list.

249
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:33,760
It's, you're on your own now.

250
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:35,400
Have at it.

251
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:40,680
This is really after what was a hell of a process to bring a new feature into Python

252
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:43,340
that was rather controversial.

253
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:49,000
And as all community discussions go, it got a little heated, especially these days, and

254
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,520
it's called the PEP572 mess.

255
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:57,680
You may have seen this go by, especially if you're an LWN subscriber or if you attended

256
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:05,520
Python Language Summit 2018 this year, where it was a significant topic of conversation.

257
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:10,840
The basic idea behind this PEP feature was a way to do assignments and expressions, which

258
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:13,480
makes writing some code constructs easier.

259
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:20,140
C has this, so does Go, but there was a lot of debate on if this feature needed to even

260
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:21,600
be in Python.

261
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:25,400
You know, there was a common feeling that we've been around for 28 years and we haven't

262
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:26,400
needed this feature.

263
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:30,480
There was also different camps on how the syntax should be implemented, some really

264
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:32,700
strong opinions on syntax.

265
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:34,720
Everybody really had an opinion on syntax.

266
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:37,860
And it may have gotten in the development channel a little earlier than it should have,

267
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:44,100
which upset some people, and it all led to a very voiceless conversation that at the

268
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:49,240
end of it appears to have left their benevolent dictator feeling like he needs a very long

269
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:50,240
vacation.

270
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:52,680
Do you think it's a knee-jerk reaction from him?

271
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:58,520
I know this dragged on for a little bit, but now that it's over with, just him almost mic

272
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:04,240
dropping at this point, surely after this long he could maybe just take a vacation for

273
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:10,280
a couple of weeks and then come back, rather than just say he's out and get on with it.

274
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:12,640
It just seems a little bit strange to me.

275
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:16,400
Yeah, I almost wonder if he feels like the position isn't necessary anymore.

276
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:18,680
He writes, I'm not going to appoint a successor.

277
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:23,440
And then he also writes, so what are you all going to do, create a democracy, anarchy,

278
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,860
a dictatorship, a federation?

279
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:30,040
He sort of points out that his opinion hasn't been as necessary over the last few years

280
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:33,680
and that the project has a certain amount of momentum and there's already kind of voting

281
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:37,160
going on on different things that maybe they can just figure it out.

282
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:41,560
I don't know, because if it was a total mic drop, he wouldn't then later on offer to mentor

283
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:44,480
people like he does and say he's going to stick around.

284
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:49,120
I think in a way he kind of handled it in the best way possible if he's totally done.

285
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:54,800
He got them through this controversial storm, got them on the other end of this thing, and

286
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:58,800
then once they're there and things have settled, he's saying, all right, I'm stepping away

287
00:16:58,800 --> 00:16:59,800
now.

288
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:03,360
Like he could have left in the middle of it when he was probably peak upset, but instead

289
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:07,280
he waited until he got on the other end of it, things settled a bit, and then said, okay,

290
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:11,720
I'm leaving, I'll be around, I can do some mentoring, but I'm not the benevolent dictator

291
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:12,720
anymore.

292
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:16,280
There's no doubt that he's been responsible with it, but it does still strike me as strange

293
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:20,480
after all that time, but maybe he was kind of done with it already and this just pushed

294
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:21,480
him over the edge.

295
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:24,200
Yeah, I could see that, especially if you have a feeling like your position has been

296
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:25,640
less and less relevant over the years.

297
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:28,840
I could see it kind of coming to that, and maybe this is the best way for it to happen.

298
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:36,200
I'll be watching this with a lot of interest though, because this is a longstanding community

299
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:41,440
project that has a huge legacy and a lot of importance, and now what are they going to

300
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:42,440
do?

301
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:43,440
What are they going to do next?

302
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:44,440
Do they fall apart?

303
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:45,440
Do they form into something new?

304
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:46,720
Do we see massive changes?

305
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:47,720
Will there be a fork?

306
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:52,120
Like there could be some really interesting developments over the rest of this year with

307
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:53,120
Python.

308
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:59,880
Last,.ting.com, it's smarter than unlimited because you only pay for what you use.

309
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:01,520
So when you use less, you pay less.

310
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:05,920
The average Ting bill is just $23 per month per phone.

311
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:09,200
It's a fair price for however much you talk, text, and data you use.

312
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:12,920
Ting has nationwide coverage, CDMA, and GSM.

313
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:16,800
There's no contracts nor the termination fee, so you can try it out and rest assured that

314
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:19,640
for some reason it doesn't work for you, you're not stuck.

315
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:20,920
I love that too.

316
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:24,280
I have MiFi devices that I can turn off if I know I'm not going to be traveling for a

317
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:25,280
while.

318
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:29,600
It's a great system because if you don't want to, you never have to talk to a human being.

319
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:34,200
You can do it all through their really nice control panel, but if you prefer to talk to

320
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:37,880
a human being or you need to, they have great customer service.

321
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:41,640
They have support for some of the best phones because they have CDMA and GSM and a ton of

322
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:44,960
devices that you could probably bring with you, so check their BYOD page.

323
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:45,960
They have a lot.

324
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:49,120
And up on their blog right now, I'll point this out, this is really nice.

325
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:50,540
They have up like a term sheet.

326
00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:54,940
It's not quite as generic as that, but they have up a bunch of different terms and definitions

327
00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:59,120
for fiber optic networking, which has different things in it than traditional networking.

328
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:01,300
It's just a really handy post.

329
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:03,520
Start though by going to last.ting.com.

330
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:07,760
That supports the show and it gets you $25 off a device or if you bring one, it'll give

331
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:10,080
you $25 in service credit.

332
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:14,440
And then you just pay for what you use, a fair price for however much you talk, text,

333
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:15,440
and data you use.

334
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:16,440
last.ting.com.

335
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:24,760
Okay, so let's talk about Firefox, specifically for Android.

336
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:26,240
And is this good news?

337
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:27,240
Is this bad news?

338
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:28,240
I don't know.

339
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:33,520
It's entering a maintenance phase while they rebuild it from scratch on different technologies.

340
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:37,440
Yeah, the Android components technologies, which is a collection of Android libraries

341
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:42,060
that can be used to build browser-like applications, which probably means not Gecko.

342
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:48,280
So one part of me is a little concerned, but the Mozilla development team has been killing

343
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:49,320
it lately.

344
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:52,320
Like Firefox has been better than ever.

345
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:56,400
And so I kind of have faith that they know what they're doing here.

346
00:19:56,400 --> 00:20:01,440
And it's nice that they will still be pushing bug fixes for critical bugs and security fixes

347
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:03,600
to the version of Firefox that's on Android.

348
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:06,600
So maintenance does mean security fixes for a bit.

349
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:10,560
Just no major new features, which is probably great for guys like you, Joe.

350
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:15,180
Yeah, I don't mind no new features, but most people do.

351
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:19,240
But what concerns me a little bit about this and makes me think that it might be bad news

352
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:22,720
is that you're going to have homogenization here.

353
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:25,760
It's like on iOS, there's a version of Firefox, right?

354
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:27,520
But it's not based on Gecko.

355
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:29,300
It's not really Firefox, is it?

356
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:35,200
It's just Mozilla wrapping their stuff around Apple technologies.

357
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,460
And you've got the same thing here with Android now.

358
00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:43,760
They're going to use, albeit open source stuff from Android, but it's not going to be their

359
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:44,940
own thing, is it?

360
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:51,320
It's going to be just their brand stuck on a collection of existing Android technologies.

361
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:55,480
Maybe that's unfair because it's obviously going to take a lot more work than that sounds,

362
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:59,520
but it's not going to be as differentiated as it is now.

363
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:01,860
What doth make the browser you ask?

364
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:08,200
Is it the experience around the browser like password and bookmark sync and built-in features

365
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:13,920
like pocket and blocking of certain kinds of ads and tracking and maybe containers in

366
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:20,240
the future for different accounts, or is it the rendering engine, WebKit versus Gecko?

367
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:24,840
I would argue that it is not the latter.

368
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:29,920
I would argue that it is actually the experience around the web browser now, not so much the

369
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:30,920
actual rendering.

370
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:31,960
I don't think users care.

371
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:34,060
I think that's pretty obvious on its face.

372
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:38,600
And the reality is that when you use the components of the platform, you inherit the additional

373
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:42,840
benefits of new features that the platform provider creates.

374
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:48,240
In Apple's case, it's iOS, and in Google's case, it's Android, and they're consistently

375
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:50,600
making investments in that technology stack.

376
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:54,760
And also it means that you have to do a lot less testing, don't you?

377
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:59,360
If you're using the same rendering engine, you know that a website that works on Chrome

378
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:01,560
is almost certainly going to work on Firefox.

379
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:06,880
And as you say, then you've got the other added value there with the syncing and stuff.

380
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:10,240
So I do see the argument, but it just feels a bit sad to me.

381
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:15,820
It's not like Mozilla haven't got a few quid to spend on this, but I suppose they have

382
00:22:15,820 --> 00:22:21,140
to divert their resources where they're required and where it makes sense to do so.

383
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:26,160
But it was always nice to have proper Firefox on Android.

384
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:28,960
And now it feels like we're not going to have that anymore.

385
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:29,960
I agree.

386
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:33,800
And it reminds us of the massive dominance that WebKit now has.

387
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:39,120
Well yeah, Chrome is just default everywhere, seemingly.

388
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:45,720
On Windows, Edge is just nowhere at this point, and Firefox is just trailing behind.

389
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:50,840
And even on Linux, how many people who use Linux on their desktop or laptop use Chrome

390
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:51,840
as their main driver?

391
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:52,840
Yeah, it's a good portion.

392
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:57,200
I mean, I think Firefox is still pretty well represented because it's the default still

393
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:58,460
on a lot of distros.

394
00:22:58,460 --> 00:23:03,660
And I'll just note, too, I'm using WebKit as kind of shorthand for a lot of the WebKit-based

395
00:23:03,660 --> 00:23:06,720
rendering engines like Google's own.

396
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:08,600
There's sort of a large category.

397
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:13,320
WebKit itself has kind of become rather fractured in the last five years, but it's still kind

398
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:15,280
of all the same beast.

399
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:19,840
And so when we had Trident and Gecko as sort of the last standout rendering engines now,

400
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:24,440
it seems like as long as Firefox remains relevant on the desktop, Gecko will still have an important

401
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:25,440
place.

402
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:28,280
But I think this is just Mozilla being practical here.

403
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:35,300
It seems that a Gecko-based standalone browser on the Android platform was either unsustainable

404
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:37,720
or just not popular enough to matter.

405
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:43,240
And so perhaps they can make this change and see an increase in users as a result, which

406
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:46,120
will make them a relevant player on the Android platform.

407
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:47,120
And that's good for everybody.

408
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:51,200
Well, I really hope so, but I'm not holding my breath, I'm afraid.

409
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:54,540
This next story stands out personally for me because it's like they ripped the carpet

410
00:23:54,540 --> 00:23:55,540
out from underneath me.

411
00:23:55,540 --> 00:24:02,620
I was about to go on the air Tuesday for Linux Unplug and cover ARM's new Get the Fax campaign

412
00:24:02,620 --> 00:24:07,880
against RISC-V. And right as I was preparing to go on air, I realized they'd pulled the

413
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:12,320
whole thing down, but it started really as a shot across the bow.

414
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:14,060
Well, that's one way to look at it.

415
00:24:14,060 --> 00:24:20,440
Another way is a very long-term death rattle maybe from ARM, looking over at what RISC-V

416
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:28,400
are doing and how that is an open standard and how it may eventually eat ARM's lunch.

417
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:32,080
It was very misjudged, there's no doubt about that.

418
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:34,680
And it really played their hand, didn't it?

419
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:37,240
Talk about not keeping your cards close to your chest.

420
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:40,680
It was basically them just admitting all the stuff they're worried about, wasn't it?

421
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:44,800
Yeah, they really try to raise five concerns before you go design your own system on a

422
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:45,800
chip.

423
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:51,240
They say that the portions that RISC solve by being open source really only solve a small

424
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:55,720
part of the overall problem and that when you're investing in a commercial processor,

425
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:58,840
it's more than just having access to the designs.

426
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:03,680
And they say RISC-V doesn't yet have a large developer ecosystem like ARM does, so that's

427
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:05,600
a disadvantage.

428
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:10,120
And there's risk of fragmentation with something that's open source.

429
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:15,760
They also point out that it's not very mature yet, at least not as mature as ARM is obviously.

430
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:20,080
And that there could be some greater design costs with RISC-V due to potential revalidation

431
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:22,880
if you have to modify the original ISA.

432
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:28,200
So just avoid the whole thing, ARM says, and stick with ARM because better to the devil

433
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:30,320
you know than the devil you don't.

434
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:34,000
Can you imagine Intel coming out with something similar about ARM?

435
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,880
I mean, maybe back in their scrappy days.

436
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:41,680
Maybe they'd be saying this kind of stuff in meetings, maybe with clients that are under

437
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:48,600
NDA or something, but I cannot imagine them even at any point saying this stuff publicly.

438
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:52,800
Yeah, that's why I was really ramping up to have a go at them on Tuesday.

439
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:58,200
But it appears there was some sort of internal staff revolt, as different outlets are calling

440
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:02,000
it, that prompted them to pull the page down before it really got very far.

441
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:06,840
Well, you can imagine how many internal emails must have been sent going, what are you doing

442
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:08,000
exactly with this?

443
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,240
Yeah, really, no kidding.

444
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:15,680
Miguel Itacaza on Twitter said, ARM's negative campaign against RISC-V can only backfire.

445
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:19,840
The Gnomon Xamarin co-founder also said, their points are kind of weak.

446
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:25,400
This was attempted before against open source, and all it achieved was egg on people's faces.

447
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:27,000
And that's exactly what's happened here.

448
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,560
It's classic.

449
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:33,060
You go after open source because you try to say it's fragmented, it's hard to predict,

450
00:26:33,060 --> 00:26:38,080
go with us, we're safe, we're commercial, it just always comes across as looking petty

451
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:39,560
and looking defensive.

452
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:43,560
And what do you think about how they backtracked on it by just pulling the website down, and

453
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:46,360
now there's just a blank page there?

454
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:50,200
I thought that was great.

455
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:51,760
Like just nothing.

456
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:52,760
Nothing to see here.

457
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:53,760
Nope.

458
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:54,760
Nothing ever here.

459
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:55,760
Don't worry about a thing.

460
00:26:55,760 --> 00:27:00,040
And unfortunately, archive.org didn't manage to cache the page.

461
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:04,200
So I think it might be lost to history apart from the odd screenshot here and there.

462
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:08,480
But I don't know, I think that probably it was a good strategy to just pull it down and

463
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:12,080
pretend that it hadn't happened, rather than a big apology or anything that's just going

464
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:13,520
to drag it out.

465
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:17,280
Because we're talking about it now, but we'll probably, or certainly a lot of people will

466
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:19,760
have forgotten about it in another few months, I would have thought.

467
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:23,440
Yeah, but now we definitely know it's on their radar, and they're a little worried about

468
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:24,440
it.

469
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:25,960
Yeah, it's rattled their cage, hasn't it?

470
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:27,720
And that's good.

471
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:32,840
It's made RISC-V more legitimate as a architecture, isn't it?

472
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:33,840
Maybe so.

473
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:35,120
I don't think ARM's going anywhere.

474
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:36,400
So I don't think they have to worry.

475
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:41,320
But you know, there may be a portion of their market that they end up losing to RISC-V as

476
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:42,720
it starts to bear fruit.

477
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:45,160
So they really should be kind of concerned.

478
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:46,560
I think there's legitimacy to it.

479
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:50,080
Yeah, I mean, this is not going to affect their, at least for the time being, their

480
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:54,560
snapdragons and stuff in the high end smartphones and the clusters in the data center.

481
00:27:54,560 --> 00:28:00,160
This is the IoT stuff, the real low power, low level stuff where RISC-V can potentially

482
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:01,820
compete with them.

483
00:28:01,820 --> 00:28:05,220
And that is often the bread and butter of a company, isn't it?

484
00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:07,600
We talk about the flagships, and that's the exciting stuff.

485
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:13,480
But really, it's the low cost stuff and low power stuff that they're pumping out loads

486
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:15,080
of that actually makes them the money.

487
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:18,240
Yeah, it's the fight for IoT is what it is.

488
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:22,040
It's the fight for the future revenues of the IoT revolution.

489
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:27,440
Yeah, and you have to be forward thinking because maybe RISC-V will get to a point where

490
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:31,340
it can compete with snapdragons and stuff at some point.

491
00:28:31,340 --> 00:28:36,440
And they don't want to just be snoozing like Intel have been doing for the past 10 years.

492
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:40,640
Debian caught our attention this week when they joined KDE's advisory board.

493
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:44,160
Looks like they're also joining other distributions like Ubuntu and OpenSUSE.

494
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:48,520
Yeah, yet more people embracing KDE and Plasma.

495
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:52,240
You've been going on about it long enough, and obviously, Debian must have been listening

496
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:53,240
to the shows, eh?

497
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:56,040
Yeah, I'm sure that's what it is.

498
00:28:56,040 --> 00:29:01,840
You know, KDE has really been a great platform on Debian for a long time, and so they've

499
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:03,760
had a strong relationship for a long time.

500
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:07,440
And I think the two projects really consider this formalizing that relationship.

501
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:12,200
In fact, the Debian project leader Chris Lam wrote, the KDE Plasma desktop environment

502
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:17,120
is fully supported within Debian, and thus the Debian project is extremely excited to

503
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:23,800
be formally recognizing the relationship between itself and KDE, especially how that will greatly

504
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:27,480
increase and facilitate our communication and collaboration.

505
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:32,180
I wonder what this means in terms of the Debian defaults, because for a long time Gnome was

506
00:29:32,180 --> 00:29:36,800
a default, then they changed to XFCE briefly, and I was cheering that decision.

507
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:42,320
But I wonder, does it mean maybe we might get Plasma as a default in the Debian installer?

508
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:47,320
Well, we are all sliding into that Wayland future, Joe, so maybe.

509
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:52,080
Maybe they're thinking down the road at some point they'll want something that's really

510
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:54,120
feature complete on Wayland.

511
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:58,540
But in the meantime, I just see it as a formalizing of something that's probably been sort of

512
00:29:58,540 --> 00:30:00,720
unofficial for a long time.

513
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:07,440
If it led to Plasma as the default on Debian, I would be 100% for that.

514
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:09,080
That sounds like a wicked good combo.

515
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:11,440
Well, they could do a lot worse than Plasma as default.

516
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:15,960
I've grown to really respect what they've been doing, and it's not quite enough to drag

517
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:20,400
me away from XFCE at this point, but it gets more and more attractive every time I look

518
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:21,400
at it.

519
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:24,960
And if something like that were to ever happen, or anything else that does happen in the world

520
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:28,600
