Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News.

00:05.360 --> 00:09.280
Episode 122, recorded on September 8th, 2019.

00:09.280 --> 00:10.280
I'm Chris.

00:10.280 --> 00:11.280
And I'm Joe.

00:11.280 --> 00:12.280
Hello, Joe.

00:12.280 --> 00:13.280
Good to be connected with you.

00:13.280 --> 00:15.280
Android 10 starts us off this week.

00:15.280 --> 00:18.440
I'm curious, did you pull the trigger on a Pixel device to try it out?

00:18.440 --> 00:23.960
I actually looked on eBay, and they're not that expensive, and I was so tempted.

00:23.960 --> 00:28.240
But no, I held back, so unfortunately I just had to watch videos and read articles about

00:28.240 --> 00:29.240
it.

00:29.240 --> 00:32.880
It's a lot to consume, and we have links to some of the best in the show notes, but there's

00:32.880 --> 00:36.120
a few details that I guess you and I could talk about.

00:36.120 --> 00:41.120
Mostly, it's worth, I suppose, mentioning the elephant in the room right at the beginning.

00:41.120 --> 00:44.740
There's a handful of devices that are gonna get the new Android 10.

00:44.740 --> 00:52.640
Pixel devices, a couple other premium OEM devices, but a lot, and I mean most, of the

00:52.640 --> 00:55.840
handsets may never get Android 10.

00:55.840 --> 00:56.920
But it is rolling out.

00:56.920 --> 01:00.800
Most Pixel users have been able to try it in beta, which I've been using it for a long

01:00.800 --> 01:04.320
time in beta, and I would imagine I must have the final update right now.

01:04.320 --> 01:05.320
I just haven't checked.

01:05.320 --> 01:11.840
And there's so many things in here, Joe, that I think both represent a lot of change for

01:11.840 --> 01:16.680
Android, but also make it maybe my favorite Android release ever.

01:16.680 --> 01:23.620
I know that sounds super enthusiastic, but there's legitimately good features that protect

01:23.620 --> 01:28.360
privacy that have been missing from Android that are finally here in Android 10.

01:28.360 --> 01:33.340
Well, like being able to grant an app permission to use your location, but only when you're

01:33.340 --> 01:36.200
using the app and not when it's running in the background.

01:36.200 --> 01:40.440
That just seems to be such a basic thing that you would have expected a long time ago, but

01:40.440 --> 01:44.880
I suppose, well, at least we've got it now for those few phones that do have Android

01:44.880 --> 01:45.880
10.

01:45.880 --> 01:50.760
Also, a really nice addition, apps will not be able to access the unchangeable device

01:50.760 --> 01:56.820
identifiers, which are things like your IEMI, things that you don't really want leaked out

01:56.820 --> 01:59.120
there are blocked now.

01:59.120 --> 02:02.800
There's no longer the possibility for apps to silently start and run in the background

02:02.800 --> 02:03.800
anymore.

02:03.800 --> 02:06.320
They will have to pop up a notification saying they're running.

02:06.320 --> 02:09.320
Could be kind of annoying, could be great though.

02:09.320 --> 02:16.080
Wi-Fi information is more restricted to the apps, and they're also working on required

02:16.080 --> 02:21.000
encrypted storage, as well as other small tweaks that I think are just nice to see that

02:21.000 --> 02:24.160
make it more approachable for human beings, which is always nice.

02:24.160 --> 02:29.160
Google's adjusted where all of this stuff is now, so it's all located in one place in

02:29.160 --> 02:31.120
the settings called privacy.

02:31.120 --> 02:32.120
It's just really simple.

02:32.120 --> 02:36.760
Yeah, it does seem to be simplified, although they have somewhat complicated other aspects

02:36.760 --> 02:39.720
of it, like with the digital wellbeing stuff.

02:39.720 --> 02:43.480
Now they've got do not disturb as well as this new focus mode.

02:43.480 --> 02:50.520
If you're keeping track, there's now like six different ways in current Android to essentially

02:50.520 --> 02:51.520
achieve the same thing.

02:51.520 --> 02:57.520
You've got do not disturb, focus mode, app timers, which are part of the digital wellbeing

02:57.520 --> 02:58.520
suite.

02:58.520 --> 03:03.080
Then you have notification priority settings, which suppress some notifications.

03:03.080 --> 03:07.360
Then you have channels within notifications, which hide some notifications that are different

03:07.360 --> 03:10.880
for different apps, and then you have parental controls, which can lock some of this stuff

03:10.880 --> 03:11.880
down too.

03:11.880 --> 03:15.400
So you have six different ways to achieve kind of the same thing, but they all offer

03:15.400 --> 03:17.240
a different solution.

03:17.240 --> 03:24.560
This is the part of Android 10 where I feel like it gives the perpetual beta feeling to

03:24.560 --> 03:25.560
Android.

03:25.560 --> 03:27.240
Like it always is sort of changing.

03:27.240 --> 03:29.200
New things are getting added that are great.

03:29.200 --> 03:31.680
The way to do things gets removed.

03:31.680 --> 03:36.000
Something that's obviously needed, like some of these privacy settings gets added.

03:36.000 --> 03:40.680
It doesn't make any particular release feel like it's the release of Android.

03:40.680 --> 03:44.520
It's just like another iterative release, which is both good and bad.

03:44.520 --> 03:47.760
I would love to just sort of feel like it's iterative polish at this point, but it still

03:47.760 --> 03:48.760
feels like fundamentals.

03:48.760 --> 03:54.220
Well, a couple of releases ago, they did have a kind of spit and polish release where nothing

03:54.220 --> 03:59.520
much changed and they did all the kind of basic under the hood stuff.

03:59.520 --> 04:05.840
And so now we're kind of in the next couple of releases where they are adding all the

04:05.840 --> 04:10.540
features and then they'll probably slow down again for the next one or maybe the one after

04:10.540 --> 04:11.540
that.

04:11.540 --> 04:17.000
It's kind of almost like with Ubuntu releases where you've got your interims and your LTSs.

04:17.000 --> 04:18.880
Only with Android, it's not really official.

04:18.880 --> 04:19.880
Yeah, it's true.

04:19.880 --> 04:20.960
It's a good way to look at it.

04:20.960 --> 04:27.720
I think also it sort of leans on the OEM's role in finalizing Android for better or for

04:27.720 --> 04:32.860
worse before it goes out to most people, except for those of us on pixels really.

04:32.860 --> 04:37.820
And while I can't really eloquently phrase the way I feel about this, I think the end

04:37.820 --> 04:39.240
of the Verge review really nailed it.

04:39.240 --> 04:40.320
We'll put a link in the show notes.

04:40.320 --> 04:44.500
They write Android 10 is not a milestone, it's a mile marker.

04:44.500 --> 04:49.240
It has made real progress and is heading in the right direction, but the landscape still

04:49.240 --> 04:50.240
looks the same.

04:50.240 --> 04:52.580
A lot of phones won't get the updates.

04:52.580 --> 04:54.680
Some of the features are sort of conflicting with each other.

04:54.680 --> 04:59.520
The new gesture system looks good, but it is lacking like the back button functionality

04:59.520 --> 05:04.400
is really weak with the new gesture system just drove me crazy when I used it, but you

05:04.400 --> 05:08.240
can see they're almost there like one more iteration and it's going to be pretty good.

05:08.240 --> 05:13.040
But at this point, I would love to just see some of these features be nailed, the digital

05:13.040 --> 05:18.380
well-being really solid, the touch gestures as good as they are on iOS.

05:18.380 --> 05:21.340
Just nail those few things in a release.

05:21.340 --> 05:25.960
And yet it's the release I'm probably the most excited about in a long time because

05:25.960 --> 05:28.920
of some of these fundamentals they've improved.

05:28.920 --> 05:31.180
I feel like Android's getting there now.

05:31.180 --> 05:34.800
It's really kind of answering some of those privacy criticisms that I had, at least when

05:34.800 --> 05:35.800
it comes to settings.

05:35.800 --> 05:38.040
Who really knows what's going on in the background?

05:38.040 --> 05:40.320
But at least when it comes to user configuration settings.

05:40.320 --> 05:44.640
I'm very surprised that we haven't mentioned dark mode yet, which is something I've had

05:44.640 --> 05:47.720
on LineageOS for what feels like years at this point.

05:47.720 --> 05:49.920
I was just waiting smugly for you to bring it up.

05:49.920 --> 05:52.600
You know, I just want to take my victory lap here.

05:52.600 --> 05:56.480
Well, yeah, you did predict that this year was going to be all about dark mode, which

05:56.480 --> 05:58.520
I think everyone agreed with.

05:58.520 --> 06:04.460
But it seems pretty cool that it will even skin lighter apps that don't have a proper

06:04.460 --> 06:05.460
dark mode themselves.

06:05.460 --> 06:09.780
It'll just kind of interpret how they should be dark, although it does seem a bit hit and

06:09.780 --> 06:10.920
miss at this point.

06:10.920 --> 06:14.440
My expectation is that's going to take a little while to sort things out.

06:14.440 --> 06:19.240
As far as kind of neat features go, USB port contamination and overheating detection has

06:19.240 --> 06:21.760
to be, I think, one of my favorite.

06:21.760 --> 06:26.360
This is a feature that will disable the USB port on your phone if it detects liquids or

06:26.360 --> 06:28.520
debris in there that could short it out.

06:28.520 --> 06:32.720
The Android system will post a notification informing the user that the USB port has been

06:32.720 --> 06:34.640
disabled.

06:34.640 --> 06:38.280
Once the USB port is cleaned out and free of any liquid or contaminants, the system

06:38.280 --> 06:39.280
will notify the user.

06:39.280 --> 06:41.720
It's safe to reinsert accessories.

06:41.720 --> 06:46.200
And also, in addition, some of this will vary, though, keep in mind, depending on your OEM

06:46.200 --> 06:47.200
implementation.

06:47.200 --> 06:51.080
But in addition to this, they have a second feature in there that's been added to Android

06:51.080 --> 06:56.680
10 that will advise the user to unplug the cable, the charging cable, from the phone

06:56.680 --> 07:02.440
when the phone starts overheating, which with some of these rando USB-C chargers out there

07:02.440 --> 07:04.360
is totally possible.

07:04.360 --> 07:09.720
So the system waits until it reaches 60 degrees Celsius, which it considers critical in the

07:09.720 --> 07:11.520
battery charging area.

07:11.520 --> 07:13.200
It'll start alerting the user.

07:13.200 --> 07:18.200
And then emergency mode is when the system reaches 65 degrees Celsius.

07:18.200 --> 07:21.560
I think the biggest feature is a feature that isn't there yet.

07:21.560 --> 07:25.700
They've announced it, but it's coming soon to Pixel devices.

07:25.700 --> 07:30.400
And that is live caption, which is basically giving you closed captions for everything

07:30.400 --> 07:32.600
on the phone that has got voice.

07:32.600 --> 07:38.800
So whether that is videos you're watching, or people you're talking to, or just anything

07:38.800 --> 07:43.720
with content that's got voices on it, which is a major accessibility feature, but it's

07:43.720 --> 07:49.120
also handy for just if you're on a train or just somewhere in polite company, haven't

07:49.120 --> 07:52.800
got your headphones connected, and you want to watch stuff on mute.

07:52.800 --> 07:57.080
Also just a couple of honorable mentions, Vulkan everywhere is a pretty big deal that's

07:57.080 --> 08:01.800
going to have longer term ramifications for Android gaming and desktop Linux.

08:01.800 --> 08:05.520
That's pretty exciting because a lot of those games will likely get developed on Linux.

08:05.520 --> 08:07.320
So I think that gets an honorable mention.

08:07.320 --> 08:10.560
And then there's another feature which we don't really know how it's going to play out

08:10.560 --> 08:13.480
yet, but it seems to have serious potential.

08:13.480 --> 08:20.120
And that is, in a sense, Google has widened what it can patch via play services.

08:20.120 --> 08:25.740
And the way they're writing about this is that really important Android zero day type

08:25.740 --> 08:31.120
security issues will be pushed automatically via the play API.

08:31.120 --> 08:34.440
Basically bypassing the OEM update process.

08:34.440 --> 08:36.400
That could be great for Android security.

08:36.400 --> 08:39.720
But again, we just kind of have to wait and see how that particular thing shakes out,

08:39.720 --> 08:40.720
just like Vulkan.

08:40.720 --> 08:45.600
Yeah, that looks like it's only going to be for phones that ship with Android 10, not

08:45.600 --> 08:47.160
ones that get updated to it.

08:47.160 --> 08:50.880
So I think it's going to be a while before we actually see that feature properly rolling

08:50.880 --> 08:51.880
out.

08:51.880 --> 08:54.320
And maybe one last honorable mention.

08:54.320 --> 08:55.320
There's a lot here.

08:55.320 --> 09:00.520
We have really useful links in the show notes at LinuxActionNews.com slash 122.

09:00.520 --> 09:06.400
But when you read Google's official developer blog post about Android 10, it is packed full

09:06.400 --> 09:13.360
of phrases like on device learning and privacy and encryption and keeping your data secure.

09:13.360 --> 09:18.600
There's a lot of things in this post that read like Apple talking points.

09:18.600 --> 09:23.920
I think there's a real interesting push and pull happening in privacy right now.

09:23.920 --> 09:27.480
And it's clearly changed the way they're thinking about Android.

09:27.480 --> 09:29.920
I think this is a good benefit for everybody.

09:29.920 --> 09:30.920
I don't know.

09:30.920 --> 09:33.600
We'll have to wait and see how genuine some of these statements are.

09:33.600 --> 09:37.120
But it's clear that they're getting a signal from the market that people care about this

09:37.120 --> 09:38.120
kind of stuff.

09:38.120 --> 09:39.600
I'll give you an example.

09:39.600 --> 09:44.560
Android 10 uses on device machine learning to suggest contextual actions and notification.

09:44.560 --> 09:48.580
Quote, keeping the machine learning processing completely on the device.

09:48.580 --> 09:52.780
We've built this feature with user privacy in mind.

09:52.780 --> 09:56.360
That's the world's biggest data collection company saying they're shifting to on device

09:56.360 --> 09:58.040
local processing.

09:58.040 --> 10:00.200
I think that's a big sea change for them.

10:00.200 --> 10:03.760
Well, they're certainly trying to project that image of caring about privacy and stuff.

10:03.760 --> 10:06.220
So that would tie in with that.

10:06.220 --> 10:09.840
How much of that processing is actually going to happen on the phone?

10:09.840 --> 10:11.520
I'm a bit skeptical, really.

10:11.520 --> 10:12.520
We'll see.

10:12.520 --> 10:15.720
Certain devices could have dedicated silicon for this kind of thing.

10:15.720 --> 10:17.600
The CPUs on these things are monsters.

10:17.600 --> 10:19.320
They got a ton of memory.

10:19.320 --> 10:23.600
I mean, these are better than computers I had as a kid by an order of magnitude.

10:23.600 --> 10:24.600
It may be possible.

10:24.600 --> 10:25.600
Possibly.

10:25.600 --> 10:29.400
But we'll have to wait and see I'm skeptical, as I say.

10:29.400 --> 10:32.640
One final honorable mention is the essential phone.

10:32.640 --> 10:37.560
And that was updated on release day as well, which I was very surprised that you talked

10:37.560 --> 10:38.560
about flagships.

10:38.560 --> 10:43.280
I mean, that's getting on a bit now and essential I thought were not doing brilliantly financially

10:43.280 --> 10:44.280
and stuff.

10:44.280 --> 10:48.560
So I was very surprised to see them shipping Android 10 on release day.

10:48.560 --> 10:50.440
Good to see them living up to that brand commitment.

10:50.440 --> 10:51.440
That is really nice.

10:51.440 --> 10:54.760
Yeah, it kind of does bode well for if they do put another phone out.

10:54.760 --> 10:57.720
I think it will be good for consumer confidence there.

10:57.720 --> 11:01.520
Well, while we're talking about phones, it's real, Joe.

11:01.520 --> 11:06.920
The Pine phone is real and production may be ramping up sooner than a lot of us expected.

11:06.920 --> 11:11.200
Well, it's certainly sooner than I thought it'd be shipping because I saw the dev kit

11:11.200 --> 11:12.200
and hands on with it.

11:12.200 --> 11:14.440
And that was only a couple of months ago.

11:14.440 --> 11:16.840
And the software situation was rough.

11:16.840 --> 11:18.920
It was really rough.

11:18.920 --> 11:22.320
And Pine 64 had made no bones about that.

11:22.320 --> 11:27.640
They said it wasn't ready, but in the last month or so, there have been some serious

11:27.640 --> 11:35.520
developments with plasma mobile and Ubuntu touch and things are looking really pretty

11:35.520 --> 11:36.520
good.

11:36.520 --> 11:41.040
And so I can see why now they've gone into this very early production run where it's

11:41.040 --> 11:43.020
only for developers.

11:43.020 --> 11:47.940
The orders that they're taking now, you have to email them and explain why you want it.

11:47.940 --> 11:53.900
This isn't for people like me who just want to tinker with it or even app developers.

11:53.900 --> 11:57.320
This is for people who are actually working on these mobile systems.

11:57.320 --> 12:01.520
Well, that probably makes a lot of sense considering the rough state it would be in the first initial

12:01.520 --> 12:02.520
run.

12:02.520 --> 12:07.080
Well, yeah, they don't want to ship something to normal people that isn't ready.

12:07.080 --> 12:12.080
They are taking it very kind of gingerly and slowly.

12:12.080 --> 12:16.400
And they are completely reliant on the community for the software of this thing, as is their

12:16.400 --> 12:17.720
kind of usual style.

12:17.720 --> 12:21.240
I do like that they're being upfront about that before they take anyone's money and they're

12:21.240 --> 12:22.240
not making it easy.

12:22.240 --> 12:24.420
There's not like a buy now button on their website.

12:24.420 --> 12:28.080
You have to contact them, talk about how you're going to contribute.

12:28.080 --> 12:30.960
And then they make it clear on their website when the future batches should be available

12:30.960 --> 12:37.240
that might be more larger scale, better build that are probably the ones general consumers

12:37.240 --> 12:40.240
would want to purchase or tinkerers even.

12:40.240 --> 12:42.320
It's good that they caveat it though.

12:42.320 --> 12:47.400
They always say like, well, these schedules might slip and we're not making any firm promises,

12:47.400 --> 12:50.320
but we expect to be shipping on these dates.

12:50.320 --> 12:56.820
And so it's going to be several months before I can buy one, I think, but that might end

12:56.820 --> 12:58.640
up slipping to be a few more months.

12:58.640 --> 13:01.280
And they've been completely upfront about that.

13:01.280 --> 13:02.760
And I really admire that.

13:02.760 --> 13:06.960
The other thing to note is the price is pretty swallable for a phone in this state.

13:06.960 --> 13:08.880
It's around $150.

13:08.880 --> 13:09.880
That's not bad.

13:09.880 --> 13:15.400
Yeah, but you can get a phone with similar specs for significantly less than that because

13:15.400 --> 13:17.560
this thing is not exactly a flagship.

13:17.560 --> 13:22.920
But given that it's small runs and a small company, $150 for a phone that's running a

13:22.920 --> 13:29.360
proper GNU slash Linux based operating system as opposed to Android, I think that it's reasonable.

13:29.360 --> 13:35.320
It's the kind of money that you're not going to have to convince your spouse too hard to

13:35.320 --> 13:36.320
let you spend.

13:36.320 --> 13:37.320
Yeah.

13:37.320 --> 13:40.600
And my understanding is, correct me if I'm wrong, they're going to go with Plasma Mobile

13:40.600 --> 13:44.800
for the default UI, but I've seen Ubuntu Touch running on this thing.

13:44.800 --> 13:45.800
Yeah.

13:45.800 --> 13:48.160
And Sailfish OS, there's quite a few different options there.

13:48.160 --> 13:53.160
But also in this post, they mentioned the Pinebook Pro and how exactly the kill switches

13:53.160 --> 13:54.160
are going to work and everything.

13:54.160 --> 13:56.180
So it's well worth having a read about that.

13:56.180 --> 14:00.360
And I'm hoping that I'm going to get my hands on a review unit, which I'm hoping I might

14:00.360 --> 14:01.360
get to keep.

14:01.360 --> 14:06.520
I'll have to see about that fairly soon within the next few weeks, hopefully.

14:06.520 --> 14:08.840
So I'll definitely be reporting back on that.

14:08.840 --> 14:09.840
Ooh.

14:09.840 --> 14:10.840
Yeah, fingers crossed.

14:10.840 --> 14:14.960
Well, the theme of the software releases this week is privacy, and Mozilla has released

14:14.960 --> 14:17.200
Firefox 69.

14:17.200 --> 14:22.020
Enhanced tracking protection will be turned on by default, as well as blocking autoplay

14:22.020 --> 14:24.780
for videos that start playing.

14:24.780 --> 14:28.760
Not just the ones with sound, like a lot of those freaking news articles that start, but

14:28.760 --> 14:29.760
it's muted.

14:29.760 --> 14:30.760
That gets them anything?

14:30.760 --> 14:31.760
Yeah.

14:31.760 --> 14:32.760
It's blogging that now too.

14:32.760 --> 14:35.200
There's just other nice little quality of life things in there.

14:35.200 --> 14:37.560
Windows 10 users specifically get a few upgrades.

14:37.560 --> 14:39.160
Mac users get a few nice things.

14:39.160 --> 14:42.120
But us Linux users, we're happy with our tracking blocking.

14:42.120 --> 14:43.120
That's fine.

14:43.120 --> 14:44.120
That's good.

14:44.120 --> 14:46.940
You know, I'm all Wayland right now with Firefox, Joe, it is smooth.

14:46.940 --> 14:48.600
It is smoother than Chrome.

14:48.600 --> 14:52.680
There's a few glitches with Chrome, but Firefox on Wayland, smooth.

14:52.680 --> 14:57.560
We've had this cookie blocking and crypto mining blocking for a while, but it is important

14:57.560 --> 15:02.040
now that it is default and you know it's working when you get a little shield.

15:02.040 --> 15:03.440
That's always reassuring, isn't it?

15:03.440 --> 15:04.440
I do like the shield.

15:04.440 --> 15:05.440
It's the small things.

15:05.440 --> 15:10.600
I'll tell you, you know, there's a, like a esoteric quote unquote change in this version

15:10.600 --> 15:16.920
of Firefox that I think shows a genuine depth of which they are thinking about user privacy.

15:16.920 --> 15:22.080
They know with the deprecation of Adobe flash player, there's no longer a need to identify

15:22.080 --> 15:27.320
users on 32 bit versions of Firefox or 64 bit versions.

15:27.320 --> 15:31.440
So they're just taking that aspect out of the user agent to reduce fingerprinting because

15:31.440 --> 15:35.120
it's one of the factors, you know, one of the things unique about you, if you're 32

15:35.120 --> 15:39.800
bit or 64 bit that they can use, tracking can and they're just going to pull it out

15:39.800 --> 15:40.800
because they don't need it.

15:40.800 --> 15:41.800
You know what?

15:41.800 --> 15:42.800
They don't need it.

15:42.800 --> 15:43.800
Yeah, that is a good move.

15:43.800 --> 15:47.440
And you can turn on the anti fingerprinting stuff already and they say that they're looking

15:47.440 --> 15:52.520
to make it default in the near future, which is good because there was a post on the tour

15:52.520 --> 15:58.480
blog this week about fingerprinting and I read it and I'm scared.

15:58.480 --> 16:04.560
Quite frankly, I had no idea quite how in depth and easy this stuff was.

16:04.560 --> 16:10.880
Yeah, there's all kinds of little ways your system leaks information about you that are

16:10.880 --> 16:16.560
obvious in retrospect, like the user ID agent or specific font capabilities that your browser

16:16.560 --> 16:18.560
presents that it has.

16:18.560 --> 16:24.880
But I think what is happening behind the scenes is this tracking thing is really, really beginning

16:24.880 --> 16:26.040
to brew.

16:26.040 --> 16:30.880
We're going to see a lot of different things being claimed like Google just recently shot

16:30.880 --> 16:36.280
over at Apple for their hardline anti tracking stance, then Apple shot back at them for having

16:36.280 --> 16:38.000
no anti tracking.

16:38.000 --> 16:42.680
And it's this public back and forth between two giant corporations, of course, at the

16:42.680 --> 16:43.680
individual level.

16:43.680 --> 16:49.160
And then you also have the industry, the ad industry, quote unquote, the IAB that is working

16:49.160 --> 16:55.440
on a universal tracking system that sounds kind of spooky, but they think is really great.

16:55.440 --> 16:57.480
This something here is about to break.

16:57.480 --> 17:02.680
I wouldn't be surprised if it doesn't take till 2020, but something here's got to give

17:02.680 --> 17:06.120
to tectonic plates that are just really pushing against each other right now.

17:06.120 --> 17:10.720
Did you go to my unique.org and see if you're unique with your fingerprint?

17:10.720 --> 17:12.000
All right, I'll go right now.

17:12.000 --> 17:13.000
You ready?

17:13.000 --> 17:14.000
Am I unique.org?

17:14.000 --> 17:15.000
This is the studio machine.

17:15.000 --> 17:17.440
So this isn't my regular machine.

17:17.440 --> 17:18.440
Let's see.

17:18.440 --> 17:19.440
I'll view my browser fingerprint.

17:19.440 --> 17:20.440
Ah, yeah.

17:20.440 --> 17:21.440
Yes, I am.

17:21.440 --> 17:22.440
Yeah.

17:22.440 --> 17:23.440
So am I.

17:23.440 --> 17:32.240
It says, yes, you can be tracked because I'm using Ubuntu version 69, UTC plus one, English,

17:32.240 --> 17:35.120
because there's so many different things they can use to fingerprint you.

17:35.120 --> 17:39.360
And of over a million samples that they have, I'm unique.

17:39.360 --> 17:41.400
So I must be pretty easy to track.

17:41.400 --> 17:44.400
Yeah, it's all kinds of things you don't like I said, you don't consider.

17:44.400 --> 17:48.100
Does your browser support certain types of compression formats?

17:48.100 --> 17:50.200
It can add all of these up.

17:50.200 --> 17:52.840
And eventually kind of gets a pretty solid idea.

17:52.840 --> 17:56.880
And for what they're going for, I mean, this isn't medical science, right?

17:56.880 --> 17:57.880
It's ad tracking science.

17:57.880 --> 18:03.600
So if they get within pretty close, that's good enough for ad work, really.

18:03.600 --> 18:04.600
And they get there now.

18:04.600 --> 18:11.400
And so it's interesting to see Firefox just making really small adjustments deep down,

18:11.400 --> 18:15.600
like taking out the 32 and 64 bit identifier, because, yeah, we don't have to support flash

18:15.600 --> 18:16.600
anymore.

18:16.600 --> 18:17.600
We don't need this.

18:17.600 --> 18:20.400
And just kind of making these low level tweaks over time that are making it harder and harder

18:20.400 --> 18:21.400
to track.

18:21.400 --> 18:24.240
And you've got Apple, who's taking that hard line stance.

18:24.240 --> 18:28.360
And then you've got Google, who's working with the IAB to try to come up with this universal

18:28.360 --> 18:34.900
token that isn't tied to your name, but is unique to you, which would allow you to also

18:34.900 --> 18:39.760
universally opt out if everyone used this system and respected that setting.

18:39.760 --> 18:41.760
Well, just like do not track, eh?

18:41.760 --> 18:44.120
Yeah, just like that.

18:44.120 --> 18:51.480
It is really great to see Mozilla taking strides here and taking a lead, really.

18:51.480 --> 18:56.120
I know that Apple's kind of doing it as well to some extent, but Mozilla is not being left

18:56.120 --> 18:57.480
behind.

18:57.480 --> 19:02.820
And I'm tempted to turn on that anti-fingerprinting, but it does warn you that things will break.

19:02.820 --> 19:05.840
So maybe I should just do it and see what happens.

19:05.840 --> 19:07.400
Wouldn't be bad to try it for a little while.

19:07.400 --> 19:08.400
Yeah.

19:08.400 --> 19:10.200
I've tried NoScript here and there every now and then.

19:10.200 --> 19:14.620
Yeah, I think what you see here with Mozilla is a real comprehensive, elegant approach

19:14.620 --> 19:16.840
to this that is evolving over time.

19:16.840 --> 19:24.140
You've seen Apple take some real sort of swath cuts at some low-hanging fruit and just taking

19:24.140 --> 19:28.680
some hard lines, which is good and sets a bar.

19:28.680 --> 19:32.360
But I like Mozilla's approach of just iteratively, over time, finding every little knob they

19:32.360 --> 19:33.360
can turn.

19:33.360 --> 19:36.360
Yeah, it seems like Mozilla have been doing a lot of good stuff lately, so let's hope

19:36.360 --> 19:37.360
they keep it up.

19:37.360 --> 19:38.360
Yeah.

19:38.360 --> 19:39.360
It feels like they're back on track these days.

19:39.360 --> 19:43.880
Well, Red Hat is certainly on track with OpenShift, and they just continue to double down on that.

19:43.880 --> 19:50.360
This week, they're releasing their code-ready containers, which, think of them as a minimal,

19:50.360 --> 19:56.920
ready-to-go OpenShift 4.1 or potentially newer environment that you can use to develop software

19:56.920 --> 20:01.280
on your local system and then deploy for the cloud.

20:01.280 --> 20:05.520
There are some somewhat hefty minimum requirements, to give you an idea of what you're working

20:05.520 --> 20:06.520
with here.

20:06.520 --> 20:11.680
You'll need four virtual CPUs, eight gigabytes of RAM, and 35 gigabytes of storage.

20:11.680 --> 20:17.560
But when you have allocated all of that, you've got an OpenShift cluster that's ready to go

20:17.560 --> 20:23.120
for local development in an environment that matches your production OpenShift environment.

20:23.120 --> 20:24.520
And this isn't just for Linux.

20:24.520 --> 20:28.520
It's using the native hypervisors on macOS and Windows as well.

20:28.520 --> 20:29.880
Yeah, that's kind of clever.

20:29.880 --> 20:34.520
That's kind of the clever part of this, is it really lets anyone that has an existing

20:34.520 --> 20:40.560
investment in any particular desktop system still develop for new systems they're deploying

20:40.560 --> 20:41.560
in the cloud.

20:41.560 --> 20:48.280
And OpenShift is, I think, one of those key pieces of that whole IBM hybrid cloud pitch,

20:48.280 --> 20:51.900
is OpenShift, because it's kind of the key piece of software orchestration that lets

20:51.900 --> 20:54.160
you put it all together and manage it.

20:54.160 --> 20:57.280
And so this is kind of a brilliant move.

20:57.280 --> 21:03.320
New investment in server infrastructure, deploy Red Hat and OpenShift, and then on

21:03.320 --> 21:09.160
your existing Windows and Mac investments, deploy the development environment for free.

21:09.160 --> 21:10.600
I mean, it's clever.

21:10.600 --> 21:13.440
You could see how corporate America could use the heck out of this.

21:13.440 --> 21:14.640
Oh, definitely.

21:14.640 --> 21:21.080
And it goes to show that potentially, OpenShift is the new RHEL.

21:21.080 --> 21:26.080
Maybe not yet, but down the line, it's where they will potentially be making most of their

21:26.080 --> 21:27.080
money.

21:27.080 --> 21:29.080
Yeah, well, RHEL will be just the...

21:29.080 --> 21:30.080
Well, it is.

21:30.080 --> 21:33.360
It's the implementation detail now, because it could also be core OS.

21:33.360 --> 21:38.600
I mean, it's fascinating to consider something that we obsess about so much, Linux, to just

21:38.600 --> 21:42.300
be a simple implementation detail here, but that's truly what it means.

21:42.300 --> 21:49.360
And I think the other way to look at this is, this is Red Hat's version of WSL2.

21:49.360 --> 21:54.400
Or one of the fundamental value propositions of Ubuntu in the corporate environment is

21:54.400 --> 22:00.680
you can have developers on a desktop OS that matches your Ubuntu systems in the cloud.

22:00.680 --> 22:04.700
That's one of the things that's really made Ubuntu successful on the desktop.

22:04.700 --> 22:06.840
And it's the reason why WSL2 exists.

22:06.840 --> 22:11.200
It's the reason why Linux applications and Linux environments are coming to Chromebooks.

22:11.200 --> 22:17.620
It's that develop in your production environment on your desktop mentality.

22:17.620 --> 22:21.360
That workflow seems to just be a killer workflow for developers.

22:21.360 --> 22:24.080
And everybody wants to have their implementation of it.

22:24.080 --> 22:29.400
Yeah, there's a reason why Red Hat did so well and got bought for so much money, eh?

22:29.400 --> 22:31.320
That hybrid cloud future.

22:31.320 --> 22:32.400
It's future money, Joe.

22:32.400 --> 22:33.400
It's in the cloud.

22:33.400 --> 22:34.800
We just haven't gotten there yet.

22:34.800 --> 22:40.880
I think, though, it's a good indicator that there's always going to be a reason to invest

22:40.880 --> 22:44.280
in some level of Linux desktop technologies.

22:44.280 --> 22:48.520
Different implementations utilize the desktop stack in different ways.

22:48.520 --> 22:53.280
This OpenShift one is more about just enabling development on other platforms.

22:53.280 --> 22:59.620
And there are some that push the desktop forward and make it part of that corporate strategy.

22:59.620 --> 23:05.080
So in other words, desktop Linux success is often linked to the success on the server

23:05.080 --> 23:06.620
system.

23:06.620 --> 23:08.200
It's a beneficial cycle.

23:08.200 --> 23:11.920
Well, if it's not the proper Linux desktop, it'll probably end up being Chrome OS.

23:11.920 --> 23:12.920
That's true.

23:12.920 --> 23:13.920
I have a theory about that.

23:13.920 --> 23:17.160
We've been doing a deep dive on Chrome OS in the last week to talk about it on Linux

23:17.160 --> 23:18.160
Unplugged this week.

23:18.160 --> 23:24.000
But not an immediately obvious thing, but Chrome OS very well may be the successful

23:24.000 --> 23:28.080
Linux desktop future, much like Android brought Linux to the masses.

23:28.080 --> 23:29.080
We'll see.

23:29.080 --> 23:31.200
We have a little deep dive in this week's Linux Unplugged coming up.

23:31.200 --> 23:34.600
I look forward to listening to it two or three times.

23:34.600 --> 23:36.360
As the editor, you will.

23:36.360 --> 23:38.840
In the meantime, go get this show every single week.
