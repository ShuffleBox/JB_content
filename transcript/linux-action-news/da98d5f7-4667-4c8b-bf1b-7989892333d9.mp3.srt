00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,760
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, episode 127, recorded on October 13, 2019. I'm Chris.

2
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:10,760
And I'm Joe.

3
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:15,720
Hello, Joe. Good to be connected with you. Richard Stallman is the top of the news again

4
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:16,720
this week.

5
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:22,540
Yeah, last time we talked about him and his resigning from the FSF and MIT, we weren't

6
00:00:22,540 --> 00:00:26,860
sure what was going to happen with GNU, and things were a little bit uncertain with his

7
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:31,960
website and everything. Well, then subsequently, it has turned out that he has not resigned

8
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:38,080
from GNU. He's very much still the chief GNU-sense, as he puts it. And since that clarification,

9
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:40,400
there's been a bit of controversy about that.

10
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:46,280
This became news this week, primarily because the FSF released a statement, and we'll have

11
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:50,820
the full statement linked in the show notes. But in part, it reads, GNU decision making

12
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:56,840
has largely been in the hands of GNU leadership. Since RMS resigned as president of the FSF,

13
00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:05,360
but not as head of GNU, the FSF is now working with GNU leadership on a shared understanding

14
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:11,760
of the relationship for the future. Now, that was published on October 6 of 2019. On October

15
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:18,680
7 of 2019, a joint statement of the GNU project was released on the Geeks blog.

16
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:24,800
Yeah, and this has been signed by a seemingly ever-growing list of GNU developers. And it

17
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:29,320
basically says, thanks for all you've done, Stallman, but we don't want you to be in charge

18
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:30,320
anymore.

19
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:35,960
As we record this episode, that is 27 GNU maintainers have signed this letter. To put

20
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:42,520
that in perspective, there's somewhere between 300 and 400 GNU maintainers overall. So you

21
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:48,040
have just an idea here of what the actual ratio is. The next day, on the InfoGNU mailing

22
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:53,360
list, which we talked about recently, Richard Stallman himself made a very quick post. He

23
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:57,640
says, as the chief GNU-sense, I'd like to reassure the community that there won't be

24
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:03,680
any radical changes in the GNU project's goals, principles, and policies. I would like to

25
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:10,220
make incremental changes in some decisions because I won't be here forever. And we need

26
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:15,640
to ready others to make GNU project decisions when I can no longer do so.

27
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:21,100
So my personal read of that, Joe, is that Richard Stallman saying, I'm not going anywhere.

28
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:25,920
I'm not even challenged about going anywhere. But we will make some slight modifications

29
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,200
to reduce bus factor.

30
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:31,600
That is one way to look at it. Another way to look at it is he's pretty much paying lip

31
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:37,840
service to the idea that he won't be in charge. It feels very much like he feels that it's

32
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:42,280
his baby, his project, and he's in charge of it.

33
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:47,800
Well, he's right. It is. My understanding is GNU is not even a legal entity. It's not

34
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:54,420
a charity. You can't give money to the GNU project. And besides the manifesto, GNU has

35
00:02:54,420 --> 00:03:00,120
no bylaws. It has no constitution. It has no founding document. You could describe GNU

36
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:06,840
as a set of software packages that have been designated by RMS, really, as a forming part

37
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:14,400
of GNU. It's as much of a group of maintainers and a philosophy as it is an organization.

38
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:19,200
It's really, it's not something you can take from the man. You know what I mean? It's not

39
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:22,800
something you can take from him. It's his. GNU is Richard Stallman.

40
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:26,680
I suppose it's a loose collective of people who generally agree with his ideals.

41
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:30,640
Right. I suppose that that loose collective could say, well, we'll follow somebody else's

42
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:37,440
leadership going forward. But consider those that have stuck around this long have likely

43
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:43,160
come to peace with who Richard Stallman is, except for that 30 or so that we've seen so

44
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:44,160
far.

45
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:49,600
So if it is such a small ratio of them, then the chances are that nothing's going to change

46
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:54,960
here and it's just going to be business as usual. And the FSF is in a very awkward position

47
00:03:54,960 --> 00:04:00,280
where they have to decide what to do. I can't see a simple solution for them.

48
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:05,400
I suppose some of these projects could spin off on their own. However, some of them are

49
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:13,760
fairly significant. There's some maintainers of GCC, GNU GPG, Emacs, and a few other

50
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:20,200
essential things that we rely upon like DNS utilities that are on this list. So if they

51
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:26,560
chose to split off, it would be a pretty significant loss for GNU. So they do need to resolve this.

52
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:30,640
And I think that's why they're doing these joint statements and they're attempting to

53
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:35,960
really sort of parse this as carefully as they can. But there is pressure from a influential

54
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:40,360
group of people saying there needs to be change here. But at the end of the day, there's no

55
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:48,240
board to kick RMS off. There's no legal entity to go after. So it's a particular challenge.

56
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:52,600
I suppose they could start the Nuganoo. Neo-Ganoo? I don't know.

57
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,600
Nuganoo or something, yeah.

58
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:55,600
Yeah.

59
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:59,160
Well, I get the feeling that this is going to rumble on for quite a while. I don't think

60
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:01,840
we're going to have a conclusion to it anytime soon.

61
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:06,360
They just need a good message, Joe. At least that's according to SUSE. You just say you're

62
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:11,720
focused on customers and then pretty much anything flies. Headline from the SUSE blog,

63
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:17,120
quote, SUSE is focusing on application delivery to meet customer needs. In other words, they're

64
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,800
dropping OpenStack and getting all in on Kubernetes.

65
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:24,040
Well, as they say in this blog post, this decision clearly aligns with the developments

66
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:27,800
in the market. And that's the feeling that I've had for quite some time. I mean, all

67
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:33,800
of us have, right? That OpenStack is yesterday's news and now it's all about Kubernetes.

68
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:41,280
I guess so, yeah. It's a big deal to see SUSE make this change though. I laugh at spinning

69
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:46,460
this as customer focused because what about all the OpenStack customers that they've been

70
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:49,560
selling to for a while? Not so great for those customers.

71
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:53,240
Well, they do say they're going to keep supporting them throughout the length of their contract.

72
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:58,480
Yeah, that's all good and well. They've invested pretty significantly into an infrastructure

73
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:03,120
that, oh, by the way, we're no longer supporting because customers. But it does seem to be

74
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:09,040
the way of the future. And I can really appreciate how the SUSE folks feel that they have a unique

75
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:13,920
opportunity where they're not aligned with any one particular vendor. They're sort of

76
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:18,800
the perfect neutral solution for this part in the stack. And when the distribution becomes

77
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:24,680
merely an implementation detail and you're not really too set on what the base image

78
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:30,120
is, barring many factors, then perhaps SUSE has a shot.

79
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:34,720
I mean, I'm kind of reaching here, Joe, because to be honest, this would have been a hell

80
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,680
of an announcement three years ago.

81
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:40,800
Well, to get ahead of the game rather than follow it like they seemingly are now.

82
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:45,600
Right. There is a quote in their blog that really cements this. They say, quote, as we

83
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:51,680
make these bold customer driven investments and in order to maximize these opportunities,

84
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:57,420
SUSE has carefully reviewed its business and has decided to cease production of new versions

85
00:06:57,420 --> 00:07:03,920
of SUSE OpenStack Cloud and to discontinue sales of SUSE OpenStack Cloud. It's a reaction.

86
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:07,720
Well, they must have been looking at the numbers in the spreadsheets and realized that they're

87
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:12,800
just not selling enough of it and therefore it doesn't make sense to keep doing it.

88
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:16,760
Absolutely fair enough. Fair enough. But a real market leader and somebody who's going

89
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:22,120
to pull ahead of the pack and really differentiate would have been onto that signal a while ago.

90
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:27,400
That's my personal take. Just witnessing how Canonical and Red Hat have changed their business

91
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:33,600
models to respond to the reality we live in, it's a little disappointing to see SUSE literally

92
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:37,960
the last one to make this connection. And I think there could have been a way to bridge

93
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:41,840
this gap a little more elegantly than they are doing now instead of this hard shift and

94
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:47,360
now it's in support mode. But the details will definitely be what makes the difference

95
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,800
in this particular story.

96
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:52,960
Well, the details are what a lot of people were worried about with Google's AMP, formerly

97
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:55,120
accelerated mobile pages.

98
00:07:55,120 --> 00:08:00,920
When they made that big, huge shift in governance model, one of the details they hinted at was

99
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:06,080
that they may move AMP under a totally separate foundation than from under Google. Now we

100
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:11,280
know that's the OpenJS Foundation. And we should probably mention upfront that AMP is

101
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:16,740
joining the incubation program for the OpenJS Foundation. And to understand what that is,

102
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:22,960
they write on their website, quote, over the coming months, AMP will work with the OpenJS

103
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:27,540
Foundation to complete the onboarding checklist and then join the foundation.

104
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:32,480
So there's this sort of incubator stage that they can get some of the benefits of being

105
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:37,380
part of the foundation right now, some of the governance benefits, then they have time

106
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:43,220
to complete the rest of the onboarding process. And Google will continue to employ staff to

107
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:50,400
work on the AMP project full time. And also worth noting, Google is already a platinum

108
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:57,800
member of the OpenJS Foundation and provides additional financial and other forms of support

109
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:03,080
to the foundation already. So they're going to be great. I think that onboarding process

110
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:04,480
is going to go real smooth.

111
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:10,480
Yeah. And essentially, not much is really going to change, at least for now. But what's

112
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:15,720
interesting is that they've chosen now, when AMP is about four years old, to transfer it

113
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:22,420
out of Google's control completely, it seems like they waited long enough for it to properly

114
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:28,440
establish itself as the standard. And they've kind of won at this point. And so they don't

115
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:32,700
really need to be in full control of it anymore.

116
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:40,460
I see it differently. I see it as the new version of a code dump. Only now there's foundations

117
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:45,920
in the mix. So you build something up, you quote unquote open source it, but yet you

118
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:51,460
maintain total control over it. You push it down the pipeline of existing value products

119
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:56,940
that you already have and mandate adoption. And then you move it to a foundation which

120
00:09:56,940 --> 00:10:04,040
you are one of the primary financial and other quote unquote contributors to. And then you

121
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:10,240
have heavy influence because A, you're supporting the foundation, and B, you're employing the

122
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:12,940
full time developers of AMP.

123
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:19,960
So it's sort of, I think, modern day. Let's be futuristic. Let's say it's the 2020 version

124
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:23,920
of a code dump where you used to develop something and then just say, here it is. Here's a whole

125
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:28,520
big bunch of code. Go use it, everybody. It's great. It works great. Now it's this. You

126
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:33,080
build something up internally. You call it open source. You get adoption. And then you

127
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:41,560
have, I'm going to say it, a puppet foundation. And you're set. You're all set. And I suppose

128
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:46,700
it's still better than fully closed commercial software because at least it's a foundation

129
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:54,180
and at least there's some oversight. And we have overview of open source code. So it's

130
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:56,260
better than the alternative still.

131
00:10:56,260 --> 00:11:01,060
But it's not a proper open standard, really. They can dress it up as such, but you're saying

132
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:02,540
that it just isn't.

133
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:09,380
Not today, I suppose. Like so many of these things, five, 10 years from now, time will

134
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:15,580
tell. We'll see. We will see how much influence Google leverages over the OpenJS Foundation.

135
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:20,300
Perhaps it's a non-issue, but only time will tell us. I mean, they could proclaim from

136
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:25,340
the tops of the hills that they are under no influence, but only truly their actions

137
00:11:25,340 --> 00:11:26,500
will tell us the real story.

138
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:32,060
I can't help but think back to Kubernetes and how they did a fairly similar thing with

139
00:11:32,060 --> 00:11:33,060
that.

140
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:39,300
Fair enough, I suppose. And in that instance, they were really coming from an underdog standpoint.

141
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:44,820
The Google Cloud was the smaller of the available commercial cloud options. And so coming out

142
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:50,740
with something that was cross cloud was perfect for them. In this situation, I think they've

143
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:55,340
been met with a lot of resistance because they're so dominant in web search and in the

144
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:59,060
web browser. So the stakes are just so much higher this time around.

145
00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:05,060
Well, Google's next big thing is Stadia, their cloud gaming platform. And they made a pretty

146
00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:06,860
audacious claim this week.

147
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:12,380
Right. This is based on comments from a top streaming engineer, Alex Wiltshire from Google.

148
00:12:12,380 --> 00:12:18,460
He says the company is verging on gaming superiority from anything a PC could do in the next two

149
00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:23,300
years. Quote, ultimately, we think in a year or two we'll have games that are running faster

150
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:30,300
and feel more responsive in the cloud than they do locally, regardless of how powerful

151
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:32,020
the local machine is.

152
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:38,000
So he's claiming that not only is Stadia going to be on a par with a local Xbox or whatever,

153
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:42,380
it's going to actually be better. How is that even possible?

154
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:48,900
Well, it's all thanks to something called negative latency, which will act as a workaround

155
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:53,340
for any potential lag between the player and the server. This is according to him. And

156
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:59,020
of course, it really comes down to a data angle. I mean, this is Google. The term describes

157
00:12:59,020 --> 00:13:04,860
a buffer of predicted latency, which is inherent to Stadia players and their connection. It'll

158
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:10,540
figure that out as you play. So then after the Stadia system figures out your particulars,

159
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:16,260
it will begin what's called lag mitigation. This will include increasing the frame rates

160
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:20,340
rapidly in a bursty mode when needed and then lowering them in other situations to reduce

161
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:27,420
latency that the player perceives unbelievably, but yet so googly at the same time. It will

162
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:34,860
even try to predict user inputs and in certain situations play for you when there's latency

163
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:35,860
disruption.

164
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:38,980
So you're telling me that it's going to speculate what buttons you're going to press and then

165
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:41,420
execute them ahead of time, right?

166
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:45,820
It's going to learn how you play. It's going to learn the particulars of your connection

167
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:51,640
and its issues. And then it's going to step in for you when the connection can't keep

168
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:56,340
up in a way that you don't really perceive anything has happened.

169
00:13:56,340 --> 00:13:59,660
So speculative execution, what could go wrong?

170
00:13:59,660 --> 00:14:05,100
Also, you have to ask yourself, who's actually playing the game at that point? I guess you're

171
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:08,420
still having a good time because your game's not getting screwed up.

172
00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:13,880
Yeah, people are comparing it to aim assist and stuff like that. It just seems a bit too

173
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:19,500
futuristic and quite frankly impossible, really. I can imagine on a basic 2D game or something,

174
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:25,580
you could do this quite easily. But on these really complex first person shooters and stuff,

175
00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:31,220
how is that even possible to anticipate what moves you're going to make? It just seems

176
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:34,420
like an impossible dream to me.

177
00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:38,380
Unless you consider that they could have tens of thousands of other people playing that

178
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:43,620
same game, and they're capturing and monitoring everything you do in that game, and then using

179
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:48,780
that as a model to predict what you might need to do at the same exact moment. If they

180
00:14:48,780 --> 00:14:56,220
have the decision of say, 15,000 other players in that same exact moment of the game, and

181
00:14:56,220 --> 00:15:03,180
75% of them pushed X and looked up, they can probably pretty accurately predict that that's

182
00:15:03,180 --> 00:15:07,980
what you would do, and just do that move and stitch it all together.

183
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:12,700
This is why I became a Stadia backer, because I think in a really kind of scary, creepy

184
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:18,180
way, Google is the company that can figure this out. Between the network connectivity

185
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:24,420
that they have, the hardware access that they have, and then this kind of stuff, I can actually

186
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:29,580
see them pulling it off. We'll see. I have a lot of varying internet connections in which

187
00:15:29,580 --> 00:15:34,680
I can try this. I don't know how likely it is to work, but this is why I became whatever

188
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:39,020
they call their backer, where you get the whole kit. I'm fascinated to see what they

189
00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:41,700
can pull off, and what it means for desktop Linux.

190
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:47,140
Well, you have to assume that they won't open source any of the machine learning stuff that's

191
00:15:47,140 --> 00:15:52,380
required to do that, but it is all going to be running on a Linux backend, so we hopefully

192
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:54,660
will get some of the benefits from it.

193
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:58,420
Maybe I actually could see Google years down the road open sourcing it. They've kind of

194
00:15:58,420 --> 00:16:03,100
done that over time. They've implemented something, they've put it in production, they've gotten

195
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:08,660
some benefit from it, they've trialed it or dog fooded it, and then released it. They

196
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:12,260
just recently did that with a pretty sophisticated differential privacy library.

197
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:17,060
Yeah, well, here's hoping, but speaking of things that you've spent or wasted your money

198
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:22,740
on to see how it turns out, the Atari VCS is back in the news this week.

199
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:29,260
Oh, it's too soon, Joe, too soon. I'm not quite as positive on the Atari VCS. Quick

200
00:16:29,260 --> 00:16:36,420
recap, Atari VCS is a retro-looking little Linux box that's going to have a custom Atari

201
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:41,420
UI with an app store and some retro games, some modern games, and the promise to run

202
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:49,140
your own OS. However, that promise looks a little more shaky as one of their key design

203
00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:54,380
contributors or a firm spilled the beans this week that things haven't been going so well.

204
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:58,140
Yeah, they claim that they haven't been paid for six months and they've had enough and

205
00:16:58,140 --> 00:16:59,620
have quit the project.

206
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:08,900
And that's after delay, after delay, after delay. But Atari does dispute this in sort

207
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:13,160
of an indirect manner. They went to their blog and said, well, things are a little out

208
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:16,660
of date with their information. We haven't worked with them for a while because we haven't

209
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:21,180
paid them. And things are going really great. Everything's right on track. Don't worry about

210
00:17:21,180 --> 00:17:26,300
it at all. And by the way, the register, some of that is our IP, and we may ask you to take

211
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:29,060
it down at any point. We reserve that right. Okay, thanks.

212
00:17:29,060 --> 00:17:33,660
Yeah, that register piece was a real deep dive and they spent two weeks investigating

213
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:39,940
it and it looked pretty damning for the project. But then this Atari blog post kind of answers

214
00:17:39,940 --> 00:17:46,780
some of those questions, but then also kind of admits that it's nowhere near ready.

215
00:17:46,780 --> 00:17:53,340
Yeah, just about ready for production, though. That's the quote in the blog post. Just about,

216
00:17:53,340 --> 00:18:00,100
just real close. Yeah, this is rough because Atari as a company has the launch of this

217
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:06,620
console listed as one of three major goals for the entire company.

218
00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:11,500
You talk about Atari like it's the same company as the 70s and 80s. But the reality is that

219
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:16,620
it's just really the name and the trademarks that were just sort of sold. And now this

220
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:21,820
company's got it. And yeah, they can call themselves Atari, but it's not the same company

221
00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:25,700
really. Yep. Perhaps that's why we are where we're

222
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:28,060
at. Well, I couldn't help but bring this up just

223
00:18:28,060 --> 00:18:32,180
to troll you because I know that you are waiting for it. And I think you're going to be waiting

224
00:18:32,180 --> 00:18:37,140
for a very long time or you're going to get something that is a very nice looking little

225
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:42,060
Linux box, which isn't massively expensive, but isn't going to do a huge amount.

226
00:18:42,060 --> 00:18:45,720
Yeah, unfortunately, like most of these things, it's going to not be very current either by

227
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:51,580
the time it actually ships. But my end goal is that one day you can show up for a Linux

228
00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:56,420
fest and it'll be in the studio living room and ready to play.

229
00:18:56,420 --> 00:18:59,460
I think we'll still be using your Nvidia Shield for a while.

230
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:03,060
Yeah, because then I'll be streaming games from Stadia on it. Of course.

231
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:07,820
Yeah, and you'll be buying them with Open Libra, no doubt.

232
00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:12,140
Obviously, because this is a loose collective of individuals. Who else do I want backing

233
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:18,060
my currency, Joe? Yeah, another loose collective of individuals.

234
00:19:18,060 --> 00:19:23,140
So this is essentially a fork of Facebook's Libra, which early in the week gained a lot

235
00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:28,140
of attention because it had a lot of claims. But then it turns out that a lot of the people

236
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:33,300
who were supposed to be involved with it aren't really involved with it. And it's not really

237
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:34,900
much more than a website.

238
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:40,980
Oh, man, nothing else is more embarrassing than people pulling out at a rapid pace. And

239
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:48,540
some of them with quotes like, I just showed up for a meeting. I was just present. I didn't

240
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:54,580
mean to be on a slide that was given to a presentation. They have some great goals.

241
00:19:54,580 --> 00:19:58,820
They like the idea of the Libra currency, but they don't like the idea of it being tied

242
00:19:58,820 --> 00:20:07,080
with Facebook. All right, pretty understandable. I think the core issue that they miss is one

243
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:11,860
that many of us, myself, all of us that are Linux geeks, make this mistake every now and

244
00:20:11,860 --> 00:20:18,100
then. And that is, sometimes we think something can be a success in the market based on its

245
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:23,180
technical merits. And we forget that there's so many other factors at play in the market.

246
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:30,580
So many other dynamics, as they like to say. And sometimes the worst product wins. I could

247
00:20:30,580 --> 00:20:34,260
make the cliche comparison of Betamax and VHS, but I think everybody gets what I'm talking

248
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:40,180
about. Sometimes the worser tech wins out simply because it's some sort of market dynamic

249
00:20:40,180 --> 00:20:45,580
that makes it more available to consumers. And what they're attempting to solve here

250
00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:52,140
with a open Libra association, it's a great idea. From a technical standpoint, I totally

251
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:58,740
follow it. But what Facebook is offering is corporate sponsorship, corporate backing,

252
00:20:58,740 --> 00:21:06,900
worldwide, new world corporate backing, nationless backing of a currency. And the whole central

253
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:12,260
control and a business being behind it is what people will be drawn to. I'm not saying

254
00:21:12,260 --> 00:21:16,900
that's what appeals to me, but that's what makes Libra look interesting in comparison

255
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:22,940
to things like Monero or Bitcoin or Ethereum. And so something like this that comes along,

256
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:26,260
it's such a narrow view on the entire problem.

257
00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:30,500
Well, yeah. And apart from anything else, it's pretty much academic because Libra is

258
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:35,380
going nowhere now that all of the payment providers have pulled out of it.

259
00:21:35,380 --> 00:21:41,260
Well, this is brutal. This is super brutal. Every US payment processor from PayPal to

260
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:45,900
Stripe has pulled out of Facebook's Libra currency. That is devastating.

261
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:51,500
Well, there's two reasons why this happens so quickly. One is pressure from regulators.

262
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:56,300
And the other is that the first ever Libra council meeting is happening in Geneva on

263
00:21:56,300 --> 00:22:01,620
Monday the 14th, so the Monday that you're probably listening to this. And at that council

264
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:06,500
meeting, that's where some firm commitments were going to have to be made. So it was kind

265
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:12,980
of crunch time. It was either go all in or, as most of these payment processors have,

266
00:22:12,980 --> 00:22:13,980
just quit.

267
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:18,860
Right. And it's pretty understandable for a payment processor in the US. There are very

268
00:22:18,860 --> 00:22:25,140
particular regulations that they are under, and the SEC loves to go after you if you violate

269
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:30,260
those regulations. So it's pretty understandable why they would get sort of cold feet at this

270
00:22:30,260 --> 00:22:35,180
stage. Nothing says some of them couldn't go back in. If you look at that initial list,

271
00:22:35,180 --> 00:22:40,960
they were some of the heavy hitters. PayPal, Stripe, Visa, those are going to make a big

272
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:43,300
difference in the potency of this currency.

273
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:47,180
Yeah, Visa, MasterCard, and PayPal. Between the three of them, you can pretty much pay

274
00:22:47,180 --> 00:22:52,060
for anything anywhere in the world. And so it's going to be huge for Libra and therefore

275
00:22:52,060 --> 00:22:57,660
Facebook, whereas now the only organizations left are really sort of cryptocurrency people.

276
00:22:57,660 --> 00:23:04,620
Yeah. Well, and Spotify and Vodafone, they're in there too. But you're right, it really

277
00:23:04,620 --> 00:23:09,400
changes everything about this. And going back to Open Libra, there is one thing they touch

278
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:14,660
on in their post on OpenLibra.io, which we have linked, that really kind of clicked with

279
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:20,020
me. Quote, despite pushback from nation states, we believe that Facebook is likely to succeed

280
00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:25,140
in their goal. Governments will be focused on their own outcomes, and in reality have

281
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:30,560
little legislative power to leverage against a transnational force such as Facebook Libra.

282
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:36,180
For that reason, we are creating Open Libra. I don't think it has a snowball's chance,

283
00:23:36,180 --> 00:23:40,580
Joe. But you know, that part did kind of click with me. It does. It does seem like it's possible.

284
00:23:40,580 --> 00:23:45,940
Yeah, you never know. I was also very amused to hear that Facebook are being sued over

285
00:23:45,940 --> 00:23:52,540
the logo for Calibra, which is their wallet software. So not only did they pretty much

286
00:23:52,540 --> 00:23:58,900
steal the name from the ebook software, they also have got a logo that looks remarkably

287
00:23:58,900 --> 00:24:05,100
like the logo for Current, which is kind of one of these modern online bank things. But

288
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:11,340
the twist in that story is it's the same design company who made both logos.

289
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:16,420
That is good. My favorite cryptocurrency story was the bad news for Telegram. Remember we

290
00:24:16,420 --> 00:24:21,700
talked about Telegram's currency they were raising, and that if they hadn't reached their

291
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:26,540
goal in time, they had to give the money back? Well, the SEC just poured cold water on that

292
00:24:26,540 --> 00:24:33,340
particular story. They said it's not happening in the US, and they have blocked their $1.7

293
00:24:33,340 --> 00:24:39,280
billion plan token sale. And this quote is pretty, pretty telling. It says, our emergency

294
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:45,420
action today is intended to prevent Telegram from flooding the US market with digital tokens

295
00:24:45,420 --> 00:24:53,660
that we allege were unlawfully sold. That doesn't sound good for Telegram at all. I

296
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:56,820
guess they're not going to become that big fancy crypto wallet after all.

297
00:24:56,820 --> 00:25:00,740
Well, no, it looks like they are going to have to pay back all the people who invested

298
00:25:00,740 --> 00:25:03,940
in it, which is going to be tricky for them.

299
00:25:03,940 --> 00:25:08,940
I don't know. I mean, God, it'd just be a shame if they just focused on messaging features.

300
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:14,100
Wouldn't that be? What about presence awareness and D&D features? Oh, man, wouldn't that be

301
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:18,820
a shame? That'd just be horrible. Man, if they want to make a buck, I'd pay for those

302
00:25:18,820 --> 00:25:23,220
features, tell you what. I just sort of feel like since they shifted gears and they started

303
00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:28,900
focusing on their cryptocurrency and their wallet and their identity stuff, the overall

304
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:34,180
messaging features until just very recently have sort of suffered, especially in group

305
00:25:34,180 --> 00:25:40,720
chats where you have maybe close to 1,000, over 1,000 members, 1,000 plus. They've really

306
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:46,300
failed to deliver on features that compete with things like Discord or even things like

307
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:48,060
Slack and Rocket Chat.

308
00:25:48,060 --> 00:25:53,700
This cryptocurrency distraction reminds me of the mobile distraction that so many Linux

309
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:54,940
companies get afflicted with.

310
00:25:54,940 --> 00:25:59,420
Well, yeah, and it was flavor of the month, wasn't it? When Bitcoin was at nearly $20,000

311
00:25:59,420 --> 00:26:05,100
and you have to assume that a lot of these cryptocurrency based plans were starting to

312
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:11,620
be formed around then, they've taken a little while to get going. And now the kind of shine

313
00:26:11,620 --> 00:26:16,660
has come off cryptocurrencies. Blockchain as a fundamental technology is still doing

314
00:26:16,660 --> 00:26:21,900
relatively well. But I think that you're right. Yeah, it does feel very much like the mobile

315
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:24,820
distraction that we had from the Linux companies.

316
00:26:24,820 --> 00:26:30,420
But in that time, the SEC and other U.S. government agencies have had time, like the IRS, have

317
00:26:30,420 --> 00:26:37,400
had time to learn about cryptocurrency and have a more aggressive approach now. It's

318
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:43,320
less of a Wild West than it was even a year ago. And while they developed this product,

319
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:47,740
the market has changed from right underneath them. And now they have a very aware government

320
00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:52,740
agency, which is ready to look into all of this. It really kind of, I don't know, if

321
00:26:52,740 --> 00:26:59,400
I was Telegram, I'd be worried. It's very possible that they could have to give that

322
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:00,400
money back.

323
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:04,900
