Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, our weekly take on Linux and the open source world.

00:16.280 --> 00:20.840
This is episode 49, recorded on April 15th, 2018.

00:20.840 --> 00:21.840
I'm Chris.

00:21.840 --> 00:22.840
And I'm Joe.

00:22.840 --> 00:23.840
Hello, Joe.

00:23.840 --> 00:27.320
It's good to be connected with you, and sorry if I sound a little sleepy today.

00:27.320 --> 00:29.720
I was up all night playing video games.

00:29.720 --> 00:35.400
No doubt taking advantage of this new tool made by Feral Interactive called Game Mode.

00:35.400 --> 00:36.400
What can I say, Joe?

00:36.400 --> 00:39.840
I'm committed to research for every episode of Linux Action News.

00:39.840 --> 00:43.800
Yeah, it's what Aiki calls validation, I think, when he's playing games.

00:43.800 --> 00:45.280
And he actually had something to do with this.

00:45.280 --> 00:47.700
So that's part of the reason I wanted to mention this.

00:47.700 --> 00:51.440
If you look at the GitHub, you'll see that quite a lot of the commits are from Aiki.

00:51.440 --> 00:52.440
Oh, cool.

00:52.440 --> 00:53.440
I did not actually catch that.

00:53.440 --> 00:54.840
I was too busy actually testing it.

00:54.840 --> 00:58.600
So let me tell you the basic premises and warn you that it is early days.

00:58.600 --> 01:02.800
But the idea is so cool that I could think of it as more than game mode.

01:02.800 --> 01:04.680
I could think of it as development mode.

01:04.680 --> 01:08.480
I could think of it as system admin mode.

01:08.480 --> 01:11.440
But in its current incarnation, it's open source.

01:11.440 --> 01:13.900
And it's from the folks at Feral Interactive.

01:13.900 --> 01:18.140
And they're releasing it ahead of Rise of Tomb Raiders Linux release.

01:18.140 --> 01:20.040
And it's basic right now.

01:20.040 --> 01:24.000
It's a multi-part tool that's really designed to just take care of some of the most basic

01:24.000 --> 01:27.100
performance modes you can get out of your CPU.

01:27.100 --> 01:31.760
It does handy things like it tells your CPU to automatically run the performance governor

01:31.760 --> 01:36.440
in a mode that is highest performance rather than something like balanced or power saving.

01:36.440 --> 01:39.280
And it gets kind of neat because it has a front end and a back end.

01:39.280 --> 01:43.440
And you can set it up to automatically make these adjustments when you launch the game.

01:43.440 --> 01:49.680
But they have a plugin architecture as well that could automatically enable other functionality

01:49.680 --> 01:51.240
down the road when you launch a game.

01:51.240 --> 01:53.520
And for that, the possibilities are endless.

01:53.520 --> 01:58.000
Yeah, now another reason I wanted to mention this is because last week we were kind of

01:58.000 --> 02:02.480
down, weren't we, on Valve with their Steam machines and how Linux gaming in general isn't

02:02.480 --> 02:04.600
that important to a lot of people.

02:04.600 --> 02:09.200
But this kind of shows that a big player like Feral Interactive are obviously thinking about

02:09.200 --> 02:10.200
Linux.

02:10.200 --> 02:13.860
I also like thinking about other ways I could put my machine into a high performance state

02:13.860 --> 02:16.500
by launching just one application.

02:16.500 --> 02:20.120
So with gaming, I could think of plugins I could add to game mode that would make it

02:20.120 --> 02:21.840
really useful.

02:21.840 --> 02:26.320
Because the governor's stuff, if you're gaming on a desktop PC, you may already just have

02:26.320 --> 02:28.480
this hard set to performance mode.

02:28.480 --> 02:30.800
Why wouldn't you if you're a gamer?

02:30.800 --> 02:36.500
If they could do things like maybe change the Linux IO scheduler or disable my compositor's

02:36.500 --> 02:40.320
full screen effects when a game is running automatically.

02:40.320 --> 02:42.640
You could see lots of different plugins.

02:42.640 --> 02:45.000
Maybe turn off certain services in the background.

02:45.000 --> 02:49.040
When I launch a game, turn off NFS, Samba, and my MB server.

02:49.040 --> 02:51.980
I don't want them taking up extra CPU while I'm gaming.

02:51.980 --> 02:55.860
And then as soon as the game closes, have SystemD automatically bring those services

02:55.860 --> 02:56.920
back up.

02:56.920 --> 03:01.280
Things like that are totally doable, and it's open source so the community can contribute

03:01.280 --> 03:02.280
back.

03:02.280 --> 03:05.680
Well, maybe this will turn out to be a big thing, we'll have to see.

03:05.680 --> 03:10.880
But something else we've been pretty down on in the past is ButterFS.

03:10.880 --> 03:15.300
And we've always kind of said, oh, well, ZFS, CFS, that's the way forward.

03:15.300 --> 03:17.800
You don't get any data loss or anything with that.

03:17.800 --> 03:23.680
Well, that's not strictly the case unless you are totally up to date.

03:23.680 --> 03:28.480
This is an interesting bug that cropped up just on ZFS on Linux did not affect the BSD

03:28.480 --> 03:29.480
variants.

03:29.480 --> 03:34.640
And it's because of a collision with a change in core utils upstream with a change in ZFS

03:34.640 --> 03:35.640
upstream.

03:35.640 --> 03:37.680
And neither one of them had anything to do with each other.

03:37.680 --> 03:38.680
It's kind of funny.

03:38.680 --> 03:43.640
The ZFS change was related to just handling case insensitive file systems better.

03:43.640 --> 03:49.560
And the core utils change was a change to how CP worked when hashing the files that

03:49.560 --> 03:51.080
it was copying.

03:51.080 --> 03:56.460
These two changes came together to prevent what's called the ZFS attributes file from

03:56.460 --> 03:58.040
expanding properly.

03:58.040 --> 04:02.760
And when that couldn't expand properly and keep track of all the changes, my understanding

04:02.760 --> 04:05.120
is files just essentially got dropped on the floor.

04:05.120 --> 04:10.600
They were still moved, they still exist, but they were never added to the index of the

04:10.600 --> 04:11.600
file system.

04:11.600 --> 04:17.040
Now, the upstream developers, as of this recording, have a tool that they're working on to add

04:17.040 --> 04:22.040
those files back to the index, so there will actually be no data loss in totality.

04:22.040 --> 04:26.720
But what you get is a collision of two different upstream changes that really came together

04:26.720 --> 04:32.120
and collided on the most recent distributions, the most current RHEL snapshots and its derivatives,

04:32.120 --> 04:34.680
your Gen 2s, your Arch Linuxes.

04:34.680 --> 04:40.520
The Debian derivatives and Ubuntu were not affected because they were on ZFS 0.76.

04:40.520 --> 04:46.140
So the moral of the story here is if you're on a recent or a rolling distribution of Linux,

04:46.140 --> 04:50.600
you need to be on ZFS 0.7.8.

04:50.600 --> 04:52.380
You probably didn't lose any data.

04:52.380 --> 04:54.800
You can look further into the story if you think you might have.

04:54.800 --> 04:56.580
We will have links in the show notes.

04:56.580 --> 05:01.800
You go to linuxactionnews.com slash 49, dig down in there, you will find the link to the

05:01.800 --> 05:06.280
thread where developers are talking about that tool that will pick those files up that

05:06.280 --> 05:08.900
got dropped and add them back into the index.

05:08.900 --> 05:15.360
This, I think, Joe, might be our first kind of big ZFS on Linux bug-ish, which turned

05:15.360 --> 05:19.160
out to kind of be not that major, but it's still noteworthy, I think.

05:19.160 --> 05:24.400
It's definitely noteworthy because of the criticism that ButterFS has had in the past.

05:24.400 --> 05:30.120
And I don't know, when you have a file system that is as complicated as ZFS, then surely

05:30.120 --> 05:35.480
you are sort of lining yourself up for these bugs and maybe there will be other bugs in

05:35.480 --> 05:36.480
the future.

05:36.480 --> 05:39.760
Nobody could have really seen this coming, whereas with a much simpler file system like

05:39.760 --> 05:47.120
ext4, which is what I use more or less everywhere, or even XFS, you're not going to have these

05:47.120 --> 05:48.120
problems, are you?

05:48.120 --> 05:49.120
Fair enough.

05:49.120 --> 05:55.480
And I think for a lot of deployments like desktops and laptops, ext4 and XFS are the

05:55.480 --> 05:57.560
file systems to choose.

05:57.560 --> 06:01.380
But the use case of the server, it's a totally different thing here.

06:01.380 --> 06:06.200
So the ButterFS bug that they really got the most criticism for was a flaw with their

06:06.200 --> 06:08.840
RAID 5, if I recall.

06:08.840 --> 06:15.940
That is a fundamental design flaw in the file system, where this bug was two upstream issues

06:15.940 --> 06:17.080
that collided.

06:17.080 --> 06:21.720
It was technically, if core utils hadn't made that change, this bug wouldn't have been invoked.

06:21.720 --> 06:26.700
And if ZFS hadn't made that upstream change to be more compatible with case-insensitive

06:26.700 --> 06:30.080
file systems, this bug wouldn't have been invoked.

06:30.080 --> 06:35.140
But it wasn't a design issue with how ZFS writes to the RAID array.

06:35.140 --> 06:39.160
It was simply two upstream projects collided on their changes.

06:39.160 --> 06:45.160
Yeah, well, call me a Luddite, but I'm sticking with ext4, even on servers for now.

06:45.160 --> 06:46.720
All right.

06:46.720 --> 06:49.880
You tell me how that works for you when you're dealing with hundreds of terabytes worth of

06:49.880 --> 06:50.880
data.

06:50.880 --> 06:51.880
Well, yeah, that is true.

06:51.880 --> 06:52.880
That is true.

06:52.880 --> 06:56.960
There are very strong arguments for using these more modern file systems.

06:56.960 --> 07:02.560
But for the kind of deployments that I need, I just can't justify the complication and

07:02.560 --> 07:03.560
risk basically.

07:03.560 --> 07:09.000
You know, I can't really disagree if your use case doesn't require snapshots and compression

07:09.000 --> 07:12.400
and deduplication and copy-on-write.

07:12.400 --> 07:17.200
If those things don't even seem like useful aspects of a file system to you, then you

07:17.200 --> 07:21.360
just need a good file system and a good backup, and you're pretty much set.

07:21.360 --> 07:23.280
Well, yeah, exactly.

07:23.280 --> 07:27.960
I'm not saying that I couldn't take advantage of them, but you have to weigh up these pros

07:27.960 --> 07:29.160
and cons, don't you?

07:29.160 --> 07:34.040
And I think the complication aspect of it, you know, ZFS is something that does so many

07:34.040 --> 07:39.080
things that you can potentially do with other tools.

07:39.080 --> 07:44.520
And okay, maybe it's ultimately more complicated to use those other tools, but it's solving

07:44.520 --> 07:49.420
problems that can be solved in other ways that I'm used to solving them in that way,

07:49.420 --> 07:50.420
if that makes any sense.

07:50.420 --> 07:53.800
It actually does make sense to me, because when I'm working on a laptop with multiple

07:53.800 --> 08:00.000
drives or an editing rig that I want to share storage, I find I'm actually still going to

08:00.000 --> 08:06.200
LVM, more so than, say, a ButterFS volume setup or a ZFS pool.

08:06.200 --> 08:12.860
I just know LVM, I know it works, and I just want XFS on my drives and LVM to just bring

08:12.860 --> 08:14.340
all the disks together.

08:14.340 --> 08:16.200
In some ways, I'm a lot like you in that respect.

08:16.200 --> 08:21.160
On my local workstations, if I was dealing with a large enterprise in a data center,

08:21.160 --> 08:23.640
hands down, no doubt about it, ZFS all day long.

08:23.640 --> 08:28.280
Yeah, I think ultimately, I would be as well, but thankfully, I don't have that much data

08:28.280 --> 08:29.280
to deal with.

08:29.280 --> 08:32.160
Thankfully, it's not your problem.

08:32.160 --> 08:33.400
Yep.

08:33.400 --> 08:38.640
But something that Mozilla is trying to make their problem is the state of the internet,

08:38.640 --> 08:40.760
which they think is not great.

08:40.760 --> 08:45.160
Really, Mozilla is capitalizing on a perfect moment in time.

08:45.160 --> 08:49.760
Mark Zuckerberg just wrapped up his dominance of the news and his testimony for two days

08:49.760 --> 08:54.640
before the Senate and Congress, and the Mozilla Foundation is releasing their report that

08:54.640 --> 09:02.280
highlights the dangers posed by companies like Facebook to the internet about the centralization

09:02.280 --> 09:07.560
and concentration of control of how people experience the online world, and they say

09:07.560 --> 09:12.000
it's now in the hands of companies like Facebook, Amazon, and Twitter.

09:12.000 --> 09:17.800
This is the Internet Health Report, which they did a prototype of back in January 2017,

09:17.800 --> 09:23.040
and now they've released, I suppose, what's going to be an annual version of it now.

09:23.040 --> 09:25.680
This is the Rtake part of the show here.

09:25.680 --> 09:32.160
I went into this really wanting to like this report, because they start out with calling

09:32.160 --> 09:39.760
out how tracking your personal preferences and targeting ads and sort of making an echo

09:39.760 --> 09:42.280
chamber effect of the internet are bad things.

09:42.280 --> 09:45.040
I am so on board with that concept.

09:45.040 --> 09:46.320
I was like, yep, all right.

09:46.320 --> 09:47.440
I'll grab my pitchfork.

09:47.440 --> 09:49.640
Let me get the kerosene.

09:49.640 --> 09:51.320
I'll get my matches.

09:51.320 --> 09:52.720
I'm ready to go, Mozilla.

09:52.720 --> 09:54.160
You've got my attention.

09:54.160 --> 09:58.840
That's the mindset I went into this report with, and I walked out thinking, what the

09:58.840 --> 10:00.720
hell are they spending their money on?

10:00.720 --> 10:07.720
So they spend a lot of time talking about, quote unquote, fake news, which is a politically

10:07.720 --> 10:11.800
charged term, which immediately kind of gets me upset, because I think of Mozilla as a

10:11.800 --> 10:16.800
technology company, and now they're wandering off into the rabbit hole that never ends of

10:16.800 --> 10:22.280
politics, which can be a continuous money sink for these foundations, and they come

10:22.280 --> 10:27.840
back with Facebook dominating the web is a bad thing, Facebook tracking you and violating

10:27.840 --> 10:34.160
your privacy is a bad thing, and centralization of the web is a bad thing.

10:34.160 --> 10:37.920
Those are their fundamental takeaways in this internet health report, which they say is

10:37.920 --> 10:39.480
not a metric driven report.

10:39.480 --> 10:42.440
No, no, friends, that wouldn't make any sense.

10:42.440 --> 10:48.440
Instead, it's something that is more of an evaluation of what's helping and what's hurting

10:48.440 --> 10:49.720
the internet.

10:49.720 --> 10:54.360
It should be called state the bleeding obvious report, really, because of course, Facebook

10:54.360 --> 10:59.680
is this hub for billions of people who, that's their first port of call.

10:59.680 --> 11:04.280
When they open a web browser, they go straight to Facebook, and then everything goes from

11:04.280 --> 11:11.080
there, but for them to start making political statements like these companies should be

11:11.080 --> 11:13.360
broken up and regulated.

11:13.360 --> 11:16.440
Is that really Mozilla's place to start talking about that stuff?

11:16.440 --> 11:18.080
I don't feel like it is really.

11:18.080 --> 11:20.700
Yeah, let's talk about that, Joe.

11:20.700 --> 11:26.100
So that was sort of the takeaway is that fake news is bad MK, and we should probably break

11:26.100 --> 11:28.000
up the monopolies MK.

11:28.000 --> 11:33.320
And again, part of me sits here and reads this and goes, God, they're so right.

11:33.320 --> 11:34.760
Thank God somebody's saying this.

11:34.760 --> 11:37.400
I'll give you a line that I completely understand.

11:37.400 --> 11:43.340
They say, the network control of major internet services is only part of the grip they hold

11:43.340 --> 11:44.460
on our lives.

11:44.460 --> 11:50.200
The sheer size and diverse holdings a few companies, including Google, Facebook, and

11:50.200 --> 11:57.480
Amazon have become intertwined with not only our daily lives, but with all aspects of the

11:57.480 --> 12:02.240
global economy, civic discourse, and democracy itself.

12:02.240 --> 12:04.200
They are too big.

12:04.200 --> 12:10.360
And part of me agrees, when I watched Mark Zuckerberg testify in what was almost half

12:10.360 --> 12:14.740
of the US Senate, something really struck me, Joe.

12:14.740 --> 12:19.600
With half the US Senate there, you probably had representatives that in total represented

12:19.600 --> 12:23.840
150, 170 million individuals.

12:23.840 --> 12:29.720
And you had Mark Zuckerberg, who represented about 2 billion individuals.

12:29.720 --> 12:37.080
In a lot of ways, Mark Zuckerberg has more influence over the population than those 44

12:37.080 --> 12:41.160
US senators did in different aspects of their lives.

12:41.160 --> 12:43.640
There's a real sense of power differential.

12:43.640 --> 12:49.520
Mark Zuckerberg was the most powerful person in the room of half of the US Senate.

12:49.520 --> 12:53.460
And there is an actuality to that statement that is hard to ignore.

12:53.460 --> 12:58.320
And so to say that Facebook has too much power or too much influence over the internet isn't

12:58.320 --> 13:00.000
an accurate statement.

13:00.000 --> 13:04.680
The real fundamental problem here is that Mozilla isn't bringing up anything new or

13:04.680 --> 13:06.440
isn't giving us anything actionable.

13:06.440 --> 13:09.920
Yeah, because it's a pipe dream, isn't it, to try and break up Facebook?

13:09.920 --> 13:12.160
I mean, that's just not going to happen.

13:12.160 --> 13:14.880
They're an American US company dream.

13:14.880 --> 13:20.460
You know, a kid that started a company in the dorm of his college now is employing tens

13:20.460 --> 13:25.880
of thousands of people, making billions of dollars in revenue with billions of users.

13:25.880 --> 13:28.540
It's a great American accomplishment.

13:28.540 --> 13:30.260
No way you'd want to break that up right now.

13:30.260 --> 13:31.460
You just need to regulate.

13:31.460 --> 13:34.200
And that's where they're going with Facebook, for better or for worse, they're going for

13:34.200 --> 13:35.200
regulation.

13:35.200 --> 13:37.420
And that's what we're going to watch for a little while, is we're going to watch these

13:37.420 --> 13:40.440
companies fall under different areas of regulation.

13:40.440 --> 13:44.640
You are probably thinking a lot of GDPR these days, Joe.

13:44.640 --> 13:46.600
Facebook and Google have got to respond to that.

13:46.600 --> 13:49.520
Even Jupiter Broadcasting has to respond to GDPR.

13:49.520 --> 13:52.280
So it's going to be a couple of years of this.

13:52.280 --> 13:55.440
But do we need Mozilla to point that out?

13:55.440 --> 13:57.120
It just feels like that's not their place.

13:57.120 --> 14:03.160
I keep saying it, but that's their place is to concentrate on the web, OK, and keeping

14:03.160 --> 14:04.600
that free and everything.

14:04.600 --> 14:09.800
But surely they should be doing that by making a really good browser, not making political

14:09.800 --> 14:10.800
statements.

14:10.800 --> 14:12.960
Undoubtedly, that's the geek response.

14:12.960 --> 14:16.800
You and I, in our quote unquote production meeting last night over Telegram, I made the

14:16.800 --> 14:21.800
comment, I would have loved if they took the dozen or so people that worked on this report

14:21.800 --> 14:25.320
and just hired one more Thunderbird developer.

14:25.320 --> 14:27.500
One more Firefox developer.

14:27.500 --> 14:30.360
Just give me one more person writing code.

14:30.360 --> 14:33.620
And that's just what I want to see from the Mozilla Foundation.

14:33.620 --> 14:37.200
But they have, if you recall their architecture, they have two different sides, right?

14:37.200 --> 14:44.160
They have this sort of more aspirational public foundation aspect of the Mozilla group.

14:44.160 --> 14:47.180
And then they have the development side of the shop.

14:47.180 --> 14:49.040
It really is a right and a left hand.

14:49.040 --> 14:52.680
Yeah, but even if they hadn't hired a developer with the money that they could have saved

14:52.680 --> 14:56.980
by not writing this report, maybe they could have spent that money on advocacy.

14:56.980 --> 15:01.440
They could have paid for someone to go around the world to conferences and sell Firefox

15:01.440 --> 15:02.440
to developers.

15:02.440 --> 15:04.220
I could devil's advocate that.

15:04.220 --> 15:05.400
I could devil's advocate that.

15:05.400 --> 15:07.400
I mean, that seems pretty clear to me.

15:07.400 --> 15:09.480
You have to have something for them to cite.

15:09.480 --> 15:11.940
You have to give them some source material.

15:11.940 --> 15:13.400
And one does not preclude the other.

15:13.400 --> 15:16.540
You can have a report like this and you can still have advocacy.

15:16.540 --> 15:23.080
And having a quote unquote foundational report is usually more credible than somebody's opinion.

15:23.080 --> 15:27.960
So there is a functional aspect to this that they could actually, boots on the ground could

15:27.960 --> 15:28.960
utilize.

15:28.960 --> 15:33.480
Like this could become their weapons of knowledge that they use to convince people's opinions.

15:33.480 --> 15:36.120
I suppose that might be their hope.

15:36.120 --> 15:38.080
I think your first argument is better though.

15:38.080 --> 15:39.600
Is this their job?

15:39.600 --> 15:42.020
And I go back and I'll ask you this question.

15:42.020 --> 15:46.920
If Mozilla doesn't do it, and I'm not saying I want it to be Mozilla, but if Mozilla doesn't

15:46.920 --> 15:49.700
do this, who the hell else is going to do this?

15:49.700 --> 15:51.400
Nobody else is bringing these points up.

15:51.400 --> 15:56.800
I mean, you and I are, and people that just follow this stuff are thinking about it.

15:56.800 --> 16:02.160
But there's no large established organization that is making these points in a way that

16:02.160 --> 16:06.300
is consumable by businesses and politicians.

16:06.300 --> 16:07.860
What about the EFF?

16:07.860 --> 16:11.400
This is their line of thinking and this is their kind of beat, but they can only do so

16:11.400 --> 16:16.880
much and they're not talking about this specific issue like Mozilla is in such a refined way.

16:16.880 --> 16:21.920
Because Mozilla is a position of authority on this topic and they have this bullshit

16:21.920 --> 16:23.440
report that sells.

16:23.440 --> 16:26.920
I mean, that's the thing about when you're talking to a business, you're talking to a

16:26.920 --> 16:30.720
politician, having these quote unquote reports that they've worked super hard on and put

16:30.720 --> 16:35.760
a lot of effort into, they're sales material that people eat up.

16:35.760 --> 16:36.760
It starts the conversation.

16:36.760 --> 16:37.760
Yeah.

16:37.760 --> 16:42.280
So Mozilla have got a lot of money sloshing around and they've got to spend it on something,

16:42.280 --> 16:46.160
but I'm still not a hundred percent convinced this is the kind of thing that they should

16:46.160 --> 16:50.560
be spending it on.

A full featured training library with everything you need to learn new skills and advance your

17:21.800 --> 17:22.800
career.

17:22.800 --> 17:27.360
One of the best features that sets Linux Academy apart is their instructor mentoring full time

17:27.360 --> 17:31.320
human beings that are there and happy to help you whenever you get stuck.

17:31.320 --> 17:36.680
And their hands on scenario based labs that give you experience on real servers so that

17:36.680 --> 17:42.480
way when you go take the test or go do the work in the real world, you've seen it before.

17:42.480 --> 17:43.520
You've done it before.

17:43.520 --> 17:48.560
They have six plus Linux distributions that you can choose from the servers and the courseware

17:48.560 --> 17:52.760
automatically adjust to the distribution you want to learn on.

17:52.760 --> 17:55.200
That's my favorite feature of all of them.

17:55.200 --> 17:58.920
And then if you're busy, you got a lot going on, they have a core scheduler.

17:58.920 --> 18:03.500
You set a time frame, it'll fit your schedule and they'll create learning goals for you.

18:03.500 --> 18:08.640
And speaking of learning goals, they have a series of learning courseware for specific

18:08.640 --> 18:10.400
goals that you might have in mind.

18:10.400 --> 18:15.200
Like say you want to go down to a very specific niche of an area, they have learning paths

18:15.200 --> 18:18.880
that it's great for that flashcards that get customized by the community.

18:18.880 --> 18:22.120
They have nuggets which are deep dives into single topics when you've got just a little

18:22.120 --> 18:23.180
bit of time.

18:23.180 --> 18:27.520

show and there's a lot coming in the month of April linuxacademy.com slash unplugged

18:38.160 --> 18:44.680
Okay, let's talk about Android security.

18:44.680 --> 18:46.720
And this week, I saw quite a lot of buzz about this.

18:46.720 --> 18:53.520
And that is a fair number of Android OMS are lying about the security patch levels.

18:53.520 --> 18:59.100
So if you go into the about phone or tablet, and then look, you'll see security patch level

18:59.100 --> 19:02.680
and it might say January 2018, or whatever.

19:02.680 --> 19:10.080
Well, quite a lot of OMS on certain devices are just telling out and out lies about that.

19:10.080 --> 19:12.340
Yeah, even some of the popular devices.

19:12.340 --> 19:15.280
So this is research that was done by hack in the box.

19:15.280 --> 19:20.800
And they're preparing to give a big demo at a conference in Amsterdam.

19:20.800 --> 19:24.600
And they're from the security research firm security research labs.

19:24.600 --> 19:27.600
And they they're going to give a whole overview of the data.

19:27.600 --> 19:30.280
But wired got early access to it.

19:30.280 --> 19:34.520
And going through it, they found what they call the researchers the patch gap.

19:34.520 --> 19:39.180
In many cases, certain vendors phones would just straight up tell users that they had

19:39.180 --> 19:43.320
all of the Android security updates, they were good to go.

19:43.320 --> 19:49.680
But in a lot of cases, in reality, they were missing as many as a dozen patches.

19:49.680 --> 19:54.640
They had the most recent quote unquote security update, but a subset of those patches would

19:54.640 --> 19:56.720
just simply not be installed.

19:56.720 --> 19:59.280
And so this they've nicknamed the patch gap.

19:59.280 --> 20:06.480
They tested the firmware of 1200 phones for more than a dozen phone manufacturers for

20:06.480 --> 20:10.740
every Android patch released since 2017.

20:10.740 --> 20:15.360
From devices that were made by Google themselves, including the pixel devices, and devices from

20:15.360 --> 20:20.520
Samsung down to the lower end lesser known Chinese owned devices.

20:20.520 --> 20:26.460
And some like the ZTEs and the TCLs, as well as in the mid range your HTC's and your Motorola.

20:26.460 --> 20:29.200
So it's a wide data sampling that they did this.

20:29.200 --> 20:33.840
And their testing found that other than Google's own flagship phones, like the pixel and the

20:33.840 --> 20:39.800
pixel two, even top tier phones sometimes like ones from Samsung failed to have all

20:39.800 --> 20:43.760
patches installed, and they actually lack some significant ones.

20:43.760 --> 20:48.120
And then of course, as you would expect, lower down the tier, it gets even worse.

20:48.120 --> 20:51.920
Well, it sounds very bad on the surface of things.

20:51.920 --> 20:55.280
But did you see what Google had to say in response to this?

20:55.280 --> 20:56.960
Yeah, I saw Google's response.

20:56.960 --> 21:00.160
So wired reached out to Google and said, What do you guys think about this?

21:00.160 --> 21:04.800
And Google's response was so typical, it sort of bothered me.

21:04.800 --> 21:08.420
First of all, they started with, Oh, we appreciate their research.

21:08.420 --> 21:12.620
But they didn't understand the complexity of the Android environment.

21:12.620 --> 21:13.880
That was essentially their response.

21:13.880 --> 21:18.800
And they argued that in some cases, patches may have been missing from devices just because

21:18.800 --> 21:22.320
the phone vendors didn't have those features to begin with.

21:22.320 --> 21:24.120
So there was nothing to patch.

21:24.120 --> 21:28.940
Or you know, some of these devices, they were never even certified by us to begin with.

21:28.940 --> 21:31.280
So you can't blame Android for that.

21:31.280 --> 21:32.880
But the researchers accounted for that.

21:32.880 --> 21:38.940
And their research shows it's in modern devices like Motorola devices, Samsung devices, totally

21:38.940 --> 21:40.820
certified devices by Google.

21:40.820 --> 21:45.640
So in my reading, that explanation barely holds water.

21:45.640 --> 21:51.280
Yeah, but one of the other potential explanations here is that it's not necessarily the OEM's

21:51.280 --> 21:52.280
fault.

21:52.280 --> 21:55.920
If you look at some of the cheaper phones that have like MediaTek processes and stuff,

21:55.920 --> 21:59.040
MediaTek are pretty bad at supplying patches to the OEM.

21:59.040 --> 22:00.760
So what can they do?

22:00.760 --> 22:02.940
Yeah, you are totally right about that.

22:02.940 --> 22:08.460
That's one of the things that this research truly demonstrates is that the further down

22:08.460 --> 22:15.640
you go on the price, the bigger problem just licensing patches or getting that that silicon

22:15.640 --> 22:17.880
vendor to write code become.

22:17.880 --> 22:21.860
And so if you have a Samsung device and Samsung is creating most of the chips, you are in

22:21.860 --> 22:23.200
the best position.

22:23.200 --> 22:27.320
If your device is loaded full of Qualcomm, you're in the next best position.

22:27.320 --> 22:29.020
It really begins to fall off.

22:29.020 --> 22:31.320
The worst offender is MediaTek.

22:31.320 --> 22:34.740
And now we have research data that clearly shows us that.

22:34.740 --> 22:38.520
And one of the things I appreciate about these researchers is they created visualizations

22:38.520 --> 22:39.520
to demonstrate this.

22:39.520 --> 22:42.080
We'll have a link in the show notes if you want to see that.

22:42.080 --> 22:47.240
And it's so obvious when you see it compared, Samsung is doing the best here as they should.

22:47.240 --> 22:51.800
They have unilateral control over a large portion of the silicon and the software.

22:51.800 --> 22:56.360
And MediaTek is doing the worst, which isn't surprising because they're the budget vendor.

22:56.360 --> 22:58.800
Yeah, whenever I see a phone, I think that it looks all right.

22:58.800 --> 23:03.440
And then I look down the specs and see MediaTek say, no, thank you.

23:03.440 --> 23:04.440
Not interested.

23:04.440 --> 23:05.440
Yeah.

23:05.440 --> 23:06.960
And this research just justified that.

23:06.960 --> 23:07.960
Yeah.

23:07.960 --> 23:11.480
Well, you mentioned that Google certifies certain devices and washes their hands of

23:11.480 --> 23:12.480
ones that they don't.

23:12.480 --> 23:16.840
Well, it looks like now with certain custom ROMs, you're going to struggle to use Google

23:16.840 --> 23:21.280
Play services, which if you are totally into freedom and just use an F-Droid, then it doesn't

23:21.280 --> 23:22.280
affect you.

23:22.280 --> 23:28.080
But if like me, you're kind of half pragmatic and you do have Google Play services installed,

23:28.080 --> 23:33.560
then you're going to have one more hoop to jump through when you install LineageOS, another

23:33.560 --> 23:34.680
similar custom ROMs.

23:34.680 --> 23:39.040
Yeah, I bet this isn't too surprising to anyone that has been listening to this show for a

23:39.040 --> 23:40.200
few weeks.

23:40.200 --> 23:45.000
And we go to the Lineage blog where they have broken down the state of play here.

23:45.000 --> 23:49.240
And they talk about Google Play certification, what it is and how it affects you.

23:49.240 --> 23:54.060
And their explanation of why it was done in the first place reads a little ominous.

23:54.060 --> 23:58.140
And they note that this is speculation on their part, but they say that some OEMs may

23:58.140 --> 24:05.000
have been shipping devices that contain Google Play services without device certification,

24:05.000 --> 24:11.360
which lowers the trust for app developers in being able to rely on the quality of devices

24:11.360 --> 24:14.280
running with Google Play services installed.

24:14.280 --> 24:16.000
Well, may have been shipping.

24:16.000 --> 24:17.680
We know that they have been shipping.

24:17.680 --> 24:22.120
There's tons of devices coming out of China that have got Google Play services and all

24:22.120 --> 24:26.320
the Play Store and everything that are not certified by Google.

24:26.320 --> 24:29.640
Well, this isn't exactly news, is it, that aspect of this?

24:29.640 --> 24:33.840
What's news here is that Google is starting to actually do something about it.

24:33.840 --> 24:34.840
I agree.

24:34.840 --> 24:35.840
It's not news.

24:35.840 --> 24:37.240
In fact, it's super obvious.

24:37.240 --> 24:38.960
To me, that's what's ominous about it.

24:38.960 --> 24:43.900
It to me reads as if the Lineage team heard from somebody at Google.

24:43.900 --> 24:46.760
They came a knocking and this is their response to it.

24:46.760 --> 24:48.280
Well, I don't think it's Google telling them.

24:48.280 --> 24:52.320
I think it's the community because people have been noticing over the last few weeks

24:52.320 --> 24:57.280
that certain devices and certain ROMs are just not working unless you take the Google

24:57.280 --> 25:02.880
services framework ID and go and register it on their certification page under your

25:02.880 --> 25:03.880
Google account.

25:03.880 --> 25:06.640
I've actually been keeping an eye on this over the last few weeks.

25:06.640 --> 25:11.920
It's only now that Lineage have actually posted about this that I thought we should talk about

25:11.920 --> 25:17.280
it because it was kind of a bit speculative, but now it's there in black and white on Lineage's

25:17.280 --> 25:19.080
blog.

25:19.080 --> 25:21.760
It's a serious issue that people are going to have to deal with.

25:21.760 --> 25:23.920
I mean, I say serious issue.

25:23.920 --> 25:28.320
For now, it's just a case of one hoop that you have to jump through, but you talk about

25:28.320 --> 25:34.220
it being ominous and yet it might be a case that Google will just stop Google Play services

25:34.220 --> 25:40.680
working if it's not a totally official certified device, which is not very good for people

25:40.680 --> 25:45.960
like me who don't want all the bloat of all the various other Google apps that I don't

25:45.960 --> 25:46.960
need.

25:46.960 --> 25:51.560
I only need a few Gmail and maps and stuff.

25:51.560 --> 25:58.320
I hope, I very much hope that this doesn't kill the custom ROM community because let's

25:58.320 --> 26:01.200
face it, how many people are running Google-less?

26:01.200 --> 26:02.200
Not very many.

26:02.200 --> 26:07.800
I know one failing from late night Linux, but most people in this whole community, the

26:07.800 --> 26:10.200
first thing they do is flash Google apps.

26:10.200 --> 26:16.160
So if that goes away, then it could just totally collapse as a community.

26:16.160 --> 26:22.600
You know, a year ago I did an experiment of no G apps on my Nexus device and it didn't

26:22.600 --> 26:26.040
end up working out for me, but I did take away one thing.

26:26.040 --> 26:30.960
I think I could have a two or three day battery life if I take off all of the Google apps

26:30.960 --> 26:32.040
and the Play API.

26:32.040 --> 26:35.520
It's a significant difference in the battery life, huge.

26:35.520 --> 26:36.920
That was my big takeaway.

26:36.920 --> 26:41.200
And so I've always kind of toyed with the idea of doing that again and just getting

26:41.200 --> 26:46.120
tremendous battery life out of my Nexus 6P and just extending it even longer.

26:46.120 --> 26:50.120
And I think we are getting a whiff of the way of the future here.

26:50.120 --> 26:53.980
This sort of continues a long-term trend we've seen with Android as they've pulled certain

26:53.980 --> 26:59.640
things out of the upstream and they've commercialized certain aspects of the Android ROM.

26:59.640 --> 27:04.920
Now we're going to have an official slot for the custom ROM community to fit in.

27:04.920 --> 27:10.120
You're going to be able to be legitimate citizens of the Play ecosystem, congratulations.

27:10.120 --> 27:16.480
You're also going to be controlled and over time systematically reduced in capabilities by Google.

27:16.480 --> 27:17.800
And I can't see it any other way.

27:17.800 --> 27:23.040
This has clearly been coming and now LineageOS, because they don't want to be crushed by Google,

27:23.040 --> 27:24.680
is clearly playing ball to this.

27:24.680 --> 27:29.280
Yeah, well I suppose we'll just have to stick to the stock ROMs or just not even use Android

27:29.280 --> 27:32.600
at all and just be an Apple fanboy like you and use an iPhone.

27:32.600 --> 27:33.600
Absolutely.

27:33.600 --> 27:38.200
