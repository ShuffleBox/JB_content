00:00.000 --> 00:16.180
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, our weekly take on Linux and the open source world.

00:16.180 --> 00:20.140
This is episode 66, recorded on August 12th, 2018.

00:20.140 --> 00:21.140
I'm Chris.

00:21.140 --> 00:22.140
And I'm Joe.

00:22.140 --> 00:23.140
Hello, Joe.

00:23.140 --> 00:24.140
It's good to be connected with you.

00:24.140 --> 00:25.140
And what do you say?

00:25.140 --> 00:26.420
Should we start things out with a little pie?

00:26.420 --> 00:27.420
Yes.

00:27.420 --> 00:29.880
Android version 9 pie has been released.

00:29.880 --> 00:35.320
And it's powered by AI for a smarter, simpler experience that adapts to you.

00:35.320 --> 00:37.560
I almost believe it now.

00:37.560 --> 00:44.080
Yeah, it seems like all the features are based around this idea of monitoring what you are

00:44.080 --> 00:48.760
doing with your phone and making your experience much better as a result of collecting all

00:48.760 --> 00:52.280
that data and definitely not using it to sell you better ads or anything.

00:52.280 --> 00:53.280
No, of course not.

00:53.280 --> 00:54.280
It's all going to be private.

00:54.280 --> 00:59.160
I mean, it does result in things like adaptive battery that I think is actually going to

00:59.160 --> 01:04.160
be pretty useful and perhaps the app actions, which could be fairly useful.

01:04.160 --> 01:07.800
But one does wonder what happens with these metrics, even if not much happens now, what

01:07.800 --> 01:08.800
happens in the future.

01:08.800 --> 01:13.720
But you know, there's still a lot of other really, really appealing features to Android

01:13.720 --> 01:15.820
9 that I thought were worth mentioning.

01:15.820 --> 01:22.520
It now supports 802.11 MC, which is a Wi-Fi protocol that lets you use indoor navigation.

01:22.520 --> 01:26.360
It's also known as Wi-Fi Round Trip Time, RTT.

01:26.360 --> 01:29.700
It's a new feature that enables GPS-style tracking by determining your location within

01:29.700 --> 01:30.700
a building.

01:30.700 --> 01:38.560
Again, also useful for tracking you and facilitating turn-by-turn directions to help you get from

01:38.560 --> 01:42.800
inside the building to the road, which if you think about it, if you're traveling, that's

01:42.800 --> 01:44.240
kind of useful actually.

01:44.240 --> 01:47.320
And there's probably a lot of potential uses for that.

01:47.320 --> 01:49.640
Another one that I thought was good was lockdown mode.

01:49.640 --> 01:54.240
It's a mode you can go in now and disable biometrics like face scanning or the fingerprint

01:54.240 --> 01:56.880
options until you re-enable it.

01:56.880 --> 02:00.560
That's just maybe useful again for certain folks in certain situations.

02:00.560 --> 02:04.240
Notification channels, which is a revamp again to the notifications and making it easier

02:04.240 --> 02:07.360
to dismiss ones you don't typically want to consume.

02:07.360 --> 02:10.880
And the last one that I'll pull out right here that I just think is fantastic and Apple

02:10.880 --> 02:13.200
needs it to rip this off immediately.

02:13.200 --> 02:19.120
An auto-rotate button appears in the navigation bar when your phone is rotated to an orientation

02:19.120 --> 02:21.680
that is not currently locked to.

02:21.680 --> 02:23.360
So I just do this all the dang time.

02:23.360 --> 02:27.300
I just prefer to have orientation lock on so that way I don't have any surprise switches.

02:27.300 --> 02:31.760
But then I'll, on the rare occasion, turn my phone horizontally and sit there and shake

02:31.760 --> 02:37.080
it for a second like a monkey before I realize, oh, I have orientation lock on.

02:37.080 --> 02:40.920
But now in 9, a little button will show up in the menu bar.

02:40.920 --> 02:44.500
Where down where you have like your home button and your back button, there will now be an

02:44.500 --> 02:46.760
auto-rotate button that shows up.

02:46.760 --> 02:51.760
That is going to be really useful when it does finally roll out to everybody.

02:51.760 --> 02:56.000
Oh, and one last bonus extra feature I liked a lot, HTTPS by default.

02:56.000 --> 02:57.600
Yeah, some of it's good.

02:57.600 --> 03:03.160
But what about this hand-holding stuff where they talk about like, at the end of the day,

03:03.160 --> 03:08.480
it's going to go grayscale and tell you that you've had enough of using your phone and

03:08.480 --> 03:10.480
you can set timeouts for apps and stuff.

03:10.480 --> 03:14.760
That to me, if you need a phone to tell you to do that stuff, then maybe just get a dumb

03:14.760 --> 03:16.240
phone or something.

03:16.240 --> 03:18.240
Digital well-being is what they're calling that feature.

03:18.240 --> 03:20.760
They're launching it first on the Pixel phones.

03:20.760 --> 03:25.240
And I do follow what you're saying, like the grayscale mode, the timers that show you how

03:25.240 --> 03:27.200
much time you spent in the apps.

03:27.200 --> 03:29.920
I don't really quite get the idea here.

03:29.920 --> 03:33.080
Here we're going to build these super attractive devices that have all these great features,

03:33.080 --> 03:35.580
and then we're going to build in features to prevent you from using it.

03:35.580 --> 03:40.600
So the incentive seems off from Google's standpoint, and the incentive seems off from the user's

03:40.600 --> 03:41.600
standpoint.

03:41.600 --> 03:44.440
Why are you spending all this money and time and paying for subscription services for these

03:44.440 --> 03:47.200
devices if you're preventing yourself from using them?

03:47.200 --> 03:50.560
And if you can't self-meter, there's probably something else going on there.

03:50.560 --> 03:55.360
That's my personal opinion, but I had a conversation about this in Linux Unplugged last week, and

03:55.360 --> 03:59.280
I did have a couple people in the mobile room chime up and say, I actually could really

03:59.280 --> 04:00.400
use these features.

04:00.400 --> 04:03.560
I do need a bit of a nudge to tell me to take a break.

04:03.560 --> 04:05.640
I won't do it otherwise.

04:05.640 --> 04:07.680
And so I think it's not that bad.

04:07.680 --> 04:11.500
I'll tell you, the scuttlebutt is that it's the boards of these companies that are forcing

04:11.500 --> 04:16.120
them to do these things to try to combat the addictive narratives that are starting to

04:16.120 --> 04:19.920
propagate around these devices and the services that people use on these devices.

04:19.920 --> 04:25.040
So to combat the addictive narrative, they're going with these well-being features.

04:25.040 --> 04:26.040
That's the rumors.

04:26.040 --> 04:29.960
Yeah, not to mention combating potential future regulation where they'll be forced to do

04:29.960 --> 04:30.960
it.

04:30.960 --> 04:33.160
Why not do it before there's legislation that makes you?

04:33.160 --> 04:35.280
Yeah, that could be it.

04:35.280 --> 04:38.640
And maybe it's something that's not even specific yet, but they could just see coming down the

04:38.640 --> 04:43.000
road and so they figured tackle it now and bake it and get it right.

04:43.000 --> 04:46.620
And for Google at least, it's probably going to be an avenue of a great bunch of insight

04:46.620 --> 04:47.620
for them.

04:47.620 --> 04:48.620
So yay.

04:48.620 --> 04:54.880
Another interesting aspect of the Android 9 rollout is there were more OEMs that participated

04:54.880 --> 04:55.880
in the beta program.

04:55.880 --> 04:58.600
So it's not really just the Pixel devices.

04:58.600 --> 05:04.080
Pretty soon, some Sony devices, YaoMei, HMD Mobile, OnePlus, and the Essential phone will

05:04.080 --> 05:09.960
also receive updates this fall to Android P. So that's nice to see that some other manufacturers

05:09.960 --> 05:11.360
have been included in this process.

05:11.360 --> 05:16.200
It's still a bit of a code dump approach to Android development, but expanding that official

05:16.200 --> 05:18.920
beta program is definitely good for consumers.

05:18.920 --> 05:23.880
Well, I'll be interested in this as soon as there's a lineage version for my phone, but

05:23.880 --> 05:26.280
until then, not that interested.

05:26.280 --> 05:30.400
The navigation changes, I'm not interested in at all.

05:30.400 --> 05:34.000
They're talking about removing the back button and having that only show up when you need

05:34.000 --> 05:40.600
it and there's some potentially pretty wacky UI or UX changes, which I'm just not enthused

05:40.600 --> 05:44.960
about whatsoever and I'm really hoping will stay optional forever.

05:44.960 --> 05:46.800
I imagine they will for a while.

05:46.800 --> 05:50.920
I think I have a different perspective on them just because they've been pretty successful

05:50.920 --> 05:51.920
on the iPhone X.

05:51.920 --> 05:55.920
I, for a long time, have felt that if UI elements aren't discoverable, if you can't see them

05:55.920 --> 05:57.720
on the screen, they're not going to get used by users.

05:57.720 --> 06:00.960
Hidden gestures just get left unused.

06:00.960 --> 06:05.680
But if you can kind of build in a routine around a couple of them, they do make for

06:05.680 --> 06:07.560
using your device a little bit faster.

06:07.560 --> 06:09.800
The task switcher on the iPhone X is killer.

06:09.800 --> 06:12.760
You can flip through applications as fast as your thumb can move.

06:12.760 --> 06:15.320
And I think bringing that to Android, I'd use it.

06:15.320 --> 06:17.680
Okay, well that's enough about Android Linux.

06:17.680 --> 06:21.760
Let's talk about some proper GNU slash Linux and hardware stuff.

06:21.760 --> 06:25.720
So you are pretty much going to buy a ThinkPad because of this next story.

06:25.720 --> 06:31.840
Yeah, that T480 is looking so sweet right now and that's because Lenovo has joined LVFS.

06:31.840 --> 06:33.320
That's the project that we love.

06:33.320 --> 06:38.720
It's the Linux Vendor Firmware Service and it gives Linux users feature parity with MacBooks

06:38.720 --> 06:41.560
and Windows users for firmware updates.

06:41.560 --> 06:46.200
UEFI updates, Intel microcode updates, they come right down to traditional software update

06:46.200 --> 06:50.300
channels like GNOME Software or very soon, Plasma Discover.

06:50.300 --> 06:54.960
And this is a big, big milestone for Lenovo because it has been a major standout feature

06:54.960 --> 06:56.480
of my XPS 13.

06:56.480 --> 06:59.640
I think it's been a fantastic aspect of that little box the entire time I've owned it.

06:59.640 --> 07:03.520
I've really advocated other hardware OEMs do this as well because it's a good experience

07:03.520 --> 07:05.240
and it keeps people secure.

07:05.240 --> 07:08.680
It's interesting to see Lenovo doing this when you don't really consider them to be

07:08.680 --> 07:11.160
a big player in the Linux marketplace though.

07:11.160 --> 07:15.560
Well it's funny that when Richard Hughes wrote his blog post about this on the GNOME blog,

07:15.560 --> 07:19.780
he says, if anyone from HP is reading this, you're now officially late.

07:19.780 --> 07:23.280
So yeah, he's kind of looking at them saying you should join as well.

07:23.280 --> 07:28.160
But it's interesting that he also talked about how they kind of had to bend over backwards

07:28.160 --> 07:29.420
for Lenovo here.

07:29.420 --> 07:32.480
They made it a little bit awkward for them.

07:32.480 --> 07:38.100
It's good that it's finally sorted out and they're finally on board with it, but it seems

07:38.100 --> 07:41.200
like they had quite specific stipulations there.

07:41.200 --> 07:44.280
Yeah they talk about working on their back end to bring Lenovo in.

07:44.280 --> 07:51.080
They talk about some changes they had to make to FW update and FW up D and even some changes

07:51.080 --> 07:57.680
to the actual LVFS admin portal itself for very vendor specific reasons.

07:57.680 --> 08:00.600
But that strikes me as part of this process.

08:00.600 --> 08:04.760
Yeah I suppose we're used to this kind of open source collaboration type attitude where

08:04.760 --> 08:09.280
people just get on with it, but we're talking about corporate entities here that can't just

08:09.280 --> 08:12.680
do things like this on a whim, there has to be a process.

08:12.680 --> 08:18.560
So I suppose it's fair enough and the headline is, at least they're part of it now, even

08:18.560 --> 08:22.440
if it took a long time and was quite an effort to make it happen.

08:22.440 --> 08:25.480
There are a couple of exceptions to this list.

08:25.480 --> 08:28.080
Anything really pre UEFI is not supported.

08:28.080 --> 08:30.160
The yoga line of products is not supported.

08:30.160 --> 08:35.000
It's your ThinkPads primarily, but some of the more beloved and famous ThinkPads are

08:35.000 --> 08:41.320
on this list including the T480s, the X1 Carbon and the P series of ThinkPads.

08:41.320 --> 08:46.560
Those are all really great laptops and the ThinkPad X1 Yoga is on the list as well.

08:46.560 --> 08:50.240
So check this, we'll have it linked in the show notes if this applies to you.

08:50.240 --> 08:52.800
Also this list includes all of the other manufacturers.

08:52.800 --> 08:57.200
It's a very extensive list now that are in the LVFS project.

08:57.200 --> 09:00.760
So check that out at linuxactionnews.com slash 66.

09:00.760 --> 09:04.360
Well speaking of Richard Hughes, there's another post from him on the GNOME blog this week

09:04.360 --> 09:07.720
about automatic updates for Flatpaks.

09:07.720 --> 09:11.680
Now before you panic, this will be a setting that you can turn off in GNOME software if

09:11.680 --> 09:13.400
you do not want auto updates.

09:13.400 --> 09:17.280
I know one of the first comments that I saw was, I'm on a mobile connection.

09:17.280 --> 09:19.280
Yeah, I feel you on that one.

09:19.280 --> 09:20.920
Don't worry, you'll be able to turn this off.

09:20.920 --> 09:25.140
This is also bringing feature parity to a similar function with snap packages where

09:25.140 --> 09:27.520
they update every 24 hours.

09:27.520 --> 09:30.000
You have to remember, these are all confined applications.

09:30.000 --> 09:31.800
They exist in their own little space.

09:31.800 --> 09:33.640
They don't really touch the rest of your system.

09:33.640 --> 09:36.420
They're not dependent on the libraries on your system.

09:36.420 --> 09:38.420
They don't update the other libraries on your system.

09:38.420 --> 09:42.440
So it's been pretty minimal impact on all of my systems that have snaps.

09:42.440 --> 09:45.720
So I'd probably use this on the Flatpak side and I like that they make it easy to turn

09:45.720 --> 09:46.720
it off.

09:46.720 --> 09:50.000
They've also announced some other improvements coming along to GNOME software.

09:50.000 --> 09:52.000
Seems like some good stuff is coming down the pipe.

09:52.000 --> 09:56.760
Yeah, specifically there's a new free desktop runtime for Flatpaks, version 18.08.

09:56.760 --> 09:59.920
Yeah, Alexander Larson is making news this week.

09:59.920 --> 10:04.560
He's a Red Hat employee who has outlined a new runtime option for Flatpak.

10:04.560 --> 10:12.680
The free desktop SDK is a collection of things like Python, SQLite, SDL, Vulkan, specifically

10:12.680 --> 10:17.960
Vulkan 1.173 for those of you who care, OpenSSL, and et cetera, a bunch of libraries and tools

10:17.960 --> 10:20.360
that you could use as a base system.

10:20.360 --> 10:24.840
We was asked if maybe it would be better if this was based off of more mainstream distribution

10:24.840 --> 10:25.840
as a runtime.

10:25.840 --> 10:30.400
So like a Debian runtime or a Fedora runtime.

10:30.400 --> 10:35.640
But the whole point with the free desktop SDK runtime is it's sort of vendor neutral.

10:35.640 --> 10:38.840
It's got a collection of some of the best of open source that you can then use to build

10:38.840 --> 10:40.760
your application on top of.

10:40.760 --> 10:41.840
I like that idea.

10:41.840 --> 10:45.000
I think that, especially for Flatpak, I think that works pretty well.

10:45.000 --> 10:47.440
There's different options, but I think that works pretty well.

10:47.440 --> 10:51.440
And in a way that makes Flatpak stand out as opposed to Snaps, because with Snaps you've

10:51.440 --> 10:56.800
got the specific Ubuntu runtime or this week now we've got the Fedora runtime.

10:56.800 --> 11:01.520
And to have something that is distro agnostic, I think makes it more appealing to developers.

11:01.520 --> 11:05.120
Yeah, I could definitely see that, and I think that's their theory as well.

11:05.120 --> 11:09.080
I would like to see this play out, and that's why I like that we have two approaches right

11:09.080 --> 11:10.080
now.

11:10.080 --> 11:15.280
Because with the Snap approach, I could see that also being more appealing to developers.

11:15.280 --> 11:19.760
You could go with a Debian runtime, or a Fedora runtime, or an Ubuntu runtime, and those are

11:19.760 --> 11:21.280
environments you're familiar with.

11:21.280 --> 11:23.800
Maybe you've already developed some software in those environments.

11:23.800 --> 11:26.840
Maybe you already have a few things banged out that you're running on your own local

11:26.840 --> 11:27.840
Ubuntu desktop.

11:27.840 --> 11:33.080
So being able to start and work with something you already know as a runtime could actually

11:33.080 --> 11:37.720
be more advantageous in the marketplace when you look at the way developers actually work.

11:37.720 --> 11:40.960
We won't really know until we just sit back and watch.

11:40.960 --> 11:43.640
The end users don't really have to worry about it either way.

11:43.640 --> 11:47.760
Whichever runtime the developers are using, they don't really have to care about.

11:47.760 --> 11:50.720
The Snaps or the Flatpaks will just install them.

11:50.720 --> 11:55.040
And a lot of people are kind of waiting for a winner of this war between Snaps and Flatpak,

11:55.040 --> 11:57.360
but it's just not like that at all, is it?

11:57.360 --> 11:58.560
That's not how open source works.

11:58.560 --> 12:01.040
We're not going to end up with one standard.

12:01.040 --> 12:08.920
We're just going to have two competing standards that both work equally well.

12:08.920 --> 12:15.160
That's where you go to get a $100 credit over a Digital Ocean.

12:15.160 --> 12:20.000
And every system you deploy has enterprise grade SSDs, 40 gigabit connections coming

12:20.000 --> 12:23.980
into the hypervisors, and yes, data centers all over the world.

12:23.980 --> 12:26.200
My favorite thing about Digital Ocean is their dashboard.

12:26.200 --> 12:28.960
I like to mention that because it makes a difference.

12:28.960 --> 12:32.760
The dashboard is so great and the rest of the system is so fast that you can get up

12:32.760 --> 12:34.240
and going in minutes.

12:34.240 --> 12:39.240
And that means you can go from, hey, I've got an idea to, hey, the thing's up in minutes.

12:39.240 --> 12:43.080
And that's sometimes all it takes to actually get going on something.

12:43.080 --> 12:47.360
I think some of the best projects that we've kicked off over the years really on Digital

12:47.360 --> 12:52.200
Ocean have been ideas that we just said, let's go fire up a droplet and take a look.

12:52.200 --> 12:56.320
And then 15 minutes later, we're installing software and we're trying things out.

12:56.320 --> 13:00.900
It's so fast and so convenient that we'll often spin up a droplet before TechSnap and

13:00.900 --> 13:04.520
try something out that we're covering in the show just for research purposes.

13:04.520 --> 13:08.480
And we'll just do it right here in the studio, in my web browser.

13:08.480 --> 13:11.840
As we're looking at a story, we'll just try it out and see if we can replicate the same

13:11.840 --> 13:12.840
thing.

13:12.840 --> 13:13.840
We can do it in minutes.

13:13.840 --> 13:17.920
And they have an API that's super well documented, clean, easy to follow.

13:17.920 --> 13:21.520
Even if you're not a full-time developer, you're gonna understand what that thing does.

13:21.520 --> 13:25.440
But the best part is that means there's lots of open source applications that have already

13:25.440 --> 13:28.680
been created that you can go take advantage of right now.

13:28.680 --> 13:32.280
My favorite system is just three cents an hour at Digital Ocean that gets you four gigs

13:32.280 --> 13:39.000
of RAM, two CPUs, an 80 gigabyte SSD, three terabytes of transfer, and it's all for three

13:39.000 --> 13:40.240
cents an hour.

13:40.240 --> 13:41.520
Three cents an hour?

13:41.520 --> 13:43.040
That's ridiculous.

13:43.040 --> 13:47.480
Go get on some of that with a $100 credit for new accounts at do.co action.

13:47.480 --> 13:52.800
Okay, let's talk about blockchain.

13:52.800 --> 13:57.280
And for once, we're not talking about cryptocurrencies, we're not talking about initial coin offerings

13:57.280 --> 13:58.280
and scams.

13:58.280 --> 14:03.880
We're talking about a real-world implementation of blockchain technology, which will actually

14:03.880 --> 14:06.960
make a difference to businesses all over the world.

14:06.960 --> 14:11.560
IBM and Maersk, which is the largest shipping company in the world, announced Wednesday

14:11.560 --> 14:13.800
a new platform called TradeLens.

14:13.800 --> 14:19.600
They've roped in 94 firms, and it's all based around the Hyperledger.

14:19.600 --> 14:22.980
Now, Maersk is the largest shipping company in the world, and you're probably familiar

14:22.980 --> 14:24.520
with who IBM is.

14:24.520 --> 14:27.600
They're gonna sell access to the TradeLens platform.

14:27.600 --> 14:32.000
The selling party will contract with the customer and receive all of the fees and revenue rather

14:32.000 --> 14:34.160
than sharing it with the other partner.

14:34.160 --> 14:37.000
This is according to the way the system's going to work.

14:37.000 --> 14:43.880
It's a new model to help companies trade and share contracts, and IBM and Maersk sit back

14:43.880 --> 14:45.560
and take the revenue.

14:45.560 --> 14:50.860
It's built on the Hyperledger fabric, which is a project of the Linux Foundation, an open

14:50.860 --> 14:56.020
source project of the Linux Foundation, which has some changes to the way a peer-to-peer

14:56.020 --> 15:03.760
blockchain verification system normally works, primarily changes to enable some private transactions

15:03.760 --> 15:08.940
and to take some nodes out of the verification process.

15:08.940 --> 15:14.360
They're calling this an open supply chain ecosystem, and they say it's open because

15:14.360 --> 15:17.560
they're publishing about 100 APIs.

15:17.560 --> 15:24.600
Really it's just a business-to-business transaction enabler that IBM and Maersk are gonna make

15:24.600 --> 15:30.040
a bunch of money off of, and they've used the Hyperledger fabric to enable it.

15:30.040 --> 15:35.920
It is, like you say, though, a real-world use of blockchain, and it's at a massive scale

15:35.920 --> 15:36.920
already.

15:36.920 --> 15:41.520
It's funny that when I read this story, only minutes before I'd been talking to some friends

15:41.520 --> 15:48.560
about blockchain hype and how my example of what a great implementation of it would be

15:48.560 --> 15:53.840
would be for a logistics company, and then boom, I read this headline, read the article,

15:53.840 --> 15:55.720
and then sent them a link to it.

15:55.720 --> 16:01.560
It's so easy to dismiss blockchain stories, because that same day I kept an eye out and

16:01.560 --> 16:06.960
I counted four or five other blockchain-based stories which were just ICO stuff and just

16:06.960 --> 16:12.680
hype, whereas this, to me, is an actual concrete example of what that hype is actually all

16:12.680 --> 16:13.680
about.

16:13.680 --> 16:18.080
The blockchain is basically just a database, but it's distributed, it's cryptographically

16:18.080 --> 16:22.440
signed, so you know that no one can mess with it, it's automatically backed up to wherever

16:22.440 --> 16:24.320
you want it to be.

16:24.320 --> 16:28.880
It's just a next-generation database, really, when you think about it.

16:28.880 --> 16:30.840
That's how I've thought about it for a while, and that's why I've always thought, it'll

16:30.840 --> 16:36.660
be a moneymaker, it'll just be in really boring ways that it's a moneymaker, and it does strike

16:36.660 --> 16:41.560
me that it could be like this fundamental enabler of transactions between shipping companies

16:41.560 --> 16:47.800
and banking companies and technology companies, and we don't really know the original author.

16:47.800 --> 16:53.240
Satoshi Nakamoto is still unidentified, and we're just proceeding right along.

16:53.240 --> 16:54.240
I think that's fascinating.

16:54.240 --> 16:59.120
Well, I'll tell you what's going to be fascinating, watching you scramble to try and replace Dropbox,

16:59.120 --> 17:01.240
which you're going to have to do very soon.

17:01.240 --> 17:03.680
So angry this week.

17:03.680 --> 17:05.860
I always knew this day was coming.

17:05.860 --> 17:12.180
I've known this day was coming, and now it has arrived on, well, it will arrive on November

17:12.180 --> 17:19.280
7th, 2018, Dropbox is screwing over all Linux users who are not on straight Extended-4.

17:19.280 --> 17:22.760
If you have an encrypted Extended-4 partition, you're out of here.

17:22.760 --> 17:25.120
If you use ButterFS, you're out of here.

17:25.120 --> 17:27.940
If you use XFS, ZFS, you're out of here.

17:27.940 --> 17:32.840
They write in their forum post, this is by community moderator Jay over at the Dropbox

17:32.840 --> 17:37.760
forum, he says, we're ending support for Dropbox syncing to drives with certain uncommon file

17:37.760 --> 17:38.760
systems.

17:38.760 --> 17:44.840
The supported file systems are now going to be NTFS for Windows, HFS Plus or APFS for

17:44.840 --> 17:47.760
the Mac, and Extended-4 for Linux.

17:47.760 --> 17:52.960
A supported file system is required as Dropbox relies on Extended attributes to identify

17:52.960 --> 17:56.080
files in the Dropbox folder and keep them in sync.

17:56.080 --> 18:00.200
We will keep supporting only the most common file systems that support Extended attributes

18:00.200 --> 18:03.720
so we can ensure stability and a consistent experience.

18:03.720 --> 18:05.560
I'm not buying this, Joe.

18:05.560 --> 18:08.680
All right, ButterFS, we can let that go.

18:08.680 --> 18:11.560
XFS, probably not huge for desktop Linux.

18:11.560 --> 18:17.120
But XFS, I think is one of the unsung heroes of the Linux file systems.

18:17.120 --> 18:21.280
I've literally been using XFS since the early 2000s.

18:21.280 --> 18:26.200
And it was one of the file systems I chose initially because it supported Extended attributes.

18:26.200 --> 18:30.880
And I needed that to have feature parity on my Samba servers with NTFS.

18:30.880 --> 18:38.240
And to say that XFS isn't a mainstream file system, it was introduced with IRIX in 1994.

18:38.240 --> 18:43.120
And it is still a very actively developed file system, even more so in the last few

18:43.120 --> 18:46.720
years, with incredibly great features being added to it still.

18:46.720 --> 18:48.280
And this is just going to force my hand.

18:48.280 --> 18:50.200
I will have to cancel my Dropbox account.

18:50.200 --> 18:51.520
I will have to move to something else.

18:51.520 --> 18:57.480
I have been spinning up a Nextcloud instance for a couple of years now, testing it lightly.

18:57.480 --> 19:01.800
Of course, we've experimented with C file and a lot of other little back-end things

19:01.800 --> 19:05.200
that are just simpler, like rsync jobs and whatnot.

19:05.200 --> 19:08.520
So there's a whole range of different solutions I've experimented with.

19:08.520 --> 19:12.280
And I'll just pick the one that's sort of done the best and move.

19:12.280 --> 19:15.880
But it's pretty disappointing because there are some people I work with remotely that

19:15.880 --> 19:19.920
have this really integrated into their workflow that will have to also make changes.

19:19.920 --> 19:22.880
And you always feel like a jerk when you have to ask somebody to change the way they work.

19:22.880 --> 19:25.760
What, like when you force me to use Dropbox in the first place?

19:25.760 --> 19:26.760
Better than Google Drive.

19:26.760 --> 19:29.220
At least this has a client.

19:29.220 --> 19:30.220
It has a client.

19:30.220 --> 19:31.360
Well, not for me.

19:31.360 --> 19:32.520
I've never installed a client.

19:32.520 --> 19:33.940
I just use the website.

19:33.940 --> 19:36.760
So I could keep using this exactly as I have been.

19:36.760 --> 19:37.760
I know, Joe.

19:37.760 --> 19:38.760
Oh, I know.

19:38.760 --> 19:39.760
I am aware.

19:39.760 --> 19:43.480
And it drives me crazy that this even went somewhat in your direction because you've

19:43.480 --> 19:47.280
been giving me a hard time about it for weeks and months.

19:47.280 --> 19:50.160
But the truth is it is a good service.

19:50.160 --> 19:55.000
But the reality is Linux users just don't represent a large enough portion of the market

19:55.000 --> 19:58.320
to really force these guys to work hard for us.

19:58.320 --> 20:01.760
And if you don't have a company that's committed and they don't have a large enough user base

20:01.760 --> 20:06.680
that makes up their revenue for it, they're just going to constantly be screwing us over.

20:06.680 --> 20:12.200
And the only real long-term solution, we all know it, is to use free software solutions.

20:12.200 --> 20:15.200
It's just sometimes the sauce is harder to get off than you expect.

20:15.200 --> 20:16.200
Well, yeah, definitely.

20:16.200 --> 20:20.680
And you talk about XFS being a mainstream file system, but are there any mainstream

20:20.680 --> 20:22.800
distros that default to it?

20:22.800 --> 20:25.980
Or do you have to format your own partitions and specify XFS?

20:25.980 --> 20:31.440
As far as I know, they all use, well, SUSE and stuff uses ButterFS and Fedora's got its

20:31.440 --> 20:35.200
own complicated stuff, but the likes of Ubuntu defaults to ext4.

20:35.200 --> 20:39.340
So in reality, I don't think that many people are going to be affected by this.

20:39.340 --> 20:43.680
If you are a standard user, then you're going to be using ext4 anyway.

20:43.680 --> 20:49.440
Well don't forget, it's also if you have an ext4 encrypted home partition, which a lot

20:49.440 --> 20:50.440
of people do.

20:50.440 --> 20:52.680
Some distributions do that by default now even.

20:52.680 --> 20:53.680
Well there's always a website.

20:53.680 --> 20:58.000
You can always fire up Firefox and use completely free software to interface with their proprietary

20:58.000 --> 20:59.000
backend.

20:59.000 --> 21:00.480
Yeah, it's definitely time to switch to something else.

21:00.480 --> 21:05.320
I had tried to make a switch once before and it went horribly wrong, almost resulted in

21:05.320 --> 21:12.280
dramatic data loss, but this time there is a serious incentive, that November 7th deadline.

21:12.280 --> 21:17.560
Well I'm sure that you can embrace open source because even Hollywood can.

21:17.560 --> 21:18.680
It's about time.

21:18.680 --> 21:21.240
We know it's always been behind the scenes.

21:21.240 --> 21:25.400
You hear little reports here and there about how Linux or open source was involved in the

21:25.400 --> 21:28.320
production of some big Hollywood blockbuster.

21:28.320 --> 21:33.000
Well now the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences, that's the organization behind

21:33.000 --> 21:37.960
the Oscars, announced that it has partnered with the Linux Foundation to launch the Academy

21:37.960 --> 21:42.760
Software Foundation, a new open source foundation for developers in the motion picture and media

21:42.760 --> 21:44.160
space.

21:44.160 --> 21:48.680
And this is a lot cooler than I initially thought it was.

21:48.680 --> 21:52.560
This is sort of the perfect match of a bunch of people that have been underrepresented

21:52.560 --> 21:58.420
inside media production houses and the Linux Foundation, who will be running admin for

21:58.420 --> 22:04.360
infrastructure for collecting code, checking out licenses, submitting them to GitHub, bringing

22:04.360 --> 22:09.560
stewardship to projects that have been maybe maintained by some gal in a corner of an office

22:09.560 --> 22:11.800
somewhere or some guy in the basement.

22:11.800 --> 22:15.280
They will now be submitted up to the Linux Foundation, they'll review them, they'll check

22:15.280 --> 22:19.920
through them, they'll make sure that everything's documented, the license stuff is right, and

22:19.920 --> 22:22.240
then publish them up to GitHub.

22:22.240 --> 22:24.440
This is sort of great, Joe.

22:24.440 --> 22:27.500
I see a lot of people being surprised by this.

22:27.500 --> 22:29.800
And for me, it wasn't a huge surprise.

22:29.800 --> 22:36.160
Hollywood, the motion picture industry, the TV industry, it's all an industry, right?

22:36.160 --> 22:37.520
They're there to make money.

22:37.520 --> 22:38.880
And what do industries do?

22:38.880 --> 22:42.640
They choose pragmatic ways to make more money.

22:42.640 --> 22:48.120
And open source has spread like wildfire over the last 10 or 15 years into all industries,

22:48.120 --> 22:53.040
because it's just better at certain things, and it's just a pragmatic approach here.

22:53.040 --> 22:56.040
And we're not talking about free software, there was no mention of that at all, was there?

22:56.040 --> 22:58.480
This was all open source.

22:58.480 --> 23:04.800
And it's just yet another industry embracing a pragmatic approach to make more money.

23:04.800 --> 23:09.440
According to a survey by the Academy, 84% of that industry uses open source software

23:09.440 --> 23:13.300
already, mostly for animation and visual effects.

23:13.300 --> 23:17.480
And there's a quote in here by the Chief Technology Officer of Walt Disney Animations, and he

23:17.480 --> 23:22.240
says, by increasing collaboration within our industry, it allows us to pool our efforts

23:22.240 --> 23:27.700
to a common foundation of technologies, drive new standards for interoperability, and increase

23:27.700 --> 23:29.980
the pace of innovation.

23:29.980 --> 23:34.240
I like all those statements, and I did some investigation into how this is going to work

23:34.240 --> 23:37.920
structurally and practically, and it's pretty solid.

23:37.920 --> 23:42.240
It started really as a conversation between a couple of media companies and the Linux

23:42.240 --> 23:44.880
Foundation just asking for help.

23:44.880 --> 23:46.620
Hey, we've got ourselves a real mess here.

23:46.620 --> 23:49.420
Can you give us some advice on how to dig ourselves out of this?

23:49.420 --> 23:53.480
And over eight or nine months, it developed into this much larger relationship where the

23:53.480 --> 24:00.660
Linux Foundation, I believe, saw a real opportunity here to provide some back end services to

24:00.660 --> 24:07.560
do the things that the Foundation can be particularly good at that the artists and creators in Hollywood

24:07.560 --> 24:11.500
are not, because they're focused on making movies and television and etc.

24:11.500 --> 24:16.520
And the Linux Foundation can be focused on the actual open source code that's doing that

24:16.520 --> 24:17.520
work.

24:17.520 --> 24:21.080
Well, how many times recently have we talked about this very thing?

24:21.080 --> 24:23.880
Distributions like Slackware that are having financial problems.

24:23.880 --> 24:26.120
And the answer to me seems obvious.

24:26.120 --> 24:30.440
Someone like the Linux Foundation or Mozilla, someone who can take care of the admin, the

24:30.440 --> 24:33.720
boring stuff that you don't want to have to deal with.

24:33.720 --> 24:35.480
And this is a prime example of that.

24:35.480 --> 24:40.080
Yeah, I do think it's a bit of a milestone, it feels like to me, though, the fact that

24:40.080 --> 24:46.400
Hollywood has so openly embraced open source in this and is talking about ways to collaborate

24:46.400 --> 24:51.360
between studios on that code and trying to break out where they've created silos or somebody's

24:51.360 --> 24:54.840
been patching something and patching something that hasn't been submitted upstream.

24:54.840 --> 24:56.880
They're trying to resolve those issues as well.

24:56.880 --> 25:01.640
And the fact that's even on their radar as something to be concerned about, I think really

25:01.640 --> 25:07.460
shows you how the world of software has changed, and how open source has really made an impact

25:07.460 --> 25:08.460
everywhere.

25:08.460 --> 25:10.240
Like, that's a massive milestone to me.

25:10.240 --> 25:11.520
Oh, it definitely is.

25:11.520 --> 25:14.160
But let's not get too ahead of ourselves here.

25:14.160 --> 25:18.200
We're not talking about Linux necessarily, and certainly not Linux on the desktop.

25:18.200 --> 25:22.720
I'm sure that all the people who are involved with this will have been talking to each other

25:22.720 --> 25:26.320
and posting these press releases from their Macs.

25:26.320 --> 25:31.840
Oh, Joe, always bringing it back home.

25:31.840 --> 25:32.840
You got to be right.

25:32.840 --> 25:34.640
I mean, I'm sure you are right.

25:34.640 --> 25:37.800
The reality is, at the end of the day, there's still open source code getting used, there's

25:37.800 --> 25:39.080
still software getting made.

25:39.080 --> 25:40.240
I think that's still a good thing.

25:40.240 --> 25:43.960
If they want to open up a terminal from their Mac and necessitate another Linux box to do

25:43.960 --> 25:48.080
it, or if they just want to build and run it locally on their Mac, you know what?

25:48.080 --> 25:49.160
I'm happy.

25:49.160 --> 25:50.160
Makes me happy.

25:50.160 --> 25:52.820
I think this is a good move, and I like to see the Linux Foundation doing these kinds

25:52.820 --> 25:56.260
of things where it's not going to be a massive amount of overhead for them.

25:56.260 --> 26:00.680
It's sort of already in their core focus, and it's an obvious area that needs some help.

26:00.680 --> 26:03.080
Yeah, not to mention all that Hollywood cash.

26:03.080 --> 26:07.760
