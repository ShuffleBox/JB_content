00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,820
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, our weekly take on Linux and the open source world.

2
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:20,500
This is episode 75, recorded on October 14th, 2018.

3
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:21,500
I'm Chris.

4
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:22,500
And I'm Tom.

5
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:23,500
Hello, Joe.

6
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:27,180
It's good to be connected with you, and I smell a fork of brew, and we'll get to that

7
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:28,180
in a little bit.

8
00:00:28,180 --> 00:00:33,680
There's a ton of news this week to jump into, so let's start with the highlight of the week.

9
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:38,920
It's perhaps Linux's best Android alternative, Ubuntu Touch, and they have a brand new release.

10
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:43,500
Yeah, OTA-5 has been released, hot on the heels of OTA-4.

11
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:47,560
And if you look at the release notes, you'd be forgiven for thinking, hang on, isn't this

12
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:50,040
the same deal as OTA-4?

13
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:54,040
The major feature is that it's based on Ubuntu 16.04 rather than 15.04.

14
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:55,560
Yeah, that's how I read it.

15
00:00:55,560 --> 00:01:00,640
Yeah, well, I spoke to Dalton from the project about this today, and he told me that with

16
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:04,240
OTA-4, it wasn't kind of an automatic upgrade.

17
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:09,880
You had to manually do that yourself if you were running an older version, whereas now

18
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:13,160
with OTA-5, it is being offered to people.

19
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:15,500
It is kind of an automatic upgrade.

20
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:17,700
It's not opt-in, if you know what I mean.

21
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:23,940
So it was almost like a soft launch with OTA-4, but now it's for real.

22
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:29,120
They are confident in their 16.04 version, and they're calling it solid.

23
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:30,700
Okay, I mean, that's good to hear.

24
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:35,720
And for those that don't recall or don't follow closely enough, the phone images are an LTS

25
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:36,720
behind.

26
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:37,720
That's standard.

27
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:38,720
Yeah.

28
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:39,720
So they're not technically behind as far as the phone releases go.

29
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:40,720
This is right on target.

30
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:44,600
There's a couple of new features, though, that snuck into OTA-5 that I think are kind

31
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:45,600
of cool.

32
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:49,440
I think probably the one that's the most user-facing is going to be that Morph browser.

33
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:51,580
I guess their old browser, was it called browser?

34
00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:53,500
And they're getting rid of that.

35
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:56,700
And they have a new one that's based on the Qt Web Engine technology.

36
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:57,700
And that is called Morph.

37
00:01:57,700 --> 00:02:03,840
And the reason it's called that is because it has support for Qt's automatic screen scaling.

38
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:08,800
So you can come in with a very small display, a very large display, and it'll display an

39
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:13,320
optimal size for that form factor for the web browser, which also means how the page

40
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:15,400
gets rendered in the web browser.

41
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:18,640
And this guy is based on a more recent version of the Chromium base, too.

42
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:20,600
So it seems like Morph is a pretty solid addition.

43
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:26,840
Yeah, it was available before as a browser-ng, I presume, next generation.

44
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:31,680
But it wasn't quite ready, and that's why they didn't ship it by default, whereas the

45
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:38,040
old browser was just crusty and broken, and a lot of things didn't render properly.

46
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:41,080
So this was a key issue for them to fix.

47
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:44,480
And that's why it's kind of the headline feature, really.

48
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:48,320
There's a feature in here that only a community project like this would have.

49
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:55,840
Big Apple and Google would never do this, and it's user-submitted backgrounds and audio

50
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:56,840
creations.

51
00:02:56,840 --> 00:03:02,080
So you've got wallpapers and also notification tones and ringtones that are going to be included

52
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:04,840
in this OTA image that were created by the community.

53
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:06,400
And I bet you some of those are pretty neat.

54
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:10,560
I'd almost want to flash this on a device if I had one that worked still.

55
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:15,440
My Nexus device finally this weekend kicked the bucket and now just boot loops on me,

56
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:17,240
and I don't know what I did wrong.

57
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:22,640
So my play device has died, but if I had one I could try this on, I would definitely go

58
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:23,640
check out those tones.

59
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:27,360
And I don't know, I'm just saying maybe save them for future use.

60
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,800
I bet I could fix that Nexus for you.

61
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:30,800
You think so?

62
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:31,800
I don't know if it'd be worth shipping it to you, though.

63
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:35,080
Yeah, it's a long way, but I reckon I could have a go.

64
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:37,760
Yeah, you do have a knack for fixing those boot loops.

65
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:40,280
I guess you've run into it a few times.

66
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:45,680
So another release this week was Plasma 5.14, which presumably you have been rocking and

67
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:46,680
enjoying.

68
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:47,680
Me?

69
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:48,680
Nah.

70
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:49,680
Couldn't be bothered, Joe.

71
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:50,680
Not excited.

72
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:51,680
No, I'm kidding.

73
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,760
I actually had it installed before the release announcement was out.

74
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:56,480
I'm very much liking Plasma 5.14.

75
00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:00,320
I'll kind of go into one thing that's probably the big headline feature, and that is that

76
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:06,200
Discover, which is Plasma's software manager, among other things, has now added a firmware

77
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:12,120
update feature that uses LVFS, which we talk about quite frequently, and FW Update Demon

78
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:17,640
under the hood to update the firmware of your Linux boxes, which was something that could

79
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:21,060
only be done via the GUI under GNOME software before.

80
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:22,540
And so now Discover has shipped this feature.

81
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:25,180
I have used it, and so far it's worked well.

82
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:27,800
And are you using Wayland with it then?

83
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:30,120
No, I have not made that switch yet.

84
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:34,680
I don't really plan to until Neon makes that switch or Kubuntu makes that switch.

85
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:39,360
Okay, fair enough, because they have landed some fixes for Wayland, specifically copy

86
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:43,120
paste between GTK and non-GTK apps.

87
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:48,340
That would be very attractive to me because I don't think that if I did make the switch

88
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:50,880
that I could make the switch completely to Qt applications.

89
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:53,280
I'd need to use a few GTK applications at least.

90
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:57,920
Yeah, I think you asked on User Air this week, which if you are out there listening, going,

91
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:00,400
why is everybody talking about Plasma?

92
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:06,680
It's worth checking out User Air 50, air.show slash 50, because they talk about this, Dan,

93
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:13,080
Poppy, and Joe here, and I think the key point that was brought up, a lot of work over the

94
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:19,680
years has gone into making GTK and Qt applications look fine on the respective desktops.

95
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:24,460
And under Plasma, there are specific settings where you can go in and choose what GTK theme

96
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:29,360
you want apps to use, and there's one that makes it essentially look like breeze apps.

97
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,640
And there's also a breeze dark option, which is the one I use.

98
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:34,400
So basically all my apps kind of look the same.

99
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:39,520
You really kind of have to be an expert on Qt widgets versus GTK widgets to know which

100
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:40,720
one you're actually looking at.

101
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:45,800
Well, you mentioned the Plasma Discover, the software center type application and how that's

102
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:48,080
had some improvements.

103
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:50,420
One of the big ones is support for snap channels.

104
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:56,160
So now you can have the betas and the bleeding edge stuff if you want, as well as the stable,

105
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,560
which is a pretty big deal.

106
00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:03,280
Yeah, especially since this week, they just launched the Plex server as a snap, and that's

107
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:06,760
in the beta channel right now because it's a beta version of the Plex server.

108
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:08,820
When stable comes out, it'll be in the stable channel.

109
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:12,720
So having a software manager that understands the differences between these channels is

110
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,760
more important than ever right now for some of us.

111
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:18,040
Yeah, although would you be running a Plex server with a GUI?

112
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:21,600
I suppose maybe if it's an old laptop that you want to do a couple of other things with.

113
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:27,580
No, you know what I actually do it is on, I have a monster workstation that is, well,

114
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:32,000
by my standards, back when we built it, it was like six cores and 64 gigs of RAM and

115
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,960
tons of disks in there that I just slice off a little bit of that running Plex because

116
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:39,320
that thing runs 24-7, and I don't even sit down at 24-7.

117
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:41,240
Okay, fair enough.

118
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:42,720
But it's not just snaps, is it?

119
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:45,520
It's also flat pack support has been improved now.

120
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:46,520
Right.

121
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:49,360
This is a handy feature that they've added where if you try to install a flat pack, instead

122
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:54,000
of just getting an error message that tells you to go fish, they will ask you if you would

123
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,760
like to install the flat pack backend that you need to support flat packs, a nice addition

124
00:06:58,760 --> 00:06:59,760
there.

125
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:03,840
The other just really quick, nice quality of life improvements, if you do presentations

126
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:07,920
at work, or you're hooking up to external displays, they have a display configuration

127
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:11,800
widget that comes up on your screen now that choose really common layouts or go right to

128
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:15,580
advanced display settings as soon as it detects that new display connected.

129
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:16,580
That's nice.

130
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:20,580
But the other thing that I was really happy to see is something that used to be in Plasma

131
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:26,280
ages ago is back, and that is support for SSH VPN tunnels right there in the network

132
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:27,280
manager.

133
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:30,600
You just click a button and you have an SSH VPN tunnel.

134
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:31,600
It's pretty gorgeous.

135
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:35,560
Yeah, all in all, this seems to be yet another solid release from the KDE team, doesn't it?

136
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:38,080
Yeah, really consistent, nice improvements.

137
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:42,200
They've been nailing it release after release for a while now, and I think that's contributing

138
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:43,920
to a lot of attention there.

139
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:47,600
I'd say the future for Plasma desktop looks really good.

140
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:50,800
You mentioned the Wayland support that they're working on.

141
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:56,080
Now we're getting down to refinement things, copying and pasting between Qt and GTK applications,

142
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:59,600
and we're working on refining our support for these universal installer formats that

143
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:02,000
are shipping and becoming more and more common.

144
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,880
As major applications are shipped as flat packs or snaps, there is a real need to have

145
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:10,200
good support in the software manager for the desktop environment.

146
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:15,720
I think 5.14 is another really good release in a long run of good releases.

147
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:20,380
Yeah, it's easy to kind of imagine that everyone installs software like we do with the command

148
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:23,300
line, but I think the reality is that most people don't, do they?

149
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:25,120
They actually do use the GUI.

150
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:30,720
That's why it's really important for GUI software managers to get this support.

151
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:34,200
I agree, and I have seen it over and over again when I sit somebody down with Linux

152
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:38,880
for the first time, and they go get whatever that app is that isn't in the repo, Spotify

153
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:45,960
or Chrome or whatever it is, and they download a dab or an RPM, and they double click it,

154
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:50,720
and the software store or the software manager launches, and it's this massively complicated

155
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:54,640
piece of software, and that is their experience of installing these things right now.

156
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:59,080
So as they streamline this stuff and they make it automatically install flat pack backend

157
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:03,520
type stuff, it makes that first user experience when you download that RPM or a dab or that

158
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:08,960
flat pack file now a lot more straightforward, a lot clearer, and it eventually works and

159
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:12,520
gets your software loaded and installed, which is not necessarily the case right now.

160
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:15,760
Well, the question is, should you be installing flat packs?

161
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:20,800
Certainly not according to a new website that popped up this week called flatkill.org.

162
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:24,120
Little dramatic in its URL and in its stance.

163
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:27,400
Red Hat's flat pack has been getting a lot of attention lately, right?

164
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:31,840
It's the self-proclaimed new way of distributing desktop applications on Linux.

165
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:33,880
It's secure, they say.

166
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:38,820
And then it goes in to really kind of tear up flat packs, calls the sandbox a lie, says

167
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:43,320
folks aren't getting the proper security updates that they need and they're left vulnerable.

168
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:44,680
It takes a strong stance.

169
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:48,400
It says that Red Hat developers don't care about security.

170
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:50,440
There's some claims in here, Joe.

171
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:56,240
Yeah, and on the surface of it, it seems to be almost justified, really.

172
00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:02,160
There's a fair bit of evidence to support these ideas that flat packs are not a great

173
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:03,760
idea.

174
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:10,600
But then when you really kind of step back from it, you realize that almost all of what

175
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:16,920
is being said on this website is not necessarily a criticism of flat pack as a technology.

176
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:21,000
It's more how flat packs are being implemented at the moment.

177
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,400
That I think is the crux of the issue right there.

178
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:26,560
He really doesn't have a case against flat packs.

179
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,920
The issues are he or she pulls out.

180
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:33,940
We tried to do a little digging and they've taken steps to hide their identity.

181
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:39,320
They call out things like VS Code or Android Studio and Sublime Text, which are using unpatched

182
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:42,880
versions of Git, version 2.93.

183
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:49,460
Also they note that flat packs PyCharm comes with Git 2.19.0, which are vulnerable to a

184
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:50,920
known exploit out there.

185
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:55,080
So that's the case for saying that flat packs are insecure, is that some of the applications,

186
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:58,920
like some of the larger ones like VS Code, are shipping with known vulnerabilities.

187
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:04,200
In fact, one of the applications actually includes a method that someone could use to

188
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,860
gain root access.

189
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:10,240
So in one case, there's an application where you could follow a chain of exploits and get

190
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:13,680
root access via a flat pack application.

191
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:17,720
That's the crux of the argument here, but that comes down to how developers are or are

192
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:19,280
not packaging their software.

193
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:25,480
And I think what it betrays is a weakness in the universal packaging system.

194
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:32,840
And that is when volunteers package these applications, like say VS Code or Steam or

195
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:40,400
Audacity or VLC, they are not in sync with each individual release and necessarily tracking

196
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:42,840
all of the components that are in that flat pack.

197
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:48,760
I think that's why whenever possible, we really need developers packaging their own applications,

198
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:49,760
not volunteers.

199
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:52,900
It needs to be integrated into their build and deployment methodologies.

200
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:57,440
But some developers are not interested in distributing their software like this.

201
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:02,840
And so then you have this problem of, well, if the developer doesn't want to distribute

202
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:08,160
it, then we can because it is free software and the license allows you to do so.

203
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:12,080
And that's when you end up with volunteers doing it and then maybe stepping away and

204
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:16,080
not keeping up, as you said, with the various security fixes and everything.

205
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:20,720
These arguments have been made against applications in the Debian repository before.

206
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:24,660
It is a software packaging issue, especially when it's volunteer based.

207
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:28,500
And I think the answer there is that's Red Hat's problem to solve, frankly.

208
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:32,600
If they're the primary sponsor of this project, then they're the ones that need to do that

209
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:33,600
outreach.

210
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:37,720
I don't think Plex just fell out of the cloud into a Snap.

211
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:43,720
And in fact, I was physically there when the Plex folks met the Snap team because it was

212
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:45,400
at an event in Seattle.

213
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:47,440
I had a great conversation with this individual.

214
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:50,800
I learned that they are shipping Plex on Linux based systems.

215
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:57,000
I had no idea because of the embedded market and all kinds of weird architectural issues

216
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,860
and packaging issues.

217
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:00,440
And Snap really solves that problem for them.

218
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:04,880
So it's lucky for us that we get to run it on desktop Linux, but it solves something

219
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:08,920
like, and this is just from our private conversation that, so these are just my guesses and I'm

220
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:13,360
changing the names to protect the innocent, but something like 15 different types of packages

221
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:14,560
that they create.

222
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:18,660
And they have a very, very complicated series of scripts that generate each one of those

223
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:20,560
individual packages.

224
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:27,120
And it took a corporate meeting where Canonical sponsored a sprint event and invited local

225
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,120
partners to come.

226
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:33,040
And it took a face-to-face where they started talking about the problems at Plex of targeting

227
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:37,620
these 15 different types of packaging formats and how the Windows and Mac guys have to laugh

228
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:41,560
over the fence as I'm sitting there creating a new script to target the next NAS that shipped

229
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:42,640
this week.

230
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:47,360
When the Canonical team could hear that particular need, they were able to begin a conversation

231
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:50,840
saying, well, you know, Snaps can actually solve that problem and we could add the support

232
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:53,600
for these architecture requirements that you have.

233
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:54,600
And we could just put that upstream.

234
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:59,080
Although it does go to show that these things take time because that sprint was months ago,

235
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:00,080
wasn't it?

236
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:01,080
Beginning of the year.

237
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:02,080
Yeah.

238
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:03,080
Yeah.

239
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:05,240
We've only had this Plex Snap this week.

240
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:08,400
And so it's not trivial for some of these applications.

241
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:10,480
This is what Red Hat's got to start doing though.

242
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:15,320
They've got to start making these relationships and the end users are the ones that suffer

243
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:16,720
if the packages don't get updated.

244
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:20,580
Now there also could be, you know, developer awareness that could be raised, but these

245
00:14:20,580 --> 00:14:23,380
core issues are nothing new.

246
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:25,560
They happen on the Mac in DMG files.

247
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:27,920
They've happened in Debian repositories before.

248
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:29,640
They happen on Windows machines all the time.

249
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:33,000
You install something with the install wizard and it blasts a whole bunch of old DLLs on

250
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,240
your box.

251
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:37,280
This is a common problem.

252
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:40,080
And if it's not solved at the source, we're generally playing catch up.

253
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:43,720
Well, you mentioned a fork at the top of the show and you were talking about Redis and

254
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:49,360
specifically some modules that have been forked, but who has forked them is pretty interesting.

255
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:54,880
You won't be too surprised when I say it's the Debian Linux project leader and the Fedora

256
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:55,880
developer.

257
00:14:55,880 --> 00:15:00,120
So this is Chris Lam and Nathan Scott, and they're concerned that these changes to the

258
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:05,320
Redis modules are going to make it so that they can't distribute Redis in Fedora or Debian.

259
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:09,100
They write with recent licensing changes to several Redis Labs modules, making them no

260
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:14,440
longer free and open source, GNU slash Linux distributions such as Debian and Fedora are

261
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:20,120
no longer able to ship Redis Labs versions of the affected modules to their users.

262
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:25,600
As a result, we have begun working together to create a set of module repositories forked

263
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:28,760
from the code prior to the license change.

264
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:34,120
We will maintain changes to these modules under their original open source licenses,

265
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:37,800
applying only free and open fixes and updates.

266
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:44,000
Now it is worth noting that these modules have not become proprietary, completely proprietary.

267
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,320
It's a little bit more nuanced than that.

268
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:50,960
What has happened is Redis have decided that they don't want people to take their code

269
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:57,160
and make money from it, so they've added what they call the commons clause, which basically

270
00:15:57,160 --> 00:16:00,960
just says you can do whatever you want, you can have all the usual freedoms of free and

271
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:04,000
open source software, but you just can't make money from it.

272
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:08,520
Yeah, which if you think about all those Debian or Fedora installs that are up in maybe like

273
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:13,220
a web server instance or even used inside a company as a database server so that way

274
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:18,320
they can work on things and make a profit, it is not only a non-starter for those work

275
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:22,320
cases, but it's restricting the freedom of the application.

276
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:29,440
And this really seems targeted at companies like AWS, which were trying to build services

277
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:33,000
around some of this software and then charge handsome fees.

278
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,800
And I think Redis looked at that and thought, wait a minute, we should be the ones, we should

279
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:36,800
be the ones making that money.

280
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:38,380
That's our software.

281
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:40,160
That's my, that's my into it of it.

282
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:41,520
I don't know if that's true or not.

283
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:45,220
Yeah, but that's not how free and open source software works.

284
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:48,360
The license is no longer OSI compliant.

285
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:52,960
And that means that distros like Debian and Fedora just can't distribute it anymore.

286
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:57,120
This could have larger upstream ramifications on Ubuntu cloud servers as well.

287
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:00,840
Well, thanks to these forks, hopefully that is going to solve the problem.

288
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:02,240
Yeah, you're probably right.

289
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:07,880
And I'm interested to see the results of the Debian project leader, Chris Lam, and the

290
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:10,760
Fedora contributor, Nathan Scott, working together.

291
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:14,160
That seems like maybe that could produce other interesting results down the road.

292
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,960
Yeah, that is good to see them working together.

293
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:21,680
And something else that's good to see, I think, is Microsoft joining the Open Invention Network,

294
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:23,460
the biggest news of the week.

295
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:24,460
No doubt about it.

296
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:25,460
I think there's no think about it either.

297
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:28,360
I think this is absolutely good news.

298
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:32,380
Microsoft writes that they know their decision to join the OIN may be viewed as surprising

299
00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:33,380
to some.

300
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:34,380
Just a bit.

301
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:35,380
Yeah.

302
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:36,440
Let's just take a moment and soak that one.

303
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:40,480
And they say it's no secret that there's been friction in the past between Microsoft and

304
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:44,080
the open source community over the issue of patents.

305
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:47,480
For others who have followed our evolution, we hope this announcement will be viewed as

306
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:51,920
the next logical step for a company that is listening to customers and developers and

307
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:55,860
firmly committed to Linux and other open source programs.

308
00:17:55,860 --> 00:18:01,080
That is a remarkable statement by Microsoft, and this is undoubtedly a good contribution.

309
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:05,120
I think for context, it would be good to keep track of what this is and isn't.

310
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:10,120
The Open Innovation Network now has about 2,600 members, and Microsoft is the biggest

311
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:13,040
fish in the pond when it comes to patents that they've contributed.

312
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:15,160
It's a huge win for them.

313
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:21,120
In a bit of an irony, OIN was launched in 2005 as a company that was going to protect

314
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:25,560
development around Linux from companies like Microsoft, SCO, and others.

315
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:29,360
So there's, I think, a bit of an irony to this that they're joining a group that may

316
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:32,840
in part have started as a defense to Microsoft.

317
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:39,560
So this decision means that by joining OIN, Microsoft agrees not to use any of its 60,000

318
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:45,960
patents against other OIN participants for their use or distribution of the, quote, Linux

319
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:50,460
system technologies, which is defined by the OIN as a specific thing.

320
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:56,040
It's a set of libraries, Kubernetes is in there, part of Chromium is in there.

321
00:18:56,040 --> 00:19:00,540
So there's several core technologies in there that are in this Linux system definition that

322
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:03,520
is now protected by all members of the Open Innovation Network.

323
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:07,520
And then just kind of lastly here, the other thing to probably understand about this decision

324
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:14,680
is Microsoft's participation in the OIN does not limit Microsoft's ability to assert its

325
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:18,720
patents against non-OIN participants.

326
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:24,320
So that means people outside the Open Innovation Network are not necessarily protected by this.

327
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:29,440
Although it would be bad form and probably not go well in their new club here, it is

328
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:34,960
by the letter of the law legal, even if they're using something that's in this Linux system

329
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:36,680
definition.

330
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:39,940
If they're not in the OIN network, Microsoft could still go after them.

331
00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:43,200
So it doesn't necessarily mean they're going to stop going after certain Android manufacturers

332
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,200
for ex-fat patents.

333
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:49,400
Well, Android was the first word that came to my mind when I read about this.

334
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:52,020
Microsoft make an awful lot of money from Android.

335
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:58,280
So by doing this, if they really are going to stop making money from Android like this,

336
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:03,800
then they're cutting off a massive revenue source, which seems pretty unlikely to me.

337
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:08,620
And the Free Software Foundation made a statement about Microsoft joining the OIN.

338
00:20:08,620 --> 00:20:10,680
And that was the first thing that they want to know.

339
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:16,200
They want Microsoft to make a clear, unambiguous statement that it has ceased all patent infringement

340
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:20,180
claims on the use of Linux and Android.

341
00:20:20,180 --> 00:20:26,120
And that's why I was sort of slightly questioning whether this is good news or not, because

342
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:29,120
they technically don't have to do that, do they?

343
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:33,960
As you said, I think it would be a bad look for them if they didn't do it.

344
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:37,480
But it just seems almost impossible that they could do that, because there's so much revenue

345
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:38,480
coming in from Android.

346
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:41,400
I have a couple of thoughts on that.

347
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:47,200
This doesn't really, I think, detract from how good of news this is, because an argument

348
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:51,280
could be made that that is Microsoft's legitimate intellectual properties, and these Android

349
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:54,800
manufacturers took a shortcut, and they used something that they should have checked.

350
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:57,300
Their legal department should have checked for that.

351
00:20:57,300 --> 00:21:00,200
And it's not really Microsoft's fault that they decided to use exFAT, so that way they

352
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:03,600
could make it really easy to copy files to a Windows box.

353
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:07,000
So there may be an argument to say they're justified in charging those manufacturers.

354
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:11,440
It is probably one of their biggest PR issues with the open source community.

355
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:17,280
But this is, overall, undoubtedly good news, because it means that the technologies that

356
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:19,900
are included in this are now going to be essentially safe.

357
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:25,520
It would be a futile effort to go after some small shop that uses anything in this Linux

358
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:27,800
system definition now.

359
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:31,920
And likely any company that's of any reasonable size would have connections to members in

360
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:33,280
the OIN.

361
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:37,520
And undoubtedly, on top of that, membership of the Open Innovation Network is going to

362
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:38,520
skyrocket now.

363
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:44,000
Now that Microsoft's 60,000 patents are in there, it's worth it, and it's free to join.

364
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,840
So there's really no downside for a lot of companies.

365
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:48,520
I imagine that 2600 number is going to get a lot higher.

366
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:49,760
Oh, yeah.

367
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:54,640
But something else that the FSF points out is that Microsoft could completely withdraw

368
00:21:54,640 --> 00:22:00,780
from the Open Innovation Network with only 30 days notice, which, again, seems unlikely

369
00:22:00,780 --> 00:22:04,160
and would be a terrible look for them, PR-wise.

370
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:06,480
But it is possible it could happen.

371
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:10,400
I do follow the Free Software Foundation's core point there, but I kind of feel like

372
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:14,840
they're playing this patent revenue thing up as the anti-Microsoft angle here.

373
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:20,200
I think all of the hype around how much money Microsoft makes off of Android came off of

374
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:27,120
an article that came out March 5, 2014, and the headline was, Microsoft makes $5 to $15

375
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:28,720
from every Android device sold.

376
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:34,720
And that exploded, and the estimation was that they likely make $2 billion per year

377
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:35,720
from Android.

378
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:37,280
And this is back in 2014.

379
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:41,880
I think the logical error that people are making is to assume that that revenue has

380
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:43,060
increased.

381
00:22:43,060 --> 00:22:46,880
There was additional follow-up stories in 2016 and 2017.

382
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:50,900
I haven't seen much about it recently that actually talked about Microsoft's earning

383
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:56,320
reports being slightly down in some cases because they weren't making as much from patent

384
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:57,320
licensing.

385
00:22:57,320 --> 00:23:03,400
In 2016, revenue from Android patent licensing was down 26% from a year ago.

386
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:08,040
So really, for all we know, the revenue may have already been on the decline as Android

387
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:12,840
manufacturers updated their handsets with software that didn't use the patented technology.

388
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:16,980
Well, that would explain it, wouldn't it, that if they're not making that much revenue

389
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:22,040
and that revenue is declining, then it's not as big of a deal as it would have been several

390
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:23,040
years ago.

391
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:27,120
Yeah, I mean, let's just say for sake of argument, it's $900 million or it's a billion dollars.

392
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:33,440
Is it worth Microsoft's time and effort and energy to spend a billion dollars investing

393
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:36,440
in developers to use Azure?

394
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:37,440
I think it might be.

395
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:42,120
I think since Azure is really the future of the company, spending some money on patent

396
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:48,640
revenue to encourage developers to use the core technologies that power Azure is a win

397
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:49,640
for them.

398
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:53,600
Well, they must have obviously done the maths and the accountants probably agree with you.

399
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:58,280
We'll have to watch and see if anything is stated though about that Android patent revenue

400
00:23:58,280 --> 00:24:01,180
because that's really the sticking point for a lot of people.

401
00:24:01,180 --> 00:24:04,000
The Software Freedom Conservancy came out and made the same concern too.

402
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,800
They had essentially a similar point.

403
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:09,620
We may see Microsoft make an official statement.

404
00:24:09,620 --> 00:24:13,620
Either way, I think people shouldn't get hung up on that one particular thing.

405
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:18,100
What lawyers figure out in the back rooms of really boring buildings is really of no

406
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:22,780
concern to us because the practical matter is 60,000 really important patents are now

407
00:24:22,780 --> 00:24:27,720
available to a network that is specifically set up to protect Linux and some of the core

408
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:30,160
technologies around it from patent trolls.

409
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:31,160
That's massive.

410
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:32,160
Yeah, you're right.

411
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:35,800
Even if it turns out that they are going to continue to make money off Android, it's still

412
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:37,480
ultimately good news.

413
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:41,820
They're scrambling busy over there, but I have reached out to a couple of contacts at

414
00:24:41,820 --> 00:24:45,520
Microsoft and I invited them to come on Linux Unplugged to talk to us more to answer some

415
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:46,520
of this stuff.

416
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:50,440
I don't know if they can because they're traveling and whatnot, but we may have somebody on Linux

417
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:51,440
Unplugged to talk about it.

418
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:52,960
I look forward to that.

419
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:53,960
All right.

420
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:57,240
Well, let's end with some Google news.

421
00:24:57,240 --> 00:25:03,240
They had their event this week announcing the new phones and some boring stuff, but

422
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:08,880
what jumped out at me was the Pixel Slate, which is the first Chrome OS tablet.

423
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:12,720
You know, at first I didn't get it because I watched the thing live and I'm like, um,

424
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:14,760
so they've totally reskinned Chrome OS.

425
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:20,080
It looks like a totally different OS with a, um, it looks a lot like Plasma actually

426
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:21,720
now that I'm looking at the pictures.

427
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:22,720
Holy crap.

428
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:25,200
Uh, and it's called the Slate Joe, not a tablet.

429
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:26,960
Don't, don't get that confused.

430
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:31,880
They say the biggest feature of this really is a full desktop web browser on a tablet.

431
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:36,040
That's I think what they've built this thing around, eighth gen Intel processor.

432
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:40,960
It can go up to an i7 with 16 gigs of RAM and 256 gigs of storage.

433
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:46,520
It's got a 12.3 inch touch screen that Google says is faster and more efficient than traditional

434
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:47,520
LCDs.

435
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:52,000
It also includes, which is kind of a neat addition, a fingerprint sensor, which is built

436
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,120
into the power button.

437
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:56,780
This is a first for Chromebooks and kind of an interesting way to do it without having

438
00:25:56,780 --> 00:25:58,600
like a traditional button down the front.

439
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:04,460
Oh, and that screen, that 12.3 inch screen is 3000 by 2000 resolution, which is an interesting

440
00:26:04,460 --> 00:26:05,800
aspect ratio.

441
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:11,440
And the thing weighs 1.6 pounds and the hands-on reviewers have all said it's really well balanced.

442
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:14,320
You can hold it with one finger in the middle and it stays there.

443
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:16,140
It's beautifully balanced.

444
00:26:16,140 --> 00:26:20,240
This is clearly going after the iPad Pro market because it's that kind of size, isn't it?

445
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:24,800
It's a huge tablet and don't call it a tablet, whatever.

446
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:26,820
And it's all about productivity.

447
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:28,920
It's not a media consumption device.

448
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:36,440
It's supposed to be almost like a laptop replacement, but I don't know, don't Apple have that market

449
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:38,520
sewn up already?

450
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:43,440
Isn't this kind of going after a market that is just not going to go for it?

451
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:47,000
Because to get the powerful one is very expensive here.

452
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,480
Yeah, but so is the iPad Pro.

453
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:54,200
You get the big iPad Pro with the full storage and LTE and you're paying these prices easy.

454
00:26:54,200 --> 00:27:00,280
I think, you know, funny, I first didn't get this device, but now it's actually on my consideration

455
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:04,040
list and it's up against the iPad Pro.

456
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:09,080
I've kind of just, I've soured on running a dozen Electron apps to do all of my work

457
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:10,080
communication.

458
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:15,240
You know, I have mail spring running, I have Slack running, I have all kinds of like esoteric

459
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:20,800
messaging apps that are all available as apps on the iOS app store that I think would just

460
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:24,800
be better running on a tablet than running on my Linux box and just free my Linux box

461
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:25,800
of some of those tasks.

462
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:27,840
And some of the mail clients are fantastic.

463
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:32,040
So kind of been thinking, yeah, maybe I get an iPad and do my communication on that instead

464
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:33,040
of the laptop.

465
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:34,520
Didn't love the idea though.

466
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:38,280
Then this thing comes around, it's in that iPad Pro price range.

467
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:43,120
And if you're in the Google suite, so you work for a company that's all in on G apps,

468
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:44,960
this might be a better device to use.

469
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:45,960
Yeah.

470
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:50,160
And don't forget of course that you can run Android apps to some extent and you can run

471
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:52,400
Linux apps to some extent.

472
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:55,080
So it's kind of an attractive proposition.

473
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:57,100
What would potentially sell me on this?

474
00:27:57,100 --> 00:28:01,200
First of all, it'd have to be significantly less expensive, but also if you could run

475
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:06,160
proper GNU slash Linux on it, if you could hack it and there's no indication yet whether

476
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:08,000
that is going to be possible.

477
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,400
What about that new Chrome OS feature just to run Linux apps?

478
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:11,560
Is that good enough?

479
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:12,560
Not for me.

480
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:17,680
I mean, that is attractive, but I'd like to be able to install Xubuntu on it.

481
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:19,800
It's the bottom line and use it.

482
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:21,800
Of course you would.

483
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:23,600
On that screen, Joe.

484
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:24,600
You masochist.

485
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:26,080
I don't know.

486
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:29,920
Maybe plasma or something instead, but you know, proper GNU slash Linux rather than Chrome

487
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:31,200
OS.

488
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:34,960
And okay, Chrome OS has now grown to a point where it's not just a web browser like it

489
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:39,920
was before, but it's still quite limited, even with Android app support, even with the

490
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:41,560
next app support.

491
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:45,160
It's not a proper Linux system, is it, as we know it.

492
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:49,480
And the specs of this, you know, if you've got an i7 with 16 gigs of RAM, there's absolutely

493
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:56,000
no reason why you couldn't run a plasma desktop on there or GNOME or anything and have a proper

494
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,580
experience.

495
00:28:57,580 --> 00:29:01,640
And I think GNOME would actually be far more suited to it because it's kind of touch centric

496
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:06,480
and GNOME is really good with touch input, but it does need a fair bit of grunt in terms

497
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:07,480
of resources.

498
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:13,640
I mean, I've got a really old Windows 8 tablet that I installed Linux on just to see if I

499
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:14,640
could do it.

500
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:18,520
And GNOME works really well in terms of the touch and the keyboard comes up and everything,

501
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:23,480
but that tablet is just not powerful enough to run it, whereas this Pixel Slate, I think,

502
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:24,960
would be well powerful enough.

503
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:25,960
Oh, for sure.

504
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:27,280
Yeah, I think so.

505
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:29,560
Yeah, there's a couple of red flags for me.

506
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:34,600
The price is a little higher than I'm comfortable with a Chrome device, especially one that

507
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:37,000
is essentially a first gen.

508
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,280
This has a new UI on top of it.

509
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:43,880
And when I watched several of the hands on videos, in a couple of them, the UI is laggy

510
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:47,180
as they're like doing the screen splitting and moving apps around.

511
00:29:47,180 --> 00:29:50,440
It actually is a little laggy and that's a little concerning for a device that could

512
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:51,440
be up to nearly $1,600.

513
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:55,840
The other thing to understand is the keyboard is sold separately for $200.

514
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:58,640
And then if you want to get the fancy pen, that's another $100.

515
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:04,000
So you're way in on cost here and it's a brand new take on this.

516
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:09,340
It does really seem, though, from what a lot of reviewers have said, that Google has internalized

517
00:30:09,340 --> 00:30:13,800
a lot of the lessons of the Pixel phones and they've brought that to the tablet and they've

518
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:17,040
made hardware-wise a very great device.

519
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:21,020
So some of that stuff could get cleaned up with software updates, which are pretty smooth

520
00:30:21,020 --> 00:30:22,960
on Chrome devices.

521
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:27,200
But the thing I'm surprised you haven't mentioned yet is they dropped the headphone jack.

522
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:30,040
Oh yeah, of course.

523
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:32,520
Did you catch their rationalization?

524
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:37,160
It hasn't been printed a lot, but the rationalization goes like this.

525
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:45,840
Mobile phones have removed the headphone jack, which has created a robust Bluetooth ecosystem.

526
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:52,280
So that made it easy for them to remove the headphone port from the tablet because users

527
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:57,480
have already bought all these Bluetooth accessories as a result of these mobile phone changes.

528
00:30:57,480 --> 00:31:01,080
As someone who uses Bluetooth every day, I can tell you this.

529
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:06,720
Bluetooth is terrible and removing the headphone jack is the worst thing that's happened to

530
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:10,800
tech for as long as I can remember.

531
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:16,680
Even Samsung now are looking at removing it and so it seems that it's just going away.

532
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:18,600
Within a couple of years, we're not going to have it anymore.

533
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:24,080
And I've ranted about this many times on various different shows, but the ability to be able

534
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:30,560
to have my Bluetooth device die battery wise and then just unplug my headphones, plug them

535
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:35,560
into the phone or the laptop or whatever, it's just invaluable.

536
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:40,400
And Bluetooth, okay, Bluetooth can get better or whatever, but just there's nothing quite

537
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:42,520
like plugging in a headphone jack is there.

538
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:44,240
I do miss it from time to time.

539
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:48,920
I do adapt over time, but I thought it was interesting to see them make this transition

540
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:53,400
on a tablet level because this is doing a little bit more of a desktop role where there's

541
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:56,760
a lot of other reasons to have a headphone jack, including just trying to be polite when

542
00:31:56,760 --> 00:32:00,840
you're in a workspace and you're listening or watching something.

543
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:02,960
I think it's one to watch.

544
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:07,880
I don't know if it's one to buy yet, but I was surprised at how close they got.

545
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:12,640
Once I put myself in the head of a G Suite user who's perhaps using several of the Google

546
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:16,840
apps for work every day, I could actually see this thing being pretty useful and it

547
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:22,400
would be handy to have a desktop grade web browser on a tablet.

548
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:27,120
And I think Google needed to make this because the iPad Pro is eating up this market from

549
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:31,880
one end and the Microsoft Surface line is eating up the other end, the higher end.

550
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:33,760
So Google needed to respond to this.

551
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:38,880
And also I think one last note, just interesting that this isn't running Android, it's running

552
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:43,800
Chrome OS and when Google was asked about that, their response was, this is where we're

553
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:44,960
investing now.

554
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:48,360
As in, we're done making Android tablets.

555
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:53,760
Well official prediction, this is not going to sell well and the other side of Christmas,

556
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:57,920
say by Easter, you'll be able to pick these up for half the price that they are now.

557
00:32:57,920 --> 00:33:01,760
Yeah, I do wonder if maybe third parties could make a little bit cheaper units, but it depends

558
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:02,760
on the hardware.

559
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:05,800
You put nice components in there, put a good screen on there, the cost is going to go up.

560
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:12,200
It is intriguing though to see this massive deployment of what is essentially desktop

561
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:17,300
Linux to that quote unquote new user market that we always talk about.

562
00:33:17,300 --> 00:33:18,300
This is it.

563
00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:21,760
This is the front line of end users and they're running Linux with these machines.

564
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:25,040
And now they've made one that's a business machine.

565
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:29,960
It might not have been the desktop Linux that we all thought we would see in the 90s, but

566
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:34,360
we are watching something pretty significant roll out here on some pretty fancy hardware.

567
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:39,520
If you say a massive deployment, well that's what Google wants, but I can't say I'm afraid.

568
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:42,720
Maybe not of this particular device, but of Chrome OS in general, I think they've achieved

569
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:43,720
it.

570
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:44,720
Yeah, true.

571
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:45,720
True.

572
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:46,720
