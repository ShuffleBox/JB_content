00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,240
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, episode 183, recorded on April 4th, 2021. I'm Chris.

2
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:10,240
And I'm Wes.

3
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:14,200
Hello, Wes. Did you dodge all the pranks and fake releases for April Fools?

4
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:17,880
Well, I think we'll see today the proof is in the podcast pudding.

5
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:19,560
Alright, let's do the news.

6
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:24,840
And we start with something that's definitely not a prank, although it was announced around

7
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:32,720
April Fools, right on schedule, Alma Linux's initial release is here.

8
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:37,480
This first version is based on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.3 sources.

9
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:42,940
And as you probably remember, Alma Linux launched with the codename Project Linux when Red Hat

10
00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:49,340
announced CentOS was shifting focus from CentOS Linux to CentOS Stream, which tracks just

11
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:51,880
ahead of the current RHEL release.

12
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:57,880
Now under a new name, Alma Linux OS is here with its very first release.

13
00:00:57,880 --> 00:01:02,120
Yeah, congratulations to them and hitting it right on time to that's impressive to see

14
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:04,440
that makes them first to market with this.

15
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:11,440
Cloud Linux is the company behind Alma Linux, and they started in 2009 to provide a customized

16
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:17,160
version of RHEL, their own version of RHEL that was purpose built for their customers,

17
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:19,960
multi tenancy web and server hosting companies.

18
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:23,800
So they were essentially selling the shovels to the hosting companies that were doing the

19
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:24,800
mining.

20
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:29,680
And when the Red Hat news about the change in CentOS status came out, they were just

21
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:34,920
perfectly positioned to spring into action because their work pipeline was building this

22
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:35,920
already.

23
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:37,000
That's what they had been doing.

24
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,840
So they were first to market with this stable traditional CentOS clone because it was so

25
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:43,600
in line with their existing business practice.

26
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:48,120
As exciting as all that is, though, Chris, there's another piece of this announcement

27
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:50,400
that might be just as important.

28
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:52,600
You might be right, Wes, long term.

29
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:56,760
So what it is, is the company announced the formation of a nonprofit organization that

30
00:01:56,760 --> 00:02:02,260
will go around the distribution, and it's aptly named the Alma Linux Open Source Foundation.

31
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:08,200
And it's this group that's going to take over managing the Alma Linux project going forward,

32
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:13,360
although Cloud Linux will still be involved and has even committed a one million dollar

33
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:16,760
annual endowment to support the project.

34
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:22,880
They've recently hired a former Red Hat employee and Fedora engineer to run the community.

35
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:26,560
And this governing board they're putting together, I'm mixed on it, Wes.

36
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:31,360
Yeah, it sounds like it'll be mostly made up of Cloud Linux staff, but there are going

37
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:36,200
to be two additional members that will be selected by the Alma Linux community itself.

38
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:41,040
Yeah, a couple of members just from outside of Alma Linux that are part of the nonprofit,

39
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:45,960
a couple of members of the staff from Cloud Linux, and then I guess down the road, these

40
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:47,960
other community members will join.

41
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:53,280
But to me, Wes, it seems like a clear attempt to appeal to the people that are still kind

42
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:58,840
of in shock by all of the CentOS changes and perhaps skeptical of a corporate entity running

43
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:03,040
this type of distribution now, and maybe are a little more inclined to go with something

44
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,460
backed by a community.

45
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:08,320
It feels like they're trying to say, well, we will now be all of those things.

46
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:12,800
We will have the one million dollar resources of Cloud Linux and some of the staff, and

47
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:16,200
we have a community governance board which will guide the distribution.

48
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:20,520
Yeah, or at least I think there's the sense that they want to do this the right way, that

49
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:25,320
they appreciate the open source model and the open source community, and they acknowledge

50
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:26,880
like, okay, well, we should probably have a foundation.

51
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:27,880
We should have a board.

52
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:29,680
We should have folks involved with the community.

53
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:31,640
It's definitely a positive thing, I think, to see that.

54
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:34,800
Yeah, I mean, the intention seems good here.

55
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:40,080
It does to me still feel there's been a lot of benefit from the corporate resources to

56
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:44,400
get this bootstrapped, and it's all happened very quickly, again, to their credit.

57
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:49,220
But I just, I think it takes time to build legitimate community and that interaction

58
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:54,040
and to see, you know, over a couple of releases maybe, or at least a few more months, is there

59
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:55,040
back and forth?

60
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:56,760
How does the development work?

61
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:58,880
What's the nature of this new community?

62
00:03:58,880 --> 00:03:59,880
Right.

63
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:01,440
This is truly chapter one.

64
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:03,500
Everything that's been before this was just like the epilogue.

65
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:09,140
This is now what is living this distribution like going forward.

66
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:14,520
And it's ironic because the benchmark might actually be the least you can tell, like the

67
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:18,400
less and less you can tell you're on a different distribution, the better a job they're doing.

68
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:22,280
And they're trying to make it appealing to people to convert from RHEL or CentOS to them

69
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:23,280
and make scripts available.

70
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:28,080
But you got to think it's a job well done when you can't tell you've switched, which

71
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:29,080
is kind of funny.

72
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:30,440
You look at it, that's kind of funny.

73
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:35,760
But I think they recognize what this is.

74
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:39,020
This is a once in a lifetime opportunity.

75
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:44,760
This is like parallel universe kind of opportunity, like when and how else who could have seen

76
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:51,240
this giant opening coming in the super established enterprise grade Linux server distro market.

77
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:52,900
It was locked down tight.

78
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:57,480
And now all of a sudden this company we've never heard of until about a year ago, well,

79
00:04:57,480 --> 00:05:02,520
a little bit not even that long ago, comes along and they have the first crack at what

80
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:07,360
could be one of the major Linux server distros.

81
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,440
When else do you see an opportunity like this open up?

82
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:13,840
And the fact that they executed in four months, it puts them I think at the front of the list

83
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:14,840
right now.

84
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:15,840
Yeah, I think it does.

85
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:17,840
And clearly they sense that this was an opportunity.

86
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:22,760
I mean, you weren't just going to go unseat the classic version of CentOS by yourself,

87
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:23,760
right?

88
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:24,760
No.

89
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:27,720
It took Red Hat deciding they wanted to change the focus for this to exist.

90
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:30,740
They should probably feel good about how quickly they've dived in here.

91
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:35,640
And how good they are positioned, because it was already kind of in line with their

92
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:36,960
existing business model.

93
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:40,160
So this was a process that they've already built and established.

94
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:44,520
And so just expanding on that wasn't a matter of spinning up everything from scratch like

95
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:45,520
it is for Rocky Linux.

96
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:48,720
It was just simply investing in what they've already done.

97
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:49,720
Right.

98
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:52,840
Build it out a little better in the public view, transition things out into the open

99
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:54,720
and make it a little more generic.

100
00:05:54,720 --> 00:06:01,200
And they have the benefit of having the organizational aspects of a company to help just staff the

101
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:03,680
things that need done to get something like this going.

102
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:09,200
I mean, even getting a governance board established takes many, many hours of work behind the

103
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:10,200
scenes.

104
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:12,820
And they have people who get paid to do that work.

105
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:16,360
And so they're kind of giving you the promise or the kind of the guarantee you get by having

106
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:23,040
a company with a revenue model behind it and the advantage of having community governance.

107
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:27,080
But it's really going to be one of these things where we're going to have to be a year or

108
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:31,720
two down the road to see how all of these different CentOS clones are contending.

109
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:35,840
And if any of them have deviated much, if they try to add their own value or whatever

110
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:40,520
it might be that makes them different, because their core value is going to be as close to

111
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:46,480
RHEL as possible, which means there's not a lot of area in there for them to offer differentiated

112
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:47,480
value.

113
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:51,920
And of course, there's still also, you know, CentOS is around, Stream exists.

114
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:55,140
And how do you feel about this, you know, this new brand new community and foundation

115
00:06:55,140 --> 00:06:58,560
versus something more established like Red Hat itself?

116
00:06:58,560 --> 00:06:59,920
That's still up in the air.

117
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:06,080
Along with that is not just CentOS as a project, but also is this Stream model perhaps a better

118
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:11,120
model for servers today, especially servers where a lot of the workload is either virtualized

119
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:13,000
or containerized.

120
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:17,360
Maybe it makes a little more sense to go the core OS route and have a little bit more frequently

121
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:19,320
updated base OS.

122
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:25,800
And CentOS will provide just that, but still be a very enterprise focused distribution.

123
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:31,120
So it could actually end up being perfectly usable for most people.

124
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:35,000
And none of these CentOS clones ever ended up picking up that many users in mass because

125
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
of that.

126
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,840
Just wait and see.

127
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:45,200
Like a bad movie remake, this week, IBM and Red Hat were sued for copyright and antitrust

128
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:49,240
violations from a SCO group successor, Zinus.

129
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:54,720
They formed around the SCO group's zombie corpse about a decade ago.

130
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:57,940
And this week they thought, hey, let's reignite a decades old fight.

131
00:07:57,940 --> 00:08:04,680
So they sued IBM and Red Hat for alleged copyright antitrust violations, claiming that, quote,

132
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:10,760
first, IBM stole Zinus's intellectual property and used that stolen property to build and

133
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:14,720
sell a product to compete with Zinus itself.

134
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:21,760
And second, stolen property in IBM's hand, IBM and Red Hat illegally agreed to divide

135
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:27,040
the relevant market and use their growing market powers to victimize consumers, innovative

136
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:30,160
competitors and innovation itself.

137
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,440
My goodness.

138
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:36,880
The complaint from the Virgin Islands based company further contends that after the two

139
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:42,920
companies conspired in their evil boardrooms to divide the market up, IBM then did their

140
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:49,600
master move and acquired Red Hat to really solidify its evil genius position.

141
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:55,640
Now, of course, the SCO group way back in 2003 made a similar intellectual property

142
00:08:55,640 --> 00:09:01,400
claim at the time, arguing that the SCO group owned the rights to AT&T's Unix and Unixware

143
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:07,960
operating system source code, and that Linux versions 2.4 and 2.5 at the time were just

144
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:12,880
unauthorized derivatives of Unix.

145
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:17,640
And that IBM violated its contractual obligations by distributing Linux.

146
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:24,240
I can't help but just have a toot about this one, because I remember this from the days

147
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,360
gone by where this originally went down.

148
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:32,320
You know, back in 2001, SCO, which was this plucky little Unix company, joined forces

149
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:36,880
with a plucky little Linux company called Caldera to form what they thought was going

150
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:41,760
to be like this major, serious Unix approach to Linux that would compete with Red Hat.

151
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:45,840
Instead, it took them about two years or so to drive the thing into the ground.

152
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:51,400
And then SCO sued IBM in an all-out legal attack to essentially try to derive some

153
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:53,880
value from the IP they held.

154
00:09:53,880 --> 00:10:00,200
And as I recall, and probably many of you do as well, that drug on for years.

155
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:02,600
And it got to a point where it got ridiculous.

156
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:07,580
I had clients who started to doubt the use of Linux because SCO actually made claims

157
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:12,320
that they would sue individual Linux users for infringement.

158
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:15,800
Despite those claims, things did not exactly go well.

159
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:22,920
SCO lost battle after battle, and was eventually forced to file for bankruptcy in 2007.

160
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:27,800
But what is notable is that while some of the claims have been dismissed, its case against

161
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:30,440
IBM remains essentially unresolved.

162
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:34,960
I always wondered if this would come back to bite us.

163
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:37,920
So let's fast forward to 2011.

164
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:42,240
They went bankrupt in 2007, we fast forward to 2011, and really the only thing left of

165
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:48,480
value in SCO is its Unix operating system, which they sold to Unixis, or Unisys?

166
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,920
The original name of Xenius.

167
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:51,920
Right.

168
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:55,240
That acquisition, which at the time seemed a little strange, kind of makes sense when

169
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:59,600
you figure that SCO's Unix products, like Open Server and Unixware, still had a small

170
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,720
but real market share.

171
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:08,080
But the ironic thing is, is at the time, the Xenius people said, we have no interest in

172
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:17,400
SCO's quote, worthless lawsuits, and in 2016, the CEO Sean Snyder said, we are not SCO.

173
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:20,080
We are investors who bought the products.

174
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:26,360
We did not buy the ability to pursue litigation against IBM, and we have absolutely no interest

175
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:27,360
in that.

176
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,360
Now, what changed?

177
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:31,320
You know, because that's a pretty bold statement.

178
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:36,900
Well, kind of like the old SCO Caldera situation fell apart.

179
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:41,560
They also have fallen upon hard times and now have officially released a statement that

180
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:47,000
says, well, this case is about Xenius and the theft of our intellectual property.

181
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:52,680
It is also about market manipulation that has harmed consumers, competitors, the open

182
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:55,800
source community, and innovation itself.

183
00:11:55,800 --> 00:12:01,320
These copyright claims go back almost two decades now, and seem like they've lost time

184
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:02,640
after time.

185
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:05,680
But digging into this again, I was looking at it, it seems like the litigation is based

186
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:11,840
off of specific Unixware and open server operating systems and code that came into existence

187
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:15,220
after September 19th, 1995.

188
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:18,720
So not the earlier Unix code, but after that point.

189
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:24,040
So when an IBM spokesperson was reached for comment, Doug Shelton responded with the following.

190
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:29,840
Xenius's copyright allegations merely rehash the stale claims of its predecessor, whose

191
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:34,820
copyright Xenius purchased out of bankruptcy and have no merit.

192
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:39,020
Xenius's antitrust allegations brought against IBM and Red Hat, the world's largest open

193
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:42,640
source company, similarly defy logic.

194
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:48,000
IBM and Red Hat will aggressively defend the integrity of the open source development process

195
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,880
in the inherent choice and thus competition that open source fosters.

196
00:12:52,880 --> 00:13:00,040
Not only does it defy logic, as IBM puts it, but Xenius provides really zero proof of this

197
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:06,400
claim that IBM and Red Hat conspired to divide up the Unix and Linux market between them

198
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:11,560
and then the grand finale was IBM's ninja move to buy Red Hat to consolidate its market

199
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:12,560
share.

200
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:19,800
No, it seems more like IBM's purchase of Red Hat was a desperate move to stay relevant.

201
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:25,840
And of course, Xenius's version of reality doesn't explain the rise of Debian, Ubuntu,

202
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:29,360
or all the other server distros.

203
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:38,520
Linode makes cloud computing simple, affordable, and accessible.

204
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:42,000
I realized the other day Linode is really part of our team.

205
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:47,400
They make what we do behind the scenes possible, and if it weren't really for these spots,

206
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:52,040
you'd never know that we use Linode because, like all great infrastructure, the users never

207
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:53,040
really notice it.

208
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:58,080
It's just fast, reliable, and it makes your experience great, and that's one of the many

209
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:02,480
reasons Linode is our favorite hosting provider.

210
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:06,920
Linode is also the largest independent cloud computing provider.

211
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:09,860
They've been in this since 2003, and they've got it right.

212
00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:14,800
They make it easy for you to give your creations their own personal space on the internet.

213
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:18,900
No matter what skill level you're at or what technology stack you use, Linode can help

214
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:24,160
your ideas come to life on the web, and if you run into any trouble, they have the best

215
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:25,160
support.

216
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:30,520
Linode comes with whatever level account you have, one server, or a whole bunch of servers.

217
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:37,480
You get 24-7 customer support by phone, ticket, chat, along with hundreds of super high-quality

218
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:42,640
tutorials to help you get started, and Linode is easy to use while also having a powerful

219
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:44,240
cloud dashboard.

220
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:47,980
One of the features I love is their S3-compatible object storage.

221
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:51,200
It's great for all kinds of applications, so that's why you gotta go and check it out

226
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:13,240
Canonical has released a community preview of Ubuntu on Windows as a sandbox for experimenting

227
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:20,320
with new features and functionality on Windows Subsystem for Linux 2, aka the Weasel.

228
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:25,840
Now, if you're not familiar, Ubuntu on Windows is normally installed via the Microsoft Store,

229
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:29,120
and only LTS releases are available.

230
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:34,560
Yeah, now this new preview that Canonical is cooking up is only available by a special

231
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:39,440
sneaky link, which of course we have in the show notes, and it's a frequently updated

232
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:46,320
build of Ubuntu that is based on 21.04, which is expected to release on April 22nd.

233
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:51,760
This setup is specifically more user-friendly for the WSL environment, and it uses a utility

234
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:56,480
called Ubuntu Weasel with many features that are experimental, and this allows Windows

235
00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:01,240
users to tinker with settings such as how Windows drives are mounted and other kind

236
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:05,440
of text-based options to make life in Weasel more satisfying.

237
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:11,040
Now, Canonical said that the preview is important to match the speed of innovation in open source

238
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:15,300
and test new features with the community at a faster pace.

239
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:20,520
That's another way of saying we feel like this platform has a community that is large

240
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:26,340
enough that wants to build applications on Ubuntu, but they want the latest Ubuntu so

241
00:16:26,340 --> 00:16:33,240
they can supposedly, in theory, I guess hypothetically, develop future Ubuntu applications from the

242
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:37,120
Windows desktop, because that's why they would need access to the development versions of

243
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:42,260
Ubuntu is if they're writing applications, but they're using it via Weasel on Windows,

244
00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:47,720
so they're writing Linux applications on Windows for a version of Linux that hasn't been released

245
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:48,720
yet.

246
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:52,240
Now, maybe you're writing a server-side app that you're just trying to, you know, plan

247
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:53,720
ahead a little bit.

248
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:54,720
Hmm.

249
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:55,720
Okay.

250
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:56,720
Yeah, okay.

251
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:58,900
That does make more sense for the server side, although how many servers are going to be

252
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:00,960
based off of 2104?

253
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:04,460
But they'll be based on future LTSs, and maybe you want to make sure you're catching up with

254
00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:06,080
libraries to get ahead of changes.

255
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:11,760
Right, you get the kinks worked out on this system before it's close to the LTS time,

256
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:14,920
and then by the time it's LTS time, you have this system kind of worked out and people

257
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:20,400
know how to use it, and you know, maybe these scripts to make it better under Weasel are

258
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,080
even more fleshed out.

259
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:27,400
Though to your point, one feature that is eagerly awaited right now is official support

260
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:30,000
for a GUI on Weasel 2.

261
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:36,960
Now, last year at Build 2020 in May, a Microsoft program manager did say that adding Linux

262
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:42,320
GUI app support is on the roadmap, and that their goal is for a user to be able to run

263
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:48,480
Linux GUI apps on the desktop seamlessly alongside Windows apps.

264
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:54,160
We've heard little sense, perhaps there will be more at this upcoming build, but what we

265
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:59,680
do know is Microsoft's implementation is going to communicate with an RDP client on the Windows

266
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:00,680
host.

267
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:05,960
Sadly, no sign of this yet in the new Windows community preview, but there is an intriguing

268
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:12,480
option to include legacy GUI integration, though we should note that requires a third

269
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:13,480
party X server.

270
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:20,040
Well, just in time, because it might be just one giant leap away from finally getting rid

271
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:26,080
of our X servers, Wes, because this week, NVIDIA proposed Mesa patches to support alternative

272
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:31,960
generic buffer manager backends, which I read as Wayland support is nigh.

273
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:37,800
Boy, oh boy, yeah, it looks like NVIDIA is finally taking the GBM route for supporting

274
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:42,520
Wayland compositors with their proprietary driver.

275
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:48,540
For years, NVIDIA was resisting using GBM, and instead proposed using an alternative

276
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:50,640
called EGL streams.

277
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:56,180
Now, some compositor, like Gnome's Mudder, did implement EGL streams, but it's been kind

278
00:18:56,180 --> 00:19:01,000
of only a mild success, really hit and miss, and a lot of Wayland compositors were not

279
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,440
exactly keen to implement an NVIDIA specific solution.

280
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:08,120
Yeah, it was like this package deal that people didn't like because they were pushing this

281
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:14,160
new Unix device memory allocator interface to try to address some shortcomings of GBM

282
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:18,000
and they thought, well, maybe we could learn a few things from what we liked about EGL

283
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
and bring it forward.

284
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,800
But there really hasn't been much to report on that front, doesn't seem like they got

285
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:28,540
much traction and without much changing now, NVIDIA with the version 470 of their driver

286
00:19:28,540 --> 00:19:34,640
series has Wayland improvements that are expected and will introduce DMA buffer passing support,

287
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:40,640
which is the clearest sign yet that they are actually going the GBM route, which is exciting

288
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:45,200
because that's where most of the community momentum is for this solution.

289
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:50,600
We got an update when NVIDIA's James Jones, longtime contributor to Linux drivers and

290
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:55,240
Wayland related efforts on their side, sent out a work in progress merge request that

291
00:19:55,240 --> 00:20:00,800
would allow Mesa to discover and load alternative GBM back ends.

292
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:05,360
And it seems like the only reason NVIDIA would be working on this GBM back end discovery

293
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:11,680
and loading code was if they were planning to, perhaps already done internally, implement

294
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:15,200
GBM support for their proprietary Linux driver.

295
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:19,740
Yeah, this doesn't take away the need for the proprietary driver.

296
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:25,800
So it's still not as simple a solution as an Intel Linux box or an AMD Radeon style

297
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:29,160
system where you just boot up the system and it just works out of the box.

298
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:32,120
You still have to load the NVIDIA proprietary driver here.

299
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:39,520
But NVIDIA being willing to make this compromise actually, truly for realsies opens the door

300
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:47,020
to use Wayland on the proprietary NVIDIA driver, which means by summer, end of summer ish,

301
00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:51,680
the classic age old problem that prevented Wayland adoption amongst a ginormous swath

302
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:53,960
of the Linux population could be resolved.

303
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:57,960
And it could be a problem of the past that just is no longer a problem.

304
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:03,920
With this contribution and that recent GPU pass-through contribution, does this mean

305
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:08,580
we have to hate NVIDIA less?

306
00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:10,680
Linux.ting.com.

307
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:13,540
New year, new plans, same incredible service.

308
00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:17,440
And you know, a good family plan is hard to find, but not at Ting.

309
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:22,800
Ting's newest flex plan addresses this particular pain point in a very customer friendly kind

310
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:23,800
of way.

311
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:27,200
Add as many lines on your account as you need, it's just $10 per line.

312
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:29,920
Every line has unlimited texting calls.

313
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:35,680
Every line shares the same pool of LTE or 5G, and you just pay $5 per gigabyte as you

314
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:36,680
need.

315
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:40,360
But if you need two gigs or 20 gigs, there's a perfect Ting plan for you.

316
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:46,320
And every plan gets access to Ting's award-winning customer service with nationwide LTE and 5G

317
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:47,320
coverage.

318
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:53,000
Plus, the thing I love the most, the freedom of no contracts ever.

319
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,980
And now Ting has three great networks to choose from.

320
00:21:55,980 --> 00:21:56,980
It's simple to switch to Ting.

321
00:21:56,980 --> 00:22:01,760
I've been on the Verizon network and it was easy to go to linux.ting.com, check my current

322
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:06,560
phone, I created an account, got the plan dialed in, and then Ting sent me a SIM card

323
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:09,700
that I just popped into my phone and it was active in minutes.

324
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:13,320
You can do it all through their beautiful website, but if you ever need support, they're

325
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:15,160
right there to help you.

326
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:19,620
Cutting your phone bill in half has never been easier with Ting's mobile plans.

327
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:21,680
Check out the Flex plan and much more.

328
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:23,400
It's the next generation of Ting mobile.

329
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:24,400
It's here.

330
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:30,560
So go see how much you could save and get $25 off at linux.ting.com.

331
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:34,440
Thanks to Ting for supporting Linux Action News and thanks to everyone who supports this

332
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:39,440
show by going to linux.ting.com.

333
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:41,900
Good news in GTK Town.

334
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:47,020
There's a new library in the works that should be a boon to anyone looking to create a modern

335
00:22:47,020 --> 00:22:48,900
GNOME application.

336
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:52,460
But to understand why, we need a little bit of context.

337
00:22:52,460 --> 00:22:59,440
For the past 20 years, GNOME has had Human Interface Guidelines, or HIG for short, but

338
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:04,140
implementing them has been a lot of manual work for application developers.

339
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:09,600
And it's tricky because developers have been told, yeah, just go create a GTK application.

340
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:14,920
How do you create a, quote unquote, GNOME looking GTK application?

341
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:17,360
Elementary OS has Granite.

342
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:22,680
And there are some things out there that GTK developers can use like Lib Handy and a few

343
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:26,880
others that have cropped up over the years like Lib Dazzle.

344
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:33,680
But it's not really a clear signal on this is how you go create a GNOME looking and GNOME

345
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:35,240
design following application.

346
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:37,800
It just really hasn't existed.

347
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:42,400
Developers have clearly needed some kind of blessed library that implements the HIG and

348
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,860
what a standard GNOME application should look like.

349
00:23:44,860 --> 00:23:49,820
This new LibAdoita library intends to be that missing code.

350
00:23:49,820 --> 00:23:55,400
It's going to be implemented as a direct GTK for continuation and replacement of Lib Handy.

351
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:58,680
And it's going to be developed by those same current developers.

352
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:00,200
Replacement of Lib Handy is a big deal.

353
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:03,840
And I don't think when Lib Handy first came along, they thought it would be this way to

354
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:05,480
create standard looking applications.

355
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:10,600
But it clearly has been something that the GTK ecosystem developers have needed.

356
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:13,700
Now the library not quite ready to be used yet.

357
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:16,440
There's still some fixes and remaining issues that have to be worked out.

358
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:20,320
They're going to write up a migration guide and then they'll start releasing an alpha

359
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:21,560
that people can target.

360
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:28,000
But what's key here is that this LibAdoita library is going to follow revisions of the

361
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,600
GNOME Shell Human Interface Guideline.

362
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:34,520
And it will have a release schedule that tracks with GNOME's release schedule.

363
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:38,560
And each version of the library will target a specific version of GNOME and the first

364
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:41,640
stable version being released alongside GNOME 41.

365
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:43,280
Dang it, Chris.

366
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:44,880
Just when you started learning Flutter.

367
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:48,320
Somehow I'm going to make due, Wes, because a well-known GNOME developer has been chipping

368
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:54,420
away at making OBS Studio work completely under Wayland that includes things like capturing

369
00:24:54,420 --> 00:24:58,640
monitor and windows, even on the Wayland composite desktop.

370
00:24:58,640 --> 00:24:59,640
It's here.

371
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:00,640
It's awesome.

372
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:01,640
It's a release candidate.

373
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:03,520
It's a major milestone for the Linux Wayland desktop.

374
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:06,560
Yeah, I think this is one of those checkboxes.

375
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:09,960
There's just a number of Linux users out there and they need to have before they're actually

376
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:11,260
ready for Wayland.

377
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:15,600
And it's nice to see all the hard work that's had to go in both to the OBS project itself,

378
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:20,280
but also all the plumbing underneath things like pipe wire and portals that are required

379
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:24,820
to make this not only work, but eventually be better and more secure than it could have

380
00:25:24,820 --> 00:25:26,600
ever been on X11.

381
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:29,040
Well, they weren't April fooling around.

382
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:32,040
Arch actually has an installer now.

383
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:34,640
And you know us, we had to give it a go.

384
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:35,640
Yeah, you know we did.

385
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:36,640
We had to try it.

386
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:40,940
You download the standard Arch ISO image and then just run Arch install and get kind of

387
00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:44,380
like a guided basic installation.

388
00:25:44,380 --> 00:25:45,920
It's not going to do much fancy for you.

389
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:47,940
No, it's a Python application.

390
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:51,880
You can also install it with PIP or all the other ways to get Python apps if you like.

391
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:54,760
But I like they've included it by default, huh?

392
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:59,860
And no, there's not a lot of extensibility right now, at least not in the built in.

393
00:25:59,860 --> 00:26:03,560
But because it's Python, they've got some documentation for scripting it yourself.

394
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:07,280
If you want to totally customize it, that has some interesting potential.

395
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:10,660
Yeah, because when you're kind of done answering all of its questions, it essentially just

396
00:26:10,660 --> 00:26:13,460
generates a big JSON output of what's going to happen to your machine.

397
00:26:13,460 --> 00:26:18,580
So I would think you could take that and pipe that back to the Arch installer on another

398
00:26:18,580 --> 00:26:20,880
machine and just kind of replicate your setup.

399
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:25,300
Yeah, and you can use it as a library directly if you want to go fully custom, say, for your

400
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:27,400
fleet of Arch servers you're building.

401
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:29,320
Of course, obviously, who wouldn't be?

402
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:33,280
And I'll say this, it's not like going to blow you away.

403
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:38,480
But by the time you're done, you'll have a fully booting graphical Arch Linux desktop.

404
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:42,460
Pretty minimal, but there and it takes about 15 minutes.

405
00:26:42,460 --> 00:26:44,480
There is one gotcha we ran into, though.

406
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:48,260
We were testing things out in a virtual machine, I'll admit.

407
00:26:48,260 --> 00:26:50,260
Haven't tried it on bare metal yet.

408
00:26:50,260 --> 00:26:52,460
It only seems to support EFI.

409
00:26:52,460 --> 00:26:55,380
So watch out you BIOS booters out there.

410
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:56,380
It's legacy.

411
00:26:56,380 --> 00:27:00,440
But of course, that's what we got by default in the virtual machine tells you things are

412
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:02,020
done and ready to reboot.

413
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:04,820
Oh, no, my friend, you don't come back from that.

414
00:27:04,820 --> 00:27:05,820
Who would have thought it?

415
00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:08,940
Arch with its own official installer and it's really, you know what, it's not bad.

416
00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:11,340
We'll have a link to the project repository too.

417
00:27:11,340 --> 00:27:14,880
There's always a lot going on those to go to LinuxActionNews.com slash subscribe for

418
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:21,020
all the ways to get new episodes and LinuxActionNews.com slash contact for ways to keep in touch.

419
00:27:21,020 --> 00:27:24,340
Now don't miss Linux Unplugged 400 this week.

420
00:27:24,340 --> 00:27:27,660
Wes and I have been brewing up something special.

421
00:27:27,660 --> 00:27:32,840
We'll be back next Monday with our weekly take on the latest Linux and open source news.

422
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:51,220
Thanks for joining us and we will see you next week.
