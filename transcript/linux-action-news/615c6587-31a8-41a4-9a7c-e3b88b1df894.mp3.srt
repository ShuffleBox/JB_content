00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,300
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, episode 164, recorded on November 22nd, 2020.

2
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:09,300
I'm Chris.

3
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:10,300
And I'm Wes.

4
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:11,300
Hello, Wes.

5
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:17,680
And we should say happy birthday to the GIMP project, which turned 25 years old this weekend.

6
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:18,680
Never looking better, GIMP.

7
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:24,620
All right, Wes, let's do the news and let's start with YouTube DL back up on GitHub.

8
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:25,780
And aren't we glad?

9
00:00:25,780 --> 00:00:30,800
Now, if you don't remember, GitHub received a controversial DMCA takedown request from

10
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:37,300
the Recording Industry Association of America, better known as the RIAA, way back on October

11
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:38,300
23rd.

12
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:40,240
Yes, I do recall.

13
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:42,160
We were rather upset about it, if I recall.

14
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:43,880
Indeed, we were.

15
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:49,300
The DMCA takedown letter back then from the RIAA argued that YouTube DL was being used

16
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:54,440
to circumvent the technological protection of streaming services such as YouTube.

17
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:59,720
And then they went on to argue also that it could reproduce and distribute music videos

18
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:02,120
and sound recordings without authorization.

19
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:05,240
That was like the big, oh my gosh, what?

20
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:07,440
But really, maybe not so much.

21
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:09,680
Well, yeah, let's be a little more specific.

22
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:16,840
The RIAA used section 1201 of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act or the DMCA to claim

23
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:22,200
that YouTube DL was breaking copyright by providing a tool to circumvent copyrighted

24
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:23,460
material.

25
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:28,640
Even if YouTube DL itself didn't contain any copyright infringing code directly.

26
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:29,640
Yeah.

27
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:30,640
Yeah.

28
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:31,640
Yeah.

29
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:33,080
Well, here's what happened.

30
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:37,000
Just a little bit after last week's show, GitHub said that YouTube DL did not actually

31
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,640
break that section 1201 of the DMCA.

32
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:45,440
And it cited a letter that it received, GitHub had received from the EFF.

33
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:50,560
And they did a fantastic job of doing a great defense for YouTube DL.

34
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:56,560
And I think they played a big role in helping explain to both GitHub and maybe future interested

35
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:00,120
parties in the technical aspects of this case.

36
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,320
And I think maybe save the day a little bit.

37
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:03,660
You really have to give it to the EFF.

38
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:10,440
The lawyers argued that YouTube DL could never be taken down because of section 1201 at all.

39
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:14,280
Because YouTube DL itself doesn't actually circumvent any kind of copyright protection

40
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:16,280
system in the first place.

41
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:20,840
Yeah, I like this quote from their letter.

42
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:26,060
As the federal court recently ruled, one does not circumvent access control by using a publicly

43
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:27,600
available password.

44
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:32,360
And that's really what it came down to, the code in YouTube DL that was, quote unquote,

45
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:33,680
circumventing the copyright protections.

46
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:41,120
Well, really, it was all just relying on public information that you get when you visit YouTube.com.

47
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:44,480
Computers are hard, Wes, and it's hard for the RIAA to understand it.

48
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:45,740
It always has been.

49
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:50,680
We also talked a little bit in our coverage about GitHub's response to this, and if they

50
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:53,520
could have done things a little differently, and it does seem like they're going to make

51
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:54,520
some changes.

52
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:58,480
Yeah, I think they noticed that maybe they weren't quite prepared for this particular

53
00:02:58,480 --> 00:02:59,480
case.

54
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:04,880
And they've now decided to establish a $1 million developer defense fund that the company

55
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:10,740
plans to use to protect developers against unwarranted DMCA section 1201 takedown claims.

56
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:12,520
So this is pretty specific, I think.

57
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:17,360
Yeah, it's sort of like, it's sort of like plugging a leak instead of fixing it, though.

58
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:21,440
Really what would be amazing is if instead of a million dollars, if Microsoft could invest

59
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:24,140
10 million dollars in just getting the DMCA fixed.

60
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:27,040
But this is a great first step.

61
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:30,320
It sort of felt that when GitHub received this notice, you know, they felt like they

62
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:31,320
didn't have a lot of options.

63
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:34,800
They just took it down to play it safe, figuring, all right, I guess this gets sorted out in

64
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:35,800
court.

65
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:39,820
But now they're going to hire technical and legal experts along with some independent

66
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:46,080
specialists who will from now on review all DMCA section 1201 takedown claims going forward

67
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:49,480
to ensure they're compliant with the DMCA and to protect open source developers from

68
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:50,760
needless litigation.

69
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:55,040
So presumably, and we can't say until this happens, but presumably this this board would

70
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:59,620
have just found that no, YouTube DL is not infringing or not doing anything.

71
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:05,420
This is a complicated issue, these DMCA takedowns, because as you and I found in our own research

72
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:10,840
for the show, there are established, well known open source projects that actually use

73
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:16,220
DMCA takedown to maybe stop somebody who's taken a fork of the project and closed it

74
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:21,320
up and is charging weird money for it or is embedding spyware or maybe brand stealing.

75
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:24,360
There are legitimate uses for projects.

76
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:28,780
And so GitHub didn't want to just completely throw out the whole system, but they wanted

77
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:32,320
to at least try to give the developers a fighting chance, it seems like, from this.

78
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:36,760
In most cases, they're not going to pull it off the web unless it's absolutely necessary,

79
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:41,720
like they're going to try their best to just maybe remove an infringing component or contact

80
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:45,960
the developer directly and get them in some sort of dialogue first.

81
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:49,640
Those are all really positive improvements.

82
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:52,680
But it just seems like this maybe just isn't the right tool for this function for what

83
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:53,680
people are looking at.

84
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:56,080
The DMCA is just not the right tool for this particular function.

85
00:04:56,080 --> 00:05:00,200
I think we've seen that there's a lot of problems with it over the years, unfortunately, little

86
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,760
to no action to fix it.

87
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:04,840
Very nice, though, to see YouTube DL back up and online.

88
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:09,260
And so far from what we can tell, they didn't have to remove any cypher algorithms or anything

89
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:13,320
that was all that core to the project.

90
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:17,880
They just had to get rid of those example videos that were copyrighted music.

91
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:18,880
Right.

92
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:21,480
They had some of those test cases set up to download copyrighted music.

93
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:22,480
Those are gone.

94
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:25,240
And with that, they're back online.

95
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:30,720
There have been rumors of a six billion dollar Seuss IPO this week.

96
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:36,920
It all got kicked up by Bloomberg, who's reporting that EQT is planning an IPO for Sousa.

97
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:40,840
If you don't recall, EQT is a Swedish based private equity firm.

98
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:46,440
You might not recall because over the years, Sousa has had more than a few owners.

99
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:52,520
First it was acquired by Novell in 2004, then AttachMate with some Microsoft funding bought

100
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:55,480
Novell and Sousa in 2010.

101
00:05:55,480 --> 00:06:00,720
This was followed in short order in 2014 when Micro Focus purchased AttachMate and Sousa

102
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:03,680
was spun off as an independent division.

103
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:09,340
Then EQT finally got involved and purchased Sousa from Micro Focus for 2.5 billion in

104
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:11,000
March of 2019.

105
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:15,880
2.5 billion, which means that if this IPO turns out to be legitimate and if it does

106
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:21,040
turn out to be approximately six billion dollars, EQT, well, they're doing pretty well for

107
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:22,040
themselves.

108
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:23,040
And it seems like it's possible.

109
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:29,040
They've been pretty successful under EQT and Q3 revenue reported in September 2020 increased

110
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:31,440
14% year over year.

111
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:35,880
It seems they've also had a pretty big jump in whale clients, you know, clients that are

112
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:42,200
worth more than a million dollars, 35% increase there and a 50% jump in bookings year over

113
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:43,200
year.

114
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:44,880
So they potentially are doing really well.

115
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:49,080
And if the feedback is any indication I get on Koda radio, there's more people using Sousa

116
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:53,160
than ever, because my inbox is crying from all of the lizards telling me how great it

117
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:54,160
is.

118
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:58,920
But Bloomberg has been saying that this IPO is just in the very, very, very early stages

119
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:01,940
and nothing really may even come of this.

120
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:04,000
But Sousa was kind of coy when asked about it.

121
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Of course.

122
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,640
Folks said, we don't comment on these kinds of things, but it'd be pretty great to see

123
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:09,640
it.

124
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:12,400
I mean, Sousa has done really well for themselves recently.

125
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:15,760
They also didn't they just acquire Rancher Labs?

126
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:16,760
Indeed they did.

127
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:17,760
Yeah.

128
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:19,540
I mean, they're stepping up their game.

129
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:23,160
They do really well in the European Union, maybe not as well as in the States.

130
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,160
So we don't talk about it.

131
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,340
We hear about it a little less over here.

132
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:29,780
But you know, I like that there's another big enterprise competitor in the Linux space

133
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:30,780
out there.

134
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:33,800
And maybe an IPO could be a new steady state for Sousa.

135
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,280
I guess we'll see.

136
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:40,160
Well, speaking of revenue, Ubuntu maker Canonical Holdings Limited recently submitted their

137
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,360
UK financial report.

138
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,000
Now this is for last year.

139
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:48,520
This is for December 31st, 2019, the pre-COVID era times, and they generated around 22% more

140
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:50,040
revenue than 2018.

141
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:54,320
But the maybe important note here is they seem to have still operated at a loss, albeit

142
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:56,320
more narrowly than in prior years.

143
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:57,320
Yeah.

144
00:07:57,320 --> 00:08:04,520
The documents show their 2019 revenue at 119 million US dollars, up from 97 million the

145
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:06,140
prior year.

146
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:10,100
That means their operating loss came in at just $2 million, which, hey, that's a lot

147
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:15,680
better than the 11 million for 2018, and similar losses in recent years.

148
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:16,680
Yeah.

149
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:20,440
Now remember, these numbers are a little out of date, as we're almost in December of 2020.

150
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:24,960
But at the time of this information submitted, Canonical's average headcount for 2018 was

151
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:31,580
473, which is up prior from the 437 the year before.

152
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:33,820
And they added close to 40 more employees.

153
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:39,460
But that's still down from their 500 plus headcount before the restructuring that happened

154
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:40,600
a few years ago.

155
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:46,300
The report does note some concerns over the COVID-19 pandemic, but that's primarily from

156
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:50,720
impacts to their clients, not directly to Canonical themselves, since by and large,

157
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:55,000
they've got a global distributed workforce that's already working from home.

158
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:13,600
Long story short, they anticipate weathering the current COVID-19 climate just fine.

159
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:38,520
Not only are they entrenched members of the Linux community, but they're also just Linux

160
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:39,520
users themselves.

161
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:49,960
And that's why Canonical is so important to Canonical, because it's the only way to get

162
00:09:49,960 --> 00:10:03,440
to the root of the entire machine.

163
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:06,880
But sometimes you want it easy, and I did that recently.

164
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:07,880
I did it.

165
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:14,980
I've been debating for months, maybe even a year, about trying out this Azurecast, which

166
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:21,920
is this big one-stack open source radio station for the web that lets you manage DJ accounts

167
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:24,000
and set up automated streaming schedules.

168
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,080
It's like everything you need for a radio station in one open source package.

169
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:31,880
And I've debated setting it up, like I said, for a long, long time.

170
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:35,660
But I finally did it this weekend because I was on Linode and I saw in their app marketplace,

171
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:40,720
they have a one-click deployment and it deploys things like Liquid Soap, IceCast, ShoutCast,

172
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:45,540
NGINX, PHP, InfluxDB, Redis, all stuff that I would have had to set up.

173
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:46,920
And it does it in a single click.

174
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:48,280
It took like 10 seconds.

175
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:52,240
And one of the things that's really cool about Linode is because they get you guys is whenever

176
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:55,080
they can, they try to give you options on the underlying distro.

177
00:10:55,080 --> 00:11:00,000
So like for this particular one-click deployment, I have the option of deploying it on Debian

178
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:05,360
or Ubuntu 2004, which to match some of our other cloud instances, I chose Ubuntu 2004,

179
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:06,360
which is fantastic.

180
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:14,080
And now I've got a Ubuntu 2004, dedicated CPU, four CPU cores, eight gigs of RAM in

181
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:19,160
Dallas, Texas that's set up and ready to be an online radio station that our community

182
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:20,160
could use.

183
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:23,640
And we could have community DJs and the lup lug could tie into all of it.

184
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:28,160
I mean, there's so much potential, something I was thinking about doing for so long.

185
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:30,480
And with that one click, I finally pulled the trigger and I did it.

186
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,720
And now the potential is kind of limitless.

187
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:36,120
And that's just scratching the surface of what Linode is capable of, just scratching

188
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:37,120
the surface.

189
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:42,600
And they cost 30 to 50% less than major cloud providers like AWS or Google or your Azure.

190
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:48,400
So you get a real nice balance of super nice modern technology features, a great dashboard

191
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:54,200
to manage it all, a good citizen in the Linux community, price to performance ratio, uptime,

192
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:55,200
support is fantastic.

193
00:11:55,200 --> 00:12:00,620
Like it's all there and you can just get a little taste of it at linode.com slash LAN.

194
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:03,440
Get a $100 60 day credit towards your new account.

195
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:07,200
That's linode.com slash LAN.

196
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:12,440
With the introduction of Apple's new M1 chip, Docker's facing a few technical hurdles to

197
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:15,880
get Docker desktop running nicely on these new Macs.

198
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:20,240
Not only is there a brand new architecture, but there's also a new hypervisor framework.

199
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:24,140
Yeah, and I think probably a lot of us are familiar with this Rosetta technology that

200
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:25,640
Apple has released.

201
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:30,840
Rosetta 2 allows ARM Macs to run x86 code.

202
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:34,840
But that doesn't get you all the way to getting Docker and Docker desktop up and running on

203
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:35,840
the Mac.

204
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:40,160
Under the hood of Docker desktop, there's an actual virtual machine on the Mac side.

205
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:41,160
They do that.

206
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:43,440
I mean, you got to run Linux somehow, right?

207
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:46,480
I mean, I guess they do that because yeah, there's no other way to run it on Mac OS and

208
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:48,360
there's no other way to do on Apple hardware.

209
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:52,860
But now with the M1 chip and Big Sur, there's this new hypervisor framework.

210
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:57,440
They apparently will have to re-plumb Docker desktop to this new hypervisor framework,

211
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:00,840
which does feature M1 acceleration, but means new code.

212
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:04,800
Right, so you might actually have the Docker side in the user land of Mac OS running, but

213
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:08,160
then you've got to connect that all up and integrate the changes from the changes to

214
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:09,160
the hypervisor.

215
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:15,000
Yeah, there's also a little issue of their CI pipeline doesn't have any ARM Macs in

216
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
it yet.

217
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Oh, right.

218
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,520
I mean, how do you test it if you're not running on M1s?

219
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:23,680
They know it in here that they have 25 Mac minis that they use for automated testing

220
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:26,700
of Docker desktop.

221
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:27,700
Isn't that funny?

222
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:32,080
Yeah, although it doesn't sound like they got any of the ARM developer machines.

223
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:36,080
They say now that Apple's made the announcement, we can get some hardware in, which is an interesting

224
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:37,080
aside.

225
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:38,660
So you have the hypervisor framework.

226
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:43,040
Of course, you have the CI pipeline that needs to have some ARM Macs in it to do testing.

227
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:49,800
But there's also that wiggling issue of all of the underpinning open source projects that

228
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:51,360
Docker relies on, like Go.

229
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:53,860
Yeah, things like Go for the back end of Docker desktop.

230
00:13:53,860 --> 00:13:54,860
That's what it's written in.

231
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:58,840
And Electron for the Docker dashboard, where you can go and view all the Docker desktop

232
00:13:58,840 --> 00:13:59,840
content.

233
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:04,560
Now, these projects are hard at work getting that sorted out, but that has to happen.

234
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:08,000
Get tested and then actually integrated into Docker desktop before you'll see it running

235
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,080
anytime soon on your M1 laptop.

236
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:12,960
Meanwhile, I'm over here running containers like it's just no big thing.

237
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:15,960
I'm running on my Linux box.

238
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:21,660
Purism has finally began shipping its mass produced model of the Librem 5.

239
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:26,460
Much like with their Librem laptops, the Librem 5 features external hardware kill switches

240
00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:30,040
for both the cellular modem and Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connections.

241
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:31,040
Right.

242
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:33,220
And this is what they call their production model.

243
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:35,880
So this is the one that shouldn't have rattly parts.

244
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:38,840
This is the one that should be going to a majority of the backers.

245
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:41,600
The Kickstarter, I think, was 2017.

246
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:44,400
So this has been a little while in the making.

247
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:49,280
And what we've kind of seen during this time is Pine 64 came along and lapped them.

248
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:54,740
But notably, Purism ended up developing sort of an ecosystem of mobile technology, which

249
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:57,000
may end up being their most significant contribution here.

250
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:02,560
They invested heavily into bringing Posh, which is a form factor, you know, desktop

251
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:08,400
UI, Lib Handy, Squawk, Squawk bar, or the squeak board, I think it was called.

252
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:09,400
I can't remember exactly.

253
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:13,760
But they brought a couple of particularly nice applications in this adaptive UI for

254
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:18,300
GTK and some of their desktop technologies over the mobile space that projects like Pine

255
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:20,160
Phone and others can take advantage of.

256
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:21,160
Right.

257
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:25,340
Sort of been a development board, if you will, for some of these technologies, even if most

258
00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:27,400
folks haven't actually got a Librem 5 just yet.

259
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:32,500
I mean, I'm a little underwhelmed and disappointed just in the whole thing.

260
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:39,360
So after all of this time, after all of this years of hard work, we got this sort of unceremonious

261
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:43,020
blog post, kind of a quick and tidy blog post, like we've reached this milestone that we've

262
00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:45,480
been promising for all these years.

263
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:48,320
And you don't really see like you haven't seen like YouTube seeded with some development

264
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:52,020
units or you don't see a ton of people posting their pictures of receiving them.

265
00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:53,020
You do see some, though.

266
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:55,760
So it does seem to be getting out in people's hands this time.

267
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:56,760
That's nice.

268
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:59,180
I mean, if we remember, we were all kind of surprised and disappointed when it turned

269
00:15:59,180 --> 00:16:00,180
out.

270
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:03,640
No, they still needed more processing that they hadn't launched with the mass produced

271
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:04,640
model.

272
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:08,240
But they're not taking the victory lap, I would expect.

273
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:13,700
I wonder if the victory wasn't as sweet as they were expecting, because Todd, Todd Weaver,

274
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:17,920
the founder and CEO of Purism, he just has kind of like a PS little addendum, a single

275
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:22,600
paragraph little addendum to the blog post announcing the launch.

276
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:27,680
And they tout features that, well, frankly, PinePhone has now, like convergence and kill

277
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:33,400
switches, which when they announced the Librem 5 were kind of a cutting edge idea, but have

278
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:35,220
already been implemented by somebody else now.

279
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:40,140
And now we also see Dell is looking at implementing kill switches in Dell laptops, too.

280
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:43,780
So again, kind of taking some of their unique value there.

281
00:16:43,780 --> 00:16:47,960
I wonder what it's like now after all these years of the Kickstarter and here we are with

282
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:48,960
the production model.

283
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:51,880
I wonder, is the Purism team celebrating this victory?

284
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:53,100
Because it's notable.

285
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:54,400
They finally got this thing shipping.

286
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:59,040
Yeah, maybe it has a, you know, kind of a big, chunky form factor.

287
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:03,480
And yeah, maybe it has an IOT CPU that's kind of a killer on the battery life.

288
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:07,520
But they have achieved actually creating something that seemed nearly impossible.

289
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:13,900
And that is a free Linux running phone that, I mean, it's getting close to a usable standpoint.

290
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:18,200
When I saw some of the videos that they released that to my eye didn't seem to be edited, seem

291
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:22,560
to actually be performing quite well, like the UI may have even had some sort of video

292
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:23,560
acceleration.

293
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:24,560
Yeah.

294
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:25,820
And they've clearly put in a lot of work over the years.

295
00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:27,280
It's a non-trivial project.

296
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:29,560
It seems like it's gotten to a pretty good state.

297
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:35,040
And yet, as a company, they're not really projecting much of a win here.

298
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:37,000
And I say that's too bad.

299
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
I say tip of the hat to them.

300
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
It's impressive.

301
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,640
It took a lot longer than we'd like to see.

302
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:44,780
You know, they raised $2.2 million.

303
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:49,720
People were really, really hopeful from the sort of build from scratch, following an open

304
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:51,320
source free software ethos.

305
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:53,680
It doesn't run Android, doesn't run iOS.

306
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:58,160
It's running their PureOS and you could probably conceivably flash it with other things.

307
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:01,000
I think I'll be curious to see, do we get a new version?

308
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,100
You know, they've spent a lot of time figuring out some of the manufacturing sides, getting

309
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:06,400
the base software layer working.

310
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:10,800
But is what has happened with the lead from five, does that put them in a place where

311
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:14,140
folks want to see what they can do on a second model?

312
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:19,900
You got to figure, as a team, as they're building this thing, it's the entire times.

313
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:23,100
It's learning new things, the entire process, right?

314
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:24,960
It's a learning experience.

315
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:28,300
And so when you get to the end of it, you know how to build a phone now and you've got

316
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:31,220
to look at that and go, well, we could build something so much better now.

317
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:37,160
They have to, as a team, be thinking, what's the Librem 6 look like or something like that.

318
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:40,980
And that could be where it gets really interesting because now you've got an experienced team.

319
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:45,360
You have yet another iteration of the software that lands on a new iteration of the hardware.

320
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:46,360
Right.

321
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:47,360
They can catch up a little.

322
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:48,560
The pipeline is not going to be quite as long.

323
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:51,540
I mean, so the final product will be a little closer to what you might expect.

324
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:56,680
If I had an ideal scenario, it would be that Purism takes this victory, as it seems to

325
00:18:56,680 --> 00:19:03,080
be, and is able to kind of own the higher end of the free phone market.

326
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:06,600
Imagine if we had a scenario where there was a kind of Cadillac free phone that had all

327
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:08,080
the latest cutting edge features.

328
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:09,080
Maybe a decent camera.

329
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:10,080
Yeah.

330
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:13,240
And then you have like the Pine phone that, I mean, they could differentiate there and

331
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:17,740
have multiple products too, but you had a Pine phone that was $200 or less, a real development

332
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:23,280
hacker kit that you could throw any OS on, and it really was a hardware platform to showcase

333
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:24,280
free software.

334
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:27,680
And Purism could really kind of focus on that high end phone with an integrated software

335
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:29,480
stack approach that we see from other companies.

336
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:30,480
Right.

337
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:33,800
You want a premium phone, but you want one that's privacy focused.

338
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:34,800
I'd love to see that.

339
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:38,240
I think, how amazing would it be, say, four or five years down the road, you're looking

340
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:41,240
at this and you're going, hmm, what should I get?

341
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:47,440
A Librem 7 or a Librem 8 or the Pine 64 version 6 or whatever it would be at that point.

342
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:48,440
Which one should I get?

343
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:50,200
They're both really a great option.

344
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:51,200
Wouldn't that be nice?

345
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:53,640
Because we're getting to that point with Linux laptops now.

346
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:54,640
We are.

347
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:57,160
I mean, it's surprising to say a little bit, but we really are.

348
00:19:57,160 --> 00:20:00,560
So maybe it's possible.

349
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:04,520
Congratulations to Todd and his team on shipping the production hardware.

350
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:10,120
I also even saw reports of super responsive support from Purism.

351
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:14,880
Somebody had an issue where they couldn't get their newly received production quote

352
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:17,980
unquote model Librem 5, it wouldn't charge.

353
00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:21,400
There was an issue like something about using like USB C to C or something.

354
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:25,800
I guess Purism support got right back to them right away and told them just use a C to A

355
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:28,200
cable and it'll charge no problem.

356
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:29,200
Interesting.

357
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,200
Problem solved.

358
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:31,200
His new phone's charging.

359
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,200
He's up and playing with it.

360
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:34,880
Well, those are the kind of steps they'll need to get right if there's a bright future

361
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:37,280
ahead.

362
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:38,280
Linux.ting.com.

363
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:42,320
The next generation of Ting Mobile is here and I have been waiting to tell you guys about

364
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:43,320
this.

365
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:47,640
I'm a longtime fan of Ting and they just made things so much better.

366
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:53,560
You can get talk and text for just $10 a month, data plans starting at just $15 and unlimited

367
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:54,560
starting at $45.

368
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:58,920
So whether you use two or 20 gigabytes a month, there's a perfecting plan for you and your

369
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:01,260
family and no need to worry.

370
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:03,880
Everything we love about Ting is staying the same.

371
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:06,720
You still get access to Ting's award winning customer service.

372
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:08,520
I rave about them all the time.

373
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:14,240
You still get access to nationwide LTE and 5G coverage, plus the number one thing we

374
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:17,080
all love, no contracts ever.

375
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:18,320
You just get more choice now.

376
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:22,640
Ting Mobile customers can now choose from three different plans based on their data

377
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:25,720
needs and you know, it's really simple to switch to Ting.

378
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:30,340
Pretty much any phone will work from the latest iPhone to any Android phone you can pretty

379
00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:33,800
much think of this modern and even a few surprises too.

380
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:37,880
You could check out phones they have directly, but just start by going to linux.ting.com.

381
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:42,000
Check your current phone, see if that'll work, create an account, pick the plan that's right

382
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,740
for you and then Ting will send you a SIM card.

383
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:48,000
You pop that in your phone and you activate it in minutes.

384
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:52,620
Cutting your phone bill in half has never been easier with Ting Mobile's brand new plans.

385
00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:54,840
There's never been a better time to try Ting.

386
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:59,160
So bring your phone or get a brand new and just start by going to linux.ting.com.

387
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:01,320
Choose smarter, choose Ting Mobile.

388
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:03,040
They really did this right.

389
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:06,920
Everything you love and expect from Ting Mobile remains the same while you can also get all

390
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:08,880
this great new stuff.

391
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:13,960
No contracts, top notch account tools, great dashboard, great customer service.

392
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:18,080
You can even bring your own phone if it's working for you and now plans that will fit

393
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:19,080
your needs.

394
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:22,400
The next generation of Ting means there's literally never been a better time to try

395
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:23,640
Ting Mobile.

396
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:28,600
Just go to linux.ting.com and a big thank you and a big congratulations to Ting for

397
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:29,720
their big upgrades.

398
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:34,040
These are really great to see and it's great to give you guys the opportunity to try it.

399
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:37,040
Linux.ting.com.

400
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:41,700
Since the layoffs at Mozilla earlier this year and with some Mozilla projects seemingly

401
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:47,120
in jeopardy, it's nice to see some good news about Servo, which this week announced it's

402
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:49,040
heading off to the Linux Foundation.

403
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:50,040
Right.

404
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:51,040
This is really nice to see.

405
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:56,220
We were kind of wondering because Servo holds a special place in a lot of our hearts.

406
00:22:56,220 --> 00:23:02,840
Its mission is to provide an independent modular, embeddable web engine that's written in Rust.

407
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:07,080
And the great thing about it is since its creation in 2012, it's pretty successfully

408
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:13,080
contributed to new web standards and specifications and it's kind of made a dent in the web universe

409
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:14,480
in a short time.

410
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:16,040
And we really didn't want to see that go away.

411
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:19,680
Yeah, it's been an important aspect where, you know, the folks at Mozilla at least previously

412
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:23,080
could experiment in what the future of browsers might look like.

413
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:24,080
Yeah.

414
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:28,240
Now this move does come with other changes in particular in project governance.

415
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:32,760
The Servo project will be gaining a board and a technical steering committee to help

416
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:35,480
guide the project's future.

417
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:38,320
I'm not so sure how I'm feeling about this.

418
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:40,160
You don't think that's what they needed?

419
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:47,700
Well, I think Servo was an engineer-led, technology-first group that was building some really impressive

420
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:50,540
stuff that was leading by example.

421
00:23:50,540 --> 00:23:56,500
And I don't generally see that kind of outcome from something that's designed by committee.

422
00:23:56,500 --> 00:24:00,040
And that's essentially what we're transitioning to is something that was engineer-led to something

423
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:01,800
that will now be committee-led.

424
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:05,760
Do you wonder is this just how the Linux Foundation runs their project and that's why these changes

425
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:09,400
are happening or if there was some interest from the project as well?

426
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:13,160
Or is this in a response to a hole that was being filled by Mozilla in some capacity and

427
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:16,200
now they're just formalizing it as a governance structure?

428
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:18,840
Because you think about if they were part of a company, there's a governance structure

429
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:21,160
as part of that company that manages certain stuff.

430
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:22,160
Right, right.

431
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:25,080
Either way, I'm not thrilled with this news.

432
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:31,880
I was kind of hoping for a future where maybe like the go-to embedded web browser on the

433
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:34,200
GNOME desktop would be Servo-powered.

434
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:35,200
Wouldn't that be nice?

435
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:36,520
I mean, besides just being in Rust.

436
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:40,480
Yeah, and I also really like seeing something else that's new and innovative that could

437
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:46,840
be competitive potentially with WebKit in certain use cases in certain applications.

438
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:52,080
And it doesn't necessarily take any of that away from Servo, but I do kind of worry about

439
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:53,640
stagnation.

440
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:54,640
But we'll see.

441
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:56,600
I'm also curious, you know, what will the adoption look like?

442
00:24:56,600 --> 00:25:00,440
Will that be improved now that they've split from Mozilla or will it just make things more

443
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:01,600
difficult?

444
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:04,680
You know, previously the Firefox and Servo teams were kind of connected right at the

445
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:05,680
hip.

446
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:06,680
Now there's a little more separation.

447
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:10,400
Will they still be pulling in good ideas from Servo into the next generation of Firefox?

448
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,400
You do wonder, right?

449
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:16,320
Because you don't want to see Firefox's cutting-edge features take a hit as a result.

450
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:19,200
No, you know, I mean, say what you will about Firefox.

451
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:23,040
It oftentimes is a great web browser and part of that has been some of the neat ideas that

452
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:24,040
were developed in Servo.

453
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:27,720
Flipside, though, you just said it a moment ago, and I wonder if there isn't something

454
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:28,720
to it.

455
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:35,000
And that is by being part of the Linux Foundation and not part of Mozilla, they've essentially

456
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,800
become vendor neutral.

457
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:40,400
And that could be a driver for adoption.

458
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:41,400
Sure, right.

459
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:44,800
If there's some other folks out there who adopt Servo, who help build it and use it,

460
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:46,800
well, they could take the project in a whole new direction.

461
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:51,960
Well, the Epiphany maintainer on GNOME is reminding us this week why having an independent

462
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:57,680
voice in the standards discussion is so important and just having some additional leverage on

463
00:25:57,680 --> 00:25:58,680
the web.

464
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:02,200
January 4th, 2021, something major is happening.

465
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:06,200
Google is blocking all sign-ins to Google accounts from embedded browser frameworks,

466
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:11,340
things like Electron and potentially WebKit and WebKit adjacent browsers, which is why

467
00:26:11,340 --> 00:26:13,840
the Epiphany maintainer is bringing this up.

468
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:16,440
Yeah, his summary goes something like this.

469
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:21,920
Google will attempt to block logins from Chrome embedded framework based apps and other non-Chrome

470
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:24,280
non-supported browsers.

471
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:29,800
Presumably non-supported browsers includes non-Safari WebKit.

472
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:34,000
Considering how much time I spend trying to develop user agent quirks to suppress Google's

473
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:41,000
unsupported browser warnings on Gmail, Google Docs, etc., I guess we will find out on January

474
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,000
4th.

475
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:46,000
I can think of a lot of users that would be upset if all of a sudden they couldn't use

476
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:49,920
their web browser to log into Google accounts.

477
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:55,600
Google is trying to convince everyone, that's why they made a blog post about this in August.

478
00:26:55,600 --> 00:27:00,640
They're trying to convince everyone to use OAuth and they're also going to put the screws

479
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:02,720
locked down on Electron users.

480
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:07,360
That's where the Chromium embedded framework, if you're using an Electron app that may be

481
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:13,040
like a mail app that uses Google Mail and signs into it inside embedded in the application,

482
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:14,040
that's not going to work.

483
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:17,340
They're going to have to do that thing where they forward you to Google and it pops up

484
00:27:17,340 --> 00:27:20,680
a little window, you log in and you say, allow all of the access.

485
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:26,120
The issue is, on Gnome Shell and on Plasma Desktop, that itself is an embedded browser

486
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:27,720
which Google may block.

487
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:29,200
So that's really sticky.

488
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:33,360
Yeah, I mean, Google's side of the story is that they're concerned about phishing attempts.

489
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:37,000
When you've got an embedded browser window, well, it's got access to all your details

490
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:41,360
if you're doing the sign-in process through Google.

491
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:45,280
I can see why that might be a concern, but it's a little bit of a catch-22 that you first

492
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:50,040
have to change your user agent to get any of their sites to work in a reliable fashion,

493
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:53,840
but then here they are saying, if you change your user agent and lie to us, we'll block

494
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:54,840
you.

495
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:56,560
Yeah, that's also grounds for getting blocked.

496
00:27:56,560 --> 00:28:00,960
And that's really a shame because, going back to Epiphany again, the developer there has

497
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:06,480
just stopped declaring its Epiphany in its user agent string for compatibility reasons.

498
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:07,480
That's just it.

499
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:10,060
Now, I think if they were willing to keep that in there, from Google's perspective,

500
00:28:10,060 --> 00:28:12,240
they're not trying to block major supported browsers.

501
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:17,720
In fact, they call it out that they will continue to support things like Firefox, but I think

502
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:21,360
they're missing the point that for many of their applications, that's a substandard experience

503
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:22,360
already.

504
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:28,800
Michael summarizes this email that he's sent to the WebKit developer list, trying to just

505
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:30,480
remind everybody about this impending doom.

506
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:32,840
He says, what should WebKit do about this?

507
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:35,040
He goes on to say, I don't know.

508
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:40,660
Nothing has happened yet, so I guess we could wait and see what happens on January 4th.

509
00:28:40,660 --> 00:28:41,940
Maybe this won't affect us at all.

510
00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:48,000
But my fear is that January 4th will arrive, we will be blocked, and then more user agent

511
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,980
quirks and fixes will not work.

512
00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:54,800
And even if WebKit is not blocked, we can be confident that on January 4th, we will

513
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:57,880
see a sad day for browser diversity.

514
00:28:57,880 --> 00:28:58,880
That's just it.

515
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:02,400
This is a terrible reminder, regardless of what happens, that Google controls a whole

516
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:05,000
bunch of the internet and the way you get to the internet.

517
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,640
It's not how it's supposed to work, man.

518
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:08,040
It's not how the web works.

519
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:09,040
Not my web.

520
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:10,040
No way.

521
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:12,880
So we'll see what happens, January 4th is the deadline.

522
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:16,320
And like I like to say on this program, we'll keep an eye on it.

523
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:21,380
And that's why you should head over to LinuxActionNews.com slash subscribe for all the ways to get those

524
00:29:21,380 --> 00:29:22,480
future episodes.

525
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:25,320
And while you're there, go over to the contact page, there's a link at the top of the site

526
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:27,600
and send us your feedback on the show.

527
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:30,920
Also, check out self-hosted.show slash 32.

528
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:36,320
We tried out a self-hosted Google Photos replacement that actually works.

529
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:41,520
We'll be back next Monday with our weekly take on the latest Linux and open source news.

530
00:29:41,520 --> 00:30:06,960
Thanks for joining us and we will see you next week.
