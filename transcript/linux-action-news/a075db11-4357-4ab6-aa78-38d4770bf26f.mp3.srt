00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,800
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, episode 137, recorded on December 20th, 2019.

2
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:10,800
I'm Chris.

3
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:11,800
And I'm Joe.

4
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:12,800
Hello, Joe.

5
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:16,560
Good to be connected with you and great to start out with some news from Firefox and

6
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:20,440
an update to their DNS over HTTPS support.

7
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:24,280
Yeah, they've added another partner called NextDNS.

8
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:29,760
So now you don't have to use Cloudflare if you want to use DNS over HTTPS.

9
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:32,200
Have you ever heard of NextDNS before this?

10
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:35,360
No, I was hoping you may have done.

11
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:36,640
I did a little digging.

12
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:39,560
So they launched in March of 2019.

13
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:41,340
So this year as we record.

14
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:45,860
But they're sort of one of these newer up and coming fancier, a lot more features kind

15
00:00:45,860 --> 00:00:52,040
of DNS provider and DNS over HTTPS or DOE as Joe likes to call it, has been one of their

16
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:58,260
major focuses for pushing out different apps to Android, iOS, I think these old legacy

17
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:01,000
desktops called Linux and Windows and Mac OS.

18
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,920
Not familiar with those, of course, because it's only about mobile, right?

19
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:08,980
But Cloudflare is like the name, you know, I know Cloudflare and I have to be honest

20
00:01:08,980 --> 00:01:16,040
that that consumer brand trust thing inside me when I see these two next to each other

21
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:19,120
sort of trust the Cloudflare name a little more.

22
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:23,200
But looking at NextDNS, they seem like a pretty, pretty cool company.

23
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:26,840
And of course, they agreed to Mozilla's privacy requirements.

24
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:28,960
Which are pretty stringent.

25
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:30,800
So that's kind of a good sign.

26
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:37,200
I think I see what you're saying about Cloudflare being the name, you know, and this NextDNS

27
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,320
company, we don't really know anything about them.

28
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:42,440
But I don't think it's particularly important who they are.

29
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:46,740
I think what's far more important is that there now is a choice.

30
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:50,640
And this will hopefully open the gates for even more choice.

31
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:51,640
Well put.

32
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:55,180
And I you know, I like to remind people when we do talk about this, there are self hosted

33
00:01:55,180 --> 00:02:01,000
open source DNS over HTTPS DNS servers, you can run now and you could manually enter it

34
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
in there.

35
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
But it's nice to see it baked in.

36
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,120
We've seen pretty quick adoption of DOA this year.

37
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:08,720
It feels like only a few months ago, we started talking about it.

38
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:11,640
And now you can already use it in Firefox and Chrome.

39
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:13,360
I know I was thinking that too.

40
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:18,200
And Mozilla has sort of positioned itself as an advocate for the technology, which has

41
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:19,400
been fascinating.

42
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:25,640
But it also speaks to how fast Firefox is moving, how fast these features are getting

43
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:26,640
out to end users.

44
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:30,360
It's been a pretty good year for Firefox, generally, and Mozilla, there have been a

45
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:36,320
few hiccups, but I think I'm pretty positive about them going into 2020.

46
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:38,560
Well said, I think it's been really nice to see.

47
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:44,080
It's been one of the highlights of 2019, really, which we'll get more into in a future episode.

48
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:46,320
But let's talk about something a little more near term.

49
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:54,360
Apple, Google, and Amazon are joining forces, yes, cats and dogs are joining forces to rally

50
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:57,920
behind a new smart home standard called Chip.

51
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:02,320
Now this is somewhat open source, but I've seen quite a lot of skepticism about this.

52
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:04,500
This is really your area.

53
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:07,040
So I'm very keen to hear what you think about this.

54
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:09,460
Yeah, there are some interesting things we'll get into here.

55
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:14,040
But admit it, Joe, the first thing you thought of was that ex-KCD comic of all we need is

56
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:15,040
another standard.

57
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:19,560
Yeah, by trying to unify standards, you end up just creating yet another one.

58
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:22,320
And that does feel like what we're going to end up with here.

59
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:26,960
But maybe that new standard will actually be better than the other ones.

60
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:28,160
It sounds really promising.

61
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:34,260
But those companies all working together on a new standard, even though Apple just open

62
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:41,120
source bits of HomeKit and the Z-Wave folks raised their hands and said, we could do some

63
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:45,280
open sourcing too, but Chip offers something unique.

64
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:51,320
Well it's all IP based and using IPv6, so maybe that means that it might solve some

65
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:53,220
of your double net issues.

66
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:58,520
Not only that, but it takes advantage of any existing network infrastructure you have.

67
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:04,640
So in the case of a Z-Wave home automation network, the Z-Wave radios sort of form a

68
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:05,860
mesh network.

69
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:10,180
And you can have some Z-Wave devices that are boosters and repeaters of the network.

70
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:15,100
But if a device can't talk to the other devices, you have a dead spot in your network.

71
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:19,760
In this case, you could extend a Wi-Fi network, you could drop an Ethernet and get IP to a

72
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:23,820
device and they can participate in the overall smart network.

73
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:27,820
But additionally, Chip allows for fallback to different physical mediums.

74
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:33,760
It can use Bluetooth LE, it has support for cellular, it even understands DSL and DSL

75
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:36,760
authentication for types of ISPs that require that.

76
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:42,520
The thing that Chip allows for is leveraging off-the-shelf network infrastructure.

77
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:46,920
And that means the cost in manufacturing goes way down and the availability to consumers

78
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:48,720
goes way up.

79
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:53,420
Overall I'm very skeptical about this, but I like the ideas behind it.

80
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:57,980
And the fact that it got Apple to open source bits of HomeKit and the Z-Wave folks to open

81
00:04:57,980 --> 00:05:03,120
source their implementation, it seems like a real big net win for the Home Assistant

82
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:05,800
community and other automation communities.

83
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:09,840
Presumably the reason that Apple and Google and Amazon are interested in this is because

84
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:14,840
they want to drive more adoption of their various voice assistants.

85
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:20,160
But my question is, is this going to mean more self-hosting and more being able to hack

86
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:25,360
stuff and not have to rely on the cloud and be able to keep it all within your network

87
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:29,360
or maybe going out to servers that you are in control of elsewhere?

88
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:35,680
I think it's hard to say overall because it will likely come down to each device's implementation

89
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:40,480
if that vendor locks it into a cloud service or something like that.

90
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:46,720
However, open sourcing of Z-Wave, bits of HomeKit and this new chip standard that they

91
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:53,840
say will also be open source and posted on GitHub surely means great things for communities

92
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:59,640
that are trying to accomplish those types of things, like the Home Assistant community.

93
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:02,880
I'm actually a pretty big fan of HomeKit.

94
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:03,880
It's so silly.

95
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:10,480
I hate it because it's, until maybe just now, been sort of a thing of just the Apple iOS

96
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:11,480
ecosystem.

97
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:16,480
And if you don't have iOS devices, it's silly to buy a HomeKit smart plug and a HomeKit

98
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:19,240
Lite and a HomeKit LED strip.

99
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:20,240
Why would you spend money on that?

100
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:21,760
You don't have an iOS device.

101
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:27,480
But the HomeKit protocol itself and the little mechanisms and devices around it are really

102
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:28,480
great.

103
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:29,880
It supports IP and Wi-Fi.

104
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:34,200
It supports Bluetooth LE, which means you can incorporate battery-powered sensors and

105
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:40,760
motion sensors and all kinds of little devices throughout your home, as well as bigger devices.

106
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:42,460
And it's all over the LAN.

107
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:44,240
No cloud service required.

108
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:48,080
You could unplug from the internet and still operate all your smart devices.

109
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:52,900
And it's really easy and user-friendly, like a lot of Apple stuff is.

110
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:57,600
And like a lot of Apple stuff, it's locked to their ecosystem until maybe now.

111
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:01,240
And Home Assistant has really nailed their HomeKit implementation already.

112
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:02,640
So this could take it to the next level.

113
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:06,940
As far as where I'm sitting, I think this is going to make my setup way, way better.

114
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:12,160
Even if this chip stuff doesn't go anywhere, and just the improvements with HomeKit being

115
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:18,560
better documented and Z-Wave going open source would be a huge win and are going to be great

116
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:19,880
for 2020 development.

117
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:24,840
Well, having briefly spoken to Alex about it, he seems pretty skeptical as well.

118
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:29,360
But we'll have to see if we hear more about this on Self-Hosted in 2020.

119
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:32,000
Yeah, and I'll conclude with this.

120
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:37,100
Smart home automation is so much more than these smart tubes and the ecosystems that

121
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:41,740
Google and Amazon and Apple make available.

122
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:42,960
That's what this is really about.

123
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:50,020
This is about fulfilling the promise of complete low-power device smart home automation that

124
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:52,440
Z-Wave and ZigBee help accomplish now.

125
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:57,880
There are entire automation ecosystems that are way outside the smart speaker ecosystems

126
00:07:57,880 --> 00:08:01,940
that are featureful and have been around for years.

127
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:05,680
And so if your idea of smart home automation is one of these smart tubes, I think it's

128
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:11,240
worth looking at some YouTube videos or listening to Self-Hosted to see what else is out there.

129
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:15,520
Because if you're into everything on your land, nothing goes out to the cloud, it's

130
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:21,480
all under your control, we have some really great coverage in the Self-Hosted program,

131
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:22,480
Self-Hosted.

132
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:25,840
Yeah, even though I'm tempted, I might have to give it a go next year at some point.

133
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:30,680
Something I've been intending to play with and is even more appealing now is multi-pass

134
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:36,160
and Canonical has reached 1.0 of the mini cloud on your workstation.

135
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:42,960
Yeah, this one point I was coming just a week after the 0.9, which is a bit strange.

136
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:48,460
But what's interesting about it is that it manages your virtual machines using the native

137
00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:50,680
hypervisor on whatever platform you're using.

138
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:56,340
So KVM on Linux, Hyper-V on Windows, and HyperKit on Mac OS.

139
00:08:56,340 --> 00:09:01,240
So this is just going to work no matter what development environment you want to use.

140
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:07,320
The virtualizer is just a detail now that you don't even need to concern yourself with.

141
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:08,520
Multi-pass will handle it for you.

142
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:13,480
This is really kind of a Canonical slash Ubuntu focused approach, being able to just quickly

143
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:15,140
fire up a VM and get to work.

144
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:18,920
You want to test something or try something or have an idea.

145
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:21,780
Why even putz around with the KVM setups?

146
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:25,120
Why mess with your virtual boxes or your Hyper-Vs when you could just use multi-pass?

147
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:27,040
I really like the idea.

148
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:30,880
And if I was building a lot of Ubuntu VMs on a regular basis and integrating updates

149
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:33,920
and things like this, this would probably be a go to tool.

150
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:35,700
Or imagine doing development testing with this.

151
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:38,060
You can fire up a quick multi-pass environment.

152
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:42,320
And if you're a developer, maybe you don't know how to get the KVMs on your old Linux

153
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,320
box.

154
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:44,640
This will take care of it for you.

155
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:51,080
It feels like bumping this to a 1.0 release is just another little duck getting into a

156
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:53,360
row for Canonical.

157
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:59,140
They've done a lot this year to get everything onto that professional level.

158
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:03,880
And now they can say that it's a 1.0 stable for multi-pass.

159
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:07,600
It feels like a small part of a much bigger picture to me.

160
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:08,600
Yeah, perhaps.

161
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:12,520
I think too, when you look at the Mac OS support, that's interesting.

162
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:19,560
To me, it looks like telling a story of full platform developer support.

163
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:23,040
Whatever platform they're on, we've got a quick way for them to create VMs.

164
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,200
Oh, you're on Windows?

165
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:29,760
Why don't you also try out Ubuntu on the Windows subsystem for Linux as well?

166
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:31,380
They've really nailed that.

167
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:36,560
We have something that's approachable by developers for just about any platform they want, even

168
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:38,440
if it's Mac, even if it's Windows.

169
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:42,160
I remember at the beginning of this decade, Shot of Worth talking about wanting to get

170
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:46,120
Ubuntu everywhere on TVs and fridges and stuff like that.

171
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:50,840
And the reality is that Ubuntu kind of is everywhere now, but not necessarily for the

172
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:53,080
consumer, at least not in their face.

173
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:56,840
But it's everywhere for developers and everywhere in the cloud.

174
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:57,840
Whoa.

175
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:59,400
You just blew my mind, Joe.

176
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:00,400
And you're right.

177
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:06,960
And what's kind of cooler about this way it turned out is it's not necessarily exclusive

178
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:07,960
to Ubuntu.

179
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:16,480
Like a TV deal with say LG had chosen Ubuntu instead of WebOS for their smart televisions.

180
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:18,860
That's not something Fedora could approach necessarily.

181
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:19,860
That's locked in.

182
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:20,860
They got it.

183
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:21,860
They got it.

184
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:24,720
Probably a multi-year agreement, special R&D relationship, et cetera, et cetera.

185
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:28,160
But this kind of stuff is they built it and they got there.

186
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:30,960
They took the Windows subsystem seriously.

187
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:32,740
They built tools for developers.

188
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:36,240
They've targeted the cloud platforms very aggressively.

189
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:40,420
They've tried to make it easy to get going and start writing applications on their platform

190
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:42,240
wherever you're at.

191
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:48,060
And they didn't have to do it with any kind of crazy contracts or lock-in or anything

192
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:51,040
that's dirty play or a special advantage.

193
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:55,080
They just did it based on the quality of the product and the demand from developers.

194
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:56,880
So you got to respect it.

195
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:57,880
And you're right.

196
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:58,880
They are kind of lining everything up.

197
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:00,840
They're getting a real complete picture here now.

198
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:05,760
There's been a bit going on with KDE over the last week and some good news for Krita.

199
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:12,160
And very good news from the folks at Epic, the makers of the Unreal game engine.

200
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:18,280
They have given Krita a $25,000 what they call mega grant.

201
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:22,480
And this follows recent money that went to Blender and then Lutris before this.

202
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:28,960
Yeah, but the amount that they gave to Blender was $1.2 million as opposed to $25,000 to

203
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:29,960
Krita.

204
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:32,800
So it's kind of a different scale.

205
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:33,800
Yeah.

206
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:39,360
So if I'm looking at it from Epic's standpoint, Blender is likely a more vital tool in the

207
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:41,720
model creation for games, right?

208
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:48,000
Whereas Krita could be more of it's art, it's touch up, it's cover art, but it's not necessarily

209
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,320
core to game creation.

210
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:52,080
Where Blender, you could create worlds in that thing.

211
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:54,120
And it is definitely going to help.

212
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:57,000
And it's also a good promotion for Krita.

213
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
It's good publicity.

214
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,520
I mean, we're talking about it.

215
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:00,520
Yeah.

216
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:04,680
And one of the things I find fascinating is it's one of those awkward fields that we have

217
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:10,400
found ourselves in over and over again in 2019 and that is commercial company that has

218
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:15,600
crazy app store or does crazy practices and has really, really commercial practices or

219
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:16,600
whatever it could be.

220
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:20,480
You know, there's, there's several examples of these Microsoft anyways, and then they

221
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:24,260
do something really great and you're like, Oh, and then they do something really great

222
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:30,000
again and then again and you go, Oh man, now I like, I kind of like challenge my assumptions

223
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,760
about a lot of things.

224
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:33,040
This is really weird.

225
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:35,200
And that's why I find these stories fascinating.

226
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:37,320
What about this Kubuntu powered laptop then?

227
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:38,320
Yeah.

228
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:39,320
What about this thing?

229
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:40,320
How about this?

230
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:45,880
A laptop that will sell preloaded with Kubuntu on it.

231
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:49,640
And in the Phronix article that we'll link to that Michael Arpo wrote up, he says they're

232
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:55,120
going to get quote, a significant contribution from each laptop sold to the Kubuntu council.

233
00:13:55,120 --> 00:14:01,280
It looks like it's a Clevo P960 RD with some alterations to improve the Linux experience.

234
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:07,160
It's got a Nvidia RTX card in there and an Intel I7-9750H.

235
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:08,160
Yeah.

236
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:10,920
And 32 gigabytes of RAM.

237
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:12,720
And you are going to pay for all of that.

238
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:13,720
Yeah.

239
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:14,720
What do you suppose the prices is?

240
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:19,120
I went and priced the stock Clevo model and it started around $1,500.

241
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:24,840
Well, we don't know for sure yet, but from a post in the Phronix forums by Michael Mikowski,

242
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:31,760
who says he's the director of this project, he says that it's going to be $2,400, which

243
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:34,320
is pretty pricey.

244
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:38,760
But then for that spec, it's only a markup of about $300, he reckons.

245
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:42,560
And they have done a lot of work to optimize it and make everything work.

246
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:47,300
I could really see why distributions would want to monetize a little bit by selling a

247
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:50,240
hardware experience where they can put a little extra effort into it.

248
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:53,740
I don't know how much involvement the Kubuntu project had here, but I like to fantasize

249
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:59,240
about elementary OS pre-shipping on an XPS 13 type of piece of hardware and how nice

250
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:03,080
that experience would be and how if they were to work on a little bit, they could really

251
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:04,440
nail it.

252
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:06,360
But you got to wonder how these programs are going to work.

253
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:11,780
I believe this particular Kubuntu focus laptop is backed by Tuxedo.

254
00:15:11,780 --> 00:15:16,800
So in theory, Tuxedo would be doing the support, but I'd like to know how that's going to work

255
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:20,320
because I could see this happening for more and more distributions as time goes on.

256
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:26,040
If I'm going to spend $2,400 on a one-off laptop like this, especially when it's the

257
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:30,740
first one they've ever done, I'm really curious what that support story looks like two years

258
00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:33,240
down the road when I need to replace the keyboard or something.

259
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:36,720
Well, I've heard very mixed things about Tuxedo computers.

260
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:38,080
Some people say that they're good.

261
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:42,960
I know that they shipped a review unit to the Ubuntu podcast and those guys were not

262
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:46,120
impressed at all with that, but that was a while ago.

263
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:49,080
So hopefully they've improved things since then.

264
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:52,840
I'm not sure how much of a market there's going to be for this because at that kind

265
00:15:52,840 --> 00:16:00,200
of price, there's a lot of competition and yes, it's going to support Kubuntu and a Linux

266
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:04,440
first vendor, but are people really going to go for it?

267
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:05,440
I don't know.

268
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:06,440
Yeah, we'll see.

269
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:12,400
I think one of my favorite things about Linux is that I can load it on all of my computers,

270
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:15,760
whereas Mac OS seems so limited because it can only be installed on Macs.

271
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:20,520
It seems crazy that my primary operating system could only be installed on certain hardware.

272
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:26,280
So I don't know if I really like this line anyways, this idea, but for new users, I could

273
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:27,280
see it appealing.

274
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:32,840
The fact of the matter is Plasma is great and I'd love to see more computers shipping

275
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:34,440
with Plasma as default.

276
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:38,800
Well, Plasma is hopefully going to get even better thanks to a competition that KDE have

277
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:43,520
launched to make promotional videos and more papers for them and the prizes are a couple

278
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:45,340
of Tuxedo computers.

279
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:47,200
This is a fun approach they're taking.

280
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:49,600
I've been involved with some of these promotional videos.

281
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:55,000
I've done two or three of them for the project when they had new releases, but I think it's

282
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,640
always kind of a cram because somebody in the project has to animate the video, then

283
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:01,720
they got to get me a script and I record it and send it back to them and then they got

284
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:04,040
to time the music and all of that.

285
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:07,560
So this idea here is maybe there's people out there in the community that just love

286
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:13,200
doing video and could put together a great promotional video to talk about the 5.18 release,

287
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:18,160
which sounds like it's really shaping up to be a very good release.

288
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:22,560
So they'd love to really promote it and want to have a few people submit and see which

289
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:23,560
one's the best.

290
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:25,000
I like that idea a lot.

291
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,260
The wallpapers one, that's always fun, you know, whatever.

292
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:31,000
But that video thing, I think that's a good idea.

293
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:35,120
I think when new releases come out that have a bunch of really hard work put into them,

294
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:40,280
doing something in video helps people understand the improvements from one release to the other.

295
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:44,640
When you're going from 5.17 to 5.18, but you've made dramatic improvements and changed a lot

296
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:48,680
of defaults, it's nice to illustrate that when a version number just doesn't.

297
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:53,440
What do you think about the rule that you've got to use free software to make the video?

298
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:55,440
Well, I would use KDE in live.

299
00:17:55,440 --> 00:18:00,160
So I mean, that's not so bad.

300
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:04,860
I'm not big on telling people what tools to use to express themselves.

301
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:07,000
I'm more of a whatever tool works for you.

302
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,140
These ones happen to be the best for me and I'd love to tell you about them kind of guy,

303
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:13,440
but you must use my tool kind of guy.

304
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:18,120
But you know, I guess it's for an open source project, right?

305
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:24,760
And what better way to test these things out, work out the kinks than to dog food them like

306
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:25,760
this?

307
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:28,040
So in this instance, I think it kind of works.

308
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:29,040
What do you think?

309
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:33,880
Yeah, I can kind of understand why they want to have the assets and the source files, presumably

310
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:36,960
so that they can tweak them a little bit if necessary.

311
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:43,560
So that's one justification for it, although it does feel a little bit elitist, maybe.

312
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:48,760
Maybe you've got great skills on a Mac with Final Cut or whatever, and you could create

313
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:52,080
this great promotional video for them.

314
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:58,280
It just seems a little bit like they're excluding potential creators.

315
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:01,600
But I do understand the thinking behind it, especially if they want the assets.

316
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:05,480
Yeah, and if they could somehow package all those assets up and then somebody else could

317
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:10,140
work on them next time for the next release, then it sort of even continues to increase

318
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:13,640
in value and sort of solidify why they would make that decision.

319
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:17,560
It's their call at the end of the day, and it's their contest, but I think you and I

320
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:20,080
sort of see it more eye to eye on that one.

321
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:23,820
I'm not so sure we're so eye to eye on the Atari VCS.

322
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:25,440
Maybe I'm just a hopeful diehard.

323
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:29,600
Yeah, we're seeing a blog post from Atari this week on Medium.

324
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,920
Am I wrong about Medium?

325
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:35,400
You open it and it's just suddenly full screen pop ups and you can't see anything.

326
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:36,400
Hey, Joe.

327
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:37,400
Hey, Joe.

328
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:38,400
Can I tell you about the newsletter?

329
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:41,400
God, I hate that.

330
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:46,440
I'm so glad that Elementary moved off Medium.

331
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:53,320
But anyway, so this blog post is pretty much saying, hey, let's create some content, everyone,

332
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:54,320
for the VCS.

333
00:19:54,320 --> 00:20:00,200
It's coming soon, and be sure to use Unity Engine and all the standard tools, please.

334
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:06,120
Well, you can use some of the built-in stuff that comes with Debian as well, but they are

335
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:08,400
kind of putting Unity first here.

336
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:12,040
Creators can start developing games and apps for the Atari VCS right now, they write, with

337
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:14,000
the Unity tools.

338
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,640
Now, that's all good.

339
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:17,640
That's fine.

340
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:22,560
You know, when I backed this project, besides just feeling slightly nostalgic and they got

341
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:29,400
me there, but much like why I backed Stadia, I'm not even a big gamer.

342
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:36,800
But I really believe in encouraging development of games on Linux and encouraging the ecosystem

343
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:41,200
to keep Linux a viable gaming platform, to keep Vulkan working great, to stay on top

344
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:45,320
of the underlying sound systems and the graphic systems, and to keep pressure on our display

345
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:48,000
servers to stay competitive.

346
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Gaming has a lot of ancillary benefits, even when you're primarily using it as a workstation

347
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,800
like I do, who sometimes I like to game, you know.

348
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:59,180
But as a guy who's using his computer in the most part, I'm not gaming.

349
00:20:59,180 --> 00:21:04,320
But I back these things because I do see it has a bigger picture impact.

350
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:09,920
When I see that they're just targeting Unity, it's nice to see.

351
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:13,280
I mean, it still means like Mesa and the other stuff underlying has to be working and the

352
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:17,840
Vulkan drivers and all that, but it's not quite like it is with Stadia, where the game

353
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:21,400
has to be essentially hoarded to Linux to work on the platform.

354
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:25,840
This is not quite what I was hoping my money would be used for, but I knew that was part

355
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:26,840
of the risk.

356
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:30,000
But what we're going to end up with here, or what you're going to end up with, because

357
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:36,880
you've bought it, is essentially just a Linux PC in a nice Atari looking case.

358
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:40,880
And anything that is going to work on it, any content, games and apps and anything like

359
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:45,920
that, are going to have to work on Debian because that's what the operating system is

360
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:46,920
running on.

361
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:53,160
And the more they kind of pull back on their promises of developing all of this custom

362
00:21:53,160 --> 00:22:00,120
software and the more they rely on standard distributions and standard sets of software,

363
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:04,800
the more of a generic Linux box it's going to be, which makes it less exciting, but it

364
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:10,040
means that if they can leverage that Atari brand to get developers onto the platform,

365
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:12,400
then they're just getting them onto a standard Linux platform.

366
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,920
And okay, if they're using Unity, fair enough.

367
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:20,200
At least those games are going to work on Linux and porting them to other distributions

368
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:23,560
is presumably and hopefully going to be fairly straightforward.

369
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:28,040
I thought they were using Ubuntu, but it seems to have switched to Debian a fair bit ago.

370
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:29,040
Absolutely.

371
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:32,440
That's my optimistic take on it, which is why I'm surprised to hear you see it that

372
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:33,440
way.

373
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:34,440
But that's what I'm hoping.

374
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:41,400
Although there is sort of a detail in this whole post that I think belays where things

375
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:43,560
are actually going to get a little gray.

376
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:46,880
So they write about this whole thing like just target Unity, just target Linux and you're

377
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:47,960
good to go.

378
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:52,560
You can expect a large majority of Linux compatible content to be fully compatible with the Atari

379
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:55,320
VCS, quote.

380
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:59,960
Sounds like if you write it for Unity and for Linux, it's going to work on the VCS except

381
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:03,680
for that one detail that they haven't gone into yet.

382
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:08,360
Stay tuned for more information, they say, including a link for registration for our

383
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:12,280
developer certification program.

384
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:19,720
Users will need to upload their programs to the Atari VCS submission portal for approval.

385
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:23,880
If they blow this aspect and the fact that they don't have their crap together already

386
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:28,240
with clear rules on what's going to work, what's not going to work, where the boundaries

387
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:33,080
are and what it takes to get approved, the fact that they don't have that already is

388
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:34,940
a big red flag.

389
00:23:34,940 --> 00:23:39,360
They can't come out here and tell you to start porting for their platform, but not tell you

390
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:41,220
what the rules of the field are.

391
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:44,620
That's ridiculous and it's a bad sign.

392
00:23:44,620 --> 00:23:47,520
And God only knows what those requirements are going to be.

393
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:54,480
So why would anyone start working on an application or a game for this platform without knowing

394
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:55,480
what those requirements are?

395
00:23:55,480 --> 00:24:01,840
That is a very good point, but the way I read it was that it's more of a formality really.

396
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:06,980
It's just to keep out those really dreadful games where you just do all sorts of terrible

397
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:12,440
things and real not-safe-for-work stuff and just to make sure that there is at least some

398
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:16,600
barrier of entry, some correlation happening here.

399
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:20,780
That has been essentially the implication, but now is the time where you got to put it

400
00:24:20,780 --> 00:24:21,780
down into writing.

401
00:24:21,780 --> 00:24:26,280
Make it clear because now you're asking for developers to spend their time porting their

402
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:30,420
application to Linux or whatever it might take, even if that's just for some people

403
00:24:30,420 --> 00:24:33,920
checking a box in Unity and then testing it, they still need to know.

404
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:34,920
It's still worth their time.

405
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:38,280
Unless they have to understand what the upside is for them.

406
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:41,240
Now they're making a pretty sweet royalty deal here.

407
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:48,280
Developers will receive 88% royalty on all Atari VCS exclusive titles or 80% royalty

408
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:50,280
on non-exclusive titles.

409
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:54,780
That's still very generous, 80% royalty on non-exclusive titles.

410
00:24:54,780 --> 00:24:58,380
That's of course just for ones that are approved and then placed in the VCS store.

411
00:24:58,380 --> 00:25:04,440
So they could get this, a nice looking box, goes in the living room, has a good Linux

412
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:05,440
OS underneath it.

413
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:10,400
So there's always future potential and a good GUI with Atari branding and an Atari store

414
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:15,360
that makes it easy to get this stuff at a reasonable price with reasonable store rules.

415
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:18,480
It could work for folks like myself and Holder.

416
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:20,680
I could see the appeal.

417
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:23,240
It's just going to come down to those rules now and they got to get them out there as

418
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:24,240
fast as possible.

419
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:27,040
So that way everybody understands what the rules of the field are.

420
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:31,320
Well, we're not doing our predictions for a couple of episodes, but let's do a quick

421
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:32,800
bonus one here.

422
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:38,200
Prediction, do you think that you will receive your VCS in 2020?

423
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:39,200
I do.

424
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:40,200
I do think I will.

425
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:41,200
Yes.

426
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:42,200
All right.

427
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:43,200
I'm going to say that you won't then.

428
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:44,200
Really?

429
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:47,320
I say because they've made this thing just a standard PC now, it really comes down to

430
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:51,200
the UI on top of Linux and getting the case all dialed in.

431
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:55,560
And then the rest is all on the services side, app store, developers, relationships, but

432
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:56,560
the hardware could ship.

433
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:59,520
It might not ship with a lot of games, but I think the hardware is pretty close.

434
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:00,520
Yeah.

435
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:02,760
You can install a proper Linux distro on it then, eh?

436
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:06,520
I mean, Debian would be pretty great, but I'd love to, I mean, if nothing else, just

437
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:09,520
use it as a Linux box for a little while and then have it as a keepsake.

438
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:15,120
I have a couple of classic computers that to me are iconic and that would be one of

439
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:16,120
them.

440
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:17,120
What a crazy idea.

441
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:21,980
I just feel like it's, if nothing else, I'll just appreciate it as a museum piece one day.

442
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:24,080
But if I ever do get it, I'll let you know.

443
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:26,720
And of course, if anything else develops in the world, we'll be covering it.
