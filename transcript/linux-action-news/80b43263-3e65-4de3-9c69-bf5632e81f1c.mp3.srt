00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, our weekly take on Linux and the open source world.

2
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,100
This is episode 22, recorded on October 8th, 2017.

3
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:21,100
I'm Chris.

4
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:22,100
And I'm Joe.

5
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:23,100
Hello, Joe.

6
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:27,000
I don't know if you were glued to your computer screen this week, but in case you missed it,

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,680
Google had some new announcements.

8
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:33,080
Yeah, they've announced loads of new expensive hardware that I'm never going to buy.

9
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:36,480
I suppose it's not on my purchase list either, not at the moment.

10
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:40,920
I could come back and look at some of these things in the future, but the main pieces

11
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:46,300
of hardware, the Pixel 2 and the Pixel 2 XL, are not necessarily calling to me, but they

12
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:49,520
seem like pretty competitive upgrades for people that are looking for that Google-like

13
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:50,520
phone experience.

14
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:57,320
Yeah, they look good, front-facing speakers, nice display, nice specs and everything, USB-C,

15
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:59,040
but then, what?

16
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:00,040
No!

17
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:01,880
No headphone jack!

18
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:02,880
Yep.

19
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:05,640
Welcome to the no headphone jack reality.

20
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:10,380
And I think the XL looks a little better than the regular Pixel 2.

21
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:13,880
You're going to have 64 and 128 gigabyte options.

22
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:15,880
Both will ship with 4 gigs of RAM.

23
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:16,880
And this is interesting.

24
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:18,620
Get ready for this, iPhone users.

25
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:24,160
The XL and the regular Pixel have the same camera, processor and speaker specs.

26
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:30,640
Yeah, it's a 12.2 megapixel rear camera with autofocus, with a laser to assist in autofocus,

27
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:35,720
and they have something that sounds really fancy, and both the front and the rear cameras

28
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:36,940
have this.

29
00:01:36,940 --> 00:01:39,720
They have side-by-side pixel technology.

30
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:40,720
Yeah.

31
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:41,720
Are you ready for this?

32
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:45,900
So instead of needing two camera lenses, the new Pixel phones, because the camera image

33
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:51,720
sensor has pixels that are side-by-side, in fact, just mere microns apart, my friends,

34
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:57,360
that they can get the two lens setup that you have in the iPhone X and the iPhone 8

35
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:00,600
Plus in a one lens camera.

36
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:06,100
As usual, Google, a software company, I suppose you would say, have decided to solve the problem

37
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:07,800
with software instead of hardware.

38
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:08,800
Right.

39
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:09,800
You have to say machine learning, Joe.

40
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:12,800
I don't know if you noticed, but you got to say that at least every 35 seconds.

41
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:13,800
Yeah.

42
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:18,720
Well, that was the overarching theme here throughout all of the products that they announced,

43
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,720
is that they are packed full of machine learning.

44
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:26,520
Lots of machine learning, yes, and AI on top of machine learning, which is just, it gets

45
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:30,920
a little old after a bit, but I did some digging, and I think legitimately you can call this

46
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:32,320
stuff machine learning.

47
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:36,960
They are looking at the scene in the imagery and using machine learning to determine what

48
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:41,640
should be in focus and what should be in the background, and by doing this, they can derive

49
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:46,040
what they call portrait mode, and they can make some really impressive images from some

50
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:47,880
really shallow glass.

51
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:53,080
And I have to give them the nod, they seem to have the best camera setup in the 2017

52
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:54,200
smartphone line right now.

53
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:58,560
Yeah, maybe, but just those prices, if you want to pay that much for a phone, buy an

54
00:02:58,560 --> 00:02:59,560
iPhone surely.

55
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:00,560
Maybe so.

56
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:04,000
The whole point of Android is it's cheaper.

57
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
That's always been the case.

58
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,400
There's got to be some folks out there, Joe, that want that pure Android experience, and

59
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:10,520
that's what the Pixel brings.

60
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:13,880
It's more of a Google phone than it really is even an Android phone.

61
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:15,200
It's the Google phone now.

62
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:18,080
But like both you and I said, I'm skipping this one for now.

63
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:21,400
The Pixel 2, while it looks good, I think the action's going to be in the Pixel 3.

64
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:25,000
Google recently hired thousands of engineers from HTC.

65
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,240
They're incorporating them into the Android team, and I think a lot of that skill's going

66
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:31,320
to land in the Pixel 3.

67
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:34,880
But for those of you that are looking to buy the Pixel 2, the 64 gigabyte version will

68
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:44,160
cost you 650 US greenbacks right now, while the Pixel 2 XL, 64 gig, will cost 850 US greenbacks.

69
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:46,800
And no headphone jack.

70
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:49,680
I hate to say it again, but this is big.

71
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:53,220
Last time with the Pixel, they made a big thing about we've got a headphone jack, whereas

72
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:55,400
now they're just giving in.

73
00:03:55,400 --> 00:04:01,480
And if the next Samsung phone, the next generation, doesn't come with a headphone jack, then it's

74
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:03,000
finished.

75
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:08,360
And that to me, I sound like some sort of old Luddite or something, but I'm a person

76
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:11,120
who uses Bluetooth constantly.

77
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:16,500
But just the other day, both my Bluetooth adapters died, and I had to plug my headphones

78
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:18,080
in like a caveman.

79
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:21,240
Now I'm not going to do that with a dongle, because I can't find my dongle.

80
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:22,840
Where's it gone?

81
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:27,120
Whereas you've always got that option, and it really, really annoys me and frustrates

82
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:30,680
me that we've had to move this way.

83
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:32,840
But that's the way we're going.

84
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:36,000
And they've got their own answer to AirPods now, aren't they?

85
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Pixel Buds.

86
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,160
Yeah, the Pixel Buds, not a big fan of the name, and not a big fan of the fact that it

87
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:43,040
feels like a derivative Apple product.

88
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:46,580
It feels like they're just copying the AirPods, and they're just checking off a box.

89
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:49,740
They are integrating something though that I don't think the AirPods are going to have

90
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:56,960
anytime soon, and that's Google Translate real time during conversations in your headphones.

91
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:01,200
That is a neat feature, but I have to imagine it's only going to work when you have great

92
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:05,200
connectivity and not a lot of background noise.

93
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:09,720
And for the trade-off of having a wire and all of the other kind of compromises you make

94
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:11,960
with the Pixel Pods, we'll see.

95
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:13,480
I'm sorry, the Pixel Buds.

96
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:14,480
Don't call them the Pixel Pods.

97
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,480
They're the Pixel Buds.

98
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:18,120
Yeah, it's the Babel fish come to life.

99
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,120
It's kind of neat.

100
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,120
That feels like Star Trek.

101
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:23,520
Yeah, it's pretty cool, but it's only going to be available on the Pixel for now, so we'll

102
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:26,400
have to see if that goes to other phones.

103
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:31,280
Did you see Google Clips, the camera that is trained to capture soundless videos, no

104
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:36,320
sound on the videos, and it recognizes pets and other quote-unquote interesting moments

105
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:37,320
in your life.

106
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:41,080
So you put it off on the shelf, just forget that the Google camera is even there, pay

107
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:45,360
no attention, and whenever Google deems that you're doing something interesting, it takes

108
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:46,360
a picture.

109
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:47,360
Or actually, I'm sorry, a video.

110
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:50,560
Yeah, that's not creepy at all, is it?

111
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,600
No, not at all.

112
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:58,480
Okay, and then we're going to move on, but worth noting, the new Pixelbook starts at

113
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:03,800
$1,000 US greenbacks, goes up to $1,700, and when you do that, you get 512 gigabytes of

114
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:11,040
NVMe storage, you get a seventh-generation i7 processor, you get the 12.3-inch high-resolution

115
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:17,120
screen, and Google bills it as the first laptop that has Google Assistant built into it.

116
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:19,280
Well, two things jump out at me.

117
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:22,880
One, why would you need that much storage in a Chromebook?

118
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:25,520
I suppose we'll get to that in a second.

119
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:29,900
And secondly, look at this thing, it looks very old-fashioned with these giant bezels

120
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:32,400
compared to an XPS or whatever.

121
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:33,400
It just looks old-school.

122
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:35,640
Yeah, you're right, it does look old-school.

123
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:39,760
That is quite a thick bezel around it, it's got a keyboard that looks sort of old-school

124
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:40,760
as well.

125
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:44,240
The whole design is a little outdated, but I would say that's true for the Pixels.

126
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:49,320
I think Google this time around has gone for functionality more so than design.

127
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:55,320
At $1,000, with Google Assistant built in, i7 processor, and for another $100, you can

128
00:06:55,320 --> 00:07:01,920
get their Pen, which has been co-developed with Wacom, maybe as a niche product I could

129
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:03,720
see this being successful.

130
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:10,360
But Joe, I'm not particularly optimistic about the chances of any of these products announced.

131
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:17,360
The Pixel, the Pixel AirPod knockoff, the HomePod knockoffs, the Pixelbook, none of

132
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:19,420
it is really competitive.

133
00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:23,240
And I guess kind of this time around it feels like Google sort of just checked everything

134
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:28,320
off, we've revved everything, but none of it really is really compelling to me personally.

135
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:34,440
Well the only thing that's innovative is the Eclipse camera, and that is just creepy.

136
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:40,640
So yeah, Amazon has got the Echo line sewn up and Apple's having their go at it, so I

137
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:45,320
just can't see the Google Home Mini and Max doing particularly well.

138
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:50,420
And this camera thing, yes it's innovative, but it's just creepy.

139
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:55,080
So yeah, and the phones as well, it's niche.

140
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:59,160
The kind of person who wants a pure Android experience and is willing to pay that much

141
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:01,040
for it I think is just niche.

142
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:04,000
People want a Samsung phone or they want an iPhone, it's as simple as that.

143
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,420
So yeah, not particularly confident.

144
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:14,280
But one thing I became aware of this week is CROSVM, CROSVM, I don't know how you pronounce

145
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:15,280
it, but it is-

146
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,280
Pro's VM?

147
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:17,280
Yeah, maybe.

148
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:23,000
It's basically VMs in Chrome OS, so you can potentially, if you know what you're doing,

149
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:29,800
run virtual machines of proper Linux on there, which suddenly makes it far more attractive

150
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,640
for developers.

151
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:36,120
But then again, I don't know, do you really want to spend $1,000 on a machine that the

152
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:40,140
only way to run proper Linux on it is in a VM?

153
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:44,840
And if you want to use it for its proper purpose, it's basically a web browser.

154
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:48,480
I mean, I know it's a little bit more than a web browser these days, but it's still fundamentally

155
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:49,760
a web browser, isn't it?

156
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,680
Yeah, but that could also be its appeal.

157
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:55,760
The simplicity, the utilitarianness of it, the appliance aspect of it.

158
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:59,120
Oh, and by the way, if you need to use some VMs, it can do that too.

159
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:05,120
So this CROSVM or CROSVM, C-R-O-S-V-M, it is essentially KVM, but it's the Chrome OS

160
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:07,240
version of KVM.

161
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:14,800
And it is focused on hyper-virtualization, which doesn't go through the entire hardware stack

162
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:15,880
and emulate it.

163
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:20,040
So it doesn't try to pretend like a disk controller, doesn't try to pretend like a network controller,

164
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:22,800
doesn't try to pretend like it has its own dedicated CPU.

165
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:23,800
It's hyper-virtualized.

166
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:27,920
The drivers are aware that they're in a VM, and they pass directly through the virtualizer

167
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:30,760
to the host operating system.

168
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:32,120
High-performant virtualization here.

169
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:35,060
And that is the exact kind of thing you would want on a Pixelbook.

170
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:41,700
So now you start taking that higher-end storage of the $1,700 Pixelbook with the 512 gig NVMe,

171
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:47,880
and you combine it with CROSVM and the possibility of running an Ubuntu or Fedora or CentOS machine

172
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:52,560
on top of a Chromebook, it starts to become a more useful laptop.

173
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:55,160
And that price point is easier to justify.

174
00:09:55,160 --> 00:10:01,720
Easier, but still, I think if it was kind of like $700, $800, then it would be a much

175
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:02,720
easier sell.

176
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:03,720
Yeah, slam dunk.

177
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:04,720
That's what it would be.

178
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:05,960
It would be a slam dunk.

179
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:09,760
And at this, it's really you taking a bet on the Google ecosystem still.

180
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:13,480
Yeah, I want to see how it does, but it's been a long time since they had a high-end

181
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:15,000
Chromebook.

182
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,260
And that can't have done well, otherwise they would have kept doing it.

183
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:23,480
So they've decided to have another bash at it, but not hugely confident for them, I must

184
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:24,480
say.

185
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:25,480
You and I have said these are niche products.

186
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:26,480
Nobody wants these.

187
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:29,920
Of course, the irony is our audience probably is interested in the Pixel phone.

188
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:33,200
Not so sure about the Pixelbook, but definitely the Pixel phone.

189
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:36,520
And if they're not interested in the Pixel phone, they might be interested in flashing

190
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:39,360
their own ROMs or something like Sailfish X.

191
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:42,120
Yeah, so we talked about this when it was announced.

192
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:45,680
And now it is available to pre-order, I suppose you would say.

193
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:47,640
They'll take your money at this point.

194
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:53,680
So if you've got an Xperia X phone, which I looked into, you can get one in decent condition

195
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:54,680
for £150.

196
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:57,000
So that's not too bad.

197
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,200
Then you can buy the Sailfish ROM from YOLO and flash it.

198
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:03,760
And that is coming in a couple of days, the download for it.

199
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:07,400
So if you're interested in it, now is the time to spend your money.

200
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:11,700
Yeah, and they've expanded support for installation to Windows host systems.

201
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:16,040
So if you run Windows and we're concerned about having to load Linux to get Sailfish

202
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:19,300
X installed on your Sony Xperia X, well, guess what?

203
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:24,920
Now they will just emulate a Linux environment on your Windows host and do it for you.

204
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:28,480
I can't see it being much more than ADB and fast boot, but what do I know?

205
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:29,480
Yeah, it does require Java.

206
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:30,480
I know that.

207
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:31,480
Yeah.

208
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:32,480
I don't see why it would need Java.

209
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:33,480
But there we go.

210
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:34,480
I'm tempted.

211
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:38,440
The fact that it's only £150 for the phone and the fact that there's a paranoid Android

212
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:43,980
ROM available for it, then it makes me think maybe if it had mainline lineage support,

213
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:47,160
so I knew that I could flash that on it afterwards.

214
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:48,560
That would be the sweet spot.

215
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:52,360
Yeah, but it's not on that list, unfortunately.

216
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:56,600
So I don't know what's going on with YOLO, really.

217
00:11:56,600 --> 00:12:03,080
So this is a last-ditch attempt to make some money and pay back the people who bought the

218
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:07,880
tablet on the Kickstarter or whatever it was.

219
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:11,920
I haven't seen as many people interested in this as I thought I would, put it that way,

220
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:12,920
since it was announced.

221
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:13,920
Really?

222
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:15,260
I kind of feel like, okay, you're right.

223
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:18,960
The interest isn't as high as it should be, but I have had a couple of conversations with

224
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:23,200
people that have been like, well, I'm going to just pay it and just do it.

225
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,200
I got a fun development.

226
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,200
I'm going to give it a shot.

227
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,200
Yeah, no big deal.

228
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,200
Just give it a go.

229
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:31,240
Like for them, I think that price point is just it's not too expensive that they're willing

230
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:37,000
to sort of kick that company some money and let them continue development and get a ROM

231
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
in exchange.

232
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,180
And I feel like a lot of people are comfortable with that.

233
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:43,680
And I'm only saying that based on anecdotal conversations I've had with maybe three people.

234
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,320
So take it for a grain of salt.

235
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:49,360
But the three people I've talked to, Joe, that are Sailfish users seem to be on board

236
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:50,360
with it.

237
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:54,120
Yeah, I suppose at $60 or 50 euros, it's not too bad.

238
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:58,920
Yeah, and by talking to those three Sailfish owners or users, I believe I have now surveyed

239
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:04,000
60% of the entire Sailfish market.

240
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,400
Maybe we're all just waiting for Psi-5 to save us.

241
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:07,400
Is that how you say it?

242
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:08,400
Psi-5?

243
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:09,400
Yes.

244
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:10,400
Psi-5, I think is how you pronounce it.

245
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:18,080
That is a company who is just about to release the first 64-bit system on a chip based on

246
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:22,400
the RISC-V architecture, which is completely open source.

247
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:27,040
It is the architecture that ARM should be as far as I'm concerned.

248
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:30,040
It can run completely free software.

249
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:36,040
And this SOC is designed to run Linux out of the box and having four 1.5 gigahertz cores

250
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:40,520
seems like a pretty good start to me and being 64-bit as well.

251
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:42,700
So this is not consumer ready at this point.

252
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:47,200
This is released to manufacturers and it's quite expensive to buy it, to develop for

253
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,200
it.

254
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:54,040
I've been watching this story for a couple of years now develop because it is to me very

255
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:57,600
important that we have something that can run free software top to bottom.

256
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:00,560
And obviously we've talked about Purism, what they're trying to do, and I get the feeling

257
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:05,280
that they'll be back in the news next week when they reach their 1.5 million.

258
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:11,200
But it's surely the aspiration of anybody in our community is to run hardware that can

259
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:13,360
run purely free software.

260
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:18,560
And you have to start at the very lowest level and that is the processor, the CPU.

261
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:21,080
And that is what RISC-V is all about.

262
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:22,080
Absolutely.

263
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:27,120
And so these are purpose-built application customizable CPUs and that's what Linux is

264
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,120
too.

265
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:32,020
Linux can be purpose-built customized for a singular application to really optimize

266
00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:33,020
that workload.

267
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:36,520
And that's why Linux and Android have been massively successful in the last few years.

268
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:41,080
And so now we have a RISC-V processor built around that same principle.

269
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:46,040
In fact, the company promotes this as optimized for Linux.

270
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:52,240
Welcome to 2017 everybody, where a CPU manufacturer is advertising to other hardware manufacturers

271
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:55,760
that they build a CPU optimized to run Linux.

272
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:58,960
Yeah, this is the start of the dream as far as I'm concerned.

273
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:02,000
Whether that dream is going to pan out or not, I really don't know.

274
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:06,040
But it's something that you don't see that much chatter about.

275
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:10,720
And people seem to be pinning their hopes on x86 and ARM at its early days.

276
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:14,960
It's very early days for RISC-V, but we need things like this to happen.

277
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:21,760
We need to have 64-bit quad-core and potentially octa-core plus, and we need to see the performance

278
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:24,980
increase and we need to see development in this area.

279
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:30,680
Because as far as I'm concerned, this is the only hope for a totally free software stack

280
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:31,680
when it comes to hardware.

281
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,840
Yeah, and the performance seems to be there.

282
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:37,640
Being able to tailor it for specific applications is a huge benefit.

283
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:43,240
And it's unburdened with all the legacy stuff that x86 has, so also I am very optimistic

284
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:44,240
about it.

285
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:45,240
So you guys should check it out.

286
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:51,660
Psi 5, and we'll have the links in the show notes, linuxactionnews.com slash 22.

287
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:54,160
Go give it a read, because it looks like they're working on something pretty cool.

288
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:58,120
And I would bet you that down the road, future boxes that you have in your house could have

289
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:04,560
a CPU very much like this inside them.

290
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:11,240
LAS.ting.com, you go there, you get $25 off a device or $25 in service credit.

291
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:15,840
I would check their BYOD page, because they have a CDMA and a GSM network, so you probably

292
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:17,320
have a device you can bring.

293
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:21,280
But this is what's great about Ting, it's pay for what you use mobile.

294
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:24,960
Your minutes, your messages, and your megabytes, you add them all up, whatever you use, that's

295
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:25,960
what you pay for.

296
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:26,960
Oh, you spent the whole month on Wi-Fi?

297
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:28,840
Then you're not paying for data.

298
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:29,840
Use Telegram or WhatsApp?

299
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:31,760
Then you don't pay for text messages.

300
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:32,760
It's great.

301
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:33,760
LAS.ting.com.

302
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:36,000
In fact, check out their blog.

303
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,480
Do me a favor, go to LAS.ting.com, then go to their blog, because they're doing giveaways

304
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:40,480
constantly.

305
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:44,120
I think just recently they have like a two gigabyte data giveaway, so check that out

306
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:45,240
on their blog.

307
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:48,440
It's mobile that really makes sense, with no contracts, no early termination fees, a

308
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:51,440
great dashboard, and radically different customer service.

309
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:52,440
They're owned by two cows.

310
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:55,180
If you're familiar with two cows, then you know what I'm talking about.

311
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:56,700
It's truly mobile that's different.

312
00:16:56,700 --> 00:17:05,880
That's how the whole industry would do it today if they were forced to restart, LAS.ting.com.

313
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:11,160
Let's talk about the poster child for FOSS in government, and that is Munich.

314
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:14,660
It's been a story that's rumbled on for about 10 years, I think.

315
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:21,960
They're moving over to an Ubuntu-based distribution, and moving the applications over first.

316
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:26,920
When the government changed and they were thinking about rolling back, well, it looks

317
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:29,320
like that has started.

318
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:34,400
It looks like they've started to move back to Exchange, so Colab is not going to be used

319
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:38,800
anymore, and so Mail and Calendaring is going back to evil MS.

320
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:42,680
Yeah, it actually stings because they're moving away from Colab to me.

321
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:46,800
Here's the direct quote, and it hurts because it's from a city council member.

322
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:49,840
It says, the city will use Microsoft Exchange.

323
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:56,980
You will be used for email, calendar, so Colab will not be used anymore.

324
00:17:56,980 --> 00:18:01,620
Hard and just cold like that, and out of all of it, for some reason, that's what upsets

325
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:06,300
me the most because I feel like they obviously botched the Linux desktop rollout.

326
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:10,560
They were trying to make an old version of Open Office that they had patched to work.

327
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:14,320
They were trying to make an old version of Linux that they had customized work for them

328
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:17,700
as some sort of desktop-specific distro.

329
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:19,480
They were doing everything wrong.

330
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:23,440
They were the case study in how not to switch to Linux, and in some way, that's actually

331
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:24,440
valuable for all of us.

332
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:27,880
We can look at Munich and say, okay, this is how you don't do it.

333
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:33,840
But the one area felt like they were doing things right was with collaboration software,

334
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:39,560
and specifically, using Colab, and to see them switch into Microsoft Exchange here,

335
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:42,440
it's a bigger deal than it seems on its face because it either means they're going all

336
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:46,340
in on hosting or they're going all in on active directory.

337
00:18:46,340 --> 00:18:49,640
Either way, fundamental shifts, and it's sort of disappointing to see it.

338
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:50,640
I admit.

339
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:51,640
Yeah.

340
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:55,480
The thing is that a lot of people in our community, or almost everyone, just thinks it's a universally

341
00:18:55,480 --> 00:19:01,300
bad thing that they would go back to Microsoft products, whereas to me, I try and be a bit

342
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:07,080
more pragmatic about it, and I would say that they have the responsibility to look at the

343
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:08,320
figures here.

344
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:15,160
Is it going to cost them less to pay for Microsoft than it would to go for some sort of open

345
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:19,880
source solution, and I would much prefer them to go open source, but if it's going to cost

346
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:24,480
them less ultimately, then I kind of feel like they have the responsibility to do that.

347
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:29,120
That said, if they'd done it properly in the first place and just paid Red Hat to come

348
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:34,120
in and give them proper support, then that would have probably worked out cheaper.

349
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:35,120
I don't know.

350
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:36,120
Who knows?

351
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:40,000
But trying to roll their own solution and no one knowing exactly what was going on,

352
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:45,760
and as you say, patching these ancient versions of Ubuntu and OpenOffice and stuff, that was

353
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:49,500
just never going to be the right solution.

354
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:57,400
Nothing to do with Microsoft opening up their German headquarters in Munich or anything.

355
00:19:57,400 --> 00:20:02,080
It's all a very disappointing story, but yeah, I think you've picked up on the silver lining

356
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:04,200
that, yeah, at least we can learn what not to do now.

357
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:05,640
That is really what to take away from it.

358
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:11,200
To me, it seems like the cost of retraining the users was an obstacle that they could

359
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:18,840
never completely get over, and then the requirement of time and development energy and cost to

360
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:24,900
keep their Linux distribution current, it appears that they essentially gave up on that

361
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:27,560
effort around 2013.

362
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:31,480
They just decided it was too much work to keep it up to date.

363
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:35,000
We're essentially writing our own operating system at this point, and then they tried

364
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:42,040
to ride that 2013 distro out as long as possible, and then it got to a point where people just

365
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:46,200
had to ask the question, well, look at Windows 10 and look at this bastardized Linux distribution

366
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:47,480
from 2013.

367
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:48,620
They're not competitive.

368
00:20:48,620 --> 00:20:49,940
We should just go this route.

369
00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:51,940
We avoid the retraining cost.

370
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:56,800
We're already switching to Microsoft Exchange, so it's just obvious to make this switch,

371
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:59,360
and the rest of it clicks into place.

372
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:04,120
I think in the ashes of this entire experiment, what we can hope is they remain on open standard

373
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:11,280
formats, like ODF, and they use systems that are available to the public even after commercial

374
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:12,540
agreements end.

375
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:14,040
That's the best we can hope for, I think.

376
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:19,800
Yeah, except that it'll be docx or whatever the new one is.

377
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:24,840
I can't see them sticking with the open standards, because unless they make the effort to make

378
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:30,400
sure that it saves in those formats by default, it's just not going to happen, and you can

379
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:34,600
see that being an easy thing to forget when you set up a machine.

380
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:37,560
It does feel like, though, that is the new battle, and if there's any advocates in there

381
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:41,440
for open standards and open formats, that is the button to start pushing.

382
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:44,540
Because otherwise, you're going to have companies like Oracle roll in and just say, stop using

383
00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:46,080
open source altogether.

384
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:50,840
Yeah, somehow I think you might be a bit riled up about this one, being that Oracle have

385
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:53,480
advised the White House not to use FOSS.

386
00:21:53,480 --> 00:22:00,760
Yeah, this is after the US Digital Service, USDSK, and 18F had asked for comments from

387
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:05,540
the private sector on how to modernize the federal government's security infrastructure,

388
00:22:05,540 --> 00:22:13,480
and lots of companies have submitted recommendations, including Adobe and Microsoft and just about

389
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:17,520
every other company you could think of, and all of them are pretty standard.

390
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:22,400
In fact, I have to really give some serious credit to Microsoft for writing one of the

391
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:25,680
most concise and one of the most open.

392
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:32,400
They just posted it as a gist instead of like a PDF, and it didn't really push any Microsoft

393
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:34,440
goals.

394
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:40,900
In contrast, Google had a very Google-centric proposal, which literally suggested the entire

395
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:45,440
federal government should switch over to cloud computing and just trust Google for everything.

396
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:48,000
Yeah, funny that, yeah.

397
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:53,200
So Oracle though, Oracle really stepped on it, because Oracle is offended.

398
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:58,160
Oracle is offended by the federal government's use of open source and the false narratives

399
00:22:58,160 --> 00:23:00,560
that they have landed on.

400
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:02,500
In fact, they say just that.

401
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:05,760
This is a direct quote from Oracle's submission, false narrative.

402
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:09,320
The government should attempt to emulate fast-paced innovation of Silicon Valley.

403
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:13,400
Silicon Valley is comprised of IT vendors, most of which fail.

404
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:17,840
The USG is not a technology vendor, nor is it a startup.

405
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:22,560
Under no circumstances should the USG attempt to become a technology vendor.

406
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:30,640
And as you can imagine, that eventually de-escalates into don't use open source, don't use open

407
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:33,200
standards, don't use open data.

408
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:34,360
All of these things are bad.

409
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:39,280
In fact, Oracle even attempts to make the case and attempts to argue that open source

410
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:45,860
is seeing a decline in the private sector, and then goes to blame the Equifax breach

411
00:23:45,860 --> 00:23:50,920
on Apache, and uses that as an example of why the federal government shouldn't use open

412
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:51,920
source software.

413
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:56,440
Yeah, that is just absolutely outrageous that they would do that, because that was unpatched

414
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:57,440
open source software.

415
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,360
So that's got nothing to do with the fact that it was open source.

416
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:04,480
But to be fair to them, they do kind of pepper it with a few facts.

417
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:08,440
And I think that that first one about Silicon Valley being comprised of IT vendors, most

418
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:11,120
of which fail, is actually true, isn't it?

419
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:13,400
Yeah, it does resonate a bit true, you're right.

420
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:17,680
But they kind of pepper it with a few facts, and then just the rest of it is just nonsense,

421
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:19,920
just designed to...

422
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:21,360
It's kind of FUD, really, isn't it?

423
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:22,360
It's classic FUD.

424
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:23,360
It is.

425
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:27,400
In fact, it says that if the government were to mandate open source technology preferences,

426
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:32,600
it would be a significant de-incentive to conducting business with the USG.

427
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:36,400
Oracle is trying to tell them that if they mandate open source, businesses that want

428
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:38,920
to make money won't work with them.

429
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:39,920
What?

430
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:41,880
Maybe they should tell that to Red Hat.

431
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:42,880
Yeah, exactly.

432
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:43,880
Yeah, it seems better.

433
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:45,320
It just doesn't make any sense.

434
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:50,800
I mean, okay, there are some legacy companies, like Oracle, who won't be interested, but

435
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:51,960
that's their problem.

436
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:55,160
A lot of this, Joe, to me comes across as bitterness.

437
00:24:55,160 --> 00:25:00,940
Oracle was involved with the rollout of healthcare.gov, and the failure of healthcare.gov was pinned

438
00:25:00,940 --> 00:25:04,400
predominantly on Oracle software.

439
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:11,540
And the things that sprung out from that failure, like the USG and 18F, are sort of thorns in

440
00:25:11,540 --> 00:25:15,840
Oracle's side, because they've involved bringing in a lot of Silicon Valley people that have

441
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:20,080
new modern ideas about the way to do business, and Oracle doesn't like that very much.

442
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:22,920
Well, they're very much old world, aren't they?

443
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:27,240
It's not a surprise that they're not interested in these new ways of doing things, because

444
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:31,680
they just have this old-fashioned view that things should be proprietary and locked down,

445
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:36,720
and these huge contracts and huge bloated bits of software that they have complete control

446
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:39,800
over, and all the standards are theirs.

447
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:45,100
So it's no wonder that these new agile Silicon Valley types come in and want to use as much

448
00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:49,600
open source as possible, because let's face it, from a business point of view, it makes

449
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:52,400
a lot of sense to use open source.

450
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:57,120
For example, crypto, there's so much great open source crypto, why on earth would you

451
00:25:57,120 --> 00:26:00,960
write your own, paying engineers to write and maintain your own, when you can just use

452
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,180
open source?

453
00:26:02,180 --> 00:26:07,440
You can just pull in all these open source libraries that make writing of your own software

454
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:08,440
way cheaper.

455
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:11,040
Yeah, absolutely true.

456
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:16,440
Oracle kind of feels like a dying breed here, of an older technology, Silicon Valley era,

457
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:19,840
when things were just different.

458
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:23,700
Software was delivered differently, software was created differently, the investment into

459
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:28,160
create that software was completely different, and now a transition is taking place, and

460
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:31,280
the federal government finds themselves sort of in the middle of this transition.

461
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:37,440
What you really need, Joe, is a way to give the power to the people, like a good Bitcoin

462
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:38,920
fork can do.

463
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:42,480
Oh man, yet another.

464
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:46,360
Yet another Bitcoin gold this time.

465
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:49,360
I don't know how seriously to take this one.

466
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:54,720
I think it's worth discussing in a kind of broader sense of, this is the second one,

467
00:26:54,720 --> 00:27:00,720
and there's another one pending in November, and you've just ended up with more and more

468
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:07,120
forks of Bitcoin, and these hard forks that mean that you can use your old Bitcoin however

469
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:08,880
many Bitcoin you had before.

470
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:16,720
You've now got instantly that many Bitcoin gold or Bitcoin cash, but it just seems to

471
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:23,340
me that the more forks we have here, the more legitimacy the original has in a weird way,

472
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:29,720
because you've got all this fragmentation happening with the rest of it, but then the

473
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:35,320
old-fashioned original Bitcoin just keeps chugging along and going, well, whatever guys,

474
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:38,240
they're worth a bunch.

475
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:42,160
You know, I look at this and I think maybe what we're seeing is a shift, actually.

476
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:43,520
Nothing really new, but a shift.

477
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:50,180
So when years ago, when Bitcoin was the hot topic, just proper Bitcoin, you had Litecoin

478
00:27:50,180 --> 00:27:56,920
and Dogecoin and a lot of other coins, and now what we seem to be having is forks of

479
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:58,040
Bitcoin.

480
00:27:58,040 --> 00:28:01,920
So it's sort of the same thing, a bunch of competing cryptocurrencies, but now we're

481
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:04,520
all just forking Bitcoin instead.

482
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:08,640
And I'm kind of getting sick and tired of it and I'm finding it hard to track.

483
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:13,240
However, that said, Bitcoin gold has one thing about it that I like.

484
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:15,140
It's a memory-hard algorithm.

485
00:28:15,140 --> 00:28:23,240
It's more like Ethereum or Litecoin in that it can be actually computed by average everyday

486
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:24,400
GPUs.

487
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:28,240
And the best part about Bitcoin for me was when I was all in on mining.

488
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:31,600
I had Linux rigs up the wazoo mining coins.

489
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:34,920
I was heating my studio using machines.

490
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:38,400
It was the most fun I had with Bitcoin was when I could actually mine.

491
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:44,040
Plus, then you feel like you're participating in the swarm by authorizing and confirming

492
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:45,320
transactions.

493
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:47,340
You feel like you're actually participating.

494
00:28:47,340 --> 00:28:49,000
And that's what Bitcoin gold is going for.

495
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,560
That's what Litecoin is going for.

496
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:54,280
They're using these algorithms or they're using these math problems that are memory

497
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:58,840
hard that work better for hardware that the average folk have, and it's going to be fun.

498
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:04,360
Now I kind of see this shaking out, though, in a way where you can use all these Bitcoin

499
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:09,800
derivatives to generate some revenue, but really the money is going to be made in selling

500
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:11,600
them to buy actual Bitcoin proper.

501
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:17,520
Well, yeah, when I got into mining for a brief period, when I had a reasonable AMD card,

502
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:18,520
that's what everyone was doing.

503
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:24,720
They would mine Doge or they'd mine Litecoin specifically to then trade that for Bitcoin.

504
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:27,120
And so Bitcoin is the original.

505
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:29,520
It's the Coke or the Pepsi or whatever.

506
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:32,980
It is the original, the name you know.

507
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:38,740
So all these other ones, maybe they have hopes of becoming more valuable, but if they do,

508
00:29:38,740 --> 00:29:44,240
it's just dreaming because Bitcoin is just going to be the one that makes the money.

509
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:48,360
And I just don't see the point of forking it to make it easier to mine because why not

510
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:51,560
just mine Litecoin in that case?

511
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:56,800
If you want something that's script-based and therefore can be mined on a GPU still

512
00:29:56,800 --> 00:30:01,640
rather than read these ridiculous expensive ASICs, then just mine them.

513
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:08,240
And the thing is that one of the key people behind Bitcoin Gold is the CEO of Lightning

514
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:13,080
ASIC, who is a company that just, oh, they just happened to sell the ASIC that is perfect

515
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:14,320
for this.

516
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:19,120
So it just feels like a cash grab and just more of this Ponzi scheme style to me.

517
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:20,120
Right.

518
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:21,120
It's a little concerning.

519
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:24,840
Each time they launch a new fork, it just feels like another way to earn a quick buck

520
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:28,840
and then sell it and actually buy a real Bitcoin or trade it for something else.

521
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:36,040
And it's this perfect, every time one ride ends, be it Litecoin or whatever Bitcoin fork,

522
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:37,240
you just launch another one.

523
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:40,580
And as long as you have a good justification and there's a new fancy shining technology

524
00:30:40,580 --> 00:30:43,820
to try out, you get enough suckers on board.

525
00:30:43,820 --> 00:30:47,940
It spikes, you make a bunch of money, you sell, and then you just do the next thing.

526
00:30:47,940 --> 00:30:51,200
And it is starting to feel a bit of like a scam over and over and over again.

527
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:52,640
Yeah, it is.

528
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:57,000
The one thing I will say about Bitcoin Gold that seems a little strange, and I can see

529
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:02,140
the both the positives and the negatives, but it is going to absolutely be confusing,

530
00:31:02,140 --> 00:31:08,180
is they're using the same address for Bitcoin and for Bitcoin Gold.

531
00:31:08,180 --> 00:31:12,320
And you already have some reports when this has happened with other forks where people

532
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:17,060
accidentally send Bitcoin to a Bitcoin derivative and they just lose it forever.

533
00:31:17,060 --> 00:31:20,800
It's just gone or vice versa, because the address spaces are exactly the same.

534
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:22,720
They look like the same scheme.

535
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:26,840
Yeah, but they are planning to sort that out, but not for launch, which doesn't make any

536
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:27,840
sense.

537
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:28,840
I know.

538
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:29,840
That's a kind of a red flag as well.

539
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:30,840
I agree.

540
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:31,840
That does seem like a red flag.

541
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:32,840
So the whole thing is very strange.

542
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:37,760
And yet it is the cross that we must bear, Joe, hashtag first world problems.

543
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:38,760
Very much so.

544
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:39,760
Yes.

545
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:44,220
