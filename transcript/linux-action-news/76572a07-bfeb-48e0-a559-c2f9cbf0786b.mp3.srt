00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,520
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, our weekly take on Linux and the open source world.

2
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:19,980
This is episode three, recorded on May 28, 2017.

3
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:20,980
I'm Chris.

4
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:21,980
And I'm Joe.

5
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:22,980
Hello, Joe.

6
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:23,980
Good to be with you again.

7
00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:29,240
And we have good news for XFCE users coming up later on in the show, but we should probably

8
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:33,440
start with the worldwide global news from Nextcloud.

9
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:36,880
Yeah, big news from Nextcloud this week.

10
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:45,560
Global scale, which is their way of scaling Nextcloud instances up to 300 million users

11
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:47,740
was the quoted number.

12
00:00:47,740 --> 00:00:52,720
That's their kind of goal for this, which is a lofty ambition, to say the least.

13
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:58,840
Yeah, it's obvious that Nextcloud is going head-forth, not only into enterprise, but

14
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:02,960
at these numbers also, I would imagine, state installations.

15
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:06,440
Now they're doing this through a series of different technologies, basically things to

16
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:12,000
break out different jobs and make Nextcloud responsive across a network of systems.

17
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,000
So using proxies and central database servers that are aware of which users are logged into

18
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,320
which Nextcloud servers and all kinds of things that increase scalability.

19
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:26,300
And the interesting thing, Joe, is that while for you and I, this seems like a good thing

20
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:30,440
for Nextcloud to do, it probably doesn't really matter to most of us that are just running

21
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:36,700
Nextcloud, say, on a VPS or on our local network, but there is actually kind of a cool angle.

22
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:43,440
This technology would also enable portability in like a Nextcloud ecosystem, and what I

23
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:47,360
mean by that is you could have a series of service providers that are already starting

24
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:51,560
to crop up that could be at the ISP level or could be just something that you subscribe

25
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:52,560
to online.

26
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,280
It's like hosted Nextcloud.

27
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:58,780
It does all of the things that Nextcloud do, but they manage the Nextcloud instance.

28
00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:04,840
But say you get annoyed with that provider, it could be possible to move your account

29
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:07,660
and your data to a different Nextcloud instance.

30
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:12,700
So Nextcloud becomes sort of a neutral platform that different service providers spin up,

31
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:16,400
and then you can move around as a consumer using some of these same technologies they're

32
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:19,320
building to make Nextcloud also massively scalable.

33
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:24,320
Yeah, what they're trying to do is leverage themselves into a position of being the standard

34
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:28,640
or at least a standard, which you can then move around, and it doesn't really matter

35
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:31,920
where you're using it because it is just the standard way to do it.

36
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:35,920
I was having a good chat with Yoss on episode 198 of Linux Unplugged.

37
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:40,540
He works over at Nextcloud, and you start to realize after talking with him pretty quickly

38
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:48,640
that they're a non-trivial amount of work away from creating a Slack and Mastodon killer.

39
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:53,640
And I don't toss that around lightly, but if you look at their federated technology

40
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:58,100
and you extrapolate from there and you make it possible to tag users across federated

41
00:02:58,100 --> 00:03:03,080
servers and you add global directory servers that are aware of what servers are online

42
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:07,120
and which users are logged into which of those, and you start giving people addressable addresses

43
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:13,140
like at Chris LAS across this federated server infrastructure, then you combine in their

44
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:15,560
online collaborative editing.

45
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:20,120
Their already built in existing file syncing and sharing services, their calendar and collaborative

46
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:26,200
work, their note system and the apps that you can install, and the user data portability,

47
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:33,600
what you got yourself here is a potential Mastodon Slack hybrid that is open source

48
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:34,600
and user portable.

49
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:35,960
It sounds amazing, doesn't it?

50
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:41,960
It sounds like it could be a killer of Mastodon, as you say, and Slack, but can I pour a bit

51
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:45,360
of cold water on this as usual?

52
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:52,040
Should they not be thinking more about improving the core functionality first before they roll

53
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:59,800
out all of these crazy new global scale federated systems?

54
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:01,900
Do you know what I mean by that?

55
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:07,280
Take for example, when you send me the audio for this to do the edit of the show, you're

56
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:10,600
going to send me it using Dropbox.

57
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:13,040
And the question I have for you is why?

58
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,200
Why not Nextcloud?

59
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,840
So I think I would argue a bit with the premise.

60
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:18,760
I think they are improving the core with each release.

61
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:22,840
They're definitely making solid security improvements and the upgrades seem to be getting better

62
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:24,200
and better between releases.

63
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:29,720
I would also, I would bet you that some of this is about replacing core infrastructure

64
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:31,680
that needed to be reworked anyways.

65
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:37,500
And so since they have to replace it, why not make it scale to infinity and beyond?

66
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:44,600
And I think the reason why I don't use, say, their sync solution over Dropbox is twofold.

67
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:48,840
Number one, I think the Dropbox CDNs are faster than anything I can implement, so you can

68
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:52,440
pull it down and the other hosts I work with can pull down the files that I post up there

69
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:56,160
super fast, basically can saturate your connection wherever you're at in the world.

70
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:59,100
And that's particularly nice for the type of workload that I'm doing.

71
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:03,680
The second thing is that I really have no interest in managing an instance at this point

72
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:06,640
because I just want to share files that end up public anyways.

73
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:10,960
I just want something that's exceedingly good at just moving those files.

74
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:15,360
And the, I guess I said there was two things, but there's really three things.

75
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:20,480
The software I use to record some of these shows natively integrates with Dropbox using

76
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:23,040
their API and saves to Dropbox.

77
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:29,120
That's its only save destination, as a matter of fact, which is incredible and welcome to

78
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,120
do that.

79
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:31,120
Yeah, and welcome to do that.

80
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,120
I mean, I would bail, right?

81
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:34,760
It's not an irreplaceable piece of software, so that's why I use it.

82
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:38,680
If it was something that was fundamentally irreplaceable, I would not use that.

83
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:43,200
But because I'm going to publish it to you via Dropbox anyways for now, it works.

84
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:47,640
If that were to go away and I were to re-engineer a solution, Nextcloud would be a serious consideration

85
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:48,640
for me.

86
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:52,320
I might also look at other things that are just pure file syncing like C file.

87
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:54,000
So it just kind of depends on the job.

88
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Yeah.

89
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Yeah.

90
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:02,640
And for me, what they need to improve massively is the document editing, the collaborative

91
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:10,040
editing because Google have just got that down so perfectly, as far as I can see.

92
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:12,960
We're using it right now for the notes for the show.

93
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:17,960
Google Docs in Drive is so, well, just perfect.

94
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:18,960
It just works.

95
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:22,400
It does everything I ever need it to do, autosaves all the rest of it.

96
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:27,160
Whereas with Nextcloud, okay, it's getting there, but it's not quite there yet, is it?

97
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:30,560
I think I still prefer Google Docs myself for doing show notes there, especially when

98
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,120
you're live and you're on air.

99
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:37,360
But I don't know, for an office where you have not exactly real-time collaboration but

100
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:42,920
you have Joe looks at it for 15 minutes and then Chris looks at it for another 15 minutes,

101
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:48,480
a half hour later, and then we publish it on the intranet, for that kind of collaborative

102
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:53,920
editing or even like we're all at a meeting, say Joe, Chris, and the beard are all sitting

103
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:58,760
around the Jupyter Broadcasting meeting table and we're all taking notes, I think it's fine

104
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:01,480
for that kind of collaboration.

105
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:04,940
We need to message, we need to be able to make corrections in real time while we're

106
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:05,940
speaking on air.

107
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:08,200
I think Google Docs has a leg up there.

108
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:12,840
And the other place where Google Docs has a huge leg up is with Google Apps package

109
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:16,500
that they're so successfully selling to businesses, at least here in the States, and particularly

110
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:20,260
to schools, because you buy that one package and in case of the schools, you can even get

111
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:22,000
in there for free.

112
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,800
And you don't have to worry about hosting, you don't have to worry about infrastructure.

113
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:30,900
You just get part of the Google Apps as part of your subscription.

114
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:34,920
And that's why Nextcloud has to work more and more on their scaling and on being available

115
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:39,180
to service providers, so service providers can go into things like businesses and schools

116
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:41,280
and sell a Nextcloud solution.

117
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:45,240
Because otherwise, the businesses are going to opt for the more sustainable, quote-unquote

118
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:49,800
cheaper investment, which is right now, Google Docs or Google Apps.

119
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,600
That's really their competition, I feel like.

120
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:57,400
Yeah, well, let's hope they can create this standard and we'll get these hosted solutions

121
00:07:57,400 --> 00:08:01,280
and it'll be really easy for people to use and then they'll be using open source rather

122
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:03,980
than evil Google.

123
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:11,920
So from the future of file syncing to the past of init systems, Dev1 has finally reached

124
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:12,920
1.0.0.

125
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:14,080
Right.

126
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:18,960
And it's worth noting this is their LTS release based on Jessie, which is a bit ironic, but

127
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:20,400
we'll get to that.

128
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:24,580
This was something we talked about with RC2, just announced only three weeks ago.

129
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:28,960
But they feel like there was no critical bugs that came up and so for init freedom lovers

130
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:31,000
out there, it's ready for a 1.0.

131
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,560
What do you think, Joe?

132
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:38,080
Well, I installed it and I also installed Debbie and Jessie and both of them had XFCE

133
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:41,280
on them and I got them to be very, very similar.

134
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:46,340
And so from a user's point of view, once you've got it installed, it's essentially the same

135
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:47,340
operating system.

136
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:49,020
Yeah, I did the same thing.

137
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:50,020
It's just funny.

138
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:51,020
I decided to do the same thing.

139
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:54,800
But there is one major difference and that's why I said there's good news for XFCE users,

140
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:58,400
because Dev1 doesn't give you the option to install GNOME 3.

141
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:00,240
Let's just put it that way.

142
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:04,840
So you get XFCE, you get LXDE and you get Mate.

143
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:08,320
Well, I did it from the live CD, which was XFCE.

144
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:12,000
So that was when I heard that the live CD was XFCE, I thought, great, well, because

145
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
that's what I use.

146
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

147
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,280
And it does kind of seem like a good desktop.

148
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:20,640
I was chewing this over, though, and you know where I would totally use Dev1?

149
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:26,640
Not even as like a statement on system D. But if I just had a production system in place,

150
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:30,960
a server that I had reason to believe would have issues if it was upgraded to system D

151
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:38,540
and I needed a direction to go, if I could overlay the Dev1 packages or if I could upgrade

152
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:44,160
an existing Debian release to the Dev1 Jesse 1.0 LTS, if I could do some sort of cross

153
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:48,920
upgrade like that, so I don't break my system and I can keep my existing installation patched,

154
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:53,700
I could definitely, definitely see a use for this, sort of like in the past, I used to

155
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:57,880
convert Red Hat Enterprise servers to CentOS systems.

156
00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:01,280
And you would be, you know, you got it down, eventually, you just could replace the right

157
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:04,880
packages and then all of a sudden, you could upgrade to the next CentOS release from the

158
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:06,900
previous Red Hat Enterprise release.

159
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:08,280
Don't ever do what Chris does.

160
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:12,540
If you could do something similar with Dev1 and Debian, that might be nice for those that

161
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:15,560
are actually worried about real world breakage.

162
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:20,520
My personal opinion though is, it's much more likely that there are way more Gnome 3 users

163
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:23,840
out there that if they tried to upgrade to this, would break their Gnome 3 desktops.

164
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:28,880
Yeah, because Gnome's got a lot of dependencies on system D, hasn't it, so that's why, presumably,

165
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:29,880
it's not in Dev1.

166
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:34,160
At login D, specifically, yeah, exactly.

167
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:40,360
The irony in all of this is though, as they hit Jesse 1.0, we get an actual release date

168
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:41,640
for Debian Stretch.

169
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:44,140
Yeah, which is going to be a few weeks' time.

170
00:10:44,140 --> 00:10:47,760
So they are almost a whole release behind now.

171
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:50,780
I mean, you know, like, does that matter?

172
00:10:50,780 --> 00:10:55,320
Probably for the kind of person who is going to use Dev1, probably not, but if you want

173
00:10:55,320 --> 00:11:02,040
to be stuck on an old three point something kernel and stuff, don't know really.

174
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:07,160
So Dev1 is an interesting project that I feel like is under a particularly higher amount

175
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:10,560
of scrutiny than other recent distros that have come up.

176
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:13,600
And one of the things that did jump out at me, and I can't tell if this is just me being

177
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:18,600
critical, or if this is experience speaking, but in there, they talk about the reason it's

178
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:24,360
good to release is because no critical bugs have been reported since the RC, three weeks

179
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:25,920
ago.

180
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:28,440
But if you have a tiny user base...

181
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:31,500
Yeah, that's not good, potentially, is it?

182
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:36,480
But you know what's funny about having Debian Jesse and Dev1 Jesse on the same system?

183
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,160
Which one do you think boots faster?

184
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:41,240
I guess I would have assumed the system D1, but I don't know.

185
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:49,920
Yeah, but no, Dev1 booted much more quickly because I think it was struggling to read

186
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:53,840
one of my other partitions or something during boot.

187
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:56,080
And so it just sort of froze a little bit.

188
00:11:56,080 --> 00:12:00,080
I'm supposed to do something automatically with this, but I can't figure out what.

189
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:01,080
Yeah.

190
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:05,860
And I hadn't done any FSTab stuff or anything like that, it was just all automatic.

191
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:13,460
So it's supposedly system D boots more quickly, but not in this case on my test machine.

192
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:14,460
So there you go.

193
00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:21,080
Well, Joe's porn stash aside, I have reasonably system D systems are supposed to boot faster.

194
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:24,520
Well, maybe.

195
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:29,440
So let's talk about good news for Wimpy's favorite subject, VR.

196
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:30,440
Yes.

197
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:34,420
Steam VR is now supposedly working under Linux.

198
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:38,400
And now this is an update that was pushed out to Steam and it's experimental at this

199
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:42,480
point and it also includes an update to Steam OS, more details in a second.

200
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:45,280
And this is called Steam VR Home Support.

201
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:49,200
It's a beta feature from Valve, which makes like some of the social stuff and the interactive

202
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,720
launcher work.

203
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:55,680
And if you combine it with the right base distribution, and I'll get to that more in

204
00:12:55,680 --> 00:13:03,200
a moment, you can actually get full Valve VR features under Steam OS or Linux.

205
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:07,280
And boy, is my body ready for this Joe, because I preemptively bought the Vive hardware the

206
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:12,840
moment they announced that they would be doing this, which is Vive is who Valve works with.

207
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:17,780
And I got it all pretty much ready to go, tried to set it up under multiple different

208
00:13:17,780 --> 00:13:21,820
distributions and hit different roadblocks depending on the distribution I tried.

209
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:26,560
So having this get this part down the road means that the setup experience should be

210
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:30,160
a lot smoother, especially if you use the new Steam OS update.

211
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:31,720
But hang on, how's that going to work in the RV?

212
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:35,840
You're going to be running into things left, right, and center trying to do VR.

213
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:37,720
Boom, pop, boom.

214
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:38,720
It's worth it, Joe.

215
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:41,060
No, I have it set up here in the studio living room.

216
00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:42,060
It's for the studio.

217
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:43,060
It's not for me.

218
00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:47,600
It'll be like set up here for people to play around with when they visit JB1.

219
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:50,760
And so this is like, you know, this is like going to be like a big thing.

220
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:52,320
I was going to get wimpy.

221
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:56,680
I was going to get wimpy in the VR headset here at the JB1 studio while he was out here

222
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:58,480
for Linux Fest Northwest.

223
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:02,440
And three different people took three different cracks at getting it working under Linux with

224
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:04,380
very minimal results.

225
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:06,000
And we were not satisfied with what we got.

226
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,820
So we didn't bother because we thought if we gave wimpy a bad showing, it would be worse

227
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:11,100
than nothing at all.

228
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:16,480
So we just put it back in the box and didn't bring it up.

229
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:22,000
This isn't particularly exciting news right now because it doesn't work that well.

230
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,120
It sounds like it's very experimental.

231
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:25,800
It's all kind of beta.

232
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:31,120
But for me, why this is very important is it shows that Valve has not abandoned Steam

233
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,280
OS.

234
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:38,600
And again, you mentioned this update to the beta, Brewmaster beta.

235
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:44,400
It's had a huge update to the latest version of Debbie and Jesse and new kernel and all

236
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:46,320
that kind of stuff.

237
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:50,200
And it shows that Valve have not forgotten about Steam OS.

238
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:51,720
And I wonder why that is.

239
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:58,280
Is it because of Windows 10 S maybe, because that was the possibility that they created

240
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:01,120
Steam OS as a hedge against, wasn't it?

241
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:06,440
Because of the fact that if you get a Windows version that you can only install stuff from

242
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:12,800
the store, then Valve loses their control with Steam to deliver the software to you.

243
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:16,080
When I heard that Windows S story and the fact that Windows S would be limited to a

244
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:19,880
certain subset of apps from the Windows Store, in fact, now we've learned it's even more

245
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:23,840
limited than we initially thought, like the Windows Linux subsystem stuff will not be

246
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:28,000
available from the App Store, even though it's in the Windows Store.

247
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,600
When I first heard that story, my first thought was, this is exactly what Valve was worried

248
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:32,600
about.

249
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:34,600
And so I would say you're totally wrong.

250
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:41,680
Having spoken with the gentleman at Dell who is responsible for Dell's Alienware Steam

251
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:46,680
machine, which I think is officially the most successful Steam machine, if not unofficially

252
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:48,840
the most successful Steam machine.

253
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:52,880
And we asked them specifically, well, when are you guys going to update this thing again?

254
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:55,240
Because it's been a couple of years.

255
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:57,120
And Dell said, well, we're waiting for VR.

256
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:04,000
We feel like when Valve nails VR in Steam OS, we're going to rev the hardware.

257
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,620
And I bet you Dell's not the only hardware manufacturer thinking that.

258
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:12,280
And so Valve does have a couple of hardware partners that are sufficiently happy with

259
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:14,980
the sales to produce another unit.

260
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:18,560
But they need a reason to put a GTX 1080 in there or something like that.

261
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:24,520
My conversation with the guys at Dell were like, yeah, we put a GTX 1080 in this thing.

262
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:29,160
But to tell you the truth, the majority of our customers are playing at 1080p.

263
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:35,160
And a 960, an NVIDIA 960 does just fine when you're pushing 1080p.

264
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:38,640
And then for our customers that are going to 4K, most of them know how to open up this

265
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:40,440
machine and put a different video card in too.

266
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:42,120
Like it's just not huge yet.

267
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:47,520
But if we could get 4K and Steam VR and all these different requirements, we'd be happy

268
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:49,240
to rev another piece of hardware.

269
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:52,920
So Valve might be readying the groundwork with these Steam OS updates, their quote unquote

270
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:56,200
biggest update ever for a new generation of Steam machines.

271
00:16:56,200 --> 00:17:01,220
Well, let's hope so, because I would really like to see Steam OS do well and be a serious

272
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:07,400
competitor to Windows, or at least maybe the Xbox and the PlayStation.

273
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:13,160
It seems a bit ambitious, but I'd like to see Linux out there doing well in gaming and

274
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:14,160
being taken seriously.

275
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:16,960
And you know, Joe, I actually had a conversation with a couple of different people who are

276
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:18,440
like, I love PC games.

277
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:22,580
If I could play it easier in my living room, I would totally do it.

278
00:17:22,580 --> 00:17:25,400
So maybe that's what they're going to offer.

279
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:29,800
So it's good to see the Steam OS update because it also includes some of the Vulkan drivers

280
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:34,780
needed to make VR work, which is actually the trickiest part of getting VR to work under

281
00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:40,480
Linux right now, is you have to get a particular version of the NVIDIA driver that has a particular

282
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:42,600
build of Vulkan.

283
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:46,920
It's the same version that a lot of distributions ship by default, but it's a different branch

284
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:48,100
of the driver.

285
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:50,320
And so it causes a lot of package conflicts.

286
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:52,860
And so Steam OS is smoothing that out.

287
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:56,960
And this is an example where Steam OS allows Valve to sort of iron out some of those little

288
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:57,960
bumps.

289
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:01,160
Yeah, and if they get it to the point where it is just an appliance that you can plug

290
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:08,920
in and start using, because it's based on Linux, we're all going to benefit from that.

291
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:12,360
This episode of Linux Action News is brought to you by DigitalOcean.

292
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:17,240
Go to DigitalOcean.com, create an account, and use our promo code, here's the thing,

293
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:18,840
and you'll get a $10 credit.

294
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:22,800
You apply that to your account, create the $5 rig, run it two months for free, or run

295
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:24,480
one of their hourly systems.

296
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:27,880
When I was trying out that new Nextcloud release, I spun it up on a DigitalOcean droplet, ran

297
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:29,640
it for a little while, kicked the tires.

298
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:30,920
I really enjoyed it.

299
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:33,320
Joe of Memory serves, you got a couple of droplets yourself.

300
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:37,440
Yeah, I've been using DigitalOcean for quite a while now, and it's brilliant.

301
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:38,440
Maniac.

302
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:45,120
The only thing I used it for was when I needed to get late night Linux onto Google Play podcasts.

303
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:46,680
You can only do that from the states.

304
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:51,480
I thought, well, I could fire up a VPN, or I could do something a bit more interesting.

305
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:59,200
I fired up a droplet in New York, just the $5 one, installed X2Go, logged into it from

306
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:05,360
my laptop, installed LXDE, browsed to the website, set everything up, and then destroyed

307
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:08,640
the droplet, and guess how much it cost me?

308
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:09,640
Hmm.

309
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:11,320
Six cents, seven cents, eight cents?

310
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:12,320
What?

311
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:13,320
One cent.

312
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:16,080
You were quick, too, then.

313
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:17,080
That's nice.

314
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:18,400
Yeah, the hourly pricing is killer for that.

315
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:21,040
I love it for trying out different open source projects.

316
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:25,160
We have, right now, Joe and I are chatting over Mumble, and we have a Jupyter Broadcasting

317
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:29,400
Mumble server that we use on Linux Unplugged, and we run that on a DigitalOcean droplet.

318
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:34,840
One of the things I love about it is the performance is extremely respectable for wherever you're

319
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,840
connecting in the world.

320
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:40,360
But if you know where your users are going to be at, you can position using one of their

321
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:41,680
worldwide data centers.

322
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:46,440
They have them all over the world in New York, San Francisco, Singapore, Amsterdam, London,

323
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:48,320
Toronto, Germany, India.

324
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:49,880
They have them spinning up all the time.

325
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:52,160
You might just want to go create a droplet next to Alan June.

326
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:53,160
I know I do.

327
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:56,140
DigitalOcean.com, go over there, create an account.

328
00:19:56,140 --> 00:19:57,560
Also play around with their block storage.

329
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:58,560
It's just super sweet.

330
00:19:58,560 --> 00:19:59,560
You can go up to 16 terabytes.

331
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:03,880
You can attach it to your device as block storage, mess around with whatever file system

332
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:09,280
you want or crazy LVM setup, DigitalOcean.com is a great place to learn and put things into

333
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:11,200
production and experiment.

334
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:12,200
Just use our promo code.

335
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:16,160
Here's the thing at DigitalOcean.com and a big thank you to DigitalOcean for sponsoring

336
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:17,400
Linux Action News.

337
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:26,160
Well, we talked about Steam on Linux and a great way to use that is on Solus.

338
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:33,240
And this week, Solus have announced preliminary KDE Plasma support, something that iKey was

339
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:41,360
very reluctant to do before he said that they needed to have a maintainer for it.

340
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:46,340
And it looks like they have found a maintainer, Peter O'Connor.

341
00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:49,600
And so it doesn't quite work yet.

342
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:55,720
It's not officially supported, but it is coming very soon by the looks of things that you'll

343
00:20:55,720 --> 00:21:00,520
be able to have a proper Plasma desktop on top of Solus, which is just going to increase

344
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:05,360
their potential user base massively because maybe you don't like GTK.

345
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:08,480
Maybe you're a KDE user, have been for a long time.

346
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:12,680
Well now, once this gets worked out and the bugs are squashed and it's all working, you'll

347
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:14,040
be able to use Solus.

348
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:17,480
I like the way iKey wrote this post because he kind of gives the background on how this

349
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:19,400
happened and it makes a lot of sense.

350
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:24,120
Essentially there were big ticket items that were using the KDE frameworks like KDE Live

351
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:27,880
and K3b that they essentially needed somebody's help with anyways.

352
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:31,560
And so Peter comes on, he seems to be pretty ambitious about this whole thing, and he acknowledges

353
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:33,320
it's early days with this.

354
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:37,920
But if the community works with him, I think you might end up finding the Plasma desktop

355
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:40,880
being one of the premier desktops of Solus.

356
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:44,200
And if they're going to continue to bring in more cute stuff too, why not have somebody

357
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:45,720
that's on top of that?

358
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:48,820
He also broke out the whole team there of maintainers.

359
00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:49,820
Makes a lot of sense.

360
00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:53,320
As somebody who's running Plasma for a while, I was using it on Arch and Neon and Solus

361
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:54,320
would be a great addition to that.

362
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:56,160
I mean, it seems like a great mix.

363
00:21:56,160 --> 00:22:00,200
And recently Solus is one of the distributions that switched over to that NVIDIA driver that

364
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:02,480
has the Vulkan support to make Steam VR work.

365
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:05,680
So you could really get yourself a pretty nice setup going if you're a Plasma desktop

366
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:09,840
user that wants some of the latest Steam stuff and it could be just a great distribution

367
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:11,300
for that class of user.

368
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:17,100
And you know, I can't help but feel that Plasma is going to get more users very soon because

369
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:18,100
of Ubuntu.

370
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:19,100
It sounds a bit strange.

371
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:24,720
You think, well, hang on, surely Ubuntu getting rid of Unity and going to GNOME is going to

372
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:30,400
mean you're going to have more GNOME users, but the reality is that it's just not that

373
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:31,400
good GNOME.

374
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:34,680
I mean, is that a controversial thing to say?

375
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:36,000
It seems to be a bit crashy.

376
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:41,840
You were talking about the OBS box crashing quite a lot, at least once a week.

377
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:42,840
Once a day.

378
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:43,840
Yeah.

379
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:44,840
Well, yeah.

380
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:45,840
Yeah.

381
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:46,840
I've realized it's much more often.

382
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:48,040
In fact, I now have multiple issues with it.

383
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:49,040
Yeah, you're right.

384
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:52,240
I was talking about that on user 10 and it is, if you want to know more, I did a little

385
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:56,040
deep diving into what I consider some of the core performance issues with GNOME.

386
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:57,040
Yeah.

387
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:59,200
And that's what got me thinking about it.

388
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:04,760
The thing is that KDE Plasma has just got better and better and better over the last

389
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:06,000
year or so.

390
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:13,340
And every time I try it, it seems to just be better and more stable and run perfectly.

391
00:23:13,340 --> 00:23:20,920
And so it has me thinking that if you want a modern desktop, I love XFCE, I quite like

392
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:27,320
Marte, but KDE, if you want something really modern, they really are pushing the boundaries.

393
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:33,160
And Qt, to me, seems like a better long-term commitment if you're a developer, because

394
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:37,160
GTK is just this constantly shifting goalposts.

395
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:38,640
I think GTK is getting there.

396
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:41,120
I think they're about to announce 4.0.

397
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:42,840
They're working on a latest release.

398
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:44,600
I think they're really getting there now with GTK.

399
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:50,000
It's starting to calm down, so that criticism will be less of a concern as they land on

400
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,000
that.

401
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:58,420
I think the main attraction to GNOME is for people that are switching from macOS or Windows,

402
00:23:58,420 --> 00:23:59,800
where it's so noisy.

403
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:01,400
There's so much stuff they're throwing at you.

404
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:04,080
They're even now putting ads in your launcher.

405
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:06,460
It's so much input to your brain.

406
00:24:06,460 --> 00:24:09,920
You just want to get your terminal and your text editor and your browser and have a clean

407
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:12,300
environment, and GNOME is that.

408
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:16,780
As much as I love Plasma, the reason why I actually switched back to the GNOME shell

409
00:24:16,780 --> 00:24:23,720
was three and a half months and change into my Plasma 5 desktop re-experiment again.

410
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:28,000
When I was really busy and really trying to rush, I found myself getting flustered on

411
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,920
how to use the UI and where certain things were in Dolphin or accidentally closing the

412
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:35,280
wrong pane and still not picking up on some of the UI cues.

413
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:39,520
So I decided for my own work efficiency, it was faster if I just switched back to GNOME

414
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:45,560
and ignored some of the surface-level obvious-to-see performance issues in trade-off for a more

415
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:47,640
efficient workflow for me overall.

416
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:48,640
I love Plasma.

417
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:49,640
I think Kaywin's great.

418
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:52,720
I think the transition to Wayland, it's going to be even a stronger contender, but right

419
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:57,040
now UI-wise, GNOME feels like it gets out of my way more.

420
00:24:57,040 --> 00:25:03,660
Well, I can't stand GNOME, I'm afraid, whereas KDE, I've never been a fan, a massive fan

421
00:25:03,660 --> 00:25:05,940
at least, but it's growing on me.

422
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:06,940
What can I say?

423
00:25:06,940 --> 00:25:09,560
And this Solus thing gets me pretty excited.

424
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:10,560
I think that...

425
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:11,560
Are you considering trying it, Joe?

426
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:13,040
Are you considering giving it a go?

427
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:21,700
I am considering it, yeah, because the thing is XFCE is, well, as Aiki described it, is

428
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:23,880
basically dead technology.

429
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:31,520
They're just about porting the panel to GTK3 when GTK4 is about to be released.

430
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:38,920
So I have to think long-term, and Mate is great, and that's my go-to apart from XFCE.

431
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:43,580
But if you're going to move away from XFCE, why not look at all the options?

432
00:25:43,580 --> 00:25:46,480
And GNOME, I just do not like.

433
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:51,360
And anything lighter, like LXDE or LXCUTE, I don't really like.

434
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:56,560
So I'm thinking KDE might be worth a try.

435
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:58,200
I mean, we'll see.

436
00:25:58,200 --> 00:25:59,440
We'll see whether I actually...

437
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:01,200
I'm fascinated by this.

438
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:03,200
I would love to see if you try it.

439
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:04,640
I would love to hear how it goes.

440
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:07,860
I thought it was pretty powerful, very stable for me.

441
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:09,320
Very reliable, good performance.

442
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:11,160
KWIN is butter smooth.

443
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:15,800
I have nothing but positive things to say, other than I found the UI options still overwhelming

444
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:16,800
at the end of the day.

445
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:19,800
And I just felt like I didn't want to feel like a dumbass when I was using my machine.

446
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:22,080
Well, what I really like about it is the configurability.

447
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:28,000
I can make it act exactly like XFCE, essentially, only be based on modern technology.

448
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,000
Yeah.

449
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:33,020
You can definitely make it basically work like any desktop environment you want.

450
00:26:33,020 --> 00:26:34,440
That is one of the nice things about it.

451
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:39,040
It sometimes leads to endless tinkering, but if you can set limits for yourself, it's a

452
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:40,040
really nice setup.

453
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:41,040
Yeah.

454
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:42,040
Well, that's...

455
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:43,040
Yeah, exactly.

456
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:44,040
I wouldn't do that.

457
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:47,920
I would just set it up as I have it set up now, which is basically like Windows XP.

458
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:48,920
And then just...

459
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:49,920
And just leave it.

460
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:50,920
...forget about it.

461
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:51,920
Yeah.

462
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:52,920
Yeah.

463
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:53,920
And what would you run as the base OS, as the underlying distro?

464
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:57,780
Well, I've always been a fan of Ubuntu LTS as a base.

465
00:26:57,780 --> 00:27:03,840
It just seems to be the best compromise because you've got PPAs for anything that you need

466
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:08,840
new versions of, but I'm generally happy with old versions of Labor Office and that kind

467
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:09,840
of thing.

468
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:10,840
I don't need to be...

469
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:15,160
I'm not one of these arch users that has to have the latest of everything, like you.

470
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:16,160
Okay.

471
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:23,280
I wonder if things like flat packs and snap packages, if they are successful, if they

472
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:24,440
will change that.

473
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:27,800
Because when you say PPAs, I cringe a little bit, to be honest with you.

474
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:28,800
Really?

475
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:29,800
Yeah.

476
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:30,800
I just...

477
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:31,800
I'm not a big fan of PPAs anymore.

478
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:36,800
But it was a model that worked for limited distribution for testing software out of Launchpad

479
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:40,040
and became a way to distribute software on the Ubuntu desktop.

480
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:41,040
And it's just...

481
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:42,040
It's so clunky.

482
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:45,920
Like when you subscribe to projects that are maintained by contributors and that contributor

483
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:51,360
stops updating the PPA and you start getting 404s when you try to update your cache repo,

484
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:52,360
it's super obnoxious.

485
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:53,360
Well, yeah.

486
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:57,180
You've got to not go mad and be adding PPAs left, right, and center, but the odd thing,

487
00:27:57,180 --> 00:28:02,600
like get iPlayer, for example, is something that I need a PPA for generally, because I've

488
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:08,000
just upgraded to 16.04 on my main kind of media box, and it's working for now.

489
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:13,000
But when that breaks, I'll have to add a PPA, basically, to make it continue to work.

490
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:16,320
But that's one little command line program.

491
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:19,680
We're not talking about huge things like a desktop or whatever.

492
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:20,680
I agree.

493
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:24,360
If you limit it to a couple of functional PPAs, one or two applications, you're generally

494
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:25,360
fine.

495
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:27,040
And that's something that's pretty popular.

496
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:31,500
If one PPA dies, you can often find a replacement.

497
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:35,760
Maybe for example, you want to subscribe and get the latest developments from Firefox.

498
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:36,760
Hmm.

499
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:37,760
Yeah.

500
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:38,760
Firefox.

501
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:46,520
Now, this week, there was a blog post on Medium by Eric Petit, who is the head of marketing

502
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:47,520
for Firefox.

503
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:52,360
Now, the first sentence in this blog post is, I head up Firefox marketing, but I use

504
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:53,840
Chrome every day.

505
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:54,840
Yeah.

506
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:57,760
If I had a bell, I'd be dinging it, Chris.

507
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:58,760
What?

508
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:04,280
You're the head of marketing, and you use Chrome every day, and you're admitting that

509
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:05,840
first up.

510
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:09,200
Okay, well, let's just try and move past that.

511
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:14,800
And what this blog post is about is browse against the machine, which is a bit of a...

512
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:17,200
I don't know what the word for it is, really.

513
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:18,200
Yeah.

514
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:19,200
It's their new campaign.

515
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:23,880
It's their new campaign to try to make users aware of the differences between Firefox and

516
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:27,840
Chrome, and that Chrome is connected to a larger machine.

517
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:31,900
So you can browse against the machine by electing to use Firefox.

518
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:35,440
And what Eric does here is he tries to build a case for it.

519
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:38,960
He says, Chrome has four times the market share of its nearest competitor, which is

520
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:40,420
Firefox.

521
00:29:40,420 --> 00:29:45,560
He compares it to an eight-lane highway to the largest advertising company in the world.

522
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:50,960
Google built it to maximize revenue from your searches and delivered display ads on millions

523
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:55,960
of websites to monetize every single click.

524
00:29:55,960 --> 00:30:01,520
And today, there exists no meaningful safety valve on its market dominance.

525
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:03,860
So he's trying to build this as like a war.

526
00:30:03,860 --> 00:30:07,140
This is the battle for the web.

527
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:12,480
And so he's building Firefox up as this way to manage this.

528
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:16,000
Today, Firefox is better than it was even a year ago.

529
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,000
It's faster.

530
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,000
It lags less.

531
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,800
It hogs much less memory than Chrome.

532
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:23,920
And in June, we'll release a multi-process Firefox, putting us at performance parity

533
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:28,780
with Chrome in most of the ways mere humans can actually perceive.

534
00:30:28,780 --> 00:30:32,940
It's because of this newfound internal confidence with Firefox that Mozilla has started to become

535
00:30:32,940 --> 00:30:34,760
more aggressive again.

536
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:38,440
And they are announcing the browsing against the machine campaign with a renewed posture

537
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:41,500
for Firefox and a return to their roots.

538
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:43,900
So they've got these five points, right?

539
00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:45,280
The first one, Firefox is leaner.

540
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:46,280
It takes up less memory.

541
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:47,280
Blah, blah, blah.

542
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:48,280
OK.

543
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:49,280
So that's a technical argument.

544
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:52,360
The other four are four different ways of saying we're not Chrome.

545
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:53,360
Yes.

546
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:57,140
That's their biggest argument for why you should use Firefox, we're not Chrome.

547
00:30:57,140 --> 00:30:59,600
Their last part is we're Mozilla, not Google, basically.

548
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:00,600
Yeah.

549
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:01,600
Yeah.

550
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:02,600
Yeah.

551
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:03,600
And then they've actually, boy, it's weak.

552
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:07,060
Firefox is not built by and for the largest advertising company in the world.

553
00:31:07,060 --> 00:31:08,060
So there's that.

554
00:31:08,060 --> 00:31:11,520
That's literally what they put in the sentence.

555
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:13,520
Or Eric did, I guess.

556
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:14,520
Yeah.

557
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:15,520
Yeah.

558
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:19,060
There is a lot of bark here.

559
00:31:19,060 --> 00:31:20,260
There's definitely a lot of bark.

560
00:31:20,260 --> 00:31:24,760
I don't know where the bite's at exactly.

561
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:29,060
It does land a little soft because he admits he uses Chrome every day.

562
00:31:29,060 --> 00:31:30,980
And he goes on to say that, you know, it's fine.

563
00:31:30,980 --> 00:31:32,980
I use it because I am logged into different stuff.

564
00:31:32,980 --> 00:31:36,900
And I have some stuff in Chrome and I have some stuff in Firefox.

565
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:45,800
But I feel like Eric here, so just like Mozilla was fighting the mobile battle with Firefox

566
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:51,640
OS too late, Firefox is too late in responding to Chrome.

567
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:54,400
It's the same story over again, unfortunately.

568
00:31:54,400 --> 00:32:00,840
But they're so caught up on this solid moral reason, we need an open competitor for the

569
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:01,840
web.

570
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:06,520
They're so caught up on the technical achievements they've made with the improvements to Firefox

571
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:10,360
that they're losing the fact that they themselves are Chrome users.

572
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:11,360
Yeah.

573
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:19,880
And Andreas Gal, who was the former CTO of Mozilla, wrote a response to this, well, not

574
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:26,800
really a response, but kind of a follow up article looking at the numbers of market share.

575
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:30,880
And it does not look good for Firefox at all.

576
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:36,860
You basically got two graphs, one going up and one going down, and Chrome is the one

577
00:32:36,860 --> 00:32:37,860
going up.

578
00:32:37,860 --> 00:32:41,280
And it doesn't really matter which way you look at it.

579
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:43,120
People are not using Firefox anymore.

580
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:46,360
There are a small number of us still out there and I still use it.

581
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:51,080
I'm using it right now to look at this blog post, but I am in the minority.

582
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:52,080
Yeah.

583
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:56,800
He says at the macro level, it's safe to say that Chrome is eating the entire browser market.

584
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:59,480
Everyone else except for Safari is getting obliterated.

585
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:03,480
Safari is treading water as Apple sells iOS devices.

586
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:08,720
If the six year trend holds, IE should be pretty much dead in two or three years.

587
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:11,860
And Firefox is not faring much better, unfortunately.

588
00:33:11,860 --> 00:33:16,540
It's headed towards a two to three percent market share if the trends hold.

589
00:33:16,540 --> 00:33:23,160
Now this, like Joe said, not only was he the CTO, but he was pretty much the head guy behind

590
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:25,680
the Firefox OS project.

591
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:31,280
So he really helped bring it to scale and he's coming at this now with perspective of

592
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:36,600
a failed project and he says, look at our Firefox usage on Android, where mobile is

593
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:39,800
now a huge part of the web usage.

594
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:43,840
Firefox and Firefox Focus on Android have close to zero percent market share.

595
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:44,840
Yeah.

596
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:46,080
Now I have Firefox on Android.

597
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:47,080
Me too.

598
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:53,160
But I just use it for sites that I want to be logged into different accounts of basically.

599
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:54,160
Yeah.

600
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:55,640
You're not using it for your daily driving.

601
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:58,160
No, I've tried and it's just terrible.

602
00:33:58,160 --> 00:33:59,640
And what does that do for Mozilla's agenda?

603
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:01,440
That doesn't help them set the web agenda.

604
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:05,120
That doesn't help them drive Firefox adoption really.

605
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:06,320
They need daily users.

606
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:09,040
Yeah, which I still am on the desktop.

607
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:14,120
I had to install Chrome the other day to use Hangouts and I think that's a big factor here.

608
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:18,880
To use any of Google's products, you basically need Chrome.

609
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:25,680
For example, Maps basically doesn't work in Firefox anymore and just crashes constantly.

610
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:32,600
And you can't use Hangouts at all because the plugin isn't supported anymore.

611
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:36,640
Firefox and Drive seems to work reasonably well in Firefox, but if you're going to engage

612
00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:41,120
with Google's services, you basically need their browser.

613
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:45,960
And I don't know if that is them deliberately making it not work in Firefox, but there's

614
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:50,800
two ways you can look at it, either the conspiracy that they've made it deliberately shit in

615
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:57,040
Firefox or the reality they don't care about Firefox and they don't bother testing it.

616
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:59,080
As long as it works in Chrome, they're happy.

617
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:03,240
I speculate it's because it's using standards that Google has proposed, but the industry

618
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:04,640
hasn't quite adopted yet.

619
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:08,360
And eventually Firefox is sort of reluctantly drug into adopting the standards so that way

620
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:10,360
they're compatible with the Google product.

621
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:14,340
I don't even think though it's so much that Google has great services that work better

622
00:35:14,340 --> 00:35:15,340
under Chrome.

623
00:35:15,340 --> 00:35:18,840
I think that's probably definitely part of it for adoption in businesses and things like

624
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:19,840
that.

625
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:26,040
But like Andrea says here in the post, Firefox was really Mozilla's effort to drive the web

626
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:27,480
by building a browser.

627
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:32,160
And they were actually making pretty good headway on that until mobile exploded and

628
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:38,160
the browser came baked into the OS at a whole new level and they completely lost their leverage.

629
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:43,240
And now the web, like you look at our own download stats for this show, Android far

630
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:46,720
and away blows away the desktop downloads.

631
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:53,680
And in fact, iOS, if I recall, is still well above the actual desktop download statistics

632
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:54,680
for this show.

633
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:59,120
Which is a bit of a surprise, isn't it? You'd think that there'd be a lot of people listening

634
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:01,320
on Linux desktops, but apparently not.

635
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:03,320
They're listening on the go, Joe, they're listening on the go.

636
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:06,720
And so they download on their mobile device, which is when they're checking the web on

637
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:08,080
their mobile device, it's the same thing.

638
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:10,080
And I think there's just a lot more of that happening now.

639
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:15,860
Our stats have shown that transition and Firefox has no hold there.

640
00:36:15,860 --> 00:36:19,840
It's really the dominant players either going to be Safari or Chrome or whatever the built

641
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:20,840
in browser.

642
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:24,720
He makes a good point that that strategy was working for Mozilla until that little fact

643
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:25,840
came along.

644
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:29,600
That's why they were so compelled to try Firefox OS, it was just too late.

645
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:30,600
Yeah.

646
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:37,800
But even in enterprise, Gartner came out and said that Chrome is one of the biggest browsers

647
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:39,840
in enterprise now.

648
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:46,880
Most companies still use IE for some things, but they also have Chrome and Firefox is just

649
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:48,580
not going to be an option, is it?

650
00:36:48,580 --> 00:36:54,960
Think about it, if you were setting up someone else, I am setting up a laptop to give away

651
00:36:54,960 --> 00:37:00,720
to someone who doesn't really use much more than a browser.

652
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:03,720
And so I'm sticking Zubuntu on there for him.

653
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:09,320
And Chrome because I know if I give someone Chrome, every website's going to work, YouTube's

654
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:12,080
going to work, everything's going to work perfectly.

655
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:16,240
Whereas I could put Firefox on there and then have to support them.

656
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:21,640
Yeah, I know for myself, my transition to Chrome definitely was firm when it was the

657
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:23,300
easiest way to get Netflix.

658
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:27,200
And that's when I also transitioned fully from Chromium as well is a couple of other

659
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:32,360
sites I go to don't work well under Chromium, work fine under Chrome, like Spotify web player,

660
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:33,360
for example.

661
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:38,640
And so over the last year and a half, where I used to really be a dual browser Firefox

662
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:42,640
Chrome guy, and now I'm Chrome and I'm Chrome private session and I have stuff logged in

663
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:46,480
or personas even, and I really barely use Firefox anymore.

664
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:50,240
And it makes me sad because I think it's a solid browser and I'd love to see Mozilla

665
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:53,900
around for the long haul and I'd love to even see them be influential, but for the services

666
00:37:53,900 --> 00:37:57,800
I use on a literally daily basis, Chrome seems to be better.

667
00:37:57,800 --> 00:38:02,080
And I would argue, Joe, that it doesn't really matter.

668
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:07,620
This battle is maybe over, but the war for other aspects of the internet and the web

669
00:38:07,620 --> 00:38:09,720
in general does rage on.

670
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:14,220
And it seems possible for Firefox to continue on as a desktop browser doing just fine and

671
00:38:14,220 --> 00:38:19,800
for Mozilla as a company to find new areas where somebody needs to blaze standards and

672
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:23,240
blaze innovation where they've done successfully well in the past.

673
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:26,100
They just essentially need to be ready for the next round of technology whenever that

674
00:38:26,100 --> 00:38:27,400
comes so they can be a player.

675
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:29,600
Well, let's hope so.

676
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:32,000
So shall we end with a bit of positive news then?

677
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:37,240
Yeah, I'm really excited to see some progress for Core Boot specifically coming out of Purism.

678
00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:42,280
They have Librem 13 version 2 and 15 version 3 working with Core Boot now.

679
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:45,760
Yeah, it's great to see that they've got a couple of machines now that they're going

680
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:52,440
to ship in June, which are actually going to come with Core Boot all being well.

681
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:55,340
Which was their original promise, wasn't it?

682
00:38:55,340 --> 00:38:56,780
Free software top to bottom.

683
00:38:56,780 --> 00:38:59,000
And a genuine competitive differentiator.

684
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,600
Yeah, I was very skeptical though at first.

685
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:02,880
I was very skeptical of Todd.

686
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:06,760
He talks a good game and I just thought it was absolutely impossible.

687
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:11,420
But fair play to him, he's worked very hard on this and for a very long time.

688
00:39:11,420 --> 00:39:15,240
And they've managed to disable the management engine and stuff.

689
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:18,520
And they seem to really be putting the money where the mouth is.

690
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:22,800
These machines are pretty expensive for what they are, but it seems that that money has

691
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:29,560
been invested back into making them actually run Core Boot.

692
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:33,680
And that's got to be better than some proprietary EFI.

693
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:37,320
The other thing that's cool to see is this sort of pushes the competition up a level

694
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:38,320
in the market.

695
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:42,120
So maybe other manufacturers might be more compelled to try to get this working on their

696
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:43,120
systems.

697
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:45,540
It gets more people using Core Boot, which is good.

698
00:39:45,540 --> 00:39:50,360
And it does give people who are seriously dedicated to this kind of system an option

699
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:52,040
besides a four-year-old ThinkPad.

700
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:54,560
Yeah, or a Chromebook, of course.

701
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:56,560
Yeah, who wouldn't want that?

702
00:39:56,560 --> 00:40:02,240
I don't think the type of customer that wants a Librem is going to compromise with a Chromebook.

703
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:05,280
Although who wants to pesky with all that weird Chromebook issues when you're trying

704
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:06,280
to run Linux?

705
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:07,800
Yeah, which I have.

706
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:08,800
Unless you want...

707
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:09,800
What's that?

708
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:10,800
I can't remember what the disk drive...

709
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:14,280
That's how long it's been since I've even used that machine.

710
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:17,640
There's Crouton, which you can use inside Chrome OS, which seems like not a bad way

711
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:18,640
to go.

712
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:20,120
Yeah, I didn't even bother with that.

713
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:25,320
I just went straight for Gallium OS, which is an XFCE-based disk drive.

714
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:28,560
It's basically Xubuntu, but working on the Chromebook.

715
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:29,560
Yeah, Gallium.

716
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:30,840
I remember that now.

717
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:32,360
I completely forgot about Gallium.

718
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:35,480
Crouton's nice if you don't want to mess with the whole thing and you predominantly use

719
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:39,480
Chrome OS and just need to go to Ubuntu, but Gallium would be a great way to go if your

720
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:41,000
daily driver is going to be Linux.

721
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:48,280
Yeah, and the battery on my Chromebook is so good that I used to use it for media consumption

722
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:49,280
quite a lot.

723
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:53,520
But yeah, I need to dig that out and start using it again, I think.

724
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:57,320
