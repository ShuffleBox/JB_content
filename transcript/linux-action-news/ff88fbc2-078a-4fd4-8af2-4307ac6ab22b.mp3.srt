00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,280
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, our weekly take on Linux and the open source world.

2
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:20,360
This is episode 51, recorded on April 29th, 2018.

3
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:21,360
I'm Chris.

4
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:22,360
And I'm Joe.

5
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:23,360
Hello, Joe.

6
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:26,400
It's good to be back from Linux Fest Northwest and connected with you.

7
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:31,240
We're going to start this week with a story that I saw lots of people sharing online.

8
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:35,520
Ubuntu Touch will officially be an option for the Librem 5.

9
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:41,040
Yeah, Purism have posted about this in a little bit of a confusing way, I must say.

10
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:45,240
They've talked about how there's going to be three options when the Librem 5 ships.

11
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:51,720
It'll either come with PureOS, PureOS with the KDE Plasma Mobile Interface, or Ubuntu

12
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:53,440
Touch.

13
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:57,960
And it wasn't quite clear to me whether that meant that they would be factory installing

14
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:03,200
Ubuntu Touch as an option and maybe contacting their backers shortly before shipping was

15
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:04,200
due.

16
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:10,160
But I asked someone at the Ubiports project, and they said that, no, it won't be pre-installed,

17
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:12,120
but it will be officially supported.

18
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:14,840
So if you want to run it, you will have to flash it yourself.

19
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:16,000
That was my understanding as well.

20
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,200
I did a little double checking, and that was the same.

21
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:22,120
I got a note from somebody at Purism that told me that's how it would work.

22
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:27,240
So Purism by default on the Librem 5, with, like you said, the KDE Plasma Mobile and Ubuntu

23
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:32,120
Touch images officially supported, if we step back from that for a moment and we look at

24
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:35,660
what this is turning into, it's something I can start to get excited about.

25
00:01:35,660 --> 00:01:41,020
The Librem 5 here could become that general phone platform that allows all these different

26
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:45,400
open source projects to have real hardware to try their stuff out on.

27
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:51,200
And that is something that I've been wanting since 2013 when Canonical tried their crowd

28
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:55,000
funder to launch the Edge phone, I think it was called.

29
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,440
And when I saw that, I thought, gosh, you know what would be perfect about that is if

30
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:04,720
it was like a PC where any open source project could load their version of a mobile operating

31
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:05,840
system on there.

32
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:10,760
Or as an end user, I could load something that I chose, just like I do with a PC.

33
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:13,760
The Librem 5 is kind of getting us in that direction.

34
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:17,580
Well, that was the promise, wasn't it, when they first did the crowd funder?

35
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:21,860
And now they are continuing to, well, they haven't delivered on that promise just yet,

36
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:24,840
but they're certainly continuing to promise the same thing.

37
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:30,000
And maybe it could become like the Nexus 4 and 5 were, which were kind of almost like

38
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,760
a reference hardware that everyone would make their ROMs for.

39
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:37,100
And then a little bit later on, it was kind of the OnePlus One.

40
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:42,640
And if the Librem 5 becomes like the ultimate hackable phone, then it's kind of win win

41
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:43,880
for everyone, isn't it?

42
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:48,760
They'll sell a bunch of them and the community will have a reference phone that they can

43
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:49,760
target.

44
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:55,920
The only note of caution that I have here is I think it might be a bit telling that

45
00:02:55,920 --> 00:03:01,840
everyone is very excited about the OS that isn't shipping by default on this phone.

46
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:06,360
There seems to be much more attention to the fact that KDE Plasma Mobile and now Ubuntu

47
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:12,040
Touch will be available on the Librem 5 and nobody in the public seems all that excited

48
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:13,040
about PureOS.

49
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:17,160
Well, I'm not sure how fair that is really because PureOS is essentially Debian, isn't

50
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:18,160
it?

51
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:19,520
It's certainly Debian based.

52
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:25,280
So it means having a proper GNU slash Linux distro running with just a mobile interface,

53
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:31,920
like the old Nokia, was it the N900 that was running MeeGo that was Debian underneath.

54
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:37,000
And so there are a lot of people who want to have a proper GNU slash Linux phone.

55
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:44,480
So maybe that hype was kind of reserved for the original announcement of it.

56
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:50,240
Whereas now we're getting these announcements about KDE and Ubuntu Touch.

57
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:53,920
That's just where the buzz is going to be because the buzz about PureOS was kind of

58
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:54,920
at the beginning.

59
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:56,120
I'd say that's a fair assessment.

60
00:03:56,120 --> 00:04:01,560
I do wonder if the unknown quantity of PureOS also kind of leaves me a little unenthused

61
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:03,400
and I don't feel like it's just me.

62
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:06,920
It's kind of been a general tood that I think I've picked up when people are talking about

63
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:08,360
the Librem 5.

64
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:10,160
But perhaps they'll surprise us.

65
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:14,640
I'm totally willing to be pleasantly surprised by what they turn out with PureOS Mobile.

66
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:18,760
Yeah, and I was kind of a bit concerned that they were hedging their bets too much.

67
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:24,640
But from speaking to the people at UbiPorts, it's very much a hands off approach.

68
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:29,640
It's like they will give them some hardware and support them as much as they can, but

69
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:34,200
they're not going to devote loads of time and resources to developing Ubuntu Touch on

70
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:35,200
it.

71
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:39,200
They'll just facilitate that happening as best they can and give it their official stamp

72
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:43,280
of approval, presumably pending some QA testing and stuff.

73
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:44,760
I think that makes a lot of sense.

74
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:48,100
It does make a lot of sense from a business point of view and it makes more sense from

75
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:52,240
a kind of consumer point of view if you know that there's this backup available.

76
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:59,080
I really wish that they would work with the lineage OS people because if you had that

77
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:06,480
Android root as a fallback, then I'd be much more interested in buying the phone because

78
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:07,840
PureOS is complete unknown.

79
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,680
We just don't know what it's going to be like.

80
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:10,680
It might be amazing.

81
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:11,680
It might be terrible.

82
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:14,240
We know what Ubuntu Touch is like.

83
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,640
It's kind of in development still.

84
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:18,720
It's not really daily driver worthy, I don't think.

85
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:23,840
Whereas I know that with lineage, even with F-Droid, even without the Google apps, you

86
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:26,560
could use it as a daily driver phone.

87
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:29,760
And so I would like to see them talk more about that.

88
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:33,800
They did mention it very early on and I know that the way Purism works, they're very good

89
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:34,800
at marketing.

90
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:39,300
They kind of drip feed everyone these announcements to keep them in the news and everything.

91
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:43,200
So we might well be seeing that announcement soon that it will be kind of officially supported.

92
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:45,120
I really, really hope so for everyone's sake.

93
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,360
Yep, I completely agree.

94
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:47,440
I couldn't have said it better myself.

95
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:51,840
In fact, while we're talking about Purism, let's update everybody on their efforts to

96
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:54,480
reverse engineer the Intel FSP.

97
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:58,560
I think we've got some really big details, some good technical things we can really dig

98
00:05:58,560 --> 00:05:59,560
into, Joe.

99
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:00,560
Yeah.

100
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:05,480
Well, unfortunately, by the time I read the post about this, Intel had been in touch with

101
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:11,400
them and demanded, well, at least asked nicely that they removed the technical details.

102
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:14,720
And so now we don't know exactly how they've made the progress that they've made.

103
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:15,720
Yeah.

104
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:16,720
And now that's the story.

105
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:17,720
Exactly.

106
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:20,560
If Intel hadn't have done that, then we might not have even been talking about this.

107
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:26,600
It would have been just another update in the long saga of reverse engineering the proprietary

108
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:29,020
bits of the Intel firmware.

109
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:31,320
And it might have got a quick mention here and there.

110
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:35,240
But now Intel have kind of got the Streisand effect here, haven't they?

111
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:36,240
Yeah.

112
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:39,340
And it also tells you that they must have been getting pretty close to the mark.

113
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:42,920
And then it leads one to wonder, what's Intel's end game?

114
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:46,040
Are they going to do this everywhere that somebody tries to do this?

115
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:49,820
Is it because there's a security concern they don't want people to know about?

116
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:52,840
Is it because they're going to launch a competitive product?

117
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:54,840
And I'm not sure what their angle is here.

118
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:57,700
And I think it just leaves more questions and makes people wonder.

119
00:06:57,700 --> 00:07:01,960
And like you said, always leads to more attention on the internet.

120
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:07,200
It never goes in the direction companies want it to go when they do stuff like this on the

121
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,200
internet.

122
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:09,200
Yeah.

123
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:13,240
I do wonder if it's just the legal department doing what they see as their job.

124
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:15,360
Because Intel's a fairly big company.

125
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:22,040
And it's not like a small business like Jupyter Broadcasting where you know exactly what's

126
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:23,960
going on with everything.

127
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:27,020
You have different departments, don't you, in these big companies?

128
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:34,200
And so it might well be that only one division of it was interested in this.

129
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:37,600
And the rest of the company is kind of thinking, well, now maybe we shouldn't have done that.

130
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:42,360
So am I making excuses for Intel there by saying that?

131
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:43,360
Maybe I am.

132
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,920
Because this is not a very nice thing to do, is it?

133
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:51,940
If you've got people working hard on trying to make things free and open, and you are

134
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:57,920
just trying to stop that and somewhat succeeding in stopping that, then I don't want to use

135
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:58,920
the word evil.

136
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:00,240
But it's getting close, isn't it?

137
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:05,120
I think we'll know where to peg this on the evil meter depending on what happens next.

138
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:08,880
Is purism going to be locked down from sharing future information?

139
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:12,240
Are they going to have some sort of legal action that they get involved with to stop

140
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,240
them?

141
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:17,000
Or is it just going to go away, and they're going to have a great conversation, and everyone

142
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,320
will just be on the same page?

143
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:21,000
We don't know yet.

144
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,000
But depending on which one of those things happens will help us peg their motivations

145
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,960
and their evilness in this issue.

146
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:27,960
Yeah.

147
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:28,960
Yeah.

148
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:29,960
Well, time will tell on that one.

149
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:34,480
Well, speaking of being evil and not being evil, let's talk about Chrome OS.

150
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:39,680
And it seems that we are a step closer to being able to run proper Linux applications

151
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:40,680
on Chrome OS.

152
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:41,680
Yeah.

153
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:46,720
That's the worst-held secret, because more and more evidence just keeps coming out.

154
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:51,480
And entrepreneur Reddit users are digging through development builds, and they have

155
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:56,760
found evidence of a new Linux terminal feature coming, as well as perhaps even more than

156
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:57,760
that.

157
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:58,760
Yeah.

158
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:01,440
These Linux applications are going to be running in containers, by the looks of things.

159
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:04,560
It looks like installing this terminal will download the various bits and pieces that

160
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:07,260
you need to make those containers run.

161
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:13,840
And then you'll have proper native-ish Linux applications, which suddenly makes Chrome

162
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:16,800
OS a much more attractive proposition, doesn't it?

163
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:19,840
And it surprised me how far they seem to be taking this.

164
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:26,440
So these Linux apps on Chrome OS are going to also have a full-fledged GTK theme that

165
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:31,860
is based off of Adaptea, a popular material-designed GTK theme.

166
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:36,680
And they are strapping in a sort of a more eccentric, bluish kind of more what they call

167
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:38,320
an electric version of the theme.

168
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:43,000
So when these Linux applications launch, they'll sort of fit in with Google's material look

169
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,240
that you see in GApps and other Google properties.

170
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:51,720
This is a step I didn't actually see coming, but I guess it does kind of complete the product.

171
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:56,160
Well, yes, but I didn't see it coming, because I had pictured this in the same way that you

172
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:59,520
see the subsystem for Linux on Windows.

173
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:03,200
I thought it was going to be command-line applications aimed at developers.

174
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:08,960
Why do you need to have the terminal themed with a GTK theme that looks all material-designed

175
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:12,160
and everything, unless you're going to have GUI applications?

176
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:14,960
Which begs the question, what are we going to get here?

177
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:18,580
Are we going to get a full repository, or what?

178
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:21,680
Is it going to be a few proprietary applications like Skype?

179
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:23,160
Is it going to be snaps, or what?

180
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:24,160
Who knows?

181
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:28,520
And those entrepreneur users I mentioned over at Reddit have already gotten Wine and Android

182
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:32,360
Studio running on these Chromebooks with this development channel.

183
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:35,680
So it's pretty complicated applications that you can get up and running with this thing.

184
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:39,600
Well, I'm not surprised that members of the community have managed to hack it and get

185
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,240
these graphical applications running.

186
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:43,120
They did that on the subsystem for Windows.

187
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:50,600
But it seems that with this GTK theme that Google's going to support that sort of natively

188
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:51,600
and officially.

189
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:54,520
Yeah, this development just got a lot more interesting.

190
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:58,840
I did not expect this strong of an end-user angle to the story.

191
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:01,800
So definitely going to be following this one with some interest.

192
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:07,000
Yeah, and it could be very good news for the rest of the Linux community, because Chromebooks

193
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,240
are a massive install base compared to the Linux desktop.

194
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:15,040
And if you've got Linux applications available for Chrome OS, then it's going to mean a lot

195
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:19,680
more development resources go towards that, and a lot more eyes on the code, and just

196
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,240
all of the good stuff that comes with that.

197
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:23,280
So I am quite hopeful for this.

198
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:24,280
Me too.

199
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:26,520
And I mean, just selfishly, I think about my kids.

200
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:31,560
I would love to be able to just buy them Chromebooks that could run Linux applications.

201
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:35,400
They have Chromebooks as part of their school curriculum already.

202
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:40,720
So this might also mean that thousands of students in the US that have these Chromebooks

203
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:43,640
may also start to get desktop Linux applications.

204
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:44,880
Well, you never know.

205
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:47,760
You might even end up being able to run Firefox on a Chromebook.

206
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:48,760
That'd be something, wouldn't it?

207
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:50,320
I hadn't thought of that.

208
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:52,640
That might be the first thing I'd try.

209
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:53,640
Definitely, yeah.

210
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:58,360
Well, speaking of Linux applications, one of the biggest ones is GIMP, the GNU Image

211
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:00,280
Manipulation Program.

212
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:03,500
And that has had a massive update this week.

213
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:09,200
Version 2.10 is out, and I think this is the biggest release of a GIMP I've ever witnessed.

214
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:14,520
One thing that's immediately noticeable about the new GIMP is they have a dark theme that

215
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:18,520
they say focuses on the content and less on the UI.

216
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:20,320
And I got to say, it actually does look pretty good.

217
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:26,320
It sort of takes that UI oversaturation that I used to get from GIMP and turns it down

218
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,320
a few notches.

219
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:29,320
So they've actually successfully pulled it off.

220
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:32,260
But the stuff they've been working on for a long time, that's like all the goodies that

221
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:37,360
are on the back end, like the new implementation of GEGL, which is a big prerequisite for what

222
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:41,820
they're going to be working on in future versions of GIMP, like non-destructive editing, high-bit

223
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:47,580
depth support for colors, up to 32-bit color channels now, multi-threading that allows

224
00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:50,520
GIMP to use multiple cores for processing.

225
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:55,380
And if you've got the OpenCL driver set up, GPU side processing as well.

226
00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:59,120
And that's just the tip of the iceberg on the new stuff that's coming to GIMP.

227
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:03,560
This is a massive, massive release and really has them positioned, too, for future releases

228
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:07,640
like way, way down the road and even more immediate releases that might feature things

229
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:10,120
like GTK3 support soon.

230
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:17,180
Also, one of my personal favorite new features in GIMP 2.10 is now it has baked-in darktable

231
00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:19,860
support for opening RAW files.

232
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:23,060
So now my darktable and my GIMP can work together.

233
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:24,060
It's a kumbaya, Joe.

234
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:27,360
Yeah, I don't think we can really overstate how big this update is.

235
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:30,920
I mean, it's been six years since the last major update.

236
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:33,040
And this changes the game, I think.

237
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:36,960
It makes it into something that professionals could actually use.

238
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:40,560
Whereas before, if you really wanted to, you kind of could.

239
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:44,520
But now they've really pushed the features and the backend stuff that you're talking

240
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:50,860
about and made it really, I think, a professional-grade application.

241
00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:56,120
And they've also improved import and export of Adobe PSD files.

242
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:59,600
And I'm particularly curious to see how that works, open up some of our old Photoshop files

243
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:02,960
that artists have sent us stuff and see if I can work with them in GIMP now.

244
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:06,760
Well, you kind of could do that already, but it's good to see improvements there because

245
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:07,960
sometimes it was a bit flaky.

246
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:11,600
I mean, I've got quite a few old Photoshop files and everything.

247
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:16,520
And I think that maybe the support for the older versions of Photoshop were better, but

248
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:19,680
now you're going to have the more modern versions of Photoshop supported there.

249
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:20,680
So that's good as well.

250
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:23,480
Yeah, one of the things they improved with their Photoshop file support is the different

251
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:24,680
light layer.

252
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:27,840
In Photoshop, you can have hard light, vivid light, these different things.

253
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:30,720
GIMP used to drop that when you would save to PSD.

254
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:35,440
And that has been added now, which is something that's great for outlines and borders of some

255
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:39,400
of the artwork that has been sent into the network, is people use that functionality

256
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:40,600
and GIMP would just lose it.

257
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:42,240
It would just like couldn't see it at all.

258
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:45,320
So I'm very happy that's in there because I think that's going to solve some of the

259
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:46,320
problems we had here.

260
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:51,440
Again, kind of a personal reason I like these updates, but it's really good stuff to see.

261
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:54,920
And I think there's so much stuff in here, it's going to be like that for everybody.

262
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:55,920
Yeah.

263
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:57,960
And I kind of introduced this by saying it's a Linux application.

264
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:58,960
Of course it is.

265
00:14:58,960 --> 00:14:59,960
That's what we know it for.

266
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:03,560
But don't forget that it is also available on Windows and Mac.

267
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:08,520
And it's a good kind of taster for people of free and open source software.

268
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:13,200
And it's that old adage of how you convert people over to Linux is first you start with

269
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:14,200
the application.

270
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:19,440
So if you can install this and Firefox and Thunderbird or whatever on a Windows box,

271
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,480
then it's much easier to make the transition.

272
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:27,560
And now that it's this free alternative to Photoshop that is really up there in terms

273
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:31,640
of features, I think it's going to be a much easier sell for people.

274
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:35,400
They're thinking, well, why am I paying this money for Creative Cloud when really I only

275
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:37,100
need this set of features?

276
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:40,640
And maybe if I move over to GIMP, then I'm going to save myself a bunch of money.

277
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:50,760
And then they kind of see the joys of free and open source software.

278
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:55,760
You can get a system spun up on their infrastructure in less than 55 seconds.

279
00:15:55,760 --> 00:16:02,080
Everything uses SSDs from the $5 a month droplets that are unbelievably good priced all the

280
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:06,800
way up to the systems that have hundreds of gigs of RAMs, lots of the CPUs, lots of all

281
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:07,960
the things.

282
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:12,600
Everything's using SSD in between, including their spaces storage and their block storage,

283
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:16,400
which makes it super easy to add additional storage to your droplets.

284
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:22,160
And they have Ubuntu, CentOS, Debian, Fedora, CoreOS, and free BSD to choose from, dio.co

285
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:23,220
slash action.

286
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:27,220
Go there and try it out and get a $100 credit for a new account.

287
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:32,760
If you sign up at dio.co slash action, they'll give you $100 of DigitalOcean credit to play

288
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:33,760
around.

289
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:35,360
Now, my favorite rig is three cents an hour.

290
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:39,000
So think about how long $100 is going to last you.

291
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:43,220
And something you can play around with that I don't ever really talk about is the DigitalOcean

292
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:45,640
command line for your Linux box.

293
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:51,680
The DOCTL is an open source utility for managing your droplets and other resources from your

294
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:52,680
command line.

295
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:56,220
Now, I'm not telling you how to do your job, but you put that magic sauce in a drop down

296
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:58,040
terminal like your wake or quake.

297
00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:01,000
You hit that F12 key, boom, you got your DOCTL right there.

298
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,180
You're issuing commands, you hit F12, that thing slides right back up.

299
00:17:04,180 --> 00:17:06,040
It's beautiful.

300
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:07,440
You can build a system.

301
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:09,120
It's unbelievably fast.

302
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:10,480
You can put it in production.

303
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:16,440
You can use it for testing, or you can just use it to learn, dio.co slash action.

304
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:23,660
Okay, let's talk about Ubuntu, 1804 LTS was released this week.

305
00:17:23,660 --> 00:17:30,320
The first LTS of the desktop with the new GNOME interface and also a huge release for

306
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:34,160
the cloud and IoT and containers and all that kind of stuff.

307
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:38,720
But I suppose we should probably start with the desktop and its flavors, so 1804 proper

308
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:41,120
and all the flavors have been released.

309
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:43,120
That means it's an LTS of Kubuntu.

310
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:50,400
We have an LTS of Zubuntu, as well as Ubuntu Budgie, Ubuntu Studio, Kylin, and Ubuntu Mate.

311
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,980
And they're all really, really great releases.

312
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:56,880
If you're an Ubuntu user, you have a tough decision ahead of you.

313
00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:00,840
Let's start with Mate, because I've talked a lot with Martin Wimpress about their journey,

314
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:03,320
their multi-year journey to this release.

315
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:07,280
We have the improved Mutiny desktop layout, which comes with that keyboard-friendly HUD

316
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:09,160
just like Unity did.

317
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:14,920
This is a very faithful re-implementation of the Unity desktop, and it's based on Mate

318
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:21,620
1.20, which means you're getting high DPI support, quarter window tiling, hardware acceleration

319
00:18:21,620 --> 00:18:28,360
in Marco, the window manager, when supported, and Joe's favorite feature, color emojis.

320
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:33,240
I think it's quite telling that you've started with Ubuntu Mate rather than Ubuntu proper,

321
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:39,560
because there are things to talk about with Ubuntu proper, but ultimately, it's not very

322
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:41,520
different from 17.10, is it?

323
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:44,480
As we suspected, I think, there was nothing too bold here.

324
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:46,640
17.10 was really supposed to be a proving ground.

325
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:49,020
That way, 18.04 would be really solid.

326
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:54,000
And the reality is, the flavors based around Ubuntu haven't been going through this massive

327
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
transition.

328
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,920
So this has really been a polished cycle for them.

329
00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:03,040
Personally, I am very excited about Kubuntu 18.04.

330
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:09,880
It's the perfect lining up of Plasma 5.12 LTS, Qt LTS, and of course, Ubuntu 18.04 LTS.

331
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:16,160
So for three years, it's LTS across the entire stack, from the kernel up to the user land

332
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:17,160
applications.

333
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:21,760
That's huge for me, personally, in my production environment, deploying that everywhere this

334
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:22,760
week.

335
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:24,440
Very excited about Kubuntu 18.04.

336
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:31,040
It's not that Ubuntu proper isn't a great product, it's exactly what it needs to be,

337
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:33,360
just a solid, predictable release.

338
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:36,200
Yeah, one thing of note, you mentioned the various flavors there.

339
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:38,200
Ubuntu Studio is not an LTS.

340
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:40,840
That's only getting nine months, which is very unusual.

341
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:45,000
But that's because that particular project is kind of a little bit up in the air at the

342
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
moment.

343
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,320
They're restructuring, and they just cannot commit at the moment to a full three years

344
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:50,760
on 18.04.

345
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:55,240
So we'll have to see how 18.10 shakes out for them, which is a bit of a shame.

346
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:59,360
But I suppose in the meantime, you still got Xubuntu, which I've tried out.

347
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:02,200
And again, I love it as usual.

348
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:04,000
There's just not much to say about it.

349
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:08,720
They've swapped out some of the GNOME applications for Marte applications, but really, you don't

350
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:11,240
really notice the difference, or at least I don't.

351
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:15,040
They just do what they're supposed to do and just stay out of the way.

352
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:17,720
And it's just yet another solid release from Xubuntu.

353
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:21,400
I wish I had more to say about it to try and sell it, but it's what I've been using for

354
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:22,680
10 years now.

355
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:27,520
I think 8.04 was the first one that I used, so it is exactly 10 years, and I've never

356
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:28,640
had a problem with it.

357
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:33,020
It's nice, though, to see that Xubuntu's default theme, Greybird GTK, got an update with improved

358
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:34,020
high DPI support.

359
00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:39,760
But shifting away from the desktop just for a moment, I think this is also accumulation

360
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:41,800
of a lot of efforts by Canonical.

361
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:47,760
18.04 ships with a ton of applications available as a SNAP, and SNAPs are first-class citizens

362
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:48,980
in 18.04 now.

363
00:20:48,980 --> 00:20:51,960
They're also in an extremely good position market-wise.

364
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:56,920
The market's very hungry for this next release and very comfortable that 16.04 is going to

365
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:58,040
be updated for a while.

366
00:20:58,040 --> 00:21:02,400
This is a great position because the current product, 16.04, isn't failing.

367
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:05,540
People are totally happy with it, but the new product is compelling.

368
00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:07,560
That's a strong move for Canonical.

369
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:12,160
Then you look at some of their future partnerships that they have to push 18.04 around.

370
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:16,160
For example, the upcoming update to Windows, which will make it easy to deploy Ubuntu inside

371
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:19,840
Hyper-V, and Canonical and Microsoft work together to tailor that.

372
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:24,440
In their announcement, they have quotes in here from Google's product manager at Cloud

373
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:28,920
AI talking about how 18.04 is going to be a great OS for them with machine learning

374
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:30,480
and artificial intelligence.

375
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:31,960
This is a strong release.

376
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:37,320
It is, and one of my favorite things about it is this minimal install option.

377
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:41,300
We talked about that when it was announced, but it's all I'm going to do from now on,

378
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:42,300
on any flavor.

379
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:43,300
100%.

380
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:44,300
I want to underscore that point.

381
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:47,880
I am so pleased with the way this minimal installer thing has turned out across all

382
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:48,880
the flavors.

383
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:51,720
I've used it for all the Kubuntu systems we deployed, and it's perfect.

384
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:54,000
I didn't really feel like anything was missing.

385
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,560
I don't need the PIM suite.

386
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:57,960
I have all the basic essentials.

387
00:21:57,960 --> 00:22:02,620
They nailed this feature so well that it leaves you thinking, why the hell wasn't this done

388
00:22:02,620 --> 00:22:03,620
years ago?

389
00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:04,620
Yeah.

390
00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:09,480
Well, Zebuntu was the first flavor to think about it and implement it, blazing the trail

391
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:10,480
there.

392
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:11,480
Yeah.

393
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:13,880
But that was with a separate ISO, whereas now, as part of the installer, it just makes

394
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:15,160
so much more sense to me.

395
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:16,160
Yeah.

396
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:20,320
And although we underplayed the GNOME desktop release, they did polish it up a little bit.

397
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:25,920
It looks nice, and the Nautilus theme, I think, is the classiest-looking one I've seen on

398
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:26,920
any desktop.

399
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:28,400
But these are just my first impressions.

400
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:34,520
I honestly plan to let 1804 and its different flavors marinate for a while in my studio,

401
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:38,560
and then I'm going to do a follow-up review in a week or two with some several weeks'

402
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:40,360
experience with the released version.

403
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:41,360
Yeah.

404
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:46,900
And I think that realistically, you have to wait for the 0.1 release for most people to

405
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:48,660
actually upgrade to this.

406
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:53,440
People who install an LTS, stay on it, and then wait to be prompted by the GUI updater

407
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:57,220
before they actually do it, they're not going to see this yet.

408
00:22:57,220 --> 00:23:03,640
And that gives a little bit more time for Canonical to polish it and make sure all of

409
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:09,360
the corner cases are sorted out before you have this mass upgrade when the 0.1 release

410
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:10,360
happens.

411
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:13,320
But Joe, who has time to wait around for a 0.1 release?

412
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:16,360
I've got Nintendo Switches to install Ubuntu on.

413
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:17,360
Gotta get going.

414
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:21,740
Yeah, Ewan West covered this exploit for the Switch in TechSnap 365, so go and have a listen

415
00:23:21,740 --> 00:23:23,640
to that if you want to hear more technical details.

416
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:29,600
But it was just funny to see Ubuntu 1804, the desktop, running on a Switch.

417
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:33,480
But as you can see in the photo of it, there is a USB cable plugged into it, which shows

418
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:36,520
that it is still a tethered jailbreak, as they say.

419
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:40,080
But I have to say, it seems like it's more functional than if you were to install Ubuntu

420
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:45,220
on a MacBook, because they've got 3D acceleration, it's got Wi-Fi, the touchscreen works, Bluetooth

421
00:23:45,220 --> 00:23:48,480
seems to be working, and the light sensor seems to be working.

422
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:52,260
What isn't working at this point is audio and Joy-Cons, but something tells me that's

423
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:53,680
not too far behind.

424
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:55,400
Yeah, probably.

425
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:58,940
One thing we haven't mentioned is the move back to Xorg.

426
00:23:58,940 --> 00:24:01,120
They're not shipping Wayland by default anymore.

427
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:05,620
Again, we talked about that when it was announced, but I said it was sensible then, and I say

428
00:24:05,620 --> 00:24:11,700
it's sensible now, because this is a long-term support release, five years for the main version.

429
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:15,660
It just makes total sense to me, stick on X for now, and then they'll probably go back

430
00:24:15,660 --> 00:24:20,920
to Wayland for 18.10, and then hopefully by 2024 it will be ready.

431
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:23,600
You'd think in a couple of years it would be, but you never know.

432
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:25,200
I do think it was the right move.

433
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:30,400
As I was deploying it here in the studio, and one, two, three, four boxes now have it

434
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:34,960
in here, and I just thought to myself, you know, I'm really glad I don't have this unknown

435
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:35,960
quantity.

436
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:40,120
I like Wayland, and I don't mind even using it on my workstation, but here in the studio

437
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:45,600
that's running 24-7, I was just, I was thankful to go with something that I knew was tried

438
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:46,600
and true.

439
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:48,800
Yeah, very sensible decision by them there.

440
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:50,760
You know what else is a sensible decision?

441
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:54,960
