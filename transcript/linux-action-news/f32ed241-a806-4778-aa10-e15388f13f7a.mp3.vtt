Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, our weekly take on Linux and the open-source world.

00:16.360 --> 00:20.960
This is episode 104, recorded on May 5th, 2019.

00:20.960 --> 00:21.960
I'm Chris.

00:21.960 --> 00:22.960
And I'm Joe.

00:22.960 --> 00:23.960
Hello, Joe.

00:23.960 --> 00:26.280
Good to be connected with you on a very busy news week.

00:26.280 --> 00:30.080
Let's kick things off with the brand new Fedora 30 release.

00:30.080 --> 00:34.440
Yeah, no more cloud edition that's been merged with server, which seems quite logical to

00:34.440 --> 00:35.440
me.

00:35.440 --> 00:38.560
The workstation is GNOME 3.32.

00:38.560 --> 00:40.640
And you've been running this for a little while, haven't you?

00:40.640 --> 00:43.900
Yeah, I gave it a go on both the server side.

00:43.900 --> 00:48.760
We have a pretty important server here at the network that runs on Fedora.

00:48.760 --> 00:52.680
We decided let's put our money where our mouth is, essentially, and really see how long you

00:52.680 --> 00:55.520
can run Fedora in a real production environment.

00:55.520 --> 00:58.880
Granted, a lot of the applications and whatnot are in containers.

00:58.880 --> 01:02.800
But we did an upgrade from 29 to 30, and it worked flawlessly.

01:02.800 --> 01:07.880
And I've been running the XFCE spin of Fedora on my laptop.

01:07.880 --> 01:10.080
And no surprise, I love it.

01:10.080 --> 01:12.600
It's really been extremely fast.

01:12.600 --> 01:15.860
That's not to shortchange the GNOME 3.32 release.

01:15.860 --> 01:17.560
It is a fantastic release.

01:17.560 --> 01:21.160
If you're a GNOME Shell fan, it's worth the upgrade all on its own.

01:21.160 --> 01:26.640
Performance-wise, it has a lot of improvements, I think the actual performance crown still

01:26.640 --> 01:30.840
not quite going to Fedora these days, but it's still a great release of GNOME Shell.

01:30.840 --> 01:36.840
Plus, you got the new Bash in there, you got GCC 9, and from a community standpoint, there's

01:36.840 --> 01:39.320
another big change with Fedora 30.

01:39.320 --> 01:45.460
They're moving their Ask Fedora support form to the discourse platform with this release

01:45.460 --> 01:46.460
of Fedora.

01:46.460 --> 01:47.460
So that's a big shift too.

01:47.460 --> 01:49.640
So you've got that merger of those server additions.

01:49.640 --> 01:54.540
You got changes on the community side, and you've got a super up-to-date, high-performance

01:54.540 --> 01:56.400
workstation edition.

01:56.400 --> 02:02.000
Top to bottom in every level of the project, they're really executing on this release.

02:02.000 --> 02:04.000
I've been really happy with Fedora 30.

02:04.000 --> 02:08.320
Well, he gave it a very thorough going over in tomorrow's LUP, which has to record early

02:08.320 --> 02:11.360
because you're off to the Red Hat Summit.

02:11.360 --> 02:15.720
It's messing with my mind, all this past and future, but it's well worth checking that

02:15.720 --> 02:16.720
out.

02:16.720 --> 02:20.840
So just briefly, the workstation edition, and I can see those performance improvements.

02:20.840 --> 02:25.160
I decided to put it on my lowest performing system, which is an old Chromebook with two

02:25.160 --> 02:28.720
gigabytes of RAM, and it seemed to work absolutely fine on there.

02:28.720 --> 02:33.200
I won't go into too many details because I really just go on about it in LUP 300.

02:33.200 --> 02:39.880
But I'll say this, if you haven't tried Fedora for a while, 30 is a really well-executed

02:39.880 --> 02:40.880
release.

02:40.880 --> 02:47.120
There's gonna be a time in Fedora's history just very recently where it was maybe advisable

02:47.120 --> 02:51.720
to wait about a month after a Fedora release to kick the tires, wait for software to catch

02:51.720 --> 02:52.720
up and whatnot.

02:52.720 --> 03:00.160
I would say they have figured that problem out between flat packs and copper and really

03:00.160 --> 03:04.720
just the things they're bundling with the distribution like drivers and other things

03:04.720 --> 03:06.080
that used to be harder to get.

03:06.080 --> 03:09.120
It is perfectly usable on launch day.

03:09.120 --> 03:13.720
And I used to never say that about a Fedora release, so that's an accomplishment on its

03:13.720 --> 03:14.720
own.

03:14.720 --> 03:19.660
We really are spoiled for choice now, aren't we, with Ubuntu 19.04 and Fedora 30.

03:19.660 --> 03:24.160
No matter which way you wanna go, you're gonna get a rock-solid distro with the latest version

03:24.160 --> 03:26.600
of GNOME that's just gonna work for you.

03:26.600 --> 03:27.600
Yeah, absolutely.

03:27.600 --> 03:29.240
You wanna talk about being spoiled for choice.

03:29.240 --> 03:32.500
You thought we had a lot of choice when it comes to distros.

03:32.500 --> 03:34.040
How about services?

03:34.040 --> 03:38.440
There are more services than I think Bill Gates could afford to pay for these days.

03:38.440 --> 03:44.480
Well, I'm sure he was first in the queue for Librem One, which is Purism's new set of services,

03:44.480 --> 03:51.040
which are definitely not just a bunch of rebadged software sold back to people or anything.

03:51.040 --> 03:53.520
Actually that is exactly what they are.

03:53.520 --> 03:55.520
Librem Chat is Riot.

03:55.520 --> 03:57.760
Librem Chat on iOS is also Riot.

03:57.760 --> 03:59.980
Librem Social is Tusky.

03:59.980 --> 04:03.380
Librem Social is Amarok on iOS.

04:03.380 --> 04:06.180
Librem Mail is rebadged K9.

04:06.180 --> 04:09.640
Librem Tunnel is a rebadged VPN iOS open source app.

04:09.640 --> 04:12.520
And for Android, it's a rebadge of ICS open VPN.

04:12.520 --> 04:17.560
But there's nothing inherently wrong with that as a concept, because they're charging

04:17.560 --> 04:19.520
people to use a service.

04:19.520 --> 04:23.240
You have to run a server and manage all of that stuff.

04:23.240 --> 04:26.920
And the whole point of free and open source software is you can do what you want with

04:26.920 --> 04:28.560
it, like start services.

04:28.560 --> 04:30.080
Yeah, I agree.

04:30.080 --> 04:36.160
But taking the logos and just rebranding them, I don't know, it kind of looks a bit cheap

04:36.160 --> 04:37.160
to me.

04:37.160 --> 04:42.560
Well, I think maybe not being implicitly upfront about that and maybe not coming right out

04:42.560 --> 04:48.560
and saying and leading with a story about contribution and how you'll be working upstream

04:48.560 --> 04:54.900
and launching the service with that language instead of sort of scrambling after the fact

04:54.900 --> 04:58.920
when everybody notices that these are really well known apps that have just been white

04:58.920 --> 04:59.920
labeled.

04:59.920 --> 05:03.920
But something that is far more concerning than that is the fact that they're doing this

05:03.920 --> 05:10.800
as a crowd funder for a service that is ongoing and going to give them ongoing revenue.

05:10.800 --> 05:12.800
Why do they need to do a crowd funder here?

05:12.800 --> 05:21.600
Well, because by contributing to purism, you are making the world a better place, according

05:21.600 --> 05:22.600
to Todd.

05:22.600 --> 05:23.600
All right.

05:23.600 --> 05:24.600
Okay.

05:24.600 --> 05:26.760
And that is that's if you read through their website, I've read through everything.

05:26.760 --> 05:28.560
That is essentially it.

05:28.560 --> 05:32.480
And that's also they're helping the world by putting these under a centralized brand.

05:32.480 --> 05:37.360
You see, purism is making things better by putting all of these services under a brand

05:37.360 --> 05:39.120
that we can all trust.

05:39.120 --> 05:43.720
They write on their blog even, we make these decentralized services just as convenient

05:43.720 --> 05:46.440
to use as big tech alternatives.

05:46.440 --> 05:51.160
That way the end user doesn't have to know what matrix is, activity pub or even what

05:51.160 --> 05:52.400
IMAP is.

05:52.400 --> 05:54.180
They can just use their applications.

05:54.180 --> 05:56.240
And that's a pretty solid argument.

05:56.240 --> 05:58.720
And I can completely understand why they'd want to do that.

05:58.720 --> 06:05.120
And I really like the idea of having the option to subscribe to services that are competitive

06:05.120 --> 06:10.100
with a lot of commercial offerings from a company that I trust, and that I believe really

06:10.100 --> 06:12.440
does respect my privacy.

06:12.440 --> 06:16.600
And I will give purism one thing, I believe they do respect my privacy.

06:16.600 --> 06:17.600
Really?

06:17.600 --> 06:20.280
Because I couldn't see a privacy policy on any of this.

06:20.280 --> 06:22.200
You read through it all, did you?

06:22.200 --> 06:23.200
That's true.

06:23.200 --> 06:24.200
I couldn't find one.

06:24.200 --> 06:25.760
I did want to link to it in the show notes.

06:25.760 --> 06:26.760
And I couldn't dig one up.

06:26.760 --> 06:33.540
I also, I thought from your perspective too, I couldn't find anything about GDPR regulations

06:33.540 --> 06:36.880
or rules that they're following or any kind of GDPR disclosures.

06:36.880 --> 06:39.680
I would think because it's a worldwide service, that's required too.

06:39.680 --> 06:44.160
Well, yeah, if you're offering it to anyone in the EU, then you have to do that.

06:44.160 --> 06:45.520
So that seems like a bit of an oversight.

06:45.520 --> 06:51.040
I mean, you would hope that that will be coming soon, but it just feels a bit hastily put

06:51.040 --> 06:57.440
together, this, and when you combine that with the recent layoffs that they've done,

06:57.440 --> 07:00.400
it doesn't inspire a huge amount of confidence, I must say.

07:00.400 --> 07:03.560
It's hard to tell with these kinds of things, but I also have the impression of sort of

07:03.560 --> 07:10.560
a hasty throw together, which combined with yet another crowd fundraiser, having participated

07:10.560 --> 07:15.400
in previous ones, just feels like another grab.

07:15.400 --> 07:19.800
And you do wonder if maybe there's some sustainability issues.

07:19.800 --> 07:22.240
I can see the bigger picture they're going for here.

07:22.240 --> 07:26.360
They're going for a complete services integration with their laptops, the phones, they're trying

07:26.360 --> 07:29.360
to give people on other OSs alternatives.

07:29.360 --> 07:30.900
I like that.

07:30.900 --> 07:38.080
But the lack of a clear, well accessible privacy policy, the lack of a clear, detailed layout

07:38.080 --> 07:42.220
of where the server's at and where I can trust that they're secure and private, telling me

07:42.220 --> 07:44.000
you respect my privacy is good.

07:44.000 --> 07:47.440
That's a good very, very first step, especially if that's your true intention.

07:47.440 --> 07:51.720
However, it has to be followed up, especially when you're pitching to this kind of market,

07:51.720 --> 07:55.000
it has to be followed up with details and information.

07:55.000 --> 07:58.680
Amazon has to do it, Google has to do it, there has to be some information about your

07:58.680 --> 08:02.960
data center management policy, its security, where the data is stored, all of that.

08:02.960 --> 08:08.120
People have to make informed decisions, especially consumers that are buying this kind of product.

08:08.120 --> 08:10.720
And the GDPR is an issue here.

08:10.720 --> 08:12.600
None of these items were addressed.

08:12.600 --> 08:13.600
Why?

08:13.600 --> 08:14.600
I'll tell you why.

08:14.600 --> 08:16.780
Because they've never done services before.

08:16.780 --> 08:19.640
Because it's harder to do services than people realize.

08:19.640 --> 08:24.840
It takes more work and more effort than people who've never done it before can appreciate.

08:24.840 --> 08:27.960
As right on point, you can see they kind of were a little sloppy.

08:27.960 --> 08:28.960
They didn't wait.

08:28.960 --> 08:29.960
They rushed.

08:29.960 --> 08:34.160
One of the applications they shipped out on day one was affected by a rather nasty security

08:34.160 --> 08:35.240
bug.

08:35.240 --> 08:39.240
And it was simply an issue because they were rebranding an upstream application that had

08:39.240 --> 08:40.700
a bug.

08:40.700 --> 08:42.440
And that shipped to end users.

08:42.440 --> 08:44.920
Now, perhaps they can learn.

08:44.920 --> 08:47.960
Perhaps they can become a services company.

08:47.960 --> 08:52.480
But then I have to wonder what a small company with limited resources does if that becomes

08:52.480 --> 08:56.820
their primary revenue source and they're still working on shipping the Librem 5.

08:56.820 --> 08:58.760
They're stretching themselves quite thin.

08:58.760 --> 09:00.540
And so that brings me to my last concern.

09:00.540 --> 09:06.560
Even if they could learn and become a services company that had a great staff and a large

09:06.560 --> 09:12.720
support infrastructure that could provide support to people, does that rob from their

09:12.720 --> 09:15.320
initiative to build the Librem 5?

09:15.320 --> 09:18.580
Because they are limited in obviously funds because they've just gone through a round

09:18.580 --> 09:19.600
of layoffs.

09:19.600 --> 09:22.780
They had to do a yet another fundraiser.

09:22.780 --> 09:26.920
They have limited staff that's going to have to learn up really quick to do this completely

09:26.920 --> 09:27.920
well.

09:27.920 --> 09:31.080
Oh, and by the way, they're still trying to topple Android at the same time.

09:31.080 --> 09:33.520
What do you think about the pricing for this then?

09:33.520 --> 09:36.520
Well, it's, you know, I think reasonable.

09:36.520 --> 09:37.520
Really.

09:37.520 --> 09:42.440
I mean, when you consider that the alternative is a company that's also tracking you constantly

09:42.440 --> 09:47.040
or one that charges you thousands of dollars for hardware, the Librem 1 for an individual

09:47.040 --> 09:50.200
is $7.99 US greenbacks per month.

09:50.200 --> 09:56.720
They also offer a family pack for $14.99 US greenbacks.

09:56.720 --> 10:01.240
Is that a lot for what equates to be rebranding of open source software?

10:01.240 --> 10:02.660
I say no.

10:02.660 --> 10:04.580
In my opinion, it's fair pricing.

10:04.580 --> 10:09.760
They're taking valuable software, they're providing infrastructure and support for it,

10:09.760 --> 10:13.120
and they're packaging it and delivering it in a consumable way to end users.

10:13.120 --> 10:15.920
I think $8 a month is actually a pretty good deal.

10:15.920 --> 10:18.320
I think they've nailed the pricing.

10:18.320 --> 10:24.240
The issue is I just don't have a lot of faith that they're the company to offer these kind

10:24.240 --> 10:25.880
of services.

10:25.880 --> 10:29.940
It's just a whole nother game than building laptops or phones.

10:29.940 --> 10:34.920
You could roll all of this yourself because it's all open source software for $5 a month

10:34.920 --> 10:42.000
on a digital ocean droplet, which does make $8 a month seem a bit expensive, but it's

10:42.000 --> 10:43.760
an awful lot of effort to do that.

10:43.760 --> 10:48.420
If they could pull this off properly, then that extra few dollars is nothing really.

10:48.420 --> 10:52.080
It just comes down to whether or not they can deliver what they're promising, which

10:52.080 --> 10:53.760
is a hugely tall order.

10:53.760 --> 10:58.600
Well, and picture it also as a potential value add to Librem 5 down the road.

10:58.600 --> 11:03.000
They'd have to create applications for their own OS because ironically, they don't have

11:03.000 --> 11:05.320
any rebranded pure OS apps.

11:05.320 --> 11:10.240
You could just go use Riot and whatnot, so they'd have to make some apps for their own

11:10.240 --> 11:14.600
operating system, but if they did, you could kind of see an overall services tie-in.

11:14.600 --> 11:19.680
But also, I would normally kind of give you a hard time right here and I'd say, oh, Joe,

11:19.680 --> 11:24.060
you always claim it's so easy for somebody to just go stand up a website on digital ocean.

11:24.060 --> 11:25.400
People need their handheld.

11:25.400 --> 11:29.000
They want to click a button and have the service, and I think that's generally true.

11:29.000 --> 11:34.080
That's why things like WhatsApp and Telegram and Slack are so damn popular because they're

11:34.080 --> 11:35.640
a few clicks away and you've got it.

11:35.640 --> 11:38.120
No server setup needed.

11:38.120 --> 11:42.620
This market, however, the purism is going after.

11:42.620 --> 11:48.000
The crowd that wants to support a social purposes company that's furthering free software.

11:48.000 --> 11:50.880
The crowd that wants kill switches on their hardware devices.

11:50.880 --> 11:56.600
The crowd that wants privacy respecting services that they're willing to pay for.

11:56.600 --> 12:01.240
Yeah, that's the crowd that generally knows how to spin up a VPS.

12:01.240 --> 12:04.720
That's the kind of crowd that can load something on a Raspberry Pi.

12:04.720 --> 12:09.400
So they are competing in a very unique niche.

12:09.400 --> 12:10.880
So maybe you're right.

12:10.880 --> 12:11.880
Maybe it is too expensive.

12:11.880 --> 12:15.640
For me personally, having a appreciation of what it would take to run infrastructure

12:15.640 --> 12:20.560
like that at scale, it's probably not enough money, but it seems to be their thing.

12:20.560 --> 12:24.800
Well, it remains to be seen if they're going to pull this off and when and if they're going

12:24.800 --> 12:26.880
to deliver this phone.

12:26.880 --> 12:31.040
So I suppose we have to give them the benefit of the doubt for now, but I'm going to watch

12:31.040 --> 12:33.280
with a skeptical eye on that one.

12:33.280 --> 12:39.520
When I backed the Librem 15 and they delivered it extremely late without the GPU that I was

12:39.520 --> 12:44.060
promised, I thought to myself, all right, they've got some struggles.

12:44.060 --> 12:45.680
Let's see how they do.

12:45.680 --> 12:49.380
When they launched a phone, I thought, oh boy, that's crazy.

12:49.380 --> 12:50.840
Let's see how they do.

12:50.840 --> 12:55.080
When they announced that that phone was going to have its own custom boutique operating system

12:55.080 --> 12:59.560
and that they were going to modify every GTK application to be scalable or create their

12:59.560 --> 13:03.780
own application, I thought, oh no, that's not a good sign.

13:03.780 --> 13:08.480
When the dev kit shipped and the screens couldn't even work without some crazy black box flashing,

13:08.480 --> 13:12.020
I thought, oh boy, that's probably a red flag.

13:12.020 --> 13:14.980
And then when the tablet that they announced just kind of quietly disappeared and nobody

13:14.980 --> 13:20.200
said anything, I thought, I don't think people are thinking critically about this company.

13:20.200 --> 13:25.140
And then when they announced services, I thought, oh man, they're really biting off a lot here.

13:25.140 --> 13:27.280
They're a small team that just went through layoffs.

13:27.280 --> 13:29.140
I mean, they're so desperate.

13:29.140 --> 13:33.200
Todd was forced to lay people off even that were at community events.

13:33.200 --> 13:36.200
People got laid off over a weekend from a hotel room.

13:36.200 --> 13:41.280
I mean, that tells you just how desperate the situation must be at Pureism.

13:41.280 --> 13:44.340
And so I was concerned, but I'll tell you where they really lost me.

13:44.340 --> 13:49.480
And it's funny because, you know, maybe 10 years ago, maybe even five years ago, I would

13:49.480 --> 13:51.280
have laughed at this.

13:51.280 --> 13:57.160
But now in 2019, their marketing message is way off.

13:57.160 --> 13:58.160
Way off.

13:58.160 --> 14:02.600
I don't know if you had a chance to see their launch video, but the entire thing's a dick

14:02.600 --> 14:06.700
joke about touching junk, looking at junk, sizes of junk.

14:06.700 --> 14:08.440
The entire thing is a penis joke.

14:08.440 --> 14:10.180
Like, who's that appealing to?

14:10.180 --> 14:17.000
And here's the worst thing, when you combine that with their messaging, their best case

14:17.000 --> 14:21.880
for success now is to get labeled as an alt-right platform, which I grant you would be ridiculous,

14:21.880 --> 14:23.760
but that's exactly how these things go.

14:23.760 --> 14:27.360
Like, I can't believe that video in 2019.

14:27.360 --> 14:31.080
I grant you a younger version of me would have found it funny.

14:31.080 --> 14:34.680
But now that's not how you launch services like this.

14:34.680 --> 14:35.680
That's embarrassing.

14:35.680 --> 14:37.240
Yeah, that video was just terrible.

14:37.240 --> 14:41.300
And it's there embedded on the page where you go to sign up.

14:41.300 --> 14:47.240
It just seems like such a huge misstep to me to do, as you say, the dick jokes, and

14:47.240 --> 14:51.800
it just feels just totally off the mark to me.

14:51.800 --> 14:59.400
It's amateurish, especially when you're comparing yourselves to Google and Apple.

14:59.400 --> 15:01.880
It's just so out of touch with reality.

15:01.880 --> 15:05.900
Yeah, but even Apple do some out of touch reality stuff like that What's A Computer

15:05.900 --> 15:11.720
Video With A Kid With The iPad, but at least that's not offensive as well.

15:11.720 --> 15:14.760
Yeah, I'm sure a lot of dudes thought it was hilarious.

15:14.760 --> 15:20.240
So if they want a dude-only service, well, they're in a good position now.

15:20.240 --> 15:23.760
How many women do you think watched that video and thought, oh, man, this is a service for

15:23.760 --> 15:24.760
me?

15:24.760 --> 15:26.140
Yeah, probably not that many.

15:26.140 --> 15:30.400
I'm sure some found it funny, but for me, it just fell so flat.

15:30.400 --> 15:33.000
I was just watching it thinking, what are they doing?

15:33.000 --> 15:34.000
Okay, so they're doing that.

15:34.000 --> 15:36.440
Okay, they're doubling down, tripling down.

15:36.440 --> 15:38.840
Okay, so this whole video is going that way.

15:38.840 --> 15:44.840
Well, it was really unfortunate because I just really misjudged Purism as a company.

15:44.840 --> 15:47.360
Because they talk about having a family plan.

15:47.360 --> 15:51.360
And so Dylan's in the room with me, and the joke's not lost on him.

15:51.360 --> 15:55.080
So my son just watched a dick joke video that I had no intention of showing him, because

15:55.080 --> 15:57.360
I just didn't expect that from Purism.

15:57.360 --> 16:01.240
Well, it's not the only blunder that's happened this week.

16:01.240 --> 16:05.680
I've had even normal people message me asking, what's going on with Firefox?

16:05.680 --> 16:07.780
Why isn't adblock working anymore?

16:07.780 --> 16:12.800
And then I've had to try and find them a link to explain it, and just couldn't really.

16:12.800 --> 16:18.400
No, and then when you combine explaining that you need to participate in studies, and the

16:18.400 --> 16:21.080
entire thing was a mess.

16:21.080 --> 16:25.280
And the way I got contacted was, hey, I've been having this problem with my Facebook

16:25.280 --> 16:26.280
container.

16:26.280 --> 16:27.280
I'm going to delete it and reinstall it.

16:27.280 --> 16:28.280
Now I've lost my...

16:28.280 --> 16:29.280
And it was just...

16:29.280 --> 16:30.480
It was a total mess.

16:30.480 --> 16:34.600
And I did not realize what was going on at the time, so it took me a few minutes to figure

16:34.600 --> 16:39.380
out what was actually happening, because at the time, there was very little communication

16:39.380 --> 16:40.380
from Mozilla.

16:40.380 --> 16:44.100
I actually had to go to the bug tracker and read the bug reports to figure out what the

16:44.100 --> 16:45.600
hell was going on.

16:45.600 --> 16:49.000
And it apparently all came down to an expired certificate.

16:49.000 --> 16:50.000
Yeah.

16:50.000 --> 16:51.000
Now that is bad.

16:51.000 --> 16:54.840
That is really bad for them to allow that to happen.

16:54.840 --> 16:59.680
But mistakes happen, people are human, they didn't have the right cron job or whatever.

16:59.680 --> 17:01.240
No, I can't agree with that.

17:01.240 --> 17:02.680
You don't design it that way.

17:02.680 --> 17:03.680
Yes, you're right.

17:03.680 --> 17:06.400
Mistakes happen and SSL certs expire.

17:06.400 --> 17:07.400
That's not news.

17:07.400 --> 17:09.620
And by the way, that's always how it's been.

17:09.620 --> 17:12.000
So you plan and design for it.

17:12.000 --> 17:17.600
You designed a system that could be taken out by something that you knew was going to

17:17.600 --> 17:18.600
happen.

17:18.600 --> 17:19.600
Think about that for a moment.

17:19.600 --> 17:20.600
Yeah.

17:20.600 --> 17:25.120
It's just that for me, the messaging, the lack of communication here just overshadowed

17:25.120 --> 17:31.000
the technical blunder, which I suppose thinking about it, it was terrible in the first place.

17:31.000 --> 17:32.920
But just the way they handled this.

17:32.920 --> 17:38.040
Okay, now they've pushed out an update, but it took them too long to do that.

17:38.040 --> 17:41.820
And there was not enough clear communication about it.

17:41.820 --> 17:46.280
But you're right, actually, just the design of this thing to even allow it to happen in

17:46.280 --> 17:47.280
the first place.

17:47.280 --> 17:48.560
I can't believe it.

17:48.560 --> 17:55.160
For the past month, every episode, Mozilla have been doing great stuff, and we've been

17:55.160 --> 17:57.120
reporting on that and singing their praises.

17:57.120 --> 18:02.280
They've been doing a bunch of good stuff, and they have to go and let us down with this.

18:02.280 --> 18:07.980
When the market share is already so low, how many people must have been pushed over to

18:07.980 --> 18:09.800
Chrome because of this?

18:09.800 --> 18:13.840
All my extensions have just randomly stopped working, and I've got some weird message.

18:13.840 --> 18:17.640
Right, I'm just going to open Chrome and just forget about Firefox then.

18:17.640 --> 18:22.040
Well, the other thing that was a secondary effect of this is people became much more

18:22.040 --> 18:27.520
aware of how powerful the studies feature is, which is functionality they use to test

18:27.520 --> 18:28.520
stuff.

18:28.520 --> 18:32.120
Well, it turns out they can push production code down to your browser like hotfixes for

18:32.120 --> 18:33.120
this.

18:33.120 --> 18:35.720
And I don't know if people had really made that connection because that's what I saw

18:35.720 --> 18:40.480
a lot of people reacting to is, wait a minute, you can push code right down to my browser

18:40.480 --> 18:43.360
in real time anytime you want?

18:43.360 --> 18:48.160
And you know, the tinfoil hats came out, I guess they need to listen to the Linux action

18:48.160 --> 18:51.760
new show more because we had told people about that.

18:51.760 --> 18:59.040
So you're fixed if you're on version 66.0.4 on desktop or Android, and they have released

18:59.040 --> 19:00.560
an ESR fix as well.

19:00.560 --> 19:03.000
That is version 60.62.

19:03.000 --> 19:06.280
If you're on one of those two versions, everything's back to normal.

19:06.280 --> 19:10.720
If you got the hotfix via the study feature, you're probably okay.

19:10.720 --> 19:14.880
That just took about six hours to kick in, which also screwed with people.

19:14.880 --> 19:18.560
Yeah, you could go into about config and change that time.

19:18.560 --> 19:21.000
But otherwise, you just have to leave it.

19:21.000 --> 19:25.320
And you've just reminded me I've just gone in and turned that feature off again.

19:25.320 --> 19:30.800
So yeah, and that feature where you go in and adjust the time that essentially creates

19:30.800 --> 19:33.440
a more frequent check in with Mozilla.

19:33.440 --> 19:37.560
So it would download the fixes faster, because there was a six hour check in window.

19:37.560 --> 19:41.840
Now, the funny thing is, because that spread around the internet a whole bunch, a lot of

19:41.840 --> 19:45.760
people adjusted that timeout window and it put a big load on Mozilla server as everybody's

19:45.760 --> 19:47.600
now checking in much more frequently.

19:47.600 --> 19:52.140
So if you did make that adjustment, this is your Linux action news public service reminder

19:52.140 --> 19:53.760
to go set it back to the default.

19:53.760 --> 19:54.760
Let's be nice to Mozilla.

19:54.760 --> 20:00.320
Yeah, and also disable studies again, like I just have or not, it's up to you.

20:00.320 --> 20:04.040
Now if you're listening to this this week, and you have no idea what happened, then good

20:04.040 --> 20:05.040
news.

20:05.040 --> 20:10.400
It was right Friday, May 3, as we record this, when Mozilla became aware of the issue.

20:10.400 --> 20:12.240
And now by Monday, it's all taken care of.

20:12.240 --> 20:16.640
Yeah, I've not seen the update on my Ubuntu based system yet, but I'm sure that will be

20:16.640 --> 20:19.320
forthcoming early in the week.

20:19.320 --> 20:23.120
But this is just such an embarrassing blunder for Mozilla.

20:23.120 --> 20:28.780
It's not like there's some two bit small project with a couple of people, whatever.

20:28.780 --> 20:33.500
This is a major organization with hundreds and hundreds of people working for them.

20:33.500 --> 20:34.880
How could this happen?

20:34.880 --> 20:40.160
I would only be conjecturing, but my first thought was just technical debt.

20:40.160 --> 20:41.720
It's an old project.

20:41.720 --> 20:43.460
People have come and gone.

20:43.460 --> 20:47.200
This is really a production example of the cost of technical debt.

20:47.200 --> 20:52.220
Well, I hope that there's some very serious meetings that take place and some procedures

20:52.220 --> 20:57.040
put in place to stop this happening again, because they just cannot take another one

20:57.040 --> 20:58.040
of these.

20:58.040 --> 21:03.360
I think after that, Mr. Robot, Snafu, and some of the other stuff we've talked about,

21:03.360 --> 21:05.400
they just cannot afford to do stuff like this.

21:05.400 --> 21:07.280
Well, you had mentioned Ubuntu there.

21:07.280 --> 21:10.280
Maybe you could take advantage of their new support program.

21:10.280 --> 21:14.840
This week, Canonical announced Ubuntu Advantage for Infrastructure, which is a consolidated

21:14.840 --> 21:21.480
enterprise security compliance and support offering that covers a whole range of infrastructure

21:21.480 --> 21:25.560
services that are popular on Ubuntu right now for 10 years.

21:25.560 --> 21:29.120
So Joe, this must be like the official version of what we saw Mark Shuttleworth talking about

21:29.120 --> 21:30.120
recently.

21:30.120 --> 21:33.840
That really sets up Canonical as a serious enterprise player, doesn't it?

21:33.840 --> 21:41.880
Being able to support the Linux side, Kubernetes, Docker, OpenStack, KVM, all sorts of other

21:41.880 --> 21:47.400
stuff just in one single package that you can just pay for as just one bill that's going

21:47.400 --> 21:48.840
out every month.

21:48.840 --> 21:55.180
It seems like a very good strategy and just more evidence of this streamlining and Shuttleworth

21:55.180 --> 22:00.600
getting really serious about, well, he says IPRing could be selling, but either way, getting

22:00.600 --> 22:01.760
the business in shape.

22:01.760 --> 22:07.440
Yeah, this really sort of turns the knob on Canonical being a consultation services company.

22:07.440 --> 22:14.800
And the pricing's actually pretty good, especially compared to like RHEL subscriptions.

22:14.800 --> 22:18.400
They have three packages, Essential, Standard, and Advanced.

22:18.400 --> 22:19.820
Here's the desktop price, just as an example.

22:19.820 --> 22:25.960
You can get full freaking support, like full stack support, Ubuntu certified peripherals,

22:25.960 --> 22:30.720
the installation, configuration of software, and support for software that are official

22:30.720 --> 22:31.720
Canonical snaps.

22:31.720 --> 22:36.840
You get support for, you get support for software in the repositories.

22:36.840 --> 22:39.420
Essential is $25 a desktop.

22:39.420 --> 22:43.720
Standard is $150 and Advanced is $300 for a desktop.

22:43.720 --> 22:50.580
With Advanced, you get one hour response time from support, 24-7.

22:50.580 --> 22:55.660
And they even have like a special, like crazy fast support for like weekends and holidays

22:55.660 --> 22:57.000
and all that kind of stuff.

22:57.000 --> 23:02.860
You get support for Kubernetes, KVM, OpenStack, like Joe said, as well as the live patch service.

23:02.860 --> 23:04.400
It's really comprehensive.

23:04.400 --> 23:07.520
I'll link to it in the show notes if you want to read through it for more.

23:07.520 --> 23:12.020
There's some really interesting things in here, including there is some packages that

23:12.020 --> 23:16.200
include completely setting up a Kubernetes stack and then supporting it from installation

23:16.200 --> 23:19.100
to managing the clusters and everything.

23:19.100 --> 23:23.680
This is such a genius play because you get started with Ubuntu for free on a VPS one

23:23.680 --> 23:27.300
day and then as your company grows, you deploy it in your own data center.

23:27.300 --> 23:32.040
And then when you get serious, you can call up Canonical and you can get 10 years of support.

23:32.040 --> 23:36.200
And you're getting support from Canonical employees that can work with other people

23:36.200 --> 23:40.380
in the office to write drivers, write patches, get direct information.

23:40.380 --> 23:41.960
This is just a brilliant move.

23:41.960 --> 23:46.080
And because they're supporting desktop and server, that means it works for people that

23:46.080 --> 23:48.040
want to deploy it as a workstation too.

23:48.040 --> 23:50.600
You now have a support package backed by Canonical.

23:50.600 --> 23:54.920
Honestly, if I was still a consultant these days, I'd be installing Ubuntu like crazy

23:54.920 --> 23:57.000
and then selling it with this for each desktop.

23:57.000 --> 24:02.280
It was interesting to see how surprised Shotworth was that the desktop's actually doing really

24:02.280 --> 24:03.280
well in enterprise.

24:03.280 --> 24:07.080
And, you know, he didn't say it's making a ton of money compared with all the other stuff

24:07.080 --> 24:10.120
they do, but it does seem to be profitable for them.

24:10.120 --> 24:13.880
And actually bringing in enough revenue to be noteworthy.

24:13.880 --> 24:15.140
I don't buy it for a second.

24:15.140 --> 24:16.400
Not that it's not profitable.

24:16.400 --> 24:18.480
I don't buy for a second that he was surprised.

24:18.480 --> 24:23.800
I think what it is, is Canonical has failed to successfully tell that story for years

24:23.800 --> 24:24.800
now.

24:24.800 --> 24:28.220
And internal frustration with that has led to a new strategy.

24:28.220 --> 24:33.840
When Mark is talking to a reporter and he says, I'm surprised by the success our enterprise

24:33.840 --> 24:36.140
desktop product is having.

24:36.140 --> 24:37.140
That's a real headline.

24:37.140 --> 24:42.400
Canonical is having so much success that Mark Shotworth himself was surprised by it.

24:42.400 --> 24:45.680
But if Mark goes to the reporter and says, our desktop business is doing great.

24:45.680 --> 24:47.840
We're making a lot of revenue from it.

24:47.840 --> 24:48.840
It's a whole home story.

24:48.840 --> 24:49.840
Nobody runs it.

24:49.840 --> 24:53.880
That's quite cynical, but I suppose it makes sense that he's just being a good marketing

24:53.880 --> 24:54.880
man.

24:54.880 --> 24:55.880
Yeah, I suppose I'll buy that.

24:55.880 --> 24:56.880
Yeah, that's what he's doing.

24:56.880 --> 25:01.280
He goes out to these OpenStack summits, he talks about how all in Canonical is with OpenStack.

25:01.280 --> 25:06.620
What they're doing is really positioning themselves as a multi-cloud, multi-hardware vendor.

25:06.620 --> 25:07.620
That's really kind of brilliant.

25:07.620 --> 25:08.620
It's a good strategy.

25:08.620 --> 25:11.760
They're making custom images for the big cloud providers.

25:11.760 --> 25:13.940
They're working with OEMs like Dell.

25:13.940 --> 25:18.140
They're working now to sell support directly to enterprises and customers.

25:18.140 --> 25:22.380
And they're sitting back and going, we're the truly independent multi-cloud vendor.

25:22.380 --> 25:23.840
You want to do everything with Kubernetes?

25:23.840 --> 25:24.840
Have at it.

25:24.840 --> 25:25.840
You want to do everything with OpenStack?

25:25.840 --> 25:27.640
We love OpenStack.

25:27.640 --> 25:32.400
Red Hat must be looking over at this and taking some serious notes, I would have thought.

25:32.400 --> 25:33.400
Perhaps.

25:33.400 --> 25:34.400
I wonder.

25:34.400 --> 25:35.400
I'd love to know.

25:35.400 --> 25:37.320
I'd love to know how much they watch each other.

25:37.320 --> 25:40.500
I suspect it's more than they let on.

25:40.500 --> 25:43.120
But you know, Red Hat Summit is next week.

25:43.120 --> 25:47.140
And little birdies have told me that they have some huge things in the works.

25:47.140 --> 25:49.400
They're both doing their own things right now.

25:49.400 --> 25:51.540
And they're both rocking it in their own categories.

25:51.540 --> 25:55.820
The thing is about this market is there's more than enough room for Canonical and Red

25:55.820 --> 25:58.280
Hat to both be very, very successful.

25:58.280 --> 26:00.100
To be ridiculously successful.

26:00.100 --> 26:02.940
And so they're both going at it with their own strategies.

26:02.940 --> 26:05.580
And I've been watching the Canonical one pretty closely.

26:05.580 --> 26:09.020
And I'm pretty excited to get an up close look at the Red Hat one.

26:09.020 --> 26:12.820
We've got some discussion set up with some people in Red Hat.

26:12.820 --> 26:14.400
We've been chatting with some folks.

26:14.400 --> 26:17.180
And the word is there's going to be big news next week.

26:17.180 --> 26:22.020
And both Red Hat and Canonical have had some success with Dell hardware.

26:22.020 --> 26:23.980
Now new hardware was just announced by Dell.

26:23.980 --> 26:28.140
It ships with Ubuntu, but it is RHEL certified.

26:28.140 --> 26:33.980
And that's an interesting sort of confluence of the two strategies.

26:33.980 --> 26:38.260
Where they're both trying to position themselves as a multi-cloud independent provider.

26:38.260 --> 26:40.420
Where you can run it on anything you want.

26:40.420 --> 26:42.860
But we also have our recommended strategy.

26:42.860 --> 26:46.100
Like Canonical has a very recommended approach if you go with their support system.

26:46.100 --> 26:47.100
Just like RHEL does.

26:47.100 --> 26:50.420
I don't know, they're similar in a lot of ways.

26:50.420 --> 26:53.860
But they're also uniquely attacking this problem very differently.

26:53.860 --> 26:58.220
And we're linked to a survey that Ubuntu and Dell are doing, which is a desktop developer

26:58.220 --> 26:59.220
survey.

26:59.220 --> 27:03.260
I did take part in it, but it kind of skipped most of the questions for me because I didn't

27:03.260 --> 27:04.860
say I was a developer.

27:04.860 --> 27:06.580
But I love doing these surveys.

27:06.580 --> 27:13.460
And I think that people love to criticize companies and organizations for data gathering.

27:13.460 --> 27:16.500
But then when they want people to volunteer their data, not that many people do.

27:16.500 --> 27:21.620
So I always encourage people, take part in the survey, give them the data that they want,

27:21.620 --> 27:24.420
help them out, and we will all benefit from it.

27:24.420 --> 27:28.820
With hopefully some great Dell machines that are focused for developers.

27:28.820 --> 27:31.260
Well it was DockerCon last week.

27:31.260 --> 27:33.580
And as you would expect, there was some big news.

27:33.580 --> 27:37.180
And we did send our own Al Marquez to get a beat.

27:37.180 --> 27:42.780
But probably the biggest thing out of DockerCon, besides some of the numbers they announced

27:42.780 --> 27:48.740
about adoption and usage, is their new Docker desktop package for enterprise users.

27:48.740 --> 27:53.020
Of course we talked about that compromise of Docker Hub last week, but now they want

27:53.020 --> 27:54.020
to be talking about this.

27:54.020 --> 27:58.300
I haven't actually had a chance to speak to Elle about her going to DockerCon, have you?

27:58.300 --> 28:00.900
Yeah, I had a chance to talk to her this morning before the show.

28:00.900 --> 28:01.900
She's been traveling.

28:01.900 --> 28:05.300
She spent the week at DockerCon and met lots of people.

28:05.300 --> 28:07.740
And it's in San Francisco, California.

28:07.740 --> 28:11.460
And the next one would traditionally be in Europe.

28:11.460 --> 28:15.700
However it appears, and there's lots of rumors as to why, they're not doing that anymore.

28:15.700 --> 28:17.620
DockerCon may no longer return to Europe.

28:17.620 --> 28:20.260
In fact, it looks like the next one will be in Austin.

28:20.260 --> 28:24.080
And she thinks that's sort of a reflection of a larger transition that events like this

28:24.080 --> 28:25.100
are going through.

28:25.100 --> 28:27.380
It's something that we witnessed at scale too.

28:27.380 --> 28:31.820
Didn't see it as much at Linux Fest, but you definitely are seeing it very much at DockerCon

28:31.820 --> 28:33.500
and at scale as well.

28:33.500 --> 28:39.260
The world is becoming all about Kubernetes, about managing on-premises and hybrid cloud

28:39.260 --> 28:44.300
systems, multi-vendor management with Kubernetes.

28:44.300 --> 28:48.720
And Docker is really just a bit of a Kubernetes implementation detail.

28:48.720 --> 28:52.980
And she noticed a lot of speculation on the floor about the future of events like this.

28:52.980 --> 28:56.220
She says there's things like the OpenStack Summit, which has now changed to the Open

28:56.220 --> 28:57.780
Infrastructure Summit.

28:57.780 --> 29:01.100
The overall landscape itself is changing.

29:01.100 --> 29:05.940
And the amount of Kubernetes talks just at DockerCon was really high, just like it was

29:05.940 --> 29:07.140
at scale.

29:07.140 --> 29:12.460
And it really kind of left her with the sense that the focus of the event was growing beyond

29:12.460 --> 29:13.580
Docker itself.

29:13.580 --> 29:15.440
And that's awkward for DockerCon.

29:15.440 --> 29:16.440
That's really awkward.

29:16.440 --> 29:22.240
In fact, the last day had a, quote unquote, open source summit, which was really just

29:22.240 --> 29:24.500
about a lot of stuff beyond the scope of Docker.

29:24.500 --> 29:26.380
I've seen this when I go to these events.

29:26.380 --> 29:28.180
And now Elle's seeing this at these different events.

29:28.180 --> 29:32.500
There's a real transition happening in the industry right now, a profound transition.

29:32.500 --> 29:36.340
Well, it's not the only transition happening in the IT industry.

29:36.340 --> 29:40.540
We've got three stories to end with, which on their own kind of wouldn't be worth talking

29:40.540 --> 29:41.540
about.

29:41.540 --> 29:48.260
But the fact that Amazon, Microsoft, and Facebook are all getting into blockchain at the same

29:48.260 --> 29:51.420
time, it kind of feels worth talking about to me.

29:51.420 --> 29:55.680
Yeah, this is actually, you're right, in aggregate, this is really kind of a big deal.

29:55.680 --> 29:58.980
And maybe Amazon has the most solid go at it, because they really kind of announced

29:58.980 --> 30:05.220
this at their reInvent event back in like December or November 2018, I think it was.

30:05.220 --> 30:09.300
The Amazon Managed Blockchain is what they call it, the AMB, Joe.

30:09.300 --> 30:12.740
It's been in preview for a month, and they've just flipped it to general availability.

30:12.740 --> 30:16.100
It'll be online in their Northern Virginia data center, and then they're going to roll

30:16.100 --> 30:18.180
it out to other regions.

30:18.180 --> 30:24.300
So the AMB system, the Amazon Managed Blockchain, supports two quote unquote blockchain frameworks.

30:24.300 --> 30:30.100
The first one is Ethereum, and the second one is the Hyperledger Fabric.

30:30.100 --> 30:36.280
Now the latter is the result of the Linux Foundation working with IBM on their big hyper

30:36.280 --> 30:38.140
chain system.

30:38.140 --> 30:40.760
It's the only one that's actually available in production right now.

30:40.760 --> 30:44.180
The Ethereum system isn't supported yet.

30:44.180 --> 30:49.820
And when Amazon was contacted for details, they didn't have a date.

30:49.820 --> 30:54.800
But they just said later this year, they did kind of define the differences in why customers

30:54.800 --> 30:59.980
might want Hyperledger Fabric over Ethereum, if you're interested.

30:59.980 --> 31:04.220
Hyperledger is well suited for applications that require stringent privacy and permission

31:04.220 --> 31:07.660
controls and a set number of members and contributors.

31:07.660 --> 31:11.660
Whereas Ethereum's uses are for more like situations where you need transparency amongst

31:11.660 --> 31:14.780
all the members, where that's like a key thing.

31:14.780 --> 31:17.140
And you want it to be highly distributed.

31:17.140 --> 31:21.500
Maybe an example might be like a like a loyalty chain blockchain network that allows retailers

31:21.500 --> 31:26.020
to share information amongst each other and independently verify activity across all the

31:26.020 --> 31:27.020
different members.

31:27.020 --> 31:28.980
That's where you would use Ethereum.

31:28.980 --> 31:30.660
Interesting, right?

31:30.660 --> 31:31.660
Interesting.

31:31.660 --> 31:33.180
And then Microsoft's got theirs.

31:33.180 --> 31:38.380
I think the most interesting thing about Microsoft's is that there's ties in with Azure Active

31:38.380 --> 31:39.380
Directory.

31:39.380 --> 31:42.860
Yeah, well, Microsoft can't be left out, can they?

31:42.860 --> 31:47.820
But it's interesting that they are going for Quorum, I think that's how you say it, which

31:47.820 --> 31:51.420
is the JP Morgan ledger, right?

31:51.420 --> 31:53.580
Which is based off of Ethereum.

31:53.580 --> 31:54.580
Yeah.

31:54.580 --> 31:55.940
And yet is used for private stuff.

31:55.940 --> 31:59.100
So that kind of contradicts Amazon's messaging there.

31:59.100 --> 32:00.100
Yeah, I wonder.

32:00.100 --> 32:01.500
I think maybe they might just be using.

32:01.500 --> 32:05.340
See, one of the really nice things about Ethereum is it has the smart contracts feature.

32:05.340 --> 32:08.140
So they might just be taking bits and pieces of Ethereum.

32:08.140 --> 32:09.300
Who really knows?

32:09.300 --> 32:11.360
I don't really like that aspect of this.

32:11.360 --> 32:13.580
This is where it starts to get confusing.

32:13.580 --> 32:17.340
And then you add that with Facebook's Zuckcoin, or whatever they're going to call it.

32:17.340 --> 32:20.820
Now, this isn't a blockchain so much as it is a currency that they want to launch.

32:20.820 --> 32:24.420
Yeah, this is much more speculative than the other two, but I just thought it'd be funny

32:24.420 --> 32:25.420
to include it.

32:25.420 --> 32:28.980
But yeah, they want to get into cryptocurrency stuff.

32:28.980 --> 32:34.380
And I don't know, you have to think that Facebook has got so many users that if anyone was going

32:34.380 --> 32:37.300
to put it off, they might be able to.

32:37.300 --> 32:41.140
I kind of could see this for any system that has those crappy points.

32:41.140 --> 32:45.340
You know, like, I don't know if Microsoft Live does this anymore, but back in the day

32:45.340 --> 32:48.900
when I had an old Xbox, you had to buy like these live points and then you'd buy the games

32:48.900 --> 32:49.900
with the live points.

32:49.900 --> 32:53.240
You'd always end up with like a remaining balance and you know, they would like skimming

32:53.240 --> 32:54.500
off of that.

32:54.500 --> 33:00.120
I could see systems like that becoming a cryptocurrency of sorts that users could then trade amongst

33:00.120 --> 33:05.260
each other, or maybe even convert to another platform's coin.

33:05.260 --> 33:08.580
You know, there's gonna be hundreds of these things, I would think in, you know, 10, 20

33:08.580 --> 33:09.580
years.

33:09.580 --> 33:13.300
Yeah, and it does seem logical to distribute that rather than just have it all centralized.

33:13.300 --> 33:18.180
So the hype is all about, you know, cryptocurrencies, but the reality just always comes back to

33:18.180 --> 33:22.560
the same thing, a distributed database that's cryptographically signed and verified.

33:22.560 --> 33:25.820
We just need to make a podcast coin, man, like a, like a land coin.

33:25.820 --> 33:26.820
JV coin, maybe, yeah.

33:26.820 --> 33:30.460
Yeah, yeah, or a Tux coin, you know, we just need to get in on the game before it's too

33:30.460 --> 33:31.460
late, that's all.

33:31.460 --> 33:32.460
Yeah.

33:32.460 --> 33:34.300
Can I pre-mine the first few thousand of them?

33:34.300 --> 33:37.620
Well, yeah, just to see the network so that way it's viable.

33:37.620 --> 33:41.980
I think it's important that, I think it's important that you and I get a few coins ahead

33:41.980 --> 33:44.900
of time, you know, for the good of the coin.

33:44.900 --> 33:45.900
Yeah.

33:45.900 --> 33:51.580
Oh, interestingly, at Linux Fest Northwest, I talked to the people at the Free Software

33:51.580 --> 33:57.940
Foundation booth, and I was able to confirm that when they received that huge donation

33:57.940 --> 34:03.920
from Handshake, it wasn't actually in cash, it was in cryptocurrency, but that they cashed

34:03.920 --> 34:08.240
it out immediately, or at least as quickly as they possibly could, and turned it into

34:08.240 --> 34:10.660
actual US greenbacks, as you would say.

34:10.660 --> 34:11.660
There you go.

34:11.660 --> 34:13.620
A little bit of Linux action news exclusive.

34:13.620 --> 34:14.620
Yep.
