00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,320
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, episode 121, recorded on September 1st, 2019.

2
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:10,320
I'm Joe.

3
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:11,320
And I'm Wes.

4
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:12,320
Hello, Wes.

5
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:14,440
Thank you for joining me while the boss is on the road.

6
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:17,680
We've got tons to talk about, so let's get straight into it.

7
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:23,000
The big news of the week is that exFAT might be going into the Linux kernel sometime soon.

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,800
As they say, it's important to us that the Linux community can make use of exFAT included

9
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:30,620
in the Linux kernel with confidence.

10
00:00:30,620 --> 00:00:35,020
To this end, we'll be making Microsoft's technical specification for exFAT publicly

11
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:39,280
available to facilitate development of conformant, interoperable implementations.

12
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:43,140
Yeah, they've opened up the technical specification for exFAT.

13
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:45,480
They haven't made it open source necessarily.

14
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:46,480
Right.

15
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:51,760
They're not providing any code at this time, just a spec of how the file system works.

16
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:54,680
And well, of course, there's already a little controversy.

17
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:57,200
Some developers say the spec is not even complete.

18
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:02,240
Yeah, but the missing parts from the spec aren't really relevant anymore, are they?

19
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:05,360
It's for Windows CE, something that's long dead.

20
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:06,840
Nothing I want to use.

21
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:07,960
Yeah, yeah.

22
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:12,640
But the key factor here is that Microsoft is adding the patents for exFAT to the Open

23
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:16,020
Invention Network's Linux system definition.

24
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:20,240
They joined the Open Invention Network last year, and there were a lot of questions at

25
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:21,240
the time.

26
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:23,360
Well, what about your fat patents?

27
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:26,720
Well, they've answered those questions now by adding them.

28
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:32,480
So now anyone who's a member, which is pretty much everyone in the industry, can use exFAT

29
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:34,520
without worry of any patent litigation.

30
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:35,520
Right.

31
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:37,440
There's even some code that's been floating around.

32
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:41,720
But before this clarity around the patent issues, well, kernel developers were obviously

33
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:43,200
a little wary about merging it.

34
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:47,000
Yeah, and Microsoft have made it clear that they are not going to add it to the kernel

35
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
themselves.

36
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,440
It is up to the community, as they say.

37
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:55,320
And it looks like that code is going to be added to the kernel, but in staging.

38
00:01:55,320 --> 00:02:00,360
There's been some questions about the quality of the code, so having it live in staging

39
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:05,240
for a while, get brought up to the kernel's high coding standards, and just, you know,

40
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:10,160
get some more testing before it ships to any of our machines seems like a good idea.

41
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:11,340
There's also still a debate.

42
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:15,760
Some developers have talked about trying to build the exFAT driver on top of the existing

43
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:19,520
FAT driver, although that's been tried before and proved difficult.

44
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:23,200
Yeah, it doesn't look like that's the route that it's going to go, but it does seem a

45
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:25,040
little up in the air at this stage.

46
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:29,480
It seems more likely that it is going to go into staging and just be sort of cleaned up

47
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:32,760
and eventually make its way into the main branch.

48
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:36,680
Really to me, this story is interesting, not so much because of technology, honestly, I

49
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:42,340
try to avoid exFAT, but just as a continuing spotlight on Microsoft's changing attitudes

50
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:43,600
towards open source.

51
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:45,840
Well, yeah, Microsoft loves Linux.

52
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:49,260
They said that again in the post about this.

53
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:53,980
And it really is getting more evidence of the change that has happened over there.

54
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:57,880
And it's clearly of no benefit to them to make these patterns available because they're

55
00:02:57,880 --> 00:03:00,020
going to make less money from that.

56
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:03,440
But I suppose the goodwill is probably worth it to them.

57
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:04,440
Right.

58
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:07,000
They want to be seen as part of the open source community.

59
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,320
And exFAT has been one of the longest holdouts of their patent arsenal.

60
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:18,120
The thing is exFAT is still fairly widely used in SD cards for cameras and stuff, right?

61
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,120
Right.

62
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:22,040
Crucially, it gets over the four gigabyte limit in FAT32.

63
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:26,320
And if you're recording, you know, 4k video files, you reach four gigs pretty quick.

64
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:30,800
I've seen people saying that it's kind of dead and not used anymore, but I don't know.

65
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:35,920
I think my camera, although it's fairly old, I think that formats it as exFAT.

66
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:40,440
So it's very annoying at the moment, you plug it into a new installation, and it doesn't

67
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:41,440
work.

68
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:46,640
Oh, yes, of course, I need to install Fuse and exFAT utils, which is just really annoying.

69
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:52,120
So ultimately, once this does go into the kernel, it'll make a few people's lives a

70
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:53,360
little bit better, I think.

71
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,560
I'd call that an open source win.

72
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:56,560
Yep.

73
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:01,320
Well, somewhat sad news this week, and that is that Chris Beard is stepping down as Mozilla's

74
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:02,320
CEO.

75
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:07,760
He'd been there since 2014 and has overseen a number of large organizational changes.

76
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:12,920
He's overseen Firefox kind of making a bit of a comeback, certainly in terms of technical

77
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:19,520
quality and coming up to maybe not quite feature parity with Chrome, but certainly getting

78
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:20,520
there.

79
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:24,840
Because for a while there, it was really lagging behind and it was starting to get really slow

80
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:28,560
compared to Chrome and just was not the choice of anyone.

81
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:33,920
Whereas now, I think people are certainly in the open source community going back to

82
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:34,920
it.

83
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:37,960
I've heard at least anecdotal evidence of a lot of people doing that.

84
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:40,440
I know, I certainly switched back during his tenure.

85
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:43,080
Yeah, and there's no doubt that it has improved.

86
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:48,320
It really did feel stagnant for a time, but now it's constantly changing.

87
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:53,100
Some of those changes, like the move to web extensions, has been a bit controversial,

88
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:56,840
but I think it shows a healthy and actively developed Firefox.

89
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:57,840
Yeah.

90
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:01,800
It does seem a little bit strange though that he's chosen to step down now, and he said

91
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,480
that he's not going to step down right away.

92
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:08,880
He's going to be at the end of the year, but that's still not a huge amount of time.

93
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:14,680
And there's not really a great explanation as to why he's decided to move on.

94
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:19,880
It is an odd time as Mozilla has launched a number of new campaigns to expand some of

95
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:23,240
their product base and explore other revenue sources.

96
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:26,760
Maybe that's just a bigger problem than he feels like handling.

97
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:29,560
Possibly because it does feel inevitable.

98
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:33,780
How long have we been talking about this though, that Google are going to pull the advertising

99
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:39,760
deal and then they're going to be very much struggling to make any money, and that's why

100
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:43,120
they've been going for these extra revenue streams?

101
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:47,160
It could be to do with that, but it's just all speculation really, because it's kind

102
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:53,500
of just the usual, I want to step back and spend more time with family and stuff.

103
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:57,560
It just all seems a bit strange timing wise.

104
00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:01,800
It's also a reminder of the corporate structure that exists within Mozilla.

105
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:05,800
They've hired someone to help them search for a new CEO.

106
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,000
We'll see who they find.

107
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:11,160
Yeah, they've retained the services of Tuck Richards from the recruiting firm Russell

108
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:13,920
Reynolds to find a replacement.

109
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:18,480
But in the meantime, if they can't find someone by the end of the year, Mitchell Baker is

110
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:21,240
going to step in as interim CEO.

111
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:24,920
She's currently the executive chairwoman of the foundation and Mozilla Corporation.

112
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:27,160
Yeah, so she seems well suited.

113
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:30,600
I wonder if she will end up just getting the job.

114
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:33,680
It doesn't look like it from what she said, but you never know.

115
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:38,520
And it should also be said, Mozilla is a very different company, and while they feel that

116
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:42,480
the search committee knows what they're looking for, I can't imagine finding a new CEO who

117
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:45,960
understands Mozilla's unique mission would be an easy task.

118
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:48,920
Yeah, it's not your typical tech giant, is it?

119
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:54,760
No, they're trying to build for an open and better internet and not necessarily just profits

120
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:55,760
and returns.

121
00:06:55,760 --> 00:07:01,760
Well, more news from Mozilla this week, Thunderbird 68 is being released, and this is a huge release

122
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:02,760
for them.

123
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:06,920
I know you, Joe, and you must be excited about the new app menu.

124
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:10,120
It's a hamburger menu, oh yes.

125
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:13,840
But it's more than just small changes like that and the ability to mark all folders of

126
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:19,920
an account as read and time zone, data improvements, spellcheck improvements.

127
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:23,560
It's the huge under the hood changes that have taken place, which mean that now only

128
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:28,960
web extension dictionaries and themes are supported, and the add-ons are only supported

129
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:31,400
if they've been adapted to work with it.

130
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:36,360
Because of this, the latest version, 68, is not a direct upgrade at this time.

131
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:39,080
You're going to have to go download it manually if you want to try it out.

132
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:44,680
Yeah, but 68.1 will come out fairly soon, and you will be able to update to that.

133
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:47,800
With all these big changes, it makes sense that they're playing it safe this time.

134
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:48,800
Yeah, it does.

135
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:54,440
They've clearly thought about this because if you try and transfer your profile data

136
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:59,400
to a machine that has an older version of Thunderbird, then it will warn you and won't

137
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:04,280
open up unless you specifically tell it to allow the downgrade to that older version.

138
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:08,840
And don't forget, they've included a little something for Chris here too, and that's improved

139
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:09,840
dark theme support.

140
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:13,920
Yeah, they're definitely getting with the times and making his prediction come true.

141
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:16,320
So yeah, that's no good, is it?

142
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:20,320
It is nice to see some of these UI and UX improvements.

143
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:24,080
I think one thing that's held Thunderbird back over the years is it's just not that

144
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,080
pretty.

145
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:28,800
Yeah, it has definitely felt neglected, but it feels like they care more about it.

146
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:32,920
I mean, they hired Ryan Sipes to be their community manager, and he's been really getting

147
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:36,080
the word out there and really promoting it.

148
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:41,600
And so it feels like Mozilla is starting to realize that, hang on, a standalone email

149
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:44,000
client isn't something that's totally dead.

150
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:50,080
Yes, a lot of people use webmail, but it's important to have a decent standalone email

151
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:52,120
client as well.

152
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:55,000
And they are the organization to do it.

153
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:59,700
Right, to take advantage of the open and federated standard that is email, well, we need a great

154
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:00,700
open source client.

155
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:03,040
Yeah, we can't all just rely on Gmail, can we?

156
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:08,720
Well, if you do rely on Gmail, you may be interested in Google's new Chromebook Enterprise

157
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:09,720
devices.

158
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:15,520
There are two new machines from Dell, the Latitude 5300 and 5400, kind of convertible

159
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:21,640
all in one and just a regular laptop, which I checked and Dell are selling with Windows

160
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:25,100
10 at the moment, but they're soon going to be selling them with the Enterprise version

161
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:26,100
of Chrome OS.

162
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:30,780
Now, that Enterprise version has been around for a while, but these are the first devices

163
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:32,840
that come preloaded with that.

164
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:36,220
And they've got a few enterprise friendly features, you know, the ability to remotely

165
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:37,400
disable a device.

166
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:41,640
You can delete all user data at an end of a session and well, you can integrate with

167
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:44,600
the always popular Active Directory.

168
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:49,120
Google also says it's massively revamped its admin console with performance and design

169
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,280
improvements in mind.

170
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:54,900
Yeah, this is Google really trying to have a go at Microsoft in the enterprise space

171
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:58,240
because how long has Microsoft dominated that space?

172
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:06,300
It's been decades, whereas now the needs of users in enterprise have changed really.

173
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:13,520
And you're seeing the rise of iPad Pros and that tablet end of things, which Google hasn't

174
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:16,700
really been able to compete in that area.

175
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:23,580
Whereas Chrome OS now is very much established, very mature, and with these enterprise features

176
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:28,540
could potentially take on Windows in the enterprise.

177
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:32,200
And if that does happen, it means that we're basically going to have desktop Linux.

178
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:36,520
Okay, you've got to put the asterisk there, but it is essentially desktop Linux in the

179
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:37,520
enterprise.

180
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:42,160
They've even emphasized in the release the ability to enable what they call managed Linux

181
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:44,680
environments on Chromebooks.

182
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:49,800
It's interesting how they've managed to target both simple end user workflows and more complicated

183
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:51,200
developer focused tasks.

184
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,600
Yeah, that's certainly the aim.

185
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:53,600
But what do you think?

186
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:57,320
Do you think they actually have a chance of competing with Microsoft in the enterprise?

187
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:59,800
Because the enterprise moves very slowly, doesn't it?

188
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:00,800
Yes, it does.

189
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:05,520
And Microsoft has a long history of knowing how to work those relationships.

190
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:09,660
Google a little bit less so, although I think it does make sense as they try to build their

191
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:10,660
cloud business.

192
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:11,660
Well, that's true.

193
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:14,720
I don't know though, it's such an embedded thing.

194
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:20,040
How many business people do you see on, well, in my case, on the tube with their ThinkPads

195
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:25,440
and they're all running Windows and the fact that, okay, you can run local applications

196
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:33,580
to some extent now with Chrome OS is still very much a kind of always connected operating

197
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:35,620
system.

198
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:42,340
And just little things like that, I don't know, for me, it feels like they will probably

199
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:48,160
take some of the market, but I can't see them dominating to the extent that Microsoft have

200
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:49,420
with Windows.

201
00:11:49,420 --> 00:11:53,120
Maybe some new organizations, people contemplating a change or upgrading their machines might

202
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:56,960
consider this, but it's going to take a long time, if ever, to penetrate some of those

203
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:58,720
entrenched markets.

204
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:02,880
It is interesting though, these are decently specked machines, up to 32 gigs of RAM and

205
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:05,240
a terabyte SSD drive.

206
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:07,480
This is a long way from the first Chromebooks we saw.

207
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:09,960
But it's not the very latest hardware in these.

208
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:14,680
It's not like the 10th generation CPUs that we've seen in the XPSs that were announced

209
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:15,680
recently.

210
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:18,480
So Dell's not quite going all in on this.

211
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:22,600
And it's interesting that Google have said that it's not an exclusive deal and that we

212
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:26,480
might well see other OEMs shipping these enterprise Chromebooks soon.

213
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:29,360
Hey, maybe that means better Linux drivers for everyone.

214
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:31,120
Well, that was my thought as well.

215
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:38,800
Does it mean that a Latitude 5300 or 5400 are going to be decent Linux machines?

216
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:39,800
Probably right?

217
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:43,200
Because they must have picked something that had reasonable Linux support in the first

218
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:47,640
place and maybe they changed out the wireless card or whatever, but that's easy enough to

219
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:49,180
do generally.

220
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:53,720
So yeah, the more Chromebooks we see, probably the more Linux support we're going to see.

221
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:56,800
Somehow Joe, I don't see you running one anytime soon.

222
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:57,800
Not an enterprise one.

223
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:02,080
I do have an old Chromebook and I've been thinking about getting a new one to kind of

224
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:07,400
see where Chrome OS is because I've just been running proper Linux on it, gallium OS on

225
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:12,280
my Chromebook for a long time now because it's so underpowered, but it would be interesting

226
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:14,640
to see where they are with it.

227
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:16,560
Maybe that's a good excuse to buy a new toy.

228
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:17,560
That's how I'll sell it to my wife.

229
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:18,560
Good thinking.

230
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:19,560
That's a good idea.

231
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:24,960
Well, soon I might be able to check and update the firmware on my huge stack of existing

232
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:25,960
laptops though.

233
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:32,040
Yeah, Dell has reached out to Red Hat's Richard Hughes to work with an intern and build a

234
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:35,680
power user GTK app for managing firmware.

235
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:39,960
Now this would be independent of the existing GNOME software tool that can already do some

236
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:40,960
of those things.

237
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:45,520
Yeah, the main difference seems to be that in GNOME software, that's all about just updating

238
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:50,360
to the latest firmware, checking is there a new version available and then giving you

239
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:53,560
that update, whereas this is more nuanced than that.

240
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:58,600
This is more looking at the different versions of firmware that have been available in the

241
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:04,200
past and you can potentially downgrade if an older update has given you some issues

242
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:05,400
or whatever.

243
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:08,280
So this seems like it's going to be a very useful tool.

244
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:13,040
Of course, you can already do those things on the command line with thwupd, but having

245
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:18,120
a GUI client, well, that would be great and it kind of speaks a lot to how far we've come

246
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:19,520
in the world of Linux and firmware.

247
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:24,280
It used to be that you had to go burn some sort of ancient free DOS application and reboot

248
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:28,600
into it and hope that you didn't break your machine and now you just click a few buttons

249
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:29,600
in a UI.

250
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:34,120
Well, when I read about this this week, the first thing I thought was, hang on, System

251
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:39,320
76 have just announced their firmware manager, which I talked with Chris about last week

252
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:45,180
and how that can use either the System 76-firmware tool or thwupd.

253
00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:49,440
And so the timing of this seems a bit bad for System 76.

254
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:52,280
It's kind of hogged their limelight almost.

255
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:57,640
I suppose for us, it's still good that we've got a plethora of tools available, but you're

256
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:58,640
right.

257
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:01,600
There's sort of independent organizations working at the same task right now.

258
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:05,260
Yeah, which could be a bit of wasted effort, but also competition is good, right?

259
00:15:05,260 --> 00:15:10,440
So maybe they will kind of push each other forward and we'll end up with two excellent

260
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:11,440
firmware updaters.

261
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:14,000
It's a bit like video editors, eh?

262
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
It is.

263
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,960
It's interesting to note too that it seems to be Del further recognizing the value of

264
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:22,960
working upstream in the open source community instead of having to roll something themselves.

265
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:23,960
Yeah, that's true.

266
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:24,960
Yeah.

267
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:29,080
Well, also from Grom this week, they have been working with Endless on what they're

268
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:33,640
calling the Coding Education Challenge, a competition aimed to attract projects that

269
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:39,060
offer educators and students new and innovative ideas to teach coding with free and open source

270
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:40,800
software.

271
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:45,160
Endless has given them $500,000 in funding to support the prizes, and hey, that's a good

272
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:46,160
chunk of change.

273
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:47,420
It is a good chunk of change.

274
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:51,960
And so there's going to be 20 teams selected from the applicants, and there's going to

275
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:58,160
be various rounds where you can win various amounts of money, but ultimately the winner

276
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:03,640
is going to get $100,000, and the second prize is $25,000.

277
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:09,120
So it's quite a lot of money, seems to be well worth getting involved with this.

278
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:11,320
Anyone is encouraged to submit a proposal.

279
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:14,240
And I like the way they've structured this, you know, they sort of pick some of the better

280
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:18,240
ideas, move on to a prototyping phase, and if you make it to the final round, well, you

281
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:19,920
turn your prototype into a real product.

282
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:23,980
You know, I was reading this thinking this is exactly the kind of thing the Grom Foundation

283
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:29,720
should be doing, getting involved with other companies who can put up the money for competitions

284
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:35,360
like this and endeavors that will generally further free and open source software, especially

285
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:38,040
in education, because get them young and then get them hooked.

286
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:43,200
But then I thought, Endless, didn't they lay off a bunch of people not that long ago, and

287
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:48,320
don't they seem to just be constantly pivoting their business model?

288
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:52,160
And so where did they get half a million dollars to put into this?

289
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:56,320
Right, I mean, it makes sense that they'd want to support it, but that's a lot of money.

290
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:57,880
They're obviously doing better than I thought.

291
00:16:57,880 --> 00:16:59,300
So fair play to them.

292
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:02,680
If you'd like more details or to submit a proposal, well, you'll have to go check out

293
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:04,720
the Gnome Foundation website.

294
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:08,640
Of course, we'll have that linked linuxactionnews.com slash one to one.

295
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:09,640
All right.

296
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:13,200
Well, I always like to end if possible with a cryptocurrency story mostly to troll Chris,

297
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:16,000
but I'm afraid you're getting trolled this time.

298
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:22,200
And this week is that Telegram is actually going to launch his gram cryptocurrency.

299
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:24,320
And it's got to do it by Halloween.

300
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:26,920
Otherwise, they're in deep trouble.

301
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:30,600
Back in 2018, they raised $1.7 billion.

302
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:32,960
Yes, that's right.

303
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:37,080
But they promised they would have this stuff launched by October 31.

304
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:38,920
And well, it's getting to be crunch time.

305
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:42,400
There were reports back in May that they'd canceled this initial coin offering.

306
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:47,160
So it was a bit of a surprise this week when the New York Times reported that it was going

307
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:53,400
ahead and that pretty much all 300 million users of Telegram are going to be offered

308
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:55,020
the gram wallet.

309
00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:59,420
It's been a bit confusing too, because while Telegram has maintained a decent level of

310
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:04,680
secrecy around this project, a lot of the work is being done by Ton Labs, which is a

311
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:09,840
separate company founded to build developer tools for Telegram and well, they're kind

312
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:10,840
of vocal.

313
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:15,280
But this Telegram Open Networks, it is a little bit strange and it feels like it's just a

314
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:21,320
hype that has died down and now they have to kind of deliver on hype that was sort of

315
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:24,160
yesterday's news or last year's news.

316
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:29,140
But according to Coindesk, the code for this was due to be released today.

317
00:18:29,140 --> 00:18:37,400
Now having to dig around and it does take a deep dig around, you can find a client available,

318
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:41,760
but there seem to be some aspects of it that aren't readily available yet.

319
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:42,760
Right.

320
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:47,100
That client was leaked back in the spring and has seen some regular updates, one that

321
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:52,480
was just published on the 31st, but no signs yet of things like their sharding implementation

322
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:55,240
or the consensus mechanism used for the chain.

323
00:18:55,240 --> 00:19:00,000
Yeah, presumably that will be forthcoming probably by the time this gets edited and

324
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
released.

325
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,200
So maybe this is bad timing by us.

326
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:03,200
Of course.

327
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:05,840
But what's interesting is that this is going to be compatible with Ethereum.

328
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:06,840
Right.

329
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:11,680
And the tools we're expecting should allow apps built for the Ethereum chain to run on

330
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:12,680
TUN.

331
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:18,000
Now we should note a lot of this information is not officially confirmed and all the interesting

332
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:23,440
developers are kind of just hoping that the leaked information has so far been accurate.

333
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:27,800
You basically just have to go find the tarball and inspect the provided files and hope that

334
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:28,800
this is somehow official.

335
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:34,320
What are you telling me that something blockchain related is sketchy and not to be trusted necessarily?

336
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:35,320
Who would have thought?

337
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:41,800
Well, we'll keep an eye on that and of course all the other Linux and open source news and

338
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:43,840
report back on future shows.

339
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:48,220
And the easiest way to get those future shows is to go to linuxactionnews.com slash subscribe

340
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:50,120
for all the ways to get new episodes.

341
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:53,520
And linuxactionnews.com slash contact for ways to get in touch.

342
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:57,640
We'll be back next Monday with our weekly take on the latest Linux and open source news.

343
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:59,120
I'm at Joe Ressington.

344
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:00,680
I'm at Wes Payne.

345
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:13,320
Thanks for joining us and we'll see you next week.
