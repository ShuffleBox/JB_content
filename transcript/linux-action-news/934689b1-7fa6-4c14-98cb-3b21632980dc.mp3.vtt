00:00.000 --> 00:09.360
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, episode 141, recorded on January 19th, 2020.

00:09.360 --> 00:10.360
I'm Chris.

00:10.360 --> 00:11.360
And I'm Joe.

00:11.360 --> 00:12.360
Hello, Joe.

00:12.360 --> 00:16.520
Good to be connected with you, but unfortunately we start things out with some somber news.

00:16.520 --> 00:21.880
Yeah, Mark Greaves, who was the Peppermint project lead, sadly is no longer with us.

00:21.880 --> 00:26.160
It really sucks anytime we lose anyone in the community, but it really hurts when it's

00:26.160 --> 00:31.400
someone who was pretty well known and was responsible for a project that people really

00:31.400 --> 00:32.400
enjoy.

00:32.400 --> 00:34.640
I hear really good things about Peppermint OS.

00:34.640 --> 00:39.640
Mark went by PCNetSpec online, so you may have interacted with him as that.

00:39.640 --> 00:43.160
And we pass our condolences on to his family as well.

00:43.160 --> 00:45.440
Yeah, and indeed the whole community.

00:45.440 --> 00:47.480
As you say, he was extremely well liked.

00:47.480 --> 00:52.440
I never had the pleasure of meeting him, unfortunately, but from the tributes that I've seen, he was

00:52.440 --> 00:53.440
a really good guy.

00:53.440 --> 00:56.640
So this is just a terrible, terrible shame.

00:56.640 --> 01:00.120
The hits keep rolling with some bad news from Mozilla this week.

01:00.120 --> 01:03.840
It appears they've done a rather significant round of layoffs.

01:03.840 --> 01:09.600
Yeah, it looks like they're going to lay off at least 70 people, potentially even as many

01:09.600 --> 01:13.280
as 100, depending on how things go.

01:13.280 --> 01:16.880
And a lot of those are engineers and QA people.

01:16.880 --> 01:20.480
So this is really not good at all.

01:20.480 --> 01:26.960
The silver lining to the story is on Twitter, I saw a lot of people responding to the announcements

01:26.960 --> 01:30.280
from individuals who were laid off with job offers.

01:30.280 --> 01:34.440
People that have worked at this organization for a while and gotten to a certain level

01:34.440 --> 01:36.360
seem to be perhaps hot commodities.

01:36.360 --> 01:40.440
So hopefully there's at least some that will land pretty quickly.

01:40.440 --> 01:46.720
It appears that this all really comes down to a slower than expected move to new revenue

01:46.720 --> 01:47.720
sources.

01:47.720 --> 01:52.600
The current chairwoman and interim CEO, Mitchell Baker, specifically mentions the slow rollout

01:52.600 --> 01:57.520
of the organization's new revenue generating products such as subscription services.

01:57.520 --> 02:02.400
Quote, you may recall that we expected to be earning revenue in 2019 and 2020 from new

02:02.400 --> 02:08.080
subscription products, as well as higher revenue from sources outside of search.

02:08.080 --> 02:09.320
This did not happen.

02:09.320 --> 02:11.400
Well, who could have seen that coming, eh?

02:11.400 --> 02:13.240
Yeah, that Google money was pretty nice.

02:13.240 --> 02:18.320
Of course, Mozilla was under a lot of pressure to get off of that revenue source.

02:18.320 --> 02:24.120
She goes on to say our 2019 plan underestimated how long it would take to build and ship new

02:24.120 --> 02:26.120
revenue generating products.

02:26.120 --> 02:31.800
Given that, and all we learned in 2019 about the pace of innovation, we decided to take

02:31.800 --> 02:35.780
a more conservative approach to our project and revenue for 2020.

02:35.780 --> 02:40.840
We also agreed to the principle of living within our means of not spending more than

02:40.840 --> 02:47.880
we can earn for the foreseeable future, i.e. that's boss speak for reductions.

02:47.880 --> 02:54.440
Now, I guess these reductions come with generous exit packages and, as they always say, support

02:54.440 --> 02:55.440
in outplacement.

02:55.440 --> 03:00.320
Yeah, and for the staff that are in the UK and France, both those countries have pretty

03:00.320 --> 03:05.000
strict labor laws, which mean you can't just fire someone immediately.

03:05.000 --> 03:08.740
So that's where the uncertainty about the numbers comes from.

03:08.740 --> 03:13.060
And they will probably get pretty good packages kind of by law.

03:13.060 --> 03:18.160
So it's not a complete disaster, but it's still not very nice for the people involved.

03:18.160 --> 03:22.360
I hope and I assume they must be doing an internal analysis about why things didn't

03:22.360 --> 03:26.180
meet their expectations and launch at the pace they expected.

03:26.180 --> 03:28.740
I'd like to hear that they're getting their hands around that.

03:28.740 --> 03:31.340
That I think would be the ultimate resolution.

03:31.340 --> 03:35.940
But I just have a random question because they're looking at VPN solutions.

03:35.940 --> 03:39.480
They're looking at all these different ways to generate subscription service and they're

03:39.480 --> 03:44.600
trying to change the Firefox brand to be more about privacy and protection.

03:44.600 --> 03:51.840
Would you be willing as just a straight up subscription to subscribe to support Firefox

03:51.840 --> 03:52.840
development?

03:52.840 --> 03:53.840
It's not a VPN service.

03:53.840 --> 03:56.600
It doesn't get you cloud storage.

03:56.600 --> 03:59.480
It just pays for the development of Firefox.

03:59.480 --> 04:03.380
Maybe it gives you access to something else extra.

04:03.380 --> 04:04.380
I don't know.

04:04.380 --> 04:08.460
But it is fundamentally just a way to pay for Firefox.

04:08.460 --> 04:10.880
Would you, Joe Resington, personally do that?

04:10.880 --> 04:15.080
I'd like to say that I would, but I don't know if that's really honest.

04:15.080 --> 04:16.080
I don't know.

04:16.080 --> 04:21.580
I'd have to see that proposition in front of me and see how much it was, but I could

04:21.580 --> 04:22.580
do that right now.

04:22.580 --> 04:25.580
I could donate regularly to them, but I don't.

04:25.580 --> 04:27.780
So probably not.

04:27.780 --> 04:28.780
True.

04:28.780 --> 04:29.780
True.

04:29.780 --> 04:33.400
I wonder if it was as easy as it is to sign up for a VPN service if people might not just

04:33.400 --> 04:38.380
add it on or support Firefox development add on to some of these other existing subscriptions,

04:38.380 --> 04:41.880
sort of bundle it in there for a small price.

04:41.880 --> 04:47.180
Because fundamentally, I just want a good secure browser that I can trust and that is

04:47.180 --> 04:48.680
putting the user's needs first.

04:48.680 --> 04:53.080
We need that as a balance in the marketplace more so than ever.

04:53.080 --> 04:55.920
So fundamentally, I really hope they get this sorted out.

04:55.920 --> 04:59.980
We used to joke about how much money Mozilla had back in the old days, but things are not

04:59.980 --> 05:00.980
looking so great.

05:00.980 --> 05:05.300
They've even considered shutting down their innovation fund, but decided that it needed

05:05.300 --> 05:11.860
to stick around in order to keep actually discovering new products that they could monetize.

05:11.860 --> 05:16.380
But you are not alone in wanting them to double down on the browser.

05:16.380 --> 05:20.760
Because that seems to be the consensus in the community from what I've seen.

05:20.760 --> 05:25.020
They just wish they'd stop messing around with all these side projects and just concentrate

05:25.020 --> 05:30.740
on the browser, the core product, which to some extent they have and they've made it

05:30.740 --> 05:35.180
better and more competitive with Chrome, but it's just not working, is it?

05:35.180 --> 05:40.820
So maybe if they did only do the browser, then they'd just dwindle away to virtually

05:40.820 --> 05:45.380
no market share, just a few people who really care about freedom.

05:45.380 --> 05:50.940
To channel my former inner small business CEO, I think I would have to ask you the question

05:50.940 --> 05:56.660
of isn't this the exact human cost we pay for Google dumping on the market?

05:56.660 --> 06:00.960
Not to be anti-Google about this because fair enough to them, they were in a position to

06:00.960 --> 06:05.680
leverage their success to guarantee some security in the market.

06:05.680 --> 06:07.540
They had every right to do that.

06:07.540 --> 06:12.440
But by taking something like Chrome and making it really freaking great and investing who

06:12.440 --> 06:20.020
knows how many millions, potentially billions into staff, R&D, testing, commercialization,

06:20.020 --> 06:27.020
advertising, branding, they have essentially an endless supply of money they can dump into

06:27.020 --> 06:30.220
this thing to make it a market dominator.

06:30.220 --> 06:35.220
Plus they were able to come in when technology progressed in a significant way from when

06:35.220 --> 06:37.380
Firefox was originally conceived.

06:37.380 --> 06:41.300
So they started very competitive and they had the resources and means to do it and then

06:41.300 --> 06:44.900
they made it free and they made the backend open source.

06:44.900 --> 06:48.980
So it fundamentally dumps all of the value out of the market.

06:48.980 --> 06:52.220
Firefox can't charge $15 per download.

06:52.220 --> 06:53.460
That'd be ridiculous.

06:53.460 --> 06:58.000
In a marketplace where you've got so many browsers that are now based off of essentially

06:58.000 --> 07:03.700
WebKit and Blink, they can't be the one off with their weird gecko engine that charges

07:03.700 --> 07:06.420
$15 for a download in 2020.

07:06.420 --> 07:13.060
It's just not even possible because they're up against something like Chrome or now something

07:13.060 --> 07:19.940
like Edge, which this week, the old version of Edge faded away and it's now a Blink based

07:19.940 --> 07:21.180
Edge world.

07:21.180 --> 07:23.420
And it's all WebKit and Blink essentially.

07:23.420 --> 07:28.340
Yeah, which is why it's so fundamentally important that we have a competitor to it.

07:28.340 --> 07:30.780
But yet they can't charge for the product.

07:30.780 --> 07:35.760
And if they fail, we essentially have lost the people's advocate in web browsers.

07:35.760 --> 07:39.380
You're making me want to reconsider my decision not to donate to them now.

07:39.380 --> 07:41.900
I think you're doing a pretty good sales job here.

07:41.900 --> 07:44.460
I got to say, they sell some nice swag too.

07:44.460 --> 07:45.460
So it's something to consider.

07:45.460 --> 07:46.460
All right.

07:46.460 --> 07:51.100
Well, let's cheer things up a little bit with Nextcloud's huge announcement of Nextcloud

07:51.100 --> 07:52.660
Hub this week.

07:52.660 --> 07:53.660
Nextcloud Hub.

07:53.660 --> 07:54.660
Hub.

07:54.660 --> 07:55.660
Hub.

07:55.660 --> 07:56.660
Yeah.

07:56.660 --> 08:01.260
Well, it's Nextcloud 18 really, but they've gone through a bit of a rebranding to signify

08:01.260 --> 08:06.580
the significance of not just the improvements, but also the new integration of out of the

08:06.580 --> 08:07.580
box apps.

08:07.580 --> 08:09.900
Well, actually not quite out of the box.

08:09.900 --> 08:10.900
Shortly after the box apps.

08:10.900 --> 08:15.500
Yeah, it's a curious approach where apps get installed straight after you install the main

08:15.500 --> 08:16.500
software.

08:16.500 --> 08:18.860
I don't know why they don't just bundle them.

08:18.860 --> 08:23.860
I suppose a couple advantages would be you get the latest version and then that app developer

08:23.860 --> 08:27.860
gets some stats, gets a sense of how many people actually have it deployed.

08:27.860 --> 08:28.860
Yeah.

08:28.860 --> 08:30.940
And I suppose if you had an older version, it'd have to be updated anyway.

08:30.940 --> 08:36.540
So you may as well just not bother make the initial download smaller or whatever.

08:36.540 --> 08:41.780
But this is kind of coming together of a lot of what they had been doing previously with

08:41.780 --> 08:45.700
a little bit added on and a rebrand.

08:45.700 --> 08:49.100
It's a fairly clever strategy because it got a lot of attention.

08:49.100 --> 08:53.300
Names matter and the way people think about things matter and this changes the way people

08:53.300 --> 08:54.300
think about it.

08:54.300 --> 08:59.140
And the thing that I've definitely noticed in the conversations around this news story

08:59.140 --> 09:04.500
is it's clearly positioned as an Office 365 slash Google Apps competitor now.

09:04.500 --> 09:11.260
People are clicking, oh, I could replace a bunch of these commercial cloud platform services

09:11.260 --> 09:12.740
with Nextcloud.

09:12.740 --> 09:16.300
When it lacked a couple of things, I think it just didn't click.

09:16.300 --> 09:20.580
When you position it to Nextcloud Hub and they change how they talk about it a little

09:20.580 --> 09:26.020
bit, it better represents the full scope of the project now and its full capabilities

09:26.020 --> 09:28.500
of what it can replace from commercial providers.

09:28.500 --> 09:29.500
I think it's working.

09:29.500 --> 09:30.880
People get it more.

09:30.880 --> 09:35.860
The biggest new feature is the integration of OnlyOffice because they had Collabora as

09:35.860 --> 09:40.860
an option before, but now they're putting OnlyOffice front and center and so you can

09:40.860 --> 09:46.740
have a Google Docs style experience and also have really good compatibility with Microsoft's

09:46.740 --> 09:48.780
Office 365.

09:48.780 --> 09:53.220
So I can see how that's attractive to people, especially as you can run this on premises

09:53.220 --> 09:55.140
and be in complete control of it.

09:55.140 --> 10:01.060
I'm not a user of OnlyOffice, but my understanding is they market it as 100% compatible with

10:01.060 --> 10:08.820
Microsoft Office formats, and I think its native file format is XLSX and Xdoc or whatever

10:08.820 --> 10:09.820
it is.

10:09.820 --> 10:12.980
It doesn't use the open document format.

10:12.980 --> 10:18.380
Now, like Joe said, the key thing is you can throw this on a Nextcloud box on your LAN

10:18.380 --> 10:23.340
and have something that, in my opinion, has a better UI than Google Docs.

10:23.340 --> 10:29.420
I don't think the overall product features are as competitive, but if your needs are

10:29.420 --> 10:37.940
centralized, easy go-to collaboration in something that has a UI that's, I think, kind of nicer

10:37.940 --> 10:40.100
than Google Docs, it'll do that.

10:40.100 --> 10:45.960
I think it lacks some features that heavy Google Docs or Office 365 users would want,

10:45.960 --> 10:50.460
but this sort of walks that line of probably solving it for 80% of people out there.

10:50.460 --> 10:55.220
Well, as long as you don't have a high-resolution monitor and want to zoom in, that is.

10:55.220 --> 11:00.980
Because I do that in Google Docs, and it all resizes perfectly, whereas in the OnlyOffice

11:00.980 --> 11:04.980
demo that I tried, it didn't resize properly at all.

11:04.980 --> 11:11.180
It just made it all blurry and weird, so I wasn't very impressed there, I must say.

11:11.180 --> 11:12.180
Yeah.

11:12.180 --> 11:13.540
I mean, it's a different market.

11:13.540 --> 11:15.300
There's a lot of Office competitors.

11:15.300 --> 11:19.860
We talked about FreeOffice not too long ago in the context of Manjaro.

11:19.860 --> 11:25.180
This is a market, and people want to solve this in a way that works for a large portion

11:25.180 --> 11:26.180
of users.

11:26.180 --> 11:30.580
If you can deploy something like this on a server, even if it's not perfect, if it solves

11:30.580 --> 11:34.300
it for a lot of the people or the majority of the people and you're not necessarily having

11:34.300 --> 11:36.580
to pay Office licenses, it's great.

11:36.580 --> 11:42.260
I will point out that I believe the absolutely free version of OnlyOffice may have some limitations.

11:42.260 --> 11:45.820
They have a pay version that you can license.

11:45.820 --> 11:49.500
I couldn't tell you more than that, so you might just want to do some research.

11:49.500 --> 11:52.860
The limitations may be completely acceptable or may not exist, but it is worth looking

11:52.860 --> 11:53.860
into.

11:53.860 --> 11:58.140
When I did some research, it appears, at least from the documentation, I could find that

11:58.140 --> 12:02.540
there's somewhere around a 20, 25 concurrent user limit on the free version.

12:02.540 --> 12:04.340
That's pretty nice.

12:04.340 --> 12:10.180
And really, if you've got more than 20 users, it's probably time to pay for the thing anyways.

12:10.180 --> 12:11.380
There are some other new features, of course.

12:11.380 --> 12:15.180
They've got a nice-looking Photos application, which is new.

12:15.180 --> 12:22.260
And also, they've rewritten the user interface for Torque, and that's all integrated in nicely.

12:22.260 --> 12:23.940
So it is looking pretty good.

12:23.940 --> 12:25.180
I am keen to try it.

12:25.180 --> 12:30.500
We're going to have to upgrade our current 17 version and maybe try some of these features.

12:30.500 --> 12:35.380
Well, Huawei has some new features that they desperately want developers to try.

12:35.380 --> 12:39.500
Yeah, this week at an event in London, they revealed more details about their Huawei Mobile

12:39.500 --> 12:47.420
Services System, or HMS, which is a direct replacement for GMS, Google Mobile Services.

12:47.420 --> 12:52.420
This is all wrapped up in the political wrangling and the trade war that means that they can't

12:52.420 --> 12:56.460
really bundle Google services, so they need a replacement.

12:56.460 --> 12:58.940
And it looks like they're pretty much on track to do that.

12:58.940 --> 13:02.940
Can we just appreciate the scope of what they're trying to pull off here?

13:02.940 --> 13:06.720
They're trying to convince developers that they can ship a compelling Android system,

13:06.720 --> 13:12.940
not just developers, consumers, obviously carriers, but they're trying to convince a

13:12.940 --> 13:18.820
public that they can make a competitive system running on Android without Google services.

13:18.820 --> 13:23.660
It's the very situation that Samsung ended up making a massive deal with Google, if you'll

13:23.660 --> 13:27.140
recall years ago, to avoid.

13:27.140 --> 13:30.400
Even though they've kept their own independent apps, they've never been able to pull that

13:30.400 --> 13:33.380
trigger because they're afraid of how the market would react.

13:33.380 --> 13:34.380
That's my assumption.

13:34.380 --> 13:41.340
Well, Huawei claims that they've already signed up 55,000 apps using the HMS core, which is

13:41.340 --> 13:44.620
free to register for, and there's different developer kits they'll issue you depending

13:44.620 --> 13:47.100
on what you're doing for free as well.

13:47.100 --> 13:53.180
And they say their app gallery currently is attracting 400 million active users.

13:53.180 --> 13:56.560
So that's pretty significant, but when you consider the scope of what they're trying

13:56.560 --> 14:02.780
to pull off and the fact that those numbers are not validatable, Huawei is the sole provider

14:02.780 --> 14:07.540
of that data source, and we don't know exactly what qualifies as an active user or how many

14:07.540 --> 14:11.780
developers are actually creating applications, so they're just touting the best case scenario.

14:11.780 --> 14:16.140
But even given that, they seem to have gotten more traction than I even thought they would

14:16.140 --> 14:21.140
get to, and there appears to be some momentum based on the results of that event they were

14:21.140 --> 14:22.140
at.

14:22.140 --> 14:26.620
The thing is, though, do they really care about the Western market, ultimately?

14:26.620 --> 14:31.740
That's kind of what I kept thinking about while I was reading about this, that the Western

14:31.740 --> 14:35.500
market is pretty much saturated at this point.

14:35.500 --> 14:41.260
And okay, yes, it does have a lot of value to them, but would they really miss it?

14:41.260 --> 14:46.580
Because the real growth markets are in China and India and countries like that.

14:46.580 --> 14:51.020
I think it matters, even if it doesn't directly matter to them.

14:51.020 --> 14:58.420
Because for this to be successful, they need other OEMs to support their app kit APIs,

14:58.420 --> 15:04.700
their development kits, the whole Huawei app system, because you need these to be cross-device

15:04.700 --> 15:05.700
applications.

15:05.700 --> 15:12.100
For an example, Huawei is working on a replacement for Android's Quick App feature where it'll

15:12.100 --> 15:13.660
download the parts of the app you need.

15:13.660 --> 15:18.380
I mean, they're really looking at rewriting large portions of what Google provided, so

15:18.380 --> 15:21.540
they've created something called Huawei Quick App.

15:21.540 --> 15:26.540
And they acknowledge that they want this to be a new set of standards, and right now they've

15:26.540 --> 15:30.380
already got 12 major Chinese handset manufacturers to support it.

15:30.380 --> 15:35.780
Now the reason why that matters is that group of Chinese handset manufacturers represent

15:35.780 --> 15:41.600
more than 35% of the global market, so outside of China as well.

15:41.600 --> 15:49.020
That's a way they can get broader adoption without just being limited to Huawei devices.

15:49.020 --> 15:52.260
I think it's a necessary part of their strategy to attract developers.

15:52.260 --> 15:56.540
Well, you could have a point there, because Huawei is investing 20 million pounds into

15:56.540 --> 16:03.220
the UK and Ireland, with some developers able to claim up to 20,000 pounds for apps uploaded

16:03.220 --> 16:06.180
to the Huawei gallery by the end of the month.

16:06.180 --> 16:07.420
Yeah, that's interesting.

16:07.420 --> 16:09.820
They're really trying to attract developers in that market.

16:09.820 --> 16:15.180
And Huawei's approach to the press was, yeah, we're in this position now, but strategically

16:15.180 --> 16:19.380
we needed to solve this anyways, it's just been accelerated, this is something we need

16:19.380 --> 16:20.380
to get done.

16:20.380 --> 16:24.460
Well, another company that's been very strategic when it comes to the platforms they support

16:24.460 --> 16:29.620
is Valve, and it looks like Steam may well be coming to Chrome OS at some point soon.

16:29.620 --> 16:33.780
Yeah, last week David Ruddick, writing over to Android Police, spoke to the director of

16:33.780 --> 16:35.980
product management for Google's Chrome OS.

16:35.980 --> 16:40.620
So this is an exclusive, and it's coming from the product manager.

16:40.620 --> 16:47.220
They say the Chrome team is working, possibly in cooperation with Valve, it wasn't said

16:47.220 --> 16:54.380
indirectly, but it was implied, to bring Steam over to Chromebooks via the Linux compatibility

16:54.380 --> 16:56.740
that already exists.

16:56.740 --> 17:01.860
But it's not clear on exactly what that would mean, if that would also mean perhaps improving

17:01.860 --> 17:05.340
some of the performance, because right now you could install Steam already.

17:05.340 --> 17:09.620
It just runs horrible, even if you were to play on a Chromebook and you just replaced

17:09.620 --> 17:12.580
Chrome OS with Linux, it runs much better under Linux.

17:12.580 --> 17:18.820
There's some limitations in the 3D acceleration performance in that Linux compatibility layer.

17:18.820 --> 17:22.020
And it was implied, although we don't have a direct quote, that that would change, that

17:22.020 --> 17:26.980
we would see Chromebooks, especially Chromebooks, with AMD processors coming.

17:26.980 --> 17:31.940
My first thought on this was the current, affordable Chromebooks at least, do not have

17:31.940 --> 17:33.700
the power for this.

17:33.700 --> 17:38.000
But then you start to think about the kind of remote play stuff, and it suddenly makes

17:38.000 --> 17:39.000
a lot more sense.

17:39.000 --> 17:43.900
Well, honestly, that's why I was surprised to see this, because Chromebooks seem like

17:43.900 --> 17:46.140
the perfect candidate for Stadia.

17:46.140 --> 17:51.260
They don't have dedicated graphics, they're mostly a cloud-based device, they're pretty

17:51.260 --> 17:55.580
solid for that kind of thing, and it really kind of is the perfect target market.

17:55.580 --> 17:58.740
You can't even play games, you don't have a graphics card.

17:58.740 --> 18:01.160
Let's introduce you to this subscription called Stadia.

18:01.160 --> 18:05.500
And I thought, look at that beautiful captive market they have, and then Google goes along

18:05.500 --> 18:11.340
and says, all right, yeah, we'll work with Valve to bring a gaming competitor to our

18:11.340 --> 18:12.340
platform.

18:12.340 --> 18:14.900
I mean, I'm very happy to see it, but I am surprised.

18:14.900 --> 18:20.460
And I guess you could just use it for game streaming, but you put a Chromebook with a

18:20.460 --> 18:25.580
little bit of gaming performance in there, I think it would work.

18:25.580 --> 18:27.980
Students like to game, and parents will spend the money.

18:27.980 --> 18:31.940
For Christmas, I got my son a used ThinkPad.

18:31.940 --> 18:38.140
It was, you know, not super expensive, but one of the requirements was that it needed

18:38.140 --> 18:42.100
a dedicated GPU, because he wants to play the video games.

18:42.100 --> 18:46.900
And so if we see some Chromebooks coming with dedicated AMD graphics or whatever, then this

18:46.900 --> 18:48.860
might suddenly make a lot more sense.

18:48.860 --> 18:52.220
I would have had to ask myself, what do I get him?

18:52.220 --> 18:54.660
Because he uses a Chromebook every day at school.

18:54.660 --> 18:58.820
They just, here you go, kid, get a Google account and use a Chromebook.

18:58.820 --> 19:00.380
You don't need that pen and paper.

19:00.380 --> 19:05.620
And it's been like that since he was like in very early days of school, very, very like

19:05.620 --> 19:07.120
very early days.

19:07.120 --> 19:09.780
And so he really knows how to navigate that platform.

19:09.780 --> 19:12.980
He's, you know, he's like the go to support kid in class.

19:12.980 --> 19:16.860
And so there would be a lot of advantages to giving him that same environment at home.

19:16.860 --> 19:18.380
I don't know if I'd do it.

19:18.380 --> 19:22.140
I prefer a ThinkPad with elementary OS, it just works super good for him.

19:22.140 --> 19:23.140
And guess what?

19:23.140 --> 19:24.320
We installed Steam.

19:24.320 --> 19:28.540
First thing we did, I loaded him up with a bunch of Steam games.

19:28.540 --> 19:31.300
I think I still would have made that choice.

19:31.300 --> 19:34.660
But I could see a lot of parents going the Chromebook route.

19:34.660 --> 19:39.560
And definitely as if their other alternative was going to be a Windows 10 laptop or a thousand

19:39.560 --> 19:41.480
dollar plus MacBook.

19:41.480 --> 19:46.760
Even a $700 Chromebook is a good deal in that kind of market.

19:46.760 --> 19:49.860
And the other thing too, Joe, is as Dylan gets older, let's say he keeps using these

19:49.860 --> 19:53.040
Chromebooks for all the way through high school.

19:53.040 --> 19:57.260
When he graduates, if they have continued to evolve the platform and its capabilities

19:57.260 --> 20:02.100
and hardware feature set, maybe it would make sense as an adult when you buy your first

20:02.100 --> 20:04.340
computer to just buy a beefy Chromebook.

20:04.340 --> 20:06.540
It's kind of the Apple strategy, isn't it?

20:06.540 --> 20:09.260
Well, I can see that feature panning out definitely.

20:09.260 --> 20:11.260
But in the short term, this has got to be good news for Linux.

20:11.260 --> 20:13.900
It's going to attract more people over to the platform.

20:13.900 --> 20:17.060
It's using the Linux technologies within Chrome OS.

20:17.060 --> 20:18.540
It's using Vulkan.

20:18.540 --> 20:22.580
So that has to be good for the wider platform beyond Chrome OS.

20:22.580 --> 20:23.580
Yeah.

20:23.580 --> 20:26.100
In the meantime, we're doing pretty good on the desktop Linux side.

20:26.100 --> 20:31.380
Over the holidays, I was able to just sit down for a bit and really appreciate the range

20:31.380 --> 20:33.140
of games.

20:33.140 --> 20:37.820
And with the real kind of confidence that just about any game I feel like playing, I

20:37.820 --> 20:39.300
can play on desktop Linux right now.

20:39.300 --> 20:40.300
It's pretty great.

20:40.300 --> 20:43.720
But whatever happens with that story and all the stories in Linux and open source, we'll

20:43.720 --> 20:44.820
