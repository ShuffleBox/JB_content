00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,260
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, episode 205 recorded on September 4, 2021. I'm Chris.

2
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:10,260
And I'm Wes.

3
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:15,320
Hello, Wes from an extremely hot Tucson, Arizona. Let's do the news.

4
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:23,200
And we start with a historic moment for SUSE, the release of SUSE Rancher 2.6. 2.6 is hot

5
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:29,300
on the heels of SUSE's Q2 numbers, the company's first earnings as a public company since their

6
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:35,160
Ranger Labs acquisition. Key takeaways from the investor briefing are the company's confirmation

7
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:43,360
of an annual run rate of 519 million, growth of 16% on the prior year, and perhaps most

8
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:49,580
interestingly, Rancher had an annual run rate of 50 million. That's up 91%.

9
00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:54,800
Those are your numbers the market notices and those are numbers that matter to SUSE.

10
00:00:54,800 --> 00:01:02,280
Rancher 2.6 is released is Rancher now under the SUSE umbrella. It is an evolution of that

11
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:05,900
brand now. And they've kept it with a minor point release. And I think that's actually

12
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:10,320
pretty clever by SUSE. We'll get into that in a moment. But their main goal here with

13
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:15,080
Rancher is to continue to position Rancher as a Kubernetes agnostic management offering.

14
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:20,280
To that end, this latest release supports any cloud native Computing Foundation certified

15
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:25,560
Kubernetes distribution. For on premises workloads, there's the Rancher Kubernetes engine, which

16
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:31,560
runs entirely within Docker containers. And of course, SUSE Rancher supports all the public

17
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:37,120
cloud distributions, doubling down on their efforts to remain cloud agnostic and vendor

18
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:39,900
neutral, the key selling point of Rancher.

19
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:44,360
So what's new in 2.6? Well, actually quite a bit. And it leads one to suspect when you

20
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:50,260
look at all these changes, they avoided bumping the version to 3.0 simply just to set expectations

21
00:01:50,260 --> 00:01:54,440
with customers that, hey, this product you love this Rancher, it's not going to be radically

22
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:58,800
different under SUSE. But when you look at it, it has a whole new improved user experience

23
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:03,920
and a new UI at the top level. They've re-architected some key workflows that right there alone,

24
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:08,240
some companies would bump the version number over and under the hood, they've improved

25
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:13,720
security and they've also strengthened compliance capabilities. But it seems like a lot of engineering

26
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:18,240
work went into rebuilding the containers that Rancher deploys. Of course, when you set up

27
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:21,520
a Rancher deployment, it's going to spin up a lot of the services that you need inside

28
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:27,000
containers automatically. Previously, those containers were based on Alpine and Debian

29
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:33,120
predominantly, but now they've reworked it. So they're all based on SUSE Enterprise Linux.

30
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:39,440
And in addition to that, SUSE Rancher 2.6 also has added the SUSE Linux Enterprise base

31
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:44,680
container images. So think universal base images, a containerized subset of RHEL, but

32
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:48,960
for SUSE Linux Enterprise. And of course, because you got to have acronyms for all this

33
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:52,160
enterprise stuff. They're calling it the SLI BCI.

34
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:57,840
I'm not sure that name is really going to stick in my mind. But really, my question

35
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:05,720
is, what took them so long? At this point, Chris, I think you'd agree with so many management

36
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:12,520
platforms out there now. The real issue facing IT teams isn't really, can they find something

37
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:17,240
that works to manage Kubernetes? But really, it's determining the best way to manage a

38
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:23,160
multi cloud, maybe with some on premises components, and a whole bunch of solutions that you've

39
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:28,000
already deployed in production, you need something that's going to work with all of that. And

40
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:33,480
really, SUSE Rancher is known for solving that problem. With 2.6, they're investing

41
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:35,880
even more into that strategy.

42
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:41,080
Well, sticking in the container space for one more story, it seems that Docker Inc has

43
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:45,640
managed to piss off more of their commercial users this week, the company has announced

44
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:52,080
that their free plan is now a quote, personal plan and requires the businesses with 250

45
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:57,720
or more employees. Or if that business earns more than 10 million in annual revenue, it

46
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:02,560
must pay a subscription if they require the use of Docker desktop.

47
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:07,840
And they very well might if they're using Docker on a Mac or a Windows machine. Now,

48
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:14,880
there are no changes to the command line Docker engine, but that only runs on Linux. In addition

49
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:21,380
to that new personal plan, there's also a $5 per month pro plan, and a $7 per month

50
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:28,520
team subscription. Both of those are left unchanged. There's also a new $21 per month

51
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:34,360
business subscription that adds centralized management, single sign on and quote, enhanced

52
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:41,440
security. That's $21 per user. And I can see that adding up really quick. I mean, at that

53
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:46,600
price, you might as well start swapping people over to desktop Linux and save money. Sadly,

54
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:51,080
this is truly the forever story of Docker Inc. And I do mean sadly, how the hell are

55
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:54,500
they going to make money? It seems to be the perpetual question and watching the way they've

56
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:58,960
just jerked around Mac and Windows users over this last year alone, it, well, it's starting

57
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:01,760
to look pretty desperate over there at Docker.

58
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:08,160
And speaking of growing a company based on an open source product, MongoDB just had a

59
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:14,360
rather impressive quarter. In a recent interview, their CEO also shared some new details about

60
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:15,360
their customer base.

61
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:19,720
So we have all types of customers, we now have 29,000 customers, we have some of the

62
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:27,000
largest brands in the world, people like Toyota, AT&T, Morgan Stanley, Verizon, etc, as well

63
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:32,200
as cutting edge startups and new breed companies like UiPath and DataRobot, who are building

64
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:35,760
their business on top of MongoDB. And that's what you're seeing in our results. It was

65
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:37,440
the best quarter we've had to date.

66
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:42,840
And it appears the US government may be another potential source of growth for MongoDB. Their

67
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:47,080
database as a service product that we've talked about before called Atlas, just received a

68
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:53,120
new level of compliance approval for use in the US federal government. They already use

69
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:57,760
MongoDB on premises quite a bit. And it seems the US government is quite interested in the

70
00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:01,240
hosted solution from the company.

71
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:08,300
As the clock ticks towards December 31st, we watch and wait to see how the CentOS community

72
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:14,800
will handle the upcoming transition to stream. We know Red Hat won't support CentOS 8 past

73
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:21,120
the end of the year. But now, someone has stepped up to provide updates and support

74
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:28,780
till the end of 2025. Cloud Linux has announced it will provide those updates and much needed

75
00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:35,200
support for CentOS 8, giving users a new lifeline and more time to work out their plans.

76
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:39,560
This seems both good and bad to me, Wes. From a practical standpoint, it seems useful for

77
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:44,640
the market. No doubt many CentOS 8 users will want to take Cloud Linux up on this. That

78
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:50,800
just seems obvious to me. However, it also seems like it will slow adoption of both their

79
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:57,400
own Alma Linux alternative and CentOS stream, which ultimately, I suspect it just would

80
00:06:57,400 --> 00:07:03,040
have been better for the industry at large to just accept, adapt, and then transition

81
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:05,880
to.

82
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:11,920
We've been keeping an eye on the framework laptop, the modular machine with a big nod

83
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:17,120
to the right to repair. This week, they've posted specifics for getting the best results

84
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:23,640
with Linux on the hardware. They note it mostly comes down to driver support in the kernel,

85
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:28,260
with the relative newness of their Wi-Fi card being a particular challenge. They also point

86
00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:32,720
out that the Goodix-based fingerprint reader will require a newer kernel and at least version

87
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:37,860
1.92 of libfprint, which is the library for the fingerprint reader. Makes sense. But really,

88
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:42,800
you can just sum it all up by saying this. If you want to use Linux on a framework laptop,

89
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:49,720
come Linux kernel 512 or newer. Yeah, that's really it. They note just about everything

90
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:55,360
else works great with Linux out of the box, including those neat USB-C swappable hardware

91
00:07:55,360 --> 00:08:00,000
modules. Check the link in the show notes for more information on the framework Linux

92
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,560
community.

93
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:06,760
Linode.com slash LAN. Go there to get $100 in 60 day credit on your new account and you

94
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:12,280
go there to support the show, of course. Linode started in 2003 as one of the very first companies

95
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:16,800
in cloud computing. I mentioned that because I think one of the most common questions I

96
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:20,280
get, Wes and I got it this morning before we started recording the show. Hey, guys,

97
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:25,640
why should I choose Linode over XYZ provider? Because there are a lot of ways to host with

98
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:30,360
Linode and Wes responded with, well, I like the fact that Linode is independently owned.

99
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:34,720
You know, it's not some like crazy VC funded thing like they make money and they survive

100
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:38,020
on the merits of their product. And I was like, that's a good one. I like Linode because

101
00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:42,680
they're fast. And then that other stuff I learned about later, and I really appreciated

102
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:46,980
that. But what really made Linode stick with me is their speed and their performance. They

103
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:52,220
are their own ISP. They've got 11 data centers around the world. They have a brilliant interface

104
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:55,880
to let you manage all of this. And then the systems themselves would really matter. Our

105
00:08:55,880 --> 00:09:01,440
screamers, they're really fast. Linode has really just been focused on making cloud computing

106
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:07,180
accessible, affordable and high performance since 2003. That's 18 years of dialing this

107
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:11,720
thing in. So when you ask me, what's different about Linode? Well, it's everything that would

108
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:17,000
come from focus like that and from being independently owned and having a true love for the underlying

109
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:21,040
technology. That's what's different about Linode. That's why I stick with them. That's

110
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:25,720
why I'm comfortable running my business platform on Linode. And honestly, it's really the best

111
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:29,600
in class experience from the best customer support in the business to the interface to

112
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:34,400
the UI to everything down at a technical level. And then I really appreciate all of the little

113
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:39,400
extras that they have, like their S3 compatible object storage, cloud firewalls, VLAN support,

114
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:44,520
their powerful DNS manager, and ultimately their support for the community for projects

115
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:48,880
and open source. And of course, for things like this here humble podcast, there's so

116
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:51,880
much you could learn. There's so much you could try. So that's why they're giving you

117
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:58,480
$100 in 60 day credit. But you got to go to linode.com slash land that does a few things.

118
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:02,240
It lets them know you heard about it here. It says, Hey, it is worth your time and money

119
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:07,280
investing in the Linux action news. It also gives you that $100 credit. And it lets you

120
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:11,640
try things out like maybe go install Iperf on Linode and install it on another machine

121
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:15,720
on your end and do some performance testing there. Go try out a distribution you've never

122
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:20,680
played around with and take advantage of the fact that you got snapshots. Yeah, I mean,

123
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:24,480
I do. I'll spin up something on the node, just to avoid having to spin something up

124
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:28,960
in a VM on my laptop to make it warm. Because really, it's so quick. It's so simple. I can

125
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:33,520
deploy the entire base stack in like one click, or I can do a whole DIY setup if that's how

126
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:38,440
I prefer. You just got to get started. So go get that $100 credit today. Sign up at

127
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:46,520
linode.com slash lamb linux.ting.com. Have you heard the word? No, it's not the bird.

128
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:51,640
It's ting. Let's go see how much you could save right now and take 25 bucks off of that.

129
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:56,840
linux.ting.com. The trick is they're an MVNO or a mobile virtual network operator. That

130
00:10:56,840 --> 00:11:00,840
means Ting customers get access to all the big carrier networks, the ones you heard of,

131
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:04,920
the nationwide coast to coast coverage that you look at on the coverage maps, you get

132
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:11,800
access to that. But you just pay less. That's why I've been a Ting customer since 2013.

133
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:16,000
They've stayed flexible with me when I'm on the road. They've got great plans. And I love

134
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,360
their new plans. They make it great for an individual, a family or a small business.

135
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:23,760
I like to mention the set 12 because I think that really hits the sweet spot. Go check

136
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:28,160
that one out. They got a whole bunch. Get started at linux.ting.com. But set 12 gives

137
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:34,640
you 12 gigs of data and unlimited talk and text for 35 bucks a month. How nice is that?

138
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:38,600
You just don't even have to worry about it. I mean, you sync your music and your podcast

139
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:42,360
while you're on Wi Fi and you're pretty much good to go. But if you use two gigs or you

140
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:46,520
use 20 gigs, there's a Ting plan for you. And every plan gets access to Ting's award

141
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:51,360
winning customer service with nationwide LTE and 5g coverage. It's simple to switch to

142
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:55,160
Ting. Pretty much any phone will work. So just head to linux.ting.com. Check your current

143
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:58,840
phone, create an account and pick the plan that's right for you. Once everything checks

144
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:01,720
out, Ting will just send you a SIM card in the mail. You pop that in your phone and you

145
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:06,260
get activated in minutes and they've got a nice clean process for all of it. And while

146
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:10,280
you're there, go check out the Ting blog. They often are doing giveaways or helping

147
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:13,760
with tips on battery life. There's a lot you can learn just from their blog. It's something

148
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:17,480
that I've read for years now. So cut your current phone bill in half. It's never been

149
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:22,100
easier with Ting's brand new plans. It is truly the next generation of Ting mobile.

150
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:30,400
It's here and go see how much you could save and then take 25 bucks off that. Linux.ting.com.

151
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:35,260
Just a couple of quick stories to round us out today. We've got to get Chris out of here

152
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:42,460
before he melts. It's actually over 100 degrees Fahrenheit in his recording spot right now.

153
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:48,360
So first, it seems the RISC-V platform might be getting a boost from a rather unlikely

154
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:56,040
source. Apple is exploring using the open source alternative to ARM CPUs in future devices,

155
00:12:56,040 --> 00:13:00,380
at least according to a recent job posting. Yeah, the job posting is rather revealing

156
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:05,800
and I would expect to see Apple use this for IoT type devices, you know, dongles and their

157
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:11,040
home pod type gadgets. In fact, a few of Apple's cables like the lightning to headphone cable

158
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:15,520
actually have tiny, tiny ARM computers in them doing digital to analog conversions already.

159
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:20,400
Yeah, that makes sense. And maybe this way there'll be a few fewer ARM license fees to

160
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:28,040
pay. And while we're speaking of Apple hardware, the much anticipated IOMMU driver required

161
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:35,240
for PCIe, Wi-Fi, USB, display support and almost everything else on the M1 platform

162
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:42,120
has finally been merged upstream by Linus into the upcoming 5.15 kernel. This is a huge

163
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:47,560
milestone, Wes. This is huge. It's now being merged by Linus and this is a lot of what

164
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:52,120
it takes to get Linux running on an M1. And let's not forget how great it is to that this

165
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:58,160
is landing upstream. It's not like some crazy fork of Linux. Obviously, GPU support is still

166
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:03,360
a big, maybe the biggest hurdle, but we're already seeing progress steadily be made in

167
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:08,960
that direction, too. But speaking of things landing in Linux 5.15, one of the earliest

168
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:17,320
pull requests sent in for 5.15 was KSMBD, an in-kernel SMB3 file server developed by

169
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:24,480
Samsung. Now, KSMBD isn't designed to replace our beloved Samba. Instead, it's focusing

170
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:30,120
on delivering really fast SMB3 file server performance and also supporting some interesting

171
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:36,360
features that can be far more easily implemented in kernel space. Things like RDMA support

172
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:41,840
for SMB Direct, which can help offload some of the SMB workload to supported network cards.

173
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:45,880
Not just that, Wes, but also they said this is just going to work better for some Linux

174
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:50,420
workloads on smaller devices that need to host files. What I was mostly curious about

175
00:14:50,420 --> 00:14:56,360
is will they integrate with the existing Samba user tools? And it appears they will, at least

176
00:14:56,360 --> 00:15:00,840
they say, where appropriate. And the Samsung developers have worked with the Samba team

177
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:04,780
to make sure that some of the configuration files work right, things like extended attributes

178
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:10,520
are supported and compatible. And really, I never thought this was actually going to

179
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:16,200
get merged. I never thought Linus would merge a file server into the kernel. But when we

180
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:20,880
read through this in some workloads, I start thinking to myself, yeah, actually, I could

181
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:25,120
see myself using this. So maybe I'm actually glad to see it land.

182
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:30,360
You know, I didn't expect it either. But if you do use it, make sure you've got a firewall.

183
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:34,040
That's a great point, Wes, like how many Android devices is going to get installed on from

184
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:38,760
Samsung that are just connected to an LTE network all the time or a 5g network? I'll

185
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:42,440
tell you what, though, when 515 ships, I think we're going to be pretty tempted to try it

186
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:46,760
