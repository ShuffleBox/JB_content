00:00.000 --> 00:16.340
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, our weekly take on Linux and the open source world.

00:16.340 --> 00:20.780
This is episode 77, recorded on October 28th, 2018.

00:20.780 --> 00:21.780
I'm Chris.

00:21.780 --> 00:22.780
And I'm Joe.

00:22.780 --> 00:23.780
Hello, Joe.

00:23.780 --> 00:27.640
It is great to be connected with you on episode 77 of the show.

00:27.640 --> 00:33.600
We have major stories to get into, and let's start with one that I am elated to announce.

00:33.600 --> 00:35.680
Linus is back in charge of the kernel.

00:35.680 --> 00:42.520
Yeah, Greg KH has posted the 4.19 kernel and said, right, with that, then back to you,

00:42.520 --> 00:43.520
Linus.

00:43.520 --> 00:44.520
Yeah.

00:44.520 --> 00:45.520
All right.

00:45.520 --> 00:46.520
All done.

00:46.520 --> 00:47.520
Actually, he had a really good post.

00:47.520 --> 00:50.240
I mean, these things are typically pretty brief when you're doing a release, like here's

00:50.240 --> 00:53.200
the new stuff and have at it.

00:53.200 --> 00:57.920
But this time, he took a moment when he knew everybody would be watching, and he wrote

00:57.920 --> 01:00.020
out a great post.

01:00.020 --> 01:01.760
And he talked a little bit about the past few months.

01:01.760 --> 01:06.500
He says, this is a quote from his mailing list, post, the last few months have been

01:06.500 --> 01:11.400
a tough one for our community, as it's our community that is fighting from within itself,

01:11.400 --> 01:14.280
with prodding from others outside of it.

01:14.280 --> 01:18.180
Don't fall into the cycle of arguing about those others.

01:18.180 --> 01:22.600
That is the trap that countless communities have fallen into over the centuries.

01:22.600 --> 01:24.020
We share the same goal.

01:24.020 --> 01:26.280
Let us never lose sight of that.

01:26.280 --> 01:28.520
So here is my plea to everyone out there.

01:28.520 --> 01:33.600
Let us take a day off or two, rest, relax with friends by sharing a meal, recharge,

01:33.600 --> 01:36.700
and then get back to work to help continue to create the system that the world has never

01:36.700 --> 01:39.580
seen the likes of together.

01:39.580 --> 01:43.600
And then towards the end, he says, and with that, Linus, I'm handing the kernel tree back

01:43.600 --> 01:44.600
to you.

01:44.600 --> 01:47.840
You can have the joy of dealing with the merge window.

01:47.840 --> 01:51.080
Did you see the interview that Swapnil did with the two of them?

01:51.080 --> 01:52.080
No, I didn't see that.

01:52.080 --> 01:53.520
It was really interesting, actually.

01:53.520 --> 01:57.880
It was at the Open Source Summit Europe in Edinburgh this week.

01:57.880 --> 01:59.680
And it was a really good chat that he had with them.

01:59.680 --> 02:06.800
And what really came across to me was that they just care about the technicalities of

02:06.800 --> 02:07.800
it.

02:07.800 --> 02:09.200
They were really getting into the details of everything.

02:09.200 --> 02:12.600
And they kind of touched on the politics side of things.

02:12.600 --> 02:18.400
But it just seems to me that they don't care, Linus and Greg, about that stuff.

02:18.400 --> 02:22.400
They do obviously want things to run smoothly.

02:22.400 --> 02:26.880
And we know that Linus has got this email filter now that he's talked about.

02:26.880 --> 02:31.760
But he really wants to just concentrate on making the best bit of software possible.

02:31.760 --> 02:35.200
And that seems to be all he's ever really cared about.

02:35.200 --> 02:36.800
You know, I might check that out.

02:36.800 --> 02:41.120
I would agree that when I had the opportunity to chat with Greg, or when I've just read

02:41.120 --> 02:45.560
the mailing list, their focus really is the technical details of how to build a kernel.

02:45.560 --> 02:50.000
And that may be why they kind of took a while to get around to a code of conduct.

02:50.000 --> 02:51.400
That's not what their focus was.

02:51.400 --> 02:55.080
Either way, it's good to see Linus back in action.

02:55.080 --> 02:59.080
And all eyes are on Linus now.

02:59.080 --> 03:04.400
His first correction of a patch has already made news since he's been back in the captain's

03:04.400 --> 03:05.400
chair.

03:05.400 --> 03:10.640
It's already across all the news sites about quoting Linus, about how he responded to a

03:10.640 --> 03:14.000
patch request, and how it compares to previous responses.

03:14.000 --> 03:15.720
And the whole analysis has already begun.

03:15.720 --> 03:16.720
And it's been one day.

03:16.720 --> 03:17.720
Yeah.

03:17.720 --> 03:21.440
And if you actually look at what he wrote in that email, it was very calm, wasn't it?

03:21.440 --> 03:28.000
It was very much about technical details and no kind of ad hominems or any of that.

03:28.000 --> 03:30.280
He's delivered on his promise, at least so far.

03:30.280 --> 03:32.920
It's not been very long, but fingers crossed.

03:32.920 --> 03:35.000
It was still classic Linus, though.

03:35.000 --> 03:39.120
There's a dig in there about how all developers want their kernel modules to be on by default

03:39.120 --> 03:40.120
at boot.

03:40.120 --> 03:41.880
And there's a couple of moments in there.

03:41.880 --> 03:46.760
It's not mean, but it's still, he's very clear about why this isn't okay and what the technical

03:46.760 --> 03:47.760
mistake was.

03:47.760 --> 03:52.840
I also read an interview that he did at that summit, and he was asked about the eBPF stuff

03:52.840 --> 03:53.840
in the kernel.

03:53.840 --> 03:55.760
And he was kind of broadly positive about that.

03:55.760 --> 04:00.660
This eBPF stuff is going to represent a massive change in the way developers can interact

04:00.660 --> 04:02.440
with the kernel and build tools.

04:02.440 --> 04:05.200
BPF probably sounds familiar, the Berkeley Packet Filter.

04:05.200 --> 04:06.800
It's something that PF Sense has built in.

04:06.800 --> 04:07.800
The BSDs have it.

04:07.800 --> 04:08.800
It's great.

04:08.800 --> 04:13.720
And it's helped them create a really powerful packet filter.

04:13.720 --> 04:15.940
That wasn't good enough, though, for the Linux camp.

04:15.940 --> 04:22.080
They're implementing eBPF, extended BPF, which is building on top of a virtual machine that

04:22.080 --> 04:26.760
accepts bytecode inside the kernel, which can be used to create incredible tools.

04:26.760 --> 04:31.520
If you use something like TCP dump, you're already using eBPF, and you just didn't know

04:31.520 --> 04:32.520
it.

04:32.520 --> 04:38.360
We did an expansive coverage of eBPF and the tools that it can create, how you can use

04:38.360 --> 04:39.360
it today.

04:39.360 --> 04:42.360
And even hardware that's being built around this new technology.

04:42.360 --> 04:43.360
It's episode 388.

04:43.360 --> 04:49.080
You go to techsnap.systems.com and yeah, I think the kernel developers are excited about

04:49.080 --> 04:53.480
it because it's been around for about four years in the core kernel.

04:53.480 --> 04:57.800
But we're just now starting to see really cool tools being built around it.

04:57.800 --> 04:59.880
And so it's getting a lot of attention.

04:59.880 --> 05:03.160
And the kernel developers are starting to talk about it more and more.

05:03.160 --> 05:04.880
And that's what drew our attention to it.

05:04.880 --> 05:06.500
That's why we made that TechSnap episode.

05:06.500 --> 05:07.760
It's really awesome.

05:07.760 --> 05:11.480
Yeah, and don't tell him listeners, but I got paid to listen to that twice and I would

05:11.480 --> 05:14.400
have done it for free.

05:14.400 --> 05:15.400
You know what, Joe?

05:15.400 --> 05:16.400
It was worth it.

05:16.400 --> 05:17.400
You're a good editor.

05:17.400 --> 05:20.040
Yeah, so TechSnap.systems.com if you want to see that.

05:20.040 --> 05:23.600
And that's the kind of stuff, though, going back to your point about them being excited

05:23.600 --> 05:26.040
about the technical details of the kernel.

05:26.040 --> 05:27.640
That's the kind of stuff that shows it.

05:27.640 --> 05:30.040
They really enjoy that stuff.

05:30.040 --> 05:34.440
And it's pretty awesome to see that passion after all of these years.

05:34.440 --> 05:36.460
And it feels good to have Linus back.

05:36.460 --> 05:40.080
And so far, it seems like it was a productive absence.

05:40.080 --> 05:44.800
Yeah, and one of the best things that I took from these interviews was them treating this

05:44.800 --> 05:47.560
code of conduct as a last resort.

05:47.560 --> 05:50.960
And that they're moving forward, they've got that in place.

05:50.960 --> 05:53.140
And it's not going to be something that's used all the time.

05:53.140 --> 05:59.880
It's just there as a kind of safety net for if the other procedures and protocols fall

05:59.880 --> 06:00.880
down.

06:00.880 --> 06:03.120
And if there are serious problems, then they'll go back to that.

06:03.120 --> 06:07.560
So my fears have been completely laid by the interviews that I've seen and read over the

06:07.560 --> 06:08.560
last week.

06:08.560 --> 06:13.640
Well, your fears about Google may be allayed soon, too, at least if Pine64 is successful.

06:13.640 --> 06:18.280
Yeah, Pine64, who are well known for their various single-board computers that look a

06:18.280 --> 06:21.960
little bit like Raspberry Pis, but are generally more powerful, I think.

06:21.960 --> 06:26.520
And of course, the Pinebook, which I have paid for and am waiting to be dispatched anytime

06:26.520 --> 06:27.520
soon.

06:27.520 --> 06:30.640
So hopefully, I'll have an update on that soon.

06:30.640 --> 06:35.180
And they are planning to make a phone now and a tablet, by the looks of things, both

06:35.180 --> 06:37.960
of which will be based on plasma mobile.

06:37.960 --> 06:40.960
Hey, hey, hey, I love hearing that.

06:40.960 --> 06:45.400
This is also another story out of the Open Source Summit Europe edition.

06:45.400 --> 06:49.620
And tip of the hat to Itz Foss for going out there and getting this story directly from

06:49.620 --> 06:53.260
Jonathan Riddle, the main man behind KDE Neon.

06:53.260 --> 06:59.180
And it appears that Itz Foss also contacted the Pine64 team and got confirmation from

06:59.180 --> 07:01.440
them as well that they're working on these plans.

07:01.440 --> 07:05.360
So we have confirmation from Pine64 and Jonathan Riddle.

07:05.360 --> 07:06.640
Something's in the works here.

07:06.640 --> 07:08.520
Yeah, stress in the works.

07:08.520 --> 07:09.520
This is not available yet.

07:09.520 --> 07:13.880
It's not even pre-order time, but it's kind of build the hype time.

07:13.880 --> 07:16.240
And I'm on board with that hype, man.

07:16.240 --> 07:17.280
This sounds amazing.

07:17.280 --> 07:18.520
There was a line in there.

07:18.520 --> 07:23.920
Itz Foss asked why they don't have the Librem 5 on display at their booth.

07:23.920 --> 07:28.560
And Jonathan said that the Librem has been more focused on GNOME than KDE.

07:28.560 --> 07:33.240
And so they felt like going with Pine, it sounds like, if you read between the lines,

07:33.240 --> 07:38.120
was a better direction to go than plan on the Librem 5.

07:38.120 --> 07:40.280
It's kind of what I grok from that.

07:40.280 --> 07:42.460
Well, that's one way to look at it.

07:42.460 --> 07:45.920
Another way is why not both?

07:45.920 --> 07:49.880
And that's kind of how the Librem 5 is.

07:49.880 --> 07:51.440
Why not both on that?

07:51.440 --> 07:55.200
You have to concentrate on one more than the other to some extent.

07:55.200 --> 07:59.620
And it looks like Purism are going to be focusing almost completely on GNOME, but they're going

07:59.620 --> 08:02.600
to have this plasma mobile option.

08:02.600 --> 08:08.200
And so it kind of makes sense that if various hardware makers are looking to build a phone

08:08.200 --> 08:12.400
that's free software, why not work with everyone?

08:12.400 --> 08:16.760
Having the Pine folks involved has really piqued my interest in a way that maybe another

08:16.760 --> 08:19.200
hardware vendor would not have.

08:19.200 --> 08:23.160
And you could end up seeing a bit of a Pine platform develop here, because you'll have

08:23.160 --> 08:28.560
the phone, a tablet, of course, you'll have the Pine book, or you could just get yourself

08:28.560 --> 08:32.200
the Pine A64 board and use that.

08:32.200 --> 08:35.160
And those are around 15, 20 US greenbacks.

08:35.160 --> 08:41.800
I mean, you have a really low cost platform where plasma is going to be a first class

08:41.800 --> 08:42.800
citizen.

08:42.800 --> 08:43.800
I don't know.

08:43.800 --> 08:47.720
Maybe my plasma fanboy is shining a little too brightly here, but I think this is a very

08:47.720 --> 08:49.360
exciting development.

08:49.360 --> 08:53.920
And I don't expect it to make billions, but I do expect it to provide lots of fun entertainment

08:53.920 --> 08:54.920
for myself.

08:54.920 --> 08:56.700
And that makes me happy.

08:56.700 --> 09:01.400
One word of warning, though, is take their prices with something of a pinch of salt,

09:01.400 --> 09:04.840
because the Pine book is supposed to be $99, right?

09:04.840 --> 09:06.480
It's this amazingly cheap laptop.

09:06.480 --> 09:08.020
OK, it's ARM based.

09:08.020 --> 09:09.020
It's not super powerful.

09:09.020 --> 09:12.040
It's only got like a couple of gigs of RAM or whatever.

09:12.040 --> 09:13.040
But it's $99.

09:13.040 --> 09:14.040
Well, hmm, asterisk.

09:14.040 --> 09:21.920
By the time you've paid for shipping to the UK, I paid $138.99, including shipping.

09:21.920 --> 09:24.080
And that doesn't include import taxes.

09:24.080 --> 09:31.040
So I'm expecting it to be somewhere around $175, $200-ish by the time I get it, which

09:31.040 --> 09:32.040
is still cheap.

09:32.040 --> 09:34.540
But just be aware of that.

09:34.540 --> 09:40.160
They tend to not put the shipping costs up front, which is a little bit disingenuous.

09:40.160 --> 09:41.760
But I still want this to happen.

09:41.760 --> 09:45.840
And I still want to get my Pinebook, which I ordered quite a while ago, to be honest.

09:45.840 --> 09:47.240
But I understand they're a small company.

09:47.240 --> 09:49.880
They need to get the order together and everything.

09:49.880 --> 09:54.600
But I don't think we'll be seeing this before the Librem 5, put it that way.

09:54.600 --> 09:57.280
But I'm happy to be surprised on that one.

09:57.280 --> 10:03.240
Well, maybe you should save your crypto for HTC's blockchain phone, although not quite

10:03.240 --> 10:04.840
what was originally promised.

10:04.840 --> 10:06.280
Yeah, talk about hype.

10:06.280 --> 10:12.000
This is a phone that you can pre-order, but only using either Bitcoin or Ether.

10:12.000 --> 10:13.480
I love it.

10:13.480 --> 10:17.120
Yeah, which is a bit strange, really, because then they never know exactly how much money

10:17.120 --> 10:18.440
they're going to get for it.

10:18.440 --> 10:19.840
Because it's quite expensive, isn't it?

10:19.840 --> 10:20.840
Well, I don't know, Joe.

10:20.840 --> 10:23.120
It depends on how much of a Bitcoin baller you are.

10:23.120 --> 10:29.640
Because right now, depending on the price of Bitcoin, it's selling for 0.15 Bitcoin,

10:29.640 --> 10:30.680
which actually is a ton of money.

10:30.680 --> 10:33.400
That's about nearly $1,000 US dollars.

10:33.400 --> 10:38.120
Yeah, which most phones are about that these days, to be fair, like any sort of iPhone

10:38.120 --> 10:42.080
or high-end Samsung or Pixel or whatever.

10:42.080 --> 10:45.040
And this is, you know, it's no slouch, is it?

10:45.040 --> 10:50.440
Six gigs of RAM, 128 gigs of storage, Snapdragon 845.

10:50.440 --> 10:53.080
This is pretty much flagship territory, isn't it?

10:53.080 --> 10:56.000
So that's about the right price, I would say.

10:56.000 --> 10:57.840
Well, certainly market price.

10:57.840 --> 11:00.960
Maybe the whole market's a bit inflated at the moment.

11:00.960 --> 11:06.440
Yeah, it's expensive, but it could be a lot cheaper in a couple of days, couldn't it,

11:06.440 --> 11:07.440
with the way Bitcoin goes.

11:07.440 --> 11:08.440
Yeah, I suppose.

11:08.440 --> 11:10.920
Maybe they'll just adjust the price upwards, though.

11:10.920 --> 11:13.760
So what makes it a quote-unquote blockchain phone?

11:13.760 --> 11:18.120
I mean, they had all these ideas about using it for Bitcoin trading and whatnot and having

11:18.120 --> 11:20.380
a secure crypto wallet.

11:20.380 --> 11:21.920
But here's what they ended up with.

11:21.920 --> 11:24.300
And I suppose in a sense, this isn't bad.

11:24.300 --> 11:28.020
But it's not really necessarily dependent on a phone.

11:28.020 --> 11:29.520
It's implemented at the app level.

11:29.520 --> 11:36.040
HTC made a social key recovery mechanism in case you lose your phone and get stolen, etc.

11:36.040 --> 11:39.420
And you're able to keep the recovery details with a few trustworthy friends.

11:39.420 --> 11:41.680
You can spread it out amongst them.

11:41.680 --> 11:44.200
And then they have to download an app to manage your key.

11:44.200 --> 11:49.200
Hey, that's just great right there, asking people to install a random HTC app for you.

11:49.200 --> 11:55.400
And then HTC then uses a secret sharing algorithm, direct quote, to send the info to your friends,

11:55.400 --> 11:57.840
which then you can piece together if needed.

11:57.840 --> 12:01.200
Because it's stored out in a distributed personal blockchain, you see.

12:01.200 --> 12:02.800
So it's a blockchain phone.

12:02.800 --> 12:06.680
And the phone's also being opened up to third-party developers if they want to make an app based

12:06.680 --> 12:08.880
on the similar back-end technology.

12:08.880 --> 12:10.760
So that's why it's a blockchain phone.

12:10.760 --> 12:12.000
We didn't mention the name of it.

12:12.000 --> 12:13.360
It's called the Exodus.

12:13.360 --> 12:16.840
It's almost like the headlines write themselves, isn't it, when this doesn't do very well.

12:16.840 --> 12:18.000
Yeah, you're right about this.

12:18.000 --> 12:23.360
And then, of course, expect the followed headline, blockchain technologies are failing.

12:23.360 --> 12:24.360
Yeah.

12:24.360 --> 12:26.060
Well, we'll see.

12:26.060 --> 12:29.000
We might be surprised, but I doubt it.

12:29.000 --> 12:35.200
A very few select Firefox users may have a little surprise in their hamburger menu soon.

12:35.200 --> 12:38.960
Yeah, it might be recommending that you sign up for ProtonVPN.

12:38.960 --> 12:44.120
So if you're out and about at a coffee shop or whatever using unsecure Wi-Fi, and you

12:44.120 --> 12:49.280
could use a VPN, then a randomly selected, very small number of Firefox users will get

12:49.280 --> 12:55.680
this pop-up, this suggestion, saying, hey, sign up for ProtonVPN for $10 a month.

12:55.680 --> 12:58.160
And then you'll be all secure and everything.

12:58.160 --> 13:00.840
And oh, yeah, Mozilla's going to get a bit of a kickback from it.

13:00.840 --> 13:02.800
But yeah, that's fair enough, right?

13:02.800 --> 13:03.800
Advertising in your browser.

13:03.800 --> 13:04.800
OK.

13:04.800 --> 13:06.800
So does this bother you, Joe?

13:06.800 --> 13:08.800
Because it seems like this might bother you a little bit.

13:08.800 --> 13:12.000
I mean, they've got to make a living making that browser, right?

13:12.000 --> 13:14.340
Well, I really don't know how to feel about this.

13:14.340 --> 13:19.280
Because on the one hand, it feels a bit dirty for them to put adverts in their browser.

13:19.280 --> 13:22.700
But then they have to keep going.

13:22.700 --> 13:25.020
And the Google money is going to dry up.

13:25.020 --> 13:26.340
We've been talking about this for ages.

13:26.340 --> 13:30.980
The main revenue stream for Mozilla is the Google search money.

13:30.980 --> 13:35.160
And that's a bit weird and has been for a long time, because Firefox is this direct

13:35.160 --> 13:37.240
competitor to Chrome.

13:37.240 --> 13:41.680
And so Google could pull the plug at any point, potentially.

13:41.680 --> 13:46.440
Now, you do have to also consider that they did get quite a lot of money out of Yahoo,

13:46.440 --> 13:48.160
over a billion dollars.

13:48.160 --> 13:49.400
You do love to bring that up.

13:49.400 --> 13:53.840
Well, you know, a billion dollars is not an insignificant figure, is it?

13:53.840 --> 13:58.840
Both the company who Yahoo now is, basically, are looking to challenge that and not pay

13:58.840 --> 13:59.840
up.

13:59.840 --> 14:04.960
So you can kind of see why they want to diversify their revenue streams, for want of a better

14:04.960 --> 14:05.960
phrase.

14:05.960 --> 14:06.960
So here's their pitch, though, Joe.

14:06.960 --> 14:11.520
They say, we've examined each vendor's privacy and data retention policies to ensure they

14:11.520 --> 14:14.520
log as little user data as possible.

14:14.520 --> 14:20.040
And we also considered numerous other factors, including local privacy laws, company track

14:20.040 --> 14:25.400
record, their transparency, and quality of support as a result of this evaluation.

14:25.400 --> 14:29.040
Mozilla has selected ProtonVPN for this experiment.

14:29.040 --> 14:33.920
What they're telling you is, look, end user, we know picking a VPN is hard.

14:33.920 --> 14:38.920
So we went through all of the options, whittled it down to ProtonVPN, and hey, they're based

14:38.920 --> 14:39.920
out of Switzerland.

14:39.920 --> 14:41.080
Isn't that swell?

14:41.080 --> 14:43.200
So we think this is the one you should use.

14:43.200 --> 14:47.760
And we're going to just go ahead and make life easier for you and just put a button

14:47.760 --> 14:51.440
in your hamburger menu where you can sign up right here now.

14:51.440 --> 14:54.760
And to be fair, ProtonMail is what they're mostly known for.

14:54.760 --> 14:59.920
I've never heard anything but good things from the audience and people in the community.

14:59.920 --> 15:01.300
Everyone has always said that's great.

15:01.300 --> 15:03.080
It does seem like they picked a good one.

15:03.080 --> 15:04.840
Well, I hope so, yeah.

15:04.840 --> 15:07.760
I think overall, this is a valuable test.

15:07.760 --> 15:12.820
First of all, it's like they stress several times, a very small percentage of the Firefox

15:12.820 --> 15:18.680
user base, but also maybe this is the kind of thing that Mozilla should be doing.

15:18.680 --> 15:21.700
They have a bit of trust here with end users, and that's why people are using their web

15:21.700 --> 15:23.280
browser.

15:23.280 --> 15:27.760
And this issue of who's a safe VPN provider, who's not going to just hand over all of my

15:27.760 --> 15:33.700
records to some IP enforcement cop when they come knocking or whatever the case may be,

15:33.700 --> 15:36.520
people have these issues, these questions.

15:36.520 --> 15:38.920
And you can trust Mozilla to a degree here, I think.

15:38.920 --> 15:42.320
I believe them when they say they went through and vetted a bunch of different ones.

15:42.320 --> 15:46.400
I'm sure the one that was willing to work with them and give them a cut also played

15:46.400 --> 15:49.200
a factor here, but I believe them.

15:49.200 --> 15:52.640
And that may be a valuable service they're providing to end users now.

15:52.640 --> 15:57.360
And if they get two bucks out of 10 bucks a month, I kind of like that too, because

15:57.360 --> 15:59.000
I want Mozilla to keep on going.

15:59.000 --> 16:01.200
And I don't want them to be hooked to the Google sauce.

16:01.200 --> 16:04.920
My understanding is it's significantly more than $2, but either way, they're still making

16:04.920 --> 16:06.720
a fair bit of revenue here.

16:06.720 --> 16:13.200
And you're right, I'd much rather trust an organization like Mozilla than any other similarly

16:13.200 --> 16:21.040
sized or bigger tech giant, because they seem to have kind of decent founding principles.

16:21.040 --> 16:23.200
They're not all about maximizing profits.

16:23.200 --> 16:27.640
Yeah, they're all about making enough revenue to keep going and self-sustain and everything,

16:27.640 --> 16:31.120
but they're not this big evil corporation, are they?

16:31.120 --> 16:33.080
Yeah, I think there's a degree of that.

16:33.080 --> 16:37.400
And also, I just fundamentally trust their motivations for making a web browser, and

16:37.400 --> 16:40.560
they line up with my intentions.

16:40.560 --> 16:44.600
So at the end of the day, that's why I kind of have the most trust for Mozilla, even regardless

16:44.600 --> 16:45.600
of their size.

16:45.600 --> 16:46.600
Yeah.

16:46.600 --> 16:52.300
Well, speaking of Yahoo's billion, Red Hat became a billion dollar company back in 2012.

16:52.300 --> 16:57.440
And today, IBM is announcing that they are acquiring Red Hat for $34 billion.

16:57.440 --> 16:58.440
Wow.

16:58.440 --> 17:01.260
That's all I can say to that.

17:01.260 --> 17:02.260
This is huge.

17:02.260 --> 17:03.720
This is simply huge news.

17:03.720 --> 17:07.920
And Jim Whitehurst, the president and CEO of Red Hat, wrote, joining forces with IBM

17:07.920 --> 17:12.520
will provide us a greater level of scale, resources, and capabilities to accelerate

17:12.520 --> 17:17.680
the impact of open source as the basis for the digital transformation and bring Red Hat

17:17.680 --> 17:19.960
to an even wider audience.

17:19.960 --> 17:24.840
Now he also says they're going to preserve their unique culture, and that IBM is going

17:24.840 --> 17:29.320
to operate Red Hat as essentially a arms reach sub-corporation.

17:29.320 --> 17:31.320
Do you buy that?

17:31.320 --> 17:33.840
Well, that's what you would say, wouldn't you?

17:33.840 --> 17:34.840
Yeah.

17:34.840 --> 17:35.840
I suppose you would.

17:35.840 --> 17:37.880
It's certainly going to be the case for a while.

17:37.880 --> 17:42.400
But how long that will be, I don't know, really.

17:42.400 --> 17:46.360
I mean, my initial reaction to this was, well, at least it's not Microsoft.

17:46.360 --> 17:47.360
Hmm.

17:47.360 --> 17:49.200
You know, that is interesting.

17:49.200 --> 17:53.840
My first thought was, I wonder if there was a bidding race and Microsoft was in the contending.

17:53.840 --> 17:58.720
A lot of times when it breaks like this, you learn after the fact that several companies

17:58.720 --> 18:03.880
were in the bidding process, and you do have to kind of wonder if that was going on here.

18:03.880 --> 18:08.320
What strikes me about this is this would have been a good purchase for Microsoft, because

18:08.320 --> 18:14.720
in this press release and how IBM's already talking about it, it's all 100% cloud.

18:14.720 --> 18:20.160
This is a direct quote from IBM's chairman, the acquisition of Red Hat is a game changer.

18:20.160 --> 18:23.660
It changes everything about the cloud market.

18:23.660 --> 18:24.940
This is all about the cloud.

18:24.940 --> 18:25.940
It's not about desktop.

18:25.940 --> 18:29.400
You know, so this would have been right in their Azure wheelhouse.

18:29.400 --> 18:34.720
But as somebody who does keep an eye on the desktop, I do wonder what this means long

18:34.720 --> 18:37.240
term for the Fedora project.

18:37.240 --> 18:40.320
I'm talking in two years, or even CentOS.

18:40.320 --> 18:43.120
What does this mean long term for those freebies from Red Hat?

18:43.120 --> 18:45.360
Well, I don't think two years is long term here.

18:45.360 --> 18:48.880
I think in two years, we won't see any difference at all.

18:48.880 --> 18:54.020
I think maybe five to 10 years is when we'll start seeing a potential difference here.

18:54.020 --> 18:57.280
But the thing is that it's an open source company, isn't it?

18:57.280 --> 19:02.040
It's a fundamentally open source company, Red Hat, that has been acquired here.

19:02.040 --> 19:11.320
And if you start making changes to the culture of that, then it's not worth buying in the

19:11.320 --> 19:12.400
first place, is it?

19:12.400 --> 19:14.400
What they're buying is an open source culture.

19:14.400 --> 19:17.960
And okay, it's a very profitable open source culture.

19:17.960 --> 19:23.680
But if they just kick that out and start saying, there's no more free versions, there's no

19:23.680 --> 19:28.360
more Fedora, there's no more CentOS, and start cracking down on things like Scientific or

19:28.360 --> 19:33.600
whatever, that's just going to be such bad PR for them that why did they bother in the

19:33.600 --> 19:34.600
first place?

19:34.600 --> 19:39.080
People will move away from them to things like SUSE and Ubuntu.

19:39.080 --> 19:40.080
Yeah.

19:40.080 --> 19:47.140
And I think CentOS and Scientific and Fedora play an important in the door role.

19:47.140 --> 19:51.960
You always heard Adobe knows that there's a percentage of Photoshop that gets pirated,

19:51.960 --> 19:55.880
and they're actually okay with that, because then they have another stat that shows them

19:55.880 --> 19:59.560
a percentage of those users end up just buying the software, and it's like a pre-sales tool

19:59.560 --> 20:00.560
for a lot of them.

20:00.560 --> 20:03.600
Yeah, it might be five or 10 years down the road after they've finished being a student

20:03.600 --> 20:05.680
or whatever, but yeah, eventually it pays off.

20:05.680 --> 20:11.040
I think the other thing you have to ask when a big, big announcement like this first hits

20:11.040 --> 20:16.460
and you're trying to figure out how to process it, is the new owner going to be a better

20:16.460 --> 20:19.440
owner of the old things?

20:19.440 --> 20:22.240
And I think the question here is, will IBM be a better owner?

20:22.240 --> 20:25.440
Will they be a better steward of Red Hat's technologies?

20:25.440 --> 20:27.760
Now you got to give IBM credit in this space.

20:27.760 --> 20:30.600
For years now, they have been very pro-Linux.

20:30.600 --> 20:34.940
They have probably been responsible for some of the largest enterprise Linux deployments

20:34.940 --> 20:37.880
in history, and they did those commercials that were pretty great.

20:37.880 --> 20:40.020
People I'm sure remember those.

20:40.020 --> 20:41.880
So there could have been a worse company here.

20:41.880 --> 20:45.060
I mean, I'm not saying it was going to be Oracle, but it could have been a company like

20:45.060 --> 20:47.900
Oracle here, you know?

20:47.900 --> 20:48.900
Maybe not.

20:48.900 --> 20:49.900
It's a bit old, but.

20:49.900 --> 20:53.440
It's funny, you say a worse company and mention Oracle, okay, that's probably the worst it

20:53.440 --> 20:59.360
could have been, but I can think of one on a par with Microsoft that seemed very likely

20:59.360 --> 21:00.360
to me, Amazon.

21:00.360 --> 21:02.960
Oh, I thought you were going to say Google.

21:02.960 --> 21:05.760
Yeah, I guess so, right, because of all that AWS.

21:05.760 --> 21:10.840
Well, yeah, and the fact that Amazon Linux is based on Red Hat, it kind of makes sense,

21:10.840 --> 21:11.840
doesn't it?

21:11.840 --> 21:12.840
Yeah, you're right.

21:12.840 --> 21:15.860
Ooh, I would love to know if there's a bidding war here, because I totally could see Amazon

21:15.860 --> 21:16.860
in the mix too.

21:16.860 --> 21:22.400
I could see Amazon, Microsoft, and Google, and IBM, of course, all bidding.

21:22.400 --> 21:23.400
Absolutely.

21:23.400 --> 21:27.480
And I'll tell you, the industry take here is that out of the group, IBM has the best

21:27.480 --> 21:32.400
sales team, and that that's been an area that Red Hat's been okay in, but could have been

21:32.400 --> 21:37.040
doing better, and that's where IBM could take things to the next level.

21:37.040 --> 21:40.760
So what do you think the feeling inside the Red Hat camp is now that this news is broken?

21:40.760 --> 21:44.640
Well, I've heard from a few that it's bad.

21:44.640 --> 21:49.840
That the big concern is that they do have a very unique culture, and that that culture

21:49.840 --> 21:52.040
could be damaged.

21:52.040 --> 21:56.540
End of days could be described as some of the feelings that are being expressed.

21:56.540 --> 21:59.080
But I can't speak for everybody, who really knows?

21:59.080 --> 22:01.240
I think most of them are just processing this.

22:01.240 --> 22:06.040
I think the corporation is going to have a big old company-wide meeting to have a talk

22:06.040 --> 22:08.240
about this, because this is happening on a Sunday.

22:08.240 --> 22:10.960
I don't think that was the intention.

22:10.960 --> 22:15.880
But earlier today, the news started to leak, Reuters and Bloomberg had rumors, it started

22:15.880 --> 22:20.280
to spread over Reddit and Twitter, and so they just decided to leap on it before they

22:20.280 --> 22:23.280
had a chance to send around the company-wide email.

22:23.280 --> 22:26.980
So put yourself in their position for a moment, a Red Hat employee's position.

22:26.980 --> 22:31.280
You're browsing your Sunday Twitter, and you see that your company's been bought.

22:31.280 --> 22:32.500
What kind of revelation is that?

22:32.500 --> 22:37.440
And then the email comes in saying that we're being acquired.

22:37.440 --> 22:40.400
That must be one heck of a Sunday.

22:40.400 --> 22:45.760
Yeah, you'd think that there'd be procedures in place, that your immediate manager or whatever,

22:45.760 --> 22:47.520
or they'd be in all hands.

22:47.520 --> 22:52.200
You don't want to hear this stuff on Twitter, it must be very alarming for them.

22:52.200 --> 22:54.440
They just don't really have much information.

22:54.440 --> 23:01.840
You would hope that on Monday, when the meeting happens, and when people are actually at work

23:01.840 --> 23:06.600
talking to their colleagues, and they have some more clarity on this, that things won't

23:06.600 --> 23:14.060
feel as bad for them, because like them or not, Red Hat are the poster child for making

23:14.060 --> 23:15.400
money with open source.

23:15.400 --> 23:19.920
They're pretty much all we have in terms of making serious money.

23:19.920 --> 23:22.520
Joe, allow me to interject for just a second here.

23:22.520 --> 23:26.040
What you're referring to as Red Hat is actually now known as IBM.

23:26.040 --> 23:28.760
They're the leaders in making money.

23:28.760 --> 23:31.820
It does kind of make me wonder if Canonical is next.

23:31.820 --> 23:35.680
If you were going to ask me to make a prediction, I would have said Canonical is going to get

23:35.680 --> 23:37.680
bought first.

23:37.680 --> 23:39.400
So now what?

23:39.400 --> 23:43.800
Because that's a massive behemoth for Canonical to try to sell against.

23:43.800 --> 23:49.120
Well, we've seen SUSE get bought and now Red Hat, so who else is left?

23:49.120 --> 23:50.120
Well we just won't know, Joe.

23:50.120 --> 23:52.300
We'll just have to keep watching the news and report it here.

23:52.300 --> 23:57.320
You can get the latest, including the developments of this IBM purchasing Red Hat story, and

23:57.320 --> 24:01.760
if anything major breaks between now and Linux Unplugged, we'll cover it there too.

24:01.760 --> 24:04.840
But in the meantime, just to make sure you're getting it every single week, and getting

24:04.840 --> 24:10.120
that analysis, go to linuxactionnews.com slash subscribe for all of the ways to get new episodes.

24:10.120 --> 24:13.840
And go to linuxactionnews.com slash contact for ways to get in touch.

24:13.840 --> 24:18.040
And we'll be back next Monday with our weekly take on the latest Linux and open source news.

24:18.040 --> 24:20.280
I am at Chris LAS.

24:20.280 --> 24:21.880
I'm at Joel Ressington.

24:21.880 --> 24:25.040
Thank you for joining us, and we will see you next week.

24:25.040 --> 24:40.040
Bye for now, see you later.
