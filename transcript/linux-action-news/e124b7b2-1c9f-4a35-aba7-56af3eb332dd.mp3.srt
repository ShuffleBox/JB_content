00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,480
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, episode one, two, three, recorded on September 15th,

2
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:09,480
2019.

3
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:10,480
I'm Chris.

4
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:11,480
And I'm Joe.

5
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:12,480
Hello, Joe.

6
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:14,440
I didn't upset you with that introduction, did I?

7
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:15,440
A little bit.

8
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:16,440
It should be 123.

9
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:17,440
I know.

10
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:18,440
I know.

11
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:19,440
I just, I had to do it.

12
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:23,240
Well, we start out with some great news for users of the GNOME desktop.

13
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:25,860
Version 3.34 is released.

14
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:28,080
And this is all about performance, it seems.

15
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:29,080
Yeah.

16
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:34,400
It's got some last minute mutter patches that made it in just under the wire, as they say,

17
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:36,880
as if there is such a thing in open source development.

18
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:43,240
And it introduces some nice performance improvements in just sort of basic animation things.

19
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:47,000
And some areas that turns out were just a minor correction.

20
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,720
In one case, Joe, they were using GPU acceleration for a certain task.

21
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:57,340
And it turned out that the CPU overhead to execute on the GPU was pretty considerable.

22
00:00:57,340 --> 00:01:02,340
And so by just taking it back to the CPU, they saved a ton of time and increased performance.

23
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:06,600
Small tweaks now, some of which are coming right out of Canonical now that they're using

24
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:08,920
the GNOME desktop as their default desktop.

25
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:11,680
Yeah, I was talking to Will about that on late night Linux.

26
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:14,320
And he said that it's amazing.

27
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:18,440
It's night and day between 18.04 and 19.10.

28
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:24,480
I haven't made the upgrade myself, but I've been using some patches from upstream on my

29
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:26,800
current GNOME installation.

30
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:28,400
And I've noticed an improvement.

31
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,280
So it is really good.

32
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:34,820
And when you have this now as the primary quote unquote enterprise desktop, seeing these

33
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:38,880
kinds of performance improvements benefits more than just one distribution.

34
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:41,620
This is something that benefits a lot of users now.

35
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:46,500
It doesn't address some of the core concerns I have about GNOME's fundamentals.

36
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:49,240
But it's great for what we have right now.

37
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:53,540
And on top of these performance improvements, there's simple, nice quality of life improvements

38
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:54,720
that are also landing.

39
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:59,440
GNOME 3.34 introduced a custom folders area in the applications overview.

40
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:02,880
So sort of like on a smartphone, how you can drop things inside a folder.

41
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:05,620
You can now do that in the application overview.

42
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:11,100
And Sysprof is making performance profiling of applications on the GNOME desktop even

43
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:12,240
easier.

44
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:16,880
And there's also multiple improvements to Builder, which include an integrated D-Bus

45
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:17,880
inspector.

46
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:21,560
All in all, though, this is telling a story that this is becoming an even more mature

47
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:25,240
platform for developers, and a more mature platform for power users.

48
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:27,520
Well, I actually did try this out.

49
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:32,480
I installed Xubuntu 19.10, the daily image a couple of weeks ago, and I've been keeping

50
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:33,480
that up to date.

51
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:37,760
And I thought, well, why not just install the Ubuntu session on top of that, and then

52
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:38,760
logged into it.

53
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:42,840
And I don't know, it's just GNOME, I just can't get on with it.

54
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:46,660
But I did notice on my little Vivo book that really isn't very powerful, that it was very

55
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:48,720
smooth with the animations and everything.

56
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:52,600
And it did feel faster than the last time I checked it out.

57
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:57,720
But it's still just too fancy, too many animations, just not like a proper desktop enough for

58
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:58,720
me, I'm afraid.

59
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:02,920
Oh, yeah, all that polish is just, it's so frustrating.

60
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:07,960
Well, yeah, the promotional video talks about how it's animation centric and everything.

61
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:09,520
It's just not for me.

62
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:11,080
But this is our flagship desktop.

63
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:14,040
It's default on Ubuntu and Fedora.

64
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:18,360
So it's important to get those things like the animations working really smoothly, because

65
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:20,520
most people actually like that stuff.

66
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:24,840
I take your point with the animations, because you convinced me to really tone it way down

67
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:26,540
on my Android device.

68
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:30,480
And I feel like that's made it perceptibly faster to me.

69
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:35,520
And I've wondered why I haven't been compelled to turn off the animations on my iPhone, when

70
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:39,680
I find it to be a net enhancement on Android, but I don't find it to be a net enhancement

71
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:40,680
on iOS.

72
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:45,640
In fact, they're, even for my taste, they're a little too, they're too long, the animations

73
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:50,320
coming in and out of folders and closing applications and the application switchers, it could be

74
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:51,320
a little bit faster.

75
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:54,160
And I've wondered why I've turned them off for a little bit, and then I've turned them

76
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:56,020
back on.

77
00:03:56,020 --> 00:04:00,020
And what I realized, it's sort of the same with GNOME versus Plasma for me.

78
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:04,420
In GNOME Shell, the animations provide context.

79
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:10,440
The applications overview and the way the windows open and close provide sort of a hint

80
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:12,160
of functionality, what's happening.

81
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:16,260
They give me a context of awareness on my desktop.

82
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:20,680
On Plasma, I can turn it way too far, where things are just animated like crazy, and there's

83
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:22,360
no real rhyme or reason.

84
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:24,840
It's not a particular flow.

85
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:26,540
It's kind of the same thing on iOS.

86
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:30,740
When you close or open an application, they zoom in and out of the icon.

87
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:35,420
They give you spatial awareness of where that's at, and there's a utility to it.

88
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:39,620
And so when the animations provide functionality, utility, or even if they're just subconsciously

89
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:44,520
giving me cues on how to navigate my UI, I find them useful.

90
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:48,200
And when they're more candy, they're just extras that are just all over the place, no

91
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:51,840
real rhyme or reason, over time, I just tend to turn them all off.

92
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:55,200
I might try them for a bit, but then I turn them all off.

93
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:57,860
And GNOME Shell's really struck that balance for me.

94
00:04:57,860 --> 00:05:00,920
The animations are minor.

95
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:02,120
They're in the right place.

96
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:03,440
They're smooth now.

97
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:06,440
They don't seem like they detract from the experience.

98
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:10,880
They provide some level of context to the experience, so I really like it.

99
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:16,280
I'm still using XFCE on my workstation here in the studio, still using Plasma in the actual

100
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:24,540
recording area, but on my laptop, I've switched over to GNOME Shell on Wayland because of

101
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:30,300
the smoothness and richness of the whole UI, in part because I find these animations actually

102
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:31,300
add to the experience.

103
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:35,720
Well, I get it, and I get why people are into it, but I'm just not, I'm afraid.

104
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:39,200
That's why there's more desktops than you can shake a stick at, Joe.

105
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,200
Indeed.

106
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:44,080
And if you're on a desktop that isn't GNOME and you want to update the firmware on your

107
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:50,120
device and you want to use a GUI for it, well, there's now a release of GNOME firmware, which

108
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:52,100
we talked about a couple of weeks ago, I think.

109
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:57,720
We did indeed, and to keep things fun, it's just arbitrarily being called 3.340 to celebrate

110
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:00,920
the new release of GNOME as well.

111
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:02,560
I think that's great.

112
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:06,680
It's just really kind of an indication this thing is ready to be used by end users.

113
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:10,360
It's not going to be installed by default, at least right now, but it is available right

114
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:11,360
now on Flat Hub.

115
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:16,540
I loaded it up, and I guess I've seen it in the screenshots, but one thing I didn't expect

116
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:22,120
when I put it in my actual system, it read all my hard drives and got all of their vendor

117
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:28,080
information, their BIOS or firmware, whatever you want to call it, what kind of steps I

118
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:30,600
have to take to do the updates to that particular device.

119
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:36,120
But I guess I was expecting more like my traditional BIOS and just sort of completely forgot that

120
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:40,000
my SSDs all have firmwares on them as well that need updating.

121
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,520
So it's a pretty nice project just in that sense.

122
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:44,480
You see a list of everything that's supported.

123
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:46,360
You get firmware information.

124
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:49,360
You get serial information, vendor information.

125
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:50,360
It's a really handy app.

126
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:52,960
Yeah, I tried it out, and it's very simple.

127
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:54,440
It's not much to it.

128
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:59,240
Unfortunately, the machine I tried it out on didn't have any devices that had any updates

129
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:03,840
available for them, so I wasn't able to fully try it out, but I do like the simplicity.

130
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:04,840
Did you flat pack it?

131
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:05,840
Yeah, I got it off Flathub.

132
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:06,840
Yeah.

133
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:07,840
It wasn't too bad, was it?

134
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:09,120
There's just a couple of commands to get it going.

135
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:13,600
Well, yeah, but on XFCE, it did have to download about 300 megabytes of stuff.

136
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:17,240
I don't even know what it was getting, but it worked.

137
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:18,240
Yeah.

138
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:22,480
I suppose you might have been missing some of the theme stuff.

139
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:28,840
Also I noticed this week that LVFS announced that Acer has joined the group, although it's

140
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:29,840
only one rig right now.

141
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:32,600
Yeah, but you have to start somewhere, and hopefully this is going to mean that there's

142
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:34,560
a bunch more machines coming soon.

143
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:38,320
Well, Joe, it's not quite dead yet.

144
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:43,520
Firefox is reintroducing the test pilot program that was shut down earlier.

145
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:48,200
Yeah, they shut it down back in January of this year, but they've resurrected it seemingly

146
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:50,680
as a way to try out their new VPN service.

147
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:51,680
Brilliant.

148
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:55,500
I think that's brilliant, because that's something people are interested in.

149
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:59,400
So why not relaunch this program with a hot commodity?

150
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:03,000
This has been a long, strange, twisted tale.

151
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:07,600
It originally started as an add-on, I think, more than three years ago, and then eventually

152
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:11,200
was baked into Firefox, and then, like Joe said, killed back in January.

153
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:15,560
On January 15th, they announced they were ending the program, and now they're relaunching

154
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:16,560
it.

155
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:22,120
They even write on their site, like a cat, the test pilot program has many lives.

156
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:27,560
And starting now with VPN, the Firefox Private Network, which is an extension that will provide

157
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:33,320
a secure, encrypted path to the web to protect your connection and your personal information

158
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:36,480
anywhere and everywhere that you use the Firefox browser, end quote.

159
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:40,640
Well, I'd be keen to give this a go for sure, but unfortunately, right now at least, it's

160
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:42,960
only available to Firefox users in the US.

161
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:45,960
Oh, don't worry, Joe, they want your money, too.

162
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:47,440
This is just the very beginning.

163
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:52,040
We don't have any information on what the eventual pricing will be or what other things

164
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:54,420
that they'll bundle in this whole little thing.

165
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:58,340
So I'm sure eventually, they'll get to you because they need everyone's money, Joe.

166
00:08:58,340 --> 00:08:59,340
They all do.

167
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:03,240
And I think, rumor has it, Mr. Westpain is giving this a go right now, so we may hear

168
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:05,200
from him how it's gone.

169
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:07,640
I think this is pretty smart.

170
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:08,960
Build this right in.

171
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:15,460
This is something that Mozilla can do much more flexibly than Google can do.

172
00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:19,540
It's something that Apple has zero interest in, so they're the major browser provider

173
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:22,080
that's best positioned to try something like this.

174
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:27,960
I also, time will tell, but right now, I trust the Mozilla brand, so if I was trying to pick

175
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:32,140
between VPN providers and I just wanted something to make sure that when I'm checking my bank

176
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:36,760
account at the coffee shop is secure, I would trust something built into Firefox, something

177
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:38,600
with Mozilla's name on it.

178
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:43,360
So I think it's pretty smart for them to try it, and don't worry, they'll get to everybody

179
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:44,360
soon.

180
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:49,760
He's using Cloudflare, though, and I've seen a bit of a negative reaction to that.

181
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:52,600
I don't think anybody likes centralization.

182
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:55,720
It's notable, too, this week that Cloudflare had their IPO.

183
00:09:55,720 --> 00:10:00,920
They rose 20% in the first day of trading on the public market, and I think on their

184
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:03,280
first day, ended at $18 a share.

185
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:08,560
So Cloudflare has a lot going on right now, including being closely connected with another

186
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:13,960
feature that Mozilla is rolling out to Firefox users in the US.

187
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:20,160
This month, DNS over HTTPS will begin turning on for some.

188
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:24,600
And once again, Mozilla have come in for a bit of criticism for partnering with Cloudflare,

189
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:30,560
because although with the DNS over HTTPS thing, you can change the provider, the default is

190
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:31,900
going to be Cloudflare.

191
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:36,480
When I dug around on this, Mozilla's response appears to be, Cloudflare is the only provider

192
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:39,200
that would agree to our privacy terms.

193
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,520
That's a hard answer to argue with.

194
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:45,000
I guess we have only Mozilla to trust in this.

195
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:49,600
Much like the VPN functionality, we're really putting our faith in Mozilla to do their due

196
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,520
diligence with Cloudflare.

197
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:55,560
For those of you that aren't familiar, and I probably do this for a little bit longer,

198
00:10:55,560 --> 00:11:04,060
DOE, or DNS over HTTPS, allows DNS requests to look like normal HTTPS traffic to special

199
00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:08,040
DOE compatible DNS servers that are called DOE resolvers.

200
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:14,920
Basically it hides DNS requests inside a normal deluge of HTTPS traffic over a network.

201
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:20,600
And that has the advantage of bypassing censorship, monitoring, keeping the requests secure, but

202
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:26,200
it also forfeits some of the advantages of DNS, like network-wide resolving and decentralization

203
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:27,640
of the protocol.

204
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:33,140
One thing I like to remind people in this whole DNS over HTTPS conversation, you have

205
00:11:33,140 --> 00:11:35,960
implementation and you have technology.

206
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:41,400
The implementation can be done wrong and you can have centralization and you can have monitoring

207
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:45,160
and you can have all kinds of awful things happen.

208
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:48,640
That doesn't mean the technology is necessarily flawed.

209
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:50,120
There's two separate issues here.

210
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:53,520
Yeah, Mozilla is actively working on the implementation of this.

211
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:57,640
They're making sure that it doesn't break parental controls, for example, and they're

212
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:59,560
taking on board some of the criticism.

213
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:01,320
Yeah, we'll see where this goes.

214
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:06,560
The old sysadmin in me is a little bothered by just ignoring the system DNS settings,

215
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:11,760
because often those are set specifically on an enterprise network in a very particular

216
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:12,760
way.

217
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:17,600
However, like you said, Mozilla is testing this and I'm not the only one that's concerned.

218
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:18,640
Others are concerned as well.

219
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:22,240
So we'll see this work itself out in the quote unquote marketplace.

220
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:28,680
But like an example, OpenBSD is going to ship their redistribution of Firefox with DOE turned

221
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:34,880
off because their view as a project is that all applications should respect the system

222
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:35,880
DNS settings.

223
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:36,880
Well, yeah.

224
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:41,320
And just because it's default doesn't mean that you as the administrator can't turn it

225
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:42,320
off.

226
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:46,360
And if you're controlling the machines in a whole enterprise and you are controlling

227
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:49,960
the DNS, then there's no reason why you can't just turn it off.

228
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:54,440
I also kind of feel like the genie's out of the bottle on this one.

229
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:57,920
Apps on phones are going to start implementing this.

230
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:01,360
And even Google is working on it with Chrome in version 78.

231
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:07,360
For a small group of users running Chrome 78, Google will run an experiment.

232
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:12,400
The checks of their DNS provider is part of a small list of known DOE compatible providers.

233
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:18,480
If your DNS provider is on that list, Chrome will automatically upgrade to DOE just in

234
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:19,540
the background.

235
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:24,120
So if you're using Google DNS or Cloudflare or OpenDNS, which are a couple of popular

236
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:28,760
ones, it may detect this and just start trying it and see how it works.

237
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:32,640
Yeah, it does feel like this is going to end up being default in all the browsers before

238
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:33,640
too long.

239
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:36,460
I also think messaging applications will be quick to adopt this.

240
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:38,000
Just picture something like Telegram.

241
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:42,360
If they have censorship issues at the state level, using something like DOE might help

242
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:45,460
bypass that censorship.

243
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:48,360
It could give people a voice in some cases.

244
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:54,640
There's a lot of pro-humanity arguments that can be made, as well as, oh my god, think

245
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:59,040
of the children arguments that can be made saying, well, you'll bypass parental filters.

246
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:01,920
You'll bypass social media filtering.

247
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:03,920
So this is going to be a fascinating one.

248
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:07,560
Well, in the short term, you wouldn't think that the next release of CentOS was going

249
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:09,740
to be hotly anticipated.

250
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:15,120
But even apparently the CentOS community gets pretty excited about the next big release.

251
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:18,320
And unfortunately, they're going to have to wait a little bit.

252
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:23,100
So Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 came out on May 7, 2019.

253
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:28,840
The moment that happens, everyone asked the question, when CentOS 8 shipping?

254
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:34,240
And as happened, CentOS users started complaining on the development mailing list, which kind

255
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:36,600
of felt like old times.

256
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:40,680
Back in the good old days when CentOS was like way behind a RHEL release, and there's

257
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:45,520
all kinds of responses in the thread, the traditional like people that get very upset

258
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:48,280
and then people that are very thankful for all the hard work.

259
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:51,400
There's some name calling in there, lots of back and forth.

260
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:57,320
But you eventually get to the nugget that the team just has limited time, limited resources.

261
00:14:57,320 --> 00:15:00,920
Which is a shame, given that Red Hat bought them, you think they would have given them

262
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:02,920
a few more people to work on it.

263
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:07,680
Is it a shame or is it a sign that they've taken sort of a hands off approach and they

264
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:11,160
let the project continue on its organic original path?

265
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:12,720
I don't know.

266
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:17,600
Maybe it's a good sign, but on the CentOS page on Wikipedia, there's a very handy table

267
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:24,280
that shows you the CentOS releases next to the RHEL releases and the delay in the number

268
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:25,280
of days.

269
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:29,720
And looking at them, it's usually around about a month, maybe a little bit more than that,

270
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:30,720
five or six weeks.

271
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:36,560
But you get to 7.7 of RHEL, which came out on the 6th of August, and that hasn't come

272
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:37,560
out yet.

273
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:40,600
So production is kind of due any day now.

274
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:46,400
And that is what's holding up CentOS 8 here, they need to get 7.7 out first.

275
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:53,360
But that seems to be a totally fair and understandable priority because you have many more users

276
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:56,560
that have CentOS 7.x in production.

277
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:58,080
No one has 8 in production.

278
00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:02,120
So take care of the users that are running the production OS right now.

279
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:08,240
And who uses something like CentOS and expects to have the latest and greatest the moment

280
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:09,240
it comes out?

281
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:12,800
Like that just seems completely opposite of what the expectations of the distro should

282
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:13,800
be.

283
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:16,920
It's supposed to be a slow-moving enterprise-grade distro.

284
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:17,920
Well, exactly.

285
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:20,080
Well, this isn't very enterprise, Joe.

286
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:26,860
But in terms of anticipated releases, the Pine64 folks blew my mind this week when they

287
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:34,240
tweeted a picture of the PineTime, a Linux-compatible smartphone companion.

288
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:36,000
They say it's a side project of theirs.

289
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,200
Yeah, I wasn't expecting this to be announced quite so soon.

290
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:43,240
I did know about it through my connection to Pine64.

291
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:46,800
But I wasn't expecting it to be so cheap as well.

292
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:50,000
And the reason that it's cheap is that it is very low spec.

293
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:55,860
We're not talking about an Android Wear-type device here that's going to run Linux.

294
00:16:55,860 --> 00:16:59,560
We're talking about something that's much more like the original Pebble, only instead

295
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:03,080
of the e-ink screen, it's going to have a touchscreen LCD.

296
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:07,640
But it's going to be running something like RTOS, something much, much lighter than Linux.

297
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:11,600
And so the feature set is going to be very much limited.

298
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:15,080
Limited might be okay, depending on what that limited feature set is.

299
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:17,200
Well, I'm really surprised by this.

300
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:19,520
We know just a little bit right now.

301
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:22,560
It seems that the watch will be made of a zinc alloy and plastic.

302
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:26,980
It'll come with a charging dock, a wristband, and a heart rate monitor.

303
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:31,000
And it said it could possibly last several days on a charge.

304
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,440
Development kits should be available in one to two months.

305
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:40,040
PineTime seems to be really similar to an existing fitness tracker that's sold on AliExpress.

306
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:43,080
But it appears this might be slightly nicer.

307
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:47,440
For example, this has a full touchscreen, whereas the AliExpress has just a one touch

308
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:52,180
button, as well as this may have firmware that is fully freeable.

309
00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:54,240
We don't really know quite yet.

310
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:58,960
But if it got some of the basic health tracking stuff right and reported them back to my OS

311
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:02,260
in a way that was usable, that'd really be the big tick.

312
00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:05,940
If you can tell time and do the health tracking stuff, I'm pretty much in.

313
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:10,300
I'd love to have a free, cheaper alternative to Fitbit that isn't tied to a cloud service

314
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:11,660
of any kind.

315
00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:13,400
This would be an easy $25 for me.

316
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:16,540
Well, I think we all need to not get carried away here.

317
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:21,560
Because how Pine64 does things is they make the hardware, and then they rely on the community

318
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:22,560
to make the software.

319
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:27,060
That's always been the case for all of their single board computers and the pine books

320
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:30,600
and the pine phone that's coming out.

321
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:36,280
This tweet was really just trying to generate a bit of buzz and see if anyone was interested

322
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:39,580
in collaborating with them to make this software.

323
00:18:39,580 --> 00:18:43,260
Because this is a very niche thing that we're talking about here.

324
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:46,480
We're not even talking about mobile Linux, we're talking about, as I said, something

325
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:48,680
like RTOS.

326
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:51,160
There aren't that many devs of that.

327
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:55,420
So this could not happen at all, potentially, if no one's interested in making the software

328
00:18:55,420 --> 00:18:56,420
for it.

329
00:18:56,420 --> 00:19:00,660
And even if they are, then you still need the companion apps to be written for the various

330
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:01,660
platforms.

331
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:05,820
And the idea of this is it's going to be a companion to things like Ubuntu Touch or post

332
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:09,280
market OS with plasma mobile on it.

333
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:11,860
It's not designed to be working with iOS and Android.

334
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:15,540
I mean, there's no reason why anyone couldn't make those apps for iOS and Android.

335
00:19:15,540 --> 00:19:19,740
I think it'd be easy with Android to publish the app, because you could do it in something

336
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:21,460
like F-Droid, for example.

337
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:25,500
But I think that we need to not get too excited about this.

338
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:28,780
It's not a finished product by any stretch of the imagination.

339
00:19:28,780 --> 00:19:30,500
Yeah, you're right.

340
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:31,580
Fair points all around.

341
00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:35,860
I think on the iOS and Android side, it would really be a matter of either figuring out

342
00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:39,720
how to A, integrate with HealthKit, or B, just adding support to an existing health

343
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:42,060
tracking app for this device.

344
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:46,860
So it may be more feasible than it seems initially for that aspect of it.

345
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:50,940
The reason why I think it's kind of clever, and it both makes me think that they're trying

346
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:55,060
to bite off more than they can chew, which we'll see, that's yet to be determined.

347
00:19:55,060 --> 00:20:00,220
But it also makes me think this is the area where we should be pushing.

348
00:20:00,220 --> 00:20:02,180
Smartphones are done.

349
00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:05,560
When I look at the Pine 64 phone, I think to myself, the Pine phone is going to be great

350
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:11,300
for individuals like yourself and I, who love to mess around with this kind of stuff, load

351
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:14,700
different firmwares, build tools out of them.

352
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:21,340
It's a real nice market to serve, but it's not going to compete with iPhones or LGs or

353
00:20:21,340 --> 00:20:22,340
Samsungs.

354
00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:23,700
It's never going to compete.

355
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:24,700
That's done.

356
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:27,260
The Pepsi and Coca-Cola of that world has been established.

357
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:32,580
You need ecosystems, you need developers, you need tons of marketing, you need deals

358
00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:36,460
with carriers, et cetera, et cetera.

359
00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:40,440
But wearables still seems really nascent.

360
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:43,700
You have the Apple Watch, and then you have everything else.

361
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:45,900
But everything else is a bit of a mix.

362
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:48,460
Fitbit seems to be doing pretty strong.

363
00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:52,860
Nothing's really grabbed hold of the Android wear market particularly strong.

364
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:54,460
But Fitbit seems to be decent.

365
00:20:54,460 --> 00:21:00,340
There's a couple of competitors out there, but there's still room to dominate the wearables

366
00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:05,580
market to offer something that's just a damn watch, but also contract your heart rate and

367
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:09,880
your steps and help you lose a few pounds.

368
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:11,580
That's the value of the Apple Watch.

369
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:15,300
That's why even when I'm carrying my Pixel 3, I still have my Apple Watch on my wrist.

370
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:18,500
Well, I don't think they're aiming for mass market adoption with this.

371
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:25,140
Having spoken to Lucas from Pine64 about it, it's pretty much ready to go, just needs the

372
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:26,140
software for it.

373
00:21:26,140 --> 00:21:30,300
The factory is ready to spin up and make them, but they just need the software.

374
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:34,140
That software is going to take a long time to come.

375
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:39,460
We're talking about next year, definitely, before this is a reality.

376
00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:44,380
Could you imagine a watch where the community could create different apps for health?

377
00:21:44,380 --> 00:21:49,100
I follow the sleep apnea community and their adventures in hacking their CPAP machines.

378
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:53,540
I wonder, could somebody make a sleep app for a watch designed specifically for those

379
00:21:53,540 --> 00:21:55,180
of us that have sleep apnea?

380
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:56,380
There's all kinds of possibilities.

381
00:21:56,380 --> 00:22:00,580
If we could just open the doors a little bit, it doesn't need to sell tens of millions.

382
00:22:00,580 --> 00:22:05,980
And also, Joe, what a statement does it make about how approachable this level of hardware

383
00:22:05,980 --> 00:22:06,980
is getting?

384
00:22:06,980 --> 00:22:09,900
It's going to be some performance monster.

385
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:15,060
But a watch that can run an operating system with wireless chips in it and heart tracking

386
00:22:15,060 --> 00:22:19,980
that can be sold for less than hundreds of dollars, it's just kind of a remarkable statement

387
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:21,980
about where hardware is at right now.

388
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:23,340
It is, yeah.

389
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:30,140
All I want is notifications on my wrist and security, something that's going to get patches

390
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:35,660
and when the next Blue Born or whatever it is comes along, it gets patched against that.

391
00:22:35,660 --> 00:22:39,300
Man, notifications on the wrist are the worst.

392
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:41,140
That's the worst thing.

393
00:22:41,140 --> 00:22:42,500
That's what I hate the most about my watch.

394
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:48,580
I actually spend a fair amount of effort making sure that only a certain kind of notifications

395
00:22:48,580 --> 00:22:52,500
get through my watch because it's a different level of intimacy.

396
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:57,060
They are vibrating something on your body that's attached to your arm.

397
00:22:57,060 --> 00:23:02,660
And so when somebody's sending you a stream of consciousness that's 15 messages long,

398
00:23:02,660 --> 00:23:05,420
that's 15 times that your arm will buzz.

399
00:23:05,420 --> 00:23:06,980
It just drives me nuts.

400
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:10,620
So I really, that's the one thing I hate about these watches is the notifications.

401
00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:16,100
Sorry, I better stop doing that then, sending you my streams of consciousness.

402
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:17,100
Actually you're pretty good at it.

403
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:20,180
I was just thinking this earlier today, I'm not kidding, I was thinking before the show

404
00:23:20,180 --> 00:23:23,760
you and I were having a chat and you put everything in one message and I was actually doing it

405
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:24,760
to you.

406
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:29,180
In fact, I even did a correction as a separate message instead of doing an edit, which I

407
00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:30,180
apologize.

408
00:23:30,180 --> 00:23:31,820
Yeah, I try and edit the message.

409
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:35,700
If someone hasn't read it, then I'll try and edit in all the extra stuff as I think about

410
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:38,220
it, rather than sending a bunch of extra messages.

411
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:41,020
It's kind of a polite thing to do, I think.

412
00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:42,020
It's the decent thing to do.

413
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:45,900
I try to do it too, but I was on a roll, Joe.

414
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:48,940
Well speaking of rolling, this show rolls right on.

And LinuxActionNews.com slash contact for ways to get in touch with us.

418
00:23:57,420 --> 00:23:59,420
Hey, we've got two big announcements.

419
00:23:59,420 --> 00:24:04,220
I'm very excited to say that Self Hosted has launched Self Hosted dot show.

420
00:24:04,220 --> 00:24:05,260
Go check that out.

421
00:24:05,260 --> 00:24:08,060
Episode one is out now.

422
00:24:08,060 --> 00:24:14,260
And Linux Headlines, brand new show from Jupiter broadcasting every single weekday.

423
00:24:14,260 --> 00:24:17,500
Just the news you need to know about in three minutes or less.

424
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:19,300
Linux Headlines dot show.

425
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:22,420
And being under three minutes means that it is just the headlines and the need to know

426
00:24:22,420 --> 00:24:23,420
details.

427
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:24,420
Our first week is out.

428
00:24:24,420 --> 00:24:29,860
We're just getting started, and it also makes for a great flash briefing on the Echo.

429
00:24:29,860 --> 00:24:31,220
Very proud of the team for launching that.

430
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:32,220
Go check it out.

431
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:35,820
We'll be back next Monday with our weekly take on the latest Linux and open source news.

432
00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:37,940
I am at Chris LAS.

433
00:24:37,940 --> 00:24:39,300
And I'm at Joe Rissington.

434
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:42,100
Thank you for joining us, and we will see you next week.

435
00:24:42,100 --> 00:25:00,420
Until then, have a great day, and we'll see you later.
