Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, our weekly take on Linux and the open source world.

00:16.640 --> 00:22.400
This is episode 86, recorded on December 21st, 2018. I'm Chris.

00:22.400 --> 00:23.400
And I'm Joe.

00:23.400 --> 00:29.720
Hello, Joe. It is finally here. Our annual predictions and, for the first time ever,

00:29.720 --> 00:35.480
look back at our former predictions, which I think we should just skip right over and

00:35.480 --> 00:37.320
not even talk about at all.

00:37.320 --> 00:40.360
Well, I've left the Bitcoin stuff till the end. So, yeah.

00:40.360 --> 00:44.320
Okay. All right. Well, then I think I can get through some of this. Maybe we should

00:44.320 --> 00:50.680
start with your first quote unquote prediction, which I don't think really came true.

00:50.680 --> 00:56.560
No, and listening back to this today, we were both dead certain that this was going to happen.

00:56.560 --> 01:03.760
And this was that Ubuntu Unity 7 would become an official flavor. And we just thought, oh,

01:03.760 --> 01:07.560
that's a dead cert. That's just a really easy one. But that hasn't really happened, has

01:07.560 --> 01:12.440
it? We've seen a few images. We've seen some work towards it. But there just doesn't seem

01:12.440 --> 01:19.160
to be enough momentum there to get even a project going properly, never mind an official

01:19.160 --> 01:25.780
flavor. And we both agreed that by 1810, it would be. But apparently, people are happy

01:25.780 --> 01:26.780
enough with GNOME.

01:26.780 --> 01:32.560
Yeah, I actually thought you were cheating a little bit with this one. That was such

01:32.560 --> 01:37.000
a gimme. Of course that's going to happen. I think in part because we were hearing from

01:37.000 --> 01:41.760
canonical employees that were trying to make that a thing. So it seemed natural that that

01:41.760 --> 01:46.760
would pan out. But I think the other thing that happened was they nailed the GNOME implementation.

01:46.760 --> 01:54.000
It's good. And by 1810, it's really good. And 1904, by all accounts, is looking really

01:54.000 --> 02:03.880
neat. So I think that was part of that whole Unity 7 will survive was some incorrect assumption

02:03.880 --> 02:08.000
that the GNOME Shell implementation would be trash. Just didn't pan out. And so the

02:08.000 --> 02:09.560
need just wasn't really there.

02:09.560 --> 02:15.000
Yeah. And of course, in Marte, you can make a fairly good approximation of Unity 7. And

02:15.000 --> 02:20.080
you can do it in Plasma as well. So if people were really wedded to that workflow, there

02:20.080 --> 02:27.040
are ways to get more or less that workflow with other desktops. And maybe people were

02:27.040 --> 02:32.960
just willing to do that. Or much more likely, as you say, just the GNOME implementation

02:32.960 --> 02:34.960
in Ubuntu was good enough.

02:34.960 --> 02:42.520
I missed the mark, though, on my prediction. I thought we'd have a massive botnet story.

02:42.520 --> 02:51.680
Just a cyber attack type story that was facilitated by a bunch of insecure Linux-powered, unfortunately,

02:51.680 --> 02:59.200
IoT devices. I thought it would at least be the largest area of attacks over 2018, mostly

02:59.200 --> 03:04.080
due to bad defaults. And in some ways, that did pan out. We saw routers really get abused

03:04.080 --> 03:11.160
this year. But the smart plugs, the toasters, we haven't really had that doomsday story

03:11.160 --> 03:14.080
that I thought we would have. So I'm going to mark that one as a miss.

03:14.080 --> 03:19.280
Well, you did also say Linux servers. And you were kind of half right in that we've

03:19.280 --> 03:24.200
had a lot of crypto miner attacks on Linux servers. So you were kind of almost right.

03:24.200 --> 03:29.760
But I think that's a bit of a stretch. So yeah, I think we're kind of both a bust on

03:29.760 --> 03:30.760
those two there.

03:30.760 --> 03:36.360
Well, OK. All right. How about your next one? I think you had a Microsoft prediction, I

03:36.360 --> 03:37.360
recall.

03:37.360 --> 03:43.360
Yeah, I said that Microsoft Linux, maybe called Azure Linux, would come out. And it would

03:43.360 --> 03:51.720
be their own cloud distro with tight windows, desktop integration, and basically that Microsoft

03:51.720 --> 03:57.120
would have a Linux distro. And I think I was more or less right. I wasn't quite right in

03:57.120 --> 04:00.360
the details. But they did put out a Linux distro, didn't they?

04:00.360 --> 04:07.340
Yeah. I mean, Azure Sphere OS is Linux-powered. And it's a cloud-connected Linux OS running

04:07.340 --> 04:13.480
on devices being sold by Microsoft this year. I mean, I think that counts, Joe. I think

04:13.480 --> 04:16.880
you get a win on that one. It's a close call, because I don't think it was exactly what

04:16.880 --> 04:19.360
you had in mind. But I think you win on a technicality.

04:19.360 --> 04:24.480
I think it was a bit more than a technicality. But either way, yeah, I'm claiming that as

04:24.480 --> 04:25.480
a win.

04:25.480 --> 04:33.640
I'm happy to report that my next one was also mostly a miss. In some ways, what I was watching

04:33.640 --> 04:40.480
was a storm a-brewing. Winter was coming to the open source community, and I didn't expect

04:40.480 --> 04:47.340
the best from us. But I think overall, mostly things turned out okay. I thought we'd see

04:47.340 --> 04:53.300
a huge gap between the idealist and the pragmatist. And I thought we'd see that really widen as

04:53.300 --> 04:59.820
you had people that were in that DevOps category or sysadmin category or web dev or whoever

04:59.820 --> 05:04.280
it is that is buying Sputnik laptops and buying these different machines and installing Linux

05:04.280 --> 05:11.080
on them and replicating production and development on their laptops. That stereotypical person

05:11.080 --> 05:14.080
now that's driving the adoption of Linux.

05:14.080 --> 05:19.320
My big fear was that there would become sort of a battle between those that were involved

05:19.320 --> 05:24.960
in Linux for the freedom aspects and those that were involved in Linux for the work aspects.

05:24.960 --> 05:29.620
And I thought as the people that were just using it as a work tool grew, that gap would

05:29.620 --> 05:35.600
become more and more polarized. And that really didn't seem to happen. We do definitely see

05:35.600 --> 05:40.720
more and more pragmatists using Linux as just a day to day work tool. And we see more and

05:40.720 --> 05:45.180
more different implementations of Linux across commercial operating systems like Windows

05:45.180 --> 05:49.840
and Chrome. But thankfully, there hasn't been that big community battle playing out in all

05:49.840 --> 05:55.620
of the different aspects of online communication. Yeah, it's there. It's always been there.

05:55.620 --> 06:01.040
But it didn't turn into the all full fledged holy war that I was expecting.

06:01.040 --> 06:08.960
I think the reason for that is that all the pragmatic stuff is additions to Linux. If

06:08.960 --> 06:14.680
you look at, for example, the Nvidia driver, you don't have to install that. I have got

06:14.680 --> 06:23.480
a PC that's running the Nuvo driver, for example, and I don't need to do any 3D stuff with it.

06:23.480 --> 06:29.300
And the card works perfectly well with Nuvo. And so it's running almost all free software.

06:29.300 --> 06:34.680
And so those pragmatists who have definitely grown in number, we've seen that this year,

06:34.680 --> 06:40.360
definitely, we've seen a big rise in that pragmatism. Take Fedora, for example, making

06:40.360 --> 06:45.200
it easy to install those proprietary drivers. And we've seen more and more people coming

06:45.200 --> 06:49.480
to Linux using it for things like gaming with Steam.

06:49.480 --> 06:54.640
Sure. I would argue the accelerated use of snaps, flat packs, and app images is also

06:54.640 --> 06:56.440
a bit of the pragmatists taking over.

06:56.440 --> 06:59.860
Yeah, definitely. And so you were kind of half right there. We have definitely seen

06:59.860 --> 07:05.480
more pragmatism and more pragmatists coming to the Linux world. But I think the people

07:05.480 --> 07:11.260
who are running Triskill or Debian with no proprietary stuff, they don't really care

07:11.260 --> 07:15.840
because that stuff still exists for them. And they just don't have these proprietary

07:15.840 --> 07:17.000
additions on top of it.

07:17.000 --> 07:21.200
Yeah, fair enough. Their territory didn't go away. It's just, like you said, all been

07:21.200 --> 07:24.200
in addition. We've just made room for everybody.

07:24.200 --> 07:30.240
Yeah, I think that it's ultimately better. I think that the free stuff does benefit from

07:30.240 --> 07:35.800
the pragmatists coming along because it's no good having the NVIDIA driver be really,

07:35.800 --> 07:42.200
really great if the rest of Wayland and whatever doesn't work very well. And so that kind of

07:42.200 --> 07:47.760
feeds into the free software development, makes that better, and then the purists and

07:47.760 --> 07:52.400
the free software people benefit as a result. So maybe that's also why there's not been

07:52.400 --> 07:53.400
this big backlash.

07:53.400 --> 07:58.480
Well, before we own up on the Bitcoin stuff, do you want to lay down a few 2019 predictions?

07:58.480 --> 08:03.240
Okay, my first one. Now, you have to bear in mind that people have been saying this

08:03.240 --> 08:09.240
for many years now. And I've been saying, no, it's not going to happen. And it hasn't

08:09.240 --> 08:14.480
happened so far. But I'm convinced that this year it will happen. And that is that Microsoft

08:14.480 --> 08:22.160
will buy at least a significant percentage share in Canonical. It just seems inevitable

08:22.160 --> 08:29.120
to me that I don't think they will kind of buy them out right. And we might not even

08:29.120 --> 08:36.400
hear about it because it is a private company. But I think they'd struggle to keep it quiet.

08:36.400 --> 08:41.120
And Shotworth said he was looking for investors before the IPO. And so I think that Microsoft

08:41.120 --> 08:45.000
is going to pony up and put some money into Canonical this year, a significant amount

08:45.000 --> 08:46.000
of money.

08:46.000 --> 08:48.840
So if you've been saying this isn't going to happen for years now, what is it about

08:48.840 --> 08:52.840
now that's changed your mind? Is it the IBM Red Hat sale?

08:52.840 --> 08:59.160
I think that has definitely played into it. And of course, SUSE was acquired this year.

08:59.160 --> 09:02.320
Yeah, and last year and the year before.

09:02.320 --> 09:08.440
Yeah, yeah. But it goes to show there is a market for these companies. And I think really

09:08.440 --> 09:12.680
what has changed my mind here is that Shotworth has cleaned house over the last sort of 18

09:12.680 --> 09:21.560
months and made Ubuntu and Canonical a profitable, leaner operation that is growing and making

09:21.560 --> 09:26.360
some money and innovating. And is actually quite an attractive proposition now for someone

09:26.360 --> 09:32.640
to buy. Whereas before, they had the phone stuff that was going nowhere in Unity 8. Whereas

09:32.640 --> 09:37.440
now it's much more streamlined. And it just seems much more valuable.

09:37.440 --> 09:43.300
Yeah. And with the Red Hat acquisition from IBM, there is less opportunity for Microsoft.

09:43.300 --> 09:48.400
And so they need to strike while there's still opportunity. And we know that this year, Azure

09:48.400 --> 09:55.400
crossed the 60% line for Linux. That's a massive number for Microsoft. And they seem to be

09:55.400 --> 10:01.360
willing to do whatever it takes to keep more people getting into Azure. I got to imagine

10:01.360 --> 10:04.920
they're looking at this at least. Maybe it won't happen. But I think it's a pretty solid

10:04.920 --> 10:09.880
prediction. And I like the hedge that you've made this year. And that is, it's at least

10:09.880 --> 10:16.320
a percentage. Because you're going to be right if they just invest. And you're going to be

10:16.320 --> 10:18.640
right if they buy them. So that's a safe one.

10:18.640 --> 10:24.320
Well, I'd say it's a significant percentage. I'm not talking 5%. I'm talking at least 20,

10:24.320 --> 10:25.320
25.

10:25.320 --> 10:30.880
Well, I've got one that I feel like is going to be a pain point for Linux users this year,

10:30.880 --> 10:35.040
especially for those in the iOS ecosystem that have an iPhone or an iPad and have a

10:35.040 --> 10:42.160
Linux box. I'm pretty positive that Apple will indeed launch a video streaming service.

10:42.160 --> 10:46.560
Original content, much like Netflix does, that's not going to work with Linux at all.

10:46.560 --> 10:51.960
And Linux users will be completely left out as if it was 1997 all over again. And the

10:51.960 --> 10:56.460
richest company, or at least the richest tech company in the world, continues to underdeliver

10:56.460 --> 10:57.920
for us Linux users.

10:57.920 --> 11:03.400
You have got some front, my friend, to say this. This is so obviously going to happen

11:03.400 --> 11:08.620
that I couldn't possibly have put it in. Apple are definitely going to launch a video streaming

11:08.620 --> 11:09.620
service.

11:09.620 --> 11:13.020
No, I think people listening to this show will be like, what? A Netflix competing streaming

11:13.020 --> 11:16.940
service? These guys are crazy. I don't think it's a foregone conclusion. Not until Uncle

11:16.940 --> 11:19.340
Tim's up on stage, Joe.

11:19.340 --> 11:23.760
Come on. We've read how many stories this year that they're working on it and how they're

11:23.760 --> 11:30.840
not going to have any swearing or nudity and it's going to struggle to compete.

11:30.840 --> 11:33.840
It's already struggling to compete before it's launched. I love it.

11:33.840 --> 11:40.560
Yeah, yeah. And the idea that this would possibly be available on Linux, well, OK, maybe via

11:40.560 --> 11:45.340
the browser. But you would imagine, I mean, you can't even watch the Apple launches on

11:45.340 --> 11:51.560
Linux, can you, in the browser? So yeah, I wouldn't be surprised at all. This, to me,

11:51.560 --> 11:56.440
is the easiest, definite prediction that I've ever heard.

11:56.440 --> 11:58.040
Easier than yours, huh? Hmm.

11:58.040 --> 12:02.260
Well, the Microsoft buying canonical, that could definitely not. I mean, Shuttleworth

12:02.260 --> 12:08.400
has said that he's looking to IPO. The official line is that they're not selling. And so no

12:08.400 --> 12:09.840
way. This is definitely happening.

12:09.840 --> 12:14.840
I wouldn't completely count Apple out. See, if you look at the divisions of Apple, they

12:14.840 --> 12:23.560
have Apple Music for Android. They just launched Apple Music for Alexa. Cancel. Cancel. Cancel.

12:23.560 --> 12:32.080
Stop. Thank you. So, you know, like they maybe there is it is it within the realm of possibility.

12:32.080 --> 12:35.680
But also within the realm of possibility is they never launch a streaming service. That's

12:35.680 --> 12:39.840
what I love about this prediction is it's it's got it's a full spectrum possibility

12:39.840 --> 12:40.840
here.

12:40.840 --> 12:45.400
They could, in theory, just make content and sell it on iTunes on demand that way without

12:45.400 --> 12:50.440
a proper streaming service. But no, they're definitely going to do it. And it's probably

12:50.440 --> 12:53.360
not going to work, at least very well on Linux.

12:53.360 --> 12:58.140
The only thing I think crazier than my prediction would be like some sort of prediction that

12:58.140 --> 13:02.160
like Linux gaming is going to take off or something.

13:02.160 --> 13:07.240
Well, that's my next prediction. And that is that Steam Linux market share will crack

13:07.240 --> 13:10.520
5%. It's under 1% right now.

13:10.520 --> 13:15.080
Yeah, it's 0.8. 0.8. You think you're going to go to 5% in one year?

13:15.080 --> 13:16.080
Yep.

13:16.080 --> 13:26.160
That's you're giving me a hard time. I mean, I just don't even see it. What's the Mac at?

13:26.160 --> 13:32.800
What is it? What is the Mac OS market share right now for Steam OS? Is it even above 10%?

13:32.800 --> 13:39.080
This is a bold prediction, Joe. Do you think Proton is going to be what fuels this meteoric

13:39.080 --> 13:41.000
rise in Linux gaming?

13:41.000 --> 13:47.160
Well, that's certainly part of it. But the bigger part of it is not that there's going

13:47.160 --> 13:54.860
to be loads more people running Steam on Linux. It's going to be fewer people running Steam

13:54.860 --> 14:02.120
on Windows because of the competition that is brewing. And that is Epic and their games

14:02.120 --> 14:08.240
store and also Discord and their game store, which are looking to undercut Steam. And so

14:08.240 --> 14:12.200
you're going to have a lot more titles going over there, potentially exclusives. And I

14:12.200 --> 14:18.240
think that Steam is going to lose its crown as the premium gaming platform. I think you're

14:18.240 --> 14:23.800
going to have a much more distributed three-way race. And as a result, you're going to lose

14:23.800 --> 14:29.980
the Windows users from Steam. And you'll also get more Linux users on Steam. I think that's

14:29.980 --> 14:32.600
going to settle out to be about 5%.

14:32.600 --> 14:38.800
Hmm, that's bold. I mean, right now I'm picturing a future where I'm sitting on my partially

14:38.800 --> 14:45.280
Microsoft-owned Ubuntu desktop watching my Apple streaming video while I download a Steam

14:45.280 --> 14:52.240
game where I'm nearly one of the five percenters on the platform. It seems nearly crazy, but

14:52.240 --> 14:59.800
not any crazier than my next prediction. And I want to make sure I'm very clear about this.

14:59.800 --> 15:05.120
I don't think this is going to be a final product. This may be only beta or even maybe

15:05.120 --> 15:11.080
pre-release. I don't know what they're going to call it. But I believe this year, in some

15:11.080 --> 15:16.600
form or another, maybe preview, maybe beta, Microsoft will launch Office as an Electron

15:16.600 --> 15:24.540
app. Maybe just to like Office 365 subscribers. Maybe it's only a small preview or a beta.

15:24.540 --> 15:31.080
But my thought process has really been over 2018, looking at what Microsoft has done.

15:31.080 --> 15:37.040
When they acquired GitHub, they also acquired Electron. When they announced the transition

15:37.040 --> 15:44.900
from Edge HTML to Chromium, they also announced making Windows a really, really first-class

15:44.900 --> 15:52.920
Electron platform. And they own Electron and they can make contributions to Chromium.

15:52.920 --> 15:57.040
They have the potential to build something really significant. And if you look at some

15:57.040 --> 16:02.680
of their more recent products, like the new version of Skype and other things, VS Code,

16:02.680 --> 16:10.260
etc., they're Electron based. I think we could see a truly cross-platform Office 365 desktop

16:10.260 --> 16:15.680
style application, something along this line. Maybe it's just Word, but it's an Office style

16:15.680 --> 16:21.680
application that is released as an Electron app by Microsoft. Maybe it's preview in 2019.

16:21.680 --> 16:27.080
I can't disagree with any of that. That seems very likely to me. I think that we'll even

16:27.080 --> 16:31.880
get to a point where we've got a snap of it as well. I think it'll run across basically

16:31.880 --> 16:37.680
all Linux distributions or at least most of them. As soon as you said that, I thought,

16:37.680 --> 16:41.240
yeah, I'm fully on board with that prediction. I can totally see that happening.

16:41.240 --> 16:45.540
You can kind of look back at some of their recent moves over 2018 and see them lining

16:45.540 --> 16:50.700
up behind Electron. And having a couple of conversations with a couple of different developers

16:50.700 --> 16:55.260
down there, I've been told about a couple of different in-house projects that are Electron

16:55.260 --> 16:58.520
based that we're like, what? You've got to be kidding me. You guys are working with Electron

16:58.520 --> 17:02.320
on that? Yeah, we're doing these things. I don't want to say who or what. I know that's

17:02.320 --> 17:08.360
very vague, but it sort of changed my perspective on what Microsoft would be willing to ship.

17:08.360 --> 17:13.180
And when we look at Skype and VS Code, I think we see those things individually, and we don't

17:13.180 --> 17:18.780
really take into account that they're essentially Electron applications. And we don't appreciate

17:18.780 --> 17:24.840
how sometimes companies can test the waters and trial balloon things with some products

17:24.840 --> 17:29.400
before they move their most treasured product to a new platform.

17:29.400 --> 17:34.400
And I suspect, based on the conversations I've had, that that's what Microsoft's been

17:34.400 --> 17:39.800
doing for the last couple of years. And this final drop of Internet Explorer and Edge,

17:39.800 --> 17:47.040
which is a 20-year legacy and a move over to Chromium, is such a significant change

17:47.040 --> 17:52.440
that the only thing that would make them truly willing to drop that 20-year heritage and

17:52.440 --> 17:59.960
make a new shift like that would be to serve a bigger goal long term, like making Windows

17:59.960 --> 18:05.080
one of the best platforms to run desktop Electron applications, which to us probably sounds

18:05.080 --> 18:09.080
horrible, but to the business world is absolutely necessary.

18:09.080 --> 18:12.920
Yeah, and just because they'll be the best experience on Windows doesn't mean that they

18:12.920 --> 18:17.000
won't work on the other platforms. Yeah. So we should hopefully benefit. I hope so. We

18:17.000 --> 18:19.640
should, well, if running Office can be considered a benefit.

18:19.640 --> 18:24.720
Yeah, and Electron applications. At least we have them.

18:24.720 --> 18:29.040
Yeah. Right. Well, you can't filibuster this anymore. We have to get into Bitcoin.

18:29.040 --> 18:31.040
All right. All right.

18:31.040 --> 18:39.000
So we had our predicted highs, lows, and the price on the 1st of December 2018. It's worth

18:39.000 --> 18:46.000
mentioning that when we recorded this, it was before the crash, basically. It was...

18:46.000 --> 18:52.080
We recorded a bit earlier than we are this time, didn't we? And it was riding high. It

18:52.080 --> 18:56.200
was nearly at 20,000. And so we got a bit carried away is the bottom line.

18:56.200 --> 19:01.240
Yeah. It wouldn't even be a topic of discussion this year. It's not, you know, like the hype

19:01.240 --> 19:05.860
on Bitcoin is just totally dead now. Back at the end of last year, though, it was what

19:05.860 --> 19:07.280
everybody was talking about.

19:07.280 --> 19:12.900
Yeah. So for the highs, I said 120,000 and you said 100,000. And I was close because

19:12.900 --> 19:19.680
it was actually 117,000. Oh, no, no. 17,000 was the actual high. And that was on January

19:19.680 --> 19:25.880
6th. So it's just been downhill ever since. So yeah, we were kind of a little bit off

19:25.880 --> 19:26.880
there.

19:26.880 --> 19:31.040
Yeah. It was supposed to be over 100,000 for either one of us. You went a little higher.

19:31.040 --> 19:39.440
I went 100,000. You went 120. But as we record right now, it's 3,800. 3,800. That's so bad.

19:39.440 --> 19:46.400
Yeah. Well, the price on December the 1st, I had said it would be 100,000. You said it

19:46.400 --> 19:49.480
would be 107,000, which was higher than you thought the high would be.

19:49.480 --> 19:50.480
Yeah. I know. I know.

19:50.480 --> 19:56.560
Yeah. I think you got a bit of a rush of blood to the head there. And yeah, the actual price

19:56.560 --> 20:01.520
was about 4,000. So we were just slightly off there.

20:01.520 --> 20:06.000
See, this is what happens. See, Joe, you made me do a prediction and this is what happens.

20:06.000 --> 20:10.360
I blame you for all of this. Not only my wrong prediction, but for the crash itself is actually

20:10.360 --> 20:12.480
your fault as far as I'm concerned.

20:12.480 --> 20:17.080
Yeah. So the lows, we were kind of a little bit off there as well.

20:17.080 --> 20:18.080
Oh, weird.

20:18.080 --> 20:20.680
I said 15,000 and you said 10,000.

20:20.680 --> 20:25.520
Yeah. I wish it hadn't gone below 10,000 to be honest with you. And then when it got to

20:25.520 --> 20:29.160
5,000, I thought that'd be the floor. And then when it got to 4,000, I thought that'd

20:29.160 --> 20:35.360
be the floor. Part of what's always factored into where I try to guess where Bitcoin is

20:35.360 --> 20:40.280
going is the fact that there is a limited quantity. There's like 21 million or so that'll

20:40.280 --> 20:44.880
ever be created. And you figure a lot of people are losing them. A lot of people are hoarding

20:44.880 --> 20:52.440
them. So you either have a situation where over time Bitcoin will get more valuable or

20:52.440 --> 20:58.060
it'll completely be worthless. And it'll be, you know, just, I mean, maybe a couple of

20:58.060 --> 21:03.640
bucks at best. And I just, you just don't know which way it's going to go. But at this

21:03.640 --> 21:09.400
point in time, towards the end of 2018, the general narrative is that the crypto market

21:09.400 --> 21:15.560
has burst and that things are struggling. And that it's the end of Bitcoin. If that's

21:15.560 --> 21:19.960
true or not, time will tell. Obviously you just have no way of knowing, right? In a year

21:19.960 --> 21:21.320
it could be completely different.

21:21.320 --> 21:26.000
Yeah. Yeah. There's all talk of now is a great time to get into gaming because the graphics

21:26.000 --> 21:31.880
cards are cheap again because no one really wants them for mining the altcoins. But yeah,

21:31.880 --> 21:38.080
so the, the actual low was 3,200 ish and that was in mid December.

21:38.080 --> 21:39.080
Wow.

21:39.080 --> 21:43.680
That's as we record. It may well be by the time this goes out that it's lower than that.

21:43.680 --> 21:49.120
So although it does seem to have bounced back a bit, but there's just no way to know is

21:49.120 --> 21:50.120
there.

21:50.120 --> 21:55.600
No, no. And, and you know, anything could really influence from a scam, a exchange going

21:55.600 --> 22:01.040
down or an economy collapsing somewhere. All these things play into the Bitcoin price.

22:01.040 --> 22:06.160
It's a worldwide internet currency. And so things all around the world impacted, unlike,

22:06.160 --> 22:10.200
you know, regional currencies where at least you could say here, the dollar in the States

22:10.200 --> 22:15.100
is impacted mostly by things that are happening with dollar or with the oil price. But that's

22:15.100 --> 22:20.400
pretty much it. But with Bitcoin, it could be politics in China that are influencing

22:20.400 --> 22:24.560
the prices here in the States. It's just a totally new phenomenon.

22:24.560 --> 22:29.920
Yeah. All right. Well, we have to do predictions, but there's just, take these with a pinch

22:29.920 --> 22:30.920
of salt because

22:30.920 --> 22:31.920
Oh no.

22:31.920 --> 22:32.920
Who knows?

22:32.920 --> 22:35.800
Oh no. You're making me do this again. Oh no.

22:35.800 --> 22:41.480
Yep. So what's your prediction for the high in 2019?

22:41.480 --> 22:43.520
Hmm. $12,000.

22:43.520 --> 22:49.600
Interesting. So you think it is going to go back up significantly? My high, 6,000.

22:49.600 --> 22:50.600
Really?

22:50.600 --> 22:51.600
Yep.

22:51.600 --> 22:58.720
Hmm. I wouldn't be surprised if it stabilizes around 10, maybe. I could also see it completely

22:58.720 --> 23:02.200
collapsing though, to be honest with you. In even just a few months, I could see that

23:02.200 --> 23:04.400
happening. So it's a tough call really.

23:04.400 --> 23:07.560
Well, that's why I think the low is going to be 900.

23:07.560 --> 23:13.480
All right. Okay. All right. Hmm. All right. So I'd say $300 for my low.

23:13.480 --> 23:16.080
Right. So you think it's going to be a huge range then?

23:16.080 --> 23:20.480
That is a massacre if that happens though. That's an absolute massacre if that happens.

23:20.480 --> 23:25.120
Yeah. I can't help but feel if it goes as low as 300, although actually if it goes below

23:25.120 --> 23:29.240
a thousand, then surely the bottom will just fall out of it and it'll just go to nothing

23:29.240 --> 23:32.320
and it'll just be proved to be the Ponzi scheme that everyone said it was.

23:32.320 --> 23:37.800
Or would everybody start buying like crazy? Because now it's below $1,000. So buy up like

23:37.800 --> 23:43.520
crazy because there's only ever going to be 21 million. The people just, you never know

23:43.520 --> 23:45.480
how they're going to react to that kind of thing.

23:45.480 --> 23:48.680
Yeah. All right. Well, December 1st then, where do you think it's going to be?

23:48.680 --> 23:50.640
I'm going to say $9,200.

23:50.640 --> 23:55.520
Right. That's pretty high. I think it's going to be $2,000.

23:55.520 --> 24:02.480
Yeah. I feel like I went too high, but I feel like it's either going to be high or it's

24:02.480 --> 24:05.320
going to be completely low. And if it's going to be high, it's probably going to be higher

24:05.320 --> 24:11.000
than what I predicted. So I don't think I like my number either way.

24:11.000 --> 24:13.400
My numbers, let me justify my numbers to you.

24:13.400 --> 24:14.400
All right. Okay.

24:14.400 --> 24:17.600
I think that what we're going to see is a bit of a rally now up to $6,000 over the next

24:17.600 --> 24:18.600
month or so.

24:18.600 --> 24:20.000
I can feel that coming. Yeah.

24:20.000 --> 24:25.880
And then I think we're going to see a crash down to $900. And then I think it's going

24:25.880 --> 24:29.960
to struggle and it'll sort of inch its way up slowly, slowly, slowly. And then by the

24:29.960 --> 24:31.600
end of the year, be around $2,000.

24:31.600 --> 24:38.320
Yeah. The only way my predictions work out is if it finds a new floor and then it just

24:38.320 --> 24:45.480
very slowly builds its way up towards $10,000. And I think if that doesn't happen, if that

24:45.480 --> 24:50.440
stability doesn't happen, then Bitcoin is pretty much screwed as anything but just a

24:50.440 --> 24:53.840
transfer mechanism. You know what I mean? You can't use it as a currency if it's moving

24:53.840 --> 24:58.120
this much. By this point in its lifecycle, it needs to start stabilizing now. And that

24:58.120 --> 25:02.680
might be what we're seeing because it has been hanging out in the $3,000 price range

25:02.680 --> 25:09.640
now for a while. And it could slowly build up to $10,000 and just take the whole year

25:09.640 --> 25:12.840
to get there. And I think that would actually be a healthy signal for Bitcoin that it's

25:12.840 --> 25:18.400
slowing down. But I think it's the least likely. I think you're probably going to win that

25:18.400 --> 25:19.400
one.

25:19.400 --> 25:20.400
Watch it end up being $200,000.

25:20.400 --> 25:30.040
Well, if it is, we'll own up to it. I mean, now we got to admit it. We're on the record.

25:30.040 --> 25:34.400
We'll see what happens. This year couldn't have gotten any worse. So let's see. Check
