00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,280
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News.

2
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:08,960
Episode 114, recorded on July 12th, 2019.

3
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:09,960
I'm Chris.

4
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:10,960
And I'm Joe.

5
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:11,960
Hello, Joe.

6
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:12,960
Good to be connected with you.

7
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:15,280
Thanks for doing this one a little early to help me out.

8
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:19,040
And we start out with a bit of bad news for the Pale Moon project.

9
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:23,960
Yeah, their archive server was compromised, and it looks like it was quite some time ago.

10
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:30,060
At first, it looked like it was 18 months ago, but now it looks like it's some point

11
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:32,080
between April and June this year.

12
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:34,280
Yeah, the initial headlines were really dramatic.

13
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:38,120
It had been compromised for a long time, but further investigation revealed perhaps it

14
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:39,120
wasn't as...

15
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:43,680
Well, I guess it's still pretty significant, but it wasn't as significant as initially

16
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:44,680
reported.

17
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:47,960
For those of you that don't remember, Pale Moon is a fork of the Firefox project.

18
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:52,360
They forked back when there was a change in the Firefox extension.

19
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:55,820
So it's got a slightly different UI and a different extensions architecture, which some

20
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:58,520
people still feel is very useful.

21
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:04,420
It appears a malicious party gained access to the Windows server that runs the archive,

22
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:07,920
which they had been renting from a provider.

23
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:13,800
Someone got on there, ran a script, and selectively infected all of the pale moon.exe archive

24
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:16,400
files stored on that box.

25
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:20,480
The Pale Moon developer said he just recently learned of the incident about July 8th as

26
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:21,480
we record this episode.

27
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:26,280
Yeah, so it looks like this is only the Windows builds that were affected, so hopefully nothing

28
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:27,280
to panic about.

29
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:33,720
But it does illustrate some of the difficulties, shall we say, that smaller projects come up

30
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:34,720
against.

31
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:39,900
I think it's actually maybe even highlighting a larger issue, where in open source, it's

32
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:44,160
common to fork a project, and that can often lead to great results.

33
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:45,620
We've seen that.

34
00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:50,800
But this and other recent incidents are kind of underscoring that concern that maybe there

35
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:54,800
is some software that's just becoming too complex for a really small team to run.

36
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:58,560
I don't think it necessarily has to do with the complexity of the software itself.

37
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:04,640
I think it's more the complexity of running a project, which is about way more than just

38
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:05,640
the software itself.

39
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:07,520
There's all the infrastructure.

40
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:14,040
And if you're only a small team, then can you really be expected to know enough about

41
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:21,000
security and system administration and everything if what you're good at is developing software?

42
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Fair enough.

43
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,980
In fact, in most of the breaches that I'm thinking of here, it's been infrastructure

44
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:30,040
attacks that it just seems clear the team didn't have resources to properly manage both

45
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:35,240
the software development and the infrastructure side, because they both can be very time-consuming

46
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:39,640
jobs, especially if it's a project that has some user base to it.

47
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:40,880
So yeah, I guess you're right.

48
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:42,580
There really are two separate issues here.

49
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:47,760
There's the complexity of software maintainership and the complexity of infrastructure maintainership.

50
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:54,160
And a project like Pale Moon or others have to be good at both to be secure for end users.

51
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:59,840
Which is why I would reluctantly not recommend that people use software from smaller projects

52
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:00,840
like this.

53
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:04,680
I know that might be controversial, but if you go with something like Firefox, you've

54
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:09,400
got a huge organization who are maintaining it and looking after all the infrastructure.

55
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:15,160
And yes, they make missteps from time to time, but not on this scale.

56
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:17,200
This is really bad.

57
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:20,280
And okay, it's only the Archive server, so it's only older versions.

58
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:23,440
But do we even know whether that's the extent of it?

59
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:29,200
Because they've written this post-mortem on their PHP BB forum, which should just raise

60
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:33,680
alarm bells anyway, anyone running PHP BB at this stage.

61
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:36,840
But the post-mortem is not really a proper post-mortem either.

62
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:42,760
It's just really almost like a blog post about it, or a forum post in this case.

63
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:49,840
And it just makes them seem like quite an amateurish project, which is not a very nice

64
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:52,720
thing to say, but that's how it comes across.

65
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,840
See, this is what I'm struggling with.

66
00:03:54,840 --> 00:04:00,240
Because you don't want to live in a world where it's too hard to stand up services and

67
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:03,520
projects have to always use commercial hosted services.

68
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:07,440
Because A, I don't think that's true, and B, that's not a future I want to live in.

69
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:12,720
But at the same time, there is a burden of responsibility for something like a web browser

70
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:20,800
that is handling users' private information, and just their overall systems are to be respected.

71
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:25,760
It's your duty as a project to keep their system safe when they're using your software.

72
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:30,400
And in the case of this Pale Moon attack, the attackers, surprise, surprise, were going

73
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,440
for some crypto jacking.

74
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:35,960
They wanted to infect the browser with some crypto jacking malware.

75
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:39,560
It wouldn't have been the end of the world, but it would have been harmful to the end

76
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:40,560
users.

77
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,760
So there is that burden there.

78
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:46,520
At the same time, even the big guys don't always get it right.

79
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:51,000
Remember recently, Mozilla had quite the outage that just really turned out to be the root

80
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,440
cause was an expired certificate.

81
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:58,920
Yeah, this was back in May when suddenly everyone's add-ons just stopped working.

82
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:03,240
And yeah, as you say, turned out to be because of a certificate that expired.

83
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:07,240
And it's been quite a while, but now we do have some details on this.

84
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:10,040
And it really is just mismanagement.

85
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:13,880
I do appreciate them releasing a post-mortem though, like we'd all kind of moved on, kind

86
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:14,880
of forgotten.

87
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:20,560
And it's good on Mozilla that they're willing to kind of point a finger at what they got

88
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,560
wrong again.

89
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:27,180
And post this for everyone to review, because these are some of the most educational kind

90
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:31,820
of documents for people that are trying to learn how to secure real infrastructure.

91
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:35,000
Learning from other people's mistakes is one of the cheapest way to learn.

92
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,960
And I really appreciate it when companies post this.

93
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:39,200
And this is rather thorough.

94
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:44,560
In fact, they break down the specific root cause of why they failed to update the expired

95
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,560
certificate.

96
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:48,860
Like you think it's just something really super simple, but it turned out to be several

97
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:51,560
layers of failure essentially within the organization.

98
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:54,800
It's kind of a harsh way to put it, but basically what happened.

99
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:59,200
But it looks like this isn't going to happen again, and crucially they are looking at better

100
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:02,520
ways to fix it if something like this does happen.

101
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:07,720
Because they fixed it with their studies system, which is just not even designed for this at

102
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:08,720
all.

103
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:13,760
So they're looking into better ways to release quick patches in the future.

104
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:16,500
So hopefully some good will come out of all of this.

105
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:20,400
We were just once again talking about Mozilla last week, they are in the news a lot.

106
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:24,000
This time it was because they were labeled a villain by the ISPA.

107
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,880
Yeah, the ISPA who call themselves the voice of the UK internet industry.

108
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:32,380
It's a kind of industry body for ISPs.

109
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:40,600
And they had labeled Mozilla a villain because of their enabling of DNS over HTTPS, or DOA

110
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,320
as everyone's calling it.

111
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:46,920
But now the ISPA have backtracked, although not fully.

112
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:52,580
They've kind of stuck a few boots in to Mozilla, but yeah, they've withdrawn their nomination

113
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:54,160
for internet villain at least.

114
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:59,360
Yeah, they're totally backtracking, except for these six specific reasons they're totally

115
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:00,360
right.

116
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:03,280
Yeah, they couldn't just say no, we were wrong.

117
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:07,120
They are trying to walk back their position a bit here.

118
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:10,380
In fact, the way they write about it, it's like they're new to the internet, which is

119
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:14,440
adorable because they're, like you said, supposed to be the voice of the industry over there.

120
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:16,740
And yet it's like they don't know how the internet works.

121
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:20,600
They write, in the 21 years the event has been running, it's probably fair to say that

122
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:25,380
no other nomination has generated such strong opinion.

123
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:30,360
They go on to say, we have previously given the award to the home secretary for pushing

124
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:36,960
surveillance legislation to regimes of leaders that are limiting freedom, but Mozilla was

125
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:39,640
aligned too far for them, I guess.

126
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:43,100
And then they try to backtrack this whole thing by saying, but really, we're just trying

127
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:48,940
to draw attention to DNS over HTTPS and how different implementations could be bad.

128
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:50,340
That is worth talking about.

129
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:56,760
They're also trying to throw shade on DNS over HTTPS, and I'm not really a big fan of

130
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:57,760
that.

131
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:58,760
I actually think it's kind of cool tech.

132
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:00,800
Again, it just comes down to implementations every single time.

133
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:07,380
Well, you guys did a great breakdown of DOE on the last Linux Unplugged, so linuxunplugged.com

134
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:09,800
slash 309, check that out.

135
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:13,340
Some ways to implement it yourself and some good discussion on that.

136
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:18,680
New version of Firefox 68 also landed this week with the dark mode reader view, which

137
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:20,800
is kind of what I'm excited about.

138
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:24,480
Also nice to see a new ESR release based on 68 now too.

139
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:26,280
Yeah, it looks to be a very solid release.

140
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:29,160
I haven't actually got it yet on Ubuntu.

141
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:32,360
I'm waiting for that update, but I'm sure it will come down pretty soon.

142
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:35,040
Also a bit of follow up from another story last week.

143
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:40,280
It looks like Microsoft is going to be accepted into that Linux distros mailing list.

144
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:41,880
This is a post on that mailing list.

145
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:46,040
They write, Microsoft doesn't look all that different from many other large corporations,

146
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:50,200
including some which already have their Linux distro teams represented on the list.

147
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:53,420
There's another kind of interesting conversation that's now happening on the side.

148
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:55,880
It's like, what do we bring Microsoft in as?

149
00:08:55,880 --> 00:09:01,200
They say, maybe we shouldn't label them as just Microsoft as a member of the Linux distros.

150
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:04,920
Microsoft is much more than just their Linux based products and services.

151
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:10,020
We list Amazon Linux, AMI rather than Amazon and Chrome OS rather than Google.

152
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:13,520
And we also separately have Android listed rather than Google.

153
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:16,680
And it seems like a funny thing to kind of be going back and forth about, but it really

154
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:21,960
comes down to setting the expectation for researchers that are interacting with this

155
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:23,760
Linux distros mailing list.

156
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:27,760
You'll recall this is really a list to discuss security issues.

157
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:31,620
And so researchers will interact with this list, and they don't want them to have the

158
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:35,920
mistaken impression that because Microsoft is now on the list, that they can notify Microsoft

159
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:39,380
about their other products issues.

160
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:43,160
It's a small thing, but when you think about something five, 10 years down the road, it

161
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:44,840
really makes a big difference.

162
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:46,040
So now they're working out the semantics.

163
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:48,520
I don't think there was ever any doubt this was going to happen, Joe.

164
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:50,480
You had Greg KH backing this.

165
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:52,280
All kinds of big companies are in this list.

166
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:53,280
Oh, yeah.

167
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:58,240
There was a little bit of dissent on the list from people who used M$ sign.

168
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:01,400
So they were just ignored, obviously.

169
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:08,440
And it seems that this list is for grown ups, really, who accept that Microsoft are running

170
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:11,760
some Linux products now, some distros, essentially.

171
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:14,720
And that they really ought to have access to this.

172
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:17,680
And yeah, they are no different from any other huge company.

173
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:21,640
Obviously, you need to watch them, but you judge them by their actions.

174
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:23,040
Well, how about another follow up?

175
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:28,280
The Raspberry Pi Foundation has confirmed that the recently released Raspberry Pi 4

176
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:31,080
may not work when using certain USB-C cables.

177
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:36,520
Yeah, this really comes down to a resistor which costs a fraction of a dollar.

178
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:41,360
And I saw some maths that said if they sold a million units of these Raspberry Pi 4s,

179
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:46,040
they might save $500 by cutting this tiny corner.

180
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:50,960
And for that $500, I think it's going to cost them a lot more than that in bad PR.

181
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:55,680
Well, and they're also going to have to do some engineering to revise this and then update

182
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:58,440
the boards and manufacture those as well.

183
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:03,600
Because the foundation has said they're going to attempt to address this in a hardware revision,

184
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:09,680
which means if you bought one early, like I did, you're probably stuck with this particular

185
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:10,680
challenge.

186
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:11,680
But it's not too bad.

187
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:15,560
Really, it's the smart chargers that are a quote unquote e-marked cable.

188
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:19,880
They try to suss out what the Raspberry Pi is and they will incorrectly detect it as

189
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:20,880
an audio adapter.

190
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:24,580
Then it just doesn't supply the right amount of power.

191
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:30,220
Almost all of the cheapo USB-C cables and stuff that come with like Android phones,

192
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:31,560
they will work.

193
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:36,360
It's really the nicer ones like laptops or nicer, smarter, quote unquote cables that

194
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:37,360
you're going to have a problem with.

195
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:41,160
And if you buy the power adapter with the Raspberry Pi, you're going to be fine.

196
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:46,280
Yeah, I was suddenly very happy that I was forced to buy a semi-official one that has

197
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:48,480
worked absolutely perfectly for me.

198
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,040
So yeah, no problems.

199
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:55,280
And that's what they suggest, buy an official power supply, which is a bit rich, isn't it?

200
00:11:55,280 --> 00:12:01,280
Yeah, although it seems, and this isn't 100%, but it seems most cables that are USB-A to

201
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:08,560
USB-C or USB-B to C, they typically are just dumb pass-through cables and if they can supply

202
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:09,840
enough power, you're good.

203
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:11,320
They are typically not e-marked.

204
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:16,600
Yeah, so it's not a huge issue, but it is still pretty embarrassing for Raspberry Pi.

205
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:21,960
What is huge is that IBM's acquisition of Red Hat has officially closed, with the exception

206
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:23,240
of Brazil.

207
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:31,000
This is that $34 billion acquisition and I believe the final number was $190 per share

208
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:36,560
in cash, plus some loans on IBM's side, and we got ourselves a final deal.

209
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:41,960
Yeah, and once again, they're talking up the hybrid cloud stuff and how nothing's really

210
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:47,320
going to change at Red Hat and it's just they're going to have the sales power of IBM and their

211
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:51,120
experience and everything, and the Fedora project leader, Matthew Miller, has made some

212
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:55,860
comments saying that Fedora's fine, it's going to just carry on as it is.

213
00:12:55,860 --> 00:13:00,800
And so it's really the message is business as usual, but just more of it.

214
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:05,000
For me personally, the Fedora side of the story is interesting.

215
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,200
It's hard to really say what happens in Red Hat.

216
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:12,820
It's going to be harder to measure from the outside, but what happens to Fedora will be

217
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:17,840
right in front of all of us and I'll be watching and I think Matthew Miller knows that a lot

218
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:18,840
of us are watching.

219
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:22,760
That's why he got out there really early and started talking about how this change is nothing,

220
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:25,160
we're continuing on, and we'll see about that.

221
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:30,760
I hope so because a lot of the community depends on some really great projects that are born

222
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:31,760
out of Fedora.

223
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:32,760
Matthew Feeney Yeah.

224
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:37,560
And IBM and Red Hat are very aware of that and so you would hope that Fedora would be

225
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:42,640
left alone to do its thing and make its own decisions because it's the sort of canary

226
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:44,200
in the coal mine, isn't it?

227
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:49,480
But as I said at the time of the announcement of this deal, I honestly think it's good.

228
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:55,520
I know some people are very kind of skeptical about it, but I think that IBM really will

229
00:13:55,520 --> 00:14:01,400
just use their sales experience and all the money that they've got and the infrastructure

230
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:08,120
to just facilitate Red Hat doing what it does, which is create a bunch of open source software

231
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:11,720
and sell services very profitably around that software.

232
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:12,960
Joe Quirk We'll see.

233
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:15,880
It's definitely one of the more fascinating stories of the last few years.

234
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:19,480
One of the most fascinating stories of the software industry ever, actually.

235
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:20,480
We'll see where it goes.

236
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:21,480
We'll see, Joe.

237
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:25,080
In the meantime, I'm a little more upset about what's going on potentially with Nome

238
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:27,360
software and support for SNAPs.

239
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:33,480
Yeah, it looks like in Fedora 31, the SNAP plugin is going to be disabled in GNOME software.

240
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:35,640
It was definitely trending in that direction.

241
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:38,840
As we record now, that may not be the case.

242
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:42,800
Richard Hughes, who we've talked about before on the show in the context of the firmware

243
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:49,160
update project, great work over there, is one of two primary developers of Nome software.

244
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:50,800
Now let that sink in for a moment.

245
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:54,080
There's contributors to Nome software, but there's two primary developers and Richard

246
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:58,840
Hughes is one of them, and he wrote, recently, Canonical decided that they are not going

247
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:03,320
to be installing Nome software in the next LTS, preferring instead to ship a SNAP store

248
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:06,500
by Canonical rather than Nome software.

249
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:11,080
The new SNAP store will obviously not support flat packs or even firmwares for that matter.

250
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:14,320
The developers are currently assigned to work on Nome software, have been reassigned to

251
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:18,120
work on the SNAP store, and I'm not confident they'll be able to keep up both the old and

252
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:19,760
new code bases.

253
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:23,940
The existing SNAP plugin is not very well tested, and I do not want to be the one responsible

254
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:28,200
when it breaks.

255
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:34,280
The crux of it here really is that Canonical is switching to their own software store in

256
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:38,600
Ubuntu LTS, the next LTS, not the version that's about to ship.

257
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:41,320
That will still be using Nome software.

258
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:47,280
But in the version after that, they have begun, as we record, about 20 days ago the first

259
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:51,520
patches were committed, they have begun developing their own store.

260
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:53,560
It hasn't been finished.

261
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:56,720
It may not even end up in the LTS.

262
00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:02,840
The other thing that was surprising about this is the SNAP maintainer for Fedora was

263
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:05,000
caught off guard completely by this.

264
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,560
Neil writes in the comments, this is completely news to me.

265
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:14,480
As far as I know, Canonical is still maintaining the SNAP plugin upstream, which is the case.

266
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:19,200
And he also writes how they've been recently getting very close to full confinement support

267
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:22,240
using SNAPs and SE Linux on Fedora.

268
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:24,800
So we're getting really close to that as well.

269
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:33,120
What reads as a bit of a snafu between Canonical and the Fedora maintainers reveals what a

270
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:38,800
lot of rumors had been implying for a long time, that the Canonical developers have to

271
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:43,680
really walk on eggshells around the upstream Nome and Fedora team.

272
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:50,920
And that the support for SNAPs in Nome software was really kind of conditional.

273
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:53,280
As long as Canonical played ball, they'd keep it.

274
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:57,600
But as soon as Canonical didn't, they took that ball.

275
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:01,920
I give credit to the Canonical developers who engaged in this conversation in a very

276
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:04,160
rational level-headed approach.

277
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:06,480
And they came to some common ground here.

278
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:10,880
In fact, we even are revealed a bit of what perhaps will be the future of Flatpaks and

279
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:13,560
funding Flathub developers.

280
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:18,040
There's some interesting things in here, including that Nome software is already falling underneath

281
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:22,360
its own weight and that they're struggling to reduce its complexity.

282
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:26,520
And there's some things that the SNAP plugin developers can do to help with that.

283
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:31,760
It looks like we've kind of found a happy middle ground right now.

284
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:34,000
SNAP plugin support will continue.

285
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,820
That may change in the future.

286
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:42,580
But even if they were to remove plugin support, Neil could simply package it up and then the

287
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:46,720
end user could just install that package and everything would be fine.

288
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:50,660
Just like with the 32-bit situation that we talked about a couple of weeks ago, there's

289
00:17:50,660 --> 00:17:52,080
always another solution.

290
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:54,040
There's always another way to solve this problem.

291
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:55,840
It's never the end of the world.

292
00:17:55,840 --> 00:18:00,520
I think one of the problems with open source development is that everything is out of the

293
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:01,520
open.

294
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:03,520
And that's obviously one of its big strengths as well.

295
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:09,200
But it can be its Achilles heel because in cases like this, it's just a very sort of

296
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:13,120
public squabble almost is what it looks like.

297
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:18,320
And I don't think there's any way to avoid that because of the open nature of the development.

298
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:21,920
But it does reflect badly on everyone really when this sort of stuff happens.

299
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:22,920
It is.

300
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:27,640
However, in this case, we did actually see them all work it out on their own in a public

301
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:30,480
forum without name calling.

302
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:34,960
Really a very rational, reasonable conversation considering what was at stake.

303
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:38,120
It feels like though we've just punted the issue for now.

304
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:43,840
Now there is this line and when that when that new store does go live, we're going to

305
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:45,260
be there again.

306
00:18:45,260 --> 00:18:47,120
We're going to be right back where we're at.

307
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:49,460
And maybe it does make sense, right?

308
00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:56,200
The Gnome folks and Red Hat and the Fedora team, they're all in on flat packs.

309
00:18:56,200 --> 00:19:01,280
And if Canonical shipping their own store and doesn't need that support upstreamed anymore,

310
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:03,600
so that way it's functional on Ubuntu.

311
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:07,640
Why should they maintain their competitors product, I guess like I'm trying to think

312
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:08,640
about it from their side.

313
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:11,180
I can see some rationale there.

314
00:19:11,180 --> 00:19:14,800
It's just sort of the timing of it because the project so brand new, it may not even

315
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:15,960
go anywhere.

316
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:20,240
It's just so early days that it seemed it seemed seemed a little early, like the reaction

317
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:21,720
was they were ready to jump.

318
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:23,120
Oh, yeah, definitely.

319
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:26,800
It feels like they were just looking for an excuse, really.

320
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:31,480
And it's sad to see because we hoped that there would be great cooperation and that

321
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:37,520
with a major distro like Ubuntu switching to Gnome that it would mean that Gnome benefited

322
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:41,280
from all those extra users and all the extra development.

323
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:47,000
But if we're starting to see hostility happening, then it's just not good for anyone.

324
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
I know.

325
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
I agree.

326
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:53,240
You just you want to see the desktop be successful and and this stuff seems counterproductive

327
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:54,240
to that.

328
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:55,840
But I got to bring it back to the end of the day.

329
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:57,420
They did work it out.

330
00:19:57,420 --> 00:20:00,640
For now, the cats and dogs continue to get along, Joe.

331
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:04,920
Can you imagine big proprietary companies who are rivals working together on software

332
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:05,920
like this?

333
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:07,680
Not at all, really.

334
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:09,160
And that's the nature of open source.

335
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:11,480
And obviously, you're going to have a few issues here and there.

336
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:16,240
But ultimately, it is much better to do it this open source way.

337
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:17,400
That's a great point.

338
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:23,000
And you know, props to developers on both sides of this situation who end up essentially

339
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,160
becoming corporate ambassadors.

340
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:30,180
They are dealing with interactions that could have millions of dollars worth of ramifications

341
00:20:30,180 --> 00:20:31,680
for either side.

342
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:34,480
And it's just not even part of their job description.

343
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:40,320
So regardless of however this goes, you know, tip of the hat to both sides for having to

344
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:44,980
wear that extra hat when also having these technical conversations.

345
00:20:44,980 --> 00:20:45,980
This stuff's fascinating.

346
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:48,180
It's what makes open source tick.

347
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:51,560
This and all kinds of things make free software really something to follow.

check out Linux Unplugged 3.10 when it lands on Tuesday.

352
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:11,320
It's our review of the year's big story so far, where we think things are going, what

353
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:14,160
we got right, and what we got wrong.

354
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:17,760
We'll be back next Monday with our weekly take on the latest Linux and open source news.

355
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:19,360
I'm at Chris LAS.

356
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:20,680
I'm at Joel Rissington.

357
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:23,600
Thank you for joining us, and we will see you next week.

358
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:39,020
Take care, guys.
