Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, our weekly take on Linux and the open source world.

00:16.200 --> 00:21.240
This is episode 97, recorded on March 17th, 2019. I'm Chris.

00:21.240 --> 00:22.240
And I'm Tom.

00:22.240 --> 00:29.560
Hello, Joe. It's good to be connected with you. And holy smokes, we have so many stories

00:29.560 --> 00:35.760
to get into today. Let's start off with some great news for Gnome users. Version 3.32 is

00:35.760 --> 00:38.120
released and it's a big one.

00:38.120 --> 00:41.180
And you've been running this for a while, haven't you? So have you been taking advantage

00:41.180 --> 00:42.960
of the fractional scaling?

00:42.960 --> 00:47.320
I have been for weeks and it has been getting incrementally better and better and better

00:47.320 --> 00:53.560
as the beta goes on. So that new fractional scaling is like the huge feature. And this

00:53.560 --> 00:59.480
has been like three years in the work. Started years ago at Canonical, kind of got set aside

00:59.480 --> 01:03.960
for a little bit and it's finally all come together with the upstream Gnome project.

01:03.960 --> 01:09.380
And it's neat. So fractional scaling is a feature that allows everything on the screen

01:09.380 --> 01:15.020
to fractionally scale up for high DPI monitors. This is super nice if maybe you want a little

01:15.020 --> 01:21.840
more real estate on your high DPI screen and has some great accessibility possibilities

01:21.840 --> 01:28.200
as well. But right now, it's only an experimental feature. So to enable fractional scaling in

01:28.200 --> 01:34.000
Gnome 3.32, you have to be using Wayland, which I am, and you have to run a specific

01:34.000 --> 01:37.440
command on the command line, which we'll have linked in the show notes. But if you do these

01:37.440 --> 01:42.440
two things, you get this option. It just sort of shows up in the Gnome settings. And it

01:42.440 --> 01:46.560
is neat. I played around with it on my ThinkPad, which even though it's a 1080p screen, I was

01:46.560 --> 01:52.320
still able to turn this on and play with it. It is fun. And I was wondering, I didn't see

01:52.320 --> 01:56.520
an option in the UI, but maybe somebody in the audience knows, I'd love to go the other

01:56.520 --> 02:03.080
way. So you have increments of like 100%, 125%, 150, etc. I want to go the other way.

02:03.080 --> 02:07.440
I want to scale down to 80%. That's something you could do in Unity 7. So you could get

02:07.440 --> 02:11.920
even more real estate on a small screen. If anybody out there knows a way to do that with

02:11.920 --> 02:16.280
this new fractional scaling, let me know, linuxactionnews.com slash contact.

02:16.280 --> 02:19.440
One of the real headlines for this release are the performance improvements though. Presumably

02:19.440 --> 02:20.780
you've noticed that then.

02:20.780 --> 02:24.880
They are noticeable. And I think that's noteworthy right there. A lot of times you'll see like

02:24.880 --> 02:30.760
performance improvements as one of the line items as a new feature for a new release.

02:30.760 --> 02:36.200
But these are actually perceptible improvements in the performance of the UI.

02:36.200 --> 02:40.200
So do you think this is going to be enough to tempt you back over to Gnome from Plasma?

02:40.200 --> 02:46.200
When you combine the performance improvements, the stability improvements, the high DPI fractional

02:46.200 --> 02:51.640
scaling, the way they've reorganized the settings menu, which looks slick, the new updates to

02:51.640 --> 02:58.820
Gnome software, and the update to boxes, which makes accessing your GPU via a virtual machine

02:58.820 --> 03:04.960
much easier. It's very, very hard to say no. Like I said, I've been running it on my ThinkPad

03:04.960 --> 03:08.700
now for a few weeks, and there's just no way I'm taking it off at this point.

03:08.700 --> 03:12.180
If you have had issues with Gnome, like I'm on the record, Gnome and I have been on a

03:12.180 --> 03:18.620
break for a little while. I've been seeing Plasma for about a year. But this Gnome 3.32

03:18.620 --> 03:23.040
is a really good looking release. And right now, I mean, I don't know where this is going,

03:23.040 --> 03:26.100
but I'm excited and we're hitting it off. I'll just put it that way.

03:26.100 --> 03:28.720
How did you install it then? What distro is it on top of?

03:28.720 --> 03:33.620
I've tried it out on Rawhide, but the one that I ended up going with for my daily driver

03:33.620 --> 03:40.140
is actually Ubuntu 19.04. Because from what I can tell looking at the whole Gnome landscape

03:40.140 --> 03:46.300
right now, it appears there's a couple of more performance and stability fixes in Canonical's

03:46.300 --> 03:51.280
version that they're going to vendor patch that just haven't quite been accepted upstream

03:51.280 --> 03:56.040
yet. Like most of it's upstream, but not quite all of it has been accepted yet. And so some

03:56.040 --> 04:00.780
of those, I believe, will ship as vendor patches in 19.04. This is all kind of up in the air

04:00.780 --> 04:06.900
right now, but I ended up landing on Ubuntu 19.04. That said, the Rawhide implementation

04:06.900 --> 04:10.420
also same great performance improvements, really looks good too.

04:10.420 --> 04:14.620
Well, I'm afraid I'm not tempted to switch away from XFCE just yet.

04:14.620 --> 04:15.620
Not surprised.

04:15.620 --> 04:16.620
Surprise, surprise.

04:16.620 --> 04:22.320
No, no surprise to that actually. And I don't blame you if you're not already a Gnome user

04:22.320 --> 04:26.780
or a big fan of the general workflow of Gnome, this isn't going to win you over. If you've

04:26.780 --> 04:34.020
tried out Gnome in the past and Gnome as some like to call it, if Gnome Shell was a good

04:34.020 --> 04:38.340
fit workflow wise for you, but other things prevented you from using it, like myself,

04:38.340 --> 04:41.980
I think that's where it's definitely worth a relook in this new version. And maybe go

04:41.980 --> 04:48.460
grab OpenSUSE Tumbleweed or try out the 19.04 dailies and just see if you can notice the

04:48.460 --> 04:50.500
improvements. Doesn't cost much.

04:50.500 --> 04:54.320
Well, you've actually got me tempted to try it now. So I think I will. I can't see me

04:54.320 --> 05:01.180
switch into it, but I think it's worth a go. So something you covered on LUP last week

05:01.180 --> 05:04.700
was this Debian situation and there have been some developments.

05:04.700 --> 05:09.140
Right. At the beginning of the week, it looked like no one wanted to run the Debian project.

05:09.140 --> 05:11.300
They were going to be leaderless, Joe.

05:11.300 --> 05:15.580
Yeah. And then one person stepped forward and then another person and another person.

05:15.580 --> 05:17.700
And now there's five people running for election.

05:17.700 --> 05:21.740
Well, nature abhors a vacuum, Joe. So by the time people are listening to this, there could

05:21.740 --> 05:26.580
be another five that have stepped forward.

05:26.580 --> 05:29.940
But it's good though, isn't it? Because we thought that no one was going to step forward

05:29.940 --> 05:33.900
and it looked like it was just going to keep rolling on and on and on. Each week they'd

05:33.900 --> 05:39.300
just keep it open for people to come forward. And I think really it was a case of no one

05:39.300 --> 05:44.280
wanted to be the only one standing in the election because that's just a bit weird.

05:44.280 --> 05:49.500
And then when one person came forward, that sort of opened the floodgates. So maybe the

05:49.500 --> 05:54.540
project isn't quite in the trouble that some people were speculating that it is. It seemed

05:54.540 --> 06:01.340
a bit overblown to me, this idea of them having really old tooling and everything. I mean,

06:01.340 --> 06:07.100
okay, yeah, it's not the most modern of distros, but it's been working pretty well for all

06:07.100 --> 06:15.020
these years. And their governance model is very solid. And I just can't see huge problems

06:15.020 --> 06:16.020
really.

06:16.020 --> 06:19.340
I think I'm somewhere in the middle in that argument. I can accept that the tooling, like

06:19.340 --> 06:25.140
their bug tracking system for one, and the way they deploy packages, and maybe the way

06:25.140 --> 06:29.620
the release cadences are set, like those areas seem like they could use some retooling. But

06:29.620 --> 06:34.940
the fundamental governance model does seem sound. And with the right intentions and the

06:34.940 --> 06:40.060
right people, the tooling issues can be resolved. So it's not like, yeah, the sky isn't falling

06:40.060 --> 06:44.060
here. But I think it's worth recognizing that as a project that's been around for a very,

06:44.060 --> 06:48.900
very long time, and they're one of the grandfather Linux distributions, it makes sense there

06:48.900 --> 06:54.620
could be some tools that need to be improved. And the motivation for that isn't to be hip,

06:54.620 --> 06:59.260
isn't to follow trends, isn't to put everything on GitHub or whatever people might assume.

06:59.260 --> 07:03.940
It's simply just to draw in new contributors, new ideas to the project to keep it healthy.

07:03.940 --> 07:07.900
Yeah, that's true, I suppose. You do need to keep the new blood coming in, don't you?

07:07.900 --> 07:14.220
So maybe, hopefully, whoever wins this will have some influence. I mean, I know it's kind

07:14.220 --> 07:20.180
of, it's mostly a advocacy role, really, isn't it? Going around to conferences and things,

07:20.180 --> 07:25.060
but hopefully, they can have some influence and make it modernize a little bit.

07:25.060 --> 07:28.540
Maybe what they need is like a really good foundation, Joe. You know, maybe something

07:28.540 --> 07:33.020
the Linux Foundation could put together for a foundation inside a foundation that would

07:33.020 --> 07:35.420
cover the Debian Foundation.

07:35.420 --> 07:41.420
Yeah, because the Linux Foundation definitely needs more sub foundations, don't they? And

07:41.420 --> 07:45.500
this week, how many did they announce? I've honestly lost count.

07:45.500 --> 07:49.340
You know, it seems like that's a question that should be easy to answer, but it's not,

07:49.340 --> 07:53.820
especially this week. The number could be somewhere between two and five. It just sort

07:53.820 --> 07:59.760
of depends on how you do this math. So we've got the merger of a couple of foundations

07:59.760 --> 08:05.460
into the OpenJS Foundation this week. Then you've also got the launch of the Continuous

08:05.460 --> 08:12.080
Delivery Foundation this week. Also, the announcement of the Chips Alliance, which is kind of actually

08:12.080 --> 08:18.540
like a foundation. And then on top of all of that, you've got the new Red Team project,

08:18.540 --> 08:24.420
which in a lot of ways, operates like a foundation. And then to top it all off, you've got the

08:24.420 --> 08:31.140
new Community Bridge platform, which is sort of enabling projects to create foundations

08:31.140 --> 08:34.140
on demand. I don't know how many that is, Joe.

08:34.140 --> 08:36.420
Yeah, it's like I said, too many to count.

08:36.420 --> 08:40.420
By the way, I didn't even mention the GraphQL Foundation.

08:40.420 --> 08:47.020
They just love their bureaucracy, don't they? The Linux Foundation for some reason.

08:47.020 --> 08:48.700
Foundations all the way down, Joe.

08:48.700 --> 08:49.940
Foundations for days, yeah.

08:49.940 --> 08:53.780
I don't really know how to sort this. I'm trying to wrap my head around this. It's almost

08:53.780 --> 08:59.340
too much to really conceptualize at once. I just kind of want to remind some of us about

08:59.340 --> 09:05.060
the fundamentals. The Linux Foundation is not a charity organization. It is a trade

09:05.060 --> 09:10.900
association, which is designed to serve the common business interests of its paid members

09:10.900 --> 09:18.340
like Microsoft and VMware and others who control its board of directors. So it's not bad or

09:18.340 --> 09:24.740
good necessarily. It's just a reminder that the Linux Foundation itself is not a charity.

09:24.740 --> 09:30.060
It's not, if you give them money, it's not a tax write-off. It is a trade association.

09:30.060 --> 09:37.740
And perhaps having foundations for days helps build that organization. I imagine there's

09:37.740 --> 09:41.820
an obvious and clear reason why we need this many foundations. I just don't know what it

09:41.820 --> 09:42.820
is.

09:42.820 --> 09:48.500
Yeah, there's got to be a reason. But the Node.js and JS foundations merging, that's

09:48.500 --> 09:53.780
been in the works for quite some time. We covered that back on Linux Action News 74,

09:53.780 --> 09:58.100
which was back in October, so five, six months ago. So it goes to show that these things

09:58.100 --> 10:00.740
do take a bit of time to work themselves out.

10:00.740 --> 10:04.420
Yeah, you're dealing with 30 different companies that are involved with that particular one,

10:04.420 --> 10:10.660
like Google, Microsoft, IBM, PayPal, GoDaddy, Joyent. There's even more. There's 30 of them

10:10.660 --> 10:14.500
that are involved with this. So it takes time, I would imagine, to get alignment from all

10:14.500 --> 10:19.560
of them. But each of them released different press statements saying, well, we support

10:19.560 --> 10:24.340
the JavaScript ecosystem, and we support the merger of these foundations. It's all interesting.

10:24.340 --> 10:29.740
But can I tell you the one that really jumps out at me out of all of the recent Linux Foundation

10:29.740 --> 10:34.580
announcements is this Community Bridge platform. This is interesting.

10:34.580 --> 10:40.060
Yeah, it's sort of almost like Patreon Plus, isn't it? It's kind of got the Patreon aspects

10:40.060 --> 10:44.900
to it. It's got some community management aspects to it. It's a pretty big deal.

10:44.900 --> 10:49.600
Yeah, they pitch it as a platform they're going to add features to over time. And it

10:49.600 --> 10:57.460
got its initial big commercial funding already from GitHub. They've contributed $100,000

10:57.460 --> 11:03.100
to this initiative. And when you look at the Community Bridge platform, they say it's about

11:03.100 --> 11:08.920
funding security and people. So transparently raise and spend your money as a project. They

11:08.920 --> 11:12.980
say they'll provide transparency into potential vulnerabilities and fixes, i.e. they will

11:12.980 --> 11:19.260
scan your code repositories for vulnerabilities and apparently make that public. And they

11:19.260 --> 11:25.140
say they're going to enable easy connections for mentors and prospects, people that want

11:25.140 --> 11:33.420
to be mentees, etc. I looked into it a little bit. And what it is, is a closed source platform

11:33.420 --> 11:40.100
for open source projects to manage some of the aspects of being a large project. But

11:40.100 --> 11:43.900
it's not everything. You're still going to need lawyers. You're still going to need people

11:43.900 --> 11:49.860
to take care of stuff that aren't your core responsibilities. And I have to say, Joe,

11:49.860 --> 11:56.420
it is a damn tragedy. And I don't use that lightly, that this Community Bridge platform

11:56.420 --> 12:00.780
is not open source. I believe this is something the Linux Foundation must have been working

12:00.780 --> 12:07.060
on for a while or whoever they acquired it from has been. It has a lot of focus around

12:07.060 --> 12:13.060
mentorships and mentees, which I think is very important. And it has all of these elements

12:13.060 --> 12:18.060
about collecting money and tracking how a project spends its money and making that transparently

12:18.060 --> 12:22.340
available to the community. It is something that is more appropriate for open source projects

12:22.340 --> 12:28.780
than say, Patreon. But the fact that it's closed source is such a shame, because this

12:28.780 --> 12:33.740
is something that could uniquely be beneficial to the open source community. It could be

12:33.740 --> 12:38.540
adopted by groups like the Software Conservancy that they could extend this platform. It could

12:38.540 --> 12:44.380
be adopted by projects like Debian directly. It is a missed opportunity to truly give back

12:44.380 --> 12:48.680
to the open source community by locking this down as a proprietary platform.

12:48.680 --> 12:53.500
You have to figure that their reasoning is that it would become too fragmented if they

12:53.500 --> 12:58.220
made it open source. Because if everyone could run their own instance of it, then you wouldn't

12:58.220 --> 13:01.940
know where to go necessarily to find the projects that you're looking for. Whereas if it's all

13:01.940 --> 13:08.140
centralized, then that's much more convenient for people. But that's a bit of a weak argument

13:08.140 --> 13:14.540
given that it's all based on open source projects. And therefore, it's just almost a no brainer.

13:14.540 --> 13:18.500
You just expect it to be released under an open source license rather than just locked

13:18.500 --> 13:19.500
down.

13:19.500 --> 13:24.020
This is my opinion, but just watching the Linux Foundation over the last few years,

13:24.020 --> 13:27.380
and all of these foundations that they're launching, bringing all these companies on

13:27.380 --> 13:32.380
board, and now the launch of this community bridge initiative.

13:32.380 --> 13:37.620
What I see as a common thread here is the Linux Foundation wants to own all of this.

13:37.620 --> 13:43.820
They want to be the umbrella organization for the entire open source community. That

13:43.820 --> 13:50.540
is poison. That's toxic to an open source community. Its evolutionary nature is its

13:50.540 --> 13:56.140
very strength and the centralization of power would be very, very damaging. But I think

13:56.140 --> 14:00.780
this is what we're seeing here. And I don't think it's about fragmentation. I think it's

14:00.780 --> 14:06.220
about control and power. And that's why it's a hosted platform that they control. And if

14:06.220 --> 14:09.540
they want to prove me wrong, go ahead and open source it, Linux Foundation. Have at

14:09.540 --> 14:10.540
it.

14:10.540 --> 14:14.780
Well, if they did open source this, then organizations like Mozilla would be able to run an instance

14:14.780 --> 14:18.700
and obviously people would be able to run their own. And I think that there are a lot

14:18.700 --> 14:24.300
of people who would prefer to go with someone like Mozilla rather than the Linux Foundation,

14:24.300 --> 14:29.460
which is a trade body, as he said. And it's not a foundation that is furthering the public

14:29.460 --> 14:34.560
good. It's there to further the interests of its members, which is totally fine. But

14:34.560 --> 14:36.560
some people are just not going to be comfortable with that.

14:36.560 --> 14:40.880
I think the Software Conservancy said it pretty well, although it is a bit aggressive. They

14:40.880 --> 14:46.480
are not an unbiased party in this matter. But that said, they write at the end of their

14:46.480 --> 14:50.600
blog post, which we'll have linked in the notes. The new Linux Foundation system is

14:50.600 --> 14:56.300
probably just right for free and open source projects that a, prefer to use a single point

14:56.300 --> 15:02.380
of failure, proprietary software, and b, do not want to operate in a way that is dedicated

15:02.380 --> 15:09.340
to the public good, and c, have minimal fiscal sponsorship needs, such as occasional reimbursement

15:09.340 --> 15:10.700
of project expenses.

15:10.700 --> 15:11.700
Ouch.

15:11.700 --> 15:19.300
That's like a serious burn. That's so great. They obviously, again, are biased in this

15:19.300 --> 15:26.340
area, but I can't help but completely see their point of view on this. This, in a really

15:26.340 --> 15:33.620
sad way, is no more free and no better for the open source community than just everybody

15:33.620 --> 15:38.740
using Patreon. The only difference here is they're taking care of some additional administrative

15:38.740 --> 15:42.380
responsibilities, but not enough. Like the projects will still have to form their own

15:42.380 --> 15:47.060
corporate organization in most countries. They'll still have to have legal counsel in

15:47.060 --> 15:53.740
most countries. Like it's not a full, complete package. I appreciate this is new, but it's

15:53.740 --> 15:59.380
off to a bumpy start in my opinion. And also, the fact that the Linux Foundation is a little

15:59.380 --> 16:08.380
tone deaf to this particular issue is concerning as well, because it only furthers that narrative

16:08.380 --> 16:14.280
that they're serving at the will of the major corporations. And one really surefire way

16:14.280 --> 16:19.980
to combat that narrative would be to actually empathize with the community's needs and deliver

16:19.980 --> 16:24.500
something that the community would respond positively to that would indicate you're listening.

16:24.500 --> 16:28.640
And every time you make an action that seems to indicate you're not listening, you're furthering

16:28.640 --> 16:33.500
a narrative you probably don't want further. And either they're unaware of that or they

16:33.500 --> 16:38.700
just don't care. And either one of those two things is extremely unfortunate and a shame

16:38.700 --> 16:40.780
coming from the Linux Foundation.

16:40.780 --> 16:44.420
Even if they did open source, it would feel like somewhat duplicated effort given that

16:44.420 --> 16:49.660
we have Librepay as a platform already that is completely open source. And so you'd think

16:49.660 --> 16:54.060
that maybe they should have built on top of that and sort of given back to the community

16:54.060 --> 16:57.740
rather than spending a bunch of money on something that only they can use.

16:57.740 --> 17:02.300
Yeah, it would be at least a decent starting point and maybe they could work with the Linux

17:02.300 --> 17:06.700
Foundation. Okay, well, reaction has been a little more positive to the big news for

17:06.700 --> 17:07.860
NGINX this week.

17:07.860 --> 17:16.200
Yeah, NGINX has been acquired by F5 Networks for $670 million. That seems a lot for a web

17:16.200 --> 17:17.740
server company to me.

17:17.740 --> 17:24.060
Does it though? I mean, by even kind of moderate estimations, there's over 374 million sites

17:24.060 --> 17:30.540
using NGINX. 67% of the highest traffic sites on the internet use NGINX. But more than that,

17:30.540 --> 17:37.700
it's used as an accelerator in and even like a traffic cop in so many network configurations.

17:37.700 --> 17:43.620
It's become the little engine that could. I feel like it's worth a lot more than this.

17:43.620 --> 17:47.020
But you know, maybe I just compare everything to the price of Instagram.

17:47.020 --> 17:53.060
Yeah, or Red Hat maybe. Well, you only have to look at F5 stock price and how that dipped

17:53.060 --> 17:59.680
once this was announced to tell you that evidently NGINX is not really that valuable in terms

17:59.680 --> 18:04.940
of revenue, not compared to something like Red Hat, which is obviously a revenue generating

18:04.940 --> 18:05.940
juggernaut.

18:05.940 --> 18:11.100
Yeah, NGINX is really a problem solver that you just install quietly. And it takes care

18:11.100 --> 18:17.600
of things. In a lot of ways. That's also what a lot of F5 network equipment does. There

18:17.600 --> 18:20.460
is some actual, what do they call it?

18:20.460 --> 18:21.460
Synergy?

18:21.460 --> 18:24.420
Corporate synergy. Yeah. There's some corporate synergy.

18:24.420 --> 18:30.140
Well, really, this looks like a play by F5 to modernize and acquire a company that's

18:30.140 --> 18:35.900
making something that is very much relevant technologically, unlike F5, which is seemingly

18:35.900 --> 18:40.740
becoming less and less relevant as it ages. So again, there's something of a parallel

18:40.740 --> 18:43.180
with the Red Hat and IBM acquisition.

18:43.180 --> 18:47.700
Yeah, perhaps. And I wonder if maybe F5 was losing some market share to people installing

18:47.700 --> 18:53.220
NGINX boxes, in some cases doing what F5 boxes would have done in the past. So you could

18:53.220 --> 18:57.060
see how they could pretty easily tie this in with their product line. And they say in

18:57.060 --> 19:01.640
the announcement that they're keeping everything open source. This isn't going away. They're

19:01.640 --> 19:04.820
not going to change the brand name, things like that. They're keeping the brand, they're

19:04.820 --> 19:09.340
keeping it open source. The core project remains as is. And I think that alleviates some of

19:09.340 --> 19:10.340
our fears.

19:10.340 --> 19:14.820
Well, I think there are plenty of people whose fears haven't been allayed. But I just don't

19:14.820 --> 19:19.140
think it makes sense for companies to buy open source projects and then try and close

19:19.140 --> 19:23.740
them down. Because the license just doesn't let you do that. Okay, they can close down

19:23.740 --> 19:28.740
future development, but you're only going to get a fork appearing a community fork or

19:28.740 --> 19:34.580
even a company coming along and making a fork of it. So it seems very unlikely that this

19:34.580 --> 19:35.980
is bad news to me.

19:35.980 --> 19:40.100
Yeah, and you just lose so much value if you do something like that, not to mention the

19:40.100 --> 19:45.420
cost of the loss of community. It's it would be insane. It would be such a waste of money.

19:45.420 --> 19:51.780
Well, a prime example of a bit of software being forked happened this week, when Amazon

19:51.780 --> 19:54.140
launched Open Destroy for Elasticsearch.

19:54.140 --> 19:58.820
Oh, Elasticsearch. So for those of you that don't follow this stuff super closely, think

19:58.820 --> 20:03.660
of it as a distributed document oriented search that gives you analytics with a whole engine

20:03.660 --> 20:08.160
wrapped around that it supports structured and unstructured queries. And it doesn't require

20:08.160 --> 20:12.900
a schema to be defined ahead of time, which not only makes it super easy for end users,

20:12.900 --> 20:16.780
but also for developers to get a bunch of information like about analytics from web

20:16.780 --> 20:23.220
logs. And it originally launched as an open source project. And Amazon loved it, scooped

20:23.220 --> 20:29.380
it up and made their own product out of that. Now, there has been some conflict between

20:29.380 --> 20:33.820
the upstream project and Amazon over the years, there are certain things that Amazon wanted

20:33.820 --> 20:39.020
contributed to the main open source project, not just the core, and the upstream group

20:39.020 --> 20:43.840
didn't necessarily agree with that. And so now they've got this open distribution, they're

20:43.840 --> 20:50.140
calling it for Elasticsearch, which the term for distribution seems to be loose these days.

20:50.140 --> 20:57.280
It's either a series of RPMs or a Docker image that you can download. I guess that's a distribution.

20:57.280 --> 21:01.180
They're distributing it. But they write on their blog, they're going for the high ground

21:01.180 --> 21:05.320
on their blog. And it feels like it's a it's a reference to the stuff that we've seen recently

21:05.320 --> 21:11.820
with MongoDB and other license changes. They write, quote, we are seeing other examples

21:11.820 --> 21:16.700
where open source maintainers are muddying the waters between the open source community

21:16.700 --> 21:23.000
and the proprietary code they create to monetize open source at AWS. We believe that maintainers

21:23.000 --> 21:28.680
of open source projects have a responsibility to ensure the primary open source distribution

21:28.680 --> 21:34.700
remains open and free of proprietary code so that the community can build on the project

21:34.700 --> 21:41.040
freely. And the distribution does not advantage any other company over another. This was part

21:41.040 --> 21:47.300
of the promise the maintainer made when they gained the developers trust to adopt the software.

21:47.300 --> 21:49.560
Doesn't that sound like they're taking a bit of a moral high ground here?

21:49.560 --> 21:55.360
Well, they're certainly trying, aren't they? But it's a complicated one, isn't it? Because

21:55.360 --> 22:00.080
Amazon is making all this money from free and open source software. And so it's in their

22:00.080 --> 22:06.240
interests for it to be freely available for them to use and make money. Meanwhile, they're

22:06.240 --> 22:11.520
not really contributing much back to a lot of the stuff. And that's why we've seen with

22:11.520 --> 22:18.200
Redis Labs and MongoDB, them changing the license to make it proprietary to stop Amazon

22:18.200 --> 22:19.880
making money.

22:19.880 --> 22:24.160
Amazon says it creates uncertainty about the longevity of open source projects with their

22:24.160 --> 22:28.380
customers. They say customers also want their freedom to run the software anywhere and self

22:28.380 --> 22:33.560
support at any point in time. And Amazon wants to help them do that, especially the run anywhere

22:33.560 --> 22:38.480
work. That's why they've decided to partner with Expedia and Netflix to create a new open

22:38.480 --> 22:44.800
source distribution of Elasticsearch. So now Amazon is taking this Apache licensed Elastic

22:44.800 --> 22:49.880
project, adding in their own stuff and shipping it as their own version now.

22:49.880 --> 22:53.880
Yeah, and effectively competing with the proprietary version because they're talking about putting

22:53.880 --> 22:57.000
these features in that Elastic are charging for.

22:57.000 --> 23:01.220
Right. And everything that Amazon says in the core version that they're releasing is

23:01.220 --> 23:06.920
going to be Apache 2.0 license, which includes, like you said, components that compete with

23:06.920 --> 23:13.760
the commercial version of Elasticsearch. That's aggressive. And I went and checked it out

23:13.760 --> 23:19.100
and it is really easy to get going. Like it has nice UIs. It uses some projects that people

23:19.100 --> 23:23.800
are familiar with to get clear, simple metrics set up. It's competitive.

23:23.800 --> 23:30.000
But it's yet another example of how the open core business model is just not really working

23:30.000 --> 23:36.160
anymore. Because who is going to pay for these proprietary add-ons if there's an open source

23:36.160 --> 23:39.120
version that's equivalent in terms of features?

23:39.120 --> 23:44.240
Yeah. And the fact that the upstream maintainer is Amazon in association with Expedia and

23:44.240 --> 23:51.160
Netflix, that just adds some credibility to the project. And if I was a CTO or a CIO looking

23:51.160 --> 23:57.680
at implementing something on a large scale in my company, that would grab my attention.

23:57.680 --> 24:01.640
I wouldn't be beyond that. That's notable that that's something Amazon's maintaining

24:01.640 --> 24:05.040
and it would figure they're maintaining it because they run it on their own system. So

24:05.040 --> 24:10.280
they have a long-term business interest in keeping it competitive.

24:10.280 --> 24:14.600
I can't help but feel a little sad for the open source projects where this is happening

24:14.600 --> 24:19.860
to. At the same time, in each case, you can point at examples where they messed with their

24:19.860 --> 24:25.120
license or they blurred the lines between what was open source and what was commercial.

24:25.120 --> 24:29.500
And it has led to this. Of course, you can't expect these projects to be perfect and everybody's

24:29.500 --> 24:34.240
learning as they go. But in all of these examples, there are key moments you can go back and

24:34.240 --> 24:39.200
say, that was a mistake. It would just be nice to see someone compile all of that into

24:39.200 --> 24:43.540
a master list of lessons learned for projects like this.

24:43.540 --> 24:49.480
Open source projects need a business model. And it seems that this business model is just

24:49.480 --> 24:55.960
not working anymore. And so either we're going to have to learn the lessons, as you say,

24:55.960 --> 25:02.360
and find some new business models, or we're just not going to have any more big open source

25:02.360 --> 25:06.200
projects like this appearing, which I don't think will happen. I think they will find

25:06.200 --> 25:09.920
new business models, but I just can't think of what they will be.

25:09.920 --> 25:17.560
Let me tell you about my friend, the subscription based service, Joe. I mean, but maybe actually.

25:17.560 --> 25:22.900
This last story we have in the show notes, I can't wrap my head around it. When you figure

25:22.900 --> 25:27.940
in like Fuchsia and everything else going on with Chrome OS, I don't know where this

25:27.940 --> 25:29.500
next story fits.

25:29.500 --> 25:35.160
This is the fact that in the recently released Android Q beta, you could toggle on a desktop

25:35.160 --> 25:36.160
mode.

25:36.160 --> 25:42.640
Yeah. And then that also turns on the freeform multi window mode. You get a status navigation

25:42.640 --> 25:48.080
bar at the bottom of the screen. You can set a custom wallpaper. I mean, it's like a like

25:48.080 --> 25:50.200
a baby Chrome OS desktop.

25:50.200 --> 25:55.720
Well, Google is always one to hedge its bets, right? How many chat applications have they

25:55.720 --> 26:00.000
had over the years, for example, and they often run concurrently before they finally

26:00.000 --> 26:06.120
kill it. And this is just their hedge, isn't it? They've basically got three OSs now, two

26:06.120 --> 26:09.200
of which are potential desktop operating systems.

26:09.200 --> 26:14.360
We don't know what's going to happen with Fuchsia. It could end up being the basis of

26:14.360 --> 26:21.520
a desktop OS or a mobile OS or I think more likely IoT stuff. But they've also got Android

26:21.520 --> 26:25.200
things. I mean, it's just the typical Google mess, isn't it? I think that when you get

26:25.200 --> 26:30.520
enough talented people in enough different departments, they're going to sort of compete

26:30.520 --> 26:36.840
internally, which is probably actually better for the final product that wins out.

26:36.840 --> 26:42.640
That is likely what it is. It just has my mind spinning. It makes me question the looming

26:42.640 --> 26:48.200
Fuchsia release. It makes me suspect perhaps Android is going to be around in many forms

26:48.200 --> 26:55.400
much longer. It also has me wondering if perhaps Android becomes their partners operating system

26:55.400 --> 27:00.640
and Fuchsia is Google's operating system, sort of like they're doing right now on the

27:00.640 --> 27:06.360
Google Home. Google Home uses the Chromecast operating system. But if you're Lenovo or

27:06.360 --> 27:11.940
another vendor like JBL that's making a smart Google Assistant display, well then you get

27:11.940 --> 27:16.120
Android of things. You don't get the same OS Google's using. Maybe we're going to see

27:16.120 --> 27:22.380
this kind of thing with Android and Chrome OS and Fuchsia. Who knows? Or most likely

27:22.380 --> 27:26.120
it's just what you say, Joe. It's a bunch of talented people in different areas and

27:26.120 --> 27:31.600
they're all just kind of hashing it out and the fittest wins. But it is fascinating to

27:31.600 --> 27:36.140
see this because it's baked right into Android Q. If you go out and get the betas right now

27:36.140 --> 27:40.840
on a Pixel 3 device, you flip a few settings that we have linked in the show notes and

27:40.840 --> 27:45.880
you can use this today. You can hook your Pixel up to a HDMI display, get yourself a

27:45.880 --> 27:51.840
Bluetooth keyboard and mouse and you've got a convergent Android based desktop right now.

27:51.840 --> 27:55.560
Well this is something they've been working on for an awfully long time. The free form

27:55.560 --> 28:00.800
Windows have been around since Android 7 and Android Q, of course, is the 10th version.

28:00.800 --> 28:06.280
So we're kind of three iterations along. So it feels like this has just been in the works

28:06.280 --> 28:12.940
for forever. So maybe once they committed to it, they just kept rolling on with it and

28:12.940 --> 28:18.020
didn't tell that department to knock it off. Who knows really? Who knows how the internals

28:18.020 --> 28:25.320
of Google works? But to me, it seems that this competition idea is the most likely explanation

28:25.320 --> 28:28.840
for it. That's how I would run a company if I had all the money in the world like Google

28:28.840 --> 28:32.720
does because you're just going to get better products as a result of that. If people in

28:32.720 --> 28:36.880
your own company are competing against each other in a friendly way where they can still

28:36.880 --> 28:42.560
help each other as well, it's got to be good for innovation. It's like the whole open source

28:42.560 --> 28:49.480
thing, Gnome versus Plasma. It's not really a competition, is it? And they do help each

28:49.480 --> 28:53.380
other out where they can and they have a good relationship, but it does ultimately drive

28:53.380 --> 28:54.920
innovation forward for both of them.

28:54.920 --> 29:02.240
Yeah, that makes sense. It seems expensive, but it makes sense and kind of makes me want

29:02.240 --> 29:07.120
Android Q. I kind of want that update on my Pixel 3 and I want to try it out. And you'll

29:07.120 --> 29:10.560
remember one of the other things we've talked about that they're working on is the ability

29:10.560 --> 29:15.680
to run multiple applications side by side at the same time. Traditionally, one of the

29:15.680 --> 29:20.840
applications pauses, whichever application isn't in focus pauses. And one of the features

29:20.840 --> 29:24.080
they're also working on is that you can have multiple applications running at the same

29:24.080 --> 29:29.040
time without pausing. That all seems like it all's playing into using Android as a desktop.

29:29.040 --> 29:36.360
I wonder if we'll actually see this matched up with a hardware device, a laptop type device,

29:36.360 --> 29:41.560
you know, a Chromebook running Android. Where does this go? Who knows, Joe? Maybe it starts

29:41.560 --> 29:42.560
with foldables.

29:42.560 --> 29:47.960
Well, the logical place for this feature would be on a tablet with a keyboard and touchpad

29:47.960 --> 29:52.960
attachment. So I wouldn't be at all surprised to see one of those come out fairly soon with

29:52.960 --> 29:56.200
this feature being touted as the reason to buy it.

29:56.200 --> 30:00.420
Another hot prediction here on the Linux Action News program. And you might be right. Go check

30:00.420 --> 30:06.240

30:06.240 --> 30:09.720
a few extra links in there for additional information and details about some of the

30:09.720 --> 30:15.180

30:20.360 --> 30:25.480
And as you probably know, Linux Fest Northwest is nearly here, April 26th through the 28th,
