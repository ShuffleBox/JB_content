00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,200
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News.

2
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:08,240
Episode 148, recorded on March 8, 2020.

3
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:09,240
I'm Chris.

4
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:10,240
And I'm Joe.

5
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:11,240
Hello, Joe.

6
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:12,240
Good to be connected with you.

7
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:14,280
Let's start with news from Let's Encrypt this week.

8
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:18,480
Yeah, this is a story that developed throughout the week because originally, Let's Encrypt

9
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:23,920
said that due to a bug, they were going to have to revoke 3 million certificates, and

10
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:27,720
they were going to do it very quickly within a couple of days.

11
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:33,760
But then a couple of days went by, and they realized that they would end up revoking 1.3

12
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:37,880
million certificates that people hadn't replaced.

13
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:43,640
And so now they've delayed that revocation, and they've been quite vague about it.

14
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:48,020
It's interesting because they had the data to see, oh, people are not taking action here.

15
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:51,400
This all goes back to a pretty simple bug in Boulder, which is Let's Encrypt's automated

16
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:53,800
certificate management environment.

17
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:58,520
I'm no Go developer, but I guess it's a very common bug in Go, taking a reference to a

18
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:00,180
loop iterator variable.

19
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:06,800
And that bug, that simple bug meant if a subscriber validated a domain name at time X, and the

20
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:12,840
CAA records for that domain at time X allowed Let's Encrypt's insurance, that subscriber

21
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:18,760
would be able to issue a certificate containing that domain name for X plus 30 days.

22
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:23,900
Even if some time later, someone installed a record on the domain name that prohibited

23
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:27,340
its insurance by Let's Encrypt at a later point, if it had already been issued, it was

24
00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:29,860
too late, it'd be considered valid.

25
00:01:29,860 --> 00:01:34,840
The funny thing is, the code fix was deployed in about two hours after they discovered the

26
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:35,840
bug.

27
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:36,840
So it really got fixed fast.

28
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:41,640
It's just the issue is at that scale, you're talking about millions of certificates, and

29
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:44,600
it takes a while for people to get the word and to fix it.

30
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:49,060
Well, just last week, they announced that they'd issued a billion certificates total.

31
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:54,440
This has really taken off for Let's Encrypt, it has done exactly what they wanted.

32
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:58,360
It's made HTTPS the default across the web.

33
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:05,000
And so bugs like this are quite wide reaching now, and have caused quite a bit of upset.

34
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:10,400
Yeah, if you think this might impact you, I encourage you to check out our link at linuxactionnews.com

35
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:11,400
slash 148.

36
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:14,440
It'll be towards the very top of the show notes.

37
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:18,920
I feel like we should have a special segment in the show for what's the latest Intel hardware

38
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:20,520
vulnerability.

39
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:22,620
Because this week, we've got another one.

40
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:25,520
Are you feeling the Intel fatigue yet, folks?

41
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:31,480
Yeah, virtually all Intel chips released in the past five years contain an unfixable flaw

42
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:36,400
that would allow a sophisticated and I underscore that word attack to defeat a host of security

43
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,160
measures that have been built in.

44
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:42,560
Intel has issued patches to lessen the damage of the exploits and make them even harder

45
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,740
to actually take advantage of.

46
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:49,680
But a security firm named Positive Technology said the mitigations are not enough to protect

47
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,600
a system fully.

48
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:57,160
These flaws reside in that converged security and management engine, a subsystem of Intel

49
00:02:57,160 --> 00:03:02,240
CPUs and chipsets that's roughly like AMD's platform security processor.

50
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:06,300
We'll have a link to an Ars Technica article that was done by Dan Gooden that goes into

51
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:07,300
more details.

52
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:08,300
It's a good write up.

53
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:13,240
So this CSME, which is often a contention point for people, implements a firmware based

54
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:15,480
trusted platform module.

55
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:20,840
Lots of tools and even things like UFI BIOS firmware take advantage of this.

56
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:23,560
Microsoft's BitLocker is another example.

57
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:28,080
The bug stems from a failure of input and output memory management.

58
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:31,600
Kind of simple on the surface, but actually exploiting that's pretty tough.

59
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:32,880
I think that's the key here.

60
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:36,840
And it's like with a lot of the other hardware vulnerabilities that we're seeing in Intel

61
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:38,520
processors.

62
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:39,520
It's theoretical.

63
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:46,640
Yes, it's concerning, but is anyone actually taking advantage of this?

64
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:47,640
Probably not.

65
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:52,320
And if so, it's extremely targeted attacks, maybe by governments or something.

66
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:57,880
But I don't think this is going to be widely exploited in the wild.

67
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:02,080
That's my take on it, although there is the look of this at this point.

68
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:05,880
It's a problem from them from a brand standpoint.

69
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:10,680
And I think that will have impacts for a long time on their performance in the data center,

70
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:14,920
especially as AMD keeps making fantastic processors.

71
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:18,240
And they don't seem to be quite as impacted by these vulnerabilities.

72
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:22,760
It opens up a big window of vulnerability for Intel here at a time when they need that

73
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:24,600
data center sale more than ever.

74
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:28,260
And it's not only AMD coming after them in the data center.

75
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:29,960
Look what's happening with ARM.

76
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:37,360
This week, we saw Ampere announce a new 80-core, 64-bit ARM processor that is specifically

77
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,680
targeted at the data center.

78
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:45,720
And they're claiming twice the performance of x86 per watt, which does not look good

79
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:48,760
for Intel long term if this is where we're going with ARM.

80
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:49,760
It's not just them.

81
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:50,760
There's Marvell, too.

82
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:53,160
They have a 36-core, 64-bit ARM.

83
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:55,720
But that Ampere one is really fascinating.

84
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:58,640
So 80 cores, 64-bit, yep, okay, okay.

85
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:00,680
That sounds real.

86
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:05,700
Three gigahertz turbo boost, and the chip only consumes, like you were saying, 210 watts

87
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:07,080
of power.

88
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:11,360
That is less power than a modern Xeon with a dozen cores.

89
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,320
And we're talking real numbers here.

90
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:17,580
Three gigahertz, and we're talking 80 cores on a single chip.

91
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:22,900
This is really competitive from both a performance standpoint and a power usage standpoint.

92
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:26,320
And that's why this is just a super vulnerable time for Intel right now.

93
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:30,840
But it's interesting that there's a story developing about AMD and their processors

94
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:34,040
and a new paper released by Graz University of Technology.

95
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:36,080
I think that's how you say it.

96
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:38,940
AMD have denied that it is a new vulnerability.

97
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:42,440
So we'll have to see how this works out over the next week or so.

98
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:49,000
But it does go to show that it's not necessarily just Intel who are vulnerable here and that

99
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:53,160
ARM might well come and just take over the data center.

100
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:57,000
We've been saying it for a long time, but it feels like it's actually happening now.

101
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,840
I'm skeptical still, I have to be honest with you.

102
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:07,040
Watching the server environments from the early 90s to the early 2000s to where we're

103
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:14,120
at now, one thing that's really held true is large industrial grade server side applications

104
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:17,080
rarely go through major architecture rewrites.

105
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:22,900
And you can have just these crazy legacy systems that could drug 30 years past their real viability

106
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:26,240
date simply because large enterprises don't want to change.

107
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:31,880
I think we'll be with x86 in some form or another likely for nearly the rest of our

108
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:33,000
natural lives.

109
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,180
It's just there may be way more different architectures out there.

110
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:42,000
There may be more popular architectures out there, but x86 will be here forever as all

111
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,260
of my friends out there that are still working on system 390s are probably nodding their

112
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:46,260
heads to right now.

113
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:47,260
Yeah, I suppose.

114
00:06:47,260 --> 00:06:50,720
Well, let's transition to talking a little Debian.

115
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:53,920
We have some updates for the Debian project leader in 2020.

116
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:59,200
Yeah, Sam Hartman has written quite a lengthy post explaining why he doesn't want to stand

117
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:02,000
again for the role of Debian project lead.

118
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:07,800
He writes though, I hope to be DPL again some year, but 2020 is the wrong year for me and

119
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:08,980
for the project.

120
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:14,800
So I will not nominate myself this year, but hope to do so some future year.

121
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:18,880
It sounds like he's pretty disappointed with how things have gone over the last year.

122
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:23,720
He had some quite grand ambitions and they just haven't really panned out.

123
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:29,400
He kind of is diplomatic about that and says that there's been some successes, but I think

124
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:34,040
some of the fundamental things that he wanted to deal with haven't been dealt with.

125
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:38,480
He has dragged up the system D debate again, or at least dragged it to the surface.

126
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:44,160
It sounds like it was clearly bubbling under the surface and that has not been resolved.

127
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:49,880
He tried to have this general resolution and get it solved, but that just didn't work out.

128
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:52,360
And there's also the conflict resolution aspect of that.

129
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:58,000
The system D debate within Debian several years ago really did bring out quite a lot

130
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,680
of unpleasantness.

131
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:03,720
And again, it has done this time.

132
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:09,360
And I think Sam wanted to implement some processes to deal with this conflict and have conflict

133
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:12,600
resolution and that doesn't seem to have worked out either.

134
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:17,560
Yeah, after this last year, I could completely understand why Sam wants to check out for

135
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:18,560
a bit.

136
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:23,920
Let somebody with a different set of tools and skill set step in, maybe fix some of this,

137
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:28,200
set up whatever needs to be set up to resolve issues, get things on the straight and narrow.

138
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:32,600
And then when their work's done, hand it off to somebody else who can run a healthy project.

139
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:38,280
I think it's really unfortunate that this has continued to evolve now for years and

140
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:40,520
I think it's going to impact the distribution.

141
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:46,320
But I hope, perhaps with some leadership change, somebody else can step in that maybe can resolve

142
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:49,860
things if it is even at all possible.

143
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:55,440
Which reading through Sam's post here makes me think that maybe it's dark.

144
00:08:55,440 --> 00:09:00,040
Yeah, I remember talking about this before and thinking, Oh, well, Debian has been going

145
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:06,080
for such a long time now and it'll be fine, but I'm starting to doubt that.

146
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,080
Yep.

147
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:08,080
Same.

148
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:11,720
That was the conclusion when I started reading through all of this for the show.

149
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:16,020
And there seems to be different factions setting up that are even establishing their own news

150
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:18,920
outlets to report Debian news as they see it.

151
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:26,840
It's becoming partisan and I really think it's going to damage the project.

152
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:30,940
It is in a precarious situation right now and it just seems like some sort of fork is

153
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:36,000
going to have to happen or some kind of really large understanding at a group level will

154
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
have to be achieved.

155
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,120
Well, we've already seen the fork, haven't we, with Dev1.

156
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:44,960
That was to make it completely system D free and that didn't solve it.

157
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:46,120
I thought that had solved it.

158
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:52,360
I thought that we'd kind of split the community there into those who were behind system D

159
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:55,500
and those who weren't, but that didn't work.

160
00:09:55,500 --> 00:10:01,640
And I think that there's also a broader political change that's happened, a social change that

161
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:08,860
has happened in the last five or 10 years, which has polarized the world, really.

162
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:10,920
It's polarized the discourse in the mailing list.

163
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:14,360
The mailing list conversations are heated.

164
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:22,240
I agree that there is a new vitriol and velocity to the words that people use in the mailing

165
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:24,720
list that just wasn't really present.

166
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:28,900
There was disagreements for sure, even some pretty passionate ones.

167
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:30,840
But this is at a whole new level now.

168
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:33,360
It's just really, it seems unmanageable.

169
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:38,160
I hope that you're right and someone does step up and solve all of this because with

170
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:43,000
the right communication, it may be possible and with the right leadership.

171
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,920
And I think that's our only hope here.

172
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:47,720
Someone comes along and just sorts it out.

173
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:50,840
I just wouldn't envy the person who has to do that.

174
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:55,820
And just as a quick aside while we're talking about system D, system D home D has officially

175
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:57,120
been added.

176
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:01,080
We covered that pretty extensively in Linux Unplugged recently, but it's a way to do built

177
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:04,240
in encryption and add portability to Linux home directories.

178
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:08,420
Yeah, and that comes with version 2.4.5 of system D, which has now been released, coming

179
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:09,920
to a distro near you soon.

180
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:15,240
And it's probably worth mentioning, don't worry, it's entirely optional and off by default.

181
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:18,840
So even if your distro does ship that version of system D, it doesn't mean it's using home

182
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:19,840
D.

183
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:20,840
For now.

184
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:24,200
IX Systems caught our attention this week when they announced that free NAS and true

185
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:26,840
NAS are becoming one.

186
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:32,340
With version 12 coming later on this year, there'll be true NAS core and true NAS enterprise.

187
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:36,000
And they say that that will be one image that you can install.

188
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:41,320
And then if you have a license key, then you can unlock the enterprise features.

189
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:45,480
But otherwise, you can just use the completely open source version true NAS core.

190
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:49,880
And adopting some language that the broader industry outside of our bubble is a little

191
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:51,000
more familiar with.

192
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:56,160
True NAS core provides all of the same unrestricted functionality as free NAS that is already

193
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:57,160
today.

194
00:11:57,160 --> 00:12:01,560
It's essentially full free NAS just with a new name.

195
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:06,520
You can even if you want in the UI, change an option so that we still see the free NAS

196
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:07,520
logo.

197
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:12,160
And then you get what they consider more enterprise features when you license and that's things

198
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:16,760
to do with fiber channel, some certain high availability features, and other encryption

199
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:18,880
features outside the standard CFS set.

200
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:23,680
See, I think it's a smart move more from a developer resources standpoint, just unifying

201
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:28,320
their work on one product, not taking free NAS and then setting a bunch of dedicated

202
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:33,320
work to make it true NAS just one product with the base being free NAS.

203
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:38,480
I almost wonder if free NAS isn't the stronger brand overall, but obviously they know better

204
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:40,680
and decided true NAS is the route to go.

205
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:46,560
Well, that's for commercial reasons, because free sounds like it's no cost and therefore

206
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:51,320
terrible in the enterprise that that's why we have open source, right?

207
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:56,120
Because the whole free software thing not appealing to the money men back in the late

208
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:57,120
90s.

209
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,120
Right.

210
00:12:58,120 --> 00:12:59,880
Whereas true NAS sounds like the one true NAS.

211
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:00,880
Yeah, exactly.

212
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,400
No one can argue with that.

213
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:06,080
When this does ship and they just say right now, latter half of this year, I'm going to

214
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:07,080
give it a go.

215
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:12,920
And what I'm going to be looking for is how this line is handled between true NAS core

216
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:14,320
and true NAS enterprise.

217
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:17,920
Is it all truly open source bits just sitting there on the disk that I could get access

218
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:18,920
to?

219
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:22,160
Is there closed source bits that get downloaded and activated?

220
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:26,000
Is there closed source that ships on the ISO but just isn't enabled by default and only

221
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,240
open source is enabled by default?

222
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:30,400
These are the types of questions I have about the implementation.

223
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:34,500
Plus, as a long time on and off free NAS user, I'm just kind of curious to see where they

224
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:35,500
take it.

225
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:36,500
Sure.

226
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:38,000
Do you just delete it and install Arch?

227
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:44,480
Well, first Fedora, then Arch and then maybe Ubuntu in the future.

228
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:51,560
Yeah, then ultimately Ubuntu LTS because that makes the most sense.

229
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:56,840
You know, I love a good cryptocurrency story and Facebook's Libra is back in the news this

230
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:57,840
week.

231
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:58,840
Is this a good one though?

232
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:02,480
In fact, if anything, it kind of seems like the market's cooling and they're altering

233
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:04,860
their plans pretty significantly.

234
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:10,000
You remember that Libra was their cryptocurrency project that was announced like last June?

235
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
It's been quite a while.

236
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:15,920
Well, a new report from the information released on Tuesday suggests that Facebook will transition

237
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:21,720
to supporting both existing government backed currencies like the US dollar or the euro

238
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:24,640
and the Libra token when it is eventually launched.

239
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:28,280
But according to the information, Facebook is just going to delay a separate digital

240
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:33,000
wallet altogether and they're reducing the scope of this entire project, dialing it back

241
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,880
just like the Telegram folks had to.

242
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:38,960
So it's going to be filthy fiat currencies instead of proper blockchain, eh?

243
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:44,200
That seems to be the route they're going and the implication is they got spooked by the

244
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:47,000
regulators and they don't want to upset the regulators.

245
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,380
Well, it's not necessarily just Facebook that got spooked.

246
00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:55,180
It's all of the other payment processes like Visa that pulled out when the regulators started

247
00:14:55,180 --> 00:14:56,180
sniffing around.

248
00:14:56,180 --> 00:15:00,160
Yeah, that definitely was when things had to take a bad turn for them.

249
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:02,680
I bet this has been in the works since that moment.

250
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:07,300
Yeah, so now there's just more delay while they try and retool it, but it's not looking

251
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:11,160
like it's going to end up being what they originally wanted it to be.

252
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:12,800
It's finally happened, Joe.

253
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:19,260
I can finally run Android on iPhone hardware, as long as I'm willing to rock an iPhone 7

254
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:20,920
or an equivalent iPod touch device.

255
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:25,520
Yeah, now it was possible to run Android on the very first iPhone, but it's been a while

256
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:27,240
since you could do this.

257
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:32,600
And now Project Sandcastle has come along, which allows you to at least temporarily boot

258
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:38,080
Android 10 on the iPhone 7, which is pretty cool, I think.

259
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:39,240
This has always kind of been my dream.

260
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:44,720
I love this idea, Android on iPhone hardware, perfect.

261
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:48,380
Except for with Project Sandcastle, the way this is being done, the jailbreak that's being

262
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:54,260
used to achieve this is only persistent during the iPhone's boot time.

263
00:15:54,260 --> 00:15:59,760
It modifies the bootloader at boot, which means if you reboot the iPhone, it goes away.

264
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:03,320
Now, that could be good, because you could just get right back to using your phone.

265
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:07,700
That's probably not a bad idea, because it's not fully functional under this jailbreak.

266
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:14,440
Certain things don't work, like the LTE, the Bluetooth, the GPU, you know, kind of like

267
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:15,440
a Librem 5.

268
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:18,680
It's not fully functional, so you'd probably want to boot into a functional OS from time

269
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:19,680
to time.

270
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:22,960
But the idea is pretty great, and they'll get that stuff eventually if they stick with

271
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:23,960
it.

272
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:28,440
This is a really cool example of just hacking for the sake of it, just for the fun of it.

273
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:34,840
Although it is something of an advert, really, for a virtualization platform called Corellium,

274
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:38,840
which is run by Chris Wade and David Wang, the two guys who have done this.

275
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:42,280
But I think fair play to them, even though they're just trying to get their platform

276
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:47,660
out there and more publicity, I think being able to run Android on an iPhone, even if

277
00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:50,840
it's a few years old, that is still really cool.

278
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:52,560
It is a really cool technical feat.

279
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:56,140
There'll be a link in the show notes that explains the tweaks they made to the Android

280
00:16:56,140 --> 00:17:01,640
subsystem and the Linux kernel to make this possible, and I'm really impressed.

281
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:05,040
I don't care if they're plugging Corellium, I think it's worth it, and I'd love to see

282
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:06,960
this running on an actual physical iPhone.

283
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:11,480
Well, one of the things that made it possible was CheckRain, which is how you root iPhones

284
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:13,080
in the first place.

285
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:17,880
And because CheckRain is now supported by Linux, you can actually use a rooted Android

286
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:23,120
phone to jailbreak an iPhone without having a proper computer.

287
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:24,780
That is just so cool to me.

288
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:26,000
That is one of the great parts.

289
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:30,400
It's also the part that's not persistent through a reboot, but it's so great because like

290
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:36,860
an Android phone or tablet or a Linux box can now help you do this, and everything about

291
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:39,760
it is, it's exactly what you love.

292
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:43,480
Remember the good old days where the joke would be, what's Linux running on now?

293
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:47,280
It's like going back to that old joke, like we got Linux running on the iPhone again.

294
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:53,360
Yeah, from a Raspberry Pi Zero up to a supercomputer via even an iPhone now, Linux is everywhere.

295
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:55,740
And that's why we do a weekly news show about it.

296
00:17:55,740 --> 00:18:00,000
So be sure to go to linuxactionnews.com slash subscribe for all the ways to get new episodes.

Well, soon-ish.

302
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:12,740
Yeah, this is going to be on the 20th of June in London.

303
00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:16,700
It's a bunch of us podcasters all getting together, and there'll be some talks and maybe

304
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:22,640
some workshops during the day, starting at lunchtime until the pub kicks out.

305
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:24,240
And tickets are now available.

306
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:26,240
