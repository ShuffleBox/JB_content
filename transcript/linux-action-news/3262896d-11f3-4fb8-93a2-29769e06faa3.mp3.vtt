00:00.000 --> 00:16.200
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, our weekly take on Linux and the open source world.

00:16.200 --> 00:20.640
This is episode 46, recorded on March 25th, 2018.

00:20.640 --> 00:21.640
I'm Chris.

00:21.640 --> 00:22.640
And I'm Joe.

00:22.640 --> 00:23.640
Hello, Joe.

00:23.640 --> 00:27.720
It's good to be connected with you, and it's good to start with a bit of news that makes

00:27.720 --> 00:29.240
me smile.

00:29.240 --> 00:31.240
WebOS is not dead yet.

00:31.240 --> 00:32.240
What?

00:32.240 --> 00:33.240
WebOS?

00:33.240 --> 00:38.040
That OS from many, many years ago is not dead, and there's an open source edition now?

00:38.040 --> 00:39.480
That can't be right, can it?

00:39.480 --> 00:41.560
It is, and it's perfect.

00:41.560 --> 00:43.840
It's perfect.

00:43.840 --> 00:47.160
For some reason, it's just a little OS that won't go away.

00:47.160 --> 00:51.240
As you know, it's been bumped around a bit by HP and then over to LG.

00:51.240 --> 00:56.080
And now LG wants to expand the adoption of WebOS, and the company is working with the

00:56.080 --> 01:01.720
South Korean government to solicit business proposals to figure out how they might want

01:01.720 --> 01:03.640
to use WebOS.

01:03.640 --> 01:06.640
Did you ever have one of the HP touchpads back in the day, then?

01:06.640 --> 01:08.760
Yeah, for a limited time, for a couple of months.

01:08.760 --> 01:12.960
I played around with one before I gave it away as a gift, and I loved WebOS.

01:12.960 --> 01:15.800
I even got to play for a couple of months with a pre.

01:15.800 --> 01:17.600
Do you remember the Palm Pre?

01:17.600 --> 01:18.600
Oh, yeah.

01:18.600 --> 01:19.600
Yeah.

01:19.600 --> 01:23.120
I mean, it was a long time ago, but really, they were ahead in a lot of ways.

01:23.120 --> 01:25.920
Now, this is the WebOS open source edition.

01:25.920 --> 01:30.460
So it's not quite what you and I knew, and it's currently aimed at developers.

01:30.460 --> 01:35.240
There's an SDK available as well as instructions for building the OS and even running it on

01:35.240 --> 01:36.840
a Raspberry Pi 3.

01:36.840 --> 01:38.320
Which is what I did today.

01:38.320 --> 01:39.320
No!

01:39.320 --> 01:41.880
Oh, man, I almost got it.

01:41.880 --> 01:43.600
I tried to do this before the show, Joe.

01:43.600 --> 01:48.440
I got my Raspberry Pi set up, and I had a total SD card failure, and I wanted to try

01:48.440 --> 01:49.440
it.

01:49.440 --> 01:52.500
And I figured Joe must have done this.

01:52.500 --> 01:55.040
So tell me about it, because I was so close, Joe.

01:55.040 --> 01:58.240
I got it flashed on the SD card, I got it put in the Raspberry Pi, I got it hooked up

01:58.240 --> 02:03.760
to power and a mouse and a keyboard and my screen, and then I went to boot it and I got

02:03.760 --> 02:04.760
nothing.

02:04.760 --> 02:05.760
Oh, right.

02:05.760 --> 02:08.100
Well, did you build it yourself, though?

02:08.100 --> 02:11.680
Because that's the only instructions that are on the website that you have to build

02:11.680 --> 02:17.640
it and you have to get cloned and all the rest of it, but I went and found a pre-built

02:17.640 --> 02:21.880
image because I was not in the mood to wait four hours for it to build on my laptop.

02:21.880 --> 02:22.880
Yeah.

02:22.880 --> 02:24.560
That's exactly what I did.

02:24.560 --> 02:28.600
In fact, I'll include an extra bonus link in the show notes.

02:28.600 --> 02:33.480
Linux Action News, episode 46, so go to linuxactionnews.com, slash 46.

02:33.480 --> 02:38.720
I got a link in the show notes just after the news for the story, but maybe these images

02:38.720 --> 02:42.040
don't work because it is the one I tried, and I got nowhere.

02:42.040 --> 02:44.000
Yeah, well, it worked for me.

02:44.000 --> 02:51.320
It took a little while to boot up, but it's very limited once you get it booted.

02:51.320 --> 02:55.840
If you look in the article that we've linked to, there's only one app, really, YouTube,

02:55.840 --> 03:00.240
which kind of worked for the video, but the audio was all stuttery and just didn't work

03:00.240 --> 03:01.240
properly.

03:01.240 --> 03:02.240
What about...

03:02.240 --> 03:03.240
Well, there's a web browser.

03:03.240 --> 03:04.240
What about the web browser?

03:04.240 --> 03:09.720
The web browser wasn't in the version that I had for some reason, so I didn't get to

03:09.720 --> 03:14.920
check that out, but otherwise, it was just as the WebOS open source edition website really

03:14.920 --> 03:20.320
with just all the info about how to get involved with it, and this is very, very much aimed

03:20.320 --> 03:21.600
at developers at this stage.

03:21.600 --> 03:27.040
It's not a user-facing, a user-ready daily driver, any of that.

03:27.040 --> 03:32.280
It's for developers to hack on and companies who want to put it on devices.

03:32.280 --> 03:33.280
Yeah.

03:33.280 --> 03:40.640
At this point, you get the launcher, support for notifications, and a couple of basic system

03:40.640 --> 03:46.840
apps, like system settings, and there is supposedly a modified version of Chromium on there.

03:46.840 --> 03:48.320
So you got it closer than I did.

03:48.320 --> 03:52.600
I gave it a go, did not get that far, but it doesn't sound like I missed much yet.

03:52.600 --> 03:54.080
So it's early days, it sounds like.

03:54.080 --> 03:56.980
Yeah, but it was very slick, what I saw of it.

03:56.980 --> 03:59.260
Everything worked quite well with little animations and everything.

03:59.260 --> 04:00.280
It wasn't stuttering.

04:00.280 --> 04:02.480
It wasn't locking up and stuff.

04:02.480 --> 04:07.800
It seemed for this really bare bones OS to actually be pretty solid.

04:07.800 --> 04:13.800
So I've got quite a lot of hope for it if people can add the applications to it, but

04:13.800 --> 04:14.800
that's the thing.

04:14.800 --> 04:16.240
They don't call it WebOS for nothing.

04:16.240 --> 04:20.000
All of it's based on HTML technologies and CSS and everything.

04:20.000 --> 04:23.360
And haven't we seen that before with Firefox OS and that really didn't go anywhere, did

04:23.360 --> 04:24.360
it?

04:24.360 --> 04:25.360
Yeah.

04:25.360 --> 04:27.320
If you're just looking for web apps, I don't think it's going to be a winner.

04:27.320 --> 04:32.700
But if you're looking for an operating system to empower your Internet of Things device

04:32.700 --> 04:36.680
and you don't want to have to create some sort of complicated relationship with Google,

04:36.680 --> 04:41.200
this I could see actually being a possible market for WebOS open source edition.

04:41.200 --> 04:44.400
And I believe that's why the South Korean government sort of putting feelers out there

04:44.400 --> 04:50.080
right now saying, hey, if you got Google concerns, we've got this other Linux based OS, same

04:50.080 --> 04:54.000
kind of internals that you're all kind of hot and bothered about, but totally different

04:54.000 --> 04:56.520
licensing and totally different company.

04:56.520 --> 04:58.600
Don't worry, it's LG.

04:58.600 --> 05:00.840
Just those aspects alone could make it appealing.

05:00.840 --> 05:05.160
I mean, that's what Canonical was coming at when they were developing Ubuntu Touch

05:05.160 --> 05:09.880
is they were another Linux based OS that wasn't Google.

05:09.880 --> 05:14.680
Yeah, and there seems to be this backlash, isn't there, that people don't trust Google

05:14.680 --> 05:17.680
and they want to get away from Android if they can.

05:17.680 --> 05:22.360
But with it being just ubiquitous, it's very difficult to do so.

05:22.360 --> 05:24.880
So it's always good to see competitors in the space.

05:24.880 --> 05:25.880
Yeah.

05:25.880 --> 05:30.720
And keep in mind, there's a whole world of things that aren't necessarily mobile phones.

05:30.720 --> 05:37.120
There's televisions, there's toasters, there's wall plugs that just are Wi-Fi plugs that

05:37.120 --> 05:40.520
need to run some kind of operating system that's backed by some kind of company that's

05:40.520 --> 05:41.840
going to keep them secure.

05:41.840 --> 05:42.840
Yeah.

05:42.840 --> 05:46.380
Well, as we all know, if you've got an Internet of Things device, you're definitely going

05:46.380 --> 05:48.360
to want to run a hypervisor on it.

05:48.360 --> 05:53.880
Well, in the era of big processors, multi cores, and lots of RAM, maybe?

05:53.880 --> 05:57.720
That's what the Linux Foundation is hoping, and it's called Acorn.

05:57.720 --> 06:03.360
It's a hypervisor that's built with real time and safety critical operations in mind with

06:03.360 --> 06:07.080
a huge chunk of code contributed by Intel.

06:07.080 --> 06:10.600
This is very much aimed at the automotive market, isn't it?

06:10.600 --> 06:15.700
Which is a bit strange because there's the automotive grade Linux from the Linux Foundation.

06:15.700 --> 06:21.160
But they do stress that competition is good, and they do accept that there are various

06:21.160 --> 06:22.160
solutions here.

06:22.160 --> 06:27.120
Obviously, you've got Zen as a hypervisor, but that is relatively bloated compared to

06:27.120 --> 06:29.080
this new Acorn.

06:29.080 --> 06:34.360
They talk about how, yes, there are existing technologies that this is effectively competing

06:34.360 --> 06:39.040
against, but they say that that's a good thing, and competition will drive innovation.

06:39.040 --> 06:44.400
Think of Acorn as positioned specifically for the automotive market, and then all of

06:44.400 --> 06:49.080
a sudden, it starts to make sense why you'd want a specific hypervisor to meet those needs.

06:49.080 --> 06:53.640
You need certain scenarios to prioritize workloads when you're driving, like safety.

06:53.640 --> 06:55.800
So conventional hypervisors, they don't really do that.

06:55.800 --> 06:59.320
You can say, give more memory to this application or this machine.

06:59.320 --> 07:04.880
But you need a hypervisor that is real-time aware, that can know when to starve the entertainment

07:04.880 --> 07:09.120
system of resources in order to ensure the driver's safety, and that's what we're dealing

07:09.120 --> 07:10.120
with here.

07:10.120 --> 07:13.120
Acorn addresses these issues by being small, first of all.

07:13.120 --> 07:20.640
The project claims it'll have just 25,000 lines of code compared to, say, over 150,000

07:20.640 --> 07:23.280
lines of your most basic data center hypervisor.

07:23.280 --> 07:25.240
So number one, it's going to be a small project.

07:25.240 --> 07:29.240
But number two, it's going to be aware of the workloads that are on it specifically

07:29.240 --> 07:30.920
for embedded devices.

07:30.920 --> 07:36.180
Today, cars have several computers linked over the CAN bus system.

07:36.180 --> 07:40.840
But in the future, many cars already are being built this way, and many manufacturers are

07:40.840 --> 07:42.180
going this way.

07:42.180 --> 07:47.080
There will be a central computer, for better or worse, that runs everything.

07:47.080 --> 07:51.760
And the idea here, and there's a lot of companies like Intel that are backing this, is to run

07:51.760 --> 07:57.360
a hypervisor on that central computer and isolate the individual workloads.

07:57.360 --> 08:03.060
That arrangement would essentially mean fewer integration hassles and lower costs for automakers,

08:03.060 --> 08:07.580
and it also means that the hypervisor would be aware when safety-first issues need the

08:07.580 --> 08:12.440
priority versus you picking the next track on your MP3 files.

08:12.440 --> 08:13.820
It's funny this future, isn't it?

08:13.820 --> 08:17.400
In the past, it was a case of, if your car broke, you could get your friend who's quite

08:17.400 --> 08:21.700
handy to fix it, whereas now, you want someone who's a programming expert to come and fix

08:21.700 --> 08:22.880
your car for you.

08:22.880 --> 08:27.000
There's no denying we're moving away from the Unix philosophy when it comes to automobiles.

08:27.000 --> 08:31.480
Instead of having dozens or maybe hundreds of individual systems and components that

08:31.480 --> 08:36.520
are specifically suited for their job and make the car run well, we're moving to a centralized

08:36.520 --> 08:41.840
monolith that will have isolated components dedicated to the different aspects of the

08:41.840 --> 08:42.840
car.

08:42.840 --> 08:43.840
I'm not sure which one's better.

08:43.840 --> 08:48.280
And it's good to see Linux and open source being at the forefront of this new way of

08:48.280 --> 08:49.280
doing things.

08:49.280 --> 08:56.160
I'd much rather the Linux Foundation was doing this than some other big company that doesn't

08:56.160 --> 08:57.960
care about open source.

08:57.960 --> 09:03.220
When it comes to problems front and center in your face, a lot of us have been experiencing

09:03.220 --> 09:09.080
issues with Gnome Shell recently, and there's been additional attention on this this week.

09:09.080 --> 09:10.080
I'll put it that way.

09:10.080 --> 09:16.400
Yeah, so Joey over at IMG Ubuntu has posted about this memory leak, which, haven't you

09:16.400 --> 09:20.880
been talking about this for months and months and months with your OBS machine needing to

09:20.880 --> 09:22.600
be rebooted all the time?

09:22.600 --> 09:23.600
It's been bad, yeah.

09:23.600 --> 09:24.600
It's been ridiculous.

09:24.600 --> 09:30.160
In fact, anybody that's used Gnome Shell with some regularity has probably run into this

09:30.160 --> 09:31.600
particular problem.

09:31.600 --> 09:36.460
It really essentially begins when you first do something that creates an animation, like

09:36.460 --> 09:39.380
hitting the overview screen or all the applications.

09:39.380 --> 09:41.460
It just starts slowing down from there.

09:41.460 --> 09:47.000
One of the many reasons I don't like animations, but even so, it doesn't happen in plasma and

09:47.000 --> 09:48.000
stuff, does it?

09:48.000 --> 09:49.380
No, no, it doesn't.

09:49.380 --> 09:53.960
It seems to be kind of related to how Gnome Shell is built, being single-processed, all

09:53.960 --> 09:59.640
kind of one process doing everything, and Joey over at IMG Ubuntu sort of laid it all

09:59.640 --> 10:00.640
out.

10:00.640 --> 10:04.800
Gnome Shell, right out of the box, will typically consume somewhere around 70 megabytes of RAM.

10:04.800 --> 10:07.480
I mean, not bad, really, considering how much it does.

10:07.480 --> 10:14.640
However, that jumps to about 95 megabytes of RAM after opening a menu, and maybe 250

10:14.640 --> 10:20.520
megabytes depending after you load, say, the icon grid of all applications with about 90

10:20.520 --> 10:21.520
icons.

10:21.520 --> 10:26.960
And this will get worse if you have more extensions or more icons or more things happening with

10:26.960 --> 10:28.040
the Gnome Shell.

10:28.040 --> 10:31.920
And this has somewhat been patched, but it doesn't seem to have quite worked.

10:31.920 --> 10:32.920
Yes.

10:32.920 --> 10:35.940
Now, there is a workaround, and Joey does mention it in the post here, and it's just

10:35.940 --> 10:37.560
simply to restart Gnome Shell.

10:37.560 --> 10:38.560
And you know how to do this.

10:38.560 --> 10:44.040
You hit Alt-F2, type in R, hit Enter, boom, Gnome Shell will restart, and you don't tend

10:44.040 --> 10:47.040
to lose application state, but it's very fiddly.

10:47.040 --> 10:50.240
Yeah, that's not really an acceptable fix, is it?

10:50.240 --> 10:51.840
Or at least it shouldn't be.

10:51.840 --> 10:54.360
And it's not the only bug that surfaced this week.

10:54.360 --> 11:00.080
There's also this performance bug relating to the clock, where just changing the digits

11:00.080 --> 11:02.680
of the clock causes slowdowns.

11:02.680 --> 11:06.800
I mean, you really wonder what is going on with Gnome Shell.

11:06.800 --> 11:09.880
I mean, I'm so happy I'm sitting here on XFCE.

11:09.880 --> 11:11.040
Oh, here we go.

11:11.040 --> 11:14.320
Of course, it's a moment to talk about XFCE, because there's no other desktop that can

11:14.320 --> 11:15.320
get this right.

11:15.320 --> 11:17.240
So this is really something.

11:17.240 --> 11:19.360
And I've noticed this myself.

11:19.360 --> 11:24.160
And the bug that I've linked in the show notes, again, linuxactionnews.com slash 46 calls

11:24.160 --> 11:25.160
it out.

11:25.160 --> 11:26.160
You may have noticed this too.

11:26.160 --> 11:31.680
If you went into the Gnome clock settings and turned on the show seconds, which I have

11:31.680 --> 11:36.560
done because I am on air and want to time things very precisely.

11:36.560 --> 11:40.240
So I've turned on the show seconds, I have it turned on in plasma right now, I'm looking

11:40.240 --> 11:42.940
at the seconds, it's a useful thing.

11:42.940 --> 11:49.080
And it turns out that involves a massive redraw of the entire desktop to iterate the second

11:49.080 --> 11:50.300
counter.

11:50.300 --> 11:55.600
And the bug doesn't go this far, but I have personally experienced every extension you

11:55.600 --> 12:00.220
have that is updating the UI is updating the entire UI.

12:00.220 --> 12:03.280
Because the Gnome shell is a single process.

12:03.280 --> 12:09.280
The entire desktop from the extensions to the animations is all one process.

12:09.280 --> 12:13.580
And so I was in a point where I had, I love it, an extension that would tell me my ping

12:13.580 --> 12:18.780
milliseconds and an extension that would tell me the Bitcoin price and an extension that

12:18.780 --> 12:21.060
would tell me my CPU usage.

12:21.060 --> 12:23.960
And I had the clock with the seconds displayed.

12:23.960 --> 12:28.720
Because I assumed in 2017, I could have a modern desktop.

12:28.720 --> 12:35.200
I was wrong, 2018 has been a year of learning for me, but 2017 was a year of being wrong.

12:35.200 --> 12:41.160
And what I discovered was every single extension I had that was updating my Gnome shell with

12:41.160 --> 12:47.920
current information, like the CPU, like the Bitcoin price, like my ping millisecond response

12:47.920 --> 12:53.600
time, like the seconds on my clock, were all dramatically slowing down my desktop.

12:53.600 --> 13:03.120
To the point where my mouse cursor began to pause as I moved it around the screen.

13:03.120 --> 13:05.080
Suddenly your mouse turned into Shatner.

13:05.080 --> 13:08.600
Yeah, I had the William Shatner of mouse curses when I was on Gnome 3.

13:08.600 --> 13:13.400
And the only temporary fix was to disable the very extensions that I found made the

13:13.400 --> 13:14.400
shell usable.

13:14.400 --> 13:16.580
Well, come on, this isn't a huge problem.

13:16.580 --> 13:24.960
It's not like every single major distro is using Gnome at this point.

13:24.960 --> 13:27.200
Linux Academy.com slash unplugged.

13:27.200 --> 13:31.000
It's an advanced training tool that increases your skills and encourages critical thinking

13:31.000 --> 13:33.400
around everything that has to do with Linux.

13:33.400 --> 13:37.480
It's a full featured training library with everything you need to learn new skills and

13:37.480 --> 13:42.120
advance your career from Azure down to how to build the file system outright.

13:42.120 --> 13:47.080
It's a great resource with self-paced in-depth video courses on every Linux and cloud and

13:47.080 --> 13:52.060
DevOps topic with hands-on scenario-based labs that give you real experience on actual

13:52.060 --> 13:56.300
servers that you get to SSH into, which makes all of the difference for somebody like me.

13:56.300 --> 14:00.200
And if you ever get stuck, if you need help, they have full-time human instructors that

14:00.200 --> 14:02.860
are ready to help and advise you on your questions.

14:02.860 --> 14:05.400
And if life is busy, Linux Academy understands.

14:05.400 --> 14:09.120
They've got a course scheduler where you can pick a course and set a timeframe to help

14:09.120 --> 14:12.480
fit your schedule and your learning goals.

14:12.480 --> 14:17.680
Now I love a certain aspect of Linux Academy that I failed to mention and I want to mention

14:17.680 --> 14:18.680
it today.

14:18.680 --> 14:21.760
They have a flashcard system that is completely open source.

14:21.760 --> 14:23.840
It's something that's forked by the community.

14:23.840 --> 14:28.280
And using these flashcards help you remember what you learned because you're presented

14:28.280 --> 14:31.160
with the information in a different order every time.

14:31.160 --> 14:33.000
It just kind of comes at you randomly.

14:33.000 --> 14:36.920
And you can share the flashcards that have worked best for you and the whole deck if

14:36.920 --> 14:38.200
it's been a good deck.

14:38.200 --> 14:42.600
And use those cards and decks by yourself, by the instructors, and the students and mix

14:42.600 --> 14:43.600
and match them.

14:43.600 --> 14:47.000
It's a whole aspect of the community that I think really helps you prepare because people

14:47.000 --> 14:51.600
that go take the tests and pass them come back and share their experience and help you

14:51.600 --> 14:52.600
prepare.

14:52.600 --> 14:54.600
That's a great resource that nobody can touch.

14:54.600 --> 14:57.680
You combine that with the full-time human beings, the servers they spin up, and the

14:57.680 --> 15:01.200
endless content, linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

Nothing beats it, linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

15:11.620 --> 15:17.200
So it's been a bit of a bad week for Mozilla and Firefox, specifically with the master

15:17.200 --> 15:24.080
password, which it turns out for the last nine years has been using SHA-1 with an iteration

15:24.080 --> 15:26.120
count of one.

15:26.120 --> 15:30.800
So this is the master password that protects all of your saved logins, if you choose to

15:30.800 --> 15:33.080
enable it, of course.

15:33.080 --> 15:38.720
And it is very, very easy to brute force unless it is incredibly long.

15:38.720 --> 15:44.040
Yeah, this came out after the author of the Adblock Plus extension looked into this a

15:44.040 --> 15:45.040
little bit.

15:45.040 --> 15:49.240
He says, I looked into the source code and I eventually found the function that converts

15:49.240 --> 15:53.760
passwords into encrypted keys, and it's not nearly enough.

15:53.760 --> 15:57.840
Anybody who's designed a login function for our website will likely see the red flags

15:57.840 --> 15:59.880
here from about nine years ago.

15:59.880 --> 16:04.680
In fact, Mozilla themselves have had a bug against this since they implemented this feature

16:04.680 --> 16:06.040
nine years ago.

16:06.040 --> 16:12.120
Yeah, and using SHA-1 in the first place, I think it was a year or two ago, Google proved

16:12.120 --> 16:17.420
that you can have SHA-1 collisions, which basically renders it MD5 quality at this point.

16:17.420 --> 16:24.120
And to only do one iteration of it when standard practice would be 10,000 or maybe 100,000,

16:24.120 --> 16:26.280
that is not good at all.

16:26.280 --> 16:29.760
What's the point if you're only going to do SHA-1 times one?

16:29.760 --> 16:33.880
In the age of everyone having a GPU everywhere, it gets a lot easier to crack these.

16:33.880 --> 16:38.440
Yeah, you'd think they'd be using SHA-256 or something at this point, but they've got

16:38.440 --> 16:41.160
a different plan to solve this instead, haven't they?

16:41.160 --> 16:46.680
Yeah, they're working on a couple of different plugins, and there's a few in the fire right

16:46.680 --> 16:47.680
now.

16:47.680 --> 16:51.040
And one that seems to have the most promise is Lockbox.

16:51.040 --> 16:53.160
It's being developed by Mozilla as an extension.

16:53.160 --> 16:57.640
It is alpha quality right now, but it's a total replacement for the Firefox password

16:57.640 --> 16:58.640
manager.

16:58.640 --> 17:01.840
So really, who isn't using LastPass at this point?

17:01.840 --> 17:05.920
You know, I, as a longtime LastPass user, have recently become more and more frustrated

17:05.920 --> 17:06.920
with it.

17:06.920 --> 17:10.800
I would be interested in switching off, but I tried out Lockbox for the TechSnap program

17:10.800 --> 17:13.520
recently because we talked about this on TechSnap.

17:13.520 --> 17:14.520
Totally not there yet.

17:14.520 --> 17:15.520
Not ready.

17:15.520 --> 17:19.520
In fact, Mozilla hasn't even committed to Lockbox as the future master password extension.

17:19.520 --> 17:22.960
Yeah, you would have thought that Mozilla would have sorted this out by now.

17:22.960 --> 17:26.700
I mean, it's been long enough, and they've got enough money sloshing around.

17:26.700 --> 17:32.080
You think that they would have their own built-in competitor to the likes of LastPass?

17:32.080 --> 17:35.400
I know there are open source alternatives, but it'd be nice if there was something just

17:35.400 --> 17:36.400
baked into Firefox.

17:36.400 --> 17:39.680
I mean, they've got Pocket in there.

17:39.680 --> 17:43.640
Maybe before they did stuff like that, they should have thought about some security fundamentals.

17:43.640 --> 17:47.040
Yeah, I do think it's better to outsource this particular function.

17:47.040 --> 17:50.380
As Wes pointed out on TechSnap, it's not like Firefox has been built from the ground up

17:50.380 --> 17:53.040
to be a password manager.

17:53.040 --> 17:56.480
And maybe we shouldn't expect that from our web browsers, and we should offload that to

17:56.480 --> 17:58.260
a dedicated application.

17:58.260 --> 18:02.400
And so I like the idea of Lockbox or KeyPass or LastPass.

18:02.400 --> 18:05.320
It's just picking the one that's best for you at this point.

18:05.320 --> 18:10.720
Yeah, but I'm always dubious of proprietary solutions, especially ones where they get

18:10.720 --> 18:13.320
their database dumped and leaked online.

18:13.320 --> 18:14.320
Hmm.

18:14.320 --> 18:17.160
Although that was a long time ago, let's not worry about that.

18:17.160 --> 18:20.380
But it's not the only Firefox story this week.

18:20.380 --> 18:26.400
There's also some changes possibly maybe coming to how they deal with DNS queries.

18:26.400 --> 18:31.440
This one's gotten a bit of pushback from privacy people, as often happens with these kinds

18:31.440 --> 18:34.920
of announcements when they're doing something that involves sending your data to a third

18:34.920 --> 18:35.920
party.

18:35.920 --> 18:41.060
Now, Firefox is experimenting with a certain amount of test users with sending DNS lookups

18:41.060 --> 18:46.320
to a Cloudflare hosted service, which means a third party that you did not configure your

18:46.320 --> 18:47.320
system to go to.

18:47.320 --> 18:51.800
Now, obviously, DNS is a pretty critical point to loading websites and getting them to respond

18:51.800 --> 18:52.800
fast.

18:52.800 --> 18:55.840
And now more than ever, DNS seems to be getting screwed around with, manipulated as a form

18:55.840 --> 18:56.840
of attack.

18:56.840 --> 19:02.500
And DNS services are also sometimes just simply poorly provisioned, creating performance problems.

19:02.500 --> 19:04.680
So Firefox thought they could solve this issue.

19:04.680 --> 19:05.680
Yeah.

19:05.680 --> 19:12.240
And in theory, it sounds good, doesn't it, DNS over HTTPS so that it's properly protected.

19:12.240 --> 19:14.600
But why bring Cloudflare into it?

19:14.600 --> 19:18.680
Well, they're definitely a name brand, and they definitely have the services and the

19:18.680 --> 19:20.960
infrastructure to support something like this.

19:20.960 --> 19:22.760
I mean, think about Firefox's scale.

19:22.760 --> 19:26.160
Even with a small test, you're probably still dealing with hundreds of thousands, maybe

19:26.160 --> 19:27.160
even a million users.

19:27.160 --> 19:29.680
So you've really got to be able to handle that load.

19:29.680 --> 19:32.800
But the issue is that Cloudflare is a US backed company.

19:32.800 --> 19:37.200
But even as a user of Firefox, like Chris Dubble from New Zealand pointed out, even

19:37.200 --> 19:41.620
if it's only Mozilla's nightly browser, and just for a short period of time, he's still

19:41.620 --> 19:49.280
disturbed at the possibility of an opt out only service, sending all visited host names

19:49.280 --> 19:52.060
to a third party US company.

19:52.060 --> 19:53.360
That he's uncomfortable with.

19:53.360 --> 19:56.000
Yeah, and it is only in the nightly at the moment.

19:56.000 --> 20:01.360
But the nightlies tend to be where the features that end up in the main version go.

20:01.360 --> 20:06.360
So if this goes well for them, the chances are it probably will make it into the main

20:06.360 --> 20:07.840
Firefox.

20:07.840 --> 20:12.760
So I think it is right to be raising this as a red flag right now.

20:12.760 --> 20:19.640
But Mozilla do point out that they are only testing this and user feedback like this is

20:19.640 --> 20:20.680
valuable to them.

20:20.680 --> 20:26.240
So hopefully, they will get the message and it will hopefully only be a few hundred thousand

20:26.240 --> 20:30.840
people or whatever a small percentage of the nightly users who will ever have this happen

20:30.840 --> 20:34.840
to them, at least to have it be opt out.

20:34.840 --> 20:39.960
By all means have it be opt in and if you're happy sending all your DNS queries to Cloudflare,

20:39.960 --> 20:40.960
then good luck to you.

20:40.960 --> 20:42.760
But I don't think I'll be opting in.

20:42.760 --> 20:43.760
Thank you very much.

20:43.760 --> 20:47.320
I do understand where Mozilla is coming from because they have to compete with Google who

20:47.320 --> 20:52.840
can afford to accelerate all kinds of things server side even offer to proxy every single

20:52.840 --> 20:57.520
user's traffic and recompress it and save on bandwidth for them.

20:57.520 --> 21:01.680
So that's what they're competing against is an entity that has almost unlimited server

21:01.680 --> 21:03.800
side capabilities with Chrome.

21:03.800 --> 21:09.120
And that's just going to become more and more apparent as Chrome and Firefox develop.

21:09.120 --> 21:14.280
Well another way the Mozilla is copying Google, or you could say Firefox following in crimes

21:14.280 --> 21:18.400
footsteps is that they might well start blocking some adverts.

21:18.400 --> 21:23.440
Yeah, it appears that Mozilla intends to add basic ad filtering capabilities to its Firefox

21:23.440 --> 21:25.400
browser later on this year.

21:25.400 --> 21:28.840
That would be at least according to a development roadmap.

21:28.840 --> 21:34.560
Over the next year or so, Firefox will take a stand against trafficking, intrusive ads,

21:34.560 --> 21:38.480
and of course, dark patterns on the web, as they put it.

21:38.480 --> 21:41.560
Do you feel that they're a little bit late to the party on this one?

21:41.560 --> 21:42.560
Yes.

21:42.560 --> 21:46.560
And it's a little awkward, like the language they're using here is a little suspicious.

21:46.560 --> 21:51.360
They're not using the term ad blocking, they're using the term ad filtering.

21:51.360 --> 21:57.500
And content blocking versus content filtering are two totally different things.

21:57.500 --> 22:01.640
Ad filtering makes it sound like somebody is going to be taking an active role in deciding

22:01.640 --> 22:04.640
what is a bad ad versus a good ad.

22:04.640 --> 22:08.780
Which is an almost impossible task to have a human in the loop.

22:08.780 --> 22:12.840
And even if you have an algorithm, that's not necessarily going to do a perfect job,

22:12.840 --> 22:13.840
is it?

22:13.840 --> 22:18.320
So the register tried to sort all of this out and they emailed the Firefox product manager

22:18.320 --> 22:25.040
and he wrote back and Peter said that the roadmap describes future plans, some of which

22:25.040 --> 22:29.200
are still in early development, so don't get too set on any of them.

22:29.200 --> 22:35.180
He says, we are researching and in some cases developing various methods of blocking invasive

22:35.180 --> 22:36.940
forms of advertising.

22:36.940 --> 22:42.540
This includes auto-playing videos, in-content pop-ups, and a variety of other deceptive

22:42.540 --> 22:44.240
quote-unquote practices.

22:44.240 --> 22:48.980
While these methods are based on ad and content types, their final approach will be announced

22:48.980 --> 22:50.620
at a later date.

22:50.620 --> 22:53.720
And they expect to integrate the functionality directly into Firefox when they've decided

22:53.720 --> 22:55.460
on what it is they're going to do.

22:55.460 --> 23:01.120
Well you would hope that Mozilla will be responsible with this and just block really nefarious

23:01.120 --> 23:05.800
stuff and let reasonable adverts through, but it does remain to be seen exactly how

23:05.800 --> 23:06.800
they handle it.

23:06.800 --> 23:09.480
Yeah, and what's the definition of a reasonable advert?

23:09.480 --> 23:11.560
Is my definition the same of Mozilla's?

23:11.560 --> 23:12.880
We'll just have to wait and see.

23:12.880 --> 23:15.400
And it's not the end of days yet.

23:15.400 --> 23:18.760
This is something they're going to be working out over perhaps the next year.

23:18.760 --> 23:23.760
Okay, so I've got several copies of the Bitcoin blockchain on various hard drives and this

23:23.760 --> 23:27.960
week I started to think, hmm, maybe I should delete those.

23:27.960 --> 23:29.800
I mean only if you don't want to be a pedophile.

23:29.800 --> 23:31.640
You're not a pedophile, are you, Joe?

23:31.640 --> 23:36.200
No, and I'm not a terrorist or whatever else is hiding in there.

23:36.200 --> 23:43.520
Yeah, this is based on a new research paper that's come out again and then I laugh only

23:43.520 --> 23:48.320
because I covered this story when I was doing Plan B and Plan B was before I ever launched

23:48.320 --> 23:49.360
Linux Unplugged.

23:49.360 --> 23:54.480
So this is an old story, but it keeps coming up and people keep adding more junk to the

23:54.480 --> 23:55.480
blockchain.

23:55.480 --> 23:59.840
You see, the blockchain has this whole provision for adding arbitrary data.

23:59.840 --> 24:03.920
Imagine a contract, you're signing with somebody and you want to have specific details of the

24:03.920 --> 24:09.000
contract on there, like Joe will not have any cats jumping on the recording equipment

24:09.000 --> 24:11.280
during the recordings of Linux Action News.

24:11.280 --> 24:14.580
Say we wanted to have like a, I don't know where that would come from, but say we had

24:14.580 --> 24:18.480
like a contract where that was in place and we wanted that in the blockchain, you could

24:18.480 --> 24:20.680
add arbitrary text like that.

24:20.680 --> 24:25.460
And so researchers from, well, a lot of different places, but this is a new paper as available

24:25.460 --> 24:32.960
as a PDF, have identified 1,600 files that have been added to the Bitcoin blockchain.

24:32.960 --> 24:40.240
59 of which include links to unlawful images of child exploitation, politically sensitive

24:40.240 --> 24:43.760
content, and privacy violations.

24:43.760 --> 24:46.000
This is incredibly worrying.

24:46.000 --> 24:52.320
And I genuinely am thinking about deleting the blockchain data that I've got because

24:52.320 --> 24:55.480
I just don't want to fall foul of the law.

24:55.480 --> 25:02.720
And okay, there's probably a defense there, but now people know more about this.

25:02.720 --> 25:07.180
And as you say, this was known before, but now it's resurfaced.

25:07.180 --> 25:11.360
People might be putting stuff in there just to troll people, although it is quite expensive

25:11.360 --> 25:12.560
to do that, isn't it?

25:12.560 --> 25:15.960
Yeah, there is a transaction fee potentially.

25:15.960 --> 25:20.600
I do think people are doing this just to troll folks as well.

25:20.600 --> 25:24.640
All the blockchain data, think about this for a moment, and this is why Joe's worried.

25:24.640 --> 25:30.060
All blockchain data, if you have a full wallet, is downloaded and stored by every single user.

25:30.060 --> 25:35.520
And so in some countries, they could be liable for the content that's on their own hard drive.

25:35.520 --> 25:38.080
And it could be illegal content.

25:38.080 --> 25:42.900
Now keep this in mind though, the blockchain is a text ledger.

25:42.900 --> 25:50.240
So what you are getting at absolute best is encoded links to pornography.

25:50.240 --> 25:54.000
You're not getting the actual pornography in the blockchain.

25:54.000 --> 25:59.840
You're getting an encoded sequence of hex that you then have to extract and decode and

25:59.840 --> 26:02.920
reconstruct a link and then visit that link.

26:02.920 --> 26:12.320
You say that, but it may be possible to hide binaries in there if you really wanted to.

26:12.320 --> 26:16.600
Well, and there are services, I have one linked in the show notes called Cryptography and

26:16.600 --> 26:21.780
others that essentially do the encoding and decoding for you and almost make it like a

26:21.780 --> 26:23.160
messaging service.

26:23.160 --> 26:27.080
In fact, Cryptography will just have like some of the latest messages that have been

26:27.080 --> 26:30.840
added to the blockchain as arbitrary data and you can just download them.

26:30.840 --> 26:36.080
But it does beg the question of how easy it would be for a government to put in stuff

26:36.080 --> 26:41.320
that is illegal so that they can then outlaw Bitcoin in that country.

26:41.320 --> 26:43.520
Oh, that's proper bacon right there.

26:43.520 --> 26:45.880
I mean, we got to put all of this in the context, right?

26:45.880 --> 26:56.360
So we're talking 1.4% of the roughly 251 million transactions as of this recording on the Bitcoin

26:56.360 --> 26:57.360
blockchain.

26:57.360 --> 27:02.000
So I mean, we're talking a tiny amount and then at that, it's encoded data that you have

27:02.000 --> 27:07.040
to implicitly decode and reassemble into a dirty link.

27:07.040 --> 27:12.040
I don't know really how liable anybody's going to be for that, but it does seem particularly

27:12.040 --> 27:13.040
spicy.

27:13.040 --> 27:15.940
It does seem like something that's going to get attention and it could be something that

27:15.940 --> 27:19.080
regulators opt to hone into if they feel motivated.

27:19.080 --> 27:25.200
But you know, when reading about this, that 250 million figure really jumped out at me.

27:25.200 --> 27:27.920
That's all the Bitcoin transactions ever.

27:27.920 --> 27:32.320
How many visa transactions happened during the recording of this show?

27:32.320 --> 27:36.480
Probably somewhere around 250 million, I would have thought.

27:36.480 --> 27:42.880
It really goes to show how far behind Bitcoin is in terms of actual transactions, doesn't

27:42.880 --> 27:43.880
it?

27:43.880 --> 27:45.640
Yeah, the scale of it.

27:45.640 --> 27:48.600
Now as we record, I mean, it has gone up.

27:48.600 --> 27:55.520
Right now, if you go to blockchain.info, we're somewhere around 306 million transactions.

27:55.520 --> 28:01.200
But again, how many visa transactions today happened or MasterCard or whatever?

28:01.200 --> 28:05.720
From what I understand, that's about how many transactions Visa has in a single day.

28:05.720 --> 28:07.280
Yeah, exactly.

28:07.280 --> 28:10.600
So the scale is just massively different.

28:10.600 --> 28:14.240
Yeah, but you're still a dirty bird, Joe, with all those files on your hard drive.

28:14.240 --> 28:16.000
You better start deleting those blockchains.

28:16.000 --> 28:19.000
Yeah, I'll get right on that.

28:19.000 --> 28:22.960
