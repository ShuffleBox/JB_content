00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,080
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, episode 233, recorded on March 23, 2022. I'm Chris.

2
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:13,320
Wes has the week off, so we're just doing a flash update, and let's get into the news.

3
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:17,980
And we'll start with a follow up that might really be connected to the most important

4
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:22,020
story in my opinion we covered last year in Linux, and that was the University of Minnesota's

5
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:26,740
hypocrite commits to the Linux kernel. We initially covered that in Linux Action News

6
00:00:26,740 --> 00:00:33,360
186, and now it seems we're having something of an official response from the kernel team.

7
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:38,640
The Kernels Technical Advisory Board, TAB for short, has put together a set of guidelines

8
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:43,520
for researchers who are studying how the kernel development community works or individual

9
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:49,320
projects. This document that's been created by the TAB has just actually been merged into

10
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:54,120
the main line of Linux 518, so it's actually going to be baked into the Linux kernel now.

11
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:58,280
And it's really good to see this, but here's my take on the overall document. I printed

12
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:02,360
it out, if you can hear it there. And I went through this thing, and you know, it seems

13
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:05,760
pretty reasonable. It really does kind of just sort of describe itself as a set of best

14
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:13,280
practices. There's no mechanism to enforce it necessarily. They're sort of appealing

15
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:20,040
to the researchers' goodwill, I suppose. And it calls these researchers to disclose

16
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:24,940
to a developer before a developer's project or that individual developer are targeted.

17
00:01:24,940 --> 00:01:29,720
It also asserts that these developers cannot just be targeted without some sort of consent.

18
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:34,440
And the document outlines what is expected when a researcher submits a patch to the Linux

19
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:39,200
kernel to fix whatever they might have found. And it's an extensive set of requests and

20
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:44,340
asks, including in there is if you've never submitted to the Linux kernel before, maybe

21
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:48,640
have somebody who has look at this first before you send it to us and waste our time. I mean,

22
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:51,840
they don't say that part, but it's kind of implied.

23
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:57,600
They also take some effort to link and point to ethics and research papers that have been

24
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:03,720
published before. And overall, I get it. I like it. I think it's good to see this. And

25
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:07,800
I think it's great that this actually lives in the Linux kernel. So there really can be

26
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:13,260
no missing it. I think the linchpin of this is going to be if researchers actually follow

27
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:20,120
these guidelines. But clearly, if they do, then they could expect probably a more cordial

28
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:25,240
interaction with the Linux development team than if they don't.

29
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:30,680
Activists are targeting Russians with what's been dubbed as open source protestware. And

30
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:36,480
for better or for worse, this is getting some attention thanks to an MIT research review.

31
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:42,160
They've taken a brief look at what they've dubbed as protestware from open source. And

32
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:48,620
they have come to some questionable conclusions, I'd argue, but maybe they're not wrong.

33
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:53,400
This is a quote from from their review. They say, quote, no tech firm has gone this far,

34
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:57,680
but around two dozen open source software projects have, and they've been spotted adding

35
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:03,360
code protesting the war. According to observers tracking the protest where movement, the open

36
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:08,260
source software, or I'm sorry, they say open source software is software that anyone can

37
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:14,320
modify and inspect, making it more transparent. And in this case, at least, more open to sabotage.

38
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:18,700
Okay, they might not say it dramatically like that. But they, you know, hey, open source,

39
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:24,240
it's more open to sabotage. And then they cite a couple of examples that are frankly

40
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:29,880
hard to argue with. I think the one that they cite that is the most damning is the recent

41
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:34,560
node IPC update. Node IPC helps you build neural networks. It's downloaded more than

42
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:42,640
a million times in a week. And it had a quote unquote, a quote unquote, protest update slipped

43
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:48,640
in there, I guess you could say, one that sort of described itself as a message of peace.

44
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:53,780
But another that was supposedly hidden in there, watched for the user's IP. And when

45
00:03:53,780 --> 00:04:00,400
it detected a Russian IP, it triggered a script that wiped the user's drives, whatever they

46
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:07,920
had permission to, it would wipe. And soon after that update was published, a GitHub

47
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:14,240
post went viral claiming that the code had hit several NGOs that were documenting Russian

48
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:20,840
war crimes with photos and videos. And this update designed to protest the war ended up

49
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:28,840
wiping out the NGOs documents. They say that 30,000 messages and files detailing war crimes

50
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:35,200
committed by Russia and the Ukrainian army and government officials were wiped out. And

51
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:38,560
it's not even the first time that open source developers have sabotaged software in their

52
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:44,840
own projects as a bit of a protest. In January, the author of the Colors JS, remember that?

53
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:47,920
They added that infinite loop to their code that rendered any server that was running

54
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:54,520
it useless until it was fixed. These are all things that the MIT research paper cites.

55
00:04:54,520 --> 00:05:02,400
And my take on this is that they're not wrong. I don't think it's an issue at scale, but

56
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:08,520
it's enough of an issue that Pandora's box has now been opened. And there will be some

57
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:14,360
in business and in institutions that just don't trust open source the same way. And

58
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:19,600
while right now, today, it's being targeted against a group that we might disagree with,

59
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:26,480
open source, as you know, is a worldwide phenomenon. And so, by my math, it's just simply inevitable

60
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:30,840
that we'll find ourselves on the other side of some herd mentality one day. And these

61
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:35,960
kinds of things, if they become normalized, will likely strike us.

62
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:42,600
But some good news for at least you Risk 5 fans out there. Potentially great news, really.

63
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:47,720
Psy5, one of the most ambitious groups behind pushing for the Risk 5 platform, they just

64
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:54,940
begged another series of funding, $175 million in a series F round. That's a lot of rounds

65
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:59,960
of funding, but a couple of details came out in this process that overall kind of leave

66
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:08,640
me feeling pretty good. Psy5 was valued at $2.5 billion in this process. That's no joke.

67
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:13,280
We've seen companies like Linode recently sell for $900 million, right? So the fact

68
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:16,800
that Psy5 is valued at $2.5 billion shows you the industry thinks there's some real

69
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,600
potential here.

70
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:23,560
And overall, when you dig through it, at least the picture that Psy5 is painting, the funding

71
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:27,920
situation looks pretty good because between some recent money they've raised, some of

72
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:32,840
which hasn't even kicked in yet, and business revenue is actually doing pretty well too,

73
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:37,580
they seem to be in good shape. At least, again, according to Psy5.

74
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:45,360
My take is that it's about time. I mean, really, Psy5 has been around since 2015. They are

75
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:50,440
core to the RISC-V game, and they've built a growing business out of this thing just

76
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:55,280
day by day here. So it's really good to see them really getting some momentum now. They

77
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:59,440
say they need to hire to keep up with all of this, and this funding is going to let

78
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:06,320
them do this. Get this, though. Psy5 expects to double their 300-person staff in the next

79
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:10,880
12 to 18 months. That's how they're going to keep up with demand, and that's why they

80
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:15,960
need the funding. That's amazing. It's actually happening.

81
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:20,160
With Ubuntu 22.04 just around the corner, it is great to see one major change getting

82
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:28,880
finished up just before next month's Jellyfish release. So, Ubuntu 22.04 LTS will now default

83
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:34,640
to using GNOME on Wayland when running the NVIDIA proprietary driver. I can't believe

84
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:41,040
I just put all those words into a sentence. GNOME, Wayland, on NVIDIA, default. Now, this

85
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:46,920
is only going to work if you have a card that can take advantage of the NVIDIA 510 series

86
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:51,600
or newer driver. And if you're already on an AMD or Intel GPU, well, you're already

87
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:57,080
set. Ubuntu Linux has been defaulting to GNOME on Wayland since 2104 for those of you with

88
00:07:57,080 --> 00:08:03,440
AMD graphics. But this is huge for NVIDIA users that use the proprietary driver, and

89
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:08,440
it's the result of months of work by Red Hat, Canonical, and of course, NVIDIA. And I'm

90
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:15,680
talking Zoom meetings or BlueJeans meetings, really, in reality, that went on and on forever

91
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:19,200
that we'll never really know the full details of how hard people worked behind the scenes

92
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:24,000
to make this happen. But we do know on NVIDIA's side, they've been working to address bugs

93
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:29,040
for some time, and really what's helped make all of this possible is their implementation

94
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:34,960
inside their proprietary driver of the generic buffer manager. Adding that support really

95
00:08:34,960 --> 00:09:00,880
unlocked all this.

96
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:04,400
Linode is fast, reliable cloud hosting. You gotta try it. It's what we've been using

97
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:09,160
for the last two and a half years to build anything that's audience facing. It's fast

98
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:14,400
when I say it, I mean it. They've got 40 gigabit connections coming to the hypervisors, MVME

99
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:18,520
storage for the disk, and AMD EPYC processors when you want something fast. They've been

100
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:24,080
doing this for nearly 19 years, and it just keeps getting better and better. In particular,

101
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:28,120
I have to say their object storage has been a lifesaver. Their cloud firewalls make managing

102
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:32,720
traffic simple, and their interface makes it possible for anyone on our team to deploy

103
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:37,840
a server. So go try it out for yourself, see why we use Linode for everything. Go to linode.com

104
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:44,760
slash land, get $100 in 60 day credit, and of course, you support the show.

105
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:49,240
Linux.ting.com. If you're sick of overpaying for cell service, go support the show and

106
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:55,160
see how much you could save by going to linux.ting.com. Ting's an MVNO, that means you get access

107
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:59,200
to the same networks as the big carriers, but with way better customer support at a

108
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:03,160
lot lower of a cost. They have very simple plans. It's one of the reasons why I've been

109
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:08,280
a customer since 2013. And their support is the best. That's what they get to focus on.

110
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:14,280
In fact, Ting was named number one by Consumer Reports in 2021. I mean, there really is no

111
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:18,280
smarter way to do mobile. You save money, you get better, simpler plans, and access

112
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:22,600
to the best customer support with no contracts ever. And pretty much any phone is going to

113
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:26,840
work with Ting because they support multiple networks. And it's super simple to switch.

114
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:31,080
You can do it all on their website. Just get started at linux.ting.com. But check your

115
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:34,840
current phone, create an account and pick the plan that's right for you. Ting will

116
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:59,360
get you going in minutes. Get started, support the show and save 25 bucks at linux.ting.com.

117
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:04,880
While it's actually happened, the first alpha to get Linux on the M1 Macs has shipped. The

118
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:09,600
Asahi Linux team and Hector Martin announced this week that they are very excited for the

119
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:15,080
public alpha to ship. It supports the current range of M1 machines with a few limitations

120
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:20,420
in there. As we talked about before and prepared you for, there is no accelerated GPU support

121
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:26,240
at this stage. Things like DisplayPort, Bluetooth, et cetera, they're not working. Some things

122
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:30,360
like HDMI are hit and miss depending on the machine you're using. And at present, there

123
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:35,040
is no support for the recently announced Mac Studio. None of that's too surprising. It's

124
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:39,420
kind of what we expected all across the board. But now that it's actually gotten in the hands

125
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:46,280
of end users, we're seeing a ton of positive reports. And for a lot of people, it seems

126
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:51,040
that performance might even be better than expected. Michael Larble over at Ferronix

127
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:54,840
noted this in his tests, which we'll have linked in the show notes. And he did pages

128
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:59,600
of tests. But one of the things that stood out to me was this. He says, quote, even with

129
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:03,360
there being power and performance work still ahead for being able to make the most out

130
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:08,900
of the M1, these benchmarks with the Mac Mini did genuinely exceed my expectations for this

131
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:14,160
early alpha state. Running Linux on the M1 MacBooks may be a bit less ideal due to also

132
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:18,400
having to worry about the battery life and cooling concerns. But at least in the case

133
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:24,120
of the Mac Mini, this was a great little platform for evaluating the early state of Linux on

134
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:29,920
Apple Silicon. Now, here's my take, guys. I think what they've done in here is really

135
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:35,440
clever. Asahi Linux has made it very simple to handle the Mac OS install on the Mac. It

136
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:39,680
is designed to dual boot that, which I think is very smart in this phase, not only because

137
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:44,800
Asahi Linux is not fully functional, but even long term, you're going to want that Mac install

138
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:49,180
to do, I would imagine, firmware updates and things like that that Apple will only make

139
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:55,560
available through their OS, of course. Right. And I think also I love the choice of fully

140
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:59,400
embracing the dual boot mindset, because for some people, that's going to be the utility

141
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:03,920
of these machines. A lot of people got a utility and still do get utility out of dual booting

142
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:08,760
Linux and Windows. It's the same scenario here. But they've also accounted for those

143
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:12,760
of us that are just going to want to run Linux full time. There's essentially a minimum viable

144
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:19,160
Mac option in here where the Asahi Linux installer shrinks the Mac install down and then you

145
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:24,560
can use the remainder, the bulk of the free space for the Linux install. Right now, Asahi

146
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:30,160
Linux is really just a brilliant installer that sits on top of a slightly modified version

147
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:34,960
of Arch. I tell you that so you know what you're getting into, but I also think that's

148
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:40,580
really smart. Right now, this is for the domain of power users that are probably already comfortable

149
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:49,040
using Arch Linux. And Arch Linux also means faster software update. So as the team upstreams

150
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:53,760
driver improvements, you know, when they when they do get when Alyssa gets GPU acceleration

151
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:58,480
working, or they get Bluetooth working, right, that's going to land upstream first. And that

152
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:02,640
means it's going to come to Arch first, sort of the same mentality, I think that Valve

153
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:08,960
had when they released the new deck with Arch, get those upstream improvements onto the hardware

154
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:14,000
as fast as possible, because it makes the whole system more usable. But I have seen

155
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:18,800
people out there that are actually doing NixOS, all kinds of different distros, because really

156
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:24,240
it's it's it's using upstream bits that Asahi Linux is doing here. There's nothing proprietary

157
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:29,340
to their installer. There does seem to be users discovering that some of Apple's tools

158
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:35,040
are brittle in all of this. We actually had this bite that bite us on Linux unplugged.

159
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:41,040
The project is getting reports and we saw it ourselves that the APFS resizers part is

160
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:45,920
failing, probably due to some other type of file system corruption, either something that

161
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:50,560
existed ahead of time, or something that the tool is introducing. There is a couple of

162
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:55,000
options that we found. But if you don't, if you don't know to expect this, it's kind of

163
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:59,920
a bummer because it breaks the whole installation process. And it leaves you with what appears

164
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:05,600
to be a corrupted file system. However, in our case, disk first aid managed to just fix

165
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:09,680
it when we put it off the recovery partition. And other users have reported that they just

166
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:16,080
had to do a nuke and pave reinstall Mac OS. Not ideal, I grant you. And then they could

167
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:20,280
proceed. I don't know, but we seem to have our file system problem solved on the MacBook

168
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:24,280
that we are trying it on. We're going to put Linux on a MacBook Max. And we're going to

169
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:29,400
give it another go on this coming Sunday's Linux unplugged. So join us live Sunday at

170
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:34,640
noon Pacific 3pm Eastern at jblive.tv. If you want to see how our Asahi Linux attempt

171
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:39,560
goes this time, I think it's going to go better now that we fix that file system problem.

172
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:45,560
It is early days, right? No doubt about it. You got to acknowledge it. The value isn't

173
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:50,040
there. There's absolutely no reason at this point to go buy a Mac with the intention of

174
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:55,480
running Linux. That would be a silly thing to do. Don't do what Chris did and some of

175
00:15:55,480 --> 00:16:03,500
his friends. But I see a near future here where I'm going to have a headless, low power

176
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:09,440
home Linux box running on M1 hardware in my future. This could really bring my home hosting

177
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:15,040
game to a whole new level. I'm always going for the best performance per watt because

178
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:19,880
for large portions of the year, my home runs off of solar energy. I have no grid hookup

179
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:25,400
at all. And so it really makes a difference how much power something draws over the long

180
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:31,000
haul. And so the M1 hardware has just been extremely attractive to me from a home server,

181
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,880
low power, high performance standpoint. But there's just no way I was going to do with

182
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:39,680
Mac OS as a server. So to see a saw Linux working on this, I'm extremely excited. GPU

183
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:43,000
acceleration is still kind of far off in the distance, but that's clearly like the next

184
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:48,060
major milestone along with some of the other hardware enablement. But it feels like we're

185
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:51,200
on track here. And now that the public's getting their hands on it, it's going to accelerate

186
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:56,640
the involvement. It may even accelerate people joining the Patreon and supporting the project.

187
00:16:56,640 --> 00:17:00,080
We'll have to see. We'll keep an eye on this and everything else in the world of free software

188
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:04,920
and open source. So don't miss a single episode. Go to LinuxActionNews.com slash subscribe for

189
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:08,400
all the ways to get new episodes. And we'd love your feedback. You can either send us

190
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:14,040
a boost on a new podcast app that supports boosts or go to the contact page. Old school

191
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:18,720
LinuxActionNews.com slash contact. And let's hang out. I wanted to let you know we do have

192
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:25,240
a live stream coming up on March 31st at 4 p.m. in Seattle, 7 p.m. in New York, 11 p.m.

193
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:29,240
London time. Again, that's March 31st. It's an ask me anything. If you've been having

194
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:33,800
questions, you got thoughts, concerns, ideas, I don't know. Let me know. Come to the live

195
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:37,380
stream and let's chat. I also have the mobile room going and I'm going to help people get

196
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:41,600
Matrix set up because I know the onboarding can be a bit rough, but our Matrix community

197
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:46,120
is awesome. Decentralized chat is the future and I want to help people get on board. And

198
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:50,580
speaking of decentralized futures, I'm also giving away some Bitcoin to help you get started

199
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:55,760
with boosts and value for value. So go get a new podcast app, newpodcastapps.com. I like

200
00:17:55,760 --> 00:18:00,240
Fountain. You need something that has a lightning wallet and I'll be giving away some Bitcoin

201
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:04,800
to help you get started because I think it is the future of independent media and free

202
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:10,600
software. Again, that's live March 31st, 4 p.m. in Seattle, 7 p.m. in New York, 11 p.m.

203
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:15,080
London. I'd love to see you there. Of course, we'll be back next week with our take on the

204
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:19,320
latest Linux and open source news. Thanks so much for joining us. And that's all the

205
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:40,600
news for this week.
