00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,360
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, episode 141, recorded on January 19th, 2020.

2
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:10,360
I'm Chris.

3
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:11,360
And I'm Joe.

4
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:12,360
Hello, Joe.

5
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:16,520
Good to be connected with you, but unfortunately we start things out with some somber news.

6
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:21,880
Yeah, Mark Greaves, who was the Peppermint project lead, sadly is no longer with us.

7
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:26,160
It really sucks anytime we lose anyone in the community, but it really hurts when it's

8
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:31,400
someone who was pretty well known and was responsible for a project that people really

9
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:32,400
enjoy.

10
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:34,640
I hear really good things about Peppermint OS.

11
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:39,640
Mark went by PCNetSpec online, so you may have interacted with him as that.

12
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:43,160
And we pass our condolences on to his family as well.

13
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:45,440
Yeah, and indeed the whole community.

14
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:47,480
As you say, he was extremely well liked.

15
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:52,440
I never had the pleasure of meeting him, unfortunately, but from the tributes that I've seen, he was

16
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:53,440
a really good guy.

17
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:56,640
So this is just a terrible, terrible shame.

18
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:00,120
The hits keep rolling with some bad news from Mozilla this week.

19
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:03,840
It appears they've done a rather significant round of layoffs.

20
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:09,600
Yeah, it looks like they're going to lay off at least 70 people, potentially even as many

21
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:13,280
as 100, depending on how things go.

22
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:16,880
And a lot of those are engineers and QA people.

23
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:20,480
So this is really not good at all.

24
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:26,960
The silver lining to the story is on Twitter, I saw a lot of people responding to the announcements

25
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:30,280
from individuals who were laid off with job offers.

26
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:34,440
People that have worked at this organization for a while and gotten to a certain level

27
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:36,360
seem to be perhaps hot commodities.

28
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:40,440
So hopefully there's at least some that will land pretty quickly.

29
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:46,720
It appears that this all really comes down to a slower than expected move to new revenue

30
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:47,720
sources.

31
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:52,600
The current chairwoman and interim CEO, Mitchell Baker, specifically mentions the slow rollout

32
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:57,520
of the organization's new revenue generating products such as subscription services.

33
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:02,400
Quote, you may recall that we expected to be earning revenue in 2019 and 2020 from new

34
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:08,080
subscription products, as well as higher revenue from sources outside of search.

35
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,320
This did not happen.

36
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:11,400
Well, who could have seen that coming, eh?

37
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,240
Yeah, that Google money was pretty nice.

38
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:18,320
Of course, Mozilla was under a lot of pressure to get off of that revenue source.

39
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:24,120
She goes on to say our 2019 plan underestimated how long it would take to build and ship new

40
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:26,120
revenue generating products.

41
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:31,800
Given that, and all we learned in 2019 about the pace of innovation, we decided to take

42
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:35,780
a more conservative approach to our project and revenue for 2020.

43
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:40,840
We also agreed to the principle of living within our means of not spending more than

44
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:47,880
we can earn for the foreseeable future, i.e. that's boss speak for reductions.

45
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:54,440
Now, I guess these reductions come with generous exit packages and, as they always say, support

46
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:55,440
in outplacement.

47
00:02:55,440 --> 00:03:00,320
Yeah, and for the staff that are in the UK and France, both those countries have pretty

48
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:05,000
strict labor laws, which mean you can't just fire someone immediately.

49
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,740
So that's where the uncertainty about the numbers comes from.

50
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:13,060
And they will probably get pretty good packages kind of by law.

51
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:18,160
So it's not a complete disaster, but it's still not very nice for the people involved.

52
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:22,360
I hope and I assume they must be doing an internal analysis about why things didn't

53
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:26,180
meet their expectations and launch at the pace they expected.

54
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:28,740
I'd like to hear that they're getting their hands around that.

55
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:31,340
That I think would be the ultimate resolution.

56
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:35,940
But I just have a random question because they're looking at VPN solutions.

57
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:39,480
They're looking at all these different ways to generate subscription service and they're

58
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:44,600
trying to change the Firefox brand to be more about privacy and protection.

59
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:51,840
Would you be willing as just a straight up subscription to subscribe to support Firefox

60
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:52,840
development?

61
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:53,840
It's not a VPN service.

62
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:56,600
It doesn't get you cloud storage.

63
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:59,480
It just pays for the development of Firefox.

64
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:03,380
Maybe it gives you access to something else extra.

65
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:04,380
I don't know.

66
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:08,460
But it is fundamentally just a way to pay for Firefox.

67
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:10,880
Would you, Joe Resington, personally do that?

68
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:15,080
I'd like to say that I would, but I don't know if that's really honest.

69
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:16,080
I don't know.

70
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:21,580
I'd have to see that proposition in front of me and see how much it was, but I could

71
00:04:21,580 --> 00:04:22,580
do that right now.

72
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:25,580
I could donate regularly to them, but I don't.

73
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:27,780
So probably not.

74
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:28,780
True.

75
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:29,780
True.

76
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:33,400
I wonder if it was as easy as it is to sign up for a VPN service if people might not just

77
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:38,380
add it on or support Firefox development add on to some of these other existing subscriptions,

78
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:41,880
sort of bundle it in there for a small price.

79
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:47,180
Because fundamentally, I just want a good secure browser that I can trust and that is

80
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:48,680
putting the user's needs first.

81
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:53,080
We need that as a balance in the marketplace more so than ever.

82
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:55,920
So fundamentally, I really hope they get this sorted out.

83
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:59,980
We used to joke about how much money Mozilla had back in the old days, but things are not

84
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:00,980
looking so great.

85
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:05,300
They've even considered shutting down their innovation fund, but decided that it needed

86
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:11,860
to stick around in order to keep actually discovering new products that they could monetize.

87
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:16,380
But you are not alone in wanting them to double down on the browser.

88
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:20,760
Because that seems to be the consensus in the community from what I've seen.

89
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:25,020
They just wish they'd stop messing around with all these side projects and just concentrate

90
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:30,740
on the browser, the core product, which to some extent they have and they've made it

91
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:35,180
better and more competitive with Chrome, but it's just not working, is it?

92
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:40,820
So maybe if they did only do the browser, then they'd just dwindle away to virtually

93
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:45,380
no market share, just a few people who really care about freedom.

94
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:50,940
To channel my former inner small business CEO, I think I would have to ask you the question

95
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:56,660
of isn't this the exact human cost we pay for Google dumping on the market?

96
00:05:56,660 --> 00:06:00,960
Not to be anti-Google about this because fair enough to them, they were in a position to

97
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:05,680
leverage their success to guarantee some security in the market.

98
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,540
They had every right to do that.

99
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:12,440
But by taking something like Chrome and making it really freaking great and investing who

100
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:20,020
knows how many millions, potentially billions into staff, R&D, testing, commercialization,

101
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:27,020
advertising, branding, they have essentially an endless supply of money they can dump into

102
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:30,220
this thing to make it a market dominator.

103
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:35,220
Plus they were able to come in when technology progressed in a significant way from when

104
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:37,380
Firefox was originally conceived.

105
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:41,300
So they started very competitive and they had the resources and means to do it and then

106
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:44,900
they made it free and they made the backend open source.

107
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:48,980
So it fundamentally dumps all of the value out of the market.

108
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:52,220
Firefox can't charge $15 per download.

109
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:53,460
That'd be ridiculous.

110
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:58,000
In a marketplace where you've got so many browsers that are now based off of essentially

111
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:03,700
WebKit and Blink, they can't be the one off with their weird gecko engine that charges

112
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:06,420
$15 for a download in 2020.

113
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:13,060
It's just not even possible because they're up against something like Chrome or now something

114
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:19,940
like Edge, which this week, the old version of Edge faded away and it's now a Blink based

115
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:21,180
Edge world.

116
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:23,420
And it's all WebKit and Blink essentially.

117
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:28,340
Yeah, which is why it's so fundamentally important that we have a competitor to it.

118
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:30,780
But yet they can't charge for the product.

119
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:35,760
And if they fail, we essentially have lost the people's advocate in web browsers.

120
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:39,380
You're making me want to reconsider my decision not to donate to them now.

121
00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:41,900
I think you're doing a pretty good sales job here.

122
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:44,460
I got to say, they sell some nice swag too.

123
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:45,460
So it's something to consider.

124
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:46,460
All right.

125
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:51,100
Well, let's cheer things up a little bit with Nextcloud's huge announcement of Nextcloud

126
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:52,660
Hub this week.

127
00:07:52,660 --> 00:07:53,660
Nextcloud Hub.

128
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:54,660
Hub.

129
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:55,660
Hub.

130
00:07:55,660 --> 00:07:56,660
Yeah.

131
00:07:56,660 --> 00:08:01,260
Well, it's Nextcloud 18 really, but they've gone through a bit of a rebranding to signify

132
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:06,580
the significance of not just the improvements, but also the new integration of out of the

133
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:07,580
box apps.

134
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:09,900
Well, actually not quite out of the box.

135
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:10,900
Shortly after the box apps.

136
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:15,500
Yeah, it's a curious approach where apps get installed straight after you install the main

137
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:16,500
software.

138
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:18,860
I don't know why they don't just bundle them.

139
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:23,860
I suppose a couple advantages would be you get the latest version and then that app developer

140
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:27,860
gets some stats, gets a sense of how many people actually have it deployed.

141
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:28,860
Yeah.

142
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:30,940
And I suppose if you had an older version, it'd have to be updated anyway.

143
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:36,540
So you may as well just not bother make the initial download smaller or whatever.

144
00:08:36,540 --> 00:08:41,780
But this is kind of coming together of a lot of what they had been doing previously with

145
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:45,700
a little bit added on and a rebrand.

146
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:49,100
It's a fairly clever strategy because it got a lot of attention.

147
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:53,300
Names matter and the way people think about things matter and this changes the way people

148
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:54,300
think about it.

149
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:59,140
And the thing that I've definitely noticed in the conversations around this news story

150
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:04,500
is it's clearly positioned as an Office 365 slash Google Apps competitor now.

151
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:11,260
People are clicking, oh, I could replace a bunch of these commercial cloud platform services

152
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:12,740
with Nextcloud.

153
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:16,300
When it lacked a couple of things, I think it just didn't click.

154
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:20,580
When you position it to Nextcloud Hub and they change how they talk about it a little

155
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:26,020
bit, it better represents the full scope of the project now and its full capabilities

156
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:28,500
of what it can replace from commercial providers.

157
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:29,500
I think it's working.

158
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:30,880
People get it more.

159
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:35,860
The biggest new feature is the integration of OnlyOffice because they had Collabora as

160
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:40,860
an option before, but now they're putting OnlyOffice front and center and so you can

161
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:46,740
have a Google Docs style experience and also have really good compatibility with Microsoft's

162
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:48,780
Office 365.

163
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:53,220
So I can see how that's attractive to people, especially as you can run this on premises

164
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:55,140
and be in complete control of it.

165
00:09:55,140 --> 00:10:01,060
I'm not a user of OnlyOffice, but my understanding is they market it as 100% compatible with

166
00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:08,820
Microsoft Office formats, and I think its native file format is XLSX and Xdoc or whatever

167
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:09,820
it is.

168
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:12,980
It doesn't use the open document format.

169
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:18,380
Now, like Joe said, the key thing is you can throw this on a Nextcloud box on your LAN

170
00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:23,340
and have something that, in my opinion, has a better UI than Google Docs.

171
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:29,420
I don't think the overall product features are as competitive, but if your needs are

172
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:37,940
centralized, easy go-to collaboration in something that has a UI that's, I think, kind of nicer

173
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:40,100
than Google Docs, it'll do that.

174
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:45,960
I think it lacks some features that heavy Google Docs or Office 365 users would want,

175
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:50,460
but this sort of walks that line of probably solving it for 80% of people out there.

176
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:55,220
Well, as long as you don't have a high-resolution monitor and want to zoom in, that is.

177
00:10:55,220 --> 00:11:00,980
Because I do that in Google Docs, and it all resizes perfectly, whereas in the OnlyOffice

178
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:04,980
demo that I tried, it didn't resize properly at all.

179
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:11,180
It just made it all blurry and weird, so I wasn't very impressed there, I must say.

180
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:12,180
Yeah.

181
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:13,540
I mean, it's a different market.

182
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:15,300
There's a lot of Office competitors.

183
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:19,860
We talked about FreeOffice not too long ago in the context of Manjaro.

184
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:25,180
This is a market, and people want to solve this in a way that works for a large portion

185
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:26,180
of users.

186
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:30,580
If you can deploy something like this on a server, even if it's not perfect, if it solves

187
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:34,300
it for a lot of the people or the majority of the people and you're not necessarily having

188
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:36,580
to pay Office licenses, it's great.

189
00:11:36,580 --> 00:11:42,260
I will point out that I believe the absolutely free version of OnlyOffice may have some limitations.

190
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:45,820
They have a pay version that you can license.

191
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:49,500
I couldn't tell you more than that, so you might just want to do some research.

192
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:52,860
The limitations may be completely acceptable or may not exist, but it is worth looking

193
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:53,860
into.

194
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:58,140
When I did some research, it appears, at least from the documentation, I could find that

195
00:11:58,140 --> 00:12:02,540
there's somewhere around a 20, 25 concurrent user limit on the free version.

196
00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:04,340
That's pretty nice.

197
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:10,180
And really, if you've got more than 20 users, it's probably time to pay for the thing anyways.

198
00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:11,380
There are some other new features, of course.

199
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:15,180
They've got a nice-looking Photos application, which is new.

200
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:22,260
And also, they've rewritten the user interface for Torque, and that's all integrated in nicely.

201
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:23,940
So it is looking pretty good.

202
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:25,180
I am keen to try it.

203
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:30,500
We're going to have to upgrade our current 17 version and maybe try some of these features.

204
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:35,380
Well, Huawei has some new features that they desperately want developers to try.

205
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:39,500
Yeah, this week at an event in London, they revealed more details about their Huawei Mobile

206
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:47,420
Services System, or HMS, which is a direct replacement for GMS, Google Mobile Services.

207
00:12:47,420 --> 00:12:52,420
This is all wrapped up in the political wrangling and the trade war that means that they can't

208
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:56,460
really bundle Google services, so they need a replacement.

209
00:12:56,460 --> 00:12:58,940
And it looks like they're pretty much on track to do that.

210
00:12:58,940 --> 00:13:02,940
Can we just appreciate the scope of what they're trying to pull off here?

211
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:06,720
They're trying to convince developers that they can ship a compelling Android system,

212
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:12,940
not just developers, consumers, obviously carriers, but they're trying to convince a

213
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:18,820
public that they can make a competitive system running on Android without Google services.

214
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:23,660
It's the very situation that Samsung ended up making a massive deal with Google, if you'll

215
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:27,140
recall years ago, to avoid.

216
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:30,400
Even though they've kept their own independent apps, they've never been able to pull that

217
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:33,380
trigger because they're afraid of how the market would react.

218
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:34,380
That's my assumption.

219
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:41,340
Well, Huawei claims that they've already signed up 55,000 apps using the HMS core, which is

220
00:13:41,340 --> 00:13:44,620
free to register for, and there's different developer kits they'll issue you depending

221
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:47,100
on what you're doing for free as well.

222
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:53,180
And they say their app gallery currently is attracting 400 million active users.

223
00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:56,560
So that's pretty significant, but when you consider the scope of what they're trying

224
00:13:56,560 --> 00:14:02,780
to pull off and the fact that those numbers are not validatable, Huawei is the sole provider

225
00:14:02,780 --> 00:14:07,540
of that data source, and we don't know exactly what qualifies as an active user or how many

226
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:11,780
developers are actually creating applications, so they're just touting the best case scenario.

227
00:14:11,780 --> 00:14:16,140
But even given that, they seem to have gotten more traction than I even thought they would

228
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:21,140
get to, and there appears to be some momentum based on the results of that event they were

229
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:22,140
at.

230
00:14:22,140 --> 00:14:26,620
The thing is, though, do they really care about the Western market, ultimately?

231
00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:31,740
That's kind of what I kept thinking about while I was reading about this, that the Western

232
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:35,500
market is pretty much saturated at this point.

233
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:41,260
And okay, yes, it does have a lot of value to them, but would they really miss it?

234
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:46,580
Because the real growth markets are in China and India and countries like that.

235
00:14:46,580 --> 00:14:51,020
I think it matters, even if it doesn't directly matter to them.

236
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:58,420
Because for this to be successful, they need other OEMs to support their app kit APIs,

237
00:14:58,420 --> 00:15:04,700
their development kits, the whole Huawei app system, because you need these to be cross-device

238
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:05,700
applications.

239
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:12,100
For an example, Huawei is working on a replacement for Android's Quick App feature where it'll

240
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:13,660
download the parts of the app you need.

241
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:18,380
I mean, they're really looking at rewriting large portions of what Google provided, so

242
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:21,540
they've created something called Huawei Quick App.

243
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:26,540
And they acknowledge that they want this to be a new set of standards, and right now they've

244
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:30,380
already got 12 major Chinese handset manufacturers to support it.

245
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:35,780
Now the reason why that matters is that group of Chinese handset manufacturers represent

246
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:41,600
more than 35% of the global market, so outside of China as well.

247
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:49,020
That's a way they can get broader adoption without just being limited to Huawei devices.

248
00:15:49,020 --> 00:15:52,260
I think it's a necessary part of their strategy to attract developers.

249
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:56,540
Well, you could have a point there, because Huawei is investing 20 million pounds into

250
00:15:56,540 --> 00:16:03,220
the UK and Ireland, with some developers able to claim up to 20,000 pounds for apps uploaded

251
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:06,180
to the Huawei gallery by the end of the month.

252
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:07,420
Yeah, that's interesting.

253
00:16:07,420 --> 00:16:09,820
They're really trying to attract developers in that market.

254
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:15,180
And Huawei's approach to the press was, yeah, we're in this position now, but strategically

255
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:19,380
we needed to solve this anyways, it's just been accelerated, this is something we need

256
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:20,380
to get done.

257
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:24,460
Well, another company that's been very strategic when it comes to the platforms they support

258
00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:29,620
is Valve, and it looks like Steam may well be coming to Chrome OS at some point soon.

259
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:33,780
Yeah, last week David Ruddick, writing over to Android Police, spoke to the director of

260
00:16:33,780 --> 00:16:35,980
product management for Google's Chrome OS.

261
00:16:35,980 --> 00:16:40,620
So this is an exclusive, and it's coming from the product manager.

262
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:47,220
They say the Chrome team is working, possibly in cooperation with Valve, it wasn't said

263
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:54,380
indirectly, but it was implied, to bring Steam over to Chromebooks via the Linux compatibility

264
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:56,740
that already exists.

265
00:16:56,740 --> 00:17:01,860
But it's not clear on exactly what that would mean, if that would also mean perhaps improving

266
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:05,340
some of the performance, because right now you could install Steam already.

267
00:17:05,340 --> 00:17:09,620
It just runs horrible, even if you were to play on a Chromebook and you just replaced

268
00:17:09,620 --> 00:17:12,580
Chrome OS with Linux, it runs much better under Linux.

269
00:17:12,580 --> 00:17:18,820
There's some limitations in the 3D acceleration performance in that Linux compatibility layer.

270
00:17:18,820 --> 00:17:22,020
And it was implied, although we don't have a direct quote, that that would change, that

271
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:26,980
we would see Chromebooks, especially Chromebooks, with AMD processors coming.

272
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:31,940
My first thought on this was the current, affordable Chromebooks at least, do not have

273
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:33,700
the power for this.

274
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:38,000
But then you start to think about the kind of remote play stuff, and it suddenly makes

275
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
a lot more sense.

276
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:43,900
Well, honestly, that's why I was surprised to see this, because Chromebooks seem like

277
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:46,140
the perfect candidate for Stadia.

278
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:51,260
They don't have dedicated graphics, they're mostly a cloud-based device, they're pretty

279
00:17:51,260 --> 00:17:55,580
solid for that kind of thing, and it really kind of is the perfect target market.

280
00:17:55,580 --> 00:17:58,740
You can't even play games, you don't have a graphics card.

281
00:17:58,740 --> 00:18:01,160
Let's introduce you to this subscription called Stadia.

282
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:05,500
And I thought, look at that beautiful captive market they have, and then Google goes along

283
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:11,340
and says, all right, yeah, we'll work with Valve to bring a gaming competitor to our

284
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:12,340
platform.

285
00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:14,900
I mean, I'm very happy to see it, but I am surprised.

286
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:20,460
And I guess you could just use it for game streaming, but you put a Chromebook with a

287
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:25,580
little bit of gaming performance in there, I think it would work.

288
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:27,980
Students like to game, and parents will spend the money.

289
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:31,940
For Christmas, I got my son a used ThinkPad.

290
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:38,140
It was, you know, not super expensive, but one of the requirements was that it needed

291
00:18:38,140 --> 00:18:42,100
a dedicated GPU, because he wants to play the video games.

292
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:46,900
And so if we see some Chromebooks coming with dedicated AMD graphics or whatever, then this

293
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:48,860
might suddenly make a lot more sense.

294
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:52,220
I would have had to ask myself, what do I get him?

295
00:18:52,220 --> 00:18:54,660
Because he uses a Chromebook every day at school.

296
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:58,820
They just, here you go, kid, get a Google account and use a Chromebook.

297
00:18:58,820 --> 00:19:00,380
You don't need that pen and paper.

298
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:05,620
And it's been like that since he was like in very early days of school, very, very like

299
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:07,120
very early days.

300
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:09,780
And so he really knows how to navigate that platform.

301
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:12,980
He's, you know, he's like the go to support kid in class.

302
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:16,860
And so there would be a lot of advantages to giving him that same environment at home.

303
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:18,380
I don't know if I'd do it.

304
00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:22,140
I prefer a ThinkPad with elementary OS, it just works super good for him.

305
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:23,140
And guess what?

306
00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:24,320
We installed Steam.

307
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:28,540
First thing we did, I loaded him up with a bunch of Steam games.

308
00:19:28,540 --> 00:19:31,300
I think I still would have made that choice.

309
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:34,660
But I could see a lot of parents going the Chromebook route.

310
00:19:34,660 --> 00:19:39,560
And definitely as if their other alternative was going to be a Windows 10 laptop or a thousand

311
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:41,480
dollar plus MacBook.

312
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:46,760
Even a $700 Chromebook is a good deal in that kind of market.

313
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:49,860
And the other thing too, Joe, is as Dylan gets older, let's say he keeps using these

314
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:53,040
Chromebooks for all the way through high school.

315
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:57,260
When he graduates, if they have continued to evolve the platform and its capabilities

316
00:19:57,260 --> 00:20:02,100
and hardware feature set, maybe it would make sense as an adult when you buy your first

317
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:04,340
computer to just buy a beefy Chromebook.

318
00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:06,540
It's kind of the Apple strategy, isn't it?

319
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:09,260
Well, I can see that feature panning out definitely.

320
00:20:09,260 --> 00:20:11,260
But in the short term, this has got to be good news for Linux.

321
00:20:11,260 --> 00:20:13,900
It's going to attract more people over to the platform.

322
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:17,060
It's using the Linux technologies within Chrome OS.

323
00:20:17,060 --> 00:20:18,540
It's using Vulkan.

324
00:20:18,540 --> 00:20:22,580
So that has to be good for the wider platform beyond Chrome OS.

325
00:20:22,580 --> 00:20:23,580
Yeah.

326
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:26,100
In the meantime, we're doing pretty good on the desktop Linux side.

327
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:31,380
Over the holidays, I was able to just sit down for a bit and really appreciate the range

328
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:33,140
of games.

329
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:37,820
And with the real kind of confidence that just about any game I feel like playing, I

330
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:39,300
can play on desktop Linux right now.

331
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:40,300
It's pretty great.

332
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:43,720
But whatever happens with that story and all the stories in Linux and open source, we'll

333
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:44,820
let you know.

334
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:45,900

341
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:08,580
I think you'll be really impressed.

342
00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:09,580

343
00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:13,260
We'll be back next Monday with our weekly take on the latest Linux and open source news.

344
00:21:13,260 --> 00:21:14,980
I'm at Chris LAS.

345
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:16,580
I'm at Joel Rosenton.

346
00:21:16,580 --> 00:21:17,580
Thanks for joining us.

347
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:18,580
And we will see you next week.

348
