00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,420
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News. Episode 256, recorded on August 31st, 2022. I'm Chris.

2
00:00:11,420 --> 00:00:12,420
And I'm Wes.

3
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:15,620
Hello, Wes. Let's do the news.

4
00:00:15,620 --> 00:00:21,460
And we start with a project that is as universally loved in the Linux community as just about

5
00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:25,380
any project can be. FWPD.

6
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:29,980
This week, Richard Hughes, the lead developer of FWPD, as well as its backend infrastructure,

7
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:37,160
the Linux Vendor Firmware Service, announced the release of FWPD 1.8.4.

8
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:42,720
A significant update, FWPD 1.8.4 not only includes bug fixes and support for some new

9
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:49,560
hardware, but it notably also lays the groundwork for the ability to make changes to the system's

10
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:53,160
BIOS from within Linux.

11
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:59,920
Yeah, let that sink in for a minute. FWPD can now read your system BIOS settings and

12
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:06,040
has the ability to actually change them if the user desires, and has the authorization

13
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:08,080
to do so, I should say.

14
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:12,700
And this ability is not only useful for some obvious reasons out there, but should also

15
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:17,560
go towards this new Device Security Control Center page in future versions of GNOME, which

16
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:23,480
is planned to expose important hardware information, like a security issue, should they exist.

17
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:28,000
And according to Hughes, support is going to be limited, at least for now, to certain

18
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,840
hardware, writing, quote, we currently support this on modern Lenovo and Dell platforms via

19
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:37,400
the Firmware Attributes kernel interface. Other vendors just have to add that kernel

20
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:41,360
WMI bridge, and it should mostly start magically working.

21
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:45,320
You ThinkPad users out there will especially want to keep your eyes out for this update,

22
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:49,480
since it includes support for the ThinkPad Thunderbolt 4 dock, as well as the ThinkPad

23
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:55,800
Universal Smart Dock. Additional details on FWPD 1.8.4 can also be found via the link

24
00:01:55,800 --> 00:02:01,680
in our notes to Richard Hughes' blog.

25
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:05,680
Well an update on Canonical's effort to make Ubuntu more appealing to gamers. They

26
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:10,000
are continuing to make improvements to their Steam Snap, like resolving some graphics drivers

27
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,000
issues, and now seem to be expanding out to other components for gaming.

28
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,880
Now you might guess that Canonical had snapped up another game library, or maybe created

29
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:27,200
a free interface to GOG. But you'd be wrong. The latest Linux gaming component to receive

30
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:31,680
Snap treatment is now Feral Interactive's Game Mode.

31
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:35,720
Yeah, you might remember Game Mode. That's their demon for automatically setting the

32
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:40,360
CPU governor to performance mode, and then dynamically adjusting other system settings

33
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:44,840
when a game is launched. And then it restores those settings back when you exit the game.

34
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:51,840
And it looks like Canonical here just wants to snap up more of the gaming ecosystem.

35
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:57,840
Reception in the Linux community seems to be a bit confused and hesitant. For their

36
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:02,360
part though, Canonical has been making it pretty clear they want to invest in gaming

37
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:08,800
on Ubuntu. They held a talk at the Libre Application Summit earlier this year, and opened two positions

38
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:12,080
within the company focused on gaming.

39
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:16,720
But I think it's safe to say that many of us sort of expected those efforts would be

40
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:22,480
going into system optimizations, enabling newer drivers on Ubuntu, or maybe reaching

41
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:24,720
out to developers and other partners.

42
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:29,360
Yeah, I suppose we can hope that's kind of part of the plan. Maybe what we're seeing

43
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:35,240
right now is a bit of a phase one, some basic groundwork that the team can then build on

44
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:42,960
later. I guess we'll have to see, time will tell.

45
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:50,200
Just a few days ago, Pine64 announced the Star64 single board computer prototype. And

46
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:58,680
yeah, it's powered by a RISC-V based Star5 JH7110 64-bit processor.

47
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:04,160
Alright, bring it on I say. Let's get more of these on the market. The Star64 will be

48
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:10,560
available with four gigabytes and eight gigabytes of LPDDR4 RAM. And the Star64 will also feature

49
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:16,560
an eMMC slot, a PCIe slot, and a microSD slot.

50
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:24,880
The Star64 also features dual gigabit ports, Wi-Fi 6, an HDMI and MIPI display interface.

51
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:34,640
And of course, the board also includes a 40-pin GPIO header, three USB 2.0 ports, one USB 3.0

52
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:40,760
port, a 3.5 millimeter audio jack, and a power button.

53
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:44,740
Well how about that, a power button. These small board computers are getting fancy indeed.

54
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:51,000
Now we're still missing some, I would say, essential launch details. So in my opinion,

55
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:56,080
it's a bit of a mini red flag. I have no doubt that ultimately Pine will ship this.

56
00:04:56,080 --> 00:05:01,040
My main question is how finished will it ever get? But that we'll have to wait and see.

57
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:06,080
It does sound like interested developers might be able to receive their boards as early as

58
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:13,760
in a few weeks. So we'll keep you posted.

59
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:20,180
And a quick update on one of those apps that's always working for you in the background.

60
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:28,240
Network Manager 1.40 has been released with Multi-Path TCP support. Multi-Path TCP has

61
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:33,380
really come together in the kernel over the past two years, and it allows TCP connections

62
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:39,600
to use multiple paths for greater performance, efficiency, and added redundancy.

63
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:44,920
With recent kernels, the Multi-Path TCP functionality is in great shape, so it's really nice to

64
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:49,740
see the Network Manager configuration side finally adding support.

65
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:53,240
In addition to that, though, there's also been some generous cleanup around the Network

66
00:05:53,240 --> 00:06:01,040
Manager DHCP client code, support for configuring the IPv6 MTU, and improved carrier detection

67
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:06,520
for you mobile users out there.

68
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:11,760
Linode.com slash LAN. Go there to get $100 in 60-day credit on a new account, and it's

69
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:14,040
a great way to support the show.

70
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:18,720
Big thank you to Linode for their continued support of Linux Action News. Keeping us going,

71
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:23,240
keeping us on the air, Linode is fast, reliable cloud hosting. I think it's the best in the

72
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:26,880
business, and they have the best support in the business, and the best performance in

73
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:27,880
the business.

74
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:32,760
I know, big talk, but independent study after independent study has shown it over the years,

75
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:37,200
and I've seen it with my own eyes, too. We just launched the new website, brand new website.

76
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:41,960
It's up. If you haven't been to jupyterbroadcasting.com in a little while, go check it out.

77
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:46,000
And yeah, it's running on Linode. We build it on Linode. We deploy it on Linode. All

78
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,920
the infrastructure on Linode is part of our toolbag. It's how we get jobs done, and Linode's

79
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:55,580
been around for nearly 19 years, building the absolute best way for you to run applications

80
00:06:55,580 --> 00:07:02,560
on Linux in the cloud, and they're 30 to 50% cheaper than those hyperscalers that just

81
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:06,840
want to lock you into their cray-cray platform, and they're always trying to upsell you. They're

82
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:12,280
always coming up with some new rebranded open source project and selling it to you for a

83
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:16,440
few bucks, you know? It's always their game. That's not the game Linode plays, and they've

84
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:21,240
structured themselves in a way where they are their own ISP. They can have a dedicated

85
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:26,880
365 support staff. They got 11 data centers around the world, and then they have great

86
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:33,440
complimentary features, stuff that makes sense, like S3 compatible object storage, cloud firewalls,

87
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:38,480
bare metal boxes if you need them, and Kubernetes, Ansible, and Terraform support, so that way

88
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:42,500
you can just snap this right into your existing infrastructure and potentially make it part

89
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:47,240
of your multi-cloud strategy. So go try it out. Go build something. Go learn something.

90
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:53,560
Go kick the tires. Go put that $100 to work and support the show. Linode.com slash LAN.

91
00:07:53,560 --> 00:08:02,760
One more time, for good luck, go there and keep us going. Linode.com slash LAN.

92
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:08,440
And a big thank you to Kalyde. Kalyde.com slash LAN. Kalyde is an endpoint security

93
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:14,800
solution that uses the most powerful untapped resource in IT. Your end users. When you're

94
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:17,840
trying to achieve security goals, whether it's for a third party audit or your own

95
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:22,160
compliance standards, I think the conventional wisdom is to treat every device like it's

96
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:26,400
Fort Knox or something. You know, with old school device management tools like MDMs that

97
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:32,080
just force disruptive agents onto employees' devices, slow them down, treat privacy as

98
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:36,840
an afterthought, and often have their own set of security drawbacks. You know what I'm

99
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:41,560
talking about. It also has a way of turning end users against the IT admins and kind of

100
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:47,480
creates this baseline hostility between the two groups. Kalyde does things differently.

101
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:53,240
Instead of forcing changes on users, Kalyde sends them security recommendations via Slack.

102
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:57,560
Kalyde will automatically notify your team when their devices are insecure and give them

103
00:08:57,560 --> 00:09:02,140
step-by-step instructions on how to solve the problem. By reaching out to employees

104
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:07,200
via a friendly Slack DM and educating them about company policies, Kalyde can help you

105
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:12,000
build a culture in which everyone contributes to security, because everyone understands

106
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:17,760
how and why to do it. And for IT admins, Kalyde provides a single dashboard that lets you

107
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:22,320
monitor the security of your entire fleet. Maybe they're on a Mac, Windows, or Linux,

108
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:27,340
you got it. You can see at a glance which employees have their disencrypted or OS up

109
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:31,840
to date and a password manager installed, making it easy to prove compliance to your

110
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:38,720
auditors, your customers, or even leadership or yourself. So that, that's Kalyde. User-centered,

111
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:45,120
cross-platform, endpoint security for teams that Slack. You can meet your compliance goals

112
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:50,400
by putting users first. Visit Kalyde.com slash LAN to find out how. Now when you go there,

113
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:55,240
they're going to also hook you up with a goodie bag, including a free t-shirt, just for activating

114
00:09:55,240 --> 00:10:02,260
a free trial. You got to love that free swag. So it's K-O-L-I-D-E dot com slash L-A-N, Kalyde

115
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:07,880
dot com slash LAN.

116
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:14,600
And we end this week with Debian's problem with non-free firmware. The basic issue is

117
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:19,960
that the use of downloadable firmware and computer hardware is on the rise, and most

118
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:26,680
of that firmware is just not free software. The official Debian installer, however, only

119
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:32,600
incorporates free software and thus free firmware, which leads to serious problems for many users

120
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:35,800
attempting to get Debian up and running on a modern system.

121
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:41,600
Right. You got a new piece of hardware. It's got some fancy stuff in there that, well,

122
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:45,920
only has binary blobs. This has always been a gray area for Debian, and a lot of us who've

123
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:49,480
used it for a long time know that installer image only has packages from the official

124
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:54,320
main repository, which is software that's only conforming to the Debian free software

125
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:59,360
guidelines. So it's going to be a more limited set. It's generally a pretty healthy set of

126
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:04,200
software, but this is an area, hardware blobs, where it's just traditionally been a little

127
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:08,200
weak. And the same team that's responsible for creating the official installer images

128
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:14,920
that don't have that firmware, but they also create the unofficial images, which do have

129
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:20,480
the firmware in there. And honestly, most of us are going to end up just going and getting

130
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:25,240
those images to get Debian up and running on modern hardware.

131
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:32,120
But as you might imagine, the status of unofficial adds a little confusion to things. So an internal

132
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:38,200
discussion on how Debian should be handling this started earlier this year. Now that discussion

133
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:42,840
is moving forward into the Debian general resolution process.

134
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:49,640
Yeah, indeed, something can only be unofficially unofficial for so long. So discussions on

135
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:54,760
how Debian should be handling this have been going on for a really long time. This is really

136
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:59,880
being driven by a longtime contributor, Steve McIntyre, and recently he proposed a general

137
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:05,080
resolution on how Debian is going to just handle this non-free firmware situation. Now

138
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:08,680
there's a discussion period that's kicked off that'll last until September 3rd. And

139
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:13,120
this resolution that he's proposed has three main options.

140
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:19,320
First there's option A. Include non-free firmware packages on the official installation

141
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:26,000
media. In this version of the proposal, firmware binaries would be normally enabled by default

142
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:31,000
where needed for hardware support. But it would also suggest that Debian explore ways

143
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:37,240
to let users disable that support at boot time if desired. Under option A, the Debian

144
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:42,200
installer or live system would also have a means of informing the user about what firmware

145
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:49,920
is loaded, whether that firmware be free or non-free. Finally, option A specifies that

146
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:55,320
these new versions of the media would replace Debian's current official installation media,

147
00:12:55,320 --> 00:13:00,760
which as we noted, does not include non-free firmware packages as it stands right now.

148
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:06,560
Then there's option B. Include non-free firmware onto the official installation media along

149
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:12,600
similar lines to option A. The main difference with option B is that these new images would

150
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:18,320
not replace the current Debian official installation media. Instead, these new images would be

151
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:22,240
separate and complimentary non-free firmware images.

152
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:28,100
Finally, there's proposal C, which is really just a simplified statement that supports

153
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:33,280
the inclusion of non-free firmware for the installer, but leaves out all the fine details

154
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:36,640
present in options A and B.

155
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:41,280
In my opinion, anything other than option A seems like bending over backwards to suit

156
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:47,800
the idealists, but that's not to be dismissive about the difficulty of that choice because

157
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:54,040
Debian is a very principled distribution and they are frequently in this struggle of ideals

158
00:13:54,040 --> 00:14:00,240
over ease for end users. And this is one of those tricky problems because this probably

159
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:04,960
affects new users to Linux more than the more experienced users that are going to be making

160
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:07,080
this decision.

161
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:13,320
And so this is a kind of representative of how Debian wants to be perceived by that class

162
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:19,400
of user. And that's probably what I find the most fascinating about this decision. Ultimately,

163
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:24,540
whatever they choose to do, I can obviously roll with. But I think it's really saying

164
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:29,280
something about who Debian is targeting, who the people that are making these decisions

165
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:31,600
feel that the project is targeting at least.

166
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:37,080
Yeah, that does have some logic to it, right? I mean, most new users, well, they're still

167
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:41,760
kind of figuring out all of our principles and ideals around free and open source software

168
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:47,160
and some of the consequences that that can imply. And I agree with you, right? Like if

169
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:50,880
you are concerned about that, which there's many legitimate reasons to be concerned about

170
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:56,160
these binary blobs, having some kind of escape hatch, like a command line option to disable

171
00:14:56,160 --> 00:15:02,280
that at boot, that might just work. I do want to add here though, you know, I think sometimes

172
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:07,480
when we discuss binary blobs, we think of fancy high end hardware. But another reason

173
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:13,640
for wanting non free firmware, by default, might be accessibility. Say a blind user is

174
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:18,040
running the installer in text to speech mode, but also needs audio firmware loaded to be

175
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:21,040
able to actually drive the installer at all.

176
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:25,280
Absolutely. And if they can't get the hardware activated, they can't even get the operating

177
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:29,880
system installed. And you know, option A seems like the most straightforward, you just include

178
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:36,360
the non free packages on the official installation media. The challenge seems to be that it requires

179
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:41,040
changes to the installer to actually fully execute this. So that way the user can be

180
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:45,360
properly notified. And in there, it seems like it's honestly pretty easy to add a check

181
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:50,280
box. And if for legality reasons, they needed to have it download at the time when you check

182
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:56,880
the box, that seems totally reasonable too. There is definitely a way to make this work

183
00:15:56,880 --> 00:16:04,080
for the end user. You know, in the case of assisted access, perhaps the project could

184
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:07,880
make an effort if they choose not to bake it into the main image, perhaps the project

185
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:13,440
could make an effort to try to put an information campaign out there that it does tell users

186
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:18,520
that need that stuff. We do have an image for you, but you'll have to go get it here.

187
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:21,840
I don't think that's a particularly great strategy, but maybe that's something they'll

188
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:25,960
like to do if they don't choose option A. We'll see, we're going to be watching this

189
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:30,260
story and if more information is shared publicly, we'll capture it and we'll share it with you
