Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, our weekly take on Linux and the open source world.

00:16.280 --> 00:20.360
This is episode 51, recorded on April 29th, 2018.

00:20.360 --> 00:21.360
I'm Chris.

00:21.360 --> 00:22.360
And I'm Joe.

00:22.360 --> 00:23.360
Hello, Joe.

00:23.360 --> 00:26.400
It's good to be back from Linux Fest Northwest and connected with you.

00:26.400 --> 00:31.240
We're going to start this week with a story that I saw lots of people sharing online.

00:31.240 --> 00:35.520
Ubuntu Touch will officially be an option for the Librem 5.

00:35.520 --> 00:41.040
Yeah, Purism have posted about this in a little bit of a confusing way, I must say.

00:41.040 --> 00:45.240
They've talked about how there's going to be three options when the Librem 5 ships.

00:45.240 --> 00:51.720
It'll either come with PureOS, PureOS with the KDE Plasma Mobile Interface, or Ubuntu

00:51.720 --> 00:53.440
Touch.

00:53.440 --> 00:57.960
And it wasn't quite clear to me whether that meant that they would be factory installing

00:57.960 --> 01:03.200
Ubuntu Touch as an option and maybe contacting their backers shortly before shipping was

01:03.200 --> 01:04.200
due.

01:04.200 --> 01:10.160
But I asked someone at the Ubiports project, and they said that, no, it won't be pre-installed,

01:10.160 --> 01:12.120
but it will be officially supported.

01:12.120 --> 01:14.840
So if you want to run it, you will have to flash it yourself.

01:14.840 --> 01:16.000
That was my understanding as well.

01:16.000 --> 01:18.200
I did a little double checking, and that was the same.

01:18.200 --> 01:22.120
I got a note from somebody at Purism that told me that's how it would work.

01:22.120 --> 01:27.240
So Purism by default on the Librem 5, with, like you said, the KDE Plasma Mobile and Ubuntu

01:27.240 --> 01:32.120
Touch images officially supported, if we step back from that for a moment and we look at

01:32.120 --> 01:35.660
what this is turning into, it's something I can start to get excited about.

01:35.660 --> 01:41.020
The Librem 5 here could become that general phone platform that allows all these different

01:41.020 --> 01:45.400
open source projects to have real hardware to try their stuff out on.

01:45.400 --> 01:51.200
And that is something that I've been wanting since 2013 when Canonical tried their crowd

01:51.200 --> 01:55.000
funder to launch the Edge phone, I think it was called.

01:55.000 --> 01:58.440
And when I saw that, I thought, gosh, you know what would be perfect about that is if

01:58.440 --> 02:04.720
it was like a PC where any open source project could load their version of a mobile operating

02:04.720 --> 02:05.840
system on there.

02:05.840 --> 02:10.760
Or as an end user, I could load something that I chose, just like I do with a PC.

02:10.760 --> 02:13.760
The Librem 5 is kind of getting us in that direction.

02:13.760 --> 02:17.580
Well, that was the promise, wasn't it, when they first did the crowd funder?

02:17.580 --> 02:21.860
And now they are continuing to, well, they haven't delivered on that promise just yet,

02:21.860 --> 02:24.840
but they're certainly continuing to promise the same thing.

02:24.840 --> 02:30.000
And maybe it could become like the Nexus 4 and 5 were, which were kind of almost like

02:30.000 --> 02:33.760
a reference hardware that everyone would make their ROMs for.

02:33.760 --> 02:37.100
And then a little bit later on, it was kind of the OnePlus One.

02:37.100 --> 02:42.640
And if the Librem 5 becomes like the ultimate hackable phone, then it's kind of win win

02:42.640 --> 02:43.880
for everyone, isn't it?

02:43.880 --> 02:48.760
They'll sell a bunch of them and the community will have a reference phone that they can

02:48.760 --> 02:49.760
target.

02:49.760 --> 02:55.920
The only note of caution that I have here is I think it might be a bit telling that

02:55.920 --> 03:01.840
everyone is very excited about the OS that isn't shipping by default on this phone.

03:01.840 --> 03:06.360
There seems to be much more attention to the fact that KDE Plasma Mobile and now Ubuntu

03:06.360 --> 03:12.040
Touch will be available on the Librem 5 and nobody in the public seems all that excited

03:12.040 --> 03:13.040
about PureOS.

03:13.040 --> 03:17.160
Well, I'm not sure how fair that is really because PureOS is essentially Debian, isn't

03:17.160 --> 03:18.160
it?

03:18.160 --> 03:19.520
It's certainly Debian based.

03:19.520 --> 03:25.280
So it means having a proper GNU slash Linux distro running with just a mobile interface,

03:25.280 --> 03:31.920
like the old Nokia, was it the N900 that was running MeeGo that was Debian underneath.

03:31.920 --> 03:37.000
And so there are a lot of people who want to have a proper GNU slash Linux phone.

03:37.000 --> 03:44.480
So maybe that hype was kind of reserved for the original announcement of it.

03:44.480 --> 03:50.240
Whereas now we're getting these announcements about KDE and Ubuntu Touch.

03:50.240 --> 03:53.920
That's just where the buzz is going to be because the buzz about PureOS was kind of

03:53.920 --> 03:54.920
at the beginning.

03:54.920 --> 03:56.120
I'd say that's a fair assessment.

03:56.120 --> 04:01.560
I do wonder if the unknown quantity of PureOS also kind of leaves me a little unenthused

04:01.560 --> 04:03.400
and I don't feel like it's just me.

04:03.400 --> 04:06.920
It's kind of been a general tood that I think I've picked up when people are talking about

04:06.920 --> 04:08.360
the Librem 5.

04:08.360 --> 04:10.160
But perhaps they'll surprise us.

04:10.160 --> 04:14.640
I'm totally willing to be pleasantly surprised by what they turn out with PureOS Mobile.

04:14.640 --> 04:18.760
Yeah, and I was kind of a bit concerned that they were hedging their bets too much.

04:18.760 --> 04:24.640
But from speaking to the people at UbiPorts, it's very much a hands off approach.

04:24.640 --> 04:29.640
It's like they will give them some hardware and support them as much as they can, but

04:29.640 --> 04:34.200
they're not going to devote loads of time and resources to developing Ubuntu Touch on

04:34.200 --> 04:35.200
it.

04:35.200 --> 04:39.200
They'll just facilitate that happening as best they can and give it their official stamp

04:39.200 --> 04:43.280
of approval, presumably pending some QA testing and stuff.

04:43.280 --> 04:44.760
I think that makes a lot of sense.

04:44.760 --> 04:48.100
It does make a lot of sense from a business point of view and it makes more sense from

04:48.100 --> 04:52.240
a kind of consumer point of view if you know that there's this backup available.

04:52.240 --> 04:59.080
I really wish that they would work with the lineage OS people because if you had that

04:59.080 --> 05:06.480
Android root as a fallback, then I'd be much more interested in buying the phone because

05:06.480 --> 05:07.840
PureOS is complete unknown.

05:07.840 --> 05:09.680
We just don't know what it's going to be like.

05:09.680 --> 05:10.680
It might be amazing.

05:10.680 --> 05:11.680
It might be terrible.

05:11.680 --> 05:14.240
We know what Ubuntu Touch is like.

05:14.240 --> 05:15.640
It's kind of in development still.

05:15.640 --> 05:18.720
It's not really daily driver worthy, I don't think.

05:18.720 --> 05:23.840
Whereas I know that with lineage, even with F-Droid, even without the Google apps, you

05:23.840 --> 05:26.560
could use it as a daily driver phone.

05:26.560 --> 05:29.760
And so I would like to see them talk more about that.

05:29.760 --> 05:33.800
They did mention it very early on and I know that the way Purism works, they're very good

05:33.800 --> 05:34.800
at marketing.

05:34.800 --> 05:39.300
They kind of drip feed everyone these announcements to keep them in the news and everything.

05:39.300 --> 05:43.200
So we might well be seeing that announcement soon that it will be kind of officially supported.

05:43.200 --> 05:45.120
I really, really hope so for everyone's sake.

05:45.120 --> 05:46.360
Yep, I completely agree.

05:46.360 --> 05:47.440
I couldn't have said it better myself.

05:47.440 --> 05:51.840
In fact, while we're talking about Purism, let's update everybody on their efforts to

05:51.840 --> 05:54.480
reverse engineer the Intel FSP.

05:54.480 --> 05:58.560
I think we've got some really big details, some good technical things we can really dig

05:58.560 --> 05:59.560
into, Joe.

05:59.560 --> 06:00.560
Yeah.

06:00.560 --> 06:05.480
Well, unfortunately, by the time I read the post about this, Intel had been in touch with

06:05.480 --> 06:11.400
them and demanded, well, at least asked nicely that they removed the technical details.

06:11.400 --> 06:14.720
And so now we don't know exactly how they've made the progress that they've made.

06:14.720 --> 06:15.720
Yeah.

06:15.720 --> 06:16.720
And now that's the story.

06:16.720 --> 06:17.720
Exactly.

06:17.720 --> 06:20.560
If Intel hadn't have done that, then we might not have even been talking about this.

06:20.560 --> 06:26.600
It would have been just another update in the long saga of reverse engineering the proprietary

06:26.600 --> 06:29.020
bits of the Intel firmware.

06:29.020 --> 06:31.320
And it might have got a quick mention here and there.

06:31.320 --> 06:35.240
But now Intel have kind of got the Streisand effect here, haven't they?

06:35.240 --> 06:36.240
Yeah.

06:36.240 --> 06:39.340
And it also tells you that they must have been getting pretty close to the mark.

06:39.340 --> 06:42.920
And then it leads one to wonder, what's Intel's end game?

06:42.920 --> 06:46.040
Are they going to do this everywhere that somebody tries to do this?

06:46.040 --> 06:49.820
Is it because there's a security concern they don't want people to know about?

06:49.820 --> 06:52.840
Is it because they're going to launch a competitive product?

06:52.840 --> 06:54.840
And I'm not sure what their angle is here.

06:54.840 --> 06:57.700
And I think it just leaves more questions and makes people wonder.

06:57.700 --> 07:01.960
And like you said, always leads to more attention on the internet.

07:01.960 --> 07:07.200
It never goes in the direction companies want it to go when they do stuff like this on the

07:07.200 --> 07:08.200
internet.

07:08.200 --> 07:09.200
Yeah.

07:09.200 --> 07:13.240
I do wonder if it's just the legal department doing what they see as their job.

07:13.240 --> 07:15.360
Because Intel's a fairly big company.

07:15.360 --> 07:22.040
And it's not like a small business like Jupyter Broadcasting where you know exactly what's

07:22.040 --> 07:23.960
going on with everything.

07:23.960 --> 07:27.020
You have different departments, don't you, in these big companies?

07:27.020 --> 07:34.200
And so it might well be that only one division of it was interested in this.

07:34.200 --> 07:37.600
And the rest of the company is kind of thinking, well, now maybe we shouldn't have done that.

07:37.600 --> 07:42.360
So am I making excuses for Intel there by saying that?

07:42.360 --> 07:43.360
Maybe I am.

07:43.360 --> 07:45.920
Because this is not a very nice thing to do, is it?

07:45.920 --> 07:51.940
If you've got people working hard on trying to make things free and open, and you are

07:51.940 --> 07:57.920
just trying to stop that and somewhat succeeding in stopping that, then I don't want to use

07:57.920 --> 07:58.920
the word evil.

07:58.920 --> 08:00.240
But it's getting close, isn't it?

08:00.240 --> 08:05.120
I think we'll know where to peg this on the evil meter depending on what happens next.

08:05.120 --> 08:08.880
Is purism going to be locked down from sharing future information?

08:08.880 --> 08:12.240
Are they going to have some sort of legal action that they get involved with to stop

08:12.240 --> 08:13.240
them?

08:13.240 --> 08:17.000
Or is it just going to go away, and they're going to have a great conversation, and everyone

08:17.000 --> 08:19.320
will just be on the same page?

08:19.320 --> 08:21.000
We don't know yet.

08:21.000 --> 08:25.000
But depending on which one of those things happens will help us peg their motivations

08:25.000 --> 08:26.960
and their evilness in this issue.

08:26.960 --> 08:27.960
Yeah.

08:27.960 --> 08:28.960
Yeah.

08:28.960 --> 08:29.960
Well, time will tell on that one.

08:29.960 --> 08:34.480
Well, speaking of being evil and not being evil, let's talk about Chrome OS.

08:34.480 --> 08:39.680
And it seems that we are a step closer to being able to run proper Linux applications

08:39.680 --> 08:40.680
on Chrome OS.

08:40.680 --> 08:41.680
Yeah.

08:41.680 --> 08:46.720
That's the worst-held secret, because more and more evidence just keeps coming out.

08:46.720 --> 08:51.480
And entrepreneur Reddit users are digging through development builds, and they have

08:51.480 --> 08:56.760
found evidence of a new Linux terminal feature coming, as well as perhaps even more than

08:56.760 --> 08:57.760
that.

08:57.760 --> 08:58.760
Yeah.

08:58.760 --> 09:01.440
These Linux applications are going to be running in containers, by the looks of things.

09:01.440 --> 09:04.560
It looks like installing this terminal will download the various bits and pieces that

09:04.560 --> 09:07.260
you need to make those containers run.

09:07.260 --> 09:13.840
And then you'll have proper native-ish Linux applications, which suddenly makes Chrome

09:13.840 --> 09:16.800
OS a much more attractive proposition, doesn't it?

09:16.800 --> 09:19.840
And it surprised me how far they seem to be taking this.

09:19.840 --> 09:26.440
So these Linux apps on Chrome OS are going to also have a full-fledged GTK theme that

09:26.440 --> 09:31.860
is based off of Adaptea, a popular material-designed GTK theme.

09:31.860 --> 09:36.680
And they are strapping in a sort of a more eccentric, bluish kind of more what they call

09:36.680 --> 09:38.320
an electric version of the theme.

09:38.320 --> 09:43.000
So when these Linux applications launch, they'll sort of fit in with Google's material look

09:43.000 --> 09:46.240
that you see in GApps and other Google properties.

09:46.240 --> 09:51.720
This is a step I didn't actually see coming, but I guess it does kind of complete the product.

09:51.720 --> 09:56.160
Well, yes, but I didn't see it coming, because I had pictured this in the same way that you

09:56.160 --> 09:59.520
see the subsystem for Linux on Windows.

09:59.520 --> 10:03.200
I thought it was going to be command-line applications aimed at developers.

10:03.200 --> 10:08.960
Why do you need to have the terminal themed with a GTK theme that looks all material-designed

10:08.960 --> 10:12.160
and everything, unless you're going to have GUI applications?

10:12.160 --> 10:14.960
Which begs the question, what are we going to get here?

10:14.960 --> 10:18.580
Are we going to get a full repository, or what?

10:18.580 --> 10:21.680
Is it going to be a few proprietary applications like Skype?

10:21.680 --> 10:23.160
Is it going to be snaps, or what?

10:23.160 --> 10:24.160
Who knows?

10:24.160 --> 10:28.520
And those entrepreneur users I mentioned over at Reddit have already gotten Wine and Android

10:28.520 --> 10:32.360
Studio running on these Chromebooks with this development channel.

10:32.360 --> 10:35.680
So it's pretty complicated applications that you can get up and running with this thing.

10:35.680 --> 10:39.600
Well, I'm not surprised that members of the community have managed to hack it and get

10:39.600 --> 10:41.240
these graphical applications running.

10:41.240 --> 10:43.120
They did that on the subsystem for Windows.

10:43.120 --> 10:50.600
But it seems that with this GTK theme that Google's going to support that sort of natively

10:50.600 --> 10:51.600
and officially.

10:51.600 --> 10:54.520
Yeah, this development just got a lot more interesting.

10:54.520 --> 10:58.840
I did not expect this strong of an end-user angle to the story.

10:58.840 --> 11:01.800
So definitely going to be following this one with some interest.

11:01.800 --> 11:07.000
Yeah, and it could be very good news for the rest of the Linux community, because Chromebooks

11:07.000 --> 11:10.240
are a massive install base compared to the Linux desktop.

11:10.240 --> 11:15.040
And if you've got Linux applications available for Chrome OS, then it's going to mean a lot

11:15.040 --> 11:19.680
more development resources go towards that, and a lot more eyes on the code, and just

11:19.680 --> 11:21.240
all of the good stuff that comes with that.

11:21.240 --> 11:23.280
So I am quite hopeful for this.

11:23.280 --> 11:24.280
Me too.

11:24.280 --> 11:26.520
And I mean, just selfishly, I think about my kids.

11:26.520 --> 11:31.560
I would love to be able to just buy them Chromebooks that could run Linux applications.

11:31.560 --> 11:35.400
They have Chromebooks as part of their school curriculum already.

11:35.400 --> 11:40.720
So this might also mean that thousands of students in the US that have these Chromebooks

11:40.720 --> 11:43.640
may also start to get desktop Linux applications.

11:43.640 --> 11:44.880
Well, you never know.

11:44.880 --> 11:47.760
You might even end up being able to run Firefox on a Chromebook.

11:47.760 --> 11:48.760
That'd be something, wouldn't it?

11:48.760 --> 11:50.320
I hadn't thought of that.

11:50.320 --> 11:52.640
That might be the first thing I'd try.

11:52.640 --> 11:53.640
Definitely, yeah.

11:53.640 --> 11:58.360
Well, speaking of Linux applications, one of the biggest ones is GIMP, the GNU Image

11:58.360 --> 12:00.280
Manipulation Program.

12:00.280 --> 12:03.500
And that has had a massive update this week.

12:03.500 --> 12:09.200
Version 2.10 is out, and I think this is the biggest release of a GIMP I've ever witnessed.

12:09.200 --> 12:14.520
One thing that's immediately noticeable about the new GIMP is they have a dark theme that

12:14.520 --> 12:18.520
they say focuses on the content and less on the UI.

12:18.520 --> 12:20.320
And I got to say, it actually does look pretty good.

12:20.320 --> 12:26.320
It sort of takes that UI oversaturation that I used to get from GIMP and turns it down

12:26.320 --> 12:27.320
a few notches.

12:27.320 --> 12:29.320
So they've actually successfully pulled it off.

12:29.320 --> 12:32.260
But the stuff they've been working on for a long time, that's like all the goodies that

12:32.260 --> 12:37.360
are on the back end, like the new implementation of GEGL, which is a big prerequisite for what

12:37.360 --> 12:41.820
they're going to be working on in future versions of GIMP, like non-destructive editing, high-bit

12:41.820 --> 12:47.580
depth support for colors, up to 32-bit color channels now, multi-threading that allows

12:47.580 --> 12:50.520
GIMP to use multiple cores for processing.

12:50.520 --> 12:55.380
And if you've got the OpenCL driver set up, GPU side processing as well.

12:55.380 --> 12:59.120
And that's just the tip of the iceberg on the new stuff that's coming to GIMP.

12:59.120 --> 13:03.560
This is a massive, massive release and really has them positioned, too, for future releases

13:03.560 --> 13:07.640
like way, way down the road and even more immediate releases that might feature things

13:07.640 --> 13:10.120
like GTK3 support soon.

13:10.120 --> 13:17.180
Also, one of my personal favorite new features in GIMP 2.10 is now it has baked-in darktable

13:17.180 --> 13:19.860
support for opening RAW files.

13:19.860 --> 13:23.060
So now my darktable and my GIMP can work together.

13:23.060 --> 13:24.060
It's a kumbaya, Joe.

13:24.060 --> 13:27.360
Yeah, I don't think we can really overstate how big this update is.

13:27.360 --> 13:30.920
I mean, it's been six years since the last major update.

13:30.920 --> 13:33.040
And this changes the game, I think.

13:33.040 --> 13:36.960
It makes it into something that professionals could actually use.

13:36.960 --> 13:40.560
Whereas before, if you really wanted to, you kind of could.

13:40.560 --> 13:44.520
But now they've really pushed the features and the backend stuff that you're talking

13:44.520 --> 13:50.860
about and made it really, I think, a professional-grade application.

13:50.860 --> 13:56.120
And they've also improved import and export of Adobe PSD files.

13:56.120 --> 13:59.600
And I'm particularly curious to see how that works, open up some of our old Photoshop files

13:59.600 --> 14:02.960
that artists have sent us stuff and see if I can work with them in GIMP now.

14:02.960 --> 14:06.760
Well, you kind of could do that already, but it's good to see improvements there because

14:06.760 --> 14:07.960
sometimes it was a bit flaky.

14:07.960 --> 14:11.600
I mean, I've got quite a few old Photoshop files and everything.

14:11.600 --> 14:16.520
And I think that maybe the support for the older versions of Photoshop were better, but

14:16.520 --> 14:19.680
now you're going to have the more modern versions of Photoshop supported there.

14:19.680 --> 14:20.680
So that's good as well.

14:20.680 --> 14:23.480
Yeah, one of the things they improved with their Photoshop file support is the different

14:23.480 --> 14:24.680
light layer.

14:24.680 --> 14:27.840
In Photoshop, you can have hard light, vivid light, these different things.

14:27.840 --> 14:30.720
GIMP used to drop that when you would save to PSD.

14:30.720 --> 14:35.440
And that has been added now, which is something that's great for outlines and borders of some

14:35.440 --> 14:39.400
of the artwork that has been sent into the network, is people use that functionality

14:39.400 --> 14:40.600
and GIMP would just lose it.

14:40.600 --> 14:42.240
It would just like couldn't see it at all.

14:42.240 --> 14:45.320
So I'm very happy that's in there because I think that's going to solve some of the

14:45.320 --> 14:46.320
problems we had here.

14:46.320 --> 14:51.440
Again, kind of a personal reason I like these updates, but it's really good stuff to see.

14:51.440 --> 14:54.920
And I think there's so much stuff in here, it's going to be like that for everybody.

14:54.920 --> 14:55.920
Yeah.

14:55.920 --> 14:57.960
And I kind of introduced this by saying it's a Linux application.

14:57.960 --> 14:58.960
Of course it is.

14:58.960 --> 14:59.960
That's what we know it for.

14:59.960 --> 15:03.560
But don't forget that it is also available on Windows and Mac.

15:03.560 --> 15:08.520
And it's a good kind of taster for people of free and open source software.

15:08.520 --> 15:13.200
And it's that old adage of how you convert people over to Linux is first you start with

15:13.200 --> 15:14.200
the application.

15:14.200 --> 15:19.440
So if you can install this and Firefox and Thunderbird or whatever on a Windows box,

15:19.440 --> 15:21.480
then it's much easier to make the transition.

15:21.480 --> 15:27.560
And now that it's this free alternative to Photoshop that is really up there in terms

15:27.560 --> 15:31.640
of features, I think it's going to be a much easier sell for people.

15:31.640 --> 15:35.400
They're thinking, well, why am I paying this money for Creative Cloud when really I only

15:35.400 --> 15:37.100
need this set of features?

15:37.100 --> 15:40.640
And maybe if I move over to GIMP, then I'm going to save myself a bunch of money.

15:40.640 --> 15:50.760
And then they kind of see the joys of free and open source software.

15:50.760 --> 15:55.760
You can get a system spun up on their infrastructure in less than 55 seconds.

15:55.760 --> 16:02.080
Everything uses SSDs from the $5 a month droplets that are unbelievably good priced all the

16:02.080 --> 16:06.800
way up to the systems that have hundreds of gigs of RAMs, lots of the CPUs, lots of all

16:06.800 --> 16:07.960
the things.

16:07.960 --> 16:12.600
Everything's using SSD in between, including their spaces storage and their block storage,

16:12.600 --> 16:16.400
which makes it super easy to add additional storage to your droplets.

16:16.400 --> 16:22.160
And they have Ubuntu, CentOS, Debian, Fedora, CoreOS, and free BSD to choose from, dio.co

16:22.160 --> 16:23.220
slash action.

16:23.220 --> 16:27.220
Go there and try it out and get a $100 credit for a new account.

16:27.220 --> 16:32.760
If you sign up at dio.co slash action, they'll give you $100 of DigitalOcean credit to play

16:32.760 --> 16:33.760
around.

16:33.760 --> 16:35.360
Now, my favorite rig is three cents an hour.

16:35.360 --> 16:39.000
So think about how long $100 is going to last you.

16:39.000 --> 16:43.220
And something you can play around with that I don't ever really talk about is the DigitalOcean

16:43.220 --> 16:45.640
command line for your Linux box.

16:45.640 --> 16:51.680
The DOCTL is an open source utility for managing your droplets and other resources from your

16:51.680 --> 16:52.680
command line.

16:52.680 --> 16:56.220
Now, I'm not telling you how to do your job, but you put that magic sauce in a drop down

16:56.220 --> 16:58.040
terminal like your wake or quake.

16:58.040 --> 17:01.000
You hit that F12 key, boom, you got your DOCTL right there.

17:01.000 --> 17:04.180
You're issuing commands, you hit F12, that thing slides right back up.

17:04.180 --> 17:06.040
It's beautiful.

17:06.040 --> 17:07.440
You can build a system.

17:07.440 --> 17:09.120
It's unbelievably fast.

17:09.120 --> 17:10.480
You can put it in production.

17:10.480 --> 17:16.440
You can use it for testing, or you can just use it to learn, dio.co slash action.

17:16.440 --> 17:23.660
Okay, let's talk about Ubuntu, 1804 LTS was released this week.

17:23.660 --> 17:30.320
The first LTS of the desktop with the new GNOME interface and also a huge release for

17:30.320 --> 17:34.160
the cloud and IoT and containers and all that kind of stuff.

17:34.160 --> 17:38.720
But I suppose we should probably start with the desktop and its flavors, so 1804 proper

17:38.720 --> 17:41.120
and all the flavors have been released.

17:41.120 --> 17:43.120
That means it's an LTS of Kubuntu.

17:43.120 --> 17:50.400
We have an LTS of Zubuntu, as well as Ubuntu Budgie, Ubuntu Studio, Kylin, and Ubuntu Mate.

17:50.400 --> 17:52.980
And they're all really, really great releases.

17:52.980 --> 17:56.880
If you're an Ubuntu user, you have a tough decision ahead of you.

17:56.880 --> 18:00.840
Let's start with Mate, because I've talked a lot with Martin Wimpress about their journey,

18:00.840 --> 18:03.320
their multi-year journey to this release.

18:03.320 --> 18:07.280
We have the improved Mutiny desktop layout, which comes with that keyboard-friendly HUD

18:07.280 --> 18:09.160
just like Unity did.

18:09.160 --> 18:14.920
This is a very faithful re-implementation of the Unity desktop, and it's based on Mate

18:14.920 --> 18:21.620
1.20, which means you're getting high DPI support, quarter window tiling, hardware acceleration

18:21.620 --> 18:28.360
in Marco, the window manager, when supported, and Joe's favorite feature, color emojis.

18:28.360 --> 18:33.240
I think it's quite telling that you've started with Ubuntu Mate rather than Ubuntu proper,

18:33.240 --> 18:39.560
because there are things to talk about with Ubuntu proper, but ultimately, it's not very

18:39.560 --> 18:41.520
different from 17.10, is it?

18:41.520 --> 18:44.480
As we suspected, I think, there was nothing too bold here.

18:44.480 --> 18:46.640
17.10 was really supposed to be a proving ground.

18:46.640 --> 18:49.020
That way, 18.04 would be really solid.

18:49.020 --> 18:54.000
And the reality is, the flavors based around Ubuntu haven't been going through this massive

18:54.000 --> 18:55.000
transition.

18:55.000 --> 18:57.920
So this has really been a polished cycle for them.

18:57.920 --> 19:03.040
Personally, I am very excited about Kubuntu 18.04.

19:03.040 --> 19:09.880
It's the perfect lining up of Plasma 5.12 LTS, Qt LTS, and of course, Ubuntu 18.04 LTS.

19:09.880 --> 19:16.160
So for three years, it's LTS across the entire stack, from the kernel up to the user land

19:16.160 --> 19:17.160
applications.

19:17.160 --> 19:21.760
That's huge for me, personally, in my production environment, deploying that everywhere this

19:21.760 --> 19:22.760
week.

19:22.760 --> 19:24.440
Very excited about Kubuntu 18.04.

19:24.440 --> 19:31.040
It's not that Ubuntu proper isn't a great product, it's exactly what it needs to be,

19:31.040 --> 19:33.360
just a solid, predictable release.

19:33.360 --> 19:36.200
Yeah, one thing of note, you mentioned the various flavors there.

19:36.200 --> 19:38.200
Ubuntu Studio is not an LTS.

19:38.200 --> 19:40.840
That's only getting nine months, which is very unusual.

19:40.840 --> 19:45.000
But that's because that particular project is kind of a little bit up in the air at the

19:45.000 --> 19:46.000
moment.

19:46.000 --> 19:49.320
They're restructuring, and they just cannot commit at the moment to a full three years

19:49.320 --> 19:50.760
on 18.04.

19:50.760 --> 19:55.240
So we'll have to see how 18.10 shakes out for them, which is a bit of a shame.

19:55.240 --> 19:59.360
But I suppose in the meantime, you still got Xubuntu, which I've tried out.

19:59.360 --> 20:02.200
And again, I love it as usual.

20:02.200 --> 20:04.000
There's just not much to say about it.

20:04.000 --> 20:08.720
They've swapped out some of the GNOME applications for Marte applications, but really, you don't

20:08.720 --> 20:11.240
really notice the difference, or at least I don't.

20:11.240 --> 20:15.040
They just do what they're supposed to do and just stay out of the way.

20:15.040 --> 20:17.720
And it's just yet another solid release from Xubuntu.

20:17.720 --> 20:21.400
I wish I had more to say about it to try and sell it, but it's what I've been using for

20:21.400 --> 20:22.680
10 years now.

20:22.680 --> 20:27.520
I think 8.04 was the first one that I used, so it is exactly 10 years, and I've never

20:27.520 --> 20:28.640
had a problem with it.

20:28.640 --> 20:33.020
It's nice, though, to see that Xubuntu's default theme, Greybird GTK, got an update with improved

20:33.020 --> 20:34.020
high DPI support.

20:34.020 --> 20:39.760
But shifting away from the desktop just for a moment, I think this is also accumulation

20:39.760 --> 20:41.800
of a lot of efforts by Canonical.

20:41.800 --> 20:47.760
18.04 ships with a ton of applications available as a SNAP, and SNAPs are first-class citizens

20:47.760 --> 20:48.980
in 18.04 now.

20:48.980 --> 20:51.960
They're also in an extremely good position market-wise.

20:51.960 --> 20:56.920
The market's very hungry for this next release and very comfortable that 16.04 is going to

20:56.920 --> 20:58.040
be updated for a while.

20:58.040 --> 21:02.400
This is a great position because the current product, 16.04, isn't failing.

21:02.400 --> 21:05.540
People are totally happy with it, but the new product is compelling.

21:05.540 --> 21:07.560
That's a strong move for Canonical.

21:07.560 --> 21:12.160
Then you look at some of their future partnerships that they have to push 18.04 around.

21:12.160 --> 21:16.160
For example, the upcoming update to Windows, which will make it easy to deploy Ubuntu inside

21:16.160 --> 21:19.840
Hyper-V, and Canonical and Microsoft work together to tailor that.

21:19.840 --> 21:24.440
In their announcement, they have quotes in here from Google's product manager at Cloud

21:24.440 --> 21:28.920
AI talking about how 18.04 is going to be a great OS for them with machine learning

21:28.920 --> 21:30.480
and artificial intelligence.

21:30.480 --> 21:31.960
This is a strong release.

21:31.960 --> 21:37.320
It is, and one of my favorite things about it is this minimal install option.

21:37.320 --> 21:41.300
We talked about that when it was announced, but it's all I'm going to do from now on,

21:41.300 --> 21:42.300
on any flavor.

21:42.300 --> 21:43.300
100%.

21:43.300 --> 21:44.300
I want to underscore that point.

21:44.300 --> 21:47.880
I am so pleased with the way this minimal installer thing has turned out across all

21:47.880 --> 21:48.880
the flavors.

21:48.880 --> 21:51.720
I've used it for all the Kubuntu systems we deployed, and it's perfect.

21:51.720 --> 21:54.000
I didn't really feel like anything was missing.

21:54.000 --> 21:55.560
I don't need the PIM suite.

21:55.560 --> 21:57.960
I have all the basic essentials.

21:57.960 --> 22:02.620
They nailed this feature so well that it leaves you thinking, why the hell wasn't this done

22:02.620 --> 22:03.620
years ago?

22:03.620 --> 22:04.620
Yeah.

22:04.620 --> 22:09.480
Well, Zebuntu was the first flavor to think about it and implement it, blazing the trail

22:09.480 --> 22:10.480
there.

22:10.480 --> 22:11.480
Yeah.

22:11.480 --> 22:13.880
But that was with a separate ISO, whereas now, as part of the installer, it just makes

22:13.880 --> 22:15.160
so much more sense to me.

22:15.160 --> 22:16.160
Yeah.

22:16.160 --> 22:20.320
And although we underplayed the GNOME desktop release, they did polish it up a little bit.

22:20.320 --> 22:25.920
It looks nice, and the Nautilus theme, I think, is the classiest-looking one I've seen on

22:25.920 --> 22:26.920
any desktop.

22:26.920 --> 22:28.400
But these are just my first impressions.

22:28.400 --> 22:34.520
I honestly plan to let 1804 and its different flavors marinate for a while in my studio,

22:34.520 --> 22:38.560
and then I'm going to do a follow-up review in a week or two with some several weeks'

22:38.560 --> 22:40.360
experience with the released version.

22:40.360 --> 22:41.360
Yeah.

22:41.360 --> 22:46.900
And I think that realistically, you have to wait for the 0.1 release for most people to

22:46.900 --> 22:48.660
actually upgrade to this.

22:48.660 --> 22:53.440
People who install an LTS, stay on it, and then wait to be prompted by the GUI updater

22:53.440 --> 22:57.220
before they actually do it, they're not going to see this yet.

22:57.220 --> 23:03.640
And that gives a little bit more time for Canonical to polish it and make sure all of

23:03.640 --> 23:09.360
the corner cases are sorted out before you have this mass upgrade when the 0.1 release

23:09.360 --> 23:10.360
happens.

23:10.360 --> 23:13.320
But Joe, who has time to wait around for a 0.1 release?

23:13.320 --> 23:16.360
I've got Nintendo Switches to install Ubuntu on.

23:16.360 --> 23:17.360
Gotta get going.

23:17.360 --> 23:21.740
Yeah, Ewan West covered this exploit for the Switch in TechSnap 365, so go and have a listen

23:21.740 --> 23:23.640
to that if you want to hear more technical details.

23:23.640 --> 23:29.600
But it was just funny to see Ubuntu 1804, the desktop, running on a Switch.

23:29.600 --> 23:33.480
But as you can see in the photo of it, there is a USB cable plugged into it, which shows

23:33.480 --> 23:36.520
that it is still a tethered jailbreak, as they say.

23:36.520 --> 23:40.080
But I have to say, it seems like it's more functional than if you were to install Ubuntu

23:40.080 --> 23:45.220
on a MacBook, because they've got 3D acceleration, it's got Wi-Fi, the touchscreen works, Bluetooth

23:45.220 --> 23:48.480
seems to be working, and the light sensor seems to be working.

23:48.480 --> 23:52.260
What isn't working at this point is audio and Joy-Cons, but something tells me that's

23:52.260 --> 23:53.680
not too far behind.

23:53.680 --> 23:55.400
Yeah, probably.

23:55.400 --> 23:58.940
One thing we haven't mentioned is the move back to Xorg.

23:58.940 --> 24:01.120
They're not shipping Wayland by default anymore.

24:01.120 --> 24:05.620
Again, we talked about that when it was announced, but I said it was sensible then, and I say

24:05.620 --> 24:11.700
it's sensible now, because this is a long-term support release, five years for the main version.

24:11.700 --> 24:15.660
It just makes total sense to me, stick on X for now, and then they'll probably go back

24:15.660 --> 24:20.920
to Wayland for 18.10, and then hopefully by 2024 it will be ready.

24:20.920 --> 24:23.600
You'd think in a couple of years it would be, but you never know.

24:23.600 --> 24:25.200
I do think it was the right move.

24:25.200 --> 24:30.400
As I was deploying it here in the studio, and one, two, three, four boxes now have it

24:30.400 --> 24:34.960
in here, and I just thought to myself, you know, I'm really glad I don't have this unknown

24:34.960 --> 24:35.960
quantity.

24:35.960 --> 24:40.120
I like Wayland, and I don't mind even using it on my workstation, but here in the studio

24:40.120 --> 24:45.600
that's running 24-7, I was just, I was thankful to go with something that I knew was tried

24:45.600 --> 24:46.600
and true.

24:46.600 --> 24:48.800
Yeah, very sensible decision by them there.

24:48.800 --> 24:50.760
You know what else is a sensible decision?

24:50.760 --> 24:54.960
