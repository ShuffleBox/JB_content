Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, our weekly take on the Linux and open source world.

00:16.520 --> 00:20.500
This is episode 69 recorded on September 2nd, 2018.

00:20.500 --> 00:21.500
I'm Joe.

00:21.500 --> 00:22.500
And I'm Wes.

00:22.500 --> 00:23.500
Hello, Wes.

00:23.500 --> 00:25.800
Thank you very much for standing in for Chris while he's off sick.

00:25.800 --> 00:31.280
We've got a lot to get through today, so let's start with a huge release from the UbiPorts

00:31.280 --> 00:33.640
team, Ubuntu Touch OTA 4.

00:33.640 --> 00:38.880
It's been a long, difficult eight months of work, but it's finally here.

00:38.880 --> 00:41.600
You might be wondering, why does this matter?

00:41.600 --> 00:46.440
Well, if you ask the project, this is really a fresh start.

00:46.440 --> 00:51.040
This is where they can build off a new solid foundation, and that foundation is Ubuntu

00:51.040 --> 00:52.040
16.04.

00:52.040 --> 00:58.380
Yeah, they say that it's the official starting point of the project, because really, when

00:58.380 --> 01:03.280
Canonical dropped the project just over a year ago, a year and a half ago at this point,

01:03.280 --> 01:07.980
it was based on 15.04, which wasn't really supported anymore.

01:07.980 --> 01:12.860
And so they've been playing catch up, trying to get it up to 16.04, because all the plans

01:12.860 --> 01:18.620
that they have are based on it first getting to 16.04, which is a supported code base,

01:18.620 --> 01:23.400
at least for another few years, which means they can stop worrying about the upstream

01:23.400 --> 01:27.400
stuff, at least for the time being, and concentrate on all of the cool new features that they

01:27.400 --> 01:29.420
want to add, things like Andbox.

01:29.420 --> 01:31.840
And so that's why this makes it so important.

01:31.840 --> 01:35.160
And it's great to see that they finally got this out.

01:35.160 --> 01:38.140
I've been waiting for it for a long, long time.

01:38.140 --> 01:39.140
And it's pretty good.

01:39.140 --> 01:41.560
I've tried it out on a Nexus 5, and it seems pretty solid.

01:41.560 --> 01:45.420
They do mention a couple of bugs with the camera that they're still working on.

01:45.420 --> 01:50.840
And the main browser has a few issues, and so they recommend that you try a different

01:50.840 --> 01:51.840
one.

01:51.840 --> 01:54.560
But it's a good base.

01:54.560 --> 02:01.520
And this is, as far as I'm concerned, the only hope really, apart from things like lineage,

02:01.520 --> 02:06.680
the only hope for a free and open source Linux based mobile operating system.

02:06.680 --> 02:10.920
It does seem like there are a number of just small, you know, ease of life improvements

02:10.920 --> 02:11.920
in this one.

02:11.920 --> 02:14.900
I noticed a big one was the addition of Wake Lock support.

02:14.900 --> 02:17.800
And if you're going to be using this all day as your real phone, you probably want all

02:17.800 --> 02:19.320
the battery life you can get.

02:19.320 --> 02:23.840
Yeah, that's something that previous versions really suffered from.

02:23.840 --> 02:29.600
Even if you just turned Wi-Fi off, put it on airplane mode, turn the screen off, left

02:29.600 --> 02:33.400
it on your desk, after a day or so, the battery was just dead.

02:33.400 --> 02:37.920
Whereas with Android, I mean, I've got some devices that I do that with, and I come back

02:37.920 --> 02:41.320
a month later and they're down like 5%, 6%.

02:41.320 --> 02:44.160
That's one of those features you just have to have, especially if we want to play outside

02:44.160 --> 02:47.200
the hobbyist space and make this something anyone could use.

02:47.200 --> 02:49.920
Well, I think that is the ultimate goal.

02:49.920 --> 02:51.440
But they just had to get here first.

02:51.440 --> 02:56.800
And I've been listening to their Q&As every couple of weeks for the past year or so.

02:56.800 --> 03:01.680
And I've just seen the development, you know, I've heard about the development, week in,

03:01.680 --> 03:04.560
week out, and it's been getting closer and closer.

03:04.560 --> 03:07.960
And it must be a huge relief for them to get here.

03:07.960 --> 03:11.040
And I just want to see what they're going to do next.

03:11.040 --> 03:12.040
Definitely a project milestone.

03:12.040 --> 03:17.080
Now, if you are looking to upgrade right away, you might find some ABI compatibility issues,

03:17.080 --> 03:21.400
but they also have a handy upgrade wizard that will try and upgrade any apps that do

03:21.400 --> 03:24.640
have a new 1604 base automatically.

03:24.640 --> 03:26.160
It's very easy to install as well.

03:26.160 --> 03:31.160
They've got their GUI installer, which I think they've got a snap, an app image, and a deb

03:31.160 --> 03:32.160
for.

03:32.160 --> 03:33.160
I use the app image.

03:33.160 --> 03:34.160
I'd used that before.

03:34.160 --> 03:38.080
Again, worked flawlessly, got it installed on my Nexus 5 straight away.

03:38.080 --> 03:39.080
Very straightforward.

03:39.080 --> 03:44.800
So, if you've been waiting to try this out, you can pick up a Nexus 5 or some of the other

03:44.800 --> 03:49.000
support devices pretty cheaply on eBay or Craigslist or Gumtree or whatever.

03:49.000 --> 03:51.160
I would say now is the time.

03:51.160 --> 03:55.580
Well speaking of new and exciting software releases, this past week also saw the release

03:55.580 --> 03:59.600
of Linux Mint Debian Edition version 3, Cindy.

03:59.600 --> 04:04.840
Yeah, this is based on Debian Stretch, and this time there's only a Cinnamon version.

04:04.840 --> 04:08.880
They've dropped the Mate version, which kind of makes sense if you want to streamline your

04:08.880 --> 04:10.840
development resources.

04:10.840 --> 04:16.480
But why we're talking about this is I kind of thought LMDE was dead because the last

04:16.480 --> 04:20.360
version was released in April 2015.

04:20.360 --> 04:25.860
That was Linux Mint Debian Edition 2, and it had a few updates, but we haven't really

04:25.860 --> 04:28.240
heard that much about it.

04:28.240 --> 04:29.760
And suddenly, here we are.

04:29.760 --> 04:34.760
Yes, we've seen some betas, and I kind of knew this was coming, but it is proof positive

04:34.760 --> 04:40.360
that Clem and the team are serious about being based on Debian, at least having that option,

04:40.360 --> 04:43.520
that backup plan that we always talked about.

04:43.520 --> 04:49.320
And here we are, and I've tried it out, albeit not extensively, but it seems to work pretty

04:49.320 --> 04:50.320
well.

04:50.320 --> 04:52.600
It's just Cinnamon on top of Debian as far as I can see.

04:52.600 --> 04:57.080
Yeah, it is structured just a little bit different than the standard Linux Mint, especially since

04:57.080 --> 05:00.000
LMDE doesn't have point releases.

05:00.000 --> 05:05.040
So every so often, as you just said, we'll see big upgrades to the underlying Debian

05:05.040 --> 05:08.960
Edition, and then all the rest of the time, new Linux Mint features will just go right

05:08.960 --> 05:09.960
in.

05:09.960 --> 05:14.320
Maybe it was unfair for me to say that it's just Cinnamon on top of Debian because there

05:14.320 --> 05:19.200
is a lot of Mint stuff in there, things like the backup tool, which is really useful.

05:19.200 --> 05:21.600
And they have forked these apps, haven't they?

05:21.600 --> 05:25.720
And they have made it their own, like it or not.

05:25.720 --> 05:26.760
There's no doubting that.

05:26.760 --> 05:29.600
They have put their stamp on this thing.

05:29.600 --> 05:32.280
And I think that it's a bit of an acquired taste.

05:32.280 --> 05:37.840
It seems to be very popular with some people, but then I hear a bit of scorn poured on it

05:37.840 --> 05:38.840
from other people.

05:38.840 --> 05:46.580
I mean, I remember they had the security snafu, actually that must be a few years ago now.

05:46.580 --> 05:50.000
But they have slowly started to improve stuff like that, haven't they?

05:50.000 --> 05:51.720
They're definitely putting the time in.

05:51.720 --> 05:56.120
It seems like a passion project that really has some good intentions but doesn't always

05:56.120 --> 06:01.160
have time or maybe just the inclination to do what we might call the right things.

06:01.160 --> 06:05.680
A couple of years ago, they did have that big breach where some infected ISOs were served

06:05.680 --> 06:06.680
up.

06:06.680 --> 06:10.800
Now, these days, they do host their GPG signatures and their checksums on another site, which

06:10.800 --> 06:11.800
is great.

06:11.800 --> 06:13.440
But it is still pretty difficult.

06:13.440 --> 06:16.360
You have to jump through four or five levels of links just to get those files.

06:16.360 --> 06:22.480
So you can tell that maybe new user ease, they do a good job of having a lot of documentation

06:22.480 --> 06:25.460
just about the common issues new users will have.

06:25.460 --> 06:28.640
Maybe not a distro for someone a little more experienced and has a little more taste.

06:28.640 --> 06:30.680
Well, you're saying that people who use it have got no taste.

06:30.680 --> 06:32.840
You're going to get some hate mail about that, I think.

06:32.840 --> 06:33.840
You're probably right.

06:33.840 --> 06:34.840
Okay.

06:34.840 --> 06:36.840
Well, we better move on.

06:36.840 --> 06:39.940
Mozilla have been up to a couple of good things lately.

06:39.940 --> 06:42.720
First of all, they have published user data.

06:42.720 --> 06:50.920
And they're basing this user data from a representative 10% sample from the release beta, ESR, and

06:50.920 --> 06:52.220
other channels.

06:52.220 --> 06:55.760
And they're properly anonymizing this data, and they're going to publish it weekly, which

06:55.760 --> 06:56.760
is pretty impressive.

06:56.760 --> 07:02.400
This is definitely a case of Mozilla putting their data where their mouth has been.

07:02.400 --> 07:05.000
It's nice to see this level of transparency.

07:05.000 --> 07:09.600
And it does seem like they've had an eye to trying to give good general high level information

07:09.600 --> 07:12.100
about how Firefox is actually used.

07:12.100 --> 07:15.960
So it started off a couple of years ago with just a hardware report.

07:15.960 --> 07:20.360
And now you're getting a lot more information, things like the number of active clients in

07:20.360 --> 07:25.320
the past 365 days in an effort to try to round out seasonal effects.

07:25.320 --> 07:29.720
And then of course, a lot more detailed things that can be broken down by operating system

07:29.720 --> 07:31.760
as well as top 10 countries.

07:31.760 --> 07:35.980
It was interesting to see how active the users were in each country, because it's one thing

07:35.980 --> 07:40.840
to have the browser open, but to actually be interacting with it, and how many hours

07:40.840 --> 07:42.040
per day.

07:42.040 --> 07:48.760
And well, all I can say is USA number one, we always are.

07:48.760 --> 07:54.000
Unfortunately, Linux, well, I don't know, is this unfortunate Linux kind of round about

07:54.000 --> 07:59.720
3% ish, 2.5 to 3% is kind of to be expected, isn't it?

07:59.720 --> 08:01.560
Most of it's Windows 7 and Windows 10.

08:01.560 --> 08:07.200
Yeah, I would like to hope that is just an indication of maybe one, that Firefox has

08:07.200 --> 08:11.720
some good success, even in the proprietary operating system world, and two, that as much

08:11.720 --> 08:16.320
as we like to think we represent ourselves well, well, there's just not that many Linux

08:16.320 --> 08:17.320
users out there.

08:17.320 --> 08:22.960
But you would think that Linux users would be more likely to use a free software browser

08:22.960 --> 08:23.960
than Chrome.

08:23.960 --> 08:28.600
Although I suppose a lot of Linux users are pragmatic, and if websites don't load properly

08:28.600 --> 08:30.800
in Firefox, they're just going to fire up Chrome.

08:30.800 --> 08:31.840
That is probably part of it.

08:31.840 --> 08:35.640
I think too, there's a lot of applications that maybe have some desktop equivalents in

08:35.640 --> 08:40.400
the Windows or Mac world that are relegated to perhaps web apps that work better in Chrome.

08:40.400 --> 08:41.960
Yeah, that's true.

08:41.960 --> 08:46.880
But unfortunately, they didn't publish any data from the mobile version of Firefox, but

08:46.880 --> 08:50.000
they do hope to do that at some point soon.

08:50.000 --> 08:55.320
That would be interesting, although I fear that may be even more depressing for Linux

08:55.320 --> 08:56.760
users at least.

08:56.760 --> 08:57.760
It might be.

08:57.760 --> 09:01.800
I will say, Joe, that I am a Firefox on mobile user myself.

09:01.800 --> 09:05.040
I've been really impressed with just its general usefulness.

09:05.040 --> 09:10.400
It has a really nice save for later feature, and their mobile reading is I think among

09:10.400 --> 09:11.400
the best.

09:11.400 --> 09:13.880
Is it better than Chrome on Android for that though?

09:13.880 --> 09:19.640
Because Chrome's got a fairly good mobile view option.

09:19.640 --> 09:25.160
It really does, but I find that Firefox just works better on a wider array of sites, especially

09:25.160 --> 09:30.680
doing show research, et cetera, on sometimes some rather ad-filled websites.

09:30.680 --> 09:34.560
Between Firefox and Brave, these days, I don't even need Chrome on Android.

09:34.560 --> 09:35.560
Ads on mobile?

09:35.560 --> 09:36.560
You need to get Adaway installed.

09:36.560 --> 09:40.680
You need to get your phone rooted, get Adaway done, get your host file updated regularly.

09:40.680 --> 09:41.760
No more ads, Wes.

09:41.760 --> 09:45.440
We can't all be as cool as you, Joe.

09:45.440 --> 09:46.440
That's true.

09:46.440 --> 09:51.000
Well, another thing Firefox is going to start doing is blocking tracking.

09:51.000 --> 09:52.320
Pretty much wholesale, really.

09:52.320 --> 09:57.000
Yeah, to start with, they've identified three main areas that they'd like to target and

09:57.000 --> 09:59.280
see Firefox radically improve in.

09:59.280 --> 10:04.040
Probably the most important one they're starting with is just improving page load performance.

10:04.040 --> 10:08.720
They cite some figures that 55% of the total time required to load an average website was

10:08.720 --> 10:13.400
spent just loading third-party trackers, which, hey, I don't want that slowdown.

10:13.400 --> 10:15.120
That is pretty bad.

10:15.120 --> 10:18.920
You'd think that in the days of GDPR, that would have been tightened up a little bit,

10:18.920 --> 10:20.800
but apparently not.

10:20.800 --> 10:23.960
Think before you include those JavaScript links, everybody.

10:23.960 --> 10:27.240
Yeah, yeah, the Facebook buttons and all that.

10:27.240 --> 10:28.240
Exactly.

10:28.240 --> 10:30.480
And they also want to cut down on cross-site tracking, don't they?

10:30.480 --> 10:34.600
Yeah, they make a pretty strong analogy here that in the physical world, as you're walking

10:34.600 --> 10:38.960
from store to store and shopping around, you really don't expect people to be following

10:38.960 --> 10:43.240
you and spying just about on everything you look at, let alone purchase.

10:43.240 --> 10:44.240
And you know what?

10:44.240 --> 10:47.820
You should have that same privacy expectation on the web.

10:47.820 --> 10:53.320
So starting with maybe Firefox 65, if all things go well, Firefox will strip cookies

10:53.320 --> 10:57.000
and block storage access from third-party tracking content.

10:57.000 --> 11:00.080
But you can actually enable this right now in Firefox Nightly.

11:00.080 --> 11:05.800
If you go to linuxactionnews.com.69, you'll see a link to the blog post about this detailing

11:05.800 --> 11:06.800
how to do it.

11:06.800 --> 11:08.600
It's fairly straightforward.

11:08.600 --> 11:12.760
And I'm tempted, I'm tempted to get on the Nightly just to get this stuff going already.

11:12.760 --> 11:17.200
Because they also talk about blocking fingerprinting and crypto mining.

11:17.200 --> 11:23.080
It's a bit random to lump them together, but with the fingerprinting, each person's browser

11:23.080 --> 11:29.200
is potentially unique based on all sorts of things like the extensions you've got installed,

11:29.200 --> 11:32.040
the resolution of your screen, even things like theming.

11:32.040 --> 11:36.300
Yeah, there's really an incredible number of ways for clever and motivated people to

11:36.300 --> 11:37.560
track you on the web.

11:37.560 --> 11:41.360
I know the list of fonts you have installed can also be a big giveaway there.

11:41.360 --> 11:45.240
Masala's calling these quote unquote harmful practices.

11:45.240 --> 11:48.200
And you know, I certainly don't want to be tracked without my consent.

11:48.200 --> 11:53.080
And I certainly don't want my browser's time and my CPU and my power bill used to mine

11:53.080 --> 11:56.680
cryptocurrency for someone's third-party website.

11:56.680 --> 12:01.560
What's particularly interesting about this is it seems like a real power play against

12:01.560 --> 12:07.920
Google and Chrome specifically, because Google, they just can't do this with Chrome.

12:07.920 --> 12:11.700
Their business model depends on tracking and selling you ads based on that.

12:11.700 --> 12:15.380
So I just don't see how they could possibly implement this.

12:15.380 --> 12:19.800
And it seems like Mozilla might have the upper hand here.

12:19.800 --> 12:23.340
It really does show where the differing motivations, you know, Google wants to make a nice browser

12:23.340 --> 12:27.200
so that you have a good time on the web using their products and their, you know, and their

12:27.200 --> 12:32.220
cohorts products, Firefox and Mozilla behind them seem to be genuinely interested in an

12:32.220 --> 12:36.640
open internet that allows people to have privacy, but still engage in all the wonderful things

12:36.640 --> 12:37.640
that the internet provides.

12:37.640 --> 12:42.200
I like how they put it that, you know, some sites will still continue to want user data

12:42.200 --> 12:43.840
in exchange for content.

12:43.840 --> 12:48.560
But after these Firefox changes, they'll actually have to ask for it, which is a great change,

12:48.560 --> 12:52.120
especially for people, you know, who may not be listening to this program, even who don't

12:52.120 --> 12:55.200
really know what they're giving away when they visit all these sites.

12:55.200 --> 12:58.360
At least with after these changes, you'll have an idea of just what you're giving away

12:58.360 --> 13:01.600
in exchange for all those top 10 lists.

13:01.600 --> 13:02.600
Yeah.

13:02.600 --> 13:06.440
And I do like to bash Mozilla sometimes and say they've got loads of money and they just

13:06.440 --> 13:08.080
spend it on thriftless things.

13:08.080 --> 13:14.320
But these two stories here really show that they are a good organization, and we are really

13:14.320 --> 13:17.420
lucky to have them and people like the EFF.

13:17.420 --> 13:21.420
So I would urge you if you've stopped using Firefox, give it another go.

13:21.420 --> 13:23.960
It has improved markedly over the last few releases.

13:23.960 --> 13:25.600
It's got faster.

13:25.600 --> 13:28.520
Now we're starting to get stuff like this coming in there.

13:28.520 --> 13:32.220
I think you have to vote with your feet, don't you, or vote with your mouse or whatever.

13:32.220 --> 13:34.320
And start using Firefox again.

13:34.320 --> 13:35.320
It's great.

13:35.320 --> 13:41.280
Well, whatever you may think of Google and their open source, semi open source browser,

13:41.280 --> 13:46.040
there's another Google open source project you probably can't stop hearing about.

13:46.040 --> 13:47.040
That's Kubernetes.

13:47.040 --> 13:52.880
And, well, there's some big news in the, let's say, delicate relationship between the two.

13:52.880 --> 13:58.600
Now a cynical person might say that they have handed off Kubernetes to the community now

13:58.600 --> 14:05.840
and said, here, have a nice $9 million donation of Google Cloud time and, you know, run your

14:05.840 --> 14:06.920
project with that.

14:06.920 --> 14:10.600
But we're not interested in taking care of it anymore.

14:10.600 --> 14:12.480
You know, you're a community.

14:12.480 --> 14:13.480
Run with it.

14:13.480 --> 14:15.040
But am I being too cynical there?

14:15.040 --> 14:17.080
I think it's a reasonable question.

14:17.080 --> 14:22.320
This is a three year grant of $9 million worth of cloud credits for Google Cloud.

14:22.320 --> 14:27.200
So we'll maybe know a little bit more about the true character after three, four, five

14:27.200 --> 14:28.240
years.

14:28.240 --> 14:32.520
But a less cynical way to look at it is that Kubernetes is an open source project.

14:32.520 --> 14:35.200
And so, you know, anyone can go contribute it, especially if you're a company that's

14:35.200 --> 14:37.440
using it and want to feel like you have a stake.

14:37.440 --> 14:42.520
But up until now, Google has been the one deciding when a new release got cut.

14:42.520 --> 14:46.560
And they were the sole people in charge of all of the development infrastructure, the

14:46.560 --> 14:50.600
CI CD systems, the servers that hosted all the container downloads that you need to actually

14:50.600 --> 14:55.760
run the project, as well as just general stewardship of the project.

14:55.760 --> 15:00.000
As they say, they believe that all aspects of a mature open source project, including

15:00.000 --> 15:04.620
its testing release infrastructure should be maintained by the people developing it.

15:04.620 --> 15:09.400
So with this change, under the governance of the cloud native Computing Foundation,

15:09.400 --> 15:14.000
Google is now just one other company that happens to be a sponsor and isn't some weird

15:14.000 --> 15:15.000
mastermind.

15:15.000 --> 15:18.080
So in a way, this is actually better for the project, then probably.

15:18.080 --> 15:22.280
Yeah, I think it signals sort of a new phase, you know, Kubernetes has gone from just sort

15:22.280 --> 15:27.400
of something to watch to a, you know, nascent, but not quite mature project to something

15:27.400 --> 15:33.440
now that runs real production business critical applications in a huge number of large scale

15:33.440 --> 15:34.440
enterprises.

15:34.440 --> 15:38.640
And this move kind of goes along with that there is a consortium of companies and just

15:38.640 --> 15:42.320
open source contributors involved, and now the governance structure will reflect that

15:42.320 --> 15:43.320
a little better.

15:43.320 --> 15:47.060
Well, it sounds like this change isn't going to have immediate effect.

15:47.060 --> 15:50.080
It's going to kind of be a slow transition, isn't it?

15:50.080 --> 15:55.240
So the only thing we can do is watch and wait on this one and see exactly how it shakes

15:55.240 --> 15:56.240
out.

15:56.240 --> 16:00.920
But it sounds from what you've said to be overall, a positive thing, I think a sign

16:00.920 --> 16:03.520
of a maturing project with years to come.

16:03.520 --> 16:08.440
Well, a court case that Google have been involved in, I think it's fair to describe as mature

16:08.440 --> 16:12.640
or having dragged on for far too long at this point.

16:12.640 --> 16:19.160
And that is their dispute with Oracle about Android and the various Java APIs, which may

16:19.160 --> 16:25.360
or may not have been fair use, may or may not have been copyrightable, may or may not

16:25.360 --> 16:29.480
end up costing Google the best part of $9 billion.

16:29.480 --> 16:37.320
Well, Google were very much hoping to be able to appeal the latest decision, which went

16:37.320 --> 16:39.740
against them, but that has not gone well.

16:39.740 --> 16:45.040
So they only have two options left now, either pay the money to Oracle or take it to the

16:45.040 --> 16:47.040
Supreme Court.

16:47.040 --> 16:48.440
Something tells me it's going to be the latter.

16:48.440 --> 16:52.640
I mean, there's only one way to fight Oracle and that's with more lawyers.

16:52.640 --> 16:53.640
Yeah.

16:53.640 --> 16:57.600
When this came up last time, that's what I said, the lawyers, they're the only winners

16:57.600 --> 16:58.600
in this.

16:58.600 --> 17:02.880
They just keep getting paid for this to go backwards and forwards, backwards and forwards.

17:02.880 --> 17:06.720
But it doesn't look good for Google, I don't think.

17:06.720 --> 17:12.160
There are emails basically proving that they knew they should have licensed Java when they

17:12.160 --> 17:13.840
didn't.

17:13.840 --> 17:19.920
And not many people like Oracle, I suppose not many people like Google these days, but

17:19.920 --> 17:22.240
I just don't think it's going to work out for Google.

17:22.240 --> 17:25.040
I think they are going to ultimately have to pay, whether it's going to be the full

17:25.040 --> 17:30.840
$8.8 billion, we'll see, but I think they're going to have to pay something.

17:30.840 --> 17:33.280
But I mean, that's not even that much money to Google, is it?

17:33.280 --> 17:36.760
Okay, it's a little bit to them, but it's not going to ruin them.

17:36.760 --> 17:41.520
No, it's definitely I think, whether or not Google has to pay money, I just sort of worry

17:41.520 --> 17:43.960
about the precedent this sets.

17:43.960 --> 17:49.720
A lot of the technology, especially the internet and Unix based systems have relied on open

17:49.720 --> 17:56.960
interfaces and basically open API's that anyone could implement.

17:56.960 --> 18:01.360
Especially today where Java is still a hugely popular platform, and systems that run on

18:01.360 --> 18:05.800
it are on your mobile phone, on the servers that power the apps on your mobile phone.

18:05.800 --> 18:10.220
It does, I think, have a worrying sense that it could stymie some of the wonderful open

18:10.220 --> 18:13.760
culture that we've been trying and maybe not succeeding to create.

18:13.760 --> 18:17.880
Well, that's a fair point and a fair worry, but I don't think that changes the facts of

18:17.880 --> 18:18.880
this case.

18:18.880 --> 18:24.760
And okay, I'm not a lawyer, and all the rest of it, but I stand by it that I think this

18:24.760 --> 18:26.720
is going to end badly for Google.

18:26.720 --> 18:30.480
And I really hope that you're wrong that it doesn't have a knock on effect, but I fear

18:30.480 --> 18:31.760
that you may be right.

18:31.760 --> 18:35.920
Unfortunately, we just don't have a great legal tradition of understanding the implications

18:35.920 --> 18:38.040
of our decisions around technology.

18:38.040 --> 18:39.040
Yep.

18:39.040 --> 18:43.520
All right, well, let's end on a bit of a fun one.

18:43.520 --> 18:50.560
It turns out that blockchain is way older as a technology than Bitcoin.

18:50.560 --> 18:53.040
In fact, it goes all the way back to 1991.

18:53.040 --> 18:59.400
Now, Joe, I don't know about you, but when I think about blockchain, Bitcoin is what

18:59.400 --> 19:04.400
comes to my mind and really, I guess, just a way to have a database that's maintained

19:04.400 --> 19:10.360
by the network of users and secured through some sort of verifiable cryptography.

19:10.360 --> 19:16.240
But really, blockchains, insofar as they constitute just like a chronological chain of hashed

19:16.240 --> 19:21.280
data, were first invented by cryptographers Stuart Haber and Scott Stornetta way back

19:21.280 --> 19:26.720
in 1991, as you said, and well, their use cases were a lot less ambitious.

19:26.720 --> 19:31.600
Yeah, really, they just wanted to timestamp some digital documents and verify that they

19:31.600 --> 19:33.200
were authentic.

19:33.200 --> 19:37.880
It wasn't about billion dollar ICOs and all of that for them.

19:37.880 --> 19:43.680
It was just they wanted a way to prove that these particular documents were what they

19:43.680 --> 19:48.600
were and when they were in the physical world, we already have a variety of mundane ways

19:48.600 --> 19:49.600
to do that, right?

19:49.600 --> 19:53.600
You can send yourself something in a sealed envelope, or you can make a bunch of chronological

19:53.600 --> 19:58.560
entries in a secure notebook, but verifying authenticity and that no one has actually

19:58.560 --> 20:01.560
mangled a digital document, that's a lot harder.

20:01.560 --> 20:06.600
Yeah, so these guys started a company called surety, I think that's how you say it.

20:06.600 --> 20:09.920
And their main product was a thing called absolute proof.

20:09.920 --> 20:15.760
And really, it was just a cryptographically secure seal on these digital documents.

20:15.760 --> 20:21.840
But they solved this problem of making this ledger public in a really interesting way.

20:21.840 --> 20:27.280
Instead of relying on a whole network of servers eating power crunching a bunch of math to

20:27.280 --> 20:32.720
maintain the security and integrity of the distributed ledger, well, surety was in some

20:32.720 --> 20:36.040
ways just a bit more clever.

20:36.040 --> 20:43.240
Now instead of uploading any sensitive consumer information or posting it publicly, instead,

20:43.240 --> 20:48.440
surety would create a unique hash of all the new seals added to its database every week,

20:48.440 --> 20:51.440
and then they publish that hash value in the New York Times.

20:51.440 --> 20:55.600
Yeah, in the classified section, which must have been super cheap.

20:55.600 --> 20:58.320
And they've been doing that every week since the 90s.

20:58.320 --> 21:03.000
Yeah, if you go look and find it, you'll see right under notices and lost and found some

21:03.000 --> 21:07.520
just strange looking series of digits and numbers, which you'll probably recognize as

21:07.520 --> 21:09.100
a cryptographic hash.

21:09.100 --> 21:14.460
And talk about distributed, even now, they still have a print circulation of over half

21:14.460 --> 21:21.880
a million copies per edition, which means that it would be extremely difficult to tamper

21:21.880 --> 21:22.880
with those.

21:22.880 --> 21:24.440
There's just too many of them.

21:24.440 --> 21:29.520
Yeah, really about the only way to invalidate the claims that they've published would be

21:29.520 --> 21:33.560
to make a fake paper with fake hashes and be able to have a wider distribution.

21:33.560 --> 21:36.400
I don't know about you, Joe, but I just don't have that much paper.

21:36.400 --> 21:38.880
Yeah, not to mention all the ink.

21:38.880 --> 21:41.200
But come on, newspapers are old technology.

21:41.200 --> 21:43.380
Surely you want to keep up with all the new stuff.

21:43.380 --> 21:49.080
And the best way to do that is go to linuxactionnews.com subscribe for all the ways to get new episodes

21:49.080 --> 21:53.440
and linuxactionnews.com contact for ways to get in touch.

21:53.440 --> 21:57.540
And don't forget you can support the whole network at the Patreon page patreon.com slash

21:57.540 --> 21:58.980
Jupiter signal.

21:58.980 --> 22:02.660
We'll be back next Monday with our weekly take on the latest Linux and open source news.

22:02.660 --> 22:04.280
I'm at Westpane.

22:04.280 --> 22:06.240
I'm at Joe Rissington.

22:06.240 --> 22:25.520
Thanks for joining us and we'll see you next week.
