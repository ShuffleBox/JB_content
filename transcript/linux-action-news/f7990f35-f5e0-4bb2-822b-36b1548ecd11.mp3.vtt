Hello and welcome to Linux Action News, our weekly take on Linux and the open source world.

00:16.120 --> 00:20.080
This is episode 34, recorded on December 19th, 2017.

00:20.080 --> 00:21.080
I'm Chris.

00:21.080 --> 00:22.080
And I'm Joe.

00:22.080 --> 00:25.480
Hello Joe, what do you know, it's good to be connected with you once more.

00:25.480 --> 00:29.160
And I've been looking forward to this episode all week because you and I have been polishing

00:29.160 --> 00:30.720
our crystal balls.

00:30.720 --> 00:33.880
We're recording this a little bit ahead of time for the holidays.

00:33.880 --> 00:37.640
And I'm not going to I'm not going to lie, I'm really looking forward to hearing what

00:37.640 --> 00:40.320
you think is going to happen in Linux for the rest of the year.

00:40.320 --> 00:42.800
Okay, well, let me start with a very safe one.

00:42.800 --> 00:46.320
As far as I'm concerned, I want to get at least one thing correct.

00:46.320 --> 00:47.880
You stole this one from me.

00:47.880 --> 00:49.500
Well, yeah, you know.

00:49.500 --> 00:55.840
So my first prediction is that Ubuntu Unity 7 will become an official flavor in 2018.

00:55.840 --> 00:58.160
I don't think 1804.

00:58.160 --> 00:59.160
I think that's too soon.

00:59.160 --> 01:00.680
But I think 1810.

01:00.680 --> 01:01.680
It will be official.

01:01.680 --> 01:02.920
Oh, official.

01:02.920 --> 01:08.000
So I think there will definitely be an 1804 that you can install, because they're already

01:08.000 --> 01:09.440
working on a daily ISO.

01:09.440 --> 01:10.440
I like this.

01:10.440 --> 01:14.280
I like this benchmark, though, of like canonical officially recognizes it as a flavor.

01:14.280 --> 01:16.000
And you're saying that's not till 1810.

01:16.000 --> 01:17.480
Yeah, I like that.

01:17.480 --> 01:18.480
Okay.

01:18.480 --> 01:21.080
So I think that's almost a foregone conclusion.

01:21.080 --> 01:22.480
So there's your safe bet.

01:22.480 --> 01:25.160
You ready for my safe bet for 2018?

01:25.160 --> 01:30.440
And it's not necessarily a positive one, but I think Linux servers and IoT devices that

01:30.440 --> 01:36.760
run Linux are going to see the largest increase in attacks, like the kind of attacks that

01:36.760 --> 01:42.220
you would normally attribute it to IIS boxes and things that distribute worms and malware,

01:42.220 --> 01:44.560
like the Mirai botnet that we saw recently.

01:44.560 --> 01:50.000
And most of it's going to be caused by out of date or bad defaults.

01:50.000 --> 01:53.280
Well, that's pretty obvious, isn't it?

01:53.280 --> 01:54.940
How are you going to quantify this?

01:54.940 --> 01:59.440
The key prediction that I'm going for here is a large increase in the percentage.

01:59.440 --> 02:04.560
So at the end of 2018, the conversation will be the new attack vector, the normal attack

02:04.560 --> 02:06.940
vector is Linux, it won't be even new.

02:06.940 --> 02:10.960
At the end of 2018, what my prediction is, is that it's a foregone conclusion that all

02:10.960 --> 02:16.000
of these little IoT devices running kernel 2.2 and 2.4, and these web servers that are

02:16.000 --> 02:20.640
running agent versions of Apache, we're approaching peak negligence, I think.

02:20.640 --> 02:23.760
And I think 2018 is the year that bill will come due.

02:23.760 --> 02:25.000
Yeah, I can't argue with that.

02:25.000 --> 02:28.240
I think that's a pretty safe bet, along with the Unity 7 one.

02:28.240 --> 02:29.240
All right.

02:29.240 --> 02:30.240
What about you?

02:30.240 --> 02:31.240
You got anything a little more further out there?

02:31.240 --> 02:33.160
Well, a little bit further out there.

02:33.160 --> 02:41.520
Okay, so Microsoft Linux, probably Azure Linux, to be fair, but a Linux distro from Microsoft.

02:41.520 --> 02:48.840
We've had a Linux distro that's kind of network stuff, but I'm talking a full blown, like

02:48.840 --> 02:56.320
Amazon Linux 2 style distro for Azure made by Microsoft with a name like Microsoft Linux

02:56.320 --> 03:04.180
or Azure Linux, and it's going to have tight integration with the Windows 10 desktop and

03:04.180 --> 03:10.500
all the developer options, and you're going to be able to probably have really fast SSH

03:10.500 --> 03:15.320
access to it or something, but it's all about pushing Azure and it's all about taking control

03:15.320 --> 03:18.520
of that with a Microsoft distro.

03:18.520 --> 03:23.360
You could really see Microsoft integrating it further and deeper into Visual Studio Code

03:23.360 --> 03:29.000
and Visual Studio itself, where one click button, you've spun up an Azure Linux instance

03:29.000 --> 03:30.560
and you can keep it or discard it.

03:30.560 --> 03:35.440
You can try your code out on the public infrastructure with one click of a button, and they're getting

03:35.440 --> 03:41.400
really close there now, and their own version of Linux in light of Amazon's continued investment

03:41.400 --> 03:45.000
in their own version of Linux, I think that is a safe bet.

03:45.000 --> 03:50.060
I think you may be in safe bet territory here where I would like to go a little fringy with

03:50.060 --> 03:54.800
this if I could just ride on your coattails a bit is wouldn't it be something if Microsoft

03:54.800 --> 03:59.640
took a stab at building a virtual desktop instance?

03:59.640 --> 04:04.360
Never going to happen, but this is going to throughout 2018 become an area of hosted Linux

04:04.360 --> 04:08.540
we don't talk a lot about now, but behind the scenes, I've heard from several listeners

04:08.540 --> 04:14.460
that their entire freaking company is running on virtual instances on Amazon's infrastructure.

04:14.460 --> 04:17.120
They don't even have a singular desktop PC in their office.

04:17.120 --> 04:20.560
What are you talking sort of HTML5 console type stuff?

04:20.560 --> 04:24.900
I'm talking thin client hooked up to a monitoring keyboard that uses some sort of remote desktop

04:24.900 --> 04:29.000
protocol to remote into an Azure instance.

04:29.000 --> 04:32.340
There's obviously they would do that with Windows, but wouldn't it be fascinating if

04:32.340 --> 04:35.760
eventually they create like a developer workstation distribution?

04:35.760 --> 04:39.880
It's way out there pie in the sky stuff, but I wouldn't be too surprised if you don't see

04:39.880 --> 04:44.840
something like that arrive on Amazon's infrastructure or a similar infrastructure soon.

04:44.840 --> 04:50.320
So you think that maybe eventually, probably not in 2018, but eventually Microsoft may

04:50.320 --> 04:55.620
build on this idea of a Microsoft Linux and then possibly put the Windows shell on top

04:55.620 --> 04:56.620
of that?

04:56.620 --> 05:01.280
No, no, but I do think what will happen is in 2018 is other businesses will ship a hosted

05:01.280 --> 05:06.360
Linux desktop and Microsoft will watch that and then respond competitively.

05:06.360 --> 05:11.040
Yeah, I suppose that sounds reasonable, but I still think it would be a very Windows 10

05:11.040 --> 05:12.360
like shell on top of it.

05:12.360 --> 05:15.600
Yeah, it was probably some sort of horrible Cortana integration.

05:15.600 --> 05:19.160
Yeah, yeah, they're not going to ship some GTK thing.

05:19.160 --> 05:20.760
No, no, I don't think so.

05:20.760 --> 05:21.760
All right.

05:21.760 --> 05:26.280
Well, here's my kind of other prediction that's a little bit further out there, but it seems

05:26.280 --> 05:32.520
to be if you ask me that the general way that things are trending and it's this gap that

05:32.520 --> 05:37.600
we're seeing slowly develop in 2017 that I think is going to blow wide open in 2018 between

05:37.600 --> 05:42.540
the idealist Linux user and the pragmatist Linux user.

05:42.540 --> 05:46.160
And so let's define some of these terms a little bit.

05:46.160 --> 05:52.600
An idealist is somebody who's using Linux for moral reasons, ideological reasons, you

05:52.600 --> 05:55.600
know, the license, things like that nature.

05:55.600 --> 06:00.800
Whereas the pragmatist is somebody who is buying a pre-built Linux system to do web

06:00.800 --> 06:04.720
development work or to work on their network or whatever that use case might be.

06:04.720 --> 06:09.080
It's somebody who's buying a Linux system or building a Linux system to do work.

06:09.080 --> 06:12.720
So you're talking about the difference between someone who buys a Purism laptop with the

06:12.720 --> 06:18.160
idea of running core boot and completely free software versus someone who just buys something

06:18.160 --> 06:23.480
with a really fancy Nvidia card and loads steam on it as soon as they get it.

06:23.480 --> 06:28.720
Yeah, your ThinkPad purchasers out there, your Sputnik purchasers out there, your HP

06:28.720 --> 06:30.760
Spectre purchases out there.

06:30.760 --> 06:36.060
People that want a really functional work computer that are also a little more comfortable

06:36.060 --> 06:37.440
with using Slack.

06:37.440 --> 06:40.400
They're okay with using Telegram.

06:40.400 --> 06:44.840
These applications that aren't even necessarily 100% native on Linux, maybe they're electron

06:44.840 --> 06:48.600
based, they're okay with it because it lets them get their job done at work.

06:48.600 --> 06:51.120
You know, your system to users out there.

06:51.120 --> 06:55.660
This gap between your idealist and your pragmatist is I think going to be clearly defined as

06:55.660 --> 06:59.640
more and more people are buying these pre-built systems and more and more people are coming

06:59.640 --> 07:02.680
over to Linux to do their day to day work.

07:02.680 --> 07:05.680
I think you're going to have a wider and wider gap between the people that are using Linux

07:05.680 --> 07:10.240
to get their job done and maybe have a couple of proprietary blobs on there and people who

07:10.240 --> 07:15.740
are using Linux because they see it as a way to preserve the intellectual property of humanity.

07:15.740 --> 07:17.240
But don't you have that gap already?

07:17.240 --> 07:19.280
I don't see how this is a prediction really.

07:19.280 --> 07:22.400
We've got this situation already.

07:22.400 --> 07:29.080
The prediction comes in where this pragmatist portion of the Linux based begins to really

07:29.080 --> 07:33.400
explode in growth where all the proper channels are there.

07:33.400 --> 07:39.200
You have System76 with their hardware lineup and their pop OS system designed at a certain

07:39.200 --> 07:40.480
segment of users.

07:40.480 --> 07:44.240
You've got Entraware that's delivering to another segment of users and you've got Dell

07:44.240 --> 07:49.000
that's delivering to another clear segment of users and all of these channels are established

07:49.000 --> 07:50.000
now.

07:50.000 --> 07:52.100
Canonical is moving Ubuntu over to the GNOME desktop.

07:52.100 --> 07:55.960
We're consolidating around these particular ideas and standards.

07:55.960 --> 07:59.880
It's becoming the workhorse desktop operating system that a lot of us have wanted for a

07:59.880 --> 08:00.880
long time.

08:00.880 --> 08:02.280
The groundwork is done now.

08:02.280 --> 08:08.020
2017 was the year we did all of that work, but 2018 is going to be the year that we reap

08:08.020 --> 08:12.080
the benefits of all of that investment where we have a bunch of more people that are switching

08:12.080 --> 08:13.080
over.

08:13.080 --> 08:14.080
They tried the Windows 10 setup.

08:14.080 --> 08:15.240
They're sick and tired of the Mac.

08:15.240 --> 08:18.640
I'm not saying it's going to be tens and tens of millions of people, but it is going to

08:18.640 --> 08:25.120
be the largest new infusion of Linux users the Linux desktop has ever seen in 2018 and

08:25.120 --> 08:29.680
that's going to cause all of these flare-ups to become way more weaponized because the

08:29.680 --> 08:34.220
people on the idealist side are going to feel the walls closing in on them.

08:34.220 --> 08:37.840
Their situation is getting tighter and tighter and their struggle will become more and more

08:37.840 --> 08:40.320
palatable to save the ideal Linux.

08:40.320 --> 08:44.000
Well, I can't really argue with any of that, but if you read between the lines of what

08:44.000 --> 08:48.600
you've just said there and kind of filter it down, what you've said is 2018 is going

08:48.600 --> 08:50.280
to be the year of Linux on the desktop.

08:50.280 --> 08:52.320
I actually think it's more pessimistic than that.

08:52.320 --> 08:57.440
I think 2018 is going to be the biggest years of wars we have ever seen in the Linux community,

08:57.440 --> 09:02.160
the largest division and decisiveness we've seen because you're going to have people that

09:02.160 --> 09:06.160
really believe in a cause and they feel like it's starting to slip.

09:06.160 --> 09:10.260
And you're going to have people that don't give a crap about their concerns and just

09:10.260 --> 09:12.000
want to get their damn job done.

09:12.000 --> 09:15.440
And this butting of heads is going to be the biggest we've ever seen.

09:15.440 --> 09:19.760
And I think people that aren't really in tune of what's going on in the larger picture here

09:19.760 --> 09:23.320
are going to report on this in a way that makes it sound like the Linux community is

09:23.320 --> 09:24.880
ripping itself apart.

09:24.880 --> 09:27.040
That I think will be a narrative that emerges throughout 2018.

09:27.040 --> 09:30.540
Well, I hope you're wrong and I hope that what I said about it being the year of Linux

09:30.540 --> 09:31.680
on the desktop.

09:31.680 --> 09:33.080
That is the positive angle of it.

09:33.080 --> 09:37.480
What you've touched on is this is the reaction to that action.

09:37.480 --> 09:38.480
I see what you're saying.

09:38.480 --> 09:43.240
So it is going to be a massive year for Linux on the desktop, but you're going to have this

09:43.240 --> 09:47.440
pushback from the real free software people.

09:47.440 --> 09:50.640
It basically comes back to the old argument, doesn't it, between free software and open

09:50.640 --> 09:51.640
source.

09:51.640 --> 09:55.120
If I was going to boil this prediction down to a singular sentence, if I could, maybe

09:55.120 --> 09:57.120
a paragraph, it's this.

09:57.120 --> 10:02.760
2017 was a year of big transition for Linux from idealist to pragmatist operating system.

10:02.760 --> 10:08.040
2018 is the year that the community deals with the new reality that scales have tipped.

10:08.040 --> 10:11.880
It's now a pragmatist workstation OS and less of an idealist OS.

10:11.880 --> 10:13.920
Yeah, again, I think that you're right.

10:13.920 --> 10:18.040
And I think that you're right that there's going to be a lot of people left behind by

10:18.040 --> 10:24.180
that shift to pragmatism because a lot of people are real idealists, but as new blood

10:24.180 --> 10:29.600
comes into the Linux community, they're going to care less and less about the idealism,

10:29.600 --> 10:34.280
the free software stuff, the FSF approach to it all, and just want to get their work

10:34.280 --> 10:36.880
done and you are going to get the blowback from that.

10:36.880 --> 10:39.760
So yeah, I think that's a reasonable prediction.

10:39.760 --> 10:43.120
But we could not do a predictions episode without talking about Bitcoin.

10:43.120 --> 10:45.720
Let's not talk too much about it.

10:45.720 --> 10:47.840
Let's just put some numbers on this.

10:47.840 --> 10:54.320
So what I want from you and what I'm going to give you is the 2018 high in terms of price,

10:54.320 --> 11:02.380
dollar value, 2018 low, and then the price on the first of December 2018.

11:02.380 --> 11:04.260
So let's start with the high.

11:04.260 --> 11:06.840
How high do you think it's going to go this coming year?

11:06.840 --> 11:16.000
Well, in 2017, we nearly got so far to $20,000 for one Bitcoin, 20,000 green US backs.

11:16.000 --> 11:20.240
Here's the problem with predicting Bitcoin is it's hard to model this because depending

11:20.240 --> 11:26.200
on who you believe, up to 40% of the Bitcoins in existence are held by a very small minority

11:26.200 --> 11:27.720
of the Bitcoin market.

11:27.720 --> 11:35.000
And these whales are very capable of manipulating the entire market up or down depending on

11:35.000 --> 11:36.000
their whims.

11:36.000 --> 11:39.800
So this is not a very easy thing to predict.

11:39.800 --> 11:46.160
But there is a thought process I've been using recently with Bitcoin.

11:46.160 --> 11:51.800
Most bad news ends up raising the price, even if it causes a temporary decrease in price.

11:51.800 --> 12:00.080
And if these crazy internet people thought that Bitcoin is worth $10, $25, $100, $1,000,

12:00.080 --> 12:04.640
$10,000, and currently they think it's worth $17,000.

12:04.640 --> 12:07.660
If it's worth $17,000, it might be worth $20,000.

12:07.660 --> 12:09.840
And if it's worth $20,000, it might be worth $30,000.

12:09.840 --> 12:14.960
So I'm going to say that the high for 2018 is $100,000.

12:14.960 --> 12:18.660
Oh, that's close to what I was going to say.

12:18.660 --> 12:22.560
So I'm going to say the high for more or less the same reasons as you.

12:22.560 --> 12:29.140
I think the high is going to reach $120,000 in 2018.

12:29.140 --> 12:33.300
So we'll get back to the price on the 1st of December, which is, I suppose, the kind

12:33.300 --> 12:39.360
of we have to pick an arbitrary date because it's so volatile that I just picked December

12:39.360 --> 12:40.360
1st.

12:40.360 --> 12:41.480
So the low.

12:41.480 --> 12:44.200
So at the moment, you said $17,000.

12:44.200 --> 12:46.960
I was looking today, it was kind of $18,000-ish.

12:46.960 --> 12:49.080
I've seen it up very nearly to $20,000.

12:49.080 --> 12:51.480
It didn't quite crack it.

12:51.480 --> 12:55.260
So what do you think the low price is going to be in 2018?

12:55.260 --> 13:01.500
We could not have picked a worse time in Bitcoin's entire history to make this prediction because

13:01.500 --> 13:06.920
this week and the week prior and the week prior to that, different huge Wall Street

13:06.920 --> 13:12.240
institutions are coming online and selling Bitcoin futures and creating markets around

13:12.240 --> 13:19.560
Bitcoin, which may lead to a price floor that is higher than you and I think because you

13:19.560 --> 13:23.640
have these huge markets that are building around Bitcoin right now and these people

13:23.640 --> 13:27.900
that own the majority of Bitcoin are not going to screw this opportunity up.

13:27.900 --> 13:28.900
They will hold.

13:28.900 --> 13:34.920
So I'm going to make the bold prediction that the floor for Bitcoin in 2018, it will never

13:34.920 --> 13:37.300
go below $10,000 a coin.

13:37.300 --> 13:38.300
I think higher than that.

13:38.300 --> 13:41.400
I don't think it's going to drop below $15,000 in 2018.

13:41.400 --> 13:42.400
Wow.

13:42.400 --> 13:45.860
The only problem here with this prediction, of course, is that some technical flaw could

13:45.860 --> 13:51.240
be discovered or some major quantum computing revolution could come all of a sudden, doubtful,

13:51.240 --> 13:53.640
but it could change the way we compute crypto.

13:53.640 --> 14:00.200
So it's hard, but I feel the fundamentals of a blockchain, a distributed trust system

14:00.200 --> 14:05.720
and a peer-to-peer currency are established and those core ideas are going away.

14:05.720 --> 14:10.360
And the most market successful cryptocurrency that represents those ideas is Bitcoin.

14:10.360 --> 14:11.520
Just you wait.

14:11.520 --> 14:16.560
This time next year, it's going to be worth $100 and we're going to look so bad.

14:16.560 --> 14:17.560
All right.

14:17.560 --> 14:22.900
So the price towards the end of the year, then December 1st, 2018, I know that's difficult

14:22.900 --> 14:27.080
because it depends on what time, but roughly what kind of price do you think it would be

14:27.080 --> 14:28.080
looking at then?

14:28.080 --> 14:29.080
Hmm.

14:29.080 --> 14:30.320
Well, I think it's going to be the higher end of the spectrum.

14:30.320 --> 14:36.320
I think it's going to be somewhere near the $100,000 range if things are successful.

14:36.320 --> 14:42.400
It feels like with Bitcoin, it's either going to go all the way or it's going to become

14:42.400 --> 14:43.680
worth nothing.

14:43.680 --> 14:49.720
As more and more people discover Bitcoin, the scarcity problem just goes up.

14:49.720 --> 14:53.640
And when the scarcity problem goes up, the value goes up.

14:53.640 --> 14:59.880
So it's this sort of bubble effect where as the mainstream world, CNBC here in the States

14:59.880 --> 15:01.840
is talking about it on a daily basis now.

15:01.840 --> 15:06.040
Like I just mentioned, the Wall Street businesses that are doing day trading in Bitcoin, as

15:06.040 --> 15:10.320
mainstream adoption and knowledge comes up and people start realizing you don't have

15:10.320 --> 15:16.080
to buy a Bitcoin, you could buy $10 of Bitcoin, you can do fractional investing.

15:16.080 --> 15:22.200
And when that really takes off in the mainstream, oh boy, Joe, I just, I feel like what we're

15:22.200 --> 15:26.220
seeing today has been child's play.

15:26.220 --> 15:27.640
It's really just about to get interesting.

15:27.640 --> 15:32.280
So this is the worst time ever, but I'm going to say if it's successful, it's going to be

15:32.280 --> 15:35.400
over $100,000 this time in December.

15:35.400 --> 15:39.640
If something is discovered and it's bankrupt, of course, it's going to just bottom out.

15:39.640 --> 15:41.160
It's going to be one or the other, I think.

15:41.160 --> 15:45.680
Well, I want a number, 1st of December 2018, what's the price?

15:45.680 --> 15:46.680
$107,000.

15:46.680 --> 15:47.680
Okay.

15:47.680 --> 15:48.680
I'm going to go for $100,000.

15:48.680 --> 15:51.480
Are we going price is right rules?

15:51.480 --> 15:52.480
Not a penny over.

15:52.480 --> 15:53.480
Yeah, I think we should.

15:53.480 --> 15:54.480
I think we should.

15:54.480 --> 15:55.480
I think we should.

15:55.480 --> 15:56.520
Not a penny over, whoever gets closer.

15:56.520 --> 16:01.200
And to be fair, I'm not really like, I'm not going to like, I'm not going to say I picked

16:01.200 --> 16:02.800
this number after tons of research.

16:02.800 --> 16:07.480
It's sort of an arbitrary number I chose, but could you imagine, could you imagine the

16:07.480 --> 16:12.920
level of conversation, how much Bitcoin is going to dominate the news if that is the

16:12.920 --> 16:13.920
case?

16:13.920 --> 16:16.880
That's one of the primary things people talk about and you and I are going to have to go

16:16.880 --> 16:19.800
out of our way to avoid dominating the show with Bitcoin.

16:19.800 --> 16:23.920
Because think about it, if it gets to $100,000, dude, it's going to be the only thing people

16:23.920 --> 16:24.920
talk about.

16:24.920 --> 16:25.920
Yeah, but don't worry.

16:25.920 --> 16:33.160
It'll be worth $100 and we'll just be talking about Fedora and Ubuntu.

16:33.160 --> 16:35.520

And there's stuff you've never really even considered taking courseware on and then you

17:00.240 --> 17:02.680
sit down and you go through the process.

17:02.680 --> 17:06.660
And even if you're an old salt, you go, wow, how did I not know that?

17:06.660 --> 17:08.880
How did I not know you could do that little thing?

17:08.880 --> 17:11.800
So there's tiny little bits of value in there all the time.

17:11.800 --> 17:15.960
But the big stuff comes from the hands-on labs or the learning pass if you want to get

17:15.960 --> 17:17.340
somewhere in your career.

17:17.340 --> 17:20.720
Or taking practice exams and getting ready for certification tests.

17:20.720 --> 17:25.140
And the flashcards, which are study guides that are forked by the Linux Academy community

17:25.140 --> 17:27.220
like an open source project.

17:27.220 --> 17:31.900

And thank you to all of you out there for visiting linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

17:53.240 --> 17:58.560
Okay, so we've talked about what we think is going to happen.

17:58.560 --> 18:02.340
Now let's talk about things that we want to happen.

18:02.340 --> 18:07.920
And I'll start with, I want to see a major cryptocurrency that uses far less energy than

18:07.920 --> 18:08.920
Bitcoin.

18:08.920 --> 18:13.040
Now I know that you've been very skeptical about these claims of it using as much power

18:13.040 --> 18:18.160
as nations and it's going to be using more power in a few years than the whole world

18:18.160 --> 18:19.160
combined.

18:19.160 --> 18:23.000
But you cannot deny that it uses a lot of energy.

18:23.000 --> 18:29.620
And I would love to see a cryptocurrency come along that uses way less energy.

18:29.620 --> 18:34.080
Maybe it's a proof of space, maybe it's something that no one's even thought of yet, that comes

18:34.080 --> 18:37.280
along and is mainstream.

18:37.280 --> 18:40.680
I talked about last week how Bitcoin is the name, you know, it's the Coca Cola, I think

18:40.680 --> 18:43.000
it's going to maintain that position.

18:43.000 --> 18:46.420
But you've got to have a lot of other cryptocurrencies come along.

18:46.420 --> 18:52.440
And it'd be good to see one that was maybe as popular as Ethereum, but uses a fraction

18:52.440 --> 18:56.320
of the energy of any of the coins that we know about now.

18:56.320 --> 19:00.120
I do think the problem is a bit overblown, to be honest, because there's so many options.

19:00.120 --> 19:02.760
You don't have to mine cryptocurrency in one place.

19:02.760 --> 19:05.120
You could move it to where energy options are cheaper.

19:05.120 --> 19:08.600
Where when you're mining coal and oil, you have to go to where the natural resources

19:08.600 --> 19:09.600
are.

19:09.600 --> 19:10.600
So I think it's a bit of an overblown problem.

19:10.600 --> 19:14.040
But that said, the solution is already here in several altcoins.

19:14.040 --> 19:18.980
Like you mentioned, proof of storage concepts that have a way less compute overhead.

19:18.980 --> 19:23.560
As long as the Bitcoin network has to be verified and you have to solve these large math problems,

19:23.560 --> 19:24.880
you're going to need a lot of compute.

19:24.880 --> 19:28.600
But that's all ephemeral, it can be moved around.

19:28.600 --> 19:32.820
I wouldn't worry just yet about that problem, Bitcoin energy use, because I feel like the

19:32.820 --> 19:35.760
technology is out there to solve it.

19:35.760 --> 19:40.760
And I wouldn't be too surprised, Joe, if one of these altcoins does manage to sort of build

19:40.760 --> 19:46.760
its brand around the eco-friendly currency, the currency that doesn't kill the earth.

19:46.760 --> 19:51.200
And you may end up seeing this sort of wish play out simply because of market dynamics.

19:51.200 --> 19:53.000
Well, hopefully that's what I want to see.

19:53.000 --> 19:56.840
I want to see less energy use generally, because that's got to be a good thing.

19:56.840 --> 19:59.600
But OK, what's your first thing that you want to happen?

19:59.600 --> 20:02.080
It's all about the electron, I think.

20:02.080 --> 20:05.720
And it's not because I want to see electron just take over the Linux desktop.

20:05.720 --> 20:11.480
It's just the realist in me, having just reached this understanding after about a year of fighting

20:11.480 --> 20:17.720
it, understands that it's going to be electron that brings major applications to Linux desktop.

20:17.720 --> 20:23.440
So I would like to see an Adobe or a Microsoft launch one of those big missing Linux desktop

20:23.440 --> 20:24.440
apps.

20:24.440 --> 20:28.300
I asked on Twitter a couple of days ago, what is missing on the Linux desktop?

20:28.300 --> 20:33.840
And so many of the answers were some of the Adobe CS applications or this AutoCAD application.

20:33.840 --> 20:37.520
Yeah, the huge proprietary things, Avid, Pro Tools, that sort of thing.

20:37.520 --> 20:43.240
I wonder if electron is up to the task for those really in-depth applications like Avid

20:43.240 --> 20:45.840
that needs hardware acceleration and stuff.

20:45.840 --> 20:48.600
I suppose that's a technical challenge that can be overcome.

20:48.600 --> 20:51.800
And I personally have no problem with electron.

20:51.800 --> 20:56.040
If the application works, I don't care whether it's properly native or electron.

20:56.040 --> 20:57.760
All I care is, does it run?

20:57.760 --> 20:58.960
Does it crash?

20:58.960 --> 21:00.720
Is it going to do the job I need it to do?

21:00.720 --> 21:01.920
I've been wondering that, too.

21:01.920 --> 21:08.320
If Adobe released Adobe Premiere for Linux, and they wrote it in electron, and let's just

21:08.320 --> 21:10.840
say for a moment it just worked great.

21:10.840 --> 21:14.480
It used a ton of RAM and stuff, but it just worked great.

21:14.480 --> 21:16.240
That would fundamentally change my life.

21:16.240 --> 21:20.040
I would immediately stop using Final Cut for anything I've ever done, and I would switch

21:20.040 --> 21:22.120
completely over to that on the Linux desktop.

21:22.120 --> 21:24.680
It would change my life.

21:24.680 --> 21:26.240
So that's why I put this on the list.

21:26.240 --> 21:32.080
And I do wonder if it's maybe too soon, because there's things out there like WebAssembly that

21:32.080 --> 21:38.200
could bring real native performance to web applications and electron applications that

21:38.200 --> 21:39.920
we may just have to wait around for.

21:39.920 --> 21:41.000
But I feel it in my bones.

21:41.000 --> 21:47.240
I feel like Microsoft or Adobe or somebody is about to drop a major application on Linux,

21:47.240 --> 21:48.240
and I'm betting it's electron.

21:48.240 --> 21:49.240
You're a dreamer, Chris.

21:49.240 --> 21:50.240
That's all I can say.

21:50.240 --> 21:54.680
I can't see it happening, but thankfully this isn't predictions.

21:54.680 --> 21:56.640
I wouldn't mind that happening.

21:56.640 --> 22:03.480
I'm more of a free software idealist rather than pragmatist, but then I do have a pragmatic

22:03.480 --> 22:04.480
streak as well.

22:04.480 --> 22:09.960
I'm a bit of a fence sitter on this one, and I think that overall it probably would be

22:09.960 --> 22:14.240
good for Linux and open source and free software if we had these huge proprietary applications

22:14.240 --> 22:15.800
available on our platform.

22:15.800 --> 22:19.680
I'm not saying I would necessarily be interested in using them, but I think it would draw more

22:19.680 --> 22:22.800
people over to us, and that has got to be a good thing.

22:22.800 --> 22:23.800
That's how I see it.

22:23.800 --> 22:26.720
It gives more options available to people that want to move over to the desktop.

22:26.720 --> 22:32.200
It moves more workflows over to Linux, which is a tide that does rise all boats.

22:32.200 --> 22:35.440
But maybe there's hope for the core architecture, hey, Joe?

22:35.440 --> 22:40.920
I want to see consumer RISC-V boards available.

22:40.920 --> 22:42.720
I'm not expecting laptops.

22:42.720 --> 22:49.440
I'm not expecting complicated high-power machines, but something that reminds you of a Raspberry

22:49.440 --> 22:57.840
Pi that is consumer price point around $35, maybe $50, that's based on the RISC-V architecture

22:57.840 --> 23:03.960
that's totally free and open, and then obviously you need the software to run on that.

23:03.960 --> 23:12.600
Again, I'm not expecting Plasma 5 to run on it, but some command line stuff, maybe Apache,

23:12.600 --> 23:16.680
NGINX, and other command line applications.

23:16.680 --> 23:21.360
But it would be good if we could have this in the hands of hackers, because at the moment

23:21.360 --> 23:26.600
there are some RISC-V boards available for manufacturers, but they're very expensive.

23:26.600 --> 23:32.520
I would like to see in 2018 that price come down to a point where makers, tinkerers, hackers

23:32.520 --> 23:38.000
can get hold of these boards and push this architecture forward and get towards a point

23:38.000 --> 23:43.320
where we can have a nice high-powered laptop that's running a RISC-V processor.

23:43.320 --> 23:46.920
That's way in the future, but we need another step, and this is the step that I want to

23:46.920 --> 23:47.920
see in 2018.

23:47.920 --> 23:53.120
Ah, so it's like baby steps, because really where you're going is eventually an x86 platform

23:53.120 --> 23:55.600
killer or replacement for you.

23:55.600 --> 24:00.140
That's the dream, but that is so far off at this point that I think that we just have

24:00.140 --> 24:04.800
to be realistic, and something to compete with the Raspberry Pi is a realistic goal.

24:04.800 --> 24:05.800
Yeah, I like that.

24:05.800 --> 24:06.880
I don't think I have much more to add to it.

24:06.880 --> 24:09.200
I think that's exactly what I'd like to see.

24:09.200 --> 24:13.840
I'll go on the software side here for a moment then if I can, and talk about Pipewire.

24:13.840 --> 24:18.860
I've followed this pretty closely in Linux Unplugged throughout 2017, and now if I could

24:18.860 --> 24:24.860
just wave a magic wand, in 2018 I would love to see Pipewire quickly continue to improve

24:24.860 --> 24:31.480
and become a competent video and audio pipeline on Linux, perhaps even begin to replace Pulse

24:31.480 --> 24:32.480
Audio.

24:32.480 --> 24:37.480
And, on top of that, we're seeing the very early works in GNOME right now, but I'd like

24:37.480 --> 24:44.000
to see a few desktop environments leverage Pipewire for remote desktop access on Wayland,

24:44.000 --> 24:51.000
because we don't have a TeamViewer or VNC style solution for remote access on Wayland,

24:51.000 --> 24:56.600
and Pipewire may offer the most universal approach across distros and across desktop

24:56.600 --> 25:01.180
environments if everybody just has a big kumbaya circle and goes all in, so I have big hopes

25:01.180 --> 25:02.840
for Pipewire in 2018.

25:02.840 --> 25:04.520
Let me read between the lines again.

25:04.520 --> 25:09.420
What you're saying is you want to be able to sit in Lady Joops and remote into the machines

25:09.420 --> 25:14.400
in the studio and work anywhere in the U.S.?

25:14.400 --> 25:15.960
I suppose there may be an element of that.

25:15.960 --> 25:19.440
I also would like to be able to just launch Skype, the new version of Skype, and not have

25:19.440 --> 25:21.760
to completely destroy my audio subsystem.

25:21.760 --> 25:23.640
Yeah, that would be nice, wouldn't it?

25:23.640 --> 25:28.920
But I think that no matter what we do, Microsoft are just going to find a way to break audio

25:28.920 --> 25:29.920
on Linux with Skype.

25:29.920 --> 25:34.480
Hey, you know, as long as we get somewhere, either it's the audio-video pipeline or the

25:34.480 --> 25:37.880
remote desktop on Wayland, I'm going to consider it a success.

25:37.880 --> 25:38.880
Yeah, okay.

25:38.880 --> 25:46.160
Well, something that's been a huge topic at the end of 2017 is the Intel Management Engine.

25:46.160 --> 25:52.300
And so what I would love to see is an x86 chipset from either Intel or AMD with less

25:52.300 --> 25:59.720
of a proprietary layer, or dare we dream, no proprietary layer, or at least a kill switch.

25:59.720 --> 26:05.220
That is what I would love to see, so that we can have a completely free software laptop

26:05.220 --> 26:11.020
that's running an x86 processor, that we can get some serious performance because the likes

26:11.020 --> 26:17.040
of RISC-V, it's a very long way off getting serious performance from it.

26:17.040 --> 26:19.840
But I just hate that there's this proprietary thing.

26:19.840 --> 26:24.920
I'm staring at a laptop now that's running code that I have no idea, and no one who I

26:24.920 --> 26:29.600
know and respect has access to that code and can tell me whether it's running anything

26:29.600 --> 26:30.600
nefarious.

26:30.600 --> 26:34.400
I just have to trust Intel, and I don't want to do that.

26:34.400 --> 26:41.000
If you had to bet a singular Bitcoin on either Intel or AMD doing this, I mean, come on,

26:41.000 --> 26:42.000
you'd bet it's AMD.

26:42.000 --> 26:43.000
Yeah.

26:43.000 --> 26:46.920
Because AMD has the PSP, but they're not as well entrenched into it as Intel is with the

26:46.920 --> 26:47.920
Management Engine.

26:47.920 --> 26:50.280
Wouldn't you bet that Bitcoin on AMD going PSP-free?

26:50.280 --> 26:51.280
Yeah.

26:51.280 --> 26:54.560
And I think that AMD are more of an agile company.

26:54.560 --> 26:58.160
I think there's less of an inertia there.

26:58.160 --> 27:03.300
I think for them to pivot to something like this is more likely from AMD.

27:03.300 --> 27:08.200
I don't know why, that's just a feeling that I have that they're just willing to take more

27:08.200 --> 27:12.680
risks maybe because they've got less to lose because they're the underdog.

27:12.680 --> 27:14.120
That's how I feel too.

27:14.120 --> 27:20.480
And there is a real possibility that 2018 could be a kick-ass year for AMD and Linux

27:20.480 --> 27:25.060
because you have that Intel NUC that Wimpy and I have been waxing on about that's going

27:25.060 --> 27:29.720
to have an Intel CPU with an AMD dedicated GPU all integrated in.

27:29.720 --> 27:34.640
AMD has been talking for years about properly open sourcing their GPU driver with lots of

27:34.640 --> 27:35.720
work being done on that.

27:35.720 --> 27:40.680
So you have this new NUC, you have this new open source driver initiative of theirs combined

27:40.680 --> 27:44.960
with the possibility that they would be the most likely company to drop the Management

27:44.960 --> 27:47.260
Engine or in their case the PSP.

27:47.260 --> 27:50.520
This could be a real recipe for a nice Linux workstation.

27:50.520 --> 27:54.520
I agree but I think that they have to put it in a laptop to make it really commercially

27:54.520 --> 28:00.040
viable which wouldn't be that hard because those NUC type devices are basically mobile

28:00.040 --> 28:06.080
devices anyway and with some cooling modifications and stuff I think you could put that into

28:06.080 --> 28:10.960
a laptop and if they did that I think that that would sell incredibly well among the

28:10.960 --> 28:15.360
Linux community with developers and users alike who just want a decent machine.

28:15.360 --> 28:16.480
Yeah, I completely agree.

28:16.480 --> 28:18.680
So my last thing is on the software side.

28:18.680 --> 28:22.600
So if the hardware folks can kind of get their stuff figured out I would really love to wave

28:22.600 --> 28:28.120
my wand and have this be a year of spit and polish on the Linux desktop.

28:28.120 --> 28:32.600
I guess I would just love to see the different distributions compete on their fit and finish

28:32.600 --> 28:36.540
on the polish of their desktop environment and it feels like we're closer there than

28:36.540 --> 28:45.080
ever because with AppImage and Snaps and Flatpaks you can have that stable solid desktop

28:45.080 --> 28:52.160
that you just polish away at iteratively while you can deliver fresh user applications through

28:52.160 --> 28:53.160
these different methods.

28:53.160 --> 28:55.880
Well I think we've seen this in 2017, haven't we?

28:55.880 --> 28:59.760
I know there's been a lot of disruption with Ubuntu but if you look at something like Fedora

28:59.760 --> 29:06.480
the releases they've had this year have been iterative and polish and there's been no amazing

29:06.480 --> 29:13.120
changes but it's just been very slow and steady improvements and so I think that what you're

29:13.120 --> 29:15.360
hoping for is kind of already happening.

29:15.360 --> 29:16.400
It's not quite there.

29:16.400 --> 29:18.120
It's like the baby version of it.

29:18.120 --> 29:25.160
We're so so so close but it's not where and please forgive me for saying this but I just

29:25.160 --> 29:30.240
recently upgraded my Final Cut OS computer and you know I have all this stupid Mac crap

29:30.240 --> 29:32.260
installed on this Final Cut OS.

29:32.260 --> 29:37.240
It's all custom configured because it's all got to be tied together and stuff and I thought

29:37.240 --> 29:40.200
all right I'll do this new Hi Sierra.

29:40.200 --> 29:41.200
Hello Sierra.

29:41.200 --> 29:44.040
I'm going to install Hello Sierra and I hit the upgrade button and I thought this is going

29:44.040 --> 29:49.720
to go horrible and when it rebooted after it was all said and done I had no idea.

29:49.720 --> 29:50.720
I couldn't tell.

29:50.720 --> 29:54.880
I wasn't sure if it was successful or not because nothing changed.

29:54.880 --> 29:58.960
And then I went to the about Final Cut OS and I saw that I had the new version of Final

29:58.960 --> 30:01.480
Cut OS and I thought okay good it was successful.

30:01.480 --> 30:06.320
That's great but nothing else changed like when I reopened my applications they opened

30:06.320 --> 30:11.220
up in the same spot on my window where I had closed them before I did my OS upgrade.

30:11.220 --> 30:12.220
We're not there.

30:12.220 --> 30:16.040
I don't know if we're going to get there in 2018 but what I would love to see is the ability

30:16.040 --> 30:18.400
to do a complete distribution upgrade.

30:18.400 --> 30:25.600
They go from Fedora 25 to 26 or go from 1710 to 1804 with applications like Chrome and

30:25.600 --> 30:32.360
Spotify and Telegram that are installed via flat packs and snaps and nothing changes with

30:32.360 --> 30:33.360
them.

30:33.360 --> 30:34.560
I do a complete distribution upgrade.

30:34.560 --> 30:36.800
I log back in.

30:36.800 --> 30:37.800
Nothing's changed.

30:37.800 --> 30:42.960
I just have up-to-date software that's secure, slightly better, less bugs hopefully but my

30:42.960 --> 30:49.360
Chrome, my Firefox, my Spotify everything works exactly as it was before I did the update.

30:49.360 --> 30:54.240
Well that's the dream of 2018 being the year of Linux on the desktop isn't it?

30:54.240 --> 30:57.880
It's the pragmatist workstation, the people that just want to get their job done.

30:57.880 --> 31:00.740
Well Joe if we're right or wrong we'll report it to the people.

31:00.740 --> 31:05.820
Go to linuxactionnews.com slash subscribe to check in every single week to see how wrong

31:05.820 --> 31:06.820
we were.

31:06.820 --> 31:12.000
Yeah and go to linuxactionnews.com slash contact to tell us how wrong we were.

31:12.000 --> 31:15.280
And please consider supporting the whole network because after we've been this wrong nobody

31:15.280 --> 31:18.440
else will at patreon.com slash Jupiter signal.

31:18.440 --> 31:20.640
I'm sure we'll be right about some things.

31:20.640 --> 31:25.680
So we'll be back next Monday with our usual weekly take on the latest Linux and open source

31:25.680 --> 31:26.680
news.

31:26.680 --> 31:27.680
I'm at Chris Ellis.

31:27.680 --> 31:29.360
I'm at Joe Rissington.

31:29.360 --> 31:31.520
Thank you for joining us and we'll see you next week.

31:31.520 --> 31:32.520
Happy New Year.
