00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,400
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, episode 151, recorded on March 29th, 2020. I'm Chris.

2
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:10,400
And I'm Joe.

3
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:15,400
Hello, Joe. Good to be connected with you. Have you noticed the web just seems a little

4
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:16,400
better this week?

5
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:20,900
Well, it is, according to Mozilla. They've launched a new test pilot, Firefox for a better

6
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:21,900
web.

7
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:28,000
Yeah. I mean, I like a better web. Who doesn't want a better web? So, Scroll, if you recall,

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,540
is a $5 a month service that stops ads from loading on certain websites. But what's interesting

9
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:39,840
about it, it's not technically an ad blocker, but rather it lets publishers know that for

10
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:43,400
this user, they shouldn't serve ads in the first place when you visit.

11
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:47,520
Now, while they're rolling this up, by the way, I will mention just here on the side,

12
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:52,380
for right now, the price is actually $2.50. So, I guess it's a sale. It's an extension

13
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:57,780
we're talking about here that Mozilla's introducing, which would technically work in other browsers.

14
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:04,640
But the experience, they say, is best in Firefox. And the extension includes Scroll as well

15
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:10,640
as a, quote, customized enhanced tracking protection setting that will block third-party

16
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:14,560
trackers, fingerprinters, and crypto miners. You know, the kind of setting that should

17
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:18,680
be turned on by default, but that's according to Mozilla. It will work across different

18
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:22,640
desktop browsers, but that aspect might be Firefox only for now.

19
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:28,680
This deal with Mozilla should get Scroll, in theory, a much larger user base, but neither

20
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:32,280
company would actually disclose what the financial terms were.

21
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:36,600
Yeah, so it'll block all the tracking except for Scroll, who will be tracking which of

22
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:41,000
these websites you're visiting so they can divvy up the money that you're paying proportionally

23
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,120
among the websites that they support.

24
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:47,320
Yeah, at this point, it's not really clear what the extent of that data is. Obviously,

25
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:53,400
you need to know how long you spent reading an article to proportionally pay that publisher.

26
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:57,520
This whole thing kind of reminds me of like the Brave Rewards system, but there just hasn't

27
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:05,220
been a huge adoption of that where this, with Mozilla behind it, could see some adoption.

28
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:09,240
Like if you look right now, it's pretty light. The Verge, for example, is part of it, but

29
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:14,720
most websites aren't. And right now, that hasn't changed. There hasn't been a lot of

30
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:20,080
velocity there. Mozilla's stepping in, giving it their seal of approval. Maybe that changes

31
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,080
things.

32
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:25,800
Well, yeah, this is a huge vote of confidence in Scroll as a solution to the problem of

33
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:31,280
how to pay publishers without loads of tracking and advertising. And surely, that vote of

34
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:36,040
confidence is going to bring more publishers on board. That's if Mozilla still is relevant

35
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:39,880
and Firefox is relevant. Is it relevant enough still? I don't know.

36
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:45,240
Well, the problem seems to be very relevant. This is an issue that goes back as old as

37
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:51,200
the web. How do you monetize content that people expect to read for free? Some publishers

38
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:55,120
with a large audience, like the Wall Street Journal and the New York Times, have been

39
00:02:55,120 --> 00:03:01,000
successful at a paywall, while most publishers are not. Without a good answer to this question,

40
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:07,000
the industry seems to have relied on very privacy invasive techniques to really track

41
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:12,960
you across all properties, to really properly monetize you. And it never really reflected

42
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:19,640
on the value of content. In fact, it sort of encouraged, well, not sort of, it absolutely

43
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:25,720
encouraged clickbait, because more views equals more ad dollars. Whereas a system like this

44
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:31,080
rewards quality content. The more time you actually spend reading and digesting an article,

45
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:32,400
the more they get paid.

46
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:36,560
I think the key to how this is different from Brave is that we're talking about actual

47
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:42,800
cash here, rather than Brave, which is tokens and, let's face it, magic internet beans.

48
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:48,800
Yeah. I think for this to really take traction with the publishers, they've got to return

49
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:53,720
real money. Maybe it's not as much as advertising, but in some cases, for some sites, maybe it

50
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:57,620
would be more. They've got to really deliver results. And then I think publishers would

51
00:03:57,620 --> 00:04:02,600
be all in. This is a win-win. Publishers get rewarded for good content. They don't have

52
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:09,400
to cow-toe to advertisers. And users win out because pages load faster, they use less battery

53
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:13,200
life on mobile, they take less bandwidth, and they're less privacy invasive.

54
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,160
Or you could just use an ad blocker.

55
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:20,280
Yeah. No, I mean, you joke, but I think that's a fair point. And that's free, right? And

56
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:21,840
it's all publishers.

57
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:25,840
Yeah. I haven't seen an ad on a website for a long time.

58
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:30,200
Yeah. And I hope, man, I hope that publishers understand that's who they're really competing

59
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:35,960
with. There's some analogy here to when the iTunes MP3 store launched at 99 cents a track

60
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:40,840
when you could go on LimeWire and download them for free. They had to make it super easy,

61
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:45,280
they had to make it convenient, and they had to make it a reasonable price. And then users

62
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:50,000
switched to the actual commercial legitimate versions. Something like that could happen

63
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:55,080
here. But I think publishers need to remember their real competition is not things like

64
00:04:55,080 --> 00:05:00,360
Brave or Scroll or whatever you want to call it. It is truly ad blockers.

65
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:05,080
Yeah, I think the iTunes analogy isn't quite right. I think Spotify is more spot on there

66
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:10,280
really because there's the free tier where you can, again, listen to adverts. And I think

67
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:13,400
that is what killed music piracy more than iTunes.

68
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:15,200
Streaming killed the download star, you're saying?

69
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:16,200
Yeah, pretty much.

70
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:18,000
Yeah, I could see it.

71
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,640
But the thing is that we already have this free, convenient way to not see adverts that

72
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:29,600
involves just installing an extension, which it seems not just tech savvy people are switched

73
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:38,080
on to. So how can they make this a thing? You've got this kind of problem here in that

74
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:45,280
you need to have all the publishers on board for it to really have value. Whereas if you've

75
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:52,080
only got a handful, then that $2.50 or $5 a month doesn't seem worth it. And I think

76
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:58,040
you've also got to convince people that they need to support good journalism and good content

77
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:04,000
generally and make the argument that using an ad blocker is ultimately going to lead

78
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:10,160
to clickbait and just lower the quality of the web. And this is something I suppose Mozilla

79
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:14,120
should be doing. This is within their remit. Whether it's going to work or not, I don't

80
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:17,720
know. But who else is going to drive this forward but Mozilla?

81
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:22,080
But taking a data approach to it as well. We'll have links in the show notes, but it appears

82
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:28,480
that Mozilla has been running pilots that indicate that 18% of the test users after

83
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:36,440
the free period opted to subscribe. Now, 18% doesn't sound like a lot, but when you consider

84
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:44,900
that the industry average is 3% and 5% is considered a massive success, 18% would suggest,

85
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:52,680
and Mozilla makes this assumption, that users reflect the value in paying for good journalism.

86
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:59,040
And if we give them an easy way to monetize good journalism, they'll take it.

87
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:04,520
But once again, this is only available in the USA for now, as is this way with all of

88
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:08,880
the new things that Mozilla seem to be coming out with for Firefox. And at the moment, it

89
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:15,120
is a test pilot, but that could change relatively soon. They seem to move fairly quickly with

90
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,120
these things.

91
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:21,840
Well, something that's available to anyone that has a Raspberry Pi 4 is Plasma Big Screen.

92
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:26,480
Now I know that all your Raspberry Pi 4s are velcroed down in your dinette, whatever that

93
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:27,480
is.

94
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:28,480
Quite literally, yes.

95
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:36,400
But I've got one kicking around, so I tested this. And what it is, is a big screen experience,

96
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:42,600
as the name suggests. It is the plasma shell, but it's not a plasma desktop. It's using

97
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:47,760
the same technologies that make the plasma desktop. And it's designed to be a 10-foot

98
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:52,880
UI for smart TVs, or give you that smart TV experience, so you could turn any TV into

99
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:53,880
it.

100
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:58,560
Well, my monitor has got HDMI in and some really terrible speakers, so I was able to

101
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:04,720
test it as if it was a TV. And they're calling this a beta. I think that's a bit generous,

102
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:10,600
to be honest. It felt alpha quality to me. But I like what they're doing, and I think

103
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:13,840
it's got potential, but it does need a lot of work.

104
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:20,480
Now what I didn't mention is the Mycroft integration, which is heavy. That integration is integral

105
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:27,960
to it. As soon as you turn it on, Mycroft starts talking at you, making you register

106
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:32,120
it as a Mycroft device. So I had to create an account, and I had to type this alphanumeric

107
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:37,040
thing in and register it. And that finally made it shut up.

108
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:38,520
Did you try any voice commands?

109
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:41,840
I did, but the Raspberry Pi doesn't have a microphone, right? So therefore, you need

110
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:46,280
to plug a microphone into it. So I plugged my audio interface that I'm talking to you

111
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:52,960
over now into it, went into the settings, selected it, and nothing. It just didn't seem

112
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:58,400
to be working with it. And I don't know. I tried everything, and I was like, hey, Mycroft,

113
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:01,720
hey, Mycroft. And it just would not listen to me. I even tried talking to it in an American

114
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:05,840
accent, and that didn't work. So maybe my accent was not good enough.

115
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:06,840
What does that sound like?

116
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:10,400
Hey, Mycroft. And it just wouldn't have it.

117
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:14,960
Yeah, that's totally it. Well, so the idea here is that Mycroft offers what are so-called

118
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:19,680
quote unquote skills. Each skill takes care of a particular voice interaction. They say

119
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:24,400
there's a large variety from weather to date and time and reminders to online service clients

120
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:29,320
and integrations with things like SoundCloud and YouTube. And they can display information

121
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:36,520
using QML inside this big picture, big screen environment. For people listening that want

122
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:39,560
to kind of conceptualize what it looks like, of course, you can just check out the links

123
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:44,880
in the show notes. But if you have an Android television, specifically of the Nvidia Shield

124
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:50,080
variety, this is like a really clean version of that. If you took out all of the trying

125
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:55,960
to push like game stream and different services and just focused on that UI, this is what

126
00:09:55,960 --> 00:10:00,200
you would have a nice, clean implementation of it. But I'm not surprised to hear it's

127
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:07,200
early days. These TV interfaces are surprisingly fiddly and they take a lot of work. I feel

128
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:11,600
like they have a pretty good base, though. The Raspberry Pi 4 is a solid device to target.

129
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:17,240
I am so impressed, even months into using them for production servers. I am impressed

130
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:21,880
and I'm picky and I'm impressed. It's also using KDE neon for the base. So it's a great

131
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:29,320
way to get new cute and plasma libraries in there. And then Libre CEC or Lib CEC, which

132
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:33,300
allows you to control your big screen TV with remote control. And they've tried to bring

133
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:39,800
these things together along with their completely open UI stack to give you an open UI for your

134
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:46,000
television. Is it family ready? Does it have that spousal approval factor? I don't think

135
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,920
so. But I am really pleased to see something in this space that isn't Kodi. Not that Kodi

136
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:53,480
isn't fantastic, but it's one project.

137
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:58,440
Well, that's where I was going to go next with this. Do we need this? We have Kodi fully

138
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:05,280
open source. The brand might be a little tainted by piracy and stuff, but it is a very, very

139
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:13,360
functional open source, full screen, big screen TV experience. Do we really need something

140
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:16,000
from the KDE team for this space?

141
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:21,680
Yes, I'll tell you why. Kodi is so great. If I have a library that I want to point Kodi

142
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:26,520
at and I want to watch media, man, there's just no better TV video player on the planet

143
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:34,920
than Kodi. However, if your interest is more things like Netflix or Twitch or Plex or YouTube,

144
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:38,740
or if Kodi is just one of the many things you want to do with your set top box and you

145
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:44,120
don't want it to be the entire set top box experience, that's where this fits in. And

146
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:48,280
to be honest with you, Joe, it's why I still use an Nvidia Shield. I have Kodi as one of

147
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:53,680
the apps. And when the job calls for Kodi, I use Kodi. But on that same box, I also

148
00:11:53,680 --> 00:12:00,120
have VLC. I also have an actual official Netflix app. I have an official YouTube app. I have

149
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:06,700
an official Plex app. These are for me, cornerstone pieces to the living room. And I know there's

150
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:12,780
plugins that would offer me that same basic functionality in Kodi, but it's not good enough

151
00:12:12,780 --> 00:12:16,020
for me. And it's really not good enough for the family. Truth be told, it's probably good

152
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:20,940
enough for me. And that's where I could see this UI that you implement on a Raspberry

153
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:25,140
Pi 4 instead of something that's like an Nvidia Shield that's hundreds of dollars and not

154
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:29,420
even available in every country. Once it gets good enough, this could replace that kind

155
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:33,060
of functionality. I think my assessment's in line with yours based on what I've seen

156
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:37,600
so far. It's not there yet, but I am tempted to fire it up on a new Pi.

157
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:41,720
Yeah, it's something that I want to play with more, especially I want to try and get the

158
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:48,140
Minecraft stuff going, but I wonder whether they'll ever get official Netflix apps and

159
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:53,720
stuff like that for it. That seems a bit farfetched to me. If you can't even get Kodi working

160
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:58,820
properly and consistently and not breaking all the time with Netflix, then are you really

161
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:05,660
going to get an official app on a new open source TV interface? It seems unlikely.

162
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:11,560
Yeah, probably not. I suppose the best option might be a well-presented web UI.

163
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:17,300
Which is good enough. That's how I use Netflix. So if it was properly embedded, it would be

164
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:22,180
fine, I think. And it is basically just a Plasma desktop underneath, so there's no reason

165
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:23,320
they can't do that.

166
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:27,540
You make a good point, actually. And I think you're touching on something that as a community

167
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:33,260
we are not discussing because it's very uncomfortable. And that is a lot of the things we want to

168
00:13:33,260 --> 00:13:38,920
watch are wrapped up in proprietary services and proprietary apps. And the web experience

169
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:43,780
is there, but it is not the same. Like if I'm just thinking about our home television

170
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:49,540
experience, I have Amazon Prime because I've had Prime forever. I have CBS All Access because

171
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:52,860
I'm going to pay for the development of Future Trek. That's just who I am. Even if I don't

172
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:56,420
watch it via that service, I'm going to pay for it. So I have the app, and when it's available

173
00:13:56,420 --> 00:14:01,460
I like it. I like to watch the behind the scenes stuff and the little mini shows via

174
00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:07,760
their app. Netflix, yep, I got that. YouTube TV, too much, but yep, I got it. These are

175
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:11,740
all proprietary streaming services that are wrapped up in proprietary apps that are available

176
00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:18,280
for iOS and Android that have web versions that are OK, some of them not even optional.

177
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:21,500
And then there's even more services that have launched just this year. Disney Plus is an

178
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:26,900
example of one that my kids love. Peacock from NBC is about to launch. There's a Hulu

179
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:31,340
app. There's Spotify apps. All of these are available in some form or another via the

180
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:35,360
web, but it's a new experience. And it's just not what you're down for when you sit down,

181
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:38,980
you turn on the television, you just want to hit a button on your remote and start enjoying

182
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:43,680
content. And I think fundamentally the issue is these different service providers, if you'll

183
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:48,180
call them that, these, that's essentially what they are. They're content as a service.

184
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:52,920
They just can't be bothered to make desktop apps for Linux. And so it's hard for projects

185
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:58,140
like Plasma Big Screen to integrate them. And Kodi kind of gets around that with some

186
00:14:58,140 --> 00:15:02,460
hacky plug-ins here and there, but it's not 100%. And as a community, we're just not really

187
00:15:02,460 --> 00:15:07,020
talking about this. Maybe we don't have an answer. Well, I tend to use the web version

188
00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:11,780
of everything. Like the Amazon one's fine. Netflix one's fine. I don't have many of the

189
00:15:11,780 --> 00:15:17,360
other services, but I think they're good enough as a kind of stopgap, certainly for people

190
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:22,860
like me who don't mind the odd little glitch here and there. But I think for that kind

191
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:29,420
of spousal approval, family friendly thing, maybe it's not going to be good enough. Well,

192
00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:32,900
even just the TV experience, because I would, I would bet you're probably what, doing that

193
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:38,980
on a laptop or a desktop? Yeah, this is on a desktop with a big monitor essentially,

194
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:43,700
like a TV. Yeah. It's different when you're on a couch and you're 10 feet away, like what

195
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:47,660
this is exactly positioned for. And you're doing it with a remote that has, you know,

196
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:52,080
a directional control and a select button. Yeah, which I didn't have one of those to

197
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:56,600
try this out. I was just using the wireless keyboard, which I always use. And you can

198
00:15:56,600 --> 00:16:01,220
just use the arrow buttons and enter to kind of emulate that. But then you can also alt

199
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:06,780
tab and stuff to some extent on this. So you can see it's desktop routes in there. Ultimately,

200
00:16:06,780 --> 00:16:11,700
these challenges that we've just highlighted won't be resolved unless there is a demand

201
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:17,380
for that content in that layout. And it's projects like this that will get us there.

202
00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:21,940
And so I will probably give it a go at some point. I may wait a few months for development,

203
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:26,980
but I could see here at the studio where it's just me and Wes mostly. This would be perfect.

204
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:30,620
Well, you probably want to get off that Nvidia shell because it's running Android and Android

205
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:35,980
is terribly insecure, isn't it? Hey, apparently. Although thankfully, they haven't figured

206
00:16:35,980 --> 00:16:41,220
out that you go after television apps yet. But two different malware detection vendors,

207
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:46,380
just as a broad category this week, are making a bunch of noise about apps in the Google

208
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:53,100
Play Store that are riddled with spyware, I guess, monitoring, monetization techniques,

209
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:54,420
what do you even call it anymore?

210
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:59,500
Yeah, adware spyware, there's various definitions of it. But either way, I suppose crapware

211
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:01,140
is probably the best way to put it.

212
00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:06,020
Yeah, one of them was in 56 different apps that they checked. A lot of them were targeted

213
00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:11,220
at children, surprise, surprise. And it seems like we're looking at a 1.7 million device

214
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:15,980
install base here. There's a cool aspect to this show, real cool guy developer trick that

215
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:21,100
they did to get clicks that looked organic on the ads they were serving up. Because of

216
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:24,460
course, users aren't necessarily going to just tap ads that show up on their device,

217
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:28,220
even if they can present them to the end user doesn't mean they're going to tap them. So

218
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:31,220
if you could come up with a cool guy way to still get some clicks, then you're really

219
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:38,380
making the money. And this round of malware used Androids motion event mechanism to simulate

220
00:17:38,380 --> 00:17:42,260
clicks based on just moving around in your pocket or moving around in your hand, it would

221
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:47,140
translate that to rando clicks to make it look real to advertisers. So they were able

222
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:53,940
to fraud legitimate ad services like Google's AdMob. Another couple of interesting bits

223
00:17:53,940 --> 00:18:00,220
that I suppose are somewhat noteworthy. They wrote these apps in native Android languages,

224
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:03,620
you know, use Java in the right spots, use other languages in the right spots to make

225
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:07,740
it look like legitimate background apps or games. And then there's the separate group

226
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:14,460
Dr. Webb, who found a whole other batch of infected apps not even related to this using

227
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:17,820
a whole nother branch of malware called Android Circle one.

228
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:24,060
Hang on a second. What happened to the App Defense Alliance? This is something we reported

229
00:18:24,060 --> 00:18:30,220
on back in November last year, where Google partnered up with three antivirus firms, ESET,

230
00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:34,920
Lookout and Zimperium. And the idea of that was that they kind of pool their resources

231
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:40,020
and make sure stuff like this did not happen. They'd be scanning applications that were

232
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:44,620
submitted to the Play Store and monitoring them and working with the technology that

233
00:18:44,620 --> 00:18:50,100
Google already has and avoiding this from happening. And yet I keep reading about more

234
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:55,660
and more cases where researchers are finding these malicious apps in the Play Store.

235
00:18:55,660 --> 00:19:00,540
In that something three different vendors, all of which would be using their technologies

236
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:06,300
to scan play submissions before they even went live. And yet here we are. And last time

237
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:11,180
on the show when something like this came up, I just said, hands up. Android is the

238
00:19:11,180 --> 00:19:16,040
new windows for end users. Don't let friends and family use Android. Guys like you who

239
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:22,120
know about lineage or people who maybe aren't looking for background changers or pop the

240
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:26,760
bubble games that are going to install Android malware. They're fine. If that's not you,

241
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:32,620
you're fine. But friends and family that are not savvy, don't let them run Android. Not

242
00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:36,900
only do they end up with crap phones from carriers that generally are loaded with carrier

243
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:42,740
crap and underspect, but even if they get a good Android device, there's still hundreds

244
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:47,580
of thousands of apps that make it into the Play Store that are riddled with crap that

245
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:52,420
will make their phone slow, steal their private information and drain their battery.

246
00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:56,860
That's not a good situation where someone on a Linux podcast is saying essentially use

247
00:19:56,860 --> 00:19:59,080
iOS, not the Linux based phone.

248
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:04,080
It's really so sad. It took me a while to get to this point, because I wanted to think

249
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:09,660
maybe with the pixel devices and this this Android malware alliance that we talked about

250
00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:12,980
in November, I thought maybe finally Google will get this together.

251
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:17,880
It's funny. I don't think I would go so far as to say use an iPhone and Android is not

252
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:22,520
secure. But I think there was a time when I would have said, just stick to the Play

253
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:27,920
Store and you'll be fine. Whereas now I think it's just stick to well-known applications.

254
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:32,380
If you're installing Facebook, WhatsApp, all of the standard stuff, then yeah, you're going

255
00:20:32,380 --> 00:20:38,300
to get all the tracking that goes along with that. But at least that's big billion dollar

256
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:39,300
business tracking.

257
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:48,180
You're selling me on this. I'm really not selling myself on this. Don't go for obscure

258
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:53,300
apps essentially and read reviews. But then I suppose they can be faked as well.

259
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:58,260
And the problem is, is that is great advice for people that are the type of user that

260
00:20:58,260 --> 00:21:03,900
listen to a podcast like this. But for my family members, like my aunts and uncles,

261
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:08,900
it's just completely lost on them. If it's in the Play Store, they have the expectation

262
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:13,460
that it's completely safe to install. And I would bet you my family members have been

263
00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:19,180
bitten by stuff like this because I've been handed their phones at family events and they

264
00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:24,600
hand them to me and they're hot to hold. And they have like two hours of battery life.

265
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:28,660
And some of them are newish. They're like some big LG device with a ginormous screen

266
00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:34,780
and 15 cameras on the back. And they just got it for a great deal from the Verizon store.

267
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:40,740
But then what is Google to do? We get up in arms when they kick open source apps out because

268
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:44,580
they don't follow the rules. But if they make the rules even stricter, then it's going to

269
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:49,900
be much harder for developers to get their apps in there. Like with iOS, my understanding

270
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:55,740
is that is not straightforward at all. It's not open in the slightest in terms of getting

271
00:21:55,740 --> 00:22:00,820
your apps and you have to jump through hoops to get them into that app store. But then

272
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:05,620
we don't hear many stories about malware making it through the gates. No, it's mostly those

273
00:22:05,620 --> 00:22:11,220
billion dollar companies. Like there was just some story about Zoom. Even if you didn't

274
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:15,120
have a Facebook ID, the Zoom iOS app was sending your information to Facebook and they just

275
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:19,900
fixed that. But that kind of stuff happens all the time on iOS. Yeah, it's tricky because

276
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:27,860
how often do you hear about Google having an issue around executing at scale and scope?

277
00:22:27,860 --> 00:22:32,100
Like that's not generally their thing. They don't generally have issues executing at scale.

278
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:35,660
But with the Play Store, it seems like they are. Well, maybe they'll have an answer for

279
00:22:35,660 --> 00:22:40,540
this at Google IO. Oh, hang on. No, that's not happening this year. Ah, too soon. Yeah,

280
00:22:40,540 --> 00:22:45,200
to be fair to them, it was a sensible decision. And a quick update on something that we reported

281
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:50,540
on last week, and that is Chrome and Chrome OS releases, which were paused, but it seems

282
00:22:50,540 --> 00:22:56,540
only for a week because instead of just security updates, they're going to continue on with

283
00:22:56,540 --> 00:23:01,380
Chrome and Chrome OS updates. So what was the point of the pause? It's not like a week

284
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:05,420
is enough time. If somebody in their area was going to get sick, it could still happen.

285
00:23:05,420 --> 00:23:11,600
It's not like Corona is gone. Maybe they just were pausing to do an assessment of what resources

286
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:15,420
they had. And maybe they did the math and worked out that if a certain number of people

287
00:23:15,420 --> 00:23:21,260
go down, you know, they'll be all right. So yeah, a bit strange. Yeah, you know, given

288
00:23:21,260 --> 00:23:25,500
the benefit of the doubt, maybe they were preemptively over communicating expectations

289
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:29,180
saying, Hey, as we go remote, we don't know as a team what we can deliver. Oh, by the

290
00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:32,860
way, we're remote. Now. I think we've got our feet underneath us. Okay, we're resuming

291
00:23:32,860 --> 00:23:37,380
normal operation. Interesting, though, that Microsoft are not going to be releasing Windows

292
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:42,580
preview releases in May because of all of this. So maybe Google's a little bit more

293
00:23:42,580 --> 00:23:47,820
agile than Microsoft. Oh, Microsoft always slightly behind the trends. Well, a company

294
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:54,260
that tried to ride on the trends was Telegram. And they had this huge ICR $1.7 billion of

295
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:58,300
investment. And they've been struggling ever since to get their coins out there. They call

296
00:23:58,300 --> 00:24:04,140
them grams, struggling with regulators. And this week, they were dealt a serious, serious

297
00:24:04,140 --> 00:24:09,460
blow, which looks like it might be the end of this project. Not just the end of the project,

298
00:24:09,460 --> 00:24:14,940
but spell serious long term trouble for telegram. This week, a federal court judge sided with

299
00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:19,460
the US Securities and Exchange Commission against telegram and granted a preliminary

300
00:24:19,460 --> 00:24:26,460
injunction against that 1.7 billion initial coin offering. In an opinion, an order filed

301
00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:30,900
on Tuesday with the New York Southern District Court read a spot in the United States that

302
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:36,020
is very aggressive against cryptocurrencies. The SEC has shown substantial likelihood of

303
00:24:36,020 --> 00:24:41,540
success in proving that telegrams plan to distribute grams is offering securities, and

304
00:24:41,540 --> 00:24:47,700
they have a test called the Howie test, h o w e y. So Howie Howie, and essentially anything

305
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:53,700
that meets this test is considered a securities and the telegram gram in their quote unquote

306
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:59,180
emergency filing, they have an emergency filing jokes, it's an emergency. They say it clearly

307
00:24:59,180 --> 00:25:04,060
meets this test. And so they're clearly essentially trading on the idea that if you bought in

308
00:25:04,060 --> 00:25:09,200
now you could sell for a higher rate later to a bunch of people, which is true. That's

309
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:10,200
hard to argue.

310
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:16,500
Yeah, that's the whole point of an ICO, right? You sell a bunch of investment in your cryptocurrency

311
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:22,060
low. And then once it launches, the value goes up. And then you cash out and make a

312
00:25:22,060 --> 00:25:26,460
bunch of money. It's basic investment. But they were trying to argue that it wasn't an

313
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:29,340
investment and they just have lost.

314
00:25:29,340 --> 00:25:34,940
Yeah, and the SEC is arguing the telegram knew all along. They understood that purchasers

315
00:25:34,940 --> 00:25:41,620
would not be willing to pay $1.7 billion to acquire grams merely as a means to just store

316
00:25:41,620 --> 00:25:47,860
and transfer value. Telegram recognized and developed a scheme according to the SEC to

317
00:25:47,860 --> 00:25:51,900
maximize the amount of initial purchasers and would be willing to pay by creating a

318
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:57,820
structure to allow these purchasers to maximize the value they receive upon resale to the

319
00:25:57,820 --> 00:26:02,620
market. In other words, they knew all along, they built it this way. And that proves their

320
00:26:02,620 --> 00:26:08,540
case. So telegram has been served an injunction that prevents them from issuing grams or doing

321
00:26:08,540 --> 00:26:13,660
anything with the cryptocurrency until after their hearing. They could fight this, but

322
00:26:13,660 --> 00:26:18,820
it is extremely unlikely that telegram is going to fight this. And it is very likely

323
00:26:18,820 --> 00:26:24,380
the telegram will end up having to pay the money back, which they don't have. They don't

324
00:26:24,380 --> 00:26:29,460
have 1.7 billion just sitting in a bank account. The guy behind telegram is rich, but he's

325
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:35,180
not that rich. And if telegram is ordered to pay it back, they're going to face a very

326
00:26:35,180 --> 00:26:37,380
particular kind of painful situation.

327
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:44,260
Yeah, I'm thinking, do we move to signal, WhatsApp or what? We use telegram heavily.

328
00:26:44,260 --> 00:26:48,140
I know. It would really be a shame to see telegram go away. But I think in the back

329
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:51,740
of our minds, we've always wondered what's the end game here? What's the monetization

330
00:26:51,740 --> 00:26:52,740
strategy?

331
00:26:52,740 --> 00:26:57,560
Yeah, I talk to everyone on that. Like all my friends basically are on there. So I'm

332
00:26:57,560 --> 00:27:03,420
sure we'll all move to something pretty quickly if it does go away. But it just seems strange

333
00:27:03,420 --> 00:27:10,620
to think that all our chat history and everything will just be gone. And surely not, but $1.7

334
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:12,360
billion is a lot of money.

335
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:15,140
Time to start a people's movement to open source all the telegram.

336
00:27:15,140 --> 00:27:19,820
Yeah, there's been various open source bits of it. But maybe if the back end was somehow

337
00:27:19,820 --> 00:27:25,060
open sourced and federalized, we could maybe keep it going peer to peer. It seems a long

338
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:26,060
shot though.

339
00:27:26,060 --> 00:27:30,480
Yeah. Plus, you know, Vlad's got a really good internet connection in his basement.

340
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:33,300
So you got to go down to Putin, you got to convince him to get the server out of there

341
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:38,500
and put it up like on DigitalOcean. It's going to cost. Well, whatever happens with this

everything you need to know. It's a great episode of the user error program.

348

Yeah, I think you need to do it in the proper voice. Well, actually.
