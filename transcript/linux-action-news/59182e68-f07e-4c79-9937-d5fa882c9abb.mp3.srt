00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,120
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, episode 158, recorded on October 11, 2020.

2
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:10,120
I'm Chris.

3
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:11,120
And I'm Joe.

4
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:12,120
Hello, Joe.

5
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:13,120
Good to be connected with you.

6
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:17,680
We start this week with the project that's taking aim right at Slack, MS Teams, and all

7
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:18,680
the others.

8
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:20,920
It's Nextcloud with version 20.

9
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:25,660
Is it taking aim at them or is it just integrating them, accepting that they exist and that people

10
00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:29,880
will use Nextcloud alongside them or now with them?

11
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:31,560
Is all of the above an option?

12
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:36,520
I think it really is a strategy of try to offer an alternative while also integrate.

13
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:37,520
Embrace and extinguish.

14
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:39,480
Oh, I think so.

15
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:41,760
Only this time it's okay because it's from an open source project.

16
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:47,520
I mean, one of the big features in Nextcloud 20 is that talk is introduced bridging to

17
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:51,120
Teams, Slack, IRC, Matrix, and a dozen others.

18
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:53,040
And it's actually a pretty cool setup the way they've done it.

19
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:57,820
It looks like a pretty solid connection that remains persistent even when the users are

20
00:00:57,820 --> 00:00:59,200
not logged in.

21
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:03,160
And in Nextcloud 20, they've introduced sort of a watchdog type service that monitors the

22
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:05,840
bridge and will restart it if something goes wrong.

23
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:10,080
And the idea is they're trying to create high availability corporate level communications

24
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:13,420
that pull in the different sources into Nextcloud 20.

25
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:17,280
And they've got this new dashboard, which is the kind of home screen.

26
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:20,520
And you can have a bunch of widgets on there and you can edit them and have whatever you

27
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:24,920
want and you can integrate Twitter and weather and all sorts of stuff on there.

28
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:28,640
But I have to wonder, are they overcomplicating things?

29
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:33,720
Yeah, I'm on the side of maybe it's too much, but I think the answer might be it depends

30
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:35,040
on how you Nextcloud.

31
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:40,360
I Nextcloud mostly for file sync, but I think there are a good portion in our community

32
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:44,940
that use Nextcloud for calendar and contact management.

33
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:48,880
And I know even some of our friends use it for project management, like Kanban style

34
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:50,900
project management and whatnot.

35
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:57,040
And so if I kind of had a wide range of uses for Nextcloud, I could see the use of having

36
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:58,680
a heads up dashboard.

37
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:03,160
For me, it feels like something I have to get rid of to get to what I want to use Nextcloud

38
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:04,160
for.

39
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:07,160
It's if you haven't seen the screenshots yet, and we do have a link at linuxactionnews.com

40
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:08,160
slash 158.

41
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:13,520
But if you look at the screenshot of it, you'll see a card style dashboard with big cloudy

42
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:14,520
background.

43
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:15,520
It says good evening.

44
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:20,360
It has the weather, the time and then four columns that give you a heads up of your recent

45
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:24,840
mentions, your upcoming events, your recommended files, all kinds of different things you can

46
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:26,160
customize it.

47
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,160
It's nice.

48
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:29,740
It's a screen that in theory could get you right at some of this stuff.

49
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:30,740
That's great.

50
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:34,440
But for me, I just want to get to my team folder where I'm working on a project with

51
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:36,480
everybody here on the team.

52
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:37,920
And I just got to click right past it.

53
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:42,040
I got a hot tip, though, Joe, you can just bookmark the URLs in your browser, like even

54
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:44,960
several directories deep, and you can jump right to it.

55
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:46,600
And you can bypass this dashboard.

56
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:50,800
Yeah, well, I didn't even know about the dashboard until I read about it, because that's exactly

57
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:51,800
what I've done.

58
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:56,360
I've got a bookmark for the raw folder where we put the flags.

59
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:59,000
And so I had to actively seek this dashboard out.

60
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,040
Yeah, I would maybe use it to fight.

61
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:05,260
So say I used all the things like I pulled in everything like my slack and my matrix

62
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:07,760
messages in the next cloud.

63
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:12,560
And then I wanted a really rad, dynamic start page that every time I open my browser, it

64
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:13,560
just loaded.

65
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:16,000
I mean, maybe I could maybe see the use for it.

66
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:21,960
But at this point in time, I don't think it's not really a business priority to change our

67
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:23,160
productivity workflow.

68
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:26,600
It just isn't going to migrate in an xCloud at this point in time.

69
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:29,580
I don't know, maybe people that are starting fresh today would use that.

70
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:33,080
Maybe and it's interesting that in the post about this, they say that it'll be there for

71
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:35,020
you when you start your day.

72
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:41,560
They are trying to make this your homepage, almost like that you will bookmark that and

73
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:43,080
set that as default.

74
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:46,360
And it's the first thing you're going to look at, and you'll get all your notifications

75
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:51,320
and everything in one place, which does kind of make sense for enterprise if you built

76
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:53,240
everything around that.

77
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:57,000
But if you haven't already, are you going to switch to it?

78
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,360
That's what they're trying to convince people, and I don't think I am quite convinced.

79
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:06,280
It reminds me of the Outlook today screen back from my old days at corporate offices

80
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:11,040
where we'd have Outlook that you had this this main screen in some versions of Outlook

81
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:14,480
that would have all of your tasks and your messages and your calendar and your contact

82
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:15,560
information.

83
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:18,980
This feels like a more modern version of this that just plays with more sources.

84
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:22,760
But Nextcloud 20 itself, we've upgraded two servers here at Jupiter Broadcasting.

85
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:27,480
We went pretty in depth in that process in a recent episode of Linux Unplugged.

86
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:33,660
And in that episode, episode 374, we outlined what we think is a really rock solid enterprise

87
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:37,080
grade bulletproof Nextcloud setup.

88
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:42,120
And we took it through three different upgrade processes to bring it up to 20 and reflect

89
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:46,760
on what we did right and what we had to tweak for our hosted Nextcloud setup, which is both

90
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:49,600
on premises and on cloud.

91
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:52,920
And if you're thinking about Nextcloud, you haven't pulled the trigger yet, check out

92
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:56,960
Linux Unplugged, linuxunplugged.com slash 374.

93
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:01,400
Because I've been using our current setup for a year, we all have as a team.

94
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:02,400
And I'm really happy with it.

95
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,880
We just had to make some changes to make it a little more cost efficient.

96
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:07,160
And we update everyone in that episode.

97
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:11,260
And what my takeaway was, is for a small team, at least it is production grade.

98
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:12,520
It stood the test of time.

99
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:16,920
It's performed pretty solid after we made initial adjustments and how we use it.

100
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:21,360
And this was really our exit point where we considered a different sync solution.

101
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,360
And we're sticking with it.

102
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:26,880
Your setup there sounds an awful lot like hybrid cloud to me, something that IBM is

103
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:27,880
going to bet the farm on.

104
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:31,160
Yeah, at least what's going to be left of the farm.

105
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:36,760
This week, IBM announced they're splitting into two companies by the end of 2021.

106
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:41,180
And we have a yet unnamed new co that will handle most of the managed infrastructure

107
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:48,060
services for IBM, like IT infrastructure, service delivery, operational efficiency consulting,

108
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:54,400
what works out to be around $19 billion of IBM's current businesses is splitting off.

109
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:59,840
And the $59 billion worth that's going to be left is hybrid cloud and AI.

110
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:04,060
What that exactly means is not that clear to me.

111
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:07,880
What's also kind of strange about this, Joe, when you look at it is what will end up happening

112
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:13,320
is NewCo, for lack of a better name, will just end up having IBM as their largest client.

113
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:17,640
Well, it's quite clear that there's going to be a continued business relationship between

114
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:18,640
them.

115
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:21,000
They're going to be working together quite a lot, even if it's not as part of the same

116
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,680
official company.

117
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:27,720
And if it isn't clear, Red Hat will remain with the IBM side of the split.

118
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:30,160
They're basically key to the hybrid cloud strategy.

119
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,840
What is IBM's cloud play here?

120
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:33,160
Well, they don't really have one.

121
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:36,480
I mean, claiming that they're going to make cloud services the future of their business.

122
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:41,760
Well, the only real cloud presence I can see that they have, by any public measure, is

123
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:43,980
the deployment of Red Hat Enterprise Linux itself.

124
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:46,740
It's not like they have an AWS or Azure equivalent.

125
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:49,940
They're not even like fifth or sixth tier, right?

126
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:53,760
Oracle has more of a public cloud play here than IBM does.

127
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:57,140
So where they take this in the future is going to be interesting, because if you look into

128
00:06:57,140 --> 00:07:02,040
IBM's financials, and you actually break it up, I don't really see a big cloud business.

129
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:06,860
What I see is sales and consulting that gets lumped into cloud.

130
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:08,700
So where the future is for them, I'm not sure.

131
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:12,060
But it's obvious that Red Hat is going to be a key strategy.

132
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:17,080
And now that IBM's splitting up, and that what remains is becoming a little leaner and

133
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:21,360
meaner, it kind of means Red Hat all of a sudden just became a bigger fish in that pond.

134
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:26,520
Well, it was Arvind Krishna, who's now the CEO of IBM, who was instrumental in the purchase

135
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:27,700
of Red Hat.

136
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:33,740
So it's not a huge surprise that he's really pushing Red Hat to the forefront of what they

137
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:35,640
want to do as a business.

138
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:40,320
And IBM, as a company, has been around for a long time, over 100 years.

139
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:44,640
And they've had to pivot and adapt throughout the years.

140
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:52,080
And this is the latest gamble, right, is to go all in on this Red Hat hybrid cloud focus.

141
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:54,320
And it seems a reasonable bet to me.

142
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:59,040
You know, hybrid cloud sounds like a buzzword, and the more I say it, the more of a buzzword

143
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:00,040
it sounds like.

144
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:04,800
But if you break it down, it's really talking about utilizing on-premises resource and the

145
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:10,680
best of cloud resources, which is an extremely efficient and practical way to build an environment.

146
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:18,320
And in the world of corporate IT and on-premises hardware and services, IBM still has a very

147
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:20,040
strong brand.

148
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:22,600
And I actually think that will come into play.

149
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:28,240
If the theory is such that there is still 80% of the cloud market left, what we have

150
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:33,560
seen so far has been the easy 20% to put in the cloud, and what remains is the 80% stuff

151
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:38,120
that is hard, the on-premises stuff that's on-premises for a very good reason, if anyone

152
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:42,960
is going to successfully hybridify that, if you'll allow the term, I actually think it

153
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:44,880
could be IBM and Red Hat.

154
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:49,160
They have good brands, they have good consulting arms, they have good sales arms, they know

155
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:54,060
how to work that corporate game, which is absolutely key to this.

156
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:58,360
There could be a lot of potential in Upshot here, but I think it hinges on the idea that

157
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:00,980
the way we've always done things is going to remain.

158
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:05,720
Because what the implicit acknowledgement of hybrid is, is that you're continuing an

159
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:07,320
old way of doing things.

160
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:10,840
You're running things on-premises on your own land, you have to have staff, there's

161
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:16,200
a lot to manage, there's hardware, all of which I've just recently re-opted into doing.

162
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:20,960
So I acknowledge there's absolute value to it, but when you're a lean, mean, cut, operational

163
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:24,760
cost corporation, it is maybe not appealing.

164
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:29,120
And maybe as new corporations start up or they reboot, they may look to go with all

165
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,360
cloud options.

166
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:33,900
As I've witnessed with some recent companies I've worked for, they don't even have on-premises

167
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:36,520
file servers or domain servers.

168
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:37,520
It's all cloud-based.

169
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:42,920
Yes, but what you're forgetting is that hybrid cloud can mean just hedging your bets in the

170
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:50,480
cloud using AWS and Azure or GCP and Azure or some combination of all three or a bunch

171
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:52,680
more cloud providers.

172
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:58,400
And that's where Red Hat comes into it with OpenShift and everything, allowing you to

173
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:03,520
spread the load across different cloud providers so that you're not totally locked into one

174
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:04,520
vendor.

175
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:08,160
And part of that can be on-premises or it doesn't necessarily have to be.

176
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:09,600
It can be a mix, right?

177
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:12,360
And I think that's why in a lot of ways it just makes sense.

178
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:17,080
And then there's a couple of other factors that I think will be this way for a very long

179
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:18,360
time.

180
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:24,440
On-premises is more private and storage, as far as I can see for a while, is always going

181
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:28,880
to be cheaper when you can buy a lot of local disk versus renting storage from someone in

182
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:29,880
the cloud.

183
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:35,360
And I think if nothing else, there's a lot of driving use cases for just privacy.

184
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:40,700
Ultimate achievable privacy and ultimate achievable low-cost storage is always going to be an

185
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:45,600
on-premises winner, and that's just one of probably many use cases where on-premises

186
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,840
is always going to be superior.

187
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:49,800
And that's why I think it is actually a pretty clever play.

188
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:54,100
If you were going to bet, I bet this is how a lot of things will end up for most businesses.

189
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:55,240
This is how it's going to look.

190
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:59,920
And that's what they're hedging on, but it's going to be the biggest pivot we've ever seen

191
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:05,100
from this 100-plus-year-old company because what they're really known for is what they

192
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:06,780
achieved in the 80s.

193
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:11,760
And I witnessed it firsthand, and this was in the late, late 90s, I witnessed an IBM

194
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:15,240
rep that showed up before anyone else had made it to the building.

195
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:18,520
IBM had gotten a message that our mainframe had a disk failure.

196
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:20,520
This was for a bank back in the day.

197
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:21,520
And yes, it was a mainframe.

198
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:23,160
It had a disk failure.

199
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:28,400
And IBM was alerted, and they dispatched a service tech with a new disk in his briefcase

200
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:30,940
before anyone had even arrived at the building.

201
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:33,520
And I got there before the sun came up.

202
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:38,780
And that's when I realized, oh, that's why they pay so much for IBM service because as

203
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:42,220
a bank, they just needed that level of reliability.

204
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:45,920
And at a certain point, technology becomes only so reliable, and then you have to have

205
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:49,720
a human contract that takes care of those failure scenarios.

206
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:51,960
And IBM built their name for that.

207
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:53,840
You never got fired for choosing IBM.

208
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:55,400
That used to be the mantra.

209
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:59,680
If they can still cash in on that but pivot before it's too late, they could have a bright

210
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:00,680
future.

211
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:02,200
And that's what we're witnessing is them make that attempt.

212
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:06,480
Yeah, and it seems that the culture of Red Hat fits in perfectly with that.

213
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:10,280
Because if you're willing to pay Red Hat enough, you can get exactly that kind of white glove

214
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:13,680
service from them.

215
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:15,000
System 76.com.

216
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,920
Let me reintroduce you to who System 76 is.

217
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:20,760
If you haven't checked out a great friend of the Linux community in a while, it's worth

218
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:21,880
giving them a visit.

219
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:26,040
You might know that their Thaleo workstations are designed and built here in the US.

220
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:28,880
Did you know that their laptops are also assembled in the US?

221
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:33,400
And now with System 76 integration of the software, the two have never worked better

222
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:34,400
together.

223
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:36,520
It's becoming something really special with Pop!

224
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:37,520
OS.

225
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:38,520
I've switched to Pop!

226
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:42,200
OS as my daily driver, and a big part of it was they nailed auto-tiling.

227
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:46,480
It's built on modern technologies, it has intuitive keyboard navigations and shortcuts,

228
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:50,360
and rumor has it it's worth learning that stuff because there may be a future where

229
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:51,360
Pop!

230
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:52,760
OS doesn't even require a mouse.

231
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:57,360
You've got fractional scaling built in now, hybrid graphics mode supports external displays.

232
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,280
I'm telling you, the current release of Pop!

233
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:04,240
OS just keeps getting better, and I think there's a new version just around the corner.

234
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:07,160
Go check out a friend of the Linux community, System76.com.

235
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:14,000
Well, NVIDIA gave me a dark vision of the future, or maybe the present, at their virtual

236
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,160
GPU technology conference.

237
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:20,360
They announced a lot of AI-related stuff, and I'm scared.

238
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:21,800
Yeah, Joe, get ready.

239
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:25,640
It's going to be AI through the whole stack, they say, but the thing they announced that

240
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:31,400
I'm probably the most interested in is the Jetson Nano, which is a 2GB developer kit.

241
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:36,560
It's an SBC that runs NVIDIA code for $60 a pop, so it's pretty cheap in this realm

242
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:39,460
for something that can run CUDA code.

243
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:46,720
And it has 2GB of RAM, as the name would suggest, it has a Cortex-A57 CPU clocked at 1.43GHz,

244
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:49,880
and a 128-core NVIDIA Maxwell GPU.

245
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:55,600
They did already offer a $99 version of the Jetson Nano with 4GB of RAM, but at $59,

246
00:13:55,600 --> 00:14:02,320
that is a very low barrier to entry for people who want to get into CUDA and AI.

247
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:06,280
The stuff they talked about, though, that sounds like a really interesting future is

248
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:15,060
using AI to analyze a face and then stream, essentially, a digital render of that face

249
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:17,480
at significantly less bandwidth.

250
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:23,560
I find that kind of thing fascinating because it means, potentially, you would be a puppet

251
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:25,320
master without having to do anything.

252
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:28,060
Your face is just being tracked by the computer.

253
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:32,940
And then an avatar that looks a lot like you, but maybe like an avatar with skin smoothing

254
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:37,520
effect turned on, like a camera filter effect, it looks like that, basically.

255
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:42,560
And the bandwidth savings is pretty significant, where something might take almost 100K a frame

256
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:45,540
to do a video conversation.

257
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:50,400
An AI version, that data, just the points of what to move in the other end of the software,

258
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:52,200
that can be less than a kilobyte a frame.

259
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:57,040
Yeah, and all they need to do is send one frame first as the key frame, as a reference

260
00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:02,160
point for your face, and then they just animate it with this data.

261
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:03,560
That is just freaky to me.

262
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:06,400
It's just, I don't like it one bit.

263
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:11,040
I've also heard some discussion of some kind of machine learning or intelligence that's

264
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:16,480
in the network card itself and dealing with packet loss and retransmits in an intelligent

265
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:17,480
way.

266
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:19,600
And then, of course, there's something on the other end that's also intelligent.

267
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:23,080
Imagine that, the computer making decisions on how to better network.

268
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:26,720
I don't know if it's possible, but these are the kind of conversations they're having.

269
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:28,280
And this is the use cases.

270
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:32,520
You build it in at the chip level at all levels is, of course, Nvidia is going to make that

271
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:34,800
case because they sell the chip for that.

272
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:39,160
I think the freakiest demo that they showed was the axis fixing.

273
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:43,540
So if you're looking off to the side in your video call, it can automatically make it look

274
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:47,040
as if you're looking right down the barrel of the camera.

275
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:51,200
I just don't understand how that's even possible, and I don't like it, again.

276
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:56,160
It's just too creepy and too much like a dystopian movie from the 80s.

277
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:59,300
Apple was working on that for FaceTime, and then they axed it.

278
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:03,360
But they had that as a beta feature at one point where it would correct your eye gaze.

279
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:05,240
So that way, it didn't look like you're looking at the camera.

280
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:07,600
Or that way, when you're looking at yourself, it looks like you're looking at the camera

281
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:08,600
is actually the way to put it.

282
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:12,880
Well, yeah, but it just seems too open to abuse to me with deep fakes and everything.

283
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:15,740
And what's the future of this going to look like?

284
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:20,740
Instead of just getting phishing emails or texts, you're potentially going to get something

285
00:16:20,740 --> 00:16:26,360
that looks like one of your relatives on a video call, and they'll deep fake the voice,

286
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:28,800
and more easily deep fake the face now.

287
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,700
I just don't like where this is going.

288
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:34,680
It is a weird line where it becomes all of a sudden very artificial.

289
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:37,680
When it's the gaze, that's one thing, you know, okay, now it looks like you're looking

290
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:38,680
at the camera.

291
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:40,000
Okay, so that's an improvement.

292
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:44,720
But when it's essentially an entire 3D representation of your face, and what's on the other side

293
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:50,800
is a rendered avatar modeled on your face, that's a different game.

294
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:54,720
But you can imagine how much easier it is to transmit that kind of data.

295
00:16:54,720 --> 00:17:01,120
If we could switch to that kind of system, I mean, how else are you going to communicate

296
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,460
with people in real time on Mars?

297
00:17:02,460 --> 00:17:03,460
We got to start somewhere.

298
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:04,460
I mean, think about it.

299
00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:09,200
Like, it really opens up the possibilities if you can start transmitting 3D representations

300
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:13,760
of people instead of their actual image, which has to be sent as close to 30 frames per second

301
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:14,760
as possible.

302
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:15,760
It's just super inefficient.

303
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:19,440
I'm afraid not even this technology is going to make real time communication with Mars

304
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:20,440
possible.

305
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:24,680
It's just too far away, unless they can somehow make the data travel faster than light, which

306
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:26,280
seems pretty unlikely to me.

307
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:27,600
Oh, I've got the solution.

308
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:31,360
I'm sure Nvidia will have a chip one day that does quantum bit flipping.

309
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:36,440
So you'll have a chip, two identical chips, and they will instantly flip bits at the same

310
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:37,440
time.

311
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:38,440
And problem solved.

312
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:39,440
Somebody just has to get working on it.

313
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:40,440
Should be easy.

314
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:42,600
Yeah, I'm sure we'll be talking about that this time next year.

315
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:49,320
In an even near future, Firefox may soon display sponsored top sites on the new tab page.

316
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:54,400
This came to light from a bug report, where essentially someone was asking for the ability

317
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:56,300
to turn this off.

318
00:17:56,300 --> 00:18:03,040
So it may not come to pass, but I think it is reasonably likely that it will happen.

319
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:07,760
Because Mozilla needs to make some revenue from Firefox, and this seems like a reasonable

320
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:09,040
way to do it to me.

321
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:13,440
Right, and unfortunately, because this is the result of bug spelunking, which is great

322
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:18,040
and a totally reasonable way to get news from open source, it's something we do from time

323
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:19,100
to time.

324
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:21,020
It's not an announcement from Mozilla.

325
00:18:21,020 --> 00:18:23,520
And it's not with a rollout plan.

326
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,240
All of that may be forthcoming yet.

327
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:28,660
I mean, you could kind of guess they'll probably do some sort of staggered rollout in the United

328
00:18:28,660 --> 00:18:32,880
States, like they do with most of these kinds of new features.

329
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:35,520
And it appears they'll likely have a way to turn this off.

330
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:38,800
Yeah, but here's the idea is Mozilla's run trials.

331
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:43,840
They have an idea of the views that this gets, the kind of earnings this gets.

332
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:48,880
And it seems like the new tab page was built with this in mind, and then they kind of walked

333
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:49,980
it back.

334
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:56,240
And now this is kind of coming back to that original idea that I think inspired the creation

335
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:58,360
of the new tab page that we have today.

336
00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:04,320
My question to you is, as a dedicated Firefox user, does this bother you at all?

337
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:09,160
Well, no, because I disabled this when it first arrived and any new installation, I

338
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:10,160
disabled it.

339
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:14,680
I just want a blank tab or just go to Google or whatever for my homepage.

340
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:15,680
Right.

341
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:17,520
Blast that tab open as fast as possible.

342
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:22,000
For those of you listening, this is the Firefox home content section where you can turn off

343
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,520
individual aspects of that new tab page.

344
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:27,240
This doesn't sit well with me, honestly.

345
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:32,400
But the reason why this doesn't sit well with me is because I have come of the belief that

346
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:37,080
if Mozilla had managed this better, they wouldn't be in this position.

347
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:41,560
And they essentially ceded a winning position to Google, who has an obvious interest in

348
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:45,180
the browser market, and they were ineffectual in combating it.

349
00:19:45,180 --> 00:19:47,920
And now they're in a pretty bad financial state.

350
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:54,440
And as a result, they have to monetize the new tab page, which honestly is not going

351
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:58,800
to reflect well when people compare these browsers now.

352
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:04,020
So look at all of the free browsers on the market, and Firefox will be known as the one

353
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:06,360
with built-in ads, I worry.

354
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:10,000
And it seems like that could do more damage to their brand, especially since they try

355
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:16,600
to have a pro-consumer, pro-privacy, non-tracking support brand.

356
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:19,000
It's like kind of a conflict with that.

357
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:23,080
So it's a really tricky spot for them, but I also understand and appreciate this position

358
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:24,080
they're in.

359
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:25,760
They need to make money somehow.

360
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:27,580
What else can they do?

361
00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:32,600
They've tried with services, and that doesn't seem to be going brilliantly so far.

362
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:38,140
And they still have the Google money coming in for now, but what else can they do apart

363
00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:40,080
from try stuff like this?

364
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:44,920
I do take your point that it's not a great look for people's first experience of the

365
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:49,880
browser, and it may make them think, well, I'm not using this, I'll just stick to Chrome,

366
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:51,840
thank you very much, or Edge or whatever.

367
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:57,540
But I just don't see a clear alternative path to revenue for them, unless they just become

368
00:20:57,540 --> 00:21:01,280
super niche and start charging people to use it.

369
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:04,440
But that doesn't seem sustainable, because people don't want to pay for a browser.

370
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:05,880
I completely agree.

371
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:08,440
It's really an unfortunate position.

372
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:13,320
It's really telling, Joe, that in 2020 and 2019, where we have seen so many independent

373
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:18,500
development shops and other places switch over to subscription revenue versus one-time

374
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:22,480
sale or advertisements, that Mozilla couldn't execute on that.

375
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:27,700
And I don't really understand why, because it seems like they were in a unique position

376
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:28,700
to do this.

377
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:32,760
But now we're at the point we are at, and this is what's left.

378
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:38,280
I think I trust Mozilla to manage the privacy aspect of these new tab ads.

379
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:43,600
And if there was some appreciable way to support Mozilla by me opening a new tab, maybe that

380
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:44,600
is worth it.

381
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:48,680
Maybe I would leave it on, especially if this was big enough that one day they could stop

382
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:52,120
soliciting Google for money.

383
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:53,800
I guess that would be a small price to pay.

384
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:57,760
I don't really ever foresee me clicking on anything they advertise in there, because

385
00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:00,760
quite simply, I'm opening a new tab to get something else done.

386
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:04,240
And I'm not looking for an advertisement to click.

387
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:09,480
But if my page view helped support Mozilla and kept Firefox alive, I think I would leave

388
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:10,480
it on.

389
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:11,800
I think I would do it.

390
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:13,280
And so let me put that question to you.

391
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:17,560
If you could somehow get some confirmation that having these ads in Firefox meant that

392
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:22,080
it stayed around and they made revenue and your browser of choice survived, would you

393
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:23,560
consider turning them back on?

394
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:25,040
Yeah, I think I would.

395
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:31,540
If I was confident that they were general ads and not targeted specifically at me based

396
00:22:31,540 --> 00:22:34,600
on data that had been mined, then yeah.

397
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:40,560
If I knew that it was going to mean that Firefox would stay around and we wouldn't slip into

398
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:47,120
a monoculture for browser engines, then yeah, I think I would do that.

399
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:49,200
Linode.com slash LAN.

400
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:52,720
Go there, get a $100 60-day credit on a new account.

401
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:56,240
Linode provides virtual servers that make it easy and affordable to host anything in

402
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:57,240
the cloud.

403
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:59,640
Linode's dedicated to offering the best virtualized cloud computing.

404
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:01,940
If it runs on Linux, it runs on Linode.

405
00:23:01,940 --> 00:23:07,000
And every plan comes with their amazing human-powered support 24-7, 365.

406
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:11,280
I use Linode for a game server I recently set up for my kids, but also it runs the backend

407
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:13,360
infrastructure for Jupyter broadcasting.

408
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:16,000

412
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:31,480
If you want to train, you want to support, you want to host, they've got something for

413
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:32,480
you.

414
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:36,020
With dedicated CPU, GPU, or even just $5 a month shared plans, you'll find something

415
00:23:36,020 --> 00:23:38,180
and that $100 will take you far.

416
00:23:38,180 --> 00:23:43,720
Go check out my hosting provider, linode.com slash LAN.

417
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:48,000
Coinbase has been in the news recently when CEO Brian Armstrong announced it was going

418
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,960
to be a quote, mission-focused company.

419
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:55,600
He writes on their blog, in short, I want Coinbase to be laser-focused on achieving

420
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:59,880
its mission because I believe that this is the way we can have the biggest impact on

421
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:00,880
the world.

422
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:05,520
We will do this by playing as a championship team, focused on building and being transparent

423
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:08,720
about what our mission is and isn't.

424
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:15,640
And 2020 has had no lack of things for companies to comment on from wildfires to the political

425
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:18,880
events we're currently living through the middle of and a pandemic.

426
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:22,800
And you've seen different companies kind of line up differently around this issue.

427
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:28,500
And in a way here, Joe, I think you see Coinbase as a bit of an experiment saying, we're going

428
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:32,920
to stick to the core mission and not really comment on things outside of that.

429
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:38,920
Yeah, they're not going to have any sort of political agenda beyond pushing cryptocurrencies,

430
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:43,080
which is somewhat political in and of itself, but they're not going to get involved in anything

431
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:44,080
else political.

432
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:47,460
They're going to be apolitical as an organization.

433
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:54,340
And what Brian has said to his staff is, if you don't like that, then you can leave.

434
00:24:54,340 --> 00:25:00,200
And so last week when this came up, he gave his staff the option of a pretty generous

435
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:06,100
redundancy package, essentially, if they wanted to leave, if they didn't agree with this apolitical

436
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:07,580
direction.

437
00:25:07,580 --> 00:25:13,360
And a fair number of them did take that, around about 5% of the company.

438
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:17,900
And the people who are left either agree with him or are too scared of looking for another

439
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:20,880
job in the middle of a global pandemic.

440
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:25,360
This is a tricky line to walk because as you touched on there, crypto, especially right

441
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:31,800
now as it's gaining relevancy, is inherently political, and this is the crack that usually

442
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:36,020
opens the door fully into companies experimenting on politics.

443
00:25:36,020 --> 00:25:41,360
And also I'll note, it's one thing for a couple hundred employee company to make this statement

444
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:43,840
about what they're going to say or focus on.

445
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:48,040
It's an entirely other thing for a trillion dollar company to make those statements, right?

446
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:50,000
And so there's that too to deal with.

447
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,460
They're a small business still, they're really a startup.

448
00:25:52,460 --> 00:25:57,080
But as a small business owner myself, I kind of see the logic in it because there's enough

449
00:25:57,080 --> 00:25:59,480
to do just focusing on the core job.

450
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:05,560
And I refer back to our year plus coverage of Mozilla's decline, where they just recently

451
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:10,640
announced an initiative that has nothing to do with Firefox and the web browser market.

452
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:15,720
And they're investing significantly into that effort to the tunes of multiple millions.

453
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:18,120
There's no direct return for Firefox.

454
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:22,440
There's not even a direct return for improving the web or keeping things standard compliant.

455
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:24,260
They've gotten that abstract now.

456
00:26:24,260 --> 00:26:28,560
And so I sort of see Mozilla on the other end of the spectrum for where Coinbase is,

457
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:31,720
where they're heavily involved, so much so that they've deviated from their core mission.

458
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:36,320
Well, that is arguable because the whole free software open source movement is somewhat

459
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:37,820
political.

460
00:26:37,820 --> 00:26:43,480
And Mozilla has always tried to push for open standards and open web.

461
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:46,440
And that is kind of political as well, right?

462
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:51,160
That's the crack I'm talking about that opens the door just like crypto is just is inherently

463
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:56,080
political and once you make that compromise, it goes from there.

464
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:57,080
I think they're doomed.

465
00:26:57,080 --> 00:27:00,200
I mean, it's a good position today, Joe, but it's inevitable.

466
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:03,240
Whereas the Coinbase CEO saying, no, we're not going to have any of that.

467
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:07,240
We're going to just stay focused on the key business that we engage in and we're not going

468
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:13,600
to be distracted and get bogged down in political issues because there's no denying it.

469
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:16,160
We live in a very polarized world.

470
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:20,400
And if you take a stance on something, the chances are you're going to alienate roughly

471
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:24,760
half the people who you're trying to do business with.

472
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:27,160
And I am guilty of this.

473
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:30,720
My show, Late Night Night, we actually talked about this, about whether companies should

474
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:31,720
do it.

475
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:39,580
And we admitted that as just a podcast, have taken very political stances on certain issues.

476
00:27:39,580 --> 00:27:44,200
And that has probably been detrimental to the number of listeners that we've got.

477
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:49,000
We must have turned a lot of people off who were on the other side of the fence.

478
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:55,440
So I understand how and why companies get into this position, but you do look at Mozilla

479
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:58,980
and think that they have gone way off piste.

480
00:27:58,980 --> 00:28:04,400
Whether or not you think what they're doing is good is irrelevant because what they're

481
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:10,200
doing isn't relevant to the core product that they should be concentrating on, which is

482
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:11,200
the browser.

483
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:16,000
And I was going to put my analyst hat on here and look at this from a strategic standpoint.

484
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:21,720
What Brian Armstrong has done here is he's thinned the herd a little bit without any

485
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:24,120
kind of dramatic layoffs having to happen.

486
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:29,160
He gave everybody a very generous package, but he's also sent a signal to quote unquote

487
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:33,600
crypto investors saying, this is an island of stability.

488
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:37,620
We're not going to let the craze of 2020 disrupt your money.

489
00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:42,880
And I think at the end of the day, Armstrong is attempting to position Coinbase as a bank.

490
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:45,160
They want us to think of it as a bank.

491
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:49,160
And there's certain above the fray aspects of a bank.

492
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:50,160
You know what I mean?

493
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:52,680
Like they're kind of above the political fray in a sense.

494
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:56,980
And I think Coinbase wants to build a culture of that to essentially skate to where the

495
00:28:56,980 --> 00:28:57,980
puck's going.

496
00:28:57,980 --> 00:29:01,960
It's a very strategic, it's a very strategic thing, but it additionally, it's letting people

497
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:06,680
who are maybe aren't as jazzed and motivated about the core, core aspect of the company

498
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:10,240
and instead are maybe more motivated about other aspirational things.

499
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:13,100
They can move on to a job that's a better fit for them.

500
00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:15,280
And I think it's kind of a win-win in that way.

501
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:19,480
Well that might be true, but the likes of Jack Dorsey, the Twitter CEO, don't agree

502
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:20,680
with that.

503
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:27,600
He and some others have criticized Armstrong for this position quite strongly in fact.

504
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:31,800
Well it is kind of an anti-mainstream line of thinking, but I think when you look at

505
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:36,440
it in the lens of a bank operation versus a social media publishing platform, it's pretty

506
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:39,640
clear why the two companies would take different stances.

507
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:44,000
But Dorsey's coming at it from a communications platform standpoint.

508
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,000
Think about that.

509
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,100
A communications platform.

510
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:53,200
And Armstrong's coming at it from a bank savings investing side, right?

511
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:55,840
These are two very different outlooks on these businesses.

512
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:57,440
These are two very different philosophies.

513
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:58,600
Yeah, that's true.

514
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:03,960
There is a bank in the UK called the Co-operative Bank, which does get somewhat political and

515
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:06,420
say that they only invest in ethical stuff.

516
00:30:06,420 --> 00:30:11,000
But then when you dig into it, they say stuff like, we won't provide banking services to

517
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:17,320
any business organization or government that manufactures indiscriminate weapons, e.g.

518
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:19,180
cluster bombs and stuff.

519
00:30:19,180 --> 00:30:23,860
But they don't mention anything about companies that manufacture a regular weapon.

520
00:30:23,860 --> 00:30:25,600
So weapons are okay, just not mines.

521
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:29,840
Yeah, like cluster bombs, mines, uranium, you know, stuff like that.

522
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:30,840
No, the bad stuff.

523
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:31,840
Just the good weapons.

524
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:32,840
Yeah.

525
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:36,680
So there are some examples of banks, but yeah, I know what you mean, generally speaking,

526
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:42,200
banks are pretty apolitical, so it does seem like a reasonable direction for Coinbase to

527
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:43,200
go in.

528
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:46,820
Yeah, it just shows you the state of 2020, though, because even making that statement

529
00:30:46,820 --> 00:30:47,980
is controversial.

530
00:30:47,980 --> 00:30:52,380
Saying that you're going to just take an even-keeled focused approach is a controversial thing

531
00:30:52,380 --> 00:30:53,380
to say.

532
00:30:53,380 --> 00:30:54,380
Yeah.

533
00:30:54,380 --> 00:30:58,140
And thinking about Mozilla, I don't think they could do anything like this.

534
00:30:58,140 --> 00:31:00,240
They just wouldn't get away with it, would they?

535
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:01,980
They have to be political now.

536
00:31:01,980 --> 00:31:07,920
They've set their stall out that they are political in various ways, and you either

537
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:08,920
like it or you don't.

538
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:12,640
Well, like I always say, and you guys know it, we'll keep an eye on this and everything

539
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:14,580
else going on in the world of Linux.
