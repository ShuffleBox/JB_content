00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,860
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, episode 227, recorded on February 9th, 2022.

2
00:00:09,860 --> 00:00:10,860
I'm Chris.

3
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:11,860
And I'm Wes.

4
00:00:11,860 --> 00:00:12,860
Hello, Wes.

5
00:00:12,860 --> 00:00:15,000
Let's do the news.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,320
And we start this week with the industry's biggest story.

7
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:26,580
That is, the collapse of the $66 billion sale of SoftBank's ARM business to NVIDIA.

8
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:31,740
The deal fell through after regulators around the world raised some serious concerns about

9
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:35,900
the effects on competition in the semiconductor industry.

10
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:37,840
Don't feel too bad for SoftBank, though.

11
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:43,600
They're going to receive a $1.25 billion breakup fee.

12
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:48,640
They also still appear to have some plans to perhaps take ARM public.

13
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:51,320
And there's some management upheaval in work.

14
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:54,920
So I'm sure we'll see some stories about that as well.

15
00:00:54,920 --> 00:01:00,820
It seems a lot of people had concerns about this merger, as ARM was kind of viewed as

16
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:06,840
the Switzerland of the semiconductor industry, if you will, meaning that they dealt pretty

17
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:12,840
evenly with all of their 500 plus license holders, regardless of country or company.

18
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:18,440
I think a quote from Greg Rowe, head of research at Hyundai Motor Securities, really emphasizes

19
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:23,840
this with him saying, quote, there's a chip war going on around the world.

20
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:30,360
So many weren't very welcoming of such a key architecture firm going to the US.

21
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:35,380
Countries are competitively trying to build up their chip industries and will try to defend

22
00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:41,500
against that chip technology moving to another country.

23
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:46,240
Well as the Steam Deck gets closer, we're watching the last minute developments closely.

24
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:50,160
And Ferronix has the details on a new deck driver that's landed for the Linux kernel.

25
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:55,440
It was posted last weekend and it's really a kitchen sink platform driver that adds support

26
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:58,360
for the Steam Deck specific embedded controller in there.

27
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:05,440
A controller is responsible for a whole swath of things like CPU fan control, battery temperature

28
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:11,460
measurements, display related settings, even USB-C event notifications.

29
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:16,520
As you might expect, this driver was developed by engineers over at Valve and specifically

30
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:23,800
Andrey Smirnov, who's an engineer hired back in 2018 to work specifically on kernel projects

31
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:24,800
for Valve.

32
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:27,760
So it's interesting seeing that hire pay some dues here.

33
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:33,080
Now given the timing of this patch, it's not expected to be merged until sometime in the

34
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:38,560
Linux 5.18 cycle, which doesn't kick off until late March.

35
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:43,200
But it's not actually critical functionality if you want to play around and use other Linux

36
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,660
distributions on the deck.

37
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:48,160
It's just nice to have.

38
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:53,600
And Valve's Arch Linux based Steam OS is expected to be relying on a patched kernel at least

39
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:55,040
initially.

40
00:02:55,040 --> 00:03:00,440
So all the functionality should work for early Steam Deck holders.

41
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:05,180
Regardless of all those details, honestly, it's just kind of nice to see Valve getting

42
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:09,600
maybe not quite ahead of the ball, but keeping up and working with upstream.

43
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:14,720
I mean, that's what we expect, right?

44
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:19,360
So this week, we saw the announcement of the Open Source Firmware Foundation.

45
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:23,560
They're getting set up with the hopes of expanding open source firmware usage throughout the

46
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:25,400
entire industry.

47
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:29,920
Their founding members are Nine Element Cyber Security and Molvad VPN.

48
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:32,440
Yeah, that last one's interesting.

49
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:36,240
But hey, I'm a fan of open firmware, that's for sure.

50
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:40,400
Now, obviously, this was just announced, so it's early days.

51
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:46,800
But if you head over to osfw.foundation, you'll find that, quote, the foundation sets its

52
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:53,640
goals to research and to educate corporations and individuals alike about open source firmware,

53
00:03:53,640 --> 00:04:00,480
through sharing intellectual resources, infrastructure, services, events, and training.

54
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:05,640
The OSFF is meant to be an umbrella organization for all parties interested in open source

55
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:11,280
firmware and acts as the first point of contact in the open source firmware ecosystem.

56
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:15,880
Yeah, so they're really about adoption throughout the industry, right?

57
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:19,360
Like, we don't see LVFS listed anywhere on here.

58
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:23,320
It's not necessarily about the software bits, it's more about getting the rest of the industry

59
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:25,720
to use open source firmware.

60
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:29,360
But if you like your foundations, well, I got good news for you.

61
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,920
Because FreeCAD also has a foundation.

62
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:37,280
That's right, the FreeCAD project has a legal nonprofit organization around it now, Long

63
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:39,240
Live FreeCAD.

64
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:46,200
Well, speaking of big organizations making big changes, Intel has announced that they're

65
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:52,200
joining the RISC-V international organization as a premier member.

66
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:58,620
And while they already have their RISC-V based Neos V processors, Intel isn't necessarily

67
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:05,200
planning anything as radical as replacing X86 with RISC-V in the short term.

68
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:11,240
But it is making this move to invest in the RISC-V ecosystem for the long term.

69
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:17,040
And of course, hopefully lure a few customers to the Intel Foundry services.

70
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:21,700
Yeah, those Foundry services is probably what this is really about, right?

71
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:26,160
But it seems like a pretty significant shift for them to double down on their investment

72
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,280
like this.

73
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:32,020
And in today's announcement, they also touch on funding some open source software development.

74
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:38,380
They write, quote, today Intel announced several immediate RISC-V community benefits led by

75
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:44,680
Intel's Foundry services or IFS for short, IFS will sponsor an open source software development

76
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:52,680
platform that allows for freedom and experimentation, including partners across the ecosystem, universities

77
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:53,840
and consortia.

78
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:57,960
So it seems that Intel is making a big push here.

79
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:03,080
Maybe one day we'll look at Intel as one of the premier manufacturers of RISC-V systems.

80
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:04,720
I don't know.

81
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:08,060
I'd love to see it.

82
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:13,080
If you haven't been paying attention lately, you might have missed a major new feature

83
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:20,080
that's in the works for ZFS and we happen to have an update for you this week.

84
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:27,660
We first mentioned RAID-Z expansion way back in June in Linux Action News 194, but since

85
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:33,740
then it seems that ZFS co-creator Matt Arends has been hard at work.

86
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:39,840
For those of you that might not have listened to episode 194, one major expensive pain point

87
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:47,200
of ZFS has always been its lack of support for expanding storage of an existing setup.

88
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:52,760
The unofficial answer has always kind of been that hey, ZFS was built to protect your data,

89
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:54,880
not do it on the cheap.

90
00:06:54,880 --> 00:07:00,600
RAID-Z expansion though would change all that by allowing disks to be added one at a time

91
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:06,640
to an existing RAID-Z VDEV, expanding its capacity incrementally.

92
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:11,600
Now that might be especially useful for those of you out there with small pools that only

93
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:17,000
have one VDEV, where maybe there isn't sufficient hardware to add capacity by adding a whole

94
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:24,240
new VDEV when you want to upgrade, which might involve doubling the number of disks.

95
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:28,320
That's something I know we've run into while trying to plan out studio builds and either

96
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:33,600
not having the disks at hand or not really having the storage capacity available.

97
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:38,880
But with the new patch you'll finally be able to attach new disks to an existing RAID-Z

98
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:41,320
VDEV.

99
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:46,360
Whether or not that's the way you want to go, that we leave up to you.

100
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:50,400
We've both been looking forward to this, and I saw that there was an update recently on

101
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:55,560
the FreeBSD Foundation website, so where are we at now with this upgrade?

102
00:07:55,560 --> 00:08:01,200
Yeah, we did get an update there this week, because well, they're a sponsor of this work,

103
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:03,600
which I'm very grateful for.

104
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:07,880
And I'm also grateful that it seems like things are going quite well.

105
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:13,400
All the planned capabilities have been implemented, and all the tests are passing.

106
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:18,360
Now there is still some code cleanup to do, verbose logging to remove, code documentation

107
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:20,920
to write, that sort of thing.

108
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:26,880
But even with those remaining tasks, the aim is to have this feature integrated sometime

109
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:27,880
in Q3.

110
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:34,280
If you're as excited as we are, we should also note that as with many open source projects,

111
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:43,840
the biggest need right now is for more help testing.

112
00:08:43,840 --> 00:09:06,640
I've always had an uneasy sense of the big three hyperscalers out there.

113
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:11,160
I don't like all of the reasons they're in the market, I don't like how they can leverage

114
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:15,880
their position to change things in the market, and I don't like their interfaces, and the

115
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:19,720
sense of lock-in that I get when I try to use those big hyperscalers.

116
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:24,480
And I'm not the only one, in fact devops.com just published this, 20% of developers out

117
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:28,600
there believe that the big three hyperscalers are going to engage in behaviors that will

118
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:31,760
leverage their brands that will stifle competition.

119
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:35,840
That doesn't feel good, I don't like the way that sits.

120
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:40,480
There's a lot of reasons to choose cloud providers out there, and there's a lot of cloud providers,

121
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:41,880
but none of them are like Linode.

122
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:46,600
They've been around for nearly 19 years, they're independently funded, they have 11 data centers

123
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:50,320
around the world, and they have a real simple product.

124
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:53,200
They get value out of trying to make it really good.

125
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:58,280
Their whole thing is just to make a great product, back it up with the best support

126
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:00,200
in the business.

127
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:06,320
They're not trying to leverage their whole industrial shipping side of their business

128
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:12,640
to push a cloud computing thing and subsidize it in this weird way that just isn't really

129
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:14,840
a genuine product, is it?

130
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:20,120
Now, I know every platform has its place, but I think Linode is one that's worth your

131
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:21,340
consideration.

132
00:10:21,340 --> 00:10:28,360
It's incredibly powerful, it has fantastic performance, and the pricing's 30 to 50% less

133
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:30,480
than some of the hyperscalers out there.

134
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:34,640
And if you're an individual that just wants to do a project, you want to run a blog, have

135
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:39,760
a gaming server, or maybe you're a small business, you want to do a little bit of collaboration,

136
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:43,180
I really personally believe there's nothing better than Linode.

137
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:51,720
So go try it out and get $100, you can really, truly kick the tires, linode.com slash lan.

138
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:54,880
And of course, linux.ting.com, a big thank you to Ting.

139
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,540
Hey, do you hear the phone ringing?

140
00:10:56,540 --> 00:11:00,120
It's Common Sense calling, and it's time to check out Ting.

141
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:04,200
Seriously, if you live in the States, you've got to go to linux.ting.com, go see how much

142
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:09,200
you could save, and then take $25 off that when you visit linux.ting.com.

143
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:12,040
You see, Ting is a mobile virtual network operator.

144
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:17,160
That means Ting customers get access to the big carrier networks, the nation to nation,

145
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:24,240
coast to coast LTE 5G networks, but you're dealing with Ting, a reasonable company that's

146
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:29,980
a reasonable size with great support, and no contracts, and there's really no other

147
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:31,560
way to say it.

148
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:36,360
Ting plans that just make sense, it is smarter mobile for sure.

149
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:40,080
That's why I've been a customer since 2013.

150
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:45,280
And every single Ting plan gets access to their award-winning customer service, nationwide

151
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:49,600
LTE and 5G, and no contract ever.

152
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:50,600
How great is that?

153
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:53,280
Plus, I think the other thing that's really nice is you could switch to Ting in an evening.

154
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:57,680
It's really simple, and because of their multi-network support, pretty much any phone's gonna work

155
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:00,320
on Ting, so you might not even have to get a new phone.

156
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:04,200
Head to linux.ting.com, take a look, they do offer phones directly, or you can bring

157
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:05,200
your own.

158
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:10,800
You put your phone info into their system, they'll tell you if it's compatible or not,

159
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:15,200
likely gonna be, and when it is, they'll send you a SIM card, you pop that in, within a

160
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:18,760
few minutes after you get the SIM and you get it in your phone, you're gonna be activated.

161
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:22,320
Their dashboard is super straightforward, really easy, you can get everything going

162
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:23,920
in minutes.

163
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:30,080
When I signed up for Ting back in 2013, I think I did it at like 10.30 at night, in

164
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:35,240
my home office, when everybody else was in bed, and I wouldn't have done it if I had

165
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:38,680
to talk to a human, I just wanted to get it done online that night, and I got everything

166
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:42,560
done online with Ting, I was really impressed, and then the couple of times where I got kind

167
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:47,040
of stuck, both times when I was on a road trip actually, the Ting customer support really

168
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,800
came through.

169
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:51,280
They won't leave you stranded, they'll really take care of you, it's pretty great.

170
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:55,760
So go to linux.ting.com, support the show, and take 25 bucks off what Ting's got to offer

171
00:12:55,760 --> 00:13:00,260
at linux.ting.com.

172
00:13:00,260 --> 00:13:07,560
This week, the KDE community released Plasma 5.24, a long-term support release that will

173
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:12,960
receive updates and bug fixes until the final version of Plasma 5.

174
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:18,000
It's been just a short four months since the previous release, 5.23, which came out in

175
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:24,120
October 2021, but that shorter time frame has not stopped the project from packing this

176
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:27,040
release full of goodies.

177
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:30,780
Right off the top, let's mention KRunner, which is definitely one of my favorite parts

178
00:13:30,780 --> 00:13:32,120
of the Plasma desktop.

179
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:37,840
Now, it's great and has plenty of updates in 5.24, but what really stood out to me is

180
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:43,880
a new feature that teaches you all the power that exists in KRunner, because now, you can

181
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:47,880
just click and explore the plugins that exist to get an idea of how you can actually use

182
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:48,960
them.

183
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:54,320
Also landing in 5.24 is support for fingerprint readers, well, assuming you've got all the

184
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:59,760
hardware enablement bits sorted out, now Plasma will play nicely too.

185
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:06,440
Discover has also gotten a bit smarter, especially around what packages it does, or crucially,

186
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:12,920
does not let you uninstall, hopefully preventing folks who don't quite know what they're doing

187
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:16,780
from breaking their system.

188
00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:21,360
Also nice to see in Discover, while it has supported Flatpaks for a long time, that support

189
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:24,000
is improving in 5.24.

190
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:28,360
You can now install locally downloaded Flatpak packages, and Discover will figure things

191
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:34,040
out and sync up the backend repositories for those Flatpaks automatically.

192
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:35,160
That is nice to see.

193
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:39,400
A lot of feature improvements or tweaks are in that category of nice to see.

194
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:43,720
So many that we really couldn't touch on all of them, but I did want to touch on a couple

195
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:47,800
of the visual improvements, because these are equally as impressive.

196
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:52,540
To give you a couple of examples here, they've tweaked the way Plasma notifications look

197
00:14:52,540 --> 00:14:54,120
now.

198
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:58,120
Critical notifications stand out with an orange strip on the side of them to visually

199
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:02,080
distinguish them from like a less urgent message.

200
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:03,080
Love that.

201
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:08,560
The breeze theme, always looking good, but looking absolutely great now with some nice

202
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:09,640
refinements.

203
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:13,920
You can now select custom accent colors, and it just looks great throughout.

204
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:17,240
They've implemented the free desktop spec for dark mode.

205
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:22,200
So if you have a third party application that also follows that spec, and you use dark mode,

206
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:24,280
everything's going to look great.

207
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:28,520
Widgets have received some nice new features, like how they get deployed and all of that.

208
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:31,760
And there's been some cleanup on how you navigate all of them.

209
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:38,680
On the desktop side of things, there is a nice new wallpaper in Plasma 5.24, but if

210
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:42,720
you happen to prefer something else, you can now set your wallpaper pretty easily just

211
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:48,120
by right clicking on any picture in Dolphin and hitting set as wallpaper.

212
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:52,860
Or if you want to get a little more creative, you can use the picture of the day wallpaper

213
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:58,800
plugin, which can now pull images from Simon Stollenhug's gallery, which you may recognize

214
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:04,160
as a whole bunch of cool and a little bit creepy sci-fi images as seen in Tales from

215
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:05,160
the Loop.

216
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:10,680
Another small, but I think important visual enhancement this time around is that video

217
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:16,120
notifications, that is notifications about video files, well, they now display a thumbnail

218
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:21,240
of the actual video, just like you'd expect for image files.

219
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:26,280
And just because maybe we have to a little bit about Wayland, the Wayland journey for

220
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:32,000
Plasma is definitely a long one, but the march continues.

221
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:36,240
This time around, something that stood out to me is that Spectacle, the KDE Screenshot

222
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:42,000
tool, well, it finally has access to that active window mode that's been missing.

223
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:46,240
And they're making good progress on catching up the keyboard shortcuts that only work in

224
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:50,920
X11 and getting those gradually implemented on the Wayland side.

225
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:56,020
The project obviously put a lot of care in making sure this was a really nice LTS release,

226
00:16:56,020 --> 00:17:00,560
but something that didn't really get listed in any of the features, but I absolutely noticed

227
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:06,800
right away is this release has definitely felt faster in terms of performance on my

228
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:10,240
machine than the last few releases.

229
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:14,880
Like I feel like I kind of got an upgraded computer with this release, and I know I touched

230
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:21,680
on it earlier, but the breeze theme is so dang good now that I keep the default theme

231
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:23,680
with Plasma.

232
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:30,200
Like you go back like maybe a year and a half, and the first thing I was doing on a new Plasma

233
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:34,800
desktop was tweaking the theme and the way it looks and spending a couple of hours getting

234
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:36,080
that right.

235
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:38,760
And now, now I'm using the defaults.

236
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:42,820
It feels like the team has just put a ton of work into that kind of stuff.

237
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:46,600
And so all in all, this just feels like a release that is absolutely worth checking

238
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:47,600
out.

239
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:52,080
It is available via Plasma Neon right now, that's how I tried it out earlier, and it'll

240
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:54,620
be coming to a distro near you soon.

241
00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:57,560
