00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,420
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News.

2
00:00:05,420 --> 00:00:09,280
Episode 138, recorded on December 20th, 2019.

3
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:10,280
I'm Chris.

4
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:11,280
And I'm Joe.

5
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:12,280
Hello, Joe.

6
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:17,100
It's one of our final episodes of the year, and it is our annual look back at the major

7
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:23,800
stories of 2019, and there was a trend that just bubbled up all year long.

8
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:29,360
And that was big commercial cloud versus free software projects.

9
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:36,040
We saw various approaches to this by the open source projects, changing licenses, and various

10
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:43,320
attempts to essentially stop AWS and the other clouds to a lesser extent from taking that

11
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:49,800
open source software, selling it as a service, and not contributing back to the original

12
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:50,800
project.

13
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:55,420
What we have been witnessing and likely will continue to witness for some time is a conflict

14
00:00:55,420 --> 00:00:59,840
between the letter of the license and the spirit of the license.

15
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:05,480
And the open source projects kept making adjustments to try to make the two line up a little bit

16
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:06,480
more.

17
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:08,760
But each adjustment comes with a reaction.

18
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:15,080
Well, reactions like removing MongoDB from quite a few distributions, because they changed

19
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:20,600
to the server side public license, which was almost an open source license, but not an

20
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:23,000
OSI approved open source license.

21
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,720
There were some caveats in it, which meant that it couldn't be in distributions like

22
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:29,280
Debian and Fedora.

23
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:30,480
That really caught our attention.

24
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:37,320
The other one was Chef going 100% open source, and the extremely elaborate rationale they

25
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:38,960
posted in doing so.

26
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:43,800
Yeah, and we also saw it with Redis, with the company Redis Labs changing the license

27
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:46,640
so that some of the modules were proprietary.

28
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:51,040
And we actually saw Debian developers forking those bits of software to keep them going.

29
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:53,400
Yeah, that was absolutely a standout moment.

30
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:58,160
It really feels like this is going to come to a head in 2020, because these companies

31
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:02,840
just don't really have a business model, the open source companies anymore, thanks to the

32
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:05,080
likes of AWS.

33
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:07,400
And so something is going to have to change here.

34
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:10,360
Yeah, the business model, they'll have to find a new one.

35
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:12,560
And I think that's what they're exploring.

36
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,200
It's not impossible.

37
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:18,400
And I won't say anything yet, because this isn't our predictions episode.

38
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:22,600
But there are adjustments Amazon could make on their end, so they're not poisoning the

39
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:23,600
well.

40
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:28,080
Let's be honest here, these open source projects are making them a ton of money.

41
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:31,360
There's some best interests at play here, they just have an opportunity they haven't

42
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,360
recognized yet.

43
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:38,380
Well, I hope you're right, I really hope that Amazon starts contributing to these projects.

44
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:41,680
Even just a little bit of money would probably put this problem to bed, but I suppose we'll

45
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:42,680
see.

46
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:47,680
Meanwhile, one of the other tech giants, Google, has had a lot going on this year.

47
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:50,840
There's so many areas when it comes to Google we could talk about.

48
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:54,260
We just recently discussed Flutter and Fuchsia.

49
00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:58,220
Of course, Android is a major area of discussion.

50
00:02:58,220 --> 00:03:02,400
But the one that's on my mind, and it's just the timing of release, and also because I

51
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:07,880
was playing Stadia right before we started recording, but Stadia, Stadia is on the tip

52
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:08,880
of my mind.

53
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:09,880
And where's that going?

54
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:14,400
It's the most unknown aspect of Google, I think, in the future.

55
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:19,040
And it was sort of the crazy thing I didn't really see coming from them either.

56
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:24,120
And they actually did launch it in 2019, which I also was a little skeptical of.

57
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:28,040
So just kind of question marks all over the place with Stadia.

58
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:30,000
Yeah, they just about launched it.

59
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,720
It got pretty poor reviews, although it seems to be improving now as we get towards the

60
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:36,080
end of the year.

61
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:38,640
And you've had a pretty good experience with your gaming, haven't you?

62
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,840
Yeah, I really don't mind it.

63
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:44,640
I got the founder's thing, so I have the controller, and it has to be wired in when I'm on the

64
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:45,640
desktop.

65
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:50,720
But just before we started, I decided to pull the trigger, and I got Red Dead Redemption.

66
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:57,640
And the experience is really nice, because after the transaction is complete, you can

67
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:58,760
immediately play.

68
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:01,480
No 20-gigabyte game to download.

69
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:03,680
And no doubt you got it for a bargain price as well.

70
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:08,960
Well, I mean, it was like $50, which that's the tricky thing with Stadia.

71
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:11,180
That's part of why it's such an unknown.

72
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:13,880
What are they going to do if they shut this thing down and people have put several hundred

73
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:16,880
dollars or more into games on this platform?

74
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:17,880
What are they going to do?

75
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:20,040
Are they going to get each game maker to refund them?

76
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:23,560
I don't think so, because I think it's the game makers that are setting the price.

77
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:26,800
If Google had their way, I don't think it'd be 60 bucks for a game.

78
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:27,800
Well, we'll see.

79
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:31,700
I remain very skeptical about how widely this is going to be adopted and whether Google's

80
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:35,520
going to kill it, but I think it'll probably make it through 2020.

81
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,320
We'll have to see.

82
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:39,040
Android had a pretty strong year.

83
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:42,120
Well, it did, but it was also a bit up and down.

84
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:49,280
The antitrust suit that's happening in Europe was somewhat resolved, with Google being forced

85
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:53,200
into giving people a choice of what browser they run on Android.

86
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,200
Right.

87
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:58,720
But at the same time, we got Android 10, and we started to see some of the fruits of Project

88
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:05,120
Treble pay off with several notable high-end devices shipping with Android 10 on day one

89
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:06,120
of the release.

90
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:09,200
Yeah, I was quite surprised about that at the time, but I'm really hoping we're going

91
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:14,680
to see more and more of that as we go into next year and when Android 11 comes out.

92
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:18,320
Google has been trying to do that a lot more with things like Project Mainline, but don't

93
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:22,120
confuse the name Project Mainline with a mainline kernel, which is something Google has been

94
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:25,760
thinking about this year, but it feels a long way off.

95
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:29,180
Yeah, that ironically might be one of their most pie-in-the-sky things they've talked

96
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:30,180
about recently.

97
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:32,240
Maybe more pie in the sky than Stadia.

98
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,240
Yeah.

99
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:37,080
It's really a bit of a dichotomy, because look at Chromebooks.

100
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:42,600
All new Chromebooks got Linux apps, and there was even a whole range of Chromebooks that

101
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:45,500
just were gifted an extra year of support.

102
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:49,160
Really solid Android year, solid Chromebook year.

103
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:51,680
Google services, really reliable.

104
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:54,640
At the same time, they didn't take over the world.

105
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:56,360
There's still plenty of good alternatives.

106
00:05:56,360 --> 00:06:00,680
In fact, I would argue there's more alternatives to Google services than ever, and they're

107
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:02,520
better than ever.

108
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:07,880
I thought at this time last year, we would be even more entrenched into Google.

109
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:10,440
We would be even more locked in.

110
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:12,360
I do not feel like that's the case.

111
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:14,800
I have lots of options at the end of 2019.

112
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,560
Google had a great year, but it didn't mean I had to have a bad year.

113
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:22,840
Well, towards the end of the year, we saw a clear sign that Chromebooks are very likely

114
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:26,040
to support FWAPD and the LVFS project.

115
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:28,360
Joe, it's really been the year of LVFS.

116
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:34,280
See, remember in August of 2018, Lenovo joined, and that was like a, whoa, whoa, everybody

117
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:35,280
wake up.

118
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:36,280
What's going on here?

119
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:44,360
But since then, Phoenix, the BIOS maker joined, HP joined, tons of companies and smaller manufacturers

120
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:49,520
that create appliances that we don't talk about as often also have been joining.

121
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:55,340
It's seen so much growth that I almost worry about the sustainability of the project if

122
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:57,320
it grows anymore.

123
00:06:57,320 --> 00:07:01,140
We have seen them join the Linux Foundation as well, so perhaps some support could come

124
00:07:01,140 --> 00:07:02,640
from there in 2020.

125
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:08,600
I hope so, because as we've seen more companies get involved with this and more and more devices

126
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:14,080
being supported, it feels like there needs to be a bit more organization there, a bit

127
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:19,600
more admin, because just there is more admin being created just from the sheer number of

128
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:20,600
moving parts.

129
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:24,900
I've said it before, but I just really think it's a very vital project.

130
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:27,960
And here's an interesting way to look at it.

131
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:32,480
Imagine if we didn't have LVFS and somebody came to you and said, how do you do firmware

132
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:33,620
updates in Linux?

133
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:40,540
And our answer still was, well, you can reboot into Windows or sometimes free DOS or every

134
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:43,680
now and then a vendor puts a recovery environment that you can load into.

135
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:46,100
And some BIOSes, you can just do it now.

136
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:48,440
There's like a little updater in there and you just put a little thumb drive in there

137
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:50,600
and you go in there and you select this, my BIOS?

138
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:51,600
What's my BIOS?

139
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:55,080
It's that menu you go into in your system posts.

140
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:56,080
What's a post?

141
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:57,720
Can you imagine this conversation?

142
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:02,160
And with LVFS, it's, yeah, you'll just get an update notification if you're using an

143
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,160
XYZ desktop.

144
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:05,680
And it's just right there automatically.

145
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:10,360
It's one of those, you can't believe we wouldn't have something like this kind of features

146
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:11,360
now.

147
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:16,000
So I'd really love to see it just get completely solid, get backing from everybody.

148
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
I'd love to see Huzy get a whole staff, give him a staff.

149
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
You know what?

150
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,760
I'll give him a million bucks.

151
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:26,000
I mean, you know, now that I'm writing IBM's checks.

152
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,960
Well, you have to wonder how much money Microsoft has been spending on open source this year.

153
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:33,800
I would imagine a little bit more than a million dollars.

154
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:34,800
Oh, Microsoft.

155
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:38,280
I bet we just triggered some people in the audience.

156
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:40,040
Here we are.

157
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:44,000
And people are still struggling how to understand Microsoft.

158
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,880
But we have witnessed a transformation of a company.

159
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:53,440
I don't think that for a minute, Microsoft is in free software for the morality or ideals

160
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:54,440
of it.

161
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:59,000
I think they figured out how to monetize a business around development for the web and

162
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,840
other services using open source.

163
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:05,420
And as a result, we've benefited from it.

164
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:09,220
And nothing could be a clear signal of that.

165
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:15,080
Nothing could be more of a lightning rod to indicate their commitment than when they open

166
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:16,740
sourced Windows calculator.

167
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:19,400
It was a real watershed moment, wasn't it?

168
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:20,400
Watershed, Joe.

169
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:28,680
It shifted the industry, really moved the needle, and disrupted everything we know about

170
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:29,680
open source.

171
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:32,560
Yeah, especially open source calculators.

172
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:33,560
Yeah.

173
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:36,200
Actually, though, you know, at the same time, didn't see it coming.

174
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:39,240
It was actually legitimately surprising and adorable.

175
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:46,200
Yeah, we very quickly saw some pull requests improving it, which is quite something.

176
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:55,960
For me, it was announcing WSL 2, and the Windows Terminal, and even releasing Edge, the new

177
00:09:55,960 --> 00:10:00,280
browser for Linux, which hasn't happened yet, but has been announced.

178
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:07,040
And Teams, and Teams, which they've billed as the first Office 365 app coming to Linux.

179
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:11,400
And I've tried to reserve judgment on a lot of this, especially with my background with

180
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:14,000
Microsoft.

181
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,980
But I've talked to more and more developers that are working with Microsoft in some capacity

182
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:25,900
or another, and they consistently tell me that Microsoft is responsive, and listens,

183
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:31,400
and replies to their emails, and answers their questions, and cooperates.

184
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:37,240
Which is really all you can ask for from an open source participant.

185
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:41,480
If a company is going to participate in open source, it kind of matters that they respond

186
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:42,480
to pull requests.

187
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,760
It kind of matters that they answer your questions.

188
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:47,640
And these developers are telling me they're doing that.

189
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:53,000
So you can still sit here, and you can wonder why, and you can question their morals, and

190
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:57,560
you can even label us as idiots for even talking about Microsoft in even the slightest positive

191
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:58,560
tone.

192
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:02,280
But at the end of the day, it's clear they're motivated to make this work.

193
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:03,640
Will it always be this way?

194
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:04,640
Who knows?

195
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:06,040
But is it this way today?

196
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:07,040
Yes.

197
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:09,920
Is it likely to be this way for the foreseeable future?

198
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:11,080
I think so.

199
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:15,280
But do you think that the history and the members of the community who still remember

200
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:19,240
that history strongly are going to be a problem for them?

201
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:23,160
Because as you said, every time we talk about Microsoft, if we're not incredibly negative

202
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:26,180
about them, we get a lot of backlash.

203
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:27,600
And you see it.

204
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,440
It's not just us talking about it.

205
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:35,560
Everywhere they're mentioned, there's a certain portion of the community who just will never

206
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:38,780
forgive them for the things that they've done in the past.

207
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:43,520
But do you think that they're not really interested in that segment of the community, and they're

208
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:50,120
just forging ahead and getting new developers and new people into open source and driving

209
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:51,800
them towards Azure?

210
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:53,200
Seems like that's it, huh?

211
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:58,720
I think they see the market potential ahead of them for people that are developing services

212
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:00,680
for the cloud.

213
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:05,720
And it's a ginormous field for decades to come.

214
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:11,280
So if a few folks from the 90s can't get over the fact that they won the desktop, which

215
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:15,760
– raising my hand right here, I was one of them – I think Microsoft will be okay

216
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:16,760
with that.

217
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:20,160
Well, just to appease the people who will be annoyed at us talking about them, I did

218
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:22,720
put M$ sign in the document that we're looking at.

219
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:23,720
You totally did!

220
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:25,760
And I wasn't going to out you, either.

221
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:30,000
I thought that was just going to be our private little joke, because both of us usually kind

222
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,160
of roll our eyes when we see that, but yet when we do it, it's funny.

223
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:36,680
Exactly.

224
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:42,960
Well the company who Microsoft has been pretty cozy with over the last year or so is Canonical.

225
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:44,760
And they've had a pretty good year.

226
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:45,760
Seems so.

227
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:46,760
It seems so.

228
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:50,200
And that coziness actually seems like it's ramped up a little bit, too, as they each

229
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:52,880
find business opportunities to do so.

230
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:56,180
But Canonical themselves had a strong year.

231
00:12:56,180 --> 00:12:59,920
Really good releases and some good partnerships.

232
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:04,060
And they've pushed the edge in a few areas with the 1910 release, which I think a lot

233
00:13:04,060 --> 00:13:05,560
of us can appreciate.

234
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:08,560
But even that 1904 release was really solid.

235
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:11,400
If only so you had the excuse to play your disco duck song.

236
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:15,160
Yeah, I did love that disco duck opportunity.

237
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:16,760
Once in a lifetime, that one.

238
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:22,400
Yeah, it's funny, this was the beginning, or maybe midway point, of a narrative about

239
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:24,640
GNOME Shell.

240
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:30,020
Memory enhancements, CPU optimization, animation tweaks that make it faster, all of these things

241
00:13:30,020 --> 00:13:35,120
were combining to make it a great desktop experience, which turned out to be even more

242
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,400
so in 1910.

243
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:40,760
But that's where we really saw a lot of these land initially was in disco dingo, as well

244
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:48,920
as support for the option to install NVIDIA graphics at installation time, which was nice

245
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:50,340
for some of us.

246
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:51,340
It wasn't all good, though.

247
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:57,680
There was a bit of a controversy over the 32 bit x86 packages, which happened over a

248
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:59,440
weekend if I recall correctly.

249
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:05,280
Oh, yes, the apocalypse of 32 bit support, right.

250
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:09,440
And remember how that Valve developer took to Twitter and got super upset and said, Oh,

251
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:11,600
I'm not making Steam for Ubuntu anymore.

252
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:17,120
Yeah, because at first, Canonical said they were going to completely drop i386 support.

253
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:20,800
But then after the backlash, they kind of backed down on it.

254
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:25,680
And now they're saying that they're going to support a few key libraries and binaries

255
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:28,920
to make things like Wine and Steam work.

256
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:33,960
Interestingly enough, after this compromise decision was made, even in the last week or

257
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:39,600
so, there has been increased conversation upstream in the kernel and other packages

258
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:42,080
about 32 bit support.

259
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:44,000
Because here's the situation.

260
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,480
And this is not from me.

261
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:46,480
This is from these developers.

262
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:52,620
Of course, I'm kind of summarizing, but my interpretation of it is they can make these

263
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:58,640
things build for 32 bit, but people are not fixing people are not patching and people

264
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:04,120
are not testing if they are getting fixed and patched at all for a lot of 32 bit code.

265
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:10,440
So now outside of the Ubuntu project, there is more and more pressure building on maintaining

266
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:13,840
32 bit and and making that call making that break.

267
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:17,040
Well, it's perfectly understandable why that pressure is growing.

268
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:22,720
I specifically put some 32 bit hardware to the test this year.

269
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:26,520
And honestly, it's just useless at this point.

270
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:31,720
There's I can't see any justification for using 32 bit x86 anymore.

271
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:32,720
Wow.

272
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:33,720
Wow.

273
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:36,640
I mean, if that's coming from XFC Joe.

274
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:39,720
Well, yeah, exactly.

275
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:46,760
Considering that you have these arm boards now, if you want something to run as a server,

276
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:52,440
that's relatively low power, it just doesn't make sense to use old 32 bit x86 anymore.

277
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:55,200
Yeah, there's likely a lot more testing on that arm code.

278
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:57,040
Oh, yeah, exactly.

279
00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:02,640
canonical also saw their director of engineering for the Ubuntu desktop will cook, step down,

280
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:07,200
and Martin Wimpress stepping into that position, as well as expanding it to include several

281
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,200
other areas.

282
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:12,280
I think that will really went out on a high with the Ubuntu 1910 release, he's very keen

283
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:14,160
to say that it's a team effort.

284
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:16,940
But that was a great interim release.

285
00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:21,600
And now impressed has got to deal with this 20 or four, which is a huge release for canonical,

286
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:26,340
no matter which way you look at it, it's going to be supported for 10 years.

287
00:16:26,340 --> 00:16:30,440
Him and his team have to get this right, which I'm sure they will because they're building

288
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:34,080
on 1904 and 1910, which were both solid.

289
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:36,240
So I've got full confidence in him.

290
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:43,600
And coming in just towards the very end of the year, Ubuntu Pro launched on the AWS marketplace.

291
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:48,120
And I mentioned this because wouldn't it be interesting in 2020 if this expanded into

292
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:50,680
other providers and maybe even on premises?

293
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:52,240
I think that's pretty likely.

294
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:56,280
I don't think that needs to go in the prediction show somehow.

295
00:16:56,280 --> 00:17:00,400
But something that could have gone in the prediction show is canonical IPOing, which

296
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:03,600
I've threatened on previous episodes put in, but I'm not going to.

297
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:07,880
So I'll say it now, I think that 2020 is going to be the year that they're going to announce

298
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:11,720
that it probably won't happen, because it takes a lot of time to get it all together.

299
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:16,320
But it feels like the ducks are in a row, and they're getting more and more so.

300
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:20,640
And we're heading towards that point where it's going to happen.

301
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,680
I guess I have to take the opposite side of that bet.

302
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:28,520
I'll take that opposite side and I'll say, no IPO, they may announce funding, but no

303
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:29,520
IPO.

304
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:31,720
You might be right because these things do take a lot of time.

305
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:32,720
Yeah, I don't know, though.

306
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,760
It feels like we've been building up to it for the last two years.

307
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:38,680
Yeah, but that kind of business stuff takes a long time, doesn't it?

308
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:39,680
True, true.

309
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:42,880
Well, I'm taking the other side because there's really only two sides to that bet.

310
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:47,240
Well, there's the third possibility that someone could buy them.

311
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:48,240
True.

312
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:49,880
But then what would Mark do with all his free time?

313
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:50,880
I don't think so.

314
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,880
I think he's in it to win it.

315
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:53,880
Maybe, maybe.

316
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:58,200
It also has been very interesting to watch Red Hat this year.

317
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:03,360
I had my first opportunity to go to a Red Hat summit, and it happened to be the Red

318
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:05,880
Hat summit where RHEL 8 was released.

319
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:11,520
Which has been a very well-received release, and quite the change from RHEL 7, it's almost

320
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:14,800
like the whole industry has changed between 7 and 8.

321
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:18,200
And they've really incorporated all those changes into it.

322
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:19,200
Yeah, that's it.

323
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:26,260
It was a very palpable sensation at Red Hat summit that this release really was a recognition

324
00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:30,100
of how much it changed since the last RHEL, and they really were trying to message that

325
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:31,860
very clearly.

326
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:35,920
And this was all happening in the shadow of the IBM acquisition that hadn't completely

327
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:41,940
closed yet, and with them nearly reaching the $3 billion revenue mark, which they ended

328
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:43,840
up actually hitting later in the year.

329
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:48,040
Yeah, and what was interesting about that $3 billion is how small that was compared

330
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:49,040
with IBM.

331
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:54,740
Of course, with that IBM acquisition, we weren't really sure what the state of CentOS was.

332
00:18:54,740 --> 00:19:02,420
There was a strange kind of weird delay for CentOS 8, and then we woke up one morning,

333
00:19:02,420 --> 00:19:06,480
and not only had CentOS 8 landed, but a new beast had been released.

334
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:11,680
Yeah, CentOS Stream, the rolling version of CentOS, which suddenly explained why there

335
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:15,480
was a delay to releasing CentOS 8 in the first place.

336
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:20,000
People were really starting to scratch their heads wondering where it was, and then suddenly

337
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,520
8 and Stream come along, and we're like, ah, that's why there was a delay.

338
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:24,760
Yeah, it's pretty interesting.

339
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:29,520
I haven't played with it a bunch, just a little bit, but it does have a lot of potential to

340
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:35,840
get changes upstreamed into RHEL in a much more direct kind of pipeline, which I'll be

341
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:37,680
digging into more in 2020.

342
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:44,680
We also saw Fedora 31 ship, which included a very polished and well-performing version

343
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:45,680
of Gnome Shell.

344
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:49,360
Yeah, and that was off the back of Fedora 30, which was also released.

345
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:56,320
Two very solid releases, not massively exciting, but I suppose that's kind of not what you

346
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:57,320
want from Fedora.

347
00:19:57,320 --> 00:20:01,800
You want just stability and something that's just going to work for you.

348
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:07,000
Nice and steady improvements, yeah, that is the nice Fedora recipe.

349
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,760
I also feel like just while we're talking about distros, I kind of need to give an honorable

350
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:18,520
mention to both Manjaro and PopOS, which saw a lot of coverage in the YouTube space, and

351
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:22,720
Manjaro had a deal cut with the free office folks.

352
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:26,920
There's a new kind of leveling up for them with their business formation as well, so

353
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:32,400
it's been a good year for those distributions, and elementary OS saw a series of steady faster

354
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:38,040
releases for their distribution, so more features came to the later releases than typically

355
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:39,040
we saw in the past.

356
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:45,000
And of course, we saw the end of Antigos this year, but then rising from the ashes of it

357
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:50,680
was Endeavor OS, which I've been really impressed with, and I think is now my go-to for installing

358
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:55,080
Arch because it's just so easy and simple, and it's got a great XFCE implementation,

359
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:57,000
which is always going to keep me happy.

360
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:03,560
And it's really been something for me personally to watch the explosion of community around

361
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:05,280
the Home Assistant project.

362
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:11,640
The home automation software I use, it's now in the top 10 on GitHub of all projects,

363
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:16,200
and the community has just exponentially grown this year.

364
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:22,580
It's really been neat to see the project hit its stride and watch the maintainers still

365
00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:27,360
interact with the community, do live streams, ask questions, see them grow.

366
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:29,780
They recently hired another member.

367
00:21:29,780 --> 00:21:33,980
It's been a heck of a year for the Home Assistant project.

368
00:21:33,980 --> 00:21:39,460
But there is one category that's a bit absent, and that's mobile.

369
00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:42,660
We don't really have a massive update.

370
00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:48,020
We have a lot of really solid progress, and we're very close to breaking to what I would

371
00:21:48,020 --> 00:21:54,140
call big updates, like shipping hardware and whatnot, but we're not quite there, are we?

372
00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:55,300
We're not really there.

373
00:21:55,300 --> 00:22:01,840
We did see UbiPorts finally create their foundation and gain some legitimacy there, and finally

374
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:04,160
get their business sorted out.

375
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:09,940
And we've seen really good improvements with post-market OS, and the PinePhone, which is

376
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:15,540
almost shipping, and the prototypes and dev kits for that are running pretty solidly,

377
00:22:15,540 --> 00:22:20,020
and make phone calls, but we're just not quite there.

378
00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:25,180
Feels like 2020 could be a year that we see some serious progress on that front.

379
00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:30,740
I think that what's important is to understand that it's very unlikely that a proper GNU

380
00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:35,020
slash Linux phone is going to take on Android and iOS.

381
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:41,100
But I think that we will see in 2020 a big niche being filled there, and it only takes

382
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:45,580
a fraction of the whole market to make it worthwhile.

383
00:22:45,580 --> 00:22:51,220
A few hundred thousand people running a GNU slash Linux phone is still pretty cool.

384
00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:53,940
Yeah, look at the small board computer market.

385
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:59,420
It's a sustainable market for hobbyists and people that are learning and developing.

386
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:06,100
So I absolutely could see a Linux phone market serving a similar niche to that.

387
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:10,440
There's so many categories that we could talk about in an episode like this that this could

388
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:15,360
be a four-part series, it could be a four-hour episode, but I wouldn't mind including just

389
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:16,880
one honorable mention for myself.

390
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:25,420
I am so freaking satisfied with Linux gaming between Proton, native ports, Stadia.

391
00:23:25,420 --> 00:23:26,880
I'm good to go.

392
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:28,940
There's literally not a game I can't play right now.

393
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:33,520
I don't play all the games, but every time I've gone to play any single game that has

394
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:37,720
crossed my fancy, I've been able to play it in 2019.

395
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:42,660
It's like getting email from an exchange server level cool kind of stuff for me.

396
00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:45,620
That was the untapped territory.

397
00:23:45,620 --> 00:23:54,100
I can fire up Star Trek Online anytime I want on Linux, or Truck Simulator, yes, Truck Simulator.

398
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:55,100
It's the whole range, Joe.

399
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:59,500
You need to get Euro Truck Simulator and drive around London, see how you like driving on

400
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:00,500
the wrong side of the road.

401
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:05,420
I think it would drive me crazy and crash my RV next time I took it out on the road.

402
00:24:05,420 --> 00:24:11,140
Well, like I said, we could go on forever, and we have to wrap up because next week it
