Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, our weekly take on Linux and the open source world.

00:16.000 --> 00:20.100
This is episode 22, recorded on October 8th, 2017.

00:20.100 --> 00:21.100
I'm Chris.

00:21.100 --> 00:22.100
And I'm Joe.

00:22.100 --> 00:23.100
Hello, Joe.

00:23.100 --> 00:27.000
I don't know if you were glued to your computer screen this week, but in case you missed it,

00:27.000 --> 00:28.680
Google had some new announcements.

00:28.680 --> 00:33.080
Yeah, they've announced loads of new expensive hardware that I'm never going to buy.

00:33.080 --> 00:36.480
I suppose it's not on my purchase list either, not at the moment.

00:36.480 --> 00:40.920
I could come back and look at some of these things in the future, but the main pieces

00:40.920 --> 00:46.300
of hardware, the Pixel 2 and the Pixel 2 XL, are not necessarily calling to me, but they

00:46.300 --> 00:49.520
seem like pretty competitive upgrades for people that are looking for that Google-like

00:49.520 --> 00:50.520
phone experience.

00:50.520 --> 00:57.320
Yeah, they look good, front-facing speakers, nice display, nice specs and everything, USB-C,

00:57.320 --> 00:59.040
but then, what?

00:59.040 --> 01:00.040
No!

01:00.040 --> 01:01.880
No headphone jack!

01:01.880 --> 01:02.880
Yep.

01:02.880 --> 01:05.640
Welcome to the no headphone jack reality.

01:05.640 --> 01:10.380
And I think the XL looks a little better than the regular Pixel 2.

01:10.380 --> 01:13.880
You're going to have 64 and 128 gigabyte options.

01:13.880 --> 01:15.880
Both will ship with 4 gigs of RAM.

01:15.880 --> 01:16.880
And this is interesting.

01:16.880 --> 01:18.620
Get ready for this, iPhone users.

01:18.620 --> 01:24.160
The XL and the regular Pixel have the same camera, processor and speaker specs.

01:24.160 --> 01:30.640
Yeah, it's a 12.2 megapixel rear camera with autofocus, with a laser to assist in autofocus,

01:30.640 --> 01:35.720
and they have something that sounds really fancy, and both the front and the rear cameras

01:35.720 --> 01:36.940
have this.

01:36.940 --> 01:39.720
They have side-by-side pixel technology.

01:39.720 --> 01:40.720
Yeah.

01:40.720 --> 01:41.720
Are you ready for this?

01:41.720 --> 01:45.900
So instead of needing two camera lenses, the new Pixel phones, because the camera image

01:45.900 --> 01:51.720
sensor has pixels that are side-by-side, in fact, just mere microns apart, my friends,

01:51.720 --> 01:57.360
that they can get the two lens setup that you have in the iPhone X and the iPhone 8

01:57.360 --> 02:00.600
Plus in a one lens camera.

02:00.600 --> 02:06.100
As usual, Google, a software company, I suppose you would say, have decided to solve the problem

02:06.100 --> 02:07.800
with software instead of hardware.

02:07.800 --> 02:08.800
Right.

02:08.800 --> 02:09.800
You have to say machine learning, Joe.

02:09.800 --> 02:12.800
I don't know if you noticed, but you got to say that at least every 35 seconds.

02:12.800 --> 02:13.800
Yeah.

02:13.800 --> 02:18.720
Well, that was the overarching theme here throughout all of the products that they announced,

02:18.720 --> 02:20.720
is that they are packed full of machine learning.

02:20.720 --> 02:26.520
Lots of machine learning, yes, and AI on top of machine learning, which is just, it gets

02:26.520 --> 02:30.920
a little old after a bit, but I did some digging, and I think legitimately you can call this

02:30.920 --> 02:32.320
stuff machine learning.

02:32.320 --> 02:36.960
They are looking at the scene in the imagery and using machine learning to determine what

02:36.960 --> 02:41.640
should be in focus and what should be in the background, and by doing this, they can derive

02:41.640 --> 02:46.040
what they call portrait mode, and they can make some really impressive images from some

02:46.040 --> 02:47.880
really shallow glass.

02:47.880 --> 02:53.080
And I have to give them the nod, they seem to have the best camera setup in the 2017

02:53.080 --> 02:54.200
smartphone line right now.

02:54.200 --> 02:58.560
Yeah, maybe, but just those prices, if you want to pay that much for a phone, buy an

02:58.560 --> 02:59.560
iPhone surely.

02:59.560 --> 03:00.560
Maybe so.

03:00.560 --> 03:04.000
The whole point of Android is it's cheaper.

03:04.000 --> 03:05.000
That's always been the case.

03:05.000 --> 03:09.400
There's got to be some folks out there, Joe, that want that pure Android experience, and

03:09.400 --> 03:10.520
that's what the Pixel brings.

03:10.520 --> 03:13.880
It's more of a Google phone than it really is even an Android phone.

03:13.880 --> 03:15.200
It's the Google phone now.

03:15.200 --> 03:18.080
But like both you and I said, I'm skipping this one for now.

03:18.080 --> 03:21.400
The Pixel 2, while it looks good, I think the action's going to be in the Pixel 3.

03:21.400 --> 03:25.000
Google recently hired thousands of engineers from HTC.

03:25.000 --> 03:29.240
They're incorporating them into the Android team, and I think a lot of that skill's going

03:29.240 --> 03:31.320
to land in the Pixel 3.

03:31.320 --> 03:34.880
But for those of you that are looking to buy the Pixel 2, the 64 gigabyte version will

03:34.880 --> 03:44.160
cost you 650 US greenbacks right now, while the Pixel 2 XL, 64 gig, will cost 850 US greenbacks.

03:44.160 --> 03:46.800
And no headphone jack.

03:46.800 --> 03:49.680
I hate to say it again, but this is big.

03:49.680 --> 03:53.220
Last time with the Pixel, they made a big thing about we've got a headphone jack, whereas

03:53.220 --> 03:55.400
now they're just giving in.

03:55.400 --> 04:01.480
And if the next Samsung phone, the next generation, doesn't come with a headphone jack, then it's

04:01.480 --> 04:03.000
finished.

04:03.000 --> 04:08.360
And that to me, I sound like some sort of old Luddite or something, but I'm a person

04:08.360 --> 04:11.120
who uses Bluetooth constantly.

04:11.120 --> 04:16.500
But just the other day, both my Bluetooth adapters died, and I had to plug my headphones

04:16.500 --> 04:18.080
in like a caveman.

04:18.080 --> 04:21.240
Now I'm not going to do that with a dongle, because I can't find my dongle.

04:21.240 --> 04:22.840
Where's it gone?

04:22.840 --> 04:27.120
Whereas you've always got that option, and it really, really annoys me and frustrates

04:27.120 --> 04:30.680
me that we've had to move this way.

04:30.680 --> 04:32.840
But that's the way we're going.

04:32.840 --> 04:36.000
And they've got their own answer to AirPods now, aren't they?

04:36.000 --> 04:37.000
Pixel Buds.

04:37.000 --> 04:41.160
Yeah, the Pixel Buds, not a big fan of the name, and not a big fan of the fact that it

04:41.160 --> 04:43.040
feels like a derivative Apple product.

04:43.040 --> 04:46.580
It feels like they're just copying the AirPods, and they're just checking off a box.

04:46.580 --> 04:49.740
They are integrating something though that I don't think the AirPods are going to have

04:49.740 --> 04:56.960
anytime soon, and that's Google Translate real time during conversations in your headphones.

04:56.960 --> 05:01.200
That is a neat feature, but I have to imagine it's only going to work when you have great

05:01.200 --> 05:05.200
connectivity and not a lot of background noise.

05:05.200 --> 05:09.720
And for the trade-off of having a wire and all of the other kind of compromises you make

05:09.720 --> 05:11.960
with the Pixel Pods, we'll see.

05:11.960 --> 05:13.480
I'm sorry, the Pixel Buds.

05:13.480 --> 05:14.480
Don't call them the Pixel Pods.

05:14.480 --> 05:15.480
They're the Pixel Buds.

05:15.480 --> 05:18.120
Yeah, it's the Babel fish come to life.

05:18.120 --> 05:19.120
It's kind of neat.

05:19.120 --> 05:20.120
That feels like Star Trek.

05:20.120 --> 05:23.520
Yeah, it's pretty cool, but it's only going to be available on the Pixel for now, so we'll

05:23.520 --> 05:26.400
have to see if that goes to other phones.

05:26.400 --> 05:31.280
Did you see Google Clips, the camera that is trained to capture soundless videos, no

05:31.280 --> 05:36.320
sound on the videos, and it recognizes pets and other quote-unquote interesting moments

05:36.320 --> 05:37.320
in your life.

05:37.320 --> 05:41.080
So you put it off on the shelf, just forget that the Google camera is even there, pay

05:41.080 --> 05:45.360
no attention, and whenever Google deems that you're doing something interesting, it takes

05:45.360 --> 05:46.360
a picture.

05:46.360 --> 05:47.360
Or actually, I'm sorry, a video.

05:47.360 --> 05:50.560
Yeah, that's not creepy at all, is it?

05:50.560 --> 05:52.600
No, not at all.

05:52.600 --> 05:58.480
Okay, and then we're going to move on, but worth noting, the new Pixelbook starts at

05:58.480 --> 06:03.800
$1,000 US greenbacks, goes up to $1,700, and when you do that, you get 512 gigabytes of

06:03.800 --> 06:11.040
NVMe storage, you get a seventh-generation i7 processor, you get the 12.3-inch high-resolution

06:11.040 --> 06:17.120
screen, and Google bills it as the first laptop that has Google Assistant built into it.

06:17.120 --> 06:19.280
Well, two things jump out at me.

06:19.280 --> 06:22.880
One, why would you need that much storage in a Chromebook?

06:22.880 --> 06:25.520
I suppose we'll get to that in a second.

06:25.520 --> 06:29.900
And secondly, look at this thing, it looks very old-fashioned with these giant bezels

06:29.900 --> 06:32.400
compared to an XPS or whatever.

06:32.400 --> 06:33.400
It just looks old-school.

06:33.400 --> 06:35.640
Yeah, you're right, it does look old-school.

06:35.640 --> 06:39.760
That is quite a thick bezel around it, it's got a keyboard that looks sort of old-school

06:39.760 --> 06:40.760
as well.

06:40.760 --> 06:44.240
The whole design is a little outdated, but I would say that's true for the Pixels.

06:44.240 --> 06:49.320
I think Google this time around has gone for functionality more so than design.

06:49.320 --> 06:55.320
At $1,000, with Google Assistant built in, i7 processor, and for another $100, you can

06:55.320 --> 07:01.920
get their Pen, which has been co-developed with Wacom, maybe as a niche product I could

07:01.920 --> 07:03.720
see this being successful.

07:03.720 --> 07:10.360
But Joe, I'm not particularly optimistic about the chances of any of these products announced.

07:10.360 --> 07:17.360
The Pixel, the Pixel AirPod knockoff, the HomePod knockoffs, the Pixelbook, none of

07:17.360 --> 07:19.420
it is really competitive.

07:19.420 --> 07:23.240
And I guess kind of this time around it feels like Google sort of just checked everything

07:23.240 --> 07:28.320
off, we've revved everything, but none of it really is really compelling to me personally.

07:28.320 --> 07:34.440
Well the only thing that's innovative is the Eclipse camera, and that is just creepy.

07:34.440 --> 07:40.640
So yeah, Amazon has got the Echo line sewn up and Apple's having their go at it, so I

07:40.640 --> 07:45.320
just can't see the Google Home Mini and Max doing particularly well.

07:45.320 --> 07:50.420
And this camera thing, yes it's innovative, but it's just creepy.

07:50.420 --> 07:55.080
So yeah, and the phones as well, it's niche.

07:55.080 --> 07:59.160
The kind of person who wants a pure Android experience and is willing to pay that much

07:59.160 --> 08:01.040
for it I think is just niche.

08:01.040 --> 08:04.000
People want a Samsung phone or they want an iPhone, it's as simple as that.

08:04.000 --> 08:08.420
So yeah, not particularly confident.

08:08.420 --> 08:14.280
But one thing I became aware of this week is CROSVM, CROSVM, I don't know how you pronounce

08:14.280 --> 08:15.280
it, but it is-

08:15.280 --> 08:16.280
Pro's VM?

08:16.280 --> 08:17.280
Yeah, maybe.

08:17.280 --> 08:23.000
It's basically VMs in Chrome OS, so you can potentially, if you know what you're doing,

08:23.000 --> 08:29.800
run virtual machines of proper Linux on there, which suddenly makes it far more attractive

08:29.800 --> 08:31.640
for developers.

08:31.640 --> 08:36.120
But then again, I don't know, do you really want to spend $1,000 on a machine that the

08:36.120 --> 08:40.140
only way to run proper Linux on it is in a VM?

08:40.140 --> 08:44.840
And if you want to use it for its proper purpose, it's basically a web browser.

08:44.840 --> 08:48.480
I mean, I know it's a little bit more than a web browser these days, but it's still fundamentally

08:48.480 --> 08:49.760
a web browser, isn't it?

08:49.760 --> 08:51.680
Yeah, but that could also be its appeal.

08:51.680 --> 08:55.760
The simplicity, the utilitarianness of it, the appliance aspect of it.

08:55.760 --> 08:59.120
Oh, and by the way, if you need to use some VMs, it can do that too.

08:59.120 --> 09:05.120
So this CROSVM or CROSVM, C-R-O-S-V-M, it is essentially KVM, but it's the Chrome OS

09:05.120 --> 09:07.240
version of KVM.

09:07.240 --> 09:14.800
And it is focused on hyper-virtualization, which doesn't go through the entire hardware stack

09:14.800 --> 09:15.880
and emulate it.

09:15.880 --> 09:20.040
So it doesn't try to pretend like a disk controller, doesn't try to pretend like a network controller,

09:20.040 --> 09:22.800
doesn't try to pretend like it has its own dedicated CPU.

09:22.800 --> 09:23.800
It's hyper-virtualized.

09:23.800 --> 09:27.920
The drivers are aware that they're in a VM, and they pass directly through the virtualizer

09:27.920 --> 09:30.760
to the host operating system.

09:30.760 --> 09:32.120
High-performant virtualization here.

09:32.120 --> 09:35.060
And that is the exact kind of thing you would want on a Pixelbook.

09:35.060 --> 09:41.700
So now you start taking that higher-end storage of the $1,700 Pixelbook with the 512 gig NVMe,

09:41.700 --> 09:47.880
and you combine it with CROSVM and the possibility of running an Ubuntu or Fedora or CentOS machine

09:47.880 --> 09:52.560
on top of a Chromebook, it starts to become a more useful laptop.

09:52.560 --> 09:55.160
And that price point is easier to justify.

09:55.160 --> 10:01.720
Easier, but still, I think if it was kind of like $700, $800, then it would be a much

10:01.720 --> 10:02.720
easier sell.

10:02.720 --> 10:03.720
Yeah, slam dunk.

10:03.720 --> 10:04.720
That's what it would be.

10:04.720 --> 10:05.960
It would be a slam dunk.

10:05.960 --> 10:09.760
And at this, it's really you taking a bet on the Google ecosystem still.

10:09.760 --> 10:13.480
Yeah, I want to see how it does, but it's been a long time since they had a high-end

10:13.480 --> 10:15.000
Chromebook.

10:15.000 --> 10:18.260
And that can't have done well, otherwise they would have kept doing it.

10:18.260 --> 10:23.480
So they've decided to have another bash at it, but not hugely confident for them, I must

10:23.480 --> 10:24.480
say.

10:24.480 --> 10:25.480
You and I have said these are niche products.

10:25.480 --> 10:26.480
Nobody wants these.

10:26.480 --> 10:29.920
Of course, the irony is our audience probably is interested in the Pixel phone.

10:29.920 --> 10:33.200
Not so sure about the Pixelbook, but definitely the Pixel phone.

10:33.200 --> 10:36.520
And if they're not interested in the Pixel phone, they might be interested in flashing

10:36.520 --> 10:39.360
their own ROMs or something like Sailfish X.

10:39.360 --> 10:42.120
Yeah, so we talked about this when it was announced.

10:42.120 --> 10:45.680
And now it is available to pre-order, I suppose you would say.

10:45.680 --> 10:47.640
They'll take your money at this point.

10:47.640 --> 10:53.680
So if you've got an Xperia X phone, which I looked into, you can get one in decent condition

10:53.680 --> 10:54.680
for £150.

10:54.680 --> 10:57.000
So that's not too bad.

10:57.000 --> 11:00.200
Then you can buy the Sailfish ROM from YOLO and flash it.

11:00.200 --> 11:03.760
And that is coming in a couple of days, the download for it.

11:03.760 --> 11:07.400
So if you're interested in it, now is the time to spend your money.

11:07.400 --> 11:11.700
Yeah, and they've expanded support for installation to Windows host systems.

11:11.700 --> 11:16.040
So if you run Windows and we're concerned about having to load Linux to get Sailfish

11:16.040 --> 11:19.300
X installed on your Sony Xperia X, well, guess what?

11:19.300 --> 11:24.920
Now they will just emulate a Linux environment on your Windows host and do it for you.

11:24.920 --> 11:28.480
I can't see it being much more than ADB and fast boot, but what do I know?

11:28.480 --> 11:29.480
Yeah, it does require Java.

11:29.480 --> 11:30.480
I know that.

11:30.480 --> 11:31.480
Yeah.

11:31.480 --> 11:32.480
I don't see why it would need Java.

11:32.480 --> 11:33.480
But there we go.

11:33.480 --> 11:34.480
I'm tempted.

11:34.480 --> 11:38.440
The fact that it's only £150 for the phone and the fact that there's a paranoid Android

11:38.440 --> 11:43.980
ROM available for it, then it makes me think maybe if it had mainline lineage support,

11:43.980 --> 11:47.160
so I knew that I could flash that on it afterwards.

11:47.160 --> 11:48.560
That would be the sweet spot.

11:48.560 --> 11:52.360
Yeah, but it's not on that list, unfortunately.

11:52.360 --> 11:56.600
So I don't know what's going on with YOLO, really.

11:56.600 --> 12:03.080
So this is a last-ditch attempt to make some money and pay back the people who bought the

12:03.080 --> 12:07.880
tablet on the Kickstarter or whatever it was.

12:07.880 --> 12:11.920
I haven't seen as many people interested in this as I thought I would, put it that way,

12:11.920 --> 12:12.920
since it was announced.

12:12.920 --> 12:13.920
Really?

12:13.920 --> 12:15.260
I kind of feel like, okay, you're right.

12:15.260 --> 12:18.960
The interest isn't as high as it should be, but I have had a couple of conversations with

12:18.960 --> 12:23.200
people that have been like, well, I'm going to just pay it and just do it.

12:23.200 --> 12:24.200
I got a fun development.

12:24.200 --> 12:25.200
I'm going to give it a shot.

12:25.200 --> 12:26.200
Yeah, no big deal.

12:26.200 --> 12:27.200
Just give it a go.

12:27.200 --> 12:31.240
Like for them, I think that price point is just it's not too expensive that they're willing

12:31.240 --> 12:37.000
to sort of kick that company some money and let them continue development and get a ROM

12:37.000 --> 12:38.000
in exchange.

12:38.000 --> 12:40.180
And I feel like a lot of people are comfortable with that.

12:40.180 --> 12:43.680
And I'm only saying that based on anecdotal conversations I've had with maybe three people.

12:43.680 --> 12:45.320
So take it for a grain of salt.

12:45.320 --> 12:49.360
But the three people I've talked to, Joe, that are Sailfish users seem to be on board

12:49.360 --> 12:50.360
with it.

12:50.360 --> 12:54.120
Yeah, I suppose at $60 or 50 euros, it's not too bad.

12:54.120 --> 12:58.920
Yeah, and by talking to those three Sailfish owners or users, I believe I have now surveyed

12:58.920 --> 13:04.000
60% of the entire Sailfish market.

13:04.000 --> 13:06.400
Maybe we're all just waiting for Psi-5 to save us.

13:06.400 --> 13:07.400
Is that how you say it?

13:07.400 --> 13:08.400
Psi-5?

13:08.400 --> 13:09.400
Yes.

13:09.400 --> 13:10.400
Psi-5, I think is how you pronounce it.

13:10.400 --> 13:18.080
That is a company who is just about to release the first 64-bit system on a chip based on

13:18.080 --> 13:22.400
the RISC-V architecture, which is completely open source.

13:22.400 --> 13:27.040
It is the architecture that ARM should be as far as I'm concerned.

13:27.040 --> 13:30.040
It can run completely free software.

13:30.040 --> 13:36.040
And this SOC is designed to run Linux out of the box and having four 1.5 gigahertz cores

13:36.040 --> 13:40.520
seems like a pretty good start to me and being 64-bit as well.

13:40.520 --> 13:42.700
So this is not consumer ready at this point.

13:42.700 --> 13:47.200
This is released to manufacturers and it's quite expensive to buy it, to develop for

13:47.200 --> 13:48.200
it.

13:48.200 --> 13:54.040
I've been watching this story for a couple of years now develop because it is to me very

13:54.040 --> 13:57.600
important that we have something that can run free software top to bottom.

13:57.600 --> 14:00.560
And obviously we've talked about Purism, what they're trying to do, and I get the feeling

14:00.560 --> 14:05.280
that they'll be back in the news next week when they reach their 1.5 million.

14:05.280 --> 14:11.200
But it's surely the aspiration of anybody in our community is to run hardware that can

14:11.200 --> 14:13.360
run purely free software.

14:13.360 --> 14:18.560
And you have to start at the very lowest level and that is the processor, the CPU.

14:18.560 --> 14:21.080
And that is what RISC-V is all about.

14:21.080 --> 14:22.080
Absolutely.

14:22.080 --> 14:27.120
And so these are purpose-built application customizable CPUs and that's what Linux is

14:27.120 --> 14:28.120
too.

14:28.120 --> 14:32.020
Linux can be purpose-built customized for a singular application to really optimize

14:32.020 --> 14:33.020
that workload.

14:33.020 --> 14:36.520
And that's why Linux and Android have been massively successful in the last few years.

14:36.520 --> 14:41.080
And so now we have a RISC-V processor built around that same principle.

14:41.080 --> 14:46.040
In fact, the company promotes this as optimized for Linux.

14:46.040 --> 14:52.240
Welcome to 2017 everybody, where a CPU manufacturer is advertising to other hardware manufacturers

14:52.240 --> 14:55.760
that they build a CPU optimized to run Linux.

14:55.760 --> 14:58.960
Yeah, this is the start of the dream as far as I'm concerned.

14:58.960 --> 15:02.000
Whether that dream is going to pan out or not, I really don't know.

15:02.000 --> 15:06.040
But it's something that you don't see that much chatter about.

15:06.040 --> 15:10.720
And people seem to be pinning their hopes on x86 and ARM at its early days.

15:10.720 --> 15:14.960
It's very early days for RISC-V, but we need things like this to happen.

15:14.960 --> 15:21.760
We need to have 64-bit quad-core and potentially octa-core plus, and we need to see the performance

15:21.760 --> 15:24.980
increase and we need to see development in this area.

15:24.980 --> 15:30.680
Because as far as I'm concerned, this is the only hope for a totally free software stack

15:30.680 --> 15:31.680
when it comes to hardware.

15:31.680 --> 15:33.840
Yeah, and the performance seems to be there.

15:33.840 --> 15:37.640
Being able to tailor it for specific applications is a huge benefit.

15:37.640 --> 15:43.240
And it's unburdened with all the legacy stuff that x86 has, so also I am very optimistic

15:43.240 --> 15:44.240
about it.

15:44.240 --> 15:45.240
So you guys should check it out.

15:45.240 --> 15:51.660
Psi 5, and we'll have the links in the show notes, linuxactionnews.com slash 22.

15:51.660 --> 15:54.160
Go give it a read, because it looks like they're working on something pretty cool.

15:54.160 --> 15:58.120
And I would bet you that down the road, future boxes that you have in your house could have

15:58.120 --> 16:04.560
a CPU very much like this inside them.

16:04.560 --> 16:11.240
LAS.ting.com, you go there, you get $25 off a device or $25 in service credit.

16:11.240 --> 16:15.840
I would check their BYOD page, because they have a CDMA and a GSM network, so you probably

16:15.840 --> 16:17.320
have a device you can bring.

16:17.320 --> 16:21.280
But this is what's great about Ting, it's pay for what you use mobile.

16:21.280 --> 16:24.960
Your minutes, your messages, and your megabytes, you add them all up, whatever you use, that's

16:24.960 --> 16:25.960
what you pay for.

16:25.960 --> 16:26.960
Oh, you spent the whole month on Wi-Fi?

16:26.960 --> 16:28.840
Then you're not paying for data.

16:28.840 --> 16:29.840
Use Telegram or WhatsApp?

16:29.840 --> 16:31.760
Then you don't pay for text messages.

16:31.760 --> 16:32.760
It's great.

16:32.760 --> 16:33.760
LAS.ting.com.

16:33.760 --> 16:36.000
In fact, check out their blog.

16:36.000 --> 16:39.480
Do me a favor, go to LAS.ting.com, then go to their blog, because they're doing giveaways

16:39.480 --> 16:40.480
constantly.

16:40.480 --> 16:44.120
I think just recently they have like a two gigabyte data giveaway, so check that out

16:44.120 --> 16:45.240
on their blog.

16:45.240 --> 16:48.440
It's mobile that really makes sense, with no contracts, no early termination fees, a

16:48.440 --> 16:51.440
great dashboard, and radically different customer service.

16:51.440 --> 16:52.440
They're owned by two cows.

16:52.440 --> 16:55.180
If you're familiar with two cows, then you know what I'm talking about.

16:55.180 --> 16:56.700
It's truly mobile that's different.

16:56.700 --> 17:05.880
That's how the whole industry would do it today if they were forced to restart, LAS.ting.com.

17:05.880 --> 17:11.160
Let's talk about the poster child for FOSS in government, and that is Munich.

17:11.160 --> 17:14.660
It's been a story that's rumbled on for about 10 years, I think.

17:14.660 --> 17:21.960
They're moving over to an Ubuntu-based distribution, and moving the applications over first.

17:21.960 --> 17:26.920
When the government changed and they were thinking about rolling back, well, it looks

17:26.920 --> 17:29.320
like that has started.

17:29.320 --> 17:34.400
It looks like they've started to move back to Exchange, so Colab is not going to be used

17:34.400 --> 17:38.800
anymore, and so Mail and Calendaring is going back to evil MS.

17:38.800 --> 17:42.680
Yeah, it actually stings because they're moving away from Colab to me.

17:42.680 --> 17:46.800
Here's the direct quote, and it hurts because it's from a city council member.

17:46.800 --> 17:49.840
It says, the city will use Microsoft Exchange.

17:49.840 --> 17:56.980
You will be used for email, calendar, so Colab will not be used anymore.

17:56.980 --> 18:01.620
Hard and just cold like that, and out of all of it, for some reason, that's what upsets

18:01.620 --> 18:06.300
me the most because I feel like they obviously botched the Linux desktop rollout.

18:06.300 --> 18:10.560
They were trying to make an old version of Open Office that they had patched to work.

18:10.560 --> 18:14.320
They were trying to make an old version of Linux that they had customized work for them

18:14.320 --> 18:17.700
as some sort of desktop-specific distro.

18:17.700 --> 18:19.480
They were doing everything wrong.

18:19.480 --> 18:23.440
They were the case study in how not to switch to Linux, and in some way, that's actually

18:23.440 --> 18:24.440
valuable for all of us.

18:24.440 --> 18:27.880
We can look at Munich and say, okay, this is how you don't do it.

18:27.880 --> 18:33.840
But the one area felt like they were doing things right was with collaboration software,

18:33.840 --> 18:39.560
and specifically, using Colab, and to see them switch into Microsoft Exchange here,

18:39.560 --> 18:42.440
it's a bigger deal than it seems on its face because it either means they're going all

18:42.440 --> 18:46.340
in on hosting or they're going all in on active directory.

18:46.340 --> 18:49.640
Either way, fundamental shifts, and it's sort of disappointing to see it.

18:49.640 --> 18:50.640
I admit.

18:50.640 --> 18:51.640
Yeah.

18:51.640 --> 18:55.480
The thing is that a lot of people in our community, or almost everyone, just thinks it's a universally

18:55.480 --> 19:01.300
bad thing that they would go back to Microsoft products, whereas to me, I try and be a bit

19:01.300 --> 19:07.080
more pragmatic about it, and I would say that they have the responsibility to look at the

19:07.080 --> 19:08.320
figures here.

19:08.320 --> 19:15.160
Is it going to cost them less to pay for Microsoft than it would to go for some sort of open

19:15.160 --> 19:19.880
source solution, and I would much prefer them to go open source, but if it's going to cost

19:19.880 --> 19:24.480
them less ultimately, then I kind of feel like they have the responsibility to do that.

19:24.480 --> 19:29.120
That said, if they'd done it properly in the first place and just paid Red Hat to come

19:29.120 --> 19:34.120
in and give them proper support, then that would have probably worked out cheaper.

19:34.120 --> 19:35.120
I don't know.

19:35.120 --> 19:36.120
Who knows?

19:36.120 --> 19:40.000
But trying to roll their own solution and no one knowing exactly what was going on,

19:40.000 --> 19:45.760
and as you say, patching these ancient versions of Ubuntu and OpenOffice and stuff, that was

19:45.760 --> 19:49.500
just never going to be the right solution.

19:49.500 --> 19:57.400
Nothing to do with Microsoft opening up their German headquarters in Munich or anything.

19:57.400 --> 20:02.080
It's all a very disappointing story, but yeah, I think you've picked up on the silver lining

20:02.080 --> 20:04.200
that, yeah, at least we can learn what not to do now.

20:04.200 --> 20:05.640
That is really what to take away from it.

20:05.640 --> 20:11.200
To me, it seems like the cost of retraining the users was an obstacle that they could

20:11.200 --> 20:18.840
never completely get over, and then the requirement of time and development energy and cost to

20:18.840 --> 20:24.900
keep their Linux distribution current, it appears that they essentially gave up on that

20:24.900 --> 20:27.560
effort around 2013.

20:27.560 --> 20:31.480
They just decided it was too much work to keep it up to date.

20:31.480 --> 20:35.000
We're essentially writing our own operating system at this point, and then they tried

20:35.000 --> 20:42.040
to ride that 2013 distro out as long as possible, and then it got to a point where people just

20:42.040 --> 20:46.200
had to ask the question, well, look at Windows 10 and look at this bastardized Linux distribution

20:46.200 --> 20:47.480
from 2013.

20:47.480 --> 20:48.620
They're not competitive.

20:48.620 --> 20:49.940
We should just go this route.

20:49.940 --> 20:51.940
We avoid the retraining cost.

20:51.940 --> 20:56.800
We're already switching to Microsoft Exchange, so it's just obvious to make this switch,

20:56.800 --> 20:59.360
and the rest of it clicks into place.

20:59.360 --> 21:04.120
I think in the ashes of this entire experiment, what we can hope is they remain on open standard

21:04.120 --> 21:11.280
formats, like ODF, and they use systems that are available to the public even after commercial

21:11.280 --> 21:12.540
agreements end.

21:12.540 --> 21:14.040
That's the best we can hope for, I think.

21:14.040 --> 21:19.800
Yeah, except that it'll be docx or whatever the new one is.

21:19.800 --> 21:24.840
I can't see them sticking with the open standards, because unless they make the effort to make

21:24.840 --> 21:30.400
sure that it saves in those formats by default, it's just not going to happen, and you can

21:30.400 --> 21:34.600
see that being an easy thing to forget when you set up a machine.

21:34.600 --> 21:37.560
It does feel like, though, that is the new battle, and if there's any advocates in there

21:37.560 --> 21:41.440
for open standards and open formats, that is the button to start pushing.

21:41.440 --> 21:44.540
Because otherwise, you're going to have companies like Oracle roll in and just say, stop using

21:44.540 --> 21:46.080
open source altogether.

21:46.080 --> 21:50.840
Yeah, somehow I think you might be a bit riled up about this one, being that Oracle have

21:50.840 --> 21:53.480
advised the White House not to use FOSS.

21:53.480 --> 22:00.760
Yeah, this is after the US Digital Service, USDSK, and 18F had asked for comments from

22:00.760 --> 22:05.540
the private sector on how to modernize the federal government's security infrastructure,

22:05.540 --> 22:13.480
and lots of companies have submitted recommendations, including Adobe and Microsoft and just about

22:13.480 --> 22:17.520
every other company you could think of, and all of them are pretty standard.

22:17.520 --> 22:22.400
In fact, I have to really give some serious credit to Microsoft for writing one of the

22:22.400 --> 22:25.680
most concise and one of the most open.

22:25.680 --> 22:32.400
They just posted it as a gist instead of like a PDF, and it didn't really push any Microsoft

22:32.400 --> 22:34.440
goals.

22:34.440 --> 22:40.900
In contrast, Google had a very Google-centric proposal, which literally suggested the entire

22:40.900 --> 22:45.440
federal government should switch over to cloud computing and just trust Google for everything.

22:45.440 --> 22:48.000
Yeah, funny that, yeah.

22:48.000 --> 22:53.200
So Oracle though, Oracle really stepped on it, because Oracle is offended.

22:53.200 --> 22:58.160
Oracle is offended by the federal government's use of open source and the false narratives

22:58.160 --> 23:00.560
that they have landed on.

23:00.560 --> 23:02.500
In fact, they say just that.

23:02.500 --> 23:05.760
This is a direct quote from Oracle's submission, false narrative.

23:05.760 --> 23:09.320
The government should attempt to emulate fast-paced innovation of Silicon Valley.

23:09.320 --> 23:13.400
Silicon Valley is comprised of IT vendors, most of which fail.

23:13.400 --> 23:17.840
The USG is not a technology vendor, nor is it a startup.

23:17.840 --> 23:22.560
Under no circumstances should the USG attempt to become a technology vendor.

23:22.560 --> 23:30.640
And as you can imagine, that eventually de-escalates into don't use open source, don't use open

23:30.640 --> 23:33.200
standards, don't use open data.

23:33.200 --> 23:34.360
All of these things are bad.

23:34.360 --> 23:39.280
In fact, Oracle even attempts to make the case and attempts to argue that open source

23:39.280 --> 23:45.860
is seeing a decline in the private sector, and then goes to blame the Equifax breach

23:45.860 --> 23:50.920
on Apache, and uses that as an example of why the federal government shouldn't use open

23:50.920 --> 23:51.920
source software.

23:51.920 --> 23:56.440
Yeah, that is just absolutely outrageous that they would do that, because that was unpatched

23:56.440 --> 23:57.440
open source software.

23:57.440 --> 24:00.360
So that's got nothing to do with the fact that it was open source.

24:00.360 --> 24:04.480
But to be fair to them, they do kind of pepper it with a few facts.

24:04.480 --> 24:08.440
And I think that that first one about Silicon Valley being comprised of IT vendors, most

24:08.440 --> 24:11.120
of which fail, is actually true, isn't it?

24:11.120 --> 24:13.400
Yeah, it does resonate a bit true, you're right.

24:13.400 --> 24:17.680
But they kind of pepper it with a few facts, and then just the rest of it is just nonsense,

24:17.680 --> 24:19.920
just designed to...

24:19.920 --> 24:21.360
It's kind of FUD, really, isn't it?

24:21.360 --> 24:22.360
It's classic FUD.

24:22.360 --> 24:23.360
It is.

24:23.360 --> 24:27.400
In fact, it says that if the government were to mandate open source technology preferences,

24:27.400 --> 24:32.600
it would be a significant de-incentive to conducting business with the USG.

24:32.600 --> 24:36.400
Oracle is trying to tell them that if they mandate open source, businesses that want

24:36.400 --> 24:38.920
to make money won't work with them.

24:38.920 --> 24:39.920
What?

24:39.920 --> 24:41.880
Maybe they should tell that to Red Hat.

24:41.880 --> 24:42.880
Yeah, exactly.

24:42.880 --> 24:43.880
Yeah, it seems better.

24:43.880 --> 24:45.320
It just doesn't make any sense.

24:45.320 --> 24:50.800
I mean, okay, there are some legacy companies, like Oracle, who won't be interested, but

24:50.800 --> 24:51.960
that's their problem.

24:51.960 --> 24:55.160
A lot of this, Joe, to me comes across as bitterness.

24:55.160 --> 25:00.940
Oracle was involved with the rollout of healthcare.gov, and the failure of healthcare.gov was pinned

25:00.940 --> 25:04.400
predominantly on Oracle software.

25:04.400 --> 25:11.540
And the things that sprung out from that failure, like the USG and 18F, are sort of thorns in

25:11.540 --> 25:15.840
Oracle's side, because they've involved bringing in a lot of Silicon Valley people that have

25:15.840 --> 25:20.080
new modern ideas about the way to do business, and Oracle doesn't like that very much.

25:20.080 --> 25:22.920
Well, they're very much old world, aren't they?

25:22.920 --> 25:27.240
It's not a surprise that they're not interested in these new ways of doing things, because

25:27.240 --> 25:31.680
they just have this old-fashioned view that things should be proprietary and locked down,

25:31.680 --> 25:36.720
and these huge contracts and huge bloated bits of software that they have complete control

25:36.720 --> 25:39.800
over, and all the standards are theirs.

25:39.800 --> 25:45.100
So it's no wonder that these new agile Silicon Valley types come in and want to use as much

25:45.100 --> 25:49.600
open source as possible, because let's face it, from a business point of view, it makes

25:49.600 --> 25:52.400
a lot of sense to use open source.

25:52.400 --> 25:57.120
For example, crypto, there's so much great open source crypto, why on earth would you

25:57.120 --> 26:00.960
write your own, paying engineers to write and maintain your own, when you can just use

26:00.960 --> 26:02.180
open source?

26:02.180 --> 26:07.440
You can just pull in all these open source libraries that make writing of your own software

26:07.440 --> 26:08.440
way cheaper.

26:08.440 --> 26:11.040
Yeah, absolutely true.

26:11.040 --> 26:16.440
Oracle kind of feels like a dying breed here, of an older technology, Silicon Valley era,

26:16.440 --> 26:19.840
when things were just different.

26:19.840 --> 26:23.700
Software was delivered differently, software was created differently, the investment into

26:23.700 --> 26:28.160
create that software was completely different, and now a transition is taking place, and

26:28.160 --> 26:31.280
the federal government finds themselves sort of in the middle of this transition.

26:31.280 --> 26:37.440
What you really need, Joe, is a way to give the power to the people, like a good Bitcoin

26:37.440 --> 26:38.920
fork can do.

26:38.920 --> 26:42.480
Oh man, yet another.

26:42.480 --> 26:46.360
Yet another Bitcoin gold this time.

26:46.360 --> 26:49.360
I don't know how seriously to take this one.

26:49.360 --> 26:54.720
I think it's worth discussing in a kind of broader sense of, this is the second one,

26:54.720 --> 27:00.720
and there's another one pending in November, and you've just ended up with more and more

27:00.720 --> 27:07.120
forks of Bitcoin, and these hard forks that mean that you can use your old Bitcoin however

27:07.120 --> 27:08.880
many Bitcoin you had before.

27:08.880 --> 27:16.720
You've now got instantly that many Bitcoin gold or Bitcoin cash, but it just seems to

27:16.720 --> 27:23.340
me that the more forks we have here, the more legitimacy the original has in a weird way,

27:23.340 --> 27:29.720
because you've got all this fragmentation happening with the rest of it, but then the

27:29.720 --> 27:35.320
old-fashioned original Bitcoin just keeps chugging along and going, well, whatever guys,

27:35.320 --> 27:38.240
they're worth a bunch.

27:38.240 --> 27:42.160
You know, I look at this and I think maybe what we're seeing is a shift, actually.

27:42.160 --> 27:43.520
Nothing really new, but a shift.

27:43.520 --> 27:50.180
So when years ago, when Bitcoin was the hot topic, just proper Bitcoin, you had Litecoin

27:50.180 --> 27:56.920
and Dogecoin and a lot of other coins, and now what we seem to be having is forks of

27:56.920 --> 27:58.040
Bitcoin.

27:58.040 --> 28:01.920
So it's sort of the same thing, a bunch of competing cryptocurrencies, but now we're

28:01.920 --> 28:04.520
all just forking Bitcoin instead.

28:04.520 --> 28:08.640
And I'm kind of getting sick and tired of it and I'm finding it hard to track.

28:08.640 --> 28:13.240
However, that said, Bitcoin gold has one thing about it that I like.

28:13.240 --> 28:15.140
It's a memory-hard algorithm.

28:15.140 --> 28:23.240
It's more like Ethereum or Litecoin in that it can be actually computed by average everyday

28:23.240 --> 28:24.400
GPUs.

28:24.400 --> 28:28.240
And the best part about Bitcoin for me was when I was all in on mining.

28:28.240 --> 28:31.600
I had Linux rigs up the wazoo mining coins.

28:31.600 --> 28:34.920
I was heating my studio using machines.

28:34.920 --> 28:38.400
It was the most fun I had with Bitcoin was when I could actually mine.

28:38.400 --> 28:44.040
Plus, then you feel like you're participating in the swarm by authorizing and confirming

28:44.040 --> 28:45.320
transactions.

28:45.320 --> 28:47.340
You feel like you're actually participating.

28:47.340 --> 28:49.000
And that's what Bitcoin gold is going for.

28:49.000 --> 28:50.560
That's what Litecoin is going for.

28:50.560 --> 28:54.280
They're using these algorithms or they're using these math problems that are memory

28:54.280 --> 28:58.840
hard that work better for hardware that the average folk have, and it's going to be fun.

28:58.840 --> 29:04.360
Now I kind of see this shaking out, though, in a way where you can use all these Bitcoin

29:04.360 --> 29:09.800
derivatives to generate some revenue, but really the money is going to be made in selling

29:09.800 --> 29:11.600
them to buy actual Bitcoin proper.

29:11.600 --> 29:17.520
Well, yeah, when I got into mining for a brief period, when I had a reasonable AMD card,

29:17.520 --> 29:18.520
that's what everyone was doing.

29:18.520 --> 29:24.720
They would mine Doge or they'd mine Litecoin specifically to then trade that for Bitcoin.

29:24.720 --> 29:27.120
And so Bitcoin is the original.

29:27.120 --> 29:29.520
It's the Coke or the Pepsi or whatever.

29:29.520 --> 29:32.980
It is the original, the name you know.

29:32.980 --> 29:38.740
So all these other ones, maybe they have hopes of becoming more valuable, but if they do,

29:38.740 --> 29:44.240
it's just dreaming because Bitcoin is just going to be the one that makes the money.

29:44.240 --> 29:48.360
And I just don't see the point of forking it to make it easier to mine because why not

29:48.360 --> 29:51.560
just mine Litecoin in that case?

29:51.560 --> 29:56.800
If you want something that's script-based and therefore can be mined on a GPU still

29:56.800 --> 30:01.640
rather than read these ridiculous expensive ASICs, then just mine them.

30:01.640 --> 30:08.240
And the thing is that one of the key people behind Bitcoin Gold is the CEO of Lightning

30:08.240 --> 30:13.080
ASIC, who is a company that just, oh, they just happened to sell the ASIC that is perfect

30:13.080 --> 30:14.320
for this.

30:14.320 --> 30:19.120
So it just feels like a cash grab and just more of this Ponzi scheme style to me.

30:19.120 --> 30:20.120
Right.

30:20.120 --> 30:21.120
It's a little concerning.

30:21.120 --> 30:24.840
Each time they launch a new fork, it just feels like another way to earn a quick buck

30:24.840 --> 30:28.840
and then sell it and actually buy a real Bitcoin or trade it for something else.

30:28.840 --> 30:36.040
And it's this perfect, every time one ride ends, be it Litecoin or whatever Bitcoin fork,

30:36.040 --> 30:37.240
you just launch another one.

30:37.240 --> 30:40.580
And as long as you have a good justification and there's a new fancy shining technology

30:40.580 --> 30:43.820
to try out, you get enough suckers on board.

30:43.820 --> 30:47.940
It spikes, you make a bunch of money, you sell, and then you just do the next thing.

30:47.940 --> 30:51.200
And it is starting to feel a bit of like a scam over and over and over again.

30:51.200 --> 30:52.640
Yeah, it is.

30:52.640 --> 30:57.000
The one thing I will say about Bitcoin Gold that seems a little strange, and I can see

30:57.000 --> 31:02.140
the both the positives and the negatives, but it is going to absolutely be confusing,

31:02.140 --> 31:08.180
is they're using the same address for Bitcoin and for Bitcoin Gold.

31:08.180 --> 31:12.320
And you already have some reports when this has happened with other forks where people

31:12.320 --> 31:17.060
accidentally send Bitcoin to a Bitcoin derivative and they just lose it forever.

31:17.060 --> 31:20.800
It's just gone or vice versa, because the address spaces are exactly the same.

31:20.800 --> 31:22.720
They look like the same scheme.

31:22.720 --> 31:26.840
Yeah, but they are planning to sort that out, but not for launch, which doesn't make any

31:26.840 --> 31:27.840
sense.

31:27.840 --> 31:28.840
I know.

31:28.840 --> 31:29.840
That's a kind of a red flag as well.

31:29.840 --> 31:30.840
I agree.

31:30.840 --> 31:31.840
That does seem like a red flag.

31:31.840 --> 31:32.840
So the whole thing is very strange.

31:32.840 --> 31:37.760
And yet it is the cross that we must bear, Joe, hashtag first world problems.

31:37.760 --> 31:38.760
Very much so.

31:38.760 --> 31:39.760
Yes.

31:39.760 --> 31:44.220
