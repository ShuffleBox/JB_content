00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,900
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, episode 229, recorded on February 23rd, 2022.

2
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:10,900
I'm Chris.

3
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:11,900
And I'm Wes.

4
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:12,900
Hello, Wes.

5
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:15,120
Let's do the news.

6
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:25,000
We start with the next generation of the TrueNAS platform, TrueNAS Scale 2202 has been released.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:35,220
Unlike FreeNAS and TrueNAS 13, though, Scale is based on Linux, Debian Linux, to be specific.

8
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:40,520
When IX Systems announced that back in the summer of 2020, it's kind of a big deal, right?

9
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:43,360
Because they were really seen as a BSD shop.

10
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:48,120
And I remember them explaining some of the motivations and then mentioning KVM virtualization

11
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:53,000
was in there, Docker container support and Kubernetes support, those things were all

12
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,360
mentioned, but it just seemed like, wow, what a radical idea.

13
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:02,040
But as time has gone on and the team has worked on this project, it's just made more and more

14
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:05,160
sense and they've hit their milestones now.

15
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:06,960
It's great to see this release.

16
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:12,200
You know, we certainly like the BSDs here at Linux Action News, but there's no arguing

17
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:17,560
that if you want to do more than just storage, you know, run some applications, well, the

18
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:22,460
industry kind of expects things like Docker and Kubernetes these days.

19
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:26,780
And for Scale, well, IX Systems had to put in some work to migrate all their old app

20
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:32,280
capabilities that were using FreeBSD's jails over to their new Kubernetes infrastructure

21
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:38,320
that's powered by their own version of Helm charts called TrueCharts.

22
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:41,900
It's not all just taking of Linux goodies, though.

23
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:49,320
They're pretty proud that they added NFS v4 Windows style ACLs to open ZFS on Linux.

24
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:53,880
By default, Linux only has sort of more limited POSIX ACLs, but if you're going to use this

25
00:01:53,880 --> 00:02:00,080
thing as a robust storage solution for primarily Windows hosts, as many do, well, you're going

26
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:02,280
to want fancy ACLs.

27
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:03,360
That's actually really great.

28
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:09,800
I have done crazy things like run RiserFS on top of SUSE to get ACL support.

29
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:15,320
I ran Gen2 for a while to get extended attribute support for Windows clients.

30
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:17,480
I moved mountains, Wes, I moved mountains.

31
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:24,440
It's also noteworthy that IX Systems is still keeping TrueNAS 13, which is based on FreeBSD.

32
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:28,320
It's still in production, and they still have it in their product lineup.

33
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:34,240
In fact, they've got some terms to help customers pick which TrueNAS is best for them.

34
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:42,000
They have the TrueNAS 13 scale up storage product, and now they have TrueNAS Scale 2202,

35
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,880
which they say is a scale out hyper converged product.

36
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:51,480
I think one is build storage up and one is scale out the actual application platform

37
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:54,000
horizontally is how I read that.

38
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:00,400
Yeah, with scale, they're actually integrating the Gluster file system on top of OpenZFS

39
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:04,680
to sort of let you do exactly that kind of scaling out, which we haven't really seen

40
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:07,240
before in the TrueNAS product line.

41
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:12,080
All of this is a really compelling grouping of stuff, and so we are absolutely going to

42
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:17,520
spend some time with this in studio and give it a full test on the future Linux unplugs.

43
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:23,840
Keep an eye out for that, but I'm impressed, and I can clearly see this addressing the

44
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:24,840
scale part.

45
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:29,720
I mean, TrueNAS is a wide product range, but the scale aspect now based on Linux, I would

46
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:36,080
really love to deploy this at previous clients of mine that have 20 to 200 people.

47
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:41,080
They maybe buy one small business server that runs at their operation, and it's maybe their

48
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:42,200
directory.

49
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:43,800
It is their file server.

50
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:47,440
This is less and less common these days, but there's still millions of them out there,

51
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:51,640
millions of them, and now you could put something in there that's modern.

52
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:53,160
It's easily supportable.

53
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:54,320
It's easy to expand it.

54
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:58,360
It can run all the different applications you need, and then also on the on the enthusiast

55
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:02,700
side of the market, I could see this slowly eating away at the QNAP and Synology markets

56
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:07,800
out there, at least on their high end, because the capabilities of this unit are going to

57
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:13,840
be way more than the capabilities of those appliance units, and they've also just invested

58
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:17,920
a ton in the UI, which is available on some of their other products, so they've got like

59
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:25,120
a lot of R&D going into all aspects of this, and as a Linux user, I'm really excited now

60
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:27,400
that they have a Linux based offering.

61
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:33,160
I've been a FreeNAS fan before, but I ultimately migrated away because it was BSD based, and

62
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:35,240
my skill set is in Linux.

63
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:39,440
Although that might just mean you feel a little too confident about getting into that low

64
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:45,600
level system shell and messing things up.

65
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:49,200
Often when we talk to developers building tools out in the real world, or sometimes

66
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:53,140
on the surface of Mars, they almost always tell us the same thing.

67
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:57,160
They're actually running their gear that's based on Linux with the pre-amped RT real-time

68
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:58,720
kernel patches.

69
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:04,800
Well, the group behind that patch that has recently been acquired by Intel.

70
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:08,720
In a statement on that acquisition, Intel said, quote,

71
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:14,120
Linutronics is comprised of a team of highly qualified and motivated employees with a wealth

72
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:19,040
of experience and involvement in the ongoing development of Linux.

73
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:25,640
Led by CEO Heinz Eiger and CTO Thomas Kleiksner, Linutronics is the architect of pre-amped

74
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:31,040
RT and the leading technology provider for industrial Linux.

75
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:36,400
Particularly noteworthy is that Kleiksner has been the principal maintainer of the x86

76
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:41,680
architecture in the kernel all the way back since 2008.

77
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:44,240
Intel went on to say that, quote,

78
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:48,920
By acquiring Linutronics, we're deepening our longstanding relationship with a highly

79
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:53,760
respected team of globally recognized Linux experts, adding to the remarkable breadth

80
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:57,000
and depth of Intel's hardware and software talent.

81
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:02,440
Linutronics will continue to operate as an independent business within our software division,

82
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:04,840
led by Eiger and Kleiksner.

83
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:05,960
There's no way around it.

84
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:08,320
This is a huge get for Intel.

85
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:11,840
And it's noteworthy that they're specifically calling out that it's going to remain an independent

86
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:14,480
business unit within the software division.

87
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:20,960
So it's a department inside a department that likely reports to a lead.

88
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:24,840
But nonetheless, I think this is actually a good move.

89
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:26,560
Intel has been a good steward of the kernel.

90
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:29,160
There has been some rough patches.

91
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,160
There has been a few issues.

92
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:33,760
But that's pretty normal when you look at the scope and depth of what Intel's involved

93
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:34,760
in.

94
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:36,840
And they participated with the kernel team for a long time.

95
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:44,200
And it's also noteworthy that back in June of 2021, the team was seeing some funding

96
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:45,640
issues, right?

97
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:50,080
And so it's conceivable that they got to a point where they needed to get some kind

98
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:51,080
of acquisition.

99
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:55,280
So it may mean that now they get paid to do this full time.

100
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:57,960
And this could be a good benefit for them as well.

101
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:00,960
So overall, I can see a lot of positive upshot to this.

102
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:04,320
And then I think the other thing that gives me some peace of mind is I don't see any kernel

103
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:06,400
developers freaking out about it right now.

104
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:07,680
They all seem pretty pleased.

105
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:13,360
No, hopefully this just means more robust preempt RT support for a long time in the

106
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:16,360
future.

107
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:21,640
Podman 4.0 came out this week and the new version supports a new network stack while

108
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:23,560
keeping compatibility with the old stack.

109
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:24,560
So don't worry.

110
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:25,560
It uses Netivark.

111
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:29,200
It's a Rust based network stack for containers.

112
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:31,720
Now don't worry if you're not ready.

113
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:34,800
Only new installs of Podman will be getting Netivark by default.

114
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:39,560
You'll still be using OCI networking if you previously were using Podman.

115
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:46,120
Another big focus for Podman 4.0 was improving the Podman experience on non Linux operating

116
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:47,120
systems.

117
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:52,060
Yes, yes, I know we try not to mention them, but Windows and Mac OS do exist.

118
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:56,860
Support for Podman on those platforms is enabled by Podman Machine, which somewhat like how

119
00:07:56,860 --> 00:08:01,160
Docker Desktop does it, basically creates and manages a virtual machine under the hood

120
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:03,840
that actually runs all your containers.

121
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:11,080
Now Podman Machine is not new in this release, but it has seen some really nice improvements.

122
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:16,880
Particularly that Podman Machine now automatically mounts the Podman API socket to your host

123
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:17,880
system.

124
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:24,480
So if you're using the regular Docker CLI or, important for our use cases, Docker Compose,

125
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:30,680
you can just point that at the Podman socket, forget about Docker, perhaps entirely.

126
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:36,520
Another nice improvement is WSL2 support on Windows.

127
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:41,500
This means that instead of creating a QEMU based virtual machine, Podman can hook into

128
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:45,840
the Windows subsystem for Linux directly and get all the nice features that Microsoft's

129
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:48,040
been baking in there.

130
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:50,280
Now it's not all quite good news.

131
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:55,440
One thing I was hoping to see in 4.0 was support for volume mounts from the host.

132
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:59,880
I want my containers to be able to interact with the files I might have on my Mac or Windows

133
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:01,360
desktop.

134
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:09,360
We didn't get that with 4.0, but sounds like that's coming in version 4.1.

135
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:14,040
This week, the executive director of the GNOME Foundation gave us a heads up that his term

136
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:15,720
is coming to an end.

137
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:20,240
Neil McGovern has been there nearly five years and he's decided the timing is right to step

138
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:23,000
back from GNOME and start looking for its next leader.

139
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,920
It's been an interesting five years though.

140
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:29,160
As a foundation, they've gone from a small team of just about three to now employing

141
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:34,320
people to work on marketing, investment in technical frameworks, conference organization,

142
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,000
and really a lot more.

143
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:41,800
And of course, during this time, GNOME has become the default on many major Linux distributions.

144
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:46,960
And something I've watched blossom while Neil has been the executive director is Flathub.

145
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:52,240
Even if they just as a project just help them, encourage them, it's been great to see this

146
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:56,120
flourish and now it gives developers a way to publish applications directly to their

147
00:09:56,120 --> 00:10:00,560
users and for users like me to discover applications on a daily basis.

148
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:02,940
All powered by free software.

149
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:05,800
Of course, it hasn't all been fun and games.

150
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:10,920
During his tenure, Neil also helped the foundation deal with patent suits, trademark disputes,

151
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:12,440
and by-law changes.

152
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:18,160
He also helped oversee the move of the entire GNOME development platform to GitLab, while

153
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:26,280
at the same time seeing 10 new GNOME releases, the development of GTK4, and of course a monumental

154
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:29,000
release itself in GNOME 40.

155
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:33,260
If you're curious to hear a little bit about his perspective, well, this here show did

156
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:38,860
an interview with Neil back in Linux Action News 182, which we'll have linked in the show

157
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:39,860
notes.

158
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:43,360
It's also noteworthy that GNOME 42 beta landed this week.

159
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:45,000
This is a feature freeze release.

160
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,760
This is a great one to help the team track down last minute bugs.

161
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:52,520
A lot of big core components have been ported to GTK4.

162
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:57,560
Dark theme support, like real dark theme support has been added to several applications now.

163
00:10:57,560 --> 00:11:00,280
GNOME Shell and Mudder also see a lot of changes and improvements.

164
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:03,100
What I'm saying is big things have landed.

165
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:08,080
It's definitely worth testing and this is going to be a very special version of GNOME.

166
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:12,960
Well, we've been following this next story for a little while and it actually looks like

167
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:17,120
the hardware side of all of the rumors is getting really close.

168
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:23,400
So back in January of 2020, Google said it would bring Steam to Chromebooks.

169
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:26,840
And now it seems like that plan is really starting to get close.

170
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:35,360
Yeah, it appears that HP, Lenovo, Acer, and Asus are going to be releasing some gaming

171
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:41,240
focused Chromebooks using Project Borealis, which is Google's code name for bringing

172
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:43,760
Steam support to Chrome OS.

173
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:49,540
9to5Google has been doing some excellent work sleuthing around in the code base and according

174
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:55,880
to a developer comment from January, Google now has firm timelines for when this stuff

175
00:11:55,880 --> 00:12:01,400
actually needs to ship and we maybe have some requirements for what your Chromebook would

176
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:09,360
need, which include an 11th gen Intel Core i5 or i7 and a minimum of 7 gigs of RAM, which

177
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:14,840
kind of eliminates all but those Chromebooks that are really in the upper mid or high end

178
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:15,840
range.

179
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:21,320
Another interesting little tidbit about this is that Nvidia appears to be directly involved

180
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:25,920
with the development of Steam support on Chrome OS with some of the code changes actually

181
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:29,360
being developed and submitted by Nvidia employees.

182
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:34,920
I can't say I really understand what's going on, but it'll certainly be interesting to

183
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:41,800
see how Google's plans for Chrome OS continue to play out.

184
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:43,720
Linode.com slash LAN.

185
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:48,080
Linode makes cloud computing simple, affordable, and accessible and when you go to Linode.com

186
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:53,680
slash LAN, you'll get $100 in 60 day credit on a new account and you can go there to support

187
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:54,920
the show.

188
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:56,840
Linode is fast and reliable.

189
00:12:56,840 --> 00:13:02,400
Put simply, it's the only place we host user facing content machines like our systems that

190
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:04,660
are designed to serve you up stuff.

191
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:11,080
Anything we build, we put it up on Linode and now that Linode has upgraded to MVME storage,

192
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:13,440
your systems can fly on there.

193
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:16,220
I mean, you'll get performance like you've never seen before.

194
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:21,000
You can get massive parallelism with MVME drives and so if you've got a database, something

195
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:25,600
that helps maybe like, I don't know, keep track of user information or backend stuff

196
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:29,000
that has a lot of IOPS, you might want to look at that.

197
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,640
In fact, Linode's support, which is excellent, can also help you work through these kinds

198
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:33,640
of things.

199
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:37,360
They've got a range of systems that you can pick depending on what your needs are.

200
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:39,800
And don't worry, it's all simple and easy to sort through.

201
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:44,200
They've been doing this for 19 years and they just keep getting better and better.

202
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:48,180
And now they're powered by Akamai, so it's going to get taken to the next level.

203
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:49,520
Go try it for yourself.

204
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:53,560
It's real, it's here, and you can get $100 in credit while you support the show.

205
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:58,480
Linode.com slash LAN.

206
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:01,920
And a big thank you to Ting, linux.ting.com.

207
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:03,640
Go there and take $25 off.

208
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:05,920
This is my cell phone provider.

209
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:08,680
I've been a customer since 2013.

210
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:10,760
It's just a simpler way to do mobile.

211
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:14,340
Ting is an MVNO or a mobile virtual network operator.

212
00:14:14,340 --> 00:14:16,600
They run on top of the carrier networks.

213
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:21,720
They interface with those awful duopolies and create a meta company that is great to

214
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:25,520
work with, that is customer focused and has fantastic support.

215
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:31,040
And I can say that because again, I've been a customer since 2013 and their plans are

216
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:32,040
simple.

217
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:33,760
Go to linux.ting.com, review them.

218
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:36,320
They got one that's going to work for everybody.

219
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:39,760
Really it's a great option for small businesses and family too.

220
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:45,400
Often I talk about the individual possibility to save, but if you've got like five or more

221
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:49,600
lines, the savings could really add up with Ting.

222
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:53,920
It's tremendous and every plan gets access to Ting's award-winning customer service with

223
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:56,500
nationwide LTE and 5G.

224
00:14:56,500 --> 00:15:01,440
And of course, Ting just recently was named the number one carrier by Consumer Reports

225
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:02,940
in 2021.

226
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:06,340
So it's simple to switch to Ting and there's no contracts ever.

227
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:09,840
And pretty much any phone's going to work because of Ting's multi-network support.

228
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:14,220
So just go to linux.ting.com, check your current phone, create an account and pick the plan

229
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:15,220
that's right for you.

230
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:18,040
Ting will send you a SIM card, you pop that in your phone and you're going to get activated

231
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:19,040
in minutes.

232
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:23,280
It happened so quick, you won't believe you weren't saving money earlier than this.

233
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:24,520
You can thank me later.

234
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:28,440
Go to linux.ting.com.

235
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:35,200
We bring you back to reality just for a moment to tell you about a new Linux-powered virtual

236
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:37,820
reality device.

237
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:44,360
It's called the Simula One and it's a full portable Linux computer built right into a

238
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:46,920
VR headset.

239
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:53,720
Powered by WL Roots and the open source Godot game engine with NixOS under the hood.

240
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:57,800
And best of all, it's not made by Meta.

241
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:58,800
No it is not.

242
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:03,320
In fact, the team behind it has been working on this for about four years.

243
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:08,600
And one of the things that really makes this headset stand out from all of the other VR

244
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:12,440
headsets on the market, besides the fact that it has a Linux box strapped to it, is the

245
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:21,000
super high resolution screen, 35.5 pixel per degree, with a real focus on making your VR

246
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
terminals look good.

247
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:27,040
Yeah, I'm talking your text terminal in VR because the team stresses they are focused

248
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:31,680
on work and productivity, not gaming.

249
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:35,120
Now this thing also features a detachable computer so you can actually take that Linux

250
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:40,580
box off and then dock it on a desktop unit at some point in the future.

251
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:45,000
And I have to say it is actually kind of nice to see some Linux action in this VR space

252
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:50,220
because so far this has really been felt like it's been dominated by commercial players.

253
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:53,880
Which speaking of, I tried one this weekend for the first time.

254
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:58,140
So if I would have seen this news story last week, I would have been Mr. Skeptical pants

255
00:16:58,140 --> 00:16:59,140
on here.

256
00:16:59,140 --> 00:17:04,940
I would have told you the price is outrageous, the idea is silly, I can just get monitors,

257
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:06,920
all that kind of stuff.

258
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:11,440
But I just happened to actually try a virtual work environment this weekend.

259
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:16,160
And I have changed my tune a little bit.

260
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:21,640
Having unlimited monitors at any size is like a utopia for me.

261
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:27,920
Sitting here right now recording this, I have one, two, three, four, five physical screens.

262
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:32,480
And that's not even counting like meters and stuff like that, spectrum analyzers, I'm just

263
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:34,360
talking computer screens.

264
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:38,960
And I mean, we definitely want a few more in the studio if we had anywhere to put them.

265
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:39,960
I really would.

266
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:43,720
And like when I'm recording shows with remote hosts, I'd love to do that in a virtual studio

267
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:44,720
environment.

268
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:48,360
And this is where it really started to click for me, is when I realized at home, I have

269
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:52,960
a tiny home, a very small space, it's not a private space to work.

270
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:55,160
I can put on this VR headset.

271
00:17:55,160 --> 00:18:02,480
And I'm in a gigantic studio log cabin with a wood ceiling, panoramic windows that look

272
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:07,320
down on a lake with fog, with rain that drips down those windows, and I've got a big blue

273
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:08,320
couch.

274
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:13,960
And I have got six ginormous, you know, 110 inch screens in front of me are running all

275
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:15,600
kinds of stuff.

276
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:19,440
And that's when I realized, man, I could take this virtual environment.

277
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:23,720
And I could go to the studio or I could, I could go to a hotel room, I can put on this

278
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:28,880
headset, and I am working right back in my infinite office, I can take my infinite office

279
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:30,560
with me everywhere.

280
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:34,940
But the missing piece was it needed to connect to a computer, I had to bring a laptop with

281
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:37,040
me, which just isn't super portable.

282
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:40,720
I mean, when I'm traveling, I'll just bring the laptop and that's good enough.

283
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:45,240
But with Simula, they put the Linux box in the headset.

284
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:47,020
That's the game changer.

285
00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:50,740
Having everything self contained, not being tethered to a full computer, but having the

286
00:18:50,740 --> 00:18:54,360
headset itself be a full computer.

287
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:56,840
That's a game changer when it comes to VR.

288
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:59,800
Now there's so much that's going to it's like the smartphone West, it's like you got to

289
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:03,880
have an ecosystem, it can't really just be a single purpose device.

290
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:06,160
So I'm still a bit skeptical here.

291
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:11,360
But man, it looks like the team has really worked hard on a really good software hardware

292
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:12,640
combination.

293
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:17,080
Everything checks the boxes I was looking at, it's got an i7 under the hood, it's going

294
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:21,840
to have 16 gigabytes of RAM, it'll have Intel Xe graphics.

295
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:26,180
So you know, you're going to have a really good desktop Linux experience with this thing.

296
00:19:26,180 --> 00:19:32,320
But I fear, West, this is one of those things you got to try to really appreciate.

297
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:38,120
And at this price point, I don't think enough people will be convinced on the premise to

298
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:39,120
go all in.

299
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:41,280
What do you think?

300
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:46,960
You know, I do share some of your concerns a lot about VR right now has has social aspects.

301
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:51,840
And as you say, many are not convinced about the possibilities here.

302
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:55,480
I can see what they're getting at though, you know, longer term, we may have multiple

303
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:59,960
VR systems, you might have one thing that your gaming setup, whereas you want a slightly

304
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:04,880
tweaked setup to get your sys admin or development job done during the day.

305
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:07,780
But yeah, it's pricey.

306
00:20:07,780 --> 00:20:12,640
So it's probably worth pointing out that you don't actually need this fancy new hardware

307
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:13,880
if you don't want it.

308
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:18,160
The underlying window manager and operating stuff, I mean, it's all out in the open and

309
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:24,520
Simula, that customized environment built on top of Godot, well, it's officially compatible

310
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:27,800
with Steam VR headsets like the Valve Index.

311
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:31,880
There's experimental support for some open XR headsets.

312
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:36,640
And while this being Linux, some enterprising hackers have gotten it kind of working with

313
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:42,740
the Oculus Rift S. But that hardware does look really nice.

314
00:20:42,740 --> 00:20:47,800
And if you'd like to see these initial takes at Linux VR continue, you may want to consider

315
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:48,800
supporting it.

316
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:53,360
They're working on a Kickstarter, hoping to raise 2.5 million.

317
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:56,000
We'll have a link in the show notes.

318
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,200
I mean, that's not an impossible goal.

319
00:20:58,200 --> 00:20:59,280
We'll see where it goes.

320
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:05,080
