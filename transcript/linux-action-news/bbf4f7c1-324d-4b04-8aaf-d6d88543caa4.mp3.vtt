00:00.000 --> 00:16.280
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, our weekly take on Linux and the open source world.

00:16.280 --> 00:19.920
This is episode 70, recorded on September 8th, 2018.

00:19.920 --> 00:20.920
I'm Joe.

00:20.920 --> 00:21.920
And I'm Wes.

00:21.920 --> 00:22.920
Hello, Wes.

00:22.920 --> 00:25.080
Thank you very much for joining me again while the boss is still away.

00:25.080 --> 00:26.880
He's back soon, don't worry.

00:26.880 --> 00:31.200
But let's get straight on with it and talk about GNOME 3.30 that's being released.

00:31.200 --> 00:33.840
I understand that you've actually managed to get this going on Arch.

00:33.840 --> 00:36.960
Yes, of course, it's already available in testing.

00:36.960 --> 00:41.800
I'm sure it'll be released into the main repository sometime very soon.

00:41.800 --> 00:44.940
Until then, you can go install it if you want or go install it on some of the other places

00:44.940 --> 00:46.360
that have it available.

00:46.360 --> 00:50.600
If you like GNOME already, it's just more of the same stuff you already love.

00:50.600 --> 00:54.040
Unfortunately, I wasn't able to try this out because I'm not going to the lengths of

00:54.040 --> 00:57.520
installing Arch, even Antigos, no, thank you very much.

00:57.520 --> 01:02.460
But what I've done traditionally is download the live CD, which was based on Debian and

01:02.460 --> 01:04.760
previous releases had that but there wasn't one for this.

01:04.760 --> 01:08.760
So unfortunately, it's just screenshots and descriptions for me.

01:08.760 --> 01:11.040
But it's a fairly big deal.

01:11.040 --> 01:17.280
They talk about it being six months of hard work and nearly 25,000 changes by over 800

01:17.280 --> 01:18.280
contributors.

01:18.280 --> 01:19.840
So it's a fairly big deal.

01:19.840 --> 01:20.840
Absolutely.

01:20.840 --> 01:25.080
One of the things I'm really excited about is the new Thunderbolt panel to manage devices

01:25.080 --> 01:27.080
and it dynamically shows hardware.

01:27.080 --> 01:30.840
I'll just show you stuff when you need to know it and it's not there when you don't.

01:30.840 --> 01:31.840
Super streamlined.

01:31.840 --> 01:35.200
And I don't know about you, Joe, but I have more and more Thunderbolt peripherals all

01:35.200 --> 01:36.200
the time.

01:36.200 --> 01:37.440
I don't think I have any Thunderbolt peripherals.

01:37.440 --> 01:39.240
Well, you're behind the times, Joe.

01:39.240 --> 01:40.240
Come on now.

01:40.240 --> 01:43.260
I know I need to get myself sorted with that.

01:43.260 --> 01:46.640
But one thing I noticed about this release announcement, you think of GNOME and you think

01:46.640 --> 01:52.200
about free software rather than open source, you think of GNU and, you know, copyleft and

01:52.200 --> 01:54.440
very much the freedom side of things.

01:54.440 --> 01:57.440
And you don't necessarily associate that with pragmatism.

01:57.440 --> 02:03.540
But Boxes, which is their virtual machine application, can now connect to remote Windows

02:03.540 --> 02:08.520
servers using RDP, which, yeah, I mean, it's all free software that's running it.

02:08.520 --> 02:11.880
But it shows a real kind of pragmatic approach there, doesn't it?

02:11.880 --> 02:14.760
Yeah, that's probably a real world use case people have.

02:14.760 --> 02:19.840
And it's not directly related to running, you know, VMs, open source or free software

02:19.840 --> 02:23.000
VMs on your local workstation whatsoever.

02:23.000 --> 02:27.720
But it might be one of those helpful tools that means you can run free software on your

02:27.720 --> 02:30.560
workstation and still do a lot of your day job.

02:30.560 --> 02:33.080
Another thing I noticed is they've got a podcast app now.

02:33.080 --> 02:37.040
And in the screenshot for this, I noticed a few podcasts that I recognized.

02:37.040 --> 02:38.040
Late Night Linux.

02:38.040 --> 02:39.040
Hmm, I think that's quite good.

02:39.040 --> 02:41.080
Ubuntu podcasts, that's not bad.

02:41.080 --> 02:43.160
Destination Linux.

02:43.160 --> 02:45.720
But no Ubuntu broadcasting stuff, what's going on, guys?

02:45.720 --> 02:51.200
I am confused and outraged, but I'm also a little excited about this new app.

02:51.200 --> 02:54.140
Do you listen to many podcasts on your desktop?

02:54.140 --> 02:56.800
Because for me, it's very much a phone based activity for me.

02:56.800 --> 02:58.840
I would say it's about half and half.

02:58.840 --> 03:03.540
I also end up playing a lot of podcasts through my TV slash sound system, but I control that

03:03.540 --> 03:05.640
primarily through my desktop.

03:05.640 --> 03:07.400
Phone is really only used in the car.

03:07.400 --> 03:08.920
Okay, fair enough.

03:08.920 --> 03:11.960
It's good to have it baked right into the desktop, though, so you know that you're going

03:11.960 --> 03:18.440
to have proper integration with the volume control and skipping tracks and everything.

03:18.440 --> 03:21.760
So yeah, I could see myself using this if I was using GNOME, definitely.

03:21.760 --> 03:25.800
Right, I don't expect it to be the most full featured podcast client or anything close

03:25.800 --> 03:29.600
to it, but if you just want something that's simple, works, and makes it easy right after

03:29.600 --> 03:34.740
installation to get going and start listening again to your favorite shows, this is a hit.

03:34.740 --> 03:37.240
Another thing, even more games.

03:37.240 --> 03:38.880
Games the retro gaming application.

03:38.880 --> 03:43.280
I can't say I'm have much time for that these days, but what about you?

03:43.280 --> 03:44.840
Are you tempted by this?

03:44.840 --> 03:45.960
Yes, I am.

03:45.960 --> 03:47.880
It looks pretty neat.

03:47.880 --> 03:51.700
And there's the Flatpak bundle now includes four more emulator cores.

03:51.700 --> 03:56.480
So there's even a larger collection than they had before, which is already pretty significant.

03:56.480 --> 03:59.300
This is about the only gaming I do have time for.

03:59.300 --> 04:02.820
Some of these are classics that many of us have been playing for years.

04:02.820 --> 04:06.680
And it's great that again, you know, you think about free software on the GNOME desktop,

04:06.680 --> 04:11.040
but this is another pragmatic use case, maybe not for business applications, but for that

04:11.040 --> 04:12.640
all important leisure time.

04:12.640 --> 04:14.160
Well, you mentioned Flatpak there.

04:14.160 --> 04:18.640
And we talked a few episodes ago about Flatpak reaching 1.0.

04:18.640 --> 04:21.520
And of course, that is in this version of GNOME.

04:21.520 --> 04:24.540
So you've got proper stable Flatpaks now, it's a first class citizen.

04:24.540 --> 04:25.540
It's about time.

04:25.540 --> 04:28.400
I think there's a lot of us in the community that's been playing with Flatpaks.

04:28.400 --> 04:32.880
But this is a milestone release, and it means it's going to be a significant part of future

04:32.880 --> 04:34.600
desktops to come.

04:34.600 --> 04:36.240
What about stability then?

04:36.240 --> 04:42.460
GNOME, one of the criticisms that I hear often leveled at it is that it tends to crash quite

04:42.460 --> 04:43.960
a lot.

04:43.960 --> 04:45.920
Any improvements there that you've noticed?

04:45.920 --> 04:48.880
You know, I really haven't used it enough to see that.

04:48.880 --> 04:52.280
At least on my simple systems, you know, not anything I'm using as a desktop replacement

04:52.280 --> 04:56.720
or a real workstation powerhouse, GNOME has been rock solid for me.

04:56.720 --> 05:00.680
So I think it's really only when you stress it out at workloads, maybe they're not really

05:00.680 --> 05:04.880
thinking of or are a little unfortunately beyond the architecture at this point that

05:04.880 --> 05:09.880
I've seen problems, and I just haven't evaluated 3.30 on that type of system yet.

05:09.880 --> 05:13.920
I remember the OBS machine crashing quite a lot in the studio.

05:13.920 --> 05:17.200
I suppose that's an example of stressing it quite a lot.

05:17.200 --> 05:22.400
So yeah, it'd be good to see if this has become less crashy, because that seems to be the

05:22.400 --> 05:25.560
primary criticism that people level at it.

05:25.560 --> 05:29.280
And it's absolutely a feature you need in a desktop you're going to use for anything

05:29.280 --> 05:30.280
serious.

05:30.280 --> 05:33.200
Well, any serious web browsing you're going to do, surely you're going to use the Tor

05:33.200 --> 05:34.200
browser.

05:34.200 --> 05:35.200
Well, of course.

05:35.200 --> 05:38.320
I mean, I don't want people spying on what I'm doing on the internet, Joe.

05:38.320 --> 05:41.120
You don't want to see that.

05:41.120 --> 05:45.920
So yeah, Tor browser 8.0 has been released, the first stable release based on Firefox

05:45.920 --> 05:47.960
6D ESR.

05:47.960 --> 05:49.440
And I've tried this out.

05:49.440 --> 05:53.360
And it is actually an improvement over the previous version, I must say.

05:53.360 --> 05:56.340
They talk a lot about their new onboarding experience.

05:56.340 --> 05:57.340
Did you go through that?

05:57.340 --> 05:58.340
I did.

05:58.340 --> 06:02.080
And that's what really impressed me with it, because there has been a bit of a barrier

06:02.080 --> 06:06.960
to entry because, okay, I understand how it all works with the onion routing.

06:06.960 --> 06:10.560
And you know, I understand about the relays and everything, but the average person who

06:10.560 --> 06:14.520
just wants to browse privately might not necessarily know that.

06:14.520 --> 06:18.800
And it lays it out in really clear terms about what exactly is happening in this kind of

06:18.800 --> 06:20.520
first run wizard.

06:20.520 --> 06:23.040
And you kind of go through it step by step.

06:23.040 --> 06:27.200
And so yes, I think that they are right to put that front and center in this release

06:27.200 --> 06:28.200
announcement.

06:28.200 --> 06:32.400
And it goes a long way to some of their goals and making this sort of technology available

06:32.400 --> 06:34.800
for anyone, not just computer experts.

06:34.800 --> 06:35.800
Well, yeah.

06:35.800 --> 06:38.360
And to that end, they've improved the language support as well.

06:38.360 --> 06:43.640
They've added Catalan, Irish, Indonesian, Icelandic, Norwegian, Danish, Hebrew, Swedish

06:43.640 --> 06:45.280
and traditional Chinese.

06:45.280 --> 06:48.720
They already had a fair few languages, so it's good to see them expanding that.

06:48.720 --> 06:50.680
An admirable goal for sure.

06:50.680 --> 06:53.600
Now it's not all roses here.

06:53.600 --> 06:57.680
WebGL is broken, for instance, and there are some rumors, there's some problems if you're

06:57.680 --> 06:59.120
using Mac OS.

06:59.120 --> 07:04.160
So make sure you go try maybe the latest alpha they've got with those issues fixed.

07:04.160 --> 07:05.160
What's Mac OS, Wes?

07:05.160 --> 07:07.200
I wouldn't understand about that sort of thing.

07:07.200 --> 07:10.280
But the WebGL thing, that's kind of a big deal, isn't it?

07:10.280 --> 07:14.240
You know, it just might mean any sort of problem like that is one use case where you have to

07:14.240 --> 07:16.000
go explore another option.

07:16.000 --> 07:19.920
Either you're setting up Tor manually, which takes a lot more work and knowledge, or you're

07:19.920 --> 07:23.480
just using a less secure and anonymous browser.

07:23.480 --> 07:25.480
Either way, it's not something you probably want to do.

07:25.480 --> 07:27.840
Hopefully they can get that fixed in an upcoming release.

07:27.840 --> 07:32.480
Now they've done a lot with the onboarding, and they've made this a very slick experience,

07:32.480 --> 07:35.700
except for when you actually try and browse the web with it.

07:35.700 --> 07:38.000
And that's not their fault at all.

07:38.000 --> 07:39.840
They've done everything they can.

07:39.840 --> 07:43.800
But the problem is that a lot of websites don't want you to be anonymous.

07:43.800 --> 07:48.480
They don't want you to use Tor, and so they make it almost impossible to actually interact

07:48.480 --> 07:50.000
with their sites.

07:50.000 --> 07:51.960
You have these endless capture loops.

07:51.960 --> 07:56.360
I tried with one website, and it just kept going round and round, wanting me to do buses

07:56.360 --> 08:01.500
and traffic lights, and just would not let me do what I wanted to do.

08:01.500 --> 08:03.040
And it's not Tor's fault.

08:03.040 --> 08:08.080
It's the rest of the web, but that doesn't make it any more usable on a day-to-day basis.

08:08.080 --> 08:09.080
That's disappointing.

08:09.080 --> 08:14.120
I know Cloudflare in particular is a company people are often upset about for those horrible

08:14.120 --> 08:15.120
captures.

08:15.120 --> 08:20.400
Unfortunately, yes, that is the real world, but if they can't solve that problem, they've

08:20.400 --> 08:24.060
gone a long way to solving a lot of others, and it's getting to the point I could actually

08:24.060 --> 08:28.420
recommend this to some people out there and think that they could actually use it without

08:28.420 --> 08:30.720
me having to hold their hand through the entire process.

08:30.720 --> 08:31.720
Oh, definitely.

08:31.720 --> 08:32.720
Yeah.

08:32.720 --> 08:35.840
And there are certainly some websites which work absolutely perfectly with it.

08:35.840 --> 08:40.720
I tried out the podcast sites of the various shows I'm on, and you can play those episodes,

08:40.720 --> 08:42.080
no problem.

08:42.080 --> 08:47.840
But it's just the kind of more complicated interactive sites that want to scrape your

08:47.840 --> 08:53.400
data that are not going to work, and, well, it's not a surprise, is it?

08:53.400 --> 08:59.680
But they've also, the Tor project, released an alpha of a Tor browser for Android, which

08:59.680 --> 09:03.640
is available on the Play Store, and you can download an APK directly.

09:03.640 --> 09:08.900
When we recorded this, it didn't seem to be available on F-Droid, hopefully soon.

09:08.900 --> 09:13.920
But you should know that this is really just a rebranding and a bringing in-house of the

09:13.920 --> 09:18.600
project known as Orfox, which is built from the same source code as the main Tor browser,

09:18.600 --> 09:21.760
which is, of course, itself based on Firefox.

09:21.760 --> 09:26.440
That project, Orfox, has been developed by the software collective The Guardian Project.

09:26.440 --> 09:32.400
Now that we've got the official version coming out in alpha, well, Orfox is kind of winding

09:32.400 --> 09:35.600
down in the future, just look for the Tor browser itself.

09:35.600 --> 09:39.680
Yeah, I think that's going to make it much simpler, because I have looked for the Tor

09:39.680 --> 09:44.160
browser before and found this Orfox thing and thought, do I trust this?

09:44.160 --> 09:49.640
If it's coming from the Tor project directly, it's called the Tor browser, I think it just

09:49.640 --> 09:55.320
clears up any confusion there and just makes it, again, an easier onboarding experience.

09:55.320 --> 09:56.320
Yeah, absolutely.

09:56.320 --> 10:01.200
The Android app, in this case, also features some tracker blocking tools to help just improve

10:01.200 --> 10:04.680
isolation from every website that you visit, so that's a nice tip.

10:04.680 --> 10:08.600
Yeah, and it works in very much the same way as Firefox on Android, because, well, that's

10:08.600 --> 10:09.600
what it's based on.

10:09.600 --> 10:13.720
If you're used to using Firefox, then it's not a huge transition to use a Tor browser.

10:13.720 --> 10:14.720
Exactly.

10:14.720 --> 10:18.280
Now, to actually connect to the Tor network with the Tor browser, you do need one more

10:18.280 --> 10:23.040
application and that's The Guardian Project's Orbot, which actually connects you to the

10:23.040 --> 10:26.740
Tor network and enables all of those awesome features.

10:26.740 --> 10:31.180
That sounds like a lot, but don't worry, Tor Project's already working on bringing that

10:31.180 --> 10:33.740
functionality into the new browser app.

10:33.740 --> 10:35.560
Look for that sometime in the future.

10:35.560 --> 10:38.680
Well, sometime in the future, we're not even going to be using Android, are we?

10:38.680 --> 10:40.960
We're going to be using PureOS on the Librem 5.

10:40.960 --> 10:43.520
Oh, I certainly hope so.

10:43.520 --> 10:48.560
Unfortunately, there's some news that, well, we might have to wait a little bit longer.

10:48.560 --> 10:54.080
Yeah, they had originally planned to ship this phone in January of 2019, but now it

10:54.080 --> 10:59.000
looks like it's going to be April, or at least that's what they're estimating at the moment.

10:59.000 --> 11:03.080
And they say, with all the advancements Purism is making with hardware, software, development

11:03.080 --> 11:09.400
kits and services, during testing two silicon bugs were discovered in the Librem 5 CPU that

11:09.400 --> 11:13.360
affect power management and power consumption.

11:13.360 --> 11:17.920
And so, three months delay in production, unfortunately, but at least they're being

11:17.920 --> 11:21.240
honest about this and are being realistic.

11:21.240 --> 11:26.520
And they're trying to achieve some goals that really no one else is working that actively

11:26.520 --> 11:27.520
on right now.

11:27.520 --> 11:29.800
So the supply chains aren't optimized for it.

11:29.800 --> 11:31.940
There's a lot of gotchas that are happening.

11:31.940 --> 11:36.280
And of course, sort of in the middle of all of this, there was a bit of a system on a

11:36.280 --> 11:39.160
chip shift to use a newer version.

11:39.160 --> 11:40.400
There's some problems there.

11:40.400 --> 11:45.480
It sounds like if you use this with the current flaws, your phone would be dead in about an

11:45.480 --> 11:47.200
hour's worth of use.

11:47.200 --> 11:50.280
I don't know about you, Joe, that's not really going to make it happen for me in the real

11:50.280 --> 11:51.280
world.

11:51.280 --> 11:53.080
No, unfortunately not.

11:53.080 --> 11:57.280
So they did a press release about this, which kind of buried the lead, I think.

11:57.280 --> 12:00.720
And they were kind of talking about how great it is and everything.

12:00.720 --> 12:05.600
But there is a link within that press release to a more technical blog post.

12:05.600 --> 12:12.320
And in that, they explain why they decided to move from the original IMX6 to the IMX8.

12:12.320 --> 12:19.480
And they talk about it being 64-bit with more GPUs and lower power consumption, and just

12:19.480 --> 12:22.600
generally being a much better system on a chip.

12:22.600 --> 12:27.560
But in deciding to move to that rather than the IMX6, which they kind of based their plans

12:27.560 --> 12:30.880
on, they had to do some QA and testing.

12:30.880 --> 12:35.080
And sure enough, that brought up this issue about the power management.

12:35.080 --> 12:39.000
You know, it does seem like they're doing a pretty thorough job of both being transparent

12:39.000 --> 12:41.360
and being realistic.

12:41.360 --> 12:45.000
You know, some of this might happen earlier, but they just needed a hard date internally

12:45.000 --> 12:46.000
to plan around.

12:46.000 --> 12:47.520
I can certainly understand that.

12:47.520 --> 12:52.780
Plus, there is the normal sort of Western world holiday season coming up and Chinese

12:52.780 --> 12:53.780
New Year.

12:53.780 --> 12:58.120
It's a lot of time that can just cause supply problems, so aiming for sometime in the spring

12:58.120 --> 13:00.880
of next year seems like a doable goal.

13:00.880 --> 13:04.780
And they say that they're going to start shipping the dev kits in October, but they do caveat

13:04.780 --> 13:08.000
that with barring any unforeseen issues.

13:08.000 --> 13:13.200
Now that is four months behind the original schedule, because thanks to archive.org, I

13:13.200 --> 13:18.720
saw the original crowdfunding page when there was only $1,000 being pledged of the $2 million

13:18.720 --> 13:19.720
I think they got.

13:19.720 --> 13:22.000
So it was a very early snapshot.

13:22.000 --> 13:26.640
And it says on that that the dev kits will be shipping in June.

13:26.640 --> 13:29.740
And well, June has long come and gone.

13:29.740 --> 13:32.940
And so now they're saying October, but they talk about in this blog post that it's going

13:32.940 --> 13:34.560
to be on schedule, these dev kits.

13:34.560 --> 13:40.080
So they're obviously talking about a revised schedule that it's now sticking to.

13:40.080 --> 13:45.480
But they also say that the dev kits will ship with this hardware bug because the dev kits

13:45.480 --> 13:49.240
are not designed to be run off batteries, they're designed to be plugged in, run off

13:49.240 --> 13:52.920
the mains, so it doesn't matter that there are power management issues.

13:52.920 --> 13:57.160
So that does make it seem more realistic that we'll see them in October, because October's

13:57.160 --> 13:58.440
not very long, is it?

13:58.440 --> 13:59.440
No, that's coming up.

13:59.440 --> 14:02.200
I mean, that's just next month.

14:02.200 --> 14:06.840
But that would be a good way to get that pipeline going, get developers actually working on

14:06.840 --> 14:11.240
testing, building, making sure all the software is going to run really well once there's actual

14:11.240 --> 14:12.240
shippable units.

14:12.240 --> 14:15.680
Although, you know, there is another bit of a red flag in here.

14:15.680 --> 14:20.640
And that is they say the phone design schematics are pretty much complete.

14:20.640 --> 14:21.760
Pretty much complete.

14:21.760 --> 14:25.300
And we've been busy focusing on putting the device together.

14:25.300 --> 14:28.480
There are some missing pieces like the modem that needs to be incorporated.

14:28.480 --> 14:31.720
But other than that, there are currently no showstopping issues in regards to manufacturing

14:31.720 --> 14:32.720
the phone.

14:32.720 --> 14:33.720
Really?

14:33.720 --> 14:37.720
The modem is probably the most important, right?

14:37.720 --> 14:39.200
That's the whole thing?

14:39.200 --> 14:40.200
Yeah.

14:40.200 --> 14:44.840
And just even the case, if you don't know exactly what components are going where, and

14:44.840 --> 14:52.180
you are still finalizing it, then surely they can't be ready to fab the cases yet, which

14:52.180 --> 14:58.720
is, okay, it's a fairly minor part of it, but you would hope that they would have that

14:58.720 --> 15:00.760
ready at this stage.

15:00.760 --> 15:04.520
I just hope that they get it together soon because we really need this.

15:04.520 --> 15:10.080
And you know, we've been following this on this show on Linux Unplugged on, you know,

15:10.080 --> 15:14.040
the whole Linux community has been following this, because we just really want this to

15:14.040 --> 15:15.040
happen.

15:15.040 --> 15:17.520
But it's just so difficult, isn't it?

15:17.520 --> 15:20.360
The last great free software phone hope.

15:20.360 --> 15:21.440
It is really hard.

15:21.440 --> 15:22.560
It is worth doing.

15:22.560 --> 15:25.480
And I guess we also have to make sure we manage our expectations.

15:25.480 --> 15:29.320
You know, this is not going to be like an iPhone right out of the gate.

15:29.320 --> 15:33.560
But if we can get to the point of a usable phone you can use in your everyday life and

15:33.560 --> 15:38.680
respects a lot of the freedoms and philosophies that we hold dear, that would be a game changer.

15:38.680 --> 15:43.280
Well, we'll definitely keep reporting on this one right up until it gets released and beyond

15:43.280 --> 15:47.400
whether that is indeed in April next year or whether it gets pushed back again.

15:47.400 --> 15:49.560
We'll have to see.

15:49.560 --> 15:54.240
But going back to Android, I saw this week that CompuLab have announced their device

15:54.240 --> 15:58.640
called Wild, which is Wi-Fi indoor location device.

15:58.640 --> 16:06.840
And this is the first Wi-Fi RTT access point that allows for Wi-Fi indoor location detection

16:06.840 --> 16:09.960
and tracking as long as you've got an Android 9 smartphone.

16:09.960 --> 16:13.020
Now Wi-Fi RTT is round trip time.

16:13.020 --> 16:15.920
This is some seriously interesting technology.

16:15.920 --> 16:22.020
You know, at first it sounded a little creepy to me, but you can imagine a ton of real world

16:22.020 --> 16:23.020
use cases.

16:23.020 --> 16:27.400
I especially see this being used at really large campuses or even just middle sized buildings

16:27.400 --> 16:32.080
where you have a large number of APs to do triangulation with and where you might need

16:32.080 --> 16:36.400
some assistance navigating or it could just be useful to know where people are, how to

16:36.400 --> 16:41.100
get them and then perhaps even also navigating autonomous devices within a building like

16:41.100 --> 16:42.100
that.

16:42.100 --> 16:45.960
I don't know when the last time you visited a large hospital was, but that is a nightmare

16:45.960 --> 16:52.200
trying to find the right place and being able to triangulate your location and get turn

16:52.200 --> 16:55.580
by turn directions would be amazing for that.

16:55.580 --> 16:58.680
Now this Wi-Fi round trip time is really interesting.

16:58.680 --> 17:01.020
It's such a simple concept.

17:01.020 --> 17:06.120
It's just the time it takes for an access point to ping your device and back.

17:06.120 --> 17:10.960
But then if you have at least three of them, you can triangulate where that person is down

17:10.960 --> 17:15.120
to apparently under 0.5 meters, which I think is about a foot and a half.

17:15.120 --> 17:20.520
It's really impressive and is kind of an ingenious use of information we already had available

17:20.520 --> 17:24.400
and with just honestly some high school math, you can put this all together if you have

17:24.400 --> 17:26.360
all that available to you.

17:26.360 --> 17:28.800
Plus there's been some design with security in mind.

17:28.800 --> 17:32.360
So the AP doesn't get to know that location, right?

17:32.360 --> 17:41.280
Your phone can infer it through the protocol 802.11mc, which is the Wi-Fi RTT spec, but

17:41.280 --> 17:45.000
you don't have to worry that everyone else on the network is also spying on you.

17:45.000 --> 17:49.440
So this particular bit of hardware is familiar to me.

17:49.440 --> 17:52.600
When I saw the photo of it, I thought, hang on, that looks familiar.

17:52.600 --> 17:58.000
And sure enough, it's the same hardware as the Mint Box Mini 2, which is a little fanless

17:58.000 --> 18:05.520
PC, basically, passively called, seems ideal for this purpose.

18:05.520 --> 18:09.760
And they talk about it running the latest GNU slash Linux Debian, including KDE and

18:09.760 --> 18:11.560
standard package management.

18:11.560 --> 18:14.640
I don't know why you'd need a GUI on this, but hey, who cares?

18:14.640 --> 18:16.000
KDE is nice.

18:16.000 --> 18:21.440
And they also say that their drivers and utilities will be open source.

18:21.440 --> 18:26.040
Now there's no mention of where that code actually is and what license it is.

18:26.040 --> 18:28.120
So I'm a little bit skeptical about that.

18:28.120 --> 18:34.200
But if they do deliver on their promise of open sourcing that, this is really great because

18:34.200 --> 18:39.840
if you're going to have this kind of tracking, then it needs to all be open source.

18:39.840 --> 18:44.680
You can't have proprietary stuff in there because then nefarious things can happen.

18:44.680 --> 18:48.520
I would be much more comfortable using a system like this, knowing that it was open source,

18:48.520 --> 18:53.920
knowing that we can audit the code, knowing that it's not just going to get sold that

18:53.920 --> 18:54.920
data.

18:54.920 --> 19:00.000
But using a public specification, open source implementations dominating the market.

19:00.000 --> 19:04.160
That's a world I can get behind and actually trust that it might not be abused.

19:04.160 --> 19:06.480
And this is not ridiculously expensive either.

19:06.480 --> 19:12.040
They talk about it being $175 for a barebone unit, if you order in volume.

19:12.040 --> 19:15.640
And let's face it, to do this, you're going to have to order in volume because there's

19:15.640 --> 19:20.000
no point in a small place, you're going to need 20 or 30 of these at least to make it

19:20.000 --> 19:21.000
worthwhile.

19:21.000 --> 19:24.440
Right, you're not putting this in your house, you're putting it in a hospital or a large

19:24.440 --> 19:27.000
tech organization campus or an office building.

19:27.000 --> 19:28.640
Yeah, or a museum or something like that.

19:28.640 --> 19:33.520
And for $175 per access point, I mean, that's pretty competitive, isn't it?

19:33.520 --> 19:34.520
Absolutely.

19:34.520 --> 19:38.520
And you know, there's enterprise access points that already go for a lot more than that.

19:38.520 --> 19:39.520
Yeah.

19:39.520 --> 19:44.080
So I'm skeptical at this point, I do want to see that they follow through on publishing

19:44.080 --> 19:45.080
the source code.

19:45.080 --> 19:47.160
But this is definitely one to watch.

19:47.160 --> 19:51.760
Now one that I was watching for not very long at all was spec being introduced into the

19:51.760 --> 19:54.700
kernel, which came in in 4.17.

19:54.700 --> 20:00.040
But now it looks like in 4.20, it's going to be removed already.

20:00.040 --> 20:01.760
This is an unusual case.

20:01.760 --> 20:05.800
And there's really a large number of ways to read this story.

20:05.800 --> 20:11.320
Google had been pushing for the NSA's spec algorithm for use on some of its lower end

20:11.320 --> 20:15.480
mobile phones that just didn't have hardware implementations for things like AES.

20:15.480 --> 20:22.080
So they wanted a faster, but also at a cost of being faster, less robust encryption algorithm.

20:22.080 --> 20:26.920
Now, of course, there was pushback and spec was actually ultimately rejected by the ISO

20:26.920 --> 20:27.920
as a standard.

20:27.920 --> 20:32.560
Nevertheless, with Google's backing, it made it into the 4.17 kernel.

20:32.560 --> 20:37.180
Google turns out, well, they've decided to go another way without their backing.

20:37.180 --> 20:38.180
Out it goes.

20:38.180 --> 20:40.000
Now, there is a bit of confusion here, isn't there?

20:40.000 --> 20:45.680
Because Google didn't necessarily have to use spec for its lower end hardware version

20:45.680 --> 20:46.680
of Android.

20:46.680 --> 20:48.560
They could have used an alternative.

20:48.560 --> 20:54.760
Yeah, so they've actually ended up going with XCHA CHA, which is a descendant of the CHA

20:54.760 --> 20:58.440
CHA algorithm already implemented in Chrome.

20:58.440 --> 21:05.240
And the construction they've chose to use, HPoly C, is faster than spec was and more

21:05.240 --> 21:06.240
secure.

21:06.240 --> 21:11.080
So this leads to some serious conspiracy baking being fired up here because if spec was technically

21:11.080 --> 21:14.880
inferior, why were they pushing so hard to include it in the kernel?

21:14.880 --> 21:18.280
If not, because of pressure from three letter agencies?

21:18.280 --> 21:23.000
Yeah, you do have to wonder like, were the technical justifications, did they ever make

21:23.000 --> 21:24.000
sense?

21:24.000 --> 21:29.080
It also says some things I think about both the power Google has within the kernel community

21:29.080 --> 21:34.280
and just how it functions as a thriving open source, back and forth discussion that we

21:34.280 --> 21:39.600
saw put in, we saw it removed so quickly, and I guess we just steamroll ahead and move

21:39.600 --> 21:40.600
on with our lives?

21:40.600 --> 21:45.320
Well, when it was introduced, there was, of course, the option not to actually include

21:45.320 --> 21:50.880
it when you compile the kernel, and I suspect that a lot of people will have been doing

21:50.880 --> 21:51.880
that.

21:51.880 --> 21:56.400
Whereas now, it looks like that's not going to be a problem for them, although it did

21:56.400 --> 21:59.480
make it into 4.19, which is an LTS kernel.

21:59.480 --> 22:04.360
So I suppose those distro maintainers are going to have that difficult choice to make,

22:04.360 --> 22:05.760
do they include it or not?

22:05.760 --> 22:10.420
I will say it does at least make me glad that instead of just adding a proprietary encryption

22:10.420 --> 22:15.500
method into the Android or into Play Store or something like that, we do get to see all

22:15.500 --> 22:20.080
of this taking shape in the open source sphere on the mailing list, and then we get to blather

22:20.080 --> 22:21.080
about it here.

22:21.080 --> 22:25.960
Well, let's end with a fun or strange story, I suppose, and that's about the kernel maintainer

22:25.960 --> 22:31.080
summit, which was scheduled to be in Canada, but now it's going to be in Scotland.

22:31.080 --> 22:32.440
So they've moved continents.

22:32.440 --> 22:33.440
Why?

22:33.440 --> 22:38.760
Well, because Linus got the date and location wrong and was going to be on holiday in Scotland.

22:38.760 --> 22:40.560
So let's just move over there.

22:40.560 --> 22:41.560
Wow.

22:41.560 --> 22:45.200
You know, they explored a bunch of options here, kind of in the scramble of what are

22:45.200 --> 22:46.200
we going to do?

22:46.200 --> 22:48.660
Linus is a rather important maintainer.

22:48.660 --> 22:54.840
Option one, keep the summit in Vancouver and have it without Linus, or move the maintainer

22:54.840 --> 22:58.160
summit to Edinburgh with Linus.

22:58.160 --> 23:00.320
Strangely enough, Linus was totally okay missing it.

23:00.320 --> 23:02.600
He suggested option number one.

23:02.600 --> 23:05.480
But it was ultimately decided that he's too important.

23:05.480 --> 23:09.840
And that kind of tells you a lot, doesn't it, about, you know, he is the benevolent

23:09.840 --> 23:15.880
dictator or whatever, but he really is just the linchpin of this whole operation.

23:15.880 --> 23:17.040
He absolutely is.

23:17.040 --> 23:21.060
And just to make it clear, if we both are not familiar, the focus of the maintainer

23:21.060 --> 23:25.640
summit is really on process and development issues and not technical issues.

23:25.640 --> 23:28.020
There's also the Colonel Plummer's conference.

23:28.020 --> 23:31.540
There's a number of other summits and conferences that happen that all those other things get

23:31.540 --> 23:32.540
hashed out.

23:32.540 --> 23:36.920
So it might just be an extra trip to Scotland for those lucky few invited to the maintainer

23:36.920 --> 23:37.920
summit.

23:37.920 --> 23:39.260
Well, Scotland is absolutely delightful.

23:39.260 --> 23:44.320
So I'm sure they'll be pleased to fly all that way from the west coast of North America

23:44.320 --> 23:47.960
all the way there to reigning Scotland.

23:47.960 --> 23:53.200
It just seems very strange that this would happen, but that's how important he is.

23:53.200 --> 23:54.200
Yeah.

23:54.200 --> 23:57.880
I mean, I like the humility and, you know, I'm sure he's wanting to see them do this

23:57.880 --> 24:01.840
without him just as for own peace of mind's sake, I'm sure I would be.

24:01.840 --> 24:06.280
But at the end of the day, we have the Colonel we have, we have the leader we have, and all

24:06.280 --> 24:09.640
just keeps ticking along and have fun in Scotland, guys.

24:09.640 --> 24:12.980
