00:00.000 --> 00:05.200
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News.

00:05.200 --> 00:09.080
Episode 212, recorded on October 25th, 2021.

00:09.080 --> 00:10.080
I'm Chris.

00:10.080 --> 00:11.080
And I'm Wes.

00:11.080 --> 00:12.080
Hello, Wes!

00:12.080 --> 00:18.680
Just back from an event, and I am in a very rainy, noisy Pacific Northwest, but we're

00:18.680 --> 00:19.680
going to do the news.

00:19.680 --> 00:22.760
And we're going to start with performance.

00:22.760 --> 00:28.400
Just one week ago, LinuxBlock subsystem maintainer Yens Akspo was hitting some new performance

00:28.400 --> 00:29.740
heights.

00:29.740 --> 00:36.360
After optimizing the kernel, he achieved around 8.9 million IOPS per core.

00:36.360 --> 00:40.360
He and others began to speculate at that point that they might just be hitting the limits

00:40.360 --> 00:41.520
of the hardware.

00:41.520 --> 00:43.480
It's too much performance, man.

00:43.480 --> 00:48.160
IOPS, or the input output operations per second, it's like a raw performance measurement that

00:48.160 --> 00:50.800
you can use to characterize the performance of a drive.

00:50.800 --> 00:55.480
It doesn't directly translate to real world actual performance, but it does give you an

00:55.480 --> 00:57.840
indicator of potential performance.

00:57.840 --> 01:02.840
So measuring the IOPS is part of the overall story about how something is performing, including

01:02.840 --> 01:05.320
the code paths to get you to that device.

01:05.320 --> 01:09.360
And it's one of those tests that Yens can run as he's optimizing the kernel NVMe's

01:09.360 --> 01:13.500
IOU ring code or the memory management code, which he also needed to optimize.

01:13.500 --> 01:16.120
He makes a tweak, and then he runs a test.

01:16.120 --> 01:24.220
And after a whole bunch of tweaking, he managed to smash out 10 million IOPS.

01:24.220 --> 01:26.800
That is just a remarkable performance milestone.

01:26.800 --> 01:33.680
I mean, of course, the system is no slouch, as you might expect, an AMD Ryzen 9 5950X

01:33.680 --> 01:38.680
with dual Intel P5800X Gen 2 Optane SSDs.

01:38.680 --> 01:40.520
Right, super nice.

01:40.520 --> 01:44.760
And he's not going through the file system and lots of other caveats here, but this is

01:44.760 --> 01:46.000
an insane mark to hit.

01:46.000 --> 01:50.920
I mean, there was actual debate if it could even be achieved, and now he's done it.

01:50.920 --> 01:57.360
But also, I'm a really big fan of these edge case optimization quests that lead to other

01:57.360 --> 01:59.000
areas that get improved.

01:59.000 --> 02:00.000
And we all benefit.

02:00.000 --> 02:05.040
Yeah, I think this is a big one for really anyone who's using the Linux kernel.

02:05.040 --> 02:09.320
Now so far, this new performance code has only landed in the kernel's work in progress

02:09.320 --> 02:11.540
branch for the block subsystem.

02:11.540 --> 02:16.720
But much if not all of it should land, fingers crossed, in Linux 5.16.

02:16.720 --> 02:22.000
Now that said, Linux 5.15 is not even out yet, but it did enter its final RC phase early

02:22.000 --> 02:23.260
Monday morning.

02:23.260 --> 02:27.840
Much like today's episode of Linux Action News, the RC release was a day late.

02:27.840 --> 02:32.480
Linus does tend to release on Sundays, but he was traveling this week and as he noted,

02:32.480 --> 02:37.320
his Sunday release was quote, spoiled by me spending more time in an airplane without

02:37.320 --> 02:38.320
Wi-Fi.

02:38.320 --> 02:42.200
Well, that's not a lot of fun, but it's a whole lot better than the release being delayed

02:42.200 --> 02:44.400
by actual issues with the kernel.

02:44.400 --> 02:45.400
Heyo.

02:45.400 --> 02:52.760
Linus did note that RC 7 of 5.15 looks quote, nice and small, right in the range of normal.

02:52.760 --> 02:57.600
He went on to say that both the number of commits and the diff stat looks fine.

02:57.600 --> 03:02.560
It's all pretty small and flat, meaning mostly small trivial changes, with just a couple

03:02.560 --> 03:09.160
of peaks for some x86 KVM code and some KSMBD changes.

03:09.160 --> 03:10.640
Excellent.

03:10.640 --> 03:11.840
Good.

03:11.840 --> 03:14.400
Let the KSMBD changes flow.

03:14.400 --> 03:16.640
Still the craziest thing they ever let in the kernel.

03:16.640 --> 03:20.280
You call it crazy, I call it brilliant.

03:20.280 --> 03:24.440
As for when we might actually get to play with it, Michael Larible over at Ferronix

03:24.440 --> 03:30.160
noted that at this stage, 5.15 is looking quite good, and it seems likely it should

03:30.160 --> 03:32.160
debut next Sunday.

03:32.160 --> 03:39.080
However, as Linus will again be traveling next week, he is inclined, if the need presents

03:39.080 --> 03:46.240
itself to delay the 5.15 release to then hopefully avoid the Linux 5.16 merge window during his

03:46.240 --> 03:48.660
next round of travels.

03:48.660 --> 03:54.600
But looking ahead to Linux 5.16, we see two important sets of patches out there for those

03:54.600 --> 04:00.760
of you who might want to use Linux on a shiny new M1 Mac, which I plan to test out and even

04:00.760 --> 04:01.960
perhaps deploy.

04:01.960 --> 04:03.360
We shall see how that goes.

04:03.360 --> 04:10.080
But yeah, it looks like a PCIe driver for the M1 systems will land in 5.16 and support

04:10.080 --> 04:13.480
the 2021 Apple Magic Keyboard as well.

04:13.480 --> 04:18.220
Now we should probably mention there's no Touch ID sensor support just yet that wasn't

04:18.220 --> 04:24.600
in the scope of this work, but everything else is looking pretty darn good.

04:24.600 --> 04:30.440
The PCIe-Apple driver, as it's known, was reverse engineered by Alyssa Rosenzweig and

04:30.440 --> 04:36.040
Marc SolgÃ©, was also based on previous work from Corellium and OpenBSD.

04:36.040 --> 04:40.600
This is some impressive work in fewer than 1000 lines of new code in the kernel.

04:40.600 --> 04:44.720
You know, I haven't measured this, but I get the impression just from watching the kernel

04:44.720 --> 04:51.420
development news that support for the Apple devices is landing faster at a more aggressive

04:51.420 --> 04:52.420
clip.

04:52.420 --> 04:55.720
And you just wouldn't have thought it was going to go this way when Apple announced

04:55.720 --> 05:00.000
their own closed ecosystem and they were tightening down even further.

05:00.000 --> 05:04.280
But it seems like things are better for anyone than ever if they want to run a Mac using

05:04.280 --> 05:05.280
Linux.

05:05.280 --> 05:06.280
Yeah, I know.

05:06.280 --> 05:09.740
It's weird how in this new closed era where they've got to design things however they

05:09.740 --> 05:15.400
want and not have to play ball with the Intel side of things, how is that easier for Linux?

05:15.400 --> 05:19.520
But somehow it seems to be working out really well.

05:19.520 --> 05:22.560
Fingers crossed, though, who knows what might happen in the future?

05:22.560 --> 05:26.960
Yeah, what happens in the future will always be that big question hanging over the platform

05:26.960 --> 05:28.240
for Linux users.

05:28.240 --> 05:29.240
We just won't know.

05:29.240 --> 05:30.320
We'll see.

05:30.320 --> 05:35.640
But this PCIe driver that's getting in shape for 5.16 looks like it does a lot more than

05:35.640 --> 05:39.460
just bring PCI Express up, which it does, and that is important.

05:39.460 --> 05:46.440
But it was also the prerequisite for bringing up the USB type A ports, Ethernet, Wi-Fi and

05:46.440 --> 05:50.000
Bluetooth on Apple M1 Mac minis and MacBooks.

05:50.000 --> 05:52.360
You know, like any of the useful ports.

05:52.360 --> 05:53.360
Yeah.

05:53.360 --> 05:54.360
So good.

05:54.360 --> 05:58.880
It really tells me that any Linux distro that's going to work on the M1 is probably

05:58.880 --> 06:04.360
going to need to be 5.16 based and it's just so awesome to see them work on this.

06:04.360 --> 06:09.240
I mean, this is three teams that worked on this and it's all going upstream for all of

06:09.240 --> 06:10.440
us to use.

06:10.440 --> 06:13.560
Popping up the stack just a bit.

06:13.560 --> 06:19.040
It's been an exciting week for KDE developers who've been preparing the Plasma Wayland session

06:19.040 --> 06:23.360
to work with NVIDIA's new GBM support in their binary driver.

06:23.360 --> 06:30.840
KDE Plasma 5.23.2 and up will support the GBM backend required to work with recent driver

06:30.840 --> 06:34.680
updates by NVIDIA that enable full Wayland support.

06:34.680 --> 06:41.160
Yeah, NVIDIA added support for this on their end for GBM with the 4.95 driver.

06:41.160 --> 06:45.840
Along these same lines Fedora 35 will be shipping soon featuring GBM with Wayland to use with

06:45.840 --> 06:46.840
GNOME Shell.

06:46.840 --> 06:52.560
And looking ahead to Plasma 5.24, I'm sure you'll be happy to see that fingerprint support

06:52.560 --> 06:53.760
is finally landing.

06:53.760 --> 06:55.280
Oh, another week.

06:55.280 --> 06:56.280
Another happy dance.

06:56.280 --> 06:57.280
Two weeks in a row.

06:57.280 --> 06:58.280
Yeah, this is great.

06:58.280 --> 07:02.040
And this support will allow for unlocking the screen and authenticating those pseudo

07:02.040 --> 07:03.040
prompts.

07:03.040 --> 07:05.400
I enjoy that a lot when using GNOME on my ThinkPad right now.

07:05.400 --> 07:09.000
It just, it feels high end and fancy and well integrated.

07:09.000 --> 07:13.040
Definitely some good improvements inbound, plenty of things for us to keep our eyes on

07:13.040 --> 07:16.760
and review sometime in the future.

07:16.760 --> 07:18.320

This show is made possible by you taking advantage of our sponsors offer.

07:26.200 --> 07:30.760
And Linode is one we enthusiastically endorse, so lino.com slash land.

07:30.760 --> 07:34.520
They started in 2003 as one of the first companies in cloud computing.

07:34.520 --> 07:39.560
Now 18 years later, they are the largest independent open cloud provider in the world with 11 global

07:39.560 --> 07:42.240
data centers serving nearly a million customers.

07:42.240 --> 07:47.080
But they still remain focused on making cloud computing simple, affordable, and accessible

07:47.080 --> 07:48.080
to all.

07:48.080 --> 07:50.420
They really have the best in class experience.

07:50.420 --> 07:52.800
That's why we host everything on Linode now.

07:52.800 --> 07:56.280
Go support the show and find out for yourself at lino.com slash land.

07:56.280 --> 08:02.620
They have an easy to use, powerful cloud dashboard, fantastic, best in the industry customer support,

08:02.620 --> 08:07.720
super fast networking, super fast MVME disk, and crazy fast CPU systems.

08:07.720 --> 08:14.720
They really have the best mix of performance, price, and features, lino.com slash land.

08:14.720 --> 08:16.760
Linux.ting.com.

08:16.760 --> 08:18.840
That's where you go to save more on mobile.

Go see how much you could save and then take 25 bucks off that and support the show.

08:27.000 --> 08:32.600
Ting has nationwide coverage, a great mix of plans, and super fast LTE and 5G, depending

08:32.600 --> 08:34.120
on your area.

08:34.120 --> 08:35.120
They're straightforward.

08:35.120 --> 08:36.560
They're simple to understand plans.

08:36.560 --> 08:42.080
I've been a Tink customer since 2013, and there's one reason and one reason only.

08:42.080 --> 08:45.120
Ting's a great value, and maybe there's two reasons.

08:45.120 --> 08:46.120
They're flexible.

08:46.120 --> 08:47.120
Okay, maybe there's three reasons.

08:47.120 --> 08:48.920
They have really good customer support.

08:48.920 --> 08:52.000
Okay, maybe there's four reasons because they also have a great dashboard.

08:52.000 --> 08:54.800
Five reasons they have lots of networks to choose from.

08:54.800 --> 08:59.160
Six reasons they also have really great customer support and community.

08:59.160 --> 09:00.640
Did I already say that one?

09:00.640 --> 09:04.040
I really just want you to focus on the one thing though, whichever one of those matters

09:04.040 --> 09:05.040
the most for you.

09:05.040 --> 09:06.840
Go try it out and see what I'm talking about.

09:06.840 --> 09:10.280
It's so great, and every plan gets access to Ting's award-winning customer service,

09:10.280 --> 09:14.480
nationwide LTE and 5G, and of course, no contracts ever.

09:14.480 --> 09:15.480
How about that?

09:15.480 --> 09:16.540
The freedom of no contracts.

09:16.540 --> 09:17.540
That's pretty sweet.

09:17.540 --> 09:19.160
So just head to linux.ting.com.

09:19.160 --> 09:22.200
Check your current phone, create an account, and pick the plan that's right for you.

09:22.200 --> 09:23.200
Ting will send you a SIM card.

09:23.200 --> 09:25.320
You pop that in your phone, and you can get activated in minutes.

09:25.320 --> 09:26.680
They've got a great dashboard.

09:26.680 --> 09:29.040
Just get started by going to linux.ting.com.

09:29.040 --> 09:30.520
It's the next generation of Ting mobile.

09:30.520 --> 09:31.520
It's here.

09:31.520 --> 09:38.080
Go see how much you could save and get 25 bucks off that, linux.ting.com.

09:38.080 --> 09:43.280
This week, we learned of a new GPL lawsuit that could have some real implications for

09:43.280 --> 09:44.720
all of us.

09:44.720 --> 09:49.720
The Software Freedom Conservancy, or SFC for short, a non-profit organization that promotes

09:49.720 --> 09:55.920
open-source software and defends the general public license, has sued TV maker Vizio for

09:55.920 --> 09:56.920
GPL violations.

09:56.920 --> 10:04.800
The SFC is suing Vizio because its SmartCast OS is based on Linux, uses U-Boot, TAR, glibc,

10:04.800 --> 10:08.280
ffmpeg, and a whole bunch of other free software.

10:08.280 --> 10:13.920
But Vizio is not making the sources available, as is required by the GPL.

10:13.920 --> 10:18.160
This news probably doesn't really come as a surprise to anyone listening to this show.

10:18.160 --> 10:22.860
There have been attempts to get Vizio to address this since 2018.

10:22.860 --> 10:27.680
The Conservancy engaged in at least a year-long attempt of diplomacy to get them to understand

10:27.680 --> 10:31.200
the terms of the GPL and, well, nothing.

10:31.200 --> 10:36.780
What is a bit surprising about this case, though, is that the SFC is taking a new approach.

10:36.780 --> 10:41.840
The lawsuit is being made as the purchaser of a product, which illegally contains copylefted

10:41.840 --> 10:42.840
code.

10:42.840 --> 10:46.680
This new approach makes it the first legal case that focuses on the rights of individual

10:46.680 --> 10:50.760
consumers as third-party GPL beneficiaries.

10:50.760 --> 10:55.620
According to this lawsuit, you as the buyer also have the right to access that source

10:55.620 --> 10:56.620
code.

10:56.620 --> 11:01.520
I like this, and I'd love to see this tested, and I mean, I'm a little nervous about seeing

11:01.520 --> 11:04.440
it tested, but I still want to see it tested.

11:04.440 --> 11:08.640
There is a real right to repair element to this, even if you're not a developer.

11:08.640 --> 11:12.440
Getting access to this source code could give you vital bits of information when attempting

11:12.440 --> 11:14.560
to make repairs years down the road.

11:14.560 --> 11:15.560
No kidding.

11:15.560 --> 11:17.240
Otherwise, it's just a black box.

11:17.240 --> 11:22.720
I think the SFC hopes to demonstrate that it's not just the copyright holders, but also

11:22.720 --> 11:25.320
the users who are entitled to rights.

11:25.320 --> 11:29.800
You also have the fact that eventually, Visio will just abandon this product and its software.

11:29.800 --> 11:34.640
Sometimes vendors deactivate devices when they no longer want to support them.

11:34.640 --> 11:39.160
But most of the time, they just silently stop updating them and just hope you won't notice.

11:39.160 --> 11:43.800
The open source community could step up in some cases for popular products, and we could

11:43.800 --> 11:47.520
support them years beyond what the original vendor might be willing to do.

11:47.520 --> 11:50.800
We have seen so many examples of that.

11:50.800 --> 11:55.400
The hardware works just fine, but the software is out of support.

11:55.400 --> 12:01.760
Karen Sandler of the SFC pointed out this issue is even hotter right now, saying, quote,

12:01.760 --> 12:05.940
the global supply chain shortages that have affected everything from cars to consumer

12:05.940 --> 12:10.400
electronics underscores one of the reasons why it's important to be able to repair products

12:10.400 --> 12:12.600
we already own.

12:12.600 --> 12:17.880
She goes on to say, even without supply chain challenges, the forced obsolescence of devices

12:17.880 --> 12:23.320
like TVs isn't in the best interest of the consumer, or even the planet.

12:23.320 --> 12:25.680
Hmm, fair points indeed.

Instead, it's only asking that Visio give access to the technical information that the

12:34.440 --> 12:37.800

12:37.800 --> 12:41.320

12:41.320 --> 12:42.400
and open source.
