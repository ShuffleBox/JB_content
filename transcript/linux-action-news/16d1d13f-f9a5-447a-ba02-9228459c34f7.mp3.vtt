00:00.000 --> 00:16.080
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, our weekly take on Linux and the open source world.

00:16.080 --> 00:19.760
This is episode 13, recorded on August 6th, 2017.

00:19.760 --> 00:20.760
I'm Chris.

00:20.760 --> 00:21.760
And I'm Joe.

00:21.760 --> 00:22.760
Hello, Joe.

00:22.760 --> 00:26.180
Happy fake episode 13 to you.

00:26.180 --> 00:27.180
That's a little inside joke.

00:27.180 --> 00:30.880
Yeah, technically the 14th because of the beta episode we did.

00:30.880 --> 00:32.300
It's our secret, Josh.

00:32.300 --> 00:33.680
That's our little secret.

00:33.680 --> 00:38.680
Although you'd almost think it was the actual episode 13 because of some of the bad luck

00:38.680 --> 00:40.520
the Corita Foundation has had recently.

00:40.520 --> 00:46.000
Yeah, so it turns out that being a nonprofit and also selling stuff at the same time can

00:46.000 --> 00:50.240
land you in serious trouble with the tax authorities, at least in the Netherlands.

00:50.240 --> 00:51.240
Yeah, yeah.

00:51.240 --> 00:54.880
I guess the Corita Foundation thought everything was going along smooth when they set up their

00:54.880 --> 00:59.760
foundation in 2013, they took advice of a local tax consultant and thought, okay, we've

00:59.760 --> 01:04.440
got this all dialed in until Dutch tax authorities told them otherwise.

01:04.440 --> 01:10.520
Essentially, they were operating as a charity, but also operating as a corporation to use

01:10.520 --> 01:12.000
US parlance.

01:12.000 --> 01:15.160
And that sort of got them in a catch 22 situation.

01:15.160 --> 01:23.080
Yeah, they had claimed some VAT back that they shouldn't have and ended up with a 20,000

01:23.080 --> 01:24.920
euro tax bill.

01:24.920 --> 01:26.160
Yeah, that's awful.

01:26.160 --> 01:32.000
And even after they were able to get it reduced to 15,000 euros, their accounting bill was

01:32.000 --> 01:33.000
4,000 euros.

01:33.000 --> 01:34.000
So, geez.

01:34.000 --> 01:35.000
Yeah, so.

01:35.000 --> 01:36.000
That's bad.

01:36.000 --> 01:37.000
Yeah, that's really bad.

01:37.000 --> 01:40.880
And, you know, initially I thought, why does Corita need a foundation?

01:40.880 --> 01:44.280
And I don't mean any disrespect to the project because actually quite a bit of the artwork

01:44.280 --> 01:47.800
here at Jupiter Broadcasting was designed by artists using Corita.

01:47.800 --> 01:51.420
So I really think it's a great tool, but I thought, why do they need a foundation?

01:51.420 --> 01:55.300
And then I realized, oh, it's because, you know, they're paying Dimitri full time to

01:55.300 --> 01:58.520
work on Corita and they have other obvious expenses.

01:58.520 --> 02:03.600
It kind of shows you how much is involved just to build a great design application.

02:03.600 --> 02:06.880
Once it gets to a certain size, it's more than code, Joe.

02:06.880 --> 02:09.400
Well, yeah, that happens to a lot of projects, doesn't it?

02:09.400 --> 02:16.120
You grow to a point where you want to get paid to do it and you can put your time into

02:16.120 --> 02:20.200
it full time and then you need to have some sort of legal framework in place.

02:20.200 --> 02:21.200
Yeah.

02:21.200 --> 02:25.920
But even though they thought they had it in place properly, this has still come back to

02:25.920 --> 02:26.920
bite them.

02:26.920 --> 02:28.200
It's not ever going to be their strong suit.

02:28.200 --> 02:29.440
They want to focus on code.

02:29.440 --> 02:30.440
They want to focus on community.

02:30.440 --> 02:32.680
They don't want to focus on tax law.

02:32.680 --> 02:33.680
Who does?

02:33.680 --> 02:34.680
Yeah.

02:34.680 --> 02:37.480
But thankfully the community have come to the rescue.

02:37.480 --> 02:38.480
Indeed.

02:38.480 --> 02:42.320
In fact, it looks like a pretty big outpouring of support just days after their announcement.

02:42.320 --> 02:47.520
In fact, on their blog, they write, we didn't expect the incredible response from all of

02:47.520 --> 02:48.520
you.

02:48.520 --> 02:55.840
9,500 awesome people have donated 9,562 euros at the time of writing this post.

02:55.840 --> 02:57.140
But that's not all, actually.

02:57.140 --> 03:03.080
They also had private internet access, a VPN provider step up and offer sponsorship of

03:03.080 --> 03:07.800
20,000 euros, which is going to be fantastic for long-term investment.

03:07.800 --> 03:12.240
And also very encouraging, 14 different people have joined the development fund, which is

03:12.240 --> 03:14.880
also going to help with long-term development of Corita.

03:14.880 --> 03:16.920
You said 9,500 euros there.

03:16.920 --> 03:23.040
Well that was after one day and here we are a few days later and it's up to 36,000.

03:23.040 --> 03:26.400
So they are completely sorted basically going forward.

03:26.400 --> 03:27.400
I love it.

03:27.400 --> 03:28.400
Watch out Adobe.

03:28.400 --> 03:30.360
Corita's coming for you.

03:30.360 --> 03:33.880
Yeah, maybe.

03:33.880 --> 03:38.560
Over on the GTK side of things, Guadic 2017 just wrapped up and it looks like it was a

03:38.560 --> 03:43.240
whole bunch of upstream love in between Canonical and the Gnome development team.

03:43.240 --> 03:48.000
Yeah, and it looks like some firm decisions have been made now for Ubuntu 17.10.

03:48.000 --> 03:52.600
And for me, the most important one, moving the buttons back where they belong to the

03:52.600 --> 03:53.600
right-hand side.

03:53.600 --> 03:54.880
You went right for it, didn't you?

03:54.880 --> 03:55.880
Yeah.

03:55.880 --> 03:58.840
It seems like a trivial thing, but I actually think it's huge.

03:58.840 --> 04:02.520
They say it's because of a larger design philosophy about the dock and etc.

04:02.520 --> 04:08.840
But on the right-hand side where you expect those window controls to be says, we are Linux,

04:08.840 --> 04:13.440
we are like everybody else, we don't have to have our buttons on the left.

04:13.440 --> 04:14.920
Yeah, exactly.

04:14.920 --> 04:17.720
I mean, that's kind of trivial, really.

04:17.720 --> 04:19.280
The big news, really.

04:19.280 --> 04:22.400
You mentioned the dock thing there, so they're going to have a dock that's not DasherDock,

04:22.400 --> 04:24.960
which is a bit strange, but okay.

04:24.960 --> 04:29.920
But really the big news is Wayland, that they really are going to go for it as default.

04:29.920 --> 04:31.840
Wayland will be the default session.

04:31.840 --> 04:32.840
I don't know.

04:32.840 --> 04:36.880
I think there's also really big news in here.

04:36.880 --> 04:39.480
So there's two things I think are really big news in here, actually.

04:39.480 --> 04:43.320
First, a list of everything you're not going to get that you would expect from Unity, and

04:43.320 --> 04:45.660
I think maybe we could just bang this off really quick.

04:45.660 --> 04:50.120
This was from off the top of the head, it was no global menus.

04:50.120 --> 04:54.300
The HUD's going to be gone, alt-tab behavior is changing, messaging menus are gone, volume

04:54.300 --> 04:58.680
notifications are different, launcher integration via running apps and software center obviously

04:58.680 --> 05:03.440
is different, lenses and scopes are gone, and other tweaks that are just Unity-specific

05:03.440 --> 05:07.920
probably won't end up in GNOME, at least the version that's going to ship in 17.10.

05:07.920 --> 05:12.360
Well, much like with Wayland, 17.10 is a real test release, isn't it?

05:12.360 --> 05:15.560
Because not that many people are realistically going to use it, because you only get nine

05:15.560 --> 05:17.200
months of support with it.

05:17.200 --> 05:22.160
So it's really a testing ground for 18.04, which is what the majority of people are going

05:22.160 --> 05:23.280
to use.

05:23.280 --> 05:27.440
And so we're going back to the old days of instead of these interim releases just being

05:27.440 --> 05:32.960
boring snooze fests, this is actually going to be really exciting and interesting.

05:32.960 --> 05:38.160
And things are going to break probably, and they're going to have to use that development

05:38.160 --> 05:45.040
cycle over the next nine months until we get to 18.04 to fix everything and make it ready

05:45.040 --> 05:48.280
for the important one, the LTS.

05:48.280 --> 05:53.120
Because although 17.10 is important and it's certainly academically interesting, realistically

05:53.120 --> 05:57.760
are you going to put it on any of your machines for more than just testing purposes?

05:57.760 --> 06:01.440
Not unless I'm planning to go to 18.04, if 18.04 is solid.

06:01.440 --> 06:05.240
So I think you're right, now here's the thing I think will need the most testing.

06:05.240 --> 06:09.200
I think there's some really big news tucked in this post that we have linked in the show

06:09.200 --> 06:10.200
notes.

06:10.200 --> 06:14.760
So a lot of talk about working upstream, and it sounds like at Guadic there was a lot of

06:14.760 --> 06:19.520
back and forth from the GNOME developers on how to implement some of the modifications

06:19.520 --> 06:26.680
that Canonical wants to ship with GNOME, extensions, the doc stuff, the ambient theme.

06:26.680 --> 06:30.560
How do they do that without just stacking GNOME full of extensions?

06:30.560 --> 06:36.080
In this post, they talk about implementing modifications as a GNOME shell mode, not as

06:36.080 --> 06:40.400
a bunch of extensions and themes lacquered on top of GNOME, but as a mode that would

06:40.400 --> 06:44.760
be listed at the login manager, just like the way GNOME Classic is implemented.

06:44.760 --> 06:50.080
This will enable Canonical to deliver another session using their upstream fonts, icons,

06:50.080 --> 06:56.960
and their theme, and also a standard session that uses the upstream GNOME fonts, the Adwadia

06:56.960 --> 07:02.320
theme, the upstream shell theme, with no extensions applied, like a stock GNOME.

07:02.320 --> 07:06.520
So you'll have multiple options, and when you choose the Canonical session, it's going

07:06.520 --> 07:07.920
to be all built in.

07:07.920 --> 07:13.840
And after reading this implementation, it left me wondering why isn't this the way every

07:13.840 --> 07:17.080
distribution ships their implementation of GNOME?

07:17.080 --> 07:20.480
Well, because it's kind of a non-standard way to do it.

07:20.480 --> 07:25.440
Surely the standard way is make it stock with extensions, which can then be removed.

07:25.440 --> 07:31.760
And OK, Canonical are going to ship the option to have stock GNOME, but that's not going

07:31.760 --> 07:33.120
to be default, is it?

07:33.120 --> 07:36.120
And I think that's why other distros don't do that.

07:36.120 --> 07:42.560
This to me feels a little bit like the old Canonical that we thought had changed, not

07:42.560 --> 07:43.560
invented here.

07:43.560 --> 07:46.080
Oh, I completely disagree.

07:46.080 --> 07:51.320
So not only does my gut tell me that this was the way the folks at Guadic suggested

07:51.320 --> 07:54.960
Canonical go, like this was their advisement, I think Canonical was going to do it the way

07:54.960 --> 07:57.160
you just outlined.

07:57.160 --> 08:00.760
Then they went to Guadic and they said, you know, we've built this mechanism, and we've

08:00.760 --> 08:05.840
even designed GNOME Classic to try to show people how to do it, so that way you can deliver

08:05.840 --> 08:10.720
an experience using GNOME that doesn't have to depend on all of these breaky things.

08:10.720 --> 08:13.360
And it was designed for that.

08:13.360 --> 08:15.600
GNOME Shell was created to allow this.

08:15.600 --> 08:20.240
So it seems to me the way that the GNOME project would actually recommend people do it and

08:20.240 --> 08:23.920
not just sort of hack on a bunch of extensions and themes and then ship it and then just

08:23.920 --> 08:27.440
hope that everybody's packages hit the repo at the right time when you're doing your updates.

08:27.440 --> 08:28.680
Well, I suppose so.

08:28.680 --> 08:34.120
But it does feel like it's Canonical taking on more of the, well, not technical debt,

08:34.120 --> 08:36.200
but you know, taking on more of the development.

08:36.200 --> 08:38.400
Yeah, yeah, I suppose so.

08:38.400 --> 08:39.400
I'll dig around.

08:39.400 --> 08:42.320
I'll do some more reading about it and see if we can't ask some folks that work at Canonical

08:42.320 --> 08:45.780
and get a better sense of this implementation, because it was a little vague in the blog

08:45.780 --> 08:46.780
post too.

08:46.780 --> 08:50.200
So it's an area, I think, that probably deserves further discussion.

08:50.200 --> 08:51.200
Yeah.

08:51.200 --> 08:55.360
All right, well, let's talk about blue phones, BLU.

08:55.360 --> 09:00.480
This is a story that I almost put in last week, but I thought, I don't know if it's

09:00.480 --> 09:02.920
necessarily true.

09:02.920 --> 09:09.200
And it's come back around this week in that Amazon stopped selling them for a while.

09:09.200 --> 09:16.000
So these are low budget Android phones, basically, which are actually these days surprisingly

09:16.000 --> 09:19.320
quite well-specced for the price.

09:19.320 --> 09:20.580
Indeed, yeah.

09:20.580 --> 09:26.960
So Cryptowire found out, I think it was a few months ago, wasn't it, that these phones

09:26.960 --> 09:35.800
were phoning home, haha, back to China with information about text messages and all sorts

09:35.800 --> 09:39.280
of stuff that you want to keep private and don't want to be sending to some server in

09:39.280 --> 09:40.280
China.

09:40.280 --> 09:41.280
Sure.

09:41.280 --> 09:47.000
And it seemed that BLU had sorted it out, but now Cryptowire are saying that they haven't

09:47.000 --> 09:53.100
and that's why Amazon pulled the phones, but now they've basically put them back on the

09:53.100 --> 09:55.320
site or certainly some of them.

09:55.320 --> 10:00.720
So it's a very confusing story that there seems to be a lot of misinformation here.

10:00.720 --> 10:01.720
Yeah.

10:01.720 --> 10:04.960
And what I parsed out from this is a couple of odd things happened on the back end.

10:04.960 --> 10:09.200
Amazon pulled them down, but then other resellers stepped up to do fulfillment.

10:09.200 --> 10:13.480
So the phones essentially continued to ship even though the official BLU store was shut

10:13.480 --> 10:15.920
down, which, come on, Amazon, do your job right.

10:15.920 --> 10:20.160
But in fact, these phones were sending data back to China.

10:20.160 --> 10:25.100
BLU is a Chinese company and there's a piece of software installed on these phones that

10:25.100 --> 10:27.240
sends back different metrics.

10:27.240 --> 10:31.560
And like all of these wonderful pieces of software, the vendor can choose how much they

10:31.560 --> 10:34.520
turn it up and how much they turn it down.

10:34.520 --> 10:41.680
So they can send all the things and they can send just diagnostic metrics, version information

10:41.680 --> 10:46.440
and basic details, which BLU claims that's what they're sending.

10:46.440 --> 10:49.540
But even that, I don't really want to happen.

10:49.540 --> 10:52.200
Maybe if you could opt into it or at least opt out of it.

10:52.200 --> 10:56.080
But if it's happening in the background without you realizing it, I don't know.

10:56.080 --> 11:02.280
This is just what I dislike about OEM generally and stock ROMs.

11:02.280 --> 11:06.760
That's why I use Lineage and other custom ROMs, because at least it's mostly open source.

11:06.760 --> 11:07.760
There you go.

11:07.760 --> 11:09.760
Yeah, that's definitely a safer way to go, I would assume.

11:09.760 --> 11:15.720
This seems to be a reoccurring story, especially on the lower priced Android phones.

11:15.720 --> 11:21.840
And I almost wonder, this is nobody's really going to love this suggestion, but maybe the

11:21.840 --> 11:26.760
better solution would be for Google to share all the data they collect on all of us with

11:26.760 --> 11:27.760
the OEMs.

11:27.760 --> 11:32.880
Now, I don't like it, but then these guys wouldn't be rolling their own software that

11:32.880 --> 11:39.160
uses who knows what type of encryption implementation and is talking to who knows who and is including

11:39.160 --> 11:41.560
who knows what information.

11:41.560 --> 11:46.400
And it might be better if Google just took every little bit of information they're recording

11:46.400 --> 11:50.080
about you, anonymized it, and shared it back with the hardware vendors.

11:50.080 --> 11:51.680
You said gave and shared there.

11:51.680 --> 11:53.220
I don't think that's going to happen.

11:53.220 --> 11:55.040
Maybe sold back to the OEMs.

11:55.040 --> 11:56.040
Yeah, good point.

11:56.040 --> 11:57.040
Good point.

11:57.040 --> 11:58.040
And you know what?

11:58.040 --> 12:00.120
Either way, it just makes Android more creepy.

12:00.120 --> 12:02.760
If the vendors are doing it or if Google's doing it, it's creepy.

12:02.760 --> 12:06.000
Yeah, just send it all back to Apple, eh, like you do.

12:06.000 --> 12:07.720
Yeah, well, it could be worse.

12:07.720 --> 12:10.600
It could be sending it to some unknown open source project that's doing god knows what

12:10.600 --> 12:15.760
with it.

12:15.760 --> 12:16.760
DigitalOcean.com.

12:16.760 --> 12:20.540
Sign up and use our promo code, here's the thing, to support the show and get a $10 credit

12:20.540 --> 12:23.680
on some really, really great services.

12:23.680 --> 12:26.100
DigitalOcean is infrastructure in seconds.

12:26.100 --> 12:31.280
You can sign up and deploy a droplet, that's their parlance, in 55 seconds or less.

12:31.280 --> 12:34.720
One of the things that makes it super fast is they use SSD storage everywhere for your

12:34.720 --> 12:37.680
droplet and for the block storage you can attach as you need it.

12:37.680 --> 12:43.920
They have lightning fast network, 40 gigabits to each hypervisor, highly available storage.

12:43.920 --> 12:47.740
They have built-in monitoring and alerting team accounts if you want to work together

12:47.740 --> 12:48.740
with people.

12:48.740 --> 12:52.880
And one of my favorite things for testing, pre-built droplets with entire open source

12:52.880 --> 12:55.180
stacks or just a base system.

12:55.180 --> 12:56.800
I really love that feature.

12:56.800 --> 13:00.480
Well, I suppose my favorite feature is the straightforward pricing.

13:00.480 --> 13:03.080
DigitalOcean.com, go over there and use our promo code, here's the thing.

13:03.080 --> 13:06.280
You create the account, then you apply it and you're good to go.

13:06.280 --> 13:09.120
DigitalOcean.com, promo code, here's the thing.

13:09.120 --> 13:18.040
Okay, so we've gone 13 proper episodes without mentioning Bitcoin and now we have to do it.

13:18.040 --> 13:19.040
Lucky 13.

13:19.040 --> 13:20.040
Yeah.

13:20.040 --> 13:24.480
So I'm not massively interested in Bitcoin because it's basically a Ponzi scheme as far

13:24.480 --> 13:30.240
as I'm concerned, which may be a controversial opinion, but there you go.

13:30.240 --> 13:31.720
Okay.

13:31.720 --> 13:37.040
That's a big event happened that I've been watching over the last few months unfold.

13:37.040 --> 13:38.600
And it happened this week.

13:38.600 --> 13:43.320
It was basically forked as Bitcoin Cash.

13:43.320 --> 13:48.380
And so if you had Bitcoin already, you're going to keep them, but you've also got these

13:48.380 --> 13:52.640
Bitcoin Cash now, so money has just appeared from nothing.

13:52.640 --> 13:58.560
Well, this is the interesting thing that stands Bitcoin Cash out from all of the other alternative

13:58.560 --> 13:59.560
cryptocurrencies.

13:59.560 --> 14:01.440
They didn't just fork the code.

14:01.440 --> 14:02.640
They forked the blockchain.

14:02.640 --> 14:04.600
They forked the ledger.

14:04.600 --> 14:09.480
And when they made that fork, all of the transactions that have ever occurred on the network went

14:09.480 --> 14:10.480
with them.

14:10.480 --> 14:14.560
So essentially, it's like a parallel timeline now.

14:14.560 --> 14:19.420
It's a side five parallel timeline where the transactions that happened are still valid

14:19.420 --> 14:22.960
in both of these now two separate blockchains.

14:22.960 --> 14:25.160
And it did surprisingly well, didn't it?

14:25.160 --> 14:27.960
Some people were saying that it was just going to tank straight away.

14:27.960 --> 14:28.960
Yeah.

14:28.960 --> 14:33.560
There's been a lot of mounting pressure since I did a podcast a couple of years ago about

14:33.560 --> 14:39.560
Bitcoin called Plan B, and this was beginning to really simmer because it's a core issue.

14:39.560 --> 14:45.400
Original Bitcoin, just BTC, has a limitation of a shared transaction ledger.

14:45.400 --> 14:49.080
Each one of the blocks is limited to one megabyte.

14:49.080 --> 14:51.760
And that's good and bad depending on who you talk to.

14:51.760 --> 14:55.360
And that's one of the things that Bitcoin Cash wanted to change is they wanted to increase

14:55.360 --> 14:56.880
that size.

14:56.880 --> 15:00.160
And that's also good and bad depending on who you talk to, but it actually just comes

15:00.160 --> 15:06.340
down to this really trivial, quote unquote, change.

15:06.340 --> 15:08.720
One megabyte limit to a higher value.

15:08.720 --> 15:13.960
And when you make that change, it has huge ramifications because it means machines that

15:13.960 --> 15:17.800
are trying to download the blockchain and process transactions have to download more

15:17.800 --> 15:20.840
data or less data depending on which blockchain you're on.

15:20.840 --> 15:27.400
That means it may isolate out smaller players who don't have huge amounts of storage and

15:27.400 --> 15:31.660
enable big players or vice versa depending on who you talk to.

15:31.660 --> 15:37.480
So all of the transaction history prior to August 1st, 2017 is in both of these blockchains.

15:37.480 --> 15:43.160
And now we just get to sit back and see which principle is essentially better and watch

15:43.160 --> 15:45.880
which Bitcoin companies step up to support it.

15:45.880 --> 15:49.680
Like Coinbase has been sort of dragging their feet and now they've announced months down

15:49.680 --> 15:52.800
the road they're going to implement Bitcoin Cash support.

15:52.800 --> 15:58.720
Yeah it hasn't had the support that I think the Bitcoin Cash people wanted, has it?

15:58.720 --> 16:00.040
Perhaps yeah, maybe it hasn't.

16:00.040 --> 16:02.660
I think people are waiting to see where it goes.

16:02.660 --> 16:05.680
And I think there's a bigger open source story here.

16:05.680 --> 16:09.740
Blockchain technology itself, distributed database technology that is cryptographically

16:09.740 --> 16:15.600
verified is something that IBM and Oracle and the Linux Foundation and Bank of America

16:15.600 --> 16:19.920
and a lot of other really big players are investing heavily in right now.

16:19.920 --> 16:23.620
So I wonder if they're sitting back and trying to see which is better because they're going

16:23.620 --> 16:29.200
to be basing a lot of their future transaction technology off of blockchain technology.

16:29.200 --> 16:34.280
It's crazy to say it, but these huge players are getting into blockchain applications.

16:34.280 --> 16:39.280
But the bigger block size for them isn't going to be a huge issue because they're not consumers.

16:39.280 --> 16:40.280
It's not everyday people.

16:40.280 --> 16:47.240
They've got the money to pay for huge servers that don't really care whether it's one megabyte,

16:47.240 --> 16:49.280
eight megabytes or even bigger.

16:49.280 --> 16:52.800
And they may do entirely different backend data storage techniques than what we see today

16:52.800 --> 16:54.040
in the open source project.

16:54.040 --> 16:57.580
But it's still interesting to see the organic blockchain stuff really struggling to figure

16:57.580 --> 16:58.740
this out.

16:58.740 --> 17:03.620
There may be a similar sort of battle in the commercial space, different feature sets of

17:03.620 --> 17:04.820
different blockchains.

17:04.820 --> 17:06.640
And this is just the beginning of it.

17:06.640 --> 17:11.040
So you didn't just immediately sell out your Bitcoin cash because you've got a few bitcoins.

17:11.040 --> 17:15.720
You know, I'm just standing by at this point and just kind of going to see where it goes.

17:15.720 --> 17:20.280
Bitcoin itself, as we record, is at thirty two hundred dollars right now.

17:20.280 --> 17:21.700
Yeah, it's nuts.

17:21.700 --> 17:24.960
So I feel like at this point, it could go all the way to the moon and it could crash

17:24.960 --> 17:26.040
down to nothing.

17:26.040 --> 17:28.240
So I'm just going to hold and see where things go.

17:28.240 --> 17:31.720
How much was it worth back in the plan B days, then a couple of hundred?

17:31.720 --> 17:32.720
Yeah.

17:32.720 --> 17:33.720
Yeah, I think so.

17:33.720 --> 17:34.720
Yeah, that's what I mean.

17:34.720 --> 17:38.120
I don't think I ever paid more than two hundred dollars for a Bitcoin.

17:38.120 --> 17:39.120
Maybe not even that much.

17:39.120 --> 17:40.120
Hundred and seventy five.

17:40.120 --> 17:41.120
Yeah.

17:41.120 --> 17:45.840
Man, I thought about investing at the time and I just kept thinking, it's going to crash.

17:45.840 --> 17:46.840
It's going to crash.

17:46.840 --> 17:48.960
It just keeps on going up and up.

17:48.960 --> 17:51.000
That's the classic Bitcoin conundrum.

17:51.000 --> 17:56.960
Well, that's why it's a Ponzi scheme, because, you know, the people who get in now are just

17:56.960 --> 18:00.460
not, you know, they're not going to make any money.

18:00.460 --> 18:01.460
Or maybe they will.

18:01.460 --> 18:05.120
They'll go up to maybe a hundred thousand dollars a Bitcoin, because that's it's got

18:05.120 --> 18:07.400
that built into it, these tiny fractions.

18:07.400 --> 18:10.240
And that was kind of always the plan, wasn't it?

18:10.240 --> 18:13.240
That one no one would trade in one Bitcoin.

18:13.240 --> 18:15.640
It would be tiny fractions of it.

18:15.640 --> 18:16.640
Yeah.

18:16.640 --> 18:17.640
Yeah.

18:17.640 --> 18:18.640
You never know, Joe.

18:18.640 --> 18:22.680
Maybe eventually, eventually you'll set up an online business and take Bitcoin as a payment

18:22.680 --> 18:23.680
and you'll make it big.

18:23.680 --> 18:25.680
You'll become a Bitcoin billionaire.

18:25.680 --> 18:27.840
You never know.

18:27.840 --> 18:32.520
In the meantime, Firefox has a few more experiments that you could burn some time while you watch

18:32.520 --> 18:33.520
the Bitcoin market.

18:33.520 --> 18:34.520
Yeah.

18:34.520 --> 18:39.240
So Mozilla have been spending their Yahoo money on more stuff.

18:39.240 --> 18:47.680
The most interesting one to me is send.firefox.com, which works, I understand, in other browsers.

18:47.680 --> 18:50.280
And it's private encrypted file sharing.

18:50.280 --> 18:56.640
So it's kind of a competitor to WeTransfer, where you basically send a file through email.

18:56.640 --> 18:58.980
So you email them a link.

18:58.980 --> 19:05.400
And in this case, it gets stored on the server for one day or for one download.

19:05.400 --> 19:07.060
And then it's deleted forever.

19:07.060 --> 19:11.780
Isn't that sort of the interesting feature is that it's a limited time link, which means

19:11.780 --> 19:16.080
maybe Mozilla doesn't have to be as concerned about what people are uploading because it

19:16.080 --> 19:17.240
all gets deleted?

19:17.240 --> 19:20.740
Well, does it really get deleted, though, because it's on AWS.

19:20.740 --> 19:24.500
So I suppose it gets deleted after a fashion.

19:24.500 --> 19:30.420
But if there's something that the authorities really want to know about, then they're going

19:30.420 --> 19:32.260
to find it, I would imagine.

19:32.260 --> 19:34.220
This is a really odd thing for them to be working on.

19:34.220 --> 19:35.220
It sure is handy.

19:35.220 --> 19:38.360
But boy, if you're running on S3, that's just nothing but a cost center for them.

19:38.360 --> 19:44.340
If you look at testpilot.firefox.com, there's a couple of other ones that jump out at me,

19:44.340 --> 19:49.220
like a snooze tabs experiment and a container experiment for Firefox.

19:49.220 --> 19:54.700
Not like Docker container, but you can create containers for different social media accounts

19:54.700 --> 19:56.400
or Google accounts.

19:56.400 --> 19:59.840
And every tab in this container will be logged in as one account.

19:59.840 --> 20:03.980
And you can have multiple tabs with multiple containers all up on the screen at the same

20:03.980 --> 20:04.980
time.

20:04.980 --> 20:06.400
So in one tab, I could have my work account.

20:06.400 --> 20:09.180
In another tab, I could have my personal account.

20:09.180 --> 20:10.540
And it's not incognito.

20:10.540 --> 20:12.920
It's contained profiles.

20:12.920 --> 20:18.080
Pretty nice feature, sort of similar to how Chrome does personas, but even a bit nicer

20:18.080 --> 20:19.080
than personas.

20:19.080 --> 20:22.540
I do worry about the CPU and RAM overhead for that, though.

20:22.540 --> 20:24.460
Just throw all the hardware at it, Joe.

20:24.460 --> 20:25.580
It's the modern workload.

20:25.580 --> 20:27.820
It's the web browser workload of the future.

20:27.820 --> 20:31.940
These kind of features, though, where they're building in things like snoozing tabs and

20:31.940 --> 20:36.900
containers into Firefox, that stuff strikes a, that's what I want Mozilla working on kind

20:36.900 --> 20:38.500
of know with me.

20:38.500 --> 20:40.660
Send, pretty nice to have.

20:40.660 --> 20:43.980
But if it went away tomorrow, there'd still be 100 alternatives.

20:43.980 --> 20:46.660
And they wouldn't all be cost centers for the Mozilla project.

20:46.660 --> 20:48.860
But it's a pretty nice one at that.

20:48.860 --> 20:52.820
Yeah, and what's interesting to me about Send is that it's our own source, the Mozilla

20:52.820 --> 20:53.820
public license.

20:53.820 --> 20:54.820
So you can host it yourself.

20:54.820 --> 20:55.820
Yes, you can.

20:55.820 --> 20:56.820
That is really nice.

20:56.820 --> 20:57.820
It's up on GitHub.

20:57.820 --> 20:58.820
I was looking at that.

20:58.820 --> 20:59.820
And that is impressive.

20:59.820 --> 21:03.380
It's cool to see them working on, well, I don't know, code stuff, you know, and not

21:03.380 --> 21:08.420
like so much political stuff or huge, like, the common voice stuff is great, but it seems

21:08.420 --> 21:14.060
so massive and so nebulous, whereas this feels like I can actually apply it to my Firefox

21:14.060 --> 21:15.060
experience right now.

21:15.060 --> 21:16.580
It's like it's really tangible.

21:16.580 --> 21:17.860
So I like to see that kind of stuff.

21:17.860 --> 21:21.660
Well, the common voice, it seems that they are implementing it already with their voice

21:21.660 --> 21:22.660
search.

21:22.660 --> 21:25.140
So they're pretty serious about that stuff.

21:25.140 --> 21:26.140
Mm-hmm.

21:26.140 --> 21:27.140
Yeah.

21:27.140 --> 21:28.180
Red Hat's pretty serious about file systems.

21:28.180 --> 21:32.400
And so that's why when they announced that they were deprecating ButterFS, it caught

21:32.400 --> 21:33.580
a lot of attention.

21:33.580 --> 21:38.260
It doesn't look good for B2FS, ButterFS at this point, does it, if even Red Hat's given

21:38.260 --> 21:39.260
up on it?

21:39.260 --> 21:40.260
Yeah.

21:40.260 --> 21:41.260
Yeah.

21:41.260 --> 21:43.820
They say the ButterFS file system has been in technology preview state since its initial

21:43.820 --> 21:46.740
release of Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

21:46.740 --> 21:51.260
And that Red Hat will not be moving ButterFS to a fully supported feature, and it will

21:51.260 --> 21:55.620
be removed in future major releases of Red Hat Enterprise Linux.

21:55.620 --> 22:05.420
Well, here we are a year, more than a year, after Canonical put ZFS into Ubuntu 16.04,

22:05.420 --> 22:09.280
and they still haven't been sued, and it looks like they've got away with it.

22:09.280 --> 22:13.480
They would say there was nothing to get away with in the first place.

22:13.480 --> 22:16.940
But Red Hat is just not willing to take that risk, by the looks of things.

22:16.940 --> 22:21.060
They'd rather develop something completely new, because they don't have any faith in

22:21.060 --> 22:25.560
B2FS, and they don't want to take the risk on ZFS.

22:25.560 --> 22:31.700
So that really speaks volumes to me, that I thought that Canonical would be the test

22:31.700 --> 22:34.980
ground, and if they got away with it, then Red Hat would follow suit.

22:34.980 --> 22:39.780
Do you suppose it's because Red Hat's principally a US company, and so perhaps they have a different

22:39.780 --> 22:41.500
target painted on their back?

22:41.500 --> 22:43.820
That is certainly possible, yeah.

22:43.820 --> 22:45.180
I wonder.

22:45.180 --> 22:50.820
It is damning for ButterFS, because I think what it really speaks to, and I go back to

22:50.820 --> 22:55.580
this, is it seems like eventually ButterFS could be turned into something pretty great,

22:55.580 --> 22:58.160
because it's close.

22:58.160 --> 23:04.620
But that name is now associated with a dumpster fire file system, and it's bad branding.

23:04.620 --> 23:09.900
And if you don't want to be the consultant or the sys admin going in and saying, yeah,

23:09.900 --> 23:13.940
I'd like to deploy all of these terabytes and terabytes and terabytes of very important

23:13.940 --> 23:20.660
files on ButterFS, that's a really weak case to make, and it just takes somebody Googling

23:20.660 --> 23:23.820
your proposal and then just totally shooting you down.

23:23.820 --> 23:25.660
It's essentially a toxic brand.

23:25.660 --> 23:30.980
Yeah, whereas XFS that Red Hat seems to be doubling down on doesn't have that baggage.

23:30.980 --> 23:31.980
Right.

23:31.980 --> 23:34.500
XFS is really, really well respected.

23:34.500 --> 23:37.340
I've deployed it myself in production for years.

23:37.340 --> 23:43.380
It's a solid file system, it has a great lineage, and if you combine Red Hat's newfound love

23:43.380 --> 23:49.900
for XFS with some recent acquisitions and an overall project they're working on, you

23:49.900 --> 23:53.700
start to see the story of what could be their ZFS alternative.

23:53.700 --> 24:00.580
So on August 1st, Red Hat announced they've acquired Permabit, which is a company that

24:00.580 --> 24:06.500
builds data duplication, or sorry, de-duplication and compression software.

24:06.500 --> 24:11.440
You may not have heard of them because they focused on selling directly to OEM, so they

24:11.440 --> 24:14.220
would bundle their solution on top of Linux.

24:14.220 --> 24:21.900
It includes kernel modules and Red Hat seems to think it's better for containers and virtualization

24:21.900 --> 24:26.660
where they have really fast storage and they want to compress down on that really fast

24:26.660 --> 24:27.660
storage.

24:27.660 --> 24:31.900
Having talked to Alan Jude about this, it actually is a very common work case because

24:31.900 --> 24:38.900
CPUs are so fast and NVMe storage and SSDs are so fast that the system can read and write

24:38.900 --> 24:43.520
more when it's compressed and read it faster because the files are small, so you actually

24:43.520 --> 24:47.080
get higher throughput using compression and you get more storage space.

24:47.080 --> 24:49.040
It's not like your grandpa's compression.

24:49.040 --> 24:53.060
It's some really modern day stuff and Permabit's one of the companies that's working on this

24:53.060 --> 24:55.780
on Linux, well, and now they're owned by Red Hat.

24:55.780 --> 25:01.380
And so their new strategy is going to be called Stratis, which is not ready yet and it's looking

25:01.380 --> 25:07.540
like it's maybe two or three years out before we have feature parity with ZFS, but they

25:07.540 --> 25:08.980
are really going for it.

25:08.980 --> 25:10.900
Yeah, Stratis is an interesting approach.

25:10.900 --> 25:14.580
So a lot of you out there will love the fact that it's supposedly it's written in Rust,

25:14.580 --> 25:18.580
which if you're going to be building file system layered tools, Rust is a good language

25:18.580 --> 25:19.580
to use.

25:19.580 --> 25:24.560
So in this scenario, you could take a base file system like XFS and then Stratis takes

25:24.560 --> 25:29.260
a layered approach to replace ZFS's individual components.

25:29.260 --> 25:33.620
So Stratis can lay on a copy on write layer using components that are pretty much already

25:33.620 --> 25:37.580
built into Linux, a raid layer using, again, stuff already built into Linux.

25:37.580 --> 25:42.300
In fact, most of the functionality in ZFS is throughout Linux in all these different

25:42.300 --> 25:43.300
parts.

25:43.300 --> 25:45.580
It's just not all in one single file system.

25:45.580 --> 25:49.820
So Stratis is a layered approach that will sit on top of XFS or potentially other file

25:49.820 --> 25:54.140
systems and bring in these types of features, probably using a little LVM on the back end

25:54.140 --> 25:55.140
too.

25:55.140 --> 25:59.380
Now, some of you may cringe at this, it's taking some of Linux's most well-developed,

25:59.380 --> 26:03.380
tried and true features and bringing them all under the Stratis umbrella to all work

26:03.380 --> 26:04.380
together.

26:04.380 --> 26:05.380
It's actually a pretty solid approach.

26:05.380 --> 26:08.780
If you take tools that are tried and true in production in the enterprise environment

26:08.780 --> 26:12.740
for years and get them all working together, it's probably going to work pretty quick.

26:12.740 --> 26:15.740
It's probably going to be pretty solid and trusted.

26:15.740 --> 26:17.180
Or you could just use ZFS.

26:17.180 --> 26:18.500
Or yes, you could just use ZFS.

26:18.500 --> 26:23.780
In fact, this is the big competition is canonical is saying, hey, look, you want an Ubuntu LTS,

26:23.780 --> 26:28.060
you got live patch, lots of people love to run it in production, and now we've got the

26:28.060 --> 26:29.060
ZFS file system.

26:29.060 --> 26:30.980
Come on, we've already got this stuff.

26:30.980 --> 26:35.340
And you've got to imagine this is Red Hat going, crap, ButterFS didn't get there.

26:35.340 --> 26:36.580
We've got to get this going.

26:36.580 --> 26:38.620
It has to be production ready.

26:38.620 --> 26:42.620
Enterprise customers are expecting a certain level of performance reliability out of the

26:42.620 --> 26:43.940
box today.

26:43.940 --> 26:44.940
We've got to pivot.

26:44.940 --> 26:48.060
We've got to, quote unquote, pivot, Joe, and make this change.

26:48.060 --> 26:54.540
And this has got to be a response in at least some little amount to Ubuntu shipping ZFS.

26:54.540 --> 26:55.900
I just have to see it that way.

26:55.900 --> 27:00.180
But it just goes to show that BtreeFS must be in a pretty ropey state.

27:00.180 --> 27:03.940
Otherwise, why don't Red Hat just put their resources into that and make it better and

27:03.940 --> 27:04.940
improve it?

27:04.940 --> 27:05.940
I think it's the brand thing.

27:05.940 --> 27:08.180
I think it's the dumpster fire branding.

27:08.180 --> 27:11.720
It's just gotten to the point where nobody's really, well, it's a joke.

27:11.720 --> 27:14.180
It's a bit of a joke file system.

27:14.180 --> 27:17.860
And I think they're just saying, well, we can't compete with that.

27:17.860 --> 27:19.160
We're not getting a lot of traction.

27:19.160 --> 27:20.820
It's a hard sale.

27:20.820 --> 27:24.260
And I think the other question I have to ask now is, when does SUSE make a change?

27:24.260 --> 27:25.260
Or will they?

27:25.260 --> 27:26.880
Well, I was going to say, tell that to Richard Brown.

27:26.880 --> 27:27.880
See what he says.

27:27.880 --> 27:28.880
Well, I would ask him.

27:28.880 --> 27:29.880
You're going to see him soon.

27:29.880 --> 27:30.880
You should bring it up.

27:30.880 --> 27:31.880
Yeah.

27:31.880 --> 27:33.860
Well, when I last spoke to him, I asked him about it.

27:33.860 --> 27:34.980
And he said, it's fine.

27:34.980 --> 27:39.660
They just don't put in the RAID stuff that is broken, and otherwise, it works fine for

27:39.660 --> 27:40.660
them.

27:40.660 --> 27:41.660
Yeah.

27:41.660 --> 27:42.660
You use a couple of build flags.

27:42.660 --> 27:43.660
You throw on a couple of patches.

27:43.660 --> 27:45.420
You disable a couple of features.

27:45.420 --> 27:46.420
It's fine.

27:46.420 --> 27:47.420
There's nothing wrong with that.

27:47.420 --> 27:51.100
The file system should work.

27:51.100 --> 27:55.460
I wonder if they will move away from it, because they do seem pretty sold on it, don't they?

27:55.460 --> 27:56.460
Yeah.

27:56.460 --> 27:57.460
It's pretty well integrated.

27:57.460 --> 27:58.940
Part of me, to be honest, hopes they don't.

27:58.940 --> 28:02.620
Wouldn't it be great if they just don't care about the dumpster fire branding, and they

28:02.620 --> 28:04.140
just kept hacking away at it?

28:04.140 --> 28:08.060
And say, five years, we come back to it, and it's solid.

28:08.060 --> 28:09.720
They've really made it into a great product.

28:09.720 --> 28:10.820
That could be great for everybody.

28:10.820 --> 28:11.820
Yeah.

28:11.820 --> 28:13.140
And then we've got three options at that point.

28:13.140 --> 28:14.140
Yeah.

28:14.140 --> 28:15.140
Take that, ZFS.

28:15.140 --> 28:16.140
A proper Linux thing.

28:16.140 --> 28:19.780
In one replacement, we build three great ones that all have their own advantages, and nobody

28:19.780 --> 28:20.780
can decide.

28:20.780 --> 28:21.780
That's how it should be.

28:21.780 --> 28:22.780
Yep.

28:22.780 --> 28:23.780
Exactly.

28:23.780 --> 28:24.780
Yeah.

28:24.780 --> 28:25.780
OK.

28:25.780 --> 28:26.780
Good.
