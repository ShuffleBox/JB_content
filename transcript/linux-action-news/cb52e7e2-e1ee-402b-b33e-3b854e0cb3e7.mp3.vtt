00:00.000 --> 00:08.800
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, episode 196, recorded on July 5th, 2021.

00:08.800 --> 00:09.800
I'm Chris.

00:09.800 --> 00:10.800
And I'm Wes.

00:10.800 --> 00:11.800
Well, hello, Wes.

00:11.800 --> 00:12.840
Let's do the news.

00:12.840 --> 00:19.800
System76 has released PapaWes 2104 with their new COSMIC desktop.

00:19.800 --> 00:27.760
COSMIC, which System76 says stands for Computer Operating System Main Interface Components,

00:27.760 --> 00:30.480
has their new experience on top of the GNOME Shell.

00:30.480 --> 00:32.420
I like that backronym there.

00:32.420 --> 00:33.420
That's a good one.

00:33.420 --> 00:35.800
Computer Operating System Main Interface Components.

00:35.800 --> 00:40.360
System76 says the COSMIC desktop is the result of user feedback that they collected from

00:40.360 --> 00:45.600
various sources and polling Pop OS users, and it has been designed to be compatible

00:45.600 --> 00:47.280
with GNOME Shell 338.

00:47.280 --> 00:51.480
So in theory, it's portable to other distributions with the correct dependencies.

00:51.480 --> 00:57.720
As the name implies, Pop OS 2104 itself is based on Ubuntu 2104, so that means it includes

00:57.720 --> 01:02.320
the Linux 5.11 kernel and all the goodies of that general Ubuntu release.

01:02.320 --> 01:04.600
What's the new experience like?

01:04.600 --> 01:09.520
Well, COSMIC uses a dock on the bottom of the screen by default.

01:09.520 --> 01:13.900
You may not love that it takes up the entire bottom of the screen by default, actually,

01:13.900 --> 01:17.200
but there's a little toggle if you want the more minimal version.

01:17.200 --> 01:23.040
Also quite notably, it separates GNOME's activities overview into individually accessible

01:23.040 --> 01:28.520
workspace and application screens, and does that quite prominently, both with icons in

01:28.520 --> 01:31.840
that new dock and with some stuff up in the top bar.

01:31.840 --> 01:35.380
So I think this is a feature they want people to try and to play with.

01:35.380 --> 01:38.080
And notably, they're vertical workspaces, too.

01:38.080 --> 01:39.080
Indeed.

01:39.080 --> 01:43.760
And for you keyboard warriors out there, there's also a new keyboard-centric app launcher.

01:43.760 --> 01:48.520
They need a good name for that that doesn't sound like Launch because their actual keyboard

01:48.520 --> 01:49.520
is called Launch.

01:49.520 --> 01:50.520
I'm confused already.

01:50.520 --> 01:55.000
I mean, they have a keyboard-driven app launcher, but it's pretty great.

01:55.000 --> 01:59.600
When you first install Pop, one of the things that I like now with the COSMIC layer on top

01:59.600 --> 02:04.000
is you get a couple additional setup questions that are really easy to go through.

02:04.000 --> 02:08.480
And anything that you decide right there in the beginning can easily be found in GNOME

02:08.480 --> 02:10.520
system settings later if you change your mind.

02:10.520 --> 02:15.040
Like for example, I tried the full bar down at the bottom, but ultimately I decided I

02:15.040 --> 02:19.200
wanted it on the side of my screen and I didn't want it to go end to end.

02:19.200 --> 02:22.200
I just wanted it to take up as much space as the icons required.

02:22.200 --> 02:25.840
And I just kind of took a guess as to where that might be in GNOME system settings.

02:25.840 --> 02:28.160
And it was exactly where I expected it to be.

02:28.160 --> 02:30.200
And it was really simple to change that.

02:30.200 --> 02:33.560
But that launcher you mentioned, Wes, that is special.

02:33.560 --> 02:36.080
This might be one of my favorite launchers I've ever used.

02:36.080 --> 02:40.560
When you tap that super key, it pops right up, faster than when you would say traditionally

02:40.560 --> 02:43.060
see the GNOME overview come up.

02:43.060 --> 02:45.080
And then they have truly instant search results.

02:45.080 --> 02:49.360
So as you begin typing the application, like you'd expect, it starts giving you answers.

02:49.360 --> 02:55.520
Each answer has a control plus a number that you can tap and it'll immediately execute

02:55.520 --> 02:57.080
that application.

02:57.080 --> 03:01.560
And you can do a lot of the things that I love with KRunner on Plasma, but now you can

03:01.560 --> 03:06.040
do it on a GNOME-based desktop, which is nice because they've done a really good job

03:06.040 --> 03:07.680
implementing it.

03:07.680 --> 03:12.720
Along with that, they've done a fantastic job of integrating gestures into the cosmic

03:12.720 --> 03:13.720
experience.

03:13.720 --> 03:18.260
You can swipe four fingers right on the trackpad to open the applications overview.

03:18.260 --> 03:21.760
If you swipe four fingers left, it opens up the workspace overview.

03:21.760 --> 03:24.680
Four fingers down, you can go to a different workspace.

03:24.680 --> 03:26.880
Three fingers to switch between open applications.

03:26.880 --> 03:29.400
There's several gestures in there that you can work with.

03:29.400 --> 03:33.960
And then, of course, baked in as well is their latest iteration of their tiling extension,

03:33.960 --> 03:36.400
which sits in a pretty good sweet spot for me.

03:36.400 --> 03:42.400
My only kind of complaint with it is I wish I could just turn it on for certain workspaces.

03:42.400 --> 03:46.600
If I could have like tiling on workspace two and three, but workspace one was free floating

03:46.600 --> 03:49.320
or something like that, oh, man, that'd be the sweet spot.

03:49.320 --> 03:50.320
And maybe it'll get there one day.

03:50.320 --> 03:54.480
Yeah, I think it's still pretty early days for Cosmic.

03:54.480 --> 03:59.120
And its design choices and the way it works, I think, means there's some upsides and downsides.

03:59.120 --> 04:03.720
I really like that it's just a set of components that you can kind of have on or off individually

04:03.720 --> 04:06.120
and you could bring to your own desktops.

04:06.120 --> 04:09.580
But that does mean, you know, they're just building on top of GNOME, and I think that

04:09.580 --> 04:14.780
constrains and limits quite everything that they might be able to do, at least so far.

04:14.780 --> 04:18.520
It's especially nice to see that multi-touch gesture support you mentioned, because one

04:18.520 --> 04:24.240
thing that is quite notably missing from this release is GNOME 40, and especially some of

04:24.240 --> 04:29.560
that GTK4 GPU acceleration that we've come to love.

04:29.560 --> 04:32.680
But again, that's something that's somewhat constrained based on how Pop!

04:32.680 --> 04:33.680
OS works, right?

04:33.680 --> 04:37.800
It's building on top of Ubuntu, and you kind of wait for Ubuntu to catch up first.

04:37.800 --> 04:38.800
Yeah.

04:38.800 --> 04:44.800
And I suppose the idea might be get this built now while they're in the pre-LTS phase, and

04:44.800 --> 04:47.840
maybe it's easier to bring it to GNOME 40 than wait.

04:47.840 --> 04:48.840
Right.

04:48.840 --> 04:52.200
This is, in many ways, the time you have to flesh all this out, figure it out, and it's

04:52.200 --> 04:54.540
easy to criticize something that's new.

04:54.540 --> 04:55.960
We do plenty of that.

04:55.960 --> 04:59.340
But sometimes you do have to put something out there before you can really start making

04:59.340 --> 05:00.420
it better.

05:00.420 --> 05:03.480
But even with the warts it has, I think Pop!

05:03.480 --> 05:07.400
OS is starting to feel like its own unique experience.

05:07.400 --> 05:08.700
There's a bit of a question there, right?

05:08.700 --> 05:11.000
Because isn't it just Ubuntu and GNOME?

05:11.000 --> 05:13.080
But when you sit down in front of Pop!

05:13.080 --> 05:17.080
OS 2104, it feels like something all its own.

05:17.080 --> 05:22.040
Although if GNOME Shell in general isn't your thing, well, I don't think Cosmic will

05:22.040 --> 05:24.040
likely be for you.

05:24.040 --> 05:28.680
But if you're a Linux desktop nerd, it's definitely worth a look.

05:28.680 --> 05:33.960
And be sure to tune into recent episodes of Coder Radio for ongoing coverage of using

05:33.960 --> 05:37.720
Pop and Cosmic as a development workstation.

05:37.720 --> 05:42.440
Speaking of us long-time desktop Linux nerds, we've been reeling over what's happening

05:42.440 --> 05:43.440
to Audacity.

05:43.440 --> 05:46.040
You may have noticed there's a pitchfork shortage this week.

05:46.040 --> 05:50.080
That's because the Muse group that now owns Audacity has got everyone upset again.

05:50.080 --> 05:53.760
Now, if you're not familiar with what I'm talking about, it all starts about two months

05:53.760 --> 05:54.760
ago.

05:54.760 --> 05:57.440
Audacity was acquired by the Muse group.

05:57.440 --> 05:59.940
They're known for their MuseScore app.

05:59.940 --> 06:02.680
They also run the Ultimate Guitar website.

06:02.680 --> 06:07.200
Since their purchase of Audacity, they have introduced a data collection policy that greatly

06:07.200 --> 06:08.740
upset the community.

06:08.740 --> 06:13.720
They introduced a CLA that had vague justification and was also quite alarming.

06:13.720 --> 06:17.980
And this week, things really came to a peak.

06:17.980 --> 06:21.980
Some headlines have summed it up as Audacity is now spyware.

06:21.980 --> 06:24.960
But of course, the truth really lies somewhere in between.

06:24.960 --> 06:30.080
In a privacy notice update, the Muse group outlined what users can expect in Audacity

06:30.080 --> 06:31.080
3.0.3.

06:31.080 --> 06:38.560
The multinational company updated the policy stating they collect OS version, user IP,

06:38.560 --> 06:45.680
CPU, error messages, and, quote, any data necessary for law enforcement.

06:45.680 --> 06:50.080
As to who those law enforcement agencies might be, their policy reads,

06:50.080 --> 06:55.840
All your data is stored on our servers in the European Economic Area, however, we are

06:55.840 --> 07:01.000
occasionally required to share your personal data with our main office in Russia and our

07:01.000 --> 07:03.440
external counsel in the USA.

07:03.440 --> 07:09.600
Additionally, they state that they might share your data with anyone they classify as a third

07:09.600 --> 07:14.480
party, advisors, or potential buyers.

07:14.480 --> 07:19.600
That same page contains a boilerplate attempt to prevent kids under the age of 13 from using

07:19.600 --> 07:25.320
Audacity in their privacy policy, which, in my opinion, is a violation of the GPL.

07:25.320 --> 07:30.400
As you would expect, however, somehow surprising to the Muse group, there were a lot of angry

07:30.400 --> 07:34.100
reactions all over the open source community.

07:34.100 --> 07:38.240
Users on GitHub and Reddit and many other places are calling to fork Audacity, which

07:38.240 --> 07:40.360
seems like it's actually picking up traction.

07:40.360 --> 07:43.800
We're probably going to see one of these actually gain adoption, which we'll keep an eye on

07:43.800 --> 07:44.800
for you.

07:44.800 --> 07:50.920
Yeah, really, this entire privacy policy reads kind of just like some legal boilerplate,

07:50.920 --> 07:54.600
you know, something that might be considered perfectly normal, or at least, you know, what

07:54.600 --> 07:57.680
you see day to day in the commercial software world.

07:57.680 --> 08:02.120
But of course, that kind of stuff is deemed pretty invasive and rude in the free software

08:02.120 --> 08:03.680
community.

08:03.680 --> 08:09.080
Especially since Audacity represented a set of ideas and philosophies about software,

08:09.080 --> 08:12.880
how that software should respect its users, who that software is for.

08:12.880 --> 08:19.520
From what it looks like on the outside, the Muse group doesn't really seem to get that.

08:19.520 --> 08:24.880
As we record on this Monday morning, Daniel Ray, the head of strategy at the Muse group,

08:24.880 --> 08:30.160
posted a clarification of the privacy policy and essentially confirmed the boilerplate

08:30.160 --> 08:35.040
nature of the language, and said he believed the strong reaction was due largely to unclear

08:35.040 --> 08:37.000
phrasing in the privacy policy.

08:37.000 --> 08:41.960
Yeah, and then he goes on to say that they are in the process of rectifying that, and

08:41.960 --> 08:45.960
he makes some solid attempts to walk back the harshness of the language in the privacy

08:45.960 --> 08:50.240
policy and tries to put context around the term personal data and its relation to the

08:50.240 --> 08:51.680
GDPR.

08:51.680 --> 08:55.720
What I don't read in there is any correction or update regarding the age restriction of

08:55.720 --> 08:56.820
Audacity.

08:56.820 --> 08:59.960
And again, in my opinion, that's possibly a GPL violation.

08:59.960 --> 09:03.640
It would be nice to have seen them address that since a GPL violation could be a pretty

09:03.640 --> 09:07.320
big deal, especially if they managed to do one in two months of owning the thing.

09:07.320 --> 09:11.720
Well, the other part too, I think, is whether or not it is violating the letter of the GPL

09:11.720 --> 09:15.880
or exactly which version of the software this applies to, since it's on their actual website

09:15.880 --> 09:19.280
and not the GitHub repository, at least to my knowledge.

09:19.280 --> 09:24.840
It certainly violates the spirit, and Audacity is widely used for educational purposes for

09:24.840 --> 09:25.920
children in schools.

09:25.920 --> 09:30.440
So it's really a shame if they think this software is not intended for children, because

09:30.440 --> 09:32.440
at least up to now, it's been a huge benefit.

09:32.440 --> 09:37.380
Yeah, it seems like it's fork time, Wes, and it seems like the community's language and

09:37.380 --> 09:44.320
tone has shifted to a resignation that, yeah, it's just unfortunate that it's fork time.

09:44.320 --> 09:48.320
When I looked around GitHub this morning just before we recorded, I saw several that have

09:48.320 --> 09:49.320
already launched.

09:49.320 --> 09:53.880
But, you know, I wonder, Wes, if this isn't going to end up like the OpenOffice, LibreOffice

09:53.880 --> 09:59.800
situation, where the original brand name of OpenOffice is so strong that it continues

09:59.800 --> 10:00.800
on.

10:00.800 --> 10:04.660
Even with slow, lackluster updates, people still are recommending you go get OpenOffice

10:04.660 --> 10:08.760
and people are still downloading it by the hundreds of thousands.

10:08.760 --> 10:13.880
It's possible, like, you know, Audacity is so established at this point, and people that

10:13.880 --> 10:18.400
want to grab it, like schools and whatnot, they're not really following these news stories.

10:18.400 --> 10:19.400
Exactly.

10:19.400 --> 10:23.600
And there doesn't seem to be any mechanism in place to control access.

10:23.600 --> 10:27.600
And at least for some of the telemetry here, that's all still configured behind build time

10:27.600 --> 10:28.600
flags.

10:28.600 --> 10:31.900
So much like OpenOffice, you imagine that there's going to be distributions and things

10:31.900 --> 10:37.000
that they ship the regular brand of Audacity, even if they've perhaps got both in the repo.

10:37.000 --> 10:41.000
Yeah, and that never is really a great place to be in, where distributions start stripping

10:41.000 --> 10:44.360
out things that the upstream developers are including.

10:44.360 --> 10:48.280
And if they include this stuff, I'm going to just start using Audacity with a Flatpak

10:48.280 --> 10:51.800
and I will just disable network access for that Flatpak.

10:51.800 --> 10:53.480
That is an option.

10:53.480 --> 10:57.840
But I would much rather just have something that the community maintains that can take

10:57.840 --> 11:02.360
the GPL bits of Audacity's improvements that work and not be associated with the Muse group.

11:02.360 --> 11:06.280
Because it's obvious to me at this point that the Muse group doesn't really even appreciate

11:06.280 --> 11:09.060
or understand what they have.

11:09.060 --> 11:12.880
And in my opinion, they have destroyed their relationship with the community.

11:12.880 --> 11:18.640
When you read through the GitHub comments, even on the retraction, all faith is lost.

11:18.640 --> 11:23.440
Because every time it's been this total screw up from the introduction of the project and

11:23.440 --> 11:28.440
how it was introduced and how they handled that, from the communication of the CLA and

11:28.440 --> 11:33.640
the telemetry information, each time the Muse group is shocked and surprised that people

11:33.640 --> 11:35.440
could possibly be upset.

11:35.440 --> 11:40.880
That a community made up predominantly developers and computer users and geeks could be upset

11:40.880 --> 11:45.680
by a privacy policy that is the exact kind of privacy policy that upsets developers and

11:45.680 --> 11:46.680
computer geeks.

11:46.680 --> 11:49.800
Like they're just totally out of touch and that doesn't seem like the right group that's

11:49.800 --> 11:55.880
in charge of what used to be, and I hate to use the past tense, what used to be the quintessential

11:55.880 --> 11:57.840
free audio editor.

11:57.840 --> 11:58.840
It's really a shame.

11:58.840 --> 12:03.880
And amidst all of these little scandals, we also haven't necessarily seen the sort of

12:03.880 --> 12:08.500
investment and improvements in Audacity that I think many of us were hoping might sort

12:08.500 --> 12:12.080
of make any of these changes worth it in the long run.

12:12.080 --> 12:13.400
Yeah, that's a great point.

12:13.400 --> 12:17.800
It wouldn't have been fantastic to see some of the improvements land first and then some

12:17.800 --> 12:23.680
of these extreme changes land second and maybe communicated better.

12:23.680 --> 12:27.440
In the meantime, though, it doesn't really come into effect for you.

12:27.440 --> 12:31.900
It's not until the next release of Audacity that this all comes into effect.

12:31.900 --> 12:37.300
The current version, 3.0.2, does not contain data collection or has any kind of networking

12:37.300 --> 12:38.920
features added to it yet.

12:38.920 --> 12:43.400
In 3.0.3, they intend to ship it with data collection and networking features that will

12:43.400 --> 12:47.600
report home your IP, your CPU information, et cetera.

12:47.600 --> 12:50.840
They hold the IP for 24 hours because, for some reason, they need to know when you're

12:50.840 --> 12:53.800
converting a WAV file to an MP3.

12:53.800 --> 12:56.000
More bad news.

12:56.000 --> 13:02.160
Announced last summer, and starting this August, Google will require that new Play Store apps

13:02.160 --> 13:08.200
will have to be published using something known as the Android App Bundle format.

13:08.200 --> 13:13.760
If you're not familiar, and I certainly wasn't, the Android App Bundle is Android's new official

13:13.760 --> 13:20.000
publishing format that replaces APKs, at least for developers, when submitting apps to the

13:20.000 --> 13:21.360
Play Store.

13:21.360 --> 13:26.640
Google says it should offer a more efficient way to build and release your app.

13:26.640 --> 13:28.120
It works essentially like this.

13:28.120 --> 13:31.940
Instead of building a bunch of different APKs and uploading those to Google's store after

13:31.940 --> 13:37.520
signing them yourself, now you'll just upload the one Android App Bundle format.

13:37.520 --> 13:43.560
Google will generate a whole bunch of device-specific APKs and then sign all of those itself.

13:43.560 --> 13:49.040
Right, so the Google Play Store is doing the signing, and they're still distributing APKs

13:49.040 --> 13:54.560
to the phones, but developers will not be producing APKs anymore.

13:54.560 --> 13:58.480
I think some people are a little uneasy about this because the APK is an open format, and

13:58.480 --> 14:04.080
it's also easier to sideload, say, an APK than an app bundle, as far as I could tell.

14:04.080 --> 14:08.600
But this requirement is only going to apply to new apps, according to Google, and they're

14:08.600 --> 14:12.920
going to do the backend work to actually generate APKs and then make it available for you as

14:12.920 --> 14:18.360
a developer to download that APK from the Play Store if you want a local copy of it.

14:18.360 --> 14:22.760
But I think the question we had was, how does this impact, say, F-Droid?

14:22.760 --> 14:27.600
I think there will be some confusion for sideloaders because one of the features of these app bundles

14:27.600 --> 14:31.300
is you can have sort of dynamic parts, like you might have an optional feature for your

14:31.300 --> 14:34.900
app that only gets loaded on some platforms or downloaded later after the fact.

14:34.900 --> 14:39.060
But it sounds like if you don't have all the required components, you might get some failures

14:39.060 --> 14:40.480
during sideloading.

14:40.480 --> 14:46.360
But for actual F-Droid itself, it's almost like Google Play is becoming more like F-Droid

14:46.360 --> 14:51.540
because while F-Droid has only open source apps, they actually build all of the APKs

14:51.540 --> 14:52.840
and sign them on F-Droid.

14:52.840 --> 14:57.620
I didn't realize that until we looked into this, but you submit your app as source code,

14:57.620 --> 15:01.760
they do the building, they do the signing with a few exceptions, and there are some

15:01.760 --> 15:03.640
well-known exceptions out there.

15:03.640 --> 15:06.960
But this is the way it's been done for a while.

15:06.960 --> 15:11.720
Now the Play Store is kind of changing to this model.

15:11.720 --> 15:13.480
And I still don't like it.

15:13.480 --> 15:18.480
I know there's just something about that bundle that I just, I feel like it's just adding

15:18.480 --> 15:24.000
one more layer to making it a little bit trickier to get outside the Play Store.

15:24.000 --> 15:29.040
In some ways, this reminds me of AMP, where there are some benefits out there, faster

15:29.040 --> 15:35.800
load pages, smaller asset sizes that are beneficial for some pages, the biggest pages, the most

15:35.800 --> 15:37.120
complicated pages.

15:37.120 --> 15:41.000
I think that's probably true of app bundles for some applications.

15:41.000 --> 15:46.960
But there are real downsides that are costs here, and is anyone really weighing those?

15:46.960 --> 15:56.160
Doesn't feel like it.

15:56.160 --> 15:57.680
Leno.com slash LAN.

15:57.680 --> 16:00.600
Go there to get $100 in credit and support the show.

16:00.600 --> 16:04.680
No matter what skill level you're at or what technology stack you use, Leno can help your

16:04.680 --> 16:07.200
ideas come to life on the web.

16:07.200 --> 16:11.840
And if you ever have any trouble, Linode has the best customer support in the business.

16:11.840 --> 16:15.760
Awarded by the people, and along with hundreds of guides and tutorials, you're gonna get

16:15.760 --> 16:17.600
up and going in no time.

16:17.600 --> 16:19.600
Linode feels like part of our team.

16:19.600 --> 16:23.160
Behind the scenes, it's what makes JB possible.

16:23.160 --> 16:26.720
If it weren't for these spots, you'd never know that Linode is making all this infrastructure

16:26.720 --> 16:28.240
hum because it just runs.

16:28.240 --> 16:31.920
It's fast, it's reliable, and it's making your experience great.

16:31.920 --> 16:35.560
Linode's been easy to use and has a powerful cloud dashboard.

16:35.560 --> 16:40.580
With S3 compatible object storage, cloud firewalls, and simple one-click application deployments

16:40.580 --> 16:45.600
with their super fast networking, they are their own ISP, and so much more, you'll find

16:45.600 --> 16:48.200
there's tons of uses of that $100 credit.

16:48.200 --> 16:53.200
So go over there to Leno.com slash LAN and get that credit and support the show.

16:53.200 --> 16:58.160
Their one-click Minecraft server lets you specify features like NPCs, game mode, all

16:58.160 --> 17:02.920
the critical little things you need to set up all in one nice, easy-to-use screen.

17:02.920 --> 17:08.080
And you know, 66% of companies save money working with a mix of alternative cloud providers

17:08.080 --> 17:10.980
instead of just relying on one big old hyperscaler.

17:10.980 --> 17:13.500
Linode can be part of your multi-cloud strategy.

17:13.500 --> 17:15.520
That's why you gotta check it out for yourself.

17:15.520 --> 17:25.200
Linode.com slash LAN.

17:25.200 --> 17:26.200
Linux.ting.com.

17:26.200 --> 17:29.920
Thank you to Ting for sponsoring this episode of the Linux Action News.

17:29.920 --> 17:33.920
If you're sick of overpaying for cell service, go see how much you could save and then take

17:33.920 --> 17:37.880
$25 off of that at linux.ting.com.

17:37.880 --> 17:40.840
Ting is an MVNO, or a mobile virtual network operator.

17:40.840 --> 17:46.840
That means Ting mobile customers get the same access as the customers of, say, the big networks,

17:46.840 --> 17:49.720
but with better customer service and at a lower cost.

17:49.720 --> 17:54.200
With Ting mobile, you get the same coast-to-coast coverage as you would with the big guys, but

17:54.200 --> 17:56.280
you just pay less for it.

17:56.280 --> 17:59.040
And Ting's plans are way simpler and straightforward.

17:59.040 --> 18:03.940
In fact, I love their new set 12 plan, which gives you 12 gigs of data with unlimited talk

18:03.940 --> 18:06.660
and text for just 35 bucks a month.

18:06.660 --> 18:08.480
And a good family plan is hard to find.

18:08.480 --> 18:14.200
But with Ting's Flex plans, they address this particular pain point in a way only Ting can.

18:14.200 --> 18:18.200
You add as many lines to your account as you need, you just pay 10 bucks per line.

18:18.200 --> 18:22.800
Every line gets unlimited texts and calls, and every line shares that same pool of data.

18:22.800 --> 18:27.640
And if you need two, 20, or a lot more gigs, Ting's got a perfect plan for you.

18:27.640 --> 18:32.880
And every plan gets access to Ting's award-winning customer service with nationwide LTE and 5G

18:32.880 --> 18:37.440
coverage, plus the freedom of no contracts ever.

18:37.440 --> 18:38.840
It's simple to switch to Ting.

18:38.840 --> 18:42.920
Pretty much any phone works on Ting, so just head over to linux.ting.com, check your current

18:42.920 --> 18:46.760
phone, create an account, pick the plan that's right for you, and then Ting will send you

18:46.760 --> 18:47.760
a SIM card.

18:47.760 --> 18:50.040
You pop that in, you get activated in minutes.

18:50.040 --> 18:53.640
Cutting your phone bill in half has never been easier with Ting's brand new plans.

18:53.640 --> 18:55.880
The next generation of Ting mobile is here.

18:55.880 --> 19:04.040
Go see how much you could save, and then take 25 bucks off of that at linux.ting.com.

19:04.040 --> 19:09.400
On June 27th, Linus Torvalds released Linux 5.13.

19:09.400 --> 19:13.640
And as expected, the development cycle turned out to be a busy one.

19:13.640 --> 19:20.660
The AMD GPU driver alone is almost 2.4 million lines of code, but never fear, there were

19:20.660 --> 19:24.480
some things that also got cleaned up and removed, and there's still a lot of patches that are

19:24.480 --> 19:28.000
landing as a result of the University of Minnesota patch review.

19:28.000 --> 19:36.120
LWN reports that 5.13 was supported by a minimum of 232 different employers and a record-setting

19:36.120 --> 19:37.120
2,062 developers.

19:37.120 --> 19:43.080
Believe it or not, this is the first time more than 2,000 developers have participated

19:43.080 --> 19:45.080
in a single release cycle.

19:45.080 --> 19:49.440
And some notable features for 5.13 include support for Apple's M1 Silicon Macs, at least

19:49.440 --> 19:55.760
initial early support, the beginnings of support for wireless wide area networks, and improved

19:55.760 --> 20:00.240
support for the advanced configuration and power interface spec on laptops.

20:00.240 --> 20:03.320
Well, Microsoft's been busy with 5.13.

20:03.320 --> 20:07.920
Their Azure network adapter was merged, a tool which makes it easier to build hybrid

20:07.920 --> 20:13.480
networks, as well as more support for their line of Surface laptops, and some interesting

20:13.480 --> 20:18.360
early work to support Linux as an ARM64 Hyper-V guest.

20:18.360 --> 20:24.360
We've also seen plenty of enhancements to RISC-V support, and a change long in the making,

20:24.360 --> 20:28.720
the merging of the Landlock Linux security module.

20:28.720 --> 20:33.240
This is a big one, Wes, Landlock is a stackable Linux security module, and it aims to make

20:33.240 --> 20:39.880
it possible to create safe, secure sandboxes for unprivileged programs, in addition to

20:39.880 --> 20:44.600
the existing system-wide access controls, hence the stackable part of this.

20:44.600 --> 20:49.720
This kind of sandbox is expected to help mitigate the security impact of bugs or even malicious

20:49.720 --> 20:52.960
behaviors in userspace applications.

20:52.960 --> 20:59.640
Landlock is inspired by Seccomp BPF, but instead of filtering syscalls and their raw arguments,

20:59.640 --> 21:05.560
a Landlock rule can restrict the use of kernel objects directly, things like file hierarchies,

21:05.560 --> 21:10.480
making it simple to say, restrict the directories a program is allowed to access.

21:10.480 --> 21:15.280
If this sounds familiar to security models on other operating systems, well, that's

21:15.280 --> 21:17.440
because it is.

21:17.440 --> 21:22.520
Landlock was directly inspired by efforts like XNU Sandbox, FreeBSD's Capsicum, and

21:22.520 --> 21:24.440
OpenBSD's Pledge.

21:24.440 --> 21:28.240
Now you might be thinking, why not use some of the mechanisms that the kernel already

21:28.240 --> 21:29.240
provides?

21:29.240 --> 21:34.880
The Linux Security Module Subsystem, or LSM, offers mechanisms like SE Linux and SMAC,

21:34.880 --> 21:39.600
but those are really meant for administrators and not necessarily end-users.

21:39.600 --> 21:45.280
Not only can their configuration be complex, but the critical part here is that those policies

21:45.280 --> 21:48.540
require system-level privileges to modify.

21:48.540 --> 21:52.680
Often you have to be root, where Landlock is built for end-users with the goal of working

21:52.680 --> 21:54.800
for unprivileged accounts.

21:54.800 --> 22:01.480
Of course, with the release of kernel 5.13, the merge window for 5.14 is now open.

22:01.480 --> 22:06.760
Among the features slated for inclusion already are Raspberry Pi 400 support, updates to handle

22:06.760 --> 22:14.480
some recent or upcoming x86 CPUs from Intel and AMD, and support for more GPUs including

22:14.480 --> 22:17.160
Qualcomm's Adreno 660.

22:17.160 --> 22:21.560
Well it's not all perfect in 5.13 land, though just a quick note, there's also a bug that's

22:21.560 --> 22:24.480
biting people right now that you should know about.

22:24.480 --> 22:26.680
Dave Jones reported the following.

22:26.680 --> 22:31.800
This made it into 5.13 final and completely breaks NFSD for me.

22:31.800 --> 22:35.840
Existing mounts on clients hang, as do new mounts from new clients.

22:35.840 --> 22:39.160
Rebooting the server back to RC7, everything recovers.

22:39.160 --> 22:44.600
The good news is, a fix is already merged and it's an RC1 of Linux 5.14, and it was

22:44.600 --> 22:48.200
really caught before any distributions shipped this thing at scale anyways.

22:48.200 --> 22:49.200
What went wrong?

22:49.200 --> 22:53.880
Well, a previous commit optimizing bulk page allocations added a bug where the allocation

22:53.880 --> 22:57.400
would appear to fail if already allocated.

22:57.400 --> 23:01.560
Thankfully that meant the fix was just a simple one line change.

23:01.560 --> 23:04.940
Really just a bit of a PSA for everyone before we leave this week.

23:04.940 --> 23:09.920
We started this episode with the release of POP2104 and we are wrapping this week with

23:09.920 --> 23:12.840
the end of life for Ubuntu 2010.

23:12.840 --> 23:18.640
It's true, official support for Ubuntu 2010 ends on July 22nd, 2021.

23:18.640 --> 23:24.200
We wanted to let you know so you can make some plans if you need to.

23:24.200 --> 23:25.200
Yes, indeed.

23:25.200 --> 23:28.840
Perhaps a good chance to try something new and we hope you make plans to listen every

23:28.840 --> 23:29.840
single week.

23:29.840 --> 23:33.880

Jupiter Broadcasting.

23:44.380 --> 23:50.400
We'll be back next Monday with our weekly take on the latest Linux and open source news.

23:50.400 --> 24:16.280
Thanks for joining us and we will see you next week.
