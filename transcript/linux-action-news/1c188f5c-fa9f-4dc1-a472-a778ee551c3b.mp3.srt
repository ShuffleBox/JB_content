00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,380
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News Episode 145, recorded on February 16th, 2020.

2
00:00:09,380 --> 00:00:10,380
I'm Chris.

3
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:11,380
And I'm Joe.

4
00:00:11,380 --> 00:00:12,380
Hello, Joe.

5
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:13,620
Good to be connected with you.

6
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:16,540
We start this week with some really great releases.

7
00:00:16,540 --> 00:00:21,600
Number one on our list in no particular order, Plasma 5.18.

8
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:23,300
This is a new LTS release.

9
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:28,060
So if you'd been using the previous LTS, then there are quite a few changes.

10
00:00:28,060 --> 00:00:32,560
But those changes are much subtler if you've been on something like KDE neon, where you've

11
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:34,540
been tracking the development of it.

12
00:00:34,540 --> 00:00:36,120
And that's where you are, right?

13
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:37,120
Absolutely.

14
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:38,120
And it's been nice.

15
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:41,640
There's a couple of things I noticed, GTK apps look a lot nicer.

16
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:47,520
That's definitely a very noticeable and appreciated improvement for me.

17
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:51,100
And if you're a high DPI user, there's a couple of nice things in here, especially if you're

18
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:52,700
still on X.

19
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:59,660
The other thing that they've added is GPU sensor info in ksyscard, which is pretty nice

20
00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:00,820
if you've got an NVIDIA card.

21
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:02,300
I love just seeing that information.

22
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:04,660
Now it's just in the built in system monitor.

23
00:01:04,660 --> 00:01:09,220
And you've been hitting super period every day, presumably, to get your emojis.

24
00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:10,220
Yeah.

25
00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:12,260
I wondered if you were going to bring up the emoji thing.

26
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:16,260
I already had that bound to another key combination, actually, so I haven't really played with

27
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:17,260
that.

28
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:19,020
But I mean, you know me.

29
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:22,820
I like an anisaronic emoji, so I appreciate the selector, Joe.

30
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:25,300
You got to get your check marks from somewhere.

31
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:26,300
Check marks and flames.

32
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:27,300
I'm all about it.

33
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:29,900
It's my brand.

34
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:34,700
You can already try this out in KDE neon, but it's looking like it's going to be in

35
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:36,620
Kubuntu 20.04 as well then.

36
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:37,620
Yep.

37
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:41,540
And of course, it's probably hitting the rolling distributions right as we record this, if

38
00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:43,620
not soon after.

39
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:47,420
Also hitting a lot of different repos near you is a brand new version of MATE.

40
00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:49,500
Yeah, version 1.24.

41
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:54,900
And I've been checking this out in the Ubuntu MATE focal daily images, which will eventually

42
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:58,500
become 20.04, not too far in the future.

43
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:00,060
And I'm pretty impressed with this.

44
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:02,020
There's a few subtle changes.

45
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:07,620
And I think the biggest one in terms of usability for me personally, is the invisible resize

46
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:08,860
borders.

47
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:14,140
No longer do I have to out right click to resize windows or find that exact point on

48
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:15,180
the corner.

49
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:20,740
You just kind of go vaguely near the corner and you can just drag and resize it.

50
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:24,020
It's such a small thing, but it makes a huge difference to me.

51
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:29,180
Okay, it's funny you start with that because that was the biggest improvement for me as

52
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:30,180
well.

53
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:31,780
And it seems like a small thing except for it's not.

54
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:33,100
It's huge.

55
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:37,420
You get your dumb mouse in the area of the border of the app that you want to resize

56
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:40,220
and it changes to the right cursor error.

57
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:44,020
And you can just drag the dang thing like you would expect you should be able to.

58
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:50,260
You no longer have to be a precision fighter pilot to get that window border just right.

59
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:55,020
And it seems like a small thing, but it was truly one of the most frustrating things about

60
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:56,220
Mate for me.

61
00:02:56,220 --> 00:03:01,420
And that's one of many nice things that have come to the Marko window manager.

62
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:05,620
One of the other nice things is support for window decorations from the past, just if

63
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:06,940
you want to get your nostalgia on.

64
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:13,060
But more importantly, things that improve high DPI support and improved Wayland support.

65
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:19,180
In fact, improved Wayland support is littered throughout the release notes of Mate 124.

66
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:23,440
Wayland and high DPI continue to see steady improvements for this release.

67
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:27,840
But like you said, Joe, there's a couple of other just daily driver improvements that

68
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,580
landed in this one.

69
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:33,300
It seems like I used to have to tweak Mate to get it to this level of performance as

70
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:34,300
well.

71
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:37,740
I'd have to go in and I'd have to adjust the compositor settings and maybe I'd even install

72
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:38,740
Compiz.

73
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:44,740
I'd spend 15 minutes after install dialing it in with this just wouldn't change my appearance.

74
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:48,740
I went and looked in some of those old spots to see if I needed to adjust anything.

75
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:53,100
Everything was set the way I would use it and performance was fantastic on a ThinkPad.

76
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:57,600
Now I don't want to stir up controversy here, but support for E login D is pretty big because

77
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:02,680
this makes it easier for distros that don't use system D or even other operating systems

78
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:04,900
like the BSDs to use Mate.

79
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:06,700
I'm really glad to see this.

80
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:10,040
They are a little trepidatious about it in the change log.

81
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:16,100
They say in here, quote, if your system doesn't support system D, you might be interested

82
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:20,780
in knowing that we've added support for E login D to both Mate screensaver and Mate

83
00:04:20,780 --> 00:04:21,780
session.

84
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:25,640
First of all, this is great because kind of like you were just implying, it kind of makes

85
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:30,600
this a universal desktop for not just Linux.

86
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:36,340
But additionally, E login D strives to remain semi compatible with system D's login D. So

87
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:40,880
I would imagine it's not an extraneous amount of work to add support.

88
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:46,420
So it seems like a worthwhile investment while making Mate much more portable and appealing

89
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:50,620
to people that might want to avoid system D and with no statement about the project

90
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:54,340
other than that just seems like the appropriate place where you would find support for something

91
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:59,260
like distributions or Unix's that don't have system D. Mate feels like the appropriate

92
00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:03,060
type of project in terms of a desktop to support that kind of thing.

93
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:09,620
Yeah, that's kind of Mate's whole thing is a continuation of GNOME 2 and supporting things

94
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:14,300
that have traditionally worked before, like the whole desktop paradigm, but also looking

95
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:18,520
forward with Wayland support and high DPI.

96
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:20,780
And the development is very much ongoing.

97
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:23,940
So I agree, it's definitely the sort of thing they should be doing.

98
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:27,780
And the more users of Mate, the better as far as the project is concerned.

99
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:30,380
Well, let's keep this great release train going.

100
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:34,700
Skinshot has a really fantastic, huge, big release, Joe.

101
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:39,900
Version 2.5 and the huge standout here is experimental support for hardware encoding

102
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:41,580
and decoding.

103
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:42,660
Say it again.

104
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:47,380
Hardware encoding and decoding, experimental support for hardware acceleration is a fundamental

105
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:51,940
big feature in a video editor, full stop.

106
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:58,060
And what's fantastic about this support is it includes support for MP4 and H.264 files,

107
00:05:58,060 --> 00:06:02,020
which is a super common recording format on GoPro, cell phones, et cetera.

108
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:07,260
And if your graphics card is supported, OpenShot can decode the pixel data from the video and

109
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:12,220
on the flip side, encode the pixel data back into the video, all on the graphics card.

110
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:17,580
Jonathan Thomas, the developer writes, this can increase performance by up to 30 to 40

111
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:21,160
percent, depending on different factors.

112
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:25,980
And just in terms of performance, there's another area that has seen a massive boost.

113
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:30,500
He writes, we've completely rewritten the key frame system to deliver real time interpolated

114
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:34,060
values and no longer cache the entire value set.

115
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:38,460
This is huge because the longer the video files, the more key frames it has to calculate.

116
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:40,980
It exponentially improves performance.

117
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:47,500
He says the new system can generate almost one hundred thousand interpolated values before

118
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:51,860
the old system would even return a single value.

119
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:57,020
That is who that is, that translates to saved editing time, that translates to those editors

120
00:06:57,020 --> 00:06:58,660
getting more of their life back.

121
00:06:58,660 --> 00:07:00,420
That's a that's a huge deal.

122
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:06,240
There's also initial support for export and import of Premiere and Final Cut Pro files.

123
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:12,980
This new feature I will probably go into with expectations set to stun, but the potential

124
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:13,980
is there.

125
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:14,980
I mean, XML is XML.

126
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:15,980
You just got to learn how to parse and import it correctly.

127
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:19,880
And it seems at this point, basic timeline data like your files, your clips, some key

128
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:26,580
frame information, if you have multiple tracks, that is importable from Final Cut or Premiere.

129
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:31,300
And that's big because you could see a future where somebody could work on a project in

130
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:36,820
OpenShot, pass it off to another editor using a proprietary editing application and then

131
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:40,500
sending it back to someone where they could continue an OpenShot.

132
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:43,860
It would be amazing, Joe, if we could get there in a shorter time than it took us to

133
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:45,300
get there with Word docs.

134
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:49,220
Yeah, that's exactly what I was thinking about the Word documents.

135
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:53,340
I think it is very important to be able to work with people who aren't using open source

136
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:54,340
software.

137
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:59,100
Otherwise, it makes the open source software that you're using slightly less relevant.

138
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:03,540
It also means if you are a contractor doing a video job, you could deliver potentially

139
00:08:03,540 --> 00:08:07,100
the client in a file format they want for their own archive while using the tools that

140
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:08,760
you want to create the video.

141
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:11,340
It's really nice to see that feature landing in OpenShot.

142
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:15,300
I don't do a lot of video editing, but when I do, I tend to use OpenShot.

143
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:19,900
And this 2.5 release, which I tried out the app image of, looks really good to me.

144
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:23,300
I didn't spend a huge amount of time with it, but it seemed to be much more stable than

145
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:24,980
the previous version.

146
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:29,500
And it's kind of inspiring me to maybe do a little bit more video, but we'll see.

147
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:34,080
Well, Joe, we now reach the last stops of our release train this week with a new version

148
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,080
of Firefox.

149
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:36,900
Yeah, version 73.

150
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:42,440
And the big story here is that there's not much of a story because they moved to this

151
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:49,180
four-week release cycle, and so there aren't a huge number of new features here, except

152
00:08:49,180 --> 00:08:54,820
for one, and that is there is now a choice if you want to use DNS over HTTPS.

153
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:56,840
You don't have to use Cloudflare.

154
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:58,540
You could also use NextDNS.

155
00:08:58,540 --> 00:09:04,340
Yeah, it's nice to see a little user choice when it comes to DNS over HTTPS.

156
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:07,680
Along with this, we also saw a release of Firefox ESR.

157
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:10,240
So if you're on that track, you've got a new version.

158
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:15,140
And last but not least, a new release of the Tor browser, which is a general update.

159
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:19,700
It goes to the latest Firefox ESR, brings in like new versions of NoScript and the Tor

160
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:20,700
client itself.

161
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:25,060
So a worthwhile update and some performance improvements snuck in there as well.

162
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:28,460
Yeah, and of course, that means there's a new version of Tails as well, 4.3.

163
00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:30,140
Yeah, it's a release family.

164
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:31,740
It's the beauty of open source, Joe.

165
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:35,580
Well, with all the good news out of the way, let's tackle some bad news.

166
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:38,060
And I think we all saw this coming.

167
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:39,260
Essential is no more.

168
00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:41,300
Yeah, I guess we're not too surprised, Joe.

169
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:43,980
But this, if you don't remember, is Andy Rubin's phone company.

170
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:49,180
He was one of the original creators of Android, worked at Google for a while.

171
00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:55,420
Some things went down, he left, founded Essential and released one phone.

172
00:09:55,420 --> 00:10:00,380
Although looking through the details of the company now, it appears they had a few things

173
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:03,300
in the R&D lab, including their own smart speaker.

174
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:08,260
Well, that was always the promise that they were working on this smart speaker OS.

175
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:11,380
And they've got some video demos of it, and it looked to be pretty good.

176
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:15,780
I don't know how accurate they were in terms of real world usage.

177
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:18,140
Right, and they called it ambient OS.

178
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:19,140
Yeah, yeah.

179
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:23,780
The whole thing's a bit weird, how they put out this press release basically saying they

180
00:10:23,780 --> 00:10:27,980
were shutting down, but they also put in some promotional videos for what would have been.

181
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:30,180
Yeah, well, we were really onto something here.

182
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:31,980
It's a shame, is what the vibe is.

183
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:36,540
Yeah, I wonder if maybe they were pitch videos to try and get some more financing that didn't

184
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:41,100
work out or something, and they just thought, well, we may as well put them out there.

185
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:45,460
We went to the effort of them, because of this gem smartphone concept, which was this

186
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:50,840
tall, thin phone that looked like a remote control for your TV, and I was kind of keen

187
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:51,840
to watch reviews of it.

188
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:55,880
I don't think I would have ever bought one, but I was keen to see it come out because

189
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:58,900
it's something different at least.

190
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:03,980
And they had this assistant working on there, and it seemed like they had some good ideas,

191
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:10,620
but as you say, they delivered one phone and then nothing else, except for very timely

192
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:16,620
updates for that phone throughout its entire life until right now, the February update

193
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:17,620
went out.

194
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:21,060
And unfortunately, that'll be the last one, but I remember they were there on day one

195
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:28,180
for Android 10, along with the Pixel phones, so I didn't want to believe that they were

196
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:33,780
going to fold and go away, but we kind of all knew it deep down.

197
00:11:33,780 --> 00:11:38,660
I would have liked to have seen that gem concept ship, because a narrow phone that could fit

198
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:42,140
better in your hand is an appealing concept to me.

199
00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:46,080
But with all major shutdowns, if you can call this one major, I mean, I think it's somewhat

200
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:52,500
substantial, there is also some services that are going away, and this always really stings.

201
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:59,860
Current Newton Mail users will have access to their mail service until April 30th, and

202
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:01,700
then that is shutting down as well.

203
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:03,980
Man, that really stinks.

204
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:09,460
This is the aspect of these companies that they choose to take on the services role,

205
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:13,580
and then they blow it like this, and it's like, don't get into that business if you're

206
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:15,980
not prepared to be in it for the long term.

207
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:17,480
Don't take people's email.

208
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:18,480
Don't do that to people.

209
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:22,200
Yeah, and you have to feel for the staff as well, because Essential bought that email

210
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:27,140
company and now those people working on it are out of a job.

211
00:12:27,140 --> 00:12:28,140
Yeah.

212
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:29,420
I never did have an Essential phone.

213
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:32,500
I know iFixit tore it down and said, well, this is about as bad as an iPhone.

214
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:36,260
They gave it a one on the repairability scale, it was all glued together.

215
00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:40,100
But it looked like a pretty nice device.

216
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:44,780
But I think when it came down to buying luxury devices, Samsung and Google really have that

217
00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:47,420
lockdown and they have the channels too.

218
00:12:47,420 --> 00:12:48,420
Yeah, that's true.

219
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:52,160
But it is officially supported by LineageOS and they do say in this announcement that

220
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:56,420
they've published some stuff to GitHub, which will hopefully help with the hacking community.

221
00:12:56,420 --> 00:13:00,300
So it's not like it's just a completely useless paperweight.

222
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:04,200
You can flash lineage on there and keep getting updates, at least for now.

223
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,780
Good on them.

224
00:13:05,780 --> 00:13:07,480
That's how it should be.

225
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:13,340
That really does show you that they were tuned in in a way that most handset OEMs were not.

226
00:13:13,340 --> 00:13:15,220
Yeah, which is why this is a real shame.

227
00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:21,480
Well, you might be surprised to learn that the last time the NetBSD project had a fundraiser

228
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:23,900
was back in 2009.

229
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:24,900
Well until now.

230
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:28,540
Yeah, it goes to show how well they manage their finances that they haven't needed to

231
00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:32,660
do a major fundraising drive for over 10 years.

232
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:37,380
But now they're doing another one and they're looking to raise $50,000, which is not an

233
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:40,820
insignificant amount of money, but I think they'll look at that hopefully.

234
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:41,820
Yeah, they're right.

235
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:46,880
They will fund some critical parts of development that make NetBSD better and faster.

236
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:50,620
They're also pretty honest about some things that haven't worked in the last couple of

237
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:54,220
years and how they've identified that and have planned to fix that.

238
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:56,260
And I think the whole post is worth a read.

239
00:13:56,260 --> 00:14:03,460
But the big takeaway here is $50,000 to help make NetBSD 10 happen this year.

240
00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:08,100
That's sort of the like the end goal besides just getting people paid, fixing a few areas,

241
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:09,460
making things faster.

242
00:14:09,460 --> 00:14:15,980
The big goal is NetBSD 10 this year and make it the best NetBSD ever $50,000 in terms of

243
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:23,300
a software project is really pretty modest, especially one that is so critical to so many

244
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:28,420
people and on top of that has done so well at managing their finances over the last decade.

245
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:31,900
From what we can tell externally at least, it seems like a good investment.

246
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:35,820
Yeah, and there's nothing quite like a major release like NetBSD 9, which came out this

247
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:37,860
week to instill confidence.

248
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:40,300
