00:00.000 --> 00:08.720
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, episode 144, recorded on February 8th, 2020.

00:08.720 --> 00:09.720
I'm Chris.

00:09.720 --> 00:10.720
And I'm Joe.

00:10.720 --> 00:11.720
Hello, Joe.

00:11.720 --> 00:12.720
Good to be connected with you.

00:12.720 --> 00:16.880
So we start today with an update that we've eagerly been waiting for.

00:16.880 --> 00:20.960
This is the end of life announcement for CoreOS container Linux.

00:20.960 --> 00:25.600
And we finally got some documentation telling people how to migrate over to Fedora CoreOS.

00:25.600 --> 00:26.600
Right.

00:26.600 --> 00:31.840
As we've previously covered on the show, Fedora CoreOS is the official successor to CoreOS

00:31.840 --> 00:32.840
container Linux.

00:32.840 --> 00:37.840
Fedora CoreOS is a new Fedora edition that's built specifically for running containerized

00:37.840 --> 00:39.820
workloads at scale.

00:39.820 --> 00:46.380
There's certain features that CoreOS container Linux had, like automatic updates, etcd technology.

00:46.380 --> 00:52.040
They're combining that with some of the core technologies of Atomic Host, like the SELinux

00:52.040 --> 01:00.000
security model, the packaging system, OCI support, and creating a new distribution.

01:00.000 --> 01:02.640
It's not much of a direct migration, unfortunately.

01:02.640 --> 01:08.760
In fact, they write, beware that Fedora CoreOS cannot currently replace container Linux for

01:08.760 --> 01:15.200
all use cases, including it does not yet have native support for Azure, DigitalOcean, Vagrant,

01:15.200 --> 01:18.720
or many of the other platforms where container Linux was very popular.

01:18.720 --> 01:22.120
It's popular in DigitalOcean in particular.

01:22.120 --> 01:29.000
And Fedora CoreOS takes what they call a best effort at stability, but they may occasionally

01:29.000 --> 01:34.960
include regressions or breaking changes for some use cases or workloads.

01:34.960 --> 01:39.400
And that was not the case with CoreOS's version of container Linux.

01:39.400 --> 01:42.360
It was very much meant for production grade systems.

01:42.360 --> 01:45.160
So it's not a perfect solution here.

01:45.160 --> 01:50.340
There is a fork, obviously, of the previous CoreOS container Linux, but this is not great.

01:50.340 --> 01:52.640
And it's not a great look either, in my opinion.

01:52.640 --> 01:53.760
Yeah, I agree.

01:53.760 --> 01:54.860
It's not a great look.

01:54.860 --> 02:00.160
It's funny that they say you may want to consider flat car container Linux, which is the fork.

02:00.160 --> 02:04.760
But they also just casually drop in or, you know, Red Hat OpenShift, which includes RHEL

02:04.760 --> 02:07.600
CoreOS if you want to pay us a bunch of money.

02:07.600 --> 02:13.320
Yeah, I'm left to conclude there must not have been a lot of CoreOS container Linux

02:13.320 --> 02:14.320
users.

02:14.320 --> 02:18.960
In a sense, they'd be treading more lightly here if this was affecting millions of installs.

02:18.960 --> 02:23.800
This is likely, I would imagine, in the low tens of thousands potentially, maybe even

02:23.800 --> 02:24.800
less.

02:24.800 --> 02:26.080
It's a very aggressive timeline, though.

02:26.080 --> 02:32.360
Effective immediately, CoreOS container Linux is no longer available on the AWS marketplace.

02:32.360 --> 02:33.360
Think about that.

02:33.360 --> 02:38.800
In the past, if a Linux distro goes away, you can generally still find the ISO somewhere.

02:38.800 --> 02:41.960
But in the cloud world, they can just remove it from the marketplace.

02:41.960 --> 02:44.780
Let's say it's a much more dramatic death of a distribution.

02:44.780 --> 02:48.840
On May 26, final updates to CoreOS container Linux roll out.

02:48.840 --> 02:53.240
Any bugs, any vulnerabilities after that will not get fixed.

02:53.240 --> 02:55.040
And then some big dates land.

02:55.040 --> 03:00.480
On or after September 1, all of the published resources related to CoreOS container Linux

03:00.480 --> 03:06.040
will be made read-only, like GitHub, repos, things like that, issue trackers.

03:06.040 --> 03:07.040
And you're done.

03:07.040 --> 03:11.840
So you have September essentially as your very last day to run before you need to migrate

03:11.840 --> 03:12.840
to something else.

03:12.840 --> 03:13.840
It's fairly aggressive.

03:13.840 --> 03:14.840
Yeah.

03:14.840 --> 03:18.280
And you really ought to have migrated long before that.

03:18.280 --> 03:22.120
Imagine if you've built a load of scripts and everything that can interact with the

03:22.120 --> 03:27.640
API for AWS, and suddenly they're just worthless because there's no image available anymore.

03:27.640 --> 03:28.640
Yeah.

03:28.640 --> 03:29.640
Or entire workflows.

03:29.640 --> 03:34.200
I just look at this and I think, okay, we must be talking about a small set of thousands

03:34.200 --> 03:35.640
of users.

03:35.640 --> 03:39.360
And the team looked at it and said, we've only got so much resources to go around.

03:39.360 --> 03:43.520
We've got to build this new platform and get it as stable and viable for people that are

03:43.520 --> 03:45.480
migrating as possible.

03:45.480 --> 03:50.000
And the longer we maintain the old system, the less we can do that.

03:50.000 --> 03:55.280
They have less resources to go around if they're split between CoreOS container Linux and the

03:55.280 --> 03:56.840
new Fedora container Linux.

03:56.840 --> 03:59.460
There's just only so many people and so much man hours.

03:59.460 --> 04:03.600
And I can appreciate the tough spot, especially when you're talking not millions of users

04:03.600 --> 04:04.600
here.

04:04.600 --> 04:06.880
You're talking maybe 5,000, 10,000, maybe 15,000 users.

04:06.880 --> 04:07.880
Who knows, right?

04:07.880 --> 04:10.320
It's a small number, I'm assuming.

04:10.320 --> 04:12.920
And you don't want to do what looks bad, but at the same time, you've got to do what will

04:12.920 --> 04:14.680
make the future project successful.

04:14.680 --> 04:21.700
It was almost two years right around now as we record this, January 30th, 2018, the Red

04:21.700 --> 04:25.240
Hat announced it was acquiring CoreOS.

04:25.240 --> 04:29.760
And January 31st, 2018, everyone, including you and I, was asking, well, what are you

04:29.760 --> 04:35.300
going to do with the overlap between Atomic and CoreOS container Linux?

04:35.300 --> 04:39.160
And I guess I just hoped after two years, the answer would be a little more flushed

04:39.160 --> 04:40.160
out.

04:40.160 --> 04:43.240
Well, the only conclusion I can draw from this is that they must have had a small number

04:43.240 --> 04:44.240
of users.

04:44.240 --> 04:49.200
Otherwise, they would have cared more about this and put more resources into this and

04:49.200 --> 04:51.400
made the transition a little bit easier.

04:51.400 --> 04:56.180
Well, there's a small number of new users that can get their hands on Google's Enterprise

04:56.180 --> 04:58.120
Edition of Glass now.

04:58.120 --> 05:02.480
Yeah, this was a pretty low key post this week on the Google Developers blog, just casually

05:02.480 --> 05:07.720
saying that the Glass Enterprise Edition 2 is now available for any developer who wants

05:07.720 --> 05:10.400
it through one of our resellers.

05:10.400 --> 05:12.020
That's literally it.

05:12.020 --> 05:16.840
It's essentially technically like a four paragraph PR release.

05:16.840 --> 05:21.880
But when you dig in here, what they're saying is there's three new distributors that anybody

05:21.880 --> 05:27.640
that really is motivated can go to now to get their hands on Glass, which is the new

05:27.640 --> 05:32.420
refined edition that is more targeted at enterprise applications, which is how they really focus

05:32.420 --> 05:33.420
it.

05:33.420 --> 05:38.960
They write in here, Google Glass Enterprise Edition 2 has helped people working in logistics,

05:38.960 --> 05:43.920
manufacturing, field services, and a variety of other industries to do their job more effectively.

05:43.920 --> 05:47.600
And then they stress that it uses Android, and it's easy to work with.

05:47.600 --> 05:50.920
And then you can integrate with your existing services and APIs because Android.

05:50.920 --> 05:56.920
Yeah, and for this relatively low end hardware with no expensive screen and a smallish battery,

05:56.920 --> 06:00.680
you're going to be paying just over $1,000 bargain.

06:00.680 --> 06:04.560
I know it does seem like a lot of money, but then I was kind of contemplating if Apple

06:04.560 --> 06:10.160
or Samsung or somebody else were to get into this game, I could see their glasses being

06:10.160 --> 06:13.560
even more expensive for some augmented reality solution.

06:13.560 --> 06:17.040
There is an open source story to this update as well.

06:17.040 --> 06:22.040
It's again, kind of buried in this really low key blog post, but they have a batch of

06:22.040 --> 06:29.000
code samples that they've open sourced to write apps that make it essentially crazy

06:29.000 --> 06:32.720
easy for a business to go grab these, tweak them a little bit.

06:32.720 --> 06:37.020
And now they've got enterprise glasses apps.

06:37.020 --> 06:39.040
This whole world, it seems silly to me.

06:39.040 --> 06:44.960
However, if I had to look under the hood of an engine for something to fix, I'd totally

06:44.960 --> 06:46.000
like something like this.

06:46.000 --> 06:49.080
Even if it was an app on my phone, I'd love to be able to point it at my engine and have

06:49.080 --> 06:53.880
it tell me everything in there and describe everything and replacement item numbers.

06:53.880 --> 06:58.960
And I mean, if these things could get really smart where some average guy like me could

06:58.960 --> 07:04.760
pop a hood and get an idea of, you know, here's my transmission fluid cap.

07:04.760 --> 07:05.760
What's the right transmission fluid?

07:05.760 --> 07:10.240
And it just looks at that and says, okay, well you've got a golf 2018.

07:10.240 --> 07:13.160
It takes this kind of transmission fluid, boop, boop, boop, but you put it right here

07:13.160 --> 07:15.340
and it puts a little box around it for me.

07:15.340 --> 07:16.600
I'd love something like that.

07:16.600 --> 07:20.240
I don't know if I want glasses because I think the frequency in which I would use it would

07:20.240 --> 07:24.000
be so rare that something on my phone would do fine.

07:24.000 --> 07:26.800
I could see it for companies where you're doing that kind of stuff all day though.

07:26.800 --> 07:29.560
I had the exact same situation yesterday.

07:29.560 --> 07:34.360
I was in an unfamiliar car that I'd borrowed and I needed to put some petrol in it, gasoline

07:34.360 --> 07:35.480
as you would say.

07:35.480 --> 07:40.200
And so I get to the petrol station and I get out and I can't open the flap thing.

07:40.200 --> 07:41.920
And I'm like, what?

07:41.920 --> 07:45.520
It took me, I'm not joking, 10 minutes to think about it.

07:45.520 --> 07:48.780
Well, maybe five minutes and I had to Google how to do it.

07:48.780 --> 07:52.560
And then it turned out that there was this little flap thing that I had to pull.

07:52.560 --> 07:57.260
Whereas my one on my old car, you just literally pull it open.

07:57.260 --> 08:01.480
Whereas if I'd had some sort of augmented reality app that I could just either on glasses

08:01.480 --> 08:05.760
or on my phone, look around the car and then it would show me what all the buttons did

08:05.760 --> 08:08.420
or whatever, then it would have been much, much quicker.

08:08.420 --> 08:11.760
And you're right, for consumers, that doesn't make sense.

08:11.760 --> 08:15.940
An app on your phone makes way more sense than having a pair of glasses.

08:15.940 --> 08:20.340
So if you're doing that all day, every day as part of manufacturing and you need to have

08:20.340 --> 08:24.460
various data, it makes a lot of sense to have glasses.

08:24.460 --> 08:27.880
So I think that they're probably going to have to get the price down for it to really

08:27.880 --> 08:31.760
succeed in enterprise and compete with the others.

08:31.760 --> 08:34.380
But I can see this living on.

08:34.380 --> 08:40.040
It seems to be that Google project that you think is dead, but just keeps on trucking

08:40.040 --> 08:41.040
somehow.

08:41.040 --> 08:43.100
Yeah, there must be some use out there.

08:43.100 --> 08:49.660
And I think about this kind of the same way I think about home smart tubes in that I think

08:49.660 --> 08:54.760
people who are skeptical of the Echos and the Google Home products, well, I mean, besides

08:54.760 --> 08:57.980
their security implications, but people that just don't see the point at all, I can walk

08:57.980 --> 08:58.980
to the light switch.

08:58.980 --> 09:00.820
I don't need to talk to a tube.

09:00.820 --> 09:01.820
Those people?

09:01.820 --> 09:02.820
Like me.

09:02.820 --> 09:03.820
Yeah.

09:03.820 --> 09:09.940
What you don't realize until you use one is there is a lot of utility in having access

09:09.940 --> 09:14.740
to some form of computing while your hands are busy or you're full, you're there full,

09:14.740 --> 09:19.020
you're carrying something or you're inside working on something and you can just yell

09:19.020 --> 09:21.540
at something and have it do something.

09:21.540 --> 09:22.620
It's really useful.

09:22.620 --> 09:26.340
The hands free nature of it when you're coming through the front door and you can turn some

09:26.340 --> 09:30.280
lights on or turn a heater on or you can turn on a coffee pot or I don't know.

09:30.280 --> 09:34.300
In the case of manufacturing, it would be probably turn on or off a sensor or something

09:34.300 --> 09:38.980
like that and you could be working on it while you have this information in front of your

09:38.980 --> 09:42.900
face without ever having to actually touch the device.

09:42.900 --> 09:44.680
You can always keep your hands dirty.

09:44.680 --> 09:45.860
They can be covered in something.

09:45.860 --> 09:47.540
You can be working on something.

09:47.540 --> 09:51.420
We don't really appreciate how useful that is until you've used it a few times and you

09:51.420 --> 09:52.980
get that effect with the smart tubes.

09:52.980 --> 09:58.060
I think it'd be tenfold with something that was beaming visuals directly into your retina

09:58.060 --> 09:59.060
constantly.

09:59.060 --> 10:04.660
Do you remember in the 90s you had that Bluetooth guy, you know, the Bluetooth headset guy and

10:04.660 --> 10:10.180
that was just a complete joke and no one would seriously want to do that and you'd have to

10:10.180 --> 10:14.420
be that guy to do it and it was in comedy sketches and everything.

10:14.420 --> 10:19.260
And then fast forward to here we are in 2020 and AirPods are a fashion accessory and they're

10:19.260 --> 10:21.300
basically a Bluetooth headset.

10:21.300 --> 10:26.280
So could it be that eventually people get used to the idea of having some augmented

10:26.280 --> 10:29.660
reality glasses and it does become a consumer product?

10:29.660 --> 10:30.660
Yes.

10:30.660 --> 10:32.420
I see it already happening all the time.

10:32.420 --> 10:40.780
And several companies, more than several, are making AirPod competitors that have smart

10:40.780 --> 10:43.540
assistants built in.

10:43.540 --> 10:49.380
One of the things that the new AirPods Pro feature is the ability to do passive audio.

10:49.380 --> 10:53.660
So they use the microphones on the things and they EQ it slightly to cut out some of

10:53.660 --> 10:56.300
the lows I think.

10:56.300 --> 10:58.740
So they pass audio in but it's augmented audio.

10:58.740 --> 10:59.740
It's been EQ'd.

10:59.740 --> 11:04.800
It's not just flat audio coming into your ears and so it's a small form of enhanced

11:04.800 --> 11:09.200
audio and then you have, of course, the Siri assistant and you can squeeze them and it

11:09.200 --> 11:12.580
silences the whole world and you can have these things, you can be walking around and

11:12.580 --> 11:14.940
you don't hear the rest of the world.

11:14.940 --> 11:19.180
And to me it's both freaky.

11:19.180 --> 11:23.380
I just recently went kind of on a side rant somewhere else about this.

11:23.380 --> 11:27.860
It's freaky because these things are selling at such a rate that there's an obvious market

11:27.860 --> 11:33.480
demand for them but yet we have nothing from the free software community that really also

11:33.480 --> 11:35.460
provides that same functionality.

11:35.460 --> 11:39.620
When you also then connect all of these back to services like Google Glass will require,

11:39.620 --> 11:45.380
which is also proprietary, restrictive and often spying on its users and we have nothing

11:45.380 --> 11:49.780
in the free software community like these things, it really bothers me.

11:49.780 --> 11:54.940
And I think the Apple Watch, AirPods, Google Glass, Fitbits, they all kind of fall into

11:54.940 --> 11:59.460
this category where I'm looking around going, oh, I hope we have something that is actually

11:59.460 --> 12:01.300
really appealing to the market soon.

12:01.300 --> 12:05.940
Well, it'll probably take eyeglasses with an eye and glasses.

12:05.940 --> 12:09.060
See the hilarious pun there from Apple.

12:09.060 --> 12:13.060
I reckon that's what it'll take to make this popular and then maybe there'll be some sort

12:13.060 --> 12:14.220
of free software equivalent.

12:14.220 --> 12:17.300
That's why all of this makes me think about our Mycroft story this week.

12:17.300 --> 12:21.420
It's maybe more important than ever and they've been targeted by a patent troll.

12:21.420 --> 12:25.740
Yeah, Mycroft published a post on their blog this week about what they're calling their

12:25.740 --> 12:31.580
first patent troll and this is a company in Texas who wrote them a highly confidential

12:31.580 --> 12:36.780
letter offering to license the valuable patents to Mycroft.

12:36.780 --> 12:40.660
And their approach to this is they're not going to pay, they're going to take it all

12:40.660 --> 12:41.660
the way in court.

12:41.660 --> 12:45.860
Yeah, they say as a result, they developed a new internal policy that reads quite simply

12:45.860 --> 12:51.220
quote, we're going to litigate every single patent suit to the fullest extent possible,

12:51.220 --> 12:57.380
including appealing any adverse decisions all the way up to the Supreme Court, end quote.

12:57.380 --> 12:58.380
This is nice.

12:58.380 --> 13:01.500
I like seeing somebody get fired up and go to the mat about these things, but then I

13:01.500 --> 13:07.380
started reflecting on this and I thought the technology landscape is a patent minefield,

13:07.380 --> 13:13.020
but these AI assistants, these personal assistants, these assistants that tie in with ecosystems

13:13.020 --> 13:19.620
that do voice recognition, that speak back, that must be a patent land mine.

13:19.620 --> 13:24.420
Mycroft needs to fight this because as soon as they get any kind of large user adoption,

13:24.420 --> 13:27.440
I bet the trolls will come out in herds.

13:27.440 --> 13:32.500
I never know which way I would go if I was hit with this because on the one hand, you're

13:32.500 --> 13:33.500
right.

13:33.500 --> 13:34.500
They need to stand up.

13:34.500 --> 13:40.740
They need to say we're not going to take this, otherwise everyone else would pile on, but

13:40.740 --> 13:46.420
court cases and lawsuits, they cost an awful lot of money and they can ruin businesses.

13:46.420 --> 13:50.380
It is a precarious situation they're entering.

13:50.380 --> 13:54.700
I think that might be one of the reasons why it's important that we all share it and we

13:54.700 --> 13:58.740
spread the word and we make sure that they get some awareness for this.

13:58.740 --> 14:02.100
I could see a potential fundraiser in the future.

14:02.100 --> 14:04.020
I wouldn't be too surprised.

14:04.020 --> 14:07.940
I think it's pretty great to see Mycroft doing something like this, to be honest with you.

14:07.940 --> 14:09.820
So I hope they get the recognition they deserve.

14:09.820 --> 14:10.820
Yeah.

14:10.820 --> 14:13.300
Fingers crossed that they can come out of this in a positive position.

14:13.300 --> 14:16.660
I'm not massively hopeful for them, but I do wish them the best.

14:16.660 --> 14:18.480
That's why I thought it was worth mentioning.

14:18.480 --> 14:22.020
What might just be our most fascinating story this week, though, is a joint announcement

14:22.020 --> 14:26.580
from the Goodnew Project Leadership and the Free Software Foundation.

14:26.580 --> 14:31.020
This is a very short announcement, but it says that their mutual aim is to work together

14:31.020 --> 14:36.560
as peers while minimizing change in the practical aspects of this cooperation so that we can

14:36.560 --> 14:39.620
advance our common free software mission.

14:39.620 --> 14:44.760
That is a bit complicated to fully unpack, although I think I follow what it means.

14:44.760 --> 14:48.340
But the timing of all of this seems very suspect to me.

14:48.340 --> 14:52.620
And that's where the interesting thing comes in because certain individuals within the

14:52.620 --> 14:57.760
Goodnew Project are currently drafting a social contract for that project.

14:57.760 --> 15:00.140
And that social contract is in draft stage.

15:00.140 --> 15:02.440
It's got a little more time left in the oven.

15:02.440 --> 15:06.160
And then around the end of February, it's going to go into effect.

15:06.160 --> 15:11.980
And I note that they are urging folks to send in their opinions on this structure that they're

15:11.980 --> 15:16.660
announcing because they plan to finish the framework soon and want to be done by February

15:16.660 --> 15:17.660
13th.

15:17.660 --> 15:22.220
Yeah, I first became aware of this Goodnew social contract when Carlos O'Donnell proposed

15:22.220 --> 15:25.740
it on the Goodnew Misc Discuss mailing list.

15:25.740 --> 15:27.100
Yeah, same.

15:27.100 --> 15:31.240
Carlos is the team leader, Red Hat, for the Goodnew C library, which he's also responsible

15:31.240 --> 15:35.220
for all of the uses within the Red Hat enterprise line of products.

15:35.220 --> 15:40.500
He's also the official FSF steward and core developer of the Goodnew C library project.

15:40.500 --> 15:44.580
So an important figure within the project and at Red Hat, and he writes, I've been working

15:44.580 --> 15:49.460
with several other Goodnew maintainers and volunteers to draft a Goodnew social contract,

15:49.460 --> 15:54.340
which explains the key commitments we want from the Goodnew Project.

15:54.340 --> 15:59.820
The draft is being designed from the ground up by the Goodnew volunteers and for Goodnew

15:59.820 --> 16:01.340
Project volunteers.

16:01.340 --> 16:02.340
Is it official?

16:02.340 --> 16:04.100
It's official to me and I'll follow it.

16:04.100 --> 16:10.340
We have asked for feedback by February 9th to be incorporated in the update draft by

16:10.340 --> 16:11.900
February 10th.

16:11.900 --> 16:17.180
We've asked for endorsement by current Goodnew maintainers on or before February 24th.

16:17.180 --> 16:23.420
So you see how the timing is working out almost perfect with the announcement from Goodnew

16:23.420 --> 16:25.220
and the FSF.

16:25.220 --> 16:27.500
There's obviously some overlap here.

16:27.500 --> 16:34.620
As you'd expect, when a social contract is proposed, it's met with a lot of controversy.

16:34.620 --> 16:35.620
So I read it.

16:35.620 --> 16:37.660
I read the entire social contract.

16:37.660 --> 16:42.220
It's essentially one, two, three, four, five paragraphs, very short ones.

16:42.220 --> 16:46.940
It starts by outlining that they respect the four essential freedoms, which you've heard

16:46.940 --> 16:49.940
before if you've ever heard RMS list them out for you.

16:49.940 --> 16:53.700
It also lays out that the Goodnew Project adopts policies that encourage and enable

16:53.700 --> 16:55.740
developers to actively defend user freedom.

16:55.740 --> 17:01.140
In fact, the only part that seems to really have gotten everyone outraged is the part

17:01.140 --> 17:03.660
that says they just want to include everyone.

17:03.660 --> 17:07.500
They say regardless of gender, ethnicity, sexual orientation, level of experience, any

17:07.500 --> 17:12.900
other personal characteristics, but long time members and not everyone, but some of some

17:12.900 --> 17:18.280
examples in the show notes seem to believe that this is essentially a takeover.

17:18.280 --> 17:24.780
What's happening here is a coup to put in new leadership and quote, the feature of the

17:24.780 --> 17:30.180
Goodnew Project is that it has no social contract and quote, and that the belief is a lack of

17:30.180 --> 17:36.340
a social contract is what has made the project successful and made it truly open to all contributors.

17:36.340 --> 17:41.100
I think some within the project essentially see this as a power vacuum type crap, while

17:41.100 --> 17:47.820
others in the project see this as a way to tell the outside world, these are our core

17:47.820 --> 17:52.700
ideals and if they don't align with you, you're probably not a great contributor and if they

17:52.700 --> 17:56.360
do align with you, you're probably a great fit for our project.

17:56.360 --> 18:00.900
And I'll tell you something, when I read that social contract, it was probably the most

18:00.900 --> 18:05.380
direct clarification of the Goodnew Project and how they see themselves fitting in in

18:05.380 --> 18:09.180
the overall free software ecosystem that I've ever seen from them.

18:09.180 --> 18:13.440
That social contract, if you just read it as an introduction to the Goodnew Project

18:13.440 --> 18:14.440
is fantastic.

18:14.440 --> 18:17.700
In fact, it doesn't even read as any kind of contract.

18:17.700 --> 18:21.260
It's a great clarification of what the Goodnew Project is and they should put it on their

18:21.260 --> 18:26.540
front page, but it has been met with that resistance that does seem to be a split in

18:26.540 --> 18:27.540
the project.

18:27.540 --> 18:29.180
Not everyone's on board with this.

18:29.180 --> 18:34.980
I agree, but that seems to be potentially the core story behind this mutual cooperation

18:34.980 --> 18:38.580
update that's been announced with this really tight timeline.

18:38.580 --> 18:41.100
I get the feeling this isn't going to be the last we'll hear of this.

18:41.100 --> 18:44.380
I think over the next week or two, we're going to be hearing an awful lot more.

18:44.380 --> 18:48.940
Well, a couple of other things we're watching right now is some fundraisers in the community.

18:48.940 --> 18:53.060
Yeah, the first one's for the family of Mark Greaves, who was the lead developer of Peppermint

18:53.060 --> 18:54.060
OS.

18:54.060 --> 18:56.660
Yeah, we mentioned that recently on the show.

18:56.660 --> 19:01.500
Mark left behind two kids and a wife and I think there's something sort of poetic about

19:01.500 --> 19:06.140
maybe his passion project that took a little bit of time from the family could help make

19:06.140 --> 19:08.020
this transition easier for the family.

19:08.020 --> 19:11.300
So we'll have a link to the GoFundMe in the show notes.

19:11.300 --> 19:14.860
And on a happier note, we have some great news from the folks at Elementary OS.

19:14.860 --> 19:19.260
Yeah, they have an IndieGoGo campaign that they're calling App Center for Everyone.

19:19.260 --> 19:23.620
And I put this in kind of thinking that we'd help them out, but they're already at 81%

19:23.620 --> 19:24.620
of their goals.

19:24.620 --> 19:26.500
So I think they're doing okay.

19:26.500 --> 19:27.580
I'd love to see them smash it.

19:27.580 --> 19:29.780
To be honest, the project could use the funding.

19:29.780 --> 19:34.500
There's four things they're going for with this IndieGoGo campaign, which is really to

19:34.500 --> 19:37.940
get them all together in an in person one week sprint.

19:37.940 --> 19:41.180
Number one, they want to improve the privacy and security and stability of the App Center

19:41.180 --> 19:44.400
and the apps that get distributed, sandboxing, things like that.

19:44.400 --> 19:48.700
And I think out of this four here, streamlining the payment process is nice, but it's really

19:48.700 --> 19:53.080
number four, expanding the market for Apps Center apps by making them easily available

19:53.080 --> 19:58.340
on other Linux based operating systems, i.e. making the backend payment technology something

19:58.340 --> 20:03.660
that works with Flatpak and is available for developers across all distributions, making

20:03.660 --> 20:10.100
a simple, easy way that's part of a development process to charge for Linux apps that's worked

20:10.100 --> 20:12.980
really well on Elementary OS.

20:12.980 --> 20:15.540
That could have some potential and it seems to be drawing in the funding.

20:15.540 --> 20:20.820
I must say my first reaction to this was crowdfunding a company sprint.

20:20.820 --> 20:22.460
That's unusual.

20:22.460 --> 20:24.220
That's not how most people do it.

20:24.220 --> 20:29.500
But then I thought more about it and I thought, well, Elementary OS is a project and a company

20:29.500 --> 20:32.980
that does things differently in the desktop Linux space.

20:32.980 --> 20:38.060
They're never afraid to charge money for things and raise money and do things a little bit

20:38.060 --> 20:39.060
differently.

20:39.060 --> 20:40.100
So I think fair play to them, really.

20:40.100 --> 20:45.540
It's clearly very popular and they're almost at their goal with only a couple of days of

20:45.540 --> 20:47.260
social media promotion.

20:47.260 --> 20:53.580
So I can see this smashing way beyond the 10,000 and they said that they will invest

20:53.580 --> 20:58.140
that money in Elementary OS and App Center through contractors.

20:58.140 --> 21:00.420
I talked to Dan about it and I take his word at that.

21:00.420 --> 21:03.780
I'm going to have Dan and Cassidy on Tuesday's Linux Unplugged.

21:03.780 --> 21:07.420
I've got some questions for them to get a few clarifications.

21:07.420 --> 21:08.420
But I think people get it.

21:08.420 --> 21:13.620
I think they read their user base accurately on this.

21:13.620 --> 21:17.860
People understand that when you bring the lead developers of a project together in one

21:17.860 --> 21:21.340
room for a week, great things happen for the end users.

21:21.340 --> 21:23.660
It has really good knock on effects.

21:23.660 --> 21:27.140
And Elementary OS has already demonstrated that in the past.

21:27.140 --> 21:31.820
And so they've kind of shown a record of delivering on it when the users step up.

21:31.820 --> 21:32.980
And I do like this approach.

21:32.980 --> 21:36.740
I would like to see them make even more money at it because I think the project could use

21:36.740 --> 21:38.900
better funding still.

21:38.900 --> 21:40.700
But I am not even a primary user.

21:40.700 --> 21:43.140
I have family that uses Elementary OS and I backed it.

21:43.140 --> 21:46.140
I'll tell you, at the end of the day, I think it was the donuts and the picture with the

21:46.140 --> 21:47.700
mug that really got me.

21:47.700 --> 21:50.820
And that cool hoodie that they've got, that seems to be very popular.

21:50.820 --> 21:55.980
I might have to ask Dan for one of those privately when we next record User Error.

21:55.980 --> 21:57.420
That would be so unfair.

21:57.420 --> 22:01.660
I paid hard money for my mug.

22:01.660 --> 22:03.140
Do check out User Error.

22:03.140 --> 22:05.260
Episode 84 was fantastic.

22:05.260 --> 22:07.900
UserError.show slash 84.

22:07.900 --> 22:10.180
And then once you've listened to those, go back and listen to the last few.

22:10.180 --> 22:14.300
But you can just start with the latest one and then be sure to subscribe to us at linuxactionnews.com

22:14.300 --> 22:16.980
slash subscribe for all the ways to get new episodes.

22:16.980 --> 22:20.860
And you can go to linuxactionnews.com slash contact for ways to get in touch with us.

22:20.860 --> 22:25.020
We'll be back next Monday with our weekly take on the latest Linux and open source news.

22:25.020 --> 22:26.780
I'm at Chris LAS.

22:26.780 --> 22:28.540
I'm at Joel Rissington.

22:28.540 --> 22:30.960
Thanks for joining us and we'll see you next week.

22:30.960 --> 22:48.560
We'll be right there.
