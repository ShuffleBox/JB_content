Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, episode 158, recorded on October 11, 2020.

00:09.120 --> 00:10.120
I'm Chris.

00:10.120 --> 00:11.120
And I'm Joe.

00:11.120 --> 00:12.120
Hello, Joe.

00:12.120 --> 00:13.120
Good to be connected with you.

00:13.120 --> 00:17.680
We start this week with the project that's taking aim right at Slack, MS Teams, and all

00:17.680 --> 00:18.680
the others.

00:18.680 --> 00:20.920
It's Nextcloud with version 20.

00:20.920 --> 00:25.660
Is it taking aim at them or is it just integrating them, accepting that they exist and that people

00:25.660 --> 00:29.880
will use Nextcloud alongside them or now with them?

00:29.880 --> 00:31.560
Is all of the above an option?

00:31.560 --> 00:36.520
I think it really is a strategy of try to offer an alternative while also integrate.

00:36.520 --> 00:37.520
Embrace and extinguish.

00:37.520 --> 00:39.480
Oh, I think so.

00:39.480 --> 00:41.760
Only this time it's okay because it's from an open source project.

00:41.760 --> 00:47.520
I mean, one of the big features in Nextcloud 20 is that talk is introduced bridging to

00:47.520 --> 00:51.120
Teams, Slack, IRC, Matrix, and a dozen others.

00:51.120 --> 00:53.040
And it's actually a pretty cool setup the way they've done it.

00:53.040 --> 00:57.820
It looks like a pretty solid connection that remains persistent even when the users are

00:57.820 --> 00:59.200
not logged in.

00:59.200 --> 01:03.160
And in Nextcloud 20, they've introduced sort of a watchdog type service that monitors the

01:03.160 --> 01:05.840
bridge and will restart it if something goes wrong.

01:05.840 --> 01:10.080
And the idea is they're trying to create high availability corporate level communications

01:10.080 --> 01:13.420
that pull in the different sources into Nextcloud 20.

01:13.420 --> 01:17.280
And they've got this new dashboard, which is the kind of home screen.

01:17.280 --> 01:20.520
And you can have a bunch of widgets on there and you can edit them and have whatever you

01:20.520 --> 01:24.920
want and you can integrate Twitter and weather and all sorts of stuff on there.

01:24.920 --> 01:28.640
But I have to wonder, are they overcomplicating things?

01:28.640 --> 01:33.720
Yeah, I'm on the side of maybe it's too much, but I think the answer might be it depends

01:33.720 --> 01:35.040
on how you Nextcloud.

01:35.040 --> 01:40.360
I Nextcloud mostly for file sync, but I think there are a good portion in our community

01:40.360 --> 01:44.940
that use Nextcloud for calendar and contact management.

01:44.940 --> 01:48.880
And I know even some of our friends use it for project management, like Kanban style

01:48.880 --> 01:50.900
project management and whatnot.

01:50.900 --> 01:57.040
And so if I kind of had a wide range of uses for Nextcloud, I could see the use of having

01:57.040 --> 01:58.680
a heads up dashboard.

01:58.680 --> 02:03.160
For me, it feels like something I have to get rid of to get to what I want to use Nextcloud

02:03.160 --> 02:04.160
for.

02:04.160 --> 02:07.160
It's if you haven't seen the screenshots yet, and we do have a link at linuxactionnews.com

02:07.160 --> 02:08.160
slash 158.

02:08.160 --> 02:13.520
But if you look at the screenshot of it, you'll see a card style dashboard with big cloudy

02:13.520 --> 02:14.520
background.

02:14.520 --> 02:15.520
It says good evening.

02:15.520 --> 02:20.360
It has the weather, the time and then four columns that give you a heads up of your recent

02:20.360 --> 02:24.840
mentions, your upcoming events, your recommended files, all kinds of different things you can

02:24.840 --> 02:26.160
customize it.

02:26.160 --> 02:27.160
It's nice.

02:27.160 --> 02:29.740
It's a screen that in theory could get you right at some of this stuff.

02:29.740 --> 02:30.740
That's great.

02:30.740 --> 02:34.440
But for me, I just want to get to my team folder where I'm working on a project with

02:34.440 --> 02:36.480
everybody here on the team.

02:36.480 --> 02:37.920
And I just got to click right past it.

02:37.920 --> 02:42.040
I got a hot tip, though, Joe, you can just bookmark the URLs in your browser, like even

02:42.040 --> 02:44.960
several directories deep, and you can jump right to it.

02:44.960 --> 02:46.600
And you can bypass this dashboard.

02:46.600 --> 02:50.800
Yeah, well, I didn't even know about the dashboard until I read about it, because that's exactly

02:50.800 --> 02:51.800
what I've done.

02:51.800 --> 02:56.360
I've got a bookmark for the raw folder where we put the flags.

02:56.360 --> 02:59.000
And so I had to actively seek this dashboard out.

02:59.000 --> 03:01.040
Yeah, I would maybe use it to fight.

03:01.040 --> 03:05.260
So say I used all the things like I pulled in everything like my slack and my matrix

03:05.260 --> 03:07.760
messages in the next cloud.

03:07.760 --> 03:12.560
And then I wanted a really rad, dynamic start page that every time I open my browser, it

03:12.560 --> 03:13.560
just loaded.

03:13.560 --> 03:16.000
I mean, maybe I could maybe see the use for it.

03:16.000 --> 03:21.960
But at this point in time, I don't think it's not really a business priority to change our

03:21.960 --> 03:23.160
productivity workflow.

03:23.160 --> 03:26.600
It just isn't going to migrate in an xCloud at this point in time.

03:26.600 --> 03:29.580
I don't know, maybe people that are starting fresh today would use that.

03:29.580 --> 03:33.080
Maybe and it's interesting that in the post about this, they say that it'll be there for

03:33.080 --> 03:35.020
you when you start your day.

03:35.020 --> 03:41.560
They are trying to make this your homepage, almost like that you will bookmark that and

03:41.560 --> 03:43.080
set that as default.

03:43.080 --> 03:46.360
And it's the first thing you're going to look at, and you'll get all your notifications

03:46.360 --> 03:51.320
and everything in one place, which does kind of make sense for enterprise if you built

03:51.320 --> 03:53.240
everything around that.

03:53.240 --> 03:57.000
But if you haven't already, are you going to switch to it?

03:57.000 --> 04:01.360
That's what they're trying to convince people, and I don't think I am quite convinced.

04:01.360 --> 04:06.280
It reminds me of the Outlook today screen back from my old days at corporate offices

04:06.280 --> 04:11.040
where we'd have Outlook that you had this this main screen in some versions of Outlook

04:11.040 --> 04:14.480
that would have all of your tasks and your messages and your calendar and your contact

04:14.480 --> 04:15.560
information.

04:15.560 --> 04:18.980
This feels like a more modern version of this that just plays with more sources.

04:18.980 --> 04:22.760
But Nextcloud 20 itself, we've upgraded two servers here at Jupiter Broadcasting.

04:22.760 --> 04:27.480
We went pretty in depth in that process in a recent episode of Linux Unplugged.

04:27.480 --> 04:33.660
And in that episode, episode 374, we outlined what we think is a really rock solid enterprise

04:33.660 --> 04:37.080
grade bulletproof Nextcloud setup.

04:37.080 --> 04:42.120
And we took it through three different upgrade processes to bring it up to 20 and reflect

04:42.120 --> 04:46.760
on what we did right and what we had to tweak for our hosted Nextcloud setup, which is both

04:46.760 --> 04:49.600
on premises and on cloud.

04:49.600 --> 04:52.920
And if you're thinking about Nextcloud, you haven't pulled the trigger yet, check out

04:52.920 --> 04:56.960
Linux Unplugged, linuxunplugged.com slash 374.

04:56.960 --> 05:01.400
Because I've been using our current setup for a year, we all have as a team.

05:01.400 --> 05:02.400
And I'm really happy with it.

05:02.400 --> 05:04.880
We just had to make some changes to make it a little more cost efficient.

05:04.880 --> 05:07.160
And we update everyone in that episode.

05:07.160 --> 05:11.260
And what my takeaway was, is for a small team, at least it is production grade.

05:11.260 --> 05:12.520
It stood the test of time.

05:12.520 --> 05:16.920
It's performed pretty solid after we made initial adjustments and how we use it.

05:16.920 --> 05:21.360
And this was really our exit point where we considered a different sync solution.

05:21.360 --> 05:22.360
And we're sticking with it.

05:22.360 --> 05:26.880
Your setup there sounds an awful lot like hybrid cloud to me, something that IBM is

05:26.880 --> 05:27.880
going to bet the farm on.

05:27.880 --> 05:31.160
Yeah, at least what's going to be left of the farm.

05:31.160 --> 05:36.760
This week, IBM announced they're splitting into two companies by the end of 2021.

05:36.760 --> 05:41.180
And we have a yet unnamed new co that will handle most of the managed infrastructure

05:41.180 --> 05:48.060
services for IBM, like IT infrastructure, service delivery, operational efficiency consulting,

05:48.060 --> 05:54.400
what works out to be around $19 billion of IBM's current businesses is splitting off.

05:54.400 --> 05:59.840
And the $59 billion worth that's going to be left is hybrid cloud and AI.

05:59.840 --> 06:04.060
What that exactly means is not that clear to me.

06:04.060 --> 06:07.880
What's also kind of strange about this, Joe, when you look at it is what will end up happening

06:07.880 --> 06:13.320
is NewCo, for lack of a better name, will just end up having IBM as their largest client.

06:13.320 --> 06:17.640
Well, it's quite clear that there's going to be a continued business relationship between

06:17.640 --> 06:18.640
them.

06:18.640 --> 06:21.000
They're going to be working together quite a lot, even if it's not as part of the same

06:21.000 --> 06:22.680
official company.

06:22.680 --> 06:27.720
And if it isn't clear, Red Hat will remain with the IBM side of the split.

06:27.720 --> 06:30.160
They're basically key to the hybrid cloud strategy.

06:30.160 --> 06:31.840
What is IBM's cloud play here?

06:31.840 --> 06:33.160
Well, they don't really have one.

06:33.160 --> 06:36.480
I mean, claiming that they're going to make cloud services the future of their business.

06:36.480 --> 06:41.760
Well, the only real cloud presence I can see that they have, by any public measure, is

06:41.760 --> 06:43.980
the deployment of Red Hat Enterprise Linux itself.

06:43.980 --> 06:46.740
It's not like they have an AWS or Azure equivalent.

06:46.740 --> 06:49.940
They're not even like fifth or sixth tier, right?

06:49.940 --> 06:53.760
Oracle has more of a public cloud play here than IBM does.

06:53.760 --> 06:57.140
So where they take this in the future is going to be interesting, because if you look into

06:57.140 --> 07:02.040
IBM's financials, and you actually break it up, I don't really see a big cloud business.

07:02.040 --> 07:06.860
What I see is sales and consulting that gets lumped into cloud.

07:06.860 --> 07:08.700
So where the future is for them, I'm not sure.

07:08.700 --> 07:12.060
But it's obvious that Red Hat is going to be a key strategy.

07:12.060 --> 07:17.080
And now that IBM's splitting up, and that what remains is becoming a little leaner and

07:17.080 --> 07:21.360
meaner, it kind of means Red Hat all of a sudden just became a bigger fish in that pond.

07:21.360 --> 07:26.520
Well, it was Arvind Krishna, who's now the CEO of IBM, who was instrumental in the purchase

07:26.520 --> 07:27.700
of Red Hat.

07:27.700 --> 07:33.740
So it's not a huge surprise that he's really pushing Red Hat to the forefront of what they

07:33.740 --> 07:35.640
want to do as a business.

07:35.640 --> 07:40.320
And IBM, as a company, has been around for a long time, over 100 years.

07:40.320 --> 07:44.640
And they've had to pivot and adapt throughout the years.

07:44.640 --> 07:52.080
And this is the latest gamble, right, is to go all in on this Red Hat hybrid cloud focus.

07:52.080 --> 07:54.320
And it seems a reasonable bet to me.

07:54.320 --> 07:59.040
You know, hybrid cloud sounds like a buzzword, and the more I say it, the more of a buzzword

07:59.040 --> 08:00.040
it sounds like.

08:00.040 --> 08:04.800
But if you break it down, it's really talking about utilizing on-premises resource and the

08:04.800 --> 08:10.680
best of cloud resources, which is an extremely efficient and practical way to build an environment.

08:10.680 --> 08:18.320
And in the world of corporate IT and on-premises hardware and services, IBM still has a very

08:18.320 --> 08:20.040
strong brand.

08:20.040 --> 08:22.600
And I actually think that will come into play.

08:22.600 --> 08:28.240
If the theory is such that there is still 80% of the cloud market left, what we have

08:28.240 --> 08:33.560
seen so far has been the easy 20% to put in the cloud, and what remains is the 80% stuff

08:33.560 --> 08:38.120
that is hard, the on-premises stuff that's on-premises for a very good reason, if anyone

08:38.120 --> 08:42.960
is going to successfully hybridify that, if you'll allow the term, I actually think it

08:42.960 --> 08:44.880
could be IBM and Red Hat.

08:44.880 --> 08:49.160
They have good brands, they have good consulting arms, they have good sales arms, they know

08:49.160 --> 08:54.060
how to work that corporate game, which is absolutely key to this.

08:54.060 --> 08:58.360
There could be a lot of potential in Upshot here, but I think it hinges on the idea that

08:58.360 --> 09:00.980
the way we've always done things is going to remain.

09:00.980 --> 09:05.720
Because what the implicit acknowledgement of hybrid is, is that you're continuing an

09:05.720 --> 09:07.320
old way of doing things.

09:07.320 --> 09:10.840
You're running things on-premises on your own land, you have to have staff, there's

09:10.840 --> 09:16.200
a lot to manage, there's hardware, all of which I've just recently re-opted into doing.

09:16.200 --> 09:20.960
So I acknowledge there's absolute value to it, but when you're a lean, mean, cut, operational

09:20.960 --> 09:24.760
cost corporation, it is maybe not appealing.

09:24.760 --> 09:29.120
And maybe as new corporations start up or they reboot, they may look to go with all

09:29.120 --> 09:30.360
cloud options.

09:30.360 --> 09:33.900
As I've witnessed with some recent companies I've worked for, they don't even have on-premises

09:33.900 --> 09:36.520
file servers or domain servers.

09:36.520 --> 09:37.520
It's all cloud-based.

09:37.520 --> 09:42.920
Yes, but what you're forgetting is that hybrid cloud can mean just hedging your bets in the

09:42.920 --> 09:50.480
cloud using AWS and Azure or GCP and Azure or some combination of all three or a bunch

09:50.480 --> 09:52.680
more cloud providers.

09:52.680 --> 09:58.400
And that's where Red Hat comes into it with OpenShift and everything, allowing you to

09:58.400 --> 10:03.520
spread the load across different cloud providers so that you're not totally locked into one

10:03.520 --> 10:04.520
vendor.

10:04.520 --> 10:08.160
And part of that can be on-premises or it doesn't necessarily have to be.

10:08.160 --> 10:09.600
It can be a mix, right?

10:09.600 --> 10:12.360
And I think that's why in a lot of ways it just makes sense.

10:12.360 --> 10:17.080
And then there's a couple of other factors that I think will be this way for a very long

10:17.080 --> 10:18.360
time.

10:18.360 --> 10:24.440
On-premises is more private and storage, as far as I can see for a while, is always going

10:24.440 --> 10:28.880
to be cheaper when you can buy a lot of local disk versus renting storage from someone in

10:28.880 --> 10:29.880
the cloud.

10:29.880 --> 10:35.360
And I think if nothing else, there's a lot of driving use cases for just privacy.

10:35.360 --> 10:40.700
Ultimate achievable privacy and ultimate achievable low-cost storage is always going to be an

10:40.700 --> 10:45.600
on-premises winner, and that's just one of probably many use cases where on-premises

10:45.600 --> 10:47.840
is always going to be superior.

10:47.840 --> 10:49.800
And that's why I think it is actually a pretty clever play.

10:49.800 --> 10:54.100
If you were going to bet, I bet this is how a lot of things will end up for most businesses.

10:54.100 --> 10:55.240
This is how it's going to look.

10:55.240 --> 10:59.920
And that's what they're hedging on, but it's going to be the biggest pivot we've ever seen

10:59.920 --> 11:05.100
from this 100-plus-year-old company because what they're really known for is what they

11:05.100 --> 11:06.780
achieved in the 80s.

11:06.780 --> 11:11.760
And I witnessed it firsthand, and this was in the late, late 90s, I witnessed an IBM

11:11.760 --> 11:15.240
rep that showed up before anyone else had made it to the building.

11:15.240 --> 11:18.520
IBM had gotten a message that our mainframe had a disk failure.

11:18.520 --> 11:20.520
This was for a bank back in the day.

11:20.520 --> 11:21.520
And yes, it was a mainframe.

11:21.520 --> 11:23.160
It had a disk failure.

11:23.160 --> 11:28.400
And IBM was alerted, and they dispatched a service tech with a new disk in his briefcase

11:28.400 --> 11:30.940
before anyone had even arrived at the building.

11:30.940 --> 11:33.520
And I got there before the sun came up.

11:33.520 --> 11:38.780
And that's when I realized, oh, that's why they pay so much for IBM service because as

11:38.780 --> 11:42.220
a bank, they just needed that level of reliability.

11:42.220 --> 11:45.920
And at a certain point, technology becomes only so reliable, and then you have to have

11:45.920 --> 11:49.720
a human contract that takes care of those failure scenarios.

11:49.720 --> 11:51.960
And IBM built their name for that.

11:51.960 --> 11:53.840
You never got fired for choosing IBM.

11:53.840 --> 11:55.400
That used to be the mantra.

11:55.400 --> 11:59.680
If they can still cash in on that but pivot before it's too late, they could have a bright

11:59.680 --> 12:00.680
future.

12:00.680 --> 12:02.200
And that's what we're witnessing is them make that attempt.

12:02.200 --> 12:06.480
Yeah, and it seems that the culture of Red Hat fits in perfectly with that.

12:06.480 --> 12:10.280
Because if you're willing to pay Red Hat enough, you can get exactly that kind of white glove

12:10.280 --> 12:13.680
service from them.

12:13.680 --> 12:15.000
System 76.com.

12:15.000 --> 12:17.920
Let me reintroduce you to who System 76 is.

12:17.920 --> 12:20.760
If you haven't checked out a great friend of the Linux community in a while, it's worth

12:20.760 --> 12:21.880
giving them a visit.

12:21.880 --> 12:26.040
You might know that their Thaleo workstations are designed and built here in the US.

12:26.040 --> 12:28.880
Did you know that their laptops are also assembled in the US?

12:28.880 --> 12:33.400
And now with System 76 integration of the software, the two have never worked better

12:33.400 --> 12:34.400
together.

12:34.400 --> 12:36.520
It's becoming something really special with Pop!

12:36.520 --> 12:37.520
OS.

12:37.520 --> 12:38.520
I've switched to Pop!

12:38.520 --> 12:42.200
OS as my daily driver, and a big part of it was they nailed auto-tiling.

12:42.200 --> 12:46.480
It's built on modern technologies, it has intuitive keyboard navigations and shortcuts,

12:46.480 --> 12:50.360
and rumor has it it's worth learning that stuff because there may be a future where

12:50.360 --> 12:51.360
Pop!

12:51.360 --> 12:52.760
OS doesn't even require a mouse.

12:52.760 --> 12:57.360
You've got fractional scaling built in now, hybrid graphics mode supports external displays.

12:57.360 --> 12:59.280
I'm telling you, the current release of Pop!

12:59.280 --> 13:04.240
OS just keeps getting better, and I think there's a new version just around the corner.

13:04.240 --> 13:07.160
Go check out a friend of the Linux community, System76.com.

13:07.160 --> 13:14.000
Well, NVIDIA gave me a dark vision of the future, or maybe the present, at their virtual

13:14.000 --> 13:16.160
GPU technology conference.

13:16.160 --> 13:20.360
They announced a lot of AI-related stuff, and I'm scared.

13:20.360 --> 13:21.800
Yeah, Joe, get ready.

13:21.800 --> 13:25.640
It's going to be AI through the whole stack, they say, but the thing they announced that

13:25.640 --> 13:31.400
I'm probably the most interested in is the Jetson Nano, which is a 2GB developer kit.

13:31.400 --> 13:36.560
It's an SBC that runs NVIDIA code for $60 a pop, so it's pretty cheap in this realm

13:36.560 --> 13:39.460
for something that can run CUDA code.

13:39.460 --> 13:46.720
And it has 2GB of RAM, as the name would suggest, it has a Cortex-A57 CPU clocked at 1.43GHz,

13:46.720 --> 13:49.880
and a 128-core NVIDIA Maxwell GPU.

13:49.880 --> 13:55.600
They did already offer a $99 version of the Jetson Nano with 4GB of RAM, but at $59,

13:55.600 --> 14:02.320
that is a very low barrier to entry for people who want to get into CUDA and AI.

14:02.320 --> 14:06.280
The stuff they talked about, though, that sounds like a really interesting future is

14:06.280 --> 14:15.060
using AI to analyze a face and then stream, essentially, a digital render of that face

14:15.060 --> 14:17.480
at significantly less bandwidth.

14:17.480 --> 14:23.560
I find that kind of thing fascinating because it means, potentially, you would be a puppet

14:23.560 --> 14:25.320
master without having to do anything.

14:25.320 --> 14:28.060
Your face is just being tracked by the computer.

14:28.060 --> 14:32.940
And then an avatar that looks a lot like you, but maybe like an avatar with skin smoothing

14:32.940 --> 14:37.520
effect turned on, like a camera filter effect, it looks like that, basically.

14:37.520 --> 14:42.560
And the bandwidth savings is pretty significant, where something might take almost 100K a frame

14:42.560 --> 14:45.540
to do a video conversation.

14:45.540 --> 14:50.400
An AI version, that data, just the points of what to move in the other end of the software,

14:50.400 --> 14:52.200
that can be less than a kilobyte a frame.

14:52.200 --> 14:57.040
Yeah, and all they need to do is send one frame first as the key frame, as a reference

14:57.040 --> 15:02.160
point for your face, and then they just animate it with this data.

15:02.160 --> 15:03.560
That is just freaky to me.

15:03.560 --> 15:06.400
It's just, I don't like it one bit.

15:06.400 --> 15:11.040
I've also heard some discussion of some kind of machine learning or intelligence that's

15:11.040 --> 15:16.480
in the network card itself and dealing with packet loss and retransmits in an intelligent

15:16.480 --> 15:17.480
way.

15:17.480 --> 15:19.600
And then, of course, there's something on the other end that's also intelligent.

15:19.600 --> 15:23.080
Imagine that, the computer making decisions on how to better network.

15:23.080 --> 15:26.720
I don't know if it's possible, but these are the kind of conversations they're having.

15:26.720 --> 15:28.280
And this is the use cases.

15:28.280 --> 15:32.520
You build it in at the chip level at all levels is, of course, Nvidia is going to make that

15:32.520 --> 15:34.800
case because they sell the chip for that.

15:34.800 --> 15:39.160
I think the freakiest demo that they showed was the axis fixing.

15:39.160 --> 15:43.540
So if you're looking off to the side in your video call, it can automatically make it look

15:43.540 --> 15:47.040
as if you're looking right down the barrel of the camera.

15:47.040 --> 15:51.200
I just don't understand how that's even possible, and I don't like it, again.

15:51.200 --> 15:56.160
It's just too creepy and too much like a dystopian movie from the 80s.

15:56.160 --> 15:59.300
Apple was working on that for FaceTime, and then they axed it.

15:59.300 --> 16:03.360
But they had that as a beta feature at one point where it would correct your eye gaze.

16:03.360 --> 16:05.240
So that way, it didn't look like you're looking at the camera.

16:05.240 --> 16:07.600
Or that way, when you're looking at yourself, it looks like you're looking at the camera

16:07.600 --> 16:08.600
is actually the way to put it.

16:08.600 --> 16:12.880
Well, yeah, but it just seems too open to abuse to me with deep fakes and everything.

16:12.880 --> 16:15.740
And what's the future of this going to look like?

16:15.740 --> 16:20.740
Instead of just getting phishing emails or texts, you're potentially going to get something

16:20.740 --> 16:26.360
that looks like one of your relatives on a video call, and they'll deep fake the voice,

16:26.360 --> 16:28.800
and more easily deep fake the face now.

16:28.800 --> 16:30.700
I just don't like where this is going.

16:30.700 --> 16:34.680
It is a weird line where it becomes all of a sudden very artificial.

16:34.680 --> 16:37.680
When it's the gaze, that's one thing, you know, okay, now it looks like you're looking

16:37.680 --> 16:38.680
at the camera.

16:38.680 --> 16:40.000
Okay, so that's an improvement.

16:40.000 --> 16:44.720
But when it's essentially an entire 3D representation of your face, and what's on the other side

16:44.720 --> 16:50.800
is a rendered avatar modeled on your face, that's a different game.

16:50.800 --> 16:54.720
But you can imagine how much easier it is to transmit that kind of data.

16:54.720 --> 17:01.120
If we could switch to that kind of system, I mean, how else are you going to communicate

17:01.120 --> 17:02.460
with people in real time on Mars?

17:02.460 --> 17:03.460
We got to start somewhere.

17:03.460 --> 17:04.460
I mean, think about it.

17:04.460 --> 17:09.200
Like, it really opens up the possibilities if you can start transmitting 3D representations

17:09.200 --> 17:13.760
of people instead of their actual image, which has to be sent as close to 30 frames per second

17:13.760 --> 17:14.760
as possible.

17:14.760 --> 17:15.760
It's just super inefficient.

17:15.760 --> 17:19.440
I'm afraid not even this technology is going to make real time communication with Mars

17:19.440 --> 17:20.440
possible.

17:20.440 --> 17:24.680
It's just too far away, unless they can somehow make the data travel faster than light, which

17:24.680 --> 17:26.280
seems pretty unlikely to me.

17:26.280 --> 17:27.600
Oh, I've got the solution.

17:27.600 --> 17:31.360
I'm sure Nvidia will have a chip one day that does quantum bit flipping.

17:31.360 --> 17:36.440
So you'll have a chip, two identical chips, and they will instantly flip bits at the same

17:36.440 --> 17:37.440
time.

17:37.440 --> 17:38.440
And problem solved.

17:38.440 --> 17:39.440
Somebody just has to get working on it.

17:39.440 --> 17:40.440
Should be easy.

17:40.440 --> 17:42.600
Yeah, I'm sure we'll be talking about that this time next year.

17:42.600 --> 17:49.320
In an even near future, Firefox may soon display sponsored top sites on the new tab page.

17:49.320 --> 17:54.400
This came to light from a bug report, where essentially someone was asking for the ability

17:54.400 --> 17:56.300
to turn this off.

17:56.300 --> 18:03.040
So it may not come to pass, but I think it is reasonably likely that it will happen.

18:03.040 --> 18:07.760
Because Mozilla needs to make some revenue from Firefox, and this seems like a reasonable

18:07.760 --> 18:09.040
way to do it to me.

18:09.040 --> 18:13.440
Right, and unfortunately, because this is the result of bug spelunking, which is great

18:13.440 --> 18:18.040
and a totally reasonable way to get news from open source, it's something we do from time

18:18.040 --> 18:19.100
to time.

18:19.100 --> 18:21.020
It's not an announcement from Mozilla.

18:21.020 --> 18:23.520
And it's not with a rollout plan.

18:23.520 --> 18:25.240
All of that may be forthcoming yet.

18:25.240 --> 18:28.660
I mean, you could kind of guess they'll probably do some sort of staggered rollout in the United

18:28.660 --> 18:32.880
States, like they do with most of these kinds of new features.

18:32.880 --> 18:35.520
And it appears they'll likely have a way to turn this off.

18:35.520 --> 18:38.800
Yeah, but here's the idea is Mozilla's run trials.

18:38.800 --> 18:43.840
They have an idea of the views that this gets, the kind of earnings this gets.

18:43.840 --> 18:48.880
And it seems like the new tab page was built with this in mind, and then they kind of walked

18:48.880 --> 18:49.980
it back.

18:49.980 --> 18:56.240
And now this is kind of coming back to that original idea that I think inspired the creation

18:56.240 --> 18:58.360
of the new tab page that we have today.

18:58.360 --> 19:04.320
My question to you is, as a dedicated Firefox user, does this bother you at all?

19:04.320 --> 19:09.160
Well, no, because I disabled this when it first arrived and any new installation, I

19:09.160 --> 19:10.160
disabled it.

19:10.160 --> 19:14.680
I just want a blank tab or just go to Google or whatever for my homepage.

19:14.680 --> 19:15.680
Right.

19:15.680 --> 19:17.520
Blast that tab open as fast as possible.

19:17.520 --> 19:22.000
For those of you listening, this is the Firefox home content section where you can turn off

19:22.000 --> 19:25.520
individual aspects of that new tab page.

19:25.520 --> 19:27.240
This doesn't sit well with me, honestly.

19:27.240 --> 19:32.400
But the reason why this doesn't sit well with me is because I have come of the belief that

19:32.400 --> 19:37.080
if Mozilla had managed this better, they wouldn't be in this position.

19:37.080 --> 19:41.560
And they essentially ceded a winning position to Google, who has an obvious interest in

19:41.560 --> 19:45.180
the browser market, and they were ineffectual in combating it.

19:45.180 --> 19:47.920
And now they're in a pretty bad financial state.

19:47.920 --> 19:54.440
And as a result, they have to monetize the new tab page, which honestly is not going

19:54.440 --> 19:58.800
to reflect well when people compare these browsers now.

19:58.800 --> 20:04.020
So look at all of the free browsers on the market, and Firefox will be known as the one

20:04.020 --> 20:06.360
with built-in ads, I worry.

20:06.360 --> 20:10.000
And it seems like that could do more damage to their brand, especially since they try

20:10.000 --> 20:16.600
to have a pro-consumer, pro-privacy, non-tracking support brand.

20:16.600 --> 20:19.000
It's like kind of a conflict with that.

20:19.000 --> 20:23.080
So it's a really tricky spot for them, but I also understand and appreciate this position

20:23.080 --> 20:24.080
they're in.

20:24.080 --> 20:25.760
They need to make money somehow.

20:25.760 --> 20:27.580
What else can they do?

20:27.580 --> 20:32.600
They've tried with services, and that doesn't seem to be going brilliantly so far.

20:32.600 --> 20:38.140
And they still have the Google money coming in for now, but what else can they do apart

20:38.140 --> 20:40.080
from try stuff like this?

20:40.080 --> 20:44.920
I do take your point that it's not a great look for people's first experience of the

20:44.920 --> 20:49.880
browser, and it may make them think, well, I'm not using this, I'll just stick to Chrome,

20:49.880 --> 20:51.840
thank you very much, or Edge or whatever.

20:51.840 --> 20:57.540
But I just don't see a clear alternative path to revenue for them, unless they just become

20:57.540 --> 21:01.280
super niche and start charging people to use it.

21:01.280 --> 21:04.440
But that doesn't seem sustainable, because people don't want to pay for a browser.

21:04.440 --> 21:05.880
I completely agree.

21:05.880 --> 21:08.440
It's really an unfortunate position.

21:08.440 --> 21:13.320
It's really telling, Joe, that in 2020 and 2019, where we have seen so many independent

21:13.320 --> 21:18.500
development shops and other places switch over to subscription revenue versus one-time

21:18.500 --> 21:22.480
sale or advertisements, that Mozilla couldn't execute on that.

21:22.480 --> 21:27.700
And I don't really understand why, because it seems like they were in a unique position

21:27.700 --> 21:28.700
to do this.

21:28.700 --> 21:32.760
But now we're at the point we are at, and this is what's left.

21:32.760 --> 21:38.280
I think I trust Mozilla to manage the privacy aspect of these new tab ads.

21:38.280 --> 21:43.600
And if there was some appreciable way to support Mozilla by me opening a new tab, maybe that

21:43.600 --> 21:44.600
is worth it.

21:44.600 --> 21:48.680
Maybe I would leave it on, especially if this was big enough that one day they could stop

21:48.680 --> 21:52.120
soliciting Google for money.

21:52.120 --> 21:53.800
I guess that would be a small price to pay.

21:53.800 --> 21:57.760
I don't really ever foresee me clicking on anything they advertise in there, because

21:57.760 --> 22:00.760
quite simply, I'm opening a new tab to get something else done.

22:00.760 --> 22:04.240
And I'm not looking for an advertisement to click.

22:04.240 --> 22:09.480
But if my page view helped support Mozilla and kept Firefox alive, I think I would leave

22:09.480 --> 22:10.480
it on.

22:10.480 --> 22:11.800
I think I would do it.

22:11.800 --> 22:13.280
And so let me put that question to you.

22:13.280 --> 22:17.560
If you could somehow get some confirmation that having these ads in Firefox meant that

22:17.560 --> 22:22.080
it stayed around and they made revenue and your browser of choice survived, would you

22:22.080 --> 22:23.560
consider turning them back on?

22:23.560 --> 22:25.040
Yeah, I think I would.

22:25.040 --> 22:31.540
If I was confident that they were general ads and not targeted specifically at me based

22:31.540 --> 22:34.600
on data that had been mined, then yeah.

22:34.600 --> 22:40.560
If I knew that it was going to mean that Firefox would stay around and we wouldn't slip into

22:40.560 --> 22:47.120
a monoculture for browser engines, then yeah, I think I would do that.

22:47.120 --> 22:49.200
Linode.com slash LAN.

22:49.200 --> 22:52.720
Go there, get a $100 60-day credit on a new account.

22:52.720 --> 22:56.240
Linode provides virtual servers that make it easy and affordable to host anything in

22:56.240 --> 22:57.240
the cloud.

22:57.240 --> 22:59.640
Linode's dedicated to offering the best virtualized cloud computing.

22:59.640 --> 23:01.940

And every plan comes with their amazing human-powered support 24-7, 365.

23:07.000 --> 23:11.280
I use Linode for a game server I recently set up for my kids, but also it runs the backend

23:11.280 --> 23:13.360
infrastructure for Jupyter broadcasting.

23:13.360 --> 23:16.000

Check them out with plans starting as low as $5 a month and a $100 60-day credit on

23:24.720 --> 23:27.720
new accounts when you go to linode.com slash LAN.

23:27.720 --> 23:31.480
If you want to train, you want to support, you want to host, they've got something for

23:31.480 --> 23:32.480
you.

23:32.480 --> 23:36.020
With dedicated CPU, GPU, or even just $5 a month shared plans, you'll find something

23:36.020 --> 23:38.180
and that $100 will take you far.

23:38.180 --> 23:43.720
Go check out my hosting provider, linode.com slash LAN.

23:43.720 --> 23:48.000
Coinbase has been in the news recently when CEO Brian Armstrong announced it was going

23:48.000 --> 23:50.960
to be a quote, mission-focused company.

23:50.960 --> 23:55.600
He writes on their blog, in short, I want Coinbase to be laser-focused on achieving

23:55.600 --> 23:59.880
its mission because I believe that this is the way we can have the biggest impact on

23:59.880 --> 24:00.880
the world.

24:00.880 --> 24:05.520
We will do this by playing as a championship team, focused on building and being transparent

24:05.520 --> 24:08.720
about what our mission is and isn't.

24:08.720 --> 24:15.640
And 2020 has had no lack of things for companies to comment on from wildfires to the political

24:15.640 --> 24:18.880
events we're currently living through the middle of and a pandemic.

24:18.880 --> 24:22.800
And you've seen different companies kind of line up differently around this issue.

24:22.800 --> 24:28.500
And in a way here, Joe, I think you see Coinbase as a bit of an experiment saying, we're going

24:28.500 --> 24:32.920
to stick to the core mission and not really comment on things outside of that.

24:32.920 --> 24:38.920
Yeah, they're not going to have any sort of political agenda beyond pushing cryptocurrencies,

24:38.920 --> 24:43.080
which is somewhat political in and of itself, but they're not going to get involved in anything

24:43.080 --> 24:44.080
else political.

24:44.080 --> 24:47.460
They're going to be apolitical as an organization.

24:47.460 --> 24:54.340
And what Brian has said to his staff is, if you don't like that, then you can leave.

24:54.340 --> 25:00.200
And so last week when this came up, he gave his staff the option of a pretty generous

25:00.200 --> 25:06.100
redundancy package, essentially, if they wanted to leave, if they didn't agree with this apolitical

25:06.100 --> 25:07.580
direction.

25:07.580 --> 25:13.360
And a fair number of them did take that, around about 5% of the company.

25:13.360 --> 25:17.900
And the people who are left either agree with him or are too scared of looking for another

25:17.900 --> 25:20.880
job in the middle of a global pandemic.

25:20.880 --> 25:25.360
This is a tricky line to walk because as you touched on there, crypto, especially right

25:25.360 --> 25:31.800
now as it's gaining relevancy, is inherently political, and this is the crack that usually

25:31.800 --> 25:36.020
opens the door fully into companies experimenting on politics.

25:36.020 --> 25:41.360
And also I'll note, it's one thing for a couple hundred employee company to make this statement

25:41.360 --> 25:43.840
about what they're going to say or focus on.

25:43.840 --> 25:48.040
It's an entirely other thing for a trillion dollar company to make those statements, right?

25:48.040 --> 25:50.000
And so there's that too to deal with.

25:50.000 --> 25:52.460
They're a small business still, they're really a startup.

25:52.460 --> 25:57.080
But as a small business owner myself, I kind of see the logic in it because there's enough

25:57.080 --> 25:59.480
to do just focusing on the core job.

25:59.480 --> 26:05.560
And I refer back to our year plus coverage of Mozilla's decline, where they just recently

26:05.560 --> 26:10.640
announced an initiative that has nothing to do with Firefox and the web browser market.

26:10.640 --> 26:15.720
And they're investing significantly into that effort to the tunes of multiple millions.

26:15.720 --> 26:18.120
There's no direct return for Firefox.

26:18.120 --> 26:22.440
There's not even a direct return for improving the web or keeping things standard compliant.

26:22.440 --> 26:24.260
They've gotten that abstract now.

26:24.260 --> 26:28.560
And so I sort of see Mozilla on the other end of the spectrum for where Coinbase is,

26:28.560 --> 26:31.720
where they're heavily involved, so much so that they've deviated from their core mission.

26:31.720 --> 26:36.320
Well, that is arguable because the whole free software open source movement is somewhat

26:36.320 --> 26:37.820
political.

26:37.820 --> 26:43.480
And Mozilla has always tried to push for open standards and open web.

26:43.480 --> 26:46.440
And that is kind of political as well, right?

26:46.440 --> 26:51.160
That's the crack I'm talking about that opens the door just like crypto is just is inherently

26:51.160 --> 26:56.080
political and once you make that compromise, it goes from there.

26:56.080 --> 26:57.080
I think they're doomed.

26:57.080 --> 27:00.200
I mean, it's a good position today, Joe, but it's inevitable.

27:00.200 --> 27:03.240
Whereas the Coinbase CEO saying, no, we're not going to have any of that.

27:03.240 --> 27:07.240
We're going to just stay focused on the key business that we engage in and we're not going

27:07.240 --> 27:13.600
to be distracted and get bogged down in political issues because there's no denying it.

27:13.600 --> 27:16.160
We live in a very polarized world.

27:16.160 --> 27:20.400
And if you take a stance on something, the chances are you're going to alienate roughly

27:20.400 --> 27:24.760
half the people who you're trying to do business with.

27:24.760 --> 27:27.160
And I am guilty of this.

27:27.160 --> 27:30.720
My show, Late Night Night, we actually talked about this, about whether companies should

27:30.720 --> 27:31.720
do it.

27:31.720 --> 27:39.580
And we admitted that as just a podcast, have taken very political stances on certain issues.

27:39.580 --> 27:44.200
And that has probably been detrimental to the number of listeners that we've got.

27:44.200 --> 27:49.000
We must have turned a lot of people off who were on the other side of the fence.

27:49.000 --> 27:55.440
So I understand how and why companies get into this position, but you do look at Mozilla

27:55.440 --> 27:58.980
and think that they have gone way off piste.

27:58.980 --> 28:04.400
Whether or not you think what they're doing is good is irrelevant because what they're

28:04.400 --> 28:10.200
doing isn't relevant to the core product that they should be concentrating on, which is

28:10.200 --> 28:11.200
the browser.

28:11.200 --> 28:16.000
And I was going to put my analyst hat on here and look at this from a strategic standpoint.

28:16.000 --> 28:21.720
What Brian Armstrong has done here is he's thinned the herd a little bit without any

28:21.720 --> 28:24.120
kind of dramatic layoffs having to happen.

28:24.120 --> 28:29.160
He gave everybody a very generous package, but he's also sent a signal to quote unquote

28:29.160 --> 28:33.600
crypto investors saying, this is an island of stability.

28:33.600 --> 28:37.620
We're not going to let the craze of 2020 disrupt your money.

28:37.620 --> 28:42.880
And I think at the end of the day, Armstrong is attempting to position Coinbase as a bank.

28:42.880 --> 28:45.160
They want us to think of it as a bank.

28:45.160 --> 28:49.160
And there's certain above the fray aspects of a bank.

28:49.160 --> 28:50.160
You know what I mean?

28:50.160 --> 28:52.680
Like they're kind of above the political fray in a sense.

28:52.680 --> 28:56.980
And I think Coinbase wants to build a culture of that to essentially skate to where the

28:56.980 --> 28:57.980
puck's going.

28:57.980 --> 29:01.960
It's a very strategic, it's a very strategic thing, but it additionally, it's letting people

29:01.960 --> 29:06.680
who are maybe aren't as jazzed and motivated about the core, core aspect of the company

29:06.680 --> 29:10.240
and instead are maybe more motivated about other aspirational things.

29:10.240 --> 29:13.100
They can move on to a job that's a better fit for them.

29:13.100 --> 29:15.280
And I think it's kind of a win-win in that way.

29:15.280 --> 29:19.480
Well that might be true, but the likes of Jack Dorsey, the Twitter CEO, don't agree

29:19.480 --> 29:20.680
with that.

29:20.680 --> 29:27.600
He and some others have criticized Armstrong for this position quite strongly in fact.

29:27.600 --> 29:31.800
Well it is kind of an anti-mainstream line of thinking, but I think when you look at

29:31.800 --> 29:36.440
it in the lens of a bank operation versus a social media publishing platform, it's pretty

29:36.440 --> 29:39.640
clear why the two companies would take different stances.

29:39.640 --> 29:44.000
But Dorsey's coming at it from a communications platform standpoint.

29:44.000 --> 29:45.000
Think about that.

29:45.000 --> 29:47.100
A communications platform.

29:47.100 --> 29:53.200
And Armstrong's coming at it from a bank savings investing side, right?

29:53.200 --> 29:55.840
These are two very different outlooks on these businesses.

29:55.840 --> 29:57.440
These are two very different philosophies.

29:57.440 --> 29:58.600
Yeah, that's true.

29:58.600 --> 30:03.960
There is a bank in the UK called the Co-operative Bank, which does get somewhat political and

30:03.960 --> 30:06.420
say that they only invest in ethical stuff.

30:06.420 --> 30:11.000
But then when you dig into it, they say stuff like, we won't provide banking services to

30:11.000 --> 30:17.320
any business organization or government that manufactures indiscriminate weapons, e.g.

30:17.320 --> 30:19.180
cluster bombs and stuff.

30:19.180 --> 30:23.860
But they don't mention anything about companies that manufacture a regular weapon.

30:23.860 --> 30:25.600
So weapons are okay, just not mines.

30:25.600 --> 30:29.840
Yeah, like cluster bombs, mines, uranium, you know, stuff like that.

30:29.840 --> 30:30.840
No, the bad stuff.

30:30.840 --> 30:31.840
Just the good weapons.

30:31.840 --> 30:32.840
Yeah.

30:32.840 --> 30:36.680
So there are some examples of banks, but yeah, I know what you mean, generally speaking,

30:36.680 --> 30:42.200
banks are pretty apolitical, so it does seem like a reasonable direction for Coinbase to

30:42.200 --> 30:43.200
go in.

30:43.200 --> 30:46.820
Yeah, it just shows you the state of 2020, though, because even making that statement

30:46.820 --> 30:47.980
is controversial.

30:47.980 --> 30:52.380
Saying that you're going to just take an even-keeled focused approach is a controversial thing

30:52.380 --> 30:53.380
to say.

30:53.380 --> 30:54.380
Yeah.

30:54.380 --> 30:58.140
And thinking about Mozilla, I don't think they could do anything like this.

30:58.140 --> 31:00.240
They just wouldn't get away with it, would they?

31:00.240 --> 31:01.980
They have to be political now.

31:01.980 --> 31:07.920
They've set their stall out that they are political in various ways, and you either

31:07.920 --> 31:08.920
like it or you don't.

31:08.920 --> 31:12.640
Well, like I always say, and you guys know it, we'll keep an eye on this and everything

31:12.640 --> 31:14.580
