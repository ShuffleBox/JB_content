00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,480
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, episode 150, recorded on March 21st, 2020.

2
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:09,480
I'm Chris.

3
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:10,480
And I'm Joe.

4
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:11,480
Hello, Joe.

5
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:12,680
Good to be connected with you.

6
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:16,480
What do you say we start out with the big news from NPM this week?

7
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:22,720
Yes, NPM has been acquired by GitHub, or is that Microsoft?

8
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:25,800
I think it's the more palatable way to say Microsoft.

9
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:32,760
Well, in the press releases from NPM and from GitHub, they did not mention Microsoft once,

10
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:35,000
which is quite telling.

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,520
And it seems that it is going to be under the management of GitHub, obviously with Microsoft

12
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:42,880
overseeing things and ultimately financing it.

13
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:47,280
But I think that Microsoft are going to be hands off.

14
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:50,920
They've been relatively hands off with GitHub, haven't they so far?

15
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:54,400
Or at least hands on in a way that people like.

16
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:57,400
And maybe this is ultimately a good thing for NPM.

17
00:00:57,400 --> 00:01:01,040
I think that's the very goodwill they're cashing in on with this announcement.

18
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:03,520
And I think it's clear it will be managed by GitHub.

19
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:09,320
NPM makes more sense as a product of GitHub than it does of any other component of Microsoft's

20
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:10,560
offerings.

21
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:14,300
It's still probably a pretty big shock, though, to millions of developers who use that public

22
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:16,120
registry every day.

23
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:21,480
Now Nat Friedman on the GitHub blog post does say that they will keep the registry free

24
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:22,480
forever.

25
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:26,240
They've developed an infrastructure for that, that they will improve the core experience.

26
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:29,840
And he gives a couple of examples of that, specifically improving on the CLI tools, which

27
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:31,240
I think is awesome.

28
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:34,880
And they intend to engage more with the larger JavaScript community.

29
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:39,200
One thing that stuck out to me in some of the messaging, and it's here in Nat Friedman's

30
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:45,880
announcement, is this language around improving the security of, quote, the open source software

31
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:47,840
supply chain.

32
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:51,440
I think that's an interesting way to look at NPM.

33
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:55,760
But we have definitely talked about some of the security issues these software registries

34
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:58,080
have experienced in the past.

35
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:01,960
And I would credit Microsoft with managing their infrastructure pretty well so far.

36
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:07,160
Well, that's another reason why this may well be good news for NPM ultimately, is that apart

37
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:10,280
from the finances, it's the management of this.

38
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:17,000
It's the fact that we hopefully won't see these security issues, developers just pulling

39
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:22,160
their project out and messing up all the projects that depend on that.

40
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:25,160
Hopefully GitHub will be able to manage all that properly.

41
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:29,600
And so we'll see a kind of more professional NPM as a result of this.

42
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:33,480
Maybe they'd have to come up with some solutions for basic human nature.

43
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:37,680
Perhaps monetizations for projects that are struggling could help with that.

44
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,680
I'm skeptical.

45
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:44,400
Let's put NPM's footprint into context for a moment.

46
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:52,120
NPM serves over 1.3 million packages to roughly 12 million developers who download these things

47
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:55,520
75 billion times a month.

48
00:02:55,520 --> 00:03:02,280
And if the trends continue in a few years, those numbers will seem tiny.

49
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:08,960
If the trajectory continues, I bring all that up to just kind of turn this around and say,

50
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:14,760
is it maybe not even just important, but is it maybe critical that something like NPM

51
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:18,840
remains independent in an open source free software ecosystem?

52
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:24,800
There's obviously, like we just mentioned, benefits to the pockets of Microsoft, especially

53
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:28,680
under the leadership of Nat Friedman, who seems to be doing a fantastic job.

54
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:31,740
Obvious benefits, but I just thought, let's play devil's advocate.

55
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:36,560
This seems like a pretty big, important piece of our open source software ecosystem.

56
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:41,440
If you'll take a term from their announcement, shouldn't it be independent?

57
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:45,200
Shouldn't it be something that is not owned by a single commercial entity?

58
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:50,080
Well, it was owned by a single commercial entity before, NPM Inc.

59
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:56,720
But they're a small independent company that when you read their side of the announcement,

60
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:59,840
sounds like things weren't always great, that they've had some struggles and that maybe

61
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:02,200
this needed to happen for them.

62
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:09,120
But I guess maybe let's fantasize in a world where a foundation of sorts steps in and it

63
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:15,600
becomes something that is maybe managed in that sense instead of managed by a holding

64
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:20,240
company, which then manages another company, which there's a lot of conflicting interests

65
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:21,240
there.

66
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:22,640
I do get where you're coming from here.

67
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:26,200
And maybe the foundation route could have been something they did.

68
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:30,940
But if you're going to try and compete in the commercial world, then consolidation is

69
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:32,800
just inevitable, isn't it?

70
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:38,200
The only way to survive is just by becoming part of a bigger and bigger entity.

71
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:41,120
And that entity, in this case, is Microsoft.

72
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:46,060
I think the reality of the market right now, especially here in the States, but really

73
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:53,000
around the world, is there are four significant, five-ish significant tech companies.

74
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:58,320
And if you want to get to millions and billions, you got to go through their gates.

75
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:01,680
And that, in a way, gets products into the hands of users that never would have had access

76
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,040
to that technology.

77
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:06,640
But it also limits the way it gate keeps, essentially, the way you can get to market.

78
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:10,200
But aside from that, I think the reality of the numbers here suggests that you would need

79
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:15,000
infrastructure experts running NPM within a year or two.

80
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,900
Not that they're not already, clearly.

81
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:20,880
But you need somebody who can really operate at scale.

82
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:23,100
And that's one of the big tech companies.

83
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:27,320
And Microsoft is clearly one of the ideal candidates if you're going to pick from the

84
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:28,320
top five.

85
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,000
I'm very glad this wasn't Facebook.

86
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,600
I'm pretty glad this wasn't Google or Apple, too.

87
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:36,640
And it's yet more evidence of Microsoft's shift towards open source.

88
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:37,640
Right.

89
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:41,280
And this fits in line with what we've kind of been saying recently with WSL, the new

90
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:44,840
terminal and GitHub's acquisition in general.

91
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:49,080
It seems Microsoft has realized during a gold rush, the way you're going to make money at

92
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:54,200
this point is by selling the axes and the pixes and the shovels and whatever, the tools,

93
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:55,200
to the gold miners.

94
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:59,320
And in this analogy, open source development is the gold mine.

95
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:00,320
Yeah.

96
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:02,600
And all that shiny new open source code is the gold.

97
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:03,600
Exactly.

98
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:08,040
And Microsoft's more than happy to help you get that gold because their tools and services,

99
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:12,280
a lot of them have a monthly price attached to them.

100
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:15,000
And now NPM is another set of those tools.

101
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:20,040
But more importantly, I think it will signal to the market that this is a safe bet.

102
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:23,600
It's in the hands of GitHub now and Microsoft.

103
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,800
You can depend on this.

104
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:28,480
Some in our community will have the exact opposite reaction.

105
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:31,200
To them, it's now going to be something that's suspicious.

106
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:36,800
It's something that probably needs a free replacement, something alternative to.

107
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:42,360
But to a larger segment of the market, and especially to the business types, this will

108
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:45,200
be a signal of stability and safety for NPM.

109
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:46,200
Yeah.

110
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:50,200
And exactly where that split is and how many people are on each side of it, we'll be telling.

111
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:54,000
I suspect there'll be far more people on the business side of things.

112
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,720
I'd like to know how much they paid.

113
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:59,200
NPM and GitHub are not sharing that detail right now.

114
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:06,760
I'm curious, how much does a world famous software repository go for?

115
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:07,760
How much is this all worth?

116
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:11,480
I'd really like to know, but nays the word on that one so far.

117
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:14,100
Well, it wasn't the only GitHub news this week.

118
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:17,540
The iOS and Android apps are now out of beta.

119
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:19,680
Had the NPM acquisition not happened.

120
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:25,520
This may have been a bigger story because neither one of these apps for Android or iOS

121
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:26,920
are open source.

122
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:31,420
And interestingly, GitHub wrote the apps separately for each platform.

123
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:35,480
They used Swift for iOS and Kotlin for Android.

124
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:36,480
I find that interesting.

125
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:41,240
They went for a native look for each one of them with a couple of shared components and

126
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:42,520
toolbar stuff in there.

127
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:46,040
And it has some essential basic functionality that you would come to expect.

128
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,040
It doesn't have everything.

129
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:50,280
That's one of the main complaints on Twitter right now is people grousing about what it

130
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:51,400
doesn't do.

131
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:54,440
But it lets you organize tasks very simply in a mobile UI.

132
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:58,120
It gives you the ability to respond to feedback and issues.

133
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:01,880
And obviously the big feature allows you to review and merge pull requests.

134
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:05,080
Yeah, you're right that there's been some negative feedback about the stuff that it

135
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:06,080
can't do.

136
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:09,680
But I've also seen some very positive feedback about stuff that it can do.

137
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:13,000
I've seen some devs tweeting about how they can get some of these tasks done while they're

138
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,040
waiting in line for groceries or whatever.

139
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:18,360
So I think mixed reaction is the fairest way to describe it.

140
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:19,360
Yeah.

141
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:21,040
And the thing to remember is these apps aren't done.

142
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:27,220
In fact, I believe it was implied by Ryan Nystrom that the apps may go open source.

143
00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:31,360
He was asked and he said, well, they're not open source now, but maybe in the future.

144
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:35,640
And you could see possibly as they add new features and whatnot that perhaps one day

145
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:40,160
they'll also have a big announcement, GitHub's mobile apps are now open source.

146
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:41,160
One can dream, Joe.

147
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:42,160
Yeah, we can.

148
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:45,680
It's funny that he tweeted, it's not right now regarding the code being open source.

149
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:48,600
And that was from Twitter for iPhone.

150
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:53,120
Hey, that Twitter app launches real fast on iOS, Joe.

151
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:54,560
So I hear.

152
00:08:54,560 --> 00:09:00,440
Well, something that has taken a while to launch is Linux Mint Debian Edition 4, Debian,

153
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:01,760
which has been released this week.

154
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:08,160
Yeah, I think it's been a few years, but it's here, LMDE 4, Debian Edition.

155
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:15,000
And this is their hedge on Ubuntu going away one day, keeping the project sustainable with

156
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,760
a different base.

157
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:23,840
But over the years, it's kind of turned into a semi unofficial slash official way to have

158
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:26,660
a slow release rolling Mint desktop.

159
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:28,480
But it has seen a bit of neglect over the years.

160
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:33,920
They'll kind of release it and then certain packages get updated and it gets a bit kind

161
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:38,700
of left behind while they concentrate on the main Linux Mint Edition.

162
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:43,960
So I'm really hoping that with LMDE 4, they can give it a bit more time and resources

163
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:48,960
now because I installed this yesterday and I was actually really impressed by it.

164
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:50,580
Recent versions of Cinnamon are pretty good.

165
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:54,520
And that's the primary experience you get with Linux Mint Debian Edition.

166
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:56,440
I like it.

167
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:58,400
For me, it's not quite the right fit.

168
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:05,880
So it's based on Debian 10 Buster and it has kernel 4.19, which feels like it's from a

169
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:08,320
hundred years ago at this point.

170
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:13,960
So there's things I like about it in that the concept of a semi rolling release, because

171
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:19,400
sometimes upgrades are challenging with Mint, that's based on Debian, which is a great foundation

172
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:25,980
with Cinnamon, which is turning into a top grade desktop environment that needs upgrades

173
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:27,480
every three to four years.

174
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:29,680
That kind of sounds almost like your perfect kind of thing.

175
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:33,200
It seems like it's right in your alley, but for me, it's just a little too old.

176
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,200
Well, yeah.

177
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:38,720
And also the fact that Cinnamon is very Windows-like, I can see why you don't like it because you

178
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:44,400
don't really like Windows, but I think as a UI, that's perfectly fine.

179
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:45,860
So I like it.

180
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:50,440
It's been ages since I've tried out Cinnamon or Mint of any description, but I think I

181
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:52,400
should maybe give it a bit more attention.

182
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:56,000
I think if I was going to switch to Mint, I'd probably want to go with the main edition

183
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:02,160
because if I were betting on the odds in Vegas, I would bet that between Ubuntu, Linux Mint

184
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:07,280
proper and Debian and Linux Mint Debian edition, if any one of those distros was ever going

185
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:11,360
to go away, first I would bet on Linux Mint Debian edition going away.

186
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:16,520
Then before I ever bet on Ubuntu going away, I'd bet on Debian going away because the project

187
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:18,200
is cratering right now anyways.

188
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:22,700
People are living in a fantasy land if they think Debian is in a sustainable point right

189
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:23,700
now.

190
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:27,440
I haven't been listening to enough of these shows, but this project is on the verge of

191
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,440
cratering.

192
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:32,480
And there may be a future where Ubuntu has to pull this up by its bootstraps and just

193
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:36,280
have their own repository that they build off and we have Ubuntu proper.

194
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:41,560
I would bet on that way more than I'd bet on this escape hatch ever needing to be pulled

195
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:42,980
for the Mint project.

196
00:11:42,980 --> 00:11:47,060
And so I just look at this from a practical standpoint and go, I don't know if I see another

197
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:48,500
five years in this.

198
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:53,040
You might be right, but it never hurts to hedge your bets to some extent.

199
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:57,920
I suppose it depends how much in terms of resources and time is going into this.

200
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:02,440
If it's just a kind of side project for them, then why not keep it on the back burner?

201
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:03,440
That's what I think.

202
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:07,040
And that's why when we talk about their cadence and some of the packages being out of date,

203
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:12,840
I think that makes sense when you consider this is it's a plan B and I think it gets

204
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:14,720
the right amount of appropriate resources.

205
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:23,240
I'm reminded of the old tales that Apple used to keep x86 max in the bowels of Apple when

206
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:25,360
they were on power PC just in case.

207
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:27,320
And then one day, guess what?

208
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:30,840
That became the predominant platform and the reason they were able to make that transition

209
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:36,520
successfully was because they had kept x86 builds and x86 machines around essentially

210
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:43,960
as hackintoshes and that gave them the runway to actually make it successful.

211
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:48,620
And that's kind of the same exact theory that's being applied here for Linux Mint.

212
00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:50,160
So I like it.

213
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:52,600
The idea, I mean, I get why they're doing it.

214
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:54,760
It even seems sort of practical.

215
00:12:54,760 --> 00:13:00,060
I just would maybe dial down the rhetoric a little bit in the announcement paragraph

216
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:01,060
for this release.

217
00:13:01,060 --> 00:13:06,520
Second sentence, quote, its goal is to ensure Linux Mint would be able to continue to deliver

218
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:13,360
the same user experiences and how much work would be involved if Ubuntu were ever to disappear.

219
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:17,200
And then it's actually restated a little bit later, too, in here.

220
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:23,660
That just seems almost a little disrespectful if you consider that Linux Mint was made possible

221
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:28,520
because it's able to piggyback on all of the work that goes into an LTS.

222
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:33,400
It's sort of been the mother's milk for this distribution that now pays a good amount of

223
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:35,040
money every single month.

224
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:39,680
It seems like you'd have some sort of reverence and respect for your parent distribution,

225
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:44,540
especially by my estimation, when it has a better shot than Debian at this point of surviving.

226
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:46,320
And yes, I understand Ubuntu is based on Debian.

227
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,840
Well, that leads us into the next story then, doesn't it?

228
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:52,000
And that is the Debian Project Leader Elections 2020.

229
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,460
And there are three candidates with quite different manifestos.

230
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:57,680
I think there's one candidate.

231
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:03,560
And that's why I am maybe hitting this as hard as I am in this episode, because I look

232
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:09,840
at these candidates in front of us, and I nearly panic for the future of my beloved

233
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:15,100
Debian distribution, a distribution that has been around for as long as I have been in

234
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:18,220
Linux and was key in me getting started.

235
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:21,160
It's a distribution that I have a deep respect for.

236
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:25,600
And the three candidates that are applying, well, at least two of the three are not ideal.

237
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,480
This project is in bad shape.

238
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:29,960
People are in denial about the state of this project.

239
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:33,220
And I don't really see anyone fully addressing any of it.

240
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:38,120
I don't think any of them fully solve the problems the project is facing right now.

241
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:39,120
Do you feel that way?

242
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:42,960
Yeah, I think that whoever wins, you're going to have problems.

243
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:49,400
You've got Jonathan Carter, whose platform is continue to do what Debian does well, among

244
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:53,180
some other things as well, but he concentrates on technical excellence and promoting free

245
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:58,260
software and things like that, basically more of the same.

246
00:14:58,260 --> 00:15:02,580
And he kind of does address some of the other issues that are there, but he's very much

247
00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:05,060
the continuity candidate.

248
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:11,580
Then you've got Sruti Chandran, whose platform is very much about diversity.

249
00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:18,520
It's not quite a single issue, but it's very much concentrating on the diversity angle

250
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:21,040
and increasing diversity within Debian.

251
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:23,620
And she doesn't have as much experience as the other candidates.

252
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:28,300
And we know that diversity is a very divisive issue.

253
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:33,320
And then you've got Brian Gupta, who says, I'm running for DPL with a singular goal,

254
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:38,960
the creation of Debian US and EU foundations, I largely view my candidacy as a referendum

255
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:41,060
on this goal and its details.

256
00:15:41,060 --> 00:15:43,960
So he's very much a single issue candidate.

257
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:48,720
And he describes in his platform about how he's going to achieve that.

258
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:54,360
And it's basically adding a lot of bureaucracy, which he sees is required for the project

259
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:55,760
to continue.

260
00:15:55,760 --> 00:16:01,140
So you've got three very different approaches here, which are all kind of divisive in their

261
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:02,140
own way.

262
00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:06,620
So it seems that no matter who wins, it's not going to solve any problems.

263
00:16:06,620 --> 00:16:10,900
And we kind of talked about this a couple of episodes ago, that it needs someone to

264
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:16,340
come in and really take charge of this situation and bring everyone together, but maybe that's

265
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:17,340
just impossible.

266
00:16:17,340 --> 00:16:20,740
Soterios Johnson Clearly, Carter and Gupta have the most experience

267
00:16:20,740 --> 00:16:21,740
with Debian.

268
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:25,580
Gupta has been a Debian member for about seven years.

269
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:33,320
Carter has been in the development field for a long time, but also been in Debian the project

270
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:35,520
itself for quite a while.

271
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:41,920
And then Chandran is new, she's been a developer since May of 2019 and a maintainer of a package

272
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:44,080
on Debian since 2016.

273
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:51,720
My concern is all of these candidates, while good candidates for those singular issues,

274
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:55,660
are not addressing the spectrum of problems that's going to cause this distribution to

275
00:16:55,660 --> 00:16:57,460
implode upon itself.

276
00:16:57,460 --> 00:17:01,980
Debian is a platform, it's more than just a couple of packages, it's more than one architecture.

277
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:02,980
Debian itself is a platform.

278
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:09,100
It's an entire operating system that uses the Linux kernel, really, and the GPL land.

279
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:12,500
I don't feel like any of them are looking at it from that perspective.

280
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:17,080
And additionally, the only one that seems to actually have the experience and a somewhat

281
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:18,980
decent platform seems to be Carter.

282
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:23,140
So there only really seems to be one candidate here who has the goal for technical excellence

283
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:29,040
and making the community easier and more straightforward to contribute and participate in, and remove

284
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:33,780
bottlenecks for new contributors, and work on attending to some of the basic housekeeping

285
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:36,480
items of the Debian project that have been neglected.

286
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:39,600
Carter is the only one that's addressing all of those, and I don't normally hit this so

287
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:40,600
hard.

288
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:44,380
In fact, we've covered Debian elections twice now on this show before, and I've never hit

289
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:45,700
it this hard before.

290
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:48,460
But I cannot stress this fact enough.

291
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:51,460
If you are not paying attention to what's happening to the Debian project, you need

292
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:53,820
to wake up and pay attention to what's happening.

293
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:54,820
And this matters.

294
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:59,140
This election for the Debian project, it matters more than any of these we've ever covered

295
00:17:59,140 --> 00:18:03,340
before in the 13 years that I've been on air covering Debian news.

296
00:18:03,340 --> 00:18:07,940
Well, I wouldn't go that far as to say that the project's doomed or anything, but I think

297
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:13,460
it is in serious trouble, and whoever wins this does need to bring it together.

298
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:16,460
I think reading through the platforms, you're probably right.

299
00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:21,180
I would probably vote for Jonathan Carter, but I do worry that he's going to kind of

300
00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:26,940
leave behind the people who want to see more diversity and stuff.

301
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:31,860
And this system D situation that's been bubbling again, there's not really any mention of that

302
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:37,300
in any of these platforms here, so that's going to have to be dealt with.

303
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:42,620
It does seem like they're going to be testing times ahead, and I just don't have huge confidence

304
00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:46,820
reading through these three that any of them are going to be able to manage it.

305
00:18:46,820 --> 00:18:51,500
I foresee them not doing more than one term, put it that way.

306
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:53,300
This definitely comes from a place of passion for me.

307
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:57,180
I am oddly enough extremely passionate about the Debian project.

308
00:18:57,180 --> 00:19:04,420
I think it's just an essential, essential part of the free software ecosystem.

309
00:19:04,420 --> 00:19:10,460
And I think to play nice, everyone has sort of glossed over how bad this has gotten.

310
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:14,980
And to your earlier point, one of the reasons why I think they are quite doomed is it's

311
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:15,980
too late.

312
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:19,820
The conversations are too far along to just shut individuals out.

313
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:23,900
These people need and deserve representation because they are now officially parts of the

314
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:26,780
project, and their viewpoints have to be heard.

315
00:19:26,780 --> 00:19:31,860
And if they're ignored, it's just going to irritate the problem that much worse, and

316
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:34,500
it's going to slow things down that much more.

317
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:38,780
I think we've probably hit this maybe even harder than we need to, but I think what I

318
00:19:38,780 --> 00:19:42,940
am worried is, is that I'm going to spend the next two years on the air, or longer,

319
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:46,780
I don't know how long, documenting the collapse of this distribution.

320
00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:51,540
And that, it literally chokes me up and makes me sick to my stomach to think about that.

321
00:19:51,540 --> 00:19:52,860
I don't think it's going to collapse.

322
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:57,340
I think that it's going to change, and that change may well be for the worse, but I don't

323
00:19:57,340 --> 00:20:00,820
think it's just going to go away after 20-odd years of being around.

324
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:02,140
Yeah, I suppose you're right.

325
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:07,140
After all, I think I have family members who still watch VHS.

326
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:09,460
I think my mom's still got some somewhere.

327
00:20:09,460 --> 00:20:14,860
Well, from the free software end of Linux to completely the other end, this week we

328
00:20:14,860 --> 00:20:17,780
saw the announcement of the Works with Chromebook stickers.

329
00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:21,260
Well, it is Gen 2 after all, Joe, just not as we know it.

330
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:23,180
Not as we know it.

331
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:27,820
These are, much like other manufacturers that have Works with, it's a similar idea where

332
00:20:27,820 --> 00:20:32,780
Google will actually test the accessories to ensure they comply with Chromebooks, and

333
00:20:32,780 --> 00:20:34,320
then they put a badge on there.

334
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:37,180
And then you know that it's good to go with a Chromebook.

335
00:20:37,180 --> 00:20:42,060
I do like this from the standpoint of Chromebooks are great for family members that don't need

336
00:20:42,060 --> 00:20:46,820
a Windows or a Mac machine for their computer uses, and Chromebooks kind of work well for

337
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:47,820
that.

338
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:51,300
And now you can just point them at a category of chargers and keyboards and other accessories

339
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:56,460
like cables and adapters that are all tested by Google to work with the Chromebook.

340
00:20:56,460 --> 00:20:58,260
It's kind of a nice idea.

341
00:20:58,260 --> 00:21:02,400
Yeah, and my first thought was if it's going to work with a Chromebook, it's going to work

342
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,860
with basically any Linux distro.

343
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:07,500
That's what I was just going to say, and there's some nice stuff on here.

344
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:12,220
You know, Logitech has some devices like webcams and headsets that are supposedly going to be

345
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:16,600
certified to work with Chromebooks, which really means, and that's why I made the Gen 2 joke,

346
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:19,820
they're working with the Linux kernel because that's where these drivers are implemented.

347
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:24,380
Yeah, so this is ultimately something we've talked about for a long time, which is having

348
00:21:24,380 --> 00:21:28,140
a Works with Linux sticker, which is effectively what we're talking about here.

349
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:32,700
It might be through the back door and, you know, there might be some proprietary stuff

350
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:38,540
on top of Linux that Google is controlling and capturing all your data, but ultimately

351
00:21:38,540 --> 00:21:44,300
you will be able to walk into a bricks and mortar shop, look around at the accessories

352
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:46,580
and know what is going to actually work with Linux.

353
00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:51,180
I mean, these days, most of it is just going to work anyway, but this way you'll actually

354
00:21:51,180 --> 00:21:52,180
know.

355
00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:53,180
Yep.

356
00:21:53,180 --> 00:21:55,700
You can pay a little extra for the USB-C charger right next to the same exact thing that doesn't

357
00:21:55,700 --> 00:21:56,700
have the sticker.

358
00:21:56,700 --> 00:21:58,260
That'll be great.

359
00:21:58,260 --> 00:21:59,260
Oh, what's this?

360
00:21:59,260 --> 00:22:02,500
Oh, I see a sticker on their website for Works with Fuchsia.

361
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:04,900
No, I'm kidding.

362
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:05,900
That'll be in the future.

363
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:06,900
One day.

364
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:11,940
One of the things that family members have often needed is the ability to print and scan,

365
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:16,500
and that's where it gets a little weird with Chromebooks, but it appears Chrome OS will

366
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:22,380
soon get a print management app that just simply allows Chrome OS users to view and

367
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:25,660
manage native local print jobs.

368
00:22:25,660 --> 00:22:31,340
And because why not, Google seems like they're also slamming in a scanner UI into the print

369
00:22:31,340 --> 00:22:37,100
manager app so you can also interact and scan with a connected scanner.

370
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:42,580
Honestly, that's like the number one missing feature for family members that have Chromebooks.

371
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:48,960
So I would not be surprised if they are just slowly incorporating different user feedbacks

372
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:54,220
from schools and general user communities and just checking these features off in Chrome

373
00:22:54,220 --> 00:22:55,220
OS over time.

374
00:22:55,220 --> 00:22:59,380
Yeah, and eventually it's just going to become yet another full blown Linux distro.

375
00:22:59,380 --> 00:23:02,940
It started out as just a browser and look how far they've come.

376
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:08,700
Yeah, it truly is a full blown desktop operating system now with window management, Linux apps,

377
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:10,600
a printer and scanner UI.

378
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:13,740
The only thing it's missing is a way for me to set up my modem.

379
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:17,900
Yeah, and I don't know how they're going to solve the problem of not being able to connect

380
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:21,260
to your printer because I don't think I've ever seen a Chromebook with a serial port

381
00:23:21,260 --> 00:23:22,260
on it.

382
00:23:22,260 --> 00:23:23,260
Oh, boy.

383
00:23:23,260 --> 00:23:24,260
There you go.

384
00:23:24,260 --> 00:23:25,260
There's no serial port.

385
00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:26,260
No, it's fine.

386
00:23:26,260 --> 00:23:28,460
I have an adapter so I can use my parallel port.

387
00:23:28,460 --> 00:23:29,460
Right.

388
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:35,940
But in slightly more serious news, Chrome and Chrome OS updates are going to be paused

389
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:38,420
because of this virus situation.

390
00:23:38,420 --> 00:23:41,900
They are going to continue to offer security updates.

391
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:46,420
That's kind of what they're concentrating on, which I think is quite a sensible approach

392
00:23:46,420 --> 00:23:48,220
in these testing times.

393
00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:53,060
So you're telling me that somehow the coronavirus is delaying Chrome OS releases?

394
00:23:53,060 --> 00:23:57,660
I find this to be a fascinating limitation in the Google infrastructure.

395
00:23:57,660 --> 00:24:01,180
I wonder if it's one that's a technical limitation.

396
00:24:01,180 --> 00:24:04,120
Is it a security limitation?

397
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:09,620
What is it that prevents them from issuing Chrome OS updates when staff are not physically

398
00:24:09,620 --> 00:24:10,620
in the office?

399
00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:16,060
Well, I am assuming here, based on no evidence, that they are just planning here.

400
00:24:16,060 --> 00:24:21,460
This is contingency planning because people might be taking time off and people might

401
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:23,460
be getting sick or whatever.

402
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:27,180
It just seems like if they put this out there now and just say, look, there's not going

403
00:24:27,180 --> 00:24:32,340
to be any Chrome OS updates or any major updates to the Chrome browser, but we will prioritize

404
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:36,540
security updates, it means even if they end up with a skeleton staff, they'll still be

405
00:24:36,540 --> 00:24:37,540
able to do that.

406
00:24:37,540 --> 00:24:39,420
So I think it's quite a sensible approach, really.

407
00:24:39,420 --> 00:24:40,660
I see what you're saying.

408
00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:44,620
So it's not so much that they can't mission impossible into a central chamber that has

409
00:24:44,620 --> 00:24:49,220
a button that has to be pressed with a retina ID authorization.

410
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:54,660
It's more like our staff are just dispersed, we're kind of unproductive, so we'll just

411
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:56,180
focus on security for now.

412
00:24:56,180 --> 00:24:57,180
Yeah, I think so.

413
00:24:57,180 --> 00:24:58,180
All right.

414
00:24:58,180 --> 00:25:01,000
I like the mission impossible visual, but I think you're right.

415
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:04,060
In the meantime, I'm looking at installing Papel, Joe.

416
00:25:04,060 --> 00:25:05,060
Papel.

417
00:25:05,060 --> 00:25:06,060
I'm done with Cups.

418
00:25:06,060 --> 00:25:11,340
Yeah, this seems to be what Michael Sweet has been working on since he left Apple where

419
00:25:11,340 --> 00:25:13,100
he was working on Cups.

420
00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:19,780
He was doing that weird label printer thing, but it seems that as part of that, that was

421
00:25:19,780 --> 00:25:26,340
called Lprint, this P-A-P-P-L, Papel project, has come and it's an alternative to Cups.

422
00:25:26,340 --> 00:25:28,820
A Cups alternative.

423
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:32,660
I didn't even know we needed it, but now I'm uninstalling it immediately and putting Papel

424
00:25:32,660 --> 00:25:36,180
on there because it supports all the major imaging formats, it supports printers that

425
00:25:36,180 --> 00:25:42,820
are connected via USB or like jet direct network connections and app sockets, and it's licensed

426
00:25:42,820 --> 00:25:45,780
under the Apache 2.0 license.

427
00:25:45,780 --> 00:25:47,980
It'll incorporate the label printer stuff.

428
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:54,540
It also leans heavily on the IPP everywhere standard, which is the internet print protocol

429
00:25:54,540 --> 00:25:56,180
and which is part of Cups as well.

430
00:25:56,180 --> 00:25:58,260
It seems like it'll be a nice modern version of Cups.

431
00:25:58,260 --> 00:26:02,420
I don't know why we need it, but I'm actually, I kind of joke about the whole story because

432
00:26:02,420 --> 00:26:05,740
it seems like printing and modems are such a solved problem right now.

433
00:26:05,740 --> 00:26:10,180
However, I'm kind of curious to see where this goes and it's one of the things that

434
00:26:10,180 --> 00:26:16,260
I love about Linux and free software is that sometimes to our detriment, nothing is done

435
00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:17,260
necessarily.

436
00:26:17,260 --> 00:26:21,220
Like how much innovation do you think has gone into the Windows Print Spooler in the

437
00:26:21,220 --> 00:26:23,220
last five years?

438
00:26:23,220 --> 00:26:25,460
Yeah, probably not much.

439
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:30,940
There's really very little incentive for a commercial company like Microsoft to throw

440
00:26:30,940 --> 00:26:34,900
30, 40 developers, which would cost them tons of money because these are well-paid people

441
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:39,620
on a very expensive part of the United States to update the Print Spooler, like it's just

442
00:26:39,620 --> 00:26:40,620
not a priority.

443
00:26:40,620 --> 00:26:44,220
It doesn't sell more licenses.

444
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:45,220
It's silly.

445
00:26:45,220 --> 00:26:50,680
But in the free software land, Michael Sweet had an itch to scratch and here we are looking

446
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:54,260
at modernizing a component that many of us assumed was done.

447
00:26:54,260 --> 00:26:57,660
And the great thing is, once again, you don't have to choose to use it either.

448
00:26:57,660 --> 00:26:58,660
Yeah, strange.

449
00:26:58,660 --> 00:27:01,500
There's competition in the space where I thought there never would be any.

450
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:03,060
So that's probably good.

451
00:27:03,060 --> 00:27:06,900
Well spin down your Bitcoin mining, Joe, and focus your GPU on fighting COVID-19.

452
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:12,780
Yeah, the Folding at Home project has seen a huge resurgence in the last couple of weeks.

453
00:27:12,780 --> 00:27:18,780
And now you can use those unused GPU and CPU cycles to contribute to potentially fighting

454
00:27:18,780 --> 00:27:19,780
this thing.

455
00:27:19,780 --> 00:27:27,300
CoreWeave, which is one of the largest Ethereum miners, has made a decision to redirect 0.2%,

456
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:34,180
which actually represents 6,000 GPUs towards Folding at Home to help fight COVID, which

457
00:27:34,180 --> 00:27:39,260
is a neat way for a company like this to kind of not only get some good PR, but generally

458
00:27:39,260 --> 00:27:42,780
contribute some very powerful resources to solving a problem.

459
00:27:42,780 --> 00:27:47,380
Yeah, and Intel and Nvidia are encouraging people to do this as well.

460
00:27:47,380 --> 00:27:51,900
There's been a massive jump of like, I think it was 30,000 people were doing it before.

461
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:55,920
Now there's an extra 400,000 and counting.

462
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:59,740
And another related story, just a quick follow up from last week, we talked about Firefox

463
00:27:59,740 --> 00:28:05,700
74 having been released, and they had disabled TLS 1.0 and 1.1.

464
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:09,820
And we were kind of joking about how surely there's no websites out there that are still

465
00:28:09,820 --> 00:28:10,820
using it.

466
00:28:10,820 --> 00:28:14,700
Well, it turns out there are some government sites still using the old standards.

467
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:22,260
So Firefox has temporarily re-enabled TLS 1.0 and 1.1, so people can actually still

468
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:23,260
access those sites.

469
00:28:23,260 --> 00:28:26,600
You know, we should have a rule on the show when we're trying to figure out who could

470
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:29,700
possibly be using ancient technology.

471
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:33,060
We should just assume it's some government in somewhere in the world.

472
00:28:33,060 --> 00:28:34,060
Somewhere.

473
00:28:34,060 --> 00:28:35,060
Yeah.

474
00:28:35,060 --> 00:28:36,060
Yeah.

475
00:28:36,060 --> 00:28:38,260
That's so not surprising when we think about it.

476
00:28:38,260 --> 00:28:41,300
So good on Mozilla, I suppose, to revert that change.

477
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:47,300
So that way, nobody has an issue during a global pandemic getting access to information.

478
00:28:47,300 --> 00:28:53,180
One other item that slipped in here that they're kind of pitching as a privacy improvement.

479
00:28:53,180 --> 00:28:59,100
I think it's actually kind of a bug fix for WebRTC in general, but you be the judge.

480
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:04,400
We're now providing better privacy for web voice and video calls when you're using WebRTC.

481
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:08,840
So depending on your WebRTC session scenario, you could be actually leaking your public

482
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:09,840
IP address.

483
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:12,500
It's one of the kind of downsides to using WebRTC.

484
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:17,600
However, now Firefox has added support for MD&S ICE, which cloaks your computer's IP

485
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:22,780
with a random ID in some of those WebRTC scenarios, improving your privacy.

486
00:29:22,780 --> 00:29:27,100
I think you could probably argue that maybe it should have been designed this way from

487
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:32,540
the very beginning, or you could argue it's an implementation detail and so it's a feature.

488
00:29:32,540 --> 00:29:34,620
Well, either way, it's good news.

489
00:29:34,620 --> 00:29:38,540
And while the world's dealing with all of this, it's business as usual for us.

490
00:29:38,540 --> 00:29:43,140
So go to linuxactionnews.com slash subscribe for all the ways to get future episodes.

491
00:29:43,140 --> 00:29:47,660
And we'd love to hear from you, linuxactionnews.com slash contact for all the ways to get in touch.

492
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:51,740
And if you'd like my analysis on the world events going on right now, check out Unfilter.

493
00:29:51,740 --> 00:29:52,740
unfilter.show.

494
00:29:52,740 --> 00:29:54,080
It's back, baby.

495
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:58,500
And just to say Foss Talk Live 2020, which I've mentioned on the show before, that has

496
00:29:58,500 --> 00:29:59,500
now been canceled.

497
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:02,740
I won't be doing that for pretty obvious reasons.

498
00:30:02,740 --> 00:30:05,300
You can read more about that at fostalk.com.

499
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:06,300
Maybe in 2021, eh?

500
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:09,660
Well, in the meantime, we'll be back next Monday with our weekly take on the latest

501
00:30:09,660 --> 00:30:11,580
Linux and open source news.

502
00:30:11,580 --> 00:30:13,860
You can find me at chrislass.com.

503
00:30:13,860 --> 00:30:15,660
And you can find me at joelrest.com.

504
00:30:15,660 --> 00:30:18,100
Thanks for joining us and we'll see you next week.

505
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:36,180
See you later.
