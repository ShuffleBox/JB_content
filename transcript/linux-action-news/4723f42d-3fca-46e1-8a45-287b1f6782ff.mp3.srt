00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,680
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, episode 190, recorded on May 21st, 2021. I'm Chris.

2
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:10,680
And I'm Wes.

3
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:12,760
Hello, Wes. Let's do the news.

4
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:17,920
Google I.O. was this week, and there were two announcements in particular we thought

5
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:26,080
you might be interested in. First up is Chrome OS's Linux app support finally leaving beta

6
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:32,160
with the release of Chrome OS 91. Google's been adding a lot of new features during the

7
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:38,720
beta, enabling things like GPU acceleration and better support for USB drives. We learned

8
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:44,320
about this exciting status change at the end of the Chrome OS keynote at Google I.O. this

9
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:45,320
week.

10
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:50,520
Now back to Emily for a quick update on Linux before we wrap up.

11
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:56,700
Thanks, Sanjay. Regarding developing on Chromebooks, I am really pleased to announce that the Linux

12
00:00:56,700 --> 00:01:01,860
development environment is going to be out of beta in our next release. There have been

13
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:08,620
a lot of updates over the last year, including a new terminal app, better USB support, configurable

14
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:14,420
port forwarding, and a whole lot of work on performance and stability. One nice improvement

15
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:19,840
is that now, when you install a Chrome OS update, your Linux container is updated at

16
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:26,720
the same time. Before, you had to wait 3, 5, or up to 15 minutes for it to update independently

17
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:30,520
after an OS update. No longer.

18
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:36,120
This is a nice example of the increasing polish happening with Linux on Chrome OS. Linux and

19
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:41,420
developing right on a Chromebook is one of my favorite features, so I love that the integration

20
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:42,840
is getting better and better.

21
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:48,360
A deeper dive into many of the topics we have touched on today, including Linux, optimizing

22
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:55,080
Android apps, building PWAs, as well as many more all about developing for and on Chrome

23
00:01:55,080 --> 00:02:01,160
OS, can be found at ChromeOS.dev. With that, I would like to thank you for your continued

24
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:07,240
enthusiasm for our awesome operating system over the last 10 years, and I hope you will

25
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:15,560
be right there with us for the next 10.

26
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:21,000
After that Linux support, Google also announced that it would bring Android 11 to Chromebooks.

27
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:26,720
Technically, that update has already started with Chrome OS 90 for some select Chromebooks,

28
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:31,880
and it will just come with a whole new host of features, including increased optimization

29
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:37,160
of Android apps and a new dark theme. In fact, a big focus of Google I.O. this week was getting

30
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:40,220
Android apps ready for bigger screens.

31
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:45,480
The second announcement out of I.O. we thought you should know about is some good news for

32
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:53,160
the likes of F-Droid. Android 12 will finally let alternative app stores update their apps

33
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:54,160
on their own.

34
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:59,720
We got the first hints of this back in September, but now we're seeing signs in code that actually

35
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:04,440
enable the support. Google has updated Android's package installer session params class with

36
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:09,880
a new method called setRequireUserAction. Now, that little bit of magic there indicates

37
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:14,640
whether or not the user action will be required before an app install is allowed.

38
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:20,920
And assuming the app in question meets Google's requirements, user action won't be needed

39
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:26,420
for an app installation or update. So when an app that has met the requirements tries

40
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:32,880
to initiate an installation and it uses this new API, it'll be able to update without the

41
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:36,160
user being involved. That's pretty slick.

42
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:40,600
Our next story makes you wonder what's in store for desktop Linux because Red Hat has

43
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:48,360
opened several job positions this week that are focused around the desktop graphics stack.

44
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:52,320
A couple of the positions are focusing on upstream drivers for open source code around

45
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:57,800
Intel, AMD and Nvidia. And outside of those two graphics engineer positions, Red Hat is

46
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:02,220
also hiring a software engineer for the graphics team to be based out of the Czech Republic.

47
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:08,160
And then rounding out all of that is another opening on their Linux automotive team. So

48
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:12,760
we'll have links to the job positions and Christian's blog post that goes through all

49
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:19,120
the details in the show notes.

50
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:25,920
At the end of 2019, the developer of CUPS, the common Unix printing service for Linux

51
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:34,520
and Mac OS, Mike Sweet, left Apple. Following that, it was very noticeable that public development

52
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:41,880
of the project seemed to have come to a halt. But now, there is a major development. Seemingly

53
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:47,400
confirming their intent to no longer develop the subsystem, Apple has effectively transferred

54
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:54,860
CUPS to the Open Printing Project. Sweet presented on this change at this month's Open Printing

55
00:04:54,860 --> 00:05:00,400
Summit and acknowledged that Apple stopped actively developing CUPS when he left the

56
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:06,840
company. But now, he's been contracted by Apple to apply important bug fixes from the

57
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:12,640
Open Printing fork of CUPS back to the Apple CUPS code for Mac OS.

58
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:18,680
And it seems now Open Printing is working on a new CUPS 2.4 release with AirPrint compatibility,

59
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:23,760
OAuth authentication, Package Config support, Snap support, TLS improvements, and really

60
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:30,240
a variety of other feature improvements, making CUPS 2.4 effectively the new upstream of the

61
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:34,600
market. And it seems even early plans are in the works for CUPS 3.0, which will feature

62
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:42,440
a bit of re-architecting, amongst other things.

63
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:48,320
Everyone's favorite fox learned some new tricks this week. On Tuesday, Mozilla introduced

64
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:55,880
Firefox's new Site Isolation Security Architecture. In a blog post, they wrote,

65
00:05:55,880 --> 00:06:00,280
Site isolation builds upon a new security architecture that extends current protection mechanisms

66
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:06,480
by separating web content and loading each site into its own operating system process.

67
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:11,320
This new security architecture allows Firefox to completely separate code originating from

68
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:17,040
different sites and, in turn, defend against malicious sites trying to access sensitive

69
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:19,840
information from other sites you are visiting.

70
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:26,160
Basically, here's the problem. Without site isolation, the browser will load embedded

71
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:31,840
pages, whatever they might be, whether that's a bank page or an advertisement, in the same

72
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:38,280
process as the top-level document. So, in a more dangerous scenario, a malicious site

73
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:44,040
could embed a legitimate site within a subframe and then try to trick you into entering your

74
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:49,620
sensitive information. And with the current architecture, if a page contains any subframes

75
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:55,160
from a different site, they will be generally in the same process as the outer tab.

76
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:59,360
Yeah, that doesn't sound very nice. Very clean, does it? That's where site isolation

77
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:04,920
comes in. Firefox will load each site into its own process, thereby isolating their memory

78
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:09,280
from each other. And it relies on the security guarantees of your hopefully up to date and

79
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:15,320
secure operating system. And on top of security, there, of course, are other benefits to site

80
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:20,920
isolation. Poorly performing tabs won't necessarily have an impact on each other. And then there's

81
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:26,360
the aspect of more cores, right? Using more processes to load websites allows Firefox

82
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:32,720
to spread that work across CPU cores and take better advantage of the underlying hardware.

83
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:36,600
One wonders if there'll be a battery impact, but I'm all for lighting up those cores.

84
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:42,640
Mozilla is currently testing site isolation on the nightly and beta versions of the desktop

85
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:49,240
browsers with a subset of users, but should be rolling out to more desktop users soon.

86
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:54,560
If you can't wait though, you can enable it now in the nightly with an about preferences

87
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:59,160
tweak. Of course, we'll have a link in the show notes with details.

88
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:05,260
Well, believe it or not, it's been a month since we learned about the University of Minnesota's

89
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:10,660
ban from the Linux kernel and the hypocrite commit research that they were conducting.

90
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:16,200
This week, the kernel developers completed their review of all of the UMN patches. Part

91
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:21,440
of that work was addressing some of the questionable and problematic patches instead of just outright

92
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:23,000
rejecting them.

93
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:30,320
And the work on those problematic patches should land in Linux 5.13. A rather packed

94
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:34,940
pull request sent out on Thursday by Greg Grohe-Hartman noted,

95
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:40,420
The majority here is the fallout of the UMN.edu review or re-review of all the prior

96
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:46,260
submissions that resulted in a bunch of reverts along with the correct changes made. And there

97
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:50,700
is no regression of any other potential fixes that were made by those individuals. I would

98
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:56,320
like to thank the over 80 different developers who helped with the review and fixes for this

99
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,800
mess.

100
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:04,560
Going by git activity from the UMN.edu address, it looks like the kernel developers pulled

101
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:12,300
37 patches from a diverse set of subsystems, stuff like ulsa, media, networking, and more

102
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:20,880
than a few others. But for a little context, that's 37 reverts out of 150 plus total patches

103
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:26,840
from UMN developers over the last few years. We'll link to Michael Harbel's post that

104
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:32,300
goes through the patch comments and a few choice explanations he found for some of the

105
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:35,620
problems with those patches.

106
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:40,580
Linode.com slash LAN go there to receive $100 in 60 day credit towards a new account. And

107
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:45,700
of course, you support the show. Linode is the largest independent cloud computing provider.

108
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:49,260
And no matter what skill level you're at, Linode is going to work for you. They're our

109
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:54,700
hosting provider. Linode is like our secret member of our team. We get the presence and

110
00:09:54,700 --> 00:10:01,380
the performance and the reliability of a large enterprise company while still being a small

111
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:07,580
team. It's like I outsourced all my data center stuff to Linode. And it's perfect that way.

112
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:12,580
They let me focus on what JB does best. And they have a simple cloud infrastructure that's

113
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:17,640
crazy fast, and is built from the ground up around Linux. You know, they have been around

114
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:22,740
since 2003. So they picked each thing they've done, and they focused in on it since then

115
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:27,140
and they've just really gotten good. So performance, they've they've figured that out and they've

116
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:32,740
really got fast systems, native SSD storage, 40 gigabit connections to the hypervisor,

117
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:38,220
their dedicated CPU rigs have AMD epic processors that just crushed the competition. But their

118
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:42,860
dashboard is so straightforward that even if you're not an expert at this kind of stuff,

119
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:45,920
you're going to find it very approachable. And then on top of that, they have a bunch

120
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:51,260
of guides and tutorials, and then the best support in the business. Additionally, they

121
00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:56,080
have services around that hosting like s3 compatible object storage, which could really

122
00:10:56,080 --> 00:11:00,740
up your backup game or your config offsite game or just setting up a static website.

123
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:04,840
They have cloud firewalls and simple one click deployments of lots of common open source

124
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:09,700
application stacks, and so much more. So I really want to encourage you to go try out

125
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:13,940
that $100 because that's a legit amount of money that you can really do something with.

126
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:17,620
And I could sit here and go on and on and tell you about why I've chosen to use Linode.

127
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:23,460
But I'd like you to go see go to Linode.com slash land get that $100 credit. And then

128
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:27,580
feel free to move in because Linode is 30 to 50% less than the big cloud over there

129
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:33,700
at AWS or Google or Azure. Think about that better performance, an independent company

130
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:39,220
who supports the Linux community and manages to be 30 to 50% less. That's pretty great.

131
00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:42,420
And they have 11 data centers worldwide. So you're going to find just the right spot to

132
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:46,660
deploy for you or your users. And you're going to rest easy knowing that Linode has built

133
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:50,480
in monitoring tools that keep an eye on your system. And they'll send you an email if anything

134
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:55,060
looks kind of funky. And that's often a heads up that something's going on. And you can

135
00:11:55,060 --> 00:11:59,540
get to it before your users even notice a problem. Go try them out at Linode.com slash

136
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:04,900
land Linux dot ting.com. If you're sick of overpaying for cell service, go see how much

137
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:10,380
you could save and then take 25 bucks off of that by visiting Linux dot ting.com. Ting

138
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:17,420
has their set 12 plan, which is a power plan. You get unlimited talk, unlimited text and

139
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:24,460
12 gigs of data for just $35 a month. They have great family plans to where you can pool

140
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:29,500
data and you can obviously have unlimited calls and text there. And the other great

141
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:33,860
thing about Ting is they have three networks that you can choose from. And so there is

142
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:38,060
such a good chance that you can pick the one that's the best service in your area. It also

143
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:43,300
means they have just a massive compatibility with phones. If you use two gigs or use 20

144
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:48,460
gigs or whatever, there's a perfect Ting plan for you. And every single one of those plans

145
00:12:48,460 --> 00:12:53,420
comes with access to Ting's award winning customer service and of course access to their

146
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:59,040
nationwide LTE and 5G coverage, which is so handy when I'm traveling. I'll sometimes carry

147
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:03,060
multiple devices because Ting's pricing is so simple and straightforward. I don't have

148
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:06,860
to invest the hundreds of dollars to have some of the other carriers, but I still get

149
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:11,700
access to their networks. And the beauty thing about Ting is their website. You guys know

150
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:16,060
I love a dashboard for days and they've got a great one. It's simple to manage just about

151
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:20,300
everything you're ever going to need to do. And I'm, I think I'm going on seven years

152
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:25,620
maybe as a Ting customer now. And I've called in twice like ever. And one of them was for

153
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:30,420
like an esoteric data issue on a dedicated data device. And they just hung on the line

154
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:34,820
forever. Well, like two and a half hours, which is like forever in support call time

155
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:39,380
and just worked it out with me, even though at the end it wasn't really a Ting problem.

156
00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:43,740
I mean, I just like, I felt like I was tight with that rep by the time we were all done.

157
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:46,980
It's customer service at a next level when you need it, but the website really manages

158
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:51,800
everything with that dashboard. So just had the linux.ting.com to check your current phone

159
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:56,020
because it's likely with their multiple network, it's going to be supported. You create an

160
00:13:56,020 --> 00:13:59,740
account, you pick the plan that's just right for you. And then Ting will send you a SIM

161
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:03,100
card and you just pop that in your phone. You go to the site and you finish up the activation

162
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:07,260
and you're good to go. And if you went to linux.ting.com, you're taking 25 bucks off

163
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:11,680
whatever great price Ting's already given you. Cutting your phone bill in half has never

164
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:17,480
been easier with Ting's plans. So go to linux.ting.com and see the next generation of Ting mobile.

165
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:23,420
It's here and it's fantastic. Linux.ting.com.

166
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:29,380
In our discussion story this week, we wanted to cover something you've likely already heard

167
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:36,300
about. The many resignations over at the long running IRC network, Freenode. Originally

168
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:43,860
started in 1995, Freenode grew to become the de facto communication and support tool for

169
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:51,820
free and open source projects of all shapes and sizes. And by 2013, had officially become

170
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:59,500
the largest and most active IRC network in the world. Over the last few weeks, an organizational

171
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:06,060
split has been brewing. And what's clear right now, both sides of the split are proclaiming

172
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:09,620
the other side was attempting a hostile takeover.

173
00:15:09,620 --> 00:15:14,980
Boy, this story is is nearly impenetrable if you're coming at it from the outside. So

174
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:19,140
a way to help think about this and understand the situation is when you consider that there's

175
00:15:19,140 --> 00:15:24,100
Freenode the network, the IRC network that's made up of volunteers, some of which are fairly

176
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:27,980
new in all of this and some of which have been around for a long time. And then there's

177
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:33,440
Freenode Limited, the company which owns the Freenode domain, trademark, has contributed

178
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:40,020
financially in some capacities and is owned by Andrew Lee. There are some paid people,

179
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:46,860
but the bulk of what we consider, quote, Freenode staff are really just their volunteers. And

180
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:52,460
my impression is not many of the two groups from the Freenode Limited team and the Freenode

181
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:57,220
volunteer team ever really mixed much. There was some interactions, but with just maybe

182
00:15:57,220 --> 00:16:03,060
a few at the top of the volunteer team. Essentially, there were two communities within the Freenode

183
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:10,340
staff. Andrew Lee, of private internet access fame, purchased the domain and trademarks

184
00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:17,980
and Freenode Limited company in 2017. But more recently, discussions over control of

185
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:24,020
the Freenode DNS escalated into a series of staff resignations, with many of the staff

186
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:31,900
leaving to join a recently established and competing IRC network known as LiberaChat.

187
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:37,580
And with each side of the split releasing statements, chat, transcripts, and even screenshots

188
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:42,380
of conversations, it's been more than a little complicated to sort through and figure out

189
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:44,020
just what happened here.

190
00:16:44,020 --> 00:16:49,840
I think it hasn't helped that one side of the conversation has been a little overrepresented.

191
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:54,360
And that's the LiberaChat side. They were very organized in all of this. They had their

192
00:16:54,360 --> 00:17:00,160
letters ready to go. They linked to each other's letters and kept that updated. And of course,

193
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:04,780
they had their new infrastructure waiting in the wings. And it seems there was a fight

194
00:17:04,780 --> 00:17:08,660
over the DNS, they wanted control of the DNS of Freenode as well. And so they may have

195
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:13,580
just taken over the Freenode infrastructure had that not gotten shut down by Lee. I guess

196
00:17:13,580 --> 00:17:18,420
it just reminds me of that old adage that there are two sides to every story. But you

197
00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:23,540
know, it's clear, whatever the full story is, there was a large group of the staff that

198
00:17:23,540 --> 00:17:27,980
were just unhappy, and they wanted some kind of change. And in my opinion, the situation

199
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:34,700
just got a bit explosive when lawyers started sending letters. I think open source volunteers

200
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:39,980
and this I'm including the Freenode volunteers in this, they, you know, they don't like it

201
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:45,300
when the lawyers get involved. Things get legally vague real quick. And just getting

202
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:50,780
lawyers involved could cause some volunteers to nope out and just resign right there.

203
00:17:50,780 --> 00:17:56,220
Yeah, there's definitely that aspect to this where it's a weird intersection between private

204
00:17:56,220 --> 00:18:02,460
companies and enterprise and a loose knit group of volunteers and open source contributors

205
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:06,340
on the other side. And those two systems, well, they don't always mesh.

206
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:13,540
And then there's the elephant in the room that this is a fight of personalities. When

207
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:19,500
you look into this, there's a lot of strong, unique personalities, and they're making boisterous

208
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:27,260
claims that seem really intense. And so I think there is a element of they said versus

209
00:18:27,260 --> 00:18:32,420
they said here. And it's kind of like whatever team that people are jumping in on, they're

210
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:37,880
just going with that line. And I think not helping the situation is Andrew Lee himself

211
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:42,120
seems like kind of the type of character that people like to take shots at. He made some

212
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:47,380
money from Bitcoin. There's been some sort of tabloid style hit pieces on him. And so

213
00:18:47,380 --> 00:18:53,140
it's really kind of low hanging fruit for those click baity, lazy writers or YouTubers

214
00:18:53,140 --> 00:18:58,180
that just kind of want to get an opinion out there and grab some clicks and views. Andrew

215
00:18:58,180 --> 00:19:04,020
Lee makes for a character that's easy to take shots at. And it's an underdog story with

216
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:08,420
the libera chat folks, you know, coming up and forking and starting their own server

217
00:19:08,420 --> 00:19:12,380
from the ground up for open source projects. It's an underdog story that the community

218
00:19:12,380 --> 00:19:16,980
just loves to latch on. And I think those elements have all come together to really

219
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:21,940
kind of just skew everyone's perspective on what's gone down here. Well, we're kind of

220
00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:27,220
used to in the open source community being a little skeptical of private companies or

221
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:32,740
well resourced individuals getting in and at least being perceived to change projects

222
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:37,460
that we know and love. I mean, partly for good reason. But I think you're right here,

223
00:19:37,460 --> 00:19:43,940
there's been a huge information gap. And that means both sides are sort of reasonably upset.

224
00:19:43,940 --> 00:19:48,180
I mean, Andrew Lee sees himself as having been involved in Freenode for years. And yet

225
00:19:48,180 --> 00:19:51,860
here's longtime staff members on the other side saying, we don't really know who you

226
00:19:51,860 --> 00:19:57,540
are or think you're involved with Freenode. And I can understand both sides because it's

227
00:19:57,540 --> 00:20:03,300
just confusing what's going on, who's been involved and owns what? Yeah, and then there's

228
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:09,300
the obvious sort of like, really, we're fighting for who wants to be IRC King in 2021. Because

229
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:14,020
we make no mistake about it. Freenode's got to be one of the largest public IRC networks

230
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:19,780
out there, right? This is a fight for IRC King in 2021 right now. It just seems ridiculous.

231
00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:27,140
As unfortunate as all of this is, it also kind of seems to me that Freenode was in a

232
00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:32,980
sort of precarious place from an organizational governance structure already. I mean, it appears

233
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:38,740
that this transaction with Freenode Limited happened way back in 2017. And yet a number

234
00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:45,460
of staff claimed not to have any idea about it. And in 2021, seems like getting your open

235
00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:50,500
source set up with a foundation or nonprofit or other organizational entity is just really

236
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:54,740
important if you want things to continue on in an organized fashion that is hopefully

237
00:20:54,740 --> 00:21:02,260
less susceptible to personality disputes like this. Yeah, you think when you have competition

238
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:07,540
like Mattermost, Discord and like Slack, you kind of have to have your A game on already

239
00:21:07,540 --> 00:21:11,460
if you're IRC and you want to stick around and just sort of keep your entrenched real

240
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:15,860
estate. But the reality is they didn't have that. I think maybe everybody thought things

241
00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:21,780
were going just fine until there was this brouhaha that developed, this kerfuffle,

242
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:26,660
if you will. Well, and you know how it goes in open source organizations or volunteer

243
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:31,060
organizations. You maintain the little bits that you do. But unless you really want more

244
00:21:31,060 --> 00:21:36,500
work, you don't ask about the problems over there. But you're right. I mean, IRC is kind

245
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:40,580
of yesterday's technology at this point. And there are things like Mattermost, there's

246
00:21:40,580 --> 00:21:45,380
proprietary things like Slack, not to mention all the exciting work that's been happening

247
00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:49,940
over in the matrix community. Yeah, I think a lot of projects will stop and use this moment

248
00:21:49,940 --> 00:21:54,660
to consider some projects. I've already announced they're leaving free node some projects like Gen

249
00:21:54,660 --> 00:21:58,900
two said, No, we're gonna wait for all the facts. But I think everyone's kind of taking

250
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:04,020
this moment to go. Well, matrix really seems like they're getting it together. And they announced

251
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:09,380
spaces recently, which put simply is a way to group rooms and people together. And it comes

252
00:22:09,380 --> 00:22:14,260
in a few flavors depending on what size of organization you have. But to help us understand

253
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:18,900
how this could be beneficial to open source communities. And I think also help us understand

254
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:24,020
how this replaces matrixes previous community features. I want to play a clip of audio from

255
00:22:24,020 --> 00:22:29,460
Matthew Hodgson. He presented at Fossum 2021. And he's about to describe how they're discontinuing

256
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:36,660
their current matrix communities feature and focusing on the new spaces. What we decided to do

257
00:22:36,660 --> 00:22:45,220
is to burn it with fire, introducing spaces, matrix about change 1772. So how spaces work

258
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:50,980
is again, to group together your rooms and users, but we group them in a room. So you inherit all

259
00:22:50,980 --> 00:22:56,020
the intrinsic capability and goodness that you get in a matrix room, you get power levels, access

260
00:22:56,020 --> 00:23:00,740
control, invites membership, you can store any kind of room state in it as metadata, you get

261
00:23:00,740 --> 00:23:06,180
third party invites, get decentralized rooms, they're shared between servers, you can even

262
00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:12,180
bridge them into identity sources. So if you did have your big LDAP set of users, there probably

263
00:23:12,180 --> 00:23:17,060
always in future, you could bridge that into the room in order to define the membership on the

264
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:22,820
matrix side. And so that's basically the whole thesis of spaces, we throw away the entire groups

265
00:23:22,820 --> 00:23:28,580
and communities API and just use the one that we already have. It supports auto joining. So if you

266
00:23:28,580 --> 00:23:34,100
join a space, you have the ability to join the rooms within it. And more interestingly, we

267
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:39,460
support nested hierarchies of rooms in spaces. Wes, I think you could see how that would be just

268
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:44,100
inherently beneficial to open source projects that could use a little bit of organization and

269
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:49,060
spots for public members and spots for private development members. Yeah, it sounds like matrix

270
00:23:49,060 --> 00:23:54,500
was a little concerned that discord was becoming quite popular for open source projects because of

271
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:59,220
some of those features and functionality. And so on one level spaces is here to provide that

272
00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:04,420
structure and compete against similar chat applications. But the other fascinating angle

273
00:24:04,420 --> 00:24:10,820
to matrix is not to just view it as a platform for chat and instant messages. Because with spaces,

274
00:24:11,380 --> 00:24:18,580
they're now providing a decentralized hierarchical namespace with decentralized access controls

275
00:24:18,580 --> 00:24:24,980
for every room. And you can really think of a room as a pub sub topic like you might get

276
00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:30,980
on Kafka or MQTT or in all kinds of technologies. And that's where it might be really interesting

277
00:24:30,980 --> 00:24:35,700
to see what kinds of stuff will be built on top of matrix. I mean, you've already got things like

278
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:40,980
forums or blogging platforms that are built on matrix spaces will take that flexibility to the

279
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:46,420
next level, I think. And that would make the rooms that that would make them go across servers as

280
00:24:46,420 --> 00:24:50,900
well, right? So you would you could you could participate in a room that essentially spans

281
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:56,260
multiple matrix servers. Yeah, that's one practical benefit of a decentralized hierarchical namespace

282
00:24:56,260 --> 00:25:01,060
is you could have a space with rooms from different servers under that one same space.

283
00:25:02,020 --> 00:25:06,340
Spaces could become the main backbone of the protocol with chat rooms being mere just leaf

284
00:25:06,340 --> 00:25:13,300
nodes and a giant tree of collaboration was. And I kind of joke but matrix has serious potential

285
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:19,620
here. And they have a mobile game that IRC can't natively offer. And they have that bridge. So you

286
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:25,220
could bridge to your old IRC community and make the transition a little smoother. Although none

287
00:25:25,220 --> 00:25:29,540
of these features really matter if free software projects keep picking discord for their collaboration.

288
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:35,300
Yeah, I think we've all been a little nervous about that, which is why it's so nice to see

289
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:42,740
spaces out in beta. But we should probably stress that beta part. We haven't yet upgraded the JB

290
00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:49,060
matrix, but we'll be looking to do so soon. We look forward to seeing you. Indeed we do us and
