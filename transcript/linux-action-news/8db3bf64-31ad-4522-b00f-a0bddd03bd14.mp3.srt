00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,040
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, episode 177, recorded on February 21st, 2021.

2
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:10,040
I'm Chris.

3
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:11,040
And I'm Wes.

4
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:12,040
Hello, Wes.

5
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:13,040
Let's do the news.

6
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:14,040
Touchdown confirmed.

7
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:21,920
Perseverance safely on the surface of Mars, ready to begin seeking the sand of past life.

8
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:29,720
This week, as you likely already know, NASA landed a rover named Perseverance on Mars.

9
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:35,220
If you watched along with the two million others, you may or may not know Perseverance

10
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:45,240
has a Linux powered tiny helicopter in its belly.

11
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:53,280
It weighs about four pounds and its primary mission will be to master flight on Mars.

12
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:57,160
And it was the highlight of my week to chat with Tim Kenam, who is the Mars helicopter

13
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:59,040
operations lead at JPL.

14
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:03,120
I was hoping to get some Linux details and he did not disappoint.

15
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:08,240
He tells me that the Ingenuity helicopter and the helicopter base station that is attached

16
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:14,560
to the rover that acts as a radio relay, it uses a port of Lanero Linux, which is a popular

17
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:16,900
distro for embedded processors.

18
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:22,380
Some of the tech details are the board that it runs on is a it's a it's a board built

19
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:29,360
for them with a Qualcomm Snapdragon 801 with a quad core 2.2 gigahertz ARM processor in

20
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:30,360
it.

21
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:34,200
Tim also noted that the Linux distribution and board support package was provided to

22
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:39,000
JPL, but they did some tweaking and rebuilding for their use.

23
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,400
Also just as important to note here, the software running on that flying Linux box, it's open

24
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:44,400
source.

25
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:45,400
Oh, yeah.

26
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:48,840
Tim tells us they're using a flight software framework that JPL open sourced a couple of

27
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:51,540
years ago actually called F Prime.

28
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:52,540
How cool is this?

29
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:55,400
Because the OS, you know, Linux, it's it's open source and free software.

30
00:01:55,400 --> 00:02:01,980
But so is the software that solves real challenges for this Mars flying Linux copter.

31
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:07,200
So F Prime helps it deal with the conditions of flying in the Martian atmosphere, which

32
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:10,440
is much thinner than the Earth's atmosphere.

33
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:15,560
And that alone, despite power restrictions and other things, make it extremely tricky

34
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:17,200
to fly on Mars.

35
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:19,360
Yeah, that causes all kinds of problems.

36
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:23,120
One thing I didn't realize was it actually means that the speed of sound is much lower.

37
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,360
And so you're just closer to the speed of sound.

38
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:27,440
It's much harder to fly.

39
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:31,040
And as a result, the helicopter blades, they have to be made of a special composite because

40
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:35,240
they just have to go incredibly fast, which that takes a lot of power on its own.

41
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:38,080
But it also causes a lot of vibration that you have to dampen on the craft.

42
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,080
Yeah.

43
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:43,240
And not only do these types of blades have to run super, super fast, but the components

44
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:45,920
in the copter have to be kept warm.

45
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:51,860
So legitimately, two thirds of the Linux copter's power goes to just keeping the components

46
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:53,360
from freezing.

47
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,440
And then there's the delay.

48
00:02:55,440 --> 00:03:00,640
Mars is so far away that it takes radio signals quite a long time to get from the Linux copter

49
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:01,640
back here to Earth.

50
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:06,160
The team did actually at first try to build this thing to fly with a joystick.

51
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:09,240
If you were sitting right there on Mars and you were trying to joystick it, what is it

52
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:10,320
like?

53
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:12,160
And it's almost unflyable.

54
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:17,400
And the reason for that, it's the aerodynamics of when you want to command a roll to the

55
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:20,880
left because you see yourself starting to move to the right and you start commanding

56
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:23,400
a roll to the left, there's a delay aspect.

57
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:28,040
So that delay effect makes it very, very difficult for a human to try and pilot it.

58
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:31,480
Sounds to me like they're trying to use a really slow VNC connection.

59
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:35,000
And that's when they realized they'd need a local solution.

60
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,100
And then F Prime was born.

61
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:44,100
The way this flies autonomously, it has onboard gyros, onboard accelerometers and onboard

62
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:48,560
camera and altimeter and an inclinometer.

63
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:55,080
And so using that sensor suite, real time measurement against the terrain and of course

64
00:03:55,080 --> 00:04:01,720
the gyros and the accelerometers sensing onboard, the real time estimation of the state of the

65
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:09,920
vehicle is made continuously, again, hundreds of Hertz and then that's fed into the closed

66
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:15,560
loop control algorithm that takes the estimated state and then generates the correction that's

67
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:18,720
needed at the blade level.

68
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,860
And then the blades are continuously being controlled.

69
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:27,720
So when you see video tapes of our successful flights, right, and the vehicle looks dead

70
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:34,240
calm, is coming up and hovering and going laterally coming back, you know, the machines

71
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:37,120
are working very, very fast and very, very hard.

72
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:41,980
It just looks very calm, but yeah, so the blades are being continuously controlled.

73
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:47,200
That was Ingenuity project manager and she says that if the test flight coming up goes

74
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:51,200
well, we could potentially see a series of flights on Mars.

75
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:55,620
Each one of those flights teaches us more about complicated details of flying safely

76
00:04:55,620 --> 00:05:02,360
on Mars and you can imagine the ways this is going to be useful for future human visitors.

77
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:06,640
The other part I'm really excited about here is up to now, we've kind of only got like

78
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:08,660
selfies of these rovers.

79
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:12,540
This time as the landing was happening, we got a picture from an orbiting spacecraft,

80
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:14,760
but that's pretty tiny here.

81
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:18,840
If Ingenuity works and it actually gets to fly out there, we're going to be able to get

82
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:23,760
videos and pictures of Perseverance, perhaps even moving on the surface of Mars.

83
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:26,920
And I think that's going to connect with folks just at the next level.

84
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:32,200
And good news as we record this yesterday, NASA received a check-in signal from the Ingenuity

85
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:38,340
helicopter and all systems seem to read go, which is a series of milestones that will

86
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:39,340
be coming up.

87
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:43,600
We have a series of major milestones between now and Ingenuity's first flight.

88
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:48,600
So tomorrow we'll turn on the helicopter and the space station could confirm health after

89
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:52,200
experiencing the dynamics through the EDL just now.

90
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:57,560
And the next major milestone will be when the rover deploys the helicopter to the surface.

91
00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:03,080
And that marks the first moment that Ingenuity operates on its own in a standalone manner.

92
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:08,200
And surviving that first cold frigid night of Mars will be a major milestone.

93
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:13,040
Each one of these milestones is important because it gets us closer to having useful

94
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:17,480
flying gadgets on Mars to assist any future human visitors, you know, things like drones

95
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:20,280
you could actually send ahead and maybe scout things out for you.

96
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:26,520
A helicopter flying far ahead of rovers and astronauts in the future can provide high

97
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:31,860
definition reconnaissance information for the rovers and the astronauts before they

98
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:33,780
take the long journeys.

99
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:39,720
And as importantly, being able to fly will enable us to get to places that we cannot

100
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:45,400
get to with rovers and astronauts like sites of steep cliffs, deep inside crevices, areas

101
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:47,480
of high scientific interest.

102
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:49,380
It will be game changing.

103
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:55,520
This really is in the Wright brothers era of flight on Mars, I mean, early days.

104
00:06:55,520 --> 00:07:00,320
Yeah, Tim also shared with us that many of the components in the Linux copter are from

105
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:01,640
Spark Fun.

106
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:06,840
It's very much a DIY device that's just made up from a lot of regular old commercial components.

107
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:10,440
Yeah, and that f prime platform can actually run on a Raspberry Pi.

108
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:11,440
What?

109
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:12,440
Yeah, there you go.

110
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:13,440
Of course.

111
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:15,280
Tim also shared some additional Linux insights.

112
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:21,200
He said that the rover landing camera system that was used is also running Linux.

113
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:22,740
We haven't seen anybody else talking about this.

114
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:28,560
I don't think this has been widely discussed, but the system that helped land Perseverance

115
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:32,120
was running Linux on a ruggedized x86 PC.

116
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:33,120
Oh, right.

117
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:36,560
And that was doing the machine learning to help them find a safe place to land.

118
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:37,560
Wow.

119
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:42,620
Yeah, he kind of begrudgingly said, so I guess technically they were the first Linux on Mars,

120
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:45,360
but you know, we're going to be the ones flying Linux on Mars.

121
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:47,000
I think it might be a tie.

122
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:51,600
Well, either way, we know this, Mars just became the second planet that has more computers

123
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:53,280
running Linux than Windows.

124
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:55,740
So that's a bit of a milestone.

125
00:07:55,740 --> 00:08:00,600
As far as what happens next, the helicopter will remain snug in the rover's belly for

126
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:05,360
the next 30 to 60 days while they check on things and monitor data feeds.

127
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:10,980
Yeah, Tim shared that there are two big ticket items they'll be looking for in the data,

128
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:16,020
the state of charge of Ingenuity's batteries, as well as confirmation that the base station

129
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:21,280
is operating as designed and actually commanding the heaters to turn off and on in order to

130
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:26,240
keep our little Linux capture nice and in the expected temperature range.

131
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,240
Right.

132
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:31,000
And so far, we only have about 24 hours of data as we record, but everything seems to

133
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
be working great.

134
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,400
Tim says it's a positive report and they are moving forward with the next phase, which

135
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:38,160
is charging the helicopter's batteries.

136
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:42,680
Yeah, I mean, maintaining function and good battery health is kind of critical if the

137
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:47,800
helicopter is going to advance, survive through the frigid Martian climate and actually do

138
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:51,600
some test flights, which is what we're all hoping it's going to be able to do.

139
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:57,560
A total of five test flights are planned over a 31 day period once the rover finds the right

140
00:08:57,560 --> 00:09:02,500
helipad or a nice flat spot to deposit Ingenuity.

141
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:06,880
As long as Ingenuity is attached to Perseverance, though, the helicopter can give its batteries

142
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,360
a little boost.

143
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:14,100
The Linux Capture has six lithium ion batteries, but once it's detached from the rover, those

144
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:18,240
batteries will actually be charged by the helicopter's own cute little set of solar

145
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,640
panels.

146
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:24,540
Although the first flight of Ingenuity will be short, only about 20 seconds of hovering

147
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:29,200
off the ground to start with, it will be a historic moment.

148
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:35,360
I want to take a break and thank two of our sponsors for making this here production possible.

149
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:36,740
Let's start with Ting.

150
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:38,840
Go to linux.ting.com.

151
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:39,840
It's a new year.

152
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:42,720
They have new plans and it's the same great service.

153
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:47,760
You guys know I've been a customer forever, but I can confidently say now is the best

154
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:50,800
time ever to become a Ting customer.

155
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:55,400
Why pay so much for mobile when if you know what you're doing, you can save some serious

156
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:56,400
money.

157
00:09:56,400 --> 00:10:01,000
I'm talking like talk and text for 10 bucks a month, but if you need two gigs or you need

158
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,520
20 gigs, whatever it is, Ting now has the perfect plan for you.

159
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:05,520
And no need to worry.

160
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:07,940
What's changing is lower monthly phone bills.

161
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:12,840
You still get access to Ting's award-winning customer service with nationwide LTE and 5G

162
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:13,840
coverage.

163
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:19,120
I'm currently on Verizon, but they have three nationwide networks you can choose from now.

164
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:24,000
And the thing is when people switch to Ting, they love the savings and they love the top

165
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,100
rated customer support.

166
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:30,760
That's the number one and number two things I hear from our audience, but I love no contracts.

167
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:31,760
I just love it.

168
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:34,200
I just think that's the better way to have phone plans.

169
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:37,360
I hear from people outside the US, they tell me that's, I guess, the way they do it in

170
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:38,360
the rest of the world.

171
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:42,780
Well, Ting mobile customers get access to that kind of treatment and with three different

172
00:10:42,780 --> 00:10:47,100
providers to choose from, it's really simple to switch to Ting because just about every

173
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:48,760
phone is supported.

174
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:53,040
So get started by going to linux.ting.com to check your current phone, create an account

175
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:55,080
and pick the plan that's right for you.

176
00:10:55,080 --> 00:11:01,840
You'll get $25 in credit when you go to linux.ting.com and may pay for your first month of service

177
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:06,120
because generally Ting bills are below 25 bucks a month.

178
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:08,920
If your phone's compatible, Ting will send you a SIM card, you pop it in, you get going

179
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:11,000
in a few minutes or you can buy a phone from them.

180
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,680
They have a whole range.

181
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:13,680
So check it out.

182
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:15,920
The next generation of Ting mobile is here.

183
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:19,560
See how much you could save and get $25 off by going to linux.ting.com.

184
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:24,440
A new year, new plans, same great service.

185
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:29,280
Linux.ting.com and thank you to Ting for sponsoring Linux Action News.

186
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:30,940
Also thank you to Linode.

187
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:36,320
Go to linode.com slash LAN and get a $100 60-day credit towards your new account and

188
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:37,800
support the show.

189
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:39,760
Linode is our cloud server provider.

190
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:44,160
You should see the infrastructure we have spun up with JB 3.0 on Linode.

191
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:46,600
We take advantage of all of it.

192
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:51,000
We use their cloud dashboard to manage our systems, get a snapshot of their usage and

193
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,280
take advantage of their object storage.

194
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:56,600
But when I need to get files up on Linode really quick or reboot a system that we're

195
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:59,880
working on it, I actually leverage their command line application.

196
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:04,320
It uses their API, it's quick, it's easy and if you're a Linux user, I think you should

197
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:05,320
check it out.

198
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:10,720
Get started by going to linode.com slash LAN, sign up, get that $100 60-day credit and play

199
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:11,720
around.

200
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:12,720
See what you can do.

201
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:16,120
A lot of people ask us for a self-hosted Google Docs alternative.

202
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:20,560
Well what we use is HedgeMD, a real-time markdown collaborative editor.

203
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:25,640
And of course we host it on Linode and that's a great example of what you can use that linode.com

204
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:28,800
slash LAN $100 credit for.

205
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:34,640
Unpowered, self-hosted Google Docs extinguisher and you can run it on Linode in minutes.

206
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:37,400
Go check it out at linode.com slash LAN.

207
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:43,160
Go there, support the show and see the best virtualized Linux servers in the cloud.

208
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:47,940
Thanks to Linode for sponsoring Linux Action News and thanks to everybody who goes to linode.com

209
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:50,680
slash LAN.

210
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:56,360
Looking ahead with Linux 5.11 just released, here's a look at some of the highlights in

211
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:59,280
5.12 which just kicked off development.

212
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:02,560
Yeah, usually this first week is crazy busy.

213
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:06,300
It's like peak busyness for Linus Torvalds overseeing the kernel.

214
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:11,980
But it wasn't until last night as we record this that code actually started showing up

215
00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:14,600
in the 5.12 Git repository.

216
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:19,220
Linus himself was offline most of the week due to winter storms, preventing him from

217
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:22,520
pushing to the Git repository and interacting with the mailing list.

218
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:23,520
It was quiet.

219
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:29,040
Yeah, last week in Oregon, winter storm knocked out power to thousands and ended up interfering

220
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:31,920
with the start of the Linux 5.12 merge window.

221
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:32,920
Yikes.

222
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:38,180
It seems on Saturday evening though, Linus Torvalds is back online as pull requests have

223
00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:42,080
begun to be honored with new code now hitting the Git tree.

224
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:43,700
People go through their snark withdrawal.

225
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:49,440
You know, looking at what they're trying to get into 5.12, in a big way to me, it feels

226
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:54,480
like a lot of this was work that happened over the last year during the lockdown that

227
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:57,460
is now being realized in 5.12.

228
00:13:57,460 --> 00:14:02,740
And as the XFS maintainer Derek Wong said, a lot is going on this time.

229
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:07,800
And then he says, which seems about right for this drama filled year.

230
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:09,040
It sure does.

231
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:14,480
And there are some big changes on the horizon with Linux 5.12, including for ButterFS, which

232
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:19,880
is getting some nice performance improvements and a working zoned mode.

233
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:24,220
And of course, some nice improvements for XFS as well, particularly I noticed towards

234
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:26,640
being able to finally shrink that file system.

235
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:27,640
That'd be nice.

236
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:29,800
XFS and I have been through the trenches together.

237
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:31,060
It's good to see that.

238
00:14:31,060 --> 00:14:36,740
But for today, we want to dig into a big feature addition that has been in the making for quite

239
00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:40,200
some time, ID mapped mounts.

240
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:41,960
But what are ID mapped mounts?

241
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:48,200
Well, as kernel developer Christian Bauer says, simply put, different mounts can expose

242
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:52,520
the same file or directory with different ownership.

243
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:57,680
ID mapping mounts can handle a wide range of long standing use cases on Linux.

244
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:59,000
They sure can.

245
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:05,040
Things like making it possible to easily share files between multiple users or multiple machines,

246
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:07,080
especially in complicated scenarios.

247
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:12,640
For example, ID mapped mounts will be used in the implementation of portable home directories

248
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:17,420
in system D, home D, where you might want to allow users to move their home directory

249
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:22,280
to an external storage device and then use it on multiple machines.

250
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:26,840
It also makes it possible to share files from a host system with unprivileged containers

251
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:31,300
without having to do something like change ownership permanently with chown.

252
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:35,420
This technique of sharing things unprivileged with a container that's actually already used

253
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:36,420
on Chrome OS.

254
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:37,420
Yeah.

255
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:42,840
And you could totally see a big use case for this in the enterprise in the cloud.

256
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:45,360
And it sounds like system D is keen to that.

257
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:50,060
They're already looking to begin immediately making use of ID mapped mounts, as are some

258
00:15:50,060 --> 00:15:53,900
of the container runtime, such as container D, run C, and LexD.

259
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:59,000
And even where on the street is, the virtiofs team is looking at using it for virtual machines

260
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,500
as soon as possible.

261
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:05,500
This initial implementation comes with ports right now for FAT and Extended 4.

262
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:09,900
It looks like there's one for XFS that's mostly done and other file systems that are being

263
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:14,380
actively worked on by independent people and maintainers.

264
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:20,480
From the it's about damn time file, NVIDIA has produced code to support hardware accelerated

265
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:24,000
GL and Vulkan rendering with X-Wayland.

266
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,840
Like so many good things, this was spotted in a recent merge request and NVIDIA engineer

267
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:33,080
mentions in patch notes that with an impending driver update and these new patches, hardware

268
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:37,160
accelerated X-Wayland support should just start working.

269
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:42,800
Additionally, some new work was done to allow running X-Wayland on the integrated GPU of

270
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:48,720
a laptop, but having individual applications run on a dedicated NVIDIA GPU.

271
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:49,720
Love it.

272
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:50,720
I love this setup.

273
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:55,860
This is similar to how I'd use my eGPU and similar how others are doing GPU offloading

274
00:16:55,860 --> 00:16:57,640
in X11 today.

275
00:16:57,640 --> 00:16:59,820
Coming to Wayland, that's great.

276
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:04,420
This should work nicely too with hybrid graphics laptops that are using Wayland and I would

277
00:17:04,420 --> 00:17:08,840
expect to see this in the quote long-lived branch driver, which I think they've renamed

278
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:14,400
to the production branch now, either way it should be an NVIDIA driver 470.

279
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:19,720
Moving up the stack a bit, collaborative developer, Alexandros Francis sent in a new request for

280
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:26,120
common patch set that adds experimental Wayland support for running wine applications, which

281
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:32,200
would mean the ability to run Windows applications directly on top of your Wayland compositor,

282
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:34,600
no X-Wayland required.

283
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:40,920
It's exciting because it's really taking Windows applications under wine to full support on

284
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:45,160
a Wayland future desktop, but it is worth noting at this point in time, these remain

285
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:49,880
out of tree and it's not really clear when or if they will be mainlined.

286
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:55,760
And there's also a lack of clarity from upstream wine developers and code weavers on whether

287
00:17:55,760 --> 00:18:01,400
this code should first go through wine staging or what ultimately the acceptance requirements

288
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:05,160
will be for introducing Wayland support into wine.

289
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:10,480
But once this code is ready and these issues are worked out, it should be possible to run

290
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:13,160
Windows apps directly on Wayland.

291
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:14,520
You don't need X-Wayland at all.

292
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:15,520
That's great.

293
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:19,080
It's pretty remarkable how far wine has come and this would really take it to the next

294
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:20,080
level.

295
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:24,640
I wouldn't be surprised if we saw Wayland support by the wine 7.0 release sometime next

296
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:25,640
year.

297
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:30,480
But wine staging aside, it'll also be interesting to see if perhaps this Wayland support gets

298
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:36,200
picked up earlier by say something like Proton for Steam Play usage, if it actually ends

299
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:39,800
up leading to efficiency or performance benefits compared to having to go through something

300
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:40,800
like X-Wayland.

301
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:46,440
Well, aside from not being able to play any of these video games, Apple M1 users and OpenBSD

302
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:49,980
users have something in common this week.

303
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:52,440
Their operating system boots on the M1 hardware.

304
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:57,760
Yes, that's right, the OpenBSD hackers, vigilant hackers that they are, managed to get it up

305
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:01,920
and running on the new Apple hardware.

306
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:02,920
There's some hacks.

307
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:03,920
There is some hacks.

308
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:05,000
They still have to be fixed.

309
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:09,040
So don't expect this to be mainlined anytime soon.

310
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:11,520
But it's definitely getting there.

311
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:16,640
You could say it's one small step right now for OpenBSD, but a giant leap for open source

312
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:17,640
kind.

313
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:20,880
Yeah, but it's not quite a Linux copter on Mars.

314
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:23,320
No, Wes, but not much is.

315
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:27,440
We will keep an eye on that little Linux copter and let you know of any interesting developments

316
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:30,000
as well as everything else that happens in the world of Linux.

Jupiter Broadcasting's first swag item in more than two years is here, and it's a robe.

320
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:46,280
It's called the Coder, the Coder.shop.

321
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:48,720
Look and feel comfortable while kicking ass.

322
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,440
Life is better in a robe.

323
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:55,640
We'll be back next Monday with our weekly take on the latest Linux and open source news.

324
00:19:55,640 --> 00:20:21,200
Thanks for joining us and we will see you next week.
