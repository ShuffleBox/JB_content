00:00.000 --> 00:15.680
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, our weekly take on Linux and the open source world.

00:15.680 --> 00:20.560
This is episode 33, recorded on December 19th, 2017.

00:20.560 --> 00:21.560
I'm Chris.

00:21.560 --> 00:22.560
And I'm Joe.

00:22.560 --> 00:23.560
Hello, Joe.

00:23.560 --> 00:24.560
It's good to be with you.

00:24.560 --> 00:28.360
We are recording out of time, ahead of time this week for the holidays, and we've put

00:28.360 --> 00:30.580
together a holiday special.

00:30.580 --> 00:34.820
Look back at some of the big stories from 2017, the things that really changed Linux

00:34.820 --> 00:35.820
and open source.

00:35.820 --> 00:41.400
Yeah, so let's start with 32-bit support, and a number of distros dropped it this year.

00:41.400 --> 00:46.040
It seems that 2017 is at least the beginning of the end for 32-bit Linux.

00:46.040 --> 00:53.280
Yeah, it kicked off really, to my recollection, on January 23rd when Arch announced that they

00:53.280 --> 00:57.480
were beginning the process, they say due to decreasing popularity, which is what a lot

00:57.480 --> 01:00.440
of the distributions recently cited, like Tails and others.

01:00.440 --> 01:05.840
Yeah, Ubuntu 17.10, of course, there's no 32-bit desktop image for that, although there

01:05.840 --> 01:12.360
are still 32-bit packages in the archive and will be probably for quite a while.

01:12.360 --> 01:17.680
I think we've seen the tide turn in 2017 away from 32-bit.

01:17.680 --> 01:23.120
Because of containerization and things like that, it's not going to completely go away.

01:23.120 --> 01:27.960
But I think certainly in the desktop world, you have distros like Solus that never even

01:27.960 --> 01:35.480
bothered with 32-bit support, because realistically, the only machines that are still working and

01:35.480 --> 01:39.460
going to actually give you any sort of performance are netbooks, and even they are pretty old

01:39.460 --> 01:41.200
hat now.

01:41.200 --> 01:45.520
But everything else for the last 10 years-ish has been 64-bit capable.

01:45.520 --> 01:50.640
So it's time for 32-bit to die on the desktop, I think.

01:50.640 --> 01:51.640
I suppose so.

01:51.640 --> 01:52.640
We did see some pushback.

01:52.640 --> 01:56.440
In fact, I recall even you and I were talking about how I think you still have a 32-bit

01:56.440 --> 02:01.280
system in production or so that you still find perfectly useful and functional.

02:01.280 --> 02:04.480
So there's people out there that are still rocking 32-bit.

02:04.480 --> 02:10.760
But if you look at just the date math, I don't think Intel has shipped a non-64-bit chip

02:10.760 --> 02:14.680
in eight years, nine years for the desktop.

02:14.680 --> 02:17.200
Yeah, it's time.

02:17.200 --> 02:21.080
The system I had, I kind of remember why I had installed 32-bit.

02:21.080 --> 02:27.280
I think I had some issue with some application, and I just stuck with it through sheer stubbornness.

02:27.280 --> 02:31.360
But then I upgraded to a newer version of Ubuntu and just went 64-bit.

02:31.360 --> 02:34.420
And now I don't have any 32-bit systems at all.

02:34.420 --> 02:39.680
One of the other stories we watched unfold throughout the year was the slow and obvious

02:39.680 --> 02:41.600
failure of Limux.

02:41.600 --> 02:47.860
Yeah, in Munich in Germany, it was the poster child for open source and government, a project

02:47.860 --> 02:50.940
that was around for about 10 years.

02:50.940 --> 02:55.320
And this year, they voted to return to Windows and started to see that rollout happen now.

02:55.320 --> 03:00.360
And it's just the end of a chapter, the end of an experiment that went horribly wrong,

03:00.360 --> 03:01.360
unfortunately.

03:01.360 --> 03:06.780
But you know, Joe, when Munich closes a door, Microsoft opens a window, and those users

03:06.780 --> 03:11.620
that will be switching back to Windows 10 will at least be able to install Ubuntu or

03:11.620 --> 03:17.720
maybe even Fedora because this was the year where Ubuntu arrived in the Windows Store

03:17.720 --> 03:22.560
and SUSE and Fedora were announced to be there soon, the subsystem for Linux went out to

03:22.560 --> 03:24.700
all Windows 10 users.

03:24.700 --> 03:29.440
This was the year that this really took place, like it all clicked in and Microsoft delivered

03:29.440 --> 03:32.640
on this run bash on top of Windows reality.

03:32.640 --> 03:35.480
Yeah, it's kind of everything but Linux, isn't it?

03:35.480 --> 03:40.660
The kernel, it's open SSH now as well, as we talked about recently.

03:40.660 --> 03:46.360
It's Microsoft embracing open source, realizing where the market's going, and taking decisive

03:46.360 --> 03:50.880
action to not be left behind, which I'd rather they didn't, because I'd rather they were

03:50.880 --> 03:55.460
left behind and people moved over to Linux, but the market reality is they've decided

03:55.460 --> 04:00.960
to embrace this stuff, and it's probably going to eat into the potential converts over to

04:00.960 --> 04:01.960
Linux.

04:01.960 --> 04:06.660
Perhaps there's nothing like seeing Ubuntu in the Windows Store, you go into the Microsoft

04:06.660 --> 04:11.640
Windows Store, and you search for Ubuntu, and there's this big logo and screenshots,

04:11.640 --> 04:13.400
it's really quite the experience.

04:13.400 --> 04:18.340
But it's not the true Linux experience, so it may stop the bleeding, but I'm not super

04:18.340 --> 04:19.340
worried about it.

04:19.340 --> 04:23.200
In the meantime, I'm just too distracted by Bitcoin and all of the forks we saw this year.

04:23.200 --> 04:26.080
Yeah, it's been a funny old year for Bitcoin.

04:26.080 --> 04:32.200
Of course, now the value is about 20 times what it was at the beginning of the year.

04:32.200 --> 04:35.520
We did say we were recording this earlier, it could crash in the next few days before

04:35.520 --> 04:37.640
this is published, so let's hope that it is.

04:37.640 --> 04:39.680
I suppose it's always possible, right?

04:39.680 --> 04:44.960
But yeah, two hard forks appeared, and there was the threat of a third one.

04:44.960 --> 04:50.440
The first one was Bitcoin Cash, and then the second one, Bitcoin Gold.

04:50.440 --> 04:56.260
And to be honest, I haven't even really cashed in my Bitcoin Cash or Gold.

04:56.260 --> 05:00.200
To me, it seems not even really worth doing.

05:00.200 --> 05:01.200
What about you?

05:01.200 --> 05:03.440
Have you managed to get hold of yours and sort it out?

05:03.440 --> 05:09.200
I haven't really pursued it that far, because the whole Bitcoin fork fiascos just got me

05:09.200 --> 05:15.880
more interested in some of the cooler cryptocurrencies, like Monero and Dash, that to me may have

05:15.880 --> 05:19.720
longer-lasting usefulness on the internet than Bitcoin.

05:19.720 --> 05:24.120
So I don't know, it's funny, these forks got me less interested in Bitcoin and more interested

05:24.120 --> 05:27.400
in other cryptocurrencies, which I think is a good thing.

05:27.400 --> 05:28.880
I'm not sure, Joe.

05:28.880 --> 05:32.760
But at the same time, I was kind of expecting these forks to destabilize it and make the

05:32.760 --> 05:35.920
price go down, and it's just had the complete opposite effect.

05:35.920 --> 05:39.440
Whether or not that price would have gone up regardless, I don't know, but it's almost

05:39.440 --> 05:46.760
legitimized it as the Coke or the Pepsi, whatever, the name you know in cryptocurrencies.

05:46.760 --> 05:51.160
Yeah, I should save this rest for a predictions episode in the future.

05:51.160 --> 05:56.440
But I really have been struck by everything that turns out initially to be negative news

05:56.440 --> 06:01.000
for Bitcoin eventually just led to the rise of the price of Bitcoin, Joe.

06:01.000 --> 06:02.840
So it's pretty nuts to watch all of this stuff.

06:02.840 --> 06:05.600
And these forks still are going.

06:05.600 --> 06:09.400
I see people talking about them online, so it's not like they're dead.

06:09.400 --> 06:14.840
And it's a good space to trial and error different approaches to these technologies.

06:14.840 --> 06:20.400
So it seems to have been a net positive, just like some people speculate there's too many

06:20.400 --> 06:25.140
Linux distributions and other people say it's a natural evolutionary course where all these

06:25.140 --> 06:27.080
different ideas get to be tried out.

06:27.080 --> 06:30.320
I think it's a one-to-one comparison to cryptocurrencies.

06:30.320 --> 06:34.360
Yeah, I think that's a reasonable way to look at it.

06:34.360 --> 06:38.200
If you look at these two forks, they weren't just for a laugh, were they?

06:38.200 --> 06:43.840
They were there to solve a particular technical problem, and that is there is not enough space

06:43.840 --> 06:44.840
in each block.

06:44.840 --> 06:49.600
There are not enough transactions per block, and that is eventually going to cause a huge

06:49.600 --> 06:50.600
problem.

06:50.600 --> 06:54.560
We've already got transaction fees through the roof unless you want to wait for a very

06:54.560 --> 06:57.960
long time for your transaction to be processed.

06:57.960 --> 07:04.140
And so there are very sound technical reasons why these forks happened, but it just seems

07:04.140 --> 07:11.120
that unless Bitcoin itself adopts these changes, these changes are not going to actually be

07:11.120 --> 07:14.240
implemented and it's not going to solve the problem.

07:14.240 --> 07:18.040
Because Bitcoin is the name you know, and I suppose the people who made these forks

07:18.040 --> 07:24.400
hoped that Bitcoin Cash would take over, but it hasn't happened yet and I just can't see

07:24.400 --> 07:25.400
it happening.

07:25.400 --> 07:26.400
Right.

07:26.400 --> 07:30.440
The good news is all this stuff is open source, so it could be brought back in upstream if

07:30.440 --> 07:33.520
there was some significant technological improvement.

07:33.520 --> 07:38.200
I'm getting to the point though where I wonder if this stuff isn't going to be solved at

07:38.200 --> 07:39.200
another layer.

07:39.200 --> 07:44.560
Not to go too far into this, but you picture the blockchain and Bitcoin as like layer one

07:44.560 --> 07:49.360
and two of the network stack, and there's application layers that could sit on top of

07:49.360 --> 07:53.180
that, SQL databases that can process transactions instantly.

07:53.180 --> 07:59.600
If you think about Coinbase, one of the largest, most popular ways to buy Bitcoin right now,

07:59.600 --> 08:05.760
those transactions are happening off the blockchain, inside a SQL database instantly, and then

08:05.760 --> 08:08.000
they sync up to the blockchain.

08:08.000 --> 08:12.800
When you go to a store and you buy something with your credit card here in the States,

08:12.800 --> 08:16.600
the Visa network isn't instantly verifying the transaction.

08:16.600 --> 08:24.080
They have a 30 day lag, but they solve it at the application layer.

08:24.080 --> 08:26.200
And I think that might be true with Bitcoin too.

08:26.200 --> 08:32.240
You could build transaction software, your Stripe type services on top of Bitcoin that

08:32.240 --> 08:38.840
use off-blockchain backends, like SQL databases, and then synchronize it to the blockchain

08:38.840 --> 08:42.200
like Coinbase does or other large Bitcoin exchanges do already.

08:42.200 --> 08:46.440
Yeah, I think that is pretty much going to happen, and that's why I think the value is

08:46.440 --> 08:51.000
going to continue to rise, and we'll get into that next week when we put some hard numbers

08:51.000 --> 08:56.840
on our predictions for Bitcoin.

08:56.840 --> 09:00.160
DigitalOcean.com and use our promo code, here's the thing.

09:00.160 --> 09:02.520
It's all one word, you create your account and then you apply it.

09:02.520 --> 09:06.120
DigitalOcean is a way for you to spin up a Linux system in seconds on their super fast

09:06.120 --> 09:09.520
infrastructure and they have data centers all over the world.

09:09.520 --> 09:15.640
Everything, every machine is using SSD disk, and that means everything flies because between

09:15.640 --> 09:21.480
all SSDs and 40 gigabit connections to the internet, these systems have unbelievable

09:21.480 --> 09:22.480
performance.

09:22.480 --> 09:27.440
For $5 a month, you could use our $10 credit and try out DigitalOcean two months for free.

09:27.440 --> 09:31.800
They have block storage and object storage, a simple API with tons of really good open

09:31.800 --> 09:36.000
source applications pre-built for you, and monitoring and alerting that it's built right

09:36.000 --> 09:37.500
into the service.

09:37.500 --> 09:43.000
With straightforward pricing and great documentation and an interface that will blow you away,

09:43.000 --> 09:45.320
there's really no reason not to try it.

09:45.320 --> 09:48.440
DigitalOcean.com and use our promo code, here's the thing.

09:48.440 --> 09:51.640
DigitalOcean.com, promo code, here's the thing.

09:51.640 --> 09:58.000
Okay, so by far the biggest news story in the Linux world this year was back in April

09:58.000 --> 10:05.160
when Mark Shotworth dropped the bombshell that Ubuntu was abandoning Unity, abandoning

10:05.160 --> 10:10.800
the phone, switching back to GNOME, and it was all changed for the Ubuntu project.

10:10.800 --> 10:14.960
This is the story of the year that affected me the most personally because unless I was

10:14.960 --> 10:18.160
a canonical employee, I couldn't have been more on the front lines.

10:18.160 --> 10:23.380
I was sitting at a large conference table with the folks at Dell that all were responsible

10:23.380 --> 10:25.680
for shipping Ubuntu machines.

10:25.680 --> 10:29.040
The moment, in fact, I was the one that broke the news to them.

10:29.040 --> 10:32.920
By the way, you're no longer going to be shipping Unity and you should have seen their faces.

10:32.920 --> 10:36.880
I mean, I couldn't have been in a better room other than Mark Shotworth's office, I suppose,

10:36.880 --> 10:43.320
and then I was in New York towards the completion of this journey, watching the team come together,

10:43.320 --> 10:47.680
the remaining staff, and the final push towards 1710.

10:47.680 --> 10:54.840
So I saw both ends of bewilderment and the homestretch completion, and it really caused

10:54.840 --> 10:58.740
a lot of reflection in the whole community, I felt, Joe.

10:58.740 --> 11:00.920
People were asking, where is this going?

11:00.920 --> 11:02.020
What does this mean for GNOME?

11:02.020 --> 11:06.060
What does this mean for the Plasma desktop now that all these companies are in on GNOME?

11:06.060 --> 11:07.320
Is there going to be a huge fork?

11:07.320 --> 11:09.200
Is there going to be controversy and fights?

11:09.200 --> 11:12.000
There were so many questions, but so few answers.

11:12.000 --> 11:16.440
Yeah, there was a lot of confusion early on in April and May, but then Canonical really

11:16.440 --> 11:23.080
upped their communication game, didn't they, with DDA blogging, the desktop progress, and

11:23.080 --> 11:26.480
of course the Ubuntu rally that you went to in New York.

11:26.480 --> 11:32.960
And a lot of the questions were answered over the six months after the announcement, and

11:32.960 --> 11:37.500
for me, I think they were answered in a very positive way.

11:37.500 --> 11:40.720
If you look at Ubuntu 1710, it is a solid release.

11:40.720 --> 11:42.040
It wasn't just stock GNOME.

11:42.040 --> 11:43.720
It isn't just them abandoning the desktop.

11:43.720 --> 11:47.540
They did work on it and refine it and make it their own.

11:47.540 --> 11:54.640
So I think a lot of the doubters, myself included, were kind of silenced, really, by the work

11:54.640 --> 12:00.500
that they actually did on it and the release that came out that wasn't what I had expected

12:00.500 --> 12:02.440
when I read that announcement, put it that way.

12:02.440 --> 12:08.520
And I think they've really set the table for the 1804 release next year, and I think it's

12:08.520 --> 12:15.420
going to be, I hope, a pretty polished release of the Linux desktop and maybe the one I eventually

12:15.420 --> 12:16.700
switch to.

12:16.700 --> 12:21.660
I'm thinking the future is bright for all of us who have been looking for a great workstation

12:21.660 --> 12:24.440
operating system to settle down on.

12:24.440 --> 12:28.000
More and more really good options are coming along, and I think 1804 is going to be one

12:28.000 --> 12:29.000
of the better ones.

12:29.000 --> 12:33.800
Just wait for one of my predictions on the next episode, and you might end up using something

12:33.800 --> 12:34.800
I'm going to predict.

12:34.800 --> 12:36.240
Very good, sir.

12:36.240 --> 12:40.200
In the meantime, there's been one story this year that you've kind of been my go-to guy

12:40.200 --> 12:42.440
on, what does all of this mean?

12:42.440 --> 12:44.760
And it's all of the hoopla around Cyanogenmod.

12:44.760 --> 12:50.600
Yeah, so this was technically around this time last year that it started.

12:50.600 --> 12:53.840
There had been problems with Cyanogenmod for a long time.

12:53.840 --> 12:59.640
I'd noticed in, I think, September of last year that I hadn't had any snapshot updates

12:59.640 --> 13:05.020
for Cyanogenmod for a few months, and the writing seemed to be on the wall for them.

13:05.020 --> 13:10.680
And then it was right around Christmas that Cyanogenmod's servers got turned off, and

13:10.680 --> 13:13.520
a fork appeared, and it became LineageOS.

13:13.520 --> 13:18.480
And a lot of the original people who were involved with Cyanogenmod jumped ship over

13:18.480 --> 13:23.000
to LineageOS, and I had really high hopes for it at the beginning of the year.

13:23.000 --> 13:28.140
I was really hoping that they were going to deliver on a number of devices and keep supporting

13:28.140 --> 13:31.120
them with OTAs, and they did.

13:31.120 --> 13:33.100
My hopes came true.

13:33.100 --> 13:36.000
It's been solid all year long.

13:36.000 --> 13:43.920
They're now working on their next version based on Android 8, actually 8.1, and it's

13:43.920 --> 13:44.920
been solid.

13:44.920 --> 13:49.680
I've been using it all year long on various different Android devices.

13:49.680 --> 13:51.920
It's really just a continuation of Cyanogenmod.

13:51.920 --> 13:57.080
There have been a few little tweaks here and there, but fundamentally, you've got the same

13:57.080 --> 14:01.400
open source ROM without all the Google bloat.

14:01.400 --> 14:05.200
But if, like me, you want to add a bit of that Google bloat back in, you can.

14:05.200 --> 14:08.600
But if not, you've got a mostly open source mobile operating system to use.

14:08.600 --> 14:10.520
I knew it was going to happen like this.

14:10.520 --> 14:16.060
I just know myself at this point, but when they announced LineageOS, I hated the name.

14:16.060 --> 14:17.060
I just hated it.

14:17.060 --> 14:19.560
And now here we are in December, I don't mind it at all.

14:19.560 --> 14:20.560
No problem.

14:20.560 --> 14:21.560
I've totally gotten used to the name.

14:21.560 --> 14:26.480
In fact, I'm really excited about the project, very happy that, like you said, it's going

14:26.480 --> 14:27.900
in the right direction.

14:27.900 --> 14:33.920
But intellectually, I've been finding what's going on over at Yolo almost more interesting.

14:33.920 --> 14:41.240
I'm going to end up using LineageOS, but I've been finding that I enjoy the Sailfish X saga

14:41.240 --> 14:42.240
much more.

14:42.240 --> 14:47.720
Yeah, so Sailfish wasn't looking too good at the beginning of the year, whereas it's

14:47.720 --> 14:53.120
had a reasonable year actually with this Sailfish X project, as you mentioned, that is on the

14:53.120 --> 14:58.800
Xperia X phone, which is a ROM you can buy from Yolo.

14:58.800 --> 15:01.840
And financially, they're still not in great shape.

15:01.840 --> 15:07.520
They still owe quite a lot of people for the tablets that they crowdfunded and never delivered.

15:07.520 --> 15:09.760
But they have got a revenue stream now.

15:09.760 --> 15:14.600
They are developing Sailfish and I want them to succeed.

15:14.600 --> 15:21.400
I want them to be more open source, don't get me wrong, but I want there to be at least

15:21.400 --> 15:26.400
another operating system for phones that is usable.

15:26.400 --> 15:30.680
I heard that sentiment over and over again from the audience over the year, but probably

15:30.680 --> 15:34.760
the most poignant moment was when I was in New York, I was talking to a couple of canonical

15:34.760 --> 15:39.480
developers who really liked the idea of having a revenue stream to just fund this type of

15:39.480 --> 15:43.320
development because they've been through that mobile process now.

15:43.320 --> 15:46.800
And I think they ended up ordering the Sailfish X phone.

15:46.800 --> 15:52.040
What was it, Joe, is it the Sony Xperia that you could install it on?

15:52.040 --> 15:56.760
And I think they ended up pre-purchasing that phone in anticipation of all of this.

15:56.760 --> 16:01.480
And you could see they have palatable excitement about something that's an alternative to Android.

16:01.480 --> 16:06.720
Yeah, the Xperia X is the phone, yeah, and I have used Sailfish on various other devices

16:06.720 --> 16:12.880
and I must say that of all of the Linux-based alternative mobile operating systems, it's

16:12.880 --> 16:13.880
the best.

16:13.880 --> 16:19.080
It sounds fairly good, but Sailfish is really solid from what I've seen of it.

16:19.080 --> 16:20.320
I completely agree.

16:20.320 --> 16:24.640
I really enjoyed it for the limited amount of time that I did run it.

16:24.640 --> 16:30.080
The situation on Android could be improving in the near future, the next few years.

16:30.080 --> 16:37.720
This year, Google announced Project Treble, the modular base for Android that may actually

16:37.720 --> 16:43.920
allow updates to be sent out to consumers to keep them protected, to keep their operating

16:43.920 --> 16:44.920
system up to date.

16:44.920 --> 16:50.200
It essentially broke out the low-level system architecture of Android and the upper levels.

16:50.200 --> 16:57.560
Yeah, so it means that there's a lot less work for the OEMs to put in to keep the ROMs

16:57.560 --> 17:01.120
up to date and to keep the versions of Android up to date.

17:01.120 --> 17:08.680
And so in theory, if they deploy this properly, it means that you won't have months and months

17:08.680 --> 17:15.000
and months of lag between updates and often with some devices that you buy, there's just

17:15.000 --> 17:21.060
no updates or you might get one maybe and then you get these huge security vulnerabilities

17:21.060 --> 17:24.220
coming out and then they're just not patched against that.

17:24.220 --> 17:29.840
So in theory, and I keep saying that because it takes work from the OEMs in the first place

17:29.840 --> 17:35.760
to implement this, but in theory, this is really good news going forwards and not only

17:35.760 --> 17:41.840
actually for people who want to use the official ROM that comes with the phone, it also makes

17:41.840 --> 17:46.480
custom ROM development far easier because there's just less work involved importing

17:46.480 --> 17:48.720
ROMs to the device.

17:48.720 --> 17:53.680
But if this doesn't solve your Android woes, then maybe the Librem 5 will because this

17:53.680 --> 18:01.920
year on October 11th, 14 days ahead of the deadline, the Librem 5 was fully funded.

18:01.920 --> 18:08.760
They reached $1.5 million in crowdfunding for a fully free open source phone with hardware

18:08.760 --> 18:09.760
kill switches.

18:09.760 --> 18:13.440
Yeah, and I said at the time we need to hire their PR department because they did a brilliant

18:13.440 --> 18:15.120
job of promoting this, didn't they?

18:15.120 --> 18:18.240
I think they did the best I've ever seen in the open source community.

18:18.240 --> 18:22.000
It should be a case study for other projects that want to do a hardware software combo.

18:22.000 --> 18:26.720
If you recall, Joe, towards the end of it too, a couple of big whales came in, which

18:26.720 --> 18:28.320
that's not necessarily reproducible.

18:28.320 --> 18:32.440
Well, yeah, eventually it got pushed over 2 million, didn't it?

18:32.440 --> 18:36.560
Thanks to those big whales, as you say, which we still don't know who that was, but maybe

18:36.560 --> 18:37.880
we'll find out next year.

18:37.880 --> 18:39.720
Yeah, we'll keep following the Librem 5.

18:39.720 --> 18:43.940
I'm very interested in that development and I'm sure there'll be more news throughout

18:43.940 --> 18:47.540
2018, but let's talk about Firefox OS for a moment.

18:47.540 --> 18:50.880
The news wasn't so good in 2017 for Firefox OS.

18:50.880 --> 18:55.280
Yeah, we kind of saw this one coming that there hadn't been any devices for a while

18:55.280 --> 19:00.420
and there weren't any plans for any, but officially this year Mozilla shut down the Connected

19:00.420 --> 19:06.280
Devices Group, which was the department within Mozilla responsible for Firefox OS.

19:06.280 --> 19:10.520
So it officially died, but thankfully Mozilla had plenty of other things that they got up

19:10.520 --> 19:11.520
to this year.

19:11.520 --> 19:16.120
Yeah, it was a bit of a controversial year for them, kicking it off with acquiring Pocket.

19:16.120 --> 19:20.400
Yeah, and this came off the back of installing Pocket by default, which ruffled a lot of

19:20.400 --> 19:21.400
feathers.

19:21.400 --> 19:25.120
I actually use Pocket all the time for this show and others.

19:25.120 --> 19:30.880
It is a very useful service, but I don't know about bundling it by default.

19:30.880 --> 19:34.880
But when they acquired Pocket, they promised to open source it and I was really excited

19:34.880 --> 19:38.840
about that because an open source client, fantastic.

19:38.840 --> 19:41.720
More importantly, an open source server so I can roll my own.

19:41.720 --> 19:46.000
That would be exactly what I want because I don't want the adverts.

19:46.000 --> 19:50.920
I want to be able to potentially have some bloat stripped out of it.

19:50.920 --> 19:56.640
It'd be great to have it on a droplet running and have complete control over it.

19:56.640 --> 19:59.280
So come on, Mozilla, what's happening with open sourcing that?

19:59.280 --> 20:00.280
Get on with it, please.

20:00.280 --> 20:05.140
See, I actually thought you and I were going to have a disagreement about this.

20:05.140 --> 20:07.760
When the whole Pocket thing went down, I was a Chrome user.

20:07.760 --> 20:09.080
I was all in on Chrome.

20:09.080 --> 20:12.040
I was looking over from afar going, geez, these guys are really getting upset about

20:12.040 --> 20:13.040
this.

20:13.040 --> 20:17.080
So of course, I had Firefox installed, so I checked it out and I'm like, oh, Pocket,

20:17.080 --> 20:18.080
this is a lot like Instapaper.

20:18.080 --> 20:20.680
Well, I use the hell out of Instapaper.

20:20.680 --> 20:23.080
It seems like a feature you'd want built into your browser.

20:23.080 --> 20:26.760
And Apple has shipped it in Safari for a few years now.

20:26.760 --> 20:29.280
I'm pretty sure Internet Explorer has something similar.

20:29.280 --> 20:32.680
Really, I think Chrome's the only browser that doesn't have this functionality built

20:32.680 --> 20:33.680
in.

20:33.680 --> 20:37.560
So it got me thinking, well, if Mozilla had just built a Pocket competitor into Firefox,

20:37.560 --> 20:39.440
would people have been as upset?

20:39.440 --> 20:40.900
I don't think they would have.

20:40.900 --> 20:41.960
It is a great app.

20:41.960 --> 20:46.600
I think it's a pipe dream that the whole thing's going to be open sourced, especially the back

20:46.600 --> 20:47.600
end.

20:47.600 --> 20:51.840
Because one of the things that Mozilla touted when they purchased Pocket was this great

20:51.840 --> 20:56.960
human recommendation engine on the back end that's curating the best content of Pocket.

20:56.960 --> 21:01.720
And there's no way, there's no way they can ship that because that requires a staff.

21:01.720 --> 21:06.580
So they're either going to give you some sort of pared down Node.js server application or

21:06.580 --> 21:08.200
it's just never going to happen.

21:08.200 --> 21:09.200
That's an early prediction.

21:09.200 --> 21:12.200
That's a tease for our predictions episode, Joe.

21:12.200 --> 21:13.920
Well I'd be happy with a pared down version of it.

21:13.920 --> 21:17.600
I have no interest in any of the social stuff and the recommendation.

21:17.600 --> 21:20.680
I just want to be able to save links and view them offline.

21:20.680 --> 21:21.680
Thank you very much.

21:21.680 --> 21:22.680
Fair enough.

21:22.680 --> 21:25.820
I think one of their strategies that made a lot of sense to me personally this year

21:25.820 --> 21:28.480
was the introduction of Firefox Focus.

21:28.480 --> 21:31.880
This seems to be the way to go after mobile for Mozilla in my opinion.

21:31.880 --> 21:35.440
Yeah, I remember trying this out when it first came out and really being impressed with how

21:35.440 --> 21:36.440
fast it was.

21:36.440 --> 21:42.440
It was definitely the fastest browser I'd ever used on Android, but I remember thinking

21:42.440 --> 21:47.000
at the time that it could do with a few more features and those features have been forthcoming,

21:47.000 --> 21:49.400
but I wonder does that somewhat defeat the purpose of it?

21:49.400 --> 21:55.220
If you add too much in the way of features, does that make it not as fast and it's kind

21:55.220 --> 21:57.800
of focused on privacy as well.

21:57.800 --> 22:04.560
So I think it remains to be seen how this develops, but it's good that they have got

22:04.560 --> 22:09.400
a different approach because it seems that Firefox itself, the main version of the browser

22:09.400 --> 22:14.040
is not doing that well on Android compared with Chrome.

22:14.040 --> 22:18.480
So they have to try something to stay relevant in the mobile market and it's something that

22:18.480 --> 22:21.680
I'm definitely going to keep an eye on throughout 2018 I think.

22:21.680 --> 22:26.640
I've always enjoyed the ad tracker counter as a cool little demo to show people how creepy

22:26.640 --> 22:32.120
the internet is, but there is an area where Mozilla has had more success and that's Project

22:32.120 --> 22:33.120
Common Voice.

22:33.120 --> 22:38.080
What I love about Project Common Voice is it just feels like an initiative for the people

22:38.080 --> 22:44.200
to make something better on the web in general without a direct benefit from Mozilla.

22:44.200 --> 22:47.360
Yeah, this is them doing their public service, isn't it?

22:47.360 --> 22:51.760
Collating all of these people's voices, reading the various things that you have to do and

22:51.760 --> 22:57.280
also the data of people listening to the voices and confirming whether or not they've transcribed

22:57.280 --> 22:58.560
it properly.

22:58.560 --> 23:02.120
We need something like this if we're going to compete with what Amazon and Google and

23:02.120 --> 23:05.440
Apple have got going with their lady in a tube, as you call them.

23:05.440 --> 23:11.080
Yeah, and even just to offer basic speech recognition to websites and open source applications

23:11.080 --> 23:16.680
that can't afford nuances, multi-million dollar licensing agreement and all of the data exchange

23:16.680 --> 23:17.680
required.

23:17.680 --> 23:21.240
That's why I think this is one of Mozilla's power spots, like they're in the power stroke

23:21.240 --> 23:22.860
with this particular project.

23:22.860 --> 23:25.720
They also really nailed the Firefox Quantum release this year.

23:25.720 --> 23:30.760
Yeah, I've seen nothing but universal praise for this release and for me it's just something

23:30.760 --> 23:36.400
that got upgraded on Ubuntu and I was just using it as a matter of course, and it's definitely

23:36.400 --> 23:39.600
faster than the previous versions of Firefox.

23:39.600 --> 23:44.060
I think some people have a little bit over-egg the pudding on how much faster and better

23:44.060 --> 23:48.280
it is and they changed the layout a little bit, which I didn't like at first, but I've

23:48.280 --> 23:52.480
got used to now, but it is definitely a huge step forward for them.

23:52.480 --> 23:57.800
They need to stay competitive with Chrome if they've got any chance and I don't know,

23:57.800 --> 24:01.080
do you think they really have got any chance of winning back market share from Chrome at

24:01.080 --> 24:02.080
this point?

24:02.080 --> 24:05.100
I mean, I'm not sure they've won back market share from me.

24:05.100 --> 24:10.620
It's enough of a cumulative improvement that I find it launches faster, I find it loads

24:10.620 --> 24:16.300
web pages at least as fast, if not maybe slightly faster, and I would say maybe what it actually

24:16.300 --> 24:19.480
is is the order in which it loads the web page, I prefer.

24:19.480 --> 24:22.600
That's what we're getting down to now, is how the web page is rendered on my screen.

24:22.600 --> 24:26.360
I like the way Firefox is doing it better than the way Chrome is doing it now as it's

24:26.360 --> 24:31.240
loading, but it also seems to do it without putting as much of a drag on my system, which

24:31.240 --> 24:35.320
I also really like because it leaves resources available for other applications.

24:35.320 --> 24:39.800
I'm pretty happy with it and I'm one of those fools who likes the new UI because I've heard

24:39.800 --> 24:43.000
a lot of people complain about it, but I think it's pretty great.

24:43.000 --> 24:47.740
That and all the other improvements they've baked into it, it's become my daily driver.

24:47.740 --> 24:50.100
But they're not without their controversies this year too.

24:50.100 --> 24:54.800
In fact, going into 2018, I think Mozilla might be one of the companies that's embroiled

24:54.800 --> 24:56.600
in some of the biggest controversies.

24:56.600 --> 25:02.600
Yeah, the lawsuit with Yahoo, which stems from a deal that they did to become the default

25:02.600 --> 25:08.260
search provider, which would net them over a billion dollars, but had a clause in it

25:08.260 --> 25:13.320
that said, if Yahoo is sold, then Mozilla can walk away from the deal, keep the money

25:13.320 --> 25:15.360
and change the default search provider.

25:15.360 --> 25:19.280
Well, Yahoo was sold, as we know, to Verizon.

25:19.280 --> 25:24.200
They changed their default search back to Google and intend to keep the money.

25:24.200 --> 25:28.680
And Yahoo, or Oath as they become, and Yahoo Holdings, are having none of it.

25:28.680 --> 25:31.640
And they want their money back and they don't want to pay any more money.

25:31.640 --> 25:35.240
And so they're trying to weasel out of this deal.

25:35.240 --> 25:39.520
And neither of us are lawyers, but I'm fairly confident that Mozilla are going to get away

25:39.520 --> 25:42.040
with this and get to keep the money and keep making it rain.

25:42.040 --> 25:46.240
Yeah, if I was a betting man, I would bet this is going to work out OK for Mozilla.

25:46.240 --> 25:52.220
I'm not so sure how this whole Mr. Robot looking glass add-on situation is going to go.

25:52.220 --> 25:56.080
They're at least going to spend the first half of 2018 digging themselves out of this

25:56.080 --> 25:57.080
hole.

25:57.080 --> 25:59.720
Yeah, so much squandered goodwill.

25:59.720 --> 26:05.640
Just when they were coming off the high of Firefox 57 Quantum, they go and do this at

26:05.640 --> 26:10.320
the end of the year and push an extension to people's browsers without them even knowing

26:10.320 --> 26:11.320
about it.

26:11.320 --> 26:16.040
And it's some confusing thing about Mr. Robot that hardly anyone even knows about.

26:16.040 --> 26:18.140
I can't believe they've made this mistake.

26:18.140 --> 26:20.360
And I hope that people get fired over this.

26:20.360 --> 26:24.080
It's not good when people lose their jobs, but it's also not good when they damage the

26:24.080 --> 26:27.000
reputation of a major open source project.

26:27.000 --> 26:31.540
Yeah, I hope there's some reflection in the upper levels of Mozilla.

26:31.540 --> 26:35.040
It's been a good year overall for them, though, so hopefully they still have some goodwill

26:35.040 --> 26:36.040
to cash in.

26:36.040 --> 26:42.260
I debated dropping Firefox after the extension fiasco, but if I'm being honest, I think I

26:42.260 --> 26:45.760
still trust Mozilla more than I trust Chrome.

26:45.760 --> 26:51.040
And I like the advances in Firefox this last year, and I think they're on a good trajectory

26:51.040 --> 26:54.000
for 2018 with Firefox specifically.

26:54.000 --> 26:56.560
So I'm just going to keep an eye on it, and we'll keep reporting on what happens here

26:56.560 --> 26:57.560
on the show.

26:57.560 --> 27:02.480

27:06.000 --> 27:08.040
this week, our predictions.

27:08.040 --> 27:13.640
And not just predictions, but things we hope to see throughout 2018 in the world of Linux.

27:13.640 --> 27:14.800
That'll be in next week's episode.

27:14.800 --> 27:19.080

27:27.000 --> 27:28.760
I'm at Chris LAS.

27:28.760 --> 27:30.400
I'm at Joe Ressington.

27:30.400 --> 27:33.300
Happy holidays, everyone, and thank you for joining us.
