00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,260
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, our weekly take on Linux and the open source world.

2
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:20,920
This is episode 31, recorded on December 10th, 2017.

3
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:21,920
I'm Chris.

4
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:22,920
And I'm Joe.

5
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:23,920
Hello, Joe.

6
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:26,220
Good to be connected with you once again.

7
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:32,040
But this first story brings a pretty big smile to my face, because anyone that's been listening

8
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:39,520
to you for about the last six months has heard you make inferences and jokes about a really

9
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:44,140
potential interesting situation brewing between Mozilla and Yahoo.

10
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:45,240
And that's where we start this week.

11
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:49,680
Yeah, so it's no longer Yahoo as it's called Yahoo Holdings and Oath.

12
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:53,880
But we're essentially talking about the company that was Yahoo.

13
00:00:53,880 --> 00:01:01,440
And back in 2014, they did a deal with Mozilla to become the default search in some countries,

14
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:03,380
America and Canada, I think.

15
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:12,880
And that was a very valuable deal at $375 million per year, up through to 2019, which

16
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:16,220
works out at a lot of money.

17
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:23,600
But part of that deal was a clause that said, if Yahoo is sold, and Mozilla is unhappy with

18
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:29,300
the person who buys them, then they can terminate the deal and go with another default search

19
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:32,000
provider, but they can keep all the money.

20
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Right.

21
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:38,360
And as we all know, Yahoo was sold to Verizon and Mozilla exercised that clause.

22
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:43,000
Yeah, and have now gone back to Google as a default search and are getting that Google

23
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,760
money coming in.

24
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:48,080
But they want to have their cake and eat it as per the deal.

25
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:53,500
But now Oath, which is a new name for Yahoo effectively, does not want to pay by the looks

26
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:54,500
of things.

27
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:57,140
And so it is getting legal.

28
00:01:57,140 --> 00:01:58,520
This has all been developing recently.

29
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:04,420
On December 1st, Yahoo Holdings and Oath filed a legal complaint against Mozilla, claiming

30
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:07,260
that they improperly terminated the agreement.

31
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:12,880
And then on December 5th, Mozilla filed a cross complaint seeking to ensure that their

32
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:17,520
rights under the contract that they had with Yahoo were enforced.

33
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:21,860
And Mozilla has taken to their blog and essentially said, we just had a good contract.

34
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:26,660
We did a good job writing this contract and we exercised a clause that was clearly spelled

35
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:29,640
out in said contract and we're pretty happy with it.

36
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:32,240
Well, this is all Marissa Mayer's fault.

37
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:38,000
She was in charge of Yahoo at the time and she oversaw this deal and it was happening

38
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:46,160
on her watch and she's now long since gone and I don't see who else to blame for it.

39
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:51,440
Honestly, Joe, this deal was made at the peak of the Marissa Mayer hype where there was

40
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:55,320
nothing Yahoo could do wrong because they had new leadership.

41
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:57,440
Why would they ever sell in this situation?

42
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:02,560
So they signed on the dotted line and Mozilla says the terms of the contract are clear and

43
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:04,880
they feel like they have a good legal standing here.

44
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:10,040
Well, the typical I'm not a lawyer, but from my understanding of it, I don't see how Mozilla

45
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:11,500
can lose this.

46
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:16,260
If they had a contract, they had a contract, but the way lawyers work, maybe they'll pick

47
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:21,220
that contract apart and find some thing that was illegal in it and maybe Mozilla will lose

48
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:27,680
out on this, well, it must be nearly a billion dollars, well, at least half a billion.

49
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:28,680
Perhaps.

50
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:33,080
I would bet these kinds of things are fairly common in business contracts.

51
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:35,440
So I bet there's a pretty solid defense behind it.

52
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:38,200
But you know, Mozilla has many things that they're working on at once.

53
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:39,920
So we'll stay tuned and find out.

54
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:46,140
But in the meantime, don't worry about fake news any longer, citizen, because Mozilla

55
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:47,140
has a solution.

56
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:50,600
Yeah, this is kind of a relatively small story, really.

57
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:58,420
They are putting up $40,000 as prize money for a few artists who can put together works

58
00:03:58,420 --> 00:04:05,160
for an exhibition in a museum in California that points out the problem of fake news and

59
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:07,640
what we can do about it.

60
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:09,600
It's kind of a token effort from them really.

61
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:14,600
For me, this falls under the category of things I wish Mozilla was not going anywhere close

62
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:15,600
to.

63
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:17,640
Fake news is a politically charged term.

64
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:20,800
And different people see fake news as different things.

65
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:25,520
A lot of people see fake news as just things that go against the narrative that they prefer.

66
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:31,040
And this post, it comes across as tone deaf to their audience.

67
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:36,480
I mean, think of the Mozilla enthusiast, somebody who is passionate about a free web, somebody

68
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:41,280
that wants to use an open source web browser, somebody that wants to further Mozilla's goals

69
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:45,100
in advocating a free web, right?

70
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:48,740
That could be like the core really fired up Mozilla audience member.

71
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:53,920
And in the post, they write, we live in strange times in which legitimate news organizations

72
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:59,240
such as CNN have to launch advertising campaigns to remind people of what real information

73
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:00,240
is.

74
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:06,980
Now, later on in the post, they talk about defending net neutrality and whatnot.

75
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:11,680
But that is a complete disconnect when they talk about defending CNN.

76
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:19,900
And just yesterday, CNN had to make a huge retraction on a really big story that they

77
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:21,120
messed up.

78
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,560
And you can point to one of these things every single day.

79
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:25,680
Now, some people call it fake news.

80
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,120
Some people just call it news.

81
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:29,720
And you have a different opinion of what fake news is.

82
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:36,680
And I just don't really see the long term positive side to Mozilla getting involved

83
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:40,120
with something that really comes down to often people's belief systems.

84
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:47,520
Yeah, I think they're taking fake news to mean deliberate misinformation, propaganda,

85
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:54,800
written by people who know it to be false, rather than journalistic mistakes, which happen

86
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:55,800
all the time.

87
00:05:55,800 --> 00:06:00,240
Because of perhaps sloppy journalism, you might not properly fact check things.

88
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:04,240
But to me, at least, there is a distinction there.

89
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:07,160
That to me is what it felt like they were getting at there.

90
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:08,160
That makes sense.

91
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,760
I like that interpretation of it.

92
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:13,920
I think the reason why I have a disconnect is because it's these statements, and these

93
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:20,720
pro net neutrality statements, and then they do these hand wavy mentions to mixed reality

94
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:25,940
art demonstrations that include 3D virtual content, which can be integrated with someone's

95
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:30,780
perception of the physical world around them, from simple enhancements of everyday experience

96
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:36,900
with augmented reality to completely synthesize immersive virtual reality worlds, all in variations

97
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:37,940
in between.

98
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:40,360
You can read more about it here, and they give you a link.

99
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:45,920
And that sounds like a bunch of hand wavy BS.

100
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:51,900
It is a subjective content, fake news, that's a subjective subject, with a subjective goal

101
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:54,080
that when I read it, doesn't even make any sense to me, really.

102
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,800
I don't get what they're going for here.

103
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:59,120
And then the prize is $40,000?

104
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:03,400
How about you give $40,000 to extension developers that have to completely rebuild their extensions

105
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:05,080
to make it work with Firefox Quantum?

106
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:06,080
I just don't get it, Joe.

107
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:07,080
I'm sorry.

108
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:10,720
I know it can be negative, but I simply don't see it as money well spent.

109
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,160
Well, I have to agree there.

110
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:16,600
There are far better things they could be spending their money on, like development

111
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:21,840
of Firefox itself, or maintaining Thunderbird, even, rather than...

112
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:26,480
Because you think about the $40,000 that's going into this for the prize money, how many

113
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:31,800
salaries are going into people working on the project and organizing it and everything?

114
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:35,960
They must be spending a lot more than that public $40,000.

115
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:40,200
But they are awash with cash, unless Yahoo wins.

116
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:42,200
So they've got to spend it on something.

117
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:47,080
And like you, I would rather they spend it on the core stuff, quite frankly.

118
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:51,080
They wrap up their post saying that the Reality Redraw Challenge, which is the name of the

119
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:55,640
challenge, is part of Mozilla's Information Trust Initiative, which was announced on August

120
00:07:55,640 --> 00:08:00,180
8th of this year to build a movement to fight misinformation online.

121
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:07,160
And in that umbrella term, they also envision the fight against net neutrality and other

122
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:08,320
web open standards.

123
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:12,540
Apparently, not the DRM extension stuff, but other standards that they view as part of

124
00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:19,240
this trust initiative to combat, perhaps, corporate narratives or interest narratives

125
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:21,440
online.

126
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:26,120
This just in a one in zero world seems like a good idea.

127
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:30,800
Where I personally have a little bit of issue with it is I just would like my tech companies

128
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:36,640
to focus on making the best tech possible and let other companies focus on some of these

129
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:37,640
politics.

130
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:38,640
Not all of them.

131
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:41,220
It's harder where you should draw the line.

132
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:46,320
But for me, it does feel like Mozilla getting into some sort of campaign to fight misinformation

133
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,720
online maybe crosses it.

134
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:52,640
I think there are a lot of people who would disagree, but I can't say that I'm one of

135
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:53,640
them.

136
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:54,640
All right.

137
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:59,400
Not strictly Linux, well, not Linux at all, but it is open source news.

138
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:05,360
Classic Shell has been abandoned, but it's been abandoned in the correct way.

139
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07,040
It is now open source.

140
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:11,760
So Classic Shell, of course, is software you can run on Windows to bring back a proper

141
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:12,760
start menu.

142
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:15,640
And none of this Windows 8 and 10 nonsense.

143
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:18,480
And it's been very, very popular, this software.

144
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:24,600
But the developer has said that he's had enough of trying to chase the changes that keep happening

145
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:28,640
in Windows 10 a couple of times a year and that he's had enough.

146
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:31,200
And so here you go, community, have it if you want it.

147
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:35,560
Released under an MIT license, seems like a fair enough deal to me.

148
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:38,680
And the thing I appreciate about this story is the developer is leaving the community

149
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:43,760
forums active and running on his servers at his cost for a period of time to give people

150
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:47,680
a place to temporarily organize to get this thing rolling again.

151
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:52,920
The reason I put this in, okay, it's not Linux-y, it's not that interesting, but what's interesting

152
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:55,640
is this is how to abandon software.

153
00:09:55,640 --> 00:10:01,040
And I would really like to see other proprietary software abandoned in this way so that it

154
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:06,320
is available to the community rather than just dying and going away and being locked

155
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:09,720
up as proprietary software that we can't do anything with.

156
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:11,040
This is actually a pretty useful tool.

157
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:12,140
And that's why I agree with you.

158
00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:15,840
It's great to see a useful tool that helps people work well with the machine.

159
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:18,040
You learn a way to use a computer.

160
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:19,920
You've been using it that way for 10, 15 years.

161
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:24,960
We have a lot of people that listen to this show that are using Windows as their daily

162
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:29,040
driver and they probably have their Windows box configured in a way that works really

163
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,040
well for them.

164
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:33,840
I recently tried out Windows 10 just for a few days as a quarter radio challenge about

165
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:34,840
two weeks ago.

166
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:36,040
You know, it's not bad.

167
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:37,040
I was impressed.

168
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:40,620
It did better than I expected, especially once you load the Windows subsystem, you put

169
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:44,760
a different terminal emulator on there, and I could see how adding something like this

170
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:47,060
would make people pretty productive.

171
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:50,740
And it's really nice that once you get sort of in a groove to not just have something

172
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:55,600
like this disappear, which is often the risk on these proprietary platforms.

173
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:59,060
So having this go open source means that people that have a good workflow that can get their

174
00:10:59,060 --> 00:11:02,400
job done are going to have a tool now that maybe the community will continue.

175
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:06,080
That's going to be the interesting thing because there's a few other tools that solve this

176
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:07,080
particular problem.

177
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:08,800
So I don't know how much demand there is.

178
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:11,720
So we'll have to just kind of wait and see where the community takes this thing.

179
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:16,040
Well, if I was forced to use Windows, I would want to use something like this and I would

180
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:22,400
far rather it be free and open source software.

181
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:24,680
Linux Academy dot com slash unplugged.

182
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:28,000
You go there to sign up for the Linux Academy platform.

183
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,360
It's a full featured training library with everything you need to learn new skills and

184
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:33,560
advance your career.

185
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:38,560
And you get a seven day free trial at Linux Academy dot com slash unplugged.

186
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:42,980
My favorite feature of Linux Academy is the hands on lab scenario based labs that spin

187
00:11:42,980 --> 00:11:46,540
up when you need them to give you experience on real servers.

188
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:52,100
The distribution in that VM matches the distribution you chose for your courseware.

189
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:57,720
And if it's a virtual server on their infrastructure or an AWS lesson, they handle all of that

190
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:00,000
with a really sophisticated back end.

191
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,360
And you get real world experience with this.

192
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:06,520
So when you go do something in production or you go take the test, you have that confidence

193
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:07,780
because you've done it.

194
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:11,800
And they have self paced in depth video courses on every Linux and cloud and DevOps topic.

195
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:15,680
And if you get stuck, you need a little help, don't worry.

196
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:20,040
They have full time human instructors that are happy to advise and answer questions that

197
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:21,040
you might have.

198
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:24,740
Course schedulers when you're busy, especially like around the holidays, if you got a couple

199
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:29,940
of kids like I do and you run your own business, the course scheduler is invaluable and they

200
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:30,940
work with you too.

201
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:34,680
And there's flashcards to help you study that are forked by the community like it's an open

202
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:35,680
source project.

203
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:38,360
And the community is stacked full of Jupiter broadcasting members.

207
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:53,220
Okay, let's talk about Bitcoin again.

208
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:58,040
We talked about it last week cracking the $10,000 barrier and it's been up nearly to

209
00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:00,820
20 and it's been back down to 1314.

210
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:06,680
I think it's about 15 ish now as we record, but not interested in that particularly.

211
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:11,760
I'm more interested in the U.K. and the EU planning to crack down on Bitcoin because

212
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:16,080
people are using it to launder money and fund terrorism and things.

213
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:17,080
Right.

214
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:21,620
And we we all know that if you live in the West, you're only allowed to use cash around

215
00:13:21,620 --> 00:13:28,680
the world to fund terrorism and launder money and only tax loopholes in certain islands.

216
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:33,280
But one of my lessons, Joe, and because when you look at the article, looks pretty bad.

217
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:37,020
But one of my lessons that I've learned in Bitcoin over the years as I watch different

218
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:42,640
governments go through this process is this is step one into legitimizing the Bitcoin

219
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:46,720
market for here in the states, I would say Wall Street.

220
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:49,040
So you have to have this in place.

221
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:53,400
This happened while I was recording Plan B years ago.

222
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:54,400
This happened here in the states.

223
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:55,680
This began to happen.

224
00:13:55,680 --> 00:14:01,240
And it was a necessary step because today, as we record this episode, some big Wall Street

225
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:04,400
banks are launching a futures market for Bitcoin.

226
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:07,720
They couldn't have done that without this step.

227
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:13,040
And the reality is there's plenty of other crypto out there for these particular use

228
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:14,040
cases.

229
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:15,120
You want to buy drugs.

230
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:17,040
You want to fund a little terrorism.

231
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:18,040
There's other cryptos.

232
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:20,240
Bitcoin isn't the crypto for you already.

233
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:21,240
It's already not.

234
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:22,920
It's Bitcoin is not anonymous.

235
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:24,060
It's not anonymous.

236
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:30,360
So this is a legitimizing of the marketplace that then allows businesses to build predictability

237
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:34,920
around Bitcoin in terms of how the government's going to react to them profiting it and how

238
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:36,100
they're going to tax them.

239
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:40,000
And once that predictability is in place, they start building products or offering services

240
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
around it.

241
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,540
It seems bad on the surface, but it typically leads to a marketplace.

242
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:48,020
So you don't think that it's bad that the government wants to try and get in and tax

243
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:52,160
it and regulate it and get their hands all over it?

244
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:53,160
No, I don't think so.

245
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:57,480
I think it makes it a practical commodities market now, in a sense.

246
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:59,140
I'm not saying you should do it.

247
00:14:59,140 --> 00:15:01,080
I'm not saying people should invest in Bitcoin.

248
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:05,720
But I'm saying people that are interested now have a legal framework to work within

249
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:10,080
where they can have gains and losses and report it to the government.

250
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:12,680
It sounds like you just want the price to keep getting driven up.

251
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:16,600
So the few bitcoins you've got keep getting more valuable.

252
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:17,600
I don't know about that.

253
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:20,920
I've sort of I don't personally hold any Bitcoin anymore.

254
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,920
JB has some, but not a lot.

255
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:26,560
It's sort of at the point now where it's not going to make a huge difference for us either

256
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:27,560
way.

257
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:31,920
But I'm kind of fired up about the blockchain concept and adding more and more value to

258
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:33,760
that to sort of validate that.

259
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:39,160
And I'm really passionate about the concept of money being divorced from the state and

260
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:43,620
having Internet money, essentially, even if it's just like a back end technology.

261
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:45,440
It's an implementation detail.

262
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:48,720
And the fact that it's open source and the fact that it's worth so much right now makes

263
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,960
it extremely fascinating.

264
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:54,940
And so I like to kind of I kind of like to watch these stories develop because I've seen

265
00:15:54,940 --> 00:15:56,240
a pattern now.

266
00:15:56,240 --> 00:16:00,620
We're hearing about it when it comes from the UK or it comes from the US.

267
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:06,320
But the reality is that a lot of other countries have already gone down the same exact path

268
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:07,800
and it's worked out for the better.

269
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:08,800
All right.

270
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:09,800
Fair enough.

271
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:15,380
Well, let's talk about Android Go, which is a confusing name because of Google's programming

272
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:16,520
language called Go.

273
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:19,180
But OK, let's ignore that.

274
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:24,560
And this is a version of Android for low end hardware, as in phones with a gigabyte of

275
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:26,760
RAM and under.

276
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:31,640
And they announced this back in May of this year, but now it's being released to the OEM

277
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:34,360
so they can start making these devices.

278
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:36,200
And to me, this is really exciting.

279
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:42,480
I'd like to see a lot of this stuff rolled into custom ROMs and maybe if Lineage, for

280
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:47,760
example, have the resources to make an open source version of it, I'd be very interested

281
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:51,000
in running it because Android is big and bloated.

282
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:56,560
And even on a flagship phone, albeit one from a couple of years ago, it's a little bit bloated.

283
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:59,840
So I would like to see this slimmed down version running.

284
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:05,160
And I just don't understand why Android main version can't run on a phone with under a

285
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:06,420
gigabyte of RAM.

286
00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:07,680
That was my takeaway too.

287
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:13,660
I saw this and I thought, if you could do all of this stuff for lower resources phones,

288
00:17:13,660 --> 00:17:17,800
why not do this for all the phones and the phones with more resources would just be even

289
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:19,500
faster.

290
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:20,640
It sort of boggles the mind.

291
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:24,080
So I'll give you a couple examples, some concrete examples.

292
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:28,320
They have a Google Go app, which, yes, this is Android Go.

293
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:31,940
And then it has a Google Go app, which is a renamed version of their search app.

294
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:35,080
It's like a light, smaller version.

295
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:39,760
And one of the things it does is it transcodes or recompresses all of the third party web

296
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:42,040
pages for faster loading.

297
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:46,920
So then they have a version of YouTube called YouTube Go, kind of the same general thing.

298
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:50,680
The YouTube app lets you download videos for offline viewing, even if you don't have a

299
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:51,680
red subscription.

300
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:52,920
Sounds pretty nice.

301
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:55,160
And here's another nice thing it can do.

302
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:59,680
It can share videos with nearby friends by transferring the actual YouTube video you

303
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:01,080
downloaded over Wi-Fi.

304
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:05,620
It creates an ad hoc network and transfers the video between YouTube apps when you have

305
00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:06,620
YouTube Go.

306
00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:08,560
Now, there are some limitations, like standard quality.

307
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:12,500
It doesn't go above 360p, I believe.

308
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:14,920
But boy, wouldn't I love that?

309
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:21,480
Wouldn't I love that, if I could download my videos here at work on my fast 100 megabit

310
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:26,940
Wi-Fi connection, then go home to my RV when I'm camping out in the boondocks and transfer

311
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:30,740
all of them to my Android TV YouTube app and watch them right there offline, that would

312
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:31,920
just be wonderful.

313
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:34,540
But I'm too privileged, apparently.

314
00:18:34,540 --> 00:18:39,100
Then the other thing, just sort of from a quantifiable standpoint, the YouTube app on

315
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:44,360
Android Go is 8.94 megabytes.

316
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:47,640
The YouTube app for standard Android, 25 megabytes.

317
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:51,920
Yeah, which means every time you have to update it, you have to pull down another 25 megabytes.

318
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:52,920
Right.

319
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:58,400
And the smaller Go apps are also using improved version of the Android runtime, a modification,

320
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:03,480
apparently, they call it the Go edition of the Android runtime, which uses 50% less space

321
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:07,120
than the Android 7 version comparison did.

322
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:12,000
And Google says that the average app is now 15% faster on devices running Android Oreo

323
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,440
Go edition.

324
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:15,300
And space is always at a premium, isn't it?

325
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:20,220
So that's more space for your apps and your downloads and your photos and videos and everything.

326
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:22,700
It just sounds like a brilliant idea.

327
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:27,960
And I really hope that I can get access to this somehow on my devices.

328
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:32,400
I would be surprised if this didn't trickle down to standard Android as well.

329
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:37,040
Why not have some of these gains and performance improvements and load time improvements on

330
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:39,100
standard Android if you can?

331
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:43,480
Perhaps this was the initiative that took Google to focus on this problem.

332
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:47,960
And then they can turn back and upstream that to the standard Google apps as well.

333
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:49,560
Yeah, hopefully.

334
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:54,580
And MediaTek have announced that they've got some SystemHonored chips that are purpose

335
00:19:54,580 --> 00:19:57,320
designed to work with Android Go edition.

336
00:19:57,320 --> 00:20:01,560
Yeah, it's even more than that, though, Joe, because it's like pre-certified.

337
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:04,600
It's essentially almost everything you need to build a phone.

338
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:07,320
You add the screen, you add your own software.

339
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:11,300
And they have three different iterations of SystemHonored chips, among others that they're

340
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:17,100
working on, that have support out of the box and are already certified for Android Oreo

341
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:22,000
Go edition, which means you cut weeks out of the certification process.

342
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:26,320
Now, there's still more certification has to happen because OEMs add their own crap

343
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:28,360
on top and then have to get it recertified.

344
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:33,000
But the fact that the SystemHonored chip and the main boards are good to go cuts a ton

345
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,160
of overhead out.

346
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:36,720
And this is all about the next billion, isn't it?

347
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,600
Yeah, it's about the next billion users.

348
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:41,960
And MediaTek is the big name that's working with Google.

349
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:46,560
MediaTek is kind of famous for making low-end cheap SystemHonored chips.

350
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:50,320
But Google's been working closely with them to try to get something that's cheap enough

351
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:55,860
and ready to go where a manufacturer can come along and produce really cheap Android devices.

352
00:20:55,860 --> 00:20:58,320
And yeah, get that next billion users.

353
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:03,420
Well, it's looking good for the future of ARM devices, but it's not looking too good

354
00:21:03,420 --> 00:21:06,960
for the present of x86 Intel devices, is it?

355
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:11,360
There's been a lot of talk recently about the Intel management engine, about different

356
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:14,560
OEMs that are taking provisions to try to disable it.

357
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:20,100
And now we have news about researchers that have discovered a flaw that not only could

358
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:24,280
exist after the management engine has been disabled by these OEMs because it exists in

359
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:30,060
a different layer, but could even potentially be exploited remotely depending on the particular

360
00:21:30,060 --> 00:21:31,060
type of attack.

361
00:21:31,060 --> 00:21:33,920
Yeah, this came out of Black Hat Europe this week.

362
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:40,340
And the idea that if you've got physical access to the machine, you can overwrite the updated

363
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:44,720
firmware with an older one and then exploit it, that's quite worrying.

364
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:51,080
And the fact that there's potential for remote exploits happening here is very worrying for

365
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:53,800
all of my machines that are running Intel processors.

366
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:59,040
Yeah, and the duo that showed this off at Black Hat also showed off the ability to completely

367
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:05,760
bypass what Intel calls the canary, which is a memory watcher that catches overflows

368
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:09,800
via change detection and then says, oh, somebody's trying to screw with me.

369
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:12,680
They've completely bypassed that detection technique.

370
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:18,400
And that allows them to run executable code running return-oriented programming according

371
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:19,400
to their presentation.

372
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:24,160
It went a little over my head, but what I grok from this was with a couple of island

373
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:25,940
hopping type exploits.

374
00:22:25,940 --> 00:22:30,260
They could eventually get remote control depending on the version of the management firmware

375
00:22:30,260 --> 00:22:34,960
and the exploits that are there, or if they could gain physical access and just reload

376
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:38,360
the previous versions that were vulnerable, which there's no protection mechanism against.

377
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:41,640
Yeah, and once they've got control of one machine, they can spread through the network

378
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:42,640
to others.

379
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:45,000
Now, I want to play devil's advocate for a moment.

380
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:50,600
I hear my sysadmin brothers and sisters out in the audience that are saying, but guys,

381
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:56,400
I have so many machines and the management engine does actually give me useful functionality

382
00:22:56,400 --> 00:23:03,140
that I care about, including some features that allow for remote system recovery, which

383
00:23:03,140 --> 00:23:09,720
can be a game changer, device inventory management, which can be really important and a huge time

384
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:11,680
saver for IT departments.

385
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:14,680
So it's not as if there's zero use for the management engine.

386
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:18,740
But what I think we're discovering is perhaps something like this shouldn't be integrated

387
00:23:18,740 --> 00:23:20,800
so deeply into the system.

388
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:26,260
Maybe it should be a PCI expansion card, or a USB dongle, or something that is added by

389
00:23:26,260 --> 00:23:28,740
the user that could even be open source.

390
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:31,060
I'd love to see an open source solution here.

391
00:23:31,060 --> 00:23:35,560
And if the community knows of something like this, please let me know at chrislas.

392
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:39,840
I would love to do a deep dive into that because it seems like with the management engine and

393
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:45,080
AMD's PSP getting a lot of attention recently, we need the open source community to step

394
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:46,080
up here.

395
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:48,960
So maybe AMD could come and eat Intel's lunch.

396
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:53,500
Yeah, and really take a market leader position and do this right, make it open source, engage

397
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:57,120
the community and just run away with it potentially.

398
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:59,000
This is the time to strike right now.

399
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:03,200
Well, we've been watching this Intel story develop for the last few months and no doubt

400
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:05,640
there's going to be further developments down the road.
