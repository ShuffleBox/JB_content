00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,600
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, episode 248 recorded on July 6, 2022.

2
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:10,800
I'm Chris.

3
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:11,800
And I'm Wes.

4
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:12,800
Hello, Wes.

5
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:14,080
Let's do the news.

6
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:16,560
Is it time to give up GitHub?

7
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:22,880
The Software Freedom Conservancy seems to think so and has launched the Give Up GitHub campaign,

8
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:29,400
writing on their blog, quote, those who forget history often inadvertently repeat it.

9
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:35,080
Some of us recall that 21 years ago, the most popular code hosting site, a fully free and

10
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:43,820
open source site called SourceForge, proprietorized all their code, never to make it FOSS again.

11
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:48,280
They go on to write that they're concerned about the size that GitHub has gotten.

12
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:55,540
And now they say GitHub has succeeded at convincing all of us to, quote, promote and even aid

13
00:00:55,540 --> 00:01:00,480
in the creation of a proprietary system that exploits FOSS.

14
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:07,040
They go on to say, quote, GitHub profits primarily from those who wish to use GitHub tools for

15
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:10,400
in-house proprietary software development.

16
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:15,700
Yet GitHub comes out again and again, seeming like a good actor, because they point to their

17
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:20,300
largesse in providing services to so many FOSS endeavors.

18
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:24,340
But we've learned from the many gratis offerings in big tech.

19
00:01:24,340 --> 00:01:28,360
If you aren't the customer, you're the product.

20
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:30,780
I mean, they're really coming in hot.

21
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:33,240
They're really using everything they've got full spread here.

22
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:38,580
And they say that FOSS developers have been for too long the proverbial frog that is slowly

23
00:01:38,580 --> 00:01:40,700
boiling in the water.

24
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:45,440
And they acknowledge that giving up GitHub will require work and sacrifice, but a strong

25
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:47,300
stance must be taken.

26
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:51,000
As such, the Conservancy is ending all of their uses of GitHub, they write.

27
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:56,120
And they've also announced a long term plan to assist FOSS projects to migrate away from

28
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:57,600
GitHub.

29
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:01,640
The Conservancy has also set up giveupgithub.org.

30
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:07,920
And the number one reason they list on that page is Copilot being a for profit product.

31
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:13,480
And this seems to be the crux of what currently has them upset, sort of the straw that broke

32
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:15,400
the FOSS lovers back here.

33
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:21,480
You see the core concern being that GitHub used copyleft license software to train Copilot

34
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:24,480
and is now reselling derived code from that.

35
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:29,760
And many of these free software licenses specifically have provisions for derived works.

36
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:33,760
And this is an issue that we've been tracking really closely on recent episodes of Coder

37
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:35,140
Radio.

38
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:39,660
There are also an additional five reasons listed on the site that range from Microsoft's

39
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:45,900
contract work with ICE, general concerns of SourceForge style failures, and ultimately

40
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:48,600
GitHub's ownership by Microsoft.

41
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:52,080
I mean, it's hard to disagree with almost all their points.

42
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:56,040
And even the ones I kind of disagree with, I can understand where they're coming from

43
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:57,040
on this.

44
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:59,440
So I want to make that clear.

45
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:03,740
But yet still, I can't help but feel like this is just yelling into the wind.

46
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:09,080
It just gives me strong free software foundation vibes here are relatively in comparison small

47
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:15,440
organization going up against a practically unstoppable market adoption wave being led

48
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:18,360
by one of the true gorillas in the tech industry.

49
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:22,240
And I'm not trying to sound like a nihilist here, but I just fear this approach is just

50
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:24,080
never going to move the needle.

51
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:31,520
Yeah, I mean, it's hard to disagree that this blog post this campaign, it's not going to

52
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:32,520
destroy GitHub, right?

53
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:34,960
I don't think any of us really expect that.

54
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:39,480
But at the same time, I mean, I think it's important to think about and I would be disappointed

55
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:44,560
if the Conservancy wasn't saying these things because even if, you know, even if it's not

56
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:49,360
going to change the behavior like we might hope, I think it's still valuable to be said,

57
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:53,360
because it's worth reflecting on what we get from GitHub, which it's very valuable.

58
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:56,500
I mean, it's done a lot of good for open source and FOSS projects.

59
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:57,860
It's been a point of collaboration.

60
00:03:57,860 --> 00:04:02,440
It's provided free resources to folks making software for the world.

61
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:07,840
But there's also been a lot of disappointments, I think, especially with some of the the copilot

62
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:13,460
issues lately, the lack of response from Microsoft or GitHub or seeming any willingness or interest

63
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:16,080
in engaging with the community's concerns here.

64
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:20,520
And then you compare that to some of the behavior from say, Amazon or others in the space, which

65
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:25,520
we may not love, definitely, but seem to at least be doing a better job here.

66
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:30,060
It's worth having high standards considering how much influence and money GitHub and Microsoft

67
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:36,320
have and at the end of the day, a lot of the stuff we rely on is backed by Git.

68
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:43,000
And so even if we may not want to consider moving, we at least still have the option.

69
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:50,800
Well, we've been saying it for years now, for RISC-V to really take off with the consumer,

70
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:55,140
it's going to need some developers and to reach that average developer, we're going

71
00:04:55,140 --> 00:04:59,680
to need a compelling system, maybe even a RISC-V based laptop.

72
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:03,720
Something that lets a developer build and test RISC-V apps at home, and then ship them

73
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,400
wherever they might need to go.

74
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:10,760
Well, a forum has now opened up where you can register your interest in the Roma laptop,

75
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:16,020
which is being called the industry's first native RISC-V development laptop, which is

76
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:21,580
going to be built in Shenzhen, China by two companies, Deep Computing and Excalibite.

77
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:26,200
As for the specs, at least at this stage, the Roma laptop will come with a quad core

78
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:33,120
RISC-V processor, a GPU and NPU accelerator for video and AI workloads, up to 16 gigs

79
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:40,240
of LPDDR4, more LPDDR4X memory, and up to 256 gigs of storage.

80
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:43,520
The estimated shipping date is sometime in September.

81
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:48,360
However, that's assuming the laptop CPUs become available in time.

82
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:51,280
I'm going to admit there's some red flaggies here already.

83
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:57,200
Number one, kind of shooting for a September shipping date when you don't even know when

84
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:59,880
the CPUs are going to be quite finished.

85
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:03,440
Red flag-ish when it comes to this kind of stuff.

86
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:07,400
Also calling what essentially seems to be a forum that gets you on a mailing list, a

87
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:10,720
pre-order, red flag-ish.

88
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:15,480
But what is a solid red flag on the field for me is they've had to like work in a whole

89
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:18,680
NFT angle to this laptop.

90
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:22,940
And not only does that feel unnecessary, but it seems to me like it taints something that

91
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:27,960
was pretty critical to the adoption of RISC-V in the overall ecosystem.

92
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:32,640
And they write in their press release announcing the pre-orders, quote, a Web3 friendly platform

93
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:39,400
with NFT creation and publication, plus integrated MetaMask style wallet, Roma will create even

94
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:46,400
more integrated experiences with future AR glasses and AI speakers operating entirely

95
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:50,200
on RISC-V software and powered by RISC-V.

96
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:56,240
Well, whatever else that is, it's definitely a lot of buzzwords.

97
00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:01,000
Deep Computing and Excalibite are even trying to entice people to pre-order Roma by offering

98
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:08,200
the first 100 buyers a, quote, unique NFT to mark the birth of the world's first RISC-V

99
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:09,200
laptop.

100
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:16,360
Also, those lucky 100 get their name or company's name engraved into their laptop.

101
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:17,360
I know, I know.

102
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:19,280
There are some red flags, I agree.

103
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:25,280
But we've been following RISC-V for a while now, so I had to put my, quote, unquote, pre-order

104
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:26,280
in.

105
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:29,120
Now, all I got was an email back saying, thank you for your interest.

106
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:31,920
We'll be in touch to talk more about specifics.

107
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:32,920
We'll see what happens.

108
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:33,920
Well, that's okay.

109
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:35,280
That's kind of fun.

110
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:38,160
I'm glad you did that so we can follow it.

111
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,480
I hope you get your NFT.

112
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:40,480
Right?

113
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:41,480
Okay.

114
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:45,360
I mean, the engraving name part, though, that actually sounds kind of cool.

115
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:47,840
I got to admit that that's appealing.

116
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:51,360
If only they could work in some sort of token to this whole thing, some sort of token that

117
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:55,440
you get and then you stake for equity in the RISC-V laptop.

118
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:56,440
I don't know.

119
00:07:56,440 --> 00:08:00,080
At the end of the day, I just think this NFT nonsense is just that.

120
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:03,080
It's kind of marketing buzz to get more attention.

121
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:05,480
I don't think it's really going to make a difference in the end product.

122
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:08,440
At least hopefully it doesn't make a difference in the end product.

123
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:11,320
It does signal a mixed focus to me.

124
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:15,240
And I think that's concerning because the core job of just building this laptop and

125
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:19,240
actually shipping it and getting it out there and processing the orders and everything,

126
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:23,860
especially with the supply chain in the current state that it is, that seems like a massive

127
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:27,900
task requiring 100% focus all on its own.

128
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:32,640
But I think regardless, this one seems like it's going to be a fun one to watch and see

129
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:38,440
where it goes.

130
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:43,760
Well if you're looking for a sure bet, System76 has announced their most recent update to

131
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:50,260
the Lumiere Pro with a 12th Gen Intel CPU that continues to support the Core Boot firmware.

132
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:54,000
It's great to see that Core Boot support survive multiple updates.

133
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,640
I think that's why this caught our attention this week is just to kind of acknowledge that

134
00:08:57,640 --> 00:09:00,560
is actually reaching an accomplishment there.

135
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:04,440
This Lumiere Pro features a 14.1 inch 1080p display.

136
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:07,460
It can go up to 40 gigabytes of DDR4 RAM.

137
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:14,480
It has dual M.2 SSD support, Wi-Fi 6, and a 73 watt hour battery that System76 is advertising

138
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:17,400
14 hours of battery life with.

139
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:20,840
Pricing starts out at $1149 USD.

140
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:31,300
More details on this shiny new Alder Lake laptop can be found at System76.com.

141
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:35,840
Well the story I'm personally most excited about this week is maybe only tempered by

142
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:41,040
just how frustrating it's taken this long for this conversation to finally happen.

143
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:46,640
This week, a change proposal was submitted to enable Raspberry Pi 4 support in Fedora

144
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:47,640
37.

145
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:51,200
Yes, yes please.

146
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:57,160
For a little background context, the Pi 4 came out in 2019 and Fedora has never officially

147
00:09:57,160 --> 00:10:00,000
supported a single board computer.

148
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,640
But it seems the situation might be changing thanks to some recent upstream work finally

149
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:05,640
coming together.

150
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:10,520
The Fedora team seems to have felt that it never really made sense to make the Pi 4 a

151
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:15,200
major target when there was just a bunch of missing graphics functionality in the upstream

152
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,200
drivers.

153
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:22,800
Yeah the ARM platform is a tricky moving target, but as time has gone on and the right code

154
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:27,880
has been upstream and the right kernel updates have come out and Mesa and those kernel updates

155
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:32,400
have come together, well the upstream open source graphics driver support really seems

156
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:39,080
to be getting in pretty good shape for OpenGL, Vulkan, wired networking, Wi-Fi and even possibly

157
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:41,640
audio looking pretty good these days.

158
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:46,440
As a result of all of that hard work, Peter Robinson submitted a change proposal for Fedora

159
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:51,040
37 that would polish up support for the Pi 4 platform.

160
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:55,940
Now this is an area Ubuntu has been far far ahead of Fedora and it seems like that's been

161
00:10:55,940 --> 00:10:57,920
a pretty big benefit for them.

162
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:03,520
Yeah I saw when we worked in the training area of tech, you saw lots of clusters of

163
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:08,260
Raspberry Pis for Kubernetes training and experimenting with different architectures

164
00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:10,440
and of course I've seen them in schools a lot.

165
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:15,920
It has helped define the Ubuntu Mate distribution, it's helped contribute to considerable market

166
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:22,080
share for Ubuntu Mate which just had a new release this week for the Raspberry Pi.

167
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:29,000
You know on the whole Fedora 37 itself as a release is shaping up to be a barn burner.

168
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:34,160
I mean we could have made all of Linux action news about this release of Fedora that's in

169
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:35,240
the works right now.

170
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:42,940
So we'll have some additional links in the show notes if you're interested.

171
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:47,180
Many in the Linux community were surprised this week when it became public that Lenart

172
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:51,520
Pottering quietly left Red Hat earlier this year.

173
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:55,720
Lenart has made enormous contributions to the Linux ecosystem over the past decade or

174
00:11:55,720 --> 00:12:01,880
so while being employed by Red Hat, particularly with his work on PulseAudio and of course

175
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:02,880
SystemD.

176
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:08,960
To put it simply, Lenart has been instrumental to what we now know as the modern day Linux

177
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:10,920
desktop.

178
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:16,120
He departed Red Hat for Microsoft and seemed to be continuing his work on SystemD with

179
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:19,440
commits made in just the last few days.

180
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:23,480
We'll follow up with any more details as we have them.

181
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:28,360
And for you job seekers out there, Michael Arnbool over at Ferronix notes that Microsoft's

182
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:38,240
careers page currently has over 600 open jobs that mention Linux.

183
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:40,040
Linode.com slash LAN.

184
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:44,320
Go there to support the show and get $100 in 60 day credit on a new account.

185
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:48,120
Linode is the Linux geeks cloud with 11 data centers worldwide and they've been hard at

186
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:54,480
this for nearly 19 years making the absolute best experience to run applications on Linux.

187
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:56,700
And they are so fast.

188
00:12:56,700 --> 00:13:00,880
They are, I was just having a chat in the matrix chat room today.

189
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:06,580
People have been testing infrastructure for video hosting and they tried the major hyperscalers

190
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:08,220
and they tried Linode.

191
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:12,760
And Linode is just screaming fast and I think part of it is because they are their own ISP

192
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:16,420
and they support things like MVMe disks if you want super fast IOPS.

193
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:19,760
They've got AMD epic processors if you want to go that route.

194
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:22,260
And they're always adding new features.

195
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:26,340
They've really learned to just keep improving over those 19 years.

196
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:27,800
I mean, it's just dang impressive.

197
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:31,360
Like they just rolled out Kali Linux now.

198
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:35,880
Linode now has support for Kali Linux as a one click install from their, what they call

199
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:38,380
their application marketplace.

200
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:39,620
It's pretty slick.

201
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:43,740
And as you probably already know, this is an excellent distribution that you can use

202
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:49,460
for penetration testing, ethical hacking, network security assessments, check your own

203
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:51,320
cloud infrastructure.

204
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:55,840
There was a period of time where I was looking at deploying something like a hosted Kali

205
00:13:55,840 --> 00:14:00,660
setup so that way we could do penetration testing on my client's networks.

206
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:06,060
To be able to test your own network from the outside from a super fast provider so you

207
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:11,460
can really get through these tests quick and to have it be on a blessed install by them,

208
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:13,340
it's a game changer.

209
00:14:13,340 --> 00:14:17,940
And Linode, they're the only alternative platform out there that offers anything like this.

210
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:22,100
They'll let you test your production environments, make sure things are working.

211
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:24,900
And then of course, when you're done, you keep the system or you destroy it.

212
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:26,100
I love that kind of flexibility.

213
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:29,820
It's a great way to do testing too, when you're starting a new project.

214
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:34,460
They also have the best customer support in the business, super fast rigs, a dashboard

215
00:14:34,460 --> 00:14:39,700
that's super simple, an API that's well documented, has tons of libraries ready to go.

216
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:42,940
There's so many great reasons, but put it over the top.

217
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:52,300
Go get that $100 in credit and support the show, linode.com slash LAN.

218
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:57,580
And a big thank you and a welcome aboard to Kalyde, Kalyde.com slash LAN.

219
00:14:57,580 --> 00:15:02,300
Kalyde is endpoint security solutions that use the most powerful untapped resource in

220
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:04,540
IT, end users.

221
00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:08,700
When you're trying to achieve security goals, whether for a third party audit or your own

222
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:14,020
compliance standards, the conventional wisdom is to treat every device like Fort Knox, old

223
00:15:14,020 --> 00:15:18,780
school device management tools like MDMs, force disruptive agents on employees' devices

224
00:15:18,780 --> 00:15:22,740
that slow performance and treat privacy as an afterthought.

225
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:27,340
Truly one of the things I hated most about having a work-provided machine.

226
00:15:27,340 --> 00:15:33,420
That's the old way of doing things and honestly I think it makes users hostile towards IT.

227
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:35,700
Well Kalyde does things differently.

228
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:41,300
Instead of forcing changes on users, Kalyde sends them security recommendations via Slack.

229
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:45,320
Kalyde will automatically notify your team when their devices are insecure and give them

230
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:49,120
step-by-step instructions on how to solve the problem.

231
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:53,220
By reaching out to employees via a friendly Slack DM and educating them about company

232
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:58,500
policies, Kalyde can help you build a culture in which everyone contributes to security

233
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:02,460
because everyone understands how and why to do it.

234
00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:06,980
For IT admins, Kalyde provides a single dashboard that lets you monitor the security of your

235
00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:12,760
entire fleet, whether you're running a Mac, Windows, or yeah, Linux.

236
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:17,060
You can see at a glance which employees have their disks encrypted, who has an up-to-date

237
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:19,860
OS, who has a password manager installed.

238
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:25,220
It makes it easy to prove compliance to your auditors, customers, and leadership.

239
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:26,220
So that's Kalyde.

240
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:30,980
It's user-centered, cross-platform, endpoint security for teams at Slack.

241
00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:33,980
You can meet your compliance goals by putting users first.

242
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:36,980
Visit Kalyde.com slash LAN to find out how.

243
00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:40,400
You follow that link, Kalyde.com slash LAN, they're going to hook you up with a goody

244
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:45,460
bag too, including free t-shirt just for activating that free trial.

245
00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:47,340
I love me a free t-shirt.

246
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:55,940
So that's Kalyde, K-O-L-I-D-E dot com slash LAN.

247
00:16:55,940 --> 00:17:01,580
One of the many changes in Ubuntu 22.04 that we were excited about was the enabling of

248
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:03,580
System D OOMD.

249
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:09,420
However, it now appears that this rollout has been causing a few problems.

250
00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:16,380
Yeah, the goal of System D OOMD is to monitor your system's memory, swap, and the pressure

251
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:21,140
stall information from the kernel and attempt to take corrective action in user space before

252
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:27,440
the much simpler and sometimes destructive system busting out of memory handling in the

253
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:30,140
Linux kernel itself has to kick in.

254
00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:31,860
That can be pretty brutal.

255
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:37,260
Unfortunately, it seems the configuration in 22.04, well, it's just a little too good

256
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:39,460
at killing processes.

257
00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:43,660
Yeah, various bug reports and issues have been turning up of user applications being

258
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:48,060
killed a little too frequently, especially things like Chrome.

259
00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:51,700
And to make matters worse, it appears that these terminations are happening without much

260
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:53,180
notice to the user.

261
00:17:53,180 --> 00:17:57,820
So they're not even aware that their system is under memory pressure in the first place.

262
00:17:57,820 --> 00:18:03,720
And I'm not really clear on how much of a facility there is to actually notify the user.

263
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:08,220
But as you can imagine, all of this has led to discussions in the Ubuntu community around

264
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:13,960
the best path forward to address this issue without totally losing the benefits of System

265
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:15,960
D OOMD.

266
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:19,800
Some of the options they considered is just, you know, adjusting the default swap setup

267
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:25,140
on the system, or altering some of the System D OOMD tunables that are available.

268
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:30,580
Or as you might expect, they've even considered just disabling it entirely.

269
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:35,260
The developers have also identified some longer term plans that should help improve the System

270
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:38,820
D OOMD experience on the desktop.

271
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:44,300
One of those ideas is to make use of the managed OOM preference option that's available in

272
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:46,420
System D service files.

273
00:18:46,420 --> 00:18:51,660
When this option is set to the value avoid, well, System D OOMD will try to avoid killing

274
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:56,500
that process and only terminate it if there are no other viable candidates that could

275
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:59,140
be killed instead.

276
00:18:59,140 --> 00:19:05,220
Now the hang up here is that in its current form, the managed OOM preference is only honored

277
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:11,420
for C groups and processes owned by root, which isn't often the case for many applications

278
00:19:11,420 --> 00:19:13,740
and services that we use on the desktop.

279
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:18,880
Yeah, and of course, it's the desktop realm where this is an issue right now.

280
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:24,700
Now Canonical Developer has opened up a early pull request upstream to System D to make

281
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:26,940
this work for all users in all C groups.

282
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:31,340
But while that will be good work, it's going to be a while before that trickles downstream

283
00:19:31,340 --> 00:19:36,780
to end users and there's users of 2204 today that are having this problem.

284
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:41,300
So for now, a bunch of developers have opted to simply tweak the configuration of System

285
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:46,860
D OOMD via an update to no longer kill processes based on swap usage.

286
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:52,380
It will, however, still rely on the pressure stall information from the kernel.

287
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:56,580
It's a tricky balance to get right, but hopefully this will provide some relief for a bunch

288
00:19:56,580 --> 00:20:00,780
of users and still get the advantages of something that's watching over their system and preventing

289
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:03,080
it from potentially locking up.

290
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:06,700
We'll keep an eye on how all of this goes, including the upstream development that Canonicals

291
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:10,120
Developer has submitted, and we'll let you know how it goes.

292
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:13,520
We'll keep an eye on where all of this goes, including Canonicals upstream efforts and

293
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:14,520
keep you posted.

294
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:17,220
So don't miss a single episode of Linux Action News.

295
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:28,040
Be sure you go to linuxactionnews.com.com.

296
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:31,540
We have a lot of projects going on here at Jupiter Broadcasting this summer, and we've

297
00:20:31,540 --> 00:20:35,600
been chatting with some developers that are taking podcasting to the next level.

298
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:39,900
Don't miss office hours at officehours.hair.

299
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:44,160
As for us, don't worry, we'll be back next week with our take on the latest Linux and

300
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:45,980
open source news.

301
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:46,980
Thanks for joining us.

302
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:48,700
That's all the news for this week.
