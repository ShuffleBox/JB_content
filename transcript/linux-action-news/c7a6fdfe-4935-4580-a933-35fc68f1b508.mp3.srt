00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,960
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, our weekly take on Linux and the open source world.

2
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:20,080
This is episode 45, recorded on March 18th, 2018.

3
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:21,080
I'm Chris.

4
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:22,080
And I'm Joe.

5
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:23,080
Hello, Joe.

6
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:25,120
It's good to be connected again and have you back.

7
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:31,640
And we start out this week's episode with a big new fancy GNOME release, version 3.28.

8
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:38,640
Yes, which you have celebrated by installing plasma yet again on some more machines.

9
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:39,640
You caught that, huh?

10
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:42,960
Yeah, you're not kind of very invested in this anymore, are you?

11
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,880
Well, I did go ahead and kick the tires.

12
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:51,960
I downloaded the latest OpenSUSE Tumbleweed that is an ISO pre-spun with GNOME 328 and

13
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:53,700
gave it a go for a few minutes.

14
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:55,280
It looks really nice.

15
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:59,840
There's a couple of features in here that I appreciate, some real nice improvements

16
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:05,520
to the way GNOME handles Thunderbolt 3, some improvements to the file manager that I like

17
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:06,880
a lot.

18
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:09,440
But overall, it's just another solid, steady release.

19
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:11,320
It didn't get me to switch back, I'd say.

20
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:14,320
But if I was a current GNOME user, I'd be pretty excited about 3.28.

21
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:21,040
Yeah, the feature that jumped out at me is Boxes, the new ability to download ISOs directly

22
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:22,040
from that.

23
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:27,800
This is their VM system, and you can install and test different Linux distros with one

24
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:29,680
click now, which is pretty sweet.

25
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:33,600
Yeah, they've also enabled some drag and drop file support for certain virtual machines,

26
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:36,520
so you can send files for the virtual machines by dragging it in the window.

27
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:42,520
But that whole download, the ISO automatically feature, probably is the number one thing

28
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:46,760
I want to try with the OpenSUSE Tumbleweed install that I haven't done yet.

29
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:54,920
In total, GNOME.3.8 incorporates 25,832 changes that were made by approximately 838 different

30
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:55,920
contributors.

31
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:56,920
It's pretty big.

32
00:01:56,920 --> 00:02:01,020
There's all kinds of updates throughout the system, from the calendars app to the media

33
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:02,480
playback support.

34
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:04,080
Many of these changes are in photos.

35
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:08,400
It has a new Import from Device feature, which makes it easy to add photos to your collection

36
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:13,720
from removable media, like an SD card or a USB drive, or maybe even your camera.

37
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:17,760
This feature automatically detects devices that contain new images, and it also allows

38
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:21,080
organizing new images into albums as they're imported.

39
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:24,720
There's lots of other little nice things in photos too, like new editing tools for shadows

40
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:27,880
and highlights, as well as just general performance improvements.

41
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:32,680
These tools, like videos, which now supports MJPEGs, music, which now has better reorder

42
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:38,560
support and playlists, and games, the application for retro console arcade games, all have also

43
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:39,840
gotten new features.

44
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:43,920
Yeah, and they are still doubling down on the touchscreen stuff, aren't they?

45
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:48,320
The onscreen keyboard's been rewritten and is looking pretty nice.

46
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:49,760
Yeah, it seems very usable.

47
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:52,520
It's not going to blow you away with anything different, but it's straightforward.

48
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:56,560
Oh, I guess also we should mention there's a new application usage.

49
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:00,720
This is a new application that's a bit of a technology preview now, but the initial

50
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:05,240
version's pretty functional with what it does have, which includes features for examining

51
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:10,480
your CPU and memory consumption, and it'll also highlight problem areas, make it easy

52
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:15,280
to quickly identify what process is consuming a ton of resources without having to understand

53
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:17,280
how to sort processes and all of that.

54
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:21,920
But my favorite feature is it also has a disk usage examiner.

55
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:25,720
I almost always install a tool to do this, a graphical tool to just go through my disk

56
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:30,400
and tell me what Dropbox folder is ridiculous or my Downloads folder is huge, and it now

57
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,720
has that built into usage.

58
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:36,520
Yeah, but I do wonder how is this different from GNOME's system monitor that we've had

59
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:37,520
for years?

60
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:41,760
I think besides using sort of new technology to render the graphs and all of that, it's

61
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:42,860
simpler.

62
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:44,760
It's more designed for human beings.

63
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:52,160
It's less of PS in a GTK app and more of a friendly front-end user tool.

64
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:53,160
Fair enough.

65
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:56,120
Well, I've just used that for years and never had any problems with it, but I do look forward

66
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:57,120
to checking this out.

67
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:00,460
I do think it looks decent, but I also don't have any problems with the current tool.

68
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:01,460
You get both.

69
00:04:01,460 --> 00:04:02,760
Anyway, GNOME system monitor.

70
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:04,600
Yeah, fair enough.

71
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:09,600
So there's been another release this week, Firefox 59, which is not as big a release

72
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:12,780
as 58, but it still has some new features, doesn't it?

73
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:13,840
This is a big release for me.

74
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,760
It's the one that made me stick with Firefox.

75
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:20,120
When 57 came out, I started looking ahead a little bit at the nightly builds, and I

76
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:23,760
saw what was coming down the pipe for 59, and I stayed.

77
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:30,340
First of all, it's way faster than 57 or 58 for my personal usage, and my favorite feature,

78
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:34,600
if you want it, it now has client-side decoration support, which you can turn on or off in the

79
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:35,920
customized appearance area.

80
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:39,920
Yeah, it's mostly just small changes this time around, but one interesting thing that

81
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:45,080
they've changed is for private browsing mode, where they are now removing the full path

82
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:48,800
from referrers, so that will prevent cross-site tracking, which is good.

83
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:53,980
Yeah, and if you're on one of those distributions that's using an ESR version of Firefox, there's

84
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:59,520
now an easier way to get the absolute latest version, version 59, as a snap.

85
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:03,160
Yeah, I was quite surprised to learn that Firefox is now available as a snap.

86
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:07,440
It seems like something that would have been available for quite a long time, but it comes

87
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:12,920
at the same time as Chromium as well, so now you can get both browsers as snaps.

88
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:19,600
These two snaps, Firefox and Chromium, will be more valuable as LTS releases and stable

89
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:23,720
distributions age, so say three years from now.

90
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:27,560
It's going to be really great that you might be able to have an ESR version of Firefox

91
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:32,120
as provided by your distribution's repository, and then when you need to test something perhaps

92
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:37,060
for work or you just like the newer browser, you can go grab the snap, and it won't mess

93
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:39,660
with your local distros packages at all.

94
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:40,660
You can have both.

95
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:44,480
Yeah, and it's kind of another step towards everything being a snap, isn't it?

96
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:48,560
We had kind of said at the beginning of the year and end of last year that this is going

97
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:53,080
to be the year of snaps, and it seems to be coming true pretty much all the major applications

98
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:54,840
now are available that way.

99
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:59,720
Snaps, flat packs, either way I'm a happy camper, and I would just really love to see

100
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:04,800
down the road Google step up and publish a snap directly themselves of Google Chrome.

101
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:07,320
You know, the one that can play like Netflix and stuff like that.

102
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:08,320
That would just be useful.

103
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:11,560
I don't know if I'd actually ever use these snaps myself.

104
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:15,260
I tend to run distributions that just have current packages, but I know there's a group

105
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:18,760
of users out there, especially on the corporate desktop, they're going to use the heck out

106
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:19,760
of these.

107
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:23,360
Yeah, I think Chrome makes a lot of sense as a snap because with it being proprietary,

108
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:28,880
the distributions can't distribute it, so there's always going to have to be a third

109
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:35,080
party way of installing it, and snap is just so trivial to install that you think that

110
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:36,080
they would do that.

111
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:39,720
Now, you would imagine that Canonical have been working with Google on that, and there's

112
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:44,740
probably some stuff going on behind the scenes, so it wouldn't surprise me if we had Chrome

113
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:47,440
very soon, but we'll have to see on that one.

114
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:50,920
Speaking of making your web browser run a bit faster, good news for those of you that

115
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:56,720
are crazy enough to run one on a Raspberry Pi, the 3B just got a little bit faster.

116
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:59,160
Yeah, the 3B Plus is now available.

117
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:05,520
The 3B is still available for people who have designed it into products or whatever, but

118
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:09,760
anyone who's using it as a desktop or just a general tinkering board will definitely

119
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:15,480
be wanting to buy this new one because it's got much faster network, both ethernet and

120
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:25,200
Wi-Fi, and it's got a slightly faster clock speed, improved boot from USB and pixie booting,

121
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:26,840
improved thermal management.

122
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:29,600
It's just generally an improvement over the 3B.

123
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:32,280
This is really the Raspberry Pi I've been waiting for.

124
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:34,080
So yeah, like Joe said, there's a slight increase.

125
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:40,280
It's a 200 megahertz increase in peak CPU frequency, but the big improvement here is

126
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:41,280
the networking.

127
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:46,520
It's three times the wired and wireless network throughput than the previous models, and it

128
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:51,480
now has a better ability to sustain those high periods of throughput for longer periods

129
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:52,480
of time.

130
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:54,080
There's a couple of things at play here.

131
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:58,600
There's now a gigabit ethernet adapter on this board with a caveat that they're quite

132
00:07:58,600 --> 00:07:59,600
upfront about.

133
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,460
It is running over a USB 2 bus.

134
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:06,600
That's why you're just seeing a 3X improvement in speed, but it's pretty great.

135
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:10,560
And one of the ways they're getting improvement on the network throughput and on the processor

136
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:13,160
is we now have thermal plating on there.

137
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:18,440
The BROGCOM chip has a thermal spreader on it, and the Wi-Fi chipset is encapsulated

138
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:24,140
under a metal shield that's embossed rather fancy with the Raspberry Pi logo, which allows

139
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:31,680
them to certify the entire board as a radio module under the FCC rules, which will significantly

140
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:36,440
reduce the cost of conformance testing for Raspberry Pi-based products, products that

141
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:38,340
have a Raspberry Pi built in them.

142
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:39,440
That's a big deal right there.

143
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:44,840
So not only are we getting better thermals, but we also have easier certification for

144
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:47,040
radio-type workloads for the Raspberry Pi.

145
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:49,620
Yeah, and we didn't mention that the price hasn't changed either.

146
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:56,160
It's still the $35 price, which makes it a very attractive proposition to build into

147
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,360
other devices, doesn't it?

148
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:03,360
Because if they've paid for the certification for you already and it's only $35 for the

149
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:07,680
board, it's kind of a no-brainer at that point if you're building a product that needs an

150
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,160
onboard in it.

151
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:13,280
Another nod to the Raspberry Pi 3B Plus getting ready for more different types of industrial

152
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:17,720
workloads is if you get the right hat, the sucker now supports power over Ethernet.

153
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:20,280
That's going to open up to a wide range of use cases.

154
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:24,000
Yeah, that hat isn't actually available yet, but it will be shortly, apparently.

155
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,880
And yeah, that does seem very useful to not have to have a power supply.

156
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:32,840
You can have network and power over one cable, which makes it really easy to put in awkward

157
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:33,840
places.

158
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:34,920
So yeah, it's good to see that as well.

159
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:39,120
Just a quick public service announcement in case you end up picking up the 3B Plus.

160
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:44,360
They note that it uses more power, so make sure you get a high-quality 2.5 amp power

161
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:48,080
supply and don't run it on something that can't deliver that or else you're going to

162
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,080
have the crashes.

163
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:53,000
Yeah, they've kind of crept that power demand up, haven't they, with each new release, and

164
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,240
this one is the most power-hungry so far.

165
00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:00,640
And one criticism that I've seen is that it's still only got one gigabyte of RAM.

166
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:06,420
Now that is a limitation of the chipset, unfortunately, so until they make a major revision there,

167
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:11,200
it's going to be stuck with one gigabyte of RAM, which kind of, these days, feels a little

168
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:13,680
bit not enough, doesn't it?

169
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,700
Ah, geez, Joe.

170
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:18,960
Back in my day, I had 16 megs of RAM and I was happy.

171
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:24,800
Yeah, but this is 2018 and, you know, even running a server or something, unless you

172
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:28,840
want to be swapping out all the time, you're going to need more than one gig of RAM, really.

173
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:30,160
Ah, dang it, Joe.

174
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:33,560
Get off my lawn.

175
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:38,600
But I don't know whether I'm going to buy one or not, because I've got a 3 and I don't

176
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:43,960
use it that much, but one of the reasons that I don't use it very much is this network bottleneck,

177
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:50,800
and as they allude to here, that it's not only a bottleneck of 30-odd megabits per second

178
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:56,360
or whatever of a wireless, it's the fact that it can't continuously deliver that much throughput

179
00:10:56,360 --> 00:11:00,320
because it just kind of dies and then comes back, dies and then comes back as it gets

180
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:04,480
hot or something, and now they've addressed that problem, as well as making it faster,

181
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:09,880
it suddenly makes it much more useful to me, but it's not even that much money, but it's

182
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:13,220
just more the clutter of it, really, because I'll end up buying it and then just using

183
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:16,800
it for a while and then not using it, so I don't know.

184
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:23,040
I think I'll probably end up with one eventually, but if they rev the RAM, I think that's when

185
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:28,240
I would be probably looking to buy another one, but for now, I'm not going to buy one

186
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:29,240
anytime soon.

187
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:30,240
What about you?

188
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:34,080
You know, I have been tempted recently to use the open-source project Crankshaft and

189
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:38,560
make a Carputer out of the Raspberry Pi, and now that there's one that's just slightly faster,

190
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:42,720
I was already tempted, and now it's just a little bit faster, I'm even more a little

191
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:45,440
bit tempted, so I might actually pull the trigger.

192
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:49,780
I do have the same problem that you have, I've got a Raspberry Pi right across the table

193
00:11:49,780 --> 00:11:53,800
from me that I haven't used in a solid six months, and it looks at me, and that's why

194
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:57,800
I was tempted to do the Carputer, because I'm like, I'll use you, I'm sorry, I'm sorry

195
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:00,780
I've neglected you, little Raspberry Pi.

196
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:03,560
And what that tells us, Joe, is when those are sitting around our tables, is that we're

197
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:05,560
just not coming up with enough projects for them.

198
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:08,840
It's our fault, not the Raspberry Pi's.

199
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:16,760
dio.co slash action digitalocean.com DigitalOcean is simplicity at scale.

200
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:21,420
You can spin up infrastructure in seconds, and they built the entire system with simplicity

201
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:24,840
at the forefront, so managing infrastructure is simple.

202
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:30,920
If you're an expert or a total beginner, you're going to be at home, dio.co slash action.

203
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:33,800
For a limited time, if you go there, you'll get $100 credit.

204
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:37,120
Now it lasts 60 days, you have to have a valid credit card on file, and it's a new account.

205
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:41,860
A couple of caveats, but I wanted to let you know, because $100 credit is a special opportunity

206
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:42,860
over DigitalOcean.

207
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:47,180
Typically, we give out $10 in credit, and that will get you really far.

208
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:51,800
Two months for free on the DigitalOcean platform if you run the $5 a month rig, which is even

209
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:55,360
better than ever, because DigitalOcean has recently revised their droplet plans to make

210
00:12:55,360 --> 00:13:01,560
them even more competitive, and they've introduced flexible droplets, which you can mix and match

211
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:04,920
resources depending on what your application actually needs.

212
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:08,720
You need a little more disk, or you need a lot more CPU, you can mix and match depending.

213
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:11,460
And I think that's why they're introducing the $100 credit, because they really want

214
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:16,680
to give you an opportunity to play with this stuff, do.co slash action to get that.

215
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:21,680
Everything is SSD based, eight data centers around the world, a dashboard that is so straightforward

216
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:24,120
and easy to use, you'll be spinning up things for fun.

217
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:28,280
And if you get stuck, and one of their pre-built systems, which they have many, doesn't fit

218
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:35,200
your need, they have over 1800 tutorials that have been professionally edited and composed.

219
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:39,680
It's a fantastic resource, do.co slash action.

220
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:47,840
Mix DigitalOcean infrastructure in less than 55 seconds, do.co slash action.

221
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:51,680
So it's been quite a bad couple of weeks for Bitcoin, hasn't it?

222
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:58,440
And one story that jumped out at me was a city in New York State, Plattsburgh, has banned

223
00:13:58,440 --> 00:13:59,440
Bitcoin mining.

224
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:05,600
Well, that's the headline, but it's new Bitcoin miners aren't allowed to set up shop there,

225
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:10,280
at least for 18 months, because they've got pretty cheap power there.

226
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:13,600
But they've only got a limited supply of that from a hydro dam.

227
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:19,440
They've put an 18 month ban on any new Bitcoin miners, I guess it's been blown up over there,

228
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,240
because like Joe said, cheap power.

229
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:24,480
And the problem is when they exceed what they can generate themselves, they have to go out

230
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:26,640
on the market and buy the power.

231
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:33,000
And that raises the rates for all of the utility subscribers, sometimes by quite a bit.

232
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,040
Obviously that needs to change.

233
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:38,240
The average consumer shouldn't be penalized from the Bitcoin miners using all the power,

234
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:39,640
they should just be paying more.

235
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:43,440
And I have a suspicion that's what they're going to be working out over the next 18 months

236
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:46,280
is how they're going to pay more for this stuff.

237
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:49,800
It's the exact opposite of what's happening here in Washington.

238
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:53,480
In one small town in my home state, Washington, it's called Wenatchee.

239
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:58,640
They also have really low cost power because again, hydro electricity, and they have cool

240
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:00,080
temperatures.

241
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:03,780
And that makes for a great combination to mine Bitcoin.

242
00:15:03,780 --> 00:15:07,020
And Wenatchee has seen what they're calling a gold rush.

243
00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:09,740
Only in this case, the local businesses are sort of capitalizing on it.

244
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:15,120
They're creating stores for these businesses that have now employees that mine Bitcoin,

245
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:17,300
they sell goods in Bitcoin.

246
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:22,200
It's sort of an interesting little micro Bitcoin experiment that's happening right here in

247
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:23,200
my home state.

248
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:28,080
It sounds like they might use this 18 months to implement some sort of license scheme or

249
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:34,000
something, which is more regulation, which will probably drive the price yet further

250
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
down.

251
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:39,040
Because I can see if they implement it in this one town, then it could end up being

252
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:42,140
implemented in other towns in the US.

253
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:46,080
Because it is a huge power draw, and that is something that has to be addressed.

254
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:52,360
I suspect that these mining operations, these large scale data center size mining operations,

255
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:55,580
would be more than happy to pay for their fair share of the power usage.

256
00:15:55,580 --> 00:16:00,280
At least here in Washington, over in Wenatchee, they are producing 50 Bitcoins per day on

257
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:04,240
average, at least this is back in July, when the story ran.

258
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:09,400
Something tells me they've got the overhead, even when Bitcoin's around $7,000 or $5,000.

259
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:12,920
If they're getting 50 per day, they have the overhead to pay for that power.

260
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:15,800
Yeah, but it's not necessarily just about paying for it, is it?

261
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:21,360
And it's not even just Bitcoin mining and other cryptocurrencies.

262
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:26,360
You're moving into a world where we're using fewer fossil fuels and more stuff is going

263
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:28,400
electric, like vehicles, for example.

264
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:33,460
And the infrastructure required for that isn't really there at the moment.

265
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:38,760
You can't just expect to suddenly add a load of more demand and expect the infrastructure

266
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:40,440
to be there to deal with it.

267
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:44,520
And if we're going to have a future where there's a lot more of these cryptocurrencies

268
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:50,440
and it becomes a standard thing, then that's yet another demand on the electrical system

269
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:52,820
that they're going to have to deal with somehow.

270
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:57,880
I don't really tend to get too concerned about the power concerns because I don't feel like

271
00:16:57,880 --> 00:17:00,140
we have enough perspective.

272
00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:05,240
What is the Bitcoin power draw versus the power draw of air conditioners, for example?

273
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:09,360
And there's also stories that have run recently, surprisingly, like, for example, this one

274
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:15,060
over at Vox.com on February 27th that says, this Tennessee Valley electricity utility

275
00:17:15,060 --> 00:17:18,440
is freaking out because demand has been flat for years.

276
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:23,380
And they quote several utilities in the United States that actually say they have more supply

277
00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:25,220
than they have power demand.

278
00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:26,960
I wouldn't have thought that was the case either.

279
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:29,460
That contradicts everything I've heard.

280
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:34,820
But it's a really well cited article by Vox that talks about how a lot of these private

281
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:39,020
utility companies are losing money right now because there's simply not enough demand for

282
00:17:39,020 --> 00:17:41,160
the power that they have for the inventory.

283
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:47,000
So I don't feel like we have a big enough perspective on how Bitcoin powered consumption

284
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:53,780
really compares to other things like air conditioners or Tesla charging, or even just running the

285
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:57,260
dryer all day doing a large load of laundry.

286
00:17:57,260 --> 00:18:00,220
These are big numbers, but I don't really know how they compare.

287
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:03,920
Yeah, and if the price keeps going down, then it's going to be a moot point anyway, because

288
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:07,020
everyone will stop mining eventually once it gets slow enough.

289
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:08,020
Fair enough.

290
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:09,020
That probably will just solve it right there.

291
00:18:09,020 --> 00:18:10,860
It's a self-correcting problem, Joe.

292
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:16,100
Well, speaking of solving problems, Let's Encrypt solves the problem of HTTPS being

293
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:17,100
everywhere.

294
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:23,160
And they've taken another big step this week towards that by rolling out wildcard certificates.

295
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:24,780
Very excited about wildcard certificates.

296
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:28,460
It's something that Jupiter Broadcasting has been waiting for specifically, but not just

297
00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:30,000
wildcard certificates.

298
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,060
They've also rolled out ACME version two.

299
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:37,240
Now, ACME is the Automated Certificate Management Environment Protocol.

300
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:41,120
And it's an interface that can be used by a variety of client software packages.

301
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:46,740
You need open source packages in your repo to automate verification of certificate requests.

302
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:50,140
This is pretty great, because not only do we get the wildcard support, which, again,

303
00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:55,140
personally excited about, but with ACME version two, it's an IETF standard.

304
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:59,460
And it's had a lot of input by the industry, and it's got a draft in front of the Internet

305
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:02,580
Engineering Task Force standard body right now.

306
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:06,260
So it may not be in its final form, but it's going to be something that Let's Encrypt has

307
00:19:06,260 --> 00:19:09,140
helped push forward for the entire industry to use.

308
00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:13,140
And I have a sense there'll be a lot of open source software written around ACME to automate

309
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:14,720
a lot of this stuff for us.

310
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,200
And it really has worked, doesn't it?

311
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:21,740
Their mission to make everything HTTPS, because even on cheap cPanel hosting sites now, they

312
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:25,900
have no excuse not to offer a Let's Encrypt certificate.

313
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:27,020
And that's usually one click.

314
00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:31,300
I did one this week, actually, for a little site that I take care of.

315
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:34,220
And it just goes to show that it has worked.

316
00:19:34,220 --> 00:19:40,260
They set out to make everything HTTPS, and now, OK, not quite everything yet, but we

317
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:41,780
are certainly getting there.

318
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:45,420
And now with this wildcard thing, it's just going to make it that little bit easier for

319
00:19:45,420 --> 00:19:46,420
people.

320
00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:48,020
And that's got to be a good thing, hasn't it?

321
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:51,060
The more HTTPS, the better.

322
00:19:51,060 --> 00:19:52,160
100%.

323
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:56,900
Not only is it about SSL, but more than that, it's about identity verification.

324
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:59,200
And that's why HTTPS matters.

325
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:03,900
We have some additional details and some caveats about using Let's Encrypt's wildcard SSL

326
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:10,420
certificates in episode 359 of TechSnap, TechSnap.Systems slash 359.

327
00:20:10,420 --> 00:20:14,160
Additional details and some caveats in that episode about this.

328
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:18,700
But all in all, I am really positive about Let's Encrypt doing this.

329
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:22,820
This momentum, like you've mentioned, Joe, going in this direction is really positive

330
00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:23,820
for the web.

331
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:26,740
It's really positive for identity verification and e-commerce.

332
00:20:26,740 --> 00:20:28,100
Yeah.

333
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:30,740
So what about uninterruptible power supplies?

334
00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:35,820
We don't have an open hardware one of those yet, but maybe we will quite soon.

335
00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:36,820
Yeah.

336
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:40,160
As Eric Raymond put it, yes, ESR, they're ready for disruption.

337
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:44,380
And after reading his rationale, he is so right.

338
00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:45,420
And they've started a project.

339
00:20:45,420 --> 00:20:47,780
He and a group started a project called Upside.

340
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:52,420
It's currently defining requirements and developing a specification for a high quality UPS that

341
00:20:52,420 --> 00:20:58,080
can be built from off the shelf parts in any reasonably well equipped makerspace or home

342
00:20:58,080 --> 00:20:59,740
electronics shop.

343
00:20:59,740 --> 00:21:04,260
I have a little bit of background in the solar and inverter industry.

344
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:09,220
I had a client that is pretty famous in the inverter and solar industry, and they built

345
00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:11,780
all of their own UPSs there in shop.

346
00:21:11,780 --> 00:21:13,620
And we had pretty significant runtime.

347
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:17,800
I'm talking like 18 hour runtime off the batteries they built.

348
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:22,540
And they would use their inverter controllers to really monitor the health of the batteries,

349
00:21:22,540 --> 00:21:26,440
the charge that they were taking, how much they were putting out when we were using them,

350
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:28,060
how long they were going to last.

351
00:21:28,060 --> 00:21:31,180
It was superior to any commercial solution at the time.

352
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:33,020
And they built them on their own.

353
00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:35,100
So when I saw this, it really clicked for me.

354
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:37,900
I didn't realize that the off the shelf ones were so bad.

355
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:42,780
But from reading what he has to say about them, they're really just the absolute bare

356
00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:43,780
minimum, aren't they?

357
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:46,200
They just make them as cheap as possible.

358
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:51,220
And so you can see why he wants to start this new project to have an open standard for them.

359
00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:54,160
Yeah, there's all kinds in the industry.

360
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:56,820
And the more expensive you go, sometimes the fancier you get.

361
00:21:56,820 --> 00:21:58,940
But again, he's going for something that anybody could get.

362
00:21:58,940 --> 00:22:01,700
And some of the requirements they have, I really agree with.

363
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:06,020
Smart charging, which the circuitry built in will be more than just a constant trickle.

364
00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:08,820
It needs to be aware of the batteries charge so it doesn't degrade it.

365
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:13,440
The batteries should be more sophisticated than lead acid, maybe lithium ion or something

366
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:14,440
like that.

367
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:18,880
The open source UPS should be able to deliver 300 watts for 15 minutes as a bare minimum.

368
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:21,260
And the UPS should fail into a bypass mode.

369
00:22:21,260 --> 00:22:26,140
That means the power remains active rather than off, which a lot of UPS has just failed

370
00:22:26,140 --> 00:22:31,340
to, which brings down your system, which is the exact opposite of why you have a UPS on

371
00:22:31,340 --> 00:22:32,340
it.

372
00:22:32,340 --> 00:22:33,340
Yeah, that's terrible.

373
00:22:33,340 --> 00:22:37,220
I can't believe that any of them would fail to an off position.

374
00:22:37,220 --> 00:22:41,440
Surely that's just the first thing that you would build into it that it would fail on

375
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:42,780
rather than off.

376
00:22:42,780 --> 00:22:46,580
My assumption would be that you're trying to avoid damaging the equipment by under delivering

377
00:22:46,580 --> 00:22:47,580
voltage.

378
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:49,700
I suppose that makes sense.

379
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:52,300
But it's getting a main supply into it.

380
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:55,740
So surely there's a way to just bypass all the innards of it.

381
00:22:55,740 --> 00:22:56,740
Yeah, exactly.

382
00:22:56,740 --> 00:23:02,220
And like ESR points out, if you combine that with actual data over the USB bus, like output

383
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:08,260
voltage, discharge current, the temperature of the battery, you can start to predict behavior

384
00:23:08,260 --> 00:23:11,340
of the battery and essentially get a smart battery.

385
00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:15,140
And when you use that data, you can avoid things like random ass battery failure that's

386
00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:16,140
totally unpredicted.

387
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:19,540
Yeah, well, I'd quite like to build one of these once the standard is published.

388
00:23:19,540 --> 00:23:20,700
So yeah, looking forward to that.

389
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:22,300
Yeah, we'll have a link in the show notes.

390
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:26,100
If you'd like to check it out, go to linuxactionnews.com slash 45.

391
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:29,700
Okay, so let's end on a runs Linux.

392
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:34,300
And this week, Will Wheaton runs Linux what?

393
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:38,820
This is one of those beautiful blog grants where he takes to the web and says my Windows

394
00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:41,540
machine which began running Windows 10 pretty great.

395
00:23:41,540 --> 00:23:45,100
He thought it was a decent OS after a while began to run so slow.

396
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:49,740
He thought somebody put a 386 in there.

397
00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:54,260
And so he installed Debian, which is quite a strange choice for someone who's not that

398
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:55,260
experienced.

399
00:23:55,260 --> 00:23:58,780
I think he got there because he started with system testing tools to try to do troubleshooting

400
00:23:58,780 --> 00:24:00,760
on his hardware to find if something is wrong.

401
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:02,540
And then everything just worked under Linux.

402
00:24:02,540 --> 00:24:04,600
And so he just took it a step further, loaded it up.

403
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:08,940
And he says, after 17 minutes of trying to install Linux, I had my system booted.

404
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:12,180
And I was using a desktop that just worked the way I expected.

405
00:24:12,180 --> 00:24:18,300
I ran into a couple of idiosyncrasies that I'm not crazy about, he says, mild frustrations,

406
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:21,720
things like Twitter is painfully slow in my web browser.

407
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:25,220
And I can't watch Netflix or Hulu because of stupid DRM.

408
00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:27,240
And I think he's using Chromium.

409
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:28,980
Perhaps he should get a snap of Google.

410
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:30,700
Oh, wait, Google.

411
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:35,580
But it's cool to see someone high profile like that using Linux and blogging about it.

412
00:24:35,580 --> 00:24:38,180
It's got to be good for the whole community, isn't it?

413
00:24:38,180 --> 00:24:39,940
Yeah, it'll be an exciting journey to watch.

414
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:44,300
And I bet he'll have no shortage of people reaching out recommending ways to get Netflix

415
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:45,300
working.

416
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:46,500
Yeah, yeah.

417
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:47,500
Install Windows, probably.

418
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:53,940
He also said he tried an iMac and that he wasn't too impressed with either.

419
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:57,280
But you know, Joe, everybody eventually comes around to Linux.

420
00:24:57,280 --> 00:24:58,820
You can't avoid it.

421
00:24:58,820 --> 00:25:02,060
It's that slow, eventual takeover.

422
00:25:02,060 --> 00:25:06,040
Well, I'm sure we'll be keeping an eye on developments as Will continues his Linux journey

423
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:08,680
and of course, with everything else that's going on.
