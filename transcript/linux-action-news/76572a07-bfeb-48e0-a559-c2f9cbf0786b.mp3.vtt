00:00.000 --> 00:16.520
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, our weekly take on Linux and the open source world.

00:16.520 --> 00:19.980
This is episode three, recorded on May 28, 2017.

00:19.980 --> 00:20.980
I'm Chris.

00:20.980 --> 00:21.980
And I'm Joe.

00:21.980 --> 00:22.980
Hello, Joe.

00:22.980 --> 00:23.980
Good to be with you again.

00:23.980 --> 00:29.240
And we have good news for XFCE users coming up later on in the show, but we should probably

00:29.240 --> 00:33.440
start with the worldwide global news from Nextcloud.

00:33.440 --> 00:36.880
Yeah, big news from Nextcloud this week.

00:36.880 --> 00:45.560
Global scale, which is their way of scaling Nextcloud instances up to 300 million users

00:45.560 --> 00:47.740
was the quoted number.

00:47.740 --> 00:52.720
That's their kind of goal for this, which is a lofty ambition, to say the least.

00:52.720 --> 00:58.840
Yeah, it's obvious that Nextcloud is going head-forth, not only into enterprise, but

00:58.840 --> 01:02.960
at these numbers also, I would imagine, state installations.

01:02.960 --> 01:06.440
Now they're doing this through a series of different technologies, basically things to

01:06.440 --> 01:12.000
break out different jobs and make Nextcloud responsive across a network of systems.

01:12.000 --> 01:17.000
So using proxies and central database servers that are aware of which users are logged into

01:17.000 --> 01:21.320
which Nextcloud servers and all kinds of things that increase scalability.

01:21.320 --> 01:26.300
And the interesting thing, Joe, is that while for you and I, this seems like a good thing

01:26.300 --> 01:30.440
for Nextcloud to do, it probably doesn't really matter to most of us that are just running

01:30.440 --> 01:36.700
Nextcloud, say, on a VPS or on our local network, but there is actually kind of a cool angle.

01:36.700 --> 01:43.440
This technology would also enable portability in like a Nextcloud ecosystem, and what I

01:43.440 --> 01:47.360
mean by that is you could have a series of service providers that are already starting

01:47.360 --> 01:51.560
to crop up that could be at the ISP level or could be just something that you subscribe

01:51.560 --> 01:52.560
to online.

01:52.560 --> 01:54.280
It's like hosted Nextcloud.

01:54.280 --> 01:58.780
It does all of the things that Nextcloud do, but they manage the Nextcloud instance.

01:58.780 --> 02:04.840
But say you get annoyed with that provider, it could be possible to move your account

02:04.840 --> 02:07.660
and your data to a different Nextcloud instance.

02:07.660 --> 02:12.700
So Nextcloud becomes sort of a neutral platform that different service providers spin up,

02:12.700 --> 02:16.400
and then you can move around as a consumer using some of these same technologies they're

02:16.400 --> 02:19.320
building to make Nextcloud also massively scalable.

02:19.320 --> 02:24.320
Yeah, what they're trying to do is leverage themselves into a position of being the standard

02:24.320 --> 02:28.640
or at least a standard, which you can then move around, and it doesn't really matter

02:28.640 --> 02:31.920
where you're using it because it is just the standard way to do it.

02:31.920 --> 02:35.920
I was having a good chat with Yoss on episode 198 of Linux Unplugged.

02:35.920 --> 02:40.540
He works over at Nextcloud, and you start to realize after talking with him pretty quickly

02:40.540 --> 02:48.640
that they're a non-trivial amount of work away from creating a Slack and Mastodon killer.

02:48.640 --> 02:53.640
And I don't toss that around lightly, but if you look at their federated technology

02:53.640 --> 02:58.100
and you extrapolate from there and you make it possible to tag users across federated

02:58.100 --> 03:03.080
servers and you add global directory servers that are aware of what servers are online

03:03.080 --> 03:07.120
and which users are logged into which of those, and you start giving people addressable addresses

03:07.120 --> 03:13.140
like at Chris LAS across this federated server infrastructure, then you combine in their

03:13.140 --> 03:15.560
online collaborative editing.

03:15.560 --> 03:20.120
Their already built in existing file syncing and sharing services, their calendar and collaborative

03:20.120 --> 03:26.200
work, their note system and the apps that you can install, and the user data portability,

03:26.200 --> 03:33.600
what you got yourself here is a potential Mastodon Slack hybrid that is open source

03:33.600 --> 03:34.600
and user portable.

03:34.600 --> 03:35.960
It sounds amazing, doesn't it?

03:35.960 --> 03:41.960
It sounds like it could be a killer of Mastodon, as you say, and Slack, but can I pour a bit

03:41.960 --> 03:45.360
of cold water on this as usual?

03:45.360 --> 03:52.040
Should they not be thinking more about improving the core functionality first before they roll

03:52.040 --> 03:59.800
out all of these crazy new global scale federated systems?

03:59.800 --> 04:01.900
Do you know what I mean by that?

04:01.900 --> 04:07.280
Take for example, when you send me the audio for this to do the edit of the show, you're

04:07.280 --> 04:10.600
going to send me it using Dropbox.

04:10.600 --> 04:13.040
And the question I have for you is why?

04:13.040 --> 04:14.200
Why not Nextcloud?

04:14.200 --> 04:15.840
So I think I would argue a bit with the premise.

04:15.840 --> 04:18.760
I think they are improving the core with each release.

04:18.760 --> 04:22.840
They're definitely making solid security improvements and the upgrades seem to be getting better

04:22.840 --> 04:24.200
and better between releases.

04:24.200 --> 04:29.720
I would also, I would bet you that some of this is about replacing core infrastructure

04:29.720 --> 04:31.680
that needed to be reworked anyways.

04:31.680 --> 04:37.500
And so since they have to replace it, why not make it scale to infinity and beyond?

04:37.500 --> 04:44.600
And I think the reason why I don't use, say, their sync solution over Dropbox is twofold.

04:44.600 --> 04:48.840
Number one, I think the Dropbox CDNs are faster than anything I can implement, so you can

04:48.840 --> 04:52.440
pull it down and the other hosts I work with can pull down the files that I post up there

04:52.440 --> 04:56.160
super fast, basically can saturate your connection wherever you're at in the world.

04:56.160 --> 04:59.100
And that's particularly nice for the type of workload that I'm doing.

04:59.100 --> 05:03.680
The second thing is that I really have no interest in managing an instance at this point

05:03.680 --> 05:06.640
because I just want to share files that end up public anyways.

05:06.640 --> 05:10.960
I just want something that's exceedingly good at just moving those files.

05:10.960 --> 05:15.360
And the, I guess I said there was two things, but there's really three things.

05:15.360 --> 05:20.480
The software I use to record some of these shows natively integrates with Dropbox using

05:20.480 --> 05:23.040
their API and saves to Dropbox.

05:23.040 --> 05:29.120
That's its only save destination, as a matter of fact, which is incredible and welcome to

05:29.120 --> 05:30.120
do that.

05:30.120 --> 05:31.120
Yeah, and welcome to do that.

05:31.120 --> 05:32.120
I mean, I would bail, right?

05:32.120 --> 05:34.760
It's not an irreplaceable piece of software, so that's why I use it.

05:34.760 --> 05:38.680
If it was something that was fundamentally irreplaceable, I would not use that.

05:38.680 --> 05:43.200
But because I'm going to publish it to you via Dropbox anyways for now, it works.

05:43.200 --> 05:47.640
If that were to go away and I were to re-engineer a solution, Nextcloud would be a serious consideration

05:47.640 --> 05:48.640
for me.

05:48.640 --> 05:52.320
I might also look at other things that are just pure file syncing like C file.

05:52.320 --> 05:54.000
So it just kind of depends on the job.

05:54.000 --> 05:55.000
Yeah.

05:55.000 --> 05:56.000
Yeah.

05:56.000 --> 06:02.640
And for me, what they need to improve massively is the document editing, the collaborative

06:02.640 --> 06:10.040
editing because Google have just got that down so perfectly, as far as I can see.

06:10.040 --> 06:12.960
We're using it right now for the notes for the show.

06:12.960 --> 06:17.960
Google Docs in Drive is so, well, just perfect.

06:17.960 --> 06:18.960
It just works.

06:18.960 --> 06:22.400
It does everything I ever need it to do, autosaves all the rest of it.

06:22.400 --> 06:27.160
Whereas with Nextcloud, okay, it's getting there, but it's not quite there yet, is it?

06:27.160 --> 06:30.560
I think I still prefer Google Docs myself for doing show notes there, especially when

06:30.560 --> 06:32.120
you're live and you're on air.

06:32.120 --> 06:37.360
But I don't know, for an office where you have not exactly real-time collaboration but

06:37.360 --> 06:42.920
you have Joe looks at it for 15 minutes and then Chris looks at it for another 15 minutes,

06:42.920 --> 06:48.480
a half hour later, and then we publish it on the intranet, for that kind of collaborative

06:48.480 --> 06:53.920
editing or even like we're all at a meeting, say Joe, Chris, and the beard are all sitting

06:53.920 --> 06:58.760
around the Jupyter Broadcasting meeting table and we're all taking notes, I think it's fine

06:58.760 --> 07:01.480
for that kind of collaboration.

07:01.480 --> 07:04.940
We need to message, we need to be able to make corrections in real time while we're

07:04.940 --> 07:05.940
speaking on air.

07:05.940 --> 07:08.200
I think Google Docs has a leg up there.

07:08.200 --> 07:12.840
And the other place where Google Docs has a huge leg up is with Google Apps package

07:12.840 --> 07:16.500
that they're so successfully selling to businesses, at least here in the States, and particularly

07:16.500 --> 07:20.260
to schools, because you buy that one package and in case of the schools, you can even get

07:20.260 --> 07:22.000
in there for free.

07:22.000 --> 07:25.800
And you don't have to worry about hosting, you don't have to worry about infrastructure.

07:25.800 --> 07:30.900
You just get part of the Google Apps as part of your subscription.

07:30.900 --> 07:34.920
And that's why Nextcloud has to work more and more on their scaling and on being available

07:34.920 --> 07:39.180
to service providers, so service providers can go into things like businesses and schools

07:39.180 --> 07:41.280
and sell a Nextcloud solution.

07:41.280 --> 07:45.240
Because otherwise, the businesses are going to opt for the more sustainable, quote-unquote

07:45.240 --> 07:49.800
cheaper investment, which is right now, Google Docs or Google Apps.

07:49.800 --> 07:51.600
That's really their competition, I feel like.

07:51.600 --> 07:57.400
Yeah, well, let's hope they can create this standard and we'll get these hosted solutions

07:57.400 --> 08:01.280
and it'll be really easy for people to use and then they'll be using open source rather

08:01.280 --> 08:03.980
than evil Google.

08:03.980 --> 08:11.920
So from the future of file syncing to the past of init systems, Dev1 has finally reached

08:11.920 --> 08:12.920
1.0.0.

08:12.920 --> 08:14.080
Right.

08:14.080 --> 08:18.960
And it's worth noting this is their LTS release based on Jessie, which is a bit ironic, but

08:18.960 --> 08:20.400
we'll get to that.

08:20.400 --> 08:24.580
This was something we talked about with RC2, just announced only three weeks ago.

08:24.580 --> 08:28.960
But they feel like there was no critical bugs that came up and so for init freedom lovers

08:28.960 --> 08:31.000
out there, it's ready for a 1.0.

08:31.000 --> 08:32.560
What do you think, Joe?

08:32.560 --> 08:38.080
Well, I installed it and I also installed Debbie and Jessie and both of them had XFCE

08:38.080 --> 08:41.280
on them and I got them to be very, very similar.

08:41.280 --> 08:46.340
And so from a user's point of view, once you've got it installed, it's essentially the same

08:46.340 --> 08:47.340
operating system.

08:47.340 --> 08:49.020
Yeah, I did the same thing.

08:49.020 --> 08:50.020
It's just funny.

08:50.020 --> 08:51.020
I decided to do the same thing.

08:51.020 --> 08:54.800
But there is one major difference and that's why I said there's good news for XFCE users,

08:54.800 --> 08:58.400
because Dev1 doesn't give you the option to install GNOME 3.

08:58.400 --> 09:00.240
Let's just put it that way.

09:00.240 --> 09:04.840
So you get XFCE, you get LXDE and you get Mate.

09:04.840 --> 09:08.320
Well, I did it from the live CD, which was XFCE.

09:08.320 --> 09:12.000
So that was when I heard that the live CD was XFCE, I thought, great, well, because

09:12.000 --> 09:13.000
that's what I use.

09:13.000 --> 09:14.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

09:14.000 --> 09:16.280
And it does kind of seem like a good desktop.

09:16.280 --> 09:20.640
I was chewing this over, though, and you know where I would totally use Dev1?

09:20.640 --> 09:26.640
Not even as like a statement on system D. But if I just had a production system in place,

09:26.640 --> 09:30.960
a server that I had reason to believe would have issues if it was upgraded to system D

09:30.960 --> 09:38.540
and I needed a direction to go, if I could overlay the Dev1 packages or if I could upgrade

09:38.540 --> 09:44.160
an existing Debian release to the Dev1 Jesse 1.0 LTS, if I could do some sort of cross

09:44.160 --> 09:48.920
upgrade like that, so I don't break my system and I can keep my existing installation patched,

09:48.920 --> 09:53.700
I could definitely, definitely see a use for this, sort of like in the past, I used to

09:53.700 --> 09:57.880
convert Red Hat Enterprise servers to CentOS systems.

09:57.880 --> 10:01.280
And you would be, you know, you got it down, eventually, you just could replace the right

10:01.280 --> 10:04.880
packages and then all of a sudden, you could upgrade to the next CentOS release from the

10:04.880 --> 10:06.900
previous Red Hat Enterprise release.

10:06.900 --> 10:08.280
Don't ever do what Chris does.

10:08.280 --> 10:12.540
If you could do something similar with Dev1 and Debian, that might be nice for those that

10:12.540 --> 10:15.560
are actually worried about real world breakage.

10:15.560 --> 10:20.520
My personal opinion though is, it's much more likely that there are way more Gnome 3 users

10:20.520 --> 10:23.840
out there that if they tried to upgrade to this, would break their Gnome 3 desktops.

10:23.840 --> 10:28.880
Yeah, because Gnome's got a lot of dependencies on system D, hasn't it, so that's why, presumably,

10:28.880 --> 10:29.880
it's not in Dev1.

10:29.880 --> 10:34.160
At login D, specifically, yeah, exactly.

10:34.160 --> 10:40.360
The irony in all of this is though, as they hit Jesse 1.0, we get an actual release date

10:40.360 --> 10:41.640
for Debian Stretch.

10:41.640 --> 10:44.140
Yeah, which is going to be a few weeks' time.

10:44.140 --> 10:47.760
So they are almost a whole release behind now.

10:47.760 --> 10:50.780
I mean, you know, like, does that matter?

10:50.780 --> 10:55.320
Probably for the kind of person who is going to use Dev1, probably not, but if you want

10:55.320 --> 11:02.040
to be stuck on an old three point something kernel and stuff, don't know really.

11:02.040 --> 11:07.160
So Dev1 is an interesting project that I feel like is under a particularly higher amount

11:07.160 --> 11:10.560
of scrutiny than other recent distros that have come up.

11:10.560 --> 11:13.600
And one of the things that did jump out at me, and I can't tell if this is just me being

11:13.600 --> 11:18.600
critical, or if this is experience speaking, but in there, they talk about the reason it's

11:18.600 --> 11:24.360
good to release is because no critical bugs have been reported since the RC, three weeks

11:24.360 --> 11:25.920
ago.

11:25.920 --> 11:28.440
But if you have a tiny user base...

11:28.440 --> 11:31.500
Yeah, that's not good, potentially, is it?

11:31.500 --> 11:36.480
But you know what's funny about having Debian Jesse and Dev1 Jesse on the same system?

11:36.480 --> 11:38.160
Which one do you think boots faster?

11:38.160 --> 11:41.240
I guess I would have assumed the system D1, but I don't know.

11:41.240 --> 11:49.920
Yeah, but no, Dev1 booted much more quickly because I think it was struggling to read

11:49.920 --> 11:53.840
one of my other partitions or something during boot.

11:53.840 --> 11:56.080
And so it just sort of froze a little bit.

11:56.080 --> 12:00.080
I'm supposed to do something automatically with this, but I can't figure out what.

12:00.080 --> 12:01.080
Yeah.

12:01.080 --> 12:05.860
And I hadn't done any FSTab stuff or anything like that, it was just all automatic.

12:05.860 --> 12:13.460
So it's supposedly system D boots more quickly, but not in this case on my test machine.

12:13.460 --> 12:14.460
So there you go.

12:14.460 --> 12:21.080
Well, Joe's porn stash aside, I have reasonably system D systems are supposed to boot faster.

12:21.080 --> 12:24.520
Well, maybe.

12:24.520 --> 12:29.440
So let's talk about good news for Wimpy's favorite subject, VR.

12:29.440 --> 12:30.440
Yes.

12:30.440 --> 12:34.420
Steam VR is now supposedly working under Linux.

12:34.420 --> 12:38.400
And now this is an update that was pushed out to Steam and it's experimental at this

12:38.400 --> 12:42.480
point and it also includes an update to Steam OS, more details in a second.

12:42.480 --> 12:45.280
And this is called Steam VR Home Support.

12:45.280 --> 12:49.200
It's a beta feature from Valve, which makes like some of the social stuff and the interactive

12:49.200 --> 12:50.720
launcher work.

12:50.720 --> 12:55.680
And if you combine it with the right base distribution, and I'll get to that more in

12:55.680 --> 13:03.200
a moment, you can actually get full Valve VR features under Steam OS or Linux.

13:03.200 --> 13:07.280
And boy, is my body ready for this Joe, because I preemptively bought the Vive hardware the

13:07.280 --> 13:12.840
moment they announced that they would be doing this, which is Vive is who Valve works with.

13:12.840 --> 13:17.780
And I got it all pretty much ready to go, tried to set it up under multiple different

13:17.780 --> 13:21.820
distributions and hit different roadblocks depending on the distribution I tried.

13:21.820 --> 13:26.560
So having this get this part down the road means that the setup experience should be

13:26.560 --> 13:30.160
a lot smoother, especially if you use the new Steam OS update.

13:30.160 --> 13:31.720
But hang on, how's that going to work in the RV?

13:31.720 --> 13:35.840
You're going to be running into things left, right, and center trying to do VR.

13:35.840 --> 13:37.720
Boom, pop, boom.

13:37.720 --> 13:38.720
It's worth it, Joe.

13:38.720 --> 13:41.060
No, I have it set up here in the studio living room.

13:41.060 --> 13:42.060
It's for the studio.

13:42.060 --> 13:43.060
It's not for me.

13:43.060 --> 13:47.600
It'll be like set up here for people to play around with when they visit JB1.

13:47.600 --> 13:50.760
And so this is like, you know, this is like going to be like a big thing.

13:50.760 --> 13:52.320
I was going to get wimpy.

13:52.320 --> 13:56.680
I was going to get wimpy in the VR headset here at the JB1 studio while he was out here

13:56.680 --> 13:58.480
for Linux Fest Northwest.

13:58.480 --> 14:02.440
And three different people took three different cracks at getting it working under Linux with

14:02.440 --> 14:04.380
very minimal results.

14:04.380 --> 14:06.000
And we were not satisfied with what we got.

14:06.000 --> 14:09.820
So we didn't bother because we thought if we gave wimpy a bad showing, it would be worse

14:09.820 --> 14:11.100
than nothing at all.

14:11.100 --> 14:16.480
So we just put it back in the box and didn't bring it up.

14:16.480 --> 14:22.000
This isn't particularly exciting news right now because it doesn't work that well.

14:22.000 --> 14:24.120
It sounds like it's very experimental.

14:24.120 --> 14:25.800
It's all kind of beta.

14:25.800 --> 14:31.120
But for me, why this is very important is it shows that Valve has not abandoned Steam

14:31.120 --> 14:32.280
OS.

14:32.280 --> 14:38.600
And again, you mentioned this update to the beta, Brewmaster beta.

14:38.600 --> 14:44.400
It's had a huge update to the latest version of Debbie and Jesse and new kernel and all

14:44.400 --> 14:46.320
that kind of stuff.

14:46.320 --> 14:50.200
And it shows that Valve have not forgotten about Steam OS.

14:50.200 --> 14:51.720
And I wonder why that is.

14:51.720 --> 14:58.280
Is it because of Windows 10 S maybe, because that was the possibility that they created

14:58.280 --> 15:01.120
Steam OS as a hedge against, wasn't it?

15:01.120 --> 15:06.440
Because of the fact that if you get a Windows version that you can only install stuff from

15:06.440 --> 15:12.800
the store, then Valve loses their control with Steam to deliver the software to you.

15:12.800 --> 15:16.080
When I heard that Windows S story and the fact that Windows S would be limited to a

15:16.080 --> 15:19.880
certain subset of apps from the Windows Store, in fact, now we've learned it's even more

15:19.880 --> 15:23.840
limited than we initially thought, like the Windows Linux subsystem stuff will not be

15:23.840 --> 15:28.000
available from the App Store, even though it's in the Windows Store.

15:28.000 --> 15:31.600
When I first heard that story, my first thought was, this is exactly what Valve was worried

15:31.600 --> 15:32.600
about.

15:32.600 --> 15:34.600
And so I would say you're totally wrong.

15:34.600 --> 15:41.680
Having spoken with the gentleman at Dell who is responsible for Dell's Alienware Steam

15:41.680 --> 15:46.680
machine, which I think is officially the most successful Steam machine, if not unofficially

15:46.680 --> 15:48.840
the most successful Steam machine.

15:48.840 --> 15:52.880
And we asked them specifically, well, when are you guys going to update this thing again?

15:52.880 --> 15:55.240
Because it's been a couple of years.

15:55.240 --> 15:57.120
And Dell said, well, we're waiting for VR.

15:57.120 --> 16:04.000
We feel like when Valve nails VR in Steam OS, we're going to rev the hardware.

16:04.000 --> 16:07.620
And I bet you Dell's not the only hardware manufacturer thinking that.

16:07.620 --> 16:12.280
And so Valve does have a couple of hardware partners that are sufficiently happy with

16:12.280 --> 16:14.980
the sales to produce another unit.

16:14.980 --> 16:18.560
But they need a reason to put a GTX 1080 in there or something like that.

16:18.560 --> 16:24.520
My conversation with the guys at Dell were like, yeah, we put a GTX 1080 in this thing.

16:24.520 --> 16:29.160
But to tell you the truth, the majority of our customers are playing at 1080p.

16:29.160 --> 16:35.160
And a 960, an NVIDIA 960 does just fine when you're pushing 1080p.

16:35.160 --> 16:38.640
And then for our customers that are going to 4K, most of them know how to open up this

16:38.640 --> 16:40.440
machine and put a different video card in too.

16:40.440 --> 16:42.120
Like it's just not huge yet.

16:42.120 --> 16:47.520
But if we could get 4K and Steam VR and all these different requirements, we'd be happy

16:47.520 --> 16:49.240
to rev another piece of hardware.

16:49.240 --> 16:52.920
So Valve might be readying the groundwork with these Steam OS updates, their quote unquote

16:52.920 --> 16:56.200
biggest update ever for a new generation of Steam machines.

16:56.200 --> 17:01.220
Well, let's hope so, because I would really like to see Steam OS do well and be a serious

17:01.220 --> 17:07.400
competitor to Windows, or at least maybe the Xbox and the PlayStation.

17:07.400 --> 17:13.160
It seems a bit ambitious, but I'd like to see Linux out there doing well in gaming and

17:13.160 --> 17:14.160
being taken seriously.

17:14.160 --> 17:16.960
And you know, Joe, I actually had a conversation with a couple of different people who are

17:16.960 --> 17:18.440
like, I love PC games.

17:18.440 --> 17:22.580
If I could play it easier in my living room, I would totally do it.

17:22.580 --> 17:25.400
So maybe that's what they're going to offer.

17:25.400 --> 17:29.800
So it's good to see the Steam OS update because it also includes some of the Vulkan drivers

17:29.800 --> 17:34.780
needed to make VR work, which is actually the trickiest part of getting VR to work under

17:34.780 --> 17:40.480
Linux right now, is you have to get a particular version of the NVIDIA driver that has a particular

17:40.480 --> 17:42.600
build of Vulkan.

17:42.600 --> 17:46.920
It's the same version that a lot of distributions ship by default, but it's a different branch

17:46.920 --> 17:48.100
of the driver.

17:48.100 --> 17:50.320
And so it causes a lot of package conflicts.

17:50.320 --> 17:52.860
And so Steam OS is smoothing that out.

17:52.860 --> 17:56.960
And this is an example where Steam OS allows Valve to sort of iron out some of those little

17:56.960 --> 17:57.960
bumps.

17:57.960 --> 18:01.160
Yeah, and if they get it to the point where it is just an appliance that you can plug

18:01.160 --> 18:08.920
in and start using, because it's based on Linux, we're all going to benefit from that.

18:08.920 --> 18:12.360
This episode of Linux Action News is brought to you by DigitalOcean.

18:12.360 --> 18:17.240
Go to DigitalOcean.com, create an account, and use our promo code, here's the thing,

18:17.240 --> 18:18.840
and you'll get a $10 credit.

18:18.840 --> 18:22.800
You apply that to your account, create the $5 rig, run it two months for free, or run

18:22.800 --> 18:24.480
one of their hourly systems.

18:24.480 --> 18:27.880
When I was trying out that new Nextcloud release, I spun it up on a DigitalOcean droplet, ran

18:27.880 --> 18:29.640
it for a little while, kicked the tires.

18:29.640 --> 18:30.920
I really enjoyed it.

18:30.920 --> 18:33.320
Joe of Memory serves, you got a couple of droplets yourself.

18:33.320 --> 18:37.440
Yeah, I've been using DigitalOcean for quite a while now, and it's brilliant.

18:37.440 --> 18:38.440
Maniac.

18:38.440 --> 18:45.120
The only thing I used it for was when I needed to get late night Linux onto Google Play podcasts.

18:45.120 --> 18:46.680
You can only do that from the states.

18:46.680 --> 18:51.480
I thought, well, I could fire up a VPN, or I could do something a bit more interesting.

18:51.480 --> 18:59.200
I fired up a droplet in New York, just the $5 one, installed X2Go, logged into it from

18:59.200 --> 19:05.360
my laptop, installed LXDE, browsed to the website, set everything up, and then destroyed

19:05.360 --> 19:08.640
the droplet, and guess how much it cost me?

19:08.640 --> 19:09.640
Hmm.

19:09.640 --> 19:11.320
Six cents, seven cents, eight cents?

19:11.320 --> 19:12.320
What?

19:12.320 --> 19:13.320
One cent.

19:13.320 --> 19:16.080
You were quick, too, then.

19:16.080 --> 19:17.080
That's nice.

19:17.080 --> 19:18.400
Yeah, the hourly pricing is killer for that.

19:18.400 --> 19:21.040
I love it for trying out different open source projects.

19:21.040 --> 19:25.160
We have, right now, Joe and I are chatting over Mumble, and we have a Jupyter Broadcasting

19:25.160 --> 19:29.400
Mumble server that we use on Linux Unplugged, and we run that on a DigitalOcean droplet.

19:29.400 --> 19:34.840
One of the things I love about it is the performance is extremely respectable for wherever you're

19:34.840 --> 19:36.840
connecting in the world.

19:36.840 --> 19:40.360
But if you know where your users are going to be at, you can position using one of their

19:40.360 --> 19:41.680
worldwide data centers.

19:41.680 --> 19:46.440
They have them all over the world in New York, San Francisco, Singapore, Amsterdam, London,

19:46.440 --> 19:48.320
Toronto, Germany, India.

19:48.320 --> 19:49.880
They have them spinning up all the time.

19:49.880 --> 19:52.160
You might just want to go create a droplet next to Alan June.

19:52.160 --> 19:53.160
I know I do.

19:53.160 --> 19:56.140
DigitalOcean.com, go over there, create an account.

19:56.140 --> 19:57.560
Also play around with their block storage.

19:57.560 --> 19:58.560
It's just super sweet.

19:58.560 --> 19:59.560
You can go up to 16 terabytes.

19:59.560 --> 20:03.880
You can attach it to your device as block storage, mess around with whatever file system

20:03.880 --> 20:09.280
you want or crazy LVM setup, DigitalOcean.com is a great place to learn and put things into

20:09.280 --> 20:11.200
production and experiment.

20:11.200 --> 20:12.200
Just use our promo code.

20:12.200 --> 20:16.160
Here's the thing at DigitalOcean.com and a big thank you to DigitalOcean for sponsoring

20:16.160 --> 20:17.400
Linux Action News.

20:17.400 --> 20:26.160
Well, we talked about Steam on Linux and a great way to use that is on Solus.

20:26.160 --> 20:33.240
And this week, Solus have announced preliminary KDE Plasma support, something that iKey was

20:33.240 --> 20:41.360
very reluctant to do before he said that they needed to have a maintainer for it.

20:41.360 --> 20:46.340
And it looks like they have found a maintainer, Peter O'Connor.

20:46.340 --> 20:49.600
And so it doesn't quite work yet.

20:49.600 --> 20:55.720
It's not officially supported, but it is coming very soon by the looks of things that you'll

20:55.720 --> 21:00.520
be able to have a proper Plasma desktop on top of Solus, which is just going to increase

21:00.520 --> 21:05.360
their potential user base massively because maybe you don't like GTK.

21:05.360 --> 21:08.480
Maybe you're a KDE user, have been for a long time.

21:08.480 --> 21:12.680
Well now, once this gets worked out and the bugs are squashed and it's all working, you'll

21:12.680 --> 21:14.040
be able to use Solus.

21:14.040 --> 21:17.480
I like the way iKey wrote this post because he kind of gives the background on how this

21:17.480 --> 21:19.400
happened and it makes a lot of sense.

21:19.400 --> 21:24.120
Essentially there were big ticket items that were using the KDE frameworks like KDE Live

21:24.120 --> 21:27.880
and K3b that they essentially needed somebody's help with anyways.

21:27.880 --> 21:31.560
And so Peter comes on, he seems to be pretty ambitious about this whole thing, and he acknowledges

21:31.560 --> 21:33.320
it's early days with this.

21:33.320 --> 21:37.920
But if the community works with him, I think you might end up finding the Plasma desktop

21:37.920 --> 21:40.880
being one of the premier desktops of Solus.

21:40.880 --> 21:44.200
And if they're going to continue to bring in more cute stuff too, why not have somebody

21:44.200 --> 21:45.720
that's on top of that?

21:45.720 --> 21:48.820
He also broke out the whole team there of maintainers.

21:48.820 --> 21:49.820
Makes a lot of sense.

21:49.820 --> 21:53.320
As somebody who's running Plasma for a while, I was using it on Arch and Neon and Solus

21:53.320 --> 21:54.320
would be a great addition to that.

21:54.320 --> 21:56.160
I mean, it seems like a great mix.

21:56.160 --> 22:00.200
And recently Solus is one of the distributions that switched over to that NVIDIA driver that

22:00.200 --> 22:02.480
has the Vulkan support to make Steam VR work.

22:02.480 --> 22:05.680
So you could really get yourself a pretty nice setup going if you're a Plasma desktop

22:05.680 --> 22:09.840
user that wants some of the latest Steam stuff and it could be just a great distribution

22:09.840 --> 22:11.300
for that class of user.

22:11.300 --> 22:17.100
And you know, I can't help but feel that Plasma is going to get more users very soon because

22:17.100 --> 22:18.100
of Ubuntu.

22:18.100 --> 22:19.100
It sounds a bit strange.

22:19.100 --> 22:24.720
You think, well, hang on, surely Ubuntu getting rid of Unity and going to GNOME is going to

22:24.720 --> 22:30.400
mean you're going to have more GNOME users, but the reality is that it's just not that

22:30.400 --> 22:31.400
good GNOME.

22:31.400 --> 22:34.680
I mean, is that a controversial thing to say?

22:34.680 --> 22:36.000
It seems to be a bit crashy.

22:36.000 --> 22:41.840
You were talking about the OBS box crashing quite a lot, at least once a week.

22:41.840 --> 22:42.840
Once a day.

22:42.840 --> 22:43.840
Yeah.

22:43.840 --> 22:44.840
Well, yeah.

22:44.840 --> 22:45.840
Yeah.

22:45.840 --> 22:46.840
I've realized it's much more often.

22:46.840 --> 22:48.040
In fact, I now have multiple issues with it.

22:48.040 --> 22:49.040
Yeah, you're right.

22:49.040 --> 22:52.240
I was talking about that on user 10 and it is, if you want to know more, I did a little

22:52.240 --> 22:56.040
deep diving into what I consider some of the core performance issues with GNOME.

22:56.040 --> 22:57.040
Yeah.

22:57.040 --> 22:59.200
And that's what got me thinking about it.

22:59.200 --> 23:04.760
The thing is that KDE Plasma has just got better and better and better over the last

23:04.760 --> 23:06.000
year or so.

23:06.000 --> 23:13.340
And every time I try it, it seems to just be better and more stable and run perfectly.

23:13.340 --> 23:20.920
And so it has me thinking that if you want a modern desktop, I love XFCE, I quite like

23:20.920 --> 23:27.320
Marte, but KDE, if you want something really modern, they really are pushing the boundaries.

23:27.320 --> 23:33.160
And Qt, to me, seems like a better long-term commitment if you're a developer, because

23:33.160 --> 23:37.160
GTK is just this constantly shifting goalposts.

23:37.160 --> 23:38.640
I think GTK is getting there.

23:38.640 --> 23:41.120
I think they're about to announce 4.0.

23:41.120 --> 23:42.840
They're working on a latest release.

23:42.840 --> 23:44.600
I think they're really getting there now with GTK.

23:44.600 --> 23:50.000
It's starting to calm down, so that criticism will be less of a concern as they land on

23:50.000 --> 23:51.000
that.

23:51.000 --> 23:58.420
I think the main attraction to GNOME is for people that are switching from macOS or Windows,

23:58.420 --> 23:59.800
where it's so noisy.

23:59.800 --> 24:01.400
There's so much stuff they're throwing at you.

24:01.400 --> 24:04.080
They're even now putting ads in your launcher.

24:04.080 --> 24:06.460
It's so much input to your brain.

24:06.460 --> 24:09.920
You just want to get your terminal and your text editor and your browser and have a clean

24:09.920 --> 24:12.300
environment, and GNOME is that.

24:12.300 --> 24:16.780
As much as I love Plasma, the reason why I actually switched back to the GNOME shell

24:16.780 --> 24:23.720
was three and a half months and change into my Plasma 5 desktop re-experiment again.

24:23.720 --> 24:28.000
When I was really busy and really trying to rush, I found myself getting flustered on

24:28.000 --> 24:31.920
how to use the UI and where certain things were in Dolphin or accidentally closing the

24:31.920 --> 24:35.280
wrong pane and still not picking up on some of the UI cues.

24:35.280 --> 24:39.520
So I decided for my own work efficiency, it was faster if I just switched back to GNOME

24:39.520 --> 24:45.560
and ignored some of the surface-level obvious-to-see performance issues in trade-off for a more

24:45.560 --> 24:47.640
efficient workflow for me overall.

24:47.640 --> 24:48.640
I love Plasma.

24:48.640 --> 24:49.640
I think Kaywin's great.

24:49.640 --> 24:52.720
I think the transition to Wayland, it's going to be even a stronger contender, but right

24:52.720 --> 24:57.040
now UI-wise, GNOME feels like it gets out of my way more.

24:57.040 --> 25:03.660
Well, I can't stand GNOME, I'm afraid, whereas KDE, I've never been a fan, a massive fan

25:03.660 --> 25:05.940
at least, but it's growing on me.

25:05.940 --> 25:06.940
What can I say?

25:06.940 --> 25:09.560
And this Solus thing gets me pretty excited.

25:09.560 --> 25:10.560
I think that...

25:10.560 --> 25:11.560
Are you considering trying it, Joe?

25:11.560 --> 25:13.040
Are you considering giving it a go?

25:13.040 --> 25:21.700
I am considering it, yeah, because the thing is XFCE is, well, as Aiki described it, is

25:21.700 --> 25:23.880
basically dead technology.

25:23.880 --> 25:31.520
They're just about porting the panel to GTK3 when GTK4 is about to be released.

25:31.520 --> 25:38.920
So I have to think long-term, and Mate is great, and that's my go-to apart from XFCE.

25:38.920 --> 25:43.580
But if you're going to move away from XFCE, why not look at all the options?

25:43.580 --> 25:46.480
And GNOME, I just do not like.

25:46.480 --> 25:51.360
And anything lighter, like LXDE or LXCUTE, I don't really like.

25:51.360 --> 25:56.560
So I'm thinking KDE might be worth a try.

25:56.560 --> 25:58.200
I mean, we'll see.

25:58.200 --> 25:59.440
We'll see whether I actually...

25:59.440 --> 26:01.200
I'm fascinated by this.

26:01.200 --> 26:03.200
I would love to see if you try it.

26:03.200 --> 26:04.640
I would love to hear how it goes.

26:04.640 --> 26:07.860
I thought it was pretty powerful, very stable for me.

26:07.860 --> 26:09.320
Very reliable, good performance.

26:09.320 --> 26:11.160
KWIN is butter smooth.

26:11.160 --> 26:15.800
I have nothing but positive things to say, other than I found the UI options still overwhelming

26:15.800 --> 26:16.800
at the end of the day.

26:16.800 --> 26:19.800
And I just felt like I didn't want to feel like a dumbass when I was using my machine.

26:19.800 --> 26:22.080
Well, what I really like about it is the configurability.

26:22.080 --> 26:28.000
I can make it act exactly like XFCE, essentially, only be based on modern technology.

26:28.000 --> 26:29.000
Yeah.

26:29.000 --> 26:33.020
You can definitely make it basically work like any desktop environment you want.

26:33.020 --> 26:34.440
That is one of the nice things about it.

26:34.440 --> 26:39.040
It sometimes leads to endless tinkering, but if you can set limits for yourself, it's a

26:39.040 --> 26:40.040
really nice setup.

26:40.040 --> 26:41.040
Yeah.

26:41.040 --> 26:42.040
Well, that's...

26:42.040 --> 26:43.040
Yeah, exactly.

26:43.040 --> 26:44.040
I wouldn't do that.

26:44.040 --> 26:47.920
I would just set it up as I have it set up now, which is basically like Windows XP.

26:47.920 --> 26:48.920
And then just...

26:48.920 --> 26:49.920
And just leave it.

26:49.920 --> 26:50.920
...forget about it.

26:50.920 --> 26:51.920
Yeah.

26:51.920 --> 26:52.920
Yeah.

26:52.920 --> 26:53.920
And what would you run as the base OS, as the underlying distro?

26:53.920 --> 26:57.780
Well, I've always been a fan of Ubuntu LTS as a base.

26:57.780 --> 27:03.840
It just seems to be the best compromise because you've got PPAs for anything that you need

27:03.840 --> 27:08.840
new versions of, but I'm generally happy with old versions of Labor Office and that kind

27:08.840 --> 27:09.840
of thing.

27:09.840 --> 27:10.840
I don't need to be...

27:10.840 --> 27:15.160
I'm not one of these arch users that has to have the latest of everything, like you.

27:15.160 --> 27:16.160
Okay.

27:16.160 --> 27:23.280
I wonder if things like flat packs and snap packages, if they are successful, if they

27:23.280 --> 27:24.440
will change that.

27:24.440 --> 27:27.800
Because when you say PPAs, I cringe a little bit, to be honest with you.

27:27.800 --> 27:28.800
Really?

27:28.800 --> 27:29.800
Yeah.

27:29.800 --> 27:30.800
I just...

27:30.800 --> 27:31.800
I'm not a big fan of PPAs anymore.

27:31.800 --> 27:36.800
But it was a model that worked for limited distribution for testing software out of Launchpad

27:36.800 --> 27:40.040
and became a way to distribute software on the Ubuntu desktop.

27:40.040 --> 27:41.040
And it's just...

27:41.040 --> 27:42.040
It's so clunky.

27:42.040 --> 27:45.920
Like when you subscribe to projects that are maintained by contributors and that contributor

27:45.920 --> 27:51.360
stops updating the PPA and you start getting 404s when you try to update your cache repo,

27:51.360 --> 27:52.360
it's super obnoxious.

27:52.360 --> 27:53.360
Well, yeah.

27:53.360 --> 27:57.180
You've got to not go mad and be adding PPAs left, right, and center, but the odd thing,

27:57.180 --> 28:02.600
like get iPlayer, for example, is something that I need a PPA for generally, because I've

28:02.600 --> 28:08.000
just upgraded to 16.04 on my main kind of media box, and it's working for now.

28:08.000 --> 28:13.000
But when that breaks, I'll have to add a PPA, basically, to make it continue to work.

28:13.000 --> 28:16.320
But that's one little command line program.

28:16.320 --> 28:19.680
We're not talking about huge things like a desktop or whatever.

28:19.680 --> 28:20.680
I agree.

28:20.680 --> 28:24.360
If you limit it to a couple of functional PPAs, one or two applications, you're generally

28:24.360 --> 28:25.360
fine.

28:25.360 --> 28:27.040
And that's something that's pretty popular.

28:27.040 --> 28:31.500
If one PPA dies, you can often find a replacement.

28:31.500 --> 28:35.760
Maybe for example, you want to subscribe and get the latest developments from Firefox.

28:35.760 --> 28:36.760
Hmm.

28:36.760 --> 28:37.760
Yeah.

28:37.760 --> 28:38.760
Firefox.

28:38.760 --> 28:46.520
Now, this week, there was a blog post on Medium by Eric Petit, who is the head of marketing

28:46.520 --> 28:47.520
for Firefox.

28:47.520 --> 28:52.360
Now, the first sentence in this blog post is, I head up Firefox marketing, but I use

28:52.360 --> 28:53.840
Chrome every day.

28:53.840 --> 28:54.840
Yeah.

28:54.840 --> 28:57.760
If I had a bell, I'd be dinging it, Chris.

28:57.760 --> 28:58.760
What?

28:58.760 --> 29:04.280
You're the head of marketing, and you use Chrome every day, and you're admitting that

29:04.280 --> 29:05.840
first up.

29:05.840 --> 29:09.200
Okay, well, let's just try and move past that.

29:09.200 --> 29:14.800
And what this blog post is about is browse against the machine, which is a bit of a...

29:14.800 --> 29:17.200
I don't know what the word for it is, really.

29:17.200 --> 29:18.200
Yeah.

29:18.200 --> 29:19.200
It's their new campaign.

29:19.200 --> 29:23.880
It's their new campaign to try to make users aware of the differences between Firefox and

29:23.880 --> 29:27.840
Chrome, and that Chrome is connected to a larger machine.

29:27.840 --> 29:31.900
So you can browse against the machine by electing to use Firefox.

29:31.900 --> 29:35.440
And what Eric does here is he tries to build a case for it.

29:35.440 --> 29:38.960
He says, Chrome has four times the market share of its nearest competitor, which is

29:38.960 --> 29:40.420
Firefox.

29:40.420 --> 29:45.560
He compares it to an eight-lane highway to the largest advertising company in the world.

29:45.560 --> 29:50.960
Google built it to maximize revenue from your searches and delivered display ads on millions

29:50.960 --> 29:55.960
of websites to monetize every single click.

29:55.960 --> 30:01.520
And today, there exists no meaningful safety valve on its market dominance.

30:01.520 --> 30:03.860
So he's trying to build this as like a war.

30:03.860 --> 30:07.140
This is the battle for the web.

30:07.140 --> 30:12.480
And so he's building Firefox up as this way to manage this.

30:12.480 --> 30:16.000
Today, Firefox is better than it was even a year ago.

30:16.000 --> 30:17.000
It's faster.

30:17.000 --> 30:18.000
It lags less.

30:18.000 --> 30:19.800
It hogs much less memory than Chrome.

30:19.800 --> 30:23.920
And in June, we'll release a multi-process Firefox, putting us at performance parity

30:23.920 --> 30:28.780
with Chrome in most of the ways mere humans can actually perceive.

30:28.780 --> 30:32.940
It's because of this newfound internal confidence with Firefox that Mozilla has started to become

30:32.940 --> 30:34.760
more aggressive again.

30:34.760 --> 30:38.440
And they are announcing the browsing against the machine campaign with a renewed posture

30:38.440 --> 30:41.500
for Firefox and a return to their roots.

30:41.500 --> 30:43.900
So they've got these five points, right?

30:43.900 --> 30:45.280
The first one, Firefox is leaner.

30:45.280 --> 30:46.280
It takes up less memory.

30:46.280 --> 30:47.280
Blah, blah, blah.

30:47.280 --> 30:48.280
OK.

30:48.280 --> 30:49.280
So that's a technical argument.

30:49.280 --> 30:52.360
The other four are four different ways of saying we're not Chrome.

30:52.360 --> 30:53.360
Yes.

30:53.360 --> 30:57.140
That's their biggest argument for why you should use Firefox, we're not Chrome.

30:57.140 --> 30:59.600
Their last part is we're Mozilla, not Google, basically.

30:59.600 --> 31:00.600
Yeah.

31:00.600 --> 31:01.600
Yeah.

31:01.600 --> 31:02.600
Yeah.

31:02.600 --> 31:03.600
And then they've actually, boy, it's weak.

31:03.600 --> 31:07.060
Firefox is not built by and for the largest advertising company in the world.

31:07.060 --> 31:08.060
So there's that.

31:08.060 --> 31:11.520
That's literally what they put in the sentence.

31:11.520 --> 31:13.520
Or Eric did, I guess.

31:13.520 --> 31:14.520
Yeah.

31:14.520 --> 31:15.520
Yeah.

31:15.520 --> 31:19.060
There is a lot of bark here.

31:19.060 --> 31:20.260
There's definitely a lot of bark.

31:20.260 --> 31:24.760
I don't know where the bite's at exactly.

31:24.760 --> 31:29.060
It does land a little soft because he admits he uses Chrome every day.

31:29.060 --> 31:30.980
And he goes on to say that, you know, it's fine.

31:30.980 --> 31:32.980
I use it because I am logged into different stuff.

31:32.980 --> 31:36.900
And I have some stuff in Chrome and I have some stuff in Firefox.

31:36.900 --> 31:45.800
But I feel like Eric here, so just like Mozilla was fighting the mobile battle with Firefox

31:45.800 --> 31:51.640
OS too late, Firefox is too late in responding to Chrome.

31:51.640 --> 31:54.400
It's the same story over again, unfortunately.

31:54.400 --> 32:00.840
But they're so caught up on this solid moral reason, we need an open competitor for the

32:00.840 --> 32:01.840
web.

32:01.840 --> 32:06.520
They're so caught up on the technical achievements they've made with the improvements to Firefox

32:06.520 --> 32:10.360
that they're losing the fact that they themselves are Chrome users.

32:10.360 --> 32:11.360
Yeah.

32:11.360 --> 32:19.880
And Andreas Gal, who was the former CTO of Mozilla, wrote a response to this, well, not

32:19.880 --> 32:26.800
really a response, but kind of a follow up article looking at the numbers of market share.

32:26.800 --> 32:30.880
And it does not look good for Firefox at all.

32:30.880 --> 32:36.860
You basically got two graphs, one going up and one going down, and Chrome is the one

32:36.860 --> 32:37.860
going up.

32:37.860 --> 32:41.280
And it doesn't really matter which way you look at it.

32:41.280 --> 32:43.120
People are not using Firefox anymore.

32:43.120 --> 32:46.360
There are a small number of us still out there and I still use it.

32:46.360 --> 32:51.080
I'm using it right now to look at this blog post, but I am in the minority.

32:51.080 --> 32:52.080
Yeah.

32:52.080 --> 32:56.800
He says at the macro level, it's safe to say that Chrome is eating the entire browser market.

32:56.800 --> 32:59.480
Everyone else except for Safari is getting obliterated.

32:59.480 --> 33:03.480
Safari is treading water as Apple sells iOS devices.

33:03.480 --> 33:08.720
If the six year trend holds, IE should be pretty much dead in two or three years.

33:08.720 --> 33:11.860
And Firefox is not faring much better, unfortunately.

33:11.860 --> 33:16.540
It's headed towards a two to three percent market share if the trends hold.

33:16.540 --> 33:23.160
Now this, like Joe said, not only was he the CTO, but he was pretty much the head guy behind

33:23.160 --> 33:25.680
the Firefox OS project.

33:25.680 --> 33:31.280
So he really helped bring it to scale and he's coming at this now with perspective of

33:31.280 --> 33:36.600
a failed project and he says, look at our Firefox usage on Android, where mobile is

33:36.600 --> 33:39.800
now a huge part of the web usage.

33:39.800 --> 33:43.840
Firefox and Firefox Focus on Android have close to zero percent market share.

33:43.840 --> 33:44.840
Yeah.

33:44.840 --> 33:46.080
Now I have Firefox on Android.

33:46.080 --> 33:47.080
Me too.

33:47.080 --> 33:53.160
But I just use it for sites that I want to be logged into different accounts of basically.

33:53.160 --> 33:54.160
Yeah.

33:54.160 --> 33:55.640
You're not using it for your daily driving.

33:55.640 --> 33:58.160
No, I've tried and it's just terrible.

33:58.160 --> 33:59.640
And what does that do for Mozilla's agenda?

33:59.640 --> 34:01.440
That doesn't help them set the web agenda.

34:01.440 --> 34:05.120
That doesn't help them drive Firefox adoption really.

34:05.120 --> 34:06.320
They need daily users.

34:06.320 --> 34:09.040
Yeah, which I still am on the desktop.

34:09.040 --> 34:14.120
I had to install Chrome the other day to use Hangouts and I think that's a big factor here.

34:14.120 --> 34:18.880
To use any of Google's products, you basically need Chrome.

34:18.880 --> 34:25.680
For example, Maps basically doesn't work in Firefox anymore and just crashes constantly.

34:25.680 --> 34:32.600
And you can't use Hangouts at all because the plugin isn't supported anymore.

34:32.600 --> 34:36.640
Firefox and Drive seems to work reasonably well in Firefox, but if you're going to engage

34:36.640 --> 34:41.120
with Google's services, you basically need their browser.

34:41.120 --> 34:45.960
And I don't know if that is them deliberately making it not work in Firefox, but there's

34:45.960 --> 34:50.800
two ways you can look at it, either the conspiracy that they've made it deliberately shit in

34:50.800 --> 34:57.040
Firefox or the reality they don't care about Firefox and they don't bother testing it.

34:57.040 --> 34:59.080
As long as it works in Chrome, they're happy.

34:59.080 --> 35:03.240
I speculate it's because it's using standards that Google has proposed, but the industry

35:03.240 --> 35:04.640
hasn't quite adopted yet.

35:04.640 --> 35:08.360
And eventually Firefox is sort of reluctantly drug into adopting the standards so that way

35:08.360 --> 35:10.360
they're compatible with the Google product.

35:10.360 --> 35:14.340
I don't even think though it's so much that Google has great services that work better

35:14.340 --> 35:15.340
under Chrome.

35:15.340 --> 35:18.840
I think that's probably definitely part of it for adoption in businesses and things like

35:18.840 --> 35:19.840
that.

35:19.840 --> 35:26.040
But like Andrea says here in the post, Firefox was really Mozilla's effort to drive the web

35:26.040 --> 35:27.480
by building a browser.

35:27.480 --> 35:32.160
And they were actually making pretty good headway on that until mobile exploded and

35:32.160 --> 35:38.160
the browser came baked into the OS at a whole new level and they completely lost their leverage.

35:38.160 --> 35:43.240
And now the web, like you look at our own download stats for this show, Android far

35:43.240 --> 35:46.720
and away blows away the desktop downloads.

35:46.720 --> 35:53.680
And in fact, iOS, if I recall, is still well above the actual desktop download statistics

35:53.680 --> 35:54.680
for this show.

35:54.680 --> 35:59.120
Which is a bit of a surprise, isn't it? You'd think that there'd be a lot of people listening

35:59.120 --> 36:01.320
on Linux desktops, but apparently not.

36:01.320 --> 36:03.320
They're listening on the go, Joe, they're listening on the go.

36:03.320 --> 36:06.720
And so they download on their mobile device, which is when they're checking the web on

36:06.720 --> 36:08.080
their mobile device, it's the same thing.

36:08.080 --> 36:10.080
And I think there's just a lot more of that happening now.

36:10.080 --> 36:15.860
Our stats have shown that transition and Firefox has no hold there.

36:15.860 --> 36:19.840
It's really the dominant players either going to be Safari or Chrome or whatever the built

36:19.840 --> 36:20.840
in browser.

36:20.840 --> 36:24.720
He makes a good point that that strategy was working for Mozilla until that little fact

36:24.720 --> 36:25.840
came along.

36:25.840 --> 36:29.600
That's why they were so compelled to try Firefox OS, it was just too late.

36:29.600 --> 36:30.600
Yeah.

36:30.600 --> 36:37.800
But even in enterprise, Gartner came out and said that Chrome is one of the biggest browsers

36:37.800 --> 36:39.840
in enterprise now.

36:39.840 --> 36:46.880
Most companies still use IE for some things, but they also have Chrome and Firefox is just

36:46.880 --> 36:48.580
not going to be an option, is it?

36:48.580 --> 36:54.960
Think about it, if you were setting up someone else, I am setting up a laptop to give away

36:54.960 --> 37:00.720
to someone who doesn't really use much more than a browser.

37:00.720 --> 37:03.720
And so I'm sticking Zubuntu on there for him.

37:03.720 --> 37:09.320
And Chrome because I know if I give someone Chrome, every website's going to work, YouTube's

37:09.320 --> 37:12.080
going to work, everything's going to work perfectly.

37:12.080 --> 37:16.240
Whereas I could put Firefox on there and then have to support them.

37:16.240 --> 37:21.640
Yeah, I know for myself, my transition to Chrome definitely was firm when it was the

37:21.640 --> 37:23.300
easiest way to get Netflix.

37:23.300 --> 37:27.200
And that's when I also transitioned fully from Chromium as well is a couple of other

37:27.200 --> 37:32.360
sites I go to don't work well under Chromium, work fine under Chrome, like Spotify web player,

37:32.360 --> 37:33.360
for example.

37:33.360 --> 37:38.640
And so over the last year and a half, where I used to really be a dual browser Firefox

37:38.640 --> 37:42.640
Chrome guy, and now I'm Chrome and I'm Chrome private session and I have stuff logged in

37:42.640 --> 37:46.480
or personas even, and I really barely use Firefox anymore.

37:46.480 --> 37:50.240
And it makes me sad because I think it's a solid browser and I'd love to see Mozilla

37:50.240 --> 37:53.900
around for the long haul and I'd love to even see them be influential, but for the services

37:53.900 --> 37:57.800
I use on a literally daily basis, Chrome seems to be better.

37:57.800 --> 38:02.080
And I would argue, Joe, that it doesn't really matter.

38:02.080 --> 38:07.620
This battle is maybe over, but the war for other aspects of the internet and the web

38:07.620 --> 38:09.720
in general does rage on.

38:09.720 --> 38:14.220
And it seems possible for Firefox to continue on as a desktop browser doing just fine and

38:14.220 --> 38:19.800
for Mozilla as a company to find new areas where somebody needs to blaze standards and

38:19.800 --> 38:23.240
blaze innovation where they've done successfully well in the past.

38:23.240 --> 38:26.100
They just essentially need to be ready for the next round of technology whenever that

38:26.100 --> 38:27.400
comes so they can be a player.

38:27.400 --> 38:29.600
Well, let's hope so.

38:29.600 --> 38:32.000
So shall we end with a bit of positive news then?

38:32.000 --> 38:37.240
Yeah, I'm really excited to see some progress for Core Boot specifically coming out of Purism.

38:37.240 --> 38:42.280
They have Librem 13 version 2 and 15 version 3 working with Core Boot now.

38:42.280 --> 38:45.760
Yeah, it's great to see that they've got a couple of machines now that they're going

38:45.760 --> 38:52.440
to ship in June, which are actually going to come with Core Boot all being well.

38:52.440 --> 38:55.340
Which was their original promise, wasn't it?

38:55.340 --> 38:56.780
Free software top to bottom.

38:56.780 --> 38:59.000
And a genuine competitive differentiator.

38:59.000 --> 39:01.600
Yeah, I was very skeptical though at first.

39:01.600 --> 39:02.880
I was very skeptical of Todd.

39:02.880 --> 39:06.760
He talks a good game and I just thought it was absolutely impossible.

39:06.760 --> 39:11.420
But fair play to him, he's worked very hard on this and for a very long time.

39:11.420 --> 39:15.240
And they've managed to disable the management engine and stuff.

39:15.240 --> 39:18.520
And they seem to really be putting the money where the mouth is.

39:18.520 --> 39:22.800
These machines are pretty expensive for what they are, but it seems that that money has

39:22.800 --> 39:29.560
been invested back into making them actually run Core Boot.

39:29.560 --> 39:33.680
And that's got to be better than some proprietary EFI.

39:33.680 --> 39:37.320
The other thing that's cool to see is this sort of pushes the competition up a level

39:37.320 --> 39:38.320
in the market.

39:38.320 --> 39:42.120
So maybe other manufacturers might be more compelled to try to get this working on their

39:42.120 --> 39:43.120
systems.

39:43.120 --> 39:45.540
It gets more people using Core Boot, which is good.

39:45.540 --> 39:50.360
And it does give people who are seriously dedicated to this kind of system an option

39:50.360 --> 39:52.040
besides a four-year-old ThinkPad.

39:52.040 --> 39:54.560
Yeah, or a Chromebook, of course.

39:54.560 --> 39:56.560
Yeah, who wouldn't want that?

39:56.560 --> 40:02.240
I don't think the type of customer that wants a Librem is going to compromise with a Chromebook.

40:02.240 --> 40:05.280
Although who wants to pesky with all that weird Chromebook issues when you're trying

40:05.280 --> 40:06.280
to run Linux?

40:06.280 --> 40:07.800
Yeah, which I have.

40:07.800 --> 40:08.800
Unless you want...

40:08.800 --> 40:09.800
What's that?

40:09.800 --> 40:10.800
I can't remember what the disk drive...

40:10.800 --> 40:14.280
That's how long it's been since I've even used that machine.

40:14.280 --> 40:17.640
There's Crouton, which you can use inside Chrome OS, which seems like not a bad way

40:17.640 --> 40:18.640
to go.

40:18.640 --> 40:20.120
Yeah, I didn't even bother with that.

40:20.120 --> 40:25.320
I just went straight for Gallium OS, which is an XFCE-based disk drive.

40:25.320 --> 40:28.560
It's basically Xubuntu, but working on the Chromebook.

40:28.560 --> 40:29.560
Yeah, Gallium.

40:29.560 --> 40:30.840
I remember that now.

40:30.840 --> 40:32.360
I completely forgot about Gallium.

40:32.360 --> 40:35.480
Crouton's nice if you don't want to mess with the whole thing and you predominantly use

40:35.480 --> 40:39.480
Chrome OS and just need to go to Ubuntu, but Gallium would be a great way to go if your

40:39.480 --> 40:41.000
daily driver is going to be Linux.

40:41.000 --> 40:48.280
Yeah, and the battery on my Chromebook is so good that I used to use it for media consumption

40:48.280 --> 40:49.280
quite a lot.

40:49.280 --> 40:53.520
But yeah, I need to dig that out and start using it again, I think.

40:53.520 --> 40:57.320
