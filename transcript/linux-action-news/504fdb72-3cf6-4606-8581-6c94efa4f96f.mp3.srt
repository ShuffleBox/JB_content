00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,400
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, our weekly take on Linux and the open source world.

2
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:21,200
This is episode 36, recorded on January 14th, 2018.

3
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:22,200
I'm Chris.

4
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:23,200
And I'm Joe.

5
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:24,200
Hello, Joe.

6
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:26,000
Good to be connected with you again.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,040
Sounds like it's going to be the spring of open source in Barcelona.

8
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:36,400
Yeah, so we had bad news last year about Munich, but now we've got good news regarding Barcelona.

9
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:41,580
It looks like they are going to first switch to using open source applications and then

10
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:46,880
replace Windows with Linux, which is exactly the right way they should be doing it.

11
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:51,320
And hopefully it's going to be done properly this time and will be a shining example to

12
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:53,240
other governments around the world.

13
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:57,200
I do think it has a good chance of that, because from my read, they seem to be going about

14
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:58,200
this the right way.

15
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:03,440
The city has plans for 70% of its software budget to be invested in open source software

16
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:04,680
in the coming year.

17
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:10,600
They're creating a transition period, which will come to an end in the spring of 2019.

18
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:14,960
And the city of Barcelona will start outsourcing IT projects to local small and medium sized

19
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:15,960
enterprises.

20
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:19,000
So it's going to be a boost for local IT businesses as well.

21
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,960
They'll come in, help them set up new infrastructure.

22
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:25,440
They'll also be talking to 65 new developers to build different software programs that

23
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:28,120
they need to be moved over to these new systems.

24
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:31,900
Yeah, and crucially, that will end up open source, won't it, rather than the usual case

25
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:33,720
of it being proprietary.

26
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:36,540
And they're going with a mainline Linux distro.

27
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:38,840
They're going to be using Ubuntu.

28
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:44,920
And they have already been trialing about 1000 Ubuntu desktops as a lead up to this.

29
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:45,920
They're not going their own way.

30
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:50,320
They're not going to go build their own distribution where they have their own version of LibreOffice.

31
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:52,200
They're going with standard stuff.

32
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:56,740
And they'll also be switching to Firefox and LibreOffice in place of Internet Explorer

33
00:01:56,740 --> 00:01:58,620
and Microsoft Office.

34
00:01:58,620 --> 00:02:03,400
It's as if they looked at what Munich did and just decided, well, let's not do any of

35
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:04,400
that.

36
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:05,400
Let's do it properly.

37
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:08,240
Let's listen to what people criticize Munich for doing.

38
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:10,840
And hopefully, this is now going to be the new poster child.

39
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:15,720
Yeah, maybe one of the benefits of Munich's switch and then now eventual switch away from

40
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:21,920
Linux being so in the public is it gave other places an opportunity to learn.

41
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:22,920
That's a decent silver lining.

42
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:25,120
Well, there had to be one, didn't there?

43
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:30,920
Well, Joe, after a year and a half of development, the Nextcloud project seems to be very excited

44
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:33,040
to announce Nextcloud Talk.

45
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:37,540
Yeah, we've kind of seen this coming, haven't we, because of the partnership with Spreed.

46
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:43,280
And it's essentially integrating those type of services into Nextcloud.

47
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:47,760
And so now it's available for the Nextcloud 13 beta.

48
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:52,360
It's not available in the version 12, the stable version at the moment, but it's pretty

49
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:56,040
easy to install it, especially if you've got snaps available.

50
00:02:56,040 --> 00:03:01,960
I checked this out by installing Ubuntu Server and just didn't install any extras apart from

51
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:10,840
Open SSH, SSH DIN, pseudo snap install, Nextcloud, dash dash, edge to get the 13 beta.

52
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:14,640
Few seconds later, Nextcloud's up and running, all the databases set up and everything.

53
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:16,400
I was really, really impressed by that.

54
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:19,840
I was able to check it out just with virtually no effort at all.

55
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,280
Yeah, I did the same thing.

56
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,280
That was amazing.

57
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:29,360
I did a clean install of Ubuntu on a droplet, and then I snap installed the Nextcloud dash

58
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:32,520
dash edge, like you mentioned, and within moments it's up and running.

59
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:36,800
And on top of that, there's easy ways to configure certain settings inside the snap, like the

60
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:41,160
SSL port or increasing the PHP memory limit.

61
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:44,400
They're just easy, simple snap commands that make all the adjustments.

62
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,400
So I kicked the tires.

63
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:47,500
I was pretty interested in this.

64
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:51,480
It's offering something that the open source world desperately needs.

65
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:56,640
First of all, it's built around cool tech using H.265 based video encoding, they say.

66
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:01,280
The main features are really the independence that it brings you.

67
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:06,920
It's self-hosted real-time VoIP communication, even with mobile apps that will send push

68
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:09,480
notifications so you can answer on a mobile app.

69
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:14,000
So aside from the fact that they're using cool encoding technology and that it's 100%

70
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,820
private and all the calls are peer-to-peer encrypted, they're promising something big

71
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:21,240
here because it's a collaboration tool, too.

72
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:25,240
It's a real potential Slack killer if they can pull it all off because you can bring

73
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:29,680
in your calendar, your contacts, your synced files, all the things that Nextcloud's good

74
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:34,760
at and you can bring them into this real-time video chat environment and just collaborate

75
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:36,200
the hell out of stuff.

76
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:41,960
He said the word if there and it is a big if because, okay, this is new, it only runs

77
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:49,080
on the beta version of Nextcloud server, but I just could not get these mobile apps to

78
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,080
work.

79
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:55,320
I installed it on a couple of my tablets and tried to get a chat going and this is all

80
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:56,320
on my LAN.

81
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:59,960
I wasn't even going out to the internet and it just would not work.

82
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:02,920
It was just black screens and just nothing happening.

83
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:09,280
That said, in the browser on a proper laptop, it was working fine and I tested that out

84
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:15,680
and it was minimal lag and all the rest of it as you'd expect over the LAN, but I think

85
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:21,240
it's disappointing that they've made this big fanfare about it and yet you install the

86
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:22,720
mobile apps and just nothing.

87
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:25,720
I mean, did you try the mobile apps as well as the desktop?

88
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:26,880
I only tried the desktop.

89
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:32,000
I'm not a huge fan of the Nextcloud mobile app right now, so it's particularly worse

90
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,360
on iOS in my opinion than it is on Android, so I don't bother with it, but I would consider

91
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:37,360
giving it another go.

92
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:40,960
It's been a while, so I might, Joe, I might give it another go before I take down the

93
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:44,720
Nextcloud instance because I probably should check in on it, but the promise is big.

94
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:48,800
The idea that you could get a push notification to your phone and answer a video call on your

95
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:53,360
mobile device, I'm always looking for ways to not use the phone system, so I like that

96
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:54,980
and it's self-hosted.

97
00:05:54,980 --> 00:06:00,840
My problem was it seemed to be rather unreliable in Chrome, and I ended up having to switch

98
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:01,840
to Firefox to use it.

99
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:02,840
Fair enough.

100
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:03,840
That's fine.

101
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:06,360
I don't mind, but I was a little disappointed because a lot of the people I would be calling

102
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:11,440
would be in Chrome, and so I may try to recreate some of that and see if I maybe had something

103
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:12,440
wrong.

104
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:17,080
Maybe it was an extension conflict too, but I found it to be early.

105
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:20,760
It's got the beta label, but the backend technology, the fact that it's based on the stuff that

106
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:25,040
Spreeds worked on, well, Spreeds is a pretty legit operation that hosts some really large

107
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:29,300
video conferencing solutions, so it seems like the fundamental core technology should

108
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:30,360
be there.

109
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:33,560
The stuff around it just might need more time to bake.

110
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:36,580
Yeah, and it is definitely something we need, as you said.

111
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:39,880
We need something that is totally self-hosted.

112
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:44,980
That said, if you want to pay them for enterprise solutions, they can do that, but the kind

113
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:48,880
of people who are listening to this, certainly me, I could easily spin it up on a droplet

114
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:54,840
and get it going, and maybe we could potentially move away from using things like Mumble and

115
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:58,040
Discord, but I think it is a little bit early at this stage.

116
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:01,400
I think we're looking at another few months at least before we can do that.

117
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:07,560
They also promised the possibility of connecting it to a SIP bridge, and that brings in a lot

118
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:11,000
of possibilities in a podcast network for looping in random guests that might be on

119
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:15,000
the phone, but for a business, you're doing a conference call, everybody's on, and you

120
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,620
need to bring somebody in over a SIP connection, which could be a landline.

121
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:20,080
That could be a great feature.

122
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:24,520
So there's some stuff they're doing in here, and Frank blogged about this a little bit

123
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:29,800
recently and talked a little bit about where they're going, and you can find that on Frank's

124
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:35,720
blog, just Google search for Frank Karleszek, and read through his plans for the future

125
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:36,720
of this.

126
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:37,720
I like where they're going.

127
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:41,840
I like that it's all open source, and now we just sit back and wait for it to bake and

128
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:42,840
get polished.

129
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:45,960
Yeah, no doubt Noah's going to be all over this.

130
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:51,300
One thing I was surprised to see you all over is Google AMP, and I'm actually really glad

131
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:54,040
we're slotting this in the show, because it's something I've been thinking a lot about in

132
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:57,000
the last couple of weeks, and it looks like Google is trying to make some improvements

133
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
to AMP.

134
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,300
Yeah, it's something I've been thinking about for a couple of years, actually, since it

135
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:05,000
first launched, and I became aware of it.

136
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:10,840
If you don't know what it is, it's accelerated mobile pages, and what it means is pre-cached

137
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:18,640
and pre-loaded mobile web pages hosted by Google, hosting other people's content, which

138
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:21,760
from a user perspective makes it amazing.

139
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:27,880
You search for something, you see an article, you click on it, instantly it's open, and

140
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:28,880
you can start reading.

141
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:33,120
There's none of this waiting for images to load, and it's all really optimized.

142
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:35,740
From a user perspective, I have no complaints.

143
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:37,640
The technology is awesome.

144
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:39,520
It works really, really well.

145
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:42,520
However, there is a key problem with it.

146
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:49,360
All of the files, the HTML files and everything, are hosted on Google servers.

147
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:53,480
People do a Google search, and then they go to what is essentially a Google site, even

148
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:57,040
though it might be from a newspaper, The Guardian or whatever.

149
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:03,520
It's actually hosted on Google servers, and that keeps people trapped in the Google bubble,

150
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:05,920
the Google infrastructure.

151
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:11,160
A lot of web developers have come together recently and written an open letter saying

152
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:14,920
that they're not happy about that.

153
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:20,560
Google have made some changes, but I don't think they've gone far enough with those changes.

154
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:25,600
By far the largest complaint is that AMP takes over your URLs.

155
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:29,080
When the user looks at the URL of the website in the web browser, they're not seeing your

156
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:33,600
website name, and publishers hate that.

157
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:38,280
Google writes in their AMP blog, and pay attention to the language that they chose to use it.

158
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:40,840
It feels like they're trying to come across as folksy.

159
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:47,400
They write, we are huge fans of meaningful URLs, ourselves, and we recognize that the

160
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:51,320
situation isn't ideal, and many of y'all agree.

161
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:55,560
It's certainly the number one piece of feedback we hear about for AMP.

162
00:09:55,560 --> 00:10:00,880
We embarked on a multi-month long effort, and today we finally feel confident that we

163
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:06,320
found a solution, as recommended by the W3C tag, we intend to implement a new version

164
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:11,160
of AMP caching based on an emerging web packet standard.

165
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:15,240
So it's good to see them trying to fix this number one problem, the URL problem, and as

166
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:20,560
a user I do like AMP pages, it's great that they load fast, but as a publisher, I hate

167
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:21,560
it.

168
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:23,280
I hate it with a passion.

169
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:28,840
It is poison for the web, it centralizes the web around Google search, it presumes that

170
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:34,840
the entire world only uses Google search, and it removes independence from publishers.

171
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:37,000
It's taking away publishers independence.

172
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:41,840
It would be like somebody re-hosting all of our podcasts on their infrastructure.

173
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:46,000
You wouldn't get any of the metrics, they re-encode the file and it sounds like crap,

174
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,320
like Stitcher does this, and I hate it.

175
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:56,440
And this is what Google's doing to the entire web, and it's also the wrong solution.

176
00:10:56,440 --> 00:11:02,120
The real solution is for publishers to make their websites better and make their websites

177
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,120
faster.

178
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,120
That's the solution.

179
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:08,480
This is a hack to that that centralizes control around Google.

180
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:14,040
It moves the web in Google, takes independence away from publishers, and doesn't actually

181
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:17,160
address the core problem that people just need to build better websites.

182
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:21,080
Yeah, and this huge list of web developers have said that there's nothing wrong with

183
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:25,520
prioritizing fast loading sites in search results.

184
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:30,120
That's a good thing, but they're saying that you shouldn't have to be locked into Google's

185
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:31,280
infrastructure to do that.

186
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:36,900
You should be able to implement your own solutions and, as you say, make your websites better,

187
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:44,600
not have these huge JavaScript-laden beasts of websites that on mobile can take, especially

188
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:51,380
if you've got a fairly flaky 3G signal, they can take minutes sometimes to load.

189
00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:57,440
And supposedly mobile-optimized sites, you must have been experiencing this for years.

190
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:02,520
That's why I can see why you're a bit torn on it, because you are on mobile internet

191
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:04,240
most of the time, aren't you?

192
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:06,760
So AMP must be amazing for you.

193
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:08,540
There are little things that bug me about it.

194
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:11,100
It doesn't scroll right in my web browser.

195
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:12,600
There's things like that, but you're right.

196
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:16,080
Overall, it's a nice thing to have.

197
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:20,680
If you could just choose where everything got cached, like if I could implement AMP

198
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:24,800
for Jupyter broadcasting, but say that all of the cache comes from Scale Engine, well,

199
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,680
then I'm a lot happier.

200
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:30,600
And maybe that will happen one day, but you have to keep in mind the core thing Google's

201
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:32,480
offering is performance.

202
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:35,200
And the best way they can offer that is by hosting the content.

203
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:39,880
Oh, and by the way, it also happens to work, they can kind of insert some ads here and

204
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:40,880
there.

205
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:41,880
But don't pay too much attention to that.

206
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:44,200
And, you know, it's not about the ads.

207
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:45,200
Not about the ads.

208
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:50,120
Yeah, not to mention that they can see every single webpage that you're looking at and

209
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:52,840
build up even more profile about you.

210
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:55,080
And it always comes back to the same thing.

211
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:58,480
They're an ad agency, and they want to serve you relevant ads.

212
00:12:58,480 --> 00:12:59,920
Let's just try a thought experiment, Joe.

213
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:02,720
What if Mozilla was rolling something like this out?

214
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,800
Would some of these concerns be alleviated?

215
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,200
Some of them.

216
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:11,920
But if Mozilla were rolling it out, then I would like to see them offer a self-hosted

217
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:18,240
solution for people like us, you know, at Jupyter broadcasting, as you say, using something

218
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,240
like Scale Engine.

219
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:23,880
Right, because if Google is prioritizing faster websites regardless in the search results,

220
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:25,920
then it sort of washes itself out in the marketplace.

221
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:30,840
Get your site fast enough, and even if you're self-hosting your AMP site, or whatever Mozilla

222
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:34,080
would call it, as long as you're fast enough, then you get listed in the search results

223
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:35,080
high.

224
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:39,000
Yeah, but even if you were relying completely on Mozilla, I would rather trust them than

225
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,800
Google.

226
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:43,800
DigitalOcean.com.

227
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:47,000
Go over there, create an account, and then apply our promo code, here's the thing, and

228
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:52,560
you get a $10 credit, and then you can get a rig spun up in less than 55 seconds.

229
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:54,240
Their base rate is $5 a month.

230
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:57,320
So you could run that thing two months for free with our promo code.

231
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:59,180
DigitalOcean is an all SSD cloud.

232
00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:02,760
Every system you deploy, from the $5 a month one to the one that's hundreds of gigs of

233
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:05,080
RAM, it's all using SSDs.

234
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:06,760
You can increase the storage.

235
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:09,800
You can also add things like block storage and object storage.

236
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:14,320
They have a really simple API, but my favorite feature of DigitalOcean, you know what it

237
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:16,120
is, is the dashboard.

238
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:20,040
DigitalOcean.com, use our promo code, here's the thing, spin up a machine, and try out

239
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:22,160
the new Nextcloud 13.

240
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:25,340
In less than 55 seconds, you can have an Ubuntu system ready.

241
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:29,520
You SSH into it, and then you use the snap that we mentioned earlier, and I would bet

242
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:33,960
within about five minutes, you could be trying out Nextcloud 13 and the new Nextcloud Talk

243
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:34,960
plugin.

244
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:36,060
The pricing's super straightforward.

245
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:40,040
My favorite machine is three cents an hour, two gigs of RAM, two CPUs, 40 gigabytes of

246
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:43,000
SSD, and three terabytes of transfer.

247
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
DigitalOcean.com.

248
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Create an account.

249
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,120
Use our promo code, here's the thing.

250
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:49,600
A big thank you to DigitalOcean for sponsoring Linux Action News.

251
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:50,600
DigitalOcean.com.

252
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:52,640
Promo code, here's the thing.

253
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:57,760
Okay, so Ubuntu 17.10.

254
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:01,320
This is a story that I'd kind of been avoiding really because I thought that it wasn't a

255
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:02,960
very big deal.

256
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:09,500
So before Christmas, Canonical pulled the link to the 17.10 ISO and told people just

257
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:11,720
use the LTS instead for now.

258
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:15,480
And that was because of an issue with the UEFI on certain laptops.

259
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:18,800
And I didn't really talk about it much at the time because I thought, well, it's going

260
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:20,400
to be fixed soon.

261
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:27,080
But here we are in the second week of January, and it's only finally been fixed.

262
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:32,920
And so they've put up this new 17.10.1 ISO image.

263
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:38,880
And so that's been fixed kind of, and it just surprises me that it took so long.

264
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:44,320
I think that Meltdown and Spectre have a lot to do with why it took so long, but at least

265
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:45,320
it's fixed now.

266
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:46,720
Yeah, that's just what I was going to say.

267
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:51,680
I bet they're working on 17.10, this bug comes up, they go, okay, we got some problem.

268
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:55,880
Certain laptops, we have the SPI kernel driver turned on, we got to re-spin this with that

269
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:59,120
thing turned off, we got to come up with a software fix for people that have bricked

270
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,120
their laptops.

271
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:04,400
You know, kind of a hectic moment, pull the links, and then boom, you're hit with Meltdown

272
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:07,220
and Spectre in the middle of all of this.

273
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:08,220
And it's the holidays.

274
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:12,280
So people are going away for the holidays, they're traveling, it's New Year's.

275
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:16,760
It's just the worst time to be hit with two things like this, that you don't plan for

276
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:17,760
this kind of stuff.

277
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:21,960
It's not like you just have dozens of developers standing by ready to leap into action.

278
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:23,460
They're all doing something else.

279
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:27,160
They already have a day job, they're already working on the next release.

280
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:31,560
It must have been a crazy stressful time over at Canonical during the holidays.

281
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:32,560
Yeah.

282
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:36,480
But I've heard some criticism that, well, if all they had to do was disable the driver,

283
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:39,560
why did it take them a couple of weeks to do this?

284
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:40,560
Three weeks, nearly.

285
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:42,580
Yeah, I suppose that's a good question.

286
00:16:42,580 --> 00:16:48,760
And these respins, the 17.10.1 ISOs, don't have the Meltdown patch in there.

287
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:49,760
They're still vulnerable.

288
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:51,320
You have to update them immediately after you install them.

289
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:53,120
Yeah, that was a bit of a surprise, really.

290
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:57,240
But I suppose it's not that hard to update straight after installing.

291
00:16:57,240 --> 00:17:01,200
But it has somewhat killed the momentum, maybe, for 17.10, hasn't it?

292
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:08,680
Because obviously it's got the new GNOME desktop and everything, and 17.04 was fast approaching

293
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:09,680
end of life.

294
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:12,680
So there would be a lot of people looking to upgrade.

295
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:17,240
And I suppose most people would do a sort of in-place upgrade rather than a fresh install

296
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:18,240
from the ISO.

297
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:22,480
But it was really bad timing for them, this, I think.

298
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:23,480
I agree.

299
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:30,000
And the SPI kernel driver serial peripheral interface, easy for me to say, is a really,

300
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:36,200
really basic, doesn't require any kind of crazy logic, shouldn't have really been a

301
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:37,200
big problem.

302
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:39,400
But of course, it was a combination of factors.

303
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:40,880
And it's really basic stuff.

304
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:43,680
A lot of people were giving Canonical a hard time for turning that driver on, because I

305
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:46,280
believe it is marked experimental upstream.

306
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:48,400
And a lot of people were giving them a hard time.

307
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:53,760
So I read up on the kernel documentation about the SPI kernel driver, and I'm shocked that

308
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:55,280
it was able to cause this problem, really.

309
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:56,280
It's super basic.

310
00:17:56,280 --> 00:18:00,040
And if you want interesting reading after the show, go Google the SPI kernel driver,

311
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:01,960
and have a good read.

312
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:06,200
Well presumably you weren't reading about it on LKML.org this week.

313
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:11,560
Oh man, have the BSD guys been giving me a hard time about this story, Joe.

314
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:15,240
We actually noticed for TechSnap, because we were researching stuff for Spectre and

315
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:17,640
Meltdown, and the Linux kernel mailing list was not loading.

316
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:20,000
I had to go to archive.org to get this stuff.

317
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,760
And I thought, okay, well, you know, Meltdown's a huge story right now.

318
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:25,920
Maybe a lot of people are reading the mailing list trying to piece together a history.

319
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:26,920
Nope.

320
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:27,920
Nope.

321
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:28,920
That's not what it was at all.

322
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:29,920
Nope.

323
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:30,920
Nope.

324
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:31,920
It was the last thing I expected.

325
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:38,520
It's because the back end was hosted in Jasper Span's house, and he's out on vacation, which

326
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:41,440
looked like a really nice vacation, and he lost power.

327
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:42,920
And the system rebooted.

328
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:44,200
And it wouldn't boot back up.

329
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:49,600
And then to add insult to injury, that power outage took out his motherboard, and that

330
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:54,600
meant that he had no machine, even when he got back, he couldn't get it going again.

331
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:59,840
So I think he still, as we record this, are syncing data up to a VPS.

332
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:05,560
You know, the funny thing in this story, too, is it sits behind the Linux kernel mailing

333
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:11,240
list, sits behind a layer of Cloudflare, then a layer at DigitalOcean, which is where a

334
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:18,160
lot of the front end aspects of the website are stored, and then, then at Jasper's house.

335
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:24,520
So it's like a three-layer dip of hosting, but the core fundamental, like, huge amount

336
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:28,280
of emails, like the gigs and gigs and gigs and gigs of years of emails, that's at his

337
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:29,280
house.

338
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:33,040
And so there's other caches, you can still, there's other official caches that are online

339
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:36,420
right now that you can go read, but Jasper's was down.

340
00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:40,680
And as we are recording at this moment, I think he's, he's about halfway through the

341
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:44,680
other thing, but now he's going to a VPS.

342
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:48,160
Yeah, and so it's really just the archive of this, isn't it?

343
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:50,840
It's not interrupting any work that's happening.

344
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:53,220
The actual mailing list itself is still working.

345
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:57,920
It's just this huge archive that people like us link to and read.

346
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:58,920
Yeah.

347
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:03,400
And as you say, there are other archives of it, but this is really the go-to for most

348
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:04,400
people.

349
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:09,160
So it's a huge surprise that a key part of that infrastructure was hosted in someone's

350
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:10,160
home.

351
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:11,160
Oh yeah.

352
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:14,540
I heard about it from the BSD guys out there in the audience, and our own Alan Jude was

353
00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:20,080
giving me a hard time in the back channel about how BSD hosted on this massive data

354
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:23,520
center infrastructure that's very fancy.

355
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:27,840
And I will note that Jasper got a lot of offers via Twitter.

356
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:31,680
You can just go read his feed from a bunch of different hosting providers that are saying

357
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:33,240
we will host it for you.

358
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:35,600
We would be happy to host that for you.

359
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:38,520
He doesn't seem to be too inclined to take any of them up on that offer.

360
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:41,840
Maybe he's trying to be sort of politically safe with the Linux kernel mailing list, but

361
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:44,800
he's got a lot of offers rolling in right now to host it.

362
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:49,360
It just reminds me of that quote, we're not going to be big and professional like GNU.

363
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:52,280
Well this is kind of proving that, isn't it?

364
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:53,280
I suppose so.

365
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:56,560
Although at the same time, doesn't it seem like ARM's getting a little more professional?

366
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:57,560
Fedora seems to have taken note.

367
00:20:57,560 --> 00:20:58,560
Yeah.

368
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:04,760
So it's looking like the next version of Fedora 28 will promote ARM to be a primary architecture.

369
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:09,000
It's not for sure, but it is looking good, I think, that that is going to happen.

370
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,140
But it's only for the server version.

371
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:15,000
It's not for the workstation, which kind of makes sense, doesn't it?

372
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:20,440
Because not many people are really running a workstation on ARM.

373
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:21,920
What are your thoughts about the Raspberry Pi?

374
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:25,300
Because that's pretty popular for Ubuntu Mate, and they have the Raspberry Pi Foundation

375
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:27,600
now has their spin of Linux.

376
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:31,000
Seems like Fedora would work pretty good on something like that, a nice lean Fedora workstation.

377
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,320
I mean, I see this as a server play.

378
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:37,160
This is clearly a server play for Fedora here, probably an indication of where Red Hat Enterprise

379
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:38,160
is going to go.

380
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:42,760
I mean, still, though, the desktop, you know, the Raspberry Pi is usable.

381
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:44,040
Really?

382
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:45,040
Have you really used it?

383
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:48,840
I mean, no discredit to the work that people like Martin Winpress have done with Ubuntu

384
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:50,340
Mate on it.

385
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:56,680
It's kind of just about usable, but realistically, it is painful to use a Raspberry Pi as a desktop

386
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:57,680
machine.

387
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:59,840
I tend to agree.

388
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:02,960
But it does seem to be something people are doing because it's getting downloaded an awful

389
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:03,960
lot.

390
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:04,960
Yeah, that's true.

391
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:05,960
That's true.

392
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:08,800
You're right that this is where RHEL is headed.

393
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:15,160
And finally, after years of promise, we're getting decent ARM hardware that is data center

394
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:16,440
ready.

395
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:19,920
And so it just makes a lot of sense for Fedora to be leading the charge like this.

396
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:23,520
I wonder if some of the Fedora developers are a little spurred on now by the recent

397
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:25,640
Meltdown Inspector stuff.

398
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:28,520
Maybe just adds a little extra momentum to something like this.

399
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:33,020
Every time I read about Fedora Workstation and Fedora Atomic, I get pretty curious about

400
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:35,160
where they're going specifically with Fedora Atomic.

401
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:39,640
So if you're out there using it as a desktop, let me know how that works at Chris LAS.

402
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:42,160
Can you use flat packs and snaps on Fedora Atomic?

403
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:45,960
I'd love to know at Chris LAS, if people are out there using it as a desktop because it's

404
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:49,840
awfully appealing to me as a production workstation OS.

405
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:52,240
It's certainly not designed that way, is it Atomic?

406
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:54,560
It's very much designed for containerization, isn't it?

407
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:55,560
That's my understanding.

408
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:58,920
But I have seen several people recently mentioned that they're using it as their desktop, that

409
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:01,800
it's early days, but they're trying it out as a desktop.

410
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:02,800
That's fascinating to me.

411
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:06,560
Linux people, they'll just do whatever they want with it.

412
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:08,240
And we'll tell you about it every single week.

413
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:12,640

And go to linuxactionnews.com slash contact for ways to get in touch with us.

415
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:20,420
Yeah, and speaking of Spectre and Meltdown, we did a great rundown and breakdown specifically

416
00:23:20,420 --> 00:23:25,320
on the performance impacts in the latest episode of TechSnap, TechSnap 3.51.

417
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:27,560
You can find that at techsnap.systems.

418
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:29,520
Check out the new TechSnap program.

419
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:33,360
We'll be back next Monday with our weekly take on the latest Linux and open source news.

420
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:34,880
I'm at Chris LAS.

421
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:36,200
I'm at Joe Rissington.

422
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:38,720
Thank you for joining us, and we'll see you next week.

423
00:23:38,720 --> 00:24:01,160
See you later.
