00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,340
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, episode 225, recorded on January 26th, 2022.

2
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:10,340
I'm Chris.

3
00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:11,340
I'm Wes.

4
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:12,340
Hello, Wes.

5
00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:13,880
Let's do the news.

6
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:18,920
We start this week with news that has ramifications for the entire industry.

7
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:23,620
It seems that NVIDIA is looking to abandon its acquisition of ARM.

8
00:00:23,620 --> 00:00:26,880
Or at least, that's what Bloomberg reported on Tuesday.

9
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:32,240
Yeah, it sounds like people that were quote unquote familiar with the matter leaked the

10
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:38,160
information to Bloomberg that internally NVIDIA doesn't expect the deal to be finalized.

11
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:46,240
Now publicly, both NVIDIA and Softbank's spokespersons have relayed that they hold

12
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:51,720
hopes that the deal is completed and that they think it would be great for the industry

13
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:52,920
if the deal was completed.

14
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:58,240
So as far as they are publicly commenting right now, they're still giving an air of

15
00:00:58,240 --> 00:00:59,240
confidence.

16
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:05,840
Of course, but you know, Steele has faced a lot of scrutiny from regulators all over

17
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:06,840
the world.

18
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:11,880
I mean, the US's FTC, British regulators, and even regulators in China.

19
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:15,000
So perhaps this news in some sense isn't all that surprising.

20
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,760
Yeah, I think that is true.

21
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:20,160
I think a lot of us wondered when I know when we talked about it on this show, we're like,

22
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:21,600
is this actually going to happen?

23
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:24,240
Like, I suppose it still could.

24
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:27,320
It seems like though, either way, NVIDIA is going to be out some cash.

25
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:29,160
Yeah, that's right.

26
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:34,520
It's going to be out $2 billion that functioned as a down payment on the transaction.

27
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:41,000
And then we'll also have to pay $1.25 billion USD as something of a breakup fee when it

28
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,360
walks away from the deal.

29
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:44,280
Ah, we've all been there NVIDIA.

30
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:47,640
We've all been there.

31
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:53,120
It seems the Hi-5 unmatched, that small RISC-V board we've told you about in the past.

32
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:56,200
Well, it may be ending production.

33
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:57,200
Noooo!

34
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:01,320
I really wanted to get my hands on one of these.

35
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:07,160
The Si-5 Freedom U740 SoC was a sweet little setup, it seemed.

36
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:12,360
I never got to try one, but you could get it with 16 gigs of RAM, micro SD and an M.2

37
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:18,720
mini-SSC storage, one PCIe 16x slot and Gigabit Ethernet on that thing.

38
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:24,280
But it seems that supply chain issues have made things extremely difficult for the Si-5

39
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:29,400
folks and they have had problem after problem in the last year.

40
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:34,800
And they noted, quote, with such great ecosystem adoption, demand has exceeded our already

41
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,800
high expectations.

42
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:40,400
And we're close to selling out on our production inventory.

43
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:44,120
Given the challenge of supply chain issues that we overcame for the first run of these

44
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:49,640
boards, issues that we continue to face, we've decided to focus on the next generation of

45
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:54,840
Si-5 Hi-5 development systems rather than trying to put together another build of the

46
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:58,440
Hi-5 unmatched platform in 2022.

47
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:03,560
Those remarks came from Phil Dworsky, the Global Head of Strategic Alliances for Si-5,

48
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:08,920
and he finished his comments up by saying, quote, our sincere apologies to anyone wanting

49
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:14,040
a Si-5 Hi-5 unmatched board who hasn't been able to obtain one.

50
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:17,520
Please stay tuned for news on the next generation system soon.

51
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:21,360
This seems pretty understandable, especially with the supply chain issues going on and

52
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:25,040
smaller manufacturers sort of suffer the worst.

53
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:32,560
But I do have to admit, it does raise a red flag with me when a hardware vendor comes

54
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:38,840
out and says, hey, I know you were expecting this, but we were so successful.

55
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:41,280
We can't actually deliver.

56
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:45,920
And so because we're so successful, we're going to scrap that really successful thing

57
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:49,660
and do something completely different that we don't have a timeline for and can't give

58
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:52,840
you an estimate on for a really long time.

59
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:54,640
But trust us, it's going to be great.

60
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:59,120
It does seem like a risk of losing some of the excitement and hype they've got going

61
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,120
right now.

62
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:01,120
Yeah.

63
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:05,380
It's got to be a pretty tricky position they're in if that's the route they're going, right?

64
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:06,960
It's not your first choice.

65
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:10,680
But at the same time, I imagine, you know, limited resources, limited supply lines.

66
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:14,120
So you do have to make some strategic decisions sometimes.

67
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:17,440
I guess we just have to hope that whatever they come up with next is pretty great.

68
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:18,440
Yeah.

69
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:19,440
And it makes sense.

70
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:24,480
You know, you take this time to design and build and hope that when you're done with

71
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:27,040
that process, the supply chain is recovered, I suppose.

72
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:31,920
And you know, I'm always down for a faster SOC.

73
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:36,400
And I'm always interested if I could have maybe socketed RAM or a little bit more.

74
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:37,480
We'll keep an eye on this.

75
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:42,840
And Michael Arbelov at Ferronix is keeping an eye on it as well.

76
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:47,960
Security company Qualys has uncovered a dangerous memory corruption vulnerability in Polkit's

77
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:48,960
PKExec CVE-2021-4034.

78
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:59,240
If you're not familiar, Polkit, formerly known as Policykit, is a systemd setuid root

79
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:03,880
program that's installed on a whole bunch of Linux distributions.

80
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:07,280
And this has really been discovered as far back as November.

81
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:09,720
And it's a really easy vulnerability to exploit.

82
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:15,360
We don't talk about all vulnerabilities, but these ones we tend to cover because it's one

83
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:20,900
of those where if any ordinary user has shell on a system, well, that could be a standard

84
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:25,380
user or maybe a service that you're running as a user.

85
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:31,560
If that unprivileged user has access to the local machine, they could utilize this exploit

86
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:35,120
to get root privileges on a vulnerable computer.

87
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,120
So it's kind of a big deal.

88
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:40,180
And Qualys wrote in their brief description of the problem, quote, this vulnerability

89
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:43,060
is an attacker's dream come true.

90
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:44,560
And here's kind of why they say that.

91
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,640
And we're not trying to scare you.

92
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:49,580
We're just trying to make sure you know why it's important this gets patched.

93
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:54,480
Because PKExec is installed by default on just about every major distro out there.

94
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:59,080
Qualys themselves exploited it on Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, and CentOS.

95
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:02,900
And they said they really don't see why it wouldn't affect any other distribution that

96
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:04,120
has PKExec.

97
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:08,880
And it's been vulnerable since 2009.

98
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:14,060
And that vulnerability allows any unprivileged local user to exploit that vulnerability to

99
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:15,240
become root.

100
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:16,240
So it's bad.

101
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,240
Yeah.

102
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:22,640
And although this vulnerability is technically a memory corruption issue, turns out it's

103
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:29,040
still pretty much instantly exploitable, pretty reliably in an architecture independent way.

104
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:31,760
So your architecture won't save you this time.

105
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:35,800
It even works if the pull kit daemon itself isn't running.

106
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:40,640
If you're curious, you want to give it a try on one of your systems or just learn more,

107
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:43,760
a proof of concept has been released.

108
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:47,120
And of course, if you haven't patched, well, there's a patch available and distribution

109
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:50,440
repository near you.

110
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:52,080
Cute.

111
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:57,960
The framework that powers the KDE desktop is announcing support for ads in client side

112
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:59,640
applications.

113
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:06,480
This does not sound great at first, especially when NeoWin is running headlines like ads

114
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:09,760
may be coming to KDE, the popular Linux desktop.

115
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:12,700
That's probably not what's going to happen here.

116
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:19,440
But the Qt toolkit, which the Plasma desktop is built on top of, is adding upstream support

117
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:23,720
for placing ads in Qt based applications.

118
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:29,160
And according to the documentation, they support a quote variety of platforms, including Windows

119
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:36,600
10, Ubuntu 20.04, Raspbian Buster, Mac OS, Android 7, and iOS.

120
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:43,200
I don't know how they view broad platform support, but maybe more than one or two Linux

121
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:44,200
distributions.

122
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:45,200
I don't know.

123
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:49,740
Maybe KDE neon, for example, would be good to support, but I really doubt we're going

124
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:56,520
to see ads inserted in Acadian Live or your Dolphin file manager or console.

125
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:58,800
I just don't think that's where this is going to go.

126
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,040
Well, watch out.

127
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:03,440
It seems like they're not just targeting desktop and mobile.

128
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:09,640
No, their press release explains that their new offering aims to, quote, disrupt the IoT

129
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:10,640
industry.

130
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:14,000
lino.com slash lan.

131
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,680
Go there to get $100 in 60 day credit on a new account.

132
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:20,560
Yeah, you can really try things, and you go there to support the show.

133
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,840
Linode is fast, reliable cloud hosting.

134
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:23,840
Go try it for yourself.

135
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:24,840
Go try it for your next project.

136
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:27,720
It's how we've hosted everything for the last couple of years.

137
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:31,040
And I've been hearing from some of you that you are concerned about Google booting out

138
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:33,160
its legacy G Suite users.

139
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:38,600
Well, maybe now is the time to move away from expensive proprietary cloud storage and switch

140
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:42,860
to Nextcloud and just use Linode's object storage with it.

141
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:43,860
It's easy.

142
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:44,860
It's simple.

143
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:46,280
It's what we do.

144
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:49,720
We've been running Nextcloud up there for, I don't know, I guess it's been about two

145
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:50,720
years.

146
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:53,640
It's almost one of the very first things we migrated to Linode.

147
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:59,600
And the real revolution for us was switching the backend storage to object storage.

148
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:05,520
In previous Nextcloud implementations, we would just slice off a big chunk of disk and

149
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:07,240
try to keep it under that size.

150
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:10,640
And if we couldn't because we were working on a project, then Chris was logging in and

151
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:16,240
he was adding more disk and reconfiguring Nextcloud in the middle of a project.

152
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,360
That was the thing.

153
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:18,600
That was a real thing.

154
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:23,520
And since we switched over to object storage, we never hit that anymore.

155
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:26,960
And I just slice off every few months a bunch of storage to a local box that I have here.

156
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:29,080
And it works so, so great.

157
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:34,280
And one of the things I'm really impressed by is how smoothly Linode is rolling out these

158
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:36,000
MVME storage upgrades.

159
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,120
So I mean, you're getting super fast PCIe storage now.

160
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:42,240
Just went live in the London data center, I think yesterday.

161
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:44,800
So these are just getting rolled out faster and faster all the time.

162
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:48,560
So if you're a performance hound, or if you've got an application that needs a lot of storage

163
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:52,160
throughput, Linode's team can help you sort through the possibilities for accessing the

164
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:53,960
power of these new MVME disks.

165
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:56,160
And they've got 11 data centers around the world.

166
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:59,980
So you're going to find something that works for you or is close to your customers.

167
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:02,800
They've been doing this for 18 years and they just keep getting better and better.

168
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:07,040
And they've got the best customer support with $100, you can really go try it out.

169
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:10,880
Go pick your distribution of choice or your application stack of choice and just deploy

170
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:14,680
it and go build something and get started.

171
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:18,600
Linode.com slash LAN.

172
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:22,200
And a big thank you to Ting, linux.ting.com.

173
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:26,760
If you're sick of overpaying for cell service, go see how much you could save and then get

174
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:30,400
25 bucks off that at linux.ting.com.

175
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:35,000
I've been a customer since 2013 of Ting and they have been a sponsor since a little bit

176
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,180
after that.

177
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:40,480
And there's two reasons why I have been a customer and they have been sponsors.

178
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:43,240
Number one, the value is obvious.

179
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:45,200
And number two, I like this company.

180
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:50,480
I like what they're doing and I like how they are pushing the mobile duopolies around.

181
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:53,960
You see, Ting is an MVNO, so they can offer a ton of value.

182
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:58,080
They can really focus on the customer relationship and not focus on digging holes in the ground

183
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:03,100
to stand up towers, you know, and you still get access to those big network towers.

184
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:07,960
But you deal with Ting and they have nationwide coverage with a great mix of plans with fast

185
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:10,400
data, LTE and 5G.

186
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:15,120
And they were recently named the number one carrier by Consumer Reports in 2021.

187
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:20,600
Their plans are simple and straightforward and it's just a simpler way, a smarter way

188
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:21,600
to do mobile.

189
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:26,480
You know, in almost every plan, I think every plan, you'd have to double check though, you're

190
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:28,480
going to find one that'll work for you though.

191
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:31,160
Almost every plan should work for you, but I think they're going to have the perfect

192
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:32,160
plan.

193
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:37,280
They have unlimited talk and text and it's great for a family or great for a small business.

194
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:41,000
We have used Ting in the years past when we all were attacking Linux Fest Northwest.

195
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,200
I mean, not in a good way.

196
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:46,720
Like the whole crew just like descended upon Linux Fest Northwest, Ting and Telegram.

197
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:49,360
That's how we did everything that year.

198
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:51,440
It's great for stuff like that too.

199
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:54,880
So small business, family, or just yourself and you want to save some money.

200
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:59,540
And every plan gets access to Ting's award winning customer service with nationwide LTE

201
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:03,360
and 5G coverage and no contracts ever.

202
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,940
It's simple to switch to Ting and pretty much any phone's going to work because of their

203
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:07,240
wide network support.

204
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:11,800
So go to linux.ting.com, check your current phone, create an account and pick the plan

205
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:12,800
that's right for you.

206
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,840
Ting will send you a SIM card.

207
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:22,520
You pop that in your phone and you get active in just minutes, linux.ting.com.

208
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:30,320
On Wednesday, Valve officially announced that the Steam Deck will launch on February 25th.

209
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:32,120
How's this actually going to work though?

210
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:37,320
Well, it's going to go by the date each user put in their reservation of course.

211
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:42,280
Starting off with those first lucky few who actually got in before Valve's servers crashed.

212
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:48,040
On February 25th, the first batch of order invitation emails will be sent out.

213
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:54,320
And then each person who gets one has just 72 hours to make the actual Deck purchase

214
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:59,040
before that opportunity moves on to the next lucky person in line.

215
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:05,680
The most important 72 hours of the year, Liam over at linuxungaming.com has a really good

216
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:09,960
write up on this and I'm really glad he did because I, I guess I just forgot, but I was

217
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:14,800
under the impression that I'd placed my order, I'd authorized the full amount.

218
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:20,140
I didn't realize I was going to have to be checking my email on a specific day, watching

219
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:25,160
for one of the many emails that I will land no doubt in my updates tab on Gmail.

220
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:28,960
Now as far as the details, yep, you're going to be looking for the email around the 25th

221
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:33,840
and then after the 28th, they plan to start sending weekly invitations for more people

222
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:34,840
to place their order.

223
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:37,440
So that's actually, that's actually pretty soon.

224
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:42,960
Seems, seems kind of like Valve's implying they expect things to move reasonably well.

225
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:48,680
Now behind the scenes, as we see all of that going on, Valve's also been working with developers

226
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:52,280
to improve the AMD graphics situation on Linux even further.

227
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:57,180
Of course that benefits the Deck and there's been a lot of work to get more games Steam

228
00:13:57,180 --> 00:14:02,960
Deck verified as well as some additional work has recently gone into the anti-cheat stuff.

229
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:08,000
But I think the neat thing to see is some new features that the Deck is going to introduce

230
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,840
and one of them is dynamic cloud sync.

231
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:15,260
It's now live on Steam and Valve's is just the first for any gaming platform currently

232
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:16,260
in operation.

233
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:20,440
I don't know about that, Xbox has some pretty good sync stuff, but it does seem to have

234
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:26,240
one particular use case they've covered that the other platforms don't and that is it does

235
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:31,380
a dynamic sync when you put the Deck to sleep and then the idea is you can go over to your

236
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:36,480
PC and resume that same game right where you left off.

237
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:41,120
Now before you get too excited, we should definitely note that this won't just auto

238
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:47,660
magically work on existing games, developers will need to patch to support this functionality.

239
00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:49,960
Here's a little more detail on how it works.

240
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:54,380
When you go put your Deck to sleep, it's going to sneakily connect to the internet and proceed

241
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:58,760
with the same upload of the save data that it would have done if you'd actually bothered

242
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:01,000
to quit out of your game.

243
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:05,800
Then if you hop on over back to your home PC, play a little more and decide, nah I liked

244
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:10,200
the couch better, move back to your Deck, well the Deck's going to get a notification

245
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:13,280
that there's some new save files available.

246
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:17,160
And that's the point that developers have to implement a flag that smartly reloads those

247
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:21,320
new save files or quits out and restarts the process or whatever they need to do to make

248
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:23,760
sure that new data gets loaded in.

249
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:28,920
Oh, the rough life of those who will own both a Steam Deck and a gaming PC.

250
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:31,520
I feel ya, it's a tough one out there.

251
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:34,960
