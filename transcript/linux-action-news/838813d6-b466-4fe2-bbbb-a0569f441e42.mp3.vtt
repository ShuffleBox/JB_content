00:00.000 --> 00:16.680
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, our weekly take on Linux and the open source world.

00:16.680 --> 00:20.680
This is episode 83, recorded on December 9th, 2018.

00:20.680 --> 00:21.680
I'm Chris.

00:21.680 --> 00:22.680
And I'm Joe.

00:22.680 --> 00:23.680
Hello, Joe.

00:23.680 --> 00:27.040
It's good to be connected with you, and I think we all did a collective double take

00:27.040 --> 00:35.120
this week when we heard about our first story, and that is Microsoft Edge moving to a Chromium

00:35.120 --> 00:36.120
base.

00:36.120 --> 00:40.560
Well, Microsoft loves Linux and open source, so it just totally makes sense that they're

00:40.560 --> 00:43.960
going to base their browser on an open source base, doesn't it?

00:43.960 --> 00:45.920
Oh, yeah.

00:45.920 --> 00:53.040
I mean, this is, to me, this is one of the biggest conceits in recent tech history, and

00:53.040 --> 01:04.000
I never expected Microsoft to be this willing to self-analyze and go, where are we losing,

01:04.000 --> 01:07.600
and give up on Internet Explorer slash Edge.

01:07.600 --> 01:12.960
I mean, this is a 20-year legacy, or another way to phrase this in corporate speak.

01:12.960 --> 01:20.760
This is a 20-year investment that they fought for hard, and having a strategic stake in

01:20.760 --> 01:26.320
the web via an engine is excessively valuable for these companies.

01:26.320 --> 01:27.320
It's just ridiculous.

01:27.320 --> 01:30.520
Like, it used to be kind of the game.

01:30.520 --> 01:35.760
And so to see Microsoft, even though clearly Edge was not going to be a popular browser,

01:35.760 --> 01:40.280
even with that still, that obvious evidence, to actually see them make this move, I don't

01:40.280 --> 01:41.280
know what to do with that.

01:41.280 --> 01:43.360
That's so crazy at this point.

01:43.360 --> 01:47.040
If you were to come on next week and say they're shutting down Bing, I'd be like, oh, yeah,

01:47.040 --> 01:48.440
that's what Microsoft's doing now.

01:48.440 --> 01:50.240
They're doing that kind of thing now.

01:50.240 --> 01:54.520
But if you think about it, do they really care what browser engine is talking to the

01:54.520 --> 01:56.920
servers running on Azure?

01:56.920 --> 01:57.920
Not really.

01:57.920 --> 02:01.560
And that's where they're making their money, and that's where they seem to be heading,

02:01.560 --> 02:02.560
doubling down on Azure.

02:02.560 --> 02:03.560
Hmm.

02:03.560 --> 02:04.560
Maybe.

02:04.560 --> 02:09.880
I'm not going to say I believe this is a pure Azure play here, as so many other things

02:09.880 --> 02:11.800
seem to be.

02:11.800 --> 02:16.360
Because one of the little nuances about this story that people aren't talking a lot about

02:16.360 --> 02:23.520
is there's a bunch of progressive web applications and other applications that are based around

02:23.520 --> 02:27.520
the Edge engine selling in the Windows Store right now.

02:27.520 --> 02:32.800
And those are going to continue to use that rendering engine even after the Chromium

02:32.800 --> 02:34.280
switch has happened.

02:34.280 --> 02:38.440
Those applications being sold through the store, still using Edge under the hood, the

02:38.440 --> 02:40.060
old Edge engine.

02:40.060 --> 02:44.760
So that's kind of an interesting thing, because a lot of those PWA apps are connecting to

02:44.760 --> 02:45.760
Azure services.

02:45.760 --> 02:47.840
So I'm not sure this is a pure Azure play.

02:47.840 --> 02:54.600
But they will be trying to leverage control, but just through the more modern method of

02:54.600 --> 02:55.600
doing so.

02:55.600 --> 02:57.680
They write on their post about this.

02:57.680 --> 03:02.660
As part of this, we intend to become a significant contributor to the Chromium project in a

03:02.660 --> 03:08.000
way that can make not just Microsoft Edge, but other browsers as well better on both

03:08.000 --> 03:11.220
PCs and other devices.

03:11.220 --> 03:17.640
And we've begun making contributions to the Chromium project to help move browsing forward

03:17.640 --> 03:20.720
on new ARM-based Windows devices.

03:20.720 --> 03:23.540
They're already contributing code upstream for that purpose.

03:23.540 --> 03:31.680
And in here, they say their goal is to embrace this open source, established model of providing

03:31.680 --> 03:39.720
meaningful contributions that make it a better browser on Windows by contributing that upstream.

03:39.720 --> 03:47.640
And the heavy, heavy, heavy implication here is this is about making electron-based applications

03:47.640 --> 03:50.600
totally kick ass on Windows.

03:50.600 --> 03:57.380
I'm pretty sure I know what this is in service of, a much bigger, longer term goal.

03:57.380 --> 04:01.400
But I'm going to save that prediction for our episode at the end of the year.

04:01.400 --> 04:06.000
But this is about, I'll just say short term, this is about making electron apps the best

04:06.000 --> 04:07.000
on Windows.

04:07.000 --> 04:14.920
In fact, there's an implication in here that you may see a bit of a consolidated electron

04:14.920 --> 04:15.920
runtime.

04:15.920 --> 04:21.560
That when electron apps run on Windows, they sort of use this integrated, centralized runtime

04:21.560 --> 04:25.320
instead of launching a dedicated runtime for each electron app.

04:25.320 --> 04:29.220
Well, it will be baked into Windows 10, won't it, like Edge is currently.

04:29.220 --> 04:31.480
So that would kind of make sense, yeah.

04:31.480 --> 04:32.480
Yeah.

04:32.480 --> 04:33.480
I hadn't thought about that.

04:33.480 --> 04:34.480
Yeah, they say they'll do it over time.

04:34.480 --> 04:36.480
They'll make the change under the hood.

04:36.480 --> 04:39.260
So most end users won't even be aware this happened.

04:39.260 --> 04:44.280
And then they say they'll do a frequent release cadence where they'll just start pushing updates

04:44.280 --> 04:49.760
to Edge in the background kind of aggressively like the Chrome browser does itself.

04:49.760 --> 04:54.700
And they plan to release a version of Edge for the Mac as well that will be running on

04:54.700 --> 04:55.700
the Chromium.

04:55.700 --> 04:58.920
Or really, it's the Blink rendering engine and the V8 JavaScript engine.

04:58.920 --> 04:59.920
Yeah.

04:59.920 --> 05:01.560
So it's really, I think it's about web apps.

05:01.560 --> 05:03.860
And it's about electron.

05:03.860 --> 05:07.900
And I think it's about being just on a winning team, perhaps.

05:07.900 --> 05:10.240
But it's a massive, massive win for Google.

05:10.240 --> 05:13.640
Well, they didn't go so far as to say that it'd be available for Linux.

05:13.640 --> 05:15.720
But there was a slight implication there.

05:15.720 --> 05:19.920
I can't wait to install it on Linux and review it.

05:19.920 --> 05:23.200
Look at some of their applications they release now that are electron based, like Visual Studio

05:23.200 --> 05:24.200
Code.

05:24.200 --> 05:28.280
This is going to be something that has to be available for Linux if those applications

05:28.280 --> 05:29.280
are going to be using this technology.

05:29.280 --> 05:30.280
Yeah, I suppose so.

05:30.280 --> 05:34.560
Or even if we're not using it directly, we'll end up using it, well, not we, but the people

05:34.560 --> 05:35.920
who are using those electron apps.

05:35.920 --> 05:36.920
Yeah.

05:36.920 --> 05:37.920
Right.

05:37.920 --> 05:38.920
Keep in mind also, Skype, electron app.

05:38.920 --> 05:39.920
Yeah.

05:39.920 --> 05:44.840
Well, I try not to use that if at all possible, or I might have to use it this week, possibly.

05:44.840 --> 05:46.040
Makes me shudder.

05:46.040 --> 05:48.800
But Mozilla are not very happy about this, are they?

05:48.800 --> 05:49.800
No.

05:49.800 --> 05:50.800
Surprisingly enough.

05:50.800 --> 05:52.760
Yeah, shocker there.

05:52.760 --> 05:55.220
They come in swinging.

05:55.220 --> 05:57.960
This is the opening sentence.

05:57.960 --> 06:03.200
And I quote, Microsoft is officially giving up on an independent shared platform for the

06:03.200 --> 06:04.200
internet.

06:04.200 --> 06:10.880
By adopting Chromium, Microsoft hands over control of even more of online life to Google.

06:10.880 --> 06:11.880
Dang.

06:11.880 --> 06:13.880
That's the opening sentence.

06:13.880 --> 06:18.040
Yeah, they're not messing about at all, are they?

06:18.040 --> 06:22.300
But they do have a point that now it's a two horse race, whereas before it was something

06:22.300 --> 06:23.840
of a three horse race.

06:23.840 --> 06:29.880
We like to think as IT people that no one is actually using Edge, but it's still the

06:29.880 --> 06:35.280
default browser on most Windows installations, at least outside of Europe.

06:35.280 --> 06:37.200
And people tend to use the defaults.

06:37.200 --> 06:40.420
And Windows 10 has got this huge market share.

06:40.420 --> 06:45.040
So there must be a lot of people using Edge as it stands.

06:45.040 --> 06:48.640
And so now after this change happens, there'll only be two horses in the race.

06:48.640 --> 06:54.320
I don't know, is that good for Mozilla, probably not really, because it means that people are

06:54.320 --> 06:59.920
just not really going to test things outside of Chromium and Chrome.

06:59.920 --> 07:04.680
This is really, to me, two different ways to look at the same problem.

07:04.680 --> 07:07.280
What you said is absolutely true.

07:07.280 --> 07:08.880
And I think that's Mozilla's perspective.

07:08.880 --> 07:12.920
And they've been trying to paint that picture for ages now.

07:12.920 --> 07:14.880
There's also the reality of the situation.

07:14.880 --> 07:21.320
If we zoom out and we look at the whole browser market, Edge, sure, it's the default on Windows

07:21.320 --> 07:22.320
10.

07:22.320 --> 07:26.320
And I bet you a pretty sizable percentage of Windows 10 users that are average users

07:26.320 --> 07:27.320
keep that.

07:27.320 --> 07:29.960
Probably not most in our audience, but maybe even some in our audience.

07:29.960 --> 07:33.120
No, no judgment if you do.

07:33.120 --> 07:38.400
But Windows 10 is just an itty bitty baby drop in the ocean compared to the Android

07:38.400 --> 07:40.600
and iPhone market.

07:40.600 --> 07:44.320
And then you combine all of the Windows machines that are using Chrome.

07:44.320 --> 07:47.280
All the Macs and Linux boxes that are using Chrome.

07:47.280 --> 07:54.280
WebKit and Blink just have a massive, impenetrable market share.

07:54.280 --> 07:57.680
And I think Microsoft very wisely has sussed that out.

07:57.680 --> 08:03.120
And instead, they're doing something that really only Microsoft can.

08:03.120 --> 08:09.120
What other company has enough weight, has enough gravitas and experience to move the

08:09.120 --> 08:12.800
needle in the direction of a project like Chromium other than Microsoft?

08:12.800 --> 08:18.440
Google is such a massive stakeholder in this project for obvious reasons that really anyone's

08:18.440 --> 08:23.120
contributions besides somebody like Microsoft would be a drop in the bucket.

08:23.120 --> 08:26.320
And I'm reading from the Microsoft GitHub page here.

08:26.320 --> 08:30.920
They have a massive plan for their contributions to this project.

08:30.920 --> 08:37.000
They have a whole range of things they're planning to upstream that will make considerable

08:37.000 --> 08:40.300
adjustments to the code base of this web browser.

08:40.300 --> 08:44.600
And when you look at when Microsoft started to get involved in the Linux kernel for virtualization

08:44.600 --> 08:50.000
compatibility, their contribution on that scale of top contributors exploded.

08:50.000 --> 08:55.080
They can take that same approach and they can apply that to Chromium.

08:55.080 --> 08:58.520
And I'm really curious to see where this goes because if you look at the reality of the

08:58.520 --> 09:02.960
market, it's really a WebKit horse race.

09:02.960 --> 09:09.480
Congratulations to the team that initially put KHTML together because you created something

09:09.480 --> 09:14.520
that is going to be a standard on the web for a very long time now.

09:14.520 --> 09:18.280
So congratulations to the KHTML team because this is really your legacy.

09:18.280 --> 09:25.320
And I think this is humbling to see an open source project like this have a massive impact

09:25.320 --> 09:26.320
on the web.

09:26.320 --> 09:30.260
And if you look at the way open source has shaped the web from the top to the bottom,

09:30.260 --> 09:35.160
it might not be Mozilla's story, but it's still free software and open source's story.

09:35.160 --> 09:39.280
And if Microsoft can make a dent, if they can impact or move the needle by contributing

09:39.280 --> 09:43.080
to Chromium, then they're going to make a direct contribution and they're going to improve

09:43.080 --> 09:44.920
the real market leader.

09:44.920 --> 09:50.560
And I plead for anyone to run Firefox, that it works for them.

09:50.560 --> 09:56.320
Consider running Firefox because at least then you can help make somewhat of a market

09:56.320 --> 09:59.120
signal for that web browser.

09:59.120 --> 10:03.260
But I think Microsoft's looking at the reality of the situation and how they can most effectively

10:03.260 --> 10:05.840
apply some leverage and this is it.

10:05.840 --> 10:10.240
And I would argue they may be one of the best companies positioned to actually pull this

10:10.240 --> 10:11.240
off.

10:11.240 --> 10:14.200
So do you think you'd give it a try if they released Edge for Linux?

10:14.200 --> 10:16.520
Yeah, I suppose I'd have to just kick the tires.

10:16.520 --> 10:17.520
I don't know if I'd switch though.

10:17.520 --> 10:20.080
That'd be a little, I feel a little weird, Joe.

10:20.080 --> 10:24.480
I don't think I'd install it on my main machine, put it that way, just on my test box.

10:24.480 --> 10:25.480
Oh, skeptical.

10:25.480 --> 10:26.480
Yeah.

10:26.480 --> 10:28.680
Well, because it's not going to be open source, is it?

10:28.680 --> 10:29.680
Well I think it will be.

10:29.680 --> 10:30.680
It might be.

10:30.680 --> 10:32.040
And I might trust it more than I trust Google Chrome.

10:32.040 --> 10:34.480
I don't know about the Chromium project itself though.

10:34.480 --> 10:37.400
I'd try it, but I don't think, I don't know, I don't know.

10:37.400 --> 10:42.080
Well Chromium and WebKit and Blink are very much the standard for browsing the web, but

10:42.080 --> 10:46.600
most of the sites that people will be looking at are powered by WordPress, or at least 30%

10:46.600 --> 10:47.600
of them.

10:47.600 --> 10:50.180
Yeah, it is a huge success story in itself.

10:50.180 --> 10:52.800
And version 5.0 came out this week.

10:52.800 --> 10:56.440
I think the big headline feature is the new block-based editor.

10:56.440 --> 11:02.400
They call it a first step towards an exciting future, but the new block-based editor allows

11:02.400 --> 11:07.280
you to arrange content, but doesn't really affect, don't think of it as affecting the

11:07.280 --> 11:12.720
way the page renders or looks, but it's more about giving creators a blank canvas where

11:12.720 --> 11:16.920
they can like draw a box and say, this media element goes here, or make these fonts in

11:16.920 --> 11:18.320
this area fancy.

11:18.320 --> 11:22.080
And you do it via this block concept, and they have a bunch of blocks you can just drop

11:22.080 --> 11:23.720
in there and then you're good to go.

11:23.720 --> 11:27.160
I've tried this out and I'm not convinced really.

11:27.160 --> 11:33.680
I think that if I'd never used WordPress before, it would be a better experience than I have

11:33.680 --> 11:40.160
got used to, but having already developed a workflow, this has somewhat just thrown

11:40.160 --> 11:41.880
that out of the window.

11:41.880 --> 11:48.160
There is a plugin which can bring you the old functionality back, the old editor, but

11:48.160 --> 11:54.160
I don't like installing plugins if I don't have to, because it's just more attack surface

11:54.160 --> 11:55.300
and stuff.

11:55.300 --> 12:00.040
And that only works until 2021, and then they're dropping compatibility for that plugin.

12:00.040 --> 12:01.040
Yeah.

12:01.040 --> 12:04.280
So I think I'm just going to have to get used to this and just start rolling with it.

12:04.280 --> 12:07.160
It's radically different though.

12:07.160 --> 12:08.160
I was pretty surprised.

12:08.160 --> 12:10.800
I mean, minimalist would be one way to put it.

12:10.800 --> 12:12.160
It's very minimal.

12:12.160 --> 12:16.080
And you kind of start with a blank canvas and then build the blocks together and do

12:16.080 --> 12:17.080
your post.

12:17.080 --> 12:21.200
And I bet you if you could work with templates and systems like that, create your own blocks,

12:21.200 --> 12:25.360
you could essentially replicate the workflow you have with the classic design.

12:25.360 --> 12:26.360
But I agree.

12:26.360 --> 12:32.600
As a long, long, long time WordPress user, jarring and surprising is how I would describe

12:32.600 --> 12:34.320
the new UI.

12:34.320 --> 12:36.880
But I have the same exact thought you had.

12:36.880 --> 12:40.320
It was like, okay, well, I could totally see if this is the first time I ever sat down

12:40.320 --> 12:42.040
to use WordPress.

12:42.040 --> 12:45.600
And I wouldn't be surprised if that's their thinking, like we've got 30% of the web, but

12:45.600 --> 12:46.600
what about the next 30%?

12:46.600 --> 12:51.800
You know, that's a pretty common line of thinking for these ambitious groups like this.

12:51.800 --> 12:56.280
But the other thing about 5.0, besides the new UI, is there's some very important security

12:56.280 --> 12:57.280
fixes in here.

12:57.280 --> 13:01.560
They're not emphasizing those very much, but having followed this for TechSnap recently,

13:01.560 --> 13:03.760
there's some pretty important security fixes in 5.0 too.

13:03.760 --> 13:08.000
So it's worth the upgrade, but with all these big ones, you know, you can always try it

13:08.000 --> 13:12.080
out before you make the upgrade, throw it up on a VPS for a bit and kick the tires.

13:12.080 --> 13:14.720
And they have also some ones online you can try out.

13:14.720 --> 13:18.400
Well, something else I think I've heard you talk about running on a VPS is MB.

13:18.400 --> 13:23.720
Yeah, the open source communities answer to Plex, a media streaming system that automatically

13:23.720 --> 13:25.500
indexes all your files.

13:25.500 --> 13:29.560
It retrieves all the metadata from the various information services.

13:29.560 --> 13:33.840
It displays them nicely in a web UI or on apps on Android or iOS.

13:33.840 --> 13:36.680
And it even, you know, keeps track of what you've watched, gets trailers, you know, things

13:36.680 --> 13:37.920
you expect from Plex.

13:37.920 --> 13:39.560
This sounds like a great open source project.

13:39.560 --> 13:40.760
Yeah, so I went all in.

13:40.760 --> 13:46.160
I set myself up a droplet, got some big attached storage and I sync files up there.

13:46.160 --> 13:52.880
And this week, sort of sneaky too, because obviously who wants to really emphasize this,

13:52.880 --> 13:59.600
but in a new release, it is revealed that MB is essentially switching to a closed source

13:59.600 --> 14:09.240
core model with other bits that are open source, a proprietary core with open source additions.

14:09.240 --> 14:11.880
The nerd rage was strong on GitHub, wasn't it?

14:11.880 --> 14:12.880
Yeah, yeah.

14:12.880 --> 14:13.880
The comments are brutal.

14:13.880 --> 14:14.880
And I'm pretty upset too.

14:14.880 --> 14:17.240
This was the major differentiator between this and Plex.

14:17.240 --> 14:21.840
Well, what put me off Plex and I think puts a lot of people off is that you have to log

14:21.840 --> 14:22.840
in.

14:22.840 --> 14:23.840
You have to have an account, don't you?

14:23.840 --> 14:27.680
I think there are maybe some workarounds, but the standard workflow is that you have

14:27.680 --> 14:32.280
to have this account with them, whereas MB was totally self hosted.

14:32.280 --> 14:33.280
Yeah.

14:33.280 --> 14:35.800
There are ways on Plex, like you said, though, to get around that.

14:35.800 --> 14:36.800
Yeah, that's true.

14:36.800 --> 14:43.000
I think that MB will still continue to be popular because it is totally independent.

14:43.000 --> 14:47.080
You can just run it yourself, even if it's proprietary, because it's like things like

14:47.080 --> 14:51.920
Servio that's totally proprietary, but no one cares, or very few people outside of the

14:51.920 --> 14:56.440
Linux open source world care, as long as it works well.

14:56.440 --> 15:00.080
So I don't think it's really going to harm their adoption, is it?

15:00.080 --> 15:06.360
I mean, I know they've got this nagware aspect of it, which, has that annoyed you then?

15:06.360 --> 15:11.880
The nagware aspect would be extremely annoying if I hadn't been an MB premium subscriber

15:11.880 --> 15:13.080
for a while now.

15:13.080 --> 15:18.920
I threw in some money on like a yearly plan just to try to keep them around, to try to

15:18.920 --> 15:23.760
prevent something like this from happening, because this to me was such a great solution.

15:23.760 --> 15:29.160
You think about it, you can have a private collection of TV and movies for your kids,

15:29.160 --> 15:32.840
and if maybe your kids are split between two homes, they can still watch the same stuff,

15:32.840 --> 15:36.440
but you can also share it with friends and family, and when I'm traveling, it's just

15:36.440 --> 15:42.800
so great, and it just was so perfect, and it's so disappointing to see this, and I actually,

15:42.800 --> 15:46.560
I'm going to cancel my premium membership, I have no need for this.

15:46.560 --> 15:51.900
And I guess I would just say this, their timing sucks, because Plex, I feel like, has recently

15:51.900 --> 15:53.400
taken their eye off the ball.

15:53.400 --> 15:59.200
It was originally a fork of XBMC, and it just was better Xbox Media Center XBMC, now known

15:59.200 --> 16:01.080
as Kodi, it was just great at that.

16:01.080 --> 16:04.720
But now they've gotten into trying to aggregate news, and they're even trying to be like a

16:04.720 --> 16:08.720
podcast platform, and they're trying to do all this extra stuff outside of just streaming

16:08.720 --> 16:10.560
my damn shows.

16:10.560 --> 16:14.760
And so it would be MB's game to gain there, but not with this move.

16:14.760 --> 16:16.320
I think it's going to slow that.

16:16.320 --> 16:20.840
Yeah, and this seems to be all about that nagging screen, because people could fork

16:20.840 --> 16:28.320
it before and were forking it and removing that aspect of it, the nag, and they just

16:28.320 --> 16:30.680
don't want that to happen, because that damages their business model.

16:30.680 --> 16:36.200
They want you to be annoyed enough to subscribe to the premium service, and now there's no

16:36.200 --> 16:38.700
way to change that code and remove that.

16:38.700 --> 16:41.000
So that's clearly the crux of this.

16:41.000 --> 16:42.320
I think I smell a fork coming.

16:42.320 --> 16:43.320
Oh, yeah.

16:43.320 --> 16:46.800
Well, there's a lot of talk about that, but their attitude in GitHub as well was like,

16:46.800 --> 16:52.600
yeah, good luck with that, which is, that's not going to win you any friends, is it?

16:52.600 --> 16:54.160
This is way harder than you know.

16:54.160 --> 16:55.160
Good luck.

16:55.160 --> 16:56.160
Yeah.

16:56.160 --> 17:01.400
Well, you know, Linus has been winning over some friends, his emails have been much nicer

17:01.400 --> 17:08.360
with no swearing so far, and it looks like this new attitude has gotten us a reasonable

17:08.360 --> 17:11.400
compromise on what could have been a performance nightmare.

17:11.400 --> 17:17.000
Yeah, and this upcoming 4.20 release, they're going to make the Spectre Variant 2 mitigations

17:17.000 --> 17:20.120
optional on a per application basis.

17:20.120 --> 17:26.720
This is really clever because the performance hit on these most recent fixes were like nearly

17:26.720 --> 17:32.320
50% performance hit, and there's just so many applications that may potentially never need

17:32.320 --> 17:33.320
this protection.

17:33.320 --> 17:39.840
So now processes can decide to use it via a system call, and then if the application,

17:39.840 --> 17:44.520
say maybe it's a particularly secure application, knows it needs that protection, it gets it,

17:44.520 --> 17:48.160
but they can decide to take their chances or not, and thus decide to take the performance

17:48.160 --> 17:49.720
penalty or not.

17:49.720 --> 17:53.440
This is such a clever solution to the problem, isn't it?

17:53.440 --> 17:54.440
It needed to happen.

17:54.440 --> 18:00.680
It's taken, what, basically a year for them to solve this problem, but hopefully this

18:00.680 --> 18:03.240
is going to be the solution that we've all been waiting for.

18:03.240 --> 18:07.080
It seems like the right compromise at least, and we got to keep in mind at this point,

18:07.080 --> 18:12.140
there's not really any known exploits on any of these attack vectors in the wild.

18:12.140 --> 18:16.240
There has been theoretical proof, but there's nothing in the wild, so there's nothing that

18:16.240 --> 18:21.040
we need to protect against currently, and so taking in some work cases a 50% performance

18:21.040 --> 18:24.760
hit, especially on multi-processor systems and systems using hyper-threading, which is

18:24.760 --> 18:28.160
a lot of systems these days, I think this is very wise.

18:28.160 --> 18:32.880
Well, just because there's no public exploits using this doesn't necessarily mean that the

18:32.880 --> 18:37.320
three-letter agencies don't have them, but let's not get all tinfoil hat, shall we?

18:37.320 --> 18:38.320
Okay.

18:38.320 --> 18:39.320
All right.

18:39.320 --> 18:44.300
Well, instead, let's talk about some surprising news, and that was NVIDIA open sourcing PhysX.

18:44.300 --> 18:49.240
This is surprising, but it's very welcome that something that is potentially very useful

18:49.240 --> 18:55.400
to a lot more than just gaming is being released by NVIDIA, but there is a bit of a caveat,

18:55.400 --> 18:59.520
isn't there, that you do kind of need to use it in conjunction with NVIDIA hardware.

18:59.520 --> 19:02.800
Yeah, and I don't see that likely changing anytime soon.

19:02.800 --> 19:09.080
I suppose if it's open source, it's possible, or maybe some shims could be created, but

19:09.080 --> 19:13.800
I don't want that to detract from what this is, because this, again, is like a 10-year

19:13.800 --> 19:18.960
investment by a company, and that really means a lot, and there is direct applications for

19:18.960 --> 19:22.440
PhysX outside of gaming, AI research.

19:22.440 --> 19:26.720
It's particularly useful for self-driving car modeling in game development.

19:26.720 --> 19:32.000
It helps with creating unique, real-life-liking animations for, like, background characters,

19:32.000 --> 19:36.080
so there's ways that lots of games could be improved, but in high-performance computing,

19:36.080 --> 19:41.080
which might be one of the more important ones, things like simulations are being done, and

19:41.080 --> 19:46.680
being able to take advantage of the GPUs in better ways could make scientific discovery

19:46.680 --> 19:48.480
happen faster.

19:48.480 --> 19:51.880
You really can't undersell this, and they're making it available this week.

19:51.880 --> 19:56.160
It's already available as a BSD3-licensed open source project.

19:56.160 --> 19:58.760
What do you make of that license choice, then?

19:58.760 --> 20:04.400
That means that it can be baked into proprietary stuff, and the changes and improvements won't

20:04.400 --> 20:05.400
be then shared.

20:05.400 --> 20:09.360
I wonder why they did that rather than go in a copyleft route.

20:09.360 --> 20:10.360
I'm not sure.

20:10.360 --> 20:11.360
It's hard to say.

20:11.360 --> 20:14.860
You know, we can't read their minds, and, boy, that would be useful, but when you read

20:14.860 --> 20:19.480
what they have released publicly, they talk about it in a way that they've come to this

20:19.480 --> 20:24.480
realization that they've developed something that's foundationally important to the future

20:24.480 --> 20:30.560
of research, and they write, we've decided to provide it to the world in an open source

20:30.560 --> 20:31.560
fashion.

20:31.560 --> 20:34.440
Like, they came to this realization, holy crap, we've created something really great

20:34.440 --> 20:39.920
here, and, hey, you know, it does kind of require our video cards anyways, so let's

20:39.920 --> 20:45.200
just open source this, because maybe we can become, like, the thought leader in this area.

20:45.200 --> 20:51.080
We can become the dominating platform for this type of work, and so there is that huge

20:51.080 --> 20:53.560
potential long-term benefit for them.

20:53.560 --> 20:54.720
And benefit for all of us.

20:54.720 --> 20:57.600
Maybe it won't just be Phoenix where you can get a Johnny Cab soon.

20:57.600 --> 20:58.600
Yeah.

20:58.600 --> 21:04.320
I mean, we may see a PhysX-assisted projects taking off all around the world, or we may

21:04.320 --> 21:07.720
never really hear much about it because it's just going to be one of those foundational

21:07.720 --> 21:11.240
low-level things that does all the heavy lifting.

21:11.240 --> 21:12.960
But let's move on with our last story.

21:12.960 --> 21:13.960
Bit of good news.

21:13.960 --> 21:20.760
We just recently covered that Valve was discontinuing the Steam Link hardware, but they appear to

21:20.760 --> 21:23.840
already be making good on that Steam Link as an app strategy.

21:23.840 --> 21:28.840
Yeah, now there is a deb available for the Raspberry Pi, at least for the Raspberry Pi

21:28.840 --> 21:31.080
3B and 3B+.

21:31.080 --> 21:33.800
So I have to ask, have you had a chance to check this out?

21:33.800 --> 21:34.800
No.

21:34.800 --> 21:39.480
I had a conversation with Popey who gave it a go, and it sounds like it's pretty legit,

21:39.480 --> 21:47.800
and you got to figure this is probably the first step in what is going to be, I hope,

21:47.800 --> 21:52.440
a Netflix-like strategy for the Steam Link app.

21:52.440 --> 21:55.360
When Roku started, it was known as the Netflix box.

21:55.360 --> 21:58.800
It was the Netflix box, and then it became the Roku.

21:58.800 --> 22:02.000
And now everything is a Netflix box.

22:02.000 --> 22:07.760
Every television, every microwave, every set-top box, it has to ship with a Netflix app.

22:07.760 --> 22:14.160
If Valve could achieve something similar to this strategy, even if it wasn't nearly as

22:14.160 --> 22:19.360
comprehensive as Netflix's, but if they could just get on maybe the Nvidia Shield, if they

22:19.360 --> 22:23.460
could get on a Roku, for example, because this right here proves it out.

22:23.460 --> 22:27.320
If you can make it run on a Raspberry Pi, you can probably get it running on just nearly

22:27.320 --> 22:31.560
any of these set-top boxes if they get the manufacturer on board.

22:31.560 --> 22:37.600
And that would be a superior strategy than making hardware, because to be honest, I think

22:37.600 --> 22:41.600
a lot of us are getting burned out on buying these boxes that we hook up to our televisions

22:41.600 --> 22:44.480
and burning another HDMI port.

22:44.480 --> 22:49.280
If you could instead get the Steam Link app on something already hooked up to your TV,

22:49.280 --> 22:50.280
that's a huge win.

22:50.280 --> 22:53.560
Yeah, well, that definitely seems to be the strategy they're going for here, but they've

22:53.560 --> 22:57.900
had a bit of a checkered history with the hardware that they've sold, haven't they?

22:57.900 --> 23:02.020
These Steam boxes that just seem to disappear.

23:02.020 --> 23:06.640
So who knows with Valve, they seem to throw a lot of stuff at the wall, and maybe this

23:06.640 --> 23:07.640
will stick.

23:07.640 --> 23:09.280
Yeah, you are right about that.

23:09.280 --> 23:13.560
They sometimes come up with great strategies, and then the execution seems to sort of fumble.

23:13.560 --> 23:17.080
Well, I'll be happy if they just get it for the Nvidia Shield, although every time we

23:17.080 --> 23:19.940
talk about this, I'm reminded about the Moonlight project.

23:19.940 --> 23:24.440
So if you're interested in setting up Steam streaming with a free and open source project,

23:24.440 --> 23:25.840
go check out the Moonlight project.

23:25.840 --> 23:28.280
We've covered it before on Linux Unplugged.

23:28.280 --> 23:29.640
But that's it for this week.

23:29.640 --> 23:34.260
I want to mention we have some great end of year shows planned, including the wrap-up

23:34.260 --> 23:36.480
of the major stories of the year.

23:36.480 --> 23:39.120
And Joe put together a heck of a list, and we just double-checked it.

23:39.120 --> 23:41.320
We're checking our list.

23:41.320 --> 23:44.440
And there are some massive developments that are on there.

23:44.440 --> 23:46.060
I can't believe how big this year was.

23:46.060 --> 23:50.280
So go to linuxactionnews.com slash subscribe for all the ways to get new episodes so you

23:50.280 --> 23:52.560
get the regular shows and the end of year specials.

23:52.560 --> 23:56.840
Yeah, and you can go to linuxactionnews.com slash contact for ways to get in touch with

23:56.840 --> 23:57.840
us.

23:57.840 --> 24:03.600
And don't forget about Linux Fest Northwest, April 26 to the 28th, 2019 at the Bellingham

24:03.600 --> 24:04.600
Technical College.

24:04.600 --> 24:08.100
It is the 20th year of Linux Fest Northwest.

24:08.100 --> 24:15.260
They have some big plans, and Jupiter Broadcasting has massive plans, including a live Linux

24:15.260 --> 24:18.080
Action News recorded there at the show.

24:18.080 --> 24:20.640
So go check out Linux Fest Northwest.

24:20.640 --> 24:25.000
If you want to go, we'd love to see you there, April 26 through the 28th.

24:25.000 --> 24:27.200
Yeah, it's going to be good fun.

24:27.200 --> 24:30.740
We'll be back next Monday with our weekly take on the latest Linux and open source news.

24:30.740 --> 24:32.240
I'm at Chris LAS.

24:32.240 --> 24:33.600
I'm at Joe Ressington.

24:33.600 --> 24:36.660
Thank you for joining us, and we will see you next week.

24:36.660 --> 24:55.080
Until then, have a great day, bye-bye.
