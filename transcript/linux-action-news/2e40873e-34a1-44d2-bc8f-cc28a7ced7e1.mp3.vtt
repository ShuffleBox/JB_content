Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, our weekly take on Linux and the open source world.

00:16.020 --> 00:20.080
This is episode 18, recorded on September 10th, 2017.

00:20.080 --> 00:21.080
I'm Chris.

00:21.080 --> 00:22.080
And I'm Joe.

00:22.080 --> 00:23.080
Hello, Joe.

00:23.080 --> 00:24.360
It's good to be with you again.

00:24.360 --> 00:28.000
And I have one question for you at the top of our show, Joe.

00:28.000 --> 00:29.340
Are you a wearables guy?

00:29.340 --> 00:30.340
I am.

00:30.340 --> 00:32.340
I've got a Sony SmartWatch 3.

00:32.340 --> 00:33.340
And I love it.

00:33.340 --> 00:36.760
I've also got a Pebble that someone donated to me once, which I loved.

00:36.760 --> 00:41.480
But then after the developments with Pebble getting bought by Fitbit, I thought, maybe

00:41.480 --> 00:44.280
it's time to get an Android watch.

00:44.280 --> 00:46.440
And I wear it all the time.

00:46.440 --> 00:51.360
Generally only when I'm going out, because it's good for being polite in conversations.

00:51.360 --> 00:54.640
A quick glance at the wrist is better than getting your phone out of your pocket, I find.

00:54.640 --> 00:55.640
That is true.

00:55.640 --> 00:57.760
I've over the years become more of a wearable person.

00:57.760 --> 01:02.040
I started skeptical, also started with the Pebble myself, and just have tipped my toe

01:02.040 --> 01:04.960
in over and over again just to see where things are at.

01:04.960 --> 01:06.580
So the Connect watch got my attention.

01:06.580 --> 01:09.300
It's a smart watch with Asteroid OS.

01:09.300 --> 01:11.160
And it's launched a crowdfunding campaign.

01:11.160 --> 01:12.160
Yeah.

01:12.160 --> 01:16.000
So Asteroid OS is something that was kind of part of the reason for buying the Sony

01:16.000 --> 01:20.520
SmartWatch 3, because one of the early Alphas was available for that watch.

01:20.520 --> 01:23.320
And so I have actually had a chance to check it out.

01:23.320 --> 01:25.600
And OK, Bluetooth wasn't working.

01:25.600 --> 01:28.080
So I couldn't really check it out as a functional device.

01:28.080 --> 01:30.680
But it was looking quite nice back then.

01:30.680 --> 01:35.800
And to have it on hardware that it's specifically designed to go on looks good to me.

01:35.800 --> 01:42.680
And the fact that this is an open source watch OS, much more open source than Android wear

01:42.680 --> 01:44.560
is, it's great.

01:44.560 --> 01:50.020
The only problem is the crowdfunder is in French and very French centric.

01:50.020 --> 01:52.960
And the promotional materials are all in French.

01:52.960 --> 01:56.040
And so I think it's going to have a limited audience, which is a real shame, because I'd

01:56.040 --> 02:00.720
love to see a proper open source OS dominate this area.

02:00.720 --> 02:03.560
Is this the first time we've seen something like this since the Pebble?

02:03.560 --> 02:07.320
But this is even more open source and more out there than the Pebble was.

02:07.320 --> 02:10.680
And that to me is also noteworthy, because we've seen a lot of attempts at phones and

02:10.680 --> 02:13.400
tablets and convergence type devices.

02:13.400 --> 02:15.120
But this is a proper watch.

02:15.120 --> 02:16.120
It's small.

02:16.120 --> 02:17.200
It's reasonably well designed.

02:17.200 --> 02:21.620
I would say it has more of a sports look than a classic sort of showy watch.

02:21.620 --> 02:24.640
And it has hard painted seconds around the outside.

02:24.640 --> 02:29.840
And it's a circular display, a 1.4 inch 400 by 400 AMOLED display.

02:29.840 --> 02:35.280
It's got a MediaTek quad core processor, has support for Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, GPS.

02:35.280 --> 02:39.160
And depending on the model you get, you can also put a micro SIM in this.

02:39.160 --> 02:42.320
And it has a GSM card in there.

02:42.320 --> 02:47.800
That's kind of a kiss of death for me, because that just puts it in line with all those cheap

02:47.800 --> 02:52.360
Chinese watches that are standalone, running some sort of version of Android, usually really

02:52.360 --> 02:53.360
old version.

02:53.360 --> 02:56.600
And I had one of those to start with, and that was just terrible.

02:56.600 --> 03:00.160
But I suppose it can't hurt to have the cellular functionality to it.

03:00.160 --> 03:05.680
But as long as it pairs properly to an Android phone or an iOS device, I think that's the

03:05.680 --> 03:07.080
main thing.

03:07.080 --> 03:13.120
And it's kind of the Wi-Fi and cellular just kind of nice add-ons, I suppose.

03:13.120 --> 03:15.200
But you've got two different versions of it.

03:15.200 --> 03:19.480
One with 512 megabytes of RAM and one with a gig of RAM.

03:19.480 --> 03:22.780
And they are 4 gigs of storage or 8 gigs of storage.

03:22.780 --> 03:26.880
And the price is quite a reasonable price they're asking for on here.

03:26.880 --> 03:29.440
$120 gets you the cheaper one.

03:29.440 --> 03:35.060
And the expected retail price is only going to be $180, so 150 euros, which is very cheap

03:35.060 --> 03:36.060
for a wearable.

03:36.060 --> 03:40.600
Although I suppose it's quite a modestly spec'd one, so it's probably a fair price for it.

03:40.600 --> 03:44.720
I'm a big believer that health is a lot of the reasons these devices are being sold.

03:44.720 --> 03:49.160
People want to track everything from steps to sleep as a way to sort of quantify their

03:49.160 --> 03:54.920
own health and maybe start losing weight or just start to set personal goals.

03:54.920 --> 03:57.880
And I wonder, is it going to be competitive in that way?

03:57.880 --> 04:02.040
And I just mention it because at this price point, which is a very competitive price point,

04:02.040 --> 04:06.360
but at this particular price point, there's a lot of fitness players that do that job

04:06.360 --> 04:08.720
really well at that price point.

04:08.720 --> 04:10.680
Well that's the thing with wearables.

04:10.680 --> 04:14.240
The fitness trackers have done really well and everything else just hasn't.

04:14.240 --> 04:18.600
And so I think it's quite a niche market here that they're going after.

04:18.600 --> 04:25.040
And it's probably the market, people like me, open source people who are interested

04:25.040 --> 04:28.720
in having their notifications on their wrist basically.

04:28.720 --> 04:34.000
So as for mass market adoption, I can't see it unless it does the fitness stuff as well

04:34.000 --> 04:35.000
really well.

04:35.000 --> 04:38.640
But we've yet to see that because it's still quite an early stage.

04:38.640 --> 04:41.400
I'm going to watch this crowd funder with a lot of interest.

04:41.400 --> 04:44.440
Not going to bag it myself, obviously, but I'm going to watch it with a lot of interest

04:44.440 --> 04:48.740
just to see where a device like this, a wearable running asteroid OS goes.

04:48.740 --> 04:53.320
I'm sure loads of other people will watch it too.

04:53.320 --> 04:55.760
Otherwise they're all going to be getting together in Poland, I suppose.

04:55.760 --> 04:57.560
It's either that or the watch, right Joe?

04:57.560 --> 04:58.560
Yeah.

04:58.560 --> 05:03.840
So there's going to be a sailfish OS meetup in Krakow, Krakow, Poland.

05:03.840 --> 05:06.080
You see how I made you say it.

05:06.080 --> 05:10.400
I think in Poland it's called Krakow, but everyone else calls it Krakow.

05:10.400 --> 05:11.520
Anyway that doesn't really matter.

05:11.520 --> 05:13.860
So this shouldn't be news, right?

05:13.860 --> 05:19.160
Except for the CEO of Jola is actually going to be there.

05:19.160 --> 05:23.360
So it seems like if you're in Poland or can get to Poland pretty easily and you're interested

05:23.360 --> 05:27.160
in Jola and sailfish, you should be going to this thing.

05:27.160 --> 05:31.880
What would you ask him if you could go?

05:31.880 --> 05:34.520
That's a very good question that I should have thought about.

05:34.520 --> 05:36.160
Because I know I can't go, I haven't thought about it.

05:36.160 --> 05:41.200
So I suppose I'd ask realistically, how is the business side of things doing?

05:41.200 --> 05:43.200
Are you going to survive?

05:43.200 --> 05:46.000
And I suppose he's giving me a stock answer, but if I got him drunk enough, maybe he'd

05:46.000 --> 05:47.080
give me the truth.

05:47.080 --> 05:50.240
I would try to come up with a tactful way to ask him, what are you doing with the money

05:50.240 --> 05:54.080
you raise for the Sony Xperia X running sailfish?

05:54.080 --> 05:56.760
Are you paying off backers with that?

05:56.760 --> 05:57.840
Are you funding the business?

05:57.840 --> 06:00.800
Can you tell me where that money exactly is going?

06:00.800 --> 06:04.200
Yeah, that would be a good question to ask, definitely.

06:04.200 --> 06:08.960
So if anyone does go to this and speaks to Sammy, then do let us know.

06:08.960 --> 06:13.920
Because it sounds like a very good opportunity to give him a grilling and see exactly what's

06:13.920 --> 06:15.920
going on with sailfish.

06:15.920 --> 06:18.440
In the meantime, things are looking up for you lineage users.

06:18.440 --> 06:24.620
Yeah, so we've reported on Project Treble before, which is basically a modular underlying

06:24.620 --> 06:33.440
base for Android, which means that the device drivers and the proprietary blobs can sit

06:33.440 --> 06:40.000
underneath as a separate layer to the kind of UI and all of the rest of the Android stuff.

06:40.000 --> 06:44.480
And that was kind of uncertain for what it would mean for custom ROMs.

06:44.480 --> 06:51.120
Well, there's a story here on xdadevelopers.com, which is looking very positive because it

06:51.120 --> 06:57.700
might well be that if you have a Project Treble phone, then all of the difficult bit is taken

06:57.700 --> 07:03.760
care of by that, and then you can just swap out the Android bit for any custom ROM, any

07:03.760 --> 07:10.240
AOSP, ROM or lineage or whatever, which means that it's potentially going to be really easy

07:10.240 --> 07:12.280
to develop custom ROMs for these phones.

07:12.280 --> 07:16.960
Yeah, Errol Wright over at xdadevelopers.com puts a fine point on it in his article.

07:16.960 --> 07:23.080
He says, almost all the components inside the phone use an independent proprietary blob

07:23.080 --> 07:29.080
and requires patches and workarounds independently on each part so that newer software can take

07:29.080 --> 07:31.360
advantage of it, like the new version of Android.

07:31.360 --> 07:36.320
This is a truly time-consuming task, and the main reason why most stable custom ROMs like

07:36.320 --> 07:43.240
Lineage OS don't appear for two to three months after the final Android release drops to AOSP.

07:43.240 --> 07:48.720
All this effort also means the resulted ROM will only work on one device, or in the best

07:48.720 --> 07:54.400
case, a handful of identically or very similar devices, maybe with different names.

07:54.400 --> 07:59.280
But now, because of the way Project Treble has modularized this layer of Android with

07:59.280 --> 08:04.480
the device interactions and device drivers, all Treble devices on the market, once we

08:04.480 --> 08:09.640
get to that point, will be able to boot a generic stock AOSP build of Android.

08:09.640 --> 08:14.600
So this is going to take away most of the hassle of porting a custom ROM to an older

08:14.600 --> 08:15.680
device.

08:15.680 --> 08:19.040
If it can boot AOSP, it's going to be able to boot Lineage.

08:19.040 --> 08:20.880
Yeah, which is great news.

08:20.880 --> 08:25.360
But the kind of fly in the ointment you alluded to it there is that it needs to be a Project

08:25.360 --> 08:29.160
Treble phone, of which there are only three or four at the moment.

08:29.160 --> 08:33.640
And yes, Google is trying to push this standard, and I hope they can use their power with the

08:33.640 --> 08:36.800
OEMs to make it mandatory.

08:36.800 --> 08:42.880
But it means that all the old phones are still going to be as difficult to develop for, which

08:42.880 --> 08:46.520
we've got custom ROMs for some of them at the moment, the OnePlus One and the Nexus

08:46.520 --> 08:47.520
phones and stuff.

08:47.520 --> 08:52.560
But it's going to be incredibly difficult to convert those old phones to Project Treble.

08:52.560 --> 08:56.120
There's a kind of ray of hope at the end of the article, but I think that's wishful thinking

08:56.120 --> 08:57.120
really.

08:57.120 --> 08:58.720
I'd also add, it won't be flawless.

08:58.720 --> 09:02.700
Even once AOSP just builds and boots on the device, there's still going to be tweaks to

09:02.700 --> 09:05.600
some of the drivers for the camera and all these other things.

09:05.600 --> 09:10.280
So it's not 100% solution, but it takes care of the most challenging part of the problem.

09:10.280 --> 09:12.080
Yeah, well, here's hoping.

09:12.080 --> 09:15.360
Mozilla's taking on a challenging problem, and that's comments online.

09:15.360 --> 09:20.080
They think they've reinvented online comments, and they're targeting it directly at journalists.

09:20.080 --> 09:26.080
They've got to spend those billions somehow, and this week it's online comments.

09:26.080 --> 09:31.560
So they've got Talk, which is developed by The Coral Project, which is in association

09:31.560 --> 09:38.360
with some other people like the Washington Post and the Sydney Morning Herald and The

09:38.360 --> 09:39.360
Age.

09:39.360 --> 09:42.840
So there's quite a few people teaming up here, and Mozilla's pumping a bit of money into

09:42.840 --> 09:46.520
it, and it sounds quite good in theory.

09:46.520 --> 09:52.520
It's a nice, small, lightweight comment system that seems quite full-featured, easy moderation,

09:52.520 --> 09:58.400
that kind of thing, but people are just moving away from comments, and that's what it's trying

09:58.400 --> 10:03.780
to address, fair enough, but websites are discouraging comments or turning them off

10:03.780 --> 10:07.480
left, right, and center and just driving people towards social media and just let Twitter

10:07.480 --> 10:09.840
or Facebook or whatever handle it.

10:09.840 --> 10:13.520
So I can see why they want to do this, they want to decentralize it, but there has to

10:13.520 --> 10:18.040
be the will for people to decentralize it, and are you going to take back the burden

10:18.040 --> 10:21.680
of running your own comments and moderating them and paying people to do that if you're

10:21.680 --> 10:22.680
a big company?

10:22.680 --> 10:26.080
I can't see it being hugely successful, unfortunately.

10:26.080 --> 10:28.900
That might be why they're targeting journalism, particularly.

10:28.900 --> 10:32.760
So you mentioned it earlier, Fairfax Media's websites in Australia, including the Sydney

10:32.760 --> 10:37.320
Morning Herald and The Age are taking part of this, as well as the Washington Post, and

10:37.320 --> 10:43.600
the idea is they work with Mozilla and the Project Coral Group, and they self-host, I

10:43.600 --> 10:46.640
don't know if it's on-premises or not, an instance of Talk.

10:46.640 --> 10:51.240
Now Talk says that they've been informed by a huge amount of research into online communities.

10:51.240 --> 10:56.200
They commissioned academic studies and held workshops around the world to find out what

10:56.200 --> 11:00.760
works, and also pushed guides to help newsrooms change their strategies.

11:00.760 --> 11:03.880
In other words, they marketed heavily by writing papers.

11:03.880 --> 11:08.120
But they do have some key principles I like, you own the data, you being the outfit that

11:08.120 --> 11:10.600
runs the Talk server, and it's 100% free.

11:10.600 --> 11:12.240
It's public and available for anyone to run.

11:12.240 --> 11:15.000
You don't have to be a newspaper that would want to use this.

11:15.000 --> 11:19.840
They really position themselves, though, as improving journalism through engagement, and

11:19.840 --> 11:24.340
they talk a lot about that, and they talk about digital journalism revolutionizing how

11:24.340 --> 11:26.640
the news engages with its audience.

11:26.640 --> 11:33.720
That's a lot of big hyperbole, but there is a little bit of sound business logic to Mozilla

11:33.720 --> 11:36.640
being one of the brands behind a platform like this.

11:36.640 --> 11:40.880
Assuming the journalism business has a need for a product like this, Mozilla's a pretty

11:40.880 --> 11:46.440
trusted brand in this space, and I think this is actually a decent angle for them to look

11:46.440 --> 11:47.440
into.

11:47.440 --> 11:51.320
In terms of them hosting it, because you've got the option to self-host, but Mozilla could

11:51.320 --> 11:53.880
have a supported hosted version that they charge you for.

11:53.880 --> 11:54.880
I think it's more than that.

11:54.880 --> 11:58.720
It's Mozilla being willing to be such a large contributor to the Coral Project, and it's

11:58.720 --> 12:04.240
Mozilla willing to work with the Washington Post and help commission these studies.

12:04.240 --> 12:07.880
I think they're building on top of a well-trusted online brand.

12:07.880 --> 12:11.680
But how does it make them money?

12:11.680 --> 12:12.680
Money Joe?

12:12.680 --> 12:13.680
That's not...

12:13.680 --> 12:14.680
Oh, geez, Joe.

12:14.680 --> 12:15.680
How dare you?

12:15.680 --> 12:16.680
It must be...

12:16.680 --> 12:17.780
I would assume it must be through hosting.

12:17.780 --> 12:22.760
It must be eventually there, or maybe the real money's in consulting, setting it up,

12:22.760 --> 12:26.720
doing a study with the business, coming in, looking at how they engage with their audience

12:26.720 --> 12:30.320
and comparing it to their academic studies and the papers they've published, and then

12:30.320 --> 12:34.720
writing them a recommendation, and then, of course, supplying the IT workforce to implement

12:34.720 --> 12:35.720
that recommendation.

12:35.720 --> 12:37.240
It could be a very lucrative business.

12:37.240 --> 12:38.960
Yeah, that actually makes sense.

12:38.960 --> 12:40.040
You don't have to host it yourself.

12:40.040 --> 12:43.120
You can go and set it up for them on their own servers, and yeah, that's actually quite

12:43.120 --> 12:44.120
a good business model.

12:44.120 --> 12:50.920
Yeah, maybe you should do that kind of thing, Chris.

12:50.920 --> 12:55.200
Speaking of self-hosting, go to DigitalOcean.com, create an account, and use our promo code

12:55.200 --> 12:56.200
Here's The Thing.

12:56.200 --> 13:00.000
Now, they have systems starting at just three cents an hour that I love and even lower,

13:00.000 --> 13:04.000
and they go all the way up to these monster systems with 200 gigs of RAM, the latest Intel

13:04.000 --> 13:09.200
Xeon processors, and every single system at DigitalOcean has SSD storage, and when you

13:09.200 --> 13:14.000
need more, you can attach block storage up to 16 terabytes, and it shows up to Linux

13:14.000 --> 13:15.640
as an actual block device.

13:15.640 --> 13:19.480
It's really fun to play with for educational or to put it in production, and that's how

13:19.480 --> 13:24.480
all DigitalOcean is, with built-in monitoring and alerting, performance metrics, and guides

13:24.480 --> 13:25.480
for days.

13:25.480 --> 13:29.680
Go to DigitalOcean.com, use the promo code Here's The Thing, and then go take advantage

13:29.680 --> 13:32.240
of their documentation, but here's a little secret.

13:32.240 --> 13:36.760
It's available to everyone, and Brian B. up there has a guide about object storage versus

13:36.760 --> 13:37.820
block storage.

13:37.820 --> 13:40.320
It really makes sense of all of it.

13:40.320 --> 13:44.960
DigitalOcean.com, get a system spun up in less than 55 seconds with a super sweet, easy-to-use

13:44.960 --> 13:47.960
dashboard and straightforward API.

13:47.960 --> 13:52.320
With systems that start at just $5 a month, use our $10 promo code Here's The Thing, all

13:52.320 --> 13:57.600
one word at DigitalOcean.com.

13:57.600 --> 14:00.920
So recently, we were talking about blockchain technology and how it's a little bit more

14:00.920 --> 14:06.560
than just Bitcoin, and one aspect of it is ICOs, initial coin offerings.

14:06.560 --> 14:11.720
Well, bad news if you're in China, because they have been banned by the government.

14:11.720 --> 14:15.520
Bad news if you're a Bitcoin investor, because the price has been all over the place.

14:15.520 --> 14:21.520
It shot up to $5,000 a few days ago, and then rocketed back down to $4,200.

14:21.520 --> 14:26.160
That's a lot of movement for one day, and it's coming from a financial regulator out

14:26.160 --> 14:27.160
of China.

14:27.160 --> 14:32.320
The regulator described initial coin offerings as a form of unapproved illegal public financing

14:32.320 --> 14:35.520
that raises suspicions of fraud and criminal activity.

14:35.520 --> 14:36.520
Yikes.

14:36.520 --> 14:38.980
And this is not just China, is it?

14:38.980 --> 14:42.200
It's looking like this is going to happen in the US and Europe as well.

14:42.200 --> 14:45.780
Yeah, similar regulation could be coming to the US for sure.

14:45.780 --> 14:50.940
This July, the US Securities and Exchange Commission warned that ICOs were being used

14:50.940 --> 14:57.040
to sidestep the law, and last week, the agency issued another statement describing coin offerings

14:57.040 --> 14:59.160
as potential scams, quote unquote.

14:59.160 --> 15:03.960
Yeah, and I've heard other people throw around Ponzi scheme as a term.

15:03.960 --> 15:04.960
That sounds familiar to me.

15:04.960 --> 15:09.560
Yeah, there's a real challenge though with these peer-to-peer decentralized blockchain-based

15:09.560 --> 15:12.240
technologies.

15:12.240 --> 15:15.280
Blocking them is sort of like blocking the internet or water.

15:15.280 --> 15:16.840
Eventually, it finds a path.

15:16.840 --> 15:21.400
Yeah, but what about this rumor that China's going to shut down the Bitcoin exchanges there?

15:21.400 --> 15:25.560
I mean, that has been a big part of the devaluation of Bitcoin this week.

15:25.560 --> 15:29.520
Yes, this has definitely played a role in that price going all over the place.

15:29.520 --> 15:34.320
China is a huge part of Bitcoin right now, with lots of mining and exchange activity

15:34.320 --> 15:35.580
over there.

15:35.580 --> 15:39.320
And it's possible this is coming from the Bitcoin exchanges themselves.

15:39.320 --> 15:43.780
They're apparently getting some warning signs, and they're awaiting clarification that authorities

15:43.780 --> 15:49.520
may order them to shut down, which the news has just caused Bitcoin to go crazy.

15:49.520 --> 15:54.680
And if that does happen, presumably the price will drop for a bit, but then exchanges will

15:54.680 --> 15:59.260
spring up in probably other Asian countries, and then the price will go back up again.

15:59.260 --> 16:01.280
So that would be a good time to buy.

16:01.280 --> 16:02.280
Indeed.

16:02.280 --> 16:05.000
And assuming this doesn't impact mining, I think you're probably right.

16:05.000 --> 16:08.960
There will be an initial sale on Bitcoin as everybody processes this news.

16:08.960 --> 16:12.160
But assuming they don't shut down the mining, which is just running computers doing math,

16:12.160 --> 16:15.800
I don't imagine they would, I don't think it's going to long term affect Bitcoin much.

16:15.800 --> 16:20.520
Yeah, I mean, they might try and block ports and stuff, but these people are pretty technical.

16:20.520 --> 16:26.040
The miners in China, I'm sure they will get around it with DNS hacks or whatever, proxies,

16:26.040 --> 16:27.040
that kind of thing.

16:27.040 --> 16:29.400
So I can't see them shutting down the mining.

16:29.400 --> 16:35.440
But yeah, I think short term, it's not looking good for Bitcoin, but I cannot see it going

16:35.440 --> 16:36.440
down long term.

16:36.440 --> 16:39.040
It just seems to be going up and up and up, and maybe I'm wrong.

16:39.040 --> 16:44.120
Maybe it is a bubble, but I kind of changed my opinion on it in the last year because

16:44.120 --> 16:48.720
I just kept thinking that it was going to crash and burn and go back to one cent or

16:48.720 --> 16:49.800
something.

16:49.800 --> 16:54.960
And you know, people are be ordering two pizzas for whatever.

16:54.960 --> 16:57.680
But it's just it's not it's not going to happen.

16:57.680 --> 16:58.920
It just keeps growing.

16:58.920 --> 17:01.880
The thing to keep in the back of your mind about Bitcoin, and it's not to say something

17:01.880 --> 17:05.600
couldn't come along and replace it, but you have that limited amount.

17:05.600 --> 17:06.960
That's also a factor.

17:06.960 --> 17:09.640
So there is a finite amount of bitcoins that will ever be mined.

17:09.640 --> 17:14.580
And we are racing towards that deadline right now, which puts an extra spin on all of this,

17:14.580 --> 17:18.560
on the value of the coin, on what people are going to do with the fundamental technologies

17:18.560 --> 17:20.000
after that's happened.

17:20.000 --> 17:22.080
It adds a whole other dimension to it.

17:22.080 --> 17:25.960
And you know, it's almost like someone should start a show and they should just podcast

17:25.960 --> 17:27.240
about Bitcoin all the time.

17:27.240 --> 17:29.400
Yeah, maybe it could be your plan B.

17:29.400 --> 17:30.400
Maybe, maybe.

17:30.400 --> 17:34.520
You know, speaking of those miners in China, I bet storage is a big issue for them.

17:34.520 --> 17:39.600
So they're probably rushing to install the new ButterFS driver for Windows.

17:39.600 --> 17:43.600
Yeah, that's twice you've made a joke about this and not taking it seriously.

17:43.600 --> 17:44.600
I can't help it.

17:44.600 --> 17:45.600
I can't help it.

17:45.600 --> 17:48.000
You know, Joe, Joe, here's the thing.

17:48.000 --> 17:49.720
Here's the thing, Joe.

17:49.720 --> 17:55.320
If ButterFS was 100% solid and this code, this driver code was 100% solid, like we're

17:55.320 --> 17:59.680
years into it being solid, then it's like serious usable storage technology.

17:59.680 --> 18:04.280
But when it's an alpha driver for a file system that appears to be in beta state, I just can't

18:04.280 --> 18:05.280
help it.

18:05.280 --> 18:06.280
I can't help but laugh.

18:06.280 --> 18:07.280
Well, hang on.

18:07.280 --> 18:08.280
This is a 1.0 release.

18:08.280 --> 18:10.520
That means it's completely finished and ready for production, right?

18:10.520 --> 18:11.520
Yeah, it does.

18:11.520 --> 18:12.520
It does.

18:12.520 --> 18:13.520
It does look good.

18:13.520 --> 18:17.120
I mean, it feels like it's only ready for production after years of being in production

18:17.120 --> 18:18.240
when it comes to storage.

18:18.240 --> 18:23.560
But it's got all of the major features, including RAID 0, 1, 10, 5, 6.

18:23.560 --> 18:24.720
It's got caching.

18:24.720 --> 18:28.440
It's got discovery of partitions, supports ACLs and symlinks.

18:28.440 --> 18:34.240
It has free caching, I mean, free space caching, and it has compression support.

18:34.240 --> 18:35.360
It's got trim support for SS.

18:35.360 --> 18:36.360
I mean, it's all there, Joe.

18:36.360 --> 18:37.360
It's all there.

18:37.360 --> 18:39.680
It's arguably more there than Butterfess itself.

18:39.680 --> 18:43.380
Yeah, I guess it's been in the works for more than a year or two.

18:43.380 --> 18:45.160
So I have been making some fun.

18:45.160 --> 18:46.160
You're right.

18:46.160 --> 18:47.760
I respect it, though, and I appreciate it.

18:47.760 --> 18:51.160
I know if I'm ever on a Windows machine and all of a sudden I need an extended 4 driver,

18:51.160 --> 18:53.160
I am so thankful when I find one.

18:53.160 --> 18:54.160
Yeah, exactly.

18:54.160 --> 18:58.400
And if you are a SUSE user, then this might come in useful.

18:58.400 --> 19:00.920
I think that's just the root partition, isn't it?

19:00.920 --> 19:07.960
Like the storage tends to be something else, so it might not be that useful, but it's good

19:07.960 --> 19:13.440
to see that Windows users can access Butterfess now at least.

19:13.440 --> 19:16.660
Yeah, I suppose so.

19:16.660 --> 19:18.680
And I don't judge anyone for using it.

19:18.680 --> 19:19.720
Have a good time.

19:19.720 --> 19:20.720
Let us know how it goes.

19:20.720 --> 19:25.160
Go to jupitabroadcasting.com slash contact and send us an email or at linuxactionnews

19:25.160 --> 19:26.640
on Twitter if you've tried this.

19:26.640 --> 19:28.400
Meanwhile, let's take a look at Docker Hub.

19:28.400 --> 19:34.280
Yeah, some stats about the base distribution in Docker images on Docker Hub that I found

19:34.280 --> 19:36.200
really surprising this week.

19:36.200 --> 19:37.460
Yeah, I did as well.

19:37.460 --> 19:40.120
So this is an analysis that the Anchor platform does.

19:40.120 --> 19:45.380
They look at a bunch of different data sources, and so it's as reliable as their methodology,

19:45.380 --> 19:50.000
but they're pulling it from Docker Hub, and soon they're going to expand to Amazon EC2

19:50.000 --> 19:51.000
and other ones.

19:51.000 --> 19:56.000
But right now they're just pulling from Docker Hub, and they show Debian with a surprising

19:56.000 --> 20:04.640
61.7% lead as the base OS for these containers, and Alpine is number two at 19.7%.

20:04.640 --> 20:11.360
And then coming in at a distant third, they show Ubuntu at 7.8%.

20:11.360 --> 20:13.440
Now that is the big surprise to me.

20:13.440 --> 20:17.520
Alpine I would expect to be very popular because it's so lightweight, it's so slimmed down,

20:17.520 --> 20:20.820
it's perfect for containerization.

20:20.820 --> 20:24.720
But then my understanding was that Ubuntu was up there with it, and that maybe it would

20:24.720 --> 20:31.240
be kind of those two sharing, you know, 50-50 of the biggest chunk of it, and then all the

20:31.240 --> 20:36.000
other ones, CentOS, BusyBox, you know, the smaller ones taking a small slice.

20:36.000 --> 20:38.980
But I just had no idea that Debian was so popular.

20:38.980 --> 20:42.320
This data surprised me because some of the numbers, the market share I had heard for

20:42.320 --> 20:46.160
Ubuntu was like 70% of containers.

20:46.160 --> 20:52.540
To see Ubuntu represented at 7.8% leads me to think either a couple of things, Anchor's

20:52.540 --> 20:57.560
data is bogus, or that number is dramatically different depending on where you survey.

20:57.560 --> 21:01.840
Look at this on Docker Hub, that right there, let's stop there, Docker Hub contains a lot

21:01.840 --> 21:06.000
of hobby projects, a lot of things people are just throwing up there and trying out.

21:06.000 --> 21:11.020
If you were to look at things like Amazon EC2 or Azure, where people are running expensive

21:11.020 --> 21:15.320
instances, they're getting work done, I wonder if these numbers would be significantly different.

21:15.320 --> 21:19.320
So the platform you survey probably makes a huge difference in the results that you

21:19.320 --> 21:20.320
get.

21:20.320 --> 21:23.600
I expect to see a lot more Red Hat and a lot more Ubuntu, basically.

21:23.600 --> 21:30.200
Yeah, yeah, because CentOS is 3.7%, it has less market share than unknown.

21:30.200 --> 21:34.640
The only distribution that is more poorly represented on this chart is SUSE because

21:34.640 --> 21:38.440
they don't open SUSE and SUSE Enterprise don't even register on the map.

21:38.440 --> 21:45.460
Well again, you'd kind of expect to see SUSE on Azure and Amazon clouds rather than, as

21:45.460 --> 21:47.160
you say, more of the hobbyist stuff.

21:47.160 --> 21:54.440
So maybe when we get an analysis of that, which is promised by Anchor, then we will

21:54.440 --> 21:55.440
see that for sure.

21:55.440 --> 21:58.340
But this is another name clash, isn't it?

21:58.340 --> 22:00.760
How many tech things are there called Anchor?

22:00.760 --> 22:07.000
There's that podcasting thing, there's these guys, and then there's the portable chargers.

22:07.000 --> 22:08.720
It gets really confusing.

22:08.720 --> 22:12.000
It's an old pet peeve of mine, Joe, that seems like an old man's complaint, but why can't

22:12.000 --> 22:16.240
these kids figure out these names?

22:16.240 --> 22:18.360
So let's talk about NGINX.

22:18.360 --> 22:23.640
And it seems that they're growing up because at first it was kind of a really lightweight

22:23.640 --> 22:27.880
server and good to use as a load balancer and a proxy and that kind of stuff.

22:27.880 --> 22:31.440
But of course, they've got NGINX Plus, which is their proprietary commercial offering,

22:31.440 --> 22:36.600
and now they're looking to seriously expand that and basically become proper enterprise-y

22:36.600 --> 22:37.600
corporate.

22:37.600 --> 22:42.280
Yeah, an application platform is how they're positioning themselves with a suite of products

22:42.280 --> 22:44.840
that you put together and it makes a platform.

22:44.840 --> 22:51.640
So you take NGINX Plus, which combines a load balancer and a cache and a web server, and

22:51.640 --> 22:57.320
it's built on top of the open source NGINX, and then this platform also includes the NGINX

22:57.320 --> 23:00.800
Controller, which is like a centralized management component.

23:00.800 --> 23:04.360
Now you can see where it's maybe going to play a role in enterprise with internal applications

23:04.360 --> 23:06.600
built on top of Node.js and whatnot.

23:06.600 --> 23:12.200
Yeah, and they are now going to support Kubernetes as well, which is massive in the enterprise.

23:12.200 --> 23:15.400
Well, certainly if Canonical are to be believed.

23:15.400 --> 23:19.080
Containers and Kubernetes and all of that and centralized management, that's all the

23:19.080 --> 23:24.360
buzzwords and things you've got to do to play in this modern agile app world that Red Hat

23:24.360 --> 23:25.960
and Canonical are all going after.

23:25.960 --> 23:29.400
These are all the boxes you have to check, and NGINX is staying very competitive by doing

23:29.400 --> 23:30.400
this.

23:30.400 --> 23:34.300
To what extent do you think it's going to impact the open source version that millions

23:34.300 --> 23:35.720
of people are using?

23:35.720 --> 23:39.720
I'm going to hope that it just means increased funding for development.

23:39.720 --> 23:43.720
And I would imagine that they recognize keeping that open, keeping that available exactly

23:43.720 --> 23:49.080
as it is, is a key part to adoption and a key part to the integration they've seen in

23:49.080 --> 23:50.080
the industry.

23:50.080 --> 23:54.360
Yeah, because you need to learn something and you're not going to pay probably, whereas

23:54.360 --> 23:58.840
if you can just app get install it or, you know, yum install it or whatever, it gets

23:58.840 --> 24:04.240
to people who are learning it in the first place, sort of tied into NGINX, and then once

24:04.240 --> 24:08.860
they're working professionally with it, maybe they're going to be convinced of their company

24:08.860 --> 24:13.600
to pay for the NGINX Plus and this new application platform.

24:13.600 --> 24:17.800
NGINX is going through a process that we've seen a lot of open source projects over the

24:17.800 --> 24:20.740
years go through when they become really critical to the enterprise.

24:20.740 --> 24:25.960
We've seen this happen with Docker and other projects where businesses form around them.

24:25.960 --> 24:28.520
And then all of a sudden, they have a lot of different priorities.

24:28.520 --> 24:34.840
I'm hoping that in 2017, we can look back at all the previous attempts, learn from their

24:34.840 --> 24:37.000
mistakes and do it right.

24:37.000 --> 24:40.120
So far, I haven't heard a lot of people complaining about them screwing this up.

24:40.120 --> 24:41.640
Well here's hoping.

24:41.640 --> 24:46.560
