Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, our weekly take on Linux and the open source world.

00:16.080 --> 00:21.080
This is episode 76 recorded on October 21st, 2018.

00:21.080 --> 00:22.080
I'm Chris.

00:22.080 --> 00:23.080
And I'm Joe.

00:23.080 --> 00:24.080
Hello, Joe.

00:24.080 --> 00:28.280
It's good to be connected with you from the heart of the old school Silicon Valley at

00:28.280 --> 00:33.040
the Intel campus in Santa Clara, California, live from MeetBSD.

00:33.040 --> 00:34.760
We have a heck of a news lineup this week.

00:34.760 --> 00:35.760
Some big releases.

00:35.760 --> 00:40.360
Yeah, well, let's start with Ubuntu 18.10, but is it really a big release or is it a

00:40.360 --> 00:44.040
kind of minor point release for them because it's not an LTS?

00:44.040 --> 00:46.840
I think it depends on the kind of user that you are.

00:46.840 --> 00:50.100
In a weird way, even though this isn't an LTS release, there's some nice improvements

00:50.100 --> 00:51.720
in here for the server version.

00:51.720 --> 00:56.600
18.10 ships with OpenStack Rocky, which we just recently covered on TechSnap, and it

00:56.600 --> 01:01.080
includes the latest version of Kubernetes, version 1.12, which brings some increased

01:01.080 --> 01:07.120
security and scalability by automating the provision of clusters, which is sweet and

01:07.120 --> 01:11.120
is being pitched as a way to dynamically respond to your workload.

01:11.120 --> 01:14.400
And I mention all of that because those are two really big ticket items in the server

01:14.400 --> 01:16.920
world right now, and 18.10 ships with them by default.

01:16.920 --> 01:21.560
So if you're looking from the server user perspective, it's a pretty solid update.

01:21.560 --> 01:27.840
If you're looking from the desktop perspective, 18.10 introduces GNOME 3.3.0, which includes

01:27.840 --> 01:32.960
upstream performance patches and some vendor-applied performance patches by Canonical Directly,

01:32.960 --> 01:34.480
which make it really fly.

01:34.480 --> 01:37.520
It's the fastest GNOME desktop I've ever used.

01:37.520 --> 01:41.960
And it's got that new Yaru community contribute theme, which looks really sharp on high DPI

01:41.960 --> 01:42.960
displays.

01:42.960 --> 01:46.960
I was looking at that theme side by side with the old one earlier today, and I couldn't

01:46.960 --> 01:50.560
really decide whether I liked it more, really.

01:50.560 --> 01:54.380
In some sense, it's kind of more modern and a bit flatter.

01:54.380 --> 01:59.280
But then it's a bit garish, I find, the kind of bright orange and stuff.

01:59.280 --> 02:03.320
It was always orange before, but I'm not really sold on it, to be honest.

02:03.320 --> 02:04.640
I think that's a fair criticism.

02:04.640 --> 02:09.520
It is a bit in your face, and I could totally see why someone like yourself wouldn't be

02:09.520 --> 02:10.640
a huge fan of it.

02:10.640 --> 02:15.100
But in the modern era of 4K screens and whatnot, you kind of have to redo some of these themes

02:15.100 --> 02:17.000
anyways to make them look good.

02:17.000 --> 02:22.640
I think it looks pretty sharp, but I was looking on a really high-end Dell display, which was

02:22.640 --> 02:23.880
designed to really pop.

02:23.880 --> 02:28.320
And so the combination of the two together really made an impression on me.

02:28.320 --> 02:31.760
It almost is distracting, though, in some ways, in its brightness.

02:31.760 --> 02:34.440
Yeah, that's kind of how I felt about it, really.

02:34.440 --> 02:40.480
But it's funny, if you look at this announcement post from Canonical, it's very much kind of

02:40.480 --> 02:46.880
spreading the love across the various releases that 1810 makes up.

02:46.880 --> 02:52.720
From the cloud and server stuff and the desktop, they talk about improved gaming performance.

02:52.720 --> 02:56.400
They're very much trying to hedge their bets, aren't they, and not concentrate too much

02:56.400 --> 02:58.200
on one aspect of it.

02:58.200 --> 02:59.800
See, now, that I kind of disagree with.

02:59.800 --> 03:01.960
I think this is them more focused than ever.

03:01.960 --> 03:07.360
It's three succinct categories, cloud, desktop, and snaps.

03:07.360 --> 03:08.360
That's really it.

03:08.360 --> 03:15.560
Instead of a mobile and a TV and a netbook edition, it really is, this is the Canonical

03:15.560 --> 03:18.920
portfolio of solutions now, cloud, desktop, and snaps.

03:18.920 --> 03:24.140
I suppose that is true, but it feels like there was more emphasis on the desktop early

03:24.140 --> 03:26.960
on with Ubuntu.

03:26.960 --> 03:31.040
And then it kind of swung the other way to be, you know, the desktop seemed to be in

03:31.040 --> 03:34.000
maintenance mode for quite a long time.

03:34.000 --> 03:36.280
And now it's kind of swung back into the middle.

03:36.280 --> 03:37.280
Ah, yeah.

03:37.280 --> 03:39.600
It's getting more attention than it did for a while, you mean?

03:39.600 --> 03:41.080
Yeah, yeah.

03:41.080 --> 03:44.160
And yeah, I suppose you're right, ultimately, though, that they've kind of slimmed it down

03:44.160 --> 03:48.440
to these three categories, which kind of look nice to investors, don't they?

03:48.440 --> 03:51.200
Yeah, I think investors definitely have something to do with this.

03:51.200 --> 03:55.160
I think that's what the whole restructure has been about since they announced it, what

03:55.160 --> 03:57.240
is it, more than a year ago now.

03:57.240 --> 04:03.260
When they dropped Unity 8 and restructured the company, in particular, one of their goals

04:03.260 --> 04:06.040
was to make desktop development more sustainable.

04:06.040 --> 04:09.800
Switching to Gnome Shell meant they were no longer creating their own desktop environment.

04:09.800 --> 04:14.640
They didn't have to have all of those developers and engineers and artists on staff to produce

04:14.640 --> 04:17.500
that and maintain it, update it, and add new features.

04:17.500 --> 04:19.240
They could work with upstream code.

04:19.240 --> 04:23.120
And now we're seeing the third release since that restructure.

04:23.120 --> 04:25.940
And their Gnome implementation is pretty good.

04:25.940 --> 04:28.360
And they've got some of their own performance patches that they found.

04:28.360 --> 04:30.040
They've submitted those upstream as well.

04:30.040 --> 04:32.680
So Gnome Shell overall is getting better.

04:32.680 --> 04:36.160
And that helps all the distributions using Gnome Shell.

04:36.160 --> 04:39.960
And for myself, if I were a Gnome user, I would be making this update.

04:39.960 --> 04:41.240
I would be upgrading to 18.10.

04:41.240 --> 04:42.960
I would have already done it.

04:42.960 --> 04:45.280
I'm personally sticking on 18.04.

04:45.280 --> 04:49.760
But if I was a Gnome Shell user or a big Linux gamer, I would be making this update.

04:49.760 --> 04:54.440
Because not only do you get kernel 4.18, but there's updates to Mesa and Xorg to significantly

04:54.440 --> 04:55.680
improve game performance.

04:55.680 --> 05:01.200
So you combine that with the improved Gnome 3.30 performance, and that's a great desktop

05:01.200 --> 05:03.560
for Gnome Shell enthusiasts or Linux gamers.

05:03.560 --> 05:06.720
Well, I'm sitting here looking at Xubuntu 16.04.

05:06.720 --> 05:09.880
So I don't think there's much chance of me upgrading, I'm afraid.

05:09.880 --> 05:10.880
Wow, man.

05:10.880 --> 05:11.880
You know what?

05:11.880 --> 05:13.320
In a way, you should just ride that thing out to the end.

05:13.320 --> 05:15.420
I mean, that is the way to go at this point.

05:15.420 --> 05:16.420
You're so locked in.

05:16.420 --> 05:18.960
You might as well just take it all the way up to the red line.

05:18.960 --> 05:21.800
Well, that's what I did with 14.04.

05:21.800 --> 05:24.400
So I probably will do.

05:24.400 --> 05:28.620
But speaking of the flavors then, with Xubuntu, not much there of interest.

05:28.620 --> 05:33.000
And with the other flavors as well, nothing of great note, I don't think.

05:33.000 --> 05:38.880
Apart from Lubuntu, which has made the switch to LXQt by default now, and it feels like

05:38.880 --> 05:39.960
the right time to do it.

05:39.960 --> 05:42.640
Because having looked at it, I was really impressed.

05:42.640 --> 05:43.640
It's solid.

05:43.640 --> 05:45.120
I could really use it, I think.

05:45.120 --> 05:46.640
Well, I kind of want to know more about that.

05:46.640 --> 05:52.360
What is it specifically about LXQt or that desktop that's pushing those XFCE feels for

05:52.360 --> 05:53.360
you?

05:53.360 --> 05:56.160
Well, for a start off, you've got one panel at the bottom.

05:56.160 --> 05:59.840
I know XFCE doesn't have that by default, certainly, as Ubuntu, but it's easy enough

05:59.840 --> 06:01.020
to move the panel to the bottom.

06:01.020 --> 06:05.640
That's what I do with a start menu that's searchable, but simple.

06:05.640 --> 06:07.840
And it's modern at the same time.

06:07.840 --> 06:08.880
And that's what I like about it.

06:08.880 --> 06:10.600
It's light, but it's modern.

06:10.600 --> 06:15.940
It's not stuck on GTK2 and making the slow transition.

06:15.940 --> 06:17.280
It's based on Qt 5.

06:17.280 --> 06:19.620
It's modern technologies.

06:19.620 --> 06:25.280
It can work on a really low end system, had it run on a Core 2 Duo, and it was fine.

06:25.280 --> 06:29.440
But then it'll absolutely fly on an i5 or i7.

06:29.440 --> 06:32.960
So it's kind of almost leapfrogged Marte as far as I'm concerned.

06:32.960 --> 06:38.160
I know WinPress won't like to hear that, but it feels just right.

06:38.160 --> 06:42.680
I mean, I've been following the progress of it and there's been little bugs here and there.

06:42.680 --> 06:44.280
And I haven't tested it extensively.

06:44.280 --> 06:50.120
So I'm sure that there's probably little annoyances here and there, but it seems to be the right

06:50.120 --> 06:51.120
time.

06:51.120 --> 06:56.200
I think it was a good decision to do this now, one release after the LTS for Ubuntu.

06:56.200 --> 07:01.240
So we've got plenty of time now before 2004 when I think it's going to be absolutely rock

07:01.240 --> 07:02.240
solid.

07:02.240 --> 07:05.520
And the bottom line is, Lubuntu is the flavor to watch.

07:05.520 --> 07:08.920
Well speaking of that handsome Martin Wimpress, I was chatting with him on Linux Unplugged

07:08.920 --> 07:13.940
last week and he mentioned one of the really nice things about the 1810 development cycle

07:13.940 --> 07:17.520
is the work that went into getting a lot of the hardware working, the new drivers and

07:17.520 --> 07:18.560
whatnot.

07:18.560 --> 07:24.960
That does make its way back to 1804, the LTS release, as a hardware enablement stack.

07:24.960 --> 07:29.240
And that will likely ship as 18.04.2.

07:29.240 --> 07:32.880
And so those of us that are sticking with the LTS, actually, if we just wait a little

07:32.880 --> 07:35.360
bit, do eventually get some of these hardware goodies.

07:35.360 --> 07:37.440
I think that's a really cool cycle.

07:37.440 --> 07:40.800
And just something I wanted to point out that maybe non-Ubuntu users weren't aware of is

07:40.800 --> 07:44.240
that's kind of a nice perk of the LTS cycle on the Ubuntu side.

07:44.240 --> 07:47.980
Yeah, I'm in the planning stages of building a desktop at the moment.

07:47.980 --> 07:56.740
And if I do go for the 9th gen i5 or i7, I think I'm going to have to go newer than 1804.

07:56.740 --> 08:03.840
So it'll probably force me into this at least until the 0.2 release comes out for 1804.

08:03.840 --> 08:08.040
So yeah, I may well end up using this sooner than I think.

08:08.040 --> 08:13.200
And last but not least on the 1810 flavor side, if you happen to be lucky to find yourself

08:13.200 --> 08:19.360
getting one of those GPD Pocket 2 devices, there has been specific work in Ubuntu Mate

08:19.360 --> 08:21.720
to make those devices sing with Linux.

08:21.720 --> 08:25.080
So go check that out, because now those devices ship with Windows by default, and you got

08:25.080 --> 08:26.080
to take care of that.

08:26.080 --> 08:30.060
Man, it really makes me want one, even though there's nothing I would do with it apart from

08:30.060 --> 08:31.060
just play with it.

08:31.060 --> 08:32.060
I know.

08:32.060 --> 08:33.060
I really want one.

08:33.060 --> 08:37.000
I actually was talking to Wimpy about it, and it sounds like it may be possible to turn

08:37.000 --> 08:38.840
that thing into a mobile podcast studio.

08:38.840 --> 08:39.840
Oh yeah, it's powerful.

08:39.840 --> 08:40.840
Yeah.

08:40.840 --> 08:45.520
I just kind of don't have that desire and never leave the house.

08:45.520 --> 08:46.760
I know.

08:46.760 --> 08:49.800
It sounds like punishment, really, because then you have to go out and see people, and

08:49.800 --> 08:53.000
you have to go out and be in the environment and get a sunburn.

08:53.000 --> 08:54.000
It's just no good.

08:54.000 --> 08:55.000
Yeah, exactly.

08:55.000 --> 08:59.540
Well, before we move off Ubuntu, we should quickly mention the statistics site that they've

08:59.540 --> 09:00.980
put up now.

09:00.980 --> 09:06.440
We got some of these statistics a couple of months ago, and there was a promise to have

09:06.440 --> 09:13.540
more detail before the 18.10 cycle was over, and right at the last minute, I think it was

09:13.540 --> 09:18.160
Will Cook who posted this, so we've got some more detail.

09:18.160 --> 09:23.760
I mean, I don't think there's anything hugely surprising from these stats, and the one thing

09:23.760 --> 09:29.200
that everyone wanted, absolute numbers of users, well, we're not getting that by the

09:29.200 --> 09:30.200
looks of things.

09:30.200 --> 09:34.560
I'll tell you what else I was hoping we'd see that isn't in there is a breakdown of

09:34.560 --> 09:40.760
which versions of Ubuntu are still the most active, 14.04, 16.04, et cetera, et cetera.

09:40.760 --> 09:44.400
There is a couple of interesting things in here, though.

09:44.400 --> 09:49.520
Turns out 80% of people do clean installs, which I think is interesting, versus an upgrade,

09:49.520 --> 09:57.820
and 99% of people surveyed, which was 66% of the installs, use X11, so the Wayland future

09:57.820 --> 09:59.800
is still far, far away.

09:59.800 --> 10:01.760
Well, that's because it's not by default.

10:01.760 --> 10:05.560
You have to kind of enable that afterwards, don't you, so that's, I don't know where that

10:05.560 --> 10:07.920
1% came from, really.

10:07.920 --> 10:11.560
From those of us trying it, I think, which is actually pretty surprising.

10:11.560 --> 10:15.760
Now there's also all other kinds of information here, like most popular screen sizes, the

10:15.760 --> 10:20.840
types of disk layouts and partition types, so we would recommend just go read through

10:20.840 --> 10:25.240
it, because they've got some great visuals, too, and you can find a link at linuxactionnews.com

10:25.240 --> 10:26.240
slash 76.

10:26.240 --> 10:30.440
Yeah, and it's also worth mentioning that these are updated dynamically as more and

10:30.440 --> 10:34.800
more people install, so they're not necessarily going to be the same stats today as they are

10:34.800 --> 10:36.320
in a couple of weeks.

10:36.320 --> 10:40.600
But another huge release this week is elementary OS 5.0 Juno.

10:40.600 --> 10:44.800
This is a big release for a few reasons, probably the number one reason being that they take

10:44.800 --> 10:49.660
their time between releases, and elementary OS has a release model that's not based on

10:49.660 --> 10:53.740
date, but it's based on open bugs, and after they burn through the open bugs, then they

10:53.740 --> 10:58.720
generate another release, which tends to trigger more bugs, then they burn through those, they

10:58.720 --> 11:03.160
release a release candidate, which then triggers more bugs, they burn down all of those bugs,

11:03.160 --> 11:04.640
and then they have a release.

11:04.640 --> 11:08.840
What that means for end user is you generally have a pretty polished product by the time

11:08.840 --> 11:10.480
the version ships.

11:10.480 --> 11:14.640
You don't really have to wait around for the updates, and there's a lot in this new release.

11:14.640 --> 11:18.380
They've jumped to version 5 with that, and it's to represent how far they've come as

11:18.380 --> 11:22.100
a development platform, but also as a distribution.

11:22.100 --> 11:27.920
They have one of the larger chunks of market shares when you step outside Ubuntu proper,

11:27.920 --> 11:32.320
and they've become a well-respected distribution over the last couple of years, and sort of

11:32.320 --> 11:37.420
shaken free that Mac clone stigma for the most part, and people recognize it now as

11:37.420 --> 11:43.800
just a well-engineered, refined user experience, and it really comes together in Juno.

11:43.800 --> 11:46.160
But how can we possibly talk about all the features here?

11:46.160 --> 11:52.240
There's a post on Medium from Cassidy, and it is, well, on Medium it says a 31 minute

11:52.240 --> 11:53.240
read.

11:53.240 --> 11:57.520
It's 7,000 words, I think, and it took me a fair while to get through it all, and there's

11:57.520 --> 12:04.720
just so much refinements, so many new features, I just don't know which one to even start

12:04.720 --> 12:05.720
with.

12:05.720 --> 12:06.880
It really is worth a look, this post.

12:06.880 --> 12:11.000
Even if you're never going to run elementary OS in a thousand years, it's worth a look.

12:11.000 --> 12:16.200
I don't think any other distro does it this well, and it's a massive summary with lots

12:16.200 --> 12:20.960
of really well-done pictures, and the thing I take away from it is this app center is

12:20.960 --> 12:22.320
a big deal.

12:22.320 --> 12:27.380
There's a lot of other stuff in here, development platform stuff, UI changes, performance improvements,

12:27.380 --> 12:32.680
the code app gets a lot of love, but the app center, with its pay-what-you-want model,

12:32.680 --> 12:38.920
and now this new you-can-try-out-an-app, which, what a brilliant idea, try before you buy.

12:38.920 --> 12:40.160
Who would have ever thought of that?

12:40.160 --> 12:44.560
You can try out an app, and then if you like it, when it does future updates down the road,

12:44.560 --> 12:48.800
say two, three weeks, you're still actively using the app, and you go to do an update,

12:48.800 --> 12:52.680
it'll say, hey, would you like to maybe kick this guy or gal two bucks?

12:52.680 --> 12:54.080
Because now could be the time to do it.

12:54.080 --> 12:58.600
I mean, you could just skip that, but I like this system where you can try out the application,

12:58.600 --> 13:02.640
and then later on, you can be like, hey, yeah, you know what, I will kick him 10, 15 bucks.

13:02.640 --> 13:03.640
Here you go.

13:03.640 --> 13:04.640
And then it does the update.

13:04.640 --> 13:06.560
Yeah, and you can go in at any time and do that.

13:06.560 --> 13:11.680
If you download it for free and get some value out of it, then you can just go...

13:11.680 --> 13:13.240
It's quite subtle, actually.

13:13.240 --> 13:18.920
Right at the bottom of the page on the app center for each application, you just click

13:18.920 --> 13:23.440
the little button, and then you can chuck them a few bucks, which I think it's nice

13:23.440 --> 13:24.440
that it's subtle.

13:24.440 --> 13:29.160
They would have probably got some criticism if they'd made it more front and center, but

13:29.160 --> 13:31.580
it's nice that that's an option now.

13:31.580 --> 13:37.360
And it's good to see that someone on the Linux desktop is trying to make some money out of

13:37.360 --> 13:38.960
it, because a lot of work goes in.

13:38.960 --> 13:44.520
And what they're trying to do is have this coherent experience, which to be honest is

13:44.520 --> 13:45.520
not for me.

13:45.520 --> 13:49.120
I don't really like the way it all works.

13:49.120 --> 13:53.640
I am the stick in the mud who's using XFCE, as I've said many, many times.

13:53.640 --> 13:57.120
But they have a vision, and they want to fund that.

13:57.120 --> 14:02.360
And I think that it's refreshing that they're not kind of ashamed of wanting to do that.

14:02.360 --> 14:06.080
I think you can understand a lot of their actions when you look at it in the frame of

14:06.080 --> 14:09.620
they're attempting to do the things that nobody else has done.

14:09.620 --> 14:12.560
Because a lot of the other things that have been attempted haven't been successful on

14:12.560 --> 14:13.660
a large scale.

14:13.660 --> 14:16.940
And so it doesn't make a lot of sense to keep repeating the same mistakes.

14:16.940 --> 14:21.840
So with elementary, they're attempting to do something a little different.

14:21.840 --> 14:26.040
And I really think the Linux desktop ecosystem needs that.

14:26.040 --> 14:29.960
Well, last week, we talked about Redis and how the company who makes that, Redis Labs,

14:29.960 --> 14:34.640
had made a change to the license, which hadn't gone down very well in the community.

14:34.640 --> 14:36.640
And this week, it's the turn of MongoDB.

14:36.640 --> 14:41.600
Yeah, it appears MongoDB is a bit miffed at some cloud providers, especially in Asia,

14:41.600 --> 14:46.400
are taking its open source code and then offering a hosted commercial version of the database,

14:46.400 --> 14:50.300
and then not contributing back to MongoDB in any way.

14:50.300 --> 14:55.720
As you probably know, MongoDB has traditionally been licensed under the AGPL version three.

14:55.720 --> 15:00.680
And they released a statement about a change in license to the server side public license.

15:00.680 --> 15:06.360
They write, MongoDB was previously licensed under the GNU AGPL version three, which meant

15:06.360 --> 15:11.280
companies who wanted to run MongoDB as a publicly available service had to open source their

15:11.280 --> 15:16.040
software or obtain a commercial license from MongoDB, the company goes on to explain.

15:16.040 --> 15:21.560
However, MongoDB's popularity has led some organizations to test the boundaries of the

15:21.560 --> 15:24.120
AGPL version three.

15:24.120 --> 15:27.360
So they've gotten a little upset about this, just like Redis essentially was.

15:27.360 --> 15:33.120
So they're switching to the SSPL, which stands for server side public license.

15:33.120 --> 15:37.420
And it explicitly states that anybody who wants to offer a MongoDB type service or really

15:37.420 --> 15:42.100
any other software that uses this license needs to either get a commercial license or

15:42.100 --> 15:44.920
open source the service to give it back to the community.

15:44.920 --> 15:47.220
That's the essence of the license that they've switched to.

15:47.220 --> 15:50.760
Now once again, this is not an OSI compliant license.

15:50.760 --> 15:54.840
So it is technically not going to be open source from now on.

15:54.840 --> 16:00.320
And that includes patched old versions as well, which they're changing the license to.

16:00.320 --> 16:05.600
MongoDB have said that they have reached out to the OSI and are waiting for their approval

16:05.600 --> 16:07.840
of this license.

16:07.840 --> 16:15.160
And asterisk, I'm not a liar and all that, but I can't see it happening because this

16:15.160 --> 16:23.080
license, the server side public license mandates that you have to release all of the code that's

16:23.080 --> 16:25.500
running your service.

16:25.500 --> 16:29.380
And people have kind of taken that to the extreme of, well, what if your service is

16:29.380 --> 16:30.740
running on AWS?

16:30.740 --> 16:33.480
Does that mean that they have to open source all of AWS?

16:33.480 --> 16:36.060
Well, that's not happening, obviously.

16:36.060 --> 16:39.920
And so it might mean that people just can't use MongoDB anymore.

16:39.920 --> 16:42.400
See I actually think it's even worse than that.

16:42.400 --> 16:47.600
And there's a real problem here that the MongoDB CTO and co-founder points out in a statement

16:47.600 --> 16:48.800
he released.

16:48.800 --> 16:53.360
It reads, the market is increasingly consuming software as a service, creating an incredible

16:53.360 --> 16:57.760
opportunity to foster a new wave of great open source server side software.

16:57.760 --> 17:02.280
Unfortunately, once an open source project becomes interesting, it is too easy for a

17:02.280 --> 17:07.380
cloud vendor who have not developed the software to capture all of the value but contribute

17:07.380 --> 17:09.320
nothing back to the community.

17:09.320 --> 17:14.080
So they're making the case that this is a huge problem that open source software is

17:14.080 --> 17:15.080
going to face.

17:15.080 --> 17:19.920
As they get more and more popular and they provide a server service, a provider comes

17:19.920 --> 17:25.640
along, packages it up as a service, starts selling a monthly rate for it, maybe even

17:25.640 --> 17:30.880
forks it to a degree and starts contributing their own features and requirements to it,

17:30.880 --> 17:34.600
and never contributes any of the improvements back to the project upstream.

17:34.600 --> 17:38.680
But to your point, the genie is already out of the bottle.

17:38.680 --> 17:40.240
There's no going back.

17:40.240 --> 17:45.240
If MongoDB makes a big change here, these vendors have already been disrespectful to

17:45.240 --> 17:47.480
the open source spirit and license.

17:47.480 --> 17:49.200
So they're not going to change their behavior.

17:49.200 --> 17:53.280
They'll maintain a fork of it before any of these license changes go into effect.

17:53.280 --> 17:57.680
And they'll just continue to run the old version as long as they can make a profit from it.

17:57.680 --> 18:00.280
To me, it seems like there's no going back at this point.

18:00.280 --> 18:05.360
Well, except that it's going to be fairly difficult to maintain that fork because any

18:05.360 --> 18:11.840
security fixes for the older versions are going to be released under this same SSPL,

18:11.840 --> 18:17.520
which means that, again, like we talked about last time with Redis, any fixes would have

18:17.520 --> 18:19.560
to be kind of clean room.

18:19.560 --> 18:25.520
Although, if we're talking about providers in China that don't really care about the

18:25.520 --> 18:31.680
license or maybe don't understand it properly, then maybe they're just going to plow on regardless

18:31.680 --> 18:36.360
and just merge these fixes and maintain it themselves.

18:36.360 --> 18:38.080
That seems more likely to me.

18:38.080 --> 18:41.800
That's what I suspect is going to happen for a large portion of the offenders.

18:41.800 --> 18:47.060
And then for the others, maybe future companies, they just won't use MongoDB.

18:47.060 --> 18:48.920
And so the project sort of loses on both fronts.

18:48.920 --> 18:53.000
Yeah, I mean, it's not like MongoDB is the only database out there, right?

18:53.000 --> 18:54.580
There's plenty to choose from.

18:54.580 --> 18:56.680
It's a really hard spot for the project.

18:56.680 --> 19:00.040
And I don't know, it's something I'm going to think about more and I think deserves further

19:00.040 --> 19:04.640
discussion because MongoDB and Redis are not the only projects that are going to face this

19:04.640 --> 19:05.640
issue.

19:05.640 --> 19:07.800
Well, I've discussed this with Chris Lamb from Debian.

19:07.800 --> 19:15.480
And he said that he has no intention of forking MongoDB like he has with Redis.

19:15.480 --> 19:19.780
And he said it remains to be seen whether this license turns out to violate the Debian

19:19.780 --> 19:25.780
free software guidelines, and that if it does, then it's not going to be able to be in Debian

19:25.780 --> 19:27.360
and the downstream distros as well.

19:27.360 --> 19:29.720
So that's going to affect Ubuntu.

19:29.720 --> 19:34.840
And from his tone, I think that he strongly suspects that he didn't say it outright, but

19:34.840 --> 19:39.960
I think he suspects that it's not going to conform to the Debian free software guidelines.

19:39.960 --> 19:46.560
So it's potentially going to be a very bad thing for MongoDB in that it may just fade

19:46.560 --> 19:47.560
into obscurity.

19:47.560 --> 19:51.120
If it's not available in distros, then who's going to use it?

19:51.120 --> 19:54.880
It's all those Docker users, Joe, of course.

19:54.880 --> 19:57.760
Well Google finds itself in a bit of hot water.

19:57.760 --> 20:02.040
And the way they're going to get out of it apparently is by making money.

20:02.040 --> 20:04.040
Well that's a sign of a good business, isn't it?

20:04.040 --> 20:08.240
If you're in trouble, find a way to make some money to fix it.

20:08.240 --> 20:15.320
Yeah, so this goes back to July when the European Commission fined Google $5 billion for breaking

20:15.320 --> 20:20.960
EU antitrust laws with regards Android and how they've been treating the OEMs.

20:20.960 --> 20:25.400
And although Google said they would appeal it and are in the process of appealing it,

20:25.400 --> 20:30.320
they've also decided to do something about it just in case, kind of hedge their bets.

20:30.320 --> 20:36.080
And so now they've pretty much complied, by the looks of things, just about.

20:36.080 --> 20:38.160
We'll get back to that making money thing again.

20:38.160 --> 20:43.400
I don't know if the EU is going to kind of stand for that, but I think ultimately it's

20:43.400 --> 20:44.880
kind of worked, hasn't it?

20:44.880 --> 20:46.120
Yeah, this might do the trick.

20:46.120 --> 20:51.360
And there's so many echoes of Microsoft and Internet Explorer here, it is giving me some

20:51.360 --> 20:52.360
nostalgia.

20:52.360 --> 20:55.520
See, everyone listening to this show knows how this works.

20:55.520 --> 20:59.640
If you want an officially blessed version of Android from Google with all of the goodies,

20:59.640 --> 21:05.440
you have to ship certain applications as part of the OEM agreement with Google.

21:05.440 --> 21:07.160
And that right there is the rub.

21:07.160 --> 21:12.360
Forcing the bundling of certain applications like the Chrome browser and the Google search

21:12.360 --> 21:16.640
app is exactly the kind of behavior that got Microsoft in trouble back in the day and just

21:16.640 --> 21:19.760
got Google in trouble now.

21:19.760 --> 21:25.960
So this means that devices in the region, in the European Economic Area, can be sold

21:25.960 --> 21:30.880
with Gmail, Google Maps, and YouTube, Google Play, and so on, but no Google search app

21:30.880 --> 21:31.880
in Chrome.

21:31.880 --> 21:36.300
Instead, manufacturers can just include their own search engines and web browsers, or they

21:36.300 --> 21:41.680
can license those for around 40-ish US greenbacks from Google.

21:41.680 --> 21:46.600
Yeah, and up until now, any manufacturer who wanted to ship Android with all the Google

21:46.600 --> 21:53.280
stuff weren't allowed by that license agreement to ship other devices with forks of Android.

21:53.280 --> 21:57.000
And that was a huge sticking point, whereas now they're going to be able to.

21:57.000 --> 22:04.680
But where I think this may fall down for Google, and again, I'm not a lawyer, is if you are

22:04.680 --> 22:09.520
a manufacturer and you are willing to play the game and ship all of the stuff that Google

22:09.520 --> 22:13.160
wants and have it all placed exactly where you want, then it looks like you'll be able

22:13.160 --> 22:15.680
to get away with that for free.

22:15.680 --> 22:18.580
Whereas if you make any changes, that's when you're going to have to start paying on a

22:18.580 --> 22:23.760
per-device basis, and that is governed by the pixel density, which is quite a clever

22:23.760 --> 22:30.440
way for Google to tie the amount to the value of the device, because pixel density generally

22:30.440 --> 22:34.020
scales with the retail price.

22:34.020 --> 22:39.040
So it's pretty clever of them, but I just can't help but feel that that may not go down

22:39.040 --> 22:41.080
well with the European Commission.

22:41.080 --> 22:44.560
Well they sent a letter to the European Commission trying to justify all of this, and in there

22:44.560 --> 22:47.520
there's a very interesting admission.

22:47.520 --> 22:54.920
See they claim that the bundling of the Google Search app and Chrome is how they essentially

22:54.920 --> 22:56.960
finance the development of Android.

22:56.960 --> 23:00.720
Here's what they write, since the pre-installation of Google Search and Chrome together with

23:00.720 --> 23:05.960
our other apps helped us fund the development and free distribution of Android, we will

23:05.960 --> 23:11.600
introduce a new paid licensing agreement for smartphones and tablets shipped to the EEA.

23:11.600 --> 23:14.160
Android will remain free and open source.

23:14.160 --> 23:18.520
So the case they're making to the Commission is, look, by taking these apps out, we can't

23:18.520 --> 23:22.800
fund the development of Android anymore, so we have to charge a little bit of money.

23:22.800 --> 23:26.920
But the implicit statement is, all that monitoring that we get from Google Search and Chrome

23:26.920 --> 23:30.120
is how we really generate revenue.

23:30.120 --> 23:32.440
That's what I read as the implicit statement there.

23:32.440 --> 23:37.880
Well yeah, and another key aspect to this is that if those OEMs don't play ball with

23:37.880 --> 23:42.640
Google, they're going to miss out on their slice of that search revenue.

23:42.640 --> 23:47.720
And so even if they're shipping Chrome and Search, if they're not doing things exactly

23:47.720 --> 23:53.560
how Google wants, then they're just going to be cut off from what I imagine is a very

23:53.560 --> 23:57.120
serious chunk of the revenue that comes from selling these devices.

23:57.120 --> 24:01.720
Because as we know, they've basically lost leaders at this point.

24:01.720 --> 24:06.360
Almost all of the OEMs selling Android devices don't actually make money from them.

24:06.360 --> 24:11.560
It's only this money afterwards that they're getting from the search revenue that makes

24:11.560 --> 24:13.160
it even worth bothering with.

24:13.160 --> 24:14.760
It's good to have that big lever.

24:14.760 --> 24:17.360
It's good to be the king and Google sitting there with that big lever.

24:17.360 --> 24:23.740
And they've come up with a really clever solution to this by licensing it and essentially leaning

24:23.740 --> 24:27.160
on the business dependency that these OEMs have with Google.

24:27.160 --> 24:30.800
Yeah, but again, I'm not convinced that the European Commission are going to let them

24:30.800 --> 24:31.800
get away with it.

24:31.800 --> 24:37.160
It might be a long protracted battle again, but maybe that's what Google's plan is here.

24:37.160 --> 24:40.480
Just keep moving the goalposts and just keep one step ahead of them.

24:40.480 --> 24:44.200
Well, I guess we can all look forward to another riveting Google legal battle.

24:44.200 --> 24:45.200
Yeah.

24:45.200 --> 24:46.200
All right.

24:46.200 --> 24:51.900
Well, let's end with an update, I suppose, to this Linux code of conduct situation.

24:51.900 --> 24:56.120
There was a lot of controversy when this change happened and when the code of conduct was

24:56.120 --> 24:59.360
brought in from both sides.

24:59.360 --> 25:03.880
Some people saying that it was far too much and some people were saying it wasn't enough.

25:03.880 --> 25:08.520
But I think the main problem was that there wasn't really that much clarity at the time.

25:08.520 --> 25:15.160
It had been kind of rushed out and kind of cobbled together without much community involvement

25:15.160 --> 25:17.760
or any community involvement really.

25:17.760 --> 25:22.480
But now we've got a little bit more clarity because Greg has posted an interpretation

25:22.480 --> 25:25.120
document and a mediator has been appointed.

25:25.120 --> 25:30.120
Yeah, it turns out Greg KH was working in private in some super secret chat room or mailing

25:30.120 --> 25:34.160
list with kernel maintainers and developers on addressing their feedback and trying to

25:34.160 --> 25:39.040
come up with solutions to essentially all of the contentious issues around the code

25:39.040 --> 25:42.640
of conduct, but doing so in private so that way they could come to some consensus before

25:42.640 --> 25:44.360
they took all of this out.

25:44.360 --> 25:48.320
And like you just mentioned, they appointed that conflict mediator.

25:48.320 --> 25:53.280
So she will be the initial contact point for mediation and she's the legal director for

25:53.280 --> 25:55.560
the Software Freedom Law Center.

25:55.560 --> 25:59.360
So in the place before it was the technical advisory board, she sort of steps in between

25:59.360 --> 26:00.360
there.

26:00.360 --> 26:02.680
And then the other thing, just a note, we don't have to read the whole thing.

26:02.680 --> 26:05.080
We can link it in the show notes if you're interested, but there is a part in here I

26:05.080 --> 26:10.600
like in the part of the document, the interpretation document that describes how to read the code

26:10.600 --> 26:11.600
of conduct.

26:11.600 --> 26:15.280
There's a line in here that says, in the end, be kind to each other.

26:15.280 --> 26:17.420
It's really what the end goal is for everybody.

26:17.420 --> 26:22.080
We know everyone is human and will fail at times, but the primary goal for all of us

26:22.080 --> 26:26.160
should be to work toward amicable resolutions of problems.

26:26.160 --> 26:28.880
Enforcements of the code of conduct will be the last resort option.

26:28.880 --> 26:34.920
And I guess also worth mentioning, they also clarified where you're a representative of

26:34.920 --> 26:36.800
the kernel community or not.

26:36.800 --> 26:38.740
And it's much more clear.

26:38.740 --> 26:43.660
And they essentially say, if you are misbehaving in some other forum, it's their rules, their

26:43.660 --> 26:48.520
code of conduct that are applicable to you, not ours, with the exception of, as they put

26:48.520 --> 26:51.100
it, extreme circumstances.

26:51.100 --> 26:54.320
Now I've seen a bit of backlash to this.

26:54.320 --> 26:58.640
I was hoping that this was going to kind of put the fire out, but it seems to have just

26:58.640 --> 27:05.080
poured oil on it, really, in that the people who were kind of screaming about social justice

27:05.080 --> 27:07.580
worries and all that, this has not appeased them.

27:07.580 --> 27:10.960
This has just somehow made it worse for them.

27:10.960 --> 27:15.060
But when I was reading through it myself, I just thought, well, this all looks very

27:15.060 --> 27:23.480
standard, corporate kind of policy that normally wouldn't be out in the open, but it doesn't

27:23.480 --> 27:28.800
seem that much different from a big organization, well, any organization of about the size of

27:28.800 --> 27:31.160
the Linux kernel community.

27:31.160 --> 27:36.000
You know, it's funny you say that, because I've been down here at MeetBSD, and this hasn't

27:36.000 --> 27:37.000
come up at all.

27:37.000 --> 27:38.140
And this just hasn't been on the radar.

27:38.140 --> 27:43.660
So I read the story, I read through the mailing list post by Greg and a couple of follow ups,

27:43.660 --> 27:46.020
and I read the interpretation document.

27:46.020 --> 27:50.840
And my takeaway was, okay, well, that kind of clears up some of the concerns I had.

27:50.840 --> 27:51.960
All right, I'm feeling much better.

27:51.960 --> 27:54.120
This seems very reasonable.

27:54.120 --> 27:55.440
And I walked away from it.

27:55.440 --> 27:59.500
And I haven't been on any threads about it or any comments section because I've been

27:59.500 --> 28:01.220
here at MeetBSD.

28:01.220 --> 28:04.880
And so I'm coming into this with zero internet outrage impressions.

28:04.880 --> 28:06.340
I haven't even been on Twitter.

28:06.340 --> 28:10.320
So I came into it clean thinking this seems like it's a good way to address this.

28:10.320 --> 28:13.840
It seems like Greg's really got a handle on the situation.

28:13.840 --> 28:17.960
And it seems like it solved a lot of the up in the air questions we had.

28:17.960 --> 28:19.560
I had no idea there was any outrage.

28:19.560 --> 28:20.800
But of course there is.

28:20.800 --> 28:21.800
I should have known.

28:21.800 --> 28:27.120
Yeah, you're kind of like that dog in the This is Fine cartoon, I think, just completely

28:27.120 --> 28:29.400
blissfully unaware of all the fire around you.

28:29.400 --> 28:31.360
I'm just hanging out with the BSD guys.

28:31.360 --> 28:33.180
And they're just pretty chill in general, really.

28:33.180 --> 28:34.840
So I just thought everything was cool.

28:34.840 --> 28:37.800
Yeah, well, we will have to see because this is fairly recent news.

28:37.800 --> 28:44.240
We'll have to see over this week whether or not these initial comments and, you know,

28:44.240 --> 28:50.320
discussion that I've seen pan out to be kind of the majority opinion, but I'm really hoping

28:50.320 --> 28:51.320
not.

28:51.320 --> 28:53.320
I think we just need to draw a line under this.

28:53.320 --> 28:59.480
Yes, okay, is the kind of corporatization, I suppose, of Linux kernel development.

28:59.480 --> 29:01.800
But this has been coming for a long time.

29:01.800 --> 29:03.880
We're talking about millions of dollars here.

29:03.880 --> 29:05.360
Yeah, it's been that already.

29:05.360 --> 29:06.400
It's already been that.

29:06.400 --> 29:08.720
We just haven't really seen it outwardly.

29:08.720 --> 29:14.320
This is the formalization of what is a bureaucracy around one of the world's largest open source

29:14.320 --> 29:15.400
projects.

29:15.400 --> 29:20.360
And I think it proves that this is a living document that can be amended and changed as

29:20.360 --> 29:21.440
it suits the project.

29:21.440 --> 29:26.760
They've just demonstrated that and they did so in an organized fashion with buy off by

29:26.760 --> 29:28.600
many members of the project now.

29:28.600 --> 29:31.980
So it's not just a handful, it's many members of the project.

29:31.980 --> 29:35.720
So I think this, if nothing, should at least appease people in the fact that it shows that

29:35.720 --> 29:38.360
they can make changes, that this is a living document.

29:38.360 --> 29:39.520
And that's good to see too.

29:39.520 --> 29:43.240
Oh man, you do love a bit of wishful thinking, don't you?

29:43.240 --> 29:45.880
I think it's the BSD guys rubbing off on me because they're wishful, they're eventually

29:45.880 --> 29:47.200
going to take over the world.

29:47.200 --> 29:49.360
I want to give a quick shout out to IX Systems.

29:49.360 --> 29:53.040
They put together a heck of an event at Meet BSD California.

29:53.040 --> 29:58.800
And it has been really cool to spend the week at the Intel campus inside Intel and going

29:58.800 --> 30:03.240
in their auditorium and also getting to hang out in their cafeteria and walk around on

30:03.240 --> 30:04.400
their campus.

30:04.400 --> 30:10.040
The BSD people have some cool stuff in the works and they're facing some major changes

30:10.040 --> 30:11.040
in the project.

30:11.040 --> 30:14.860
