00:00.000 --> 00:10.600
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, episode 191, recorded on May 30, 2021, from an undisclosed

00:10.600 --> 00:11.600
location.

00:11.600 --> 00:12.600
I'm Chris.

00:12.600 --> 00:13.600
And I'm Wes.

00:13.600 --> 00:14.600
Hello, Wes.

00:14.600 --> 00:15.600
Let's do the news.

00:15.600 --> 00:22.360
And we start this week with a follow-up to the FreeNode exodus we discussed last week.

00:22.360 --> 00:26.240
As we record, there have been a number of new developments.

00:26.240 --> 00:31.760
After the staff revolt, FreeNode management took over hundreds of IRC channels for what

00:31.760 --> 00:34.320
they called policy violations.

00:34.320 --> 00:41.240
Essentially, channels that referenced moving to Libera chat were seized and repermissioned.

00:41.240 --> 00:46.040
This just seems like really weak sauce on FreeNodes part 700 channels being impacted.

00:46.040 --> 00:47.040
That's a major blunder.

00:47.040 --> 00:52.240
And it sounds like a poorly written script just went loose and caused lots of problems.

00:52.240 --> 00:56.740
And it doesn't make one confident that the new team running this thing has the experience

00:56.740 --> 00:59.880
or ability to run a large scale IRC network.

00:59.880 --> 01:06.640
To make matters worse, the new management seems to be a bit fluid in their interpretation

01:06.640 --> 01:09.260
of the network's policies.

01:09.260 --> 01:14.840
Several days ago, FreeNode modified its off topic use policy, forbidding inappropriate

01:14.840 --> 01:17.040
advertising to read.

01:17.040 --> 01:21.080
Off topic channels are required to act in good faith in accordance to the FreeNode community

01:21.080 --> 01:28.920
as a whole, and went on to define inappropriate advertising to include, quote, unused channels

01:28.920 --> 01:32.400
for the purpose of polluting the channel list results.

01:32.400 --> 01:37.360
Or put another way, I think they're saying empty rooms that are just pointing users to

01:37.360 --> 01:41.320
another server are not permitted.

01:41.320 --> 01:46.780
So it appears, at least for a while, that the new FreeNode management had chosen to

01:46.780 --> 01:53.280
interpret its rules in a way that basically disallows the promotion of competing services

01:53.280 --> 01:54.840
or networks.

01:54.840 --> 02:00.940
But as we record today, the policies have been updated again and no longer include that

02:00.940 --> 02:07.540
specific language, instead just listing advertising more generally.

02:07.540 --> 02:13.440
In response to the criticism of the channel takeovers, the new king of FreeNode, Andrew

02:13.440 --> 02:19.640
Lee, posted a global notice across the network stating in the recent policy enforcement,

02:19.640 --> 02:25.800
some channels were erroneously included, we greatly apologize for the inconvenience.

02:25.800 --> 02:30.760
Now I'll just say that this has been a very complicated story since we started covering

02:30.760 --> 02:31.760
it.

02:31.760 --> 02:35.280
And it's definitely warranted a bit of a wait and see approach until more details could

02:35.280 --> 02:37.160
come to light.

02:37.160 --> 02:39.920
But right now, we've waited.

02:39.920 --> 02:42.440
And I think unfortunately, we're seeing.

02:42.440 --> 02:48.100
I mean, even if you kind of interpret these actions in the most charitable light possible,

02:48.100 --> 02:50.600
as you mentioned, Chris, it's kind of just sloppy.

02:50.600 --> 02:54.720
It doesn't give me a lot of faith that these new stewards are in it for the best aspects

02:54.720 --> 02:56.160
of the community.

02:56.160 --> 03:00.640
And while clearly FreeNode needed some cleaning up before all this incident, it seems like

03:00.640 --> 03:05.560
Libera Chat is off to a surprisingly good start with some new energy and momentum.

03:05.560 --> 03:09.640
And it might end up being in a better position than the previous incarnation of FreeNode

03:09.640 --> 03:10.640
ever was.

03:10.640 --> 03:14.720
And that's really it, Wes, is I think if you just took the last two weeks in isolation,

03:14.720 --> 03:18.400
you just forget about all of the previous history and all of the drama, and you just

03:18.400 --> 03:24.040
look at the two networks as two competing options for IRC users, Libera Chat has a really

03:24.040 --> 03:26.200
good track record the last couple of weeks.

03:26.200 --> 03:31.240
They have scaled up in response to an inundation of users and new rooms.

03:31.240 --> 03:35.760
They've also been keeping up for the most part with support tickets and communicating

03:35.760 --> 03:40.160
through social media outlets in a way that has been consistent and welcoming.

03:40.160 --> 03:45.320
And over on the FreeNode side, there continues to be decisions that were apparent accidents

03:45.320 --> 03:50.520
that maybe didn't mean to be done, but just, oops, everybody got upset and more people

03:50.520 --> 03:51.520
left.

03:51.520 --> 03:55.920
And that has been a pattern we're seeing over on the FreeNode side now.

03:55.920 --> 04:00.760
And I think there's a statement that Andrew Lee gave to the register that, and it's a

04:00.760 --> 04:05.200
longer statement, but a part of it that I think really encapsulates where Mr. Lee's

04:05.200 --> 04:06.200
head is at.

04:06.200 --> 04:10.960
I understand the frustration these people feel after making decisions.

04:10.960 --> 04:11.960
They regret.

04:11.960 --> 04:18.680
And if my being a target of their attack gives them purpose in life, I'm very happy and honored

04:18.680 --> 04:21.680
to be able to give them such purpose.

04:21.680 --> 04:27.380
I don't know how all the damage and attack on me helps push their agenda, though.

04:27.380 --> 04:30.280
The battle I'm fighting isn't about me.

04:30.280 --> 04:32.840
It's about FOSS and the internet.

04:32.840 --> 04:38.440
If that just doesn't give you a little insight into where Mr. Lee's mindset is at, he's the

04:38.440 --> 04:41.200
victim in this scenario.

04:41.200 --> 04:47.320
And I think just looking at Liberia Chat two weeks on, I'm pretty impressed, Wes.

04:47.320 --> 04:50.240
Realistically, I've been thinking, what should Jupiter Broadcasting do?

04:50.240 --> 04:55.480
Should I move from GeekShed, which has been great, to Liberia Chat just to take advantage

04:55.480 --> 05:00.360
of the fact that a lot of our listeners may have set up connections to Liberia Chat now,

05:00.360 --> 05:03.040
and we'd like to be in on that conversation and hang out with all of our friends in the

05:03.040 --> 05:04.040
free software community.

05:04.040 --> 05:08.160
And I've been thinking about it, because it's just, I don't know, it's fun to see excitement

05:08.160 --> 05:13.060
in some ways and people using IRC again, but then part of me thinks maybe I should stay

05:13.060 --> 05:18.360
on GeekShed because maybe it would be great to have multiple large IRC networks and not

05:18.360 --> 05:19.920
just one large IRC network.

05:19.920 --> 05:23.080
That's one of the beauties of IRC is it's an open protocol.

05:23.080 --> 05:26.680
It does seem like they've got some great momentum going.

05:26.680 --> 05:32.960
Users who've stood up, helped organize things in an atmosphere of confusion and chaos.

05:32.960 --> 05:37.320
And of course, with this exodus we mentioned, they've got some new converts over to their

05:37.320 --> 05:39.000
network.

05:39.000 --> 05:44.240
Folks like Gentoo, Fedora, and Ubuntu all having jumped ship and finding a new home

05:44.240 --> 05:46.640
over on Liberia Chat.

05:46.640 --> 05:51.480
I still think there's a bit of a wait and see aspect here though, because really in

05:51.480 --> 05:55.780
the IRC world, it's the community and the users and the channels that are going to decide

05:55.780 --> 05:58.520
what happens here.

05:58.520 --> 06:00.760
Good news, everybody.

06:00.760 --> 06:03.280
Pwned passwords has gone open source.

06:03.280 --> 06:09.520
Now, if you're not familiar, pwned passwords is the password search specific feature for

06:09.520 --> 06:14.840
the have I been pwned service, which aggregates all kinds of information from those data breaches

06:14.840 --> 06:21.720
that are always going on and tries to let you know when your information has been breached.

06:21.720 --> 06:26.960
Since its inception, it's really grown and now serves close to 1 billion requests per

06:26.960 --> 06:28.640
month.

06:28.640 --> 06:31.420
We should be clear though, because it's a little confusing.

06:31.420 --> 06:36.840
The entire organization and website have I been pwned is in the process of going open

06:36.840 --> 06:41.960
source and the pwned passwords search feature, that's the first step and one of the pieces

06:41.960 --> 06:44.520
we actually have code for now.

06:44.520 --> 06:49.040
Interestingly too, the project is joining the.NET Foundation and it will be the.NET

06:49.040 --> 06:53.380
Foundation's first incubation project, Troy Hunt, the original project author, and he's

06:53.380 --> 06:55.200
also a Microsoft regional director.

06:55.200 --> 07:00.240
He built the service on Azure, so it kind of makes sense that it could end up here.

07:00.240 --> 07:05.080
He's open sourced the code for the pwned password search, so that way the project has a sustainable

07:05.080 --> 07:08.720
future and can start receiving community contributions.

07:08.720 --> 07:12.160
Troy put it pretty elegantly, but in short it was, this has been a great tool for the

07:12.160 --> 07:15.400
community, now it's time for the community to take care of the tool.

07:15.400 --> 07:20.200
For their part, the.NET Foundation will be providing various supportive structure and

07:20.200 --> 07:26.280
services, think things like mentorship, sponsors, and administrative and technical services

07:26.280 --> 07:31.680
of all the other boring business like things that just need to happen in the background.

07:31.680 --> 07:39.080
More interestingly though, Troy Hunt also announced a partnership with the FBI.

07:39.080 --> 07:44.120
Apparently they reached out to him and were wondering if they could submit fresh compromised

07:44.120 --> 07:46.960
passwords to the pwned password service.

07:46.960 --> 07:47.960
How about that, Chris?

07:47.960 --> 07:53.320
I was like, wow, kind of spooky, but then I started thinking about it and it does make

07:53.320 --> 07:54.320
sense.

07:54.320 --> 07:59.160
As Hunt explained, the FBI is really involved in all kinds of investigations, they come

07:59.160 --> 08:06.720
across all kinds of botnets and compromised passwords, so why not take that time that

08:06.720 --> 08:11.400
public money paid for to collect that information and give it back to a centralized database

08:11.400 --> 08:13.440
that can help people stay protected?

08:13.440 --> 08:18.720
It could be extremely valuable, fresh, relevant information that could be continually being

08:18.720 --> 08:19.720
added.

08:19.720 --> 08:23.960
Assuming, you know, that the partnership works out and that the information they submit is

08:23.960 --> 08:26.560
accessible by us average folk.

08:26.560 --> 08:32.320
It's kind of great to see the normally very secretive FBI opening up a little bit and

08:32.320 --> 08:34.880
working with open source.

08:34.880 --> 08:40.640
And speaking of secrets being revealed, the world was changed forever this week when Google's

08:40.640 --> 08:48.600
long in development, from scratch, Linux competitor of an operating system, Fuchsia OS, finally

08:48.600 --> 08:51.560
shipped.

08:51.560 --> 08:57.320
Some owners of the first generation Nest Hub received an update this week that changed

08:57.320 --> 09:04.720
the device to Fuchsia instead of the normally Linux based Cast OS it was running before.

09:04.720 --> 09:06.920
In place upgrade, how about that?

09:06.920 --> 09:10.800
Yeah, kind of sneaky, you got to be in the preview program right now to get it.

09:10.800 --> 09:15.640
It'll roll it out to everybody else over time, though, you're not really going to notice

09:15.640 --> 09:21.320
because the front end UI that the user experiences is a flutter based UI.

09:21.320 --> 09:27.840
So it runs the same on Linux and Fuchsia, so you're not really gonna be able to tell.

09:27.840 --> 09:34.320
However, if you go into the Google Home app, and you go into the settings for that Nest

09:34.320 --> 09:39.440
Hub, and you look at the legal notices, you'll notice there's a difference between them,

09:39.440 --> 09:44.680
I believe, because when I tap mine right now, I get a local port that's running actually

09:44.680 --> 09:49.680
on the Nest Hub, and it gives me the Android Apache license.

09:49.680 --> 09:51.680
So I'm going to keep checking that I am in the preview program.

09:51.680 --> 09:54.080
But as far as I can tell, I'm not I haven't switched over yet.

09:54.080 --> 09:58.240
But like I say, I may not actually even be able to tell once it's happened.

09:58.240 --> 10:02.660
It's like the most low key rollout of this OS we've been talking about forever.

10:02.660 --> 10:06.520
We really have been talking about it forever, or at least you have.

10:06.520 --> 10:12.680
I mean, way back in 2016, I remember you covering the speculation when we first heard rumors

10:12.680 --> 10:13.680
about Fuchsia.

10:13.680 --> 10:16.320
I think that was Linux action show episode 431.

10:16.320 --> 10:22.060
Yeah, yeah, the rumors of a Fuchsia OS.

10:22.060 --> 10:24.600
And the original articles are still on the web.

10:24.600 --> 10:28.480
And it's so funny, because even back then we could smell it was a Linux replacement.

10:28.480 --> 10:30.840
Yeah, I think you picked up on that right away.

10:30.840 --> 10:34.800
It was also interesting to see that even way back then they were planning to use Flutter

10:34.800 --> 10:38.760
and Dart, which was kind of strange, because even this year, we're introducing Flutter

10:38.760 --> 10:42.120
and Dart as something new that we kind of, you know, explain to folks that aren't in

10:42.120 --> 10:44.040
that space.

10:44.040 --> 10:48.680
Fascinating to see how long it takes for these things to actually get anywhere close to maturity.

10:48.680 --> 10:53.280
Even at the scale of Google, you don't launch these things and switch over in a night or

10:53.280 --> 11:00.120
a year or even a few years, which is why being here now having followed it, it's both notable

11:00.120 --> 11:05.160
that we're seeing Fuchsia out in the wild and kind of extremely unremarkable.

11:05.160 --> 11:08.680
It's boring and we've expected it for a while.

11:08.680 --> 11:13.400
But in all of this, I mean, it's still quite early and probably we'll see more of these

11:13.400 --> 11:17.440
devices switching out to Fuchsia sometime in the future.

11:17.440 --> 11:18.680
Yeah, I could see that.

11:18.680 --> 11:24.280
I could see a lot of their kind of low-resource IoT style devices getting Fuchsia and then

11:24.280 --> 11:28.440
maybe another partner like Samsung and it kind of just grows from there.

11:28.440 --> 11:31.840
And then, you know, years down the road, now it's the phones and then it's the tablets

11:31.840 --> 11:33.760
and then it's it's the Chromebooks.

11:33.760 --> 11:38.480
It's just all one little little chunk of land at a time.

11:38.480 --> 11:42.840
And if you're curious to see what Fuchsia is like, well, some developers out there that

11:42.840 --> 11:47.120
have put a lot of effort into making kind of like a mix of Fuchsia and Linux decided

11:47.120 --> 11:50.920
to put together a project called Portable Fuchsia Emulator or F image.

11:50.920 --> 11:55.440
It just simply packages up the minimum you need to get a Fuchsia OS environment up and

11:55.440 --> 11:59.440
running in an emulator, and it includes a pre-built version of Fuchsia itself.

11:59.440 --> 12:02.200
And I mean, it's bare bones, but you can get in there, you can play around with and actually

12:02.200 --> 12:04.680
see what this environment is like.

12:04.680 --> 12:09.840
Now do keep in mind that what you'll have there is just the publicly available stuff

12:09.840 --> 12:15.040
in Google's open source code dumps of Fuchsia, just like how the Android open source project

12:15.040 --> 12:20.600
AOSP doesn't contain a whole bunch of the enhancement you've come to expect on your

12:20.600 --> 12:22.920
Google Pixel phone.

12:22.920 --> 12:27.560
This Fuchsia experience is likewise quite bare, but it's interesting to try and it really

12:27.560 --> 12:29.200
is easy to get going.

12:29.200 --> 12:33.400
You just hop on over to the GitHub page, which we'll have linked in the show notes, download

12:33.400 --> 12:38.080
a big old zip file of the emulator and the emulators base image, and then run a couple

12:38.080 --> 12:42.580
command lines on your Linux install and you'll be playing with Fuchsia in no time.

12:42.580 --> 12:47.820
Unless you're spending all your time playing on your new portable switch like Steam gaming

12:47.820 --> 12:49.240
PC running Linux.

12:49.240 --> 12:52.180
Well, at least that's the rumor that just won't quit.

12:52.180 --> 12:57.540
And Sam Makovic over at Ars Technica says that Valve has been secretly building a switch

12:57.540 --> 13:03.280
like portable PC designed to run a large number of the games you see on Steam.

13:03.280 --> 13:08.960
And yes, it would be running Linux and supply chain willing could actually ship by the end

13:08.960 --> 13:09.960
of the year.

13:09.960 --> 13:10.960
How do we know this?

13:10.960 --> 13:18.160
Well, on Tuesday, Steam DB operator Pavel Jundic spotted the change in Steam's code,

13:18.160 --> 13:22.280
which pointed to a new device named Steam Pal.

13:22.280 --> 13:28.000
This mysterious device is very likely the subject of an announcement Valve co-founder

13:28.000 --> 13:47.840
Gabe Newell hinted at in a recent panel discussion earlier this month.

13:47.840 --> 13:50.560
That was leaked audio from the event.

13:50.560 --> 13:54.560
And unlike the Nintendo Switch, the Steam Pal will likely have a system on a chip that's

13:54.560 --> 13:58.800
something from Intel or AMD and not an ARM system.

13:58.800 --> 14:00.840
That's going to be interesting to see how that works.

14:00.840 --> 14:04.320
And it's unclear if Valve is going to have like multiple skews of this where you can

14:04.320 --> 14:08.640
have like different performance levels and battery life levels and, you know, other things

14:08.640 --> 14:10.000
in that regard.

14:10.000 --> 14:16.200
And really, to be frank, I don't really have a lot of hopes.

14:16.200 --> 14:19.900
You know, I felt like I got a little burned on the Steam machines thing.

14:19.900 --> 14:24.560
But when you hear Gabe talk about it, and he's hinting pretty strong like this is going

14:24.560 --> 14:30.760
to happen, it seems like it might be more locked in than things typically are with the

14:30.760 --> 14:36.360
disclosure that Valve is a very unique company with a very unique company structure and a

14:36.360 --> 14:39.720
very unique company timeframe known as Valve time.

14:39.720 --> 14:40.780
Yeah, that's right.

14:40.780 --> 14:46.480
We should be clear that the Steam Pal is still very much in the prototype stage and its features

14:46.480 --> 14:52.120
are subject to change as we've seen with other prototype hardware like Steam VR and the Steam

14:52.120 --> 14:53.760
Controller.

14:53.760 --> 15:00.520
But it does seem like the Steam Pal is being built with Linux in mind, which makes a lot

15:00.520 --> 15:05.440
of sense when you look at the investment Valve has made in Linux and gaming and compatibility

15:05.440 --> 15:06.440
and Proton.

15:06.440 --> 15:10.200
They really put a lot of dollars and time into this.

15:10.200 --> 15:14.220
And you could kind of see how passing on a per device cost for something like a Windows

15:14.220 --> 15:19.720
license wouldn't really play in a price sensitive mobile gaming market.

15:19.720 --> 15:23.520
I would like to thank two of our sponsors for making this episode possible.

15:23.520 --> 15:28.360
And we start with Linode at Linode.com slash LAN, go there to get a $100 60 day credit

15:28.360 --> 15:29.560
towards a new account.

15:29.560 --> 15:32.880
And of course, you support the show Yeah, $100.

15:32.880 --> 15:37.080
And no matter what skill level you're at noob or total expert, you're going to be happy

15:37.080 --> 15:38.080
with Linode.

15:38.080 --> 15:41.200
They are the largest independent cloud right there.

15:41.200 --> 15:42.200
That's worth it.

15:42.200 --> 15:44.080
11 data centers around the world right there.

15:44.080 --> 15:45.080
I love it.

15:45.080 --> 15:48.960
Super fast networking between the data centers and to the internet in general.

15:48.960 --> 15:50.400
Really quick SSDs.

15:50.400 --> 15:52.280
They're dedicated CPU rigs are crazy fast.

15:52.280 --> 15:57.120
They have dedicated GPU rigs and the value is there 30 to 50% cheaper than quote unquote

15:57.120 --> 16:00.480
big cloud and Linode started in 2003.

16:00.480 --> 16:05.280
They've been doing this for like ever in internet terms like when Linux was still figuring out

16:05.280 --> 16:07.480
how to do virtualization Linode was there.

16:07.480 --> 16:08.680
They're like, all right, let's go.

16:08.680 --> 16:09.680
Let's figure this out.

16:09.680 --> 16:10.680
Let's build something.

16:10.680 --> 16:14.040
And they've stuck with it and they've refined it over the years and they've made it fantastic.

16:14.040 --> 16:17.440
Now here I come along like a couple of years ago I discovered Linode I'm like, let's give

16:17.440 --> 16:18.440
it a go.

16:18.440 --> 16:19.440
I've heard about Linode forever.

16:19.440 --> 16:23.600
I've seen them at tech events, you know, specifically the free software open source community events.

16:23.600 --> 16:26.760
Obviously, I've seen them sponsor some of the projects that I use and love.

16:26.760 --> 16:30.200
So I knew about Linode, but I hadn't tried them before.

16:30.200 --> 16:34.120
I tried them didn't have $100 credit like you get when you go to Linode.com slash LAN

16:34.120 --> 16:35.840
and I was blown away.

16:35.840 --> 16:40.560
It was like, you know, when you live in the uncanny valley of hosted services where it's

16:40.560 --> 16:41.560
like it's really good.

16:41.560 --> 16:43.320
It's like 90% of the way there.

16:43.320 --> 16:46.880
But every now and then I got to do something that is just sort of outside the box.

16:46.880 --> 16:52.080
And that's where they kind of landed that uncanny valley Linode it closes the gap.

16:52.080 --> 16:53.080
It really does.

16:53.080 --> 16:58.220
It is everything I need and then they back it up with amazing 24 seven customer support

16:58.220 --> 16:59.840
by phone or by ticket.

16:59.840 --> 17:03.580
And they're easy to use powerful cloud dashboard makes it totally simple to take advantage

17:03.580 --> 17:08.280
of other services like their S3 compatible object storage, which Jupiter broadcasting

17:08.280 --> 17:13.540
just uses the absolute snot out of they have cloud firewalls and they have simple one click

17:13.540 --> 17:15.400
application deployments.

17:15.400 --> 17:20.300
If a project you work with or a company or maybe it's a social event or religious event

17:20.300 --> 17:23.640
and you want to get into live streaming, but you don't really want to participate in the

17:23.640 --> 17:29.380
YouTube slog or the Twitch swamp, you ought to check out their one click deployment of

17:29.380 --> 17:34.240
own cast, which is Twitch in a box and you can just go through their super easy to use

17:34.240 --> 17:35.560
setup wizard.

17:35.560 --> 17:39.160
They'll deploy the Linux stack and they'll deploy own cast and then it's all set up to

17:39.160 --> 17:40.320
update from the repos.

17:40.320 --> 17:41.320
It works really great.

17:41.320 --> 17:42.880
And you got Twitch in a box.

17:42.880 --> 17:44.780
You can also roll a machine and do peer tube.

17:44.780 --> 17:45.780
That's the way I go.

17:45.780 --> 17:49.720
But you got to appreciate projects like own cast to that make it so much more approachable

17:49.720 --> 17:52.080
for people that are a little bit more casual about this kind of thing.

17:52.080 --> 17:54.440
So you really got to go check it out for yourself.

17:54.440 --> 17:56.160
And that credit that hundred dollar credit.

17:56.160 --> 17:57.160
That's something I didn't have.

17:57.160 --> 18:00.840
I, you know, I was on the fence and if I would have a hundred dollars, I think I would have

18:00.840 --> 18:02.360
started using Linode a lot sooner.

18:02.360 --> 18:04.760
So go to Linode dot com slash land.

18:04.760 --> 18:09.060
Get that a one hundred dollar 60 day credit on your new account and support the show and

18:09.060 --> 18:14.320
make it possible for this here humble podcast to be free for everyone to listen to Linode

18:14.320 --> 18:17.340
dot com slash land.

18:17.340 --> 18:21.380
Also a big thank you to my mobile provider, my mobile provider for years.

18:21.380 --> 18:28.360
Go to Linux dot ting dot com and get 25 bucks off amazing wireless rates.

18:28.360 --> 18:32.280
If you're sick of paying for cell service and I can't imagine that you're not, you really

18:32.280 --> 18:36.600
should go see how much you can save and then take 25 bucks off that at Linux dot ting dot

18:36.600 --> 18:37.600
com.

18:37.600 --> 18:39.040
You know, I really like Ting's new simple plans.

18:39.040 --> 18:42.980
I've been around for a while, so I've seen them try a couple of different takes at this.

18:42.980 --> 18:46.640
And with this new generation of ting plans, they've they've just nailed it.

18:46.640 --> 18:49.380
I'm going to tell you about their set 12 plans, but I encourage you to go to Linux dot ting

18:49.380 --> 18:50.560
dot com and check them all out.

18:50.560 --> 18:54.640
And what I like about the set 12 plan is it gives you 12 gigs of data.

18:54.640 --> 18:55.640
All right.

18:55.640 --> 18:59.640
Now, if you if you sync your podcast and your your music before you get on the road, 12

18:59.640 --> 19:02.020
gigs of data is is a ton to work with.

19:02.020 --> 19:07.240
But here's what I love because it's 35 bucks a month and you get unlimited calls and texts,

19:07.240 --> 19:08.240
right?

19:08.240 --> 19:11.480
So 12 gigs of data and unlimited calls and texts.

19:11.480 --> 19:13.440
And then you can add data, of course, and they have other plans.

19:13.440 --> 19:16.320
I mean, you can you can just go to town with the data if you want.

19:16.320 --> 19:17.700
They got plans for that, too.

19:17.700 --> 19:19.160
So there's a perfect fit for you.

19:19.160 --> 19:22.820
But I think that set 12 is really clever if you're just smart about how you use your data

19:22.820 --> 19:23.860
a little bit.

19:23.860 --> 19:29.200
You could really save $35 a month for a phone bill is just well, I mean, when's the last

19:29.200 --> 19:30.200
time you've seen that?

19:30.200 --> 19:32.640
I don't even want to tell you what some of my family members are paying.

19:32.640 --> 19:34.920
I tried to tell them and try to tell them that's why I move as many of them.

19:34.920 --> 19:36.480
I can't move them over.

19:36.480 --> 19:40.380
I mean, the Ting dashboard that switches them to when I show them that like, oh, that's

19:40.380 --> 19:41.380
way better.

19:41.380 --> 19:44.580
But, you know, you look at these prices now and these new these new plans they have.

19:44.580 --> 19:45.580
It's really appealing.

19:45.580 --> 19:48.840
It's simple to switch to Ting and pretty much any phone's going to work on Ting because

19:48.840 --> 19:50.480
they have several networks they support.

19:50.480 --> 19:55.000
So go to Linux.ting.com, check your current phone, then go create an account and pick

19:55.000 --> 19:56.320
the plan that's right for you.

19:56.320 --> 19:59.760
You can either get a new device or, you know, bring your own and save some money.

19:59.760 --> 20:02.160
And then Ting's going to send you a SIM card if you keep your phone, they're just going

20:02.160 --> 20:03.160
to send you a SIM card.

20:03.160 --> 20:04.160
You pop that in.

20:04.160 --> 20:06.720
And then like a couple more minutes after that, you go through their website and you're

20:06.720 --> 20:07.720
done.

20:07.720 --> 20:11.060
You're like emancipated from your horrible monopolistic carrier.

20:11.060 --> 20:14.560
And you're now on Ting picking and choosing your network with your unlimited calls and

20:14.560 --> 20:16.880
your unlimited decks and the data plan that fits your needs.

20:16.880 --> 20:18.800
I mean, it's just it's just so simple.

20:18.800 --> 20:22.400
And it just gets even easier when you take 25 bucks off the top.

20:22.400 --> 20:25.860
So go to Linux.ting.com, support the show and save some money.

20:25.860 --> 20:27.600
The next generation of Ting Mobile is here.

20:27.600 --> 20:33.740
So go see how much you could save and get 25 bucks off at Linux.ting.com.

20:33.740 --> 20:41.540
The new owners of Audacity continue to make news, and it's not the good kind.

20:41.540 --> 20:47.280
This week, they announced a contributor license agreement will be added to the project, also

20:47.280 --> 20:51.160
known as a CLA for short.

20:51.160 --> 20:56.600
Future contributors to Audacity will be expected to sign this new agreement in order to add

20:56.600 --> 20:58.840
any code to the project.

20:58.840 --> 21:04.400
A GitHub discussion post titled information about our new contributor license agreement

21:04.400 --> 21:10.840
explained that the purpose of the CLA is to provide future flexibility in altering by

21:10.840 --> 21:17.400
e up licensing or dual licensing for the entire Audacity project, not just the parts of the

21:17.400 --> 21:20.720
code that we have written ourselves.

21:20.720 --> 21:23.680
I mean, obviously, the concept of a CLA isn't new to open source.

21:23.680 --> 21:25.040
That's not the issue here.

21:25.040 --> 21:29.040
I think it's that simply put the it's new to Audacity.

21:29.040 --> 21:30.220
That's really the issue.

21:30.220 --> 21:35.360
And it's a huge change right after the whole telemetry debacle and just shocks to the system

21:35.360 --> 21:37.360
in general about the announcement.

21:37.360 --> 21:41.320
So that sort of while everybody's still reeling from that, unlike the quote unquote, fake

21:41.320 --> 21:47.240
news telemetry announcement, the CLA has had some but not nearly as severe of a reaction.

21:47.240 --> 21:52.380
And it seems like the messaging has been left to Audacity's new boss, Martin Curie to just

21:52.380 --> 21:58.120
gather feedback, quote unquote, but really his contributions to the conversation have

21:58.120 --> 22:04.800
pretty much just been the CLA was always going to be an issue many contributors would find

22:04.800 --> 22:05.800
unpopular.

22:05.800 --> 22:08.320
Yeah, and that's just kind of his take on it.

22:08.320 --> 22:10.040
Yeah, yeah, we knew this one's gonna be a problem.

22:10.040 --> 22:13.960
But look, we got plans, you know, we got things we want to do.

22:13.960 --> 22:17.520
This is the quintessential free audio editor, you know, it's currently licensed under the

22:17.520 --> 22:18.520
GPL two.

22:18.520 --> 22:22.120
And it seems there is an update in the works to take this thing to GPL three.

22:22.120 --> 22:26.440
And I think that transition has brought up this conversation.

22:26.440 --> 22:31.320
And in defense of them implementing a CLA, they cited platforms such as Apple's App Store

22:31.320 --> 22:36.280
that require software to be dual licensed, that you can't just ship a GPL two or three

22:36.280 --> 22:39.960
app on the App Store because they're going to go make millions on the App Store.

22:39.960 --> 22:41.800
It requires all of this effort.

22:41.800 --> 22:47.560
However, you can find plenty of examples of GPL software on the App Store.

22:47.560 --> 22:51.480
Nextcloud being one of the larger ones, Telegram is GPL as well.

22:51.480 --> 22:54.720
Some of them have come up with clever dual licensing scheme, some of them have come up

22:54.720 --> 22:58.200
with copying comments that make things clear.

22:58.200 --> 23:03.680
I just I feel like you can find hundreds even, I'll link to a list of hundreds of open source

23:03.680 --> 23:08.600
of various open source licenses that we know that are in the App Store today and don't

23:08.600 --> 23:09.600
have CLA's.

23:09.600 --> 23:10.600
Some of them do.

23:10.600 --> 23:14.100
But there's clearly been proof in the public that it's possible.

23:14.100 --> 23:16.840
With the challenge being here, of course, that Audacity is such an old project, lots

23:16.840 --> 23:18.980
of contributors, etc, etc.

23:18.980 --> 23:21.800
But you know, humanity is good at solving hard problems.

23:21.800 --> 23:24.120
Yeah, there's a lot of things going on here.

23:24.120 --> 23:29.300
And I think there are some, let's say, adversarial readings of the initial post sort of explaining

23:29.300 --> 23:31.380
the motivation for the CLA.

23:31.380 --> 23:36.720
And yes, a CLA is not required to get a version of Audacity into the App Store.

23:36.720 --> 23:39.600
But I think some kind of relicensing is.

23:39.600 --> 23:45.240
Right now it's GPL v2 plus, which means it could be interpreted as GPL v3 as well.

23:45.240 --> 23:49.160
And you're right, Chris, there are definitely some GPL projects up on the App Store.

23:49.160 --> 23:52.720
But all the licenses of those, well, it's not really clear.

23:52.720 --> 23:57.800
Telegram claims it's all GPL v2 for the client, but there's actually no license file in their

23:57.800 --> 23:59.580
GitHub repository for it.

23:59.580 --> 24:04.040
And there are some open issues questioning just what is the license here.

24:04.040 --> 24:08.480
And as you mentioned, Nextcloud, well, they had to update things and actually add a specific

24:08.480 --> 24:13.080
exception to the license, which I think technically changes the license from being GPL to being

24:13.080 --> 24:15.360
GPL plus exception.

24:15.360 --> 24:19.440
To do that in Audacity's case would require kind of the same effort that they're doing

24:19.440 --> 24:24.800
with the CLA, namely going back, finding all the contributors who've got big major chunks

24:24.800 --> 24:28.840
of code in the code base and getting them to sign off and agree that yes, okay, we're

24:28.840 --> 24:32.680
okay with changing the license for the code we contributed and adding this exception.

24:32.680 --> 24:36.560
So I think there's one version that you can understand from the project's perspective

24:36.560 --> 24:41.120
or from a business perspective of you're taking the time right now to go through and contact

24:41.120 --> 24:44.840
and find all these contributors, get them to approve this change.

24:44.840 --> 24:48.600
In some ways, if you think you ever might need to do something like that again, it kind

24:48.600 --> 24:52.160
of makes sense to get this done with the CLA so that you have that option and don't have

24:52.160 --> 24:53.960
to repeat this in the future.

24:53.960 --> 24:58.160
Again, I don't think it's necessary, but you can see how if you're already making that

24:58.160 --> 25:02.320
effort from the business perspective, it makes sense to get things more in your control.

25:02.320 --> 25:03.320
Right.

25:03.320 --> 25:05.840
And they've gone through a similar process with their MuseScore application.

25:05.840 --> 25:09.960
In fact, they even talk about maybe potentially, they could, you know, the applications could

25:09.960 --> 25:15.000
share code at some point, this could mean that Audacity could have VST three support.

25:15.000 --> 25:19.320
And so when you lay it all out there and you make a pretty good case, I say I'm all for

25:19.320 --> 25:23.640
the CLA actually, but what I'm also all for is a community fork of this thing.

25:23.640 --> 25:25.320
I'd like both things to exist.

25:25.320 --> 25:31.500
I would like a free, totally unencumbered version of Audacity that has no telemetry.

25:31.500 --> 25:33.120
It has no CLA.

25:33.120 --> 25:38.400
It is a true specimen of free software because at the end of the day, that's why Audacity

25:38.400 --> 25:39.520
mattered more than anything else.

25:39.520 --> 25:44.360
I mean, it is a tool that we use and it's an important tool, but it was also what it

25:44.360 --> 25:45.360
represented.

25:45.360 --> 25:48.980
It was a free software audio editor, the quintessential one.

25:48.980 --> 25:53.000
And I feel like that on its own is important and should exist.

25:53.000 --> 25:55.360
And so I would like to see a fork happen.

25:55.360 --> 25:58.600
And then I would like to see Audacity proper, whatever you want to call it.

25:58.600 --> 26:05.400
Go on, add your telemetry, add your CLA, add your VST support, share UI code and whatever

26:05.400 --> 26:06.400
between Muse and this.

26:06.400 --> 26:07.400
I don't care.

26:07.400 --> 26:08.400
Let's see where it goes.

26:08.400 --> 26:09.400
Have at it.

26:09.400 --> 26:11.360
You know, you've done your purchase.

26:11.360 --> 26:12.360
You now own it.

26:12.360 --> 26:13.580
You can control it.

26:13.580 --> 26:14.580
Do what you like with it.

26:14.580 --> 26:18.440
But I'd also like the fork to exist and see where both of them go.

26:18.440 --> 26:20.360
And that's the beauty of open source.

26:20.360 --> 26:21.360
You're right.

26:21.360 --> 26:26.440
I mean, relicensing aside, as long as this thing is out in the open, no one can really

26:26.440 --> 26:28.060
take it away from us.

26:28.060 --> 26:32.000
And the flip side of that is reading through the discussions on this commentary on the

26:32.000 --> 26:33.920
discussion post on GitHub.

26:33.920 --> 26:34.920
It really is quite interesting.

26:34.920 --> 26:37.120
There's a lot of names you might recognize in there.

26:37.120 --> 26:42.480
If you're at all curious about this, folks like Hector Martin or Falk TX, the notable

26:42.480 --> 26:45.600
Jack and Carla and Katia developer.

26:45.600 --> 26:48.840
And one of his comments really stood out to me because he sort of mentioned he thought

26:48.840 --> 26:54.760
about contributing to Audacity before, and I don't think he loves there being a CLA.

26:54.760 --> 26:58.360
But he listed some of the reasons that, you know, it was hard to contribute to Audacity

26:58.360 --> 27:01.200
problems, even just getting it to build on Linux.

27:01.200 --> 27:04.400
And when you go look at some of the commits in just the recent past couple of days, the

27:04.400 --> 27:10.260
past few weeks, those are things that this new team is clearly putting effort into.

27:10.260 --> 27:14.960
It's hard to say I am of two minds because the GPL, especially in CLA's, it's a little

27:14.960 --> 27:16.720
bit of a weird mix.

27:16.720 --> 27:22.260
But if this actually means a lot of new core development for Audacity, it might just work

27:22.260 --> 27:23.820
out for the best.

27:23.820 --> 27:28.240
And I totally appreciate that the situation was easier for Nextcloud to deal with because

27:28.240 --> 27:31.800
they were a newer, younger project that, you know, they could get access to the developers

27:31.800 --> 27:32.800
that were active.

27:32.800 --> 27:36.200
And Audacity has a much longer legacy than that.

27:36.200 --> 27:40.040
But I can't help feel like there's a bit of a shared theme between our first story and

27:40.040 --> 27:41.040
our last story.

27:41.040 --> 27:45.800
You know, Freenode also involves a takeover that kind of comes in strong.

27:45.800 --> 27:49.560
Maybe they don't fully appreciate and understand the community and interact with the community

27:49.560 --> 27:51.820
in a way that really is successful.

27:51.820 --> 27:55.080
And there's a bit of a shock to the whole thing, too, which I feel like happened in

27:55.080 --> 27:56.760
the Audacity case.

27:56.760 --> 27:59.440
These parallels are playing out at the same time.

27:59.440 --> 28:04.080
And I feel like it tells us a bigger meta story about corporate governance and free

28:04.080 --> 28:06.040
software project takeovers.

28:06.040 --> 28:09.720
And it seems like the lessons still haven't been learned.

28:09.720 --> 28:13.680
You and I have some firsthand experiences with mergers and these kinds of mixes, and

28:13.680 --> 28:16.920
sometimes they can go well and sometimes they can go wrong.

28:16.920 --> 28:20.560
And I think we're kind of seeing a couple of them happen at the same time right now

28:20.560 --> 28:22.180
that make me really uncomfortable.

28:22.180 --> 28:26.560
And it makes me feel like if people just were a little bit better about managing community

28:26.560 --> 28:31.300
and interacting a little more open to doing things in a different way with a different

28:31.300 --> 28:34.720
culture than, you know, Bill, this is how the business does it and this is how the lawyers

28:34.720 --> 28:35.720
tell us to do it.

28:35.720 --> 28:37.000
So we're always going to do it this way.

28:37.000 --> 28:40.120
And maybe being a little more receptive to how the free software community works, like

28:40.120 --> 28:46.560
just those basics, Wes, just those basics, Wes, would make such a huge difference in

28:46.560 --> 28:47.560
these transitions.

28:47.560 --> 28:50.400
And it's funny we're seeing them play out at the same time, in my opinion.

28:50.400 --> 28:52.440
No, you're absolutely right.

28:52.440 --> 28:54.840
But I think it's kind of a little bit on both sides.

28:54.840 --> 28:59.760
And it highlights the tension between, you know, open source and the community and the

28:59.760 --> 29:04.120
grassroots nature of it and the business side, which often provides a lot of the funding

29:04.120 --> 29:09.580
and of course, leverages open source to no end for their own profits.

29:09.580 --> 29:10.580
And that's where it's hard.

29:10.580 --> 29:13.800
We have a lot of discussions about how we fund open source development, how do we make

29:13.800 --> 29:18.600
sure that the, you know, the free software we use and love and rely on keeps going, but

29:18.600 --> 29:23.360
we seem to then also throw up a lot of barriers when there might be some interest in funding

29:23.360 --> 29:24.360
it.

29:24.360 --> 29:30.060
I don't think we have a solid idea yet of exactly how we want these different, but aligned

29:30.060 --> 29:33.500
communities to really work together in the long run.

29:33.500 --> 29:37.640
It is an age old problem, sustainable development and funding of that software development,

29:37.640 --> 29:43.080
which is inherently expensive, and the freedom and flexibility to be a free software project

29:43.080 --> 29:47.340
that truly is about its users first and not monetization.

29:47.340 --> 29:50.480
And it is such a tricky balance to get right.

29:50.480 --> 29:55.560
And we're watching it play out right now on two really important backbone pieces for the

29:55.560 --> 30:00.220
open source community, Audacity, the audio editor and Freenode, the chat network.

30:00.220 --> 30:04.860
But looking forward, it seems that Tesla is looking at funding some Linux development.

30:04.860 --> 30:11.520
They have an opening right now for Linux game development at Tesla.

30:11.520 --> 30:16.440
The job post that we found reads, some of you might have heard our dear Techno King

30:16.440 --> 30:24.560
is bullish on games and making an awesome platform for all gamers in Tesla vehicles.

30:24.560 --> 30:29.040
The latest Model S on our website can give you a hint of what we're aiming for in terms

30:29.040 --> 30:30.360
of platform compatibility.

30:30.360 --> 30:33.920
Sorry, can't divulge much more for now.

30:33.920 --> 30:38.840
The Tesla infotainment OS and platform software are based on a standard Linux.

30:38.840 --> 30:44.800
So of course, we're interested in helping the gaming community make Linux gaming excellent.

30:44.800 --> 30:47.840
Yeah, they have several open Linux positions.

30:47.840 --> 30:49.620
I knew that.

30:49.620 --> 30:52.240
And we'll link to this one just because gaming is so funny.

30:52.240 --> 30:58.040
And it's so funny when you think of a car company picturing the user playing games in

30:58.040 --> 31:01.740
the car, but it's obviously a way to kill time while you're waiting to charge.

31:01.740 --> 31:02.740
Why not?

31:02.740 --> 31:06.120
I mean, you got like, you know, maybe 20 to 40 minutes you need to charge up your car

31:06.120 --> 31:07.560
at a supercharger or something.

31:07.560 --> 31:10.940
Maybe you're on a road trip, get out, stretch your legs, and then you got a few more minutes

31:10.940 --> 31:11.940
to kill.

31:11.940 --> 31:15.800
So why not do some gaming on your huge RS Tesla screen?

31:15.800 --> 31:16.800
I love it Wes.

31:16.800 --> 31:21.200
It sounds like they're looking for candidates with experience and excitement for building

31:21.200 --> 31:27.780
open source software based on open source stacks, things like Linux, Mesa, Vulkan, OpenGL.

31:27.780 --> 31:32.960
And hey, maybe you even have some experience with Proton, Lutris, or Wine.

31:32.960 --> 31:36.720
They also know that they want folks who are happy and willing to contribute back up to

31:36.720 --> 31:37.720
the community.

31:37.720 --> 31:41.280
I wonder what kind of Tesla authored commits we might be seeing.

31:41.280 --> 31:42.720
I say it's going to be a flop, Wes.

31:42.720 --> 31:47.160
I mean, who needs this when you're going to have your Steam pal with you in the car, right?

31:47.160 --> 31:48.840
This is who needs any of that.

31:48.840 --> 31:53.280
But whichever one of these mobile Linux gaming monsters ships, and of course, all the other

31:53.280 --> 31:56.180
things that happen in the world of Linux and open source, we'll let you know right here

31:56.180 --> 31:57.180

You digital nomads out there, don't miss this week's Linux Unplugged.

32:08.920 --> 32:14.520
My guest tells me how he learned Linux and built a total automation system in his school

32:14.520 --> 32:17.320
bus that he's converted into a home.

32:17.320 --> 32:21.240
It's an incredible journey of learning and it will be in Linux Unplugged episode 408

32:21.240 --> 32:24.840
at linuxunplugged.com slash 408 when it publishes.

32:24.840 --> 32:30.240
As for us, we'll be back next Monday with our weekly take on the latest Linux and open

32:30.240 --> 32:31.560
source news.

32:31.560 --> 32:57.160
Thanks for joining us and we will see you next week.
