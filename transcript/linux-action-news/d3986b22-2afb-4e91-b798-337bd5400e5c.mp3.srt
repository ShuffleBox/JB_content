00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,440
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, episode 214, recorded on November 7th, 2021.

2
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:09,440
I'm Chris.

3
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:10,440
And I'm Wes.

4
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:11,440
Hello, Wes.

5
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:12,440
Let's do the news.

6
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:16,280
And our first story this week is about a significant shift at GitHub.

7
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:19,880
CEO Nat Friedman has announced he plans to step down.

8
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:24,780
GitHub's Chief Product Officer, Thomas Tomka, will take over the role of CEO and report

9
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:26,620
to Julia Luisen.

10
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:29,880
I lead developer division at Microsoft.

11
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:36,440
My team's mission is to build the tools and services that developers love and use every

12
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:37,440
day.

13
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:39,400
Coda radio listeners might recognize Luisen's name.

14
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:42,080
She was the head of the developer division at Microsoft.

15
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:45,980
And she was also directly involved with that last minute decision back in October to remove

16
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:51,320
the hot reload functionality from the open source.net project for the sake of Visual

17
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:52,980
Studio sales.

18
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:56,560
Developers pushed back pretty hard on that attempt and Microsoft eventually reversed

19
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:57,560
course.

20
00:00:57,560 --> 00:01:01,600
Luisen has since been promoted to president of Microsoft developer division, and she will

21
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:02,600
now oversee GitHub.

22
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:04,080
So it's a lot of names.

23
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:09,760
So just to be clear, Tomka, the new CEO of GitHub, will be reporting to Luisen at Microsoft.

24
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:14,540
Luisen has also been identified as a key player in Microsoft's overall open source strategy

25
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:16,840
and their modern approach to developers.

26
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:21,960
No matter how you slice this, this is a big change for a critical tool that the overall

27
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:26,180
community, I mean, Linux users, developers, I mean, a huge community uses.

28
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:30,200
When Microsoft first acquired GitHub, there was a lot of concern in the developer community.

29
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:32,920
We weren't sure how that was going to roll.

30
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:36,480
Having that in the captain's chair just made a lot of us feel better.

31
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:40,480
Yeah, and then Friedman had been active in the Linux community since the 90s and involved

32
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:42,640
with some of our favorite projects.

33
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:47,280
Kind of made sense when he was then made CEO by Microsoft when they bought GitHub for 7.5

34
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,240
billion back in 2018.

35
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:52,920
Whoa, 7.5 billion still seems like a lot.

36
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:53,920
It sure does.

37
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:59,280
As for what he's doing post-GitHub, well, that didn't have a lot to say, but did share,

38
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:04,280
quote, I'm moving on to my next adventure to support, advise, and invest in the founders

39
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:08,360
and developers who are creating the future with technology and tackling some of the biggest

40
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:09,920
opportunities of our day.

41
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:12,920
Yeah, I think he still has about a month on the clock or such.

42
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:14,800
But this is going to be an adjustment period.

43
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:17,760
We don't really know a lot about Thomas Domka.

44
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:21,800
We know that Nat hired him shortly after the Microsoft acquisition, and I'm pretty sure

45
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:26,640
he was central in taking private repos free back in 2019.

46
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,120
A lot of us like that.

47
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:31,580
And Domka himself even admits in interviews that he doesn't really have the public profile

48
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:34,560
that Nat had when he stepped into the CEO role.

49
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:38,080
But he does stress in those same interviews that he does have the background of a developer

50
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:42,640
and open source advocate, and that fits well into the overall line of GitHub CEOs of the

51
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:43,640
past.

52
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:48,620
He did also note that his overall style is a bit different, focusing more on execution

53
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:53,600
rather than necessarily being a visionary.

54
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:57,320
Sometimes it can really pay to find bugs, at least the right bugs for the right groups.

55
00:02:57,320 --> 00:03:01,320
Google announced this week it's upping its payments to security researchers who follow

56
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:05,080
the correct channels and disclose new vulnerabilities in the Linux kernel.

57
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:12,700
Yeah, for the next three months, Google will pay out $31,337 for vulnerabilities that can

58
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:14,760
exploit privilege escalation.

59
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:19,440
Or if you can demonstrate a previously unpatched vulnerability or a new exploit technique that

60
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:20,440
could earn you $50,000.

61
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:21,440
$50,000.

62
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:26,040
I mean, you know, Wes, we follow these kernel stories pretty closely.

63
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:29,600
I think we could find a new monetization strategy for the podcast.

64
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:31,080
We could even live stream it.

65
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:32,640
You find them all squash them.

66
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,920
You better move quickly listening.

67
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:36,240
We're coming for them.

68
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:40,360
Google's effectively tripling their previous reward amounts and promises to honor this

69
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:45,480
for at least the next three months, they hope the $31,000 and $50,000 reward levels will

70
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:50,400
encourage more security researchers to explore the Linux kernel and report their findings.

71
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:54,480
These kind of investments not only have a positive impact on Google's products, think

72
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:59,840
Android and Chrome OS, but there are definitely some clear benefits for the entire Linux ecosystem

73
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,080
as well.

74
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:05,000
Setting up these kind of bounties seems like an excellent way for companies to give back

75
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:09,400
since they are building their empires on top of free software after all, without necessarily

76
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:14,160
having to be or hire a whole bunch of kernel developers directly.

77
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:17,840
Sure would be great to see more companies follow in Google's example.

78
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:22,680
But speaking of solving low level problems, this week, the scuttlebutt was around a new

79
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:26,220
canonical tool to manage firmware updates.

80
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:29,040
This new tool is being built in Flutter.

81
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:34,040
And it sits on top of the well known FWAPD and of course, the wider Linux vendor firmware

82
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,040
service.

83
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:39,240
Not only does this seem to signal a deeper commitment to Flutter on canonicals part,

84
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:44,800
but it's also notable to see them building out desktop tools with a canonical twist again.

85
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:49,600
And it appears this new tool will be distributed as, you guessed it, a snap.

86
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:53,760
Now, it seems work on the firmware updater tool actually began in August.

87
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:57,840
If you're curious for more, there's some information provided in the most recent Ubuntu

88
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:02,520
team update, which we'll have linked in the show notes.

89
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:05,960
Just a quick update on the story we told you about recently, Hector Martin, the founder

90
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:10,680
of Asahi Linux and the lead developer to port Linux to Apple's new SoC, has announced he's

91
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:14,120
managed to get Linux booting on the new M1 Pro.

92
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:18,960
Hector announced he booted to a shell with frame buffer and working USB ports.

93
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:22,040
Next on the list to get working is Wi Fi and that SD card reader.

94
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:25,660
And of course, there's still the whole PCI bring up and storage, but they really are

95
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:27,000
doing the hard work here.

96
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,300
And during Hector's live stream, he spent most of the day finding out that he really

97
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:33,920
only had to add a single line of code to actually get things to boot.

98
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:40,040
And that is this process right there, all day long for a tiny discovery, one thing at

99
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,040
a time.

100
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:47,200
It is early days, but the first results on the new chips seem positive for Linux.

101
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:52,680
Fedora 35 was released this week, and you can find our in-depth review at linuxunblog.com

102
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:58,520
slash 430, as well as our State of the Project chat with lead Matthew Miller.

103
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:03,800
But today, we wanted to pull out one of the more newsworthy aspects of Fedora 35 and

104
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:06,080
expand on it here.

105
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:10,520
Wire Plumber ships as the new session manager for PipeWire, a change you really shouldn't

106
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:14,960
even notice, but might have some huge ramifications long term.

107
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:19,920
It's in Fedora today, but it will likely hit all distributions at one point.

108
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:27,080
So on a new Linux system, applications and devices are represented to PipeWire as nodes.

109
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:29,560
Nodes have in and out points called ports.

110
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:34,280
These ports could be audio channels, video channels, multiple track channels, you get

111
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:35,400
the idea.

112
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:41,360
You can link these ports together to create a media pipeline, or commonly called a graph.

113
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:45,800
Now configuring those nodes, saying the ports and creating links between them all, that's

114
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:48,160
the job of the session manager.

115
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:52,280
Session manager is responsible for orchestrating the media pipeline, if you want to be fancy

116
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:53,720
about it.

117
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:57,560
But something has to tell your applications that yeah, they can go ahead and send media

118
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:58,800
to the speakers over there.

119
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:03,440
And that's where Wire Plumber comes in, a PipeWire client that has the ability to control

120
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:09,200
those nodes and ports and more, as explained by its lead developer, George Kyakiadakis.

121
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:15,320
Now Wire Plumber is a modular session manager implementation for PipeWire.

122
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:20,680
In the core, it provides an API that you can use to write any kind of tool that interacts

123
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:22,200
with PipeWire.

124
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:30,200
And on top of this API, we have built a daemon that is scriptable with Lua scripts.

125
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:34,920
And in these Lua scripts, you can write some logic to tell Wire Plumber what to do with

126
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:36,640
your media pipeline.

127
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:43,280
So you can write your own scripts and provide some logic to orchestrate the media pipeline.

128
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:48,560
So until Wire Plumber came along, PipeWire had been shipping in a fairly static default

129
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:49,560
state.

130
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:54,280
It was flexible, but it got the job done, switching over to a session manager to put

131
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:59,760
the media pipeline all together, it creates a set of base tools, an API that will enable

132
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:05,960
tools that are user friendly for anyone to use, and not just power AV wizards, anyone.

133
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:10,580
But another fascinating thing about Wire Plumber is actually the story of how it came to be.

134
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:14,480
Like so many things in desktop Linux land, it didn't really come to be just to give us

135
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:16,480
something new and shiny on the desktop.

136
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:21,000
A lot of this work is actually the result of development in other areas of Linux outside

137
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
the desktop.

138
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,280
Fedora project lead Matthew Miller shared some insights into that in our State of the

139
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:27,280
Project chat.

140
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:31,040
A lot of these things you're seeing are desktop related technologies, but they're actually

141
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:36,760
hires related to an automotive initiative, which you'll see automotive keywords in a

142
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:38,320
lot of these hires as well.

143
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:42,320
And I don't have a lot of the details on that, but it is connected into things that are,

144
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:48,000
you know, useful on the desktop, but also useful in other contexts as well.

145
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,800
And you know, the more we can find things that tie all of these things together, the

146
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:53,120
more we all benefit.

147
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:57,920
You can imagine routing audio in a car in an infotainment system can be kind of tricky.

148
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:02,360
You've got your input from an external client like a phone, you've got nav guidance, you've

149
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:03,360
got voice prompts.

150
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:07,040
Of course, you want to be able to take phone calls and override audio.

151
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:08,400
Something has to manage all of that.

152
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:13,040
And well, as a result, we get some cool tools on Linux, specifically, Collabra has been

153
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:16,080
working on this since 2019.

154
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:19,020
It's already been adopted by the automotive grade Linux project.

155
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:23,600
So in many ways, what we're now getting in Fedora is production code is just now finally

156
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:27,320
making its way to the desktop.

157
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:33,280
On Friday, November 5, the LXQt team proudly announced the release of LXQt 1.0.

158
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:38,720
The lightweight, cute desktop environment was in development for more than eight years.

159
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:42,480
Notable areas of recent improvement include the file manager, the image viewer, and a

160
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:46,280
whole bunch more throughout the lean and being desktop.

161
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:51,040
We just wanted to pass on a hearty congratulations to the project after so many years of hard

162
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:52,040
work.

163
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:54,960
Linode.com slash LAN.

164
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:59,620
Go there to get $100 in 60 day credit on a new account and go there to show your support

165
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:00,720
for the show.

166
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:04,920
Linode is the Linux geeks cloud with 11 data centers worldwide, and they've been hard at

167
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:10,100
work for 18 years creating the best experience for running applications on Linux.

168
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:13,760
If you'd like to build it yourself or deploy one of the many one click stacks, Linode has

169
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,360
excellent options for you.

170
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:17,240
And the performance is incredible.

171
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:22,040
I would not host all of Jupiter Broadcasting's audience facing services on the node if it

172
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:23,760
wasn't super fast.

173
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:28,400
And recently, Linode has been rolling out screaming fast new MVME based block storage.

174
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:33,360
They have super flexible S3 compatible object storage, and an easy to use dashboard that

175
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,900
just really brings it all together.

176
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:39,840
And after you've been using Linode for a minute, if you're like me, you'll start to really

177
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:41,800
appreciate their API.

178
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:46,480
From the best customer support, super fast rigs and networking, and a Linux culture that

179
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:49,480
runs deep, there's many reasons to choose Linode.

180
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:50,960
So let's put it over the top.

181
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:53,840
Go grab $100 in credit and support the show.

182
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:55,760
Linode.com slash LAN.

183
00:10:55,760 --> 00:11:00,800
Go there, support the show, and get yourself 60 days and $100 of credit for the world's

184
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:03,400
best place to run Linux in the cloud.

185
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:07,480
Linode.com slash LAN.

186
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:08,480
Linux.ting.com.

187
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:12,480
You know, Ting is a mobile virtual network operator, so that means Ting has invested

188
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:15,560
in customer support and getting you a great value.

189
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:20,280
And that means they have nationwide coverage, a great mix of plans and super fast LT and

190
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:23,960
5G on multiple carriers that works best in your area.

191
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:26,840
And Ting's plans are simple and straightforward.

192
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:31,960
I've been a Ting customer since 2013, and that only happens when they get it right.

193
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:34,420
And they just simply are the better way to do mobile.

194
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:38,800
They have plans that start around $10 and top out around $55.

195
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:43,360
And no matter if you need 12 gigs, 10 gigs, 1,000 gigs, they've got the right plan for

196
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:44,360
you.

197
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:48,200
And every plan gets access to Ting's award-winning customer service.

198
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:51,280
And the best thing is no contracts ever.

199
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:55,280
I also have to appreciate, even though it's been a long time, it's still super simple

200
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:56,480
to switch to Ting.

201
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:59,240
Pretty much any phone's going to work because they have so many networks.

202
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:00,240
So just get started.

203
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:03,960
Go to linux.ting.com, check your current phone, create an account, and pick the plan that's

204
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:05,240
right for you.

205
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:08,680
Ting will send you a SIM card, you pop that in your phone, and you're going to get activated

206
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:09,800
in minutes.

207
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:12,160
Cutting your phone bill in half has never been easier.

208
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:15,200
With Ting's brand new plans, it's the next generation of Ting mobile.

209
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,200
It's here.

210
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:20,120
Go see how much you could save, and then take $25 off that.

211
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:24,040
linux.ting.com.

212
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:27,760
We wanted to bust a little FUD today with our last story.

213
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:33,400
As last week came to a close, a Red Hat memo announcing plans to hire fewer senior engineers

214
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:36,880
and some budget freezes leaked online.

215
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:41,760
In an internal email sent on Wednesday by Timothy Kramer, SVP of software engineering

216
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:47,520
to Red Hat managers, he directs hiring requisitions to be made at a lower level of seniority than

217
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:48,520
usual.

218
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:52,560
The email also touches on unfilled and backfilled positions that should be offered at reduced

219
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:54,600
levels going forward.

220
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:58,920
And without some context, it's kind of understandable why people would be concerned about this story.

221
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:04,420
You know, if Red Hat is unable to offer competitive pay or hire senior people, that could limit

222
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:08,920
the company's success and limit its access to talent, or even make it difficult to retain

223
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:11,040
existing skilled employees.

224
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:14,960
But I think when you understand the broader context, this story isn't quite as shocking.

225
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:20,040
First of all, this appears to only pertain to one division inside Red Hat, led by Tim

226
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:21,040
Kramer.

227
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:22,040
Although a large one.

228
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:26,880
Secondly, this is not the first time Red Hat has done something like this in the before

229
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:28,680
IBM times.

230
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:32,120
And I know some of you out there must have experienced this.

231
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:36,500
Sometimes companies just get stuck in a bit of a culture of title creep.

232
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:41,640
Over time, you end up with a few too many senior this is or a few too many heads of

233
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:42,640
that.

234
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:43,640
I've seen it a few times.

235
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:44,640
Probably a lot of you have too.

236
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:49,160
And a lot of companies end up having to deal with this in some way somehow.

237
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:50,840
And it tends to never be easy.

238
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:54,140
And it tends to also not be very clean.

239
00:13:54,140 --> 00:13:57,460
Sometimes departments experience intense growth for a period of time.

240
00:13:57,460 --> 00:14:01,880
And then that has to be realigned with like the longer term role for that department inside

241
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:04,200
the larger organization.

242
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:09,200
A spokesperson for Red Hat confirmed the authenticity of the leaked email and added that Kramer's

243
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:12,480
team had hired almost 1000 new staffers.

244
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:18,320
And Red Hat as a whole hired more than 2200 new associates this year, I guess essentially

245
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:21,160
implying they've done enough for a while.

246
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:26,240
And indeed, it seems for 2022, that hiring figure will be more like 200.

247
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:30,320
You know, these ebbs and flows of companies are hard for those of us on the outside to

248
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:31,840
really understand.

249
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:36,120
And I've just seen some terrible takes on this story from basically anyone who could

250
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:40,080
be bothered to just go get a quote from Red Hat on what the heck is going on here.

251
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:41,840
Context matters in these stories.

252
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:45,200
But also, I don't know if you've noticed this West, but there just seems to be like a voracious

253
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:50,920
appetite in the Linux media for the whole IBM is destroying Red Hat narrative.

254
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:55,480
And there doesn't seem to be much of an appetite at all for covering the hires the Red Hat

255
00:14:55,480 --> 00:15:01,400
made over the summer that will directly result in significant new desktop stuff.

256
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:05,240
We recently highlighted some of them on a recent episode because we felt like they were

257
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:06,240
getting very little coverage.

258
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:10,680
But it just feels like people want to see Red Hat fail or at least people in the media

259
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:14,320
do because in a way they're hoping for it because that's going to just generate a ton

260
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:15,320
of clicks for them.

261
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:16,720
I think you're right.

262
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:21,520
We're almost sitting there waiting to interpret any news as if it's definitely IBM killing

263
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:22,960
Red Hat this time, for sure.

264
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:23,960
Right.

265
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:28,400
Well, but almost also at the same time ignoring the positive news about the hires that they've

266
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:31,920
done for like HDR support recently, just as an example.

267
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:34,720
I find that to be selective and I don't know.

268
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:35,720
I don't like it, West.

269
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:36,720
Yeah.

270
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:38,400
I mean, that's why we wanted to talk about this today.

271
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:43,280
We wanted to try to provide some kind of counterbalance to those knee jerk just reactionary takes

272
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:44,560
out there.

273
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:48,600
Doesn't mean that we won't continue watching IBM and Red Hat closely.

274
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:53,400
Just means you have to take it all in balance, the good, the bad and just the unknown.

275
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:56,880
Something else to consider here, I think, is that this change does maybe open the door

276
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:59,560
to some junior and mid-level developers.

277
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:01,040
That's not necessarily a bad thing.

278
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:02,040
Right.

279
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:05,060
I mean, the more experienced staff, they have plenty of options right now if these changes

280
00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:06,560
don't work out for them.

281
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:07,560
That's true.

282
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:08,560
That's the hires market at the moment.

283
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:10,280
So that's a fair point.

284
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:15,320
And also just the previous hiring rate just doesn't seem sustainable, nearly a thousand

285
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:16,320
in one department.

286
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:17,320
That's a lot.

287
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:21,080
I mean, it's a big department, but that's a lot for any company, even a large company.

288
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:24,880
And while we're on the subject, Red Hat Enterprise 9's beta landed this week.

289
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:28,280
This is the first rel that's really the fruits of sent off stream and really started with

290
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:29,640
Fedora 34.

291
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:35,960
That means WireGuard is in here, C Groups 2 by default, kernel live patching inside

292
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:39,560
Cockpit, a.k.a. web consoles, they call it in rel, a bunch of stuff.

293
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:43,680
It's a big release to be sure, so we'll be keeping an eye on that and a lot more.
