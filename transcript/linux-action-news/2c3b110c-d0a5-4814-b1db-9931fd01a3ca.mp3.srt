00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,160
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, our weekly take on Linux and the open source world.

2
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:20,400
This is episode 87, recorded on January 5th, 2019.

3
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:21,400
I'm Chris.

4
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:22,400
And I'm Joe.

5
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:23,400
Hello, Joe.

6
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:24,400
I'm not laughing at our names.

7
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:29,380
I'm laughing at the fact that it is the year 2019, which seems ridiculous, like it's something

8
00:00:29,380 --> 00:00:30,880
from a sci-fi book.

9
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:34,760
But you know, we start things off with a story this week that I bet we'll be hearing about

10
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:37,440
for maybe the entire year.

11
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:39,760
It's Raspberry Pi joining the RISC-V Foundation.

12
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:44,560
Yeah, this is very exciting, but we don't have that much information at this point.

13
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:48,940
All we know is that Raspberry Pi have joined as a silver member.

14
00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:51,960
And really, all we've got to go on is a tweet.

15
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:56,360
And they say that they're hoping to contribute to maturing the Linux kernel and Debian port

16
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:59,880
for the world's leading free and open instruction set architecture.

17
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:02,280
Now why would they want to do that, Joe?

18
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:07,160
Well, everyone is asking, when are we going to get a RISC-V Raspberry Pi?

19
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:11,000
And they've hinted that the next Raspberry Pi is going to be different.

20
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,060
But I think that this is not a 2019 situation, is it?

21
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:16,480
We're talking longer term.

22
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:22,000
It takes a lot longer than that to actually go through the whole design and manufacturing

23
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
process.

24
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,160
So maybe 2020, if we're lucky.

25
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:26,160
I hope you're wrong, Joe.

26
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:27,160
I hope you're dead wrong, Joe.

27
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:29,720
I hope it is a 2019 project.

28
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:35,240
And if RISC-V has released the specs, they could, in theory, have been working on a board.

29
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:41,600
I think the reason why I hope it's going to be sooner than later is for competitive reasons.

30
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:46,180
It's true that Raspberry Pi is a brand, and they have a whole platform, and it's hard

31
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:47,640
to contend with that.

32
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:53,880
But as time goes on, the wider community is becoming more and more aware of more competitive,

33
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:57,420
maybe even more capable Linux development boards.

34
00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:03,480
And if they don't ship something pretty impressive in 2019, I'm a little worried that they may

35
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:05,160
lose their market leadership.

36
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:09,480
Well, that's why I don't think they're going to ship RISC-V, because I don't think that

37
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:11,000
it's got the performance that they need.

38
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:16,360
They need to ship a board that is more performant than the current Raspberry Pi 3B+.

39
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:20,520
And I don't think that that's going to happen with RISC-V necessarily.

40
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:22,840
Certainly not at the $35 price point.

41
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:28,360
Although they do have that huge buying power now, so maybe they could force that price

42
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:31,600
down a little bit, but I just can't see it happening.

43
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:37,160
I think that we're going to get a more powerful ARM-based Pi, possibly with better networking,

44
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:39,400
possibly with faster USB.

45
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:44,760
To get us through 2019, and then 2020, they drop this new, totally different system.

46
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:46,320
Yeah, which would be amazing.

47
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:49,960
But they've been hinting the next Raspberry Pi is going to be pretty different.

48
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:50,960
That's true.

49
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:53,440
They have hinted that, and I hope that I'm wrong.

50
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:59,600
I hope that they've been working with RISC-V for a long time, and are almost ready to drop

51
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:06,920
it and come spring, we'll get a RISC-V-based Pi, and it'll be super powerful and at $35.

52
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:14,160
But I just can't see how all those pieces fit together, but then I'm not on the inside.

53
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:16,640
Maybe there are ways that they've made that happen.

54
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:19,440
And if they can, that would be so good for RISC-V.

55
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:23,880
It would mean that they would just drive forward the adoption so much, because they could potentially

56
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:27,680
sell hundreds of thousands of these very, very quickly.

57
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:32,640
And think about the benefits upstream to Debian, and overall the benefits to Linux upstream

58
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,220
for RISC-V support.

59
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:38,900
The benefits alone to the Linux ecosystem would be huge.

60
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:43,880
The reason why I really hope it's this next product, and the more you talk about it, the

61
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:48,320
more I think you're probably right, and the more I think I'm being a little ambitious.

62
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:53,520
But the reason why I feel like it'd be really great is it's such perfect timing to contribute

63
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:55,760
those improvements back upstream.

64
00:03:55,760 --> 00:04:00,300
And just to keep the RISC-V momentum going, and Linux support momentum going, if you could

65
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:06,160
have a large user base, like the Raspberry Pi potential purchasers in the Raspberry Pi

66
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:07,640
community, that's a pretty big user base.

67
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:11,400
I would definitely buy one of these RISC-V Raspberry Pis, I mean just think about that

68
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:12,400
for a moment.

69
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:17,760
A RISC-V powered Raspberry Pi, that's a great idea.

70
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:22,480
I would totally buy that product, even if it was $75 I'd buy that product.

71
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:26,520
And if even a few hundred thousand people thought that, it doesn't have to be millions,

72
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:30,360
even a few hundred thousand thought that, that could result in significant upstream

73
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:35,240
improvements to Linux's total support for the RISC-V platform.

74
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:38,240
I hope that happens in 2019, I think that's important.

75
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:42,360
Well it would be great, and if that did happen, and they did put out a Pi that was RISC-V

76
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:48,720
based, it would mean that at first we'd only have their own OS, Braspbian, which is effectively

77
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:52,880
Debian, but then potentially we'd see ports of other, you know, we'd probably get an Arch

78
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:56,720
version for it, and various other distros as well.

79
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:02,880
Oh absolutely, yeah absolutely, of course, I think that's the best part about this.

80
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:07,320
And it really gets me excited for non-Intel platforms for Linux for 2019.

81
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:12,480
So maybe things will go in a good direction, but long term, if I'm patient, we're probably

82
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:14,000
going to get some great results.

83
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,760
Maybe you're right, maybe it won't be 2019, maybe it is 2020, but in the end we'll probably

84
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:19,440
still get the same benefit.

85
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:22,720
Well something that gives me hope that they are taking the whole open source thing a little

86
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:27,600
bit more seriously these days is that they finally managed to get the driver for the

87
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:32,040
touchscreen, the official Raspberry Pi touchscreen, into the mainline kernel for the upcoming

88
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,040
4.21 release.

89
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:40,600
Yeah, this is the 7 inch touchscreen monitor, it's like an 800x480 display, and it's a decent

90
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:47,880
touchscreen really, it's got like 10 finger touch support and all of that, but until 4.21

91
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:52,480
we haven't had mainline support, and that driver enables support for the touchscreen.

92
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:57,480
The patch itself is like 200 lines of code, you will have to be running that 4.21 kernel,

93
00:05:57,480 --> 00:06:00,520
but that's pretty close, it'll be here sooner than we think.

94
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:04,280
Yeah, this is long overdue, but it's good to see it finally happening.

95
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:09,000
Well while we're talking about alternatives to Intel architectures, MIPS is going open

96
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
source.

97
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,840
Yeah, this happened over the holidays, kind of after we'd recorded our holiday specials,

98
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:18,840
so it's not exactly new news at this point, but it is very good news I think, because

99
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:25,440
it means that we've got a competitor to RISC-V, which is presumably only going to drive innovation.

100
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:30,320
Absolutely, and it looks like a company called Wave Computing is pushing this forward, they

101
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:32,160
write on their blog.

102
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:37,520
Under the MIPS open program, participants will have full access to most recent versions

103
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:45,480
of 32-bit and 64-bit MIPS ISAs, free of charge, with no licensing or royalty fees.

104
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:50,640
Additionally, participants in the MIPS program will be licensed under MIPS's hundreds of

105
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:54,040
existing worldwide patents, everybody loves that.

106
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:59,240
The open initiative will help greatly expand the existing MIPS ecosystem, they write, which

107
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:06,160
is comprised of thousands of developers and hundreds of academic institutions worldwide.

108
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:09,800
The MIPS architecture I think does have a pretty large install base, Joe, I mean, you

109
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:14,760
look at a lot of routers that are in everybody's homes and small business routers, a lot of

110
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:19,960
those are MIPS-based, switches, a lot of those are MIPS-based, but I can't help but feel

111
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:23,060
maybe they should have done this a few years ago.

112
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:28,320
This whole thing is really positioned at AI and machine learning about how MIPS has a

113
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:29,320
play in the future.

114
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:36,520
In fact, Wave Computing themselves is an AI machine learning company, and they just early

115
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:43,820
December raised $86 million in a Series E round of investment, which brings the total

116
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:50,840
investment into the company at more than $200 million in VC funding to back this company,

117
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:55,240
which claims to be powering the next generation of AI.

118
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:56,240
That's their pitch.

119
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:58,840
And they're going to do that with MIPS, good luck with that.

120
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:03,360
That's what they say, they say they're going to combine their system with MIPS.

121
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:09,860
They have a very buzz-heavy explanation on their website, they say, by combining the

122
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:16,440
data flow of Wave Computing's architecture with its MIPS-embedded RISC multi-threaded

123
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:22,320
CPU cores and IP, which I don't think stands for Internet Protocol in this case, Wave Computing

124
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:28,560
has been named Frost and Sullivan's 2018 machine learning industry technology innovation leader

125
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:33,880
and recognized by CEO Application Magazine as one of the top 25 artificial intelligence

126
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:34,880
providers.

127
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:40,440
Combined with MIPS, we now have 400 granted and pending patents for hundreds of customers

128
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:41,440
worldwide.

129
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:46,520
In other words, they have some sort of proprietary IP machine learning system that will be powered

130
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:49,720
by RISC multi-threaded CPU cores.

131
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:53,920
That's pretty much all they say, you got to parse a lot to just get down to that.

132
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:58,440
But the question is, will anyone else start using MIPS as a result of this?

133
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:03,320
Because MIPS is legacy at this point, RISC-V is this new shiny thing that's getting all

134
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:05,200
the attention.

135
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:08,040
So does it really matter that they're doing this?

136
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:09,160
Who knows?

137
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:12,420
They'd have to have some sort of massive market demonstration, wouldn't they?

138
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:13,760
Something that really proves it out?

139
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:17,680
Well, we'd like to think about this as open source and freedom and all of that.

140
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:21,800
But the reality is, the kind of companies who are going to take advantage of this don't

141
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:23,640
really care about that aspect.

142
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:25,720
They just care that it's free as in beer.

143
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:31,000
And if they're going to make a router or whatever, then not have to pay anyone for the license

144
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:38,220
to use the instruction set, well, that is potentially going to end up with a lot of

145
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:44,320
lower end routers and stuff like that being made with it, which I suppose is good in a

146
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:49,440
way, but it's not exactly going to drive a ton of innovation, I don't think.

147
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:53,760
But this AI stuff potentially could, I don't know.

148
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:56,560
It sounds like an easy way to get VC funding to me.

149
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:57,560
Just say AI.

150
00:09:57,560 --> 00:10:00,640
It used to be VR and stuff, now it's AI, machine learning.

151
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:01,640
And blockchain.

152
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:02,640
Yeah, blockchain.

153
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,700
Although that's not doing very well, as we know.

154
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:09,000
I think they have a good chunk of money.

155
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Like you commonly like to say about Mozilla, they have a fair chunk of money to spend on

156
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,880
this and they could drive this forward and they could surprise us yet.

157
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:22,160
But I think the people this will be probably the most applicable to will be the ones that

158
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:27,080
have a DeLorean that can go back in time when MIPS was still really relevant and proceed

159
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:28,080
forward.

160
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:33,200
They really should have done this five, three maybe at the minimum years ago.

161
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:37,020
And this feels like a catch up move now, for better or for worse, we'll see.

162
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:41,240
They may still yet pull this one off and they have some money to burn trying to do it.

163
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:44,760
But it appears that they're not the only ones with some money to burn.

164
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:50,920
Yeah, the good old EU are going to put some money into bug bounties for 14 open source

165
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:51,920
projects.

166
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:52,920
Yeah, how about that?

167
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:56,760
The European Commission in January will be funding 14 bug bounty programs in hopes of

168
00:10:56,760 --> 00:11:00,320
sniffing out vulnerabilities in different open source projects.

169
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:06,240
It starts with a few favorites having varying levels of rewards and end dates and different

170
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:13,600
platforms FileZilla, Apache, Notepad++, PuTTY, VLC Media Player.

171
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:17,280
They're all starting this week, January 7.

172
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:22,200
Now this whole initiative stems back to the free and open software audit project that

173
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:29,040
first kicked off after the Heartbleed vulnerability was discovered in OpenSSL back in 2014, which

174
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,920
doesn't feel like it was that long ago, really.

175
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:31,920
It doesn't.

176
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:36,200
It feels like a couple of years ago, but no, I think we're getting old, man.

177
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:39,960
I think that might be true.

178
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:46,300
PuTTY and Drupal, they have the two largest bug bounties, 102,000 and 101,000 respectively.

179
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:48,500
And the timeframes of the bug bounties also vary.

180
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:52,880
PuTTY's bug bounty program will remain active until December 15, while Drupal's will go

181
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:55,480
until October 15 of 2020.

182
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:58,060
So that's considerably longer.

183
00:11:58,060 --> 00:12:02,240
But I'm not convinced this is money well spent in the least.

184
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:05,160
In fact, I'm worried this could cause developer burnout.

185
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:10,360
But because all these bugs will get raised, and then they won't necessarily get fixed.

186
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:12,600
It'll just be more workload on the devs.

187
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:13,600
Exactly.

188
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,680
This seems like it could have massive reception.

189
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:20,400
When you have a government running a bug bounty program, people are going to notice that.

190
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:22,720
And you're going to have a lot of people going after that.

191
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:25,760
And let's say they find lots of great juicy bugs.

192
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:26,940
Okay, yay.

193
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:31,800
But none of this money goes to pay a single developer to fix those bugs.

194
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:36,720
You'll just get bug trackers packed full of really critical bugs, with no one working

195
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:38,360
on them.

196
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:44,440
And it seems like this money would be much better well spent hiring a few developers

197
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:47,320
to fix this stuff in these open source projects.

198
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:52,400
Like sure, do the bug bounty thing, but set a few hundred thousand aside to hire actual

199
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:53,400
developers too.

200
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:58,260
Yeah, this is a shame really, it feels a little bit sort of knee jerk and not like they've

201
00:12:58,260 --> 00:13:03,080
thought it through properly, that it's not enough to just find the bugs.

202
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:09,280
They should really have set up a proper system where you only get paid if you fix the bugs.

203
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:14,940
Or as you say, maybe two systems, set aside some more money for people who can then actually

204
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:19,720
fix them and maybe have it be twice as much as it is to find it or whatever.

205
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:24,200
Because this ultimately, I mean, there will be some benefit from it, but it's ultimately

206
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:26,760
not going to be as much benefit as we could have.

207
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:28,840
Yeah, I'm definitely conflicted about this.

208
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:31,180
I see the value in bug bounty programs.

209
00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:35,200
But in this particular case, it needs to be a more comprehensive program.

210
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:39,360
I feel like if nothing changes, and this is the only way government figures out how to

211
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:44,720
spend money on open source, then it's a failure and it's doomed to fizzle out and not produce

212
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,080
anything.

213
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:51,200
But if they can figure out how to make a comprehensive approach, where maybe some of this money is

214
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:56,220
going towards development activity to fix these problems, then that starts to secure

215
00:13:56,220 --> 00:13:59,680
government systems, that starts to secure public systems.

216
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:03,080
That's money well spent from the administrative level.

217
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:06,360
Then all of a sudden, it's something I would be really impressed by and say we should adopt

218
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:07,900
here in the US.

219
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:11,440
Maybe this is early days, and it will develop into something like that.

220
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:15,400
Maybe they will receive some of this feedback and make changes.

221
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:16,400
Or maybe not.

222
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:19,400
We just have to wait and see as so often with these kinds of stories.

223
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:24,840
But it's a good first start finding these bugs and reporting them at least gives users

224
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:26,920
information to make decisions.

225
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:29,040
And it lets developers know what needs to be addressed.

226
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:32,200
Whether they can address it or not, it's good to at least identify those problems.

227
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:36,320
So from that perspective, I'm at least glad something like this is going on.

228
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:38,360
And these are pretty good projects to start with.

229
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:43,800
Yeah, I mean, the dream is that governments will spend money writing free software in

230
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:46,120
the first place.

231
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:47,460
But I think that's a long way off.

232
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:51,520
This is, as you say, a first step, maybe towards that one day.

233
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:56,240
Well, for the story that made me the most uncomfortable this week, it appears that Mozilla

234
00:14:56,240 --> 00:15:02,640
spent the holiday season, quote unquote, experimenting with more ads in Firefox.

235
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:07,920
Yeah, this is one of the snippets on the new tab page, which you can disable but is enabled

236
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:09,240
by default.

237
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:14,240
And Mozilla claim that it's not an advert, because it's effectively an affiliate link.

238
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:15,560
But there's a bit of a blurred line there.

239
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:18,400
It's kind of splitting as to say it's not an advert.

240
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:22,720
And it's a bit disappointing, but then again, Mozilla needs to make money.

241
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:27,240
The huge stash of cash that they've got at the moment isn't going to last forever.

242
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:29,600
And Google will eventually pull the plug on them.

243
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:32,960
So they need to do some experiments with bringing in new revenue.

244
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:37,480
And we saw them do that with the VPN thing before, which was effectively an affiliate

245
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:39,000
link.

246
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:45,680
And this time, it's a hotel booking and getting a free Amazon gift card, which it's not too

247
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:46,680
offensive.

248
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:52,200
It's not like gambling sites and, you know, porn and stuff like that.

249
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:54,280
There is a bit of an offensive element to it.

250
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:55,280
I kind of disagree.

251
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:56,280
All right.

252
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:59,640
So just I want to make sure everybody's clear what we're talking about here.

253
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:05,800
Just recently, about 25% of the United States audience who was using the latest version

254
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:07,180
of Firefox.

255
00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:11,960
It's a decent chunk of people, but it's not all of the Firefox users in the United States.

256
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:17,280
What they were seeing is a booking.com snippet that ran for five days and ended on December

257
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:18,280
30th.

258
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:24,720
But what is kind of offensive about it is the manipulative tone that was there.

259
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,640
So picture it, you're on your new tab page.

260
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:31,240
The ad appears at the bottom of Firefox's new tab page on your desktop version with

261
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:36,600
a little message in a gray box and it says, find a hotel.

262
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:41,360
And it's got a button on it that you can click that will take you to a booking.com page.

263
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:45,840
And the button says, are you ready to schedule that next family reunion?

264
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:48,080
Here's a thank you from Firefox.

265
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:54,160
Book your next hotel stay on booking.com today and get a free $20 Amazon gift card.

266
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:56,240
Happy holidays from Firefox.

267
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:58,000
Some restrictions apply.

268
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:04,080
And there was also a second version of that message that read, for the holidays, we have

269
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:07,080
a little something just for using Firefox.

270
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:13,240
Book your next hotel stay on booking.com today and get a free $20 Amazon gift card.

271
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:15,200
Happy holidays from Firefox.

272
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,400
Restrictions apply.

273
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:19,200
And Firefox is positioning this as not an ad.

274
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:25,160
They say the snippet was an experiment to provide more value to Firefox users through

275
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:28,060
offers provided by a partner.

276
00:17:28,060 --> 00:17:30,780
It was not a paid placement or an advertisement.

277
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:35,720
We are continually looking for ways to say thank you for using Firefox.

278
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:40,640
In a similar vein, earlier this month, we offered Firefox users a free opportunity to

279
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:43,840
enjoy a live concert from Phosphorescent.

280
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:48,860
In addition to adding value to Firefox users, these efforts are intended to support an open

281
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:50,460
ecosystem.

282
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:55,280
When users see such offers, no data is being shared with partners until users have made

283
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:58,020
a choice to enter a relationship.

284
00:17:58,020 --> 00:18:00,520
We hope this strategy sets a positive example.

285
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:02,320
It's a little creepy, Joe.

286
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:07,520
It's advertising, but they're telling you it's a gift.

287
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:11,240
They literally say it was not a paid placement or advertisement.

288
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:15,120
We're continually looking for more ways to say thanks for using Firefox.

289
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:16,120
It's a free gift.

290
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:19,920
Well, yeah, it was an affiliate link.

291
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:25,520
And they should have just owned that fact that, yeah, we are experimenting with affiliate

292
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:26,520
links now.

293
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:29,400
They could maybe get an Amazon one going in there.

294
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:32,720
That works out really well, doesn't it, for everyone?

295
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:33,720
Yeah, yeah.

296
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:34,720
What could go wrong there?

297
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:36,760
I mean, I like the idea.

298
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:43,360
The dream is like an artisan group at the Mozilla Corporation making intelligent choices

299
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:48,920
with small batch advertisement deals, organically sourced with no data transferred, protecting

300
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:55,080
everybody in the whole process, and somehow providing a solid revenue stream for Firefox

301
00:18:55,080 --> 00:19:00,360
and lining Firefox users up exactly with what they want, like hotels and live concerts.

302
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:04,380
I mean, the idea, Joe, it's just so gosh darn beautiful I want to cry.

303
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:08,960
And I just love it so much because Firefox, they must continue.

304
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:09,960
But it sounds like horseshit.

305
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:10,960
It sounds like complete horseshit.

306
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:12,320
It never works like that.

307
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:14,100
It's always about trying to make a buck.

308
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:21,240
And it feels like the worst timing possible, with WebKit totally dominating the web.

309
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:29,600
And now Microsoft announcing that they're switching Edge over to Blink, man, it's really

310
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:33,640
just the worst time ever to be messing around with this kind of stuff.

311
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:37,220
And I understand they've got to make money, and I appreciate that struggle.

312
00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:41,360
But whew, not the best time to be the browser known for having ads.

313
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:45,160
Do you think that maybe in a couple of years people will refer to Firefox as, oh, that's

314
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:49,440
that browser with the Casper mattresses adverts and Squarespace and everything?

315
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:51,400
It could be.

316
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:52,400
But they're GIFs.

317
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:53,400
They're not advertisements.

318
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:54,400
Yeah.

319
00:19:54,400 --> 00:20:00,880
Well, one way that Mozilla found to cut costs was to more or less get rid of Thunderbird.

320
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:05,920
And we thought that that was kind of the end for it, and it would kind of fizzle out and

321
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:06,920
die.

322
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:12,200
But then Ryan Sipes, who's co-hosted this show with us a long time ago, or with me at

323
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:15,160
least, he was hired as their community manager.

324
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:19,920
And he seems to be doing good things over there, because it's looking good for Thunderbird

325
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:20,920
in 2019.

326
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:27,760
Yeah, 2019 could shape up to be a year where they see their team grow to 14 members, improvements

327
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:34,400
in the UI, but also some lower level of re-architecting to make things a little more multi-process.

328
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:40,920
And improved support for Gmail, including Gmail label support, which as Ryan writes

329
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:45,520
here in the blog post, reality is Gmail is just one of the largest email providers out

330
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:46,520
there.

331
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:47,520
So we need to support them better.

332
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:53,320
Better UI, re-architecting to support multi-processors a bit better, and improved Gmail support,

333
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:58,040
that's going to make Thunderbird a little more competitive, if nothing else.

334
00:20:58,040 --> 00:21:04,120
I guess that kind of sounds like faint praise when I say it out loud, I suppose.

335
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:08,080
Well and potential improvements around email encryption and stuff, which has got to be

336
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:09,080
good.

337
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:10,440
Yes, that would be really good.

338
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:14,520
How much longer do we have to wait until we have a decent implementation in our email

339
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:15,520
clients for GPG?

340
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:20,160
Like, it's 2019, let's have this solved, please, before 2020 arrives.

341
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:24,560
But it feels a bit of an antiquated idea to have a standalone mail client to me.

342
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:27,560
Surely everyone's using webmail at this point.

343
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:28,560
Maybe I'm wrong.

344
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:30,440
Certainly in enterprise, I suppose I might be wrong.

345
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:33,960
But even then, a lot of companies using G Suite, aren't they?

346
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:38,720
So it just seems like a kind of legacy product at this point.

347
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:39,720
Perhaps.

348
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:43,160
But that's Thunderbird's fault to begin with, really.

349
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:45,520
It's their fault for sitting around for so long.

350
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:50,440
And then, frankly, competitively speaking, getting their ass kicked by web apps.

351
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:51,440
Think about that.

352
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:57,040
A native desktop mail client got its ass kicked by webmail.

353
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:58,040
It's not good.

354
00:21:58,040 --> 00:21:59,360
It's not a pretty picture.

355
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:01,880
Gmail shouldn't be the largest mail client.

356
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:04,000
It shouldn't be the reality of it.

357
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,680
It should be open source Thunderbird.

358
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:08,140
An open source free email client?

359
00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:11,640
If you would have told my folks back in the day that were dialing up to check their Juno

360
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:15,640
email that something free would come along that could do everything Thunderbird could

361
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:16,720
do, they would have switched immediately.

362
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:18,960
It was Thunderbird's game to lose.

363
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:21,320
And they lost it.

364
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:26,000
And so now, we just have to wait and see if in 2019, if they can make these improvements

365
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
and bring it back.

366
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
I hope so.

367
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,920
Because I think it's better in a native mail client.

368
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:33,160
That's something I've just, in the last three months, have switched up to again as I've

369
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:35,320
gone back to using all native mail clients.

370
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:37,160
And it's just, I like it so much better.

371
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:38,800
The performance is better.

372
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:41,480
Offline mail capabilities, obviously nice.

373
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:44,360
Having your calendar with you is great.

374
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:45,360
It's just the way to go.

375
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:48,560
So I hope Thunderbird is able to turn it around because they should be setting the pace, not

376
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:49,560
catching up.

377
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:52,800
Yeah, I was a little bit worried at one point that they were going to go away.

378
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:56,880
Because I set my dad up with Thunderbird, it must be about five, six, maybe even more

379
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:59,540
years ago on Windows.

380
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:02,400
And I've never heard any problems regarding that.

381
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,680
And he's just been using it.

382
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:08,800
And I'd hate to have to try and migrate him to something else with that many emails on

383
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:09,800
Thunderbird.

384
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:10,800
Yep, it's good.

385
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:13,440
Thunderbird is a good email client.

386
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:18,560
And that's why it should have a better market presence and much wider adoption than it has.

387
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:21,520
So I really hope they can fix that because it's a shame.

388
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:25,500
And I think they just didn't make it competitive enough.

389
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:28,260
And those of us that liked a traditional mail client, we were happy.

390
00:23:28,260 --> 00:23:32,800
But people who wanted something new or different or whatever Gmail is offering the other ones,

391
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:34,440
they just didn't offer that.

392
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:35,920
And maybe that can change a bit.

393
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:37,920
Maybe the UI can change.

394
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:43,520
But when it comes to catching up, there's one project that has a whole lot of catching

395
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:44,520
up to do.

396
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:45,520
And that is FreeBSD.

397
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:50,740
The tables have turned, my friends, after years of all of us being told that the only

398
00:23:50,740 --> 00:23:56,160
one and true implementation for the ZFS file system was on FreeBSD.

399
00:23:56,160 --> 00:24:03,360
It turns out that they'll be rebasing their implementation of ZFS on the ZFS for Linux

400
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:04,360
project.

401
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:07,400
Well, yeah, because obviously Linux is way better than FreeBSD.

402
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:09,080
Everyone knows that.

403
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:10,080
Everybody knows that.

404
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:11,080
All right.

405
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:15,680
Well, that's our trolling for the probably for the whole year.

406
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:17,080
This is actually kind of big news.

407
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:21,680
In fact, I'm still trying to parse what this is really going to mean like long term.

408
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:26,180
I've invited somebody who's involved in the ZFS leadership to join us on a future Linux

409
00:24:26,180 --> 00:24:29,800
Unplugged to really break this down and talk about what that's going to mean downstream

410
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:31,080
for distributions.

411
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:33,240
So look for that in a future Linux Unplugged.

412
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:36,080
But right now, here's what we do know.

413
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:42,240
The past few years, the vast majority of new development in ZFS has taken place in Delphix

414
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:45,320
OS or in ZFS on Linux.

415
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:50,560
Delphix OS simply because they're one of the main contributors to ZFS and ZFS on Linux

416
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:55,120
simply because of the massive install base of Linux.

417
00:24:55,120 --> 00:25:01,580
And earlier this year, Delphix announced that they will be moving their work to the ZFS

418
00:25:01,580 --> 00:25:03,600
on Linux code base.

419
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:09,460
What FreeBSD and the Lumos and many other downstream projects that ship ZFS were basing

420
00:25:09,460 --> 00:25:15,160
their implementation of ZFS on is that Delphix stuff and that stuff that made into Lumos,

421
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:17,920
not the ZFS on Linux stuff.

422
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:23,240
The issue is there's some work that's been done in ZFS on Linux and bug fixes that haven't

423
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:30,280
made it upstream to the other projects, things like encryption and issues like bugs that

424
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:35,280
would cause lockups that have been fixed on ZFS for Linux and not upstream.

425
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:38,760
The ZFS for Linux has been getting better and better over time.

426
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:41,300
Yeah, it sounds like it's stagnated.

427
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:45,200
And this is a pragmatic decision that they just had to take.

428
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:51,280
And I would imagine that they've taken it through gritted teeth, but it had to happen.

429
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:55,240
And I suppose the BSD people are generally more pragmatic, aren't they?

430
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:58,940
With the whole permissive licensing and everything.

431
00:25:58,940 --> 00:26:03,960
So it shouldn't be a surprise, but it's still excellent trolling material.

432
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:04,960
It is.

433
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:06,680
It really is.

434
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:10,460
And they have a few things in their favor here.

435
00:26:10,460 --> 00:26:15,120
One thing is that they have consensus at a leadership level that this is the direction

436
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:16,120
to go.

437
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:20,960
The other thing that they have in their favor is IX Systems is willing to put personnel

438
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:23,900
behind quality testing this.

439
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:27,120
In fact, in the original announcement, they talk about some of the testing that IX will

440
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:32,720
be doing about moving test suites over from the free BSD version to the Linux version,

441
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:35,040
merging some of those changes upstream.

442
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:41,640
And as you and I are recording this episode, there is a new ZFS on BSD project, which is

443
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:44,460
based on ZFS for Linux.

444
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:48,680
The way free BSD worked before is they pulled from Illumos down into free BSD, and then

445
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:52,780
they worked on it in their own little fiefdom.

446
00:26:52,780 --> 00:26:58,560
Now they're going to essentially do the same thing, but with ZFS on Linux as their upstream.

447
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:02,800
And the neat thing is that IX is sort of helping with some of this with TrueOS.

448
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:05,600
I talked about it after I went to meet BSD.

449
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:12,840
It's like a BSD system that IX Systems maintains that is essentially free BSD at the core,

450
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:17,160
but can be used to quickly build other kinds of free BSD distros and build stuff on top

451
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:18,160
of it.

452
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:21,440
And that's what they're using for like their free NAS and true NAS appliances.

453
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:26,560
That's what Chris Moore and his team are using to build their Trident desktop.

454
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:31,640
It's sort of like a meta distribution that you can create your own different free BSD

455
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:32,920
based distros from.

456
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:39,200
And with that, they are helping test and quality assure this transition.

457
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:43,840
And it looks like the upstream project ZFS on BSD has already been set up.

458
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:47,680
The code's very much a work in progress, but the folks at IX Systems have begun spinning

459
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:53,080
up daily snapshots of their free BSD TrueOS platform with the new ZFS code that's based

460
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:54,680
on the ZFS for Linux.

461
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:56,800
So it's happening very fast.

462
00:27:56,800 --> 00:28:00,440
This is a perfect example of why they made those changes to TrueOS in the first place

463
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:03,200
so that they could be agile.

464
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:07,760
And immediately after this announcement was made, it's available for testing.

465
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:11,920
So if you are one of those unfortunate people stuck using free BSD, you can get testing

466
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:12,920
this straight away.

467
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:20,840
Yeah, it turns out one of the larger implementations right now of ZFS is actually on RHEL and CentOS.

468
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:24,400
So yeah, I have so, so many questions after this.

469
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:27,660
That's why I'm going to just dedicate some time in Linux Unplugged to like really deep

470
00:28:27,660 --> 00:28:33,280
diving into this and what this means for ButterFS and all of that.

471
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:34,920
This is fascinating for me.

472
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:37,040
But all of that is for future content.

473
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:39,840
For now, that'll bring us to the end of this week's Linux Action News.

474
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:44,400

476
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:52,520
We'll be back next Monday with our weekly take on the latest Linux and open source news.

477
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:54,360
I'm at Chris LAS.

478
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:56,040
I'm at Joe Racington.

479
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:58,680
Thank you for joining us and we will see you next week.

480
