00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,100
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, our weekly take on Linux and the open source world.

2
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:20,380
This is episode 59, recorded on June 24th, 2018.

3
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:21,380
I'm Chris.

4
00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:22,380
And I'm Tom.

5
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:23,380
Hello, Joe.

6
00:00:23,380 --> 00:00:28,440
It's good to be connected again from JB1 Studios in Seattle, Washington, and we kick things

7
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:31,840
off this week with an Ubuntu Touch story.

8
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:33,280
That's an interesting one to lead with.

9
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:37,960
Yeah, Ubuntu Touch OTA4 release candidate has been released.

10
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:41,920
Now yeah, this is just a release candidate, but it's pretty close to what is actually

11
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:45,160
going to be released, hopefully quite soon.

12
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:51,600
And it's a bit of a milestone for them, because it's based on Ubuntu 16.04 rather than 15.04.

13
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:55,480
15.04, of course, is not supported anymore by Canonical.

14
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:58,880
This is supported for a couple of years, so they've bought themselves a bit of runway.

15
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:02,560
Yeah, and the phone release has traditionally been an LTS behind.

16
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:04,140
That's normal for the phone release.

17
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:07,960
But I think the bigger thing too, beyond the years of support that you get with an LTS,

18
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:13,240
is it means today, currently, they'll be receiving core package updates directly from upstream,

19
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:14,720
from the larger Ubuntu community.

20
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:19,120
And I've actually tried this out on a Nexus 5, and I didn't have a huge amount of time

21
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:23,060
to play with it, but it is pretty stable.

22
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:27,280
Much better than the last time I checked out the 16.04 version of it.

23
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:29,720
It feels pretty much finished to me.

24
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:36,080
There are a couple of little bugs in it that they acknowledge, but otherwise, I think if

25
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:42,640
you are all in on the Ubuntu touch experience and don't require certain Android apps like

26
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:45,600
I do, I think you could use this as a daily driver already.

27
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:50,400
Yeah, the project says you should be able to get away with using it as a daily driver,

28
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:56,160
as long as you're, quote, able to endure a little suffering, which I think is a good

29
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:57,320
way to put it.

30
00:01:57,320 --> 00:02:02,260
And the other thing I like about this release is all of the previously supported devices

31
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:04,140
are still supported.

32
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:07,840
And like Joe said, there are a few rough edges and bugs that you have to suffer through.

33
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:10,320
They're enumerated on their post.

34
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:13,880
Just go to linuxactionnews.com slash 59 for a link to that.

35
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:18,480
But sort of at a bigger, higher level, it's just sort of great to see this project still

36
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:19,480
going.

37
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:22,760
They're not going to use it as a daily driver, but it's amazing to see that this community

38
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:27,860
has picked this up and continued this effort, even after Canonical decided it was no longer

39
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:29,040
for them.

40
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:30,680
And it's not dead yet, Joe.

41
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:35,740
It's still kicking, and they've got a good, solid release here that appears existing users

42
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:39,200
of the project can update to over the air right to their device.

43
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:44,280
Yeah, you can't actually do that right now, because the 15.04 version on the Nexus 5 and

44
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:49,240
the RTA didn't actually come through, but that's because it's just release candidate.

45
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:54,720
Once the final release comes out, hopefully very soon, then it will just work as a normal

46
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:59,320
OTA, which is pretty handy for people, rather than having to manually flash it.

47
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:02,080
Although you can flash it without wiping your data at the moment.

48
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:06,360
I just wiped data because I didn't have much on there.

49
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:11,200
But the most important thing here is if you've been following their Q&A, which they do on

50
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:15,080
YouTube, but there's also an RSS feed for the audio version, which is what I catch every

51
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:17,480
couple of weeks.

52
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:23,720
Everything that they're planning to do depends on getting this 16.04 release done first.

53
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:28,040
The Andbox stuff, which is getting Android apps working as an option for people, that

54
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:30,040
requires 16.04.

55
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:34,420
All of their plans in the future depend on getting this release out first.

56
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:41,400
So it is not only is it getting onto an officially supported base of 16.04, it is a base from

57
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:45,800
which they can then build all of their plans and all of their cool stuff that they want

58
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:46,800
to do.

59
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,480
It's just massively important to them.

60
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:53,800
So I would urge people to, if you've got a compatible device, do test it for them.

61
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:57,640
Look at the bugs that they're already aware of, report any new ones.

62
00:03:57,640 --> 00:04:00,820
And if you're a developer and you've got some time that you can spend on it, then I do urge

63
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:07,920
you to contribute to the project because this is potentially one of the only Linux-based

64
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:12,600
OSes for phones out there that's got any longevity to it.

65
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:17,800
We'll see what happens with Purism and whether they can deliver next year, but for now, we've

66
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:21,880
got Ubuntu Touch, it's here, let's try and make it the best that we can.

67
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:26,400
And on the opposite end of the spectrum, another project that we're seeing some life from is

68
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,320
Android x86.

69
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:35,440
They have an 8.1 RC1 release, yeah, it's an Oreo-based x86 release of the Android project.

70
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:40,760
And speaking of Purism, I gave this a go on my Librem 15.

71
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:42,360
How did you get on with that then?

72
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:44,220
Much better than in virtualization.

73
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:51,480
They do have support for VMware and QEMU to have Mesa 3D acceleration, but boy, is it

74
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:52,480
dog slow.

75
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:58,240
But when you load it on physical hardware with Intel HD graphics, you get full OpenGL

76
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,240
acceleration.

77
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:06,480
And so I downloaded the 64-bit ISO and I chose the Taskbar launcher, which gives you an alternative

78
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:11,120
Windows-like launch bar at the bottom, not quite like you see on Chrome OS.

79
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:16,680
It's kind of a mix between what you would see on, say, Windows 10 and Chrome OS.

80
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:19,520
And there's two launchers that it ships with, but I went with Taskbar because that's the

81
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,520
one they've added with this release.

82
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:22,840
And it worked pretty well.

83
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:29,280
It also has modal windows, so you can maximize and they go full screen, or you can un-maximize

84
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:32,020
and they're modal windows that you can drag around.

85
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:35,680
So I had the Play Store open and the Twitter client open at the same time.

86
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:40,940
And yes, if you're on 64-bit, the Google Play services comes pre-installed and it works

87
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:41,940
pretty good.

88
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:44,320
There's some bugs with the 32-bit version where it can crash.

89
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:46,880
It's installed, but it's a little crashy.

90
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,160
And I updated Chrome.

91
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:55,200
I updated several apps on it and I set up my Google account, so my emails were coming

92
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:57,160
in via Android notifications.

93
00:05:57,160 --> 00:06:00,020
It actually wasn't a horrible experience.

94
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:02,720
It was a little tedious managing the Windows.

95
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:06,080
But if that Librem 15 had a touch screen, it might have been a little bit better.

96
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:07,840
Well, enter my VivoBook.

97
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:12,600
I've got a little, I think it's an 11-inch Asus VivoBook with a touch screen.

98
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:16,400
And it's almost made for Android X86.

99
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:21,340
It's just a great experience having a proper keyboard to type on when you need to.

100
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:24,020
And I tried out both launchers on it.

101
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:27,320
One of the launchers is just very standard Android.

102
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:30,540
But this Taskbar launcher, it's just great.

103
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:32,160
It's kind of a little bit crumbly.

104
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:34,880
It's a little bit like LXQ.

105
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,220
It's exactly what I like.

106
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:40,920
It looks very much like my XFCE desktop that I'm looking at right now, so I'm fully on

107
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:41,920
board with it.

108
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:45,140
Very simple, searchable menu that works exactly as it should.

109
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:50,840
I'm tempted to stick it on a partition on that VivoBook and use it regularly because

110
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:53,120
it's a great release.

111
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:57,640
And the reason I wanted to talk about this was we actually talked about the last release,

112
00:06:57,640 --> 00:07:03,800
which was based on Android 7, came out in February, which was long delayed.

113
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:10,080
Whereas now, I looked it up, Android 8.1 came out six months ago, and now we are almost

114
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:12,240
at a final release of Android X86.

115
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:15,280
Okay, that's not great, but they're improving.

116
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:19,080
It shows that development is accelerating on this.

117
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:22,720
In my opinion, it's better than what you get on most Android handsets.

118
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,160
Well, exactly.

119
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,160
Yeah.

120
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:27,520
It's not too bad, a six-month window.

121
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:32,520
I mean, it would be nice for them to slim that down to be day one if they could, but

122
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:34,320
I can't see that happening anytime soon.

123
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:40,280
And Android P is going to be out fairly soon by the looks of things, so they will end up

124
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:44,240
being a release behind, but it shows that this project is not dead.

125
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:48,320
And it's really cool to have it, especially if you've got a touchscreen device like I

126
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:49,320
have.

127
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:52,960
Unfortunately, it doesn't work on my little tablet.

128
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:57,240
I don't think I've talked about this before, but a while ago, just as a kind of stupid

129
00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:02,400
purchase, I bought a Link 7 tablet, it's a seven-inch Atom-based tablet that came with

130
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:06,920
Windows 8, and I bought it just to see if I could get Linux working on it.

131
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:12,800
And Fedora actually boots straight away on it and works perfectly, so that's pretty cool.

132
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:17,840
But unfortunately, it doesn't work with hardware acceleration with Android X86, so I could

133
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:23,360
have had a really cheap, really quite powerful Android tablet there, but unfortunately not.

134
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:28,800
Yeah, if you've got a touchscreen laptop, just boot it up live, check it out.

135
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,840
If anything else, it's just a bit of fun, really.

136
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:31,840
Yeah.

137
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:35,120
I mean, to be clear, it does fully support the mouse and keyboard.

138
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:40,920
So I was using it on my Librem 15 with just my trackpad and the keyboard.

139
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:44,620
There was a couple of times where the mouse became unresponsive as something grabbed attention,

140
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:46,880
so it wasn't a perfect experience.

141
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:51,260
But there's just a couple other things they've added that do almost put this in the legitimate

142
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:53,040
daily driver category.

143
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:56,120
First of all, it's kind of a no-brainer if there's a couple of Android apps you really

144
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:58,120
like, like the Twitter client, maybe the Evernote client.

145
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:02,800
If there's a couple of official Google Play apps that you just really like, it's kind

146
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:05,760
of nice to be able to just pop them into a window on your laptop.

147
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:09,760
The other thing they've added in this release is hardware acceleration for video codecs,

148
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:12,440
which means you can watch video on this thing and get decent battery life.

149
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:16,760
I think, although I didn't run it all the way down, I think I was getting five hours

150
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:17,920
on my Librem 15.

151
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:21,800
At least that's what it was projecting, and I spent at least two hours of that battery

152
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:22,800
life.

153
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:27,680
And then something else they added for this release, which I, again, think it kind of

154
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:32,400
almost makes it legitimate as a daily driver, is they've added Ethernet support.

155
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:37,020
So if you've got Ethernet on your laptop or your x86 machine and it's a common chipset,

156
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:40,400
it's going to work now because there's a Linux kernel powering this thing.

157
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:44,040
And then the last thing that just makes it a lot of fun if you just want to play around

158
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:46,940
is you can actually get this as an RPM.

159
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:51,200
And you can download it, install it on an existing system, and it'll set up QEMU for

160
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,200
you.

161
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:56,480
They also have a guide for using Alien to convert it to a deb to put it on Debian systems.

162
00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:00,400
So you can get it as an ISO, obviously, but you can also grab it as an RPM.

163
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:05,120
Well, Android may well be on the path to becoming irrelevant anyway, because surely Fuchsia is

164
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,120
the future.

165
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:07,200
Oh, man.

166
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,600
You're raising my blood pressure just talking about it.

167
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:14,700
And there's some details in the future Fuchsia releases, that's fun to say, that make it

168
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:18,240
look like Linux apps could be coming to Fuchsia.

169
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,240
What?

170
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:20,880
Yeah, it's not just for mobile devices.

171
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:24,920
There is some proper software in this thing to make it a full desktop stack.

172
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:29,880
And one of the things they're adding is guest apps, which allow you to boot up a virtual

173
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:32,200
OS inside Fuchsia.

174
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:36,720
And there's support today for a Debian based environment.

175
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:40,540
And now support is being added for what looks like a Chrome OS environment.

176
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:46,960
And part of this is using that same Vert IO technology that so many other VMs use on Linux

177
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:49,720
as part of Linux's KVM stack.

178
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:54,640
Now part of the Vert IO standard is this new VSOC, the virtual socket stuff that we've

179
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:59,400
talked about recently, that's enabling Chromebooks to run Linux apps.

180
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:04,280
In fact, that's that VSOC kernel module is the thing that Google is backporting to older

181
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:07,600
kernels to enable Linux apps on older Chromebooks.

182
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:13,120
This VSOC stuff's kind of the key piece to make no mouse lag, automatic adjustment of

183
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:18,660
screen resolution, supporting a copy and paste and transferring of files of virtualized applications

184
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:20,840
really smooth and transparent on a desktop.

185
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:26,180
That's what Vert IO with this VSOC kernel hook can accomplish.

186
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:29,600
And it's the same technology in Fuchsia and Chrome OS.

187
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:34,000
And when you put it all together, it looks like they're making one singular runtime across

188
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,040
these operating systems to run Linux applications.

189
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:43,040
Yeah, and suddenly this is looking less like some abstract project for the future and more

190
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:46,200
like something that's coming around the corner.

191
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:50,720
And it's fairly obvious why Google wants to do this, at least to me, and that is because

192
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:55,720
they don't want to have the Linux kernel anywhere near it because of the GPL.

193
00:11:55,720 --> 00:12:00,400
Fuchsia is all permissively licensed, and that's the way they want to go with it.

194
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:03,760
Yeah, that's why it raises my blood pressure when we talk about it on the show.

195
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:10,600
It gets me a little anxious because Linux powering all of these mobile handsets in everybody's

196
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:15,240
pockets has been a big part of the Linux success story for a long time now.

197
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:21,720
And it plays a huge role in the weight that Linux devices now carry with industry manufacturers.

198
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:29,280
If that were to transition to a non-GPL operating system, all of the advances in that operating

199
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:34,240
system would primarily be going to one single entity, Google.

200
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:40,600
See, the advantage of Android being powered by Linux today is everybody has to contribute

201
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:42,360
those improvements upstream.

202
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:49,320
So the general technology platform that powers things from digital ocean droplets to watches

203
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:52,140
is getting the same improvements.

204
00:12:52,140 --> 00:12:58,960
If it's all controlled by Google, as long as the license is something where people don't

205
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:02,520
have to contribute back upstream or they don't have to make it available to everybody, we

206
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:04,200
all lose.

207
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:10,040
As a thought experiment, imagine for a moment if every singular improvement that Apple made

208
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:15,000
to the core of Mac OS had to be upstreamed to the FreeBSD project.

209
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,160
Now I grant you, it's not based on the FreeBSD kernel.

210
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:22,240
This isn't a good one-to-one comparison, but as a thought experiment, consider how much

211
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:28,600
further ahead FreeBSD may be on the desktop today if all of the desktop improvements Apple

212
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:30,640
had to submit back upstream.

213
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:33,940
A lot of that is essentially what's happened with Android and Linux.

214
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:40,120
So many improvements to power management, ARM compatibility, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, those

215
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:45,400
improvements have been contributed by hundreds of different hardware manufacturers that are

216
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:47,960
involved in the Android ecosystem.

217
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:52,580
And it's not like Android would go away tomorrow, but if Google made a strong shift, you got

218
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:56,780
to imagine a lot of Google's ecosystem would eventually make the transition with them.

219
00:13:56,780 --> 00:14:00,840
But the difference here is that with it being permissively licensed, Google could make it

220
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:03,540
proprietary, but they haven't yet.

221
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:09,480
And so that is surely the great hope here that they will keep it open source just with

222
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:12,400
the insurance policy of the permissive license.

223
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:15,120
But it still benefits so many less users.

224
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:23,760
When you improve Linux as a whole, you improve e-commerce, you improve the education sector,

225
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:27,520
you improve the life of people like me who are now broadcasting and making their living

226
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:29,080
using Linux.

227
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:34,600
It extends to so many areas of the ecosystem.

228
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:39,800
And even if Fuchsia is, you know, I don't care what it is, MIT license, I don't care

229
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:46,260
what it is, Berkeley license, I don't care if it's the, you know, the Sergey license.

230
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:52,060
If they're the only people using that stack, if their IoT devices and their Android devices

231
00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:56,420
and maybe, you know, their laptops are the only devices using that stack, then it only

232
00:14:56,420 --> 00:14:59,920
benefits that narrow spectrum of an ecosystem.

233
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:02,600
Yeah, but who's to say it will only be them using it?

234
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:05,640
Because if it's open source, people can take it and do what they want with it.

235
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:09,600
And if it's permissively licensed, then they can take it and do literally whatever they

236
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,120
want with it.

237
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:17,000
So you're going to potentially have loads of other OEMs and other companies making devices

238
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:21,280
that are based off Fuchsia, but I suppose then they won't necessarily have to contribute

239
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:22,280
back to it.

240
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:23,600
I suppose that's the point here.

241
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:28,520
Yeah, and really, I'm not expecting all of the industry to switch, you know, the server

242
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:33,120
market, there's so many things that are built on top of Linux, they're going to remain on

243
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:34,120
Linux.

244
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:42,200
Linux will be okay, but they won't necessarily be reaping all of that developer attention.

245
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:46,600
Last.ting.com, thank you to Ting for sponsoring the Linux Action News Show.

246
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:51,960
This is a way to do mobile that breaks the mold, the lock-in that the duopoly has here

247
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:52,960
in the States.

248
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:56,280
It's a smarter way to do mobile because if you use less, you just pay less.

249
00:15:56,280 --> 00:16:00,160
If you're savvy enough to use Wi-Fi while you're at work and home, then you really don't

250
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:03,520
need to be paying for, I don't know what, 12 gigabytes of data or whatever you might

251
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:04,520
be paying for.

252
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:06,260
Like, you don't, you need to just pay for what you use.

253
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:11,100
If you use a messaging application of any of them, besides SMS, you don't really need

254
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:13,840
to pay for a thousand text messages, do you?

255
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:18,960
I get what, three or four a month, probably mostly from two-factor stupid login systems

256
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:20,880
that shouldn't even be using SMS.

257
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:22,360
Why do I need to pay for a thousand messages?

258
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:23,440
That'd be ridiculous.

259
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:27,720
It's pay for what you use, a fair price for how much you talk, text, and data you use.

260
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:32,400
So this last month, I used way more data than I'll use for the rest of the year.

261
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:34,800
So I'll pay more for that month.

262
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:41,920
But for the next 11 months, I'm gonna pay around 40-ish bucks a month for three lines.

263
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:45,000
I got a phone and I got two MiFi devices that I use.

264
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:49,760
One MiFi device is on the GSM network, and the other MiFi device is on their CDMA network

265
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:50,760
because Ting has both.

266
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:54,920
And I can pick and choose whichever one is stronger, and I just join my systems to that.

267
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:59,720
I've got a Microtech router in my RV that connects to the different Wi-Fi access points

268
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:01,880
and does a speed test.

269
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:05,440
And then it'll switch to whichever Wi-Fi access point has the faster speed.

270
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:07,100
And I don't have to do any of it.

271
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:12,300
And legitimately, this last month of shows were recorded over the Ting connection.

272
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:13,720
And often, Joe would remark, you know what?

273
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:16,960
Our latency is better than when you're in the studio in Seattle because I am able to

274
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:19,400
choose what works best in my area.

275
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:22,720
And then to make things even better, I've got a booster up on the roof of the RV that

276
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:24,340
really boosts the signal.

277
00:17:24,340 --> 00:17:27,140
And I can sit and have great phone calls over Ting.

278
00:17:27,140 --> 00:17:30,480
And I know that I'll just pay a little bit more that month.

279
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:31,480
And then I'm done.

280
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:32,480
It's simple.

281
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:33,480
It's easy.

282
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:34,480
It's pay for what you use with nationwide coverage.

283
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:35,480
No contracts.

284
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:36,480
last.ting.com.

285
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:45,160
Okay, so let's talk about how you are suddenly regretting backing the Atari VCS.

286
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:46,160
I don't know.

287
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:48,740
I feel like this is a real hit piece by the register.

288
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:50,920
They trolled Atari hard this week.

289
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:54,880
I do agree that their PR train went off the tracks a little bit last week.

290
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:59,960
Atari VCS posted a link to some register coverage on their Facebook page and added a little

291
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:00,960
commentary.

292
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:04,620
They said, we honestly can't explain this article.

293
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:08,100
Our executive sat with that reporter for a half an hour.

294
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:11,160
And he wrote what he wanted instead of what was discussed with him.

295
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:16,860
Sadly, there are even irresponsible trolls in quote, professional positions, I guess.

296
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:20,120
We clearly said that we were bringing engineering design models to GDC.

297
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:22,960
And lots of people clearly don't understand what that means.

298
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:23,960
Hunks of plastic?

299
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:24,960
Well, yeah.

300
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:28,120
Yeah, that's how you finalize the designs and confirm that you can get the look and

301
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:31,360
feel of what you want for the finished product.

302
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:32,880
Sad.

303
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:35,560
And so the register had written, you know, hey, they were just hunks of plastic that

304
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:36,560
didn't work yet.

305
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:39,160
They didn't have any working demos.

306
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:45,580
And then the register responds with a full copy of the interview with this executive,

307
00:18:45,580 --> 00:18:47,940
this marketing executive at Atari.

308
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:48,940
And it's pretty bad.

309
00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:50,280
The guy doesn't have any answers.

310
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:52,000
There was no product to show at the time.

311
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,860
They hadn't even finalized the chip design.

312
00:18:54,860 --> 00:18:58,140
Only one of the two controllers was functional.

313
00:18:58,140 --> 00:19:00,400
So I agree, it doesn't sound good, Joe.

314
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:04,780
Yeah, and this was back in February, when they'd already kind of missed their initial

315
00:19:04,780 --> 00:19:07,120
goal to get the pre-orders in.

316
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:10,160
And now here we are in June, and people like you have backed this.

317
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:11,960
And it's only got a week left to go.

318
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:16,000
And you're thinking to yourself, well, if they had no clue what they were doing back

319
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:20,800
then, maybe they are not going to be able to deliver this after all.

320
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:25,800
And that original article had gone under the radar for most people.

321
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:28,480
I think I'd read it at the time, but I'd forgotten about it.

322
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:32,120
Whereas now they've just had the Streisand effect, haven't they, at the end of the day?

323
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:36,280
I think they should have just not said anything about it.

324
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:39,760
And now we're all talking about it again, and it's looking really bad for them.

325
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:41,000
But it's too late.

326
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
People have backed it.

327
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
I don't know.

328
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,520
Can you get a refund on these crowdfunding sites?

329
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:45,520
I've never tried.

330
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:49,120
See, I wouldn't expect anything but exactly this.

331
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:52,360
Because in the interview, I listened to the whole 30-minute interview, because The Register

332
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:54,880
kindly embeds it in their article.

333
00:19:54,880 --> 00:20:00,520
And the guy says they're not worried about building the Linux system, because they already

334
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:02,840
have some early prototypes of that.

335
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:03,920
That's the easy part.

336
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:07,560
The hard part is going to be building the UI on top of the Linux system.

337
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:08,680
I agree with that.

338
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:11,440
I don't think they need to finalize any of the...

339
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:17,000
It's an x86 box with an AMD CPU, and that's what it is.

340
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:21,680
The design of the box, the ports, how the controllers connect, and how they interface

341
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:25,440
with the software is way, way, way, way more complicated.

342
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:31,160
And the deals with the different game publishing outlets, building a store around all of that,

343
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:34,360
that's the hard work that is going to be really tough to pull off.

344
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:38,020
And it sounds like in that interview, that stuff's already in the works.

345
00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:42,480
He just couldn't talk about it, because they want to play the hype game, and they want

346
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:47,060
to do timed announcements with specific partners at specific times, so they just wouldn't tell

347
00:20:47,060 --> 00:20:48,280
The Register anything.

348
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:50,720
That's where some of this is coming from.

349
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:54,600
And as a backer, I'm actually not really worried.

350
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:57,780
If you were to ask me, frankly, I'd say this is exactly what I'd expect.

351
00:20:57,780 --> 00:21:03,080
I would think they probably have a few prototypes working outside of a case that are probably

352
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:07,640
not much more than a new high-end NUC at this point that they're trying out.

353
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:11,120
And then I would imagine they're going to try to find the best price to performance

354
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:14,640
ratio and thermal overhead, and put it in this case.

355
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:19,160
And then we'll just install some x86-based Linux system on there.

356
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:20,160
And they'll call it good.

357
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:21,880
Yeah, well, it's going to be based on Ubuntu, isn't it?

358
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:27,480
So that means that you've got all of the work that Canonical are doing there for free, essentially,

359
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:28,720
because it's open source.

360
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:33,080
And so then you've just got to build, well, say, just the UI and the stuff you talked

361
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:34,080
about there.

362
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:39,920
So not making it an ARM-based system means that you can just put more or less whatever

363
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:44,320
x86 chipset in there you want, and it's going to work with Ubuntu.

364
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,320
Right.

365
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:49,560
And if you get some sweet partnership with Netflix, where they're going to open up 4K

366
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:54,680
HDR streaming, then that might force you to use the most latest AMD chip.

367
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:58,640
But if that deal with Netflix doesn't work out, and you're not going to have any super

368
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:03,560
high-end thing pushing the machine at launch, you might go with the AMD chip that's already

369
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:05,160
out and a little bit cheaper.

370
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:09,200
So I could even understand not finalizing that design yet, because Linux itself is a

371
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:11,080
known quantity they can already work with.

372
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:14,360
The AMD hardware pipeline is pretty well-established at this point.

373
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:17,480
And the box seems like it's probably got the thermal capacity for whatever they want to

374
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:18,480
end up doing.

375
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:20,240
It's just going to really come down to the GPU.

376
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:22,840
So I'm actually thinking this is fine at this point.

377
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:25,920
Maybe I'm overly optimistic.

378
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:29,780
Maybe I'm going to be regretting that backing of the Atari VCS.

379
00:22:29,780 --> 00:22:32,960
But as of right now, I'm only at yellow alert.

380
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:35,280
It's funny that you used the words, this is fine.

381
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:40,200
Suddenly I'm picturing that meme with the dog and the fire.

382
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:41,200
That's true.

383
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:44,400
Everything seems to be fine over at Fedora, at least I think.

384
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:46,960
I'm not quite sure exactly what's going on.

385
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:53,560
But it appears to be the next shoe dropping in this merger of Red Hat and Core OS.

386
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:58,520
Yeah, it turns out that Michael Tunnel's joke turned out to be true, calling it Fedora Core

387
00:22:58,520 --> 00:22:59,520
OS.

388
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:00,520
It has a good ring to it.

389
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:01,760
Yeah, it does have a good ring to it.

390
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:04,320
Although there's a bit of baggage there with the old Fedora Core.

391
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:07,120
Oh, what you call baggage, I call nostalgia.

392
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:08,880
Fair enough.

393
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:13,520
But now we know that this is going to be the upstream community version of Red Hat Core

394
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:14,520
OS.

395
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:18,560
So going off of a post that Matthew Miller made at the fedoramagazine.org site, it sounds

396
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:23,400
like the new Fedora Core OS is going to be built from Fedora upstream, rather than from

397
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:25,060
Core OS upstream.

398
00:23:25,060 --> 00:23:30,800
But the way it gets delivered will be more like the way Core OS is delivered today, containers

399
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:35,440
of clustered host OS that keep themselves up to date so you just don't have to worry

400
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:36,720
about it, as he puts it.

401
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:42,900
Now, the technical details of how all of this is going to work are still being flushed out.

402
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:45,520
So don't jump to any conclusions yet.

403
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:47,200
Fedora though really is a community driven project too.

404
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:50,680
So you could still get in on the conversation and help direct where this goes.

405
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:55,560
Now he writes, I expect that over the next year or so Fedora Atomic Host will be replaced

406
00:23:55,560 --> 00:24:00,080
by a new thing combining the best of Container Linux and Project Atomic.

407
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:05,600
This new thing will be called Fedora Core OS and serve as the upstream to Red Hat Core

408
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:06,800
OS.

409
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:07,840
That's a lot to take in.

410
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:10,560
I've invited Matthew Miller to come on Linux Unplugged this week.

411
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:13,240
He's got a super busy schedule, as you can probably imagine.

412
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:17,960
But if it can work out, I'll try to get it from the horse's mouth, no offense Matthew,

413
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:21,240
to try to understand what's really going on here because it sounds like a major shift

414
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:26,280
for Fedora, but one that the project is kind of architected to take on so it has a chance

415
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:27,280
to work out.

416
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:31,380
And the key aspect you mentioned there was the community involvement.

417
00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:36,800
It's early enough in this whole process that the community can get involved, can help shape

418
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:42,160
this thing, and potentially even shape the direction that Red Hat's going to take Red

419
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:43,160
Hat Core OS.

420
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:47,680
It seems like it's really early days, so it's all still in the works, but it could make

421
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:52,400
Fedora really stand out as a uniquely differentiated Linux distribution.

422
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:56,080
Not that it isn't already, but this is a clear differentiator, so I'm kind of excited to

423
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:57,600
see where they go with it.

424
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:01,240
In the meantime, we do have some data for you Ubuntu users.

425
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:05,080
You recall the new survey that was baked into Ubuntu 18.04.

426
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:08,480
Well Canonical has done the first round of publishing the results.

427
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:12,240
And very interesting results they are too.

428
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:16,920
Some of them are pretty kind of what you'd expect, like stuff like people only having

429
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:21,600
one GPU mostly and one display mostly.

430
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:27,440
But one thing I was quite surprised about was that 1080p is the most popular display

431
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:28,440
resolution.

432
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:29,440
Yeah, 1080p.

433
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:34,480
We finally reached above that low res netbook graphic size that we were hanging out for

434
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:35,780
so many years.

435
00:25:35,780 --> 00:25:40,980
But the thing that you don't seem disappointed in, I kind of am, is one monitor?

436
00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:42,720
Everybody knows the more monitors the better.

437
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:44,360
I'm a little disappointed in that.

438
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:47,400
Yeah, it's not a battle station if you've only got one monitor, right?

439
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:51,960
Yeah, it's just way better with at least two regular monitors and one vertical monitor

440
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:52,960
from personal experience.

441
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:57,280
So come on everybody, you got to jump in on that bandwagon so that way distro maintainers

442
00:25:57,280 --> 00:25:59,280
are encouraged to support it more.

443
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:04,560
The thing that jumped out at me is 15% of people installing Ubuntu 18.04 already are

444
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:06,800
using the new minimal install option.

445
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:09,920
That's a pretty high adoption rate for a brand new feature.

446
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:15,040
75% did a fresh install while 25% did an upgrade.

447
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:21,500
I would bet you that number will climb after 18.04.01 comes out or 18.04.1 comes out because

448
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:25,760
that's when existing 16.04 users are going to get the prompt upgrade.

449
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:30,760
The 16.04 desktop users haven't even gotten that like, hey, it's time to go.

450
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:37,920
Also as a little disappointed, just going to say it right now, eight gigs of RAM is

451
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:39,400
the most common.

452
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:40,400
Really people?

453
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:45,680
Four gigs was more common than eight gig, just slightly, which that didn't surprise

454
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:52,120
me because most laptops, most cheaper laptops that you've bought in the last, I don't know,

455
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:57,480
four or five years have come with four gigabytes, but yeah, eight is actually slightly lower

456
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:58,480
than that.

457
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:03,320
But it's interesting that at least a couple of people had 128 gigs of RAM.

458
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:05,120
That must be some serious workstations.

459
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:06,840
Oh yeah, that's awesome.

460
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:09,480
Yeah, because remember these are all desktop installs.

461
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:17,840
Also speaking of the survey itself, a pretty strong 67% opt-in rate to take the survey.

462
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:18,840
That's pretty good.

463
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:22,040
And that's just within the last few weeks, 67% of people.

464
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:26,940
Yeah, although I do somewhat feel in the minority here because 90% of people download updates

465
00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:27,940
during the installer.

466
00:27:27,940 --> 00:27:31,000
I never do that because I had one bad experience one time.

467
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:34,220
Half the people use the restricted add-ons, I never bothered with that.

468
00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:39,800
And only about, well, under a third of people use auto login, which I always do.

469
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:42,200
So I feel like I'm out in the cold here.

470
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:44,760
Except for the codecs, I'm on the same.

471
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:49,400
I had a one time bad experience with downloading updates that made the install take forever

472
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:51,000
and eventually hang.

473
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:55,800
So I filed my bug, I did, and then I've never used it since.

474
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:57,840
And I installed the codecs every time.

475
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:03,160
And on all of my studio systems, I set up auto logins, which is the majority of my installs.

476
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:08,680
But the one key bit of data that we don't have yet is how many of these installs are

477
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:09,680
there.

478
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:13,040
That's the one thing they didn't publish, and they haven't published the raw data yet.

479
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:15,520
Will talks about wanting to do that as soon as possible.

480
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:21,840
But with all this GDPR stuff and general data protection concerns, you can see why they've

481
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:25,080
just put some percentages out there for now.

482
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:29,040
And they must be being very, very careful about what data they're actually going to

483
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:30,040
release.

484
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:35,360
And they did tell us that the US has the biggest Ubuntu user base, followed by Brazil, India,

485
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:36,360
China, and Russia.

486
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:39,560
Well, that's kind of the populations of the world, really, isn't it?

487
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:41,200
It's not a massive surprise.

488
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:45,400
And if you look at the graph, I think you said every single country in the world, there

489
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:46,400
are Ubuntu users.

490
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:47,800
So that tells you something.

491
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:49,640
I wonder how many distros could say that.

492
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:54,940
Yeah, we have the data linked in the show notes, as well as It's Foss did an infographic

493
00:28:54,940 --> 00:28:57,480
of all of this, which, hey, look at that.

494
00:28:57,480 --> 00:29:00,980
We got an infographic about something, Joe, and we'll put a link to that in the show notes

495
00:29:00,980 --> 00:29:01,980
as well.

496
00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:05,040
Well, I look forward to quizzing Will a little bit more about this on Late Night Linux that

497
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:06,040
we record tomorrow night.

498
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:09,500
So yeah, check that out, and hopefully we'll get some more info.

499
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:13,760
And I do want to know when we're getting the raw data, because so many people want that.

500
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:17,140
Yeah, and we'll cover it when it happens, as well as all the other stories in Linux

501
00:29:17,140 --> 00:29:18,360
and the open source world.
