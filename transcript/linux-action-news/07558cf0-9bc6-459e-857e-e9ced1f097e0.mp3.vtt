00:00.000 --> 00:09.360
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, episode 118, recorded on August 9, 2019.

00:09.360 --> 00:10.360
I'm Chris.

00:10.360 --> 00:11.360
And I'm Joe.

00:11.360 --> 00:12.360
Hello, Joe.

00:12.360 --> 00:17.320
It's good to be connected with you a little early this week, but we already have a packed

00:17.320 --> 00:21.200
news list and we start with some big news from NVIDIA.

00:21.200 --> 00:27.600
I genuinely did a double take when I saw this, NVIDIA publishing GPU hardware documentation

00:27.600 --> 00:30.240
that's actually going to help the Nuvo driver.

00:30.240 --> 00:31.240
Surely not.

00:31.240 --> 00:36.560
Veronica's got a quote from NVIDIA and the direct quote reads, NVIDIA has released public,

00:36.560 --> 00:43.120
freely available, that's a MIT licensed, documentations and portions of its GPU hardware interface.

00:43.120 --> 00:48.360
This is a work in progress and not all interfaces have been published.

00:48.360 --> 00:54.180
Now the background on this is this has been a multi-year undertaking that's just now starting

00:54.180 --> 01:00.240
to see fruits of labor hit GitHub and that was years of getting the licensing in order,

01:00.240 --> 01:02.000
at least according to NVIDIA.

01:02.000 --> 01:08.360
The documentation made public at this point primarily covers the Maxwell, Pascal, Volta

01:08.360 --> 01:12.000
and Kepler generations of NVIDIA graphics.

01:12.000 --> 01:16.400
Obviously there's some more later generation graphics that aren't yet in there and there's

01:16.400 --> 01:19.160
no word on when we might see documentation on that.

01:19.160 --> 01:23.240
So I'm not going to be running my RTX 2080 with totally free drivers and getting the

01:23.240 --> 01:25.560
same frame rates as the proprietary one just yet then.

01:25.560 --> 01:29.000
Well, no, but that's mostly because you don't have an RTX 2080.

01:29.000 --> 01:31.640
So that also is.

01:31.640 --> 01:35.520
So the initial documentation, just to just so you kind of have an idea of what to expect,

01:35.520 --> 01:41.040
it really just covers the BIOS tables, the device control block, device initialization,

01:41.040 --> 01:47.320
the security around the Falcon engine, also documentation on memory clocking, tweaking,

01:47.320 --> 01:52.540
shader program headers, power states, which could be great for laptops and some other

01:52.540 --> 01:53.840
various bits.

01:53.840 --> 02:00.200
It's not necessarily exhaustive documentation, but coming from nothing, it's substantially

02:00.200 --> 02:03.860
more than anything we've ever seen out of NVIDIA ever.

02:03.860 --> 02:05.880
So it is substantial in that sense.

02:05.880 --> 02:06.880
Yeah.

02:06.880 --> 02:11.920
My read on it is that it's a big step and it's going to be very helpful for the nouveau

02:11.920 --> 02:16.640
developers, but it's not anywhere near where we are with AMD.

02:16.640 --> 02:18.840
Yeah, I think that's a fair assessment.

02:18.840 --> 02:23.120
And there's a hurdle right now that the nouveau projects working on to try to make life easier

02:23.120 --> 02:27.520
for laptop users or people that want to run systems in lower power modes.

02:27.520 --> 02:32.320
There's an issue where they need to talk to the firmware in a certain way to reclock the

02:32.320 --> 02:37.660
GPU speed and make things run a little slower and they can't get past the signed firmware.

02:37.660 --> 02:43.340
The documentation does nothing to address that, which is a current sore spot for the

02:43.340 --> 02:44.680
project right now.

02:44.680 --> 02:47.660
It would have been great to see something to help with that, but I think that's a much

02:47.660 --> 02:49.920
more complex issue.

02:49.920 --> 02:54.040
So it's a good first step, but it's not going to get us parity with the proprietary driver

02:54.040 --> 02:55.040
just yet.

02:55.040 --> 02:59.880
Well, it'll take a little bit of time to get there, but hopefully we will eventually.

02:59.880 --> 03:06.100
And it's taken quite a while to get ZFS on route on the Ubuntu desktop, but it looks

03:06.100 --> 03:08.600
like in 1910, we're finally going to get that.

03:08.600 --> 03:14.760
Yeah, over on the ubuntu.com blog, they write, we're going to enhance ZFS on route support

03:14.760 --> 03:16.560
in the coming cycles.

03:16.560 --> 03:20.220
Ubuntu 1910 is a first round towards this goal.

03:20.220 --> 03:27.160
We want to support ZFS on route as an experimental installer option, initially for the desktop,

03:27.160 --> 03:31.380
but keeping the layout extensible for the server later on, hint, hint, hint, perhaps

03:31.380 --> 03:33.400
maybe in the next major release.

03:33.400 --> 03:37.960
The desktop will be the first beneficiary starting in Ubuntu 1910.

03:37.960 --> 03:42.360
Keep in mind though, they are calling this quote experimental and they want you to know

03:42.360 --> 03:43.360
it.

03:43.360 --> 03:48.200
Yeah, they're saying don't put any data on there that you haven't got backed up essentially.

03:48.200 --> 03:53.120
But with ZFS on route comes a whole bunch of features that are so useful.

03:53.120 --> 03:57.460
Yeah, there's several different kinds of system recovery options that could play around with.

03:57.460 --> 04:02.440
And it makes sense to work these things out in the 1910 release cycle because perhaps

04:02.440 --> 04:06.600
you'd have something fairly robust by the time 2004 comes around, which is the next

04:06.600 --> 04:07.600
LTS.

04:07.600 --> 04:12.220
And they were writing that in that same blog post that they've shipped ZFS on the next

04:12.220 --> 04:18.880
version 8.1, which features native encryption, trimming support, checkpoints, encrypted ZFS,

04:18.880 --> 04:23.960
transmissions, quota support, performance improvements, and then they've taken the next step and made

04:23.960 --> 04:27.120
sure that grub supports booting ZFS from route as well.

04:27.120 --> 04:31.560
So it's a modern implementation of ZFS on Linux if you were going to do it.

04:31.560 --> 04:37.780
They write about it in a way that to me, because I view it as somebody who's been using ZFS

04:37.780 --> 04:42.140
on Linux in production for a little bit now, they write it as if it's never been done

04:42.140 --> 04:45.240
before and the canonical is taking the first steps.

04:45.240 --> 04:50.640
But when you consider the massive amount of users, when they do manage to deploy it in

04:50.640 --> 04:55.880
their LTS version that will adopt it, I understand their very cautious approach.

04:55.880 --> 05:01.120
But I'm here on the shores of ZFS on Linux saying, come join us friends over canonical.

05:01.120 --> 05:02.120
It works great.

05:02.120 --> 05:07.600
Well, I've never deployed ZFS on my root partition before, but I think once 1910 comes out, I'll

05:07.600 --> 05:11.000
give it a good go and give it a thorough test.

05:11.000 --> 05:12.480
I think it should be fine.

05:12.480 --> 05:13.480
Yeah.

05:13.480 --> 05:17.840
As much as I am come join us on the shores of ZFS guy right now, I think that's actually

05:17.840 --> 05:23.480
the reasonable way to go is wait for 1910 to ship, try it on a test system.

05:23.480 --> 05:27.920
And if I'm honest with you, if you look at my laptops these days, extended four, my desktop's

05:27.920 --> 05:30.280
extended four or XFS.

05:30.280 --> 05:34.960
And even I think the boot partition on our NAS here, I think that might be extended four,

05:34.960 --> 05:35.960
maybe XFS.

05:35.960 --> 05:40.760
And then all of the data sits on a ZFS side of this.

05:40.760 --> 05:42.640
And that's how I tend to deploy it.

05:42.640 --> 05:47.300
On root is nice because it gives you certain recovery options if an update goes awry or

05:47.300 --> 05:48.300
something like that.

05:48.300 --> 05:54.000
So it gives you additional resiliency once the technology has really fully been integrated

05:54.000 --> 05:56.400
and all the different edge cases have been accounted for.

05:56.400 --> 06:00.620
It's funny that already I'm seeing people bring up the licensing issue again.

06:00.620 --> 06:05.600
And if they could ship it in the server version, okay, not as a default installation option,

06:05.600 --> 06:12.760
but still it was there, you'd think that they'd be fine, but I think putting it in the desktop

06:12.760 --> 06:14.940
version is going to shine another light on that.

06:14.940 --> 06:20.080
And so we may possibly see some more controversy, but I don't think they're going to end up

06:20.080 --> 06:21.800
with any legal issues with it.

06:21.800 --> 06:26.140
I think their legal department have gone over this top to bottom and they obviously think

06:26.140 --> 06:27.140
they're fine.

06:27.140 --> 06:28.140
I have two thoughts on it.

06:28.140 --> 06:32.320
So Canonical writes in their blog post, three years ago, we spent time looking at the licensing,

06:32.320 --> 06:35.280
which applies to Linux kernel and to ZFS.

06:35.280 --> 06:40.480
Our conclusions are that we are acting within the rights granted and compliance for both

06:40.480 --> 06:41.920
licenses.

06:41.920 --> 06:44.080
So that's Canonical's position.

06:44.080 --> 06:50.100
And I have a sense that the position of the organizations and groups behind ZFS are keen

06:50.100 --> 06:51.100
to see it deployed.

06:51.100 --> 06:57.580
They'd like to see it be the universal file system across all major operating systems.

06:57.580 --> 07:02.520
And so I don't think they're likely to do anything to shut it down.

07:02.520 --> 07:06.480
Everybody always likes to cite Oracle, but times have changed, things have moved on,

07:06.480 --> 07:10.640
and there's many other players now involved in the development of ZFS.

07:10.640 --> 07:17.880
And I think to the benefit of that group, the more users of ZFS, the more funding, attention,

07:17.880 --> 07:20.680
development, all of that, that the overall file system gets.

07:20.680 --> 07:21.680
So it's a win-win.

07:21.680 --> 07:25.720
Surely, if anything, it would come from the other side, the GPL side, because that's really

07:25.720 --> 07:27.040
where the restrictions are, right?

07:27.040 --> 07:28.240
Yeah, I could see that.

07:28.240 --> 07:32.760
I'm not sure who on the GPL side would have an appetite for a fight of that scale.

07:32.760 --> 07:34.200
Well, yeah, that's the thing.

07:34.200 --> 07:37.640
I don't think there is anyone on either side who really wants the fight.

07:37.640 --> 07:43.880
And maybe these licenses are incompatible, but I just don't think anyone wants the stress

07:43.880 --> 07:47.120
of trying to test that in court or even out of court.

07:47.120 --> 07:52.280
I think the crux of Canonical's argument is they've taken ZFS.ko, the kernel extension,

07:52.280 --> 07:55.860
and they've made it a self-contained file system module.

07:55.860 --> 08:01.060
So it's not a derivative work of the Linux kernel, and it's obviously a derivative work

08:01.060 --> 08:02.860
of Opens at FS.

08:02.860 --> 08:06.740
And I think that's their argument, but yeah, you're right.

08:06.740 --> 08:08.620
It could come up again.

08:08.620 --> 08:12.560
My sense is that people that do this for a living have looked into it and determined

08:12.560 --> 08:13.600
it's a safe bet.

08:13.600 --> 08:20.360
And I wouldn't be surprised if we don't really see any legal action taken.

08:20.360 --> 08:24.520
I think right now the name of the game is market share for ZFS.

08:24.520 --> 08:28.840
But all that said, I don't think we'll be seeing it in Fedora or RHEL any time soon

08:28.840 --> 08:29.840
somehow.

08:29.840 --> 08:35.640
No, although funny enough, it's surprisingly easy to get it working in CentOS, RHEL, and

08:35.640 --> 08:36.640
Fedora.

08:36.640 --> 08:43.080
In fact, the upstream project makes packages available, and it's just a couple of minutes

08:43.080 --> 08:46.700
of effort to get fully baked ZFS support on Red Hat.

08:46.700 --> 08:51.660
And some of the largest Linux deployments of ZFS on Linux are on CentOS and Red Hat

08:51.660 --> 08:52.660
systems.

08:52.660 --> 08:55.880
It's just not right there in the installer, you have to jump through a couple of little

08:55.880 --> 08:56.880
hoops.

08:56.880 --> 08:59.640
It's a little interesting, awkward position that Red Hat's in, and you can understand

08:59.640 --> 09:03.960
why perhaps they are building Stratus, because they can see the demand from their customers.

09:03.960 --> 09:05.640
Oh, yeah, definitely.

09:05.640 --> 09:07.440
Last week, we talked about Free Office.

09:07.440 --> 09:13.920
Well, this week, the Document Foundation is very proud to announce LibreOffice 6.3.

09:13.920 --> 09:16.400
And the name of this game appears to be performance, Joe.

09:16.400 --> 09:19.620
Yeah, we can link to a blog post about LibreOffice 6.3.

09:19.620 --> 09:25.360
And they've got some charts there that show, quite frankly, astonishing performance improvements

09:25.360 --> 09:28.500
with Writer and with Calc.

09:28.500 --> 09:32.260
In fact, they were so astonishing that we did a little investigation behind the scenes

09:32.260 --> 09:37.000
to try to figure out if these numbers were possibly not legitimate, and it looks like

09:37.000 --> 09:38.000
they check out.

09:38.000 --> 09:41.300
Yeah, we got our crack research team on it, and it turned out to be various bug fixes

09:41.300 --> 09:48.100
that have done this, so it is all legit, which means this is huge news in terms of competitiveness

09:48.100 --> 09:49.100
for LibreOffice.

09:49.100 --> 09:54.760
For me, I've never had any problem with the speed of it, but maybe other people have,

09:54.760 --> 09:55.760
I don't know.

09:55.760 --> 10:00.760
And I can't conceive of it being particularly quicker on a quick machine, but maybe on lower-end

10:00.760 --> 10:03.320
machines, it might be more noticeable.

10:03.320 --> 10:09.280
But either way, this is seriously good in terms of competing with the proprietary alternatives.

10:09.280 --> 10:10.760
Absolutely.

10:10.760 --> 10:12.240
And I noticed a speed improvement.

10:12.240 --> 10:13.240
I tried it out.

10:13.240 --> 10:14.240
I noticed.

10:14.240 --> 10:16.680
It feels as fast as Free Office now.

10:16.680 --> 10:20.880
One of my notes when I tried out Free Office recently to talk about it on the show was

10:20.880 --> 10:24.120
that it felt lightweight and faster than LibreOffice.

10:24.120 --> 10:28.020
When these numbers first came out, literally, our conversation internally when we were discussing

10:28.020 --> 10:31.160
covering this story was, these numbers can't be legitimate.

10:31.160 --> 10:34.840
And when Joseph, our crack research team, checked it out, we're not kidding.

10:34.840 --> 10:39.380
We went and did research, and you can map bug fix to performance improvement, bug fix

10:39.380 --> 10:40.980
to performance improvement.

10:40.980 --> 10:44.640
And it's just one of the reasons I love covering free software, because you can do that.

10:44.640 --> 10:48.400
You can actually see the contributions directly that made a difference.

10:48.400 --> 10:52.200
And LibreOffice 6.3 represents a lot of that hard work.

10:52.200 --> 10:56.480
Not only performance improvements, though, but they've improved a couple of aspects that

10:56.480 --> 11:00.960
make running LibreOffice as your only office suite, like your entire enterprise can use

11:00.960 --> 11:02.720
LibreOffice.

11:02.720 --> 11:04.960
They've made improvements for that type of work set.

11:04.960 --> 11:10.220
And I think that's pretty important, too, including types of PDF exports that are required

11:10.220 --> 11:13.280
by certain regulations.

11:13.280 --> 11:18.880
And they've also improved the redaction support in documents and change tracking, and compatibility

11:18.880 --> 11:20.600
with proprietary file formats.

11:20.600 --> 11:26.360
LibreOffice, for me, is one of those flagship FOSS projects, or products, even, really,

11:26.360 --> 11:33.400
that are a big part of converting an organization over to open source, and ultimately, hopefully,

11:33.400 --> 11:34.400
Linux.

11:34.400 --> 11:36.400
We always talk about that strategy, don't we?

11:36.400 --> 11:39.760
First of all, you switch out the applications, and then you switch out the platform underneath

11:39.760 --> 11:40.760
that.

11:40.760 --> 11:42.720
And we need to stay competitive.

11:42.720 --> 11:48.280
And it is so great to see LibreOffice doing this work, squashing these bugs, making these

11:48.280 --> 11:51.840
improvements, and similarly with Firefox, as well.

11:51.840 --> 11:57.380
Because realistically, these days, a lot of offices, a lot of enterprise, really needs

11:57.380 --> 11:59.480
a web browser and an office suite.

11:59.480 --> 12:04.760
And once they've got those core applications, it's easier to build the rest of the stuff

12:04.760 --> 12:05.760
that they need on top of that.

12:05.760 --> 12:08.600
Trevor Burrus I think also, not just that traditional reason

12:08.600 --> 12:16.080
why it's really important, but as the market more and more shifts to cloud-hosted everything,

12:16.080 --> 12:20.440
and over time, Microsoft will shift their focus more and more to their online office

12:20.440 --> 12:21.440
suite.

12:21.440 --> 12:25.100
You see Google Docs is just catching on like wildfire everywhere.

12:25.100 --> 12:32.040
It's really nice to see a completely free, feature-rich office suite that is continuing

12:32.040 --> 12:36.860
to get competitive upgrades that make it enterprise grade.

12:36.860 --> 12:41.640
And that, I think, is going to be even more important, as perhaps some of the commercial

12:41.640 --> 12:46.720
solutions begin to focus less and less on their actual desktop applications, and focus

12:46.720 --> 12:50.640
more on their cloud solutions, because that won't work for everybody.

12:50.640 --> 12:55.280
And for the people that are left behind when that transition is made, LibreOffice is going

12:55.280 --> 12:57.280
to be a fantastic option.

12:57.280 --> 13:00.620
Peter Bell Yeah, I mean, I use Google Docs for some stuff.

13:00.620 --> 13:04.440
But for things that I don't want Google to know about, that's where LibreOffice comes

13:04.440 --> 13:05.440
into play.

13:05.440 --> 13:07.640
For those things you don't want Google to know.

13:07.640 --> 13:08.920
Peter Bell Yeah, exactly.

13:08.920 --> 13:14.840
For things that I want to keep on my LAN, or possibly share privately with people, anything

13:14.840 --> 13:19.040
that's in Google Docs, I consider it essentially public, really.

13:19.040 --> 13:24.440
So I think it's very important to have this software that you can run completely, you

13:24.440 --> 13:29.720
can disconnect your network cable, and you can still use LibreOffice completely perfectly.

13:29.720 --> 13:33.680
You can use all the functions of it, whereas good luck with Google Docs trying to do that.

13:33.680 --> 13:37.000
Peter Bell Yeah, even if you're on your Samsung DeX.

13:37.000 --> 13:48.100
Peter

13:48.100 --> 14:15.840
Right.

14:15.840 --> 14:22.060
When you still get the traditional DeX arrangement, if you want to get a USB-C to HDMI cable,

14:22.060 --> 14:27.120
you could still hook DeX up to a screen and then get a Bluetooth mouse and keyboard and

14:27.120 --> 14:31.080
use DeX in the traditional sense that we've talked about it before.

14:31.080 --> 14:37.320
This is now adding the ability to remote control the DeX environment from another machine,

14:37.320 --> 14:39.660
I assume, on the same LAN.

14:39.660 --> 14:41.720
They haven't given us those details yet.

14:41.720 --> 14:46.480
But this remote session also lets you drag and drop files from the desktop and to the

14:46.480 --> 14:47.480
phone.

14:47.480 --> 14:52.800
So I guess in theory, you could sit down at a proprietary desktop workstation, open up

14:52.800 --> 14:56.680
your DeX environment, get your job done, and then when you go back to your desk, you would

14:56.680 --> 15:02.840
plug into a dock of some kind and have your native DeX environment right there on a screen.

15:02.840 --> 15:08.760
So it's sort of another, I guess, way to take advantage of a screen and keyboard.

15:08.760 --> 15:12.360
You probably find a lot of systems that are sitting there running an operating system.

15:12.360 --> 15:15.600
You could just, with a perfectly good mouse and keyboard and screen, just take over it

15:15.600 --> 15:16.600
and run DeX.

15:16.600 --> 15:18.440
It's kind of cool, I guess.

15:18.440 --> 15:24.280
I think giving people the ability to run it on top of an existing operating system on

15:24.280 --> 15:30.240
a laptop is going to make this much more likely to succeed than having to mess around plugging

15:30.240 --> 15:33.320
in external peripherals because who even has a screen?

15:33.320 --> 15:37.800
Okay, I'm looking at one huge screen and you're looking at about 20 in your studio there.

15:37.800 --> 15:38.800
I need more screens, Joe.

15:38.800 --> 15:39.800
I need more.

15:39.800 --> 15:40.800
I need more.

15:40.800 --> 15:42.920
Yeah, get the VR headset on and get a few more.

15:42.920 --> 15:45.080
But most people just have a laptop, right?

15:45.080 --> 15:46.080
Yeah, exactly.

15:46.080 --> 15:47.560
And that's where this does make sense.

15:47.560 --> 15:55.120
I think the problem I'm having is I've watched Samsung bounce this DeX idea around for a

15:55.120 --> 16:01.000
long time now, even before they were really calling it DeX, and I'm still not clicking

16:01.000 --> 16:02.000
with it.

16:02.000 --> 16:08.920
It feels like I would be the target user, a nice high-end Android phone with a portable

16:08.920 --> 16:13.200
Linux environment that can run on physical hardware or remote on another system.

16:13.200 --> 16:18.320
I mean, that really seems like it'd be my wheelhouse and for some reason, not doing

16:18.320 --> 16:19.700
it for me, Joe.

16:19.700 --> 16:25.920
Maybe in the age of long battery life laptops and tablets, I just don't see a need for it.

16:25.920 --> 16:33.280
If I had only one machine and it was a Note 10 or a Note 10 Plus, come on, let's be honest,

16:33.280 --> 16:36.720
then maybe I see it, but guys, that seems like a niche.

16:36.720 --> 16:41.880
Well, maybe if instead of including a giant stylus in the body of the phone, they just

16:41.880 --> 16:45.000
put a tiny little headphone jack, I might be willing to buy it.

16:45.000 --> 16:46.000
No, there's no room, Joe.

16:46.000 --> 16:47.000
No, there's no room.

16:47.000 --> 16:48.000
Yeah.

16:48.000 --> 16:49.000
Yeah.

16:49.000 --> 16:50.000
Who even uses that stylus?

16:50.000 --> 16:51.000
I'm just so annoyed.

16:51.000 --> 16:52.920
I'm so annoyed by this.

16:52.920 --> 16:56.560
This was the last holdout of the headphone jack and now it's gone.

16:56.560 --> 16:57.560
It's glorious.

16:57.560 --> 16:58.560
It's glorious.

16:58.560 --> 17:03.240
As an iPhone user since the iPhone 7, I have been waiting for this day.

17:03.240 --> 17:08.560
But as for who's going to use this, I think you might be right.

17:08.560 --> 17:12.640
It's a solution looking for a problem that it seems doesn't really exist anymore.

17:12.640 --> 17:16.920
I think when we first started to hear of this a couple of years ago, if they'd managed to

17:16.920 --> 17:23.000
execute on it perfectly immediately then, then maybe it would have taken off, but with

17:23.000 --> 17:27.320
devices like the iPad Pro coming out and as you say, light laptops that have got huge

17:27.320 --> 17:30.820
battery lives, it just seems a bit too late really.

17:30.820 --> 17:35.980
It could have been more practical maybe if the industry had focused on battery life and

17:35.980 --> 17:44.320
additional CPU power and focused less on size and weight and edge to edge glass.

17:44.320 --> 17:48.800
If these things were really powerful, like at a level that was beyond what they are right

17:48.800 --> 17:54.140
now and the battery would run well and last a while and it wouldn't overheat, then I would

17:54.140 --> 17:58.520
think, okay, this is a machine that's capable of delivering an environment I want, but right

17:58.520 --> 18:04.200
now when I think of a ultra thin note 10 plus running a desktop environment, I think of

18:04.200 --> 18:08.880
a phone that's probably pulling more power than a wireless charger could even probably

18:08.880 --> 18:09.880
provide.

18:09.880 --> 18:15.480
It's hot to the touch when I pick it up and it's likely going to be laggy.

18:15.480 --> 18:21.400
I don't know that to be, and I'd love to be proved otherwise, but that's what I envision

18:21.400 --> 18:25.320
when I think of this product and there's just better solutions now.

18:25.320 --> 18:26.480
I think that's just what it is.

18:26.480 --> 18:31.720
There's just better solutions and this dream, this dream never really took hold.

18:31.720 --> 18:32.720
Yeah.

18:32.720 --> 18:36.360
Well, all that said, if they want to send me one for free, I'll happily play with it,

18:36.360 --> 18:40.040
but I'm not shelling out over a thousand quid for it somehow.

18:40.040 --> 18:41.040
No way.

18:41.040 --> 18:42.560
Not unless it's running Harmony OS.

18:42.560 --> 18:44.120
That's what I'm holding out for.

18:44.120 --> 18:45.120
Yeah.

18:45.120 --> 18:50.320
So Huawei have been teasing this for a long time, but they actually did an announcement

18:50.320 --> 18:56.880
today as we record and this looks like quite an interesting operating system to me.

18:56.880 --> 18:57.880
Yeah.

18:57.880 --> 18:59.480
They're coming in really strong.

18:59.480 --> 19:03.400
They're dropping phrases like we could switch immediately from Android if we needed to.

19:03.400 --> 19:07.360
It's the OS we need to address future challenges.

19:07.360 --> 19:14.280
One platform for all devices from smart speakers to wearables and phones in between.

19:14.280 --> 19:19.340
It's Harmony OS and it's been in development for really several years and there's been

19:19.340 --> 19:20.340
lots of rumors.

19:20.340 --> 19:23.360
We've seen some of them come in and we've been like, well, let's keep an eye on that,

19:23.360 --> 19:25.020
but we're not going to cover it.

19:25.020 --> 19:30.080
And now at the Huawei Developer Conference, they finally shared some of the early details

19:30.080 --> 19:32.960
about Harmony OS.

19:32.960 --> 19:39.800
Now what we do know is that it's a microkernel-based system like Google's Fuchsia OS, unlike Linux,

19:39.800 --> 19:43.640
and they claim the use of this microkernel is at the heart of what makes it possible

19:43.640 --> 19:49.240
to run across all devices and makes it more secure because, quote, it provides the most

19:49.240 --> 19:56.260
basic services like thread scheduling and IPC, while most system services are then implemented

19:56.260 --> 19:59.200
in user space, again, just like Fuchsia.

19:59.200 --> 20:03.280
But it's not going to be compatible with Android apps out of the box, developers are going

20:03.280 --> 20:05.840
to have to recompile them.

20:05.840 --> 20:09.680
But Huawei are saying that it's going to be really easy to do that.

20:09.680 --> 20:11.680
I'm skeptical of that.

20:11.680 --> 20:16.720
They are going to be providing an IDE to make it as simple as possible, but I think we're

20:16.720 --> 20:18.200
going to have to wait and see on that one.

20:18.200 --> 20:22.480
Yeah, they say this is going to be a three-year transition if they have to go through with

20:22.480 --> 20:23.480
it.

20:23.480 --> 20:26.840
And I think part of that three years is this particular problem.

20:26.840 --> 20:29.800
There's no apps for this OS, and there's no market.

20:29.800 --> 20:35.120
And they talk about it as small changes, especially if you're already using Kotlin or a language

20:35.120 --> 20:38.840
like C++, it won't be a big deal.

20:38.840 --> 20:43.300
I think that's often the story these companies say, that's what they'll tell you.

20:43.300 --> 20:47.400
That's going to be the hardest part for them, is the apps, and the fact that they didn't

20:47.400 --> 20:53.060
make a direct layer, like a compatibility layer, maybe that's for safety, I'm not sure.

20:53.060 --> 20:56.040
But it's going to hurt them as far as apps initially.

20:56.040 --> 21:01.080
Though they're making the case that if you play their game, you're going to have a much

21:01.080 --> 21:02.800
better performance story.

21:02.800 --> 21:06.960
In fact, they're kind of taking direct shots, not just at Android, but they're taking direct

21:06.960 --> 21:07.960
shots at Linux.

21:07.960 --> 21:13.880
They say, unlike Android, which uses the Linux kernel scheduling mechanism, Harmony OS uses

21:13.880 --> 21:20.200
a deterministic latency engine that provides precise resource scheduling with real-time

21:20.200 --> 21:24.240
load analysis and forecasting.

21:24.240 --> 21:27.380
And it'll do app characteristic matching.

21:27.380 --> 21:37.360
The result is a 25.7 and 55.6 improvement in response and latency fluctuation, respectively.

21:37.360 --> 21:40.880
They're claiming a pretty big performance improvement by changing the way the kernel

21:40.880 --> 21:44.720
manages tasks and by changing some of the stack.

21:44.720 --> 21:48.160
They're kind of making the case for Google's Fuchsia OS, and it's hard to tell if this

21:48.160 --> 21:52.400
whole thing is just a big bluff because they claim they're going to be shipping this on

21:52.400 --> 21:53.400
TVs soon.

21:53.400 --> 21:57.880
Well, yeah, one of their claims is that this is going to run across multiple device classes,

21:57.880 --> 22:03.000
so IoT, TVs, watches, and phones.

22:03.000 --> 22:04.820
But that, to me, is a bit of a red flag, really.

22:04.820 --> 22:08.720
When a company claims that before they've even released anything, that seems like pie

22:08.720 --> 22:09.920
in the sky to me.

22:09.920 --> 22:11.560
But we'll see on that one.

22:11.560 --> 22:13.880
It seems like the ideal way to engineer something.

22:13.880 --> 22:18.160
If engineers could rule the world, you would have one platform like that that scaled from

22:18.160 --> 22:21.160
the watch to the television to the phone to the tablet, et cetera, et cetera.

22:21.160 --> 22:22.520
That would be great.

22:22.520 --> 22:23.520
They would love that.

22:23.520 --> 22:27.680
But then when you look at what's worked in the marketplace, that really hasn't bared

22:27.680 --> 22:28.680
out.

22:28.680 --> 22:33.540
In a statement from Huawei, a representative confirmed that the Honor smart screen is going

22:33.540 --> 22:36.600
to be the first product running Harmony OS.

22:36.600 --> 22:41.240
And then the company intends to continue using Android for the time being.

22:41.240 --> 22:45.720
And then comments from Huawei's consumer CEO noted that the company's situation with Android,

22:45.720 --> 22:50.040
as far as they're concerned, still remains unclear.

22:50.040 --> 22:55.640
What I read that as is this is their big show.

22:55.640 --> 22:59.840
They're putting their tail feathers out there saying, we don't need you.

22:59.840 --> 23:03.920
But there's a window for you to work this out with us still, if you would like to.

23:03.920 --> 23:05.760
It's kind of a famous negotiating tactic.

23:05.760 --> 23:09.240
They're just doing it on a massive world stage.

23:09.240 --> 23:12.860
What really caught my attention, though, was the kind of dig that they made at Google and

23:12.860 --> 23:18.600
Android in that they're looking to establish a proper open source foundation and properly

23:18.600 --> 23:23.080
open source it, and they made it sound like this was not going to be just throw it over

23:23.080 --> 23:28.400
the wall style like Android, like it's going to be a proper community development effort.

23:28.400 --> 23:33.320
And if that's true, then this is genuinely quite exciting, because I think with future

23:33.320 --> 23:36.840
we're probably going to see the Android style throw it over the wall as well.

23:36.840 --> 23:41.400
So this could potentially be a serious competitor.

23:41.400 --> 23:44.680
That's something I think we should look further into is what their intentions are there or

23:44.680 --> 23:48.600
if they have any plans yet, because they have been vague.

23:48.600 --> 23:51.600
And maybe that's where we'll turn our attention to next behind the scenes is trying to get

23:51.600 --> 23:53.960
more information on how that's going to work.

23:53.960 --> 23:58.680
Because you're right, if they do this properly, and it's a legitimate open source project,

23:58.680 --> 24:03.040
this could be a game changer for the community.

24:03.040 --> 24:07.920
And I mean, I couldn't overstate the benefits of that, really.

24:07.920 --> 24:10.760
So I think it's worth digging in too further, because at this point in time, we don't know

24:10.760 --> 24:11.760
what we're going to get.

24:11.760 --> 24:13.240
They've made some big implications, you're right.

24:13.240 --> 24:18.140
They make it sound like they won't do the Android style, they won't repeat those mistakes

24:18.140 --> 24:20.520
is kind of the messaging.

24:20.520 --> 24:24.520
But then they haven't really said what they're going to do instead.

24:24.520 --> 24:29.440
And that really, I think, is the crux of it as far as our community is concerned, is how

24:29.440 --> 24:32.880
you implement that community, how you do all of that.

24:32.880 --> 24:33.880
It matters so much.

24:33.880 --> 24:35.200
So we'll just have to wait and see.

24:35.200 --> 24:38.120
And obviously, we'll be keeping our eyes on it and doing as much digging as we can.

24:38.120 --> 24:44.160
A bit of a tangent, but smart displays, right, you know about this sort of thing.

24:44.160 --> 24:48.200
What's the difference between a smart display and a tablet that you can't pick up and move?

24:48.200 --> 24:51.000
The smart display is a little more minimal OS.

24:51.000 --> 24:54.960
Like in the case of Google, it's running like Chromecast OS underneath, instead of, say,

24:54.960 --> 24:58.720
a whole Android OS that has apps that have to be updated and all that kind of stuff.

24:58.720 --> 24:59.720
Right.

24:59.720 --> 25:02.080
So it's just a useless tablet that you can't move, then.

25:02.080 --> 25:03.120
Right, right, right.

25:03.120 --> 25:07.840
It's like a tablet that's been bolted to a speaker that does 10% of the things a tablet

25:07.840 --> 25:08.840
can do.

25:08.840 --> 25:09.840
Right.

25:09.840 --> 25:10.840
And costs about the same.

25:10.840 --> 25:11.840
Excellent.

25:11.840 --> 25:12.840
All right.

25:12.840 --> 25:17.400
Well, let's end with the news that Linux Journal is shutting down.

25:17.400 --> 25:21.960
And that may trigger a bit of deja vu in some people, because it was not even two years

25:21.960 --> 25:27.340
ago that they almost shut down, and then Private Internet Access came along and saved them.

25:27.340 --> 25:29.120
But this time, it seems it's for real.

25:29.120 --> 25:30.820
The money's run out.

25:30.820 --> 25:32.840
And so that's it.

25:32.840 --> 25:35.260
After 25 years, shut and up shop.

25:35.260 --> 25:39.080
My experiences with Linux Journal were always in the physical world.

25:39.080 --> 25:45.160
They would have a booth at an event, and they always had a great booth, great branding,

25:45.160 --> 25:50.160
and just really engaging people at the booth that wanted to have a conversation about Linux.

25:50.160 --> 25:53.480
And it just really made you feel like, man, these are really part of the community.

25:53.480 --> 25:55.480
These individuals really get it.

25:55.480 --> 25:58.480
So it's sad to see a group of people like that have to move on.

25:58.480 --> 26:03.880
I do have a bit of good news, though, is my favorite Linux magazine, Linux Format, continues

26:03.880 --> 26:04.880
on.

26:04.880 --> 26:07.920
And it's not cheap, but I think you can understand why after this news.

26:07.920 --> 26:09.760
So I'll put a link to that in the show notes.

26:09.760 --> 26:12.400
I really have loved Linux Format for a long time.

26:12.400 --> 26:17.160
And they have digital only, and they have a magazine and digital.

26:17.160 --> 26:19.920
And it's one of those where they'll still include some media in the magazine subscription,

26:19.920 --> 26:23.800
where you can try out a distro like they used to.

26:23.800 --> 26:25.180
I love that stuff.

26:25.180 --> 26:29.000
So we still have at least a great magazine out there over at Linux Format.

26:29.000 --> 26:30.000
Yeah.

26:30.000 --> 26:32.840
And of course, you've got your maker magazines and the various magazines that the Raspberry

26:32.840 --> 26:35.380
Pi do and 3D printing stuff.

26:35.380 --> 26:37.360
It seems to all become a bit more niche, really.

26:37.360 --> 26:38.360
Yeah.

26:38.360 --> 26:45.760
In a way, it's the reality, I think, of the general consumers coming into the market and

26:45.760 --> 26:51.260
open source winning, but not in the way Outfits, like Linux Journal, predicted.

26:51.260 --> 26:55.320
We all thought if free software and open software won, then everybody would come over to our

26:55.320 --> 26:58.940
camp and we'd be getting people writing their drivers in open source, and they'd be releasing

26:58.940 --> 27:01.000
their applications in open source.

27:01.000 --> 27:03.920
By the way, they could go in all the repos, and yay, everybody won.

27:03.920 --> 27:04.920
That's the goal.

27:04.920 --> 27:08.920
What we really got is technology companies have figured out a way to make more money,

27:08.920 --> 27:12.600
and we have more users that are enabled to do technology things that didn't exist in

27:12.600 --> 27:16.460
the past, like 3D printing, like building robots from Raspberry Pis and stuff that's

27:16.460 --> 27:17.560
incredible and great.

27:17.560 --> 27:24.400
And one of the many things that makes 2019 amazing, it just means that the victory we

27:24.400 --> 27:27.880
all thought we'd see turned out to be something different.

27:27.880 --> 27:29.640
And the reality is that you're right.

27:29.640 --> 27:35.560
There's huge communities around these individual niches now, and that's now self-sustaining.

27:35.560 --> 27:37.400
But it's a good thing.

27:37.400 --> 27:38.400
Just so much changes.

27:38.400 --> 27:39.400
It's really something.

27:39.400 --> 27:44.040
You know, it really is, especially doing this news every week now for over a decade, watching

27:44.040 --> 27:45.040
all of this.

27:45.040 --> 27:46.040
It's something.

27:46.040 --> 27:47.440
That's why we do this show every single week.

27:47.440 --> 27:52.400
Come check us out at linuxactionnews.com slash subscribe for all the ways to get new episodes.

27:52.400 --> 27:56.360
So that way you can stay in the loop, as that's what the kids say, right, Cho?

27:56.360 --> 27:57.360
In the loop?

27:57.360 --> 27:58.560
So you can stay in the know?

27:58.560 --> 27:59.560
The 411?

27:59.560 --> 28:00.560
The 411?

28:00.560 --> 28:02.560
Yeah, maybe 20 years ago.

28:02.560 --> 28:08.400
You can go to linuxactionnews.com slash contact for ways to get in touch with us.

28:08.400 --> 28:13.720
We'll be back next Monday with our weekly take on the latest Linux and open source news.

28:13.720 --> 28:15.400
I'm at Chris LAS.

28:15.400 --> 28:16.960
I'm at Joe Rissington.

28:16.960 --> 28:19.400
Thank you for joining us, and we'll see you next week.

28:19.400 --> 28:37.400
See you later.
