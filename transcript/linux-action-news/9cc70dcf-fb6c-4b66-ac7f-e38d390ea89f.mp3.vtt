00:00.000 --> 00:16.400
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, our weekly take on Linux and the open source world.

00:16.400 --> 00:21.120
This is episode 28, recorded on November 19th, 2017.

00:21.120 --> 00:22.120
I'm Chris.

00:22.120 --> 00:23.120
And I'm Joe.

00:23.120 --> 00:25.880
Hello, Joe, and happy Fedora 27 release week to you.

00:25.880 --> 00:29.760
Yeah, this is the second Fedora release that's happened during the run of this show.

00:29.760 --> 00:32.400
So that means we must have been doing it for a while.

00:32.400 --> 00:34.400
But yeah, Fedora 27.

00:34.400 --> 00:36.560
There's not a massive amount to say, is there?

00:36.560 --> 00:39.120
They've revved a lot of the packages.

00:39.120 --> 00:44.280
But otherwise, there's nothing hugely new and outstanding about it, is there?

00:44.280 --> 00:47.120
This is a nice and steady improvement over 26 to 27.

00:47.120 --> 00:52.760
You get GNOME 3.2.6, which brings in fractional high DPI scaling and the new fancy settings

00:52.760 --> 00:55.100
panel with lots of improvements.

00:55.100 --> 00:58.360
And you also get trim support for encrypted disks under Fedora.

00:58.360 --> 01:03.040
So nice workstation features, but maybe some of the more notable changes are on the server

01:03.040 --> 01:04.040
side.

01:04.040 --> 01:05.560
Yeah, it's all about modularity now.

01:05.560 --> 01:08.360
I know they've been working on modularity for a couple of releases.

01:08.360 --> 01:13.440
And I'm a big fan of this because it allows users to have a more modular operating system,

01:13.440 --> 01:17.380
which would include managing multiple components that maybe are on different life cycles.

01:17.380 --> 01:22.720
So different versions of NGINX or the database server than what is perhaps packaged upstream

01:22.720 --> 01:24.180
in the repository.

01:24.180 --> 01:26.920
There's going to be a lot of additional work that goes into this.

01:26.920 --> 01:30.380
And Fedora 27 modular server beta is available now.

01:30.380 --> 01:32.120
And you updated your droplet, didn't you?

01:32.120 --> 01:35.720
Yeah, I have a droplet that I update using DNF every single time.

01:35.720 --> 01:39.460
I wait because the Fedora project always releases a guide, and I just want to make sure I do

01:39.460 --> 01:40.820
exactly right.

01:40.820 --> 01:43.440
And I think I'm three or four releases in now.

01:43.440 --> 01:44.440
It's pretty impressive.

01:44.440 --> 01:45.440
Yeah, well, that's the thing.

01:45.440 --> 01:49.080
If you're going to have a fairly short support window and release every six months, you need

01:49.080 --> 01:51.520
to make it solid each time.

01:51.520 --> 01:54.080
And Fedora has done that again.

01:54.080 --> 01:55.080
It's a solid release.

01:55.080 --> 01:57.560
It's not massively exciting, but to me, that's good.

01:57.560 --> 01:58.560
It shouldn't be exciting.

01:58.560 --> 02:02.440
It shouldn't be something that is causing you stress.

02:02.440 --> 02:08.160
It's new kernel, it's new packages, it's new version of GNOME on the desktop, or new versions

02:08.160 --> 02:10.480
of whatever packages you need on the server.

02:10.480 --> 02:11.480
And it just works.

02:11.480 --> 02:15.840
I think it's also worth pointing out that there's a new release of the Fedora media

02:15.840 --> 02:16.840
writer.

02:16.840 --> 02:21.280
And this thing's kind of cool, because it's a great way to convert non Linux users to

02:21.280 --> 02:22.280
Fedora.

02:22.280 --> 02:27.080
It also, in this latest version, allows you to create bootable SD cards with Fedora for

02:27.080 --> 02:29.680
ARM devices, like the Raspberry Pi.

02:29.680 --> 02:34.120
And there's a Mac version where it'll download the ISO automatically and write it to a USB

02:34.120 --> 02:36.520
stick under Mac OS.

02:36.520 --> 02:38.240
Makes it easy to switch a Mac user.

02:38.240 --> 02:42.360
Yeah, but then would you really want to switch a Mac user to Fedora?

02:42.360 --> 02:48.400
Isn't Fedora kind of more aimed at people who are familiar with Linux and developers,

02:48.400 --> 02:49.400
that kind of thing?

02:49.400 --> 02:50.400
I don't know, Joe.

02:50.400 --> 02:51.400
I don't know.

02:51.400 --> 02:55.600
It's a really great, steady, upstream development work environment.

02:55.600 --> 02:59.040
It could be a pretty good way to reuse older MacBook hardware.

02:59.040 --> 03:02.920
I'm not saying go out and buy a touchbook and throw Fedora on there.

03:02.920 --> 03:06.360
But I'm saying you've got a 2013, 2015 MacBook Pro.

03:06.360 --> 03:09.960
You might at least want to try loading Fedora on there and see if you get new life out of

03:09.960 --> 03:10.960
the product.

03:10.960 --> 03:11.960
Well, you could do a lot worse.

03:11.960 --> 03:15.720
Well, in the category of doing a lot better, Firefox 57 is out.

03:15.720 --> 03:19.160
And it's a quantum leap in performance, eh, Joe?

03:19.160 --> 03:23.080
Ha ha ha, yes, the new version 57 Quantum.

03:23.080 --> 03:27.320
Now I've been trying it out a little bit, but my wife has been trying it out more.

03:27.320 --> 03:30.360
And the first thing she said to me was, oh, they've made Firefox all different.

03:30.360 --> 03:32.560
Oh, I don't like this.

03:32.560 --> 03:36.440
But then she kind of tweaked it a little bit and got it looking a little bit better than

03:36.440 --> 03:38.320
it was out of the box.

03:38.320 --> 03:40.440
And I'm fairly happy with it.

03:40.440 --> 03:42.000
She's fairly happy with it.

03:42.000 --> 03:46.840
I just don't think that I would go so far as to say it is five times better than it

03:46.840 --> 03:51.120
was, five times faster than it was six months ago.

03:51.120 --> 03:52.120
It's certainly different.

03:52.120 --> 03:56.120
It's certainly a bit faster, but I just think that they're trying to hype this up a little

03:56.120 --> 03:57.360
bit more than it deserves.

03:57.360 --> 04:00.340
Well, surprise, surprise, Joe, I'm going to disagree.

04:00.340 --> 04:05.320
I think at least as far as Firefox updates go, this is pretty much the biggest one since

04:05.320 --> 04:08.080
version one back in 2004.

04:08.080 --> 04:09.880
You've got the new UI, love it or hate it.

04:09.880 --> 04:12.520
I happen to think it's pretty good.

04:12.520 --> 04:18.320
You've got Google now as the default search provider in the US and in Canada.

04:18.320 --> 04:24.000
And they're shipping the new Stylo CSS engine, which takes advantage of multi-core hardware.

04:24.000 --> 04:28.160
So all of these things combined do seem to make a pretty substantial competitive release.

04:28.160 --> 04:33.600
I feel like performance wise, it may be outclassing Chrome now.

04:33.600 --> 04:38.000
It's not necessarily using less memory than it was in the past, but it feels like it's

04:38.000 --> 04:39.560
doing more with that memory.

04:39.560 --> 04:41.520
Well, yes, it is improved.

04:41.520 --> 04:43.560
There's no doubt about that.

04:43.560 --> 04:45.040
There've been significant improvements.

04:45.040 --> 04:48.360
And once you know about the technicalities of it, you can see how much effort's been

04:48.360 --> 04:50.040
put into it.

04:50.040 --> 04:56.640
However, Google services, now this is not Mozilla's fault, but try and interact with

04:56.640 --> 05:01.080
Google maps, for example, in Firefox, and it's still a disaster.

05:01.080 --> 05:04.680
It's a little bit better than it was, but it used to just crash all the time.

05:04.680 --> 05:09.800
And so your only option was to use Chrome basically, if you wanted to use Google maps,

05:09.800 --> 05:13.920
especially if you're doing more than just looking up one thing quickly.

05:13.920 --> 05:18.200
And now it's a little bit better, but I asked my wife, she uses Google maps all the time.

05:18.200 --> 05:24.440
I asked her to use Firefox for all the stuff she does maps with.

05:24.440 --> 05:26.960
And then a day later, she's using Chrome again.

05:26.960 --> 05:27.960
I said, what happened?

05:27.960 --> 05:32.240
Well, it was a bit better, but it's still rubbish compared to Chrome.

05:32.240 --> 05:34.120
And to me, that is the shadow.

05:34.120 --> 05:36.920
Chrome is the shadow that looms over this whole thing.

05:36.920 --> 05:37.920
I do agree.

05:37.920 --> 05:43.920
I've been back on Chrome for a few tasks myself, having tried out 57 since the hour it was

05:43.920 --> 05:44.920
released.

05:44.920 --> 05:46.200
And I really like it.

05:46.200 --> 05:49.240
It's now my casual go-to personal browser.

05:49.240 --> 05:53.840
Like my work browser is Chrome right now, and my personal daily driver is the new Firefox

05:53.840 --> 05:55.640
because I think it is really great.

05:55.640 --> 05:59.080
I particularly like how it performs under Linux.

05:59.080 --> 06:01.200
And I don't know, I think they're really nailing it.

06:01.200 --> 06:05.440
And I want to support Mozilla too, so I kind of want to at least be another user to stat

06:05.440 --> 06:09.400
out there that is representing the Firefox flag.

06:09.400 --> 06:10.540
But I agree.

06:10.540 --> 06:11.540
It's not 100%.

06:11.540 --> 06:13.760
They still have some progress to make.

06:13.760 --> 06:16.360
And Google's not sitting still with Chrome.

06:16.360 --> 06:17.360
Yeah.

06:17.360 --> 06:18.360
But that's the thing.

06:18.360 --> 06:21.760
I'm sitting here using Firefox because I care about software freedom.

06:21.760 --> 06:25.640
And even though I know that Chrome is essentially better than Firefox, I'm still using Firefox

06:25.640 --> 06:27.560
because that's how much I care about it.

06:27.560 --> 06:32.320
But if you look at all the changes that Firefox has made or Mozilla have made with Firefox

06:32.320 --> 06:37.560
over the last few years, it is trying to catch up with Chrome, putting the tabs on top like

06:37.560 --> 06:42.600
with Chrome and changing the UI generally to basically resemble Chrome.

06:42.600 --> 06:45.880
And they are chasing Chrome.

06:45.880 --> 06:50.960
And I don't know whether I agree with that strategy because, okay, Chrome has taken over

06:50.960 --> 06:52.680
in terms of market share.

06:52.680 --> 06:58.200
But should they be trying to ape them and copy them or should Mozilla be trying to forge

06:58.200 --> 06:59.200
their own path?

06:59.200 --> 07:05.160
I suppose they tried that with the privacy stuff and the we're not a huge corporation

07:05.160 --> 07:07.480
and we're not tracking you and all that stuff.

07:07.480 --> 07:09.380
And people kind of laughed at them.

07:09.380 --> 07:13.120
So they basically can't win at this point, can they?

07:13.120 --> 07:18.400
Well, I guess my closing thoughts on this would be there is some legitimate concern

07:18.400 --> 07:19.620
to what you're saying.

07:19.620 --> 07:24.500
If they spend too much time and effort chasing Chrome, then they may not do enough of their

07:24.500 --> 07:26.220
own innovation.

07:26.220 --> 07:30.020
Looking back over the past several releases of Firefox, they've been making steady progress

07:30.020 --> 07:33.060
towards a pretty big technical goal.

07:33.060 --> 07:37.040
And you've been able to watch the technologies they've chosen to build these new tools and

07:37.040 --> 07:40.240
these new engines, and they're the best stuff out there.

07:40.240 --> 07:44.960
And the processes that they've taken seem to be the best processes to build this stuff.

07:44.960 --> 07:48.500
And the way they're rolling it out seems to be a very safe, sane way to roll it out.

07:48.500 --> 07:53.400
And now that we've arrived here at 57 with all of these things coming together, I would

07:53.400 --> 07:58.380
argue that they may have a more technical superior implementation than Chrome does.

07:58.380 --> 08:01.540
And speaking to the UI, while they have some elements that seem like they are pulled from

08:01.540 --> 08:05.820
Chrome, I'm pretty sure that the Mozilla project did a lot of studying on the UI.

08:05.820 --> 08:07.940
They write about that a little bit in their blog post.

08:07.940 --> 08:11.900
And they put some real human testing into this thing to make sure it was sort of the

08:11.900 --> 08:13.240
best of both worlds.

08:13.240 --> 08:18.220
So on both points, I see where you're coming from, but I think once we've arrived here,

08:18.220 --> 08:21.420
they've handled it really well and they've come out with a product that's superior in

08:21.420 --> 08:22.420
a lot of ways.

08:22.420 --> 08:24.340
Do you think they can use the rest of the web to catch up?

08:24.340 --> 08:25.420
Well, maybe.

08:25.420 --> 08:30.580
And the bottom line is that I am still using it because it is a truly free software browser.

08:30.580 --> 08:32.740
And that, to me, is the most important thing.

08:32.740 --> 08:37.180
So as long as they keep improving, then I'm definitely sticking with it.

08:37.180 --> 08:40.620
But if you don't like these huge changes, there is an option for you.

08:40.620 --> 08:46.560
Pale Moon is a fork of Firefox that strips out some of the bloat and stuff.

08:46.560 --> 08:52.540
And they have been working on a new Brazilisk, I think is the way you pronounce it, browser

08:52.540 --> 08:57.620
technology that is still using the old Zool plugins and things.

08:57.620 --> 09:01.980
So if you really don't like change, then do check out Pale Moon and there's a link in

09:01.980 --> 09:02.980
the show notes.

09:02.980 --> 09:06.380
Go to linuxactionnews.com slash 28 and you can follow that.

09:06.380 --> 09:11.300
And if you're fed up with the changes, then you can go back to how it used to be.

09:11.300 --> 09:15.240
In the theme of keeping things the way they are and getting off my lawn, good news for

09:15.240 --> 09:16.820
me this week.

09:16.820 --> 09:22.860
There is some serious discussion of an Ubuntu Unity remix that's taking place on the Ubuntu

09:22.860 --> 09:24.240
community hub right now.

09:24.240 --> 09:30.620
I always say to people, if there's one thing I love more than XFCE, that is choice.

09:30.620 --> 09:33.200
And I've never liked Unity.

09:33.200 --> 09:34.700
There's no point pretending otherwise.

09:34.700 --> 09:35.700
I never liked it.

09:35.700 --> 09:38.900
But I know there are a ton of people out there who love it.

09:38.900 --> 09:41.700
They used it as their daily driver for years.

09:41.700 --> 09:47.060
And now they're having to change to this Gnome thing, which, OK, it's a very good implementation

09:47.060 --> 09:48.060
of it.

09:48.060 --> 09:50.380
But some people just want to stay on Unity.

09:50.380 --> 09:52.760
And isn't this the brilliant thing about Linux?

09:52.760 --> 09:55.740
We're going to have, by the looks of things, this Unity flavor.

09:55.740 --> 10:01.640
And I know you've switched over to Unity recently, so you must be very excited about it.

10:01.640 --> 10:02.780
I am very pleased to see this.

10:02.780 --> 10:06.760
I feel like it means I've made a good bet for at least the next couple of years.

10:06.760 --> 10:11.260
We'll see where things land after Wayland and all of those transitions are complete.

10:11.260 --> 10:17.340
But right now, this is promising, because it appears Canonical has given initial blessings

10:17.340 --> 10:19.300
on using the Ubuntu trademark.

10:19.300 --> 10:22.760
So that's one major step cleared right there.

10:22.760 --> 10:27.040
And if you look at the discussions taking place, it looks like there's also some pretty

10:27.040 --> 10:33.920
serious discussion on getting the Ubuntu Mate applications integrated with this Unity remix.

10:33.920 --> 10:38.420
So instead of shipping Gnome 3 apps with the large client-side decorations that look a

10:38.420 --> 10:44.460
bit funky in Unity and have removed some functionality, they would go with the Mate applications,

10:44.460 --> 10:49.180
which just need a few different modifications that are pretty easy to make.

10:49.180 --> 10:50.860
Of course, what do I know?

10:50.860 --> 10:54.640
But they seem, on the surface, having looked at the discussion, pretty straightforward.

10:54.640 --> 10:57.540
And now, all of a sudden, they'd be pretty well integrated with Unity.

10:57.540 --> 11:01.340
And then that would mean, of course, a wider adoption of these Mate applications, which

11:01.340 --> 11:05.720
means more bug submissions, more users, more code gets developed.

11:05.720 --> 11:09.140
So it's better for Ubuntu Mate, it's better for the Unity remix as well.

11:09.140 --> 11:15.660
All this has been going down on the Ubuntu community hub, and one name popped up, Martin

11:15.660 --> 11:16.660
Wimpress.

11:16.660 --> 11:18.500
And he is helping out with this.

11:18.500 --> 11:20.500
And that should tell you enough.

11:20.500 --> 11:22.980
He is the leader of Ubuntu Mate.

11:22.980 --> 11:27.740
And now that he's involved in helping them out, I think that really bodes well for it

11:27.740 --> 11:29.540
as a project, doesn't it?

11:29.540 --> 11:33.540
Having just the help of Wimpy, his experience working on Ubuntu Mate, and perhaps being

11:33.540 --> 11:36.980
able to connect them with the right people could be extremely valuable.

11:36.980 --> 11:42.220
I think looking at this, it makes more sense than it might initially seem on the surface.

11:42.220 --> 11:45.260
16.04 is going to be around for years.

11:45.260 --> 11:51.060
And as part of their commitment to 16.04, Canonica will be maintaining Unity, even after

11:51.060 --> 11:52.820
18.04 is released.

11:52.820 --> 11:55.980
And it will be shipping in the 18.04 repositories.

11:55.980 --> 12:00.700
So there will still be maintenance happening to Compiz and to Unity, even though they've

12:00.700 --> 12:04.740
switched to Gnome, because it's shipping in these LTS distributions.

12:04.740 --> 12:09.700
So this is the perfect opportunity for a community to come along and take this code, which is

12:09.700 --> 12:14.120
in maintenance mode but not yet abandoned, and start contributing real value to it, adding

12:14.120 --> 12:18.620
these Mate applications, which are continuing to see new feature enhancements and continued

12:18.620 --> 12:20.060
code improvement.

12:20.060 --> 12:23.540
And you end up with something that could be a very popular Ubuntu remix.

12:23.540 --> 12:28.500
Yeah, and potentially, although it's early days, but potentially an official flavor.

12:28.500 --> 12:33.060
I would love to see it be an official flavor and get all the support that that entails.

12:33.060 --> 12:38.300
Because as I said, there are thousands, hundreds of thousands, maybe millions of people who

12:38.300 --> 12:43.740
are used to using Unity, who would love to have an officially supported flavor of Ubuntu

12:43.740 --> 12:45.700
that lets them just keep doing what they were doing.

12:45.700 --> 12:50.780
Because it was basically feature complete, okay, it could do with some high DPI improvements,

12:50.780 --> 12:54.660
maybe a little bit, and the Wayland stuff, of course.

12:54.660 --> 12:58.940
But if there's people working on it, then why not let it live alongside Chrome?

12:58.940 --> 13:04.300
Yeah, and I also think there's a place for Unity with an updated theme.

13:04.300 --> 13:09.920
And it just maintains working on X for years, because there's, I think, a multi year transition

13:09.920 --> 13:11.460
coming to Wayland.

13:11.460 --> 13:16.020
And there will be some people on enterprise grade workstations and production grade workstations

13:16.020 --> 13:18.560
that opt to run X for a little bit longer.

13:18.560 --> 13:21.100
And why not have a first class desktop experience on that?

13:21.100 --> 13:22.100
Yeah, totally.

13:22.100 --> 13:27.780
And it's funny, you mentioned the Marte applications, it looks like Zubuntu is going to be using

13:27.780 --> 13:29.580
the Marte applications as well.

13:29.580 --> 13:32.460
I think that is also an extremely good development.

13:32.460 --> 13:36.460
Because now you've got these three distributions that are all sharing a common base, and they're

13:36.460 --> 13:40.540
all sharing a common set of applications, they all have about the same goals in mind

13:40.540 --> 13:43.180
about a traditional desktop paradigm.

13:43.180 --> 13:47.180
And three distributions using the same set of applications, at least three, it's gonna

13:47.180 --> 13:50.380
be more than that, is going to be great for the end users.

13:50.380 --> 13:54.380
I don't know about Unity having a traditional paradigm, I mean, I suppose it's traditional

13:54.380 --> 13:56.260
by now, but it's kind of the alternative.

13:56.260 --> 14:00.260
Well, it's funny, like, because I didn't think that about the music I listened to in high

14:00.260 --> 14:03.700
school, and I turned on an oldies radio station, and they're playing the oldies, and it was

14:03.700 --> 14:05.220
high school hits, Joe.

14:05.220 --> 14:08.820
Eventually, even the new stuff turns into the old stuff.

14:08.820 --> 14:13.060
Yeah, that's true.

14:13.060 --> 14:17.020
Get yourself some new service over at Ting, go to last.ting.com.

14:17.020 --> 14:18.300
It's a smarter way to do mobile.

14:18.300 --> 14:22.460
The average Ting bill is just $23 per month.

14:22.460 --> 14:26.340
It's really something compared to the traditional phone plans here in the States.

14:26.340 --> 14:30.060
You just pay for what you use, your minutes, your messages, and your megabytes.

14:30.060 --> 14:35.340
The line is $6 a month, plus Uncle Sam's cut, nationwide coverage here in the States, no

14:35.340 --> 14:40.020
contract nor the termination fee, they have GSM and CDMA networks.

14:40.020 --> 14:46.140
I brought a test CDMA phone ages ago, an old clunker, got it on the Ting network, and was

14:46.140 --> 14:51.940
immediately impressed that the $25 credit covered more than my first month, and it's

14:51.940 --> 14:55.360
been a Ting relationship ever since.

14:55.360 --> 14:59.300
Get started by going to last.ting.com, and I'm going to point you to their blog this

14:59.300 --> 15:00.300
week.

15:00.300 --> 15:05.460
If you're trying to educate friends, family, extended loved ones, whoever it might be about

15:05.460 --> 15:10.180
the woes of fishing, they have a great write-up that you can find on their blog and share

15:10.180 --> 15:13.540
with those that are concerned, and help them understand the problem of fishing.

15:13.540 --> 15:18.700
I know we don't need the blog, but we all know somebody that does.

15:18.700 --> 15:20.340
Start by going to last.ting.com.

15:20.340 --> 15:31.140
Okay, well, just a quick mention of the 4.14 release of the kernel, which there's a lot

15:31.140 --> 15:35.320
of technical stuff going on in here, but I don't want to get too bogged down in that.

15:35.320 --> 15:38.780
To me, what's really interesting here is this is the kernel that's going to be around for

15:38.780 --> 15:43.100
six years because it's the LTS, the new six-year LTS.

15:43.100 --> 15:48.420
It's going to be potentially in mobile devices, embedded devices, IoT.

15:48.420 --> 15:51.460
This is a kernel that we're going to see for a long time, I think.

15:51.460 --> 15:55.740
Yeah, that is the big news about this release, is this is the one that we'll be sticking

15:55.740 --> 15:56.740
around.

15:56.740 --> 16:01.980
This is the one that will eventually ship on Project Treble devices for Android, I believe.

16:01.980 --> 16:07.220
But it also means now that 4.14 is out, the real fun can begin with 4.15, which may see

16:07.220 --> 16:09.620
entirely new architecture support added.

16:09.620 --> 16:10.620
Yeah, RISC-V.

16:10.620 --> 16:17.460
They're totally open architecture, which I've been following for at least a couple of years

16:17.460 --> 16:21.580
now, and we're starting to see development boards coming out, and it would be absolutely

16:21.580 --> 16:24.540
amazing to see mainline support for it.

16:24.540 --> 16:29.220
Yeah, I don't know what use cases these chips are going to fill yet, but I know that there's

16:29.220 --> 16:34.460
already an industry ready to go because there has been a steady march towards this code

16:34.460 --> 16:35.460
in the Linux kernel.

16:35.460 --> 16:39.220
Now, this is just really the beginning phase of it, too, because they're still building

16:39.220 --> 16:41.260
all of the hardware around these chips.

16:41.260 --> 16:46.140
That means they still need to write device drivers, but the initial architecture is landing

16:46.140 --> 16:47.140
in 4.15.

16:47.140 --> 16:52.000
Yeah, and if you look at the Linux kernel mailing list, Torvalds himself hasn't said

16:52.000 --> 16:57.020
anything terribly bad about it, so that's a pretty good sign.

16:57.020 --> 17:02.500
There's a few issues that they need to iron out to get this support into 4.15, but I think

17:02.500 --> 17:06.820
it's looking good, fingers crossed, and then there's no looking back from there.

17:06.820 --> 17:11.220
Something Linus did talk about was this zero-day bot that's been getting even better, as he

17:11.220 --> 17:13.500
puts it, and making it more and more useful.

17:13.500 --> 17:17.460
I did a little digging before the show, and it looks like an Intel project that's this

17:17.460 --> 17:23.420
multi-headed bot that scans all the different branches of development of the Linux kernel,

17:23.420 --> 17:28.700
finds problems, and then when it does, it emails the mailing list, and when it doesn't

17:28.700 --> 17:33.000
find a problem, it then moves it along the testing stage to actually execute it and build

17:33.000 --> 17:36.600
on physical hardware, and then generates a whole other series of reports, and is doing

17:36.600 --> 17:38.140
this over and over again.

17:38.140 --> 17:41.860
I'm going to try to dig into it more, try to get links to the code, because I think

17:41.860 --> 17:47.020
the bot and all that stuff is open source, and I'll try to do a little mini-report in

17:47.020 --> 17:48.580
this week's Linux Unplugged.

17:48.580 --> 17:52.360
Well, ARM devices are definitely going to benefit from this long-term support kernel

17:52.360 --> 17:57.900
for six years, and ARM is something that Red Hat is seriously thinking about these days.

17:57.900 --> 18:01.640
This is Red Hat's first commercial support for ARM architecture.

18:01.640 --> 18:05.180
It's Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.4.

18:05.180 --> 18:11.160
Now they've been testing this for years, I think since like 2015 with a development preview,

18:11.160 --> 18:15.240
but now they're pretty much ready to say, okay, we're going to ship it, and we're going

18:15.240 --> 18:16.980
to support it for years.

18:16.980 --> 18:22.860
Hello world, and meet Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.4 for ARM devices, and the timing of this

18:22.860 --> 18:27.700
is pretty good, because there's recently been several large announcements, big announcements

18:27.700 --> 18:33.380
by Cray and Qualcomm for big server-grade systems with lots of ARM cores on there.

18:33.380 --> 18:35.320
We've been talking about it for years, haven't we?

18:35.320 --> 18:40.740
This idea of the data center moving to ARM, and now it seems to finally be happening.

18:40.740 --> 18:45.880
Everyone knows ARM chips have the advantage of lower power consumption and less heat output,

18:45.880 --> 18:49.720
but the other advantage is you can slice and dice how these cores are assigned, and you

18:49.720 --> 18:55.820
can purpose build applications for these cores, and you can stack a lot more of these ARM

18:55.820 --> 18:58.740
servers in a rack than you can x86 servers.

18:58.740 --> 19:03.820
It almost feels like this is inevitable, and Red Hat's trying to get there and offer an

19:03.820 --> 19:08.620
enterprise-grade product before it's too late in some cases, because there's other distributions

19:08.620 --> 19:12.740
that don't quite have that commercial enterprise prestige, but they've been there now for a

19:12.740 --> 19:13.740
while.

19:13.740 --> 19:15.460
Well, yeah, look at Canonical and Ubuntu.

19:15.460 --> 19:20.100
That's been available for ARM for a long time, so the question is why has Red Hat taken so

19:20.100 --> 19:21.100
long about this?

19:21.100 --> 19:22.380
I guess they took their time.

19:22.380 --> 19:27.060
They've been testing it since 2015, but the enterprise space isn't necessarily known for

19:27.060 --> 19:28.460
moving too fast.

19:28.460 --> 19:33.380
Yeah, I suppose a company the size of Canonical can kind of afford to be more agile and move

19:33.380 --> 19:38.060
more quickly, whereas Red Hat has to bide its time.

19:38.060 --> 19:43.380
I think it was a little bit overdue, but now they're seriously moving into this space.

19:43.380 --> 19:49.280
You know they would have tested it properly, and it feels like now is about the right time

19:49.280 --> 19:53.940
because we didn't really have the hardware for the data center before now, and now it's

19:53.940 --> 20:00.140
starting to appear with the Qualcomm staff, so they're probably spot on with their strategy.

20:00.140 --> 20:03.720
There's a reason they are the biggest Linux company, to be fair.

20:03.720 --> 20:07.780
On the total opposite end of the enterprise market, you have OnePlus.

20:07.780 --> 20:12.660
They move quick, and sometimes things slip through the cracks, and they're back in the

20:12.660 --> 20:16.860
news again with a pretty major backdoor.

20:16.860 --> 20:22.700
Yeah, Engineer Mode, which is an APK that they left on some builds of their operating

20:22.700 --> 20:29.460
system for their various devices that essentially allows root access over ADB.

20:29.460 --> 20:34.580
Now, it's not quite the big story that some people made it out to be because they were

20:34.580 --> 20:36.740
assuming that there'd be remote access here.

20:36.740 --> 20:41.460
No, the reality is that you need to have enabled USB debugging, and you need to have physical

20:41.460 --> 20:46.260
access to the device, which as we know, if you've got physical access to any computing

20:46.260 --> 20:48.540
device, all bets are off.

20:48.540 --> 20:51.820
But either way, this doesn't look good for them.

20:51.820 --> 20:55.920
This comes on the back of a couple of months ago, some metrics they were collecting that

20:55.920 --> 20:59.520
people weren't happy about.

20:59.520 --> 21:06.540
This is supposed to be a brand aimed at developer types, tinkerers, people who like custom ROMs,

21:06.540 --> 21:14.000
people who want low price hardware with good specs, geeky people, essentially.

21:14.000 --> 21:19.300
Not your Samsung users, the typical normals.

21:19.300 --> 21:21.800
They need to be careful with this stuff, really.

21:21.800 --> 21:25.340
Even if this turns out to be just incompetence, which to be honest, I think it is, I don't

21:25.340 --> 21:26.780
think there was any malice intended here.

21:26.780 --> 21:32.620
I think it was just debugging software that they forgot to remove.

21:32.620 --> 21:38.780
It's just not a good look for a brand which is associated with, well, people like us who

21:38.780 --> 21:40.700
like custom ROMs and stuff.

21:40.700 --> 21:45.220
There's three elements to this story that I find intriguing.

21:45.220 --> 21:50.680
Element number one is this is a diagnostic and testing application made by Qualcomm.

21:50.680 --> 21:55.060
It's not made by OnePlus, it's made by Qualcomm, and it's something they build for OEMs to

21:55.060 --> 21:59.940
easily test all hardware components of the device, and they just left it on the image

21:59.940 --> 22:03.700
of the OnePlus 3, OnePlus 3T, and the OnePlus 5.

22:03.700 --> 22:05.580
So that's element number one.

22:05.580 --> 22:12.460
Element number two, this quote unquote backdoor was discovered by a Twitter user who goes

22:12.460 --> 22:18.460
by the name Elliot Anderson, which those of you who are Mr. Robot fans may recognize that

22:18.460 --> 22:19.460
name.

22:19.460 --> 22:23.900
Element number three, this Elliot Anderson on Twitter discovered that there was a password

22:23.900 --> 22:29.100
needed by engineer mode in order to escalate the ADB privileges.

22:29.100 --> 22:33.220
And mind you, this is a password set by Qualcomm employees.

22:33.220 --> 22:36.180
And this is a Twitter account named Elliot Anderson.

22:36.180 --> 22:37.420
And the password?

22:37.420 --> 22:43.260
The password was Angela, which those of you that watch Mr. Robot will know that Angela

22:43.260 --> 22:45.980
is a relevant character in the Mr. Robot series.

22:45.980 --> 22:47.900
Yeah, Elliot's oldest friend.

22:47.900 --> 22:53.220
Right, so Qualcomm happens to have some Mr. Robot fans, and then the Twitter user outing

22:53.220 --> 22:57.380
this entire thing happens to have a Mr. Robot handle.

22:57.380 --> 23:02.100
It almost feels like an inside leak because there's no obvious source from where the password

23:02.100 --> 23:03.100
came.

23:03.100 --> 23:07.680
The leaker hasn't given that information, doesn't disclose where the password came from,

23:07.680 --> 23:09.840
just kind of figured it out and then tweeted it.

23:09.840 --> 23:13.140
But the curious thing is that Qualcomm denies any involvement.

23:13.140 --> 23:18.100
They say that it's based on some code they wrote, but it is so different at this point

23:18.100 --> 23:21.440
that they basically didn't write it.

23:21.440 --> 23:24.720
So the mystery gets even deeper.

23:24.720 --> 23:30.380
And then it gets even weirder that there's some other binaries on there that are basically

23:30.380 --> 23:35.320
collecting Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connection information and logging that.

23:35.320 --> 23:40.800
But functionally, this just turns out to be a big bonus for owners of these OnePlus phones,

23:40.800 --> 23:46.340
because it's almost impossible to execute this thing remotely.

23:46.340 --> 23:50.500
And you have to implicitly turn on USB debugging on your phone.

23:50.500 --> 23:57.540
So really, OnePlus 3, 3T, and 5 owners can now get root access without ever having to

23:57.540 --> 23:58.540
unlock their phone.

23:58.540 --> 24:01.060
They just got a simple way to root their devices.

24:01.060 --> 24:03.140
That's the functional aspect to the story.

24:03.140 --> 24:06.780
Yeah, without having to wipe all the data that goes along with unlocking the bootloader,

24:06.780 --> 24:07.780
which is nice for some people.

24:07.780 --> 24:10.900
I mean, it's the first thing I do, so it doesn't really bother me.

24:10.900 --> 24:16.980
And as a OnePlus 3T owner, I'm not affected by any of this, because I'm running lineage.

24:16.980 --> 24:20.860
But yeah, there's a kind of silver lining to all of this, isn't there?

24:20.860 --> 24:21.860
Yeah, I think so.

24:21.860 --> 24:24.980
If I was an owner of one of these devices, I'd jump on this right now before they pushed

24:24.980 --> 24:27.620
out an update to remove this thing.

24:27.620 --> 24:28.620
Yeah.

24:28.620 --> 24:33.660
But it just kind of goes to show how shady the whole OEM version of Android thing is.

24:33.660 --> 24:35.740
They all have their own stuff baked into it.

24:35.740 --> 24:37.860
And you just got no idea what's going on.

24:37.860 --> 24:40.580
And I honestly don't think there's any malice here.

24:40.580 --> 24:42.380
I think it's just incompetence.

24:42.380 --> 24:45.540
I think they've just left stuff on there that they shouldn't have done.

24:45.540 --> 24:48.560
And people are just not doing their jobs properly.

24:48.560 --> 24:49.780
And same with the logging stuff.

24:49.780 --> 24:54.420
I don't really think they've got a massive interest in collecting user data.

24:54.420 --> 24:56.100
It's just sloppy development.

24:56.100 --> 25:01.700
And it just goes to show, man, if you run in proprietary software or software with huge

25:01.700 --> 25:05.220
proprietary elements to it, you just can't trust what's going on with it.

25:05.220 --> 25:09.020
So just lineage all the way for me, thank you very much.

25:09.020 --> 25:10.660
Sloppy and incompetent.

25:10.660 --> 25:14.980
Just the aspects you want from your phone vendor that really inspires confidence.

25:14.980 --> 25:17.340
But I suppose you only learn by doing.

25:17.340 --> 25:21.860
The OnePlus 5T, I think was just announced, I had to be honest, yo, it looks like a pretty

25:21.860 --> 25:23.140
good phone.

25:23.140 --> 25:27.620
But it does give me a little bit of pause because this is the second story in less than

25:27.620 --> 25:29.460
a month for them.

25:29.460 --> 25:30.460
Yeah.

25:30.460 --> 25:34.100
It's funny, you're the second iPhone user that has said to me they're tempted by the

25:34.100 --> 25:38.420
5T with its six inch display and it's all looking pretty good.

25:38.420 --> 25:44.860
But I'm a couple of versions behind now and I'm happy enough with the 3T.

25:44.860 --> 25:47.860
If I was going to suggest a phone to anyone, it'd be that 3T.

25:47.860 --> 25:48.860
It's a great phone.

25:48.860 --> 25:53.100
It's got the fingerprint reader and everything, first class lineage support.

25:53.100 --> 25:56.100
You don't really need this new phone as far as I'm concerned.

25:56.100 --> 25:59.600
But if I had all the money in the world, I'd seriously consider it.

25:59.600 --> 26:02.700
It's nice to see something taking on that Nexus line.

26:02.700 --> 26:08.420
When the Pixel came out and the Nexus line ended, the Pixel was considerably more expensive

26:08.420 --> 26:10.940
and it makes me less inclined to want to tinker with it.

26:10.940 --> 26:14.980
It makes it less of a community supported phone because they're so expensive.

26:14.980 --> 26:18.020
And the OnePlus phones have really kind of stepped up to that role.

26:18.020 --> 26:22.340
So I hope they sort all this out because I think long term, they'd probably be the Android

26:22.340 --> 26:23.540
phone of choice for myself.

26:23.540 --> 26:26.660
