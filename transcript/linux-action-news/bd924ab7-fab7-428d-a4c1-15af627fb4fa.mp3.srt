00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,020
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, episode 217, recorded on November 28th, 2021.

2
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:10,020
I'm Chris.

3
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:11,020
And I'm Wes.

4
00:00:11,020 --> 00:00:12,020
Hello, Wes.

5
00:00:12,020 --> 00:00:13,020
Let's do the news.

6
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:17,380
And we start this week with what might just end up the first RISC-V powered phone you'll

7
00:00:17,380 --> 00:00:21,580
be able to catch your hands on, and it could be just around the corner.

8
00:00:21,580 --> 00:00:26,460
With Linux support nearly complete for several RISC-V chipsets, and an increasing quantity

9
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:32,080
of chips powering Linux single board computers with prices as low as $12, RISC-V seems to

10
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:34,960
be entering a new phase of maturation.

11
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:39,660
With this next phase comes the next major challenge, though, turning us all into an

12
00:00:39,660 --> 00:01:09,600
ecosystem for both developers and product builders.

13
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:12,560
And Android support is finally getting in much better shape.

14
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:17,060
It was helped definitely by later versions of Android tracking much closer to the mainline

15
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:21,240
Linux kernel, which has improved its RISC-V support a lot in recent years.

16
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:25,320
Alibaba has also been one of the first to produce a working Android 10 port over to

17
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:29,840
the RISC-V architecture, complete even with GPU drivers.

18
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:36,200
But this week, leading RISC-V manufacturer SySpeed demoed a full Android 10 system on

19
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:38,140
a seven inch touchscreen.

20
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:41,320
This was building off some of their work last year when SySpeed produced the smartphone

21
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:47,180
like my ex amigo development kit as the first experiment for free hardware PDA.

22
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:51,880
One part development kit, one part learning kit, I guess you could say it was a fairly

23
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:58,200
robust looking device and not all that impressive spec wise, but an early RISC device nonetheless.

24
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:03,200
And you could easily see them putting something like that together, but maybe version two

25
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:06,940
is powered by a RISC-V chip in there.

26
00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:12,100
And supply chain shortages, aside from what I'm reading, all of the bits are really there.

27
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:15,340
They just need to put it all together in a mobile dev kit now.

28
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:19,360
And according to SySpeed, a RISC-V device like this, like a little phone or learning

29
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:24,460
kit would be more powerful than like a quad core A73 ARM processor.

30
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:29,960
So possibly in line with Qualcomm Snapdragon 663 or 662 SoCs.

31
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:35,080
We'll keep our ears on the party line and give you a ring if a RISC-V Linux phone comes

32
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:36,580
a call on.

33
00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:43,220
But while we're speaking of super cheap RISC-V devices, measuring just 46 by 25 millimeters

34
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:51,020
in the style of a Pi compute module, the all-winner D1 packs a one gigahertz CPU and 512 megs

35
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:55,260
of DDR3 RAM, all for just $17.

36
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:59,340
Just like a first glance looking at this thing, it looks like a stick of RAM.

37
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:04,520
Like a laptop, small size stick of RAM with just a few extra bits on it.

38
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:09,140
They're designed to slot right into a docking board that will have additional connectivity.

39
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:12,620
Maybe like HDMI, Ethernet, and GPIO pins, etc.

40
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:16,740
But I like to take these things to like an extreme version, maybe that's years down the

41
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:17,740
road.

42
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:22,620
And I picture a blade server with like 300 of these things.

43
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:26,840
And they're all installed inside this one larger box integrated into some sort of high

44
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:31,700
speed backplane, making it like a ginormous Beowulf cluster in a box.

45
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:35,940
I don't like where you're going with this, but they've actually got to ship these things

46
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:36,940
first.

47
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:41,780
Thankfully, though, the D1 is available now on AliExpress, and those docking boards are

48
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:46,940
supposed to start shipping within the next month or so.

49
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:50,980
It's a holiday week here in the States, and so there's not a lot of breaking news in the

50
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:52,940
Linux and open source community.

51
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:57,220
But there actually have been a few essential developments we wanted you to be aware of.

52
00:03:57,220 --> 00:04:02,860
In the background, for years, the LLVM project has been working on a massive relicensing

53
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:04,020
effort for its code base.

54
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:07,580
And we wanted to bring it to your attention this week because a there's been some developments,

55
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:12,620
but be LLVM is a critical part of the open source ecosystem.

56
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:14,340
So we just wanted to keep you apprised.

57
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:18,100
No, it's not the latest and greatest virtual machine manager.

58
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:21,180
In fact, LLVM is not even an acronym.

59
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:26,480
It's just the name of the project, which is a collection of modular and reusable compiler

60
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:32,020
and tool chain technologies, been around now for 18 years, and started off as a research

61
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:37,540
project at the University of Illinois, created by Chris Latner, initially focused on C and

62
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:40,980
C++, but built the language agnostic design.

63
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:47,180
Yeah, that modular and language agnostic design turned out to be a huge asset for the project.

64
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:49,900
And today, it's just enormous.

65
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:52,660
And it's not just in the open source community.

66
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:57,860
LLVM has been an integral part of Apple's Xcode development tools for macOS and iOS

67
00:04:57,860 --> 00:04:59,460
since Xcode four.

68
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:05,300
And this week, we got an update on their effort to relicense to what effectively will be an

69
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:08,940
Apache 2.0 license but with an LLVM exception.

70
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:13,460
That exception is just dealing with your code being compiled by LLVM as well as when pairing

71
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:16,940
LLVM code with the GPL version two.

72
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:21,980
Currently LLVM is published under the University of Illinois slash NCSA open source license,

73
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:26,540
which is based on the MIT or X11 and three clause BSD licenses.

74
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:28,260
Okay, got it.

75
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:33,660
But to make this transition to Apache to clean, they need to collect the contributor signatures,

76
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:37,260
the people that have contributed to the code over the years.

77
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:42,180
And surprise, surprise, that is the sticky point right now, the LLVM Foundation has managed

78
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:47,820
to get approval for more than 94% of the older code base and they're getting really close,

79
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:54,300
but they need 100% to legally relicense it to Apache to a Google spreadsheet is being

80
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:58,540
used to sort all this out and keep track of who they still need to communicate with so

81
00:05:58,540 --> 00:05:59,540
far.

82
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:02,340
We'll have a link to that in the show notes.

83
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:06,700
The hope with this whole license change effort is to clear up the patent section of their

84
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:11,460
former license that led to some unfortunate confusion and organizations not contributing

85
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:15,900
to the project, as well as getting the runtime libraries and the rest of the code under the

86
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:23,460
same unified license and clearing up the wording on the patent rights.

87
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:29,020
In the land of farmers and fishermen in the northern German state of Schleswig-Holstein,

88
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:36,380
there is work afoot to switch 25,000 PCs to LibreOffice.

89
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:41,420
The state wants to reduce its dependence on proprietary software and eventually end it

90
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:42,420
all together.

91
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:47,860
Yeah, the goal is by the end of 2026 to have replaced Microsoft Office with LibreOffice

92
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:53,820
on all those 25,000 computers used by civil servants and other government employees, including

93
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:54,820
teachers.

94
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:58,180
Yeah, so that seems to kind of be like a phase one, and they're entertaining the idea of

95
00:06:58,180 --> 00:07:04,700
a phase two if that goes well, which would be switch the OSs from Windows to Linux.

96
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:12,380
Now, I know some of us long timers are getting a solid sense of deja vu here, but I am encouraged

97
00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:15,340
by a few lessons that they seem to be applying here.

98
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:20,580
One of the big ones is they're switching the applications first, getting the users familiar

99
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:25,100
with the very same applications they would end up using on Linux before switching out

100
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:26,300
the OS.

101
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:27,940
Change the apps, then the platform.

102
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:32,400
Yeah, I mean, that cuts the learning curve in half and is leveraging one of the great

103
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:33,940
things about LibreOffice, right?

104
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:35,500
It runs everywhere.

105
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:37,740
That seems like a good thing to me.

106
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:41,460
Another good sign that stood out is that they're not trying to do this just to save money.

107
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:45,860
They're doing this to break out of a dependent vendor relationship, not even trying to do

108
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:47,820
the transition on the cheap, which is good.

109
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:50,820
It means you're actually willing to spend the money to try to make something like this

110
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:51,820
effective.

111
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:56,500
Additionally, it seems to me in conjunction with broader thinking about the government's

112
00:07:56,500 --> 00:08:01,780
use of open source and selecting services and software that support multiple operating

113
00:08:01,780 --> 00:08:02,780
systems.

114
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:03,780
Yep.

115
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:08,900
These are some of the changes that they're implementing compared to how Munich did it

116
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:14,580
a decade ago that do make me want to be more positive.

117
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:19,300
So that's nice to see, but what's underneath a lot of this is a new motivator, which I

118
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:20,300
think is fascinating.

119
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:24,540
So it's like before it was let's save money by using free software, but now the motivator

120
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:27,820
seems to be more like we don't want to be locked into a vendor.

121
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:32,220
And we're seeing this time and time again now, this theme for businesses and for governments

122
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:35,460
is they don't want vendor lock-in.

123
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:37,700
And that is a difference.

124
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:38,700
I don't know.

125
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:40,580
I can't help but be slightly skeptical.

126
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:44,860
It was rough watching Munich over a decade just blow this thing where there were bad

127
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:45,860
choices.

128
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:47,320
You know, they rolled their own distro.

129
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:49,500
There were politics.

130
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:55,160
There were like Wolf of Wall Street style moves by Microsoft that really torpedoed this really

131
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:57,020
public Linux switch.

132
00:08:57,020 --> 00:08:59,540
So it was really hard to watch that.

133
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:00,940
But yeah, I agree, Wes.

134
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:05,660
They seem to be taking a better, probably more practical strategy with it.

135
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:10,060
Well, here's hoping the fishermen and farmers will have a better go at it anyway.

136
00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:13,980
And whenever government time and money is invested into free software, even if only

137
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:17,900
temporarily, users all around the world benefit together.

138
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:20,220
And that's great.

139
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:21,940
Linode.com slash LAN.

140
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:23,860
That's where we host everything up in the cloud.

141
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:27,300
And I started using Linode before they were a sponsor because they had the best price

142
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:28,680
to performance.

143
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:30,580
They had a great interface.

144
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:34,980
And I could tell after using it for a little bit, they were really Linux geeks and it was

145
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:38,460
influencing the product in an absolutely great way.

146
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:41,660
Now we're rounding into our second year of working with Linode.

147
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:46,200
And it's been absolutely enabling for us as an independent business to not only survive

148
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:50,060
because they are a fantastic client, but also they are where we run everything.

149
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:52,460
We still choose to deploy everything in Linode.

150
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:54,460
It gives us that fast performance.

151
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:59,700
It gives us locations near you because they have 11 data centers around the world.

152
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:01,940
They have the best API out there.

153
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:05,020
It truly is a developer owned company.

154
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:07,980
They have a 99.99% SLA.

155
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:09,940
They're ready to work in a multi cloud environment.

156
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:14,500
And when you compare Linode pricing, performance and features against the hypervisors that

157
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:18,460
want to lock you into their proprietary platforms, Linode crushes it.

158
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:20,580
The independent parties have verified it.

159
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:22,540
Linode is the fastest provider out there.

160
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:25,140
And especially when you look at price and performance.

161
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:29,220
But they have brand new AMD EPYC dedicated CPU rigs if you want to go that way.

162
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:31,980
They're rolling out new MVME storage to their systems.

163
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:33,900
And of course, they're $5 systems.

164
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:37,380
They're like budget focused systems are still incredibly powerful.

165
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:42,580
I use that now for game servers and sync thing and all that all running on one $5 Linode.

166
00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:47,980
They really do stack up to the competition and I acknowledge there is a lot of ways to

167
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:49,540
host something.

168
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:52,460
But nobody does it like Linode, nobody.

169
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:56,380
And on top of all of that, they have the best customer support in the business.

170
00:10:56,380 --> 00:10:59,660
By phone, ticket or social, they're gonna help you, they're gonna take care of any problem

171
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:00,660
you have.

172
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:02,080
And that means you can rest easy at night.

173
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:05,460
And I do knowing that because that's where my business infrastructure runs.

174
00:11:05,460 --> 00:11:09,740
So go build something, go try something, go test something, push it to the limit, see

175
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:13,860
what you can get and really kick the tires because Linode is going to give you $100 when

176
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:16,620
you go to linode.com slash LAN.

177
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:21,260
Go there to get that $100 in CCD credit on a new account and you support the show.

178
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:22,260
It's a great deal.

179
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:23,980
It's a great opportunity.

180
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:27,700
Linode.com slash LAN.

181
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:32,380
Linux.ting.com and thanks to Ting for making this episode of Linux Action News possible.

182
00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:38,280
Ting is my cell service of choice since 2013 and the trick is that Ting is an MVNO.

183
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:41,920
So they're a virtual operator that runs on top of multiple carriers and they can focus

184
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:46,380
on great deals and great customer service, not digging holes in the ground.

185
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:51,780
So you get great connectivity and speed on LTE or 5G networks across the nation.

186
00:11:51,780 --> 00:11:53,780
And Ting has plans as low as $10 a month.

187
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:55,860
You can dial in the plan that works just for you.

188
00:11:55,860 --> 00:12:00,220
A lot of data, a little data, unlimited calls, unlimited texts, you pick.

189
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:05,340
Every plan has access to Ting's award-winning customer service and nationwide LTE and 5G.

190
00:12:05,340 --> 00:12:08,220
Plus the freedom of no contracts ever.

191
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:09,220
Boom.

192
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:12,280
Ting's been leading the industry on that.

193
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:15,980
And the nice thing is it's so simple to switch to Ting, which means you can start saving

194
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:17,380
money right away.

195
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:18,940
Pretty much any phone's going to work.

196
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:22,780
Just head to linux.ting.com, check out your current phone, create an account and pick

197
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:23,960
the plan that's right for you.

198
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:25,020
They're going to have one.

199
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:28,600
Once everything checks out and Ting figures out exactly where your best service is going

200
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:30,300
to be at, they'll send you a SIM card.

201
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:34,100
You pop that into your phone and you get activated in minutes.

202
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:35,640
It's a great way to get started.

203
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:39,540
And then from then on, you're going to find just about everything you want in the dashboard.

204
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:44,860
A customer since 2013, I've called customer service twice, both times because I was doing

205
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:49,580
something crazy on a road trip and they stuck with me.

206
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:50,580
They really did stick with me.

207
00:12:50,580 --> 00:12:52,740
I had a great experience and you will too.

208
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:58,140
So get started and save $25 when you go to linux.ting.com that's right linux.ting.com

209
00:12:58,140 --> 00:13:05,560
see how much you could save and then take 25 bucks off that linux.ting.com

210
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:09,580
Something rather big happened this week in the world of Linux and specifically Linux

211
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:15,380
distributions, but you'd be easily forgiven if you didn't happen to notice.

212
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:22,320
Amazon announced the release of Amazon Linux 2022 and well not typically a big event.

213
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:25,100
This time things are a bit different.

214
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:30,060
One of the major changes being that Amazon has rebased their Linux operating system on

215
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:31,060
Fedora.

216
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:36,680
That's a bit of a hybrid actually between select bits of Red Hat Enterprise Linux and

217
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:39,180
a whole lot of that Fedora goodness.

218
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:41,820
Now isn't that interesting thoughts on that in a moment.

219
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:47,900
But what I noticed is Amazon seems to casually refer to this as AL 2022 and in the release

220
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:53,940
notes they noticed that quote AL 2022 uses the Fedora project as its upstream to provide

221
00:13:53,940 --> 00:14:00,100
customers with a wide variety of the latest software such as uploaded language runtimes

222
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:02,620
as part of quarterly releases.

223
00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:11,420
In addition AL 2022 has SE Linux enabled and enforced by default.

224
00:14:11,420 --> 00:14:15,820
Little round of a quiet applause there because I think that's really great on systems that

225
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:17,580
are built for cloud workloads.

226
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:22,300
Some other things that they're baking into their distribution include live kernel patching,

227
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:26,260
extra kernel hardening they have details about that on the GitHub and they're basing it all

228
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:29,940
on the 5.15 LTS kernel.

229
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:32,900
And then there's the support window.

230
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:37,100
Amazon is recommitting to major versions of the operating system every two years with

231
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:40,140
five years of long term support.

232
00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:45,880
And much like Red Hat or Ubuntu but a bit abbreviated, there are two phases of support.

233
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:49,660
Each release consists of standard support for two years and then a further three years

234
00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:51,500
of maintenance support.

235
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:55,780
Each release receives quarterly minor version updates to provide security updates, bug fixes

236
00:14:55,780 --> 00:14:58,420
and perhaps new features.

237
00:14:58,420 --> 00:15:02,340
Yeah, that new features thing is going to be interesting to see how customers react

238
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:04,180
to that long term.

239
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:09,380
Because that combined with a Fedora base seems to really position this thing as aggressively

240
00:15:09,380 --> 00:15:10,380
close to upstream.

241
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:14,940
I mean, this is pretty fresh for an enterprise distro quote unquote.

242
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:20,420
And Amazon I think recognizes this in in their announcements and on their GitHub, they tout

243
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:25,580
repository locking as an option for those that want something maybe a little less aggressive,

244
00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:30,920
writing on their GitHub quote, Amazon Linux 2022 gives customers control over how and

245
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:37,140
when they choose updates and provides the ability to lock major and minor versions,

246
00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:41,160
as well as specific versions of your Amazon Linux repository.

247
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:46,500
This enables you to ensure consistency of package versions and updates across your environment.

248
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:51,220
I've got to be honest that when I'm choosing an OS to run on the cloud, it's not usually

249
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:52,220
Amazon Linux.

250
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:55,580
And of course, that's where you're going to see their distribution running on their cloud

251
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:58,260
and AC two instances in particular.

252
00:15:58,260 --> 00:16:02,100
But it's so neat to see a new distribution come out that's based on Fedora.

253
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:03,980
We just don't see that very often.

254
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:08,540
I do agree that this seems perhaps aggressively upstream for the enterprise.

255
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:12,100
But that's kind of exciting, because a lot of these sort of server districts have felt

256
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:15,760
so stale for a long time that you maybe you chose something like a month or because it

257
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:20,100
felt like it changed a little bit more often, just a little more fresh flavor.

258
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:23,660
If you didn't need the years of support in a lockdown system.

259
00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:28,200
In some ways, it feels like Amazon's kind of trying out a new approach and a new part

260
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:29,200
on the spectrum.

261
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:34,660
Yeah, yeah, it's, it's a little more aggressive than say, going with sent off stream, because

262
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:40,620
it's closer to that fedora base where stream is going to be a little more reserved, a little

263
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:43,680
more careful in those updates.

264
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:48,300
And so it's kind of sitting between that between fedora and between sent off stream.

265
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:50,820
That's interesting, and would normally not be enough.

266
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:54,540
But then you come in and say, Oh, by the way, five years of support to which has always

267
00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:58,460
been the Achilles heel of running fedora in production, and no one wants to upgrade those

268
00:16:58,460 --> 00:16:59,620
every nine months or so.

269
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:04,980
But the other thing that's just casually nice about having a fedora server is you understand

270
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:09,440
fedora 34 as a base or fedora 35, which is what they're ultimately shooting for.

271
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:15,980
That as a base means XYZ features as a developer to build on in perhaps a sign of the times.

272
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:18,980
It feels like they're almost leading this announcement with their arm release.

273
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:23,040
I mean, yeah, sure, there's x86 as well, of course, but they're being quite prominent

274
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:25,980
that those new processors running arm of theirs in their data centers.

275
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:28,900
Yeah, of course, al 22 is going to be great on there.

276
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:33,460
Yeah, it really is sort of the ultimate Amazon fantasy stack.

277
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:39,900
You get you get an Amazon instance with an Amazon ARM processor running Amazon Linux,

278
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:40,900
the whole thing.

279
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:43,780
It's, I could see it working really well for some people.

280
00:17:43,780 --> 00:17:47,780
But this would be a lot more exciting to me if these eventually released as ISOs that

281
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:51,100
I could install on any x86 or ARM system.

282
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:52,540
No sign of that just yet.

283
00:17:52,540 --> 00:17:53,540
But we'll keep an eye on it.

284
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:55,780
If it does happen, we'll let you know and we'll let you know about anything else that

285
00:17:55,780 --> 00:17:58,560
happens in the world of Linux and open source.
