00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,360
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, our weekly take on Linux and the open-source world.

2
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:20,960
This is episode 104, recorded on May 5th, 2019.

3
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:21,960
I'm Chris.

4
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:22,960
And I'm Joe.

5
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:23,960
Hello, Joe.

6
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:26,280
Good to be connected with you on a very busy news week.

7
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:30,080
Let's kick things off with the brand new Fedora 30 release.

8
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:34,440
Yeah, no more cloud edition that's been merged with server, which seems quite logical to

9
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:35,440
me.

10
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:38,560
The workstation is GNOME 3.32.

11
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:40,640
And you've been running this for a little while, haven't you?

12
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:43,900
Yeah, I gave it a go on both the server side.

13
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:48,760
We have a pretty important server here at the network that runs on Fedora.

14
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:52,680
We decided let's put our money where our mouth is, essentially, and really see how long you

15
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:55,520
can run Fedora in a real production environment.

16
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:58,880
Granted, a lot of the applications and whatnot are in containers.

17
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:02,800
But we did an upgrade from 29 to 30, and it worked flawlessly.

18
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:07,880
And I've been running the XFCE spin of Fedora on my laptop.

19
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:10,080
And no surprise, I love it.

20
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:12,600
It's really been extremely fast.

21
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:15,860
That's not to shortchange the GNOME 3.32 release.

22
00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:17,560
It is a fantastic release.

23
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:21,160
If you're a GNOME Shell fan, it's worth the upgrade all on its own.

24
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:26,640
Performance-wise, it has a lot of improvements, I think the actual performance crown still

25
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:30,840
not quite going to Fedora these days, but it's still a great release of GNOME Shell.

26
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:36,840
Plus, you got the new Bash in there, you got GCC 9, and from a community standpoint, there's

27
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:39,320
another big change with Fedora 30.

28
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:45,460
They're moving their Ask Fedora support form to the discourse platform with this release

29
00:01:45,460 --> 00:01:46,460
of Fedora.

30
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:47,460
So that's a big shift too.

31
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:49,640
So you've got that merger of those server additions.

32
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:54,540
You got changes on the community side, and you've got a super up-to-date, high-performance

33
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:56,400
workstation edition.

34
00:01:56,400 --> 00:02:02,000
Top to bottom in every level of the project, they're really executing on this release.

35
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I've been really happy with Fedora 30.

36
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,320
Well, he gave it a very thorough going over in tomorrow's LUP, which has to record early

37
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:11,360
because you're off to the Red Hat Summit.

38
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:15,720
It's messing with my mind, all this past and future, but it's well worth checking that

39
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:16,720
out.

40
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:20,840
So just briefly, the workstation edition, and I can see those performance improvements.

41
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:25,160
I decided to put it on my lowest performing system, which is an old Chromebook with two

42
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:28,720
gigabytes of RAM, and it seemed to work absolutely fine on there.

43
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:33,200
I won't go into too many details because I really just go on about it in LUP 300.

44
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:39,880
But I'll say this, if you haven't tried Fedora for a while, 30 is a really well-executed

45
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:40,880
release.

46
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:47,120
There's gonna be a time in Fedora's history just very recently where it was maybe advisable

47
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:51,720
to wait about a month after a Fedora release to kick the tires, wait for software to catch

48
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:52,720
up and whatnot.

49
00:02:52,720 --> 00:03:00,160
I would say they have figured that problem out between flat packs and copper and really

50
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:04,720
just the things they're bundling with the distribution like drivers and other things

51
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:06,080
that used to be harder to get.

52
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:09,120
It is perfectly usable on launch day.

53
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:13,720
And I used to never say that about a Fedora release, so that's an accomplishment on its

54
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:14,720
own.

55
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:19,660
We really are spoiled for choice now, aren't we, with Ubuntu 19.04 and Fedora 30.

56
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:24,160
No matter which way you wanna go, you're gonna get a rock-solid distro with the latest version

57
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:26,600
of GNOME that's just gonna work for you.

58
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:27,600
Yeah, absolutely.

59
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:29,240
You wanna talk about being spoiled for choice.

60
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:32,500
You thought we had a lot of choice when it comes to distros.

61
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:34,040
How about services?

62
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:38,440
There are more services than I think Bill Gates could afford to pay for these days.

63
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:44,480
Well, I'm sure he was first in the queue for Librem One, which is Purism's new set of services,

64
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:51,040
which are definitely not just a bunch of rebadged software sold back to people or anything.

65
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:53,520
Actually that is exactly what they are.

66
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:55,520
Librem Chat is Riot.

67
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:57,760
Librem Chat on iOS is also Riot.

68
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:59,980
Librem Social is Tusky.

69
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:03,380
Librem Social is Amarok on iOS.

70
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:06,180
Librem Mail is rebadged K9.

71
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:09,640
Librem Tunnel is a rebadged VPN iOS open source app.

72
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:12,520
And for Android, it's a rebadge of ICS open VPN.

73
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:17,560
But there's nothing inherently wrong with that as a concept, because they're charging

74
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:19,520
people to use a service.

75
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:23,240
You have to run a server and manage all of that stuff.

76
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:26,920
And the whole point of free and open source software is you can do what you want with

77
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:28,560
it, like start services.

78
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,080
Yeah, I agree.

79
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:36,160
But taking the logos and just rebranding them, I don't know, it kind of looks a bit cheap

80
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,160
to me.

81
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:42,560
Well, I think maybe not being implicitly upfront about that and maybe not coming right out

82
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:48,560
and saying and leading with a story about contribution and how you'll be working upstream

83
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:54,900
and launching the service with that language instead of sort of scrambling after the fact

84
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:58,920
when everybody notices that these are really well known apps that have just been white

85
00:04:58,920 --> 00:04:59,920
labeled.

86
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:03,920
But something that is far more concerning than that is the fact that they're doing this

87
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:10,800
as a crowd funder for a service that is ongoing and going to give them ongoing revenue.

88
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,800
Why do they need to do a crowd funder here?

89
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:21,600
Well, because by contributing to purism, you are making the world a better place, according

90
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,600
to Todd.

91
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:23,600
All right.

92
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:24,600
Okay.

93
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,760
And that is that's if you read through their website, I've read through everything.

94
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:28,560
That is essentially it.

95
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:32,480
And that's also they're helping the world by putting these under a centralized brand.

96
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:37,360
You see, purism is making things better by putting all of these services under a brand

97
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,120
that we can all trust.

98
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:43,720
They write on their blog even, we make these decentralized services just as convenient

99
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:46,440
to use as big tech alternatives.

100
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:51,160
That way the end user doesn't have to know what matrix is, activity pub or even what

101
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:52,400
IMAP is.

102
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,180
They can just use their applications.

103
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:56,240
And that's a pretty solid argument.

104
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:58,720
And I can completely understand why they'd want to do that.

105
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:05,120
And I really like the idea of having the option to subscribe to services that are competitive

106
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:10,100
with a lot of commercial offerings from a company that I trust, and that I believe really

107
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:12,440
does respect my privacy.

108
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:16,600
And I will give purism one thing, I believe they do respect my privacy.

109
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:17,600
Really?

110
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:20,280
Because I couldn't see a privacy policy on any of this.

111
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:22,200
You read through it all, did you?

112
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:23,200
That's true.

113
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,200
I couldn't find one.

114
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,760
I did want to link to it in the show notes.

115
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:26,760
And I couldn't dig one up.

116
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:33,540
I also, I thought from your perspective too, I couldn't find anything about GDPR regulations

117
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:36,880
or rules that they're following or any kind of GDPR disclosures.

118
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:39,680
I would think because it's a worldwide service, that's required too.

119
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:44,160
Well, yeah, if you're offering it to anyone in the EU, then you have to do that.

120
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,520
So that seems like a bit of an oversight.

121
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:51,040
I mean, you would hope that that will be coming soon, but it just feels a bit hastily put

122
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:57,440
together, this, and when you combine that with the recent layoffs that they've done,

123
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:00,400
it doesn't inspire a huge amount of confidence, I must say.

124
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:03,560
It's hard to tell with these kinds of things, but I also have the impression of sort of

125
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:10,560
a hasty throw together, which combined with yet another crowd fundraiser, having participated

126
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:15,400
in previous ones, just feels like another grab.

127
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:19,800
And you do wonder if maybe there's some sustainability issues.

128
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:22,240
I can see the bigger picture they're going for here.

129
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:26,360
They're going for a complete services integration with their laptops, the phones, they're trying

130
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:29,360
to give people on other OSs alternatives.

131
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:30,900
I like that.

132
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:38,080
But the lack of a clear, well accessible privacy policy, the lack of a clear, detailed layout

133
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:42,220
of where the server's at and where I can trust that they're secure and private, telling me

134
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:44,000
you respect my privacy is good.

135
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,440
That's a good very, very first step, especially if that's your true intention.

136
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:51,720
However, it has to be followed up, especially when you're pitching to this kind of market,

137
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:55,000
it has to be followed up with details and information.

138
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,680
Amazon has to do it, Google has to do it, there has to be some information about your

139
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:02,960
data center management policy, its security, where the data is stored, all of that.

140
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:08,120
People have to make informed decisions, especially consumers that are buying this kind of product.

141
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:10,720
And the GDPR is an issue here.

142
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,600
None of these items were addressed.

143
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:13,600
Why?

144
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:14,600
I'll tell you why.

145
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:16,780
Because they've never done services before.

146
00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:19,640
Because it's harder to do services than people realize.

147
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:24,840
It takes more work and more effort than people who've never done it before can appreciate.

148
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:27,960
As right on point, you can see they kind of were a little sloppy.

149
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:28,960
They didn't wait.

150
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:29,960
They rushed.

151
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:34,160
One of the applications they shipped out on day one was affected by a rather nasty security

152
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:35,240
bug.

153
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:39,240
And it was simply an issue because they were rebranding an upstream application that had

154
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:40,700
a bug.

155
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:42,440
And that shipped to end users.

156
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:44,920
Now, perhaps they can learn.

157
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:47,960
Perhaps they can become a services company.

158
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:52,480
But then I have to wonder what a small company with limited resources does if that becomes

159
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:56,820
their primary revenue source and they're still working on shipping the Librem 5.

160
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:58,760
They're stretching themselves quite thin.

161
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:00,540
And so that brings me to my last concern.

162
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:06,560
Even if they could learn and become a services company that had a great staff and a large

163
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:12,720
support infrastructure that could provide support to people, does that rob from their

164
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:15,320
initiative to build the Librem 5?

165
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:18,580
Because they are limited in obviously funds because they've just gone through a round

166
00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:19,600
of layoffs.

167
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:22,780
They had to do a yet another fundraiser.

168
00:09:22,780 --> 00:09:26,920
They have limited staff that's going to have to learn up really quick to do this completely

169
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:27,920
well.

170
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:31,080
Oh, and by the way, they're still trying to topple Android at the same time.

171
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:33,520
What do you think about the pricing for this then?

172
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:36,520
Well, it's, you know, I think reasonable.

173
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:37,520
Really.

174
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:42,440
I mean, when you consider that the alternative is a company that's also tracking you constantly

175
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:47,040
or one that charges you thousands of dollars for hardware, the Librem 1 for an individual

176
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:50,200
is $7.99 US greenbacks per month.

177
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:56,720
They also offer a family pack for $14.99 US greenbacks.

178
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:01,240
Is that a lot for what equates to be rebranding of open source software?

179
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:02,660
I say no.

180
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:04,580
In my opinion, it's fair pricing.

181
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:09,760
They're taking valuable software, they're providing infrastructure and support for it,

182
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:13,120
and they're packaging it and delivering it in a consumable way to end users.

183
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:15,920
I think $8 a month is actually a pretty good deal.

184
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:18,320
I think they've nailed the pricing.

185
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:24,240
The issue is I just don't have a lot of faith that they're the company to offer these kind

186
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,880
of services.

187
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:29,940
It's just a whole nother game than building laptops or phones.

188
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:34,920
You could roll all of this yourself because it's all open source software for $5 a month

189
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:42,000
on a digital ocean droplet, which does make $8 a month seem a bit expensive, but it's

190
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,760
an awful lot of effort to do that.

191
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:48,420
If they could pull this off properly, then that extra few dollars is nothing really.

192
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:52,080
It just comes down to whether or not they can deliver what they're promising, which

193
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:53,760
is a hugely tall order.

194
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:58,600
Well, and picture it also as a potential value add to Librem 5 down the road.

195
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:03,000
They'd have to create applications for their own OS because ironically, they don't have

196
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,320
any rebranded pure OS apps.

197
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:10,240
You could just go use Riot and whatnot, so they'd have to make some apps for their own

198
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:14,600
operating system, but if they did, you could kind of see an overall services tie-in.

199
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:19,680
But also, I would normally kind of give you a hard time right here and I'd say, oh, Joe,

200
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:24,060
you always claim it's so easy for somebody to just go stand up a website on digital ocean.

201
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:25,400
People need their handheld.

202
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:29,000
They want to click a button and have the service, and I think that's generally true.

203
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:34,080
That's why things like WhatsApp and Telegram and Slack are so damn popular because they're

204
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:35,640
a few clicks away and you've got it.

205
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:38,120
No server setup needed.

206
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:42,620
This market, however, the purism is going after.

207
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:48,000
The crowd that wants to support a social purposes company that's furthering free software.

208
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,880
The crowd that wants kill switches on their hardware devices.

209
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:56,600
The crowd that wants privacy respecting services that they're willing to pay for.

210
00:11:56,600 --> 00:12:01,240
Yeah, that's the crowd that generally knows how to spin up a VPS.

211
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:04,720
That's the kind of crowd that can load something on a Raspberry Pi.

212
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:09,400
So they are competing in a very unique niche.

213
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:10,880
So maybe you're right.

214
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:11,880
Maybe it is too expensive.

215
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:15,640
For me personally, having a appreciation of what it would take to run infrastructure

216
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:20,560
like that at scale, it's probably not enough money, but it seems to be their thing.

217
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:24,800
Well, it remains to be seen if they're going to pull this off and when and if they're going

218
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,880
to deliver this phone.

219
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:31,040
So I suppose we have to give them the benefit of the doubt for now, but I'm going to watch

220
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:33,280
with a skeptical eye on that one.

221
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:39,520
When I backed the Librem 15 and they delivered it extremely late without the GPU that I was

222
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:44,060
promised, I thought to myself, all right, they've got some struggles.

223
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:45,680
Let's see how they do.

224
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:49,380
When they launched a phone, I thought, oh boy, that's crazy.

225
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:50,840
Let's see how they do.

226
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:55,080
When they announced that that phone was going to have its own custom boutique operating system

227
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:59,560
and that they were going to modify every GTK application to be scalable or create their

228
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:03,780
own application, I thought, oh no, that's not a good sign.

229
00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:08,480
When the dev kit shipped and the screens couldn't even work without some crazy black box flashing,

230
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:12,020
I thought, oh boy, that's probably a red flag.

231
00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:14,980
And then when the tablet that they announced just kind of quietly disappeared and nobody

232
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:20,200
said anything, I thought, I don't think people are thinking critically about this company.

233
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:25,140
And then when they announced services, I thought, oh man, they're really biting off a lot here.

234
00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:27,280
They're a small team that just went through layoffs.

235
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:29,140
I mean, they're so desperate.

236
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:33,200
Todd was forced to lay people off even that were at community events.

237
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:36,200
People got laid off over a weekend from a hotel room.

238
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:41,280
I mean, that tells you just how desperate the situation must be at Pureism.

239
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:44,340
And so I was concerned, but I'll tell you where they really lost me.

240
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:49,480
And it's funny because, you know, maybe 10 years ago, maybe even five years ago, I would

241
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:51,280
have laughed at this.

242
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:57,160
But now in 2019, their marketing message is way off.

243
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:58,160
Way off.

244
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:02,600
I don't know if you had a chance to see their launch video, but the entire thing's a dick

245
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:06,700
joke about touching junk, looking at junk, sizes of junk.

246
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:08,440
The entire thing is a penis joke.

247
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:10,180
Like, who's that appealing to?

248
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:17,000
And here's the worst thing, when you combine that with their messaging, their best case

249
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:21,880
for success now is to get labeled as an alt-right platform, which I grant you would be ridiculous,

250
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:23,760
but that's exactly how these things go.

251
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:27,360
Like, I can't believe that video in 2019.

252
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:31,080
I grant you a younger version of me would have found it funny.

253
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:34,680
But now that's not how you launch services like this.

254
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:35,680
That's embarrassing.

255
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:37,240
Yeah, that video was just terrible.

256
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:41,300
And it's there embedded on the page where you go to sign up.

257
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:47,240
It just seems like such a huge misstep to me to do, as you say, the dick jokes, and

258
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:51,800
it just feels just totally off the mark to me.

259
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:59,400
It's amateurish, especially when you're comparing yourselves to Google and Apple.

260
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:01,880
It's just so out of touch with reality.

261
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:05,900
Yeah, but even Apple do some out of touch reality stuff like that What's A Computer

262
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:11,720
Video With A Kid With The iPad, but at least that's not offensive as well.

263
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:14,760
Yeah, I'm sure a lot of dudes thought it was hilarious.

264
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:20,240
So if they want a dude-only service, well, they're in a good position now.

265
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:23,760
How many women do you think watched that video and thought, oh, man, this is a service for

266
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:24,760
me?

267
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:26,140
Yeah, probably not that many.

268
00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:30,400
I'm sure some found it funny, but for me, it just fell so flat.

269
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:33,000
I was just watching it thinking, what are they doing?

270
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Okay, so they're doing that.

271
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,440
Okay, they're doubling down, tripling down.

272
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:38,840
Okay, so this whole video is going that way.

273
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:44,840
Well, it was really unfortunate because I just really misjudged Purism as a company.

274
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:47,360
Because they talk about having a family plan.

275
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:51,360
And so Dylan's in the room with me, and the joke's not lost on him.

276
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:55,080
So my son just watched a dick joke video that I had no intention of showing him, because

277
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:57,360
I just didn't expect that from Purism.

278
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:01,240
Well, it's not the only blunder that's happened this week.

279
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:05,680
I've had even normal people message me asking, what's going on with Firefox?

280
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:07,780
Why isn't adblock working anymore?

281
00:16:07,780 --> 00:16:12,800
And then I've had to try and find them a link to explain it, and just couldn't really.

282
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:18,400
No, and then when you combine explaining that you need to participate in studies, and the

283
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:21,080
entire thing was a mess.

284
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:25,280
And the way I got contacted was, hey, I've been having this problem with my Facebook

285
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:26,280
container.

286
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:27,280
I'm going to delete it and reinstall it.

287
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:28,280
Now I've lost my...

288
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:29,280
And it was just...

289
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:30,480
It was a total mess.

290
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:34,600
And I did not realize what was going on at the time, so it took me a few minutes to figure

291
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:39,380
out what was actually happening, because at the time, there was very little communication

292
00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:40,380
from Mozilla.

293
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:44,100
I actually had to go to the bug tracker and read the bug reports to figure out what the

294
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:45,600
hell was going on.

295
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:49,000
And it apparently all came down to an expired certificate.

296
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Yeah.

297
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Now that is bad.

298
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,840
That is really bad for them to allow that to happen.

299
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:59,680
But mistakes happen, people are human, they didn't have the right cron job or whatever.

300
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:01,240
No, I can't agree with that.

301
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:02,680
You don't design it that way.

302
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:03,680
Yes, you're right.

303
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:06,400
Mistakes happen and SSL certs expire.

304
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,400
That's not news.

305
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:09,620
And by the way, that's always how it's been.

306
00:17:09,620 --> 00:17:12,000
So you plan and design for it.

307
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:17,600
You designed a system that could be taken out by something that you knew was going to

308
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:18,600
happen.

309
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:19,600
Think about that for a moment.

310
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:20,600
Yeah.

311
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:25,120
It's just that for me, the messaging, the lack of communication here just overshadowed

312
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:31,000
the technical blunder, which I suppose thinking about it, it was terrible in the first place.

313
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,920
But just the way they handled this.

314
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:38,040
Okay, now they've pushed out an update, but it took them too long to do that.

315
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:41,820
And there was not enough clear communication about it.

316
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:46,280
But you're right, actually, just the design of this thing to even allow it to happen in

317
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:47,280
the first place.

318
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:48,560
I can't believe it.

319
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:55,160
For the past month, every episode, Mozilla have been doing great stuff, and we've been

320
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:57,120
reporting on that and singing their praises.

321
00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:02,280
They've been doing a bunch of good stuff, and they have to go and let us down with this.

322
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:07,980
When the market share is already so low, how many people must have been pushed over to

323
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:09,800
Chrome because of this?

324
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:13,840
All my extensions have just randomly stopped working, and I've got some weird message.

325
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:17,640
Right, I'm just going to open Chrome and just forget about Firefox then.

326
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:22,040
Well, the other thing that was a secondary effect of this is people became much more

327
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:27,520
aware of how powerful the studies feature is, which is functionality they use to test

328
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:28,520
stuff.

329
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:32,120
Well, it turns out they can push production code down to your browser like hotfixes for

330
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:33,120
this.

331
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:35,720
And I don't know if people had really made that connection because that's what I saw

332
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:40,480
a lot of people reacting to is, wait a minute, you can push code right down to my browser

333
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:43,360
in real time anytime you want?

334
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:48,160
And you know, the tinfoil hats came out, I guess they need to listen to the Linux action

335
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:51,760
new show more because we had told people about that.

336
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:59,040
So you're fixed if you're on version 66.0.4 on desktop or Android, and they have released

337
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:00,560
an ESR fix as well.

338
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:03,000
That is version 60.62.

339
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,280
If you're on one of those two versions, everything's back to normal.

340
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:10,720
If you got the hotfix via the study feature, you're probably okay.

341
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:14,880
That just took about six hours to kick in, which also screwed with people.

342
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:18,560
Yeah, you could go into about config and change that time.

343
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:21,000
But otherwise, you just have to leave it.

344
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:25,320
And you've just reminded me I've just gone in and turned that feature off again.

345
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:30,800
So yeah, and that feature where you go in and adjust the time that essentially creates

346
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:33,440
a more frequent check in with Mozilla.

347
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:37,560
So it would download the fixes faster, because there was a six hour check in window.

348
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:41,840
Now, the funny thing is, because that spread around the internet a whole bunch, a lot of

349
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:45,760
people adjusted that timeout window and it put a big load on Mozilla server as everybody's

350
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:47,600
now checking in much more frequently.

351
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:52,140
So if you did make that adjustment, this is your Linux action news public service reminder

352
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:53,760
to go set it back to the default.

353
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:54,760
Let's be nice to Mozilla.

354
00:19:54,760 --> 00:20:00,320
Yeah, and also disable studies again, like I just have or not, it's up to you.

355
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:04,040
Now if you're listening to this this week, and you have no idea what happened, then good

356
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:05,040
news.

357
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:10,400
It was right Friday, May 3, as we record this, when Mozilla became aware of the issue.

358
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:12,240
And now by Monday, it's all taken care of.

359
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:16,640
Yeah, I've not seen the update on my Ubuntu based system yet, but I'm sure that will be

360
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:19,320
forthcoming early in the week.

361
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:23,120
But this is just such an embarrassing blunder for Mozilla.

362
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:28,780
It's not like there's some two bit small project with a couple of people, whatever.

363
00:20:28,780 --> 00:20:33,500
This is a major organization with hundreds and hundreds of people working for them.

364
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:34,880
How could this happen?

365
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:40,160
I would only be conjecturing, but my first thought was just technical debt.

366
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:41,720
It's an old project.

367
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:43,460
People have come and gone.

368
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:47,200
This is really a production example of the cost of technical debt.

369
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:52,220
Well, I hope that there's some very serious meetings that take place and some procedures

370
00:20:52,220 --> 00:20:57,040
put in place to stop this happening again, because they just cannot take another one

371
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:58,040
of these.

372
00:20:58,040 --> 00:21:03,360
I think after that, Mr. Robot, Snafu, and some of the other stuff we've talked about,

373
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:05,400
they just cannot afford to do stuff like this.

374
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:07,280
Well, you had mentioned Ubuntu there.

375
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:10,280
Maybe you could take advantage of their new support program.

376
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:14,840
This week, Canonical announced Ubuntu Advantage for Infrastructure, which is a consolidated

377
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:21,480
enterprise security compliance and support offering that covers a whole range of infrastructure

378
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:25,560
services that are popular on Ubuntu right now for 10 years.

379
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:29,120
So Joe, this must be like the official version of what we saw Mark Shuttleworth talking about

380
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:30,120
recently.

381
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:33,840
That really sets up Canonical as a serious enterprise player, doesn't it?

382
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:41,880
Being able to support the Linux side, Kubernetes, Docker, OpenStack, KVM, all sorts of other

383
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:47,400
stuff just in one single package that you can just pay for as just one bill that's going

384
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:48,840
out every month.

385
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:55,180
It seems like a very good strategy and just more evidence of this streamlining and Shuttleworth

386
00:21:55,180 --> 00:22:00,600
getting really serious about, well, he says IPRing could be selling, but either way, getting

387
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:01,760
the business in shape.

388
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:07,440
Yeah, this really sort of turns the knob on Canonical being a consultation services company.

389
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:14,800
And the pricing's actually pretty good, especially compared to like RHEL subscriptions.

390
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:18,400
They have three packages, Essential, Standard, and Advanced.

391
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:19,820
Here's the desktop price, just as an example.

392
00:22:19,820 --> 00:22:25,960
You can get full freaking support, like full stack support, Ubuntu certified peripherals,

393
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:30,720
the installation, configuration of software, and support for software that are official

394
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:31,720
Canonical snaps.

395
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:36,840
You get support for, you get support for software in the repositories.

396
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:39,420
Essential is $25 a desktop.

397
00:22:39,420 --> 00:22:43,720
Standard is $150 and Advanced is $300 for a desktop.

398
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:50,580
With Advanced, you get one hour response time from support, 24-7.

399
00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:55,660
And they even have like a special, like crazy fast support for like weekends and holidays

400
00:22:55,660 --> 00:22:57,000
and all that kind of stuff.

401
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:02,860
You get support for Kubernetes, KVM, OpenStack, like Joe said, as well as the live patch service.

402
00:23:02,860 --> 00:23:04,400
It's really comprehensive.

403
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:07,520
I'll link to it in the show notes if you want to read through it for more.

404
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:12,020
There's some really interesting things in here, including there is some packages that

405
00:23:12,020 --> 00:23:16,200
include completely setting up a Kubernetes stack and then supporting it from installation

406
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:19,100
to managing the clusters and everything.

407
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:23,680
This is such a genius play because you get started with Ubuntu for free on a VPS one

408
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:27,300
day and then as your company grows, you deploy it in your own data center.

409
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:32,040
And then when you get serious, you can call up Canonical and you can get 10 years of support.

410
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:36,200
And you're getting support from Canonical employees that can work with other people

411
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:40,380
in the office to write drivers, write patches, get direct information.

412
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:41,960
This is just a brilliant move.

413
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:46,080
And because they're supporting desktop and server, that means it works for people that

414
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:48,040
want to deploy it as a workstation too.

415
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:50,600
You now have a support package backed by Canonical.

416
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:54,920
Honestly, if I was still a consultant these days, I'd be installing Ubuntu like crazy

417
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:57,000
and then selling it with this for each desktop.

418
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:02,280
It was interesting to see how surprised Shotworth was that the desktop's actually doing really

419
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:03,280
well in enterprise.

420
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:07,080
And, you know, he didn't say it's making a ton of money compared with all the other stuff

421
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:10,120
they do, but it does seem to be profitable for them.

422
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:13,880
And actually bringing in enough revenue to be noteworthy.

423
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:15,140
I don't buy it for a second.

424
00:24:15,140 --> 00:24:16,400
Not that it's not profitable.

425
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:18,480
I don't buy for a second that he was surprised.

426
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:23,800
I think what it is, is Canonical has failed to successfully tell that story for years

427
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:24,800
now.

428
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:28,220
And internal frustration with that has led to a new strategy.

429
00:24:28,220 --> 00:24:33,840
When Mark is talking to a reporter and he says, I'm surprised by the success our enterprise

430
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:36,140
desktop product is having.

431
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:37,140
That's a real headline.

432
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:42,400
Canonical is having so much success that Mark Shotworth himself was surprised by it.

433
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:45,680
But if Mark goes to the reporter and says, our desktop business is doing great.

434
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:47,840
We're making a lot of revenue from it.

435
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:48,840
It's a whole home story.

436
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:49,840
Nobody runs it.

437
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:53,880
That's quite cynical, but I suppose it makes sense that he's just being a good marketing

438
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:54,880
man.

439
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:55,880
Yeah, I suppose I'll buy that.

440
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:56,880
Yeah, that's what he's doing.

441
00:24:56,880 --> 00:25:01,280
He goes out to these OpenStack summits, he talks about how all in Canonical is with OpenStack.

442
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:06,620
What they're doing is really positioning themselves as a multi-cloud, multi-hardware vendor.

443
00:25:06,620 --> 00:25:07,620
That's really kind of brilliant.

444
00:25:07,620 --> 00:25:08,620
It's a good strategy.

445
00:25:08,620 --> 00:25:11,760
They're making custom images for the big cloud providers.

446
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:13,940
They're working with OEMs like Dell.

447
00:25:13,940 --> 00:25:18,140
They're working now to sell support directly to enterprises and customers.

448
00:25:18,140 --> 00:25:22,380
And they're sitting back and going, we're the truly independent multi-cloud vendor.

449
00:25:22,380 --> 00:25:23,840
You want to do everything with Kubernetes?

450
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:24,840
Have at it.

451
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:25,840
You want to do everything with OpenStack?

452
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:27,640
We love OpenStack.

453
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:32,400
Red Hat must be looking over at this and taking some serious notes, I would have thought.

454
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:33,400
Perhaps.

455
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:34,400
I wonder.

456
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:35,400
I'd love to know.

457
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:37,320
I'd love to know how much they watch each other.

458
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:40,500
I suspect it's more than they let on.

459
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:43,120
But you know, Red Hat Summit is next week.

460
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:47,140
And little birdies have told me that they have some huge things in the works.

461
00:25:47,140 --> 00:25:49,400
They're both doing their own things right now.

462
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:51,540
And they're both rocking it in their own categories.

463
00:25:51,540 --> 00:25:55,820
The thing is about this market is there's more than enough room for Canonical and Red

464
00:25:55,820 --> 00:25:58,280
Hat to both be very, very successful.

465
00:25:58,280 --> 00:26:00,100
To be ridiculously successful.

466
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:02,940
And so they're both going at it with their own strategies.

467
00:26:02,940 --> 00:26:05,580
And I've been watching the Canonical one pretty closely.

468
00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:09,020
And I'm pretty excited to get an up close look at the Red Hat one.

469
00:26:09,020 --> 00:26:12,820
We've got some discussion set up with some people in Red Hat.

470
00:26:12,820 --> 00:26:14,400
We've been chatting with some folks.

471
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:17,180
And the word is there's going to be big news next week.

472
00:26:17,180 --> 00:26:22,020
And both Red Hat and Canonical have had some success with Dell hardware.

473
00:26:22,020 --> 00:26:23,980
Now new hardware was just announced by Dell.

474
00:26:23,980 --> 00:26:28,140
It ships with Ubuntu, but it is RHEL certified.

475
00:26:28,140 --> 00:26:33,980
And that's an interesting sort of confluence of the two strategies.

476
00:26:33,980 --> 00:26:38,260
Where they're both trying to position themselves as a multi-cloud independent provider.

477
00:26:38,260 --> 00:26:40,420
Where you can run it on anything you want.

478
00:26:40,420 --> 00:26:42,860
But we also have our recommended strategy.

479
00:26:42,860 --> 00:26:46,100
Like Canonical has a very recommended approach if you go with their support system.

480
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:47,100
Just like RHEL does.

481
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:50,420
I don't know, they're similar in a lot of ways.

482
00:26:50,420 --> 00:26:53,860
But they're also uniquely attacking this problem very differently.

483
00:26:53,860 --> 00:26:58,220
And we're linked to a survey that Ubuntu and Dell are doing, which is a desktop developer

484
00:26:58,220 --> 00:26:59,220
survey.

485
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:03,260
I did take part in it, but it kind of skipped most of the questions for me because I didn't

486
00:27:03,260 --> 00:27:04,860
say I was a developer.

487
00:27:04,860 --> 00:27:06,580
But I love doing these surveys.

488
00:27:06,580 --> 00:27:13,460
And I think that people love to criticize companies and organizations for data gathering.

489
00:27:13,460 --> 00:27:16,500
But then when they want people to volunteer their data, not that many people do.

490
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:21,620
So I always encourage people, take part in the survey, give them the data that they want,

491
00:27:21,620 --> 00:27:24,420
help them out, and we will all benefit from it.

492
00:27:24,420 --> 00:27:28,820
With hopefully some great Dell machines that are focused for developers.

493
00:27:28,820 --> 00:27:31,260
Well it was DockerCon last week.

494
00:27:31,260 --> 00:27:33,580
And as you would expect, there was some big news.

495
00:27:33,580 --> 00:27:37,180
And we did send our own Al Marquez to get a beat.

496
00:27:37,180 --> 00:27:42,780
But probably the biggest thing out of DockerCon, besides some of the numbers they announced

497
00:27:42,780 --> 00:27:48,740
about adoption and usage, is their new Docker desktop package for enterprise users.

498
00:27:48,740 --> 00:27:53,020
Of course we talked about that compromise of Docker Hub last week, but now they want

499
00:27:53,020 --> 00:27:54,020
to be talking about this.

500
00:27:54,020 --> 00:27:58,300
I haven't actually had a chance to speak to Elle about her going to DockerCon, have you?

501
00:27:58,300 --> 00:28:00,900
Yeah, I had a chance to talk to her this morning before the show.

502
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:01,900
She's been traveling.

503
00:28:01,900 --> 00:28:05,300
She spent the week at DockerCon and met lots of people.

504
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:07,740
And it's in San Francisco, California.

505
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:11,460
And the next one would traditionally be in Europe.

506
00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:15,700
However it appears, and there's lots of rumors as to why, they're not doing that anymore.

507
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:17,620
DockerCon may no longer return to Europe.

508
00:28:17,620 --> 00:28:20,260
In fact, it looks like the next one will be in Austin.

509
00:28:20,260 --> 00:28:24,080
And she thinks that's sort of a reflection of a larger transition that events like this

510
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:25,100
are going through.

511
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:27,380
It's something that we witnessed at scale too.

512
00:28:27,380 --> 00:28:31,820
Didn't see it as much at Linux Fest, but you definitely are seeing it very much at DockerCon

513
00:28:31,820 --> 00:28:33,500
and at scale as well.

514
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:39,260
The world is becoming all about Kubernetes, about managing on-premises and hybrid cloud

515
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:44,300
systems, multi-vendor management with Kubernetes.

516
00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:48,720
And Docker is really just a bit of a Kubernetes implementation detail.

517
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:52,980
And she noticed a lot of speculation on the floor about the future of events like this.

518
00:28:52,980 --> 00:28:56,220
She says there's things like the OpenStack Summit, which has now changed to the Open

519
00:28:56,220 --> 00:28:57,780
Infrastructure Summit.

520
00:28:57,780 --> 00:29:01,100
The overall landscape itself is changing.

521
00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:05,940
And the amount of Kubernetes talks just at DockerCon was really high, just like it was

522
00:29:05,940 --> 00:29:07,140
at scale.

523
00:29:07,140 --> 00:29:12,460
And it really kind of left her with the sense that the focus of the event was growing beyond

524
00:29:12,460 --> 00:29:13,580
Docker itself.

525
00:29:13,580 --> 00:29:15,440
And that's awkward for DockerCon.

526
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:16,440
That's really awkward.

527
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:22,240
In fact, the last day had a, quote unquote, open source summit, which was really just

528
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:24,500
about a lot of stuff beyond the scope of Docker.

529
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:26,380
I've seen this when I go to these events.

530
00:29:26,380 --> 00:29:28,180
And now Elle's seeing this at these different events.

531
00:29:28,180 --> 00:29:32,500
There's a real transition happening in the industry right now, a profound transition.

532
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:36,340
Well, it's not the only transition happening in the IT industry.

533
00:29:36,340 --> 00:29:40,540
We've got three stories to end with, which on their own kind of wouldn't be worth talking

534
00:29:40,540 --> 00:29:41,540
about.

535
00:29:41,540 --> 00:29:48,260
But the fact that Amazon, Microsoft, and Facebook are all getting into blockchain at the same

536
00:29:48,260 --> 00:29:51,420
time, it kind of feels worth talking about to me.

537
00:29:51,420 --> 00:29:55,680
Yeah, this is actually, you're right, in aggregate, this is really kind of a big deal.

538
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:58,980
And maybe Amazon has the most solid go at it, because they really kind of announced

539
00:29:58,980 --> 00:30:05,220
this at their reInvent event back in like December or November 2018, I think it was.

540
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:09,300
The Amazon Managed Blockchain is what they call it, the AMB, Joe.

541
00:30:09,300 --> 00:30:12,740
It's been in preview for a month, and they've just flipped it to general availability.

542
00:30:12,740 --> 00:30:16,100
It'll be online in their Northern Virginia data center, and then they're going to roll

543
00:30:16,100 --> 00:30:18,180
it out to other regions.

544
00:30:18,180 --> 00:30:24,300
So the AMB system, the Amazon Managed Blockchain, supports two quote unquote blockchain frameworks.

545
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:30,100
The first one is Ethereum, and the second one is the Hyperledger Fabric.

546
00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:36,280
Now the latter is the result of the Linux Foundation working with IBM on their big hyper

547
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:38,140
chain system.

548
00:30:38,140 --> 00:30:40,760
It's the only one that's actually available in production right now.

549
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:44,180
The Ethereum system isn't supported yet.

550
00:30:44,180 --> 00:30:49,820
And when Amazon was contacted for details, they didn't have a date.

551
00:30:49,820 --> 00:30:54,800
But they just said later this year, they did kind of define the differences in why customers

552
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:59,980
might want Hyperledger Fabric over Ethereum, if you're interested.

553
00:30:59,980 --> 00:31:04,220
Hyperledger is well suited for applications that require stringent privacy and permission

554
00:31:04,220 --> 00:31:07,660
controls and a set number of members and contributors.

555
00:31:07,660 --> 00:31:11,660
Whereas Ethereum's uses are for more like situations where you need transparency amongst

556
00:31:11,660 --> 00:31:14,780
all the members, where that's like a key thing.

557
00:31:14,780 --> 00:31:17,140
And you want it to be highly distributed.

558
00:31:17,140 --> 00:31:21,500
Maybe an example might be like a like a loyalty chain blockchain network that allows retailers

559
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:26,020
to share information amongst each other and independently verify activity across all the

560
00:31:26,020 --> 00:31:27,020
different members.

561
00:31:27,020 --> 00:31:28,980
That's where you would use Ethereum.

562
00:31:28,980 --> 00:31:30,660
Interesting, right?

563
00:31:30,660 --> 00:31:31,660
Interesting.

564
00:31:31,660 --> 00:31:33,180
And then Microsoft's got theirs.

565
00:31:33,180 --> 00:31:38,380
I think the most interesting thing about Microsoft's is that there's ties in with Azure Active

566
00:31:38,380 --> 00:31:39,380
Directory.

567
00:31:39,380 --> 00:31:42,860
Yeah, well, Microsoft can't be left out, can they?

568
00:31:42,860 --> 00:31:47,820
But it's interesting that they are going for Quorum, I think that's how you say it, which

569
00:31:47,820 --> 00:31:51,420
is the JP Morgan ledger, right?

570
00:31:51,420 --> 00:31:53,580
Which is based off of Ethereum.

571
00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:54,580
Yeah.

572
00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:55,940
And yet is used for private stuff.

573
00:31:55,940 --> 00:31:59,100
So that kind of contradicts Amazon's messaging there.

574
00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:00,100
Yeah, I wonder.

575
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:01,500
I think maybe they might just be using.

576
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:05,340
See, one of the really nice things about Ethereum is it has the smart contracts feature.

577
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:08,140
So they might just be taking bits and pieces of Ethereum.

578
00:32:08,140 --> 00:32:09,300
Who really knows?

579
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:11,360
I don't really like that aspect of this.

580
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:13,580
This is where it starts to get confusing.

581
00:32:13,580 --> 00:32:17,340
And then you add that with Facebook's Zuckcoin, or whatever they're going to call it.

582
00:32:17,340 --> 00:32:20,820
Now, this isn't a blockchain so much as it is a currency that they want to launch.

583
00:32:20,820 --> 00:32:24,420
Yeah, this is much more speculative than the other two, but I just thought it'd be funny

584
00:32:24,420 --> 00:32:25,420
to include it.

585
00:32:25,420 --> 00:32:28,980
But yeah, they want to get into cryptocurrency stuff.

586
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:34,380
And I don't know, you have to think that Facebook has got so many users that if anyone was going

587
00:32:34,380 --> 00:32:37,300
to put it off, they might be able to.

588
00:32:37,300 --> 00:32:41,140
I kind of could see this for any system that has those crappy points.

589
00:32:41,140 --> 00:32:45,340
You know, like, I don't know if Microsoft Live does this anymore, but back in the day

590
00:32:45,340 --> 00:32:48,900
when I had an old Xbox, you had to buy like these live points and then you'd buy the games

591
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:49,900
with the live points.

592
00:32:49,900 --> 00:32:53,240
You'd always end up with like a remaining balance and you know, they would like skimming

593
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:54,500
off of that.

594
00:32:54,500 --> 00:33:00,120
I could see systems like that becoming a cryptocurrency of sorts that users could then trade amongst

595
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:05,260
each other, or maybe even convert to another platform's coin.

596
00:33:05,260 --> 00:33:08,580
You know, there's gonna be hundreds of these things, I would think in, you know, 10, 20

597
00:33:08,580 --> 00:33:09,580
years.

598
00:33:09,580 --> 00:33:13,300
Yeah, and it does seem logical to distribute that rather than just have it all centralized.

599
00:33:13,300 --> 00:33:18,180
So the hype is all about, you know, cryptocurrencies, but the reality just always comes back to

600
00:33:18,180 --> 00:33:22,560
the same thing, a distributed database that's cryptographically signed and verified.

601
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:25,820
We just need to make a podcast coin, man, like a, like a land coin.

602
00:33:25,820 --> 00:33:26,820
JV coin, maybe, yeah.

603
00:33:26,820 --> 00:33:30,460
Yeah, yeah, or a Tux coin, you know, we just need to get in on the game before it's too

604
00:33:30,460 --> 00:33:31,460
late, that's all.

605
00:33:31,460 --> 00:33:32,460
Yeah.

606
00:33:32,460 --> 00:33:34,300
Can I pre-mine the first few thousand of them?

607
00:33:34,300 --> 00:33:37,620
Well, yeah, just to see the network so that way it's viable.

608
00:33:37,620 --> 00:33:41,980
I think it's important that, I think it's important that you and I get a few coins ahead

609
00:33:41,980 --> 00:33:44,900
of time, you know, for the good of the coin.

610
00:33:44,900 --> 00:33:45,900
Yeah.

611
00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:51,580
Oh, interestingly, at Linux Fest Northwest, I talked to the people at the Free Software

612
00:33:51,580 --> 00:33:57,940
Foundation booth, and I was able to confirm that when they received that huge donation

613
00:33:57,940 --> 00:34:03,920
from Handshake, it wasn't actually in cash, it was in cryptocurrency, but that they cashed

614
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:08,240
it out immediately, or at least as quickly as they possibly could, and turned it into

615
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:10,660
actual US greenbacks, as you would say.

616
00:34:10,660 --> 00:34:11,660
There you go.

617
00:34:11,660 --> 00:34:13,620
A little bit of Linux action news exclusive.

618
00:34:13,620 --> 00:34:14,620
Yep.

619
00:34:14,620 --> 00:34:18,620
Now this week, I'll be at Red Hat Summit along with a few from the crew, and Microsoft's

620
00:34:18,620 --> 00:34:20,680
build event will be underway.
