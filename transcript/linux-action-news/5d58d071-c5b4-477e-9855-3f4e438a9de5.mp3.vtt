00:00.000 --> 00:09.400
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News Episode 112, recorded on June 29th, 2019.

00:09.400 --> 00:10.400
I'm Chris.

00:10.400 --> 00:11.400
And I'm Joe.

00:11.400 --> 00:12.400
Hello, Joe.

00:12.400 --> 00:13.400
Good to be connected with you.

00:13.400 --> 00:15.480
So many stories to jump into this week.

00:15.480 --> 00:21.400
Let's start with a brand new fresh Raspberry Pi 4 that was announced just really kind of

00:21.400 --> 00:24.840
a few hours after our episode went live last week.

00:24.840 --> 00:25.840
Dang it.

00:25.840 --> 00:27.920
Yeah, no, this shouldn't have happened.

00:27.920 --> 00:33.240
We reported a few months ago that there was going to be no Raspberry Pi 4 this year at

00:33.240 --> 00:34.240
all.

00:34.240 --> 00:36.240
And then suddenly, boom, it shows up.

00:36.240 --> 00:40.640
Not only did it show up, but it showed up with a skew that I am very happy with at the

00:40.640 --> 00:41.640
higher end.

00:41.640 --> 00:47.140
Of course, the starting price is $35, but at the higher end, it's $55, US greenbacks,

00:47.140 --> 00:52.360
and you can get it with four gigabytes of LPDDR4 RAM now.

00:52.360 --> 00:55.360
Yes, that is exactly what I wanted.

00:55.360 --> 01:00.800
Well that and gigabit Ethernet, I am very excited about dedicated Ethernet now as well.

01:00.800 --> 01:05.600
Those two things alone, I feel like game changers for the Pi, but I believe you actually have

01:05.600 --> 01:06.600
gotten your hands on one.

01:06.600 --> 01:10.680
Yeah, I got hold of the four gigabyte version, which apparently is quite rare, but I found

01:10.680 --> 01:13.360
a site, someone linked me to it that was selling it.

01:13.360 --> 01:17.600
I was not confident it was going to actually turn up, but it did a couple of days later.

01:17.600 --> 01:21.760
I did have to buy a power supply with it, which actually I'm grateful for now because

01:21.760 --> 01:25.680
it really does need the three amp power supply to run it.

01:25.680 --> 01:28.360
This is a power hungry beast now.

01:28.360 --> 01:33.080
Instead of being based on the 40 nanometer silicon, this time it's 28 nanometer, so it's

01:33.080 --> 01:37.680
not the very latest technology, but it is significantly improved.

01:37.680 --> 01:44.440
As a result of that, not only is the RAM faster and DDR4 now instead of two, it is just a

01:44.440 --> 01:46.400
much faster machine.

01:46.400 --> 01:48.000
There's no doubt.

01:48.000 --> 01:51.720
Just general browsing and just everything you do with it is faster.

01:51.720 --> 01:53.840
So I'm curious about two things really, Joe.

01:53.840 --> 01:55.560
Let's start with the first one.

01:55.560 --> 02:00.120
New set of adapters required, right, because you've got micro HDMI, USB-C, as you kind

02:00.120 --> 02:03.160
of alluded to, so it's a new set of cables.

02:03.160 --> 02:04.160
How did all that go fiddly?

02:04.160 --> 02:05.320
Did you have to go pick stuff up?

02:05.320 --> 02:09.040
Well, I was forced to buy the power supply with it, so that was taken care of, and I've

02:09.040 --> 02:13.480
got other USB-C cables and chargers and stuff, so I wasn't too worried about that.

02:13.480 --> 02:19.540
It's got two micro HDMI outs now, so you can run two monitors, and I just got the Amazon

02:19.540 --> 02:26.040
Basics micro HDMI to HDMI cables for like Â£5.60 or something for the pair.

02:26.040 --> 02:28.920
So I just consider that part of the cost of it, really.

02:28.920 --> 02:29.920
They're pretty short, though.

02:29.920 --> 02:32.840
They're only three foot, but I have got a coupler if I need to make it longer, but so

02:32.840 --> 02:34.840
far it's not been an issue.

02:34.840 --> 02:36.880
I'm happy to see USB-C, to be honest.

02:36.880 --> 02:39.400
It's worth a new power adapter as far as I'm concerned.

02:39.400 --> 02:43.080
The second thing I'm wondering, this is a lot faster of a chip.

02:43.080 --> 02:46.460
In fact, they're claiming it's 3X the performance they're claiming.

02:46.460 --> 02:50.440
It's desktop performance grade that has to equal in more heat.

02:50.440 --> 02:53.900
When you're consuming more power, you've got a faster processor.

02:53.900 --> 02:57.380
Did you get a sense of heat output, and especially when it was under load, did you get a sense

02:57.380 --> 02:58.720
of how hot it was getting?

02:58.720 --> 03:01.400
Dangerously hot, I'm afraid.

03:01.400 --> 03:03.220
That's the downside of this.

03:03.220 --> 03:07.560
Everything else is great, but the heat is a real issue.

03:07.560 --> 03:13.800
I would not feel comfortable giving this to my little nephew to play with unsupervised.

03:13.800 --> 03:15.400
Maybe if it was in a case, I would, but...

03:15.400 --> 03:16.480
You think he'd burn himself?

03:16.480 --> 03:18.040
I think there's a real risk of it.

03:18.040 --> 03:22.840
He's pretty sharp and switched on, but I'd be at least keeping one eye on him to make

03:22.840 --> 03:24.760
sure he didn't touch it.

03:24.760 --> 03:29.200
You cannot hold it for more than a couple of seconds before it starts to burn your fingers.

03:29.200 --> 03:35.820
It's funny that the 3B Plus I noticed was hotter than the 3B, and this is one step up

03:35.820 --> 03:37.800
in terms of temperature.

03:37.800 --> 03:41.620
The whole thing gets hot, and specifically the CPU.

03:41.620 --> 03:42.620
It needs cooling.

03:42.620 --> 03:47.720
It's funny, I was listening to the Friday stream from last week, and you guys were talking

03:47.720 --> 03:53.080
about your first PCs on there, and how originally they didn't even have heat sinks, and then

03:53.080 --> 03:56.240
they started to have heat sinks, and then, wow, this one's got a heat sink and a fan,

03:56.240 --> 03:57.880
and that was kind of a big deal.

03:57.880 --> 04:00.120
I think we're getting there now with these pies.

04:00.120 --> 04:04.620
I think we're going to get to the point where you're going to have to use some sort of active

04:04.620 --> 04:05.620
cooling on it.

04:05.620 --> 04:06.620
Perhaps, yeah.

04:06.620 --> 04:10.960
And maybe even if it's not officially recommended, you might find that enthusiasts just start

04:10.960 --> 04:14.640
doing it, you're already starting to see them do it with the previous models.

04:14.640 --> 04:19.480
One difference here now from way back in the day, like we were talking about in the Friday

04:19.480 --> 04:25.360
stream, is there is active thermal management and active downclocking.

04:25.360 --> 04:33.080
This, as they say, is really designed for bursty performance, which is really their

04:33.080 --> 04:38.340
way of saying after a little bit of high performance time on the CPU, we have to start clocking

04:38.340 --> 04:39.340
down a bit.

04:39.340 --> 04:46.320
Let's not forget, not only does this have a faster quad-core 64-bit ARM Cortex A72 CPU

04:46.320 --> 04:52.180
in it, but along with all of that is their faster graphics, which is now using a real

04:52.180 --> 04:57.760
full OpenGL stack, in part, thanks to some really fresh software they're shipping on

04:57.760 --> 04:58.760
these new pies.

04:58.760 --> 05:02.280
Yeah, there's a new version of Raspbian that goes along with this, and it's based on the

05:02.280 --> 05:09.200
upcoming release of Debian, which is Debian 10 Buster, which is pretty much ready to go

05:09.200 --> 05:10.200
that.

05:10.200 --> 05:12.680
I think we're going to be reporting on the release of that in the next couple of weeks

05:12.680 --> 05:14.720
probably.

05:14.720 --> 05:18.400
And it generally feels pretty stable and pretty good.

05:18.400 --> 05:23.240
There's a few little rough edges here and there, but in some fronics benchmarks, it

05:23.240 --> 05:29.200
is that little bit faster, I think about 3% faster on a 3B plus at least.

05:29.200 --> 05:34.120
It looks like Michael didn't get a hold of one, but it feels all right, this new version

05:34.120 --> 05:38.760
of Raspbian, but I think that there's a bit of a way to go.

05:38.760 --> 05:43.100
If you look at the earlier versions of Raspbian when they came out, it's come such a long

05:43.100 --> 05:44.100
way.

05:44.100 --> 05:48.720
And with this new hardware and the new system on a chip, there's a lot of work has had to

05:48.720 --> 05:49.720
go into it.

05:49.720 --> 05:51.480
And I think a bit of the polish still needs to happen.

05:51.480 --> 05:55.680
So I'm hoping that with updates over the next few months, it's going to significantly improve.

05:55.680 --> 05:56.680
I would imagine.

05:56.680 --> 06:00.520
The official launch date of Debian Buster is July 7th.

06:00.520 --> 06:02.360
So they are a couple of weeks ahead.

06:02.360 --> 06:10.040
That said, keep in mind, it's been frozen Buster for a couple of months, I believe now.

06:10.040 --> 06:17.000
And they've been testing Buster on the new Raspberry Pi internally since January of 2019.

06:17.000 --> 06:19.820
So they've had a really good go at it.

06:19.820 --> 06:23.480
They're pretty confident shipping it to end users, but I suspect you're right, Joe.

06:23.480 --> 06:27.520
In a couple of weeks after Buster shipped, there's probably going to be a round of updates

06:27.520 --> 06:33.120
for Raspbian that sort of brings it up with fixes or other little tweaks that I'm sure

06:33.120 --> 06:35.600
will be discovered as more and more users start to use this.

06:35.600 --> 06:39.560
Because not only do you have the upcoming release of Buster, which will put it in the

06:39.560 --> 06:43.400
hands of a lot more people, but you're also just going to have a lot more users now using

06:43.400 --> 06:50.280
the Raspberry Pi 4 with this version of Raspbian, they'll discover things, submit them upstream,

06:50.280 --> 06:52.800
and there'll be a natural round of fixes that'll come from this.

06:52.800 --> 06:54.180
It's kind of nice to see them pushing it forward.

06:54.180 --> 06:59.280
And to be clear, the reason why they really went all in on Buster is for that OpenGL video

06:59.280 --> 07:02.520
driver that's now being used by default.

07:02.520 --> 07:07.560
And the development of that driver has been taking place upstream in the most recent version

07:07.560 --> 07:08.960
of Debian.

07:08.960 --> 07:12.520
And they looked at backboarding it to stretch, but they thought, you know, our effort is

07:12.520 --> 07:16.520
better spent getting Buster up to production because it's so close already.

07:16.520 --> 07:18.000
And that's what they decided to do.

07:18.000 --> 07:21.220
They weren't sure if Buster would land before the new hardware or not to when they made

07:21.220 --> 07:22.220
that decision.

07:22.220 --> 07:23.520
It was sort of up in the air.

07:23.520 --> 07:24.720
I'm glad to see it.

07:24.720 --> 07:25.720
And the early reports are good.

07:25.720 --> 07:26.720
I ordered one.

07:26.720 --> 07:31.120
I ordered the whole desktop kit of the four gigabyte model because they're really talking

07:31.120 --> 07:35.200
about using this on the desktop when I thought, let's give it a go.

07:35.200 --> 07:36.200
Let's see what it's like.

07:36.200 --> 07:41.040
I'm going to go in with reasonable expectations, but it's nice to see this update because if

07:41.040 --> 07:48.280
they get close to desktop performance, maybe kiosk performance, or perhaps nice Kodi media

07:48.280 --> 07:51.040
center performance, I'd be a pretty happy customer.

07:51.040 --> 07:54.920
I know there's other devices on the market that have reached this level of performance,

07:54.920 --> 07:58.040
but it's nice to see a Raspberry Pi that's really competitive now.

07:58.040 --> 07:59.040
Do you know what I mean?

07:59.040 --> 08:00.880
Oh, yeah, definitely.

08:00.880 --> 08:04.120
One thing I was a bit disappointed about was that it doesn't boot from USB.

08:04.120 --> 08:08.000
I was confused for a little while trying to make it work.

08:08.000 --> 08:09.000
Is it my cable?

08:09.000 --> 08:10.000
Is it this monitor?

08:10.000 --> 08:11.000
What's going on?

08:11.000 --> 08:17.960
But then I looked in the comments for the original post on the Raspberry Pi blog.

08:17.960 --> 08:23.080
And yeah, Eben is commenting there that he says, at present, we only support booting

08:23.080 --> 08:24.960
from SD card.

08:24.960 --> 08:30.520
We will support booting from USB and network in due course via an upgrade to the onboard

08:30.520 --> 08:31.640
SPI flash.

08:31.640 --> 08:36.860
So yeah, a bit of a disappointment there, but hopefully that will be coming soon because

08:36.860 --> 08:38.460
it's USB 3.

08:38.460 --> 08:44.840
And if you've got a fast USB flash drive or USB 3 SSD, you could potentially have a really

08:44.840 --> 08:46.120
fast boot experience.

08:46.120 --> 08:51.320
So you can still do it now by moving partitions around and stuff, but it'd be nice to be able

08:51.320 --> 08:55.280
to just stick USB stick in and just have a really simple, fast boot.

08:55.280 --> 09:00.200
I believe him when he says it'll come because when it does arrive, you can see a lot of

09:00.200 --> 09:08.120
people taking a USB 3 SSD of any size they want and making that the primary boot disk

09:08.120 --> 09:12.360
for Raspberry Pi and essentially having as much storage as a desktop PC.

09:12.360 --> 09:13.360
That's the exciting thing.

09:13.360 --> 09:17.080
In the meantime though, you could have a pretty high performance SD card, a boot from that

09:17.080 --> 09:18.840
and then use the attached storage.

09:18.840 --> 09:24.880
And the nice thing is with the Raspberry Pi 4, the USB 3 bus is its own dedicated USB

09:24.880 --> 09:25.880
bus now.

09:25.880 --> 09:28.480
You're not competing for resources with the network anymore.

09:28.480 --> 09:31.240
So using real storage is an option.

09:31.240 --> 09:34.000
So it'd be nice to see it, but there's ways to make it work in the meantime.

09:34.000 --> 09:35.000
Yeah.

09:35.000 --> 09:38.120
And I've installed Samba on it with just a spinning drive that is USB 3 that's reasonably

09:38.120 --> 09:39.120
fast.

09:39.120 --> 09:44.560
Bear in mind that I was transferring from that to my other NAS box, which is not built

09:44.560 --> 09:45.680
for performance at all.

09:45.680 --> 09:51.640
It was built for budget and I was getting three to four to maybe 500 megabits a second

09:51.640 --> 09:53.440
of a ethernet.

09:53.440 --> 09:57.560
So I wasn't pushing it to the gigabit, but I'm sure that you probably could push it a

09:57.560 --> 10:00.800
bit closer if the other end was faster.

10:00.800 --> 10:01.800
Yeah.

10:01.800 --> 10:05.800
I bet we'll see some projects based around this to turn them into NAS's and all kinds

10:05.800 --> 10:06.800
of stuff.

10:06.800 --> 10:07.800
I mean, that's what I'm going to do with mine.

10:07.800 --> 10:09.520
I'm going to play around with that.

10:09.520 --> 10:14.240
Maybe I can make a solid state NAS in the RV or something that's potentially fanless.

10:14.240 --> 10:15.440
We'll see about that.

10:15.440 --> 10:21.320
In the meantime, I'll spend my time waiting for my Raspberry Pi 4 by checking out the

10:21.320 --> 10:26.240
new reinvented Firefox preview, at least for Android.

10:26.240 --> 10:27.240
Yeah.

10:27.240 --> 10:31.240
They call this a preview and it kind of doesn't really have a proper name yet.

10:31.240 --> 10:36.080
And really it's a replacement for Firefox Focus, which was their really stripped down

10:36.080 --> 10:40.200
browser, which is still available, but it's kind of been parked and shelved and there's

10:40.200 --> 10:43.200
no active development on it anymore.

10:43.200 --> 10:48.640
And it's kind of splitting the difference between Firefox Focus and regular Firefox.

10:48.640 --> 10:54.780
It's faster and leaner, but it has far more features than Firefox Focus.

10:54.780 --> 10:58.200
And I feel like it could potentially compete.

10:58.200 --> 11:02.680
It's a little bit rough around the edges, a bit buggy at this point, but it is only

11:02.680 --> 11:03.680
a preview.

11:03.680 --> 11:08.720
It's really for enthusiasts and people wanting to test it for bugs and developers and stuff.

11:08.720 --> 11:14.520
So my expectations were pretty low going into it, but I was kind of pleasantly surprised

11:14.520 --> 11:15.520
by it.

11:15.520 --> 11:18.840
Although I was annoyed that the tabs are at the bottom rather than at the top where they

11:18.840 --> 11:19.840
belong.

11:19.840 --> 11:22.240
I would be willing to bet that's going to change.

11:22.240 --> 11:23.560
A lot of people will have that feedback.

11:23.560 --> 11:27.000
I'm glad you got a chance to try it because I did actually bring my Android device with

11:27.000 --> 11:30.040
me on the trip to try out stuff, but did not get a chance.

11:30.040 --> 11:32.000
I'm down in Texas right now.

11:32.000 --> 11:35.560
But I did read through this and I noticed a couple of things that jumped out at me.

11:35.560 --> 11:38.200
And so I did some digging and you're right, Joe.

11:38.200 --> 11:42.240
There is a real emphasis on this not being quite production ready yet.

11:42.240 --> 11:47.520
In fact, if you read through their announcement, they refer to it as A, a preview, B, a pilot

11:47.520 --> 11:51.080
and C, available for early adopters.

11:51.080 --> 11:54.840
So they're really trying to make it clear this isn't for everyone.

11:54.840 --> 11:57.520
But I'll tell you one of the features that jumped out at me, and then I want to talk

11:57.520 --> 11:58.520
about the performance.

11:58.520 --> 12:04.480
But just feature wise, I was really kind of lukewarm to this bundles idea that they have.

12:04.480 --> 12:07.960
They call them collections in this browser, but different browsers have done this concept

12:07.960 --> 12:09.480
before.

12:09.480 --> 12:14.280
And I kind of looked at the way they've done these collections of different websites and

12:14.280 --> 12:15.280
I get it now.

12:15.280 --> 12:20.960
In their example, they show a morning routine collection or perhaps your favorite place

12:20.960 --> 12:25.400
to go plan for trips or shopping for clothes.

12:25.400 --> 12:30.800
And they bundle all those sites together in one like easy to execute group, also easy

12:30.800 --> 12:32.520
to share with other users.

12:32.520 --> 12:37.520
And that I kind of dig, like news bundles I could see us using, but that's kind of neat.

12:37.520 --> 12:39.240
So I'll be playing around with it pretty soon.

12:39.240 --> 12:43.040
I might give it a couple of weeks to bake, but let's talk about the performance here

12:43.040 --> 12:44.680
just for a moment.

12:44.680 --> 12:48.640
This is powered by something we've covered on the show before and we're kind of unsure

12:48.640 --> 12:49.640
where it was going to go.

12:49.640 --> 12:51.560
And now we really have a clear answer.

12:51.560 --> 12:56.160
This is running GeckoView, Firefox's new mobile browser engine.

12:56.160 --> 13:00.800
That's the same high performance engine that focus is already using.

13:00.800 --> 13:05.920
And on the Mozilla blog, they say implementing GeckoView paves the way for a complete makeover

13:05.920 --> 13:09.320
of the mobile Firefox experience.

13:09.320 --> 13:13.800
They say all major browsers today are based on blink on Android and reflective of Google's

13:13.800 --> 13:15.800
decisions about mobile.

13:15.800 --> 13:22.160
This is GeckoView engine ensures us and our users independence, that's some bold talk

13:22.160 --> 13:23.160
about GeckoView.

13:23.160 --> 13:27.820
Like this is GeckoView is turning out to be like a key part of their Android strategy

13:27.820 --> 13:29.800
of their reinvention on Android.

13:29.800 --> 13:31.800
Well, it's like quantum on the desktop, isn't it?

13:31.800 --> 13:38.040
It's the basically the only alternative to Chrome and Chromium based browsers now.

13:38.040 --> 13:42.120
And they've realized that that's what differentiates them and then just go in with it.

13:42.120 --> 13:46.400
Yeah, they even kind of talk about how this is their take on quantum for Android.

13:46.400 --> 13:49.760
Like we're going to do what we did for the desktop now on mobile.

13:49.760 --> 13:52.600
They're going to make it faster at a code level, but they also say they're going to

13:52.600 --> 13:57.840
make it faster by designing it to be a little more efficient at a usability standpoint.

13:57.840 --> 14:02.440
And then for the rest of 2019, they're directing their efforts into optimizing the Firefox

14:02.440 --> 14:04.020
experience on Android.

14:04.020 --> 14:06.680
This is of course the mobile teams focus.

14:06.680 --> 14:09.800
And they say in order to have a strong foundation for the next generation of mobile Firefox

14:09.800 --> 14:13.740
browsers, we're going to put all of our efforts into GeckoView.

14:13.740 --> 14:17.440
And that's also at the expense of, like you mentioned earlier, focus going on hold for

14:17.440 --> 14:23.380
a bit or I guess potentially indefinitely, and then maybe being eventually replaced by

14:23.380 --> 14:24.640
this new effort.

14:24.640 --> 14:25.760
We don't quite know yet.

14:25.760 --> 14:27.880
They're not necessarily spelling it out yet.

14:27.880 --> 14:31.480
No, but it certainly looks like focus is going to go away, I think.

14:31.480 --> 14:33.680
Yeah, that would be my inclination from it.

14:33.680 --> 14:36.240
And I think what you're going to end up with is like you said, something that splits the

14:36.240 --> 14:39.200
difference and makes for a pretty good browser.

14:39.200 --> 14:43.280
And along with overall Firefox improvements, one of the things that's landing in Firefox

14:43.280 --> 14:47.720
69 is a random password generator, which is nice because a lot of the other major browsers

14:47.720 --> 14:48.800
offer that now.

14:48.800 --> 14:52.360
So when you get a prompt to create a password for our website, it will suggest something

14:52.360 --> 14:57.080
that's randomly generated and then in theory, I would imagine, offer to save it for you.

14:57.080 --> 14:59.280
Yeah, I think this is long overdue really.

14:59.280 --> 15:01.080
So good to see them doing it.

15:01.080 --> 15:02.080
Yeah.

15:02.080 --> 15:07.960
Well, something Microsoft feels is overdue is getting in on that insider circle of Linux

15:07.960 --> 15:11.640
distros that know about those security problems before the rest of us.

15:11.640 --> 15:18.640
Yeah, Microsoft employee Sasha Levin has applied to join the Linux distros mailing list, which

15:18.640 --> 15:26.160
as you say is where the various distros communicate and coordinate on security disclosures before

15:26.160 --> 15:28.020
the rest of us find out.

15:28.020 --> 15:31.880
And Microsoft are kind of claiming that they deserve to be part of this now because they

15:31.880 --> 15:37.680
have got WSL2 and Azure Sphere, which are proper distros.

15:37.680 --> 15:39.680
So yeah, let us in please.

15:39.680 --> 15:43.960
You would think something called the Linux distros list was something else.

15:43.960 --> 15:46.680
But nope, this is where they discuss these security issues.

15:46.680 --> 15:51.040
And from that standpoint, I can kind of see Microsoft point, I think this is probably

15:51.040 --> 15:52.040
legit.

15:52.040 --> 15:57.040
You see, there's eight different criteria in which you must meet to get access to this.

15:57.040 --> 16:01.400
Like they're different ones like actively maintain a Unix like operating system distro

16:01.400 --> 16:03.720
with substantial use of open source components.

16:03.720 --> 16:08.480
Like Joe said, they argue the WSL2 does that, that Azure Sphere does that.

16:08.480 --> 16:14.200
They also argue that products like Azure HD Insight, their Kubernetes services and other

16:14.200 --> 16:20.040
things on Azure make them a public provider of access to Linux based distributions.

16:20.040 --> 16:22.120
So they also meet another criteria.

16:22.120 --> 16:23.120
There's other things in here.

16:23.120 --> 16:25.480
Like I said, eight different criteria.

16:25.480 --> 16:30.200
Once they get accepted in theory, they would then get access to these discussions that

16:30.200 --> 16:34.360
are crucial for getting an early heads up on coordinating and handling the deployment

16:34.360 --> 16:36.440
of fixes before they're made public.

16:36.440 --> 16:41.960
Once they're made public, then they go on a mailing list called OSS security, which

16:41.960 --> 16:45.600
you would think would be the mailing list they talk about security issues that are private,

16:45.600 --> 16:48.980
but is in fact the one where they talk about public security issues.

16:48.980 --> 16:51.260
So there's two different mailing lists.

16:51.260 --> 16:53.120
And right now they only have access to the public one.

16:53.120 --> 16:56.320
So they've submitted Sasha on behalf of Microsoft, all those different criteria, he's got an

16:56.320 --> 16:58.040
answer for all of them.

16:58.040 --> 17:03.200
Just word noting, he is endorsed by Greg KH, who I think people probably know who Greg

17:03.200 --> 17:04.200
is.

17:04.200 --> 17:05.900
He's longtime contributor to Linux kernel.

17:05.900 --> 17:07.840
He maintains the LTS branch.

17:07.840 --> 17:09.760
He's Linus's number two.

17:09.760 --> 17:14.340
And the reason why he signed off on Sasha is quite simply, if you just glance at the

17:14.340 --> 17:19.280
change log for the more recent Linux kernels, Sasha's all over it.

17:19.280 --> 17:22.200
He's been contributing to Linux kernel pretty steadily recently.

17:22.200 --> 17:27.680
And so he's obviously got the attention of Greg and he is giving Sasha his blessing.

17:27.680 --> 17:30.480
So I think it's probably pretty likely they're going to get in and it makes sense.

17:30.480 --> 17:37.040
They've got cloud infrastructure that's running user loads, powered by open source and Linux.

17:37.040 --> 17:38.520
They should probably stay safe and secure.

17:38.520 --> 17:39.520
Yeah.

17:39.520 --> 17:43.280
And as the register points out, it really does complete their transformation almost

17:43.280 --> 17:49.840
from back in 2001, calling Linux a cancer to here we are 18 years later, and they're

17:49.840 --> 17:52.320
taking part in some of the low level stuff like this.

17:52.320 --> 17:56.280
So I don't know, maybe Microsoft have changed.

17:56.280 --> 17:58.040
Let's see what the YouTube comments say about that.

17:58.040 --> 18:00.560
They love it when you say that.

18:00.560 --> 18:01.560
Yeah.

18:01.560 --> 18:06.560
But speaking of the kernel, when Google Plus went away, suddenly Linus had nowhere to

18:06.560 --> 18:09.560
post and a bunch of the other kernel people.

18:09.560 --> 18:12.680
So they decided to start people.kernel.org.

18:12.680 --> 18:16.400
Following the different kernel developers on Google Plus was quite literally for me

18:16.400 --> 18:21.200
the best thing about Google Plus and the thing I missed about Google Plus when it went away.

18:21.200 --> 18:24.500
So it is really great to see people.kernel.org pop up.

18:24.500 --> 18:28.720
Now there's already a place where you can follow a lot of the kernel developers.

18:28.720 --> 18:30.640
That's planet.kernel.org.

18:30.640 --> 18:33.920
It's an aggregator of a bunch of different blogs.

18:33.920 --> 18:39.440
The difference here with people.kernel.org is it's focused on Linux related development

18:39.440 --> 18:42.860
topics, whereas the other is sort of just their blogs, whatever they're talking about.

18:42.860 --> 18:45.080
This is just the kernel development stuff.

18:45.080 --> 18:48.440
And it's kind of one of our secret sauces here that's made a little easier for everyone

18:48.440 --> 18:54.240
now is we go out and individually follow these developers and sort of aggregate their blogs

18:54.240 --> 18:55.720
to watch for news.

18:55.720 --> 18:57.440
And now they're doing it for everyone.

18:57.440 --> 19:03.320
So it's people.kernel.org if you want to follow just Linux related topics of different kernel

19:03.320 --> 19:04.320
developers.

19:04.320 --> 19:08.500
And as you'd expect, it is an ActivityPub enabled federated platform powered by write

19:08.500 --> 19:12.360
freely and some nice hosting by the folks at write.as.

19:12.360 --> 19:13.360
So that's pretty cool.

19:13.360 --> 19:16.840
And you'll be able to see the individual blogs that are on topic.

19:16.840 --> 19:17.840
Yeah.

19:17.840 --> 19:21.000
And unlike planet.kernel.org, they've actually configured the SSL cert properly.

19:21.000 --> 19:22.000
Really?

19:22.000 --> 19:23.000
I hadn't noticed that.

19:23.000 --> 19:26.240
I only follow the feed, so I've never really gone to the website.

19:26.240 --> 19:28.880
Yeah, I haven't for a while, but I've just checked it now.

19:28.880 --> 19:30.920
And yeah, it's misconfigured, unfortunately.

19:30.920 --> 19:31.920
It's pretty cool.

19:31.920 --> 19:34.980
Like I went I've been going there for the last couple of days because I saw this announcement

19:34.980 --> 19:38.160
earlier in the week and was following it since then.

19:38.160 --> 19:41.520
And it's really technical.

19:41.520 --> 19:45.840
Like if you get into like the really geeky low level stuff, this is it.

19:45.840 --> 19:47.640
This is really great.

19:47.640 --> 19:50.960
And you can get an idea a little flavor of the different kernel developers like you can't

19:50.960 --> 19:52.880
do this with other operating systems.

19:52.880 --> 19:53.880
So it's so cool.

19:53.880 --> 19:54.880
Yeah.

19:54.880 --> 19:56.120
And all running free software as well, which is cool.

19:56.120 --> 19:59.100
So it's kind of the silver lining to Google Plus going away.

19:59.100 --> 20:03.640
Following up to one of the notable topics from last week, we did get a statement as

20:03.640 --> 20:10.560
expected from Canonical on the support for 32-bit i36 packages for Ubuntu 1910 and Ubuntu

20:10.560 --> 20:12.120
2004 LTS.

20:12.120 --> 20:17.600
Yeah, and they did the U-turn that we were kind of expecting, but hoping they wouldn't.

20:17.600 --> 20:23.360
And so they are going to support a limited number of 32-bit packages to make stuff like

20:23.360 --> 20:29.160
Steam and Wine work, which I suppose it was just inevitable, wasn't it really?

20:29.160 --> 20:30.160
Yeah.

20:30.160 --> 20:31.780
You got to give Canonical one thing.

20:31.780 --> 20:35.400
They make a strong stance and then they typically will listen to the feedback and it may take

20:35.400 --> 20:39.420
them a while, but they eventually reverse course or compromise.

20:39.420 --> 20:42.200
You can look at Upstart and SystemD, Unity to Gnome.

20:42.200 --> 20:43.740
I mean, just the list goes on and on.

20:43.740 --> 20:44.880
And this is another example.

20:44.880 --> 20:50.120
They say we'll put in place a community process to determine which 32-bit packages are needed

20:50.120 --> 20:54.940
to support legacy software and can add to that list post-release if we miss something

20:54.940 --> 20:55.940
that is needed.

20:55.940 --> 21:00.700
Let's stop here for a second because in the end, I think what we ended up with is a pretty

21:00.700 --> 21:02.160
workable compromise.

21:02.160 --> 21:07.880
Instead of having to manage and maintain hundreds of 32-bit libraries, perhaps they will limit

21:07.880 --> 21:14.120
that problem domain down to 30 or 40, which not only makes it more sustainable, but keeps

21:14.120 --> 21:16.760
the end users happy and their partners happy.

21:16.760 --> 21:21.060
Like Valve, it's kind of a great compromise because it's way easier than maintaining hundreds

21:21.060 --> 21:24.940
of libraries while also keeping end users and partners happy.

21:24.940 --> 21:25.940
Like everybody wins.

21:25.940 --> 21:31.960
Yeah, but they did have plans and ideas for how to solve this problem in another way.

21:31.960 --> 21:38.100
And it feels like just pressure from the community has forced them to just do it the way the

21:38.100 --> 21:44.400
community wants rather than pushing forward using containerization and snaps and other

21:44.400 --> 21:46.480
technologies, newer technologies.

21:46.480 --> 21:52.360
They are just going to keep supporting at least some of these old I386 packages, which

21:52.360 --> 21:57.760
it just feels like a bit of a backwards step to me to do that.

21:57.760 --> 22:01.640
It feels like they need to move on, but I suppose people's games are very important

22:01.640 --> 22:02.640
to them.

22:02.640 --> 22:08.680
There's quite a lot of feedback about our stance on this, and obviously, Canonical got

22:08.680 --> 22:13.760
even more than ours, way more, and I suppose they were going to have to do this.

22:13.760 --> 22:23.280
But this means that it could be 2030 by the time they stop supporting 32-bit I386 packages

22:23.280 --> 22:26.080
for people who are paying.

22:26.080 --> 22:27.360
That's an awfully long time.

22:27.360 --> 22:28.360
It is.

22:28.360 --> 22:32.560
And as part of this process in our research, we went back to the original announcement

22:32.560 --> 22:36.400
of the 64-bit transition to just sort of try to take the temperature of what it was like

22:36.400 --> 22:38.920
going from 32-bit to 64-bit.

22:38.920 --> 22:44.880
And on linux.com, which we have linked in last week's Linux Unplugged, there is an interview

22:44.880 --> 22:49.560
with some kernel developers in there, and they're clearly talking about this as a temporary

22:49.560 --> 22:51.040
transitional technology.

22:51.040 --> 22:56.100
Oh, the 32-bit supports there, but it's really just while we move into 64-bit, and they talk

22:56.100 --> 22:58.280
about it like it's a temporary thing.

22:58.280 --> 23:02.400
And so it's kind of funny to think if that was in 2001, and Canonical may end up supporting

23:02.400 --> 23:08.040
that until 2030s, that temporary transition will have been a 30-year transition around

23:08.040 --> 23:10.240
there, some 29, 28-year transition.

23:10.240 --> 23:13.480
It's like when you do construction work on a house, and you just have a temporary thing

23:13.480 --> 23:18.440
there, and then you just end up stuck with it forever, because it's just more hassle

23:18.440 --> 23:21.280
than it's worth to sort it out.

23:21.280 --> 23:24.560
Just that pipe, we'll just temporarily run it along the surface or whatever, and we'll

23:24.560 --> 23:28.640
sort it out later, and then 30 years later, it's just there all rusty and stuff.

23:28.640 --> 23:30.800
And that's pretty much what we've got here.

23:30.800 --> 23:34.880
I want to talk about Valve's response here in a moment, because they also posted a statement.

23:34.880 --> 23:41.040
But just to wrap this up, I do kind of think this is a pretty nice compromise.

23:41.040 --> 23:43.680
So I think it's not, in the end, that bad of a solution.

23:43.680 --> 23:49.440
I do still believe that we already have existing technology that could have solved this problem.

23:49.440 --> 23:55.720
It is possible today to install a 64-bit-only Linux distro, and then add a Steam Flatpak

23:55.720 --> 23:58.560
that includes 32-bit support.

23:58.560 --> 23:59.560
And you can play the game.

23:59.560 --> 24:01.360
I mean, that's technology that exists today.

24:01.360 --> 24:04.360
Yeah, but someone has to build those 32-bit components though, right?

24:04.360 --> 24:05.360
Oh, sure.

24:05.360 --> 24:06.360
But that's being done today already.

24:06.360 --> 24:07.360
Like, it's happening.

24:07.360 --> 24:12.200
So we have the technology, I guess is what I'm saying, is it's a possibility.

24:12.200 --> 24:16.160
Steam could also have just included more in their runtime, which they talk about in a

24:16.160 --> 24:17.720
little bit in their post.

24:17.720 --> 24:21.960
I think, ultimately, what made me think this is not necessarily a bad idea to try to work

24:21.960 --> 24:28.720
these old 32-bit subsystems and libraries out is the messaging from Canonical.

24:28.720 --> 24:34.400
It's been extremely subtle, but it's there every time they talk about this.

24:34.400 --> 24:39.560
Even in their latest statement, they write, there is a real risk to anybody who is running

24:39.560 --> 24:42.960
a body of software that gets little testing.

24:42.960 --> 24:48.380
The facts are that most 32-bit x86 packages are hardly used at all.

24:48.380 --> 24:51.760
This means fewer eyeballs and more bugs.

24:51.760 --> 24:58.960
They in different ways have tried to say, without having to scare people, we feel we

24:58.960 --> 25:04.720
are shipping vulnerable software that isn't getting properly checked out and tested.

25:04.720 --> 25:10.200
And as a platform vendor, we think this is bad, but they don't want to come out and say

25:10.200 --> 25:14.480
we're shipping vulnerable software because that looks really bad and we get them a lot

25:14.480 --> 25:19.200
of crap, but they have to kind of also communicate to their end users at the same time.

25:19.200 --> 25:21.640
We're really worried about the security of this.

25:21.640 --> 25:23.440
We think you should know that.

25:23.440 --> 25:25.400
That's been completely overlooked in this entire thing.

25:25.400 --> 25:28.080
Yeah, it's not necessarily about it being vulnerable.

25:28.080 --> 25:29.800
It's about it being potentially vulnerable.

25:29.800 --> 25:32.560
It's about simply not knowing because there's not enough testing.

25:32.560 --> 25:36.760
Well, we do know for a fact that they are vulnerable from Spectre and Meltdown type

25:36.760 --> 25:40.680
attacks because no one's ever backboarded the mitigations to that to 32-bit.

25:40.680 --> 25:43.880
Yeah, but that is quite an extreme example, isn't it?

25:43.880 --> 25:50.240
Sure, but it is an example of a very well-known, extremely publicized vulnerability that hasn't

25:50.240 --> 25:52.440
made it back to 32-bit.

25:52.440 --> 25:57.120
And so you got to wonder if maybe other things that are a little less known, maybe didn't

25:57.120 --> 26:00.340
get as much publicity, also aren't getting fixed.

26:00.340 --> 26:01.600
I would bet that's true.

26:01.600 --> 26:06.000
Yeah, I remember once there was a bug in Ubuntu that stopped mumble working and that was after

26:06.000 --> 26:07.600
a kernel upgrade.

26:07.600 --> 26:13.000
But the 32-bit kernel upgrade had no effect on it and it still worked perfectly well.

26:13.000 --> 26:20.960
And so there are clearly differences between 32-bit and 64-bit x86 and who knows what they

26:20.960 --> 26:26.440
are because if hardly anyone is using 32-bit, then there could be all sorts of bugs.

26:26.440 --> 26:30.080
Maybe they're just bugs like I was talking about there with mumble where it just doesn't

26:30.080 --> 26:34.600
work and just crashes or whatever, or maybe they are security issues.

26:34.600 --> 26:35.600
There's just no way of knowing.

26:35.600 --> 26:38.720
Something that's a bit interesting, again, the last episode of Linux Unplugged where

26:38.720 --> 26:43.920
we talked about this, we did a breakdown of what happens on a Linux box when you launch

26:43.920 --> 26:47.280
a 32-bit application on a 64-bit system.

26:47.280 --> 26:49.340
You think it's, oh, it loads one or two libraries.

26:49.340 --> 26:53.840
It's actually extremely complicated, including libraries and components that get loaded that

26:53.840 --> 26:58.520
you may never use, kernel subsystems that get activated the entire stack all the way

26:58.520 --> 26:59.520
down.

26:59.520 --> 27:01.560
There are ramifications.

27:01.560 --> 27:05.000
And I think it's interesting, I never knew it myself until we looked it up and wasted

27:05.000 --> 27:07.200
a full breakdown in the last Linux Unplugged.

27:07.200 --> 27:08.960
Yeah, I was going to say we looked it up.

27:08.960 --> 27:10.840
You mean Wes looked it up.

27:10.840 --> 27:11.840
Yeah.

27:11.840 --> 27:12.840
Yeah.

27:12.840 --> 27:15.120
Or I think I looked it up and said, Wes, this is really complicated.

27:15.120 --> 27:18.360
Could you break this down for us?

27:18.360 --> 27:19.360
He's good at that.

27:19.360 --> 27:21.240
Well, Valve also made a statement.

27:21.240 --> 27:24.960
Now, the same individual that tweeted that, oh, we have to drop support for Ubuntu, this

27:24.960 --> 27:31.760
is outrageous, posted an update as an official statement on the Steam Community website.

27:31.760 --> 27:36.400
And he goes into some background here and mentions the fact that Steam already bundles

27:36.400 --> 27:40.500
a lot of the dependencies needed by 32-bit games, but it currently relies on some key

27:40.500 --> 27:46.760
components being available on the host system, a 32-bit GLIB C, an ELF loader, MESA, and

27:46.760 --> 27:49.740
the NVIDIA graphics driver libraries, to just name a few.

27:49.740 --> 27:53.640
He says, we've been investigating ways to avoid these system dependencies for a while

27:53.640 --> 27:58.640
now by looking into light containerization and other approaches.

27:58.640 --> 28:02.200
So this is something Valve apparently has already been looking at.

28:02.200 --> 28:06.800
But the issue is that they wouldn't have it ready by the 1910 release time.

28:06.800 --> 28:11.360
And that's where the upset came from, because it'd either require a fundamental rushing

28:11.360 --> 28:16.360
or a fundamental change in the Steam runtime, either one they weren't happy with in a short

28:16.360 --> 28:18.660
time period.

28:18.660 --> 28:24.000
He touches on as well as the response mentioning not recommending Ubuntu to Steam users.

28:24.000 --> 28:30.000
Steam currently, he says, really kind of pushes users to use Ubuntu.

28:30.000 --> 28:33.420
And there may be some changes to that, sounds like, in the future.

28:33.420 --> 28:38.720
He writes, there's technical and non-technical reasons behind their concerns, but the bottom

28:38.720 --> 28:43.040
line is that we would have to drop what we're doing and scramble to support 1910, and that

28:43.040 --> 28:44.040
was the main issue.

28:44.040 --> 28:48.320
Well, something that jumped out at me is towards the end of the post where he says, the Linux

28:48.320 --> 28:52.480
landscape has changed dramatically since we released the initial version of Steam for

28:52.480 --> 28:53.480
Linux.

28:53.480 --> 28:57.440
And as such, we are rethinking how we want to approach distribution support going forward.

28:57.440 --> 29:01.560
And then he says that there are several distributions on the market today that offer a great gaming

29:01.560 --> 29:06.320
experience, such as Arch, Manjaro, Pop OS, Fedora, and many others.

29:06.320 --> 29:13.760
So that feels like a fairly thinly veiled threat to Canonical, that if you don't play

29:13.760 --> 29:17.400
the game with us, then we're going to start recommending a different distro.

29:17.400 --> 29:20.720
Yeah, or we're going to start recommending all of the distros.

29:20.720 --> 29:24.600
Perhaps some sort of containerized version of Steam would do just that.

29:24.600 --> 29:28.240
The end result would be good, I think, for all Linux users.

29:28.240 --> 29:33.600
I thought it was funny that he mentioned Arch and Manjaro, which are both sort of the same

29:33.600 --> 29:34.600
code base, essentially.

29:34.600 --> 29:38.080
And then Pop OS, which is based on Ubuntu.

29:38.080 --> 29:42.320
The only thing that was really its own unique standout distro in that list was Fedora, which

29:42.320 --> 29:46.640
only just recently got easier to install the NVIDIA driver and flat pack up Steam.

29:46.640 --> 29:49.080
I mean, it works great now, I'll grant you.

29:49.080 --> 29:50.280
That's only a recent development.

29:50.280 --> 29:55.360
But in the case of some past attempts at distributing Steam on some of these platforms, they've

29:55.360 --> 29:59.200
come up with their entire own packaging scheme, which I imagine Valve wouldn't be really a

29:59.200 --> 30:01.160
huge fan of either.

30:01.160 --> 30:07.960
So it is, it's a weird kind of thinly veiled attempt to throw shade at Canonical.

30:07.960 --> 30:15.040
I went through the history of this individual's Twitter feed, Pierre's, and he doesn't seem

30:15.040 --> 30:19.180
to be overall super satisfied with Ubuntu as a platform.

30:19.180 --> 30:22.960
You can see him complaining about the way PPAs are distributed.

30:22.960 --> 30:28.920
You can see him complaining that there was a regression that happened upstream, but Canonical

30:28.920 --> 30:32.040
didn't catch before it landed in Ubuntu.

30:32.040 --> 30:34.440
There seems to be other factors at play.

30:34.440 --> 30:40.300
In fact, even in this post, he writes, there are technical and quote, non-technical reasons

30:40.300 --> 30:43.020
behind our concerns.

30:43.020 --> 30:44.020
That's a shame.

30:44.020 --> 30:47.560
You know, my personal experience is Canonical is a pretty easy company to work with.

30:47.560 --> 30:48.560
And they're pretty accommodating.

30:48.560 --> 30:52.840
In fact, they'll work pretty damn hard to accommodate a partner like Valve.

30:52.840 --> 30:58.000
But at the end of the day, if Valve can come up with a way to distribute Steam that makes

30:58.000 --> 31:04.040
it essentially a common Steam runtime across all distributions and works really well, that's

31:04.040 --> 31:09.400
a win for all Linux users, Ubuntu users, Manjaro users, even Puppy Linux users.

31:09.400 --> 31:13.960
Yeah, and Flatpak seems to be the obvious solution or snap, but given the hostility

31:13.960 --> 31:17.240
towards Canonical, it seems unlikely that it'd be a snap.

31:17.240 --> 31:21.360
But yeah, if they could get a really great Flatpak that worked across all the distros,

31:21.360 --> 31:22.720
then everyone would be happy.

31:22.720 --> 31:28.800
It would be a more appropriate way to distribute Steam because you can't really expect all

31:28.800 --> 31:34.440
the different distributions across all the different hardware to really have a specific

31:34.440 --> 31:37.000
set of host libraries like they do now.

31:37.000 --> 31:38.600
It's really kind of created a hot mess.

31:38.600 --> 31:44.460
It's created all these different Steam solutions and all of these arch wiki posts and forum

31:44.460 --> 31:48.480
posts and everywhere where people are trying to figure out how to get certain 32-bit games

31:48.480 --> 31:49.980
to work.

31:49.980 --> 31:53.480
It's good if you are in a certain track of Linux.

31:53.480 --> 31:56.960
You know, if you're on one of these distributions he mentioned or you're on mainline Ubuntu,

31:56.960 --> 31:59.900
you really don't have any problems or even Fedora now.

31:59.900 --> 32:04.160
But there are distros, especially ones that are maybe a little more technically modern.

32:04.160 --> 32:06.520
Maybe they only ship 64-bit.

32:06.520 --> 32:10.000
Those distributions, it has been a challenge in the past and you can't necessarily rely

32:10.000 --> 32:14.300
on the host operating system to even have the libraries in the path Steam expects them

32:14.300 --> 32:15.520
to be in.

32:15.520 --> 32:20.680
So they do need to fix this problem and you really got to come up with a way to use Linux

32:20.680 --> 32:23.600
as the platform to deliver your product.

32:23.600 --> 32:24.600
That's how you have to treat it.

32:24.600 --> 32:26.320
And I think that's where they're going.

32:26.320 --> 32:29.400
It'd be nice to see them do it without having to throw shade.

32:29.400 --> 32:30.400
We'll see.

32:30.400 --> 32:31.400
We'll see how future posts go.

32:31.400 --> 32:34.900
Yeah, we'll keep following it and everything else in the Linux world.

32:34.900 --> 32:36.400
And you probably want to follow that too.

32:36.400 --> 32:41.460
So go to linuxactionnews.com slash subscribe for the ways to get all the future episodes.

32:41.460 --> 32:45.560
And let us know what you think about these stories or feedback for the show, linuxactionnews.com

32:45.560 --> 32:48.360
slash contact for ways to get in touch.

32:48.360 --> 32:54.560
And just a couple of items of note, we recently did a study group on understanding burnout.

32:54.560 --> 32:56.640
It was a really good one.

32:56.640 --> 33:01.360
Major Hayden from Red Hat joined L and we had some great contributions from the Mumble

33:01.360 --> 33:02.360
Room.

33:02.360 --> 33:05.060
That'll be up on our YouTube channel, youtube.com slash Jupiter Broadcasting.

33:05.060 --> 33:09.100
Highly recommend that to everyone out there who's ever struggled with some burnout.

33:09.100 --> 33:14.500
Another note, this upcoming Linux Unplugged that'll be out in a few days as you're listening

33:14.500 --> 33:18.480
to this is all about our experience with PCI pass through.

33:18.480 --> 33:19.480
It's so awesome.

33:19.480 --> 33:22.120
Even if you're not currently thinking about it, I encourage you to listen because it's

33:22.120 --> 33:26.600
a new way to distro hop and run Windows, Linux, and Mac OS all at once.

33:26.600 --> 33:28.440
So check out Linux Unplugged coming up soon.

33:28.440 --> 33:31.600
Yeah, I'm going to listen to that tomorrow while I edit it.

33:31.600 --> 33:35.300
We'll be back next Monday with our weekly take on the latest Linux Diamond Source news.

33:35.300 --> 33:36.920
I'm at Chris LAS.

33:36.920 --> 33:38.520
I'm at Joe Rissington.

33:38.520 --> 33:41.160
Thank you for joining us and we will see you next week.

33:41.160 --> 34:09.000
Take care, bye-bye, see you later.
