00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,960
Hello and welcome to Linux Action News, episode 168, recorded on December 20th, 2020.

2
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:09,960
I'm Chris.

3
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:10,960
And I'm Wes.

4
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:11,960
Hello, Wes.

5
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:14,520
Let's do the news and let's start with a real shocker.

6
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:17,080
Google is killing another project.

7
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:20,360
Unfortunately, I can't say I'm surprised.

8
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:25,720
This time around the dead project is Google's Android Things, a version of Android meant

9
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:27,920
for the internet of things.

10
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:32,420
Google announced it had basically given up on the project as a general purpose IoT operating

11
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:34,520
system back in 2019.

12
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:39,360
But now there's an official shutdown date thanks to a new FAQ page detailing the demise

13
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:40,360
of the OS.

14
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:44,480
Yeah, and with all things in the IoT space, generally these days, it's not just the device

15
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:49,080
support, there's a service attached as well and the Android Things dashboard, which is

16
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:55,260
used for managing devices, will stop accepting new devices and projects in just three weeks

17
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:58,280
on January 5th, 2021.

18
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:04,260
Developers will be able to continue updating existing deployments until January 5th, 2022.

19
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:05,660
That's one more year there.

20
00:01:05,660 --> 00:01:10,740
But after that, Google says the console will be turned down completely and all project

21
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:16,600
data will be permanently deleted, including build configurations and factory images.

22
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:19,200
So hey, better grab those while you can.

23
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,200
Wow.

24
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:24,200
For those of you that don't recall, since I don't think this was a hugely successful

25
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:28,520
product for Google, Android Things was a stripped down version of Google's Phone OS.

26
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:33,780
It was ideally meant for the Internet of Things, small cheap devices like sensors and smart

27
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:34,880
home devices.

28
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:40,480
The idea was that Android would bring a wide hardware compatibility, huge plus for manufacturers

29
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:45,040
and established app SDK, which they might likely already be writing apps for.

30
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:50,660
And of course, Google's easy to access cloud platform, along with regular security updates

31
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:53,140
delivered via that platform.

32
00:01:53,140 --> 00:02:00,840
Google kind of took the Apple strategy for Android Things where they were much more in

33
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:02,520
control of the updates.

34
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:06,280
They centrally distributed them, OEM sent them the firmware and the software, Google

35
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:09,000
massaged them and then deployed them.

36
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,800
IoT admins just had to go log into the dashboard and hit the ship update button on their Android

37
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:16,600
of Things dashboard, which then Google would send off.

38
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:20,880
I wonder if maybe this wasn't so surprising because part of the problem with Android Things

39
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:25,720
was that Android is just really heavy, at least for an embedded operating system.

40
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:30,520
The phones in our pockets these days are pretty beefy and even then Android's not exactly

41
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:31,960
snappy.

42
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:39,040
So while an OS for smartphones can be extended to cars and TVs, it's just bigger, more power

43
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:40,560
hungry than you really need.

44
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:44,960
I saw a link to a demo of a sample Android Things app and then compared it to a little

45
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:49,640
C++ application for targeting an embedded space and the amount of boilerplate, it was

46
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:51,120
just kind of crazy.

47
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:55,180
Yeah and you could see it even in semi-nice vehicles that would have built-in Android

48
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:59,400
integration or televisions that would use it, it would just be really slow.

49
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:04,660
And I think everyone noticed when Google shipped their own IoT devices on modified versions

50
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:11,160
of their Google Cast platform instead of Android Things, it was a real indicator that maybe

51
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:12,160
there's a problem here.

52
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:16,960
And in a way it was sort of a screw you to Google's OEMs too because groups like Lenovo

53
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:21,500
would come along and they'd make a Lenovo Smart Display using essentially the Google

54
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:25,640
Assistant software but running on top of Android Things.

55
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:30,480
And then Google would come along, undercut them on price and overperform because they

56
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:35,700
were using their Cast platform which is essentially based off of Gen 2 Linux.

57
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:40,200
And so I think it was really kind of this awkward situation where even Google found

58
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:42,680
it not necessarily the most compelling option.

59
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:48,320
Yeah, there just wasn't that much commitment here and so it was never really adopted.

60
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:50,120
But there were promises made.

61
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:55,680
When Android Things launched in May 2018, Google promised free stability fixes and security

62
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:59,920
patches for three years for every Android Things device.

63
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:05,240
And it told developers its hardware was certified for production use with guaranteed long-term

64
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:08,800
support for three years, which is something you might want if you're going to be making

65
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:10,920
products that ship and live in consumers' homes.

66
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:14,560
Yeah, or if you're buying them for your factory floor, you want something that's going to

67
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:17,440
have a guaranteed support lifecycle.

68
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:21,600
Well, so that put Google on the hook until May of 2021.

69
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:25,860
But based on the frequently asked questions they posted and the official Android Things

70
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:30,080
release page, it sounds like Google is not going to honor that promise.

71
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:36,440
The last Android Things release listed was August of 2019, putting Google's actual update

72
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:40,740
support at one year and three months.

73
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:45,880
And since there's no new devices coming, no new projects being accepted to the dashboard,

74
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:48,120
it seems like that's the end of things.

75
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:50,520
So long, Android Things.

76
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:55,680
Unfortunately, the entire Android ecosystem struggles with support life cycles, but that's

77
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:59,960
why it's kind of interesting to see Google and Qualcomm teaming up to enable a longer

78
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:03,680
support window for flagship Android smartphones.

79
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:09,320
Qualcomm, with Google's help, will now support its chipsets for three years of major OS updates

80
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:15,280
and four years of security updates, enabling a perhaps better than pixel level for all

81
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:19,440
future Android phones, well, provided your OEM is willing to cooperate.

82
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:22,900
Yeah, they got to get them nice, fancy Qualcomm chips.

83
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:28,400
This policy is starting with the flagship Snapdragon 888, but Qualcomm does say even

84
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:34,800
their lower end chips will be supported down the road, including their, quote, lower tier

85
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:35,900
ones, end quote.

86
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:39,920
But they are starting with this new Snapdragon 888 platform.

87
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:44,320
Part of what makes this so difficult is that there's just a lot of moving pieces and a

88
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:49,160
lot of different actors involved in Android release and life cycle, right?

89
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:53,240
I mean, you get your actual OEM that's making the phone, getting their own skin on there,

90
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:56,560
and then you've got to have support lower down in the stack from people like Qualcomm,

91
00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:00,160
who've got to make sure that all the actual bits and bobs work so you can receive your

92
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,360
text messages.

93
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,840
And drivers for those bits and bobs as the OS updates.

94
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:04,840
Yeah, absolutely.

95
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:05,840
Right.

96
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:09,520
So you've got the open source part of Android and Google's internal workings over at the

97
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:12,760
Android repository that has to come together.

98
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:13,760
Qualcomm has to keep up.

99
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:17,800
And then the OEMs have to integrate all of that before any of it ever gets in your hands.

100
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:20,920
And that's to say nothing if the carriers get involved with any bits of it.

101
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:21,920
Let's hope not.

102
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:22,920
Right.

103
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:27,840
But practically speaking, this means that Android will be supported on the 888 Snapdragon

104
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:33,520
with version 11, 12, 13 and 14.

105
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:34,600
That's remarkable.

106
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:38,520
So as a consumer, if this is something you care about now, you can start shopping for

107
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:40,680
these Snapdragons that will be supported like this.

108
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:45,480
Starting with 888, you'll know you've got until Android 14 with that device.

109
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:46,480
That's really nice.

110
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:51,440
Yeah, I really hope this is a sea change eventually for the whole Android ecosystem because it's

111
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:52,440
just been embarrassing.

112
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:57,560
You know, you can have a perfectly functional phone, say a Google Pixel 2, works just fine,

113
00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:01,440
no longer supported with updates just for no reason, it feels like.

114
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:05,140
And especially when that other ecosystem does this a lot better.

115
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:06,140
That's true.

116
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:07,140
That's true.

117
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:10,360
That's why I'm also grateful for projects like Lineage and all the other efforts out

118
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:14,960
there to get alternative operating systems on some of these devices.

119
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:19,520
While that's great for free software consumers like ourselves, it doesn't really work for

120
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:23,000
the average phone buyer who goes into the carrier store and picks up a phone where these

121
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,840
changes actually will improve their quality of life because some of these are security

122
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:27,840
fixes.

123
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:30,220
Yes, it's especially nice, I think, for that reason to see it in some of the lower end

124
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:34,040
models possible, possibly, you know, because I need a phone I can recommend to my mom and

125
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:35,760
she doesn't want to spend flagship money.

126
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:41,040
Well, speaking of saving a little money, Neverware was an organization that let you turn an old

127
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:46,200
PC or Mac into a Chromebook S device through its cloud ready OS.

128
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:50,040
And it was mostly aimed at schools and enterprises for obvious reasons.

129
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:54,160
They did make a free home edition that was available to anyone to download for free.

130
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:59,380
Well, now this week, we find out that Google has acquired Neverware and cloud ready with

131
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:02,960
plans to integrate it into Chrome OS.

132
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:07,840
The news was quietly announced by Neverware back on Monday afternoon, and it comes after

133
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:12,300
Google invested in a Series B funding round three years ago.

134
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:16,480
For their part, Google says we can confirm that the Neverware team is joining the Google

135
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:18,300
Chrome OS team.

136
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:22,500
As we continue to support customers with their transition to the cloud, Neverware has offered

137
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:27,360
a valuable solution, cloud ready, that allows customers to unlock the manageability, speed

138
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:30,520
and productivity of a Chrome device.

139
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:33,880
Following our partnership over the past few years, we're looking forward to working more

140
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:38,200
closely with the team to support more customers in their transition to deploy Chrome OS.

141
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,560
I bet they are.

142
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:41,600
And this sounds exactly like it is.

143
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:46,520
Neverware's cloud ready OS is based on Chromium and they've essentially recreated aspects

144
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:49,240
of Chrome OS for general PCs.

145
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:53,120
You could see why maybe schools that already had a fleet of Chromebooks and they could

146
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:57,600
take old laptops and convert those into Chromebooks and manage them with the same tools.

147
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:00,320
You can see how that could be a compelling solution.

148
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:04,520
In their FAQ, they say over the long term, cloud ready will become an official Chrome

149
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:06,920
OS offering.

150
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:08,020
That's interesting.

151
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:12,740
And they say existing customers will be upgraded seamlessly when that happens.

152
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:13,740
That's also interesting.

153
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:17,120
That does suggest a high level of integration.

154
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:22,120
It actually reads to me like Google is going to actually fully incorporate this instead

155
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:29,320
of just acquire it to perhaps get rid of competition that is taking market from new Chromebooks.

156
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:32,200
It seems like they have an eye to use this to extend to Chrome OS.

157
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:33,200
Yeah, that's interesting.

158
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:36,780
I mean, I think it is hopefully good news in the short term for Neverware users and

159
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:40,880
that they'll have tighter integration, probably faster updates and sounds like updates that

160
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:44,500
fall in line more with the official Chrome OS updates and not how Neverware was previously

161
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:45,780
doing it.

162
00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:51,720
But given our previous story, hopefully nothing changes too soon here.

163
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:55,200
Yeah, as for their part, Neverware is currently promising there'll be no changes for the free

164
00:09:55,200 --> 00:10:00,560
home edition or other support policies, but we'll be watching.

165
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:07,560
Chromebooks and Chrome OS in general are just a fascinating story over 2020 and ChromeUnboxed.com

166
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:13,000
has a hint that there may be native Steam gaming coming to Chromebooks, essentially

167
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:18,680
by parsing through commits and looking at an Ubuntu based container that's being built

168
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:21,620
out for Chrome OS.

169
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:28,000
They are coming to the conclusion that it's not just going to be Stadia or Nvidia game

170
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:33,720
streaming, but you're actually going to have Chromebooks, perhaps with Ryzen CPU and GPUs

171
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:37,600
in them very soon that are capable of playing the native video games.

172
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:38,600
Wow.

173
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:39,600
It's kind of new territory.

174
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:44,240
You know, it's from what started as a very limited purpose built OS, suddenly it has

175
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:47,960
grown a lot of new features, but it makes sense they've invested a lot in the underlying,

176
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:53,200
you know, crostini technology, the Linux containers under the hood and playing games would be

177
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,200
a great result.

178
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:55,200
And why not?

179
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:58,640
If you got the horsepower in there, you got the native Linux OS there, you can put everything

180
00:10:58,640 --> 00:10:59,820
in a container.

181
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:00,820
Why not do it?

182
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:02,040
The project is called Borealis.

183
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:04,940
We'll have a link in the show notes.

184
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:10,360
We'll see if this actually develops, but right now the rumor has it arriving mid 2021, sort

185
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:14,320
of soft rolling out as some new hardware lands for Chromebooks.

186
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:19,080
Maybe one more reason not to get your next Windows box.

187
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:20,480
Linode.com slash land.

188
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:24,640
Go there to get a $100 60 day credit towards a new account and go there to support this

189
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:25,760
here show.

190
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:28,320
Linode is our cloud server provider.

191
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:31,880
I was spending a good chunk of Friday trying out different things.

192
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:37,360
I ended up with a new Linode that I use as sort of a interstitial cloud box for my sync

193
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:39,980
thing network slash empire.

194
00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:41,240
What I do is really quite simple.

195
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:45,400
They set up a Linode $5 box, and if you go there and get our $100 credit, you can play

196
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:47,120
with something a lot more powerful than that.

197
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:52,600
But I got the $5 box and then I attached a two terabyte storage, boom, put it on there.

198
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:53,680
And I'm just experimenting right now.

199
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:57,280
I don't actually need that much storage, but again, $100 credit, right?

200
00:11:57,280 --> 00:12:01,240
So I threw that on there, put sync thing in a container and got it going.

201
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:06,320
And I'll tell you what, it actually made a nice improvement in my performance for all

202
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:07,380
of my machines.

203
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:11,120
Now they're syncing for multiple locations and at $5 a month, I think I'm going to keep

204
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,120
it.

205
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:15,280
I'll just refine the storage to exactly what I need and Linode makes it so easy to do that

206
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:16,280
on demand.

207
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:20,080
And as soon as I created the device, they gave me the commands, just copy paste them

208
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:25,280
right into the terminal to, if I wanted to, to mount it as extended for and all that really

209
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:29,800
straightforward because they make it so easy to just get in, get what you need and get

210
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:30,800
out.

211
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:31,800
And that's why I love their dashboard.

212
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:32,800
I think they really nailed that.

213
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:36,720
You know, they started in 2003, they've been around for a really long time.

214
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:42,720
It's three years before AWS and other enterprise providers, but they're independently owned.

215
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:50,260
Unlike some cloud providers that maybe have a secret investor or a rich Bezos, Linode

216
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:51,620
is independently owned.

217
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:54,100
They're the largest independent cloud provider.

218
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:55,560
How great is that?

219
00:12:55,560 --> 00:13:00,560
And while they've been coming along, they've been investing in open source projects and

220
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:06,880
get togethers like all things open, my beloved Linux fest Northwest, tons of local hackathons

221
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:07,880
and meetups.

222
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:12,920
And now here they are supporting not just this podcast, but lots of Linux content creators

223
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:17,000
that got into this for a love with, with a passion for Linux.

224
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:22,940
And now they're supporting the entire Linux ecosystem and they make a great cloud offering.

225
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:25,460
They're dedicated to offering the best and virtualized cloud computing.

226
00:13:25,460 --> 00:13:32,760
If it runs on Linux, it runs on Linode, including S3 compatible object storage, node balancers,

227
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:36,160
cloud firewalls, Kubernetes and Terraform support.

228
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:37,160
It's all there.

229
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:42,640
So go to linode.com slash LAN to try it out, get a $100 60 day credit towards a new account

230
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:44,320
and you support the show.

231
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:48,780
That's linode.com slash LAN.

232
00:13:48,780 --> 00:13:53,920
After more than four years of development, GTK 4 has finally arrived.

233
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:58,320
As you can imagine, it's a massive update and a huge milestone for the development of

234
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:04,040
the open source and cross platform GTK widget toolkit, which is widely used for creating

235
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:07,000
graphical user interfaces for Linux apps.

236
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,760
And of course for the GNOME project and the wonderful GNOME desktop.

237
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:14,920
Now for all of you out there going, um, actually Wes it's GTK plus.

238
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:17,200
Well that has changed with this release.

239
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:23,600
They're dropping the plus because really no one was saying it anyways, but they've, they've

240
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,080
really worked on this one.

241
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:29,360
There's been 20 development releases, 18,000 commits.

242
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:35,440
Now baked in is improved media playback, drake and drop support, layout managers and transform

243
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:41,160
transforms, scalable lists and grids support for shaders support for Vulkan in here, render

244
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:45,240
nodes and of course nice to see some improved accessibility overall.

245
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:52,120
There's a lot of really good stuff that developers now just get by using GTK 4 GTK 4 is now considered

246
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:57,640
stable from applications to start using importing to, but don't worry, GTK 3 will continue to

247
00:14:57,640 --> 00:15:03,240
be maintained for the foreseeable future, but GTK 2 is no longer going to be supported.

248
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:04,240
It's done.

249
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:05,320
So better upgrade.

250
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:11,100
Also just recently cute six came out and the neon project announced that there was a release

251
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:14,120
of neon that is basing around cute six now.

252
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:16,640
So we're starting to see the cute adoption for six over there.

253
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:17,820
That's really cool.

254
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:24,000
And you see the GTK 40 or I'm sorry, you see GTK 4 stuff landing right around the time

255
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,600
gnome 40 is in, in development.

256
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:31,360
So they'll likely be parts of gnome 40 that use GTK 4.

257
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:35,440
I wouldn't imagine it's all of it, but I think this is part of the reason why they changed.

258
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:40,740
If I recall the versioning of the gnome desktop is because they wanted to avoid the confusion

259
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:44,560
between GTK itself, the toolkit and the desktop gnome.

260
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:49,400
Yeah, that and well, they didn't want to have bad conceptions about what 4.0 meant because

261
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:52,440
you know, as we mentioned on the show, it's really just an evolution.

262
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:54,240
It's not a new, huge, crazy release.

263
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:57,600
It's just the next version of the release, you know?

264
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:58,600
Yeah.

265
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:02,800
Although they have been demoing a brand new activities overview and it's blowing people's

266
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:03,800
minds.

267
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:05,480
Wes, it's blowing their minds.

268
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:10,320
Well something else that was blowing people's minds was trying to find our gosh darn matrix

269
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,320
server.

270
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:15,240
It's been nice to see some upgraded support and improvements to matrix.to.

271
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:22,160
Yeah, matrix.to is a simple URL redirection service essentially, which lets users share

272
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:24,520
links to rooms and communities.

273
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:27,260
And it's not tied to any specific client.

274
00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:31,760
It kind of works as a as an entry way to get into a matrix chat.

275
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:37,920
In fact, it's often the very first experience people have with matrix.

276
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:44,660
And until there's a matrix colon slash slash URI scheme, which actually they just did recently

277
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:46,720
register with the IANA.

278
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:47,720
So that's exciting.

279
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:48,720
That's awesome.

280
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:53,080
matrix.to is pretty much the only client agnostic way to link to content in matrix.

281
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:56,060
And that's pretty important because while it's great that you can use whatever client

282
00:16:56,060 --> 00:16:59,400
you want with matrix, it makes it a little bit more difficult for onboarding.

283
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:03,820
You don't say just go get Discord, you say, well, learn about what matrix is and go figure

284
00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:07,200
out that there's multiple clients and then without knowing anything about it, decide

285
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:11,000
which clients right for you pick that install it and then you can use our server.

286
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Yeah.

287
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:16,080
And they've they've kind of come up with a way to present this information now in a much

288
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:19,760
more consumable way for end users.

289
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:25,120
And they have spent a lot of time reworking this from scratch to help users find the best

290
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:27,120
client to get started.

291
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:31,480
Also you can have it optionally remember your choices for future visits.

292
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:35,960
And it will get full useful previews in the selection screens, you get an idea of what

293
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:37,280
you are going into.

294
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:42,960
And I think this is more and more important as over 2020, I have seen a lot of open source

295
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:46,560
projects adopt matrix for their group chat.

296
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:51,560
And it's nice because it sort of has slowed what I have seen as a bleeding to slack, which

297
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:54,800
has never felt like a great fit for open source projects.

298
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:57,760
And to see more and more pickup matrix, that's wonderful.

299
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:02,320
But now, as we've discovered firsthand, how do you get people into those rooms?

300
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:03,320
Right.

301
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:07,120
The feature there is great, it's a good experience, but it can be a little bit tricky.

302
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:08,120
Yeah.

303
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:10,120
And it's not like IRC is simple, but it's been around forever.

304
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:15,280
So people know, OK, I need an IRC client and I need to slash join and you can go Google

305
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:18,920
the command syntax real quick if you don't remember how to change your password or anything

306
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:19,920
like that.

307
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:20,920
But matrix is still pretty new.

308
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:24,480
And so they have an opportunity here to make this onboarding process a little bit simpler.

309
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:26,160
And I think this is going to help.

310
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:31,800
And I'm looking forward to us making it simpler to link to our colony at jupyterbroadcasting.com

311
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:32,800
matrix server.

312
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:35,960
You know, I was trying this out last night and it works pretty nicely.

313
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:36,960
It was a good experience.

314
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:38,840
It's nice to see them investing.

315
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:41,000
And in case you're worried, it is privacy preserving.

316
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
They've thought of that.

317
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,440
No information stored on the server side, all the calculations done just in client side

318
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:46,440
JavaScript.

319
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:47,440
So don't have to worry about that.

320
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:50,680
It's funny, too, that this started out as just a sort of minimal viable product.

321
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:51,680
You know, oh, here's a quick idea.

322
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:53,060
Now you can link to rooms.

323
00:18:53,060 --> 00:18:54,360
It could have remained that way.

324
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:58,560
But you know, thanks to actual time and effort here, we've got a much better product and

325
00:18:58,560 --> 00:18:59,860
I love it.

326
00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:01,000
Another area that's getting some work.

327
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,840
I mean, it's totally, totally proof of concept.

328
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:11,500
But they have introduced over at Matrix a possible a possible social network that lives

329
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:14,040
on top of Matrix.

330
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:20,380
It's called Cerulean and it's kind of like a Twitter or mastodon that is using underpinnings

331
00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:22,440
of Matrix chat rooms.

332
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:25,920
I don't know why, but I kind of like it.

333
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:31,200
Well, I think it's just an interesting attempt to stretch the capabilities of Matrix, right?

334
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:35,000
To see, can you build a system like this given the primitives that you have?

335
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:39,200
Because as much as Matrix is, you know, something we see as a client facing user, just chatting

336
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:43,880
with the folks in our community, really, it's this this whole rich ecosystem of protocols

337
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:46,960
that you can use to work together to build all kinds of things.

338
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:51,280
And one of the things they've been working on here is more arbitrary nested threading

339
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:52,280
support.

340
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:56,160
They've done potential improvements that they've only implemented so far in dendrite, which

341
00:19:56,160 --> 00:20:00,620
is the up and coming rust based home server that has a lot of exciting new features, perhaps

342
00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:02,600
like this, where it's getting tried out.

343
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:07,080
So if you want to go play with it, you can view it online or you can even register.

344
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:09,520
They've got their own test dendrite server running.

345
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:13,160
And then right now, the only test instance of Cerulean is talking to that.

346
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:15,520
You know, this is your Linux action news pro tip here.

347
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:19,880
But if Matrix is one of those topics you kind of been avoiding, I don't need anything else.

348
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:21,440
IRC is fine or whatever.

349
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:25,160
Maybe maybe maybe 2021 is the year to start taking it seriously.

350
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:27,840
There's some really awesome free software getting developed here.

351
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:30,840
And there's a lot of great communities that are collecting over there doesn't take anything

352
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:33,000
away from any of the other great places.

353
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:37,320
And you know, with all the bridges, Matrix is not too bad to be a part of because you

354
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:39,240
can connect to a lot of other communities.

355
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:40,240
That's a great point.

356
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:44,240
One other interesting aspect that they're playing with as a way to perhaps change or

357
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:47,740
improve the matrix platform is decentralized reputation, right?

358
00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:50,760
How do you one one problem in some of these decentralized communities is, well, how do

359
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:55,960
you manage problematic users, spams, trolls, that can be difficult.

360
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:59,800
There's some ideas, the Matrix folks have put out a blog post and some videos talking

361
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:03,920
about some of their ideas, and maybe Cerulean will be the first place that you see those

362
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:04,920
attempted.

363
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:08,320
Yeah, it could be really kind of a decent way to solve that problem.

364
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:10,980
And you know, you could just avoid certain types of topics.

365
00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:14,320
If that's your preference, you don't have to avoid people, you could avoid topics.

366
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:16,240
Or the opposite is true.

367
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:19,400
If there's a certain topic you're particularly interested in, I think you could probably

368
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:24,480
find it a little easier, indeed.

369
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:25,560
Linux dot ting dot com.

370
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:27,760
The next generation of ting mobile is here.

371
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:32,120
So go see how much you could save and get twenty five dollars off at Linux dot ting

372
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:33,120
dot com.

373
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:40,600
I have been a customer of ting for over eight years, and now I can tell you is the best

374
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:45,880
time ever to sign up for ting to go to Linux dot ting dot com and see what I'm talking

375
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:46,880
about.

376
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:50,680
And if you want to talk in text, you can get that for just ten dollars a month.

377
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:54,440
Yeah, and data plans, they start at fifteen dollars and they have unlimited plans start

378
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:55,440
forty five dollars.

379
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:56,440
How about that?

380
00:21:56,440 --> 00:22:00,200
So if you use two gigs, twenty gigs, hundred gigs, there's going to be a perfect ting plan

381
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:01,600
for you and your family.

382
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:02,600
Don't worry.

383
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:03,600
Don't worry.

384
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:05,840
The only thing that's changing here is lower monthly prices.

385
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:11,240
You still get access to ting's award winning customer service with nationwide LTE and 5G

386
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:13,400
coverage and no contracts ever.

387
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:18,480
You can pretty much take care of everything through ting's dashboard, really dang near

388
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:22,880
everything in a way that sets the bar above what every other carrier allows you to do.

389
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:31,000
But twice in eight years, I have had to call in one time when I was on the road and struggling

390
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,960
to get a my fi that I bought off Amazon working.

391
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:37,560
They had no reason to stay on the phone with me for as long as they did, but two hours

392
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:41,680
later and really them just trying out out everything they could.

393
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:44,800
We actually had it up and running and I had connectivity on the road.

394
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:45,800
I couldn't believe it.

395
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:49,180
I mean, the rep really invested in solving my problem.

396
00:22:49,180 --> 00:22:51,240
That is sticking around.

397
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:55,400
But now you can choose from three different plans based on your data needs.

398
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:56,640
It's simple to switch to ting.

399
00:22:56,640 --> 00:23:00,900
So you just had to Linux dot ting dot com and check your current phone.

400
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:03,240
Pretty much any phone will work on ting.

401
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:06,880
You create an account, you pick the plan that's right for you and the fam or just you.

402
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:09,000
And I don't know, I don't judge your whole crew.

403
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,320
I don't know how you do.

404
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:11,860
And then ting will send you the SIM card.

405
00:23:11,860 --> 00:23:14,760
You pop it in your phone and you get going.

406
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:17,960
Cutting your phone bill in half has never been easier with ting's mobile with ting's

407
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:20,000
new mobile plans.

408
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:25,440
You can get talk and text or ten dollars a month and data plans starting at 15 and 25

409
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:27,200
and then unlimited for 45.

410
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:28,480
You just got to get the right one for you.

411
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:30,720
It'll be all explained on the ting website.

412
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:31,720
This is great.

413
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:36,200
After eight years, I can say this truly is the next generation of ting mobile.

414
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:37,200
It's here.

415
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:39,760
Go see how much you could save and get twenty five dollars off.

416
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:41,880
Visit Linux dot ting dot com.

417
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:45,120
And a big thank you to ting for sponsoring this show and making it possible for independent

418
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:47,720
media to put their content out there for free.

419
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:52,200
And thanks to everybody who visits Linux dot ting dot com.

420
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:57,520
Google's AMP, previously known as accelerated mobile pages, took a beating this week as

421
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:02,920
an antitrust lawsuit filed by the attorney general of Texas charges that the ad company

422
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:05,720
used AMP to hinder competition.

423
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:10,920
And on Friday, Terence Eden, a prominent member of the AMP Advisory Committee, which was formed

424
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:15,640
two years ago in response to criticism that the AMP project ignored publisher concerns,

425
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:19,960
announced his resignation, citing the project's failure to make the Web better.

426
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:25,720
Yeah, AMP was created by Google in 2015 with the public argument that it was designed to

427
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:31,000
make the mobile Web load faster and essentially as a defense against things like the Apple

428
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,540
news format and Facebook instant articles.

429
00:24:33,540 --> 00:24:37,560
But the technology has had its detractors almost since its inception.

430
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:40,820
And over time, that has just grown louder and louder.

431
00:24:40,820 --> 00:24:47,400
So by 2018, Google attempted to satisfy some of these critics by broadening the governance

432
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:48,760
of AMP.

433
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:52,800
And they said we would bring it beyond just Google employees.

434
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:56,940
It would be more like a true open source project.

435
00:24:56,940 --> 00:25:02,160
But any goodwill Google may have won with those actions could be undone if these claims

436
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:05,520
about AMP and the new complaint prove true.

437
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:09,600
For some context here, after the complaint was made public, Robin Bergeon, VP of data

438
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:13,520
governance at The New York Times, said on Twitter that, every time I point out that

439
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:18,280
AMP is bad, someone from Google will tell me it's not.

440
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:23,000
This new complaint indicates that Google has documented exactly how bad AMP is and ties

441
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:26,280
it to a deliberate play to prevent competition from header bidding.

442
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:32,440
Now, that is interesting because it gets into some potential foul play attempts in the web

443
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:33,440
ad market.

444
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:35,120
But the complaint goes further than that.

445
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:40,520
Yeah, the complaint also claims that Google's transfer of AMP to the OpenJS Foundation doesn't

446
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:44,840
really change the company's capacity to control the project because, quote, Google controls

447
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:48,100
the foundation's board and debates internally.

448
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:52,320
It also alleges that Google falsely told publishers that adopting AMP would enhance load times

449
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:58,800
and that the company went so far as to hinder non-AMP ads by giving them artificial one-second

450
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:02,240
delays to convince publishers not to use header bidding.

451
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:03,240
That doesn't sound good.

452
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:05,240
No, not fair at all.

453
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:06,880
But again, these are allegations.

454
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:08,200
We don't know if that's true.

455
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:09,200
True, true.

456
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:13,360
The AMP committee member who resigned in his post, which we do have linked in the show

457
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:18,240
notes, said that he joined because the stated goal of the committee was to make AMP a great

458
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:20,000
web citizen.

459
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:24,720
But he then went on to say, I'm concerned that despite the hard work of the AMP committee,

460
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:27,800
Google has limited interest in that goal.

461
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:30,640
I think that's the crux of the issue here.

462
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:34,800
It's tricky because AMP on its own, just on technical grounds, is kind of controversial.

463
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:38,560
And I can see how reasonable people might come down either way on if it's a good thing

464
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:39,560
or not.

465
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:43,480
But all of Google's involvement here, you just can't separate that out.

466
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:46,440
I mean, to this day, there's still only two caches.

467
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:47,440
That's Google's and Bing's.

468
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:49,960
And Bing's is actually still pretty recently added.

469
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:53,080
So it's hard to argue that Google's not really pulling the strings.

470
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:57,400
And even if you want to make AMP great for everyone, it doesn't seem like they're that

471
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:58,880
interested, unfortunately.

472
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:05,080
AWS is trying to show them up by supporting the Blender project.

473
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:09,880
They note that, quote, we are excited to continue to expand our support of open source solutions

474
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:13,240
for our customers in the digital content creation space.

475
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:15,880
That was the GM of Creative Tools at AWS.

476
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:20,000
Also, it looks like the Blender Foundation will start recruiting throughout the course

477
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:25,640
of 2021, pending current travel and meeting restrictions being lifted or relaxed.

478
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:31,760
AWS committed to a period of three years for this support and specifically to support character

479
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:35,680
animation tools development, which is something the Blender has been working on with a new

480
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:39,520
character animation system dubbed Animation 2020.

481
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:45,240
And it seems like some folks at AWS like industry veteran Jason Schleifler, creative director

482
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:48,880
there, are quite interested in seeing this continuing to develop.

483
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:52,040
Why do you suppose they have interest in something like Blender?

484
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:54,840
Are people uploading Blender projects to the cloud?

485
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:56,580
So yes, actually.

486
00:27:56,580 --> 00:28:01,800
Some folks do use AWS for media and content creation, including rendering big renders

487
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:04,400
on cloud powerhouse boxes.

488
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:09,000
And it sounds like with things like AWS ThinkBox and other digital content creation, it's an

489
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,920
area AWS is looking to explore.

490
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:13,920
So that is fascinating.

491
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:14,920
Didn't expect that.

492
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:19,240
I think I've also seen that there is and I don't really fully appreciate it, but there

493
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:23,800
is some working with with AI models of some type in Blender as well.

494
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:25,680
That might also be an interest of AWS.

495
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:29,920
Well, you know, it has definitely been an interest of some other past supporters like

496
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:38,200
Microsoft and Facebook, both who specifically mentioned training AR or AI models with Blender.

497
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:39,360
Microsoft's case is actually kind of interesting.

498
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:42,960
They're taking data and then building synthetic training data with these.

499
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:47,360
They're making human models, moving the models around and then using that as training data

500
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:48,760
for their AI systems.

501
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:49,760
Crazy.

502
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:50,760
That is really wild.

503
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:56,960
Yeah, they, Microsoft joined the Blender Development Fund on July 29th of this year.

504
00:28:56,960 --> 00:29:01,060
Unity joined the Blender Development Fund as well on August 21st.

505
00:29:01,060 --> 00:29:04,560
And Facebook joined this year on November 19th.

506
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:07,960
And they say here, part of that, Facebook has been building tools that help artists

507
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:13,240
turn their Blender creations into engaging AR experiences in Spark AR.

508
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:20,160
So a lot of different motivations coming together to back the Blender Foundation, which means

509
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:22,600
they have a decent amount of cash coming in now.

510
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:24,560
Yeah, they sure do.

511
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:34,400
$155,567 is a monthly contribution from 5,283 individuals and 53 corporate backers.

512
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:39,960
They get 33% of their income from individual sponsors, 28 just from Epic Games, hey, what

513
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:40,960
a patron that is.

514
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:41,960
No kidding.

515
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:44,880
And then 27% from other corporate sponsors.

516
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:46,440
And what do they do with that money?

517
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:50,920
Well, primarily they pay salaries for people to develop Blender along with other support

518
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:52,240
for the project.

519
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:56,220
This is really fascinating to see because we've always talked about what does it take

520
00:29:56,220 --> 00:30:02,120
to develop a truly industrial grade tool in the audio visual space.

521
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:04,060
And now we're seeing, I mean, it takes staff.

522
00:30:04,060 --> 00:30:11,200
It takes funding and it takes market momentum to really build a tool at this scale.

523
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:15,400
And I'm really impressed to just watch Blender go.

524
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:16,400
It's amazing.

525
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:19,840
And I think it is really an open source success story in the best case of, we figured out

526
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:25,400
that in this case, right, a good open source 3D modeling program is better as open source

527
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:29,760
shared infrastructure than it is in having competing proprietary applications, like tons

528
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:31,900
of companies and individuals need this stuff.

529
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:33,080
Let's all work on it together.

530
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:37,000
Well, that open source Goombaya brings us to the end of this week's podcast, but go
