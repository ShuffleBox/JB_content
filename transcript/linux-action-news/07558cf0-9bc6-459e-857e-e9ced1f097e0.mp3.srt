00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,360
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, episode 118, recorded on August 9, 2019.

2
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:10,360
I'm Chris.

3
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:11,360
And I'm Joe.

4
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:12,360
Hello, Joe.

5
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:17,320
It's good to be connected with you a little early this week, but we already have a packed

6
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:21,200
news list and we start with some big news from NVIDIA.

7
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:27,600
I genuinely did a double take when I saw this, NVIDIA publishing GPU hardware documentation

8
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:30,240
that's actually going to help the Nuvo driver.

9
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:31,240
Surely not.

10
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:36,560
Veronica's got a quote from NVIDIA and the direct quote reads, NVIDIA has released public,

11
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:43,120
freely available, that's a MIT licensed, documentations and portions of its GPU hardware interface.

12
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:48,360
This is a work in progress and not all interfaces have been published.

13
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:54,180
Now the background on this is this has been a multi-year undertaking that's just now starting

14
00:00:54,180 --> 00:01:00,240
to see fruits of labor hit GitHub and that was years of getting the licensing in order,

15
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:02,000
at least according to NVIDIA.

16
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:08,360
The documentation made public at this point primarily covers the Maxwell, Pascal, Volta

17
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:12,000
and Kepler generations of NVIDIA graphics.

18
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,400
Obviously there's some more later generation graphics that aren't yet in there and there's

19
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:19,160
no word on when we might see documentation on that.

20
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:23,240
So I'm not going to be running my RTX 2080 with totally free drivers and getting the

21
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:25,560
same frame rates as the proprietary one just yet then.

22
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:29,000
Well, no, but that's mostly because you don't have an RTX 2080.

23
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,640
So that also is.

24
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:35,520
So the initial documentation, just to just so you kind of have an idea of what to expect,

25
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:41,040
it really just covers the BIOS tables, the device control block, device initialization,

26
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:47,320
the security around the Falcon engine, also documentation on memory clocking, tweaking,

27
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:52,540
shader program headers, power states, which could be great for laptops and some other

28
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:53,840
various bits.

29
00:01:53,840 --> 00:02:00,200
It's not necessarily exhaustive documentation, but coming from nothing, it's substantially

30
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:03,860
more than anything we've ever seen out of NVIDIA ever.

31
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:05,880
So it is substantial in that sense.

32
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:06,880
Yeah.

33
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:11,920
My read on it is that it's a big step and it's going to be very helpful for the nouveau

34
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:16,640
developers, but it's not anywhere near where we are with AMD.

35
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:18,840
Yeah, I think that's a fair assessment.

36
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:23,120
And there's a hurdle right now that the nouveau projects working on to try to make life easier

37
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:27,520
for laptop users or people that want to run systems in lower power modes.

38
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:32,320
There's an issue where they need to talk to the firmware in a certain way to reclock the

39
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:37,660
GPU speed and make things run a little slower and they can't get past the signed firmware.

40
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:43,340
The documentation does nothing to address that, which is a current sore spot for the

41
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:44,680
project right now.

42
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:47,660
It would have been great to see something to help with that, but I think that's a much

43
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:49,920
more complex issue.

44
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:54,040
So it's a good first step, but it's not going to get us parity with the proprietary driver

45
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:55,040
just yet.

46
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:59,880
Well, it'll take a little bit of time to get there, but hopefully we will eventually.

47
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:06,100
And it's taken quite a while to get ZFS on route on the Ubuntu desktop, but it looks

48
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:08,600
like in 1910, we're finally going to get that.

49
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:14,760
Yeah, over on the ubuntu.com blog, they write, we're going to enhance ZFS on route support

50
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:16,560
in the coming cycles.

51
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:20,220
Ubuntu 1910 is a first round towards this goal.

52
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:27,160
We want to support ZFS on route as an experimental installer option, initially for the desktop,

53
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:31,380
but keeping the layout extensible for the server later on, hint, hint, hint, perhaps

54
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:33,400
maybe in the next major release.

55
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:37,960
The desktop will be the first beneficiary starting in Ubuntu 1910.

56
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:42,360
Keep in mind though, they are calling this quote experimental and they want you to know

57
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:43,360
it.

58
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:48,200
Yeah, they're saying don't put any data on there that you haven't got backed up essentially.

59
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:53,120
But with ZFS on route comes a whole bunch of features that are so useful.

60
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:57,460
Yeah, there's several different kinds of system recovery options that could play around with.

61
00:03:57,460 --> 00:04:02,440
And it makes sense to work these things out in the 1910 release cycle because perhaps

62
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:06,600
you'd have something fairly robust by the time 2004 comes around, which is the next

63
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:07,600
LTS.

64
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:12,220
And they were writing that in that same blog post that they've shipped ZFS on the next

65
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:18,880
version 8.1, which features native encryption, trimming support, checkpoints, encrypted ZFS,

66
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:23,960
transmissions, quota support, performance improvements, and then they've taken the next step and made

67
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:27,120
sure that grub supports booting ZFS from route as well.

68
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:31,560
So it's a modern implementation of ZFS on Linux if you were going to do it.

69
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:37,780
They write about it in a way that to me, because I view it as somebody who's been using ZFS

70
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:42,140
on Linux in production for a little bit now, they write it as if it's never been done

71
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:45,240
before and the canonical is taking the first steps.

72
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:50,640
But when you consider the massive amount of users, when they do manage to deploy it in

73
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:55,880
their LTS version that will adopt it, I understand their very cautious approach.

74
00:04:55,880 --> 00:05:01,120
But I'm here on the shores of ZFS on Linux saying, come join us friends over canonical.

75
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,120
It works great.

76
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:07,600
Well, I've never deployed ZFS on my root partition before, but I think once 1910 comes out, I'll

77
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:11,000
give it a good go and give it a thorough test.

78
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,480
I think it should be fine.

79
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:13,480
Yeah.

80
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:17,840
As much as I am come join us on the shores of ZFS guy right now, I think that's actually

81
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:23,480
the reasonable way to go is wait for 1910 to ship, try it on a test system.

82
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:27,920
And if I'm honest with you, if you look at my laptops these days, extended four, my desktop's

83
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:30,280
extended four or XFS.

84
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:34,960
And even I think the boot partition on our NAS here, I think that might be extended four,

85
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:35,960
maybe XFS.

86
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:40,760
And then all of the data sits on a ZFS side of this.

87
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:42,640
And that's how I tend to deploy it.

88
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:47,300
On root is nice because it gives you certain recovery options if an update goes awry or

89
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:48,300
something like that.

90
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:54,000
So it gives you additional resiliency once the technology has really fully been integrated

91
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,400
and all the different edge cases have been accounted for.

92
00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:00,620
It's funny that already I'm seeing people bring up the licensing issue again.

93
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:05,600
And if they could ship it in the server version, okay, not as a default installation option,

94
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:12,760
but still it was there, you'd think that they'd be fine, but I think putting it in the desktop

95
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:14,940
version is going to shine another light on that.

96
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:20,080
And so we may possibly see some more controversy, but I don't think they're going to end up

97
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,800
with any legal issues with it.

98
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:26,140
I think their legal department have gone over this top to bottom and they obviously think

99
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:27,140
they're fine.

100
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:28,140
I have two thoughts on it.

101
00:06:28,140 --> 00:06:32,320
So Canonical writes in their blog post, three years ago, we spent time looking at the licensing,

102
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:35,280
which applies to Linux kernel and to ZFS.

103
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:40,480
Our conclusions are that we are acting within the rights granted and compliance for both

104
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:41,920
licenses.

105
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:44,080
So that's Canonical's position.

106
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:50,100
And I have a sense that the position of the organizations and groups behind ZFS are keen

107
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:51,100
to see it deployed.

108
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:57,580
They'd like to see it be the universal file system across all major operating systems.

109
00:06:57,580 --> 00:07:02,520
And so I don't think they're likely to do anything to shut it down.

110
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:06,480
Everybody always likes to cite Oracle, but times have changed, things have moved on,

111
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:10,640
and there's many other players now involved in the development of ZFS.

112
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:17,880
And I think to the benefit of that group, the more users of ZFS, the more funding, attention,

113
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:20,680
development, all of that, that the overall file system gets.

114
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:21,680
So it's a win-win.

115
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:25,720
Surely, if anything, it would come from the other side, the GPL side, because that's really

116
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:27,040
where the restrictions are, right?

117
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:28,240
Yeah, I could see that.

118
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:32,760
I'm not sure who on the GPL side would have an appetite for a fight of that scale.

119
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:34,200
Well, yeah, that's the thing.

120
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:37,640
I don't think there is anyone on either side who really wants the fight.

121
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:43,880
And maybe these licenses are incompatible, but I just don't think anyone wants the stress

122
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:47,120
of trying to test that in court or even out of court.

123
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:52,280
I think the crux of Canonical's argument is they've taken ZFS.ko, the kernel extension,

124
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:55,860
and they've made it a self-contained file system module.

125
00:07:55,860 --> 00:08:01,060
So it's not a derivative work of the Linux kernel, and it's obviously a derivative work

126
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:02,860
of Opens at FS.

127
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:06,740
And I think that's their argument, but yeah, you're right.

128
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:08,620
It could come up again.

129
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:12,560
My sense is that people that do this for a living have looked into it and determined

130
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:13,600
it's a safe bet.

131
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:20,360
And I wouldn't be surprised if we don't really see any legal action taken.

132
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:24,520
I think right now the name of the game is market share for ZFS.

133
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:28,840
But all that said, I don't think we'll be seeing it in Fedora or RHEL any time soon

134
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:29,840
somehow.

135
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:35,640
No, although funny enough, it's surprisingly easy to get it working in CentOS, RHEL, and

136
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:36,640
Fedora.

137
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:43,080
In fact, the upstream project makes packages available, and it's just a couple of minutes

138
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:46,700
of effort to get fully baked ZFS support on Red Hat.

139
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:51,660
And some of the largest Linux deployments of ZFS on Linux are on CentOS and Red Hat

140
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:52,660
systems.

141
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:55,880
It's just not right there in the installer, you have to jump through a couple of little

142
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:56,880
hoops.

143
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:59,640
It's a little interesting, awkward position that Red Hat's in, and you can understand

144
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:03,960
why perhaps they are building Stratus, because they can see the demand from their customers.

145
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,640
Oh, yeah, definitely.

146
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:07,440
Last week, we talked about Free Office.

147
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:13,920
Well, this week, the Document Foundation is very proud to announce LibreOffice 6.3.

148
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:16,400
And the name of this game appears to be performance, Joe.

149
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:19,620
Yeah, we can link to a blog post about LibreOffice 6.3.

150
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:25,360
And they've got some charts there that show, quite frankly, astonishing performance improvements

151
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:28,500
with Writer and with Calc.

152
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:32,260
In fact, they were so astonishing that we did a little investigation behind the scenes

153
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:37,000
to try to figure out if these numbers were possibly not legitimate, and it looks like

154
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
they check out.

155
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,300
Yeah, we got our crack research team on it, and it turned out to be various bug fixes

156
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:48,100
that have done this, so it is all legit, which means this is huge news in terms of competitiveness

157
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:49,100
for LibreOffice.

158
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:54,760
For me, I've never had any problem with the speed of it, but maybe other people have,

159
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:55,760
I don't know.

160
00:09:55,760 --> 00:10:00,760
And I can't conceive of it being particularly quicker on a quick machine, but maybe on lower-end

161
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:03,320
machines, it might be more noticeable.

162
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:09,280
But either way, this is seriously good in terms of competing with the proprietary alternatives.

163
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:10,760
Absolutely.

164
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:12,240
And I noticed a speed improvement.

165
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,240
I tried it out.

166
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:14,240
I noticed.

167
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:16,680
It feels as fast as Free Office now.

168
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:20,880
One of my notes when I tried out Free Office recently to talk about it on the show was

169
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:24,120
that it felt lightweight and faster than LibreOffice.

170
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:28,020
When these numbers first came out, literally, our conversation internally when we were discussing

171
00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:31,160
covering this story was, these numbers can't be legitimate.

172
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:34,840
And when Joseph, our crack research team, checked it out, we're not kidding.

173
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:39,380
We went and did research, and you can map bug fix to performance improvement, bug fix

174
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:40,980
to performance improvement.

175
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:44,640
And it's just one of the reasons I love covering free software, because you can do that.

176
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:48,400
You can actually see the contributions directly that made a difference.

177
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:52,200
And LibreOffice 6.3 represents a lot of that hard work.

178
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:56,480
Not only performance improvements, though, but they've improved a couple of aspects that

179
00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:00,960
make running LibreOffice as your only office suite, like your entire enterprise can use

180
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,720
LibreOffice.

181
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,960
They've made improvements for that type of work set.

182
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:10,220
And I think that's pretty important, too, including types of PDF exports that are required

183
00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:13,280
by certain regulations.

184
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:18,880
And they've also improved the redaction support in documents and change tracking, and compatibility

185
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:20,600
with proprietary file formats.

186
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:26,360
LibreOffice, for me, is one of those flagship FOSS projects, or products, even, really,

187
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:33,400
that are a big part of converting an organization over to open source, and ultimately, hopefully,

188
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:34,400
Linux.

189
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:36,400
We always talk about that strategy, don't we?

190
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:39,760
First of all, you switch out the applications, and then you switch out the platform underneath

191
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:40,760
that.

192
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:42,720
And we need to stay competitive.

193
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:48,280
And it is so great to see LibreOffice doing this work, squashing these bugs, making these

194
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:51,840
improvements, and similarly with Firefox, as well.

195
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:57,380
Because realistically, these days, a lot of offices, a lot of enterprise, really needs

196
00:11:57,380 --> 00:11:59,480
a web browser and an office suite.

197
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:04,760
And once they've got those core applications, it's easier to build the rest of the stuff

198
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:05,760
that they need on top of that.

199
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:08,600
Trevor Burrus I think also, not just that traditional reason

200
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:16,080
why it's really important, but as the market more and more shifts to cloud-hosted everything,

201
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:20,440
and over time, Microsoft will shift their focus more and more to their online office

202
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:21,440
suite.

203
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:25,100
You see Google Docs is just catching on like wildfire everywhere.

204
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:32,040
It's really nice to see a completely free, feature-rich office suite that is continuing

205
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:36,860
to get competitive upgrades that make it enterprise grade.

206
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:41,640
And that, I think, is going to be even more important, as perhaps some of the commercial

207
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:46,720
solutions begin to focus less and less on their actual desktop applications, and focus

208
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:50,640
more on their cloud solutions, because that won't work for everybody.

209
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:55,280
And for the people that are left behind when that transition is made, LibreOffice is going

210
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:57,280
to be a fantastic option.

211
00:12:57,280 --> 00:13:00,620
Peter Bell Yeah, I mean, I use Google Docs for some stuff.

212
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:04,440
But for things that I don't want Google to know about, that's where LibreOffice comes

213
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:05,440
into play.

214
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:07,640
For those things you don't want Google to know.

215
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:08,920
Peter Bell Yeah, exactly.

216
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:14,840
For things that I want to keep on my LAN, or possibly share privately with people, anything

217
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:19,040
that's in Google Docs, I consider it essentially public, really.

218
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:24,440
So I think it's very important to have this software that you can run completely, you

219
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:29,720
can disconnect your network cable, and you can still use LibreOffice completely perfectly.

220
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:33,680
You can use all the functions of it, whereas good luck with Google Docs trying to do that.

221
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:37,000
Peter Bell Yeah, even if you're on your Samsung DeX.

222
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:48,100
Peter

223
00:13:48,100 --> 00:14:15,840
Right.

224
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:22,060
When you still get the traditional DeX arrangement, if you want to get a USB-C to HDMI cable,

225
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:27,120
you could still hook DeX up to a screen and then get a Bluetooth mouse and keyboard and

226
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:31,080
use DeX in the traditional sense that we've talked about it before.

227
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:37,320
This is now adding the ability to remote control the DeX environment from another machine,

228
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:39,660
I assume, on the same LAN.

229
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:41,720
They haven't given us those details yet.

230
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:46,480
But this remote session also lets you drag and drop files from the desktop and to the

231
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:47,480
phone.

232
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:52,800
So I guess in theory, you could sit down at a proprietary desktop workstation, open up

233
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:56,680
your DeX environment, get your job done, and then when you go back to your desk, you would

234
00:14:56,680 --> 00:15:02,840
plug into a dock of some kind and have your native DeX environment right there on a screen.

235
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:08,760
So it's sort of another, I guess, way to take advantage of a screen and keyboard.

236
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:12,360
You probably find a lot of systems that are sitting there running an operating system.

237
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:15,600
You could just, with a perfectly good mouse and keyboard and screen, just take over it

238
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:16,600
and run DeX.

239
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:18,440
It's kind of cool, I guess.

240
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:24,280
I think giving people the ability to run it on top of an existing operating system on

241
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:30,240
a laptop is going to make this much more likely to succeed than having to mess around plugging

242
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:33,320
in external peripherals because who even has a screen?

243
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:37,800
Okay, I'm looking at one huge screen and you're looking at about 20 in your studio there.

244
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:38,800
I need more screens, Joe.

245
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:39,800
I need more.

246
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:40,800
I need more.

247
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,920
Yeah, get the VR headset on and get a few more.

248
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:45,080
But most people just have a laptop, right?

249
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:46,080
Yeah, exactly.

250
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:47,560
And that's where this does make sense.

251
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:55,120
I think the problem I'm having is I've watched Samsung bounce this DeX idea around for a

252
00:15:55,120 --> 00:16:01,000
long time now, even before they were really calling it DeX, and I'm still not clicking

253
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
with it.

254
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:08,920
It feels like I would be the target user, a nice high-end Android phone with a portable

255
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:13,200
Linux environment that can run on physical hardware or remote on another system.

256
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:18,320
I mean, that really seems like it'd be my wheelhouse and for some reason, not doing

257
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:19,700
it for me, Joe.

258
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:25,920
Maybe in the age of long battery life laptops and tablets, I just don't see a need for it.

259
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:33,280
If I had only one machine and it was a Note 10 or a Note 10 Plus, come on, let's be honest,

260
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:36,720
then maybe I see it, but guys, that seems like a niche.

261
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:41,880
Well, maybe if instead of including a giant stylus in the body of the phone, they just

262
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:45,000
put a tiny little headphone jack, I might be willing to buy it.

263
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
No, there's no room, Joe.

264
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
No, there's no room.

265
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Yeah.

266
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Yeah.

267
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Who even uses that stylus?

268
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
I'm just so annoyed.

269
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,920
I'm so annoyed by this.

270
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:56,560
This was the last holdout of the headphone jack and now it's gone.

271
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:57,560
It's glorious.

272
00:16:57,560 --> 00:16:58,560
It's glorious.

273
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:03,240
As an iPhone user since the iPhone 7, I have been waiting for this day.

274
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:08,560
But as for who's going to use this, I think you might be right.

275
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:12,640
It's a solution looking for a problem that it seems doesn't really exist anymore.

276
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:16,920
I think when we first started to hear of this a couple of years ago, if they'd managed to

277
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:23,000
execute on it perfectly immediately then, then maybe it would have taken off, but with

278
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:27,320
devices like the iPad Pro coming out and as you say, light laptops that have got huge

279
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:30,820
battery lives, it just seems a bit too late really.

280
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:35,980
It could have been more practical maybe if the industry had focused on battery life and

281
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:44,320
additional CPU power and focused less on size and weight and edge to edge glass.

282
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:48,800
If these things were really powerful, like at a level that was beyond what they are right

283
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:54,140
now and the battery would run well and last a while and it wouldn't overheat, then I would

284
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:58,520
think, okay, this is a machine that's capable of delivering an environment I want, but right

285
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:04,200
now when I think of a ultra thin note 10 plus running a desktop environment, I think of

286
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:08,880
a phone that's probably pulling more power than a wireless charger could even probably

287
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:09,880
provide.

288
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:15,480
It's hot to the touch when I pick it up and it's likely going to be laggy.

289
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:21,400
I don't know that to be, and I'd love to be proved otherwise, but that's what I envision

290
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:25,320
when I think of this product and there's just better solutions now.

291
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:26,480
I think that's just what it is.

292
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:31,720
There's just better solutions and this dream, this dream never really took hold.

293
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:32,720
Yeah.

294
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:36,360
Well, all that said, if they want to send me one for free, I'll happily play with it,

295
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:40,040
but I'm not shelling out over a thousand quid for it somehow.

296
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:41,040
No way.

297
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:42,560
Not unless it's running Harmony OS.

298
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:44,120
That's what I'm holding out for.

299
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:45,120
Yeah.

300
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:50,320
So Huawei have been teasing this for a long time, but they actually did an announcement

301
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:56,880
today as we record and this looks like quite an interesting operating system to me.

302
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:57,880
Yeah.

303
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:59,480
They're coming in really strong.

304
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:03,400
They're dropping phrases like we could switch immediately from Android if we needed to.

305
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:07,360
It's the OS we need to address future challenges.

306
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:14,280
One platform for all devices from smart speakers to wearables and phones in between.

307
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:19,340
It's Harmony OS and it's been in development for really several years and there's been

308
00:19:19,340 --> 00:19:20,340
lots of rumors.

309
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:23,360
We've seen some of them come in and we've been like, well, let's keep an eye on that,

310
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:25,020
but we're not going to cover it.

311
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:30,080
And now at the Huawei Developer Conference, they finally shared some of the early details

312
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:32,960
about Harmony OS.

313
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:39,800
Now what we do know is that it's a microkernel-based system like Google's Fuchsia OS, unlike Linux,

314
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:43,640
and they claim the use of this microkernel is at the heart of what makes it possible

315
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:49,240
to run across all devices and makes it more secure because, quote, it provides the most

316
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:56,260
basic services like thread scheduling and IPC, while most system services are then implemented

317
00:19:56,260 --> 00:19:59,200
in user space, again, just like Fuchsia.

318
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:03,280
But it's not going to be compatible with Android apps out of the box, developers are going

319
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:05,840
to have to recompile them.

320
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:09,680
But Huawei are saying that it's going to be really easy to do that.

321
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:11,680
I'm skeptical of that.

322
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:16,720
They are going to be providing an IDE to make it as simple as possible, but I think we're

323
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:18,200
going to have to wait and see on that one.

324
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:22,480
Yeah, they say this is going to be a three-year transition if they have to go through with

325
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:23,480
it.

326
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:26,840
And I think part of that three years is this particular problem.

327
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:29,800
There's no apps for this OS, and there's no market.

328
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:35,120
And they talk about it as small changes, especially if you're already using Kotlin or a language

329
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:38,840
like C++, it won't be a big deal.

330
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:43,300
I think that's often the story these companies say, that's what they'll tell you.

331
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:47,400
That's going to be the hardest part for them, is the apps, and the fact that they didn't

332
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:53,060
make a direct layer, like a compatibility layer, maybe that's for safety, I'm not sure.

333
00:20:53,060 --> 00:20:56,040
But it's going to hurt them as far as apps initially.

334
00:20:56,040 --> 00:21:01,080
Though they're making the case that if you play their game, you're going to have a much

335
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:02,800
better performance story.

336
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:06,960
In fact, they're kind of taking direct shots, not just at Android, but they're taking direct

337
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:07,960
shots at Linux.

338
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:13,880
They say, unlike Android, which uses the Linux kernel scheduling mechanism, Harmony OS uses

339
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:20,200
a deterministic latency engine that provides precise resource scheduling with real-time

340
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:24,240
load analysis and forecasting.

341
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:27,380
And it'll do app characteristic matching.

342
00:21:27,380 --> 00:21:37,360
The result is a 25.7 and 55.6 improvement in response and latency fluctuation, respectively.

343
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:40,880
They're claiming a pretty big performance improvement by changing the way the kernel

344
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:44,720
manages tasks and by changing some of the stack.

345
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:48,160
They're kind of making the case for Google's Fuchsia OS, and it's hard to tell if this

346
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:52,400
whole thing is just a big bluff because they claim they're going to be shipping this on

347
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:53,400
TVs soon.

348
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:57,880
Well, yeah, one of their claims is that this is going to run across multiple device classes,

349
00:21:57,880 --> 00:22:03,000
so IoT, TVs, watches, and phones.

350
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,820
But that, to me, is a bit of a red flag, really.

351
00:22:04,820 --> 00:22:08,720
When a company claims that before they've even released anything, that seems like pie

352
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:09,920
in the sky to me.

353
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:11,560
But we'll see on that one.

354
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:13,880
It seems like the ideal way to engineer something.

355
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:18,160
If engineers could rule the world, you would have one platform like that that scaled from

356
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:21,160
the watch to the television to the phone to the tablet, et cetera, et cetera.

357
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:22,520
That would be great.

358
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:23,520
They would love that.

359
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:27,680
But then when you look at what's worked in the marketplace, that really hasn't bared

360
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:28,680
out.

361
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:33,540
In a statement from Huawei, a representative confirmed that the Honor smart screen is going

362
00:22:33,540 --> 00:22:36,600
to be the first product running Harmony OS.

363
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:41,240
And then the company intends to continue using Android for the time being.

364
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:45,720
And then comments from Huawei's consumer CEO noted that the company's situation with Android,

365
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:50,040
as far as they're concerned, still remains unclear.

366
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:55,640
What I read that as is this is their big show.

367
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:59,840
They're putting their tail feathers out there saying, we don't need you.

368
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:03,920
But there's a window for you to work this out with us still, if you would like to.

369
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:05,760
It's kind of a famous negotiating tactic.

370
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:09,240
They're just doing it on a massive world stage.

371
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:12,860
What really caught my attention, though, was the kind of dig that they made at Google and

372
00:23:12,860 --> 00:23:18,600
Android in that they're looking to establish a proper open source foundation and properly

373
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:23,080
open source it, and they made it sound like this was not going to be just throw it over

374
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:28,400
the wall style like Android, like it's going to be a proper community development effort.

375
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:33,320
And if that's true, then this is genuinely quite exciting, because I think with future

376
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:36,840
we're probably going to see the Android style throw it over the wall as well.

377
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:41,400
So this could potentially be a serious competitor.

378
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:44,680
That's something I think we should look further into is what their intentions are there or

379
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:48,600
if they have any plans yet, because they have been vague.

380
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:51,600
And maybe that's where we'll turn our attention to next behind the scenes is trying to get

381
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:53,960
more information on how that's going to work.

382
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:58,680
Because you're right, if they do this properly, and it's a legitimate open source project,

383
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:03,040
this could be a game changer for the community.

384
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:07,920
And I mean, I couldn't overstate the benefits of that, really.

385
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:10,760
So I think it's worth digging in too further, because at this point in time, we don't know

386
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:11,760
what we're going to get.

387
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:13,240
They've made some big implications, you're right.

388
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:18,140
They make it sound like they won't do the Android style, they won't repeat those mistakes

389
00:24:18,140 --> 00:24:20,520
is kind of the messaging.

390
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:24,520
But then they haven't really said what they're going to do instead.

391
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:29,440
And that really, I think, is the crux of it as far as our community is concerned, is how

392
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:32,880
you implement that community, how you do all of that.

393
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:33,880
It matters so much.

394
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:35,200
So we'll just have to wait and see.

395
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:38,120
And obviously, we'll be keeping our eyes on it and doing as much digging as we can.

396
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:44,160
A bit of a tangent, but smart displays, right, you know about this sort of thing.

397
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:48,200
What's the difference between a smart display and a tablet that you can't pick up and move?

398
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:51,000
The smart display is a little more minimal OS.

399
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:54,960
Like in the case of Google, it's running like Chromecast OS underneath, instead of, say,

400
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:58,720
a whole Android OS that has apps that have to be updated and all that kind of stuff.

401
00:24:58,720 --> 00:24:59,720
Right.

402
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:02,080
So it's just a useless tablet that you can't move, then.

403
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:03,120
Right, right, right.

404
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:07,840
It's like a tablet that's been bolted to a speaker that does 10% of the things a tablet

405
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:08,840
can do.

406
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:09,840
Right.

407
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:10,840
And costs about the same.

408
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:11,840
Excellent.

409
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:12,840
All right.

410
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:17,400
Well, let's end with the news that Linux Journal is shutting down.

411
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:21,960
And that may trigger a bit of deja vu in some people, because it was not even two years

412
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:27,340
ago that they almost shut down, and then Private Internet Access came along and saved them.

413
00:25:27,340 --> 00:25:29,120
But this time, it seems it's for real.

414
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:30,820
The money's run out.

415
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:32,840
And so that's it.

416
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:35,260
After 25 years, shut and up shop.

417
00:25:35,260 --> 00:25:39,080
My experiences with Linux Journal were always in the physical world.

418
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:45,160
They would have a booth at an event, and they always had a great booth, great branding,

419
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:50,160
and just really engaging people at the booth that wanted to have a conversation about Linux.

420
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:53,480
And it just really made you feel like, man, these are really part of the community.

421
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:55,480
These individuals really get it.

422
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:58,480
So it's sad to see a group of people like that have to move on.

423
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:03,880
I do have a bit of good news, though, is my favorite Linux magazine, Linux Format, continues

424
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:04,880
on.

425
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:07,920
And it's not cheap, but I think you can understand why after this news.

426
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:09,760
So I'll put a link to that in the show notes.

427
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:12,400
I really have loved Linux Format for a long time.

428
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:17,160
And they have digital only, and they have a magazine and digital.

429
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:19,920
And it's one of those where they'll still include some media in the magazine subscription,

430
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:23,800
where you can try out a distro like they used to.

431
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:25,180
I love that stuff.

432
00:26:25,180 --> 00:26:29,000
So we still have at least a great magazine out there over at Linux Format.

433
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,000
Yeah.

434
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,840
And of course, you've got your maker magazines and the various magazines that the Raspberry

435
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:35,380
Pi do and 3D printing stuff.

436
00:26:35,380 --> 00:26:37,360
It seems to all become a bit more niche, really.

437
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:38,360
Yeah.

438
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:45,760
In a way, it's the reality, I think, of the general consumers coming into the market and

439
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:51,260
open source winning, but not in the way Outfits, like Linux Journal, predicted.

440
00:26:51,260 --> 00:26:55,320
We all thought if free software and open software won, then everybody would come over to our

441
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:58,940
camp and we'd be getting people writing their drivers in open source, and they'd be releasing

442
00:26:58,940 --> 00:27:01,000
their applications in open source.

443
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,920
By the way, they could go in all the repos, and yay, everybody won.

444
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:04,920
That's the goal.

445
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:08,920
What we really got is technology companies have figured out a way to make more money,

446
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:12,600
and we have more users that are enabled to do technology things that didn't exist in

447
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:16,460
the past, like 3D printing, like building robots from Raspberry Pis and stuff that's

448
00:27:16,460 --> 00:27:17,560
incredible and great.

449
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:24,400
And one of the many things that makes 2019 amazing, it just means that the victory we

450
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:27,880
all thought we'd see turned out to be something different.

451
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:29,640
And the reality is that you're right.

452
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:35,560
There's huge communities around these individual niches now, and that's now self-sustaining.

453
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:37,400
But it's a good thing.

454
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:38,400
Just so much changes.

455
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:39,400
It's really something.

456
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:44,040
You know, it really is, especially doing this news every week now for over a decade, watching

457
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:45,040
all of this.

458
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:46,040
It's something.

459
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:47,440
That's why we do this show every single week.

460
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:52,400
Come check us out at linuxactionnews.com slash subscribe for all the ways to get new episodes.

461
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:56,360
So that way you can stay in the loop, as that's what the kids say, right, Cho?

462
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:57,360
In the loop?

463
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:58,560
So you can stay in the know?

464
00:27:58,560 --> 00:27:59,560
The 411?

465
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:00,560
The 411?

466
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:02,560
Yeah, maybe 20 years ago.

467
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:08,400
You can go to linuxactionnews.com slash contact for ways to get in touch with us.

468
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:13,720
We'll be back next Monday with our weekly take on the latest Linux and open source news.

469
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:15,400
I'm at Chris LAS.

470
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:16,960
I'm at Joe Rissington.

471
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:19,400
Thank you for joining us, and we'll see you next week.

472
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:37,400
See you later.
