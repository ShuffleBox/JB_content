00:00.000 --> 00:09.380
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News Episode 145, recorded on February 16th, 2020.

00:09.380 --> 00:10.380
I'm Chris.

00:10.380 --> 00:11.380
And I'm Joe.

00:11.380 --> 00:12.380
Hello, Joe.

00:12.380 --> 00:13.620
Good to be connected with you.

00:13.620 --> 00:16.540
We start this week with some really great releases.

00:16.540 --> 00:21.600
Number one on our list in no particular order, Plasma 5.18.

00:21.600 --> 00:23.300
This is a new LTS release.

00:23.300 --> 00:28.060
So if you'd been using the previous LTS, then there are quite a few changes.

00:28.060 --> 00:32.560
But those changes are much subtler if you've been on something like KDE neon, where you've

00:32.560 --> 00:34.540
been tracking the development of it.

00:34.540 --> 00:36.120
And that's where you are, right?

00:36.120 --> 00:37.120
Absolutely.

00:37.120 --> 00:38.120
And it's been nice.

00:38.120 --> 00:41.640
There's a couple of things I noticed, GTK apps look a lot nicer.

00:41.640 --> 00:47.520
That's definitely a very noticeable and appreciated improvement for me.

00:47.520 --> 00:51.100
And if you're a high DPI user, there's a couple of nice things in here, especially if you're

00:51.100 --> 00:52.700
still on X.

00:52.700 --> 00:59.660
The other thing that they've added is GPU sensor info in ksyscard, which is pretty nice

00:59.660 --> 01:00.820
if you've got an NVIDIA card.

01:00.820 --> 01:02.300
I love just seeing that information.

01:02.300 --> 01:04.660
Now it's just in the built in system monitor.

01:04.660 --> 01:09.220
And you've been hitting super period every day, presumably, to get your emojis.

01:09.220 --> 01:10.220
Yeah.

01:10.220 --> 01:12.260
I wondered if you were going to bring up the emoji thing.

01:12.260 --> 01:16.260
I already had that bound to another key combination, actually, so I haven't really played with

01:16.260 --> 01:17.260
that.

01:17.260 --> 01:19.020
But I mean, you know me.

01:19.020 --> 01:22.820
I like an anisaronic emoji, so I appreciate the selector, Joe.

01:22.820 --> 01:25.300
You got to get your check marks from somewhere.

01:25.300 --> 01:26.300
Check marks and flames.

01:26.300 --> 01:27.300
I'm all about it.

01:27.300 --> 01:29.900
It's my brand.

01:29.900 --> 01:34.700
You can already try this out in KDE neon, but it's looking like it's going to be in

01:34.700 --> 01:36.620
Kubuntu 20.04 as well then.

01:36.620 --> 01:37.620
Yep.

01:37.620 --> 01:41.540
And of course, it's probably hitting the rolling distributions right as we record this, if

01:41.540 --> 01:43.620
not soon after.

01:43.620 --> 01:47.420
Also hitting a lot of different repos near you is a brand new version of MATE.

01:47.420 --> 01:49.500
Yeah, version 1.24.

01:49.500 --> 01:54.900
And I've been checking this out in the Ubuntu MATE focal daily images, which will eventually

01:54.900 --> 01:58.500
become 20.04, not too far in the future.

01:58.500 --> 02:00.060
And I'm pretty impressed with this.

02:00.060 --> 02:02.020
There's a few subtle changes.

02:02.020 --> 02:07.620
And I think the biggest one in terms of usability for me personally, is the invisible resize

02:07.620 --> 02:08.860
borders.

02:08.860 --> 02:14.140
No longer do I have to out right click to resize windows or find that exact point on

02:14.140 --> 02:15.180
the corner.

02:15.180 --> 02:20.740
You just kind of go vaguely near the corner and you can just drag and resize it.

02:20.740 --> 02:24.020
It's such a small thing, but it makes a huge difference to me.

02:24.020 --> 02:29.180
Okay, it's funny you start with that because that was the biggest improvement for me as

02:29.180 --> 02:30.180
well.

02:30.180 --> 02:31.780
And it seems like a small thing except for it's not.

02:31.780 --> 02:33.100
It's huge.

02:33.100 --> 02:37.420
You get your dumb mouse in the area of the border of the app that you want to resize

02:37.420 --> 02:40.220
and it changes to the right cursor error.

02:40.220 --> 02:44.020
And you can just drag the dang thing like you would expect you should be able to.

02:44.020 --> 02:50.260
You no longer have to be a precision fighter pilot to get that window border just right.

02:50.260 --> 02:55.020
And it seems like a small thing, but it was truly one of the most frustrating things about

02:55.020 --> 02:56.220
Mate for me.

02:56.220 --> 03:01.420
And that's one of many nice things that have come to the Marko window manager.

03:01.420 --> 03:05.620
One of the other nice things is support for window decorations from the past, just if

03:05.620 --> 03:06.940
you want to get your nostalgia on.

03:06.940 --> 03:13.060
But more importantly, things that improve high DPI support and improved Wayland support.

03:13.060 --> 03:19.180
In fact, improved Wayland support is littered throughout the release notes of Mate 124.

03:19.180 --> 03:23.440
Wayland and high DPI continue to see steady improvements for this release.

03:23.440 --> 03:27.840
But like you said, Joe, there's a couple of other just daily driver improvements that

03:27.840 --> 03:29.580
landed in this one.

03:29.580 --> 03:33.300
It seems like I used to have to tweak Mate to get it to this level of performance as

03:33.300 --> 03:34.300
well.

03:34.300 --> 03:37.740
I'd have to go in and I'd have to adjust the compositor settings and maybe I'd even install

03:37.740 --> 03:38.740
Compiz.

03:38.740 --> 03:44.740
I'd spend 15 minutes after install dialing it in with this just wouldn't change my appearance.

03:44.740 --> 03:48.740
I went and looked in some of those old spots to see if I needed to adjust anything.

03:48.740 --> 03:53.100
Everything was set the way I would use it and performance was fantastic on a ThinkPad.

03:53.100 --> 03:57.600
Now I don't want to stir up controversy here, but support for E login D is pretty big because

03:57.600 --> 04:02.680
this makes it easier for distros that don't use system D or even other operating systems

04:02.680 --> 04:04.900
like the BSDs to use Mate.

04:04.900 --> 04:06.700
I'm really glad to see this.

04:06.700 --> 04:10.040
They are a little trepidatious about it in the change log.

04:10.040 --> 04:16.100
They say in here, quote, if your system doesn't support system D, you might be interested

04:16.100 --> 04:20.780
in knowing that we've added support for E login D to both Mate screensaver and Mate

04:20.780 --> 04:21.780
session.

04:21.780 --> 04:25.640
First of all, this is great because kind of like you were just implying, it kind of makes

04:25.640 --> 04:30.600
this a universal desktop for not just Linux.

04:30.600 --> 04:36.340
But additionally, E login D strives to remain semi compatible with system D's login D. So

04:36.340 --> 04:40.880
I would imagine it's not an extraneous amount of work to add support.

04:40.880 --> 04:46.420
So it seems like a worthwhile investment while making Mate much more portable and appealing

04:46.420 --> 04:50.620
to people that might want to avoid system D and with no statement about the project

04:50.620 --> 04:54.340
other than that just seems like the appropriate place where you would find support for something

04:54.340 --> 04:59.260
like distributions or Unix's that don't have system D. Mate feels like the appropriate

04:59.260 --> 05:03.060
type of project in terms of a desktop to support that kind of thing.

05:03.060 --> 05:09.620
Yeah, that's kind of Mate's whole thing is a continuation of GNOME 2 and supporting things

05:09.620 --> 05:14.300
that have traditionally worked before, like the whole desktop paradigm, but also looking

05:14.300 --> 05:18.520
forward with Wayland support and high DPI.

05:18.520 --> 05:20.780
And the development is very much ongoing.

05:20.780 --> 05:23.940
So I agree, it's definitely the sort of thing they should be doing.

05:23.940 --> 05:27.780
And the more users of Mate, the better as far as the project is concerned.

05:27.780 --> 05:30.380
Well, let's keep this great release train going.

05:30.380 --> 05:34.700
Skinshot has a really fantastic, huge, big release, Joe.

05:34.700 --> 05:39.900
Version 2.5 and the huge standout here is experimental support for hardware encoding

05:39.900 --> 05:41.580
and decoding.

05:41.580 --> 05:42.660
Say it again.

05:42.660 --> 05:47.380
Hardware encoding and decoding, experimental support for hardware acceleration is a fundamental

05:47.380 --> 05:51.940
big feature in a video editor, full stop.

05:51.940 --> 05:58.060
And what's fantastic about this support is it includes support for MP4 and H.264 files,

05:58.060 --> 06:02.020
which is a super common recording format on GoPro, cell phones, et cetera.

06:02.020 --> 06:07.260
And if your graphics card is supported, OpenShot can decode the pixel data from the video and

06:07.260 --> 06:12.220
on the flip side, encode the pixel data back into the video, all on the graphics card.

06:12.220 --> 06:17.580
Jonathan Thomas, the developer writes, this can increase performance by up to 30 to 40

06:17.580 --> 06:21.160
percent, depending on different factors.

06:21.160 --> 06:25.980
And just in terms of performance, there's another area that has seen a massive boost.

06:25.980 --> 06:30.500
He writes, we've completely rewritten the key frame system to deliver real time interpolated

06:30.500 --> 06:34.060
values and no longer cache the entire value set.

06:34.060 --> 06:38.460
This is huge because the longer the video files, the more key frames it has to calculate.

06:38.460 --> 06:40.980
It exponentially improves performance.

06:40.980 --> 06:47.500
He says the new system can generate almost one hundred thousand interpolated values before

06:47.500 --> 06:51.860
the old system would even return a single value.

06:51.860 --> 06:57.020
That is who that is, that translates to saved editing time, that translates to those editors

06:57.020 --> 06:58.660
getting more of their life back.

06:58.660 --> 07:00.420
That's a that's a huge deal.

07:00.420 --> 07:06.240
There's also initial support for export and import of Premiere and Final Cut Pro files.

07:06.240 --> 07:12.980
This new feature I will probably go into with expectations set to stun, but the potential

07:12.980 --> 07:13.980
is there.

07:13.980 --> 07:14.980
I mean, XML is XML.

07:14.980 --> 07:15.980
You just got to learn how to parse and import it correctly.

07:15.980 --> 07:19.880
And it seems at this point, basic timeline data like your files, your clips, some key

07:19.880 --> 07:26.580
frame information, if you have multiple tracks, that is importable from Final Cut or Premiere.

07:26.580 --> 07:31.300
And that's big because you could see a future where somebody could work on a project in

07:31.300 --> 07:36.820
OpenShot, pass it off to another editor using a proprietary editing application and then

07:36.820 --> 07:40.500
sending it back to someone where they could continue an OpenShot.

07:40.500 --> 07:43.860
It would be amazing, Joe, if we could get there in a shorter time than it took us to

07:43.860 --> 07:45.300
get there with Word docs.

07:45.300 --> 07:49.220
Yeah, that's exactly what I was thinking about the Word documents.

07:49.220 --> 07:53.340
I think it is very important to be able to work with people who aren't using open source

07:53.340 --> 07:54.340
software.

07:54.340 --> 07:59.100
Otherwise, it makes the open source software that you're using slightly less relevant.

07:59.100 --> 08:03.540
It also means if you are a contractor doing a video job, you could deliver potentially

08:03.540 --> 08:07.100
the client in a file format they want for their own archive while using the tools that

08:07.100 --> 08:08.760
you want to create the video.

08:08.760 --> 08:11.340
It's really nice to see that feature landing in OpenShot.

08:11.340 --> 08:15.300
I don't do a lot of video editing, but when I do, I tend to use OpenShot.

08:15.300 --> 08:19.900
And this 2.5 release, which I tried out the app image of, looks really good to me.

08:19.900 --> 08:23.300
I didn't spend a huge amount of time with it, but it seemed to be much more stable than

08:23.300 --> 08:24.980
the previous version.

08:24.980 --> 08:29.500
And it's kind of inspiring me to maybe do a little bit more video, but we'll see.

08:29.500 --> 08:34.080
Well, Joe, we now reach the last stops of our release train this week with a new version

08:34.080 --> 08:35.080
of Firefox.

08:35.080 --> 08:36.900
Yeah, version 73.

08:36.900 --> 08:42.440
And the big story here is that there's not much of a story because they moved to this

08:42.440 --> 08:49.180
four-week release cycle, and so there aren't a huge number of new features here, except

08:49.180 --> 08:54.820
for one, and that is there is now a choice if you want to use DNS over HTTPS.

08:54.820 --> 08:56.840
You don't have to use Cloudflare.

08:56.840 --> 08:58.540
You could also use NextDNS.

08:58.540 --> 09:04.340
Yeah, it's nice to see a little user choice when it comes to DNS over HTTPS.

09:04.340 --> 09:07.680
Along with this, we also saw a release of Firefox ESR.

09:07.680 --> 09:10.240
So if you're on that track, you've got a new version.

09:10.240 --> 09:15.140
And last but not least, a new release of the Tor browser, which is a general update.

09:15.140 --> 09:19.700
It goes to the latest Firefox ESR, brings in like new versions of NoScript and the Tor

09:19.700 --> 09:20.700
client itself.

09:20.700 --> 09:25.060
So a worthwhile update and some performance improvements snuck in there as well.

09:25.060 --> 09:28.460
Yeah, and of course, that means there's a new version of Tails as well, 4.3.

09:28.460 --> 09:30.140
Yeah, it's a release family.

09:30.140 --> 09:31.740
It's the beauty of open source, Joe.

09:31.740 --> 09:35.580
Well, with all the good news out of the way, let's tackle some bad news.

09:35.580 --> 09:38.060
And I think we all saw this coming.

09:38.060 --> 09:39.260
Essential is no more.

09:39.260 --> 09:41.300
Yeah, I guess we're not too surprised, Joe.

09:41.300 --> 09:43.980
But this, if you don't remember, is Andy Rubin's phone company.

09:43.980 --> 09:49.180
He was one of the original creators of Android, worked at Google for a while.

09:49.180 --> 09:55.420
Some things went down, he left, founded Essential and released one phone.

09:55.420 --> 10:00.380
Although looking through the details of the company now, it appears they had a few things

10:00.380 --> 10:03.300
in the R&D lab, including their own smart speaker.

10:03.300 --> 10:08.260
Well, that was always the promise that they were working on this smart speaker OS.

10:08.260 --> 10:11.380
And they've got some video demos of it, and it looked to be pretty good.

10:11.380 --> 10:15.780
I don't know how accurate they were in terms of real world usage.

10:15.780 --> 10:18.140
Right, and they called it ambient OS.

10:18.140 --> 10:19.140
Yeah, yeah.

10:19.140 --> 10:23.780
The whole thing's a bit weird, how they put out this press release basically saying they

10:23.780 --> 10:27.980
were shutting down, but they also put in some promotional videos for what would have been.

10:27.980 --> 10:30.180
Yeah, well, we were really onto something here.

10:30.180 --> 10:31.980
It's a shame, is what the vibe is.

10:31.980 --> 10:36.540
Yeah, I wonder if maybe they were pitch videos to try and get some more financing that didn't

10:36.540 --> 10:41.100
work out or something, and they just thought, well, we may as well put them out there.

10:41.100 --> 10:45.460
We went to the effort of them, because of this gem smartphone concept, which was this

10:45.460 --> 10:50.840
tall, thin phone that looked like a remote control for your TV, and I was kind of keen

10:50.840 --> 10:51.840
to watch reviews of it.

10:51.840 --> 10:55.880
I don't think I would have ever bought one, but I was keen to see it come out because

10:55.880 --> 10:58.900
it's something different at least.

10:58.900 --> 11:03.980
And they had this assistant working on there, and it seemed like they had some good ideas,

11:03.980 --> 11:10.620
but as you say, they delivered one phone and then nothing else, except for very timely

11:10.620 --> 11:16.620
updates for that phone throughout its entire life until right now, the February update

11:16.620 --> 11:17.620
went out.

11:17.620 --> 11:21.060
And unfortunately, that'll be the last one, but I remember they were there on day one

11:21.060 --> 11:28.180
for Android 10, along with the Pixel phones, so I didn't want to believe that they were

11:28.180 --> 11:33.780
going to fold and go away, but we kind of all knew it deep down.

11:33.780 --> 11:38.660
I would have liked to have seen that gem concept ship, because a narrow phone that could fit

11:38.660 --> 11:42.140
better in your hand is an appealing concept to me.

11:42.140 --> 11:46.080
But with all major shutdowns, if you can call this one major, I mean, I think it's somewhat

11:46.080 --> 11:52.500
substantial, there is also some services that are going away, and this always really stings.

11:52.500 --> 11:59.860
Current Newton Mail users will have access to their mail service until April 30th, and

11:59.860 --> 12:01.700
then that is shutting down as well.

12:01.700 --> 12:03.980
Man, that really stinks.

12:03.980 --> 12:09.460
This is the aspect of these companies that they choose to take on the services role,

12:09.460 --> 12:13.580
and then they blow it like this, and it's like, don't get into that business if you're

12:13.580 --> 12:15.980
not prepared to be in it for the long term.

12:15.980 --> 12:17.480
Don't take people's email.

12:17.480 --> 12:18.480
Don't do that to people.

12:18.480 --> 12:22.200
Yeah, and you have to feel for the staff as well, because Essential bought that email

12:22.200 --> 12:27.140
company and now those people working on it are out of a job.

12:27.140 --> 12:28.140
Yeah.

12:28.140 --> 12:29.420
I never did have an Essential phone.

12:29.420 --> 12:32.500
I know iFixit tore it down and said, well, this is about as bad as an iPhone.

12:32.500 --> 12:36.260
They gave it a one on the repairability scale, it was all glued together.

12:36.260 --> 12:40.100
But it looked like a pretty nice device.

12:40.100 --> 12:44.780
But I think when it came down to buying luxury devices, Samsung and Google really have that

12:44.780 --> 12:47.420
lockdown and they have the channels too.

12:47.420 --> 12:48.420
Yeah, that's true.

12:48.420 --> 12:52.160
But it is officially supported by LineageOS and they do say in this announcement that

12:52.160 --> 12:56.420
they've published some stuff to GitHub, which will hopefully help with the hacking community.

12:56.420 --> 13:00.300
So it's not like it's just a completely useless paperweight.

13:00.300 --> 13:04.200
You can flash lineage on there and keep getting updates, at least for now.

13:04.200 --> 13:05.780
Good on them.

13:05.780 --> 13:07.480
That's how it should be.

13:07.480 --> 13:13.340
That really does show you that they were tuned in in a way that most handset OEMs were not.

13:13.340 --> 13:15.220
Yeah, which is why this is a real shame.

13:15.220 --> 13:21.480
Well, you might be surprised to learn that the last time the NetBSD project had a fundraiser

13:21.480 --> 13:23.900
was back in 2009.

13:23.900 --> 13:24.900
Well until now.

13:24.900 --> 13:28.540
Yeah, it goes to show how well they manage their finances that they haven't needed to

13:28.540 --> 13:32.660
do a major fundraising drive for over 10 years.

13:32.660 --> 13:37.380
But now they're doing another one and they're looking to raise $50,000, which is not an

13:37.380 --> 13:40.820
insignificant amount of money, but I think they'll look at that hopefully.

13:40.820 --> 13:41.820
Yeah, they're right.

13:41.820 --> 13:46.880
They will fund some critical parts of development that make NetBSD better and faster.

13:46.880 --> 13:50.620
They're also pretty honest about some things that haven't worked in the last couple of

13:50.620 --> 13:54.220
years and how they've identified that and have planned to fix that.

13:54.220 --> 13:56.260
And I think the whole post is worth a read.

13:56.260 --> 14:03.460
But the big takeaway here is $50,000 to help make NetBSD 10 happen this year.

14:03.460 --> 14:08.100
That's sort of the like the end goal besides just getting people paid, fixing a few areas,

14:08.100 --> 14:09.460
making things faster.

14:09.460 --> 14:15.980
The big goal is NetBSD 10 this year and make it the best NetBSD ever $50,000 in terms of

14:15.980 --> 14:23.300
a software project is really pretty modest, especially one that is so critical to so many

14:23.300 --> 14:28.420
people and on top of that has done so well at managing their finances over the last decade.

14:28.420 --> 14:31.900
From what we can tell externally at least, it seems like a good investment.

14:31.900 --> 14:35.820
Yeah, and there's nothing quite like a major release like NetBSD 9, which came out this

14:35.820 --> 14:37.860
week to instill confidence.

14:37.860 --> 14:40.300
