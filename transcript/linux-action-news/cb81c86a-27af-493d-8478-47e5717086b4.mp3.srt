00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, episode 203, recorded on August 22nd, 2021.

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
I'm Chris.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
And I'm Wes.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:17,240
Hello, Wes, from a really warm, sunny, beautiful Parker, Colorado, just outside of Denver.

5
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:18,240
Let's do the news.

6
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:23,060
We wanted to start this week by giving you an idea of what's coming soon in the Linux

7
00:00:23,060 --> 00:00:24,960
desktop pipeline.

8
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:30,960
It's been another busy week over at KDE, and developer Nate Graham has once again done a

9
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:35,960
great job helping us wrap our heads around some of the more notable bits.

10
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:39,960
I know the work on the new overview effect caught Chris's attention in particular.

11
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:41,500
Indeed, this is looking really great.

12
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:43,400
It's a new QML based overview effect.

13
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:47,840
And Nate stresses in his post, this is still kind of early days, it's still going to need

14
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:49,440
some testing.

15
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:54,700
But the idea is to give you one spot that gives an overview of all the relevant window

16
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:58,880
functionality similar to a third party kwin script that already exists called parachute

17
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:02,880
and also somewhat similar to how Mac OS is mission control works today.

18
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:04,760
It's going to ship in plasma 523.

19
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:06,340
And they're going to want everybody to take a look at it.

20
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:08,520
But this is the way they're going a new way to do this.

21
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:10,760
And they'd like everybody to get some eyes on it.

22
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:14,320
Also another feature that caught my attention that made me think, how did we not have this

23
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:15,320
before?

24
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:20,080
But now in KDE system settings, you can choose the status of your Bluetooth adapter at login.

25
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:24,480
So if you want it to be powered on when you log in or powered off, perhaps or how about

26
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:28,160
just whatever the last state was, that will now be an option you can control.

27
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:32,720
And like nearly every recent release, work has gone into making the Wayland experience

28
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:33,880
better.

29
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:38,720
In the plasma Wayland session, middle click paste now works between native Wayland apps

30
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:41,680
and those running under X Wayland.

31
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:46,240
Among several other fixes, one I was happy to see is the resolution of at least one of

32
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:49,780
the ways that the lock screen could get broken on Wayland.

33
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:54,640
In a relatively new ongoing update series, Felix Hacker filled us in on the road to GNOME

34
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:56,400
41.

35
00:01:56,400 --> 00:02:01,620
And speaking of new system settings, there's two new panels that have landed in GNOME.

36
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:04,380
One is multitasking, and the other is cellular.

37
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:08,340
The multitasking panel provides helpful functionality to improve your productivity when working

38
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:11,080
with many apps at once with some nice options there.

39
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:14,880
And the cellular panel allows you to configure various aspects of a mobile connection and

40
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:16,440
a mobile modem.

41
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:22,040
Many of the GNOME supporting apps are seeing updates land as well, including the podcast

42
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:26,280
app for GNOME that now supports an episode description page where users can read the

43
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:32,520
notes for an episode, fold titles of long episode names, and share the episode URL.

44
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:36,400
And when many of us think of shipping the GNOME desktop, we think of Ubuntu, which normally

45
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:41,440
ships with the latest GNOME desktop version that's generally released just before Ubuntu

46
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:42,440
ships.

47
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:48,400
But with Ubuntu 21.04, they ended up sticking with GNOME 3.38, rather than jumping on GNOME

48
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,200
40 just as it was released.

49
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:54,240
Now interestingly, Michael Larble over at Ferronix notes that he's been looking at

50
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:58,800
the development track of Ubuntu 21.04, and it looks like they're going to opt to stick

51
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:03,480
with GNOME 40 and not GNOME 41, which will be released by then.

52
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:08,600
GNOME 41 will be out in September, as usual, with the latest and greatest from the half-year

53
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:09,600
update.

54
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:15,920
When asked about Ubuntu's GNOME version plans, Canonical's Sebastien Blachet wrote,

55
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:21,760
Ideally, we would have updated to 41, but future freeze is today, and we didn't really

56
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:24,880
have the resources available for the update.

57
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:28,120
And while that's really a shame to see, it seems that maybe Canonical will cherry-pick

58
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:33,120
a few features to backport to 40, and GNOME 41 is currently up to beta state right now.

59
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:37,520
A release candidate is coming in early September, and the official GNOME 41 release is planned

60
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:40,160
for September 22nd.

61
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:47,320
Sticking with GTK, but shifting away from GNOME, after 18 months of development, Mate

62
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:50,440
1.26 has been released.

63
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:56,680
1.26 introduces Wayland support for Atrial, System Monitor, Pluma, Terminal, and a host

64
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:58,960
of other desktop components.

65
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:03,040
And an area that saw a lot of development that you might not expect at first pass is

66
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:05,280
actually Mate's text editor Pluma.

67
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:09,640
It was subject to massive improvements, and just a few of those are the new minimap that

68
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:13,640
gives you an instant overview of a large dock, the new grid background pattern that turns

69
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:17,520
Pluma into a writing pad, and of course the preference dialog that had to get pretty much

70
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:19,840
reworked to accommodate a bunch of new features.

71
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:23,560
I mean, they've really invested in Pluma this release cycle.

72
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:28,900
The project seems pretty darn proud of this work, and notes in particular that together

73
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:34,360
with the brand new Pluma plugins, the text editor can now be turned into a feature-rich

74
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:39,360
IDE, with support for things like bracket completion, commenting and uncommenting of

75
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:43,980
code blocks, a built-in terminal, and of course, autocomplete.

76
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:48,960
And as always, but especially after 18 months, this really, really rings true.

77
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:53,240
The project has just fixed a lot of bugs, some memory leaks, and has modernized the

78
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:56,080
codebase of just about all of their desktop components.

79
00:04:56,080 --> 00:05:01,080
It really looks like Mate 1.26 is a banger release.

80
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:07,520
Matrix, the open standard and protocol for real-time communication released six years

81
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:14,640
ago, has many clients under active development, but one of the largest, Element, saw a significant

82
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:25,440
update this week.

83
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:29,560
On mobile, you can use the new voice message button two different ways.

84
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:34,300
Either press and hold to instantly send a message, or drag the button up to lock the

85
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:37,640
recorder on if you're sending a longer message and don't want to have to hold the button

86
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:39,680
down the whole darn time.

87
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:53,880
After that, you can review the message you've recorded before you send it off.

88
00:05:53,880 --> 00:06:07,640
And of course, it's easy to issue a quick reply.

89
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:11,700
And probably worth noting here, the Element project said that this has been one of their

90
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:23,120
oldest and most upvoted feature requests ever.

91
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:28,880
And even better, when we dug into it, we were so pleased to see that they're using Opus

92
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:33,160
wrapped in an Ogg container to actually send the audio bits around.

93
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:38,080
It's so nice to see open source audio being used for what it's best at.

94
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:42,340
And really, besides voice messages, a ton of improvements for voice and video calls

95
00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:44,040
have landed as well.

96
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:48,560
If you've tried that stuff out in the past, now is definitely the time to give it another

97
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:49,560
go.

98
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:51,000
Yeah, it seems like a lot of underhood improvements.

99
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:56,240
They said that they did a lot of rework to update to more current matrix specs that make

100
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:58,400
VoIP calls a lot more robust.

101
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:01,880
That was an aspect they sort of underlined and said, please give that a go if you haven't

102
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:02,880
used that before.

103
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:06,520
If you used it in the past and thought it didn't work great, try it again.

104
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:11,000
They also just really cleaned up the chat timeline with just how images are displayed,

105
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:17,480
how replies and read receipts are displayed, and the entire experience of the core chat

106
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:18,480
has been improved.

107
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:20,800
And when isn't that a big win in the chat application?

108
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:25,280
So if you'd like to join our matrix server, head over to linuxunplug.com slash matrix

109
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:27,640
and it'll send you there.

110
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:33,140
And just a brief update on the Tenacity project, a community fork of Audacity with quite a

111
00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:35,240
bit of momentum.

112
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:40,280
The developer has posted an update for distribution packagers that lets them know about some of

113
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:45,760
the big changes to Tenacity's build system, what they might need to do for pipeline support,

114
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:46,880
and a lot more.

115
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:52,360
And buried in that post are some details that indicate ongoing work to update Tenacity's

116
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:56,640
window toolkit, wxwidgets, to a newer version.

117
00:07:56,640 --> 00:08:02,440
The project's lead, called Bean, has also gone the extra mile by making sure the ecosystem

118
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:07,760
of libraries around Tenacity are in good shape, effectively becoming the new upstream for

119
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:09,120
some of them.

120
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:14,200
And seems work is proceeding well, some of the hardest parts already tackled.

121
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:18,800
But Bean notes the project is not yet ready to be packaged, there's still rebranding

122
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:23,560
work to do to remove those Audacity trademarks.

123
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:24,880
Linode.com slash LAN.

124
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:29,320
Go there to get $100 in 60 day credit on a new account and you go there to support this

125
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:30,320
show.

126
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:34,400
This show is made possible by our sponsors like Linode.

127
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:39,520
Linode is where we host pretty much everything now and definitely everything we've built

128
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:41,320
in the last two and a half years.

129
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:44,200
They started in 2003, so 18 years ago.

130
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:48,120
I've known about them for a long time because I've seen them at community events, but I

131
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:53,120
really got a new appreciation of what it's like to work with Linode as a business.

132
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:56,720
Because you can use somebody's services, you can check out their website, but you don't

133
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:01,380
get a sense of what they really are like internally until you've had an opportunity to do something

134
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:04,560
like we just did, which was our Denver meetup.

135
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:05,560
What an opportunity.

136
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:08,820
I really am so grateful for Linode's support.

137
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:10,640
They brought our community together.

138
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:13,200
They created something special.

139
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:17,480
We gave away a set of Raspberry Pis and it couldn't have worked out better because one

140
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:24,320
of our first winners for the Raspberry Pis was Jose who flew in from Puerto Rico and

141
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:28,860
Jose is working on accessibility for Linux.

142
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:31,320
He's a blind developer himself.

143
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:36,480
He flew by himself from Puerto Rico to our meetup and he was the first winner of the

144
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:39,040
Raspberry Pi giveaway kit that Linode did.

145
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:45,240
It just made that moment so perfect and it was really special.

146
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:47,880
That wouldn't have happened without Linode's support.

147
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:51,320
On top of just being a great company with great people inside it, they've got Linux

148
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:55,580
geeks in there that have built an awesome product because they knew where Linux was

149
00:09:55,580 --> 00:10:01,440
going back in 2003 and they thought, jeez, instead of racking a server for every Apache

150
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:06,200
box, we could start using this user mode Linux stuff that's going towards virtualization

151
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:10,960
and actually create multiple Linux servers on one host.

152
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:13,480
That was their big breakthrough back in the day.

153
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:16,820
They were first in this and now they're doing it the best.

154
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:18,600
They're still independently owned.

155
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,880
They have 11 data centers around the world.

156
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:25,800
They are their own ISP so the interlinks between their data centers are crazy fast.

157
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:29,400
We use the heck out of their S3 compatible object storage.

158
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:30,600
You can as well.

159
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:34,160
They're currently testing out bare metal boxes just because sometimes that's the way you

160
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:35,160
got to go.

161
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:41,680
DDoS protection, VLAN support, a powerful DNS manager, that's all in there as well.

162
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:46,520
With pricing 30 to 50% cheaper than other major cloud providers and the fact that you

163
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:52,280
can support Linux action news by going to linode.com slash land, I mean, it seems like

164
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:53,280
a great opportunity.

165
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:57,680
Even if you just wanted to try something out, deploy something, compare it to another provider

166
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:01,360
or maybe learn something, they have a bunch of tutorials that can help you do that and

167
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:04,480
they also have a marketplace of applications.

168
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:09,160
While I don't generally tend to deploy the entire application stack with the eventual

169
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:15,520
application installed, I do tend to deploy their base stacks with the correct repos for

170
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:19,440
whatever I might be using, generally Docker, because you can click that and get that going

171
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:23,200
in no time and then you just jump in, make sure everything's up to date, it usually is,

172
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:30,700
and the other nice thing is Linode has a mirror of the distro repos packages so you're updating

173
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:35,640
over Linode's crazy fast LAN and then their boxes are super fast and the SSDs are super

174
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:40,480
fast so it's a blast updating your boxes on Linode.

175
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:44,720
And if you ever get stuck, they have the best customer support by phone, by ticket, however

176
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:49,680
you like to do it, they'll hook you up with great, great customer support.

177
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:53,240
Linode is dedicated to offering the very best in virtualized cloud computing.

178
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:56,200
If it runs on Linux, it'll run on Linode.

179
00:11:56,200 --> 00:12:02,280
To go sign up today and support the show, linode.com slash lan.

180
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:07,500
Linux action news is also brought to you by Ting and if you're sick of overpaying for

181
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:13,800
cell service, go see how much you could save and then take 25 bucks off that at linux.ting.com.

182
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:16,600
Ting is an MBNO or a mobile virtual network operator.

183
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:22,440
That means they're not digging big holes and installing towers and arguing with local governments.

184
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:23,920
They don't have to focus on that stuff.

185
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:28,520
Instead, they can focus on making a great value for their customers and great customer

186
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:29,520
service.

187
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:33,720
With Ting Mobile, you get the same coast-to-coast coverage as you would with all the big networks.

188
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:35,640
You just pay less for it.

189
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:42,360
That's why I've been a Ting customer since 2013 and on this road trip, I've had an opportunity

190
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:47,300
to chat with customers of Ting that have listened to our show and signed up for Ting and one

191
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:52,600
of the use cases that I never really considered because I'm always traveling by land is people

192
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:56,720
who fly into a certain area love to use Ting for when they're traveling.

193
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:59,840
So a common one was people who come in from out of country.

194
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:03,360
They can have a Ting SIM in the United States, but also people who are just traveling out

195
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:07,960
of their area and want to pick something that is better in that area that they're traveling

196
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:12,400
to because with Ting, you have multiple networks and if you work with their support, you can

197
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:17,520
get the right SIM card so you end up getting the best type of coverage for your area and

198
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:21,960
they have really easy plans and simple to understand that make it a great value for

199
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:26,680
using Ting like that, but they also have plans that just work great for families.

200
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:30,880
If you just sync your music and you sync your podcast before you get started, it'll blow

201
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:31,880
your mind.

202
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:35,880
The kind of savings you can get compared to like the big duopolies, like the kind of service

203
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:37,280
you might get with a big duopoly.

204
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:42,760
You're probably going to be paying on a family plan like, I don't know, over $130 where with

205
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:44,920
Ting, they have like the set 12 plan.

206
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:47,920
You get 12 gigs of data and unlimited talk and text.

207
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:52,160
So the stuff that really matters and that's $35 a month.

208
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:56,800
So it's like a hundred dollars less a month and it's really easy to add lines as you need

209
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:58,800
it and you can pool that data.

210
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:04,040
So it's just really worth looking at if you just use a little bit of outside the box thinking

211
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:07,480
when it comes to mobile, two gigs, 20 gigs or even more, there's going to be a Ting plan

212
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:08,480
for you.

213
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:12,040
So go get clever and then you get access to Ting's award-winning customer service when

214
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:18,980
you sign up, their nationwide LTE and 5G coverage and the best part is no contracts ever.

215
00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:22,760
And it's funny, I've been a customer since 2013 and I think ironically, one of the reasons

216
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:25,240
I stick around is because there is no contract.

217
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:28,600
There's no like agreement as the carriers call it now.

218
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:31,840
They don't like calling it contracts, no, no, but they call it agreement and there's

219
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:34,640
no agreement like looming over my head.

220
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:41,000
It's clean, it's straightforward, it's simple and you can get started by going to linux.ting.com.

221
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,600
Go check your current phone, create an account, pick the plan that's right for you.

222
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:47,600
Ting will send you a SIM, you pop it in, you're up and going in minutes.

223
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:49,600
The next generation of Ting mobile is here.

224
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:54,960
So go see how much you could save and then take 25 bucks off that.

225
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:56,820
Linux.ting.com.

226
00:14:56,820 --> 00:15:02,040
This past week, we had the absolute privilege of spending some time at the System76 factory

227
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:05,040
in Denver, Colorado.

228
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:09,600
During our time there, we had a chance to chat with founder and CEO, Carl Rochelle.

229
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:15,520
The entire chat was featured in Linux Unplugged 4.19, but there was a bit where Carl made

230
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:16,520
some news.

231
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:18,540
Yeah, it's a bit of exclusive information.

232
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:20,480
So we wanted to let you know about it here.

233
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:26,440
I asked Carl if we were ever going to see a $100 version of their customizable open

234
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:27,840
launch keyboard.

235
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:32,800
And that got us chatting about the roadmap in general for the launch.

236
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:38,440
And Carl, like an open book that he is, shared some never released details about their future

237
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:39,440
plans.

238
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:40,560
There is a roadmap for launch.

239
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:43,560
It just doesn't go down to $100.

240
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:49,320
I don't think that we can build a product that we would be proud of that fits with the

241
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:51,800
design and the characteristics of launch itself.

242
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:55,840
We don't want the quality to be any lower, but there are things that we can do to bring

243
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:57,880
the price down for another model.

244
00:15:57,880 --> 00:16:02,440
So the launch roadmap includes a model that's going to have a 10 key numpad.

245
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:07,520
So that'll be coming, I think, both of these are probably first half next year.

246
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:12,800
So a 10 key, we've got to get our production up and running and caught up, but the 10 key.

247
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:20,080
And then another smaller, I believe it's 67 key, which is going to remove the F row.

248
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:23,880
So you'd hit the function row underneath the function key with one, two, three and

249
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:24,880
so forth.

250
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:25,880
So an even smaller footprint.

251
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:27,280
Right, an even smaller one.

252
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:28,560
So that cuts out a bunch of switches.

253
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:30,140
We're also going to remove the hub from that.

254
00:16:30,140 --> 00:16:33,280
And my hope is we can get that to $199.

255
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:39,000
Besides future keyboard plans, Carl was also pretty open about their ambitions to build

256
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,760
a laptop.

257
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:45,000
A topic we'll have some information on sometime soon.

258
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:50,840
And really, it just seems like System76 is in a great location for what they're doing.

259
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:54,600
I was blown away by the number of Denver locals who showed up at our meetup.

260
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:58,720
I mean, everyone from new Linux users who had just found the shows to folks who've

261
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:03,360
been doing software development on Linux for way longer than they would ever like me to

262
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:04,960
say on air.

263
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:09,280
The Linux tech scene in general was impressive in Denver, I think way more than either of

264
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:10,280
us were expecting.

265
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:12,320
Yeah, I would agree with that.

266
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:16,560
I don't know what I was expecting going into it exactly.

267
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:20,200
But like you mentioned, there was some folks there that were just learning Linux, and they

268
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:23,720
had just traveled to the area and got Linux jobs.

269
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:25,720
And then there was folks have been there for a long time.

270
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:28,680
And it was a good mix of like just arrived, the tech scene is growing.

271
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:33,400
It seems like it's on a heck of a trajectory, I think we're gonna have to return someday.

272
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:37,640
And I think there's going to be a lot of development out there with all of those people getting

273
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:38,640
these Linux jobs.

274
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:43,160
