Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, our weekly take on Linux and the open source world.

00:16.600 --> 00:20.000
This is episode four, recorded on June 4th, 2017.

00:20.000 --> 00:21.000
I'm Chris.

00:21.000 --> 00:22.000
And I'm Joe.

00:22.000 --> 00:23.000
Hello, Joe.

00:23.000 --> 00:27.380
It's good to be with you again, and we have a great news lineup, but our first story is

00:27.380 --> 00:30.160
about Plasma 5.10 this week.

00:30.160 --> 00:33.520
And I watched the story with interest because as soon as it landed, I thought, is this

00:33.520 --> 00:36.260
the release that Joe switches to Plasma?

00:36.260 --> 00:37.560
Because it's a good one, Joe.

00:37.560 --> 00:39.360
It's got a lot of nice features.

00:39.360 --> 00:42.400
It's simple by default and powerful when needed.

00:42.400 --> 00:43.400
Very good.

00:43.400 --> 00:44.400
Very good.

00:44.400 --> 00:49.480
Did it draw you in with their new task manager configurations or folder view by default on

00:49.480 --> 00:50.480
the desktop?

00:50.480 --> 00:53.640
Well, put it this way, it's further improvement.

00:53.640 --> 00:54.840
There's no doubt about that.

00:54.840 --> 00:56.480
It's a lot of further improvement.

00:56.480 --> 00:57.960
It's a lot of things that they've improved.

00:57.960 --> 01:02.660
Yeah, the little changes they've made are definitely improvements and it's refinement

01:02.660 --> 01:06.920
and it's making it more and more stable and just better.

01:06.920 --> 01:13.280
However, the thought of it, it's like, I don't know, when you think about a really nice meal,

01:13.280 --> 01:17.320
then you have, you actually eat it and it's a bit of a disappointment because I actually

01:17.320 --> 01:18.320
did try it out.

01:18.320 --> 01:25.800
I tried out 5.9 first and then 5.10 and don't get me wrong.

01:25.800 --> 01:31.040
I'm not going to say it's bad, but it wasn't quite as good as I remembered it being.

01:31.040 --> 01:36.600
And then going back to XFC, it was just like, ah, putting in a really comfortable pair of

01:36.600 --> 01:38.840
trousers or something.

01:38.840 --> 01:42.160
Just going back to XFC, that's what I want.

01:42.160 --> 01:44.880
That's how I like to live my computing experience.

01:44.880 --> 01:50.440
And so as much as I admire what they're doing, it's not for me yet.

01:50.440 --> 01:55.040
It's very much kind of down the line, this abstract point in the future for me.

01:55.040 --> 01:59.520
I am impressed with every single release, how many things they've made nicer or better

01:59.520 --> 02:04.600
when it comes to the way the notification tray works or working with audio devices.

02:04.600 --> 02:08.420
But their work on future Wayland support, I think, has put them ahead of just about

02:08.420 --> 02:10.720
every other project out there.

02:10.720 --> 02:14.160
So one of the things that jumps out at me now that Kaywin supports that I bet a lot

02:14.160 --> 02:19.000
of you would be interested in is scaling support when you have different levels of DPI support

02:19.000 --> 02:20.040
on your monitor.

02:20.040 --> 02:24.440
So if you have one monitor that's high DPI, say your laptop monitor, and then you connect

02:24.440 --> 02:30.600
an external display that is not high DPI, even if it's very high resolution, in X land,

02:30.600 --> 02:34.040
in the world of X, everything's going to be one resolution.

02:34.040 --> 02:38.040
And so your non-high DPI monitor ends up with everything huge.

02:38.040 --> 02:42.760
And now Kaywin has baked in support for scaling at different levels if you have a high DPI

02:42.760 --> 02:44.400
and a normal DPI monitor.

02:44.400 --> 02:45.960
That's a home run feature for me.

02:45.960 --> 02:47.820
Yeah, it feels very modern.

02:47.820 --> 02:49.480
Everything about it feels modern, doesn't it?

02:49.480 --> 02:52.840
Yeah, and the performance overall is continuing to get better.

02:52.840 --> 02:58.440
I gave a little quick mention to the audio tweaks that they made that I like.

02:58.440 --> 03:04.280
The audio volume applet now has a handy menu on each device which you can click on and

03:04.280 --> 03:07.240
you can choose the default, so for like headphones or speakers.

03:07.240 --> 03:11.600
So you can go to your audio device like I have hooked up to this computer we're recording

03:11.600 --> 03:16.400
on and I can say use the headphone jack or use the main speaker jack that I have my big

03:16.400 --> 03:20.000
speakers plugged into right there from the system tray menu.

03:20.000 --> 03:22.200
I have a lot of positive stuff to say about it.

03:22.200 --> 03:25.720
It hasn't switched me yet, but I'm mostly positive on this release.

03:25.720 --> 03:28.080
Can I be a little bit negative about the audio stuff?

03:28.080 --> 03:29.080
Sure.

03:29.080 --> 03:32.440
So for you, or for me, that's really useful.

03:32.440 --> 03:37.960
But for the average person, isn't that just more clutter, more options, more...

03:37.960 --> 03:42.440
That's something KDE's always criticized for is there being too much configuration.

03:42.440 --> 03:46.920
And this just adds clutter, doesn't it, to what otherwise most people, they plug their

03:46.920 --> 03:51.000
headphones in to their laptop or they unplug them so they're either on speakers or headphones.

03:51.000 --> 03:56.840
They don't have two different audio interfaces and a mixer or whatever.

03:56.840 --> 04:02.160
I can see why you really like it and it appeals to me definitely, but to the average person,

04:02.160 --> 04:03.160
not sure.

04:03.160 --> 04:04.320
It depends on how it's implemented.

04:04.320 --> 04:08.280
So if by default for the average person, they plug in their headphones and everything just

04:08.280 --> 04:12.880
works by default, then they nailed it because you see, Joe, they've embraced the wonder

04:12.880 --> 04:15.040
of the hamburger menu.

04:15.040 --> 04:20.160
And so you just have a standard audio device list, but the next to the audio device on

04:20.160 --> 04:22.360
the right-hand side is the hamburger menu.

04:22.360 --> 04:26.160
And then you click that thing and that's where you get all your extra crazy options, like

04:26.160 --> 04:28.680
which particular output device and whatnot.

04:28.680 --> 04:32.240
And that almost might be a compromise that works.

04:32.240 --> 04:38.920
But this really is the opposite to GNOME and Unity RIP.

04:38.920 --> 04:42.240
It's so aimed at power users who want to configure their system, isn't it?

04:42.240 --> 04:45.440
And they say simple by default.

04:45.440 --> 04:46.840
And for me, it's not really.

04:46.840 --> 04:50.720
I don't like all the animations, I don't like all the widgets and stuff.

04:50.720 --> 04:53.840
I like XFCE simplicity.

04:53.840 --> 04:56.900
But the thing is that I can make it that way.

04:56.900 --> 04:59.440
You can make it however you want and I can turn all the animations off.

04:59.440 --> 05:04.200
I can make it really, really simple or you can go completely the other way.

05:04.200 --> 05:07.240
But it is almost sort of made for tinkerers.

05:07.240 --> 05:11.420
And when they say powerful when needed, that's basically them saying incredibly complicated

05:11.420 --> 05:13.920
if you want it to be.

05:13.920 --> 05:19.140
And so the question is, are the defaults sane enough for the average user?

05:19.140 --> 05:21.200
And I don't know where I stand on that.

05:21.200 --> 05:24.840
They're certainly not for me, the defaults, because as I say, I have to turn all those

05:24.840 --> 05:25.840
animations off.

05:25.840 --> 05:27.840
But what do you think?

05:27.840 --> 05:30.760
Can you put yourself in an average user's shoes?

05:30.760 --> 05:32.720
To me, it feels like it's got a lot going on.

05:32.720 --> 05:35.120
It does still have a lot going on.

05:35.120 --> 05:37.080
And I love it for it.

05:37.080 --> 05:40.400
I mean, I really do because for me, that's what I want.

05:40.400 --> 05:44.080
And I'm glad that there is somebody making a desktop that can try to be a little more

05:44.080 --> 05:48.800
distraction free, but at the end of the day, still gives me the ability to choose particular

05:48.800 --> 05:50.560
individual niddly settings.

05:50.560 --> 05:54.920
I think that's a great, great, perfect balance for power users, which I think is going to

05:54.920 --> 05:57.420
be the predominant Linux desktop user.

05:57.420 --> 06:00.560
And I think it's going to make general Linux desktop more competitive.

06:00.560 --> 06:04.240
I think no one in particular now may have to respond to some of these nice features

06:04.240 --> 06:08.360
and at least consider how they could make their desktop more appealing to power users.

06:08.360 --> 06:13.560
But to your core point, Joe, I'm not so sure this is a great desktop for the quote unquote

06:13.560 --> 06:15.040
totally new user.

06:15.040 --> 06:18.320
And I think that's probably why you still see things like the Mate project doing really

06:18.320 --> 06:21.680
well and also a Cinnamon and others.

06:21.680 --> 06:26.400
There's still some, there is still a niche out there, but I'm a pretty big believer these

06:26.400 --> 06:30.880
days that that's a niche of a niche, just the random new user stumbling into Linux accidentally.

06:30.880 --> 06:33.360
I think it's now full of people that want to get work done.

06:33.360 --> 06:36.120
They're pretty familiar with their options and they just want something that works really

06:36.120 --> 06:38.560
well and gives them the features they want.

06:38.560 --> 06:41.360
I think there's going to be a good group of people out there that the Plasmid desktop

06:41.360 --> 06:42.880
is going to be pretty competitive for.

06:42.880 --> 06:43.880
Yeah.

06:43.880 --> 06:47.560
And the snap and flat pack support is a good hedge as far as I'm concerned.

06:47.560 --> 06:50.400
Don't put all your eggs in one basket because who knows which one of them is going to win

06:50.400 --> 06:51.400
out.

06:51.400 --> 06:54.340
And the reality is it's Linux, probably both.

06:54.340 --> 06:57.200
So that's good to see that support in there as well.

06:57.200 --> 07:00.760
You're not even putting all of your eggs in one distribution basket, but for those of

07:00.760 --> 07:06.100
us that may be looking more and more at XFCE these days, and I include myself in that particular

07:06.100 --> 07:08.160
basket, there could be some good news, Joe.

07:08.160 --> 07:09.160
Yeah.

07:09.160 --> 07:14.320
On the XFCE blog this week appeared a post, the road to XFCE 4.14.

07:14.320 --> 07:20.380
And so it's been a long time coming, but it looks like they are starting to ramp up, seriously

07:20.380 --> 07:27.340
ramp up the move to GTK 3, which is badly, badly needed.

07:27.340 --> 07:31.720
It's been on GTK 2 for the longest time now and it's starting to get left behind.

07:31.720 --> 07:36.280
You look at Marte, which has made the transition admirably and is looking really, really good

07:36.280 --> 07:42.400
on GTK 3, and XFCE basically needed to decide whether they were going to do this or die.

07:42.400 --> 07:45.680
And I was really worried that they were going to die, but it's looking good.

07:45.680 --> 07:47.160
We haven't got much yet.

07:47.160 --> 07:52.480
We had the panel that was ported last week, didn't mention that at the time.

07:52.480 --> 07:56.840
But now there is at least a plan in place to make this happen.

07:56.840 --> 07:58.920
So I'm really, really crossing my fingers.

07:58.920 --> 08:00.760
I just want this to happen.

08:00.760 --> 08:06.320
This transition is coming as part of the 4.14 release, do I understand that correctly?

08:06.320 --> 08:07.320
Yeah.

08:07.320 --> 08:12.360
And so they're trying to get to a GTK 3 minimum version of 3.20.

08:12.360 --> 08:20.800
And the reason why I mentioned that particular challenge is in the road to this 4.14 release,

08:20.800 --> 08:26.680
they've already had to shift the goalpost once because they were initially targeting

08:26.680 --> 08:31.800
GTK 3.14, which is very old now.

08:31.800 --> 08:35.200
And things have changed, things have broken in GTK since then.

08:35.200 --> 08:40.760
And so most distributions today are shipping with at least GTK 3.20.

08:40.760 --> 08:44.160
And so by the time they get this thing out, I bet you most of them will be running 3.22.

08:44.160 --> 08:50.160
Probably, yeah, because XFCE development is glacial, to say the least.

08:50.160 --> 08:54.440
So it may even be beyond that.

08:54.440 --> 09:00.200
I keep hearing that GTK 4, it's only around the corner, and they're still stuck on 2.

09:00.200 --> 09:04.960
So by the time they finally get GTK 3 ported properly and working, GTK 4 is going to be

09:04.960 --> 09:06.280
here.

09:06.280 --> 09:10.820
But as long as they can get GTK 3 working, that's good enough for me, especially being

09:10.820 --> 09:14.960
an LTS and Ubuntu LTS user, I can get a few years out of it.

09:14.960 --> 09:20.880
And then hopefully this will spur them on to then target GTK 4 next.

09:20.880 --> 09:23.800
I mean, that's a long way ahead.

09:23.800 --> 09:29.480
But XFCE to me, as I always say, is the perfect balance between features and weight.

09:29.480 --> 09:35.560
And as much as I am warming to KDE because I like all of the configuration options and

09:35.560 --> 09:39.480
stuff and because of the excellent Wayland support and all that, and the fact that it's

09:39.480 --> 09:46.240
a very modern, forward-looking desktop, XFCE still is very good.

09:46.240 --> 09:51.920
And you talked about potentially thinking about it, presumably for your infrastructure,

09:51.920 --> 09:54.600
not for your laptop or whatever, but for the studio infrastructure.

09:54.600 --> 09:55.600
Yeah, yeah.

09:55.600 --> 09:58.520
Yeah, for the main recording systems we're on.

09:58.520 --> 10:02.760
Just before Joe and I even started, my GNOME system crashed on me.

10:02.760 --> 10:05.020
And we had to wait for me to get my system back up.

10:05.020 --> 10:08.920
And our OBS system that GNOME Shell's on has been, GNOME Shell's been crashing a couple

10:08.920 --> 10:09.920
of times a day.

10:09.920 --> 10:13.200
I'm a huge GNOME 3 Shell fan, but I've been having problems with it.

10:13.200 --> 10:18.360
And it seems like XFCE could be the perfect solution for these production systems.

10:18.360 --> 10:26.280
And in some ways, the slow glacial development pace is a benefit because it means that I'm

10:26.280 --> 10:30.440
going to have something that is pretty solid in production for a few years.

10:30.440 --> 10:34.320
And it's one of the reasons why I also kind of just like good old Debian in some ways

10:34.320 --> 10:35.320
too.

10:35.320 --> 10:36.320
But what about Mate?

10:36.320 --> 10:38.600
Hasn't that somewhat rendered XFCE irrelevant?

10:38.600 --> 10:40.600
I almost feel like it's too much.

10:40.600 --> 10:47.220
If I'm going for that utility accessory appliance-like installation, it almost feels like Mate is

10:47.220 --> 10:49.240
too much of a desktop for me.

10:49.240 --> 10:53.520
And it is, at that point, well, if I'm going to run a full desktop, why not run the latest

10:53.520 --> 10:55.820
full desktop, the most modern full desktop?

10:55.820 --> 10:57.400
And that was why GNOME 3 came along.

10:57.400 --> 11:01.760
But we started with Mate, had a few problems with some, a couple of little itty-bitty stability

11:01.760 --> 11:03.920
things, a couple of graphics issues.

11:03.920 --> 11:04.920
But it wasn't bad.

11:04.920 --> 11:08.480
In fact, we ran it in production for a year in the studio.

11:08.480 --> 11:13.000
And then it was only later as we started using the machines more and more for more things,

11:13.000 --> 11:16.480
and more people, even people that don't normally use Linux, started sitting down in front of

11:16.480 --> 11:18.040
these computers to use them.

11:18.040 --> 11:21.140
We realized, well, if we're going to have a full desktop environment that has all the

11:21.140 --> 11:23.240
bells and whistles, let's just run GNOME Shell.

11:23.240 --> 11:26.240
Now, that's sort of emerging as a sort of a standard desktop.

11:26.240 --> 11:30.440
It was sort of a quote-unquote forward-looking move, I admit.

11:30.440 --> 11:32.700
And it just didn't really play out.

11:32.700 --> 11:35.560
Because at the end of the day, I realized I don't need that on any of these systems

11:35.560 --> 11:36.560
day to day.

11:36.560 --> 11:40.000
When we had everybody here in the studio working on the computers, it made sense.

11:40.000 --> 11:44.240
But now that it's just the regular crew, it really was way too much.

11:44.240 --> 11:46.600
I feel like Mate would still be way too much.

11:46.600 --> 11:50.600
Well, I'm sure Wimpress is crying into his headphones listening to this.

11:50.600 --> 11:56.880
No, I, you know, if I was going to do it, I only run one type of Mate, and that's Ubuntu

11:56.880 --> 11:57.880
Mate.

11:57.880 --> 11:58.880
And I mean it.

11:58.880 --> 11:59.880
I mean it.

11:59.880 --> 12:03.120
I've tried it on Arch, and I'm a much bigger fan of the implementation on Ubuntu Mate.

12:03.120 --> 12:04.360
So you can put that on a poster.

12:04.360 --> 12:06.480
Yeah, it is tightly integrated.

12:06.480 --> 12:11.040
If you've got someone who's a key player in the Mate project running his own distro, then

12:11.040 --> 12:12.680
you know you're going to get the best of it.

12:12.680 --> 12:13.680
Yeah, it's great.

12:13.680 --> 12:18.400
So speaking of distros that might be well-positioned to feature a desktop, Fedora 26 is coming

12:18.400 --> 12:20.720
out, and that's going to be a great desktop featuring Gnome Shell.

12:20.720 --> 12:22.360
Fedora always is.

12:22.360 --> 12:24.000
You're just going to have to wait a little bit.

12:24.000 --> 12:30.340
Yeah, delayed as usual, about a month at the moment by the looks of things.

12:30.340 --> 12:31.480
There's not much to say.

12:31.480 --> 12:32.680
It's expected, isn't it?

12:32.680 --> 12:40.080
And when I spoke to Matthew recently on Late Night Linux, we agreed that it's the kind

12:40.080 --> 12:44.240
of distro where you don't just push it out at an arbitrary date, you wait until it's

12:44.240 --> 12:45.240
ready.

12:45.240 --> 12:49.920
Not quite to the extent that Debian does, but it's a nice compromise, I think.

12:49.920 --> 12:53.680
Why push something out that's not ready just because you agreed to do it on a certain date?

12:53.680 --> 12:54.920
I so agree.

12:54.920 --> 12:57.080
And also congratulations to Matt.

12:57.080 --> 13:02.680
June 2nd was his third year anniversary, I believe, somewhere around there, of being

13:02.680 --> 13:04.720
the guy that ran the Fedora project.

13:04.720 --> 13:05.720
Somewhere.

13:05.720 --> 13:07.260
He's got to set a record now, I think, at this point.

13:07.260 --> 13:12.240
So that was a good chat if you guys haven't checked that episode of Late Night Linux out.

13:12.240 --> 13:15.340
I guess a couple of things hanging up the beta at this point.

13:15.340 --> 13:18.900
So because the beta is hung up, the release gets hung up, it's a domino effect.

13:18.900 --> 13:24.040
There are some issues causing RPM hangs after updating to a GLib 2.25.

13:24.040 --> 13:26.480
And of course, you can just go check the bug list if you care.

13:26.480 --> 13:29.000
OK, so let's talk about Core Boot.

13:29.000 --> 13:33.720
And that project has joined Conservancy as a member project.

13:33.720 --> 13:42.300
So Core Boot, as you probably know, is the free BIOS or EFI replacement, which I suppose

13:42.300 --> 13:48.720
is most commonly found on Chromebooks, kind of ironically, given Google's love of proprietary

13:48.720 --> 13:50.680
stuff as well.

13:50.680 --> 13:56.480
And they've decided to join Conservancy, who will look after not the kind of day-to-day

13:56.480 --> 14:00.920
code and stuff, but more of the administration that goes around it.

14:00.920 --> 14:04.160
And I can see why they'd want to do that, because that kind of stuff is just a real

14:04.160 --> 14:08.280
headache and you just want to get on with coding and testing and the actual interesting

14:08.280 --> 14:09.280
stuff.

14:09.280 --> 14:12.680
Yeah, and they say, this is Patrick, which is one of the long-term contributors to Core

14:12.680 --> 14:13.680
Boot.

14:13.680 --> 14:18.400
He says, by joining the Conservancy, Core Boot benefits from the project's organization

14:18.400 --> 14:22.640
in terms of not just how to structure your project, here's some of the files and papers

14:22.640 --> 14:25.600
and things and I's and T's you needed, all that.

14:25.600 --> 14:28.600
But they also take care of community organization.

14:28.600 --> 14:31.920
And I think that's probably a key part for people that just want to focus on code.

14:31.920 --> 14:33.360
Don't have to worry about the legal stuff.

14:33.360 --> 14:34.500
We want to have a great community.

14:34.500 --> 14:37.400
We want to have a healthy community, but we're so busy writing code, we can't really manage

14:37.400 --> 14:38.400
the community.

14:38.400 --> 14:44.800
If the Conservancy can help that, too, that could be really great.

14:44.800 --> 14:49.600
Thanks to Ting for sponsoring Linux Action News, last.ting.com, las.ting.com.

14:49.600 --> 14:54.140
Go there to support the show and get $25 off a Ting device.

14:54.140 --> 14:57.760
If you bring a device, and you might want to do that, they have a BYOD page, you'll

14:57.760 --> 15:01.480
get $25 in service credit, which gets applied to your line.

15:01.480 --> 15:03.760
Average Ting bill is about $23 a month.

15:03.760 --> 15:05.800
It's pay for what you use wireless.

15:05.800 --> 15:07.080
If you've got a family, it's great.

15:07.080 --> 15:11.480
So it's $6 for each line you want on the family plan, because it's sort of a family plan.

15:11.480 --> 15:14.600
It's just pay for what you want wireless, and you can just use it however you want.

15:14.600 --> 15:17.600
So I've got three devices, one for myself and two other family members.

15:17.600 --> 15:20.760
And it's like $37 to $40 a month, depending on our usage.

15:20.760 --> 15:23.600
Everywhere we go, we've got Wi-Fi, so I hardly ever pay for data.

15:23.600 --> 15:28.080
I treat the mobile network like backup signal, and I use Telegram for all my text messaging,

15:28.080 --> 15:32.560
so I pay nothing, almost nothing, unless something breaks, and I get a bunch of SMS alerts.

15:32.560 --> 15:33.560
And that's what's beautiful.

15:33.560 --> 15:39.800
Like, I had a busy month, my Linux Fest Northwest month, it was like a $34 month for me.

15:39.800 --> 15:43.960
And then, you know, I go back and maybe one month's like $23, depending on what's going

15:43.960 --> 15:44.960
on.

15:44.960 --> 15:47.420
It's pay for what you use wireless, and you're in complete control.

15:47.420 --> 15:51.640
You get all the information on their dashboard, in your app, and they have great customer

15:51.640 --> 15:52.640
service.

15:52.640 --> 15:56.680
And GSM, just get started by going to alas.ting.com.

15:56.680 --> 16:03.000
And a big thank you to Ting for sponsoring the Linux Action News.

16:03.000 --> 16:08.640
So by now, it's pretty clear that Linux has dominated almost every market, apart from

16:08.640 --> 16:09.640
the desktop.

16:09.640 --> 16:11.240
But let's not talk too much about that.

16:11.240 --> 16:17.800
It's dominated the server market, and cloud, and Internet of Things, and embedded devices,

16:17.800 --> 16:20.660
Android, that kind of thing.

16:20.660 --> 16:26.080
And now, it's looking like it's going to break into the automotive industry.

16:26.080 --> 16:30.720
I was initially a little skeptical when I saw what is going on here, but this is the

16:30.720 --> 16:33.920
Linux Foundation's automotive grade Linux project.

16:33.920 --> 16:36.920
And they're celebrating their first big name user.

16:36.920 --> 16:41.080
Toyota announced this week that they're going to employ automotive grade Linux in their

16:41.080 --> 16:47.800
2018 Camry model, which means that the infotainment dashboard system will be running Linux.

16:47.800 --> 16:48.880
And this is a big name.

16:48.880 --> 16:52.360
There's other big names in there, though, Mazda's in there, I think Ford is in there

16:52.360 --> 16:54.500
to some degree.

16:54.500 --> 16:57.320
There's some other good names in there, but none of them have really shipped anything.

16:57.320 --> 17:01.920
Toyota is one of the really originator forces behind this big effort.

17:01.920 --> 17:04.140
But it is a foundation project.

17:04.140 --> 17:08.740
And think of automotive grade Linux as essentially a Linux distribution for a car.

17:08.740 --> 17:11.620
It's mostly an 80% solution.

17:11.620 --> 17:16.360
The manufacturers of the car modify the OS to match their branding, and their look, and

17:16.360 --> 17:19.360
their display setup, and their accessories.

17:19.360 --> 17:24.800
And they write, it seems to be about 20% to 30% of their own code, depending on who you

17:24.800 --> 17:25.800
go by.

17:25.800 --> 17:29.080
But the whole idea here is to provide them with a base 80%.

17:29.080 --> 17:33.400
And that is, digging into this, that is a massive amount of things.

17:33.400 --> 17:39.240
It is a Linux system that uses Wayland, that interfaces with devices over the CAN bus.

17:39.240 --> 17:41.020
It's very sophisticated.

17:41.020 --> 17:45.160
And there's hopes for this to spread beyond just the infotainment system, aren't there?

17:45.160 --> 17:50.000
They seem to be really trying to design something that can control a lot of the car's environmental

17:50.000 --> 17:53.160
systems, lighting, sound, all of it.

17:53.160 --> 17:56.060
And they are already showing examples of that.

17:56.060 --> 18:01.160
They had a big showing at CES this year, where they had essentially a car dashboard using

18:01.160 --> 18:06.180
the actual car CAN bus, and DC power, and real peripherals, and fans that would be in

18:06.180 --> 18:07.660
like the air conditioner.

18:07.660 --> 18:12.960
They showed how you could run it all using Linux with automotive grades, essentially

18:12.960 --> 18:16.820
stock example interface that the manufacturers can modify.

18:16.820 --> 18:21.560
And it wouldn't necessarily control the timing of your engine, or the charge of your battery,

18:21.560 --> 18:24.080
but it could go pretty deep.

18:24.080 --> 18:27.600
The position of your chair, the memorization per user, and things like that.

18:27.600 --> 18:30.760
Well, they're going to want to keep that engine stuff completely proprietary, aren't they?

18:30.760 --> 18:34.720
Otherwise, how are they going to hide their emission test stuff?

18:34.720 --> 18:37.080
Heyo, that's probably true, Joe.

18:37.080 --> 18:38.440
But you know what it really solves?

18:38.440 --> 18:43.380
The car manufacturers are not the world's greatest software manufacturers.

18:43.380 --> 18:47.240
And what they've been sort of coalescing around right now is Q and X, and then blobbing on

18:47.240 --> 18:51.160
different proprietary components to achieve what they want to get to.

18:51.160 --> 18:57.200
And the sort of commonality feature set like over-the-air updates, and things like that

18:57.200 --> 19:00.400
have been missing because they're all inventing their own stack.

19:00.400 --> 19:03.720
And this is trying to solve that particular problem, which I think is pretty cool.

19:03.720 --> 19:06.880
They don't have things like over-the-air updates yet.

19:06.880 --> 19:10.800
Probably the biggest attraction is automotive grade Linux, at least at present from what

19:10.800 --> 19:14.600
I can tell, and I've reached out for comment, but I haven't heard back, is I don't believe

19:14.600 --> 19:18.320
they support Android Auto or Apple CarPlay.

19:18.320 --> 19:20.440
Yeah, that was something I was thinking about.

19:20.440 --> 19:24.420
Because now with Android Things, I mean, I know that's designed more for smaller things

19:24.420 --> 19:31.260
like thermostats and stuff, but why wouldn't you go for Android as a solution?

19:31.260 --> 19:34.400
Because that's almost kind of drop-in, isn't it?

19:34.400 --> 19:39.380
And then you're more likely to be able to work with other Android devices and iOS.

19:39.380 --> 19:43.900
My sense is, having looked at this project a bit, when I deep-dived, they have a pretty

19:43.900 --> 19:44.900
good wiki.

19:44.900 --> 19:48.960
And you, as a manufacturer, there's a lot of information you need, and there's specs

19:48.960 --> 19:53.680
you need, and there's all kinds of things that you have to consider when you're building

19:53.680 --> 19:57.780
that they just lay out and document for you with automotive grade Linux.

19:57.780 --> 20:02.840
And I suspect that because particular nature of communicating on the CAN bus and the security

20:02.840 --> 20:07.520
requirements and working with different interfaces and working with different accessories like

20:07.520 --> 20:13.100
knobs and controls on the steering wheel, I bet you it turned out to be more straightforward

20:13.100 --> 20:17.160
to build something based on Linux from the ground up than to use Android.

20:17.160 --> 20:19.200
Plus then you don't have that Google strategy tax.

20:19.200 --> 20:21.200
Yeah, I suppose.

20:21.200 --> 20:24.360
You have to feel a little bit bad for Canonical in all of this, though, don't you?

20:24.360 --> 20:30.340
Because that's kind of the market, not specifically automotive, but certainly embedded systems.

20:30.340 --> 20:33.020
That's kind of where they're putting all their eggs now.

20:33.020 --> 20:36.320
You're right, although I suppose you could probably deploy some of this using SNAP packages

20:36.320 --> 20:40.540
or using something like Ubuntu Core to run the core operating system.

20:40.540 --> 20:43.420
So there could be room for them still to play in this.

20:43.420 --> 20:46.060
Going back a bit, though, I don't know if the market's going to care about Apple Car

20:46.060 --> 20:47.700
Play or Android Auto.

20:47.700 --> 20:49.200
I think some of them might.

20:49.200 --> 20:51.940
It's getting more and more, maybe more and more traction these days.

20:51.940 --> 20:56.160
It seems like something, though, that automotive grade Linux could add on with the right deals

20:56.160 --> 20:57.160
in place.

20:57.160 --> 20:58.880
It doesn't seem like the system inherently prevents it.

20:58.880 --> 21:03.660
But an open source base where they complete about 80% of it, digging in there means you

21:03.660 --> 21:08.260
get things like multi-architecture support, people auditing the security, people working

21:08.260 --> 21:09.700
on patches to Wayland.

21:09.700 --> 21:14.100
They're going to be hiring a contractor here very soon to go in and add additional code

21:14.100 --> 21:16.100
and support in Wayland.

21:16.100 --> 21:21.780
You get real good contributions back upstream by having something like this go across industry.

21:21.780 --> 21:25.300
And they've got, in total, more than 90 companies involved with this thing.

21:25.300 --> 21:30.260
Yeah, let's hope that they get the package management sorted out and the upgrades organized

21:30.260 --> 21:35.060
properly so that you're not ending up with insecure cars out there.

21:35.060 --> 21:36.060
It's on their roadmap.

21:36.060 --> 21:37.900
So that gives me some hope.

21:37.900 --> 21:39.740
But we actually have to see it happen.

21:39.740 --> 21:40.740
All right.

21:40.740 --> 21:45.140
Well, let's talk more about Android to an extent.

21:45.140 --> 21:50.820
And Andy Rubin, who was, I'm thinking he was the actual founder of Android in the first

21:50.820 --> 21:51.820
place.

21:51.820 --> 21:52.820
Yeah, him and his team.

21:52.820 --> 21:53.820
Yeah.

21:53.820 --> 21:54.820
And he worked at Danger.

21:54.820 --> 21:55.820
Yep, correct.

21:55.820 --> 21:56.820
Yeah.

21:56.820 --> 22:03.260
He has announced a new company, Essential, and a new OS, Ambient OS.

22:03.260 --> 22:07.760
And so basically, they've got a phone that is almost ready to ship, which is just stock

22:07.760 --> 22:14.620
Android and has attracted a lot of attention for reasons that are a little bit baffling,

22:14.620 --> 22:15.700
but we'll get back to that.

22:15.700 --> 22:22.680
But what's more interesting to me is their smart home platform, which is Ambient OS.

22:22.680 --> 22:27.180
And it's going to be, he doesn't like to call it an Echo competitor, but let's face it,

22:27.180 --> 22:29.660
it's basically an Echo competitor.

22:29.660 --> 22:35.100
And the fact that we might get a proper open source version of it, albeit more Android

22:35.100 --> 22:39.860
throw it over the wall style open source, if that succeeds, that's got to be better

22:39.860 --> 22:44.260
than what we've got with Amazon and Alexa.

22:44.260 --> 22:45.700
That does seem like a long shot.

22:45.700 --> 22:47.060
Ambient OS is a bit of an unknown.

22:47.060 --> 22:49.820
I assume it's Linux based, but that's just me kind of taking a guess.

22:49.820 --> 22:54.220
And we've got hints that it's going to be open source and they have solutions to prevent

22:54.220 --> 22:56.560
people from not updating and things like that.

22:56.560 --> 22:57.660
It looks nice.

22:57.660 --> 23:02.080
It's like a puck that's angled upwards with a touch LCD round screen on it.

23:02.080 --> 23:08.980
So it combines, it's a really nice looking version of an Echo in a tube with an LCD screen.

23:08.980 --> 23:13.980
Well, yeah, it's like that Echo, what's the Echo with the screen that's-

23:13.980 --> 23:14.980
Echo Show?

23:14.980 --> 23:18.500
Yeah, it's kind of the best of both worlds to me.

23:18.500 --> 23:22.220
Because you don't want a big stand up basically tablet with a stand, do you?

23:22.220 --> 23:24.540
Otherwise you just use a tablet.

23:24.540 --> 23:27.140
I have to note the timing of all of this.

23:27.140 --> 23:32.400
I do not think it's a coincidence that Andy Rubin is up on stage making a big deal about

23:32.400 --> 23:36.700
a pre-production cell phone and about a pre-production home assistant.

23:36.700 --> 23:40.480
I think these two things are more related than it seems.

23:40.480 --> 23:43.700
And I have to acknowledge that tomorrow is WWDC.

23:43.700 --> 23:47.020
Yeah where they're almost definitely going to announce the Apple home or whatever they're

23:47.020 --> 23:48.020
going to call it.

23:48.020 --> 23:52.820
It's Siri in a tube and it's key competitive advantage over the Echo in a tube is going

23:52.820 --> 23:56.220
to be the fact that you also have Siri in your pocket and the two can work together

23:56.220 --> 24:01.980
on location stuff and it is more useful to have the same two things in your pocket.

24:01.980 --> 24:05.260
It's the same advantage that Google Assistant has once it gets rolled out across enough

24:05.260 --> 24:07.700
devices and people buy the actual tube.

24:07.700 --> 24:12.100
And I think that's why Andy Rubin is on stage right now talking about it because come Monday

24:12.100 --> 24:15.100
it's going to be obvious old news to everybody else.

24:15.100 --> 24:17.020
Yeah, that's the key thing here.

24:17.020 --> 24:21.300
He has to deliver this quickly because let's circle back to the phone right.

24:21.300 --> 24:24.100
That is basically a stock Android phone.

24:24.100 --> 24:29.980
I think it's going to have an unlocked bootloader so it's kind of in the OnePlus territory.

24:29.980 --> 24:33.540
You know the OnePlus 3T is the current one, the OnePlus 5 is coming soon because they've

24:33.540 --> 24:34.860
decided to skip 4.

24:34.860 --> 24:35.900
It does seem nice.

24:35.900 --> 24:40.820
It's got titanium around the edges, it's got a ceramic back, it's got a full glass front.

24:40.820 --> 24:43.260
It looks like a nice stock Android phone.

24:43.260 --> 24:51.140
And it's not that expensive is it, well I mean it's expensive to me, $800 I think.

24:51.140 --> 24:52.140
Kind of quite steep.

24:52.140 --> 24:55.580
I think it works out in the States it's slightly less than a Pixel.

24:55.580 --> 24:58.420
Yeah, which is well overpriced as far as I'm concerned.

24:58.420 --> 25:01.360
It's basically iPhone territory which is just ludicrous.

25:01.360 --> 25:02.360
But there we go.

25:02.360 --> 25:08.020
But what makes it interesting to me I suppose apart from the aesthetics of it which do look

25:08.020 --> 25:16.460
nice is this modularity where it's got, well he described it as wireless USB-C or USB 3.

25:16.460 --> 25:20.900
Yeah he said it was a 60Hz USB 3.0 wireless chip.

25:20.900 --> 25:26.220
Yeah and two metal contacts which are magnetic to provide power for things that need it.

25:26.220 --> 25:31.940
And the only accessory they've got now is this 360 degree camera which looks a bit,

25:31.940 --> 25:36.140
well you're going to look like a bit of a prat aren't you walking around with that strapped

25:36.140 --> 25:37.140
to your phone.

25:37.140 --> 25:43.580
You could get some very small things like extra storage maybe, but again no headphone

25:43.580 --> 25:44.580
jack.

25:44.580 --> 25:50.620
I mean he is trying to be Pixel, iPhone, he's trying to go in at the top of the market.

25:50.620 --> 25:57.420
In fact he tries to use his new market advantage to say this is what gives us our edge because

25:57.420 --> 26:02.220
he says because we don't have large scale we can do things at manufacturing that are

26:02.220 --> 26:07.620
so new that the bigger guys can't do at their large scale so we can do nanotubes and we

26:07.620 --> 26:14.340
can do things that are really unique that only work at 100,000 devices and we'll then

26:14.340 --> 26:18.280
just scale up the manufacturing as our sales scale up and we'll be able to stay more competitive

26:18.280 --> 26:19.280
that way.

26:19.280 --> 26:24.820
But he's totally failing to acknowledge the reality that every other smartphone OS and

26:24.820 --> 26:28.180
every other smartphone manufacturer and every other smartphone player has to face.

26:28.180 --> 26:31.840
It doesn't matter if he's running stock Android or if they somehow decided to port

26:31.840 --> 26:35.260
Ambient OS to the phone one day, which he doesn't think they'll ever do.

26:35.260 --> 26:37.060
He thinks it's perfectly fine running Android.

26:37.060 --> 26:38.060
He probably would.

26:38.060 --> 26:40.060
He helped create it.

26:40.060 --> 26:42.060
What is the end goal here?

26:42.060 --> 26:43.060
What are you going after?

26:43.060 --> 26:45.420
You're going after the Pixel which barely sells?

26:45.420 --> 26:48.400
You really have to be going after the Samsung S8 I would think.

26:48.400 --> 26:52.540
Which is just not going to happen without serious carrier support.

26:52.540 --> 26:57.100
And this is the same thing we've watched Canonical go through, the same thing we watched Mozilla

26:57.100 --> 26:58.820
go through.

26:58.820 --> 27:00.280
This is not a new story.

27:00.280 --> 27:03.700
And it would be interesting to see if Andy is successful here.

27:03.700 --> 27:05.460
Or because this will be telling.

27:05.460 --> 27:10.560
If he's able to find a niche and he's able to push forward with an ecosystem of accessories

27:10.560 --> 27:15.620
that magnetically snap on, home assistance that compete with the Echo and a phone that

27:15.620 --> 27:17.180
competes with the Pixel.

27:17.180 --> 27:20.220
And he seems like he's got some good ideas behind him.

27:20.220 --> 27:21.660
He's all about publishing the specs.

27:21.660 --> 27:25.620
So they're going to publish the spec of the wireless USB and the magnetic connector.

27:25.620 --> 27:29.100
They're going to work to try to make as much of this stuff open as possible like their

27:29.100 --> 27:30.500
ambient OS.

27:30.500 --> 27:34.020
If I was going to buy an Android phone I might want to buy a phone from a company that has

27:34.020 --> 27:35.020
his philosophies.

27:35.020 --> 27:38.940
That seems appealing to me but it still seems like such a long haul.

27:38.940 --> 27:40.620
And they're already under a little bit of fire.

27:40.620 --> 27:44.980
Well you know I've mentioned this already but you're talking about taking on Samsung

27:44.980 --> 27:46.360
or even Google.

27:46.360 --> 27:49.620
To me I don't think that's what the play is with the phone.

27:49.620 --> 27:51.100
To me it's very straightforward.

27:51.100 --> 27:52.820
It's an attack on OnePlus.

27:52.820 --> 27:57.340
Because OnePlus became successful with no advertising, just word of mouth.

27:57.340 --> 28:01.120
Because they had a high spec phone for a very low price.

28:01.120 --> 28:06.740
And it was running Cyanogen OS which was essentially stock Android with a couple of tweaks.

28:06.740 --> 28:10.180
And then they fell out with them and now they've got Oxygen OS which apparently is quite good.

28:10.180 --> 28:11.180
I don't know.

28:11.180 --> 28:12.540
I haven't run it for a long, long time.

28:12.540 --> 28:17.460
Is it an attack or is it just a step aside kids and let the adults show you how we do

28:17.460 --> 28:18.460
this?

28:18.460 --> 28:19.460
Oh yeah okay.

28:19.460 --> 28:20.460
Attack is the wrong word.

28:20.460 --> 28:21.460
A market attack.

28:21.460 --> 28:22.460
They're not going to bad mouth them or anything like that.

28:22.460 --> 28:26.260
But they're going to try and sell as an American company.

28:26.260 --> 28:30.420
I'm sure it's all going to be made in the Far East but rather than being a Chinese company.

28:30.420 --> 28:36.340
Now I'm not trying to be anti-American here but I think the reality is that a lot of Americans

28:36.340 --> 28:38.780
would rather buy an American phone than a Chinese one.

28:38.780 --> 28:42.380
I would generally agree with you however it doesn't seem to have changed the market at

28:42.380 --> 28:49.340
all because unless I'm mistaken, and I probably am, isn't the only phone, there's no phone

28:49.340 --> 28:50.820
manufactured in the States right?

28:50.820 --> 28:53.500
I can't think of any phone that's manufactured in the States anymore.

28:53.500 --> 28:56.980
Yeah I wouldn't have thought so but if you're going to buy an iPhone then it's designed

28:56.980 --> 28:57.980
in California.

28:57.980 --> 29:00.260
Right, at least it's owned by an American company.

29:00.260 --> 29:01.260
Yeah exactly.

29:01.260 --> 29:02.260
I suppose so.

29:02.260 --> 29:03.580
And this is an American company.

29:03.580 --> 29:05.020
Yeah that's true.

29:05.020 --> 29:09.500
I think, and this is wild speculation, I think that they're going to basically try and go

29:09.500 --> 29:16.380
after the OnePlus kind of market for people who want stock Android and no bloat on their

29:16.380 --> 29:21.740
phone or whatever and that is going to finance Ambient OS and this home device of theirs.

29:21.740 --> 29:26.820
I think that that is the real play here because phones, I mean as he said in this interview

29:26.820 --> 29:32.980
with Walt, phones are kind of yesterday's news really that they've already, that market

29:32.980 --> 29:40.060
saturated and assistance and AI and machine learning and all that stuff is the new hotness

29:40.060 --> 29:45.060
and so he's trying to get into that but that is a very expensive and complicated world

29:45.060 --> 29:51.220
and industry to get into as Mycroft have found out and although he has got quite a lot of

29:51.220 --> 29:58.620
VC funding behind him to actually establish the brand and shift some units of something

29:58.620 --> 30:04.900
even if it's just a phone might convince them to invest more and might build the brand and

30:04.900 --> 30:12.020
so that to me seems to be the end goal of his is to get this home, this Echo competitor

30:12.020 --> 30:20.340
to be a mainstream device which is lofty ambition and okay he did create Android but not as

30:20.340 --> 30:21.340
we know it now.

30:21.340 --> 30:25.220
If you look at what he created it was pretty terrible wasn't it compared to what we've

30:25.220 --> 30:26.220
got now.

30:26.220 --> 30:29.940
Yeah and some of the deals that he created to make the operating system successful I

30:29.940 --> 30:33.620
think are why we are where we are at with Android.

30:33.620 --> 30:41.520
So he's clearly a sharp businessman and he can present pretty well on stage and in public.

30:41.520 --> 30:45.460
So Joe is the thing to take away from this that the lady in the tube is the next big

30:45.460 --> 30:48.820
market that's 2018's big competitive market?

30:48.820 --> 30:53.460
No the thing to take away from this is that the big tech companies think that the lady

30:53.460 --> 30:54.580
in the tube is the next thing.

30:54.580 --> 30:58.180
They all want more information and they think the lady in the tube is the next best way

30:58.180 --> 30:59.180
to get that information.

30:59.180 --> 31:04.060
Well the same way they thought that wearables were the next big thing and that has just

31:04.060 --> 31:05.780
not happened has it?

31:05.780 --> 31:12.360
I've got one and I wear my watch all the time and it's found a niche market but unlike with

31:12.360 --> 31:17.200
phones and then tablets which again are declining now they have tried to create this market

31:17.200 --> 31:21.980
and they've pushed really hard with it but how many people have bought an Echo or an

31:21.980 --> 31:27.940
Echo Dot and been enthusiastic asking it the weather for a few weeks, a few months and

31:27.940 --> 31:31.740
then eventually they get annoyed with it and either forget that it's there listening to

31:31.740 --> 31:35.820
them all the time or just unplug it and stick it in a cupboard and definitely don't buy

31:35.820 --> 31:38.220
the new version of it.

31:38.220 --> 31:43.100
Maybe I'm being cynical here but for me it's what they think is the next big thing because

31:43.100 --> 31:47.860
they can't sell any more phones to people because phones have got good enough now why

31:47.860 --> 31:52.300
do I need a new one unless I drop it sort of thing.

31:52.300 --> 31:54.020
Yeah you're probably right.

31:54.020 --> 31:58.900
I find mine to be pretty useful and I've stuck to it so I think if you get the right use

31:58.900 --> 32:00.780
cases they can be.

32:00.780 --> 32:06.020
Your use case is niche man like running a studio with it okay that's very very niche

32:06.020 --> 32:10.500
and I'm sure people will find uses in an industry and stuff but it's not going to be this mass

32:10.500 --> 32:12.900
consumer device I don't think.

32:12.900 --> 32:13.900
I think you're right.

32:13.900 --> 32:18.060
I would say it's going to be much more successful in industries and that's huge that's a huge

32:18.060 --> 32:24.540
market this probably shouldn't be underestimated but I kind of think that a lot of this smart

32:24.540 --> 32:28.340
control stuff is going to start getting baked in over the years so you won't have to get

32:28.340 --> 32:33.860
a $25 AC outlet that has a Wi-Fi chip in it that then your Echo uses it'll just start

32:33.860 --> 32:37.820
getting baked into the TVs and the lamps and the light bulbs and then it's nice to have

32:37.820 --> 32:41.300
one thing instead of having to have five or six different apps to turn these things on

32:41.300 --> 32:42.300
and off.

32:42.300 --> 32:45.660
Unless you've tried it I know it sounds crazy so I'm going to shut up right now about it

32:45.660 --> 32:49.460
because I know it sounds ridiculous I thought it was ridiculous you know what I think is

32:49.460 --> 32:54.900
ridiculous that an accessories manufacturer is trying to stop Andy Rubin's attempt before

32:54.900 --> 32:58.740
they even get off the ground and launch a single product.

32:58.740 --> 33:04.700
Yeah I mean this is just someone wanting a paycheck isn't it at the end of the day.

33:04.700 --> 33:09.860
Spigen I think is the company they make some phone cases and stuff and one of their brands

33:09.860 --> 33:15.540
is essential it's such a generic word that even if they do win or settle out of court

33:15.540 --> 33:22.180
it's only going to be a couple hundred thousand dollars maybe or maybe a tiny like one cent

33:22.180 --> 33:26.860
on every device sold which might add up for them and so fair play to them but I don't

33:26.860 --> 33:29.340
think it's going to stop Andy doing what he wants to do.

33:29.340 --> 33:33.500
Andy wants us all to call it the essential phone you see how he did that essential yeah

33:33.500 --> 33:37.260
that's clever that's clever we'll see if it goes anywhere though.

33:37.260 --> 33:40.300
Yeah it's definitely one to watch and there's been a lot of hype about it so we couldn't

33:40.300 --> 33:44.620
ignore it but yeah and ambient OS could be another Linux based OS that could be open

33:44.620 --> 33:47.740
source so that's something else to keep an eye out for too yeah definitely.

33:47.740 --> 33:51.260
