Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, episode 238, recorded on April 7th, 2022. I'm Chris.

00:10.320 --> 00:11.320
And I'm Wes.

00:11.320 --> 00:14.300
Hello, Wes. Let's do the news.

00:14.300 --> 00:20.780
We start this week, in the midst of the spring release season, with the new 22.04 LTS version

00:20.780 --> 00:23.780
of Pop!OS hitting the mirrors.

00:23.780 --> 00:30.120
That's on top of the well-received Ubuntu 22.04 core, System76's release is putting an emphasis

00:30.120 --> 00:37.000
on workflow customization, auto-tiling, and a heavy focus on a ready-to-go development

00:37.000 --> 00:38.600
environment.

00:38.600 --> 00:44.480
And 22.04 features their GNOME-based Cosmic Desktop, which is really pretty close in terms

00:44.480 --> 00:49.180
of overall look and theme from what you saw in 21.10, but of course now with improvements

00:49.180 --> 00:55.200
throughout some of those that you get just by now being based on GNOME 42, and all of

00:55.200 --> 00:59.840
the goodies that has, including GTK4, which means you're going to see some improvements

00:59.840 --> 01:02.000
in performance likely as well.

01:02.000 --> 01:07.080
And one thing that I wanted to mention that just sort of jumped out at me was Pop!OS 22.04

01:07.080 --> 01:11.760
now introduces this updated support panel in the GNOME Settings app. And in there, this

01:11.760 --> 01:18.020
page tells you what your computer and OS model and version are. It provides links to documentation

01:18.020 --> 01:24.080
and the Pop! community chat, and the ability to archive your recent logs up and send them

01:24.080 --> 01:25.740
off to support.

01:25.740 --> 01:31.400
Pop! Shop also received some nice updates, now highlights recently updated apps, and

01:31.400 --> 01:37.480
features improved package management operations. But with those more, let's say, mundane

01:37.480 --> 01:43.500
changes out of the way, one of the bigger changes as far as we're personally concerned,

01:43.500 --> 01:46.960
Pop! now defaults to Pipewire.

01:46.960 --> 01:51.120
This feels like a big step because this is an LTS release, let's keep in mind. And so

01:51.120 --> 01:56.360
this is something maybe we wouldn't have expected traditionally, but I love it. And I think

01:56.360 --> 02:01.640
that personally, you take some decisions like that, and you combine them with System76's

02:01.640 --> 02:07.560
commitment to ship newer kernels as they release. That to me is going to be an interesting recipe

02:07.560 --> 02:11.660
for a new kind of LTS that I want to keep my eyes on.

02:11.660 --> 02:16.920
And speaking of those updates, Pop! 2204 has automatic update options now in the GNOME

02:16.920 --> 02:21.240
panel that you can set like a time of day and week to automatically do the updates for

02:21.240 --> 02:28.240
the system. And in there, there is now an option for not just Debian packages, not just

02:28.240 --> 02:33.160
Flatpacks, but for Nix packages as well.

02:33.160 --> 02:36.720
Wait, Nix? Really?

02:36.720 --> 02:41.280
Isn't that something? I did not expect this. I haven't followed the beta super closely

02:41.280 --> 02:47.400
for this. And so I was really surprised when I saw this. We dug into this a bit. We'll

02:47.400 --> 02:52.240
have some links in the show notes, and we've emailed System76 for more information. But

02:52.240 --> 02:57.320
it seems that there's like a backend service called the Pop! System Updater. And this has

02:57.320 --> 03:03.120
facilities for these different types of packages that you might have installed, Debs, Flatpacks,

03:03.120 --> 03:04.720
and Nix packages.

03:04.720 --> 03:12.320
And of course, it's written in Rust. It's not all good news just yet, though. It's

03:12.320 --> 03:17.640
probably worth mentioning that the Raspberry Pi 4 images for 2204 with Pop! Well, they're

03:17.640 --> 03:23.680
not quite ready yet. So the ones available are still based on 2110. But it does sound

03:23.680 --> 03:31.400
like work is underway. We'll just have to be a little bit patient.

03:31.400 --> 03:35.960
While speaking of Ubuntu 2204, one of the new features Canonical drew attention to during

03:35.960 --> 03:41.160
the release was the support for a real time kernel beta. But now we're learning some

03:41.160 --> 03:45.000
more details on how that's exactly going to work.

03:45.000 --> 03:51.720
Now most of us never actually need a quote real time kernel day to day. But for some

03:51.720 --> 03:59.280
industrial applications, a guaranteed window of execution is absolutely critical. You know,

03:59.280 --> 04:06.820
for industries like telecom, manufacturing, and of course, space robots. And while real

04:06.820 --> 04:13.200
time patches, known as preempt RT, have been out there for years now, there was never really

04:13.200 --> 04:19.520
an official way to get that kernel built on Ubuntu and supported by Canonical.

04:19.520 --> 04:26.280
Well, 2204, that's changing. Well, as long as you're willing to sign up for Ubuntu

04:26.280 --> 04:31.600
Advantage. If you're interested, there is the free tier of Canonical's Linux enterprise

04:31.600 --> 04:37.960
subscription plan with extended security maintenance, kernel line patching support, landscape, and

04:37.960 --> 04:45.600
a few other offerings. Now, that comes with the Ubuntu real time kernel access as well.

04:45.600 --> 04:50.760
I suppose this isn't super surprising. This is a kind of a continuation of Canonical's

04:50.760 --> 04:55.880
enterprise OS as a service. You can get the free Ubuntu, you can even run it for five

04:55.880 --> 05:01.180
years for free. But if you want to pay for Ubuntu Advantage, you get all of these enterprise

05:01.180 --> 05:07.880
capabilities that make it appealing. And it sells itself to a lot of customers. And now

05:07.880 --> 05:12.320
they're adding another perk to that program, another feature set to that program. I was

05:12.320 --> 05:16.000
actually surprised by the real time kernel support itself, because didn't really see

05:16.000 --> 05:20.120
it come up much during the beta. It wasn't in the repos. So you know, we didn't see it

05:20.120 --> 05:24.920
like at one point, I did look at all the available kernels. But now we know why because it's

05:24.920 --> 05:28.760
been rolled into this Ubuntu Advantage program. And so it's going to be coming from there.

05:28.760 --> 05:33.760
And I wouldn't be surprised going forward, if we see other enterprise specific features

05:33.760 --> 05:39.760
may be similar to this or in the same vein, show up as Ubuntu Advantage only over time,

05:39.760 --> 05:44.760
maybe with some time, a free PPA becomes available or something like this. But this does seem

05:44.760 --> 05:51.640
to be a continuation of this idea they have to monetize Ubuntu on the server. And when

05:51.640 --> 05:57.080
their goal is to IPO next year, it makes sense that they would be wanting to add competitive

05:57.080 --> 06:02.280
features like this.

06:02.280 --> 06:07.480
What feels like a million years ago, back in 2020, we covered the new NTFS file system

06:07.480 --> 06:13.040
driver that Paragon software was contributing to the kernel. This driver was previously

06:13.040 --> 06:18.840
a proprietary commercial offering from Paragon, who after years of selling that commercial

06:18.840 --> 06:24.960
driver decided to contribute that code upstream. It features full read write support and a

06:24.960 --> 06:28.960
ton of other features that were not found in the old NTFS driver.

06:28.960 --> 06:36.040
Right, this was seen as a bit of a moment because finally, we would have a real true

06:36.040 --> 06:44.520
safe NTFS driver in Linux. And then when we covered the actual deployment in Linux 515,

06:44.520 --> 06:51.240
we thought, well, okay, we can wipe our hands of this. It's a start of a new era. We have

06:51.240 --> 06:58.280
full NTFS support in Linux. It was time to format your drives, boys.

06:58.280 --> 07:07.000
Oh, it was a sweet, sweet feeling. But seems not destined to last because unfortunately,

07:07.000 --> 07:13.560
less than one year later, concerns are being raised that the driver is already orphaned

07:13.560 --> 07:20.440
and not being actively maintained. Paragon software did pledge to keep the driver maintained

07:20.440 --> 07:26.840
as part of the process of getting it upstreamed into the kernel. But since 515 landed, there

07:26.840 --> 07:33.520
haven't been any major updates, despite there even being a few fixes already queued up.

07:33.520 --> 07:39.840
Man, that is unfortunate. And you know, the kernel team tried to get that pledge. Yeah,

07:39.840 --> 07:44.880
hey, all right, we'll do this. But don't leave us high and dry. And props to Michael Larbel

07:44.880 --> 07:48.800
over at Feronix, who kind of put all this together. And he notes that one of the developers

07:48.800 --> 07:54.240
that contributed a number of patches to that NTFS3 code during the review process, Cary

07:54.240 --> 07:59.160
Oligrander, well, they raised concerns over the state of the Paragon driver to several

07:59.160 --> 08:04.080
people. They've also noted that they've been unable to get any response from Paragon's

08:04.080 --> 08:07.440
maintainer. It's been virtual radio silence.

08:07.440 --> 08:12.760
Yeah, Cary raised those concerns on the mailing list and kind of classified the driver as

08:12.760 --> 08:19.120
this point being effectively orphaned at the same time making an offer to co maintain the

08:19.120 --> 08:24.800
driver. Although that offer is complicated because so far, there's been no response yet

08:24.800 --> 08:27.000
from the currently recognized maintainer.

08:27.000 --> 08:33.360
Oh, what a mess, Wes. What a what a stinking mess. You hate to see this happen. And now

08:33.360 --> 08:38.160
it's naturally raised questions if this driver should be removed from the mainline, or at

08:38.160 --> 08:43.680
least what action should be taken now. We'll definitely be keeping our eyes on this one,

08:43.680 --> 08:52.160
but maybe don't rely too much on that NTFS support on Linux for now.

08:52.160 --> 08:57.800
Checking in on the slow rollout of the Steam Deck for a moment, it seems sales have remained

08:57.800 --> 09:03.720
strong. The Deck has held the number two top grossing product on Steam for five weeks in

09:03.720 --> 09:09.440
a row, according to SteamDB. And this week, the Steam Deck grossed more sales than even

09:09.440 --> 09:13.640
the massively popular new game Elden Ring.

09:13.640 --> 09:20.640
And probably all this success likely means delays the our Steam Deck community estimates

09:20.640 --> 09:28.240
that Valve is still working through the first 15 minutes of pre orders from July 16 2021.

09:28.240 --> 09:33.520
Now it depends on the model you ordered. Some queues have been moving faster, but the US

09:33.520 --> 09:39.400
only just made it past hour one, and only with the 64 gigabyte model. Now this is changing

09:39.400 --> 09:44.620
all the time. So we'll put a link to that thread so you can get the most up to date

09:44.620 --> 09:46.920
community estimates.

09:46.920 --> 09:52.840
And while most of us sit here and wait, the Decks client software keeps getting better

09:52.840 --> 09:59.080
and better. From pushing firmware updates, OS fixes, and just some nice to have features,

09:59.080 --> 10:05.640
it seems like Valve is pushing development ahead at a pretty rapid pace. Though it does

10:05.640 --> 10:11.840
leave us wondering a bit if it might still be some time before we see a standalone release

10:11.840 --> 10:13.400
of SteamOS 3.

10:13.400 --> 10:18.480
Oh, come on, Valve. We want it already. Although I could see what you're saying there. If they're

10:18.480 --> 10:23.760
still doing a bunch of updates, they're probably not likely to drop it over the fence for the

10:23.760 --> 10:24.760
public yet.

10:24.760 --> 10:30.420
Let us test it for you, Valve. We'll give it a go. There's also good news in Deckland,

10:30.420 --> 10:35.000
the compatibility layer that makes those Windows games go on Steam and on the Deck. That got

10:35.000 --> 10:42.200
a solid update this week. Proton 7.0-2 is out now, and it is considered the new main

10:42.200 --> 10:48.000
stable version of Proton going forward. And it has an impressive new list of games that

10:48.000 --> 10:53.240
are now playable via Proton. And that Elden Ring we just mentioned is one of them, as

10:53.240 --> 11:00.040
well as many others.

11:00.040 --> 11:05.960
As you may have noticed, Matrix is one of our favorite up and coming platforms. And

11:05.960 --> 11:13.320
in some exciting news, the leading chat client Element has rolled out threads in beta.

11:13.320 --> 11:18.600
Threads help you separate conversations from the main timeline. Starting a new thread opens

11:18.600 --> 11:23.540
a thread view where you can continue your conversation without interruption or interrupting

11:23.540 --> 11:28.520
any other conversations or topics that are going on in the main timeline. It's really

11:28.520 --> 11:33.720
quite great to see this feature roll out as more and more free software projects and fans

11:33.720 --> 11:39.960
adopt Matrix as sort of their main place to communicate. But it's also been nice to

11:39.960 --> 11:45.240
see because Element the client, well, it just keeps getting better with improvement after

11:45.240 --> 11:51.720
improvement and more layers of polish. If you haven't checked it out in a while, maybe

11:51.720 --> 11:57.320
go create an account on Matrix.org and then join us in the Linux Action News Feedback

11:57.320 --> 12:03.880
channel that we'll have linked in the show notes.

12:03.880 --> 12:10.200
Linode.com slash LAN. Go there to get $100 in 60 day credit on a new account and you

12:10.200 --> 12:16.320
go there to support the show. Linode is the Linux geeks cloud with 11 data centers worldwide.

12:16.320 --> 12:21.220
They've been hard at work for almost 19 years, creating the best experience for running applications

12:21.220 --> 12:25.520
on Linux. If you need a personal small site or you need something that's going to possibly

12:25.520 --> 12:30.640
entertain millions of visitors, they have systems that scale to that. I was just thinking

12:30.640 --> 12:35.200
of the large box that we deployed for our Matrix installation just recently. That's

12:35.200 --> 12:41.020
a great example. I think we started at a $10 a month Linode and then over time we just

12:41.020 --> 12:47.520
resized it as we needed. As the user base grew, we resized the system to meet our needs

12:47.520 --> 12:53.240
and it's worked so great. Now we have a system with 48 cores and 96 gigs of RAM. You know,

12:53.240 --> 12:58.120
it's pretty screaming fast and also you can get them now with NVMe PCIe storage. So it

12:58.120 --> 13:03.820
can just be unbelievably fast on disk IO as well. And they have the best customer support,

13:03.820 --> 13:08.800
super fast rigs and networking, and a Linux culture that runs deep in that company. There's

13:08.800 --> 13:12.320
so many great reasons to choose Linode. After you've been using it for a minute, you'll

13:12.320 --> 13:16.360
come up with a list of your own. And if you're like me, you'll really appreciate that you

13:16.360 --> 13:20.800
can tell where the Linux love is baked into the product. So go put it over the top and

13:20.800 --> 13:24.880
get $100 in credit. Try it for yourself. See why I've been talking about it and support

13:24.880 --> 13:30.120
the show. What a great opportunity. So it's linode.com slash LAN. You go there, you get

13:30.120 --> 13:35.120
that $100, you create the new account, you build something, you learn something. Linode.com

13:35.120 --> 13:45.200
slash LAN. Linux.ting.com. And a big thank you to Ting for sponsoring this episode of

13:45.200 --> 13:51.840
Linux Action News. Ting has been my cell phone provider since 2013. So go to linux.ting.com

13:51.840 --> 13:58.060
and see how much you could save and then take $25 off by using our URL. Ting is an MVNO

13:58.060 --> 14:02.000
or a mobile virtual network operator. That means they don't focus on digging holes in

14:02.000 --> 14:06.820
the grounds and working with all the different local regulations. They work as a meta network

14:06.820 --> 14:12.440
on top of the big nationwide carriers. So they get access to the same LTE and 5G networks.

14:12.440 --> 14:16.440
But you deal with Ting who has to focus on customer support and value to survive. It's

14:16.440 --> 14:23.000
like their whole bread and butter is customer service. Right? Where the duopolies, they

14:23.000 --> 14:27.560
just they get you locked in and you know what that service is like. And Ting was recently

14:27.560 --> 14:34.240
named number one by Consumer Reports in 2021. And I think what I love about Ting is their

14:34.240 --> 14:37.980
plans are always simple and straightforward. They've changed them over the years a bit

14:37.980 --> 14:42.640
as the industry has evolved, but they've always remained simple and easy to understand. And

14:42.640 --> 14:49.040
one thing that's always stayed true. No contracts ever. It's simple to switch to Ting. And pretty

14:49.040 --> 14:54.060
much any phone will work. You'll be blown away by the prices. They have cell phone plans

14:54.060 --> 14:58.940
that are as cheap as 30 bucks a month, 15 bucks a month, depending on what you need.

14:58.940 --> 15:03.540
You know, maybe you don't use your phone a lot. Maybe you use it a ton. Maybe you need

15:03.540 --> 15:08.240
a data device. They also will sell you a device and you can take 25 bucks off that when you

15:08.240 --> 15:13.600
go to linux.ting.com. Go check your current phone, create an account and pick the plan

15:13.600 --> 15:21.400
that's right for you. It's linux.ting.com.

15:21.400 --> 15:27.880
The folks behind the modular laptop, the framework have now made the laptops mainboard available

15:27.880 --> 15:33.640
as a standalone component in the framework marketplace. They write in their announcement

15:33.640 --> 15:40.120
quote, we designed the mainboard from the start as a standalone module to make upgrades

15:40.120 --> 15:46.680
easy in the framework laptop. All you need to do is insert some memory, plug in a USB-C

15:46.680 --> 15:53.640
power adapter and hit the tiny power button on board and you've got a powered up computer.

15:53.640 --> 16:00.040
I love this idea and it's so great that they designed this mainboard from the beginning

16:00.040 --> 16:05.520
to be standalone like this. What a cool idea. And not only just that Wes, but they've also

16:05.520 --> 16:10.760
released a GitHub repository with 80 different CAD drawings. They've got electrical documentation

16:10.760 --> 16:15.200
on there for the mainboard and they're putting it all under a creative commons license. And

16:15.200 --> 16:19.720
in addition to that, they've got some 2D drawings of the mainboard so that you can get the exact

16:19.720 --> 16:26.120
dimensions and they've released two 3D printable reference designs with the hope that the community

16:26.120 --> 16:31.900
starts creating cases and accessories to house the mainboard. You could actually see like

16:31.900 --> 16:38.880
a Raspberry Pi style case for a framework laptop mainboard, giving those of us who self-host

16:38.880 --> 16:45.140
or maybe you just need a small headless machine, a low cost, low power, easy to repair, easy

16:45.140 --> 16:50.020
to upgrade headless x86 system.

16:50.020 --> 16:57.400
Maybe I can finally get you off that Pi habit. Maybe. But speaking of pricing, there are

16:57.400 --> 17:04.340
three main options and price points here. It starts at $399 that's in USD and that gets

17:04.340 --> 17:15.560
you a i5 11th Gen Intel, $549 for the base i7 mainboard and $799 for the i7-1185G7 board

17:15.560 --> 17:20.440
if you want to get fancy. Then of course, add whatever memory and storage your use case

17:20.440 --> 17:21.440
requires.

17:21.440 --> 17:27.660
Yeah, and those are introductory prices too. So these prices will likely go up at some

17:27.660 --> 17:33.400
point in the near future. And that is sort of the killer for the casual play around with

17:33.400 --> 17:38.440
a little computer and learn Linux user. But it still doesn't necessarily put it out of

17:38.440 --> 17:40.720
the price range of an enthusiast necessarily.

17:40.720 --> 17:45.360
Yeah, and you know, that's obviously one use case here folks who like assembling hardware

17:45.360 --> 17:49.480
who like building their own systems and now have a new modular sort of base that they

17:49.480 --> 17:54.020
can build from. I get that. It also makes me wonder though, you know, with this being

17:54.020 --> 17:59.120
so out in the open, is some of this research, some of this, you know, the hard work that

17:59.120 --> 18:03.880
the framework team have done here, could any of it be used by other vendors looking to

18:03.880 --> 18:06.960
maybe build off or build similar products?

18:06.960 --> 18:12.080
Hmm, right. Like this is almost like a base platform. And you could take this main board

18:12.080 --> 18:15.720
and you could put it in a whole different chassis or something like that. And maybe

18:15.720 --> 18:19.720
you could see other vendors create products around this. I wonder, you know, you could

18:19.720 --> 18:25.960
see it. I think clearly the major use case, which we haven't even really mentioned yet,

18:25.960 --> 18:31.320
but is the obvious primary use case for this and these, all these standalone main boards

18:31.320 --> 18:36.480
is for framework laptop owners that either need to do a replacement or maybe, maybe they

18:36.480 --> 18:41.840
bought like a low end i5 model a year ago. And maybe in a year or two, they want to pop

18:41.840 --> 18:47.400
in a high end i7 model and essentially get an entirely new PC.

18:47.400 --> 18:54.000
It's a whole new era of laptops, or at least maybe if things like this continue to go well,

18:54.000 --> 19:01.280
we'll see. For now, the framework folks are also giving away 100 of the i5 main boards.

19:01.280 --> 19:05.520
But you do need to live in an area that they currently shipped to. And you have to apply

19:05.520 --> 19:10.160
via a special form. But don't worry, we'll have that linked in the notes.

19:10.160 --> 19:16.000
Indeed, that's pretty cool. The notes are always at linuxactionshow.com slash episode

19:16.000 --> 19:23.300
number. So for this episode, it is linuxactionnews.com slash 238. But we'll keep an eye on all these

19:23.300 --> 19:29.080
stories and so be sure you go to linuxactionnews.com slash subscribe. So that way you can get updates

19:29.080 --> 19:33.520
on everything we talked about and new stories as they develop.

19:33.520 --> 19:38.360
And linuxactionnews.com slash contact for ways to get in touch, at least if you didn't

19:38.360 --> 19:41.240
take our hint and join us on matrix.

19:41.240 --> 19:48.400
And just a heads up, Linux action news will be out one day late next week. Brace yourself.

19:48.400 --> 19:52.280
Don't worry, we will be back next week, though just just a little bit late. But still with

19:52.280 --> 19:56.560
our take on the latest Linux and open source news.

19:56.560 --> 20:22.640
Thanks for joining us. And that's all the news for this week.
