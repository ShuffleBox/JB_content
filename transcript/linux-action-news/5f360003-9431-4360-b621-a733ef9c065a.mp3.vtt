00:00.000 --> 00:09.560
Hello and welcome to Linux Action News, episode 211, recorded on December 26, 2021.

00:09.560 --> 00:10.560
I'm Chris.

00:10.560 --> 00:11.560
And I'm Wes.

00:11.560 --> 00:12.840
Hello, Wes.

00:12.840 --> 00:15.640
And this week, we're not doing the news.

00:15.640 --> 00:16.640
Not this week.

00:16.640 --> 00:20.720
No, we're going to start with an update about the show itself.

00:20.720 --> 00:26.840
Starting next week, January 2nd, Linux Unplugged will be moving into LAN's current Sunday

00:26.840 --> 00:28.320
time slot.

00:28.320 --> 00:33.760
That means Linux Action News will be moving to a little later in the week to hopefully

00:33.760 --> 00:35.600
better capture the news cycle.

00:35.600 --> 00:39.720
Right, that and really kind of balance out the entire Jupiter broadcasting release schedule

00:39.720 --> 00:40.720
as well.

00:40.720 --> 00:45.240
So, starting in the new year, all going to plan, of course, the next episode of Linux

00:45.240 --> 00:49.560
Action News will be out January 6th, and then every Thursday after that.

00:49.560 --> 00:54.000
We'll monitor this adjustment and watch for your feedback at linuxactionnews.com contact.

00:54.000 --> 00:58.320
But the underlying goal here is to better position both LUP and LAN to sort of play

00:58.320 --> 01:00.240
to their relative strengths.

01:00.240 --> 01:03.960
And don't worry, I know a lot of you out there are Monday LAN commuters.

01:03.960 --> 01:05.520
Linux Unplugged will be in that time slot.

01:05.520 --> 01:06.520
It'll be there for you.

01:06.520 --> 01:10.040
And it'll be better than ever at linuxunplugged.com slash subscribe.

01:10.040 --> 01:13.920
We're just kind of moving things around on the board a little bit for the new year.

01:13.920 --> 01:18.720
But with that business of show out of the way, let's get to the predicting.

01:18.720 --> 01:26.240
Well, first, we've got to own up for last year, and I guess I'll start.

01:26.240 --> 01:32.680
I thought that by this time, Mozilla would probably have just killed Pocket.

01:32.680 --> 01:37.340
But no, seems like Pocket is still alive and kicking.

01:37.340 --> 01:40.840
I liked this prediction, not because I wanted to see Pocket die, but because I thought it

01:40.840 --> 01:44.160
was both possible and a bit bold.

01:44.160 --> 01:48.040
Because you know, this time last year, we weren't really sure what was going to happen

01:48.040 --> 01:49.040
with Mozilla.

01:49.040 --> 01:50.980
It seemed like this was going to be a make or break it year.

01:50.980 --> 01:56.400
But overall, 2021 worked out to be a better year for Mozilla than I think either one of

01:56.400 --> 01:57.400
us expected.

01:57.400 --> 02:00.680
And I don't think they got to a position where they needed to make cutbacks like this.

02:00.680 --> 02:03.900
Because I listened back to the episode, Wes, and it sounded like that was your angle on

02:03.900 --> 02:08.320
this was, well, they're gonna have to make cuts because things are trending badly.

02:08.320 --> 02:09.560
And this is where they're gonna cut.

02:09.560 --> 02:14.920
Yeah, I think I've just been questioning how invested have they actually been in Pocket?

02:14.920 --> 02:19.200
Now I'll admit, I do give it some clicks when I'm using Firefox, I do have some articles

02:19.200 --> 02:21.400
that I think are interesting.

02:21.400 --> 02:26.440
But it's just a small piece of the evolving story of how does Mozilla get money, right?

02:26.440 --> 02:31.440
Like I mean, they're still at least in 2020, really dependent on their search revenue from

02:31.440 --> 02:35.200
Google, something like 86% of their revenue came from that source.

02:35.200 --> 02:39.440
So well, their services are growing, still seems like an open question.

02:39.440 --> 02:41.520
Yeah, I agree there.

02:41.520 --> 02:45.320
Their VPN service has seen some good growth there.

02:45.320 --> 02:49.920
There's some good trends, better trends at the end at this point than when we did this

02:49.920 --> 02:50.920
show last year.

02:50.920 --> 02:55.800
All right, I'll own up to one of mine, which I think I got right.

02:55.800 --> 02:58.920
But I'm going to preface this, listening to this right now, it's going to seem like this

02:58.920 --> 03:00.280
was an obvious one.

03:00.280 --> 03:03.560
But when I made this prediction, Alma Linux hadn't been announced yet.

03:03.560 --> 03:07.180
We had just really learned about the end of the traditional CentOS release.

03:07.180 --> 03:12.640
So I predicted that at least three CentOS clones would ship essentially a 1.0 or their

03:12.640 --> 03:15.680
first stable release in 2021.

03:15.680 --> 03:21.040
And that's exactly what happened Alma Linux, Rocky Linux, Springdale Linux, and a few other

03:21.040 --> 03:24.560
clones did end up shipping.

03:24.560 --> 03:28.480
Not I guess a huge surprise, although for a little bit there, some of us thought maybe

03:28.480 --> 03:30.600
Rocky wasn't going to actually make it.

03:30.600 --> 03:38.280
All right, I have a couple of thoughts here, but let's start with, what is Springdale again?

03:38.280 --> 03:42.560
Because I don't think we've cited that previously on Linux Action News.

03:42.560 --> 03:46.320
No, I had to go look because I knew Alma and Rocky had done it, right?

03:46.320 --> 03:47.640
And I was like, well, okay, who else?

03:47.640 --> 03:50.660
Because I don't think Scientific Linux is presently shipping.

03:50.660 --> 03:52.080
So I had to go find another one.

03:52.080 --> 03:56.000
And it's a thing and they've shipped an ISO.

03:56.000 --> 03:57.880
So I guess it counts, I think.

03:57.880 --> 03:59.680
Yeah, yeah, I guess so.

03:59.680 --> 04:04.400
I mean, it does make me think one uncertainty we had was we didn't really know where they're

04:04.400 --> 04:09.000
going to be one, where they're going to be two, three, or a whole bunch of clones.

04:09.000 --> 04:12.840
Because I mean, once you've got some in the space that prove it out, you can just keep

04:12.840 --> 04:13.840
copying.

04:13.840 --> 04:14.840
It's open source after all.

04:14.840 --> 04:19.720
Yeah, I almost am surprised we didn't end up with like 10 or 15.

04:19.720 --> 04:22.560
You know, and of course, like nine of them are horrible.

04:22.560 --> 04:28.920
But it does seem like it's just maybe a harder task than, oh, I just copy the source RPMs

04:28.920 --> 04:29.920
and rebuild it.

04:29.920 --> 04:32.120
I think it turned out to be a harder job than that.

04:32.120 --> 04:34.740
So but we did get at least a handful of them out there.

04:34.740 --> 04:37.160
And then I think the other thing that we didn't really know, but we have a much clearer picture

04:37.160 --> 04:42.140
of now is there's a lot of folks that just seem to be happy with stream itself and are

04:42.140 --> 04:44.040
just sticking with CentOS and streaming.

04:44.040 --> 04:47.960
And then something we learned on Linux Unplugged last week, pretty sizable people said, screw

04:47.960 --> 04:49.440
it, I'm going to Ubuntu.

04:49.440 --> 04:53.200
And none of us predicted that because, you know, it just seemed like too much of a pain

04:53.200 --> 04:54.200
in the butt.

04:54.200 --> 04:57.680
Yeah, that definitely caught me by surprise as well.

04:57.680 --> 05:02.320
But speaking of Ubuntu, it's my turn again.

05:02.320 --> 05:11.080
I predicted, hoped even perhaps that Ubuntu would ship SystemD HomeD sometime in 2021.

05:11.080 --> 05:14.040
And I'm sad to say that didn't happen.

05:14.040 --> 05:18.760
Did anybody, did any of the major desktop distros, I should say, ship SystemD HomeD

05:18.760 --> 05:19.760
by default?

05:19.760 --> 05:20.760
I don't think they did.

05:20.760 --> 05:23.160
And in that episode, we were like, well Fedora will probably do it.

05:23.160 --> 05:28.320
I don't even think, I mean, the version of SystemD that has it may have shipped.

05:28.320 --> 05:32.780
But you specifically put yourself into a corner when you said, not only will the bits ship,

05:32.780 --> 05:35.280
but it will be configured and enabled by default.

05:35.280 --> 05:37.120
And you said Fedora is too certain.

05:37.120 --> 05:41.360
So I'm going to go for a risky pick and choose Ubuntu because you had like this, this really

05:41.360 --> 05:45.360
nice optimistic dream that they were going to be pushing the desktop technology stack

05:45.360 --> 05:49.880
forward very aggressively in 2021, which just didn't really pan out.

05:49.880 --> 05:50.880
No.

05:50.880 --> 05:51.880
Wow.

05:51.880 --> 05:52.880
Yeah.

05:52.880 --> 05:53.880
So naive.

05:53.880 --> 05:59.760
I think kind of the story we've been talking about sadly is some desktop disappointment

05:59.760 --> 06:01.800
with Ubuntu, with Canonical's efforts there.

06:01.800 --> 06:06.080
I mean, a lot still happening on the server side, but it just has not been the space to

06:06.080 --> 06:09.360
watch for exciting changes or innovation on the desktop.

06:09.360 --> 06:13.640
You never know though, Wes, there is an LTS coming up, things could change.

06:13.640 --> 06:15.920
My next one was pretty bad.

06:15.920 --> 06:19.720
You know, this was one of those where I thought maybe I was onto something because I was reading

06:19.720 --> 06:22.980
tea leaves, which in other words is mailing list posts.

06:22.980 --> 06:24.280
You don't even drink tea.

06:24.280 --> 06:25.280
I know.

06:25.280 --> 06:31.720
You know, it hurts the tummy, but I thought BcashFS would make it into the Linux kernel

06:31.720 --> 06:32.720
in 2021.

06:32.720 --> 06:37.960
I didn't necessarily think any distributions would use it or do anything with it.

06:37.960 --> 06:42.720
But I thought, you know, by the end of the year, a shipping stable version of the Linux

06:42.720 --> 06:46.040
kernel would have BcashFS mainlined.

06:46.040 --> 06:50.160
And the things that I was reading in the mailing list were that they had hired a dedicated

06:50.160 --> 06:51.800
tester.

06:51.800 --> 06:54.240
There was a bunch of things they'd already identified.

06:54.240 --> 06:59.240
It looked like they were on track to have some major stuff dialed in by summer.

06:59.240 --> 07:02.720
And that, you know, if they got those bugs fixed by summer, then I had expected by, you

07:02.720 --> 07:05.000
know, winter to be mainlined.

07:05.000 --> 07:06.960
And it just didn't, it just didn't happen.

07:06.960 --> 07:10.120
And you know, it's funny because here we are now at the end of 2021.

07:10.120 --> 07:14.760
And I'm seeing some of that same stuff that makes me think maybe 2022.

07:14.760 --> 07:18.400
You know, cause I could almost make that prediction and say it's going to happen in 2022.

07:18.400 --> 07:22.000
But I am not, I may save it for Linux Unplugged.

07:22.000 --> 07:25.040
And I will own up to the fact that it did not ship in 2021.

07:25.040 --> 07:29.080
I got that one wrong, unfortunately, despite how much I would have loved to see that.

07:29.080 --> 07:30.080
I would have loved it.

07:30.080 --> 07:32.080
It just would have been so great.

07:32.080 --> 07:33.080
Yeah.

07:33.080 --> 07:37.200
And you know, that definitely shouldn't take away from Kent Overstreet's hard work continuing

07:37.200 --> 07:38.200
the development.

07:38.200 --> 07:40.640
I mean, on one, on one hand, I'm a little disappointed.

07:40.640 --> 07:44.640
I think we're all excited to see what BcashFS might offer.

07:44.640 --> 07:49.200
But on the other side of that coin, this is a final system after all, and it's better

07:49.200 --> 07:52.680
to get it right than fast.

07:52.680 --> 07:54.520
Linode dot com slash LAN.

07:54.520 --> 07:55.520
Linode loves Linux.

07:55.520 --> 07:59.280
And I love Linux too, so I can tell, you know, you can't fake that kind of thing.

07:59.280 --> 08:01.120
And it's how we run everything now.

08:01.120 --> 08:04.000
Like we've built everything out on Linode for the last couple of years.

08:04.000 --> 08:07.880
You should really try it out because I'm sitting here telling you it's great.

08:07.880 --> 08:12.920
And that's after years of now actually using it in production, running my business infrastructure

08:12.920 --> 08:17.080
and running my personal stuff, you know, the kind of stuff you never want to go down because

08:17.080 --> 08:20.960
you don't want you don't want things to be down for for your customers or, in my case,

08:20.960 --> 08:21.960
your audience.

08:21.960 --> 08:25.020
And you don't want things to be down when you're just sitting down for a few minutes

08:25.020 --> 08:30.640
with the kiddos to play a little game, you know, like maybe you maybe got like 15, 20

08:30.640 --> 08:31.640
minutes to play a game.

08:31.640 --> 08:32.640
Right.

08:32.640 --> 08:35.280
You don't want to deal with crappy performance or outages.

08:35.280 --> 08:36.880
That's just not the time for that kind of thing.

08:36.880 --> 08:39.000
And I've never had that problem with Linode.

08:39.000 --> 08:42.040
And you know, there's been opportunities for them to be tested, like this recent log for

08:42.040 --> 08:45.500
Jay vulnerability, Linode really stepped up to the plate on that.

08:45.500 --> 08:49.240
If you're curious about what I'm talking about, go check their blog, go check their Twitter

08:49.240 --> 08:50.240
feed.

08:50.240 --> 08:53.900
I mean, they were just following this stuff from day one, making sure everybody is solid

08:53.900 --> 08:54.960
and taken care of.

08:54.960 --> 08:59.020
And they just have the best support in the business phone ticket, email, whatever your

08:59.020 --> 09:01.560
method is, they're there every day of the year.

09:01.560 --> 09:05.720
They don't do that escalation thing where they try to like pawn you off on some some

09:05.720 --> 09:07.680
like, you know, first layer tech thing.

09:07.680 --> 09:09.520
No, they take care of you.

09:09.520 --> 09:10.560
They handle it right there.

09:10.560 --> 09:11.800
There's no there's none of that.

09:11.800 --> 09:13.480
It's really nice to know that's there.

09:13.480 --> 09:17.500
But here's the best part when you go to Linode.com slash land, you get $100 to work with.

09:17.500 --> 09:21.100
That's Linode saying they have confidence that if you actually put this thing into production,

09:21.100 --> 09:22.100
they know you're going to like it.

09:22.100 --> 09:25.740
All right, cuz I mean, they could give you like 10 bucks, 15 bucks, then you could run

09:25.740 --> 09:28.240
some of their rigs for like two, three months, right?

09:28.240 --> 09:32.220
Because they got great prices, they're 30 to 50% less than the major hyperscalers out

09:32.220 --> 09:33.220
there.

09:33.220 --> 09:38.560
But with $100, you could build real infrastructure, or you could really learn an entirely new

09:38.560 --> 09:39.560
system.

09:39.560 --> 09:44.060
Instead of even wanting to build an environment from scratch using Ansible or Terraform.

09:44.060 --> 09:45.540
This is your opportunity.

09:45.540 --> 09:47.220
Go do it and support the show.

09:47.220 --> 09:53.660
Have some fun, learn something and support the show Linode.com slash land.

09:53.660 --> 09:58.480
And a big thank you to Ting Linux.ting.com stop overpaying for cell service.

09:58.480 --> 10:02.000
Why not do it right now at the beginning of a new year just start saving from the very

10:02.000 --> 10:07.080
beginning Linux.ting.com go there and take 25 bucks off whatever you end up going with

10:07.080 --> 10:08.960
a new device or a new plan.

10:08.960 --> 10:12.120
You see Ting is an MVNO, a mobile virtual network operator.

10:12.120 --> 10:13.420
That means a couple of things.

10:13.420 --> 10:17.280
That means they have several nationwide networks for you to choose from.

10:17.280 --> 10:22.040
That also means that your device is likely already compatible because of that multi network

10:22.040 --> 10:23.600
compatibility.

10:23.600 --> 10:26.840
And then on top of it, it means that they're not digging holes.

10:26.840 --> 10:28.680
They're not fighting with local authorities.

10:28.680 --> 10:33.960
They're not trying to get new laws passed and lobbying the state to get new towers installed.

10:33.960 --> 10:35.720
They don't have to manage any of that.

10:35.720 --> 10:40.480
So their business focuses on the customer and creating value and they've nailed it.

10:40.480 --> 10:43.000
That's why I've been a customer since 2013.

10:43.000 --> 10:44.760
It's just a smarter way to do mobile.

10:44.760 --> 10:48.240
It's probably how the industry would have to operate today if they were to like reset

10:48.240 --> 10:49.780
everything from the ground up.

10:49.780 --> 10:52.840
They have plans that start around ten dollars a month and they kind of go up from there

10:52.840 --> 10:54.280
depending on what you need.

10:54.280 --> 10:59.040
A lot of their stuff is just like so simple that you just go to the website and it's just

10:59.040 --> 11:01.160
one of them is going to be obvious which one should work for you.

11:01.160 --> 11:05.560
You know, they got plans with unlimited data, unlimited calls and every single plan has

11:05.560 --> 11:08.640
the nationwide LTE and 5G coverage.

11:08.640 --> 11:09.640
How great is that?

11:09.640 --> 11:12.080
And maybe one of my favorite things is no contracts.

11:12.080 --> 11:13.280
They stay flexible.

11:13.280 --> 11:15.000
Over the years, I've dialed back my usage.

11:15.000 --> 11:16.000
I've increased my usage.

11:16.000 --> 11:17.200
I've gone on road trips.

11:17.200 --> 11:21.240
I've been all over the place and Ting has remained flexible and awesome and a great

11:21.240 --> 11:22.240
value.

11:22.240 --> 11:23.240
So here's how you get started.

11:23.240 --> 11:24.240
You go to Linux.ting.com.

11:24.240 --> 11:26.880
You check your current phone, you create an account, you pick the plan that's right for

11:26.880 --> 11:27.880
you.

11:27.880 --> 11:28.880
Ting is going to send you a SIM card.

11:28.880 --> 11:31.960
You're going to pop that SIM card into your phone and then you're going to get activated

11:31.960 --> 11:34.080
in minutes because they have a really nice clean dashboard.

11:34.080 --> 11:35.080
Boop, boop, boop.

11:35.080 --> 11:36.080
You're ready to go.

11:36.080 --> 11:37.880
You didn't have to talk to a human if you didn't want to.

11:37.880 --> 11:40.160
If you do want to, they got great customer support.

11:40.160 --> 11:42.160
Cutting your phone bill in half has never been easier.

11:42.160 --> 11:43.220
Ting has great plans.

11:43.220 --> 11:44.600
You got to go check them out.

11:44.600 --> 11:48.560
Kick off a new year and save a little bit of money and take 25 bucks off whatever you

11:48.560 --> 11:53.200
find at Linux.ting.com.

11:53.200 --> 11:57.640
And now it's time for our 2022 predictions.

11:57.640 --> 11:59.280
I'll start things off.

11:59.280 --> 12:07.240
I think that sometime in 2022, SUSE will release a RHEL clone of their very own.

12:07.240 --> 12:13.480
Now, this is something we've speculated a bit before, specifically in LAN 2.10, but

12:13.480 --> 12:19.200
they already offer RHEL support and there were some clues from Apple and our friend

12:19.200 --> 12:23.360
Carl George that maybe there's something more in the works.

12:23.360 --> 12:27.200
I could see it happening and 2022 seems like the year that it might.

12:27.200 --> 12:31.840
Yeah, I thought if it was going to happen, they would have tried to have shipped before

12:31.840 --> 12:33.760
end of life for CentOS.

12:33.760 --> 12:37.920
I suppose there's still a few more hours on that clock as we record right now.

12:37.920 --> 12:42.360
I say you're still going to get it if they release it in 2021 because this is either

12:42.360 --> 12:45.360
going to ship or they're going to just shut down the whole thing.

12:45.360 --> 12:48.760
The rumor mill has it that once we started talking about it on the show and it started

12:48.760 --> 12:55.080
showing up on Twitter, the word went out internally to shut off all like Apple repositories.

12:55.080 --> 12:57.920
So we no longer have any external numbers to go on.

12:57.920 --> 13:03.360
But what we did see for a short period was what seemed to be a SUSE designed and built

13:03.360 --> 13:08.520
RHEL clone that was connecting to external repositories and checking in for updates.

13:08.520 --> 13:10.400
Quote, Liberty Linux.

13:10.400 --> 13:11.400
Right.

13:11.400 --> 13:14.800
Liberty Linux was the tagline and there was multiple connections.

13:14.800 --> 13:17.840
It wasn't just one or two or three, it was many.

13:17.840 --> 13:25.600
And this could be kind of like a kind of really calculated move by SUSE to make it easy to

13:25.600 --> 13:28.900
migrate from RHEL to a SUSE infrastructure.

13:28.900 --> 13:33.080
They did something similar like this back in the NetWare days, where they made it really

13:33.080 --> 13:38.680
easy to transition from NetWare to SUSE in part by emulating NetWare.

13:38.680 --> 13:40.660
And it was a strategy that worked for them.

13:40.660 --> 13:42.880
So I think it's a solid bet, Wes.

13:42.880 --> 13:46.740
Yeah, you know, I mean, they've already got robust build tools out there.

13:46.740 --> 13:48.680
So I don't think that's going to be too much of an issue.

13:48.680 --> 13:54.280
They're familiar with the RPM ecosystem, and they already provide commercial enterprise

13:54.280 --> 13:55.280
support.

13:55.280 --> 13:57.360
I mean, if anyone's going to try this, seems like it might be them.

13:57.360 --> 13:58.360
Right.

13:58.360 --> 14:02.500
That's the other aspect of this that we forget is they do have like a cheaper than RHEL patch

14:02.500 --> 14:07.040
service that you can get that will patch SUSE boxes and RHEL boxes today.

14:07.040 --> 14:10.800
So you can actually purchase a SUSE tool to patch your RHEL boxes.

14:10.800 --> 14:14.840
So they're already probably maintaining, I would imagine, their own RPM repositories.

14:14.840 --> 14:18.840
They're already taking the source RPMs and building them, possibly.

14:18.840 --> 14:22.160
So it could just be they're increasing that infrastructure and growing that out.

14:22.160 --> 14:26.240
I hope we see it because I think it's going to shock people to see SUSE shipping a RHEL

14:26.240 --> 14:27.240
clone.

14:27.240 --> 14:29.480
And I think it's going to make for a fun story if it ever happens.

14:29.480 --> 14:33.220
And if it doesn't happen, if we're sitting here this time next year and it hasn't shipped,

14:33.220 --> 14:34.780
it's going to be like, what the hell happened?

14:34.780 --> 14:36.400
Because we saw it showing up on the numbers.

14:36.400 --> 14:39.080
Something was out there called Liberty Linux coming from SUSE IPs.

14:39.080 --> 14:40.080
All right.

14:40.080 --> 14:43.280
Now, mine, I feel like my next one is a pretty sure bet.

14:43.280 --> 14:48.000
I think both of us just want at least one win is what I feel like these first ones are.

14:48.000 --> 14:49.040
And that's mine.

14:49.040 --> 14:51.320
This one, everybody's going to roll their eyes when I say it.

14:51.320 --> 14:53.840
But, you know, might as well try to get an easy win.

14:53.840 --> 14:59.040
Asahi is going to ship, Asahi Linux is going to ship an installer for getting their version

14:59.040 --> 15:04.080
of Linux or like, you know, an installer that gets another version like Arch or Debian or

15:04.080 --> 15:06.280
something like that on M1 hardware.

15:06.280 --> 15:10.960
I imagine it won't be an entire standalone distro, but more of a tool to get an existing

15:10.960 --> 15:12.520
distro on an M1 Mac.

15:12.520 --> 15:15.480
But it could be its own distro too.

15:15.480 --> 15:16.480
It's pretty broad.

15:16.480 --> 15:20.760
But that's something that's like targeted at end users and not just potential developers

15:20.760 --> 15:23.260
or people trying to contribute to the bootstrapping effort.

15:23.260 --> 15:27.860
Something like you might use to run a real desktop day to day on an M1 machine.

15:27.860 --> 15:32.080
It seems like you could you could see a scenario where a developer edition, which is already

15:32.080 --> 15:33.080
kind of out there.

15:33.080 --> 15:35.360
There are there's already docs on how to do it by hand.

15:35.360 --> 15:39.960
And you could see maybe a little rougher version of an installer coming to market first.

15:39.960 --> 15:42.400
That is really for like your first wave adopters.

15:42.400 --> 15:46.920
And then by the end of the year, there's something that's really even before the end of the year,

15:46.920 --> 15:50.920
you know, midway, there's something targeted for average users who average Linux users

15:50.920 --> 15:54.840
who just, you know, maybe picked up an M1 and they want to try getting Linux on it.

15:54.840 --> 15:56.600
Now that's maybe a year old or so.

15:56.600 --> 16:01.440
I think that's going to become as you think about it in terms of M1 hardware age right

16:01.440 --> 16:02.440
now.

16:02.440 --> 16:05.880
You know, when even when the project, especially when the project first started, some of these

16:05.880 --> 16:12.960
people they just got themselves a 12 to $2,000, $1,300, whatever it is, MacBook, it's precious.

16:12.960 --> 16:15.560
You don't want to try slamming Linux on that thing right now.

16:15.560 --> 16:18.520
But you know, a year, year and a half into it.

16:18.520 --> 16:20.440
It's just you know, your old laptop at that point.

16:20.440 --> 16:23.760
So yeah, once you take it for granted, you've already messed it up a couple of times and

16:23.760 --> 16:24.960
had to reinstall.

16:24.960 --> 16:27.920
What a great time for a new Linux installer to come out and for people to start slamming

16:27.920 --> 16:29.020
Linux on them.

16:29.020 --> 16:31.840
And I think that could also play well for a crowdfunded project.

16:31.840 --> 16:37.280
So that's my prediction is that in 2021, you're going to see Asahi ship an installer for average

16:37.280 --> 16:38.280
Linux users.

16:38.280 --> 16:41.400
People are familiar with Linux and want to get it on an M1 machine.

16:41.400 --> 16:45.200
I know it's kind of a it's probably a sure bet, but that also just speaks to the confidence

16:45.200 --> 16:46.200
I have in the project.

16:46.200 --> 16:51.800
Okay, well, my question then is, if that happens, is that what it takes for you to start trying

16:51.800 --> 16:53.720
Asahi on your M1, Chris?

16:53.720 --> 16:54.840
Oh, I think so.

16:54.840 --> 17:00.240
You know, because I didn't even touch on like GPU accelerated graphics, because for me personally,

17:00.240 --> 17:01.280
I don't even need it.

17:01.280 --> 17:06.000
I would love to be able to run a headless M1 server in my RV off solar because, you

17:06.000 --> 17:09.440
know, even under load, it's taken hardly any power compared to most systems.

17:09.440 --> 17:11.720
I think it just make a great little headless server.

17:11.720 --> 17:15.680
So yeah, I'm all about it as soon as they as soon as they're shipping, I'm installing.

17:15.680 --> 17:22.560
Well speaking of neat things in small packages, my next prediction is that SteamOS will have

17:22.560 --> 17:27.200
a community fork out there sometime in 2022.

17:27.200 --> 17:31.520
You know, with the deck launching with people getting really excited, I could see the community

17:31.520 --> 17:36.960
wanting to leverage some of Valve's hard work sort of stabilizing Arch and then shipping

17:36.960 --> 17:41.520
something that kind of bridges the gap and makes it a little more useful for you know,

17:41.520 --> 17:45.640
non strictly gaming uses something that makes the AUR easy to set up something just sort

17:45.640 --> 17:49.400
of smooth the gap between regular Arch.

17:49.400 --> 17:54.000
Something that says, Hey, you out there, you want a workstation that's gaming ready and

17:54.000 --> 17:57.480
has a OS tree style file system?

17:57.480 --> 17:59.640
Well, we've got a distro for you.

17:59.640 --> 18:04.160
Something that strips away some of the branding, you know, sort of all that red hat to send

18:04.160 --> 18:08.640
us where they make sure they don't have any custom logos or trademark stuff in there.

18:08.640 --> 18:12.760
And then they, you know, they sell it as vapor Linux or I guess maybe not vapor that's already

18:12.760 --> 18:13.760
out there.

18:13.760 --> 18:18.000
You know, I don't know what what you call but something that's probably a play on valve

18:18.000 --> 18:19.000
or steam, right?

18:19.000 --> 18:21.640
And then you go download that thing coal powered Linux.

18:21.640 --> 18:30.040
I'm not sure gasoline Linux, I don't know.

18:30.040 --> 18:33.120
But you know, and maybe it's gotten maybe it's got like a script that installs steam.

18:33.120 --> 18:34.120
I don't know how it works.

18:34.120 --> 18:35.600
But I could totally see that happening.

18:35.600 --> 18:36.600
I hope it does.

18:36.600 --> 18:39.360
Actually, I'm gonna be really disappointed if this prediction doesn't come true, because

18:39.360 --> 18:40.880
I want I want to try it.

18:40.880 --> 18:42.680
Well, yeah, that's just it.

18:42.680 --> 18:46.920
You know, I don't I don't know that I really I tried running the last steam OS kind of

18:46.920 --> 18:50.440
as a day to day way back in the day, I could see playing with it briefly.

18:50.440 --> 18:53.760
But you know, if there's not something that's really meant for that, I think I'll just

18:53.760 --> 18:55.800
keep it for the gaming use cases.

18:55.800 --> 18:58.760
But I am looking for another arch replacement.

18:58.760 --> 18:59.760
I mean, who's not?

18:59.760 --> 19:02.200
Well, I suppose step one will be just getting the deck to ship.

19:02.200 --> 19:05.480
And then step two is going to be valve needs to release steam OS.

19:05.480 --> 19:08.200
And hopefully they'll be good about it and release all the bits.

19:08.200 --> 19:12.200
Oh, geez, now that you say that that's a lot that needs to happen.

19:12.200 --> 19:13.800
But fingers crossed.

19:13.800 --> 19:15.300
There's some milestones, though.

19:15.300 --> 19:17.600
You know, we can watch those milestones, we'll find out.

19:17.600 --> 19:20.420
Okay, here is my next prediction.

19:20.420 --> 19:24.840
It's a bit of a long shot, but boy, do I really hope this is going to happen.

19:24.840 --> 19:28.440
So I'm looking at the Raspberry Pi lineup, and I'm liking what I'm seeing with the compute

19:28.440 --> 19:30.240
module a lot this year.

19:30.240 --> 19:34.520
I think that's made the Raspberry Pi a totally new kind of interesting for me.

19:34.520 --> 19:37.880
My Pi 400 is one of my best little pieces of hardware I've ever bought.

19:37.880 --> 19:41.840
I keep it set up in my office ready to go for like basic business stuff, you know, for

19:41.840 --> 19:43.480
when I have to be a businessman.

19:43.480 --> 19:45.160
And I think that's really nice.

19:45.160 --> 19:48.240
So I thought maybe I'd try to make a prediction in this realm.

19:48.240 --> 19:51.720
And I was looking at the Raspberry Pi 4, which has been really solid for me, I've been using

19:51.720 --> 19:53.080
it as a server.

19:53.080 --> 19:59.960
And you know, they launched the Pi 4 Model B in June of 2019 towards the end of June

19:59.960 --> 20:00.960
2019.

20:00.960 --> 20:03.220
And they have a lot going on.

20:03.220 --> 20:05.480
And there is a worldwide part shortage.

20:05.480 --> 20:11.160
So this is, it's hard to say, but I feel like enough hedging already out with it.

20:11.160 --> 20:18.840
I think maybe we're gonna see a Raspberry Pi 5 at least announced in 2022.

20:18.840 --> 20:21.920
I don't know if it's gonna be able to ship though, because the supply chain woes.

20:21.920 --> 20:28.280
In fact, what we could end up seeing is a Pi 4a, you know, because you've got something

20:28.280 --> 20:33.360
that they've remarked on is that their engineering team hasn't had a very good collaborative

20:33.360 --> 20:34.360
year with work from home.

20:34.360 --> 20:36.160
It's been tough on their team.

20:36.160 --> 20:41.040
They've had supply chain issues, parts costs are going up, the devices they're making right

20:41.040 --> 20:43.160
now, they're making them as fast as they can.

20:43.160 --> 20:46.240
So what we may end up only getting is a Pi 4a.

20:46.240 --> 20:48.440
But my long shot would be a Raspberry Pi 5.

20:48.440 --> 20:53.560
That would be, you know, and then if I could go all the way, Wes, Raspberry Pi 5, with

20:53.560 --> 20:58.280
a 16 gig of RAM option, and eMMC, but that's just not gonna happen.

20:58.280 --> 21:00.320
Well, okay, what comes in the 4a then?

21:00.320 --> 21:06.560
The 4a, I think, is a yeah, it's a CPU bump, you know, eight gigs of RAM still, I don't

21:06.560 --> 21:12.320
think the 4a is a big change, other than some maybe like board or, you know, PCI layout

21:12.320 --> 21:16.240
changes, maybe something in that regard, something that makes me look at and go, hmm, you know,

21:16.240 --> 21:19.960
I could use it for, you know, something new or something extra.

21:19.960 --> 21:23.640
It's tough to say because the compute module actually brings so much to the table that

21:23.640 --> 21:26.920
I'm not, I'm not totally sure, but I could always use more memory and I could always

21:26.920 --> 21:27.920
use more CPU.

21:27.920 --> 21:32.600
Well, I'm just curious to see, you know, I think with the 4, it got really close to sort

21:32.600 --> 21:37.720
of using a Pi in the Chromebook territory of performance and like, you know, low end

21:37.720 --> 21:42.280
Linux desktop, so maybe a 4a, but I think certainly a 5 could really take that to the

21:42.280 --> 21:43.280
next level.

21:43.280 --> 21:44.280
How do I make this?

21:44.280 --> 21:45.280
How do I square this?

21:45.280 --> 21:46.280
Because it's like, it's really two predictions.

21:46.280 --> 21:51.560
We're gonna either, I just, I think they're gonna, they're gonna rev the current 4, right?

21:51.560 --> 21:52.560
That's what I'm going for.

21:52.560 --> 21:56.360
The Raspberry Pi 4 Model B is gonna get a rev of some kind.

21:56.360 --> 21:58.480
It's gonna, I don't know how they're gonna do it.

21:58.480 --> 22:04.640
It may replace it altogether with the Raspberry Pi 5, or they may be like the B+.

22:04.640 --> 22:10.680
If they, if the, if the Pi 4 hasn't been replaced, you know, with like a next iteration at this

22:10.680 --> 22:15.120
time next year, I think it's a, I think it's a loss because like if they update the Picos

22:15.120 --> 22:18.000
or the Pi 400, that doesn't count.

22:18.000 --> 22:20.520
It's gotta be the flagship big Pi.

22:20.520 --> 22:22.520
Ah, the flagship Pi.

22:22.520 --> 22:23.520
Okay.

22:23.520 --> 22:24.520
Okay.

22:24.520 --> 22:25.840
Well, I think you're going to get this one.

22:25.840 --> 22:29.600
I'll be surprised if not, but time will tell.

22:29.600 --> 22:30.600
We will see.

22:30.600 --> 22:33.560
Um, I read a couple of interviews that make me think it's not going to happen because

22:33.560 --> 22:39.720
they were set in expectations low, so we'll see, but I'd love to see it.

22:39.720 --> 22:43.280
And then we have, we have a Linux action news tradition here on the show.

22:43.280 --> 22:47.280
I don't know why, but it started with Joe and I talking about Bitcoin and trying to

22:47.280 --> 22:50.280
make our annual Bitcoin predictions.

22:50.280 --> 22:54.280
And it just seems like an impossible thing to do, but we did want to do a little reflection.

22:54.280 --> 22:55.920
Yeah, we like being wrong.

22:55.920 --> 23:00.280
And what better way than to try to speculate about the price of cryptocurrency?

23:00.280 --> 23:01.320
There's no better way.

23:01.320 --> 23:04.280
There's no better way to be wrong faster either.

23:04.280 --> 23:09.000
And 2021 was a wild year for cryptocurrency and Bitcoin in general.

23:09.000 --> 23:14.600
At the beginning of the year, Bitcoin shot up to nearly $40,000 at the end of January.

23:14.600 --> 23:21.160
April 3rd, it broke $63,000 and then it just ramped down and up for the rest of summer.

23:21.160 --> 23:27.880
And then in early October, an all time high of $68,000 was hit and then crashed down about

23:27.880 --> 23:31.920
40% for about four days and then has built up some of its losses.

23:31.920 --> 23:36.400
And it's now, as we record sitting around 51,000, but here's some interesting numbers

23:36.400 --> 23:42.160
for you, Wes, as of 2021, the entire crypto market, when you include like Ethereum and

23:42.160 --> 23:48.800
a lot of the altcoins is now worth $2.4 trillion.

23:48.800 --> 23:50.880
It's truly just become its own economy.

23:50.880 --> 23:56.080
And to put that in perspective, crypto market is 2.4 trillion.

23:56.080 --> 23:59.480
All of France's economy is 3 trillion.

23:59.480 --> 24:02.160
India's economy, 2.8 trillion.

24:02.160 --> 24:06.680
If you take out just Bitcoin, Bitcoin is a trillion on its own, over a trillion on its

24:06.680 --> 24:12.320
own, which is larger than Italy's economy by a lot.

24:12.320 --> 24:17.120
Just Bitcoin alone is barking at the size of India's economy.

24:17.120 --> 24:22.560
I mean, you know, that's something, Wes, that is, those are huge, huge numbers.

24:22.560 --> 24:27.160
Well, and it just seems to be far more present just in the culture, right?

24:27.160 --> 24:33.560
I mean, many folks who are otherwise not interested in technology or speculating in stocks, well,

24:33.560 --> 24:36.640
they know what crypto is, and maybe they have a small amount of it.

24:36.640 --> 24:38.720
It's certainly become more popular in institutions.

24:38.720 --> 24:43.960
Yeah, that's been, it's been a big trend this year, some large institutions, including JP

24:43.960 --> 24:44.960
Morgan.

24:44.960 --> 24:51.640
Their crypto strategy go all in El Salvador, the city of Miami.

24:51.640 --> 24:57.240
These really interesting ones, Coinbase had their IPO, rocky year, but they're doing kind

24:57.240 --> 25:00.540
of better now towards the end of the year.

25:00.540 --> 25:05.960
Those all were big institutional moves that started to legitimize cryptocurrency for,

25:05.960 --> 25:09.000
I think, another wave of adoption.

25:09.000 --> 25:12.160
You still have tons and tons of critics and skeptics out there, but I think another wave

25:12.160 --> 25:14.420
of adoption happened in 2021.

25:14.420 --> 25:19.500
Like you're saying, getting really close to that near mainstream, and it's really interesting

25:19.500 --> 25:23.800
how it sort of reminded me a lot of Linux's early uptake.

25:23.800 --> 25:28.560
A lot of people thought, what does it do that Windows doesn't do or network isn't doing?

25:28.560 --> 25:30.580
What is the critical app of Linux?

25:30.580 --> 25:31.960
What is its critical function?

25:31.960 --> 25:35.860
A lot of people were skeptical about the security model, about open source and free software

25:35.860 --> 25:40.440
developers just donating their time, about IP issues, a lot of early skepticism.

25:40.440 --> 25:45.400
And then some of us really saw some potential in it and really stuck with it, and then 30

25:45.400 --> 25:48.520
years later and it dominates the world.

25:48.520 --> 25:53.280
Bitcoin, it's been around since 2009, and if you look at its trajectory and you compare

25:53.280 --> 25:57.160
it to previous adoptions, a lot of people will compare it to the internet and say that

25:57.160 --> 26:01.220
it has a faster pace of adoption than the internet did in its early years.

26:01.220 --> 26:06.000
But I don't know if it's an apt comparison because Bitcoin is more like a protocol.

26:06.000 --> 26:08.740
It's more like the slow adoption of TCP IP.

26:08.740 --> 26:16.040
When TCP IP was announced, there was dozens of competitors, NetBui, IPX, Appletalk, Token,

26:16.040 --> 26:20.480
all these different network standards that all of these different vendors tried to push

26:20.480 --> 26:22.920
and sort of pooh-poohed all over TCP IP.

26:22.920 --> 26:28.080
But over time, it just became the great unifier, became the great nullifier, and it just took

26:28.080 --> 26:29.080
over.

26:29.080 --> 26:34.280
And it seems like we're seeing a similar trajectory that just has become obvious in 2021.

26:34.280 --> 26:39.000
Coin Ring was obviously trying to hint at our crypto future.

26:39.000 --> 26:43.700
The other thing that happened was a China ban on mining, which represented a ginormous

26:43.700 --> 26:45.480
portion of the Bitcoin network.

26:45.480 --> 26:50.960
They cracked down and the network hash rate dropped, and then the mining spun up mostly

26:50.960 --> 26:56.600
in Western countries, and now the hash rate's higher than it was before China did the crackdown.

26:56.600 --> 27:02.760
So it's hard to say like, what could 2022 possibly, what could happen, right?

27:02.760 --> 27:04.520
You have world economies that are a mess.

27:04.520 --> 27:05.520
Who knows?

27:05.520 --> 27:08.320
It just feels more impossible than ever to make a prediction because there's so many

27:08.320 --> 27:09.320
factors now.

27:09.320 --> 27:10.320
Well, that's just it.

27:10.320 --> 27:13.320
I think it's more in the front of everyone's mind.

27:13.320 --> 27:16.080
We're waiting on decisions about regulation.

27:16.080 --> 27:21.000
And I think we're waiting to see what 2022 brings for the overall market.

27:21.000 --> 27:25.200
I'm kind of curious to see what bears out when we do have more of a bear market.

27:25.200 --> 27:29.720
If people are forced to start to divest in some of their holdings, do they choose to

27:29.720 --> 27:33.880
do that in stocks or gold or is crypto the thing that they sell first?

27:33.880 --> 27:38.640
I don't know, but I'm curious to see what happens.

27:38.640 --> 27:42.200
So here's my prediction, because I got a price prediction, but I actually think there's something

27:42.200 --> 27:44.680
else that probably should be called out here.

27:44.680 --> 27:48.080
So right now, like if you just look within the last week or two, you'll find several

27:48.080 --> 27:53.400
accredited, intelligent people who say Bitcoin's going to collapse.

27:53.400 --> 27:59.280
Carol Alexander, professor of finance over at Sussex University or Sussex University,

27:59.280 --> 28:05.040
said that she expects Bitcoin to tank as low as $10,000 in 2022.

28:05.040 --> 28:09.060
She says it's going to wipe out the gains of basically the last two years.

28:09.060 --> 28:11.040
And if you're invested in Bitcoin, you should get out now.

28:11.040 --> 28:13.320
It has no fundamental value.

28:13.320 --> 28:17.000
And then you've got others that say it has intrinsic value because it's a digital currency

28:17.000 --> 28:18.780
you can send anywhere around the world.

28:18.780 --> 28:20.420
There's a fixed cost to mine it.

28:20.420 --> 28:23.760
The utility of it gives it its worth.

28:23.760 --> 28:27.140
And then, of course, like humans, it's worth whatever we say it is.

28:27.140 --> 28:31.840
And these are two battles that have been playing out since 2009.

28:31.840 --> 28:35.320
And I think in 2022, one side's going to have to shut up.

28:35.320 --> 28:38.800
Either this thing's going to the moon side's going to win, or the people that say this

28:38.800 --> 28:43.880
thing like your Peter Schiff's or your Carol Alexander's say this thing's going to crash.

28:43.880 --> 28:47.420
They're going to have to shut up by the end of 2022, because it's going to get to a point

28:47.420 --> 28:50.800
where it's just either going to be ludicrous to make those claims anymore, or it's going

28:50.800 --> 28:53.120
to be they were right all along.

28:53.120 --> 28:58.600
And so we will end that debate, and in the process of starting all of this out, it's

28:58.600 --> 29:02.960
either going to be heralded as the moment right before the big crash, or the moment

29:02.960 --> 29:08.800
right before it took off Bitcoin, at least momentarily in 2022, I predict will hit $70,000.

29:08.800 --> 29:12.280
I see you're not stepping too far out, right?

29:12.280 --> 29:19.120
If it was a 68 or so back in October, then just hitting 70 sometime in the year.

29:19.120 --> 29:20.720
That doesn't seem too outlandish.

29:20.720 --> 29:23.400
But I guess my question is, where do you think it's going to end up?

29:23.400 --> 29:24.400
Right?

29:24.400 --> 29:27.720
Okay, we might have another, you know, summer of crypto where everyone's excited, but December

29:27.720 --> 29:31.120
next year, where are we going to be tough to say, huh?

29:31.120 --> 29:36.400
Because it does, it does seem like more and more of the normals are learning about cryptocurrencies

29:36.400 --> 29:37.760
and theorem included.

29:37.760 --> 29:40.200
And here's something else I've noticed.

29:40.200 --> 29:45.440
Linux appeals to a narrow band of people that are trying to get something done or have a

29:45.440 --> 29:47.800
certain philosophy about the world.

29:47.800 --> 29:49.840
But a lot of people like making money.

29:49.840 --> 29:55.640
And so people who are not technically inclined, are interested in making money.

29:55.640 --> 29:59.740
And I gave my son a little bit of Bitcoin for Christmas.

29:59.740 --> 30:01.300
And he's 12 years old.

30:01.300 --> 30:04.620
You know what, though, you know what, Wes, he got it immediately.

30:04.620 --> 30:10.160
And the fact that it was digital, and not like tied to a physical metal or something,

30:10.160 --> 30:14.960
is a complete non issue for my son who, you know, has lived in a Minecraft style metaverse

30:14.960 --> 30:17.820
and just works with digital stuff.

30:17.820 --> 30:18.820
He's done online schooling.

30:18.820 --> 30:20.520
All of it is digital to him.

30:20.520 --> 30:21.720
It's all digital.

30:21.720 --> 30:26.960
And so to him, the fact that it's a digital asset is huge because he's 12 years old, right?

30:26.960 --> 30:30.160
Now all of a sudden, he's basically got a bank on his phone.

30:30.160 --> 30:33.940
And he's thinking about how to convert this cash that he's got into that.

30:33.940 --> 30:37.200
So that way, maybe he'll grow that a little bit over time, just thinking like the way

30:37.200 --> 30:42.240
he just got it made me realize the younger generation, like, you know, younger than you

30:42.240 --> 30:48.760
and I are even more digitally inclined, they're even more just tuned into this kind of thing.

30:48.760 --> 30:51.240
And so you got those people coming online.

30:51.240 --> 30:55.880
They're gonna have some spendable money, you know, 18, 19, 20, 25 year olds, they're gonna

30:55.880 --> 30:58.960
be coming online, they're gonna be able to get the cash app, they're gonna be able to,

30:58.960 --> 30:59.960
you know, get the strike app.

30:59.960 --> 31:01.480
Well, that's just it, right?

31:01.480 --> 31:06.280
That it's so much easier now, you don't have to understand necessarily how to host your

31:06.280 --> 31:09.440
own wallet or be running software on your system.

31:09.440 --> 31:13.760
There's friendly apps that let you buy stocks and crypto at the same time.

31:13.760 --> 31:20.200
Also you got the fact that as of 2021, 90% of all bitcoins have been mined.

31:20.200 --> 31:24.360
Only 10% of the 21 million now remains.

31:24.360 --> 31:27.440
That is going to create a supply crunch.

31:27.440 --> 31:31.360
Also you mean just thinking of price pressure, the Bitcoin miners are holding, right?

31:31.360 --> 31:36.600
The exchanges are at a three year inventory low for Bitcoin right now, because the Bitcoin

31:36.600 --> 31:40.080
miners are holding waiting for the prices to come up.

31:40.080 --> 31:45.520
But you've also got inflation in the US that's really bad right now, not just the US, right?

31:45.520 --> 31:48.800
I mean, Bitcoin is a worldwide currency and inflation is going rampant in all kinds of

31:48.800 --> 31:55.160
places and there's going to be a percentage right or wrong that see Bitcoin as an inflation

31:55.160 --> 31:56.160
hedge.

31:56.160 --> 31:58.560
So those things I think are going to drive the price up.

31:58.560 --> 32:01.880
But then you have the fact that here in the States, interest rates are going up.

32:01.880 --> 32:05.000
So cheap or free money is going away.

32:05.000 --> 32:07.380
So the institutional investors are going to pull back.

32:07.380 --> 32:13.600
So it really seems like it could be anyone's game, but when you factor in the limited supply,

32:13.600 --> 32:19.520
the fact that inflation is a problem, mainstream adoption, easy technological innovations,

32:19.520 --> 32:23.240
the fact that we really haven't seen the benefits from the lightning network coming online yet,

32:23.240 --> 32:28.260
which is going to make transactions super fast and super cheap, and you have El Salvador

32:28.260 --> 32:33.200
that's just kind of getting their stuff sorted out, I kind of feel like on the all it's going

32:33.200 --> 32:35.120
to end up higher than lower.

32:35.120 --> 32:39.420
And when I say 70,000, I hope I'm I hope it's going to be higher than 70,000.

32:39.420 --> 32:44.440
But you know, if you've pinned your hopes on something like that, Bitcoin will disappoint.

32:44.440 --> 32:48.680
Yeah, I think I'll be I'll be the bear today, then and not too much.

32:48.680 --> 32:51.640
But I think we're just gonna see a flat 2020.

32:51.640 --> 32:56.200
Probably this time next year, we'll be flirting around 50k just the same that we are now,

32:56.200 --> 33:00.960
you know, maybe a little over maybe a little under, but nothing too far different from

33:00.960 --> 33:01.960
50k.

33:01.960 --> 33:06.200
I mean, that sounds boring, but reasonable with you know, especially with the altcoins

33:06.200 --> 33:11.760
like Ethereum and others out there that are showing some interesting technical solutions.

33:11.760 --> 33:16.920
I can see the money going from Bitcoin to things like Ethereum or salon and stuff like

33:16.920 --> 33:17.920
that.

33:17.920 --> 33:18.920
We'll see.

33:18.920 --> 33:20.320
We don't know.

33:20.320 --> 33:21.800
That's why we only talk about it once a year.

33:21.800 --> 33:26.340
Otherwise, it's back to Linux and open source for us starting in January on Thursdays.

33:26.340 --> 33:30.080
So go to linuxactionnews.com slash subscribe so that way you don't miss a single episode

33:30.080 --> 33:31.080
in the transition.

33:31.080 --> 33:36.040
And linuxactionnews.com slash contact for ways to keep in touch.

33:36.040 --> 33:42.600
And join us on a Sunday now Linux Unplugged will be live over at jblive.tv around 1230

33:42.600 --> 33:47.440
Pacific and that would be 3pm Eastern at jblive.tv.

33:47.440 --> 33:54.080
As for this show, well, we'll be back Thursday the 6th with our weekly take on the latest

33:54.080 --> 33:56.600
Linux and open source news.

33:56.600 --> 34:14.200
Thanks for joining us and Happy New Year.
