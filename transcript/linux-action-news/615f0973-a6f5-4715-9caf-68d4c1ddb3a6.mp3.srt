00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,760
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, episode 243, recorded on June 1st, 2022.

2
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:09,760
I'm Chris.

3
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:10,760
And I'm Wes.

4
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:11,760
Hello, Wes.

5
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:13,000
Let's do the news.

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,320
We start this week with some good news.

7
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:22,720
The LVFS project has served more than 52 million firmware downloads to Linux users.

8
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:26,720
Now for a little perspective, that was just 25 million this time last year.

9
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:29,160
That's an impressive rate of growth.

10
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:30,160
It sure is.

11
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:33,400
And Red Hat's Richard Hughes is still running the project.

12
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:39,520
And he presented a bunch of different bits of data at the Embedded Recipes 2022 conference.

13
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:45,440
For instance, we learned that LVFS is up to more than 120 different hardware partners.

14
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:50,680
And more recently, LVFS kicked off the Flupd Friendly Firmware Initiative.

15
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:54,520
The goal with this new initiative is to help hardware partners that already have Flupd

16
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:56,560
plugins available.

17
00:00:56,560 --> 00:01:00,320
You can imagine how this becomes a little more important with larger hardware manufacturing

18
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:06,200
adoption, like, say, Google's Chromebooks and other devices requiring Flupd support

19
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:08,640
as part of their certification process.

20
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:13,080
Also this week, speaking of Flupd, version 1.8.1 was released.

21
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:16,600
That's the back end software side to LVFS.

22
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:21,880
Among a range of bug fixes and improvements was support for more Thunderbolt and USB-C

23
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:26,960
blocks, which is really nice to see, because those devices, unfortunately, do require

24
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:31,720
firmware updates.

25
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:36,080
If you were a little quick to jump on the latest Linux release, 5.18, like a certain

26
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:42,760
Chris Fisher was, well, new benchmarkers out there may have noticed a performance regression.

27
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:48,240
Michael Larable over at Ferronix sure noticed it, and as he puts it, bisected it.

28
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:51,520
He sure did, in kind of his classic way.

29
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:56,800
He tracked it down to some memory management changes in Linux 5.18, and in particular,

30
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:59,800
the LRU cache disable change.

31
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:04,920
But thankfully, it turns out Red Hat's Marcelo Tosanti was already way ahead of him, and

32
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:08,400
back in March created a patch to fix the issue.

33
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:13,680
And like some of our most favorite patches, this one is just a really simple one-liner.

34
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:18,640
A simple but important change that's now on its way to the mainline kernel via Andrew

35
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:23,480
Morton's memory management patch series, and should be backported for Linux 5.18.

36
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:28,040
We'll have a link to more coverage by Ferronix if you're curious, including the benchmarks

37
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:33,440
that demonstrate the issue.

38
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:38,200
Following up on the recent open source NVIDIA driver news, the Nouveau project has begun

39
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:43,040
laying the groundwork to adapt its code into a standalone library.

40
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:48,000
So far, the work seems to be focused on restructuring the basic way that Nouveau's Mesa driver

41
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,360
code is generated, making it possible that that generated code can actually function

42
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:55,160
and live in a standalone library.

43
00:02:55,160 --> 00:03:00,400
Red Hat's David Arlyle stated, quote, this just moves the code gen build into a separate

44
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,520
library.

45
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:06,960
This is just prep work for a future where another driver wants to reuse this code.

46
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:11,720
This isn't perfect for plugging into a Vulkan driver, but doing that requires more in-depth

47
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:12,720
surgery.

48
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:17,760
Yeah, and as Christian explained to us just a few weeks ago, NVIDIA is going to need several

49
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:22,120
open source user space components that can speak to all of the exposed kernel interfaces.

50
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:27,320
Yeah, really kind of seems that they would benefit by using as much of the Nouveau project

51
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:29,240
as possible.

52
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:32,760
And this is kind of just the first small step starting that effort.

53
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:33,760
Yeah.

54
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:38,480
I mean, I think this gives us our first real sense from the outside of just how much fundamental

55
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:40,960
work is ahead for this team.

56
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:45,880
You know, a glimpse of just all of the things that need to be done.

57
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:55,800
And maybe that's why personally to me, this is looking like a multi-year project at least.

58
00:03:55,800 --> 00:04:01,220
Matrix fans were pleased to see the team at Rocket Chat announced plans to build new federated

59
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:05,120
features on top of the Matrix protocol.

60
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:08,840
If you're not familiar, you could consider Rocket Chat an open source alternative to

61
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:09,840
Slack, I suppose.

62
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:14,680
So this is pretty great to see because really, the last thing we needed is another standard

63
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:19,880
from another project and how we should federate all of our different chat systems.

64
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:24,280
And I think Rocket Chat was clever to acknowledge that they're going to benefit from the growing

65
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:26,440
network effect Matrix is seeing as well.

66
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:27,440
Yeah, right.

67
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:32,200
I mean, this move means Rocket Chat users should be able to communicate with anyone

68
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:35,200
who's already using a Matrix compatible chat client.

69
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:38,160
That means you don't have to throw out your existing clients, you don't have to throw

70
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:42,280
out your Rocket Chat infrastructure, but you still get all the benefits of a true cross

71
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:47,120
platform, secure, standards-based chat.

72
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,180
This really is so great.

73
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:53,040
And it sounds like the Rocket Chat team chose to use Dendrite for their Matrix backend.

74
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,840
That's a more modern backend of the server.

75
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:56,960
So that's a savvy choice on their part.

76
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:01,460
And they also touched on the importance of openness and users having control over their

77
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:02,520
own data.

78
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:08,240
And they mentioned in their release announcement that that need is growing now more than ever

79
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:13,720
stating quote, the European Union's recent Digital Markets Act to limit the market power

80
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:23,320
of large online chat and messaging platforms is evidence of this need.

81
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:30,080
Impressively just one week after Red Hat Enterprise 9's general availability, Alma Linux 9 is

82
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:32,760
now here and out.

83
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:36,120
Alma Linux 9 has now arrived.

84
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:42,280
Like the RHEL 9 it's based on, Alma Linux 9.0 ships kernel version 5.14 and contains

85
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:48,360
enhancements around cloud and container development and improvements to the web console cockpit.

86
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:53,400
This release also features additional security profiles that greatly improve SE Linux performance,

87
00:05:53,400 --> 00:06:03,240
as well as Python 3.9, GCC 11, and the latest versions of LLVM, Rust, and Go.

88
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:08,640
Linode.com slash LAN, go there to get $100 in 60 day credit on a new account.

89
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:10,600
And of course you go there to support Linux Action News.

90
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:12,960
So it's linode.com slash LAN.

91
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:19,500
They make it simple, affordable, and accessible to deploy and manage your projects, your infrastructure

92
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:20,640
in the cloud.

93
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:25,600
And they do it better than anyone for a better price and better performance.

94
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,280
That's the bottom line right there.

95
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:28,640
They also have fantastic support.

96
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:32,360
I hear that all the time when the audience gets stuck, Linode's helped them out.

97
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:38,120
And they just posted a white paper, it's really a full report, and it's a free PDF download,

98
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:41,660
no email required, none of that stuff, I'll link it in the show notes, and they've gone

99
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:47,760
through in this report, a third party has, and they have benchmarked AWS, Azure, Google

100
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:51,640
Cloud, and Linode's GPU based virtual machines.

101
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:56,260
And they've done this using standardized and repeatable testing methodologies that they've

102
00:06:56,260 --> 00:07:02,200
used for all different kinds of industry benchmarks, a wide range of workloads was tested, and

103
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:05,640
you can probably guess Linode always, always comes out on top.

104
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:12,680
They have systems powered by AMD epic processors, powerful GPUs, powerful GPU systems, and of

105
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:17,880
course they have MVME storage for boxes that just have incredible IOPS.

106
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:21,840
But if you're looking for something to just host a personal website, a blog, a portfolio,

107
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:26,040
a gaming server, or you're looking something that can handle millions of users, Linode's

108
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:27,600
got you there too.

109
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:30,600
They've got some of the best performance with 11 data centers you can choose from, something

110
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:34,400
that's going to be close to you or your customers, and they have great features on top of that

111
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:39,320
which have really brought our game up, like object storage, Terraform support, Ansible

112
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:44,800
support, Cloud Firewall, great simple to understand backups that are crazy easy to recover from,

113
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:45,800
all of that.

114
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:49,400
So go build something, go learn something, go support the show, go see why we deploy

115
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:51,780
all of our stuff on Linode.

116
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:57,640
Just go to linode.com slash LAN.

117
00:07:57,640 --> 00:08:01,600
And this episode is made possible by your direct support, Jupiter.party.

You go sign up, you get access to all the shows, and your support makes a real difference.

124
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:28,720
The NixOS project surprised those in the world who were not following the project's inner

125
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:38,200
workings closely when it announced a new release, version 2205, with a complete graphical installer.

126
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:42,480
Now in case you've never installed NixOS, traditionally the way you do it is a direct

127
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:45,720
process right on the command line.

128
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:50,800
This new graphical installer though, it's built atop the Colomaris installer framework.

129
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:56,800
Colomaris is a free and open source, independent, and distro agnostic installer.

130
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:02,600
If you've ever installed Garuda, Manjaro, Netrunner, KDE Neon, EndeavorOS, or used Debian's

131
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:09,360
live medium installer option, then you have probably used Colomaris.

132
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:14,480
And while no longer will you have to hunt for some special ISO, now the Plasma and GNOME

133
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:19,360
ISO images for NixOS feature a fully updated graphical installer.

134
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:23,080
Now you could still opt to grab the minimal ISO, which keeps that traditional command

135
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:28,000
line approach, if that's your style, but of course, Wes and I had to give this a go before

136
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
the show.

137
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,500
Yeah, you know us, we got to try the new Shiny.

138
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:38,520
I should say that as a new Nix user, I'm kind of impressed this is possible at all.

139
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:43,480
You know, when I started down the NixOS journey, I was kind of just taking it for granted that

140
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:47,440
much like the early days of Arch, this was going to be a command line process.

141
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:51,400
I don't mind that the NixOS install is actually pretty straightforward once you know, figure

142
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:55,240
out how Nix works at all.

143
00:09:55,240 --> 00:10:02,320
But having an installer is a huge win for new users for quickly trying out system settings,

144
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:07,000
or just to start your system before you've gotten fully to grasp with the Nix expression

145
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
language.

146
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:13,080
And, you know, what also makes this really neat to my developer focused eyes is because

147
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:19,000
this is declarative, because it's Nix based, you can go take a look at the PR and see everything.

148
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,000
You don't have to go hunt through six different build things or a bunch of different repos

149
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:28,320
on GitHub or on some distribution specific server or source control system.

150
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:32,400
No, you can check out all the changes, all the patches that were needed, the sort of

151
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:35,640
custom Calamares extensions that were developed.

152
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:39,300
All of that is in one spot in one PR on GitHub.

153
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:43,120
And that that right there, it's the power of NixOS.

154
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:47,200
Yeah, that does make it really simple to understand everything that's happening behind the scenes.

155
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:52,000
I kind of like you was thinking, well, they're never going to do a graphical installer because

156
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:57,020
you kind of learn how Nix works by installing Nix.

157
00:10:57,020 --> 00:10:58,080
You have to.

158
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:01,560
And so I thought, well, they're going to keep it this way forever because you got to learn

159
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:05,000
these basics to use the distro at all.

160
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:10,560
But we then kind of had a hint coming our way because the developer who ported this

161
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:16,640
to NixOS has been hanging out in our Nix nerds matrix chat room, which is a great chat room.

162
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:20,680
And they tease some of this, but it just wasn't really clear.

163
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,080
Would it actually ship?

164
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:23,980
When would it ship if it did?

165
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:27,360
And then, you know, it just dropped and it was we were all very excited.

166
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:32,220
And so I had a chance to ask them a couple of brief questions and just kind of find out

167
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:34,960
where they're going with this in our matrix room.

168
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:40,000
They go by Vlynx, and I asked them why they went to the trouble to bring a GUI installer

169
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,160
to such a pro user focused distro.

170
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:48,640
They replied, quote, My main goal was to make it easier for new people to install and try

171
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:54,000
NixOS, while also making it easier for others like me, who even though we could install

172
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,880
through the terminal, prefer a simple click through installation.

173
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:59,080
I can relate to that.

174
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:03,240
You know, I was becoming more comfortable with the idea and getting a little bit faster

175
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:05,760
each time and installing NixOS via the command line.

176
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:10,120
And once you kind of just even get casually familiar with it, you know, it's like a 15

177
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:11,120
minute install process.

178
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:13,080
It's not a big deal.

179
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:20,000
But I got to admit, after trying the GUI install approach, I do prefer that method.

180
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,400
For one, it's just kind of how I install pretty much almost every other distro.

181
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:28,680
And I tend to do something else while I'm installing a Linux distro.

182
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:32,400
It's not like the thing that has my sole focus, right?

183
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:37,880
So a GUI, it helps me kind of keep track of my state and keep an overview of what I'm

184
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:39,440
actually doing.

185
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:44,040
And so I asked Vlynx, like, is this something you plan to maintain over time?

186
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:48,480
Because I imagine once you release something like this out there to the wild, there's going

187
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:53,520
to be bug fixes that come in and you know, features that need to be added, right?

188
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:58,120
And you know, changes that might break things, maintenance to do, new NixOS releases to keep

189
00:12:58,120 --> 00:12:59,120
up with.

190
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:05,840
But Vlynx responded, quote, I definitely plan to keep working on it and similar projects.

191
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:10,820
I've heard some people mention they'd like a way to import GitHub configs during installation.

192
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:16,040
So if I make more changes to the installer, that would probably be what I work on.

193
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:20,680
But I plan on ensuring that the installer stays stable for a while to come.

194
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:23,840
Now that it's been released, I plan to try to upstream some of the changes to the main

195
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:26,440
calamaris project as well.

196
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:27,440
That's great.

197
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:31,400
I mean, there's a few things that would be nice to see get tweaked over time, like just

198
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:37,000
small stuff like potentially the default image on the live session maybe could have a longer

199
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:42,040
power timeout because it's pretty likely that your system's going to start going to sleep

200
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:43,200
before the installs over.

201
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:45,280
So you got to wake it up right during installation.

202
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:49,800
Or if you're on Wi-Fi, if you're not plugged in, the installer will come up and say you

203
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:51,800
have no internet, so you can't proceed.

204
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:55,280
Even after you've connected to internet, you have to close the installer and relaunch it.

205
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:59,620
Small quality of life things, but you could see people making small patches over time

206
00:13:59,620 --> 00:14:01,400
to clean this stuff up.

207
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:04,040
So I just think that's a fantastic answer.

208
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:07,960
And the fact that Vlynx is planning to upstream all of that stuff, too, means that these other

209
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:10,120
distros are going to get the benefit.

210
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:13,320
This is the stuff you just love about free software.

211
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:19,200
And also, Vlynx said, kind of implied with a few links, that they were working on some

212
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:24,880
other projects to make NixOS even more new user friendly.

213
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:29,760
Yeah, they noted, quote, I'm currently working on a graphical configuration editor.

214
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:35,320
Overall, I hope someday that even non-terminal users can take advantage of all the features

215
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:37,040
Nix and NixOS offer.

216
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:41,640
Yeah, we're going to have to throw a link to that Nix config editor in the show notes.

217
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:42,640
It sure looks neat.

218
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:47,440
I mean, I only took a very quick look at it, but I like where it's headed.

219
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:54,160
It's a simple NixOS configuration editor application, built with libidwaita, GTK4, and Realm 4,

220
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:58,400
that lets you adjust common Nix settings without having to totally understand exactly how to

221
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:00,080
compose a Nix expression yourself.

222
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:04,400
Yep, just one more thing that's going to make it even more approachable to folks.

223
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:10,760
And I get a real sense that these goals, they're not just like the goals of one developer in

224
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:11,760
the project.

225
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:16,520
I believe they're the goals of many developers in the project, and that they want to bring

226
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:19,480
Nix and NixOS to new users.

227
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:23,400
And maybe they're not really saying it out loud, but I kind of get a sense that they're

228
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:26,680
trying to appeal to a Fedora user.

229
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:31,600
Yeah, talking to them and reading through the discussions on GitHub, you really do get

230
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,320
that impression.

231
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:37,440
They want to offer one of the best development workstations in Linux, and these are some

232
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,920
of the steps they're taking to get there.

233
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:44,720
And I got to say, I'm kind of bolstered both by the support from the community after Valink's,

234
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:51,400
you know, sort of spearheaded this effort, and then also just how far this has come with

235
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:53,960
not that much support or involvement for the community.

236
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:58,760
I mean, that just says to me, some of the power and support from the NixOS environment

237
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:01,960
should really set up some future goals for success.

238
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:03,040
I agree.

239
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:07,600
And the tooling, like distro agnostic installers, just getting better and better to make this

240
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,080
stuff possible.

241
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:10,200
It's fascinating to watch.

242
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:11,200
It really is.

243
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:14,960
We, you know, NixOS has been around for a decade.

244
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:18,240
And all of a sudden, there is just all of this momentum here.

245
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:21,540
And more and more people, including us, have been checking it out.

246
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:26,160
It's just one of the many steps to making just the ultimate developer workstation, really

247
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:29,360
the power user workstation, and we just have more choices than ever.

248
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:34,040
We'll keep an eye on it, just like we do for everything in the free and open source world.

249
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:39,200

252
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:48,240
We've got a summer of projects here at Jupiter Broadcasting, and we're documenting all of

253
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:52,300
it in Office Hours, my new show, officehours.hair.

254
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:56,440
As for this show, well, don't worry, we'll be back next week with our take on the latest

255
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:59,040
Linux and open source news.
