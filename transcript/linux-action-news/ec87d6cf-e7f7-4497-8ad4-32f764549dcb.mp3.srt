00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, episode 169, recorded on December 20th, 2020.

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
I'm Chris.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
I'm Wes.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
And I'm Joe.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,040
Hello, gentlemen, and Joe, welcome back to the show.

6
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:15,720
Well, it's good to be here.

7
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:21,400
Now it is that time of year where we look back at what we said would happen in 2020,

8
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:24,620
and we predict what will happen in 2021.

9
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:28,200
And to help us go through those previous predictions, Joe's back.

10
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:31,820
And so since you're our guest of honor, Joe, we're going to start with you.

11
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:36,720
Last year, you predicted that in 2020, we'd be able to buy a RISC-V based single board

12
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:43,600
computer that's capable of running a full Linux desktop, maybe Debian and XFCE, perhaps,

13
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:47,520
and it will cost no more than the most expensive Raspberry Pi.

14
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:49,320
Unfortunately, this did not happen.

15
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:53,480
No, clearly, I was wrong about this, although I listened to it and I did predict an eight

16
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:58,520
gigabyte RAM Raspberry Pi, so maybe half a point for that.

17
00:00:58,520 --> 00:00:59,520
Yeah.

18
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:00,520
Yeah.

19
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:02,000
Accidental half point there.

20
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,680
You could tell it's a true Joe prediction, too, because it's got XFCE.

21
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:05,680
Yeah.

22
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:06,680
Of course.

23
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:09,040
Well, that's what he would be running with it, right?

24
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:10,040
I mean, yeah.

25
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:11,580
But the eight gig Pi, that's interesting.

26
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:13,120
Was that just a casual mention?

27
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:14,120
Yeah, yeah.

28
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:16,080
Well, all right.

29
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:18,360
This one, I'm kind of curious to know what you guys think.

30
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:19,360
I'll do mine.

31
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:24,160
I said Richard Stallman would reemerge on the talk scene, not necessarily affiliated

32
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:29,160
with any particular group, but he'd be like a mercenary for free software out there and

33
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:32,800
about and we'd see him sort of pop up a little bit more.

34
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:33,800
Interesting.

35
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:34,800
Do you think I got that one?

36
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:35,800
Okay.

37
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:38,840
Well, this year, it's a little hard to tell because the scene is a bit different.

38
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:39,960
I don't know.

39
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:44,160
I don't know that he's at least anywhere near as prominent as he once was.

40
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:47,520
He has done some conferences like Emacs Conf 2020.

41
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,440
He was there and he did a couple of talks there.

42
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:54,600
One like AMA type thing, which is on YouTube, which I watched the other day.

43
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:56,560
So he's definitely not totally disappeared.

44
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:58,300
He definitely did come back.

45
00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:02,700
And that was what we were talking about was the whole political angle of it, that it kind

46
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:04,240
of been canceled.

47
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:09,920
And now he's kind of come back and it hasn't been as much of a stink about it as I thought

48
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:10,920
there might be.

49
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:11,920
Yeah, that's true.

50
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:12,920
There really hasn't been.

51
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:15,880
I guess I did kind of, although I didn't predict that there would be, I did kind of assume

52
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:16,880
there would be.

53
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:18,000
I think we all did.

54
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,040
So I'm kind of getting this one, it sounds like then.

55
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:24,480
I think also maybe if you look at it as did Richard Stallman totally fade away, the answer

56
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:25,480
is no.

57
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:27,480
And I think in that spirit, yeah, you get a point.

58
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:28,480
Yeah.

59
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,480
All right.

60
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:31,080
Well, on to Joe's next prediction.

61
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:35,600
By this time next year, there'll be a license that solves the AWS problem.

62
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:38,040
Well, still being open source.

63
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:39,460
Now, this is interesting.

64
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:44,000
There's a lot of definitions here, particularly open source and the AWS problem.

65
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,840
And do you think you got this one, Joe?

66
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:46,840
Not quite.

67
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:47,840
Almost.

68
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:53,560
The AWS problem, of course, is that the likes of Amazon are taking open source software

69
00:02:53,560 --> 00:03:00,600
and selling it as a service and not contributing financially or even code back to the original

70
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:01,840
projects.

71
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:05,960
And so we had various attempts last year at it.

72
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:10,960
And I think we had a pretty good one this year, which was the timescale license, which

73
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:14,320
is pretty close, but it's not quite open source.

74
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:17,280
So I don't think I can claim a full point here.

75
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:21,480
Yeah, timescale does get close, but I don't think it was quite the spirit of it.

76
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:23,320
So I tend to agree there.

77
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:27,080
There still is that overall AWS problem, not fully solved.

78
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:30,160
I guess this next year, we'll see what happens.

79
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:32,920
All right, Chris, I think you're up for now.

80
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:33,920
All right.

81
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:37,440
So this one, it seemed like everything was in place.

82
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:41,400
There are almost years of little hints leading up to this prediction.

83
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:44,000
And I thought it was going to pop this year.

84
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,160
But I don't think I can make that claim.

85
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:50,500
I said that NVIDIA would show various types of support.

86
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:55,320
Maybe it was code, documentation, developer time, et cetera, that would enable the nouveau

87
00:03:55,320 --> 00:04:01,040
driver to become really functional, close to fully functional for basic daily driver

88
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:04,320
uses with the NVIDIA graphics card.

89
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:06,800
But it just did not materialize.

90
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:12,800
I even saw rumors and suggestions that certain NVIDIA developers were having conversations

91
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:17,460
with certain Red Hat developers to make some of this work, like on the DL.

92
00:04:17,460 --> 00:04:20,840
But nothing I can point to officially and say, yeah, they stepped up and they really

93
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:21,840
enabled the project.

94
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:25,480
Yeah, weren't we expecting some sort of conference talk that ultimately got canceled?

95
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:28,840
But it seemed like this was in the works and I guess just never realized.

96
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:29,840
Yep.

97
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:31,840
There was a talk that was scheduled.

98
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:36,580
There was, if you go back to 2019, there were several announcements about how documentation

99
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:37,580
was going to get delivered.

100
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:42,360
There was a GitHub repo set up, and it just all went nowhere.

101
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:43,360
And you got to wonder what happened.

102
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:49,040
And in the meantime, AMD just seems to have refined their strategy on Linux.

103
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:52,280
We had Michael Arbel on recently, and he was talking about what a good year it was for

104
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:53,800
AMD on Linux.

105
00:04:53,800 --> 00:05:00,000
And you look at launch day with the 6800 series, and it's pretty solid on Linux.

106
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,640
And then you look over at NVIDIA and they've just really done nothing to improve the experience.

107
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:09,320
They've continued to make their driver and they continue to refine that.

108
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:12,680
It does perform well if you're willing to jump through the proprietary hoops, of course.

109
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:16,440
Yep, but nothing to really address the fact that AMD and Intel just have it all baked

110
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:18,120
into the Linux kernel now.

111
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:21,800
And that's what I was really hoping to see, some kind of help and support there that would

112
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,920
make this thing more functional.

113
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:27,120
And it just didn't happen.

114
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,680
Linode.com slash LAN.

115
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:33,760
Go there to get a $100 60-day credit towards your new account and go there to support the

116
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:35,040
show.

117
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,960
Linode is our cloud hosting provider.

118
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:41,080
All of us here on the show, we use Linode for our personal stuff and all of our business

119
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:42,080
stuff.

120
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,400
And I like that they're independently owned.

121
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:44,400
That really makes a difference.

122
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:47,920
I trust that they're going to be around for a long time.

123
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:54,200
And they started forever ago in 2003 as one of the first companies in cloud computing.

124
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:57,720
There's so many little nice features that you don't even really have to worry about.

125
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:02,440
For example, I was setting up a new rig and I was just sending a ton of data because it

126
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:06,280
was going to be the central node in this mesh network that I was setting up.

127
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:08,560
And so I was just sending a bunch of data to get it all synced up.

128
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:12,080
So when I turned everything on, it would have all of the files.

129
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:17,440
And about 15 minutes into this process, maybe 20 minutes into the process, I get a message

130
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:18,440
from Alex.

131
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:20,080
He says, what is going on?

132
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,560
What are you doing?

133
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:25,920
Because I had these little threshold alerts set up that were just perfect little reminders

134
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,900
that, hey, something's worth checking in on here.

135
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:30,180
Your box is doing something a little unusual.

136
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:34,040
And the number one thing that I know from running servers in production is that is a

137
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:37,480
great way to tell that something is wrong, that somebody has owned your box, something's

138
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:42,040
going on, or you have a process gun haywire, or something's syncing that you didn't expect

139
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:43,040
to sync.

140
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:47,440
These thresholds let you check in on things like CPU or bandwidth transfer in my case.

141
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:48,440
It generates a nice email.

142
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:49,440
It says, hey, you're not in trouble.

143
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:50,440
It's no big deal.

144
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:52,840
But this just meets the threshold, which you set.

145
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:55,340
And so we're letting you know that you've exceeded that.

146
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:59,360
And it was really kind of cool because I thought if we got that on the matrix server, we'd

147
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:01,240
know something was wrong.

148
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:03,600
That would be a sign that we should go check in on that kind of thing.

149
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:06,040
Or something was going really, really right.

150
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:10,280
It's a party on the matrix server, which we also host on Linode, of course.

151
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:11,280
So go check them out.

152
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:14,740
Because with that $100 credit, you can really build some awesome infrastructure with some

153
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:18,020
great tools around it to really make it run solid for you.

154
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:19,020
So it's stable.

155
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:20,020
It's fast.

156
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:21,180
They have 11 data centers around the world.

157
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:25,220
You can choose whatever is close to you or maybe close to your clients.

158
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:28,080
And of course, that dashboard makes it easy to tie it all together.

159
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:31,840
And unlike entry level hosting services that lock you into their platform, Linode gives

160
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:36,040
you full back end access to customize and control your server to fit your needs.

161
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:40,360
And they support tools like Kubernetes and Terraform, which great opportunity to learn

162
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:44,340
or great opportunity to plug it into your existing management system.

163
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:47,080
So go to linode.com slash LAN.

164
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:48,080
You go there.

165
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:50,600
You get that $100, 60 day credit towards the new account.

166
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:51,720
And you support the show.

167
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:55,580
You make it possible for independent media to give away their content for free by going

168
00:07:55,580 --> 00:07:57,720
to linode.com slash LAN.

169
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:58,720
OK.

170
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:01,780
So I'm not even officially on this show anymore.

171
00:08:01,780 --> 00:08:03,800
So I'm not going to be making any predictions.

172
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:06,620
So that's a good excuse for me to just be the unofficial referee.

173
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:09,940
So you two have got to do two each, I reckon.

174
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:11,460
So who's going to go first?

175
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:12,460
Wes?

176
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:13,460
Yeah, all right.

177
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:14,460
I'll do that.

178
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:18,180
This first one doesn't necessarily make me happy to say, but that's not how this game

179
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:19,180
is played, right?

180
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:22,560
I'm going to predict that Mozilla kills Pocket.

181
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:23,560
Pocket, huh?

182
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:24,560
Yeah.

183
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:26,260
You know, it just never really felt like a great fit.

184
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:27,660
They never open sourced it.

185
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:30,640
And it doesn't really seem like they've done anything with it.

186
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:31,640
No, I'm not opposed.

187
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:32,820
They've used Pocket.

188
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:34,980
Having a nice read it later service is pretty handy.

189
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:37,740
It makes sense as a feature in a browser, really.

190
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:39,660
They just like so many other things.

191
00:08:39,660 --> 00:08:40,660
It's rotting away.

192
00:08:40,660 --> 00:08:45,060
And with the, you know, the downsizing, the new version of Mozilla, I just don't know

193
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:48,300
that there's a ton of effort that they would have anyway to go in there.

194
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:49,740
So we'll see.

195
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:54,540
The thing that makes me think this might not happen is that just the other day I had a

196
00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:58,880
new installation of Linux and a new Firefox without my profile or anything.

197
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:01,260
And the first thing it said was, hey, try Pocket.

198
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:04,260
So they're still heavily promoting it to new users.

199
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:07,660
So I can see it, but I can also not see it.

200
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:11,060
I think we won't see it open sourced either way.

201
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:14,740
Isn't that just like the only exit strategy they have for Pocket that doesn't piss everyone

202
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:15,740
off?

203
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:16,740
Yeah, I think so.

204
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:21,020
If they just kill it and they fail to open source it, I think that's even worse PR for

205
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:22,020
them.

206
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:24,820
But I could totally see your resources argument here.

207
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:26,040
They don't really have the resources.

208
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:29,520
They haven't really got a solid way to monetize it in a way that's moving the needle for them

209
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:31,620
financially at all.

210
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:38,500
So they may have to focus in on what they can do well and what they can generate a profit

211
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:39,500
from.

212
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:41,820
I could see Pocket not being on that list.

213
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:43,940
But how they handle that, that's going to be critical.

214
00:09:43,940 --> 00:09:45,260
And you're not saying they're going to open source it.

215
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:46,260
You're saying they kill it.

216
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:47,260
I say they kill it.

217
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:48,780
They wind it down.

218
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:51,900
There's some sort of timeline where it's going to be going away.

219
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:53,460
All right.

220
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:55,060
We're locking that one in.

221
00:09:55,060 --> 00:09:59,140
So mine is a little safer of a bet than yours.

222
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:04,900
I predict that at least three traditional CentOS style clones will ship their quote

223
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:07,100
unquote 1.0 in 2021.

224
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:08,100
All right.

225
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:10,060
Well, I think that's where we'll first need the ref.

226
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:11,980
What are we counting as 1.0?

227
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:17,100
Is that just like a release that's ready for the general public to consume and deploy production

228
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:18,100
wise?

229
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:19,100
Yeah.

230
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:22,020
I don't know if they may call it they may call it 8.0 to make it clear what version

231
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:23,020
it is.

232
00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:24,020
Right.

233
00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:25,020
It'll be their first public release.

234
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:26,020
What do you think?

235
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:27,580
Yeah, I think that's fair enough.

236
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:29,660
We're saying three new clones here.

237
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:32,080
So we're not counting Oracle's one and stuff.

238
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:36,200
So that's the tricky thing is I'm wondering what qualifies or not.

239
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:44,100
And I'm thinking it's three rocky rocky Linux or what a rocky OS that would count.

240
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:47,820
But I'm like a restart of scientific Linux I think would count.

241
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:52,260
But I don't think cloud Linux counts or Oracle because they've already been shipping for

242
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:53,780
a while now.

243
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:55,100
So I'm saying three clones.

244
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:59,020
OK, so some at least seems like some new clones would need to be well one new clone by my

245
00:10:59,020 --> 00:11:00,020
count at the moment.

246
00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:01,780
But I'm not, you know, somewhere in the mix.

247
00:11:01,780 --> 00:11:06,860
The thing is, the reason why I think this is a little tiny bit risky is these are supposed

248
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:08,380
to be enterprise distros.

249
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:14,640
And so going slow and getting it just right is sort of in their nature.

250
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:19,140
And so it may be too aggressive of a window to say maybe they don't actually ship something

251
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:20,820
until 2022.

252
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:26,460
Maybe they don't actually even ship something until I don't I don't know, December.

253
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:28,060
I mean, that would be my idea.

254
00:11:28,060 --> 00:11:31,820
Here's where my background on this was is they got to get something shipped by December,

255
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:32,820
right?

256
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:38,360
Because in December, the end of December 2021, that's when traditional CentOS upgrades, updates

257
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:39,360
go away.

258
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:42,900
That's when support dies for CentOS as people knew it.

259
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:45,740
And people either need to switch to stream, which I think is what the majority of people

260
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:50,140
will need to do, or they'll have to come to some sort of decision where they do one of

261
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:54,480
these conversion scripts and convert to some fly-by-night distro.

262
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,040
But I think that's your target.

263
00:11:56,040 --> 00:12:00,020
If you miss that December window, you're going to miss the majority of the market, right?

264
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:02,720
That's when you need to be ready with something that people could, in theory, actually switch

265
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:03,720
to.

266
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:07,600
And that's my prediction is that three of them will be at their production-ready state

267
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:08,600
by then.

268
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:11,680
By this time next year, basically.

269
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:12,680
Right now as we're recording.

270
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:13,680
Interesting.

271
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:14,680
All right.

272
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:15,680
What's your next one then, Wes?

273
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:18,980
Well, I suppose I'm keeping in the theme of maybe not that likely.

274
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:21,040
I'm doing it anyway.

275
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:24,040
Ubuntu ships Systemd HomeD.

276
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:26,600
Now not Fedora, but Ubuntu here?

277
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:29,040
Well, Fedora felt almost too certain.

278
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,040
That's just going to happen, right?

279
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:32,400
At some point, it's going to end up in a Fedora release.

280
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:34,000
Maybe not the default, but there.

281
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:39,520
So I think maybe by the next, what, the one in 2104, Systemd HomeD will be available.

282
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:42,000
You can try it out pretty easily on Ubuntu.

283
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:46,800
And then by the fall 2110, it'll be online by default.

284
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:47,800
That's what I'm predicting.

285
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:50,400
Now, it might not be that they've engaged all the features.

286
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:54,520
It doesn't have to use all of it or radically change, but just that it's there and it's

287
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:58,040
running by default in a regular Ubuntu desktop install.

288
00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:03,400
So could we say the key qualifier is if the user account exists when the home folder exists,

289
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:04,880
that's using Systemd HomeD?

290
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:05,880
Yeah.

291
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:09,040
And you've got that part of the distribution of Systemd installed.

292
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:10,040
Okay.

293
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:11,040
Just installed?

294
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,040
Yeah.

295
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:13,520
Installed and configured on the system by default.

296
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:14,520
Okay.

297
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:15,520
Hmm.

298
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:16,520
Hmm.

299
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:17,520
Yeah.

300
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:22,120
So if I were canonical, maybe I'd want to claim a little recognition for being willing

301
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:23,780
to do a little more cutting edge.

302
00:13:23,780 --> 00:13:27,800
And so maybe this is something they'd seriously look into and maybe try to figure out if it's

303
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:30,000
shippable before they do the LTS.

304
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
That's exactly right.

305
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
That would be the time.

306
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,120
Get it in there before the 2204 LTS that's coming up.

307
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,120
Yeah.

308
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:37,120
And they could always pull it.

309
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:42,860
They could put it in 2110 and then if it doesn't work out, pull it and go back to regular home

310
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:44,360
directory for 2204.

311
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:45,360
Yeah.

312
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:46,360
Yeah.

313
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:47,880
I like this one, actually.

314
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:48,880
I would like to see it.

315
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:51,880
It's neat and I'd like to do a little more playing with Systemd HomeD, honestly.

316
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:54,680
I'm going to save an Ubuntu prediction for Linux Unplugged.

317
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:56,640
I got one that I'm setting aside.

318
00:13:56,640 --> 00:14:01,440
I feel like I'm going to save it because I want you to have that space in this.

319
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:04,520
So you'll be the one making the Ubuntu prediction in this episode.

320
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:05,920
So what's your other one then, Chris?

321
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:06,920
All right.

322
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:12,920
This next one, this one could screw me like the Nouveau driver did because this is one

323
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:14,800
where I'm reading all the tea leaves.

324
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:19,640
I'm seeing all of the activity leading up to this year.

325
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:27,760
And I think, I predict the BcashFS will be mainlined in 2021.

326
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:33,320
I would really like to see this, a nice high-performance file system, fantastic for NVMe drives and

327
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:34,640
workstations.

328
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:38,040
You know, when you don't need everything that ButterFS or ZFS can do, but you still want

329
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:44,380
a modern high-performance, really awesome, well-designed file system, BcashFS.

330
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:45,960
And it's getting there.

331
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:47,600
It's getting there.

332
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:52,600
But like so many things, that final getting it over the final hump to get it in the kernel

333
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,920
can just take forever, like we saw with WireGuard.

334
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:55,920
Yes.

335
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:58,200
I mean, there's a high bar of entry for the kernel and rightfully so.

336
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:59,200
Yeah.

337
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:03,280
And they've just did another round of reviews for inclusion in October.

338
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:10,000
And it's looking like it's on a good trajectory, but it's by far, it's not a sure thing yet.

339
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
It's not a sure bet yet.

340
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,600
I'm almost glad of that, honestly, because with file system development, we don't need

341
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:15,600
that to be rushed.

342
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:19,240
Like just take the time, get it right, because I think once it is in the kernel, assuming

343
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:22,480
it makes it there, that's when people will actually really start trying it out.

344
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:25,480
You're not going to compile a module of a file system that you might use that you don't

345
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:27,000
know and isn't trusted.

346
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:31,040
But once it's blessed and actually available by default, yeah, all right, I'm switching.

347
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:36,480
There are still, as Kent Overstreet puts it, the main developer, a few bugs remaining,

348
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:42,000
including, quote, kernel oopses with Zstandard compression, some of the erasure code not

349
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:47,040
being quite stable, but pretty much everything else, replication, compression, checksumming,

350
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:49,720
encryption, all looking really solid.

351
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:58,040
And another good sign that's helping get BcacheFS over the inclusion hump is a veteran file

352
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:03,240
system developer, Dave Chyner, has jumped in to help with testing Bcache.

353
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:08,320
And he's even found a couple of things by throwing it through a dual socket motherboard,

354
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:12,400
which looks at some of these checksums and does a little bit of different behavior than

355
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:13,540
everything on one chip.

356
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:18,800
And he actually uncovered some scalability issues where BcacheFS wasn't quite staying

357
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:22,960
up to snuff to say something like XFS is currently doing.

358
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:24,320
And they're working on those things.

359
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:28,080
And I think probably by summer, they're going to have all that stuff wrapped up.

360
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:29,080
So I don't know.

361
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:30,080
I don't know, Wes.

362
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:31,080
We'll see.

363
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:32,080
I don't know if it's going to get included then.

364
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:36,760
But I think by the time we're recording next year, this kind of episode, I really hope

365
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:39,080
to see BcacheFS in the mainline kernel.

366
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:43,040
It may not be shipping in distros yet, but it's going to be upstream.

367
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:44,240
It's going to be mainlined.

368
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:50,960
My next question then is how long after it gets mainlined before we've switched the studio?

369
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:54,520
Linux.ting.com is the next generation of Ting Mobile and it's here.

370
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:59,260
I've been a customer for over eight years and I can tell you there has never been a

371
00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:01,440
better time to try out Ting.

372
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:05,240
And when you go to linux.ting.com, you get $25 off.

373
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:07,240
It's now the smarter choice for everybody.

374
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:10,980
They have unlimited data plans at $45 a month.

375
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:15,360
Whether you need two gigs or 20 gigs, whatever it might be, there's a perfect Ting plan for

376
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:16,360
you now.

377
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:18,300
And they've made some big improvements there.

378
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:20,300
But no need to worry because that's really it.

379
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:23,160
The only thing that's changed is just lower monthly phone bills.

380
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:27,660
You still get access to Ting's award-winning customer service and nationwide LT and 5G.

381
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:29,020
And you know what else?

382
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:30,300
No contracts.

383
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:31,300
No contracts.

384
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:32,600
No contracts ever.

385
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:37,940
And now Ting Mobile customers can choose from three different plans based on your data needs.

386
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:41,560
And you'd be impressed with how much you can get done through the Ting interface.

387
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:44,760
The dashboard takes care of just about everything you'd ever need.

388
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:48,280
I don't understand why the rest of the industry doesn't catch up to where Ting's at.

389
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:51,120
I mean I'm talking about even like porting over and bringing a new device.

390
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:52,920
You can do it all through the website.

391
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:55,400
And pretty much any phone will work with Ting.

392
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:58,740
So just head to linux.ting.com to check your current phone.

393
00:17:58,740 --> 00:17:59,740
You create an account.

394
00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:01,560
You pick the plan that's right for you.

395
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:05,420
And then like magic, Elves will send you a SIM card that you pop into your phone and

396
00:18:05,420 --> 00:18:08,660
you can activate and you're going in just a few minutes.

397
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:12,920
And one of the brilliant things about Ting is there's multiple carriers you can choose

398
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:15,900
from depending on how it works best in your area.

399
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:19,360
And that also means that if you need to be mobile or you need multiple different carriers

400
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:23,840
or maybe you need to move, you can always pick and choose what's going to work best

401
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:25,460
for you.

402
00:18:25,460 --> 00:18:27,940
So go see what it's like to cut your phone bill in half.

403
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:29,940
It's never been easier with Ting.

404
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:32,700
So get started by going to linux.ting.com.

405
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:34,480
This is the next generation of Ting mobile.

406
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:37,320
It's here and I'm really impressed with what they've managed to do.

407
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:43,960
And you can get $25 off when you go to linux.ting.com.

408
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:48,320
Well it wouldn't be a Linux action news predictions episode without some Bitcoin talk.

409
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:50,920
And boy howdy with all the news this week.

410
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:51,920
It's more relevant than ever.

411
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:56,600
Yeah, it's already dropped about $800 since we started recording.

412
00:18:56,600 --> 00:19:00,280
Yeah, oh boy.

413
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:01,660
This is a tricky one.

414
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:05,040
So why don't we review what we said would happen and then we're going to talk about

415
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:10,160
if we can even predict the future because I think that's a conversation in itself.

416
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:15,240
Joe, you said that it would get to $19,000 as a high.

417
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:16,880
I said $22,000.

418
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:20,600
It actually got as high as $24,000.

419
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:24,840
And it's possible that it could go even higher by the end of the year after we've recorded

420
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:25,840
this.

421
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:26,840
That's absolutely true.

422
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:30,880
For the low end, you predicted it would go as low as $4k.

423
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:32,560
I predicted $5k.

424
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:36,720
And it looks like that's about where it was, was $5k, somewhere around there for the 2020

425
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:37,720
low.

426
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:38,720
Wow.

427
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:39,960
Yeah, around March time, it got to about there.

428
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:41,440
So you were pretty spot on there.

429
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:42,440
I was close though.

430
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:47,040
Boy, that, right now looking back at $5,000, that seems like quite a deal.

431
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:48,680
You know, because you don't have to buy a full Bitcoin.

432
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:50,280
You just buy however much you can afford.

433
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:52,480
Yeah, get like a couple hundred bucks worth of Bitcoin.

434
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:57,080
Back then it was $5,000 and that would have paid off right now at this point in time.

435
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:58,760
Not any kind of advice, of course.

436
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:03,960
I'm just looking at that thinking maybe I should have done something there.

437
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:06,600
Then we said, okay, here's what it's going to be on December 1st, 2020.

438
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:08,480
Joe, you said it'd be $7k.

439
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:10,620
I said it'd be $14k.

440
00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:13,240
It actually turned out to be around $19k.

441
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:15,280
So much higher than either one of us were thinking.

442
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:18,800
And I thought I was going a little high because I thought if the low was $5k and I said it's

443
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:21,040
going to get all the way up to $14k, I was like, well, that's pretty big growth.

444
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:22,040
Right.

445
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:23,920
Is it big growth or is it more of a sustained?

446
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:24,920
Yeah.

447
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:28,160
Well, I listened back to that predictions episode and what I was talking about was wanting

448
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:29,160
stability.

449
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:32,680
I didn't want it to have this massive high.

450
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:38,400
I thought that if it dropped to about four or five and then crept its way up to seven,

451
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:41,800
seven and a half, that's what I would want to happen.

452
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:46,400
I want just slow and steady growth, not this crazy up and down.

453
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:53,400
But here we are talking about it at $23,000, $24,000, having beaten last year's record

454
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:58,680
and crucially that $20,000 barrier because it came close earlier in the year to $20,000

455
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:00,700
and just didn't quite make it.

456
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:03,540
And that's a psychological barrier to people.

457
00:21:03,540 --> 00:21:06,800
And I kind of didn't want it to break that yet.

458
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:13,960
I wanted it to have a sustained period of being around about $20,000 and then for it

459
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:18,000
to break through and then start climbing.

460
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:24,040
The volatility is going to be its undoing and ultimately will be the undoing of its

461
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:25,580
value, I think.

462
00:21:25,580 --> 00:21:31,180
It's hard to say because I don't really know how to really predict a currency that has

463
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:38,320
a limited supply and because people are losing their coins and their wallets.

464
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:42,440
There's always less and less bitcoins and there will only be a finite amount ever made.

465
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:46,400
So while new ones are getting mined, there's also ones that are getting lost and there's

466
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:47,400
a limit on that.

467
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:51,560
So I do wonder if that doesn't play strange things with the value as well.

468
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:52,560
Yeah.

469
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:56,200
I mean, it seems like it's ripe for speculation and people are happy to do that.

470
00:21:56,200 --> 00:22:01,200
And what we noticed is it just took off again like a rocket.

471
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:06,520
It was bouncing around, bouncing around and then boom, $19,000, tipped to $20,000, came

472
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:12,320
down a bit and then bam, all the way up to $24,000 as of this morning.

473
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:17,920
And as we record, it's $23,799.80.

474
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:20,960
Not that I'm checking, but it's still, it's crazy.

475
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:21,960
It's still crazy.

476
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:28,600
But I have noticed a huge shift in how many normals know about Bitcoin.

477
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:31,240
Everyone in my family knows that Bitcoin is a thing.

478
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:33,160
They might not understand it.

479
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:38,940
But there was, I think, a large adoption of Coinbase and then the Cash App made it really

480
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:39,940
easy to buy Bitcoin.

481
00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:40,940
Right.

482
00:22:40,940 --> 00:22:44,280
It's in the hands of folks, so you might not understand anything about how digital wallets

483
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:48,360
work or blockchain, but hey, here's something you can buy.

484
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:53,280
I had the Cash App set up already so I could, you know, hey, here's my half a lunch or whatever.

485
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:57,020
Like I've used it, I've used it for all kinds of like quick little ways to send money.

486
00:22:57,020 --> 00:22:58,580
So I had everything plumbed already.

487
00:22:58,580 --> 00:23:03,120
And when they rolled out Bitcoin support, it was just a button on my phone now to buy

488
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:04,120
some Bitcoin.

489
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:08,360
I actually haven't used it, but I bet a lot of other people have and you're sitting there,

490
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:12,000
you're watching this thing go up, you buy a little bit of it.

491
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:16,240
And I think making it easier every step of the way has accelerated adoption and made

492
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:19,840
it understandable to some degree by the normals.

493
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:24,880
I told this story on air before, but I actually got a telegram from my mom about a month ago

494
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:30,060
asking me what I thought about investing in Bitcoin and talking to me about Bitcoin.

495
00:23:30,060 --> 00:23:34,360
My mom, who I've never had a conversation with about Bitcoin before, she found it on

496
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:40,240
her own and I mean, that really to me was a sign that I kind of feel like I feel like

497
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:41,460
it's impossible to predict.

498
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:45,800
But I think it's I think this year it's stuck.

499
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:46,800
It's here now.

500
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:48,000
It's sticking around.

501
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:53,180
I think people who actually speculate on commodities like gold and silver are now keeping.

502
00:23:53,180 --> 00:23:56,360
I mean, I hear this all the time on the economics YouTube channels I watch.

503
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:59,320
Oh, I have about five percent of my portfolio in crypto.

504
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:01,800
It's just a new way to diversify your account.

505
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:05,140
Doesn't seem like we're really using it to actually buy that many products or services

506
00:24:05,140 --> 00:24:06,140
these days.

507
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:07,560
At least I haven't seen that much of it.

508
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:08,900
I mean, there's some, right?

509
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:09,900
It still exists.

510
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:13,880
But yeah, it seems now more it's a new investment vehicle side hustle.

511
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:16,020
So how do you predict something like this?

512
00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:17,360
Can you predict something?

513
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:19,840
You make wild guesses and see what sticks.

514
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:23,600
Because if you look at the volatility we just saw in the last couple of months, we could

515
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:28,600
stay this exact price all year long and then in November it could jump up to forty thousand.

516
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:30,140
I mean, it's just it's wild.

517
00:24:30,140 --> 00:24:33,760
But I do think once twenty thousand was crossed.

518
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:37,840
Because I think every time what you're doing is you're setting a new expectation of what

519
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:40,920
Bitcoin's value is because it's all made up anyway.

520
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:41,920
Right.

521
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:44,320
And once you get used to that idea, then you're more comfortable paying that for it.

522
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:46,020
And that's part of how that gets established.

523
00:24:46,020 --> 00:24:49,620
And the longer it stays at these higher prices, the more that becomes the new floor.

524
00:24:49,620 --> 00:24:52,720
Like it just never goes below a certain amount now.

525
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:57,180
And it ultimately ends up higher than where it, you know, so when it crashes, it usually

526
00:24:57,180 --> 00:24:59,800
rebounds over time higher than when it originally crashed.

527
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:05,680
So I can't make a prediction here, but I feel like we're going to look back at twenty four

528
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:06,680
thousand.

529
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:07,680
I think it was quaint.

530
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:10,400
I guess you're telling us to buy.

531
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:14,640
I just think it's reached that point where it's not going away.

532
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:18,320
It's nature, the block chain, the fact that it's open source, the fact that there's all

533
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:20,980
these applications being built on top of it.

534
00:25:20,980 --> 00:25:25,480
And now that it's so commonly known, it's becoming easier and more accessible for the

535
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:26,480
normals.

536
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:33,040
Yeah, I think it's unless unless a government like the size of the United States just decided

537
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:34,760
to try to shut it down as much as possible.

538
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:35,760
It's not going away.

539
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:37,040
You're right.

540
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:40,600
People aren't buying goods with it, but a lot of people are also storing silver.

541
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:45,080
And you think about when people buy gold and silver, some of them are not even actually

542
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:47,640
they don't actually own the metal, right?

543
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:51,400
They're buying rights to the metal that's stored somewhere else, right?

544
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:52,400
What's the difference?

545
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:56,520
At least one can be cryptographically proven.

546
00:25:56,520 --> 00:26:01,640
Well, I started to get people asking me about this when it was approaching 20,000 again.

547
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:03,040
And should I buy or not?

548
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:08,200
And my advice to anyone would always be only invest what you can afford to lose.

549
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:11,480
And this is a long term investment if you are going to do it.

550
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:19,800
But I said to them, back in late November, early December, if it breaks the 20,000 barrier,

551
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:22,080
then it's going to go to the moon, essentially.

552
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:27,500
If we can break that psychological barrier, which we now have, and we're at 23, 24 ish,

553
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:30,820
I think it's going to go a lot higher over the next year.

554
00:26:30,820 --> 00:26:37,520
So if you've got money to lose and to risk and to bet, essentially, then you could do

555
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:38,520
worse, I think.

556
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:43,240
Well, now that we're all just looking at the ticker, it's time to wrap this episode up.
