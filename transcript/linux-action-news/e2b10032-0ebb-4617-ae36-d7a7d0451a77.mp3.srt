00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,640
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, Episode 224, recorded on January 19th, 2022.

2
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:11,640
I'm Chris.

3
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:12,640
And I'm Wes.

4
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:13,640
Hello, Wes.

5
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:15,200
Let's do the news.

6
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:20,200
And we start with what we might normally report as some good news.

7
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:24,080
That's a surge of activity over at the LVFS project.

8
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:29,600
Unfortunately, this boost in traffic appears to be due to vendors releasing some new firmware

9
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:34,680
updates ahead of disclosing what might be some security fixes.

10
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:38,280
Oh, yeah, Michael Larble over at Ferronix noticed this.

11
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:42,400
And he put together with the fact that last summer, something like this kind of happened

12
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:46,280
right before Dell had to push out a BIOS update.

13
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:48,560
Also kind of giving us a hint that something might be going on.

14
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:54,160
Richard Hughes, who runs the LVFS project, the lead developer, also tweeted that it's

15
00:00:54,160 --> 00:01:00,560
almost like a vendor is shipping updates like crazy for a high security upcoming issue,

16
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:05,640
which I think is him basically saying that's exactly what's happening.

17
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:07,880
Probably a good reminder to patch your hardware, though.

18
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:08,940
Yeah, definitely.

19
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:11,120
There is some good news, though, for the project.

20
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:15,080
The FWAPD component, that's the part that runs on your computer and does the actual

21
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:17,640
updates, saw a new version.

22
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:26,200
Yes, FWAPD 174 adds firmware branch support for modem manager devices, improved patching,

23
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:32,200
and a variety of bug fixes, and of course, support for some new hardware.

24
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:38,480
Some hardware that I'm really happy to see in here, HP's USB-C G2 dock now supported

25
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:46,080
by FWAPD, the ThinkPad Thunderbolt 4 dock now supported, also the QCEL LTE modem also

26
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:47,080
on this list.

27
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:49,200
So that's just some good stuff on here.

28
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:54,160
It is supremely awesome to see these USB docks getting some support and that Thunderbolt

29
00:01:54,160 --> 00:02:00,920
dock because those have upped my work at home game to the next level and getting support

30
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:03,800
right there in my Linux machine to update these.

31
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:07,600
Well, I mean, that's actually going to just determine which ones I buy going forward.

32
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:12,040
I think it was really nice to sort of be included in this round of hardware support.

33
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:16,480
You know, like 10 years ago, I feel like we'd be lucky enough that these might work on Linux

34
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:20,600
at all, let alone any hope of being able to update or work with their firmware.

35
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:24,460
But with some of these docks, it feels like Linux really is a first-class citizen and

36
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:27,560
updates like these are key to making that happen.

37
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:31,840
Well, moving up the stack a bit, GNOME 42's Alpha is out.

38
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:37,160
This is a big one because Libidwadia ships in this, and it's also a transition from my

39
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:44,300
tried and my true love, gedit, to the new modern GNOME text editor that has been developed

40
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:47,540
by the same developer who built GNOME Builder.

41
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:49,240
So I have some high hopes for it.

42
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:53,280
But there's also just a lot of technology under the hood, some transitions happening

43
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,280
with this one.

44
00:02:54,280 --> 00:03:01,760
Yeah, Libidwadia is here, and GNOME 42 will be depending on it in more than a couple ways.

45
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:05,400
Sure, apps and modules are migrating over there.

46
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:08,320
That's going to continue the next few cycles, I expect.

47
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:13,840
But this time around, the GNOME desktop module now works with GTK4, and the internals have

48
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,760
been split out into three libraries.

49
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:20,880
It might not sound like much, but I think this is the release you can tell that GNOME's

50
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:25,160
getting serious about GTK4 and the next evolution of the desktop.

51
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:30,880
Yeah, and you have to figure getting the GNOME desktop module itself to build against GTK4

52
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:35,520
and all of the work that went into that was a huge amount of effort just for this release

53
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:36,520
alone.

54
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:42,600
This really does feel like the release where GTK4 is finally getting taken advantage of,

55
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:46,080
and you're really seeing things make the transition.

56
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:51,800
And with GTK4, you get a lot of niceties, some GPU acceleration, things look a little

57
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:52,800
nicer.

58
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:56,800
I mean, there's a lot happening here with this release simply because of the embracement

59
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:57,800
of GTK4.

60
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:02,920
Now, this is an alpha phase, so you kind of have to be a diehard to go try it at this

61
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:04,240
point in time.

62
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:08,800
But if you wait, there will be another release scheduled for mid-February, and then the final

63
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:17,520
release of GNOME 42 Desktop Environment is expected on March 23, 2022.

64
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:21,560
Well the cat is out of the bag, so to speak.

65
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:27,440
SUSE formally announced today that they've got a new support offering targeted at mixed

66
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:30,800
Linux environments within the enterprise.

67
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:33,920
They've named it SUSE Liberty Linux.

68
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:36,160
No, it's not a distro.

69
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:43,800
It's a little bit more dialed back than that, but it is a mixed environment enterprise offering.

70
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:49,560
So if you have some virtual machines that have SUSE and CentOS, as they put it, they

71
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:54,160
would be happy to sell you a support package that helps cover all of them.

72
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:59,480
They write in the announcement, SUSE Liberty Linux is a new technology and support offering

73
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:04,240
that provides customers a unified support experience for managing their heterogeneous

74
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,240
IT environments.

75
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:11,920
With SUSE Liberty Linux, you get trusted support with optional proven management tools that

76
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:18,200
are optimized for mixed Linux environments, including Red Hat Enterprise Linux, CentOS,

77
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:23,600
and as you would expect, OpenSUSE and SUSE Linux Enterprise Server.

78
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:28,280
Now I happened to go on the website to go buy it, but as of this recording, it was just

79
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:31,720
announced today, you can actually buy it on their online store.

80
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:35,360
So I guess you got to call in and talk to a salesperson.

81
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:37,720
Something tells me you might not be doing that.

82
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:43,800
Now we were going off of some repository statistics that showed us that at one point, there was

83
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:48,160
a CentOS clone out there identifying itself as SUSE Liberty Server.

84
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:55,620
And one has to wonder if at one point, SUSE Liberty Linux was going to also include a

85
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:58,760
Linux distribution and not just a support service.

86
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:04,120
It doesn't seem impossible, or did they just get a little overzealous in how they configured

87
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:07,160
things with their new daemon on top?

88
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:12,480
Perhaps the sales department said, excuse us, how are we going to sell SUSE Enterprise

89
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:18,720
Server for $5,000 for a couple of VMs if you're giving away a CentOS clone?

90
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:23,680
It's probably the same exact conversation the Red Hat sales team had when they decided

91
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,720
they needed to change the way CentOS worked.

92
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:27,680
I mean, let's be real here.

93
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:32,160
They would have undermined their own sales with SUSE Liberty Linux.

94
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:36,720
And so they still have a lot of the infrastructure in place because they have to build these

95
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:37,720
patches.

96
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:41,480
They have to pull down these source RPMs from Red Hat, and they have to rebuild them and

97
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:43,040
put them in their pipeline.

98
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:46,680
So they still need the majority of the tooling they would have needed for their own distribution,

99
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:51,000
but they don't undermine their brand and their primary server distribution.

100
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,160
Oh, count me still a little disappointed.

101
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:56,240
It would have been a great laugh.

102
00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:01,000
Also speaking of things that have been in the works for a little while, Wine 7.0 released

103
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:07,040
after a year's worth of developments and over 9,000 changes.

104
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:12,700
There's a lot in here, but one major improvement we've all been waiting for for a long time.

105
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:13,700
That's right.

106
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:20,400
It's WOW64, also known as the 64-bit Windows on Windows architecture.

107
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:26,600
And Wine now has an implementation that supports running a 32-bit Windows application inside

108
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:30,120
a 64-bit Unix host process.

109
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:36,480
WOW64 support has also been added to most Unix libraries with Wine 7.0, which means

110
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:41,960
a 32-bit PE module can call back to a 64-bit Unix library.

111
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:47,920
And then once the remaining modules are converted to the PE format, this should make it possible

112
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:54,560
to run 32-bit applications without having to install 32-bit Unix libraries.

113
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,720
That is really kind of a big deal.

114
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:01,560
They've also updated the VKD 3D support in this.

115
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:05,800
There's been support for multiple displays improved with a few caveats, we'll have a

116
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:12,300
link in the show notes for, as well as some updates to various Direct3D 10 and 11 features.

117
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:16,080
So this is a major one and it's out now and it's fresh.

118
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:18,880
I guess fresh wine in this case is actually a good thing.

119
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:23,040
That's right, we're even using it to record this very episode.

120
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:29,640
Yeah fair enough, a few of our favorite plugins run in our favorite editor using Wine.

121
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:35,000
And like a dope, I decided to upgrade right before the show and it worked out just fine.

122
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,480
Of course it did, come on, you didn't have faith.

123
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:41,400
I must have, I mean I hit yes to the upgrade.

124
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:46,800
You know, all joking aside, this is a really impressive release and besides the specifics

125
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:53,200
of that WoW 64 support, there's just been a ton of work to get all of these wine libraries

126
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:56,000
working and building in the PE format.

127
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,440
I think at first I didn't fully appreciate exactly why switching the format that, you

128
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:02,880
know, just the format of the libraries, there's details around that but it's not like everything's

129
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:05,000
getting rewritten here.

130
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:09,160
But I think that WoW 64 architecture support, some of these improvements packaged up in

131
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:14,720
7 are showing that all that work is having some pretty neat downstream effects that we're

132
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,680
already seeing the benefit of.

133
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:22,680
Okay, while we're kind of talking about graphics, I think it's probably worth mentioning that

134
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:27,560
a former Intel driver that was responsible for the Vulkan driver over there left a little

135
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:32,880
while ago and now it appears that they're maybe you could say at Greener Pastures.

136
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:37,880
We're talking about Jason Ekstrand who up until recently has been the lead developer

137
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:43,720
of Intel's open source ANV Vulkan Linux driver.

138
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:49,520
Now Jason left Intel back in December but just recently revealed some new details about

139
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:51,920
where he'll be working next.

140
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:57,120
Over the years working at Intel, Jason managed to become one of the top five contributors

141
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:01,800
to Mesa, even though he's really only been working on the Linux graphics stack since

142
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:04,360
around 2013.

143
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:09,720
That meant that when he announced he was leaving Intel and hadn't announced where he was going,

144
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:14,600
some were a bit concerned because, I mean, he contributes a lot to the stuff we all take

145
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:16,400
for granted on our desktop.

146
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:17,400
We held our breath.

147
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:19,240
We're like, okay, let's watch.

148
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:24,920
And now we know Jason took to his blog and he wrote that in my new role at Collabra,

149
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:31,640
my mandate consists of two things, invest and mentor the Collabra 3D graphics team and

150
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:36,160
invest in upstream Linux in the open source graphic driver, however I see fit.

151
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:41,680
Yeah, he doubled down on that saying, as far as I'm concerned, when it comes to how I spend

152
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:46,880
my engineering effort, I now report directly to upstream.

153
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:50,840
That's exciting for a few reasons, some of which he mentions further on his blog, but

154
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:56,600
things like not being tied to any driver or particular hardware vendor.

155
00:10:56,600 --> 00:11:00,400
Jason also seemed to be looking forward to be able to help out his new coworker, Alyssa

156
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:07,280
Rosenzweig, who you might know for her work on Asahi Linux and the GPU support over there.

157
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:12,720
It's also just fascinating to watch the continued developments over at Collabra and the sort

158
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:17,800
of unique arrangement here where Jason won't be expected to do any contract work.

159
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:22,780
I mean, sure, he's obviously helping and training the folks at Collabra, but it's clear they

160
00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:29,920
understand that investing in the ecosystem really benefits them as well.

161
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:44,280
Linode has some really great offerings.

162
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:47,760
First of all, they have 11 data centers around the world for you to choose from.

163
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:54,280
They're 30 to 50% less than the big hyperscalers out there, and those big hyperscaler vendors,

164
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:56,080
they're really going to try to pitch you.

165
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:58,760
They'll sell themselves as a one-stop shop.

166
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:04,200
All you need is offered here, they'll tell you, but really that's vendor lock-in, and

167
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:08,720
you'll get so deeply entwined into that vendor's ecosystem that it becomes nearly impossible

168
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:12,320
or at least cost prohibitive to get out.

169
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:14,640
Linode can be part of a multi-cloud strategy.

170
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:17,500
Go try it out with that $100 and try it.

171
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:20,300
Everybody's talking about multi-cloud these days.

172
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:21,300
There's a reason for it.

173
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:24,480
And when you look at the pricing of Linode, you look at what they offer and their services

174
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:29,160
like their S3-compatible object storage, or their Kubernetes management.

175
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:33,000
So if you've already got some infrastructure management in place, Linode can work with

176
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
that.

177
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,640
They got VLAN support, DDoS protection, cloud firewalls, and bare metal servers rolling

178
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:39,080
out as well.

179
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:41,380
And I think one of my favorite things is just the speed.

180
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:44,540
They have very fast CPUs, they've got MVME storage.

181
00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:49,700
It's such a great service, backed by the best customer support in the business.

182
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:52,240
So go try them out and support the show.

183
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:57,100
It's a great way to keep Linux action news going every single week.

184
00:12:57,100 --> 00:13:00,860
Try something out and learn something yourself and support a company that's been pretty great

185
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:06,640
to the community, linode.com slash lan.

186
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:11,060
And a tremendous thank you to Ting, linux.ting.com.

187
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:14,320
If you're sick of overpaying for your cell service and you're ready to save some money,

188
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:20,200
go to linux.ting.com and then take 25 bucks off of that, linux.ting.com.

189
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:22,720
Ting is a mobile virtual network operator.

190
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:26,640
That means that Ting customers get access to the big carrier networks, but with way

191
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:30,040
better customer service and at a lower cost.

192
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:32,880
Ting manages multiple networks.

193
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:36,720
So when you go to their website, they can determine the best coverage in your area and

194
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:39,560
within minutes you'll be set and they'll be sending you a SIM card.

195
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:43,220
And you know, Ting Mobile was recently named the number one carrier by Consumer Reports

196
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:44,620
in 2021.

197
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:46,100
How fantastic is that?

198
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:48,880
And that's not the first time Ting has won accolades like that.

199
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:54,400
That's a reason why, and many more, why I've been a customer since 2000 and frickin' 13.

200
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:56,520
Ting Mobile is just simply smarter.

201
00:13:56,520 --> 00:14:01,480
They've got great flexible plans, plans with unlimited talk and unlimited text, and every

202
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:07,940
plan gets access to Ting's award-winning customer service with nationwide LTE and 5G coverage.

203
00:14:07,940 --> 00:14:09,500
And the best part?

204
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:10,960
No contracts ever.

205
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:13,800
It's super simple to switch to Ting, so just go try it out.

206
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:16,960
Pretty much any phone will work because they got multiple networks they support.

207
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:20,840
Linux.ting.com, check your current phone, you create an account, you pick the plan that's

208
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:22,200
right for you.

209
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:25,880
Ting's gonna send you a SIM card, you're gonna pop that in, you're gonna get activated in

210
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:28,680
minutes, and you're saving money.

211
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:29,680
It's that easy.

212
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:34,700
Cutting your phone bill in half has never been easier with Ting's great new plans.

213
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:40,920
Check them out, Linux.ting.com.

214
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:41,920
Watch out!

215
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:47,000
Last week, we learned about an interesting and perhaps dangerous new vulnerability in

216
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,280
our dear Linux kernel.

217
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:55,400
It's a heap-based buffer overflow flaw that was found in the file system context functionality,

218
00:14:55,400 --> 00:15:00,160
specifically how one of its legacy functions verified the length of one of its supplied

219
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:02,040
parameters.

220
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:08,080
This ultimately means that, with the right exploit, an unprivileged local user was able

221
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:12,720
to open a file system that didn't support the fancy new file system context API and

222
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:17,880
thus needed to use the legacy stuff could escalate their privileges to root.

223
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:25,320
Sadly, this bug was introduced way back in 5.1rc1 and is present in all Linux kernel

224
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:27,280
releases since.

225
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:33,520
That means all supported releases of Ubuntu and Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.4 GA and onwards.

226
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:38,600
Yeah, 5.1's been around for a while, so get to patching, everybody.

227
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:43,160
And while we're kind of talking about kernel stuff here, we now have learned that Ubuntu

228
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:50,080
2204, that's the next LTS that comes out in April, it will ship with Linux 5.15.

229
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:52,160
Now that makes sense.

230
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:57,320
Linux 5.15 is a long-term support kernel, so you'd probably want that in your long-term

231
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:59,060
support distro.

232
00:15:59,060 --> 00:16:02,520
But it is a little unfortunate as far as timing goes.

233
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:09,120
You see, Linux 5.16 came out last week, and by the time 2204 ships, well, yes, even Linux

234
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:10,960
5.17 will be out.

235
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:15,840
And unfortunately, even in just 5.16, there's some major nice-to-haves that would be great

236
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:18,360
in a distribution that's going to be around for a while.

237
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:23,300
Like for example, in Linux 5.16, we get Alder Lake S Graphics enabled.

238
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:29,480
We also get the much talked about Futex system call support that'll be necessary for future

239
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:31,720
Wine and Steam Play gaming.

240
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:36,440
Also those IO optimizations we talked about on the show before, yep, those are also in

241
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:37,440
5.16.

242
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:38,440
I know.

243
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:45,160
And then this one, Wes, this one stings a lot, AMD Ryzen 6000 mobile support.

244
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:46,160
That would have been nice.

245
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:51,800
Yeah, now there are PPAs available that you can get from Canonical to install a newer

246
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:55,160
kernel on an older version of Ubuntu.

247
00:16:55,160 --> 00:17:01,000
But I don't think this has satisfied consumers.

248
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:06,440
We are seeing a drainage of Ubuntu users in the Steam stats.

249
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:12,200
Yeah, I mean, Ubuntu used to be kind of dominant, right?

250
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:13,200
The king.

251
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:18,160
That's the default go-to distro for so many people for so long now.

252
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:23,320
I mean, you might recall the original Steam runtime was based on an old version of Ubuntu.

253
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:29,640
So if you wanted the ideal Steam gaming setup, you used Ubuntu.

254
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:31,240
That's just not the case anymore.

255
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:34,560
No, it seems it's an Arch world now.

256
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:41,160
I mean, if you take a look at some of the ProtonDB stats as Boiling Steam has done,

257
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:47,400
you'll see that Arch Linux has gained progressively and seems to now be at a solid 20% for the

258
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:48,640
last few months.

259
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:55,420
Yeah, and Manjaro itself is almost as large as regular Arch, but Garuda is in those stats

260
00:17:55,420 --> 00:18:00,040
and DevROS is in there, and a lot of it seems at the expense of Ubuntu.

261
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:05,760
Yeah, I mean, that adds up to basically half of the gamers on ProtonDB using some kind

262
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:06,760
of Arch.

263
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:10,600
Yeah, and that's just like an undeniable number.

264
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:11,920
You can't ignore it.

265
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:13,960
And there is room for non-Arch distros.

266
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:16,300
PopOS has done pretty well in there.

267
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:20,840
So it really seems to be answering the needs of that particular niche.

268
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:23,480
I mean, I was trying to think about this.

269
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:25,100
What is it about Linux gamers?

270
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:26,880
What's driving them to use Arch?

271
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,760
It's got to be software, right?

272
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:30,640
It's got to be fresh software.

273
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:35,040
You may have a little more willingness to engage with getting things right, putting

274
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:38,540
in some effort to make your gameplay the best that it can be.

275
00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:44,000
So you might be willing to tinker a bit more than the average Linux user, but you're right.

276
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:48,820
I mean, that's what's appealing about Arch is you've got the latest and greatest stuff.

277
00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:52,320
You basically have no hurdles in your way to customizing the system to try to eke out

278
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:54,760
as much performance as possible.

279
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:57,720
And the Arch wiki has a lot of great tips for helping you do so.

280
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:58,720
Yeah.

281
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:03,720
And when you have Manjaro and Garuda and Endeavor that are doing some of the heavy lifting for

282
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:09,920
you, it makes getting access to a distro that gives you the freshest drivers and not just

283
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:13,480
the ones that are in the kernel, but Nvidia drivers and things like that.

284
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:18,180
And it gives you ways to like, one of the things that's really nice on Arch is you could

285
00:19:18,180 --> 00:19:23,400
easily have a launcher that chooses between the Steam runtime or the native libraries

286
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:24,400
on your system.

287
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:28,040
And they've just done a lot of that kind of stuff.

288
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:29,840
But actually, I think it's bigger than that, Wes.

289
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:35,400
I mean, I think definitely with gamers, there's a serious use case for newer software.

290
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:41,240
But I myself have chose Fedora because of their kernel update policy.

291
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:45,000
At least one of the reasons is because of Fedora's kernel update policy.

292
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:48,360
And I like Tumbleweed because I get a fresh kernel.

293
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:55,440
And so I wonder for you, where you kind of use your workstation in probably more of a

294
00:19:55,440 --> 00:20:00,560
development workstation mode than like pushing the hardware, do you find that you're drawn

295
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:02,680
to a distribution with newer kernels?

296
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:06,920
Or are you fine on a system that uses a kernel from a few years ago?

297
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:09,040
Because everything you've got on that box is supported.

298
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:11,000
See, it's tough.

299
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,840
Okay, there's the hat that I have on where I'm the enthusiast.

300
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:15,520
And yeah, I want the latest kernel.

301
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:16,800
I want to try some of the features.

302
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:19,280
Plus, I mean, we talk about them on the show.

303
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:24,000
So I know all the neat stuff that they have, and then I just feel like I'm missing out.

304
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Colonel FOMO.

305
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Yeah, exactly.

306
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,320
It's real.

307
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:31,000
But on the other hand, yeah, I think a few releases behind.

308
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:36,240
So you know, if I was running 5.15 and 5.17 out, and aside from the gaming stuff, I don't

309
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:37,440
think I'd notice.

310
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:40,440
But you go much longer than that.

311
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:44,400
And yeah, I think I do, especially when, you know, when some of the container technology

312
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:48,400
underneath changes, when there's changes to maybe the stuff you can do with firewalls,

313
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:53,120
when there are major performance changes or new file system features or improvements.

314
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:55,000
I think that stuff does matter.

315
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,760
And it's nice to have easy access to it.

316
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:58,760
I agree with you.

317
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:04,100
Like the sweet spot for me is one or two releases behind is okay.

318
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:06,680
Three releases, I start to notice it.

319
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:08,420
Four releases, and I'm like, what is this?

320
00:21:08,420 --> 00:21:09,420
Some old system?

321
00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:10,420
This is ridiculous.

322
00:21:10,420 --> 00:21:12,220
Is this Slackware?

323
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:16,760
And I just, I guess I just want, I want that stuff in my workstation OS.

324
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:19,760
I don't necessarily need that in my server OS as much.

325
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:24,920
And the LTS versions of Ubuntu are used as a server distribution.

326
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:29,460
It's such a wider deployment scale than they are as a gaming system.

327
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:34,360
So it is an absolutely reasonable choice for Canonical to make.

328
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:35,360
Yes, definitely.

329
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:40,840
And yeah, I can't help but be slightly disappointed because as an enthusiast, I'm not likely going

330
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:43,060
to want to deploy it.

331
00:21:43,060 --> 00:21:46,480
And I have just recently deployed an Ubuntu server.

332
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:50,160
And once I got it set up, then I removed a couple of the snaps that I accidentally installed

333
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:52,480
by default.

334
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:55,680
It's a pleasant experience, and it is reliable as heck.

335
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:57,320
It just sits there and runs.

336
00:21:57,320 --> 00:21:58,680
It's a great little system.

337
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:04,360
I think maybe in some case, the stability, the success of the Ubuntu LTS is maybe backfiring

338
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:05,360
a bit here.

339
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:09,640
Like, some of this is ameliorated if you run the Ubuntu point releases, you know, you kind

340
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:14,720
of do the interim releases, but I mean, you talk to them, folks at Canonical even sometimes,

341
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:16,180
those are just not what people are running.

342
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:18,140
That's not really the focus.

343
00:22:18,140 --> 00:22:22,600
And even I think sometimes enthusiasts just kind of forget they exist.

344
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:28,400
You know, after a while, an LTS in its lifecycle starts to just feel like Debian.

345
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:29,400
That's really what it is.

346
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:33,320
Like, okay, this is pretty much what current Debian is at this point.

347
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:36,800
Not that there's anything wrong with that, but it's not exactly shiny.

348
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:37,800
Yeah.

349
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:41,320
It does seem like when you look at the stats, which we will have linked in the show notes,

350
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:45,760
that there's definitely a user base out there that might be choosing their distro just simply

351
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:50,320
because they want the latest kernel, which is wild, but it seems to be happening.

352
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:52,520
Speaking of wild, we do this show every single week.

353
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:53,520
