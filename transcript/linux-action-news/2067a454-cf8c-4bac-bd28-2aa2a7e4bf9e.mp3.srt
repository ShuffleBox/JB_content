00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,980
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, our weekly take on Linux and the open source world.

2
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:20,720
This is episode 24, recorded on October 22nd, 2017.

3
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:21,720
I'm Chris.

4
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:22,720
And I'm Joe.

5
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:23,720
Hello, Joe.

6
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:27,520
It's good to be with you again, and for the first time ever, Samsung is kicking off our

7
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:28,880
news lineup this week.

8
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:33,380
Indeed, they are, and dare we use the word convergence?

9
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:35,360
That's pretty much what we're talking about here.

10
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:41,680
So a few months ago, they announced the DEX Dock, D-E-X, I think that's how you say it,

11
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:48,600
which allows you to put the S8 or the S8 Plus into a dock and then have what is essentially

12
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:53,640
the same as Remix OS, which is Android with a proper desktop, windowed applications, that

13
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:55,720
sort of thing, which was quite interesting.

14
00:00:55,720 --> 00:01:00,920
But now, Samsung have said that using that dock and one of their phones, you will soon

15
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:08,280
be able to run proper GNU slash desktop Linux, which is suddenly much more interesting to

16
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:09,280
me.

17
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:12,200
And it does make the price of their higher end phones a little more palatable if you

18
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:14,280
could use it as a desktop too.

19
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:20,040
Samsung says their ideal customer here is the developer for Linux on Galaxy, as they

20
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:21,040
put it.

21
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:25,120
And they say they can now set up a fully functional development environment with all the advantages

22
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:29,260
of a desktop setting that is accessible anytime, anywhere.

23
00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:31,540
And this is specifically in the Samsung announcement about it.

24
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:36,080
So the only requirements are an S8 and a DEX Dock.

25
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:39,760
And then once they ship this future Android update, whenever that is, we don't have any

26
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:44,120
details on that, they claim you'll be able to choose the distro that suits you best.

27
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:47,680
Yeah, and I'll be using the Linux kernel from Android.

28
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:50,320
So there'll be slightly less overhead there.

29
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:54,200
To be honest, this sounds an awful lot like Maru OS to me.

30
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:57,640
So it sounds like containerization of Linux, essentially, right?

31
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:01,680
You'll use the same kernel, you'll share a modern Linux kernel, you'll run things not

32
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:05,320
in virtualization, but more like in parallel to Android.

33
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:06,520
Is that your take on it?

34
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:11,040
Well, yeah, exactly like Maru does already, which no one seems to talk about in these

35
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:12,760
articles about this Samsung thing.

36
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:16,640
Well, if Maru was worth billions of dollars like Samsung is, perhaps people will be talking

37
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:17,640
about it more.

38
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:21,440
I mean, the reason why this is a story is because these are mainstream consumer devices

39
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:23,400
and this is a mainstream consumer company.

40
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:27,920
Well, yeah, it doesn't get much more mainstream when it comes to phones, apart from iPhones,

41
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:28,960
than Samsung ones.

42
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:35,920
So it's interesting to see that they are targeting developers like this because really, it's

43
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:38,880
just for normal people, the Samsung phones, right?

44
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:44,240
So you'd think that there wouldn't be that much of their market would be developers.

45
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:50,480
I don't see why, unless it's kind of a longer term goal that they've got for conversions.

46
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:54,360
I actually think what you're picking up on is their very problem they're trying to fix.

47
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:57,920
They don't have a strong developer geeky audience.

48
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:03,020
A lot of those people are probably buying iPhones or Pixels, in most cases, in the States

49
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:04,020
at least.

50
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:05,020
Yeah, the OnePlus phones.

51
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:07,600
Yeah, yeah, I should also mention those.

52
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:10,840
There is a category of phones that are a little geekier that are being bought.

53
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:13,080
I shouldn't just single out the Pixel.

54
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:17,920
And I think this is Samsung's attempt to say, hey, come over here and check us out.

55
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:20,780
We offer something the other guys don't.

56
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:23,480
But to me, it comes across as a little tone deaf.

57
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:26,780
Because any developer that's going to want to get serious work done remotely is going

58
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:28,260
to have a laptop with them.

59
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:32,620
It's just the keyboard, the monitor, everything all built into one device.

60
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:33,760
It's kind of a long shot.

61
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,960
And to me, it seems a little tone deaf.

62
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:38,840
Their bigger customer market is going to be probably people more like you and I who just

63
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:42,760
want to have a productive workstation on the go and are not trying to write apps.

64
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:46,700
We don't have some crazy high performance requirement relative to what a smartphone

65
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:47,700
can offer.

66
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:51,200
Well, yeah, maybe people who just need to SSH into some servers and therefore all they

67
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,200
need is a terminal.

68
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:53,200
Yeah.

69
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,200
And a keyboard.

70
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:56,800
But I suppose, again, yeah, maybe they just use a laptop.

71
00:03:56,800 --> 00:04:00,640
So it may be there isn't a huge market for it, but I am interested in it.

72
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:04,320
And I'm very interested to see how much of it's going to be open source when this comes

73
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:05,320
out.

74
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:10,600
Because Android, the underlying system is open source, at least most of it.

75
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:17,200
And the containerization, surely they'll be using something like LexD or LexC to do this.

76
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:22,020
But you would think that they're going to have to open source at least some of it.

77
00:04:22,020 --> 00:04:25,340
Typically my response to a story like this would be skeptical.

78
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:27,360
And I am predominantly skeptical.

79
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:30,200
But there are a few things that line up in Samsung's favor.

80
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:32,440
First of all, the S8 is a well-selling device.

81
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:37,400
Second of all, the DeX, the little dock that's required, is a well-reviewed functional selling

82
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:38,400
device.

83
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:41,600
So the main components are already in the marketplace.

84
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:42,920
It's all software at this point.

85
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:47,960
So it is achievable, and it may actually be achieved.

86
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:52,240
When and how much of it, like you said, is open source, that's what remains to be seen

87
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,240
because we don't have details on any of that stuff.

88
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:57,840
Yeah, and I think crucially that DeX stock is affordable as well.

89
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,760
It's like 50, 60 bucks, something like that.

90
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:03,440
So you're not having to shell out hundreds and hundreds to make this work.

91
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:06,880
So I think that adoption, well, I'm tempted.

92
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:10,640
If I had the Samsung phone in the first place, then I would be, it's a no-brainer I would

93
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:11,640
have it.

94
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:15,040
It's making me think twice about maybe getting hold of one of these Samsung phones, but they

95
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:17,160
are just so expensive.

96
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:21,280
Well consider saving your pennies, Joe, and perhaps purchase a Purism laptop.

97
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:27,640
They've announced that future Librem laptops will ship with the Intel management engine

98
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:29,440
disabled by default.

99
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:33,920
Now Chris, the first thing that pops into my head here is can we hire their PR department

100
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:39,040
please to promote JB because they are doing such an excellent job.

101
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:42,560
Every week they're in the news doing something that is interesting.

102
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,280
That's actually newsworthy in itself.

103
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:47,640
How many open source projects do you know of that crush it like this when it comes to

104
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:48,760
the PR cycle?

105
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:53,920
And because of their success, you're seeing projects that want to attach with that rising

106
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:54,920
tide.

107
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:59,320
So we've had the plasma mobile folks come along, GNOME folks have made announcements,

108
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:01,200
and now Nextcloud is making announcements.

109
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:06,800
And when's the last time we've seen these well-established, well-known open source projects

110
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:12,840
rally together like this, oh, and I'm leaving out Matrix, which is a huge component of this.

111
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:17,840
There is a real success story here in how they're messaging and how these really large,

112
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:23,440
well-known, quote unquote, open source brands, and I use that debug term very loosely, are

113
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:27,600
coming together around this effort that Purism has.

114
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:30,220
And it's really, it works for everyone.

115
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:32,080
It seems to be playing to everyone's strengths.

116
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:33,080
This is kind of unprecedented.

117
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:37,080
Well, it feels a little bit like the early days of Ubuntu, doesn't it?

118
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:44,680
Where suddenly, there was this buzz and excitement about getting open source to the masses and

119
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:49,600
talking about 100 million devices or whatever it was, and Ubuntu fridges.

120
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:52,080
And okay, most of that never came to pass.

121
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:56,360
But at the same time, there was that buzz and excitement.

122
00:06:56,360 --> 00:07:01,720
And now Ubuntu has kind of established an old hat on its way to becoming a public company.

123
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:08,240
And now you've got Purism coming up in the market, being this exciting new freedom-loving

124
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:15,680
company that is just on this mission to promote software freedom and open source, although

125
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,440
they don't call it that.

126
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:19,940
It feels like an echo of that time to me.

127
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:22,460
That's definitely a positive take on it, and I hope you are right.

128
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:27,000
So to break it down a little, you have positive technologies in the mix here.

129
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,920
They're the research group that really did all of the heavy lifting on breaking this

130
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:32,180
management engine.

131
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:36,000
And there's a bigger backstory to this, and I'm really glad that Purism is riding this

132
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:41,840
wave because the bigger backstory here is Intel with Skylake made a switch in the architecture

133
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:43,240
of the management engine.

134
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:49,340
And they went from some crazy ARM-ARC system or whatever, I have very little understanding,

135
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:55,000
to an x86-based management system using the Intel Edison chips.

136
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:00,640
And that makes it significantly easier for hackers and people who want to exploit the

137
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:05,720
management engine to find exploits, because now it's x86 and all of your tools that work

138
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:09,760
on the x86 chip to take apart stuff work on this management engine.

139
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:14,080
So the pace has really picked up, plus we've just had recent vulnerabilities that Intel

140
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:17,700
had to patch, which has added a lot of interest to this.

141
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:23,560
But it does leave me wondering if this success is limited to the Skylake systems right now,

142
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:28,040
because this took an unbelievable amount of engineering to trick this thing into booting

143
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:31,560
in a way that allowed it to continue to boot even though not all the components are present.

144
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:37,880
And I have seen some skepticism that because it's basically a black box, that processor,

145
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:43,760
that it might just be reporting that the management engine hasn't loaded when really it has.

146
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:47,660
And there's basically no way to know that because it's completely proprietary.

147
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:49,200
They've really done a lot of poking around.

148
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:53,400
I want to give them the benefit of the doubt, but this success will be unique to Skylake

149
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:58,120
unless Intel has kept this management engine essentially the same between architecture

150
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:01,400
improvements and updates, which is doubtful.

151
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:03,800
But then again, I guess now they have this head start, they might be able to keep up

152
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:08,200
with the pace, but I wouldn't be surprised if in a couple of generations or the next

153
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:12,760
generation when Purism is offering updated laptops with new Intel chips in them, if they

154
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:18,040
are unable to offer this management engine disabled initially, but then could perhaps

155
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:22,040
later on offer a firmware update to their existing customers and say, we're committed

156
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:27,080
to working on this, and if we crack it, we'll issue a firmware update because apparently

157
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:31,360
the Librem 15 that I now own, which doesn't have the management engine disabled, will

158
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:35,540
be receiving a firmware update that I can elect to apply, which will disable it retroactively

159
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:36,540
for me.

160
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:37,540
Yeah.

161
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:42,520
And if you put your open source dreamer hat on for a second and just think about Intel

162
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:49,920
needs some pressure put on them by the market in order to stop selling processors that are

163
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:54,000
basically full of blobs, proprietary blobs.

164
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,560
And the only way that they're going to stop doing that is through market forces.

165
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:07,520
And so you need a company who's great at marketing like Purism to convince people that it matters.

166
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:14,080
And that's the first step in making Intel realize that it matters to the point where

167
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:18,600
people care enough to maybe stop buying their products.

168
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:24,740
And with the rise of ARM, Intel are in a position now, okay, at the moment, they're still dominant

169
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:28,600
in basically everything but embedded systems, including phones.

170
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:31,720
But how long is that necessarily going to last?

171
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:37,560
And unless they start taking this stuff seriously and taking privacy concerns seriously, which

172
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:43,280
seem to be growing, certainly within the industry, maybe not normal people who just buy a phone

173
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:47,980
and whatever or buy a laptop and don't care about it, but the kind of people who are fitting

174
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:53,160
out data centers with potentially millions of dollars worth of Intel products are starting

175
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:54,900
to take note of this stuff.

176
00:10:54,900 --> 00:11:00,880
And if Intel don't start addressing some of those concerns, then it could ultimately be

177
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:01,880
the end of them.

178
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:03,920
And this is a sweet spot for Purism.

179
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:07,100
And it's something they can really focus in on.

180
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:11,280
And I would encourage them still to consider dropping PureOS.

181
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:16,360
I think if you were to ship a mainstream Linux distribution with hardware that now is well

182
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:21,040
built, has physical kill switches for the radios, and ships with the Intel management

183
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:25,480
engine disabled, the only negative on that checklist of features now is your own homebrew

184
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:26,480
OS.

185
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:30,720
And if you just offered a few options or just committed to one distribution of mainline

186
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:34,200
distributions, it's a really compelling package and offering.

187
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:38,200
But honestly, the kind of person who's going to buy this, they're going to immediately

188
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:40,160
reload it with Arch or whatever.

189
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:41,280
Yep, 100%.

190
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:45,160
So why even waste the resources and invest the time in PureOS and instead focus your

191
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:46,920
energy on other efforts?

192
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:48,680
Just ship it with Trisco, maybe.

193
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:49,680
There you go.

194
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:51,560
I mean, legitimately, that could work.

195
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:56,040
If nothing else, I understand they want to have it as a differentiating aspect of the

196
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:57,460
Librem laptops.

197
00:11:57,460 --> 00:12:01,240
And it may be that things like this Next story play into that.

198
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:04,880
Perhaps they want to ship PureOS because they want to be able to bundle things by default,

199
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:05,880
like Next Cloud.

200
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:10,920
Yeah, so we reported on this, I think, a couple of weeks ago, the end-to-end encryption, which

201
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:15,000
is coming to Next Cloud imminently.

202
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:21,720
And now Purism have partnered with Next Cloud to ship it on their machines.

203
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:26,760
So again, excellent PR synergy, I suppose you would say here.

204
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:31,800
Attach themselves to a company and project that is incredibly popular and privacy focused

205
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:34,460
and seems to share a lot of the same goals as them.

206
00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:37,180
And so it just seems to be a very good fit for them.

207
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:38,180
I agree.

208
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:41,300
And there is implications of future collaboration.

209
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:45,360
In the announcement on Purism's website, there's just one paragraph.

210
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:49,280
And partway into the paragraph, they say, additionally, Purism will be discussing with

211
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:54,120
Next Cloud about future Purism NAS that runs completely free software, including Next Cloud

212
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:55,120
and services.

213
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:57,760
Yeah, just casually tossed in there, yeah.

214
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:01,820
Let's just make all the things, a phone, laptops, an operating system, and a NAS.

215
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:02,820
Make all of them.

216
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:06,400
Well, to be fair, a NAS is fairly straightforward.

217
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:10,520
Of all of those things, a laptop, a phone, or a NAS, I know which one I'd rather build

218
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:12,160
because it's the easiest.

219
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:13,160
Absolutely.

220
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:16,760
And really, there is a legitimate market for it as more and more people have their own

221
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:18,160
media collections.

222
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:21,160
So it's a big week for all of these projects.

223
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:22,680
And it's cool to see them all working together.

224
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:27,120
It's like your favorite open source friends coming together to work on a cool collaborative

225
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,120
project.

226
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:30,560
Yeah, open source supergroup almost.

227
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:34,040
So we talked about, I think, last time, didn't we, firmware update?

228
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:36,720
I never can say that.

229
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,960
And how it was a great thing.

230
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:43,300
And it turns out that they're kind of not doing that well financially.

231
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:47,520
They've got a bit of support from Amazon for hosting, but they could really do with some

232
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:50,720
donations to buy hardware to test stuff on.

233
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:56,800
Yeah, a huge part of FW Update, as a quick reminder, it's the software project that is

234
00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:01,800
working with hardware manufacturers to update firmware and everything from your Intel chip

235
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:03,760
to your Logitech receivers.

236
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:10,160
And it is dependent on a hosting service called the Linux Vendor Firmware Project, which is

237
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:13,400
where all the stuff goes through and then gets distributed down and whatnot.

238
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:14,920
And that is where the testing comes in.

239
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:17,360
That's where the hosting costs come in.

240
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:21,480
And while the time for development of this project is graciously, essentially donated

241
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:24,140
by Red Hat, the hosting is not.

242
00:14:24,140 --> 00:14:27,120
And so they're reaching out to the community to try to raise funds.

243
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:30,240
And they have very humble goals.

244
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:35,200
They're hoping to raise enough funds to buy secondhand hardware to do testing, which is

245
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:36,200
great.

246
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:37,680
I like keeping costs low.

247
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:41,760
But to me, this is one of the most important open source desktop projects right now.

248
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:43,680
And it's very important in the server space too.

249
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:48,680
But just to get that desktop first class citizen style firmware updates, this is a really important

250
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:50,040
project to me.

251
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:53,920
And I'll be looking into Librepay because that looks like a cool site too.

252
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:56,200
And I might be considering donating that way.

253
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:58,440
Yeah, ideally they're looking for regular donations.

254
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:00,080
I mean, everyone is, aren't they really?

255
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:02,760
So you've got a sustainable funding model.

256
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:06,560
And even if it's only a few cents a week, they'd be happy enough with that.

257
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:11,960
So yeah, do follow the link in the show notes at linuxactionnews.com slash 24.

258
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:13,560
And go help them out.

259
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:17,480
Now the next story we have is one that we tend to dread a little bit, not because it's

260
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:18,920
a bad story.

261
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:21,400
It's just packed full of legalese and it's a little dry.

262
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:23,600
But at the same time, it's a pretty big story.

263
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,600
I think it's kind of historic.

264
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:31,220
The 200 Linux kernel developers and copyright holders came together, well, they made some

265
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:32,220
news this week, Joe.

266
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:37,680
Yeah, they're fed up with one of the authors of Netfilter trying to enforce the GPL for

267
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:38,880
his own gain.

268
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:41,240
For monetization, as they call it.

269
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:42,240
Yeah.

270
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:48,240
And so the key issue here is the difference between suing people for financial gain and

271
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:50,760
trying to make them actually come into compliance.

272
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:52,880
And compliance is a key word here.

273
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:58,760
And what they mean by compliance is if you take the Linux kernel, you make some changes,

274
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:03,540
and then you release a product that has those changes, then you need to contribute your

275
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:04,660
code back.

276
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:06,280
And that's all we're really interested.

277
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:07,280
That's what they're saying here.

278
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:10,160
We're not interested in suing you and making money from you.

279
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:16,400
All we want is you to respect the license and contribute to the community as a whole.

280
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:20,460
And that, on the surface of things, seems completely reasonable to me.

281
00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:23,880
They're calling it the Kernel Enforcement Statement, and it adopts some termination

282
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:30,600
provisions from the GPL-3 and also adds some additional time, some additional, quote unquote,

283
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:35,720
permissions to give companies time to come into compliance before they get sued.

284
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:40,400
Their aim here being to essentially reestablish confidence amongst large companies that might

285
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:44,920
want to use Linux at the core of their products that if they screw up, if they make a misstep

286
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:49,560
because of some strange legal issue that to them seems foreign, they're not going to immediately

287
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:51,160
be punished for it in the courts.

288
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:57,480
Yeah, the idea is that you get at least 30 days to sort it out and release your code,

289
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:02,240
rather than just being pounced on immediately and sued and it costing you loads of money.

290
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:05,280
Even if you win, it's going to cost you loads of money because you've got legal fees to

291
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:06,280
pay.

292
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:11,160
So they're basically putting this buffer in place, which, again, seems fair enough

293
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:12,160
to me.

294
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:16,080
How this is actually implemented is a bit fascinating and very geeky.

295
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:20,480
It's a pull request to add a new file to the kernel's documentation directory.

296
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:25,120
It adds a short document describing the views of how the Linux kernel community feels about

297
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:27,200
enforcing the license of the kernel.

298
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:31,020
So essentially, it's a document that they're adding to the source tree that essentially

299
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:36,160
states the majority of the copyright holders of the important parts of the kernel view

300
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:39,200
the license terms as X.

301
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:43,040
Just so you know, if you use this license, that's how we're viewing these provisions.

302
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:46,800
Basically they're asserting their legal interpretation of a clause, and what was explained to me

303
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:51,560
by an audience member who's a lawyer is that that has a lot of weight in legal proceedings.

304
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:56,720
If you start using something where the copyright holders have been explicit about their interpretation,

305
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:58,520
it holds a considerable amount of legal weight.

306
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:03,560
Oh, now that's interesting because obviously I have to use my favorite acronym, IANL, I'm

307
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:10,640
not a lawyer, but I thought that if it's not in the license, then it wouldn't be necessarily

308
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:11,720
legally binding.

309
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:15,120
But if a lawyer has said that it is, then fair enough.

310
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:17,980
I don't know if legally binding was the way he described it to me.

311
00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:23,480
It's more like you acknowledge this interpretation when you accepted the license, and so if you

312
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:27,240
try to take them to court, you're going to have to argue while even understanding that

313
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:29,160
interpretation you still feel you're right.

314
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:30,160
Okay.

315
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:34,920
And there's a huge list of developers and copyright holders who have act this, as they

316
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:37,920
call it, basically acknowledging and giving their blessing to it.

317
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:43,160
And I was looking down that list, I actually did a control F for Torvalds, he's in there.

318
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:47,040
If he is on board with this, then it's good enough for me.

319
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:52,520
He has done a fantastic job of shepherding this project over the last 25 years.

320
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:59,720
And if he thinks this is a good idea, then as far as I'm concerned, it must be.

321
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:02,880
DigitalOcean.com, create an account and apply our promo code.

322
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:05,920
Here's the thing, it's all one word and you get a $10 credit.

323
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:10,800
Now you can get started over DigitalOcean in less than 55 seconds and get a Linux system

324
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:13,360
up on their crazy fast infrastructure.

325
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,400
I've spun up a new rig this week.

326
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:21,400
It's three cents an hour, and I'm running a full Ubuntu Mate 1710 desktop environment.

327
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:23,800
I'll tell you guys about it in a future episode.

328
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:24,800
I love it.

329
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:29,840
It has incredible speed, it's SSDs for all of the systems, and I've attached 100 gigabytes

330
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:33,240
of block storage to use as my home directory.

331
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:37,120
DigitalOcean.com, use the promo code, here's the thing, and you'll get a $10 credit.

332
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:41,320
And while you're there, now's a great time to play around with their new object storage.

333
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:43,040
They call it Spaces.

334
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:46,080
You can try it free for two months, and it's well done.

335
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:49,840
If you're a developer or just an end user, you'll find uses for it.

336
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:53,480
DigitalOcean.com, data centers all over the world and a dashboard for days.

337
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:55,800
Use our promo code, here's the thing.

338
00:19:55,800 --> 00:20:03,200
Okay, well, there's no way we could have done a show without the biggest news of the week,

339
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:06,720
which is that Ubuntu 1710 has been released.

340
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:12,760
The biggest release of Ubuntu in five, six, seven years, something like that.

341
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:15,760
Obviously, there's the main edition, and then there's the flavors.

342
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:19,520
The flavors are not massively interesting, apart from Ubuntu Mate, which no doubt we'll

343
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:23,860
get back to, but let's talk a bit about this main release.

344
00:20:23,860 --> 00:20:31,100
It's been basically six months in the making, converting from Unity to GNOME 3.

345
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:34,780
At first, some skeptical people thought that it was going to be very stock.

346
00:20:34,780 --> 00:20:36,400
It turns out not to be.

347
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:39,720
It turns out, in my opinion, to be way better than stock GNOME.

348
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:48,400
Yeah, and under the hood, under GNOME, you have kernel 4.13, glibc 2.26, gcc 7.2, and

349
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:53,200
a lot of other improvements to like Bluetooth and hardware accelerated video codecs, which

350
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:58,360
will have a dramatic improvement, I hope, on video playback on laptops and battery life.

351
00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:00,840
All those things could use a big improvement.

352
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:03,320
The big question is, do you think this is a good release?

353
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:05,040
Have they made themselves proud here?

354
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:06,320
I've been surprised so far.

355
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:07,960
I've got it on several machines.

356
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:12,780
I went through a phase of just installing it on a bunch of systems, and I'm progressively

357
00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:18,720
getting closer and closer to more production-important systems, and it's going really well.

358
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:19,720
It's a solid release.

359
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:21,960
It really does have the heart of Ubuntu in it.

360
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:26,040
It feels like an Ubuntu experience, and it still leaves room for other distributions

361
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:31,160
like SUSE and Fedora, which also offer really compelling GNOME experiences, so it really

362
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:34,380
hit that sort of sweet spot where it's uniquely Ubuntu.

363
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:39,560
It's definitely upstream GNOME, but I still think there's room to dance around a little

364
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:43,840
bit in that GNOME desktop space and sort of experience the other distribution's implementations,

365
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:49,140
but this is, I believe, one of the most competitive implementations of the GNOME desktop right

366
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:50,200
now.

367
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:56,840
So you haven't been tempted to install gnome-session and log out and then go into a standard stock

368
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:57,840
GNOME session?

369
00:21:57,840 --> 00:21:59,280
No, you know, I'm really lucky.

370
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:02,960
I'm one of those users that likes all of the defaults.

371
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:06,200
All the stuff they've enabled in GNOME, I would just turn back on myself.

372
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:07,200
Yeah.

373
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:11,720
Well, the biggest thing for me is actually having a desktop that you can put icons on.

374
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:14,880
I know a lot of people like to keep it clean, but I don't.

375
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:19,200
That's where I store an awful lot of stuff for my sins, so that's nice to see.

376
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:21,720
It's nice to see a proper minimize button.

377
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:27,320
The dock on the left-hand side is very Unity-like, and so if you are a Unity refugee, then that's

378
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:30,280
going to keep you happy to some extent.

379
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:32,080
I never really used Unity.

380
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:34,480
I tried it out many times and never liked it.

381
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:40,740
I always liked it a little bit more than GNOME, and I feel that I don't think I could use

382
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:42,200
a stock GNOME desktop.

383
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:50,000
I'd have to tweak it extensively, whereas I could probably use this at a push.

384
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:59,000
Obviously, I'm an XFCE user, so it's XFCE or MATE for me, or even LXDE makes me happy.

385
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:04,560
So I'm probably the wrong person to judge it in terms of how it compares to stock GNOME,

386
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:06,560
but I think it's usable.

387
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:08,760
I think that they've done a good job for what it is.

388
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:15,280
I still would have liked to have seen something like MATE, but at the same time, that is not

389
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:19,080
quite there yet, is it, in terms of high DPI support and stuff like that?

390
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:22,620
Yeah, and that's where they've really done a lot of good work, is polishing those rough

391
00:23:22,620 --> 00:23:25,920
edges like high DPI and fractional scaling.

392
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:30,920
The very final theme touches that they polished off right before they shipped make a huge

393
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:32,480
difference in usability for me.

394
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:34,080
Yeah, and you mentioned Bluetooth.

395
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:35,440
That's something they've been concentrating on.

396
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:38,280
I've tested that out now, and that is brilliant.

397
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:42,360
I wish all desktop environments and all distros worked as well as that does.

398
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:48,240
I've been distro-hopping for about five to six months, and I didn't think I'd ever go

399
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:53,880
back to using Ubuntu as my main desktop, but as of right now, 1710 has pulled me back,

400
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:59,440
and I'm deploying different versions of 1710 on different machines for the work case, and

401
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:01,400
I like all the different flavors, too.

402
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:05,080
We should talk a little bit about the flavors as well, because it's not just all about the

403
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:09,680
GNOME version of Ubuntu, a friend of the show, Martin Wimpress and team have released Ubuntu

404
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:14,520
Mate 1710, and they say it's their best release they've ever produced.

405
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:20,080
Well, yeah, it is rock solid from what I have tested it, and to be honest, it was rock solid

406
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:25,480
a couple of months ago at the alpha stage, and not much has changed since.

407
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:32,280
It hasn't needed to, and you've got this mutiny layout, which has been developed even further

408
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:39,280
than it was before, to the point where it's not quite Unity, but it's very, very close.

409
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:43,380
This is a cunning strategy of the Ubuntu Mate project, because what they are essentially

410
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:47,120
creating is a refugee for Unity 7 fans.

411
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:50,120
They've been working on these features for multiple releases now.

412
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:55,600
The HUD support isn't new to the 1710 release, it's just been nailed in the 1710 release.

413
00:24:55,600 --> 00:25:01,840
The Super Key support wasn't new to 1710, it just works universally now regarding layout

414
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:03,840
and has been nailed in 1710.

415
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:08,320
So all these little things that Unity lovers are going to look for in a desktop environment

416
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:11,120
have been getting slowly added to Ubuntu Mate.

417
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:14,260
To a point now with 1710, it's pretty much there.

418
00:25:14,260 --> 00:25:19,040
It's just a couple of rough edges, and I think by the 1804 release, they're going to nail

419
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:20,040
it.

420
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:25,720
Well, the 1804 release is key to me, because I know it's supposed to be Linux Action news

421
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:32,060
and it should be all about new stuff, but the statistics prove that most Ubuntu users

422
00:25:32,060 --> 00:25:33,280
use the LTS.

423
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:40,120
So most people are still using 1604 and are watching this and testing this maybe, but

424
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:43,120
probably not rolling it out in production.

425
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:50,020
And this 1710 release is almost like a beta for the 1804 one.

426
00:25:50,020 --> 00:25:58,200
This is the testing ground, and it's kind of proof that the standard, the main Ubuntu

427
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:02,480
is ready, and Ubuntu Mate, same story.

428
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:07,520
It gives me great confidence that 1804 is going to be a great release for both of them.

429
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:14,760
I've heard numbers as high as 20x the amount of LTS users to the non-LTS releases.

430
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:17,000
So it's a huge, huge difference.

431
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:22,840
And part of my reason for switching to this 1710 release is I'm crossing my fingers, and

432
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:27,480
I'm hoping for a smooth upgrade to 1804, and then I'm just going to hang there for a couple

433
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:31,640
of years on all of our production equipment, and I'm going to let Wayland get itself worked

434
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:32,640
out.

435
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:35,760
I'm going to let Pipewire get itself worked out, and I'm just going to sit back and use

436
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:38,320
an LTS on the production equipment for years.

437
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:43,980
And so I'm hedging now with 1710 for 1804 to be good, and then I'll just sit back and

438
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:44,980
eat popcorn for a bit.

439
00:26:44,980 --> 00:26:47,760
Well, you mentioned Wayland, let's talk a little bit about that.

440
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:55,080
The default session is Wayland now, which has been so in Fedora for a couple of releases,

441
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:59,260
but Fedora does not have the user numbers of Ubuntu, let's face it.

442
00:26:59,260 --> 00:27:03,440
So this is going to be a huge test for Wayland.

443
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:10,280
You're going to have it rolled out to a lot of people testing Ubuntu 1710, and once we

444
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:14,360
get to 1804, that's when the real test is going to come, I think.

445
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:18,040
And so they have to nail it over the next six months.

446
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:24,360
But in my experience of a couple of pretty standard laptops, I had zero problems.

447
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:27,360
I would have not known I was on Wayland, essentially.

448
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:28,360
Perfect.

449
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:29,440
That's good to hear.

450
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:33,740
We had one crash on Wes's machine that we're attributing to Wayland, but we don't know

451
00:27:33,740 --> 00:27:35,240
for sure.

452
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:41,280
The other reality to the 1710 release is that it is truly standing on the shoulders of other

453
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:42,900
giants in the community.

454
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:48,360
There has been a lot of hard work by the Fedora project and others to build the Gnome software

455
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:54,400
center, to work issues out on Wayland, to build the Gnome shell up to where it is today.

456
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:58,960
That is significant, and it's kind of ironic that Canonical is able now to come back to

457
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:02,000
Gnome and is able to leverage that hard work.

458
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:05,520
There's a certain irony to it, but at the same time, there's a certain beauty to it.

459
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:07,440
Well, that's what open source is all about, isn't it?

460
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:11,360
It's supposed to be, although people are competing with each other, really everyone is in it

461
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:12,600
together.

462
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:16,440
This week also, believe it or not, marked the 13th birthday of Ubuntu.

463
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:18,960
So happy 13th birthday, Ubuntu.

464
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:21,560
Yeah, unlucky for some.

465
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:22,560
Hopefully not for them.

466
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:29,920
You know, that release 13 years ago shipped with Gnome 2.8, Firefox 0.9, OpenOffice 1.12.

467
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:30,920
Wow.

468
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:31,920
Yeah.

469
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:34,800
And now here we are with snaps.

470
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:36,280
We haven't talked about that.

471
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:41,160
Snaps feature prominently now with Ubuntu Marte, they're actually shipping a snap out

472
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:44,700
of the box, which is a bold step.

473
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:49,560
And it feels like Canonical have just gone all in at this point on snaps to the point

474
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:56,440
where when you do a search for software, you get snaps alongside devs with equal standing,

475
00:28:56,440 --> 00:29:02,000
which makes me think that they are definitely confident that snaps are basically there,

476
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:05,960
which I can't agree with, really.

477
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:11,440
I think that they're ready for testing, they're ready for some use, but I don't think that

478
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:17,440
it's quite 100% there for the kind of person who is going to use Ubuntu.

479
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:22,040
That's probably why they put it in Ubuntu Marte and they did it with the Pulse audio

480
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:26,240
mixer so that way, and that's a command line app, it's not a very popular app and it doesn't

481
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:27,240
ship by default.

482
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:30,200
I don't even know what's in the Debian repo at this moment.

483
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:34,400
So that's sort of, I think, a perfect edge case because you have something that'll be

484
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:39,040
really low use, but you can still ship it and test updating to it.

485
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:44,400
I had a good conversation with Wimpy on Linux Unplugged about the backstory behind this

486
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:45,400
move.

487
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:48,080
And the backstory is really to learn what it's like to have a high load of an app and

488
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:50,280
then ship updates to it as a regular thing.

489
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:52,800
And they're seeing if it is ready or not.

490
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:56,120
They're going into this with the mindset of we might come out of this with data that tells

491
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:57,120
us we're not ready.

492
00:29:57,120 --> 00:30:02,220
Well, yeah, which is fair enough for that, as you say, a command line app, but what I'm

493
00:30:02,220 --> 00:30:08,400
talking about here is if you search for software in the GUI on Ubuntu proper, you get snaps

494
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:12,040
in the results and it means that people are going to be installing them and they're going

495
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:13,040
to be testing them.

496
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:16,440
Now I have to get this double checked and if anybody in the audience knows, please let

497
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:18,200
me know.

498
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:23,160
The way I believe that works is GNOME software has a plugin architecture and so snaps is

499
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:29,160
a plugin to GNOME software and plugins by default list higher in the search result than

500
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:30,800
your distros repo.

501
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:35,120
So that's a function of GNOME software, not a modification that Ubuntu made to give preference

502
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:36,120
to snaps.

503
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:40,820
Yeah, but at the same time, they're still there given equal billing and there's nothing

504
00:30:40,820 --> 00:30:42,360
stopping people installing them.

505
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:43,360
Absolutely.

506
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:44,360
And I'm sure that's what they hope.

507
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:46,560
Well, yeah, they hope that people will test them.

508
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:50,120
And I suppose 1710, as I said, is basically a beta for 1804.

509
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:52,960
I know there's a lot of people would strongly disagree.

510
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:57,840
They spent so much time getting this ready as a release, but as I say, 20x the number

511
00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:00,040
of people using the LTS is.

512
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:06,640
So they've got the several months now to see how it works out with people using snaps.

513
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:11,040
And I'm going to try to follow up on that story and get the get the data.

514
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:14,080
I'm hoping that Canonical will share it with us one way or the other.

515
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:18,440
I do feel like we have to give one honorable mention to the flavor I'm considering the

516
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:23,320
most this release because I'm building remote desktops that are hosted on Digital Ocean

517
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:24,320
and it's Ubuntu.

518
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:27,480
So Ubuntu 1710 is on my radar this release cycle.

519
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:29,640
Yeah, there's not massive changes.

520
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:35,840
There's a few GTK 3 things, slowly but surely, all the elements are being ported to GTK 3

521
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:39,360
and you get the feeling that it's going to be finished right around the time GTK 4 comes

522
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:40,360
out.

523
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:41,360
Yeah.

524
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:43,400
But let's ignore that and let's just say that it's good progress.

525
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:45,080
I am sitting here using Ubuntu.

526
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:46,680
I love it.

527
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:54,720
I've tested out 1710 and it works almost exactly the same way that 1604 does.

528
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:59,560
And so I'm confident that 1804 is going to be a great release and I will upgrade to it

529
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:02,480
and not look back for the next couple of years.

530
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:06,440
Yeah, I might try it on my X2Go systems because I'm going to be able to take advantage of

531
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:12,160
all of the core new features of 1710 like the new Bluetooth and USB audio device fixes

532
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:13,680
which actually would come in handy.

533
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:19,680
And I really appreciate the improvements to client-side decorations for GTK 3 themed apps.

534
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:23,520
That's just going to make things look better and more modern on the XFCE desktop.

535
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:24,520
So it's a serious contender.

536
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:27,920
I'm going to load it up on a remote session and try it out for a bit and compare it to

537
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:31,160
Ubuntu MATE and other desktops and see which one works best.

538
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:32,520
And they're all really compelling releases.

539
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:36,480
We'll have links to this stuff in the show notes like Joe mentioned linuxactionnews.com

540
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:37,480
slash 24.

541
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:42,080
Yeah, I hate to say it Wimpy, but come on Chris, come to the XFCE dark side.

542
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:46,080
Well, I'll at least give it a spin, but I sure have been enjoying Ubuntu MATE right

543
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:47,080
now.

544
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:48,080
Okay, well we got to cut it off there.

545
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:51,480
