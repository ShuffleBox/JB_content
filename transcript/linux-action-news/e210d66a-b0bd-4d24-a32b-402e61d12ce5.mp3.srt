00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,360
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, episode 242, recorded on May 25th, 2022.

2
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:10,480
I'm Chris.

3
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:11,480
And I'm Wes.

4
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:12,480
Hello, Wes.

5
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:14,840
Let's do the news.

6
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:20,200
We start this week with an almost clichÃ© kernel release from Linus Torvalds, announcing

7
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:23,040
Linux 5.18.

8
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:28,700
Linus wrote in the 5.18 announcement, no unexpected nasty surprises this last week.

9
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:31,820
So here we go with the 5.18 release right on schedule.

10
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:37,240
And that obviously means that the merge window for 5.19 will open tomorrow.

11
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:42,200
No surprises, perhaps, but there have been some controversial additions.

12
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:48,920
5.18 brings the first wave of support for Intel's software-defined silicon, or SDSI,

13
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:49,920
functionality.

14
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:54,620
The purpose of which is to disable access to specific processor capabilities in the

15
00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:58,880
absence of a certificate from Intel saying otherwise.

16
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:02,640
Yeah, my brain almost has a hard time believing the words coming out of your mouth, Wes, but

17
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:05,020
it is all true, and it's all GPL.

18
00:01:05,020 --> 00:01:06,720
So that's good, right?

19
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:09,000
No, it leaves us feeling uneasy.

20
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,920
But here's what we do know.

21
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:15,480
David Box, who submitted the patch set, he made at least one aspect of this clear.

22
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:18,560
The interface to the mechanism itself is relatively simple.

23
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:22,040
It's not like Intel's doing anything weird on your Linux box.

24
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:28,880
What happens is this system appears as a device on the bus that offers a couple of operations.

25
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:34,400
Install an authentication key certificate or a capability activation payload.

26
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:38,280
So the certificate is used to authenticate any request to enable a feature, while the

27
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:41,600
payload actually contains the requests themselves.

28
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:46,200
And unless this device has been used to store an acceptable certificate and payload, the

29
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:51,880
features that it governs will be unavailable to software that is running on this new Intel

30
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:53,480
CPU.

31
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:58,920
This new SDSI hardware also maintains a couple of counters that it uses to track how many

32
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:04,760
times you've tried and failed to load a certificate or enable a feature.

33
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:09,920
And well, if you exceed the threshold for those counters, the mechanism will be disabled

34
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:11,120
entirely.

35
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:15,880
No new shiny features for you, unless you power cycle your box.

36
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:22,560
Yep, and Intel says this is great because it's a system that enables shipping cheaper

37
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:27,880
CPUs with features that could be of interest to users down the road, but are just unavailable

38
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:30,080
until the additional payments are made.

39
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:35,020
Um, yeah, I mean, to be clear at this stage, we don't really know what those features

40
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:36,020
are going to be.

41
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:38,360
So that will be worth waiting for.

42
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:42,020
But we do know at this point, the Linux support should be ready.

43
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:49,000
And as for me, well, I'll be ready to vote with my wallet.

44
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:55,280
Looking ahead to Linux 5.19, butterFS users are in for a fresh treat.

45
00:02:55,280 --> 00:03:01,200
David Sterba of SUSE has submitted almost 4000 lines of code with some exciting new

46
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:04,520
features from one of our favorite file systems.

47
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:09,520
Indeed, and surprise, surprise, performance has been the focus of a lot of this patch

48
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:10,520
set.

49
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:15,520
Probably the fruits of a lot of low level code optimizations by various groups at SUSE,

50
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:18,600
Facebook, and some other large supporters.

51
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:20,600
What are you getting for all that effort?

52
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:26,960
Well, starting in 5.19, butterFS will now avoid blocking on space reservation.

53
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:31,360
That's a change that should see about a 7% throughput improvement for both reads and

54
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,360
writes.

55
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:37,140
There's also been some improvements to locking code when you're using the no copy on write

56
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:38,360
option.

57
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:41,960
That's about a 3% throughput performance improvement.

58
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:45,880
And there's a nice to see improvement in the butterFS send code.

59
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:50,120
They've reduced pressure on the page cache there by dropping extent pages sooner.

60
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:52,400
The list just keeps going on here.

61
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:55,680
We're not going to go into all of them here on the show, but it's well worth checking

62
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:56,680
out in the notes.

63
00:03:56,680 --> 00:04:01,080
And I've got to think, you add up all these small little pieces, it's going to be some

64
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:03,160
performance improvements you can feel.

65
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:05,520
Yeah, how often does that happen?

66
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:09,320
Everything gets created, and then each release, it just gets better and faster.

67
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:13,800
I mean, I feel like at this point, butterFS is becoming one of the better turnaround stories

68
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:14,800
in free software.

69
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:16,580
It's really gotten good.

70
00:04:16,580 --> 00:04:21,800
And it's just great to see that the network effect of its adoption is really paying off.

71
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:27,560
If you haven't tried out butterFS for a laptop install, maybe a Raspberry Pi, it's worth

72
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:32,240
a go.

73
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:37,400
Alan's Christoph Steiner, aka ATAF, shared a noteworthy update this week on the F-Droid

74
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:38,400
infrastructure.

75
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:43,720
It included some nice improvements for developers submitting apps, and just for us end users.

76
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:44,720
Absolutely.

77
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:49,200
And for those of you out of the loop, F-Droid is a free alternative to Google Play.

78
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:52,680
It's something focused on free software.

79
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:57,200
You could perhaps load it on a device that has no Google services, and more and more

80
00:04:57,200 --> 00:05:03,280
apps are co-publishing in F-Droid, or perhaps some apps are only publishing there.

81
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:08,440
As you can imagine, running something like this over time, it sort of gets built organically,

82
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:12,520
and it requires a big pile of automation to manage the process of building thousands of

83
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:13,800
apps from source.

84
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:14,800
Yeah.

85
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,440
I mean, think about that for a moment.

86
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:20,480
You got to check out the source repos for all of those apps, you got to check to see

87
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:25,440
if they've been updated, you got to actually go through and build them, make a new release,

88
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:28,240
securely sign them, that's pretty tricky as well.

89
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:32,560
And then, of course, make sure that they get put into your test infrastructure, spin up

90
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:36,560
a virtual machine, make sure that they still work.

91
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:42,960
And yeah, all of that has sort of been built over the many years F-Droid has existed, and

92
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:45,680
it's all running on Debian.

93
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,400
But no, not the latest release of Debian.

94
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:48,400
Of course not.

95
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:53,760
It's an old install of Debian, like five years old Debian Stretch, I think.

96
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:56,000
Yeah, is that old in Debian terms?

97
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,340
I think it's getting there.

98
00:05:58,340 --> 00:05:59,480
You can understand, right?

99
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:05,240
Because upgrading to more recent releases, that's not like a simple app-get upgrade.

100
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:09,360
It's a lot more complicated, and the project says they also need to overhaul their build

101
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,080
process to get there.

102
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:15,360
And that's tricky, because they really need to provide a platform to build those thousands

103
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,360
of apps.

104
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:20,960
They can't just upgrade the base image as often as they might like.

105
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:22,500
Ain't that the truth?

106
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:27,120
But work is underway, even if it's going to take some time.

107
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,600
Thankfully though, this is nice to see.

108
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:33,560
Kallax Institute, who builds Kallax OS in F-Droid, they're sponsoring 42 hours a month

109
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:39,080
of time dedicated to improving the build infrastructure and improving automation more generally.

110
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:42,280
And you developers out there, well, you'll be happy to hear that the outcome of some

111
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:48,000
of this process should be faster application submission and improved signing automation.

112
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:57,840
That maybe opens up some possibilities for parallelizing the whole thing submission process.

113
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:03,480
Google has announced the Summer of Code 2022 project winners, and the list actually includes

114
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:06,360
more than a few names that you probably know.

115
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:10,480
Debug Point News has done a nice job of listing out the ones most folks would be interested

116
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:16,280
in, but there were a few that stood out to us, including FFmpeg, Google sponsoring some

117
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:23,640
work on a high-throughput JPEG 2000 decoder, as well as some work to enable CUDA C++ support.

118
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:27,920
Another lucky project this year is Debian, where the primary focus is going to be trying

119
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:31,520
to complete the Android SDK in Debian's packaging base.

120
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,620
Well, you got to have that.

121
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:39,280
There's also some summer fun coming to Tor, LibreOffice, the GNOME Desktop.

122
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:44,560
One that I thought was interesting is it looks like there's a project to sync GNOME Health

123
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:48,960
app with Apple Health, Nextcloud, and other apps.

124
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:52,120
I don't think I even knew there was a GNOME Health app, so that's interesting.

125
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:56,040
There's also a project to add Chromecast support to GNOME Network Display.

126
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,040
Yes, please.

127
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:58,040
I know, right?

128
00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:02,500
Yeah, I think they have Miracast now, and really just several other nice-to-see things

129
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:08,040
for GNOME, some Nautilus stuff, but don't worry, Plasma's getting some summer fun too

130
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:11,540
if you're a desktop of the Plasma-variety user.

131
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:14,660
Nothing too exciting though, nothing that really jumped out at me, but we will have the full

132
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:19,920
breakdown and a link to the Debug Point news article in our show notes, because it's not

133
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:21,560
just those projects.

134
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:27,780
There's a bunch of others getting some love, like Xorg, GIMP, VLC, etc., so go to linuxactionnews.com

135
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:32,720
slash 242 for a link to that.

136
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:38,820
Well, we all knew it would happen eventually.

137
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:44,520
This week, Canonical announced that Ubuntu 22.10, which is shipping in the fall, will

138
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:49,520
switch to Pipewire by default as its audio server.

139
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:55,480
Now technically we should note here that Ubuntu already includes Pipewire, 2204 LTS for instance

140
00:08:55,480 --> 00:09:00,080
ships with both Pipewire and PulseAudio installed.

141
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:06,140
But it's mainly included for Wayland compatibility, you know, all that fancy new stuff, and not

142
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:09,400
in use currently as the default server.

143
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:16,360
But starting with the next release, that finally changes.

144
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:17,840
Linode dot com slash LAN.

145
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:22,200
Go there to get $100 in 60 day credit on a new account, and that's where you go to support

146
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,320
the show.

147
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:29,280
Linode offers options for developers and businesses that don't want the complexities of hyperscalers

148
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:31,900
and don't need their endless options either.

149
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:35,020
You know they're always trying to lock you into their esoteric platform, and I feel like

150
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:37,320
Linode is the jetpack for my business.

151
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:40,660
Seriously, it lets me compete with the likes of Spotify.

152
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:45,760
I can deliver an on par experience with Linode's infrastructure at pricing that my business

153
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:47,880
can actually afford.

154
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:51,880
And their pricing is 30 to 50% cheaper than the major hyperscalers out there.

155
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:56,200
And they've been doing this for nearly 19 years, iterating on making the best platform

156
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:58,520
to run your applications.

157
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:01,960
Everything we've built in the last couple of years, we built it on Linode.

158
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:05,520
And we've learned that they have the best customer support in the business.

159
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:08,480
And this is the number one signal I hear from the audience.

160
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:13,000
Hey Chris, yeah they got me with the performance, but then I had this problem and the support

161
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,560
was unbelievable.

162
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:19,680
Tier one support, when you pick up the phone or you send them a message or a ticket, $3.65

163
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:21,760
a year they're working on it for you.

164
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:25,040
And on top of that, they just have some of the best performance with 11 data centers

165
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:26,360
around the world.

166
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:33,320
They are their own ISP, so they have just the fantastic, bestest internet ever.

167
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:35,640
It's so much fun to mess around with, I have to say.

168
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:39,400
And then they have great features that we use, like object storage, their cloud firewall,

169
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:41,120
their backups, and so much more.

170
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:44,820
And the dashboard makes managing all of this straightforward and simple.

171
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:49,360
So if you're just looking for a portfolio or a gaming server, they can do that.

172
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:52,480
But if you're looking to run the back end of your business and you want to scale up

173
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:56,720
to millions of users, yeah, they absolutely do that as well.

174
00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:01,040
Go build something, go try something, go learn something, and support the show.

175
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:06,720
Go to linode.com slash LAN, get that $100 in 60 day credit, and go kick the tires for

176
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:14,640
yourself while you support the show, linode.com slash LAN.

177
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:20,340
And a tremendous thank you to Ting for their sponsorship of Linux Action News, linux.ting.com.

178
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:22,840
Are you sick of overpaying for your cell service?

179
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:29,840
Yeah, go see how much you could save and then take $25 off of that when you go to linux.ting.com.

180
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:32,040
Ting is a mobile virtual network operator.

181
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:36,420
That means they focus on the customer relationship, the value, and they ride on top of the existing

182
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:40,480
network built by the big mega nationwide carriers.

183
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:45,880
You know who I'm talking about, and Ting utilizes their networks, the same fast LTE and 5G,

184
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:50,240
but you interface with Ting, who was recently named the number one carrier by Consumer Reports,

185
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:51,360
and you save a bunch of money.

186
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:56,040
Their plans are simple and straightforward, and there's no contracts ever.

187
00:11:56,040 --> 00:12:00,400
And Ting's customer service, of course, it's up there, and those little things all come

188
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:04,720
together, like simple plans, great pricing, network access, multiple network access I

189
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:10,240
might add, support, all of it just comes together to create a fantastic experience.

190
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:15,180
That's why I've been a Ting customer since 2013, for reals.

191
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:16,180
Go check them out.

192
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:21,760
The linux.ting.com plans that are really competitively priced and easy to understand, and if you

193
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,520
ever get stuck, they'll help you.

194
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:26,600
And you can do it all online, and pretty much any phone's going to work with Ting, so just

195
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:30,480
head to linux.ting.com, check your current phone, create an account, and pick the plan

196
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:37,880
that's right for you, linux.ting.com.

197
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:42,920
And we end this week on a rumor that could change the industry.

198
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:47,880
Bloomberg and others are reporting that within the next week, Rodcom could announce an agreement

199
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:53,800
to acquire VMware, at least according to people familiar with the matter.

200
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:59,800
Absolutely a big deal, and you'll recall in 2016 Dell acquired EMC, which owned VMware

201
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:05,280
at the time, for an historic $67 billion, still one of the largest acquisitions in tech

202
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:06,280
history.

203
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:12,160
And after five years of being part of Dell, VMware was then spun out in November of 2021

204
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:16,800
with an agreement to continue to work together with Dell for the next five years.

205
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:24,280
Now also along with that, Dell CEO Michael Dell owns approximately 41% of VMware.

206
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:27,660
He plays a critical role still at the company as chairman of the board of VMware, so he's

207
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:30,160
going to have a say in whatever happens here.

208
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:36,320
And VMware currently has a market valuation of around $50.3 billion.

209
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:41,660
The takeover discussions are ongoing, but there's also no guarantee that the talks actually

210
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:44,320
lead to an agreement.

211
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:48,080
Representatives for the two companies didn't immediately respond to requests for comment.

212
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:53,720
But the Wall Street Journal does note that the bid could be around $140 a share or totaling

213
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:54,720
$60 billion.

214
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:55,720
Wow.

215
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:59,600
I mean, $60 billion is a lot.

216
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:04,800
No getting around that, but it's interesting because it's not really what Dell originally

217
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:07,920
paid for VMware back in the day.

218
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:14,080
Dell's chief executive officer, Pat Gelsinger, told Bloomberg TV he has mixed feelings about

219
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:15,920
the potential acquisition.

220
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:18,240
And he does have some standing to comment.

221
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:23,680
Gelsinger was VMware CEO for eight years before recently returning to Intel.

222
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:24,680
First it's a rumor.

223
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:28,800
You know, I'm, you know, happily reading the newspapers like you on that.

224
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:33,760
But you know, for us, you know, I, you know, I'm excited about VMware being an innovative

225
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:35,600
partner for the future.

226
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:40,320
And any potential transaction for them, I'd want to make sure that innovation is alive

227
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:41,960
and well.

228
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:46,220
And while that's not a strong condemnation or really a strong endorsement, I would say

229
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:51,540
as far as CEO speak goes, it's rather bearish on the idea overall.

230
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:55,160
That's probably reflective of how we're all feeling right about now.

231
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:59,360
Of course, VMware is also a platinum member of the Linux Foundation.

232
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:01,440
So whatever happens here could impact that.

233
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:07,340
A platinum member pays around the tune of $500,000 a year for the title.

234
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:09,840
So we're going to keep an eye on this and everything else happening in the world of

235
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:13,720
Linux and open source news because there will be knock on effects.

236
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:18,960
So be sure you go to linuxactionnews.com slash subscribe for all the ways to get new episodes.

And don't miss the new show Office Hours at officehours.hair.

239
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:31,020
It's a podcast made just for the Jupiter broadcasting community.

240
00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:33,280
If you're not a J.B. listener, don't tune in.

241
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:35,200
It's not recommended for you.

242
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,200
OfficeHours.hair.

243
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:42,600
But hey, you can still find this show back every single week with the latest Linux and

244
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:44,400
open source news.
