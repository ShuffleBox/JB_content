00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,160
Hello and welcome to Linux Action News, episode 208 recorded on September 26th, 2021.

2
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:10,160
I'm Chris.

3
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:11,160
And I'm Wes.

4
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:12,160
Hello, Wes.

5
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:13,160
Let's do the news.

6
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:18,960
And we start this week with a story that seems rather straightforward on the surface, but

7
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:24,320
no doubt will represent a major engineering effort at Canonical.

8
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:33,080
Computers still running on 14.04 LTS, old trusty tar released back in April 2014 will

9
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:40,600
now have until April 2024, that's up from 2022, to finally make the move to something

10
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:41,600
more recent.

11
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:50,140
Wow, Wes, 14.04 is a different era of Linux, like we're talking like the last upstart era.

12
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:54,340
It's amazing, but yet doesn't surprise me there's still plenty of people running that

13
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:55,340
one in production.

14
00:00:55,340 --> 00:00:57,360
But that's not the only one getting extensions.

15
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:03,520
No, 16.04 Xenial Xeris, which dropped into extended security maintenance in April of

16
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:09,540
this year, has also been bumped from April 2024 to April 2026.

17
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:14,600
I'm struck by this because a it's Canonical clearly responding to a market demand, which

18
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:17,720
tells you there are people out there that need this.

19
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:22,720
It also makes them more competitive in this enterprise space, and it gives a lifeline

20
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:26,940
for Ubuntu admins who have other things on their plate besides upgrading their server

21
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:29,080
operating systems.

22
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:32,680
But to get access to these future updates, you're going to need to be an Ubuntu Advantage

23
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:37,720
subscriber, which is free for limited personal use or Ubuntu community members, but otherwise

24
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:40,160
requires an ongoing subscription.

25
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:45,040
That's an important point, but not unreasonable, I think, for enterprise deployments who are

26
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:47,120
depending on this stuff to keep working.

27
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:52,240
Yeah, and subscriptions for support, super common in the enterprise space.

28
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:56,800
And I think it's good for server admins that are still using 16.04 or 14.04 because at

29
00:01:56,800 --> 00:02:03,800
this point, it's significantly tricky to do the big leap upgrade, like going from 14.04

30
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:06,760
to 20.04 is a massive upgrade.

31
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:10,720
And admins have to do that math of trying to do the intermediary updates.

32
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:14,840
So they'd maybe have to go to 16.04, then 18.04, then 20.04.

33
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:18,480
We talk about a production nightmare on a server that's doing things that you depend

34
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:19,480
on.

35
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:21,000
And so this gives them more time.

36
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,720
It allows them to focus on things like all of the work from home load that's been created.

37
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:31,620
And I would guess they're likely now going to punt this problem until the next LTS comes

38
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:37,520
out, which is going to be Ubuntu 22.04, and they'll just probably wipe the slate clean

39
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:38,520
and go to that LTS.

40
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:42,220
I mean, if they haven't upgraded by now, I don't know what makes you think they'll ever

41
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:43,220
upgrade.

42
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:47,360
Maybe they'll just beg for more support.

43
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:52,400
Well this week, Google gave us some news on something kernel developers have been begging

44
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,400
for.

45
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:58,100
During the Linux Plumbers conference, we got an exciting update from a prominent member

46
00:02:58,100 --> 00:03:05,160
of Google's kernel team on his project, the Generic Kernel Image Initiative for Android.

47
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:08,520
My name is Todd Chose, I'm the kernel lead for that project.

48
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:14,120
And Todd is helping lead an effort to get Android using a vanilla upstream kernel one

49
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:15,120
day.

50
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:22,080
Mmm, yeah, and with Android 12 and Linux 5.10, based on the Android Generic Kernel Image,

51
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:27,720
which is also known as GKI, Todd reports Google has cut down on the out of tree patches to

52
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:30,520
an extent that it's been nearly eliminated.

53
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:38,500
We have what we call the generic kernel, which is really the core kernel minus modules.

54
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:46,440
And the big focus has been to get all of the SoC hardware specific code out of the core

55
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:53,200
kernel and into separate modules so that we can get it as clean and generic as possible.

56
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:59,000
It seems Google's motivation for taking this project on is focusing on reducing some major

57
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,400
technical debt that they've built up over the years, and really just trying to get everyone

58
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:08,960
in the Android ecosystem on the same technical page and make these devices more supportable.

59
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:15,880
What actually ships on an Android device in the past has been a device kernel with changes

60
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:21,440
that come from the Android team and from a reference kernel that we maintained, and then

61
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:25,980
changes from an SoC vendor, and then changes from an OEM.

62
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:33,560
And so the kernel that actually ships on a device is very custom for that device and

63
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:38,560
very different from the upstream version of Linux.

64
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:42,840
And they're making good progress on the GKI front, and also ensuring that vendors adapt

65
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:46,360
to this new approach to cut down on this kernel mess that Google created with Android.

66
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:52,060
Yeah, I don't think any of us are really surprised that this way of building the Android kernel

67
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:56,800
for each and every device has ultimately become unsustainable.

68
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:02,240
So the fact that this problem exists now is not really news to us, but what is a very

69
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:07,680
pleasant surprise is to see just how much progress Google has actually made in addressing

70
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:08,680
this.

71
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:15,120
And where it gets really interesting is their outlook for 2023 and 2024 for further reducing

72
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:19,160
that debt and getting even closer to upstream.

73
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:26,440
2023, 2024, we believe that we'll start reducing debt faster than we are accumulating it.

74
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:32,760
And the goal, of course, is to get as aligned with upstream as we possibly can, though since

75
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:38,200
out-of-tree modules are really important for our use case, we do expect that we'll always

76
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:46,840
have a set of exports and some things that are different or in addition to what's upstream.

77
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:52,040
But this whole project is a multi-year project working towards getting rid of as many out-of-tree

78
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:56,560
patches as we possibly can and aligning as much as possible with upstream.

79
00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:01,420
So while it seems like the nature of the Android beast is such that we might not ever have

80
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:07,520
a truly vanilla Linux running on our Android devices, it is going to get really close.

81
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:11,520
And that will be good news for both Linux and Android users.

82
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:16,780
But the good news continues because it's not just about resolving that existing technical

83
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:18,320
debt.

84
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:24,520
Todd said that going forward, Google are going to pursue a, quote, upstream-first development

85
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:31,440
model for new features, making sure new code first lands in the mainline kernel rather

86
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:35,200
than being shoved in the Android kernel without upstream review.

87
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:41,480
Yeah, and longtime listeners of Jupiter Broadcasting know this has been in the works for years

88
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:45,520
and it's pretty much just exactly in line with what the Linux kernel team have been

89
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:50,480
advocating the Android developers do since basically day one of Android.

90
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:54,400
And while this is something that we have been following for a long time and are clearly

91
00:06:54,400 --> 00:07:01,160
rather excited about, Android end users probably won't notice much other than hopefully a better

92
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:09,080
support lifecycle for their devices.

93
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:12,440
When Valve announced the Steam Deck, it was pretty quickly noted that one of the major

94
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:17,320
barriers to full Windows game compatibility was anti-cheat software.

95
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:21,840
Packages such as Epic's well-known Easy Anti-Cheat are free for Windows game developers to use

96
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:26,420
and there seems to be a lot of incentives for those developers to use those packages.

97
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:30,240
But these same anti-cheat systems prevented games that would otherwise play just fine

98
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:33,600
on Linux, perhaps under Proton, from running at all.

99
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:39,960
This week, Epic officially announced full support for Linux, including native builds

100
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:43,120
that support Wine and Proton.

101
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:48,120
Though it should be noted, game developers do need to do a few steps to support the new

102
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:50,720
version and update their games.

103
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:56,000
Yeah, hopefully they do that, since it sounds like it's very little effort on their part.

104
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:03,200
In fact, looking at the documentation, it literally reads it's quote, just a few clicks.

105
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:07,460
But in addition to Epic's news, Battleye also announced along with their existing native

106
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:12,440
Linux support, they're also issuing an update to support Proton and they specifically called

107
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:14,760
out working on the Steam Deck.

108
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:20,160
And just like with Easy Anti-Cheat, developers will need to opt in to this new Proton support

109
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,160
from Battleye.

110
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:27,280
Yeah, and it really is truly hard to convey what a significant development this is for

111
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:28,280
Linux gamers.

112
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:34,920
I mean, assuming game developers update, this is massive and Valve as well as both companies

113
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:40,160
for Epic and Battleye have confirmed that this will work on all Linux desktops.

114
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:42,000
It's not just a Steam Deck thing.

115
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,040
It's a Steam client thing.

116
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:47,360
I just personally hope we see the Destiny 2 developers update their game.

117
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,880
I think they're Battleye Anti-Cheat.

118
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:51,400
I'm not holding my breath, though.

119
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:55,220
And I think that's what's going to make or break this thing, Wes, is individual developers

120
00:08:55,220 --> 00:09:00,320
stepping up and putting at least the minimal effort in to supporting these new Anti-Cheat

121
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,320
updates.

122
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:04,080
And of course, that's going to be significant for the Deck as well.

123
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:09,080
Yeah, here's hoping things continue to go well and actually sticking with Linux gaming

124
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:13,680
and Steam just for a moment longer, Valve continue to release upgrades to the Steam

125
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:17,320
client with more and more tweaks for Linux users.

126
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:23,200
Liam over at Gaming on Linux caught some of the interesting changes in the recent release,

127
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:29,520
including improved startup speed, more robust game save via cloud sync and some fixes for

128
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:31,280
remote play.

129
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:37,840
Among other things in this release, though, there's new support that landed for PipeWire.

130
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:39,000
How about that?

131
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:44,460
How great is it to see Valve support a new core technology like this?

132
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:48,180
And one has to wonder if this is because Steam OS is now based on Arch.

133
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:54,480
With that aside, it seems that Valve has truly enabled PipeWire desktop capture support by

134
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:57,280
default on the new Linux Steam client.

135
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:58,280
That's huge.

136
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:03,920
And it also means early support for PipeWire is going to enable better and improved performance

137
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:05,140
on Wayland desktop.

138
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:09,920
So those of us that are out there doing remote play, game capture and other AV features on

139
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:12,600
Wayland should have a better experience now.

140
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:16,040
But it's just really great to see this land before the Deck even ships.

141
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:20,600
It's starting to look like a lot of things are lining up so that the Deck is really well

142
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:26,000
positioned software-wise when it hits the public's hands.

143
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:31,720
We've been keeping our eye on CentOS land, watching for significant developments to report

144
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:33,400
back to you.

145
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:41,680
A few days ago, AlmaLinux announced their AlmaLinux container images are now fully Red Hat Enterprise

146
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:45,320
Universal Base Image compatible.

147
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:51,360
With the announcement of CentOS's transition from legacy style releases to stream, most

148
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:55,540
of us have been primarily focused on the traditional OS model.

149
00:10:55,540 --> 00:11:00,680
But containers are where a ton of business applications are run now.

150
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:05,880
If you're not familiar with RHEL's UBI containers, it's not quite a full operating system, but

151
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:08,360
it's more than just a base image.

152
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:12,980
Actually you get three base images, and also a set of language runtime images to build

153
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:18,040
your applications on, as well as a set of associated packages that satisfy most common

154
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:19,040
dependencies.

155
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:24,760
And that's why it's a pretty essential milestone for AlmaLinux to be offering a compatible

156
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:26,200
alternative.

157
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:31,720
It really makes their CentOS alternative offering more of a complete ecosystem, and not just

158
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:44,760
focused on the standard distro replacement.

159
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:46,840
And then you go there and you're off to the races kid.

160
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:50,040
I'm telling you what 18 years Linode's been doing this.

161
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:52,760
And they're independently owned and independently financed.

162
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:58,260
Think about how huge that is for your personal confidence in the future of the company and

163
00:11:58,260 --> 00:11:59,260
their mission.

164
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:03,720
They've been doing one thing for 18 years, making cloud computing excellent.

165
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:08,080
They've focused on simplicity, affordability, scalability, and this has led to the best

166
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:09,520
in class experience.

167
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:10,520
And I mean it.

168
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:14,320
But something fun you can do with Linode and that $100 60 day credit is why not go try

169
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:17,720
out AlmaLinux and Rocky Linux at the same time.

170
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:20,840
They've got images for AlmaLinux 8 and Rocky Linux 8.

171
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:26,000
In fact, I think Linode has some of the widest and best Linux distribution support.

172
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,920
I mean, even if you want to run that crazy SUSE Linux, they got images for that.

173
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:30,920
I kid.

174
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:31,920
I kid.

175
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:32,920
I kid.

176
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:33,920
They also have one click deployment.

177
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:38,200
So it's really easy to get started with like Jitsi if you want to replace Zoom or NextCloud.

178
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:42,440
If you're ready to get rid of Dropbox or other closed file sync solutions and want to control

179
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:44,680
it yourself, go check out Linode.

180
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:47,960
It's fantastic for our infrastructure and it can be fantastic for yours.

181
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:52,320
And their pricing is 30 to 50% less than the major cloud hyperscalers out there.

182
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:54,700
And they have so many great features you're going to love.

183
00:12:54,700 --> 00:13:00,440
On top of an easy to use, powerful cloud dashboard, they have S3 compatible object storage, they

184
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:07,000
have cloud firewalls, DDoS protection, VLAN support, and a powerful DNS manager, Kubernetes,

185
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,800
and so much more.

186
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:12,520
Additionally, Linode's always investing in their infrastructure.

187
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:14,520
That's why they became their own ISP.

188
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:18,000
That's why they have AMD EPYC processors in their high end CPU systems.

189
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:24,240
And now with their block storage, beautiful, brand new, super fast NVMe PCIe storage.

190
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:25,760
Oh, it's so great.

191
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:27,880
And they're always doing stuff like that.

192
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:31,880
And you know, Linode could also be part of your multi-cloud strategy, something to consider.

193
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:37,720
66% of companies are looking at a mix of cloud providers to help reduce dependency, I guess

194
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:41,520
you could say, on the duopoly that is establishing in the cloud market out there.

195
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:43,040
Linode can be a key part of that.

196
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:47,160
And you can save money and have more reliability and have more leverage.

197
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:48,400
It's a pretty great opportunity.

198
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:51,160
And go try and experiment with that $100.

199
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:52,160
Why not?

200
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:54,560
Let's see how much you can get done with Linode.

201
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:58,320
They've been around for 18 years, and they're a big supporter of community initiatives as

202
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,320
well.

203
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:02,760

206
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:14,080
Linode.com slash LAN.

207
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:18,560
This episode of Linux Action News is also made possible by Ting.

208
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:19,560
Linux.ting.com.

209
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:22,760
You'll see how much you could save and then take $25 off of that.

210
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:27,040
Ting's secret sauce is truly they didn't have to dig the holes and put the cell towers up

211
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:28,040
themselves.

212
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:30,080
They're a mobile virtual network operator.

213
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:35,160
That means Ting gets access to all of the big carrier networks, but at a way better

214
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:36,160
rate.

215
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:39,800
And they can add great customer service on top of that.

216
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:44,640
As a customer, what it means for you, a great mix of plans and coverage at better rates

217
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:47,200
with way, way superior service.

218
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:49,540
Like I'm talking the interface to manage your account.

219
00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:54,080
You could basically do everything you would ever need to do with your Ting account through

220
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:55,080
their website.

221
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:57,420
And the customer support is the best in the business.

222
00:14:57,420 --> 00:14:59,940
And the nice thing about Ting is they got a mix of different networks.

223
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:03,380
So it's very likely you're gonna be able to find coverage wherever you need.

224
00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:06,540
And you can contact their customer support and tell them, hey, I'm gonna be going in

225
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:07,540
this area.

226
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:11,480
So I need a SIM card that works the best for this area, and they take care of it.

227
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:13,000
It's so simple.

228
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,960
And every plan gets access to the LTE and 5G coverage.

229
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:20,200
So lots of data you can go through if that's your thing.

230
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:24,280
They also have plans for those of you who are very data savvy, you'd be surprised how

231
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:25,280
much you could save.

232
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:29,640
I mean, they have like their Ting set 12 plan, it's 35 bucks a month.

233
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:35,600
You get 12 gigs of data and unlimited talk and unlimited texts for 35 bucks a month.

234
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:39,720
Like if you're savvy with syncing your podcast in your music before you jump in the car or

235
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:42,840
something like that, that's a great deal.

236
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:46,520
But no matter how much data you need, or maybe you want a family plan, they've got stuff

237
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:47,520
that's gonna cover you.

238
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:49,360
I mean, they've got plans for everything.

239
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:52,760
That's why it's so great that it's simple to switch to Ting, because pretty much any

240
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:55,680
phone will already work since they support a ton of networks.

241
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:57,640
So just go try it out and get started.

242
00:15:57,640 --> 00:16:03,180
You go to linux.ting.com, you check your current phone out, they got a really nice UI for that.

243
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:05,860
If everything's looking right, you create an account, you pick the plan that's right

244
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:09,600
for you, Ting will shoot you a SIM card, you pop that in your phone and you're gonna get

245
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,160
activated in minutes.

246
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:13,960
And once you get all set up, be sure to check out the Ting blog, they're always posting

247
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:16,840
about giveaways or tips to use the network.

248
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:19,720
It's so simple now with Ting to cut your phone bill in half.

249
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:22,920
There's no reason you should be paying so much for wireless anymore.

250
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:26,580
Go see how much you could save and then take $25 off of that.

251
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:30,480
And you can support the show at linux.ting.com.

252
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:32,440
There's never been a better time to try Ting Mobile.

253
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:37,440
I can say that because I've been a customer since 2013 and Ting just keeps getting better.

254
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:40,000
Go support the show and see how much you could save.

255
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:46,520
linux.ting.com Gnome 41 was released this week.

256
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:50,440
It's the second release to use Gnome's new number versioning scheme.

257
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:56,760
And while perhaps not the big change that Gnome 40 was, there are still plenty of improvements

258
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:57,760
packed in.

259
00:16:57,760 --> 00:17:02,640
Gnome Software Center received a considerable amount of attention this time around.

260
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:08,980
Nearly every part of Gnome software was polished or improved in some way, including a new visual

261
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:12,920
overhaul with significantly improved application listings.

262
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:17,560
Oh, Wes, the new Gnome software application listings look so much better now.

263
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:21,760
They've added what they call context tiles to app pages that they just give the user

264
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:26,840
more information about the device support, the permissions it might need, age rating,

265
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:30,640
if you care about that kind of thing, file size, which I always care about and more.

266
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:34,840
It's all just really displayed in a clean, easy to read format.

267
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:40,240
Along with that kind of stuff, you also get a list of available add-ons if your app has

268
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:41,240
them.

269
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:44,360
So like say GIMP might have a bunch of plugins you can install from Gnome software.

270
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:47,880
They all get listed right there on one page, so you can install your app and all of its

271
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:50,000
add-ons now in one go.

272
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:56,120
Outside of Gnome software, the new multitasking options are nice to see as well.

273
00:17:56,120 --> 00:18:00,720
You can now toggle off Gnome's hot corner for the activities overview, something I know

274
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:05,480
a lot of you out there previously used an extension to achieve.

275
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:10,680
On top of that, they now let you tweak the settings for resizing applications and what

276
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:14,440
happens when you slam them against the edge of the screen.

277
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:18,240
Also nice to see is some settings that you used to have to dig around in Gnome tweaks

278
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:19,240
to find.

279
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:24,080
Those have been moved into the multitasking settings, things like choosing between fixed

280
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:26,480
and dynamic workspaces.

281
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:32,040
And I know you were really happy to see this one added, Chris, new options for how workspaces

282
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:34,760
behave when you have multiple monitors.

283
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:36,340
We really wanted to see this.

284
00:18:36,340 --> 00:18:38,000
This is, this is great.

285
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:44,160
It was a major pain point for some with the transition to Gnome 40 and the new horizontal

286
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:45,160
workspaces.

287
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:50,520
Now users can choose if workspaces are only on the primary display or if all monitors

288
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:51,880
have workspaces.

289
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:53,240
That's great.

290
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:58,320
And one of the significant areas of improvements in Gnome 41 is the power mode feature.

291
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:01,300
The early version of this was introduced in Gnome 40.

292
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:05,720
But now in Gnome 41, it's like a premium feature.

293
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:09,140
Power modes can now be quickly changed from the system status menu, which I used to have

294
00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:11,080
to install an extension for.

295
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:15,840
And nice to see this too, they will automatically enable the power saver mode of power modes

296
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:18,600
when your battery runs low.

297
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:24,160
Power has also been added for applications to request a specific power mode, something

298
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:27,000
that maybe a game would do because it really needs performance.

299
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Yeah.

300
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Or maybe your video editor.

301
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:33,840
And a nice little quality of life aspect of this feature is power modes are sometimes

302
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:34,840
disabled.

303
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:35,840
Now stick with me here.

304
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:40,220
They're sometimes disabled depending on your system's hardware support.

305
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:45,060
So sometimes like in my case of testing, they were temporarily disabled because of a thermal

306
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:46,760
issue on my laptop.

307
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:50,200
Or on some systems, if you just don't support it at all, they won't show up.

308
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:52,200
They just won't show up in Gnome settings.

309
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:56,200
I once saw a warning during my testing that said they will be disabled.

310
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:59,480
Power modes will be disabled until you put it on the table.

311
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:01,160
You got to get it out of your lap and put it on the table.

312
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:02,800
I don't exactly know why.

313
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:05,320
I would assume it had something to do with airflow.

314
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:09,880
Another time I was told that power modes would be disabled until the temperature of my laptop

315
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:11,800
was down to safe levels.

316
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:13,040
And honestly, I think that kind of makes sense.

317
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:17,200
I mean, I don't want to turn on performance mode and cook my laptop, but just, I mean,

318
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:20,960
personally, I think it was great to see the Gnome developers play around with this deep

319
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:23,040
level of integration with the system.

320
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:27,580
That's kind of like the new mobile network settings, which also only show up when you

321
00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:30,060
have hardware that supports them.

322
00:20:30,060 --> 00:20:35,960
This helps keep the complexity down on systems that don't have, say, a fancy LTE modem.

323
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:41,840
41 also introduces the Gnome Connections app, which is an efficient tool that lets you connect

324
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:47,280
to most remote desktop protocols in a clean, easy-to-manage UI.

325
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:51,340
And 41 sees the introduction of LibAdueda, which lays the groundwork for a new approach

326
00:20:51,340 --> 00:20:57,380
to styling Gnome apps in the future and will have significant implications in Gnome 42.

327
00:20:57,380 --> 00:21:00,720
For more details on that, see Linux Unplugged 4.24.

328
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:05,720
It's worth noting the new Gnome release also comes with significant improvements for developers,

329
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:10,360
including a new developer documentation website, a major update to the human interface guidelines,

330
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:15,000
new features in the builder IDE, GTK4 enhancements, and really a lot more, Wes.

331
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:19,600
It should also be said that there are also the usual performance improvements and bug

332
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:25,000
fixes to make Gnome faster, as well as more stable, reliable, and flexible, believe it

333
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
or not.

334
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:30,200
For example, the screen will now update faster on Wayland in response to keyboard and pointer

335
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:35,200
input, the system-level multi-touch gestures are now more consistent and reliable, and

336
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:42,940
a new default GL renderer in GTK4 provides faster rendering and reduced power consumption.

337
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:48,480
And finally, a major code cleanup has been carried out in Mudder, Gnome's window manager,

338
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:53,960
which really should help improve long-term maintainability and efficiency.

339
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:54,960
That's great to see.

340
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:59,120
It is, and it's always nice to address technical debt, as we talked about earlier in the show.

341
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:02,640
I have to say, this, they nailed it.

342
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:07,080
The new multitasking settings and options, really that addressed my major concerns with

343
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:11,000
horizontal workspaces, and I bet a lot of folks out there that had concerns.

344
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:14,760
This is, 41's worth trying now, I think they may have fixed it for you.

345
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:20,480
I spent the last week in Gnome 41, and I think this is a fantastic release.

346
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:24,880
If you're a happy Gnome user today, you're gonna get even more of what you already love

347
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:25,880
with Gnome 41.

348
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:30,080
Yeah, it may not be for everyone, but if you wanna get your hands on it, you're gonna see

349
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:34,240
it land pretty soon in Fedora 35, which will be out in about a month.

350
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:38,200
That ships with Gnome 41 out of the box, but if you just can't wait, we've got a link to

351
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:43,280
Fedora 35's beta in the show notes, and we'll keep an eye on that development and everything

352
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:47,560
