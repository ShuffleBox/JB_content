Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, our weekly take on Linux and the open source world.

00:15.960 --> 00:20.680
This is episode 23, recorded on October 15th, 2017.

00:20.680 --> 00:21.680
I'm Chris.

00:21.680 --> 00:22.680
And I'm Joe.

00:22.680 --> 00:23.680
Hello, Joe.

00:23.680 --> 00:24.680
It's good to be with you again.

00:24.680 --> 00:28.240
We have so many things to get into, a good range of topics today.

00:28.240 --> 00:31.680
Let's start with one that affects a lot of us that use Steam under Linux, and that's

00:31.680 --> 00:35.160
sort of like hodgepodge mismatched support for different games.

00:35.160 --> 00:38.120
And sometimes they rely on outdated libraries.

00:38.120 --> 00:41.480
And sometimes when you try to use native libraries, things don't work quite well.

00:41.480 --> 00:44.800
And we've just been waiting for somebody to come along and potentially solve this mess

00:44.800 --> 00:45.800
of a problem.

00:45.800 --> 00:50.320
Well, Solus has been the go to platform for a lot of Steam users on Linux, I understand,

00:50.320 --> 00:54.120
because iKey has been really pushing the envelope in that area.

00:54.120 --> 00:58.520
And now, thanks to snaps, it's getting a little bit easier to do that.

00:58.520 --> 00:59.520
You mentioned snaps.

00:59.520 --> 01:00.800
Let's talk about base snaps.

01:00.800 --> 01:04.200
This is something new as of SnapD 2.28.

01:04.200 --> 01:09.340
I'm not an expert in this, but I'll reframe the conversation to give you a perspective.

01:09.340 --> 01:13.400
Let's say you created an application that, for whatever reason, really just runs on Fedora

01:13.400 --> 01:14.840
25.

01:14.840 --> 01:18.880
And a use case comes up where you need to run that on Arch Linux.

01:18.880 --> 01:24.480
You can now create a snap of the application and a base snap of Fedora 25.

01:24.480 --> 01:27.400
That's sort of like a Fedora 25 runtime environment.

01:27.400 --> 01:31.520
Now, if you're on a system that doesn't have that runtime environment, you can have this

01:31.520 --> 01:35.240
application snap that requires that base.

01:35.240 --> 01:38.680
And it pulls it down and installs it, and the application runs as expected.

01:38.680 --> 01:43.120
But if you were to install that same snap on a Fedora 25 system, it wouldn't necessarily

01:43.120 --> 01:44.240
need that base snap.

01:44.240 --> 01:46.160
So they can be separate pieces.

01:46.160 --> 01:52.080
And what Solus is doing is they're creating the Linux Steam integration project using

01:52.080 --> 01:57.360
a strict Linux Stream integration intercept module, which sounds like a ninja move.

01:57.360 --> 02:02.900
Yeah, and it means that every other distribution that's using snaps can benefit from the work

02:02.900 --> 02:06.240
that iKey and the rest of the Solus team have put in.

02:06.240 --> 02:11.120
And now it means that you know Steam is going to work 100% on any distro with snaps.

02:11.120 --> 02:12.840
So will developers end up targeting this?

02:12.840 --> 02:13.840
Who knows?

02:13.840 --> 02:14.840
It's early days right now.

02:14.840 --> 02:16.880
But actually, I can say this.

02:16.880 --> 02:21.760
This is doubling down on what Solus has been great at, fixing problems around Steam and

02:21.760 --> 02:26.160
then doing it in a way that solves it once and for all and makes it available for all

02:26.160 --> 02:27.440
Linux distributions.

02:27.440 --> 02:32.520
And I really want to underscore that point is both this and their previous Steam work

02:32.520 --> 02:36.880
feels like the type of design work that goes into this, the type of design work that makes

02:36.880 --> 02:40.600
this a problem solved for once type thing.

02:40.600 --> 02:46.880
And that's going to result in easier, better gameplay on Linux if this is successful.

02:46.880 --> 02:48.440
So that's why I think it's worth looking at.

02:48.440 --> 02:50.480
If you haven't seen it yet, we'll have a link in the show notes.

02:50.480 --> 02:55.320
Go over to linuxactionnews.com slash 23.

02:55.320 --> 02:57.160
And you'll see it's one of our top links.

02:57.160 --> 02:58.160
Read about it.

02:58.160 --> 03:01.680
And you can get it going on your distribution now if you support snaps, which you probably

03:01.680 --> 03:02.680
do.

03:02.680 --> 03:05.320
Yeah, it's almost like Valve should have done this in the first place.

03:05.320 --> 03:08.120
But it's been left to the community and the community has stepped up.

03:08.120 --> 03:12.440
So yeah, well done Ikea and Solus for pushing that forward.

03:12.440 --> 03:14.360
So you mentioned Fedora in there.

03:14.360 --> 03:18.480
Well Fedora Workstation 27 is going to have AAC support.

03:18.480 --> 03:23.760
Well kind of AAC is the modern replacement for mp3.

03:23.760 --> 03:25.320
No one's using mp3 anymore, right?

03:25.320 --> 03:27.840
Hang on, you're listening to one now.

03:27.840 --> 03:33.000
But if the Fraunhofer organization had to be believed, then mp3 is dead and AAC is the

03:33.000 --> 03:34.000
future.

03:34.000 --> 03:38.520
So I suppose it's a very good thing that Fedora is going to be supporting it.

03:38.520 --> 03:43.960
But I say kind of because it's not every single implementation of it.

03:43.960 --> 03:49.120
But at least some AAC files will now play going forward in Fedora.

03:49.120 --> 03:53.280
My takeaway is the most common AAC files will be supported by Fedora.

03:53.280 --> 03:56.060
This is based on an implementation released by Google.

03:56.060 --> 03:58.440
And one of the things that Fedora is doing here that's kind of nice is they're also going

03:58.440 --> 04:00.520
to be releasing GStreamer plugins.

04:00.520 --> 04:05.140
So applications that use the GStreamer playback engine will just get AAC support once you

04:05.140 --> 04:06.640
go to Fedora 27.

04:06.640 --> 04:08.640
No additional work required.

04:08.640 --> 04:13.220
This change does not mean that you can package and ship any AAC implementation you want in

04:13.220 --> 04:14.220
Fedora though.

04:14.220 --> 04:17.000
You will have to look into their specific implementation here.

04:17.000 --> 04:19.000
Yeah, it's kind of future proofing, isn't it?

04:19.000 --> 04:23.560
Because mp3 is still around for now, but it might not be forever.

04:23.560 --> 04:27.720
They also tease Joe that there may be more other major quote unquote codec announcements

04:27.720 --> 04:28.720
soon.

04:28.720 --> 04:29.720
So stay tuned.

04:29.720 --> 04:30.720
Yeah.

04:30.720 --> 04:31.720
I wonder what's coming there.

04:31.720 --> 04:32.720
Hmm.

04:32.720 --> 04:33.720
Hmm.

04:33.720 --> 04:34.720
I doubt it's anything really.

04:34.720 --> 04:40.360
I have to say at this point, if we have mp3 and AAC, I think that pretty much covers all

04:40.360 --> 04:44.000
of the proprietary audio codecs, but maybe I'll be proven wrong.

04:44.000 --> 04:45.440
Maybe it's video.

04:45.440 --> 04:46.440
That would be very cool.

04:46.440 --> 04:47.440
That would be very cool.

04:47.440 --> 04:48.440
All right.

04:48.440 --> 04:53.680
Well, you have had all sorts of problems with GNOME in the studio and people keep suggesting

04:53.680 --> 04:56.440
various replacements for it.

04:56.440 --> 05:01.880
And you have said to me that you want to have one desktop environment, one unified experience

05:01.880 --> 05:03.520
across all your machines.

05:03.520 --> 05:05.920
Well, how about plasma 5.11?

05:05.920 --> 05:10.960
Yeah, the new release by our friends over at KDE.

05:10.960 --> 05:13.140
Plasma 5.11 has a bunch of new features.

05:13.140 --> 05:19.480
Probably the most standout ones are the settings app and the most popular one is improved notifications,

05:19.480 --> 05:20.480
including notification history.

05:20.480 --> 05:23.840
I didn't realize how popular that was until I started getting emails about it.

05:23.840 --> 05:25.520
I like the new task manager.

05:25.520 --> 05:28.320
I think that's maybe my favorite new feature.

05:28.320 --> 05:34.760
And this release also includes the new vault system, which, quote, allows users to encrypt

05:34.760 --> 05:38.120
open sets of documents in a secure and user-friendly way.

05:38.120 --> 05:40.640
So that might be something I have to play with as well.

05:40.640 --> 05:42.360
And it lets you hide them away as well.

05:42.360 --> 05:46.080
So if someone comes to your machine, they don't even know those files are there necessarily.

05:46.080 --> 05:47.080
Yeah.

05:47.080 --> 05:48.080
Yeah, that is nice.

05:48.080 --> 05:49.080
Yeah.

05:49.080 --> 05:52.280
I think that is probably, I just got to read up on how it's implemented.

05:52.280 --> 05:55.440
And I like so many things about the plasma desktop, Joe.

05:55.440 --> 05:56.440
So many things about it.

05:56.440 --> 06:01.120
But yet, it feels like more than what I need for my day-to-day desktop.

06:01.120 --> 06:05.960
And there's still some visual inconsistencies for me that I find to be distracting.

06:05.960 --> 06:12.280
And on top of that, I almost need, what would be perfect is if somebody could rebase the

06:12.280 --> 06:17.520
Neon Projects desktop in this really perfectly set up environment and then lock it all down

06:17.520 --> 06:18.940
so I can't change it.

06:18.940 --> 06:21.400
Because otherwise, I just sit there and fiddle with it all day long.

06:21.400 --> 06:23.280
And I would never get any podcasting done, Joe.

06:23.280 --> 06:27.680
Well, you know there is such a thing as self-control, where you just don't go into the settings

06:27.680 --> 06:28.680
and change things.

06:28.680 --> 06:29.680
Mm-hmm.

06:29.680 --> 06:30.680
Yeah, yeah.

06:30.680 --> 06:31.680
I've heard that before.

06:31.680 --> 06:33.920
I'm not familiar with it, but I've heard that before.

06:33.920 --> 06:40.480
So they have something sort of in play, I will say, for 5.12.

06:40.480 --> 06:44.940
And I think if they don't nail this, then they're going to miss the boat.

06:44.940 --> 06:50.160
And so I would encourage everybody who wants to see Plasma better on Wayland to get involved.

06:50.160 --> 06:54.800
Because they're shooting for an awesome release on Wayland with Plasma 5.12.

06:54.800 --> 07:00.600
And the elephant in the room is that 5.12 is due to be the long-term support version

07:00.600 --> 07:01.840
of the Plasma desktop.

07:01.840 --> 07:04.640
So it's kind of important to nail the Wayland support on this one.

07:04.640 --> 07:08.920
Yeah, it would have been kind of important to nail it pre that, you would have thought.

07:08.920 --> 07:14.320
Like Ubuntu are doing with 17.10, they're getting Wayland in there one release before

07:14.320 --> 07:15.320
the LTS.

07:15.320 --> 07:16.320
You might think that.

07:16.320 --> 07:17.320
Yeah.

07:17.320 --> 07:22.120
And it's getting there, slightly but surely, but as you say, this is very important for

07:22.120 --> 07:23.120
them.

07:23.120 --> 07:26.280
As the LTS, they need to get Wayland working properly.

07:26.280 --> 07:32.480
So it's no wonder that the K-Win maintainer, Martin Fleurza, I think, has put out this

07:32.480 --> 07:38.340
call to get people to test it, and hack on it, and contribute, and just make sure that

07:38.340 --> 07:40.080
Wayland is working well.

07:40.080 --> 07:45.640
Because we seem to be moving very rapidly towards a post-X world at this point.

07:45.640 --> 07:48.780
Yeah, I mean, that definitely seems to be a lot of the ducks, as they say, are getting

07:48.780 --> 07:50.260
lined up.

07:50.260 --> 07:55.200
But I do feel like this will be looked back on as an effort that was implemented too little,

07:55.200 --> 07:59.800
too late, because I feel one of the things we are learning very hard with Wayland right

07:59.800 --> 08:06.240
now is scale and use cases, like esoteric use cases, like edge cases, I guess would

08:06.240 --> 08:09.340
be the phrase, are really what make the difference.

08:09.340 --> 08:12.920
And until you have a lot of those, and until you have hundreds of thousands, if not millions

08:12.920 --> 08:16.240
of those, you're not really testing Wayland.

08:16.240 --> 08:22.680
And so the sooner that these projects get this code into people's hands for testing,

08:22.680 --> 08:25.980
the more and more esoteric edge cases get pushed.

08:25.980 --> 08:32.240
And I was sitting in a room, not to keep going back to this, in New York at the Ubuntu rally,

08:32.240 --> 08:39.560
where they were pulling up the bug tracker for Wayland, and it's hitting historical landmarkers

08:39.560 --> 08:44.240
for the Ubuntu project, in number of bugs being submitted to the project in the entire

08:44.240 --> 08:46.520
history of Ubuntu.

08:46.520 --> 08:51.120
Because they, by right now, just having people beta testing 17.10, have more people using

08:51.120 --> 08:54.800
Wayland than apparently have been ever using Wayland before.

08:54.800 --> 08:57.920
And they're discovering so many more bugs because of that.

08:57.920 --> 09:05.280
So it's quaint to suggest that a niche of the Plasma Desktop users should try really

09:05.280 --> 09:12.260
hard to make Wayland support great in 5.12, and it's an admirable attempt.

09:12.260 --> 09:17.760
It is much too little, and it is much too late, because of their small scale, they should

09:17.760 --> 09:22.400
have been testing this stuff maybe a year ago, but the ducks weren't in a row yet.

09:22.400 --> 09:26.200
So we will get what we will get, and that'll be the LTS.

09:26.200 --> 09:29.420
Well, this week KDE turned 21, if you can believe that.

09:29.420 --> 09:30.640
It's been around for that long.

09:30.640 --> 09:35.600
And looking back at the screenshots of the various versions of it, you can see it started

09:35.600 --> 09:40.440
out looking very much like old-school Windows, and you can see the progression, and you can

09:40.440 --> 09:46.260
see, I think the leap from 4.0 to 5.0 was really a big step.

09:46.260 --> 09:53.480
And for me, pre-Plasma 5.0, it was not really relevant to me, whereas looking at some of

09:53.480 --> 09:59.780
the early versions of that, and now it's maturing and we're getting towards this 5.12 LTS,

09:59.780 --> 10:04.640
it's really come into its own, and I've stopped hating it, put it that way.

10:04.640 --> 10:08.800
Yeah, October 14th, 1996, 21 years ago.

10:08.800 --> 10:14.840
So now, if anyone ever asks you to define what does slow and steady pace mean, you can

10:14.840 --> 10:21.880
say 21 years of slowly but steadily getting there.

10:21.880 --> 10:23.640

11:40.520 --> 11:44.600
One of the long-running problems on Linux has been updating firmware, and it's often

11:44.600 --> 11:50.480
meant having to boot into a Windows partition or some sort of DOS environment.

11:50.480 --> 11:57.920
But thanks to fwupd, I don't know how you pronounce it, firmware update basically, that

11:57.920 --> 12:03.720
is getting a lot easier in Linux, and they have reached the milestone of a 1.0 release.

12:03.720 --> 12:06.960
This is one of those projects that really makes Linux feel like a full-fledged desktop

12:06.960 --> 12:07.960
citizen.

12:07.960 --> 12:11.400
You open up your software update, and right in there at the top, there's a firmware update.

12:11.400 --> 12:16.760
I remember when there was like a mistake or a vulnerability in the Intel microcode recently.

12:16.760 --> 12:18.600
I think that's what it was.

12:18.600 --> 12:23.040
There's so many zero days these days, but I remember I opened up software update on

12:23.040 --> 12:28.360
my Dell XPS 13, and boom, there it was right there, months I think before Windows had even

12:28.360 --> 12:29.360
had it.

12:29.360 --> 12:35.320
Now fwupd supports 72 different kinds of hardware, so from low-level firmware in your laptop

12:35.320 --> 12:43.560
to Logitech multi-receivers, and this is done through a combination of fwupd and the Linux

12:43.560 --> 12:47.920
vendor firmware project, which is the interface that the companies work with to submit the

12:47.920 --> 12:49.640
firmware and get it distributed.

12:49.640 --> 12:53.540
Behind the scenes, it's all pretty easy stuff for them.

12:53.540 --> 12:57.240
It's even using Microsoft cab files to distribute the stuff.

12:57.240 --> 13:02.260
They're making it as easy as possible for these vendors, and huge portions of the project

13:02.260 --> 13:08.400
have been contributed by Dell and other vendors, and version 1.0 represents a pretty big change.

13:08.400 --> 13:11.800
There's an ABI breakage, they've removed a lot of cruft, and they've rebuilt a lot of

13:11.800 --> 13:17.780
things, renamed things to the more appropriate naming scheme, all that kind of good stuff,

13:17.780 --> 13:22.680
but they're going to maintain the 0.9 version for quite a while.

13:22.680 --> 13:27.680
So if you're on current versions of Fedora, you're going to actually see Fedora ship 0.9

13:27.680 --> 13:28.680
for a little while.

13:28.680 --> 13:31.880
Well, that's still being maintained by the project, so there are going to be two versions

13:31.880 --> 13:35.400
maintained by the project for a bit while they make this transition.

13:35.400 --> 13:36.400
Such a great project, Joe.

13:36.400 --> 13:41.080
Yeah, and it's great to see that they are going to maintain 0.9 because rather than

13:41.080 --> 13:45.160
just abandoning that and going on with the new and shiny, they realize that that is just

13:45.160 --> 13:46.800
something that they have to do.

13:46.800 --> 13:51.680
Yeah, they were able to do that without any user metrics, without doing deep data analysis

13:51.680 --> 13:56.000
on their users' activities, unlike other companies.

13:56.000 --> 13:57.000
Other companies?

13:57.000 --> 13:58.000
Hmm, what, like OnePlus?

13:58.000 --> 14:03.720
Yeah, yeah, it's not really a good, FWUpdate's not really a company, but you get my gist.

14:03.720 --> 14:10.800
Yeah, so OnePlus have been collecting way more data than they should have been from

14:10.800 --> 14:19.640
their users' phones, including IMEI numbers, MAC addresses, mobile network names, serial

14:19.640 --> 14:23.640
numbers, and potentially even a bit more than that.

14:23.640 --> 14:29.000
And okay, they were being sent back over HTTPS, which is kind of good because often these

14:29.000 --> 14:33.080
things will just be plain text, which is never a good thing.

14:33.080 --> 14:39.240
And you can opt out of it if you go into the settings, but on by default and some of the

14:39.240 --> 14:42.840
stuff you can't opt out from, it's not a good look for OnePlus.

14:42.840 --> 14:47.300
And it makes me feel very happy that the first thing I did when I bought my 3T was flash

14:47.300 --> 14:48.580
lineage on it.

14:48.580 --> 14:49.580
Good point.

14:49.580 --> 14:52.680
This only affects the Oxygen OS that ships on these OnePlus devices.

14:52.680 --> 14:55.860
So if you've wiped it, then you're already away from this.

14:55.860 --> 14:59.560
But something that struck me about this entire situation is they said they're going to dial

14:59.560 --> 15:04.320
it back a bit, but it sounds like they're just going to dial back some of the more identifiable

15:04.320 --> 15:07.000
stuff and still collect a lot of metrics.

15:07.000 --> 15:08.960
Some of this stuff I don't have an issue with.

15:08.960 --> 15:13.620
When the phone reboots, when it updates, that makes sense to me.

15:13.620 --> 15:17.960
How often you run an app, when you wake it up, when you check the time.

15:17.960 --> 15:22.440
These types of metrics, I'm less and less comfortable with that.

15:22.440 --> 15:26.280
And I would like companies to start rethinking data collection because OnePlus's defense

15:26.280 --> 15:29.240
is we would never share this information.

15:29.240 --> 15:31.680
We would never sell this information.

15:31.680 --> 15:35.140
And my thinking is what happens if you get compromised?

15:35.140 --> 15:37.020
What happens when you get bought?

15:37.020 --> 15:41.440
What happens if in two years from now you come up with a new revenue idea and you create

15:41.440 --> 15:45.340
a new partnership and all of a sudden they get access to this data?

15:45.340 --> 15:47.240
That's what I think about.

15:47.240 --> 15:50.380
And I want them to consider that.

15:50.380 --> 15:51.960
And I guess maybe I'm asking too much.

15:51.960 --> 15:56.200
But if you can't give me a satisfactory answer, then don't collect the data.

15:56.200 --> 15:57.640
Just don't collect it.

15:57.640 --> 15:59.600
Or have it be an option in the setup.

15:59.600 --> 16:05.680
Do you want to help us out by giving us these metrics and let people tick the box or at

16:05.680 --> 16:08.160
least untick it, maybe.

16:08.160 --> 16:12.440
But don't have it on by default and then only when you get busted for doing it, tell people

16:12.440 --> 16:13.440
how to turn it off.

16:13.440 --> 16:14.440
Right.

16:14.440 --> 16:18.160
And doesn't it sound like they are going to update a few interface things to make it easier

16:18.160 --> 16:24.280
to opt out and they will stop collecting telephone numbers, MAC addresses, and Wi-Fi information

16:24.280 --> 16:26.920
eventually, by the end of October, I think they said.

16:26.920 --> 16:28.520
So that's some improvement, yeah?

16:28.520 --> 16:31.120
Well for new phones that they sell, certainly.

16:31.120 --> 16:34.960
And whether or not they'll do it for the old ones, let's hope so.

16:34.960 --> 16:40.640
It just makes me think, as I said, I'm so glad that I didn't use OxygenOS.

16:40.640 --> 16:45.680
Even though I hear it's a little bit faster than Lineage on the 3T, but just not interested

16:45.680 --> 16:46.680
in it.

16:46.680 --> 16:49.920
You know what we really need, Joe, is we need a phone that respects our privacy, a privacy

16:49.920 --> 16:54.720
focused smartphone that can withstand the test of credibility by virtue of true community

16:54.720 --> 16:57.680
ownership and audibility of the code.

16:57.680 --> 16:58.680
We need a hero.

16:58.680 --> 16:59.680
Yeah.

16:59.680 --> 17:01.680
Well, let's talk about this for the first time ever.

17:01.680 --> 17:07.360
And the Purism Librem 5, they've done such a good job of promoting this.

17:07.360 --> 17:10.600
I cannot believe that anyone wouldn't know what it is, but I suppose we should explain

17:10.600 --> 17:12.160
it a little bit.

17:12.160 --> 17:18.880
So this is a crowdfunded five inch smartphone that is going to run proper GNU slash Linux.

17:18.880 --> 17:24.520
It's going to have a CPU that is separate from the baseband so it can run totally free

17:24.520 --> 17:31.160
software and you can completely turn off the radio for it, the mobile connection.

17:31.160 --> 17:35.040
And it's going to be totally free software, at least in theory.

17:35.040 --> 17:41.000
And so they did this campaign, which most people thought, huh, not a chance, $1.5 million.

17:41.000 --> 17:42.640
They'll never get there.

17:42.640 --> 17:47.080
But here we are and they've done it.

17:47.080 --> 17:49.400
They've smashed through the $1.5 million.

17:49.400 --> 17:50.960
This thing is happening.

17:50.960 --> 17:51.960
Yeah.

17:51.960 --> 17:56.840
And it came sort of in a surprising way, a couple of huge contributions there at the

17:56.840 --> 17:58.260
last moment.

17:58.260 --> 18:04.400
And as we record this episode right now, they've not only gone over their milestone, like what

18:04.400 --> 18:07.720
they wanted to achieve, but now they're going for stretch goals.

18:07.720 --> 18:13.520
They've raised $1.7 million and they still have eight days left to go.

18:13.520 --> 18:17.380
So that's 114.84% funded at this point.

18:17.380 --> 18:20.040
But now the real hard part starts.

18:20.040 --> 18:24.160
They've only got 1.7, they might get to 2 million.

18:24.160 --> 18:28.040
That's not a lot of money to produce a smartphone from scratch, is it?

18:28.040 --> 18:31.360
And the OS that goes on it and the applications that run on that OS.

18:31.360 --> 18:36.160
See, this is really what I'm concerned about because it all seems like the hard part now.

18:36.160 --> 18:38.840
It seems like building the hardware is the hard part.

18:38.840 --> 18:43.320
It seems like creating an operating system that's actually usable on a touchscreen device

18:43.320 --> 18:44.320
is the hard part.

18:44.320 --> 18:48.200
Integrating matrix calling so that way it feels like a first class phone call and text

18:48.200 --> 18:50.920
messaging experience feels like the hard part.

18:50.920 --> 18:55.280
And then figuring out a way to manufacture enough of these devices and ship them to the

18:55.280 --> 18:59.360
backers in a time that you have committed to, that seems like that could be maybe the

18:59.360 --> 19:00.360
hard part.

19:00.360 --> 19:03.880
Well, except that they have given themselves till 2019 to ship it.

19:03.880 --> 19:09.280
So they have given themselves over a year, kind of two years really.

19:09.280 --> 19:12.880
So I'm not necessarily worried about the timescale.

19:12.880 --> 19:19.440
I'm more worried about whether that money is going to stretch far enough to do the R&D

19:19.440 --> 19:24.760
as well as actually ship the product because it's going to cost them at least like $200

19:24.760 --> 19:25.920
per phone to make it.

19:25.920 --> 19:29.560
You would have thought maybe even more than that.

19:29.560 --> 19:31.280
And then they've got to send it out.

19:31.280 --> 19:33.120
That's like another $20 or whatever.

19:33.120 --> 19:39.440
And so really the amount of money that they've got to spend on the R&D is minimal.

19:39.440 --> 19:40.440
That's a pretty good point.

19:40.440 --> 19:44.400
If you think about two years or so and building phones, especially your first batch is going

19:44.400 --> 19:51.160
to be your most expensive run, yeah, that 1.5 million or so, I guess now it's actually

19:51.160 --> 19:54.840
1.7 million, is not that much money.

19:54.840 --> 19:59.240
Now in the meantime, they may have a growing success with their laptop business.

19:59.240 --> 20:04.360
I just reviewed the Librem 15 in Linux Unplugged 218.

20:04.360 --> 20:10.160
And after a couple of attempts, they've now I think got a very competitive laptop on their

20:10.160 --> 20:13.440
hands on every sense of that word.

20:13.440 --> 20:18.460
And if that business begins to pick up, that might generate some revenue and perhaps this

20:18.460 --> 20:23.900
crowd funder ends up bridging the gap to get them between the two points.

20:23.900 --> 20:26.460
And that's a risky game.

20:26.460 --> 20:30.480
And I really hope they're successful because the success and excitement around this crowd

20:30.480 --> 20:35.520
funder demonstrates there at least is some appetite for this product in the market.

20:35.520 --> 20:39.280
Even if it's us geeks, there are geeks that have an appetite for this product.

20:39.280 --> 20:40.280
Yeah.

20:40.280 --> 20:43.600
And also you would have thought that this will have probably generated them loads of

20:43.600 --> 20:47.740
free publicity for their laptops because people will have gone to them for the phone having

20:47.740 --> 20:51.940
heard about it and then, oh, they do laptops too that are totally free software.

20:51.940 --> 20:55.160
And so that side of the business might well be doing better as a result of it.

20:55.160 --> 21:01.080
It's not something I'd really thought about, but perhaps that will subsidize the research

21:01.080 --> 21:03.420
and development on the phone.

21:03.420 --> 21:06.760
Another market trend that could be in purism's favor is more and more people are getting

21:06.760 --> 21:09.760
interested in privacy respecting products.

21:09.760 --> 21:13.160
And that's an area where they have some traction and seem to be getting more.

21:13.160 --> 21:18.020
They recently made an announcement that they're signing up a deal with Monero, which is a

21:18.020 --> 21:19.260
mobile payment system.

21:19.260 --> 21:23.080
And when I say Monero, I think it's going to be a payment processor that supports Monero.

21:23.080 --> 21:27.360
But the takeaway message here is no doubt that the Monero project is well known for

21:27.360 --> 21:31.000
being the really truly private cryptocurrency.

21:31.000 --> 21:37.720
It uses a different crypto algorithm than Bitcoin, and it is a truly decentralized privacy

21:37.720 --> 21:44.040
first cryptocurrency that you could exchange with Bitcoin or cash or whatever if you wanted

21:44.040 --> 21:45.040
to.

21:45.040 --> 21:51.240
But it's a good middleman exchange cryptocurrency because it's truly private respecting by default.

21:51.240 --> 21:57.720
Yeah, it doesn't log who you are and how much you spent in the blockchain, which is very

21:57.720 --> 22:02.280
unusual and I think unique in terms of these cryptocurrencies.

22:02.280 --> 22:07.860
So it is very much like cash, unlike Bitcoin where everything is totally traceable.

22:07.860 --> 22:11.520
And if you spend enough time digging through the blockchain, you can work out more or less

22:11.520 --> 22:16.160
who has sent what money to who, whereas with Monero, not so much.

22:16.160 --> 22:21.080
So yeah, they seem to be making the right deals with the right people, don't they?

22:21.080 --> 22:24.440
GNOME, KDE, Matrix, and now Monero.

22:24.440 --> 22:27.640
And the Monero community is pretty excited about it.

22:27.640 --> 22:33.760
I saw a lot of them looking at Purism laptops for the first time ever, thinking, well, now

22:33.760 --> 22:37.680
I can buy a piece of hardware with my hard-earned crypto.

22:37.680 --> 22:43.200
And the Monero is, if you were to peg it to the US dollar, it's somewhere around 100 US

22:43.200 --> 22:44.200
greenbacks right now.

22:44.200 --> 22:45.200
Yeah, I looked earlier.

22:45.200 --> 22:46.200
It was kind of 70-ish.

22:46.200 --> 22:47.200
Oh, really?

22:47.200 --> 22:48.200
Oh, maybe that was 70 pounds.

22:48.200 --> 22:49.200
So yeah, about 100.

22:49.200 --> 22:50.200
Oh, pounds.

22:50.200 --> 22:51.200
Yeah.

22:51.200 --> 22:53.640
Yeah, so it's in that scale.

22:53.640 --> 22:55.840
And that's, of course, all these different cryptocurrencies.

22:55.840 --> 22:58.720
You can buy other cryptocurrencies with each other.

22:58.720 --> 23:05.400
And so people can buy Monero with Bitcoin and then use the Monero for the actual purchase,

23:05.400 --> 23:07.860
which is probably a common use case.

23:07.860 --> 23:10.800
And it's helping sort of seed the Monero community.

23:10.800 --> 23:15.280
And now you have more products like these from Purism coming online.

23:15.280 --> 23:21.080
And it is getting noticed by people that really follow this deep privacy stuff.

23:21.080 --> 23:24.280
Now I guess we just sit back and see what happens with the Librem 5 and see how many

23:24.280 --> 23:25.280
stretch goals they make.

23:25.280 --> 23:27.040
Because they do have some stretch goals they're going for.

23:27.040 --> 23:31.560
Yeah, but the first stretch goal starts at 4 million, which I think is a little bit ambitious.

23:31.560 --> 23:34.040
So we're probably not going to actually see them.

23:34.040 --> 23:36.380
I think it's probably going to get to about 2 million.

23:36.380 --> 23:37.380
I hope you're right.

23:37.380 --> 23:39.040
Because even 2 million would be a good chunk of change.

23:39.040 --> 23:40.040
And the more, the merrier.

23:40.040 --> 23:43.240
Because now that it's been funded, we're all in at this point.

23:43.240 --> 23:44.400
We all want to see this happen.

23:44.400 --> 23:46.120
And there's a lot of excitement around it.

23:46.120 --> 23:50.300
And of course, there's one place you can go to find out when there is something new to

23:50.300 --> 23:52.060
report about this project.

23:52.060 --> 23:53.060
