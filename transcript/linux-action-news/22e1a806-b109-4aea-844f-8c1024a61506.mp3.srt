00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,960
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, episode 192, recorded on June 6th, 2021.

2
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:09,960
I'm Chris.

3
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:10,960
And I'm Wes.

4
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:12,240
Hello, Wes.

5
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:14,480
It's good to be back in the studio with you.

6
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:15,560
Let's do the news.

7
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:19,240
We start this week with some fundamentals.

8
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:26,200
The Grand Unified Bootloader, better known as GRUB, recently added backup and restore

9
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:28,280
functionality.

10
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:33,800
What does that mean, well, as it stands right now, the very first thing GRUB install does

11
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:40,360
when you're getting GRUB set up is pretty much wipe out whatever install you had before.

12
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:42,880
That's bad news if something goes wrong.

13
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:48,120
So after this change, GRUB will first back up whatever modules and other config and settings

14
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:51,600
and important GRUB bits are there, then install.

15
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,720
And if something goes wrong, it's able to restore from that backup.

16
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:58,560
So don't worry if the install goes right, it cleans up afterwards.

17
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:02,000
Hmm, this seems like a pretty essential feature.

18
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,880
And also this week, you XFS file system users got some features in GRUB.

19
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:13,400
GRUB now understands the recent XFS flag for marking file systems that need repair.

20
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:18,040
And it will also print a debug message for the user so you know what's going on.

21
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:22,360
You know, a little bit ago, the developers of XFS took care of this 2038 problem, you

22
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:23,680
know, the future.

23
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:25,520
They made a patch for the future.

24
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:27,360
But GRUB has to also support this.

25
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:32,200
And this recent update of GRUB includes support for the year 2038 problem that XFS developers

26
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:33,200
solved.

27
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:36,640
So you can have your future, your bootloader, and your file system.

28
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:43,160
Jumping up a layer in the stack, our favorite audio and video subsystem got a nice update

29
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:44,160
this week.

30
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:52,400
PipeWire 0.3.29 adds support for old Ubuntu and Debian based distros.

31
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:58,160
So even if you're stuck in the past, your audio and video handling doesn't have to be.

32
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:04,560
Along with a good size list of bug fixes, some real world features landed.

33
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:10,560
Number one for a lot of us doing virtual meetings is WebRTC echo canceling was added.

34
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:14,780
Future versions of PipeWire will do additional integration and justice to this feature.

35
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:19,360
But this is straight up any way you look at it, a quality of life improvement for every

36
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:22,960
single desktop Linux user that is using PipeWire.

37
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:28,480
For Wes and myself, there is some nice improvements like latency reporting that is now implemented

38
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:31,480
and actually represents all the way up into the Jack application.

39
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:33,520
So we're going to use the crap out of that.

40
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:37,020
And there is better handling for multi-channel input profiles.

41
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:42,520
The PipeWire project also mentioned in this release that they've migrated from Freenode

42
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:44,520
to OFTC.net.

43
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:50,320
Overall, just a lot of polish was added this time around, not a ton of new essential core

44
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:54,160
features but a lot of quality of life improvements.

45
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:57,160
And you're right, there are some steady gains around things like WebRTC.

46
00:02:57,160 --> 00:03:01,980
If you take a look at the Git repo, you'll see these features have been brewing for quite

47
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:03,380
some time.

48
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:07,120
But what always takes the longest is that plumbing and porcelain getting hooked up so

49
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:10,680
that you and I can actually take advantage of it.

50
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:15,880
Well going right along with those nice new things, Firefox 89 landed this week.

51
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:19,280
And really the anticipated thing about this release is Proton UI.

52
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:23,940
There are some actual under the hood improvements, but the cleanup of the UI has been the big

53
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:26,560
conversation around the 89 release.

54
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:30,640
The biggest changes are in how tabs appear in the browser and how websites behave while

55
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:32,680
they are in the background.

56
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:40,600
Mozilla says they discovered more than 50% of users have four plus tabs open at all

57
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:44,480
times and use that to help guide the tabs redesign.

58
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:46,480
I don't know, only four?

59
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:49,960
Yeah, I think at least four.

60
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:58,720
All those tabs now float above the URL bar, each one in its own individual rectangle.

61
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:03,000
And while the tabs look different, they still behave the same way.

62
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,280
You can click and drag open tabs to rearrange their order or drag them outside of the tab

63
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:10,000
bar to open a website in a new Firefox window.

64
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,360
And I kind of went to town testing this, playing with it, grouping, you know, control clicking,

65
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:17,400
shift clicking, all of it was pretty snappy and intuitive.

66
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:19,040
I also had to play around with it.

67
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:24,760
And if your distro hasn't updated yet, you can grab Firefox from Flathub, which is published

68
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:27,880
by the Mozilla developers and is very current.

69
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:31,760
And it's a nice way to have the most recent version than whatever your distro ships as

70
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:32,760
well.

71
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:35,160
And I think they knocked it out of the park.

72
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:37,480
I really like the new look.

73
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:38,480
I often do.

74
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:40,880
I'm kind of a sucker for these new things.

75
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:46,480
But I realized after I saw it that this is something that was kind of needed and maybe

76
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:48,240
even sooner than we got it.

77
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,880
But now it's nice to see it here.

78
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:55,080
Also, I really appreciate the way they've, I guess, modified how notifications are displayed,

79
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:56,080
you could say.

80
00:04:56,080 --> 00:05:00,560
So instead of getting like a whole bunch of individual onesie twosies now, they've merged

81
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:04,680
or I guess you could say consolidate all of the pop ups into a single panel.

82
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:08,640
So instead of getting an individual pop up each time, say Zoom wants access to your mic

83
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:13,200
and webcam and then the other permissions, they'll all just be there in one box and you

84
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:15,580
can just say yes, yes or no, no.

85
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:16,580
That's really nice.

86
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:17,580
It makes it a lot quicker.

87
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:21,760
Additionally, iOS and Android users aren't completely left out of the fun.

88
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:26,200
Some of the elements of the redesign have been brought over to the mobile app versions,

89
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:29,660
the Android version seeing the most work done there.

90
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:33,720
And also nice to see web render now enabled on Linux with the Nvidia binary driver on

91
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:35,360
all desktop environments.

92
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:42,760
Well, if you felt a buzz in the air this week, maybe the hair stood up on the back of your

93
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:43,760
neck.

94
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:50,600
That might have been the good news from the Web Extensions Community Group, who announced

95
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:57,840
they're forging a common architecture for future web extensions and is inviting developers

96
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:58,840
to join the effort.

97
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:00,880
But still not beating heart, Wes.

98
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:01,880
We tease.

99
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:03,920
I mean, this actually sounds neat.

100
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:05,520
Yes, it's another web group.

101
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:07,000
Yes, it's another.

102
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,040
It's another like organization to decide standards.

103
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:12,280
But this one seems like it has a real purpose.

104
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:13,760
It's shortened to WigSigGigGig.

105
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:16,440
No, that's not how you say it at all.

106
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:20,800
But it's W-E-C-G and it consists of members from some of the major browser developers

107
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:21,800
you'd expect.

108
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,600
And that's why I think this actually matters.

109
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:27,360
You've got employees there from Apple, you got employees from Mozilla, you got employees

110
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:31,400
from Microsoft and you got contributors from other projects in the open source community,

111
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:36,440
all coming together to talk about how to build a common web extensions community.

112
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:40,680
That common architecture they're going to work on may actually result in something.

113
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:43,500
As for specifics, well, we don't have a ton.

114
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:44,680
This is pretty new.

115
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:50,020
But the Web Extensions Community Group say they've got two main overarching goals.

116
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:56,520
Number one, make extension creation easier for developers by specifying a consistent

117
00:06:56,520 --> 00:07:01,720
model and common core of functionality, APIs and permissions.

118
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:05,840
Sort of a base playing field for all of this new breed of extension.

119
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:11,840
Number two, outline an architecture that enhances performance and is even more secure and resistant

120
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,800
to abuse than what we've got today.

121
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:14,960
Hmm, that's interesting.

122
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:19,680
I also would not be surprised to see Apple be one of the first to message on this just

123
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:24,800
because their WWDC event is the Monday that this comes out actually.

124
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:28,280
And so that is a great platform for them to talk about what they're doing with their Safari

125
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:29,280
browser.

126
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:34,960
We will stream that event with limited snarky commentary at jblive.tv during the WWDC keynote

127
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:36,800
if you'd like to join us.

128
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:41,920
A big official congratulations to Michael Larrable.

129
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:44,800
Congratulations!

130
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:49,520
On June 5th, Ferronix turned 17 years old.

131
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:51,560
Wow, that's amazing.

132
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:55,080
And you got to respect that kind of longevity and is customary at this point, Larrable's

133
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:57,680
offering a discounted membership plan.

134
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:01,960
He notes it has been kind of a tough year for ads on Ferronix.

135
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:06,560
And also, you know, based on the audience that he's targeting, ad block usage remains

136
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,120
pretty, pretty high.

137
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:13,240
Yeah, I'll admit to being one of those offenders sometimes myself.

138
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:18,400
It sure sounds like it has been a bit of a struggle for Larrable and for Ferronix this

139
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:19,780
year.

140
00:08:19,780 --> 00:08:23,920
He noted that ad rates continue to struggle throughout the pandemic, which I know has

141
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:26,400
affected many out there.

142
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:32,560
He also noted that Ferronix really continues to survive right now only through his own

143
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:38,720
relentless 100 plus hour work weeks trying to just make ends meet.

144
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:43,520
That sounds like a dangerous recipe for burnout.

145
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:47,580
You know, over the years, Larrable has gotten in some shade.

146
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:51,600
You know, some people who've pushed back on his reporting, maybe he touched on a nerve,

147
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:56,000
critique something that somebody is really proud of, or, or maybe there was just an accident,

148
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,380
a mistake in his reporting.

149
00:08:57,380 --> 00:08:59,200
Those do happen sometimes.

150
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:03,760
And I feel like the viral nature of comments and the internet have prevented our community

151
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:09,520
from really appreciating kind of the remarkable workhorse that Larrable is and honestly what

152
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:11,480
a resource Ferronix is.

153
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:17,140
And I think when you're really, really deep into Linux news like Wes and I are, you realize

154
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:23,120
that legitimately one of the problems our community faces is that there are only a small

155
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:31,000
handful of original reporting outlets and that pretty much everything else is reporting

156
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,040
on reporting.

157
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:35,300
And that is not healthy.

158
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:40,880
That is not a good way to understand and get a full scope of the free software community.

159
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:46,640
A lot of what gets written about or covered in Linux media at all, be it podcasts or YouTube

160
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:53,380
or written is truly just created by a small, small number of people.

161
00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:57,580
And Larrable is easily one of the top producers in that small group.

162
00:09:57,580 --> 00:09:59,480
He digs deep into kernel stories.

163
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:01,700
He does the tedious benchmarks.

164
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:06,880
He tracks long-term project development and the guy does it seven days a week.

165
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:11,400
There's times when Wes and I are sitting here in the, in the studio recording LAN on a Sunday

166
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:13,680
and Larrable's posting stuff to Ferronix.

167
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:19,940
He's working that seventh day of the week producing content and it's such a resource.

168
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:24,400
And I think it's because it's been around for 17 years and because a lot of us who are

169
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:30,100
consuming news content are pretty removed from the process of creating it.

170
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:35,460
It's not fully appreciated just how vital Ferronix is in the free software information

171
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:36,460
source.

172
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:40,340
You know, we like to talk a lot about how great it is sort of reporting and watching

173
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:45,640
and being a part of the free software ecosystem because so much happens out in the open.

174
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:47,840
But that only counts if people tell you about it.

175
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:51,000
Unless you're following all these mailing lists, you don't really know what's going

176
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,920
on or all the exciting updates happening to grub.

177
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:58,720
In many cases, Michael Larrable is the one following those lists and telling us all about

178
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,400
all the great stuff that's happening.

179
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:01,400
Yeah.

180
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:04,340
And you know, 17 years gives them a history as well.

181
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:08,680
And I think our, I think our community is better off with Ferronix in it.

182
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:14,720
If you'd like to show your support and hopefully allow for a more viable year ahead, consider

183
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:22,000
joining Ferronix Premium, making a PayPal tip or just turning off Adblock.

184
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,360
You know, it's not just his own time here.

185
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:27,280
He's got a great deal of electrical and power expenses.

186
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:31,980
If you've ever seen the crazy benchmarking setups he's got, and of course he's also

187
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:44,600
developing and hosting tools like open benchmarking.

188
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:47,760
Linode is our hosting provider of choice, and that's why we want to recommend them to

189
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:48,800
you guys.

190
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:52,080
Everything we've built over the last couple of years, every single time when we've done

191
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:55,080
an evaluation, Linode has come out on top.

192
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:58,080
Their infrastructure is solid, fast, and flexible.

193
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:01,400
You can focus on your project, not on your infrastructure.

194
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:05,500
You get 11 data centers to choose from and every service level is backed by the best

195
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:08,240
customer support in the business.

196
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:11,920
And when it matters, it really matters by phone or ticket, they're going to be there

197
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:16,540
for you 24 seven Linode's been around since 2003 and at every step of the way, they've

198
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:21,360
asked themselves, how can we better use Linux to accomplish this next task when they became

199
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:23,280
their own ISP years ago?

200
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:25,240
Yeah, they're their own ISP.

201
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:29,260
They asked themselves, can we use Linux at the networking layer in a way that hasn't

202
00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:30,680
been done before?

203
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:35,800
And as long timers who use their service can tell, they really truly are Linux geeks.

204
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:39,960
A few months ago, I set up a $10 a month Linode for Minecraft for my kids.

205
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:42,680
I wanted to create a safe environment for them.

206
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:45,880
And Linode has a one click deployment for the Minecraft server where they'll ask you

207
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:50,060
like all the specifics for me, NPC settings, game mode type, and a bunch of other stuff.

208
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:53,320
You enter it in, hit submit, they generate the server for you.

209
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:56,920
And then of course I went and checked it out and it's built in a really intelligent way.

210
00:12:56,920 --> 00:13:01,240
And what's impressive about Linode is it is a great value at whatever level of box you're

211
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:02,240
getting.

212
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:04,800
So yeah, you know, I've got, I've got a box that I use for sync thing and I got a box

213
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:07,980
I use for my kids' Minecraft server and a couple of personal things like that.

214
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:12,640
But I also use Linode for backend infrastructure for Jupiter broadcasting that has to hold

215
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:18,080
up to serious traffic or has to do large processing jobs and move surprisingly dumb amounts of

216
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:19,080
data.

217
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:21,320
And it just does it like a champ.

218
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:25,080
And of course they have tons of distributions to choose from and it can be a great platform

219
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:26,760
to learn as well.

220
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:31,120
Security, Kubernetes, Terraform, you can mess with all of that on Linode and mess around

221
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:36,400
with scales that you really could never build at home while using our $100 credit that you

222
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:39,560
can just get by going to linode.com slash land.

223
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:43,240
You can learn something, you can deploy something and you can support the show.

224
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:45,520
There are a lot of ways to host out there.

225
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:47,420
I mean, there's just a lot of various companies.

226
00:13:47,420 --> 00:13:51,160
Some of them have some crazy business plans, but they're out there and they're going to

227
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:52,660
offer it to you.

228
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:57,680
But there is a reason why the JB crew and so many in our community choose Linode every

229
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:58,760
single time.

230
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:06,620
So go see for yourself and get that $100 at linode.com slash land linux.ting.com.

231
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:08,880
Are you sick of overpaying for cell service?

232
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:09,880
Of course you are.

233
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:14,920
So go see how much you could save and then take $25 off that at linux.ting.com.

234
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:15,920
They have great plans.

235
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:18,120
If you need just a tiny bit of data, you need a ton of data.

236
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:21,320
You need a limited minutes, very little minutes, you know, all of that stuff.

237
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:24,200
They've really made it simple and very approachable.

238
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:28,480
Like for example, they have Ting's set 12 plan that gives you 12 gigs of data, unlimited

239
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:34,840
talk, unlimited text for $35 a month, guys, $35 a month.

240
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:39,800
They also have great family plans and flexible plans that allow you to use data as you need

241
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:41,000
and all of that.

242
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:46,440
So to start by going to linux.ting.com and just appreciate a simpler, smarter way to

243
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:47,440
do mobile.

244
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:49,920
Ting has multiple networks you can pick from as well.

245
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:52,920
So you're going to find something that has great signal in your area.

246
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:56,760
And that also means you can bring your device if you want to because Ting's network support

247
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:57,960
is so broad.

248
00:14:57,960 --> 00:15:00,880
They have a ginormous compatibility.

249
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:02,000
You also could pick something up new.

250
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,360
In fact, you can get stuff new directly from Ting.

251
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:06,440
The process sets a bar for mobile.

252
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:09,560
So you just start at linux.ting.com, you go check your current phone.

253
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:11,520
They make that ridiculously simple.

254
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:14,400
I don't know why all the carriers haven't stolen this idea yet.

255
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:17,400
Once you put the information in for your phone compatibility check, it tells you if it's

256
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:19,720
going to work or not and they send you a SIM card.

257
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:22,800
You pop that in and you're pretty much done.

258
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:25,920
It's like a couple of minutes to set up an account at most and get the phone going.

259
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:29,120
Fifteen minutes later you got a phone on Ting and you're paying less than you ever thought

260
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:31,040
was possible for mobile.

261
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:35,640
And it's that kind of transformative shift where you realize you're never going to go

262
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:38,160
back to the old way of doing mobile.

263
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:44,600
So go to linux.ting.com, take $25 off a device or get $25 in service credit and support the

264
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:45,600
show.

265
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,520
There's never been a better time to try Ting Mobile.

266
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:51,600
They've upgraded their plans to the next level and I've been a Ting customer for a long time.

267
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:55,400
I can attest that Ting has really, really got some competitive plans now.

268
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:56,640
So go try them out.

269
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:57,640
Linux.ting.com.

270
00:15:57,640 --> 00:16:06,760
OpenSUSE Leap 15.3 is now officially available.

271
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:11,400
And maybe you're wondering why we're mentioning this latest minor release, but it's noteworthy

272
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:13,480
for more than a few reasons.

273
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:19,240
The first of those is that it's the first Leap release that's using the exact same binary

274
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:23,380
packages as SUSE Linux Enterprise.

275
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:31,920
Leap 15.3 is based on SUSE Linux Enterprise 15 SP3 and should see at least 18 months of

276
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:33,180
updates.

277
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:34,360
That's attractive right there.

278
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:41,240
But what really caught our attention is OpenSUSE Leap 15.3 is pulling in DNF 4.7.

279
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:43,960
Look at that, DNF, Fedora's Package Manager.

280
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:48,600
Now I think DNF has been available for a while, but there's some additional work that's been

281
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:50,640
done in Leap 15.3, right?

282
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:56,680
Yeah, you could get it pretty easily in 15.2, but it wasn't so easy to actually use it to

283
00:16:56,680 --> 00:17:00,540
go get any packages, at least without configuring it all yourself.

284
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:04,840
But now there's a couple of packages you can install, one which enables DNF to use the

285
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:09,880
repositories that you've configured for use with Yast and Zipper, or another one that

286
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:14,120
lets you just set up stable repository configurations independent of Zipper and Yast.

287
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:16,880
So you've got some flexible options.

288
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:22,560
The other really impressive piece to this DNF support is it's not just installing packages.

289
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:29,040
It's now possible to upgrade from Leap to Tumbleweed powered by DNF.

290
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:30,720
That's ridiculously great.

291
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:32,640
I got to try this at some point.

292
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:35,200
This puts it back on the tri-radar.

293
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:37,480
I want to play around with DNF on SUSE.

294
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:40,640
And I like that Leap's going to have 18 months of support, that it's been built from the

295
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:41,640
enterprise binaries.

296
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:44,680
That's a lot of really nice competitive offerings.

297
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:50,480
And again, like we say this all the time, but in reflection on the CentOS changes, it's

298
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:53,400
nice to see value added to distributions like Leap here like this.

299
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:58,960
It gives OpenSUSE and SUSE Enterprise Linux a compatibility that I think gives developers

300
00:17:58,960 --> 00:17:59,960
some comfort.

301
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:05,240
Well, something making Robert McQueen, President of the GNOME Foundation Board of Directors,

302
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:10,440
a little uncomfortable is the GNOME Project's finances.

303
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:16,000
Writing this week in a blog post, he said that the GNOME Project needs to broaden its

304
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:22,700
focus in order to attract more new users and ultimately to be able to raise funds from

305
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:27,080
new organizations outside of their traditional reach.

306
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:33,000
If they aren't able to find some new funding sources, they may need to scale back in some

307
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,080
of their efforts.

308
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:41,960
The latest budget approved by the Board of Directors has the foundation spending more

309
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:43,920
money than they're currently taking in.

310
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:49,240
Now, of course, that's never a good policy, but the GNOME Foundation actually has a reserves

311
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:54,720
policy that dictates they're not allowed to do this based on, well, experiences from the

312
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:55,720
past.

313
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:56,720
Easier said than done.

314
00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:01,160
Yeah, I mean, right now, it seems that their financial situation's good.

315
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:04,540
They haven't run into problems yet, but they can see it on the horizon.

316
00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:07,740
So they want to find new sources of funding.

317
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:13,280
And it seems like they have to move beyond their current reach to get those new funds.

318
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:18,980
In fact, McQueen commented, to raise funds from new sources, the foundation needs to

319
00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:26,200
take the message and ideals of GNOME and open source software to new, wider audiences that

320
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:27,200
we can help.

321
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:33,560
We've been developing themes such as affordability, privacy, trust, and education as promising

322
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:37,340
areas for new programs that broaden our impact.

323
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:42,600
The goal is to find projects and funding that allow us to both invest in the GNOME community

324
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:49,200
and find new ways for FOSS to benefit people who aren't already in our community.

325
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:53,920
Now, when a project starts talking about raising funds and starts talking about including people

326
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:58,400
who aren't in our community yet, you worry that perhaps that money is going to go towards

327
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:02,180
trying to reach out to people who just simply don't have any interest in development.

328
00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:04,480
But I think they've learned lessons from the past.

329
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:08,160
I think they are there being proactive here.

330
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:11,960
And McQueen had a message for current and future board members.

331
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:17,400
I'd like to make clear that I see this, reaching the outside world and finding funding to support

332
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:23,520
that, as the main priority and responsibility of the board for the next term.

333
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:29,760
We need to understand our financial situation and the trade-offs we have to make and help

334
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:34,320
to define the strategy with the executive director so that we can launch some new programs

335
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:38,760
that will broaden our impact and funding for the future.

336
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:46,560
Well, you can imagine my surprise after all this time when I saw in my feeds that the

337
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:50,760
Atari VCS actually has a ship date.

338
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:55,760
June 15th, 2021, the Atari VCS will be released into stores.

339
00:20:55,760 --> 00:21:01,760
Now, I don't understand because I was in the crowdfunding campaign and I thought I was

340
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:03,880
supposed to receive my console by now.

341
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:04,880
And I have not.

342
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:07,320
I have not received my console.

343
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:08,640
I don't know what happened.

344
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:10,240
I don't know how I got left out of this.

345
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:15,400
But if you guys aren't familiar, like 200 years ago, a company that calls itself Atari

346
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:21,880
announced a console PC hybrid that runs Linux and has an interface to play games on your

347
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:27,280
TV and also allows you to run whatever operating system you want in there.

348
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:32,440
There's also Google Chrome built in, along with the mobile companion app for controlling

349
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:36,880
Chrome and other apps with the virtual mouse and keyboard.

350
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:42,680
Sounds like it's also enabled for access to other streaming services like Google's Stadia.

351
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:45,640
I guess that's kind of not bad, right?

352
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:49,040
If you had a Stadia account and you wanted to hook up a console to your machine that

353
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:52,560
wasn't Android, I suppose, I mean, I'm stretching here.

354
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:53,560
I'm stretching.

355
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:56,880
When you try to go to their website right now, they're sold out of everything but hats.

356
00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:01,360
So you can't actually order a console, a controller or a joystick.

357
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:05,520
Maybe that's because they're still busy fulfilling the campaign backers like me.

358
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:07,940
But it's sold out right now.

359
00:22:07,940 --> 00:22:13,720
But I think the idea is, at least the claim is, for about $300 on June 15th, you could

360
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:16,000
go into a Best Buy and you could buy one.

361
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
So are you going to do it, Wes?

362
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20,560
Are you going to pick yourself up an Atari VCS for that nice retro wood look?

363
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:25,760
No, I think I'll wait for you to see if you end up with your shipment.

364
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:29,040
But in the meantime, I'll take a green hat, please.

365
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:30,040
Fair enough.

366
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:31,040
Yeah, grab yourself a hat.

367
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:32,040
I'm waiting to see.

368
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:39,960
I hope I do get mine because I will feel like it was nearly $400 well spent if it can do

369
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:44,520
some streaming services, it can maybe run Kodi and it can play some of my steam games

370
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:45,520
and some of my other games that I like.

371
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:50,720
And there have actually been games ported to Linux as a result of work to get them running

372
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:54,320
on the Atari VCS because essentially it's just straight up Linux.

373
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:57,560
And so to get your game working on there, you just make it a Linux game.

374
00:22:57,560 --> 00:23:01,760
And those games are already available on Steam right now for purchase.

375
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:02,760
And that's kind of nice.

376
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:06,600
I mean, even if this really doesn't sell that much, it meant that we got a few more Linux

377
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:08,720
native games, I suppose.

378
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,800
There's less of a downside to it not happening.

379
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:17,160
Yeah, but I guess at this point it means you're basically just paying for the console interface.

380
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:19,920
Well, and of course, that sweet wood paneling look.

381

Radio this week.

387
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:44,160
Two very different angles, one very interesting keyboard.

388
