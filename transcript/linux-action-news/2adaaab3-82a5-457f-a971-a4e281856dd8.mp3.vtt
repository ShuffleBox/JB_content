00:00.000 --> 00:16.200
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, our weekly take on Linux and the open source world.

00:16.200 --> 00:19.940
This is episode 14, recorded on August 13, 2017.

00:19.940 --> 00:20.940
I'm Chris.

00:20.940 --> 00:21.940
And I'm Joe.

00:21.940 --> 00:24.180
Hello, Joe, and happy mid-August.

00:24.180 --> 00:28.040
We're officially in the mid of the summer months, and there's one thing on everybody's

00:28.040 --> 00:33.160
mind right now, and that's solving universal software installation on Linux.

00:33.160 --> 00:37.240
Apparently, the biggest problem plaguing our land, and there's been a bit of movement this

00:37.240 --> 00:38.240
week.

00:38.240 --> 00:44.680
Yes, so it seems that Ikey over at Solus has decided to adopt Snaps, as well as Flatpak,

00:44.680 --> 00:50.000
which they were talking about adopting and have, but hasn't really gained much traction

00:50.000 --> 00:53.000
because there's not much that needs to be Flatpacked.

00:53.000 --> 00:58.840
He's given in finally, and has now accepted that Snaps are going to be part of Solus.

00:58.840 --> 01:05.080
Originally, it was going to be in the kind of upcoming future ISO, whereas he's done

01:05.080 --> 01:09.360
a lot of work over the weekend, by the looks of things, and it's going to be in the very

01:09.360 --> 01:11.120
next release.

01:11.120 --> 01:15.920
Supporting both Flatpaks and Snaps is sort of the obvious solution because they are,

01:15.920 --> 01:19.880
as they grow, starting to serve different needs.

01:19.880 --> 01:24.640
And what I like about Ikey's implementation for both of them in Solus is they both have

01:24.640 --> 01:29.280
full-fledged big-boy sandboxing via their individual technologies.

01:29.280 --> 01:30.280
That's a big part of this.

01:30.280 --> 01:34.040
Other distributions have implemented various levels of support, but they don't always nail

01:34.040 --> 01:35.440
the sandboxing part.

01:35.440 --> 01:40.120
And I think there was a fair amount of cross-project collaboration there.

01:40.120 --> 01:45.700
I've invited Ikey and Wimpy on Linux Unplugged next Tuesday to sort of give me that sort

01:45.700 --> 01:49.160
of picture of it, because I think that might be part of the interesting details here.

01:49.160 --> 01:55.760
However, the bigger takeaway here is we're really settling down on these two formats.

01:55.760 --> 01:59.760
AppImage, by its very nature, doesn't really need this cross-team collaboration.

01:59.760 --> 02:01.600
You can just sort of run AppImages.

02:01.600 --> 02:06.480
But this low-level stuff for Flatpaks and Snaps, where there's really built-in proper

02:06.480 --> 02:12.440
sandboxing support and there is a community aspect of it to bring in more developers working

02:12.440 --> 02:18.120
with these, this is a huge thing for all distributions to sort of adopt and implement correctly.

02:18.120 --> 02:21.920
And this would be a model for a lot of them to follow, because if you don't adopt it properly

02:21.920 --> 02:26.280
or implement it correctly, you could sort of bungle the whole thing.

02:26.280 --> 02:30.920
And the key issues that I see that stand out are where do you draw the line from what you

02:30.920 --> 02:35.080
package in your repositories versus what you ship as Flatpaks?

02:35.080 --> 02:38.680
And how do the outside projects view it, like the GNOME project?

02:38.680 --> 02:42.280
How do they view that relationship and how it should be set up?

02:42.280 --> 02:45.240
That's a really deep thing for distributions to think about.

02:45.240 --> 02:48.060
And then how do you implement the security, the sandboxing?

02:48.060 --> 02:51.360
And I really think Solus has nailed it, and it would be a good model for other distributions

02:51.360 --> 02:53.520
to look at if they're trying to make this decision.

02:53.520 --> 02:58.680
Well, yeah, and also you kind of glossed over the community aspect there, but I think that

02:58.680 --> 03:03.660
the way they've worked together, the Solus and Ubuntu teams, to make this happen has

03:03.660 --> 03:08.120
got to be the model for how other distros are going to do it, because you can't expect

03:08.120 --> 03:09.560
them to do this completely alone.

03:09.560 --> 03:13.680
And so hopefully going forward, we're going to see more of this collaboration, because

03:13.680 --> 03:18.440
if you're going to have a universal package format, you need collaboration.

03:18.440 --> 03:19.440
Absolutely.

03:19.440 --> 03:24.120
And also, I'd like to see this sort of resolved so we can move on and just start shipping

03:24.120 --> 03:30.520
software, you know, and just get people like companies and open source projects to start

03:30.520 --> 03:33.160
shipping their software as Snaps or Flatpaks.

03:33.160 --> 03:36.980
Yeah, although it's quite telling that in one of the Google Plus posts that Aiki made

03:36.980 --> 03:42.160
about this, he said, personally, I think everyone's lost their marbles chasing universal apps

03:42.160 --> 03:46.280
as if it's the number one problem we have in Linux, as opposed to the tangible, attractive

03:46.280 --> 03:50.280
features to bring developers across and create awesome stuff for our platform.

03:50.280 --> 03:51.840
But hey, whatever.

03:51.840 --> 03:56.760
That's easy for Solus to say with their fairly well-maintained repositories where they frequently

03:56.760 --> 04:01.000
update things to make apps like Discord work when there's all of a sudden new dependency.

04:01.000 --> 04:06.940
Not all distributions are as diligent with their repository hygiene.

04:06.940 --> 04:10.720
And so yeah, I do totally understand where he's coming from.

04:10.720 --> 04:15.480
But it's because the problem, I think, isn't as pronounced in Solus as it is in other distributions,

04:15.480 --> 04:16.480
in part.

04:16.480 --> 04:18.080
And also, in part, because he's right.

04:18.080 --> 04:20.960
It isn't the number one problem we're trying to solve right now.

04:20.960 --> 04:24.280
But there are companies that have an interest in this.

04:24.280 --> 04:28.560
And there are long-term problems that have been nagging Linux for a very long time that

04:28.560 --> 04:32.160
people are in positions to solve, and they really want to solve them now.

04:32.160 --> 04:34.480
So you kind of have to jump on the bandwagon when it's here.

04:34.480 --> 04:35.480
And I think that's what he's done.

04:35.480 --> 04:38.040
He's made a really practical choice in how to implement it.

04:38.040 --> 04:42.700
And one thing I'll always give the Solus project and Nike specifically, and one of the reasons

04:42.700 --> 04:48.620
why it's one of my top contenders as a distribution, is he'll take a strong stance on something.

04:48.620 --> 04:55.500
But he is totally willing to take in information, consider that, and then change his position.

04:55.500 --> 04:58.760
And every time he's done it, I'm like, yep, that makes a lot of sense.

04:58.760 --> 05:02.480
Every single time, it's been like, yeah, that seems like a really clear decision to make,

05:02.480 --> 05:03.960
and other people should probably follow that.

05:03.960 --> 05:09.320
Yeah, first of all, with Flatpak, it seemed a bit strange, and it was a bit of a U-turn.

05:09.320 --> 05:15.480
But he's kind of not afraid to U-turn or flip-flop, whatever you want to call it, if it makes

05:15.480 --> 05:16.480
sense.

05:16.480 --> 05:20.640
And yeah, that is what makes Solus good, I think, that you've got someone who is willing

05:20.640 --> 05:23.560
to change his mind based on new evidence and new thinking.

05:23.560 --> 05:29.800
Yeah, and he famously articulated the anti-Flatpak, anti-snap stance on Linux Unplugged a while

05:29.800 --> 05:30.800
ago.

05:30.800 --> 05:33.920
And he made a really good cognizant argument against it.

05:33.920 --> 05:37.880
And now he's made a really good cognizant argument for it.

05:37.880 --> 05:40.340
So I can't wait to talk to him more about it.

05:40.340 --> 05:44.360
But now we just wait and see where this actually goes, because we've got to get people shipping

05:44.360 --> 05:45.360
software.

05:45.360 --> 05:47.120
And Canonical's playing a role in that.

05:47.120 --> 05:52.080
And they're also looking at reshaping their community infrastructure a bit, which may

05:52.080 --> 05:55.960
down the road play into some of this, like community adoption of snaps.

05:55.960 --> 06:00.280
Yeah, Popee has been very busy writing blog posts over the last week or so, by the looks

06:00.280 --> 06:01.600
of things.

06:01.600 --> 06:06.200
The first one we're going to talk about is the Ubuntu Community Hub proposal.

06:06.200 --> 06:11.480
And in this blog post, he basically says that the Ubuntu community portal that they've got

06:11.480 --> 06:14.320
now is just not up to scratch.

06:14.320 --> 06:16.040
It hasn't been maintained very well.

06:16.040 --> 06:17.040
It's a bit old.

06:17.040 --> 06:20.360
A lot of the information is outdated.

06:20.360 --> 06:25.060
And as a result of that, it's hard for people to come into the Ubuntu community.

06:25.060 --> 06:28.920
And so he's proposing, well, it's quite a long-winded blog post.

06:28.920 --> 06:33.960
But what it essentially amounts to is a discourse forum.

06:33.960 --> 06:35.840
Is that too harsh to boil it down?

06:35.840 --> 06:38.660
No, I think it's, you know, he's thought a lot about this.

06:38.660 --> 06:40.920
And they're thinking a lot about community.

06:40.920 --> 06:42.800
And you've boiled it down pretty much correctly.

06:42.800 --> 06:46.120
They're proposing they replace the community portal with something that Popee considers

06:46.120 --> 06:49.280
more dynamic and collaboratively maintained.

06:49.280 --> 06:53.120
They would raise the profile of conversation and content, maybe pull over really great

06:53.120 --> 06:56.600
legacy content from some of the places they'd be spinning down.

06:56.600 --> 07:01.240
So really, they're not looking at replacing all their other sites, more like add to them,

07:01.240 --> 07:06.120
because things like the well-established Ask Ubuntu or Ubuntu forums wouldn't go anywhere.

07:06.120 --> 07:07.840
So this would be more like a supplement to them.

07:07.840 --> 07:11.880
But is it not just potentially adding more confusion, yet another place to get information

07:11.880 --> 07:12.880
about Ubuntu?

07:12.880 --> 07:14.640
Yeah, I think it could be to a degree.

07:14.640 --> 07:19.400
I think also you have to wonder if community hasn't changed a bit online.

07:19.400 --> 07:23.920
I think it's less and less common for people to be able to stand up their own silos and

07:23.920 --> 07:25.520
have community come to them.

07:25.520 --> 07:29.080
I think it's more common now you have to go to the community wherever they're at.

07:29.080 --> 07:31.960
And sometimes they're on Mumble.

07:31.960 --> 07:33.200
Sometimes they're on Discord.

07:33.200 --> 07:34.420
Sometimes they're on Twitter.

07:34.420 --> 07:37.200
Sometimes they're on whatever.

07:37.200 --> 07:38.920
The list could go on and on.

07:38.920 --> 07:44.640
I just think that there's so many established resources for people, and they are so allergic

07:44.640 --> 07:48.280
now to creating new accounts and having yet another password that could get leaked or

07:48.280 --> 07:52.800
compromised or yet another thing that's going to email them, that they've sort of settled

07:52.800 --> 07:54.080
in now.

07:54.080 --> 07:59.800
And I think it's more about having a beachhead in those areas, like Telegram is another example,

07:59.800 --> 08:01.960
and just having a presence there.

08:01.960 --> 08:04.640
You must feel this to a degree with your community around late-night Linux.

08:04.640 --> 08:09.840
Well, I think that that is somewhat fractured.

08:09.840 --> 08:13.160
And it's kind of mostly in the Telegram group, I suppose.

08:13.160 --> 08:17.020
But we do have people who don't really hang out there and are more interested in commenting

08:17.020 --> 08:18.740
directly on the website.

08:18.740 --> 08:23.800
And I mean, back in Linux lotto days, we had hoped to have one community on the website

08:23.800 --> 08:29.160
and try and kind of focus it then and have the comments and email notifications of replies

08:29.160 --> 08:30.160
and stuff like that.

08:30.160 --> 08:31.980
But it just didn't really work out that way.

08:31.980 --> 08:33.160
Some people want to be on Twitter.

08:33.160 --> 08:34.560
Some people want to be on Google+.

08:34.560 --> 08:37.320
So you just kind of have to be everywhere, really.

08:37.320 --> 08:42.320
It feels like the golden era of the forum or building your own Wiki around your community

08:42.320 --> 08:47.000
where you have lots of active contributors is sort of passed as there are bigger fish

08:47.000 --> 08:50.280
out there that people want to spend their time with.

08:50.280 --> 08:53.920
But it's not necessarily a wrong approach here.

08:53.920 --> 08:57.440
They're essentially saying, well, discourse sort of solves that problem.

08:57.440 --> 08:59.080
Because discourse is commonly used.

08:59.080 --> 09:01.160
It's something that a lot of people have accounts with.

09:01.160 --> 09:04.160
It's something that they already have familiarity with, so you're not asking them to spend their

09:04.160 --> 09:05.780
time to learn something new.

09:05.780 --> 09:08.980
It's something dynamic and modern that people are used to seeing.

09:08.980 --> 09:11.440
So I think that's exactly what Popey is going for.

09:11.440 --> 09:15.560
And he's thought a lot about this, plus trying to solve other problems like onboarding and

09:15.560 --> 09:17.000
communications.

09:17.000 --> 09:18.880
So hopefully this works.

09:18.880 --> 09:22.200
I just wonder how much traction it'll actually pick up.

09:22.200 --> 09:27.720
Is it just me, or Discord and discourse, are they just too similar and confusing?

09:27.720 --> 09:28.720
Very.

09:28.720 --> 09:29.720
Yeah, it's so annoying.

09:29.720 --> 09:31.400
It feels like namespace collision.

09:31.400 --> 09:35.380
I suppose one of the things that could be really great about this is they could see

09:35.380 --> 09:38.940
a re-insurgence of new users with the switch to GNOME.

09:38.940 --> 09:44.000
So having the good infrastructure in place as those new people show back up or return

09:44.000 --> 09:45.000
could be a good timing.

09:45.000 --> 09:46.000
Yeah.

09:46.000 --> 09:47.000
Well, I think things are changing fundamentally.

09:47.000 --> 09:49.400
I mean, they have changed fundamentally.

09:49.400 --> 09:54.080
It feels like they really went for it with the phone stuff and convergence, and that

09:54.080 --> 09:55.200
just didn't work.

09:55.200 --> 09:59.640
And it's like Shuttleworth picked up the company and just shook it like an Etch-A-Sketch, just

09:59.640 --> 10:04.900
totally shook it off and just remade it, basically.

10:04.900 --> 10:06.440
And so that's what we're seeing now, aren't we?

10:06.440 --> 10:12.520
We're seeing developments in all the different places, and we're finding it was like a huge

10:12.520 --> 10:15.600
explosion almost, wasn't it, of the whole project.

10:15.600 --> 10:17.160
And now the dust has settled.

10:17.160 --> 10:21.160
I'm using too many metaphors and stuff here, but you know what I mean.

10:21.160 --> 10:25.240
Things are shaping out in their own ways, and this is a huge part of it by the looks

10:25.240 --> 10:26.240
of things.

10:26.240 --> 10:30.960
Meanwhile, development on what is turning into one of the most interesting releases

10:30.960 --> 10:35.080
of Ubuntu in many, many years is going on.

10:35.080 --> 10:40.260
So all of these big changes, and there's staffing changes, a lot of things you have to imagine

10:40.260 --> 10:41.560
behind the scenes are changing.

10:41.560 --> 10:44.360
People have roles they've never had before.

10:44.360 --> 10:49.320
And all of that's happening while development continues on on what actually seems to be

10:49.320 --> 10:53.400
a fairly impressive version of Ubuntu 17.10.

10:53.400 --> 10:59.080
And to sort of help solidify that, they're making a call for people to stop by and help

10:59.080 --> 11:00.840
them polish the experience.

11:00.840 --> 11:08.800
Yeah, the 24th and 25th of August, the Ubuntu Artful Desktop fit and finish sprint.

11:08.800 --> 11:14.520
So they're going to be working on this during the day, they're kind of paid developers and

11:14.520 --> 11:20.160
people at Canonical, but they're inviting community members to come in in the evening.

11:20.160 --> 11:24.400
And there'll be beer, soft drinks and pizza, by the sounds of things.

11:24.400 --> 11:29.200
I don't think they want just anyone, I think you've got to be able to offer something to

11:29.200 --> 11:30.200
them.

11:30.200 --> 11:35.320
They talk about CSS experts and people who know quite a lot about GNOME Shell and GTK

11:35.320 --> 11:36.560
themes and stuff like that.

11:36.560 --> 11:41.500
And they're really trying to just, as the name suggests, iron out all the little paper

11:41.500 --> 11:46.080
cut bugs, make it as smooth an experience as possible when you install this, because

11:46.080 --> 11:48.560
they realize how important this release is.

11:48.560 --> 11:54.040
I really encourage you, if you're in the London area, even if you're not an Ubuntu user, consider

11:54.040 --> 11:55.040
going.

11:55.040 --> 11:59.540
Imagine maybe building a relationship with one of the developers of Ubuntu by helping

11:59.540 --> 12:00.680
out with something there.

12:00.680 --> 12:02.500
So they have a deadline for filling out the form.

12:02.500 --> 12:07.440
It is Friday, August 18th, and you'll need to find the link in our show notes.

12:07.440 --> 12:10.600
They don't have a lot of room, so you'll need to fill out that form.

12:10.600 --> 12:13.360
And then if you can't make it to, let them know if you do sign up, just to kind of help

12:13.360 --> 12:14.720
them out so they can manage all that.

12:14.720 --> 12:17.320
I like this a lot.

12:17.320 --> 12:22.440
I like this a surprising amount, because I'm racking my brain right now, Joe, and I'm trying

12:22.440 --> 12:26.960
to think of any other distribution that I've heard do this, where they'll say, come into

12:26.960 --> 12:33.200
our corporate offices, sit down at some computers that we'll set up, and bang on our desktop,

12:33.200 --> 12:37.080
just so we can make sure the fit and finish is as top-notch as possible.

12:37.080 --> 12:38.080
Have you ever heard of any other...

12:38.080 --> 12:42.520
I've heard of Microsoft and Apple doing this, but I've never heard of a distribution doing

12:42.520 --> 12:43.520
this.

12:43.520 --> 12:46.680
Well, isn't that because the likes of Red Hat would pay people to do it, rather than

12:46.680 --> 12:48.720
just giving them some pizza and beer?

12:48.720 --> 12:49.720
Maybe, yeah.

12:49.720 --> 12:50.760
Maybe they would hire a group.

12:50.760 --> 12:55.260
They would probably go through some sort of contracting agency that would go out and hire

12:55.260 --> 12:57.480
people for a temporary 30-day job.

12:57.480 --> 13:00.880
I mean, they would probably be very corporate about it, where this is more like, come and

13:00.880 --> 13:03.840
have a beer, and eat some pizza, and bang on GNOME for us.

13:03.840 --> 13:07.440
So if you have a little GNOME shell skills, or even CSS, because, I mean, let's be honest,

13:07.440 --> 13:11.240
that's what these themes are made out of, and of course, you got to probably be a little

13:11.240 --> 13:15.360
familiar with Linux, because it's not so much about total new user experience as it is the

13:15.360 --> 13:18.160
refinement of a professional desktop.

13:18.160 --> 13:22.760
I think it's a great idea, and I'd love, if anybody goes, I'd love for them to let me

13:22.760 --> 13:28.120
know how it went, because there's some things there in Ubuntu 17.10 that I think are going

13:28.120 --> 13:29.120
to be game changers.

13:29.120 --> 13:32.000
I can't wait to review this distribution.

13:32.000 --> 13:37.600
There's, for me personally, big stuff landing in Ubuntu 17.10.

13:37.600 --> 13:43.720
And I've talked about it before, but for one of them, I have to repeat, I'm so thrilled

13:43.720 --> 13:51.120
that they are working on proper hardware accelerated video playback on the Linux desktop, and they're

13:51.120 --> 13:55.820
doing it by working with the low-level codecs, patching that stuff.

13:55.820 --> 13:58.240
They're working with Chromium, like Chromium 60.

13:58.240 --> 14:05.160
They're enabling video acceleration, and you can see a 50% savings in CPU overhead using

14:05.160 --> 14:06.520
the VA API.

14:06.520 --> 14:12.880
Now, not only does that translate to better battery savings, but for me, the biggest thing

14:12.880 --> 14:17.560
is it just means my fan runs less, and it makes my laptop less annoying, and my laptop

14:17.560 --> 14:19.680
gets less hot.

14:19.680 --> 14:25.280
And if you have a Haswell or newer CPU, it's going to work.

14:25.280 --> 14:30.160
And you're going to install 17.10, and you're going to have a 50% CPU reduction in something

14:30.160 --> 14:34.240
you've maybe done, like watch a YouTube video on a daily basis.

14:34.240 --> 14:35.360
This is a huge benefit.

14:35.360 --> 14:37.600
Now, of course, it's not going to be perfect.

14:37.600 --> 14:41.880
It's going to take probably several releases of working on this, but I can't wait for this

14:41.880 --> 14:45.280
to land in 17.10, and they're sending the code upstream, too.

14:45.280 --> 14:46.400
They're sending it upstream.

14:46.400 --> 14:51.240
So this could land in Fedora, this could land on all the other desktops out there, and it

14:51.240 --> 14:55.400
would be massive for battery life on Linux, and it's going to be massive for 4K video

14:55.400 --> 14:56.400
playback.

14:56.400 --> 15:00.560
What I really like about this, and we're kind of taking this info this week from the Ubuntu

15:00.560 --> 15:07.480
desktop weekly update, is if you look at the screenshot, not only is it probably a laptop

15:07.480 --> 15:12.120
that's 720p by the looks of things, it's only got four gigs of RAM, so they're not doing

15:12.120 --> 15:16.680
this on huge powerhouse machines, they're doing it on realistic machines that people

15:16.680 --> 15:17.680
actually have.

15:17.680 --> 15:18.680
Yeah.

15:18.680 --> 15:23.520
They also are adding patches, and they're sending these upstream, that will enable or

15:23.520 --> 15:28.040
disable network connectivity, which I think is then the little checker, I think that's

15:28.040 --> 15:29.040
just brilliant.

15:29.040 --> 15:31.880
And it's going to be a little toggle switch in privacy settings of GNOME Control Center

15:31.880 --> 15:34.680
to allow you to turn on or off the connectivity checker.

15:34.680 --> 15:40.000
Yeah, you know, we talked about at length when they first announced that they were ditching

15:40.000 --> 15:43.400
Unity and going to GNOME, and I was very cynical about it.

15:43.400 --> 15:48.480
I said that they're basically abandoning the desktop, and people said, well, hopefully

15:48.480 --> 15:50.560
it's going to make GNOME better as a result.

15:50.560 --> 15:54.400
And I was very skeptical of that, but here we are.

15:54.400 --> 15:55.400
The proof is here.

15:55.400 --> 15:57.120
They already are contributing to GNOME.

15:57.120 --> 15:59.680
They're making it better for everyone.

15:59.680 --> 16:04.100
We haven't even touched on the patches that they've done to PulseAudio, which I think

16:04.100 --> 16:08.820
are pretty solid, and the fixes to Bluetooth, which are also all upstream stuff.

16:08.820 --> 16:10.800
So yeah, I'm very happy with this.

16:10.800 --> 16:15.280
I'm looking forward to trying out 1710, and I'm really hoping to see other distributions

16:15.280 --> 16:17.920
pick up some of this upstream code and ship it.

16:17.920 --> 16:27.440
A 50% reduction in CPU is just such a huge win for just upgrading your free desktop.

16:27.440 --> 16:29.120

16:29.120 --> 16:31.980
Go there to support the show and sign up for a free seven-day trial.

16:31.980 --> 16:36.580
It's a platform to learn about Linux, everything from the low-level stuff up to the high-level

16:36.580 --> 16:42.840
stuff that you can really boost your resume, AWS, Azure, OpenStack, which is an incredible

16:42.840 --> 16:46.620
topic or learning to develop like PHP or Ruby.

16:46.620 --> 16:50.200
What I really like about Linux Academy is they'll work with your busy schedule.

16:50.200 --> 16:54.180
And one of the problems when you're super busy with self-paced learning is that every

16:54.180 --> 16:57.520
now and then you just start slipping.

16:57.520 --> 16:59.220
It's a willpower thing.

16:59.220 --> 17:03.360
And what I love about Linux Academy is they have these gentle ways to get you back on

17:03.360 --> 17:04.360
track.

17:04.360 --> 17:07.020
They put you in a slow and steady pace to win the race.

17:07.020 --> 17:12.520
It's a perfectly fine-tuned system that I can go in and adjust depending on what I have

17:12.520 --> 17:14.240
going on that week.

17:14.240 --> 17:17.820
And it allows me to stick to goals for learning.

17:17.820 --> 17:21.440
They also have content plans specifically for getting your certs or particular career

17:21.440 --> 17:26.520
track and a community stacked full of Jupyter broadcasting members, LinuxAcademy.com slash

17:26.520 --> 17:27.520
Unplugged.

17:27.520 --> 17:29.600
Go there to sign up for a free seven-day trial.

17:29.600 --> 17:35.080
And thanks to Linux Academy for sponsoring Linux Action News, LinuxAcademy.com slash Unplugged.

17:35.080 --> 17:39.840
Okay, let's talk about Nextcloud.

17:39.840 --> 17:42.080
We haven't spoken about them for a while.

17:42.080 --> 17:49.260
And this week they announced a partnership with various education companies and organizations.

17:49.260 --> 17:55.960
I think the most interesting one is Moodle, which is a platform used by universities and

17:55.960 --> 18:01.600
colleges all over the world, and they say more than 80 million users.

18:01.600 --> 18:06.320
And so it's effectively just apps for Nextcloud, which anyone can install.

18:06.320 --> 18:11.620
But they've been working hard with these various organizations to integrate stuff really well.

18:11.620 --> 18:16.040
And it just seems like such a logical step for them, doesn't it, to push into education?

18:16.040 --> 18:19.400
Because that is a guaranteed market for what they're trying to do.

18:19.400 --> 18:21.760
Yeah, that does seem like a really great step for them.

18:21.760 --> 18:26.960
They've also worked with Moodle to integrate authentication on the Moodle side of things.

18:26.960 --> 18:28.600
So that's pretty great.

18:28.600 --> 18:30.040
Stop and think about that for a second.

18:30.040 --> 18:36.080
That means Nextcloud can plug into all these existing established Moodle user databases.

18:36.080 --> 18:39.320
So you install an app on your Moodle.

18:39.320 --> 18:41.320
That's pretty funny, actually.

18:41.320 --> 18:46.600
I bet it gets old if you work with Moodle, but for somebody who doesn't, that's funny.

18:46.600 --> 18:47.600
So you have this new app.

18:47.600 --> 18:51.640
Then you can offer users the ability to access files from Nextcloud.

18:51.640 --> 18:55.200
You can also then manage the sharing rights from within Moodle.

18:55.200 --> 18:56.900
That's big, I think.

18:56.900 --> 19:00.660
And if you look at the list here, you have five new apps that were created specifically

19:00.660 --> 19:04.520
as part of this collaboration between Nextcloud and these partners.

19:04.520 --> 19:05.920
It's a big deal for Nextcloud.

19:05.920 --> 19:09.200
And you can go get these apps individually with your existing installation, because they're

19:09.200 --> 19:13.160
open source and they're up in that app store, quote unquote.

19:13.160 --> 19:17.520
Or you can go get the bundle, which I think is also really smart, because then in the

19:17.520 --> 19:20.160
education market, it's something they can wrap their head around and just start deploying.

19:20.160 --> 19:22.640
Yeah, and it kind of makes sense from a business point of view.

19:22.640 --> 19:25.480
If they want to keep everything open source, they don't have that freemium model that they

19:25.480 --> 19:30.080
used to have, they need to offer support and hosting and stuff.

19:30.080 --> 19:33.440
And education is a good sell for that, isn't it?

19:33.440 --> 19:34.440
Yeah, absolutely.

19:34.440 --> 19:38.260
And if you're going to be looking at Moodle and Nextcloud together, why not view them

19:38.260 --> 19:43.640
in the new version of Firefox, version 55, which is the one I'm officially excited about,

19:43.640 --> 19:44.640
Joe.

19:44.640 --> 19:46.120
Yeah, because now we've got cool web VR.

19:46.120 --> 19:47.400
Oh, no, hang on.

19:47.400 --> 19:48.400
That's on Windows.

19:48.400 --> 19:49.400
Oh, wait.

19:49.400 --> 19:50.400
Yeah.

19:50.400 --> 19:56.000
But we have got better performance and just general improvements across the board.

19:56.000 --> 19:57.120
I mean, I've tried this out.

19:57.120 --> 20:01.920
It's not in Ubuntu 16.04 yet, so I had to just download the tar and extract it and run

20:01.920 --> 20:02.920
it.

20:02.920 --> 20:08.160
And just instantly, on my i3 laptop, it was just way faster at everything.

20:08.160 --> 20:09.160
Yep.

20:09.160 --> 20:11.040
My experience as well, much, much faster.

20:11.040 --> 20:15.120
And I'm using only the plugins that work with electrolysis.

20:15.120 --> 20:18.120
So that's part of, I think, why it's working really fast for me.

20:18.120 --> 20:22.680
I was digging around on hacks.mozilla.org, and I'll try to link this in the show notes.

20:22.680 --> 20:23.680
Holy crap, Joe.

20:23.680 --> 20:25.160
Holy, holy smokes.

20:25.160 --> 20:30.040
This is amazing work that they've been doing, and it's the progress of a bunch of various

20:30.040 --> 20:35.920
different projects coming together inside Mozilla and landing in version 55 of Firefox.

20:35.920 --> 20:40.440
And it means all kinds of things are faster at every single level of Firefox.

20:40.440 --> 20:44.760
So we know a couple of big name things, but it's like 100 little things, too.

20:44.760 --> 20:47.920
And I'll have that linked in the show notes if you want to geek out on that.

20:47.920 --> 20:49.120
It's pretty cool.

20:49.120 --> 20:54.800
But for me, I think the big takeaway feature that I'm a really big fan of is they've made

20:54.800 --> 20:58.160
the Flash plugin click to activate by default.

20:58.160 --> 20:59.720
That's long, long overdue.

20:59.720 --> 21:00.720
Yeah.

21:00.720 --> 21:04.240
And you could always do with an extension, but I always end up with tons of extensions,

21:04.240 --> 21:06.080
so it's nice to just have it baked right in.

21:06.080 --> 21:09.600
And the next versions of Firefox, we're going to have a couple of new versions landing over

21:09.600 --> 21:11.280
the next few months.

21:11.280 --> 21:17.320
And they're also looking pretty great, including a new UI, so literally pretty great.

21:17.320 --> 21:21.200
Version 57 of Firefox is slated to be released sometime in November.

21:21.200 --> 21:24.440
It'll be the biggest user-facing change, just the one all the users are going to end up

21:24.440 --> 21:25.440
talking about.

21:25.440 --> 21:28.680
It's going to ship the new Photon UI, which you can actually get your hands on if you

21:28.680 --> 21:29.800
dig around.

21:29.800 --> 21:32.320
And that should probably get a lot of people talking about Firefox.

21:32.320 --> 21:37.160
Yeah, it's in the nightly on Android and on the desktop, and I've tried them both.

21:37.160 --> 21:42.700
And the mobile one, it doesn't look massively different, but the desktop just feels much

21:42.700 --> 21:43.940
more modern, really.

21:43.940 --> 21:46.080
Just everything about it is a little bit more modern.

21:46.080 --> 21:52.000
And one of the features that wasn't in the version of 55 that I tried, which is strangely

21:52.000 --> 21:57.280
rolling out to users on a kind of case-by-case basis, I'm not exactly sure what's happening

21:57.280 --> 21:58.280
with that.

21:58.280 --> 22:05.100
But on the 57 nightly, you've got this screenshot within Firefox button.

22:05.100 --> 22:08.000
And so it's right up there on the top right next to downloads and stuff.

22:08.000 --> 22:12.840
And you click that, and then you can select the area of the screen that you want, including

22:12.840 --> 22:15.160
if you want to scroll way down.

22:15.160 --> 22:20.320
And so you can take a huge, long, thin screenshot of a forum thread or something like that.

22:20.320 --> 22:24.400
And that's baked right into Firefox, which is a good feature as well, I think.

22:24.400 --> 22:28.480
It saves you having to print screen and then open it with GIMP and then crop it.

22:28.480 --> 22:30.100
It's kind of all right there.

22:30.100 --> 22:31.100
That is really cool.

22:31.100 --> 22:32.100
I'll play with that.

22:32.100 --> 22:38.800
Now, I got to also say, I've been getting a few emails, and they're along the lines

22:38.800 --> 22:45.640
of, once 57 ships, I got to switch to Chrome, because the Zool-based add-on that I have

22:45.640 --> 22:47.560
isn't getting replaced.

22:47.560 --> 22:49.600
And it won't work with 57.

22:49.600 --> 22:52.280
And a year ago, they made a Chrome version.

22:52.280 --> 22:53.360
And so I've been eyeballing that.

22:53.360 --> 22:54.920
And this is a common story.

22:54.920 --> 22:56.740
And I could see it happening to me too.

22:56.740 --> 23:01.120
So 57 will also be a divisive release, because there are people that think that's their stake

23:01.120 --> 23:05.520
in the ground is once the Zool-based add-ons are discontinued, I'm out.

23:05.520 --> 23:06.520
Yeah.

23:06.520 --> 23:08.160
It's going to be real crunch time, isn't it?

23:08.160 --> 23:10.920
Because at the moment, the developers don't have to do that.

23:10.920 --> 23:17.000
Because although the new web extensions are enabled in 55, they're not mandatory.

23:17.000 --> 23:19.600
Whereas once we get to 57, that's it.

23:19.600 --> 23:24.880
So maybe at that point, they'll actually develop the new extensions.

23:24.880 --> 23:27.840
But I'm kind of not holding my breath for a lot of them.

23:27.840 --> 23:30.260
But there's kind of a bigger point here.

23:30.260 --> 23:35.020
We've been talking about what Mozilla have been up to for the last five, six weeks.

23:35.020 --> 23:41.260
And it seems like, much like Ubuntu, when they cut the dead weight of the mobile thing,

23:41.260 --> 23:44.280
in the case of Mozilla, it was Firefox OS.

23:44.280 --> 23:46.880
And with Ubuntu, it was Ubuntu Touch and Convergence.

23:46.880 --> 23:51.840
It was kind of like, once they accepted defeat on that, it cut the dead weight and allowed

23:51.840 --> 23:54.760
them to progress in other areas.

23:54.760 --> 23:57.820
Am I just constructing a narrative here that doesn't exist?

23:57.820 --> 23:59.800
Am I reading too much into it?

23:59.800 --> 24:02.320
If it's a narrative you're constructing, it's one that I agree with.

24:02.320 --> 24:04.060
It seems to be the case, for sure.

24:04.060 --> 24:08.560
And I have to wonder, from a team standpoint, imagine you're sinking your heart and soul

24:08.560 --> 24:09.880
into a project.

24:09.880 --> 24:11.580
And it's not taking off.

24:11.580 --> 24:13.620
It's not doing particularly great.

24:13.620 --> 24:16.400
But you just keep grinding away at it.

24:16.400 --> 24:20.960
And you start to feel the inevitability of defeat.

24:20.960 --> 24:23.640
Then all of a sudden, things shift.

24:23.640 --> 24:27.380
And you're now working on the thing that you originally signed up at that company to work

24:27.380 --> 24:31.540
for, what you have been passionate about all along, what brought you to that company in

24:31.540 --> 24:34.340
the first place and got you notoriety.

24:34.340 --> 24:35.640
And now you're back working on that.

24:35.640 --> 24:37.920
And you've been thinking about that for ages in the back of your mind.

24:37.920 --> 24:40.120
Man, if I could only get back to that project, I would do this.

24:40.120 --> 24:41.120
I would do this.

24:41.120 --> 24:42.120
I would do this.

24:42.120 --> 24:44.800
And well, man, now that we learned how to do that on a super low memory profile, I would

24:44.800 --> 24:46.900
love to bake that back in.

24:46.900 --> 24:48.540
And then things change.

24:48.540 --> 24:51.840
And all of a sudden, you've been unleashed and you're working on your project again.

24:51.840 --> 24:59.240
Maybe there's a bit of like a, finally, you've released us sort of a swing back and a huge

24:59.240 --> 25:02.080
new burst of motivation to really bang this stuff out.

25:02.080 --> 25:06.720
And there's essentially like a greater competitiveness now than they seem to have ever had.

25:06.720 --> 25:09.400
And it's got to be as a result of that, at least to a degree.

25:09.400 --> 25:10.400
I have to agree.

25:10.400 --> 25:11.400
Yeah.

25:11.400 --> 25:12.400
All right.

25:12.400 --> 25:17.880
Well, before we move off Firefox, let's quickly mention that Epiphany, or is it GNOME web?

25:17.880 --> 25:18.880
I don't know.

25:18.880 --> 25:24.160
The browser that is the GNOME default, the new version of that is going to support Firefox

25:24.160 --> 25:25.160
sync.

25:25.160 --> 25:26.480
So that's pretty cool.

25:26.480 --> 25:27.480
It really is.

25:27.480 --> 25:32.480
It's a nice lightweight web kit browser on the Linux desktop, but take advantage of Firefox

25:32.480 --> 25:35.760
sync and including the syncing of tabs and passwords.

25:35.760 --> 25:39.040
And it'll even sync with Firefox, even the mobile version of Firefox.

25:39.040 --> 25:42.360
This is going to be a super great feature built into Epiphany.

25:42.360 --> 25:46.800
And also, we have a link in the show notes of this story, dig around on their blog.

25:46.800 --> 25:53.080
They also have a good write up of some web kit woes on Linux and which distributions

25:53.080 --> 25:58.040
like Arch and Fedora are getting it right and which distributions are potentially shipping

25:58.040 --> 26:00.240
really bad code like OpenSUSE.

26:00.240 --> 26:01.240
All that's in the blog too.

26:01.240 --> 26:02.240
It's linked in the show notes.

26:02.240 --> 26:03.240
All right.

26:03.240 --> 26:07.400
Well, let's round things off and talk about Android 8, which is going to be released pretty

26:07.400 --> 26:09.520
soon by the looks of things.

26:09.520 --> 26:14.680
And one feature that they're going to introduce, which I think is really important, is streaming

26:14.680 --> 26:16.560
OS updates.

26:16.560 --> 26:24.040
So at the moment to get your OTA updates with Android, it downloads it to the user partition

26:24.040 --> 26:27.360
and then copies it over the system partition.

26:27.360 --> 26:33.620
And so if your phone is full of photos and videos and apps and doesn't have enough space

26:33.620 --> 26:39.120
for the huge binary that it needs to download, then your OTA update won't work.

26:39.120 --> 26:41.600
And then you're stuck using an old vulnerable version.

26:41.600 --> 26:44.920
That's if you get an update in the first place.

26:44.920 --> 26:52.000
Whereas now it's going to effectively just download it straight to that system partition,

26:52.000 --> 26:58.160
but only if you are using certain devices that support this A-B partition layout.

26:58.160 --> 26:59.160
Right.

26:59.160 --> 27:03.520
And the other thing too that these those, it's not just like the gig image that it downloads

27:03.520 --> 27:06.080
or even the 200 megabyte image that it downloads.

27:06.080 --> 27:09.040
It's that when it extracts it, then it needs an additional space.

27:09.040 --> 27:12.080
So it needs the compressed image space and it needs to extract it.

27:12.080 --> 27:16.160
And so existing Android has a system partition and like a cache partition.

27:16.160 --> 27:20.880
And that's where it's just a set of reserved space on your phone sitting there waiting

27:20.880 --> 27:24.500
to be used for updates, which most Android phones don't even get these updates.

27:24.500 --> 27:26.580
And it just sits there wasting space.

27:26.580 --> 27:31.500
So starting with Android 7, Google introduced a new feature called seamless updates, which

27:31.500 --> 27:34.400
created a system A and a system B partition.

27:34.400 --> 27:38.300
As you'd expect, only the Pixel supports this at this time for some reason.

27:38.300 --> 27:44.240
And then starting with version 8, that A-B partition swap update where you update partition

27:44.240 --> 27:47.460
B while you're running from partition A and then you swap them at boot time.

27:47.460 --> 27:49.320
And if there's a failure, you just swap back.

27:49.320 --> 27:52.760
We've heard Fedora and Canonical talking about this a lot recently too.

27:52.760 --> 27:56.280
But they're going to start streaming updates, Joe, to that second partition at the block

27:56.280 --> 27:57.280
level.

27:57.280 --> 28:02.400
Like block updates over the internet, I would imagine compressed right into this partition,

28:02.400 --> 28:05.080
no big image to download and extract.

28:05.080 --> 28:09.820
So they're going to be able to remove using that cache partition altogether.

28:09.820 --> 28:11.600
And it'll just be block by block.

28:11.600 --> 28:13.000
It'll come down to your phone.

28:13.000 --> 28:16.760
And when it's all settled in the right order, you'll reboot and you'll be running from a

28:16.760 --> 28:17.760
new partition.

28:17.760 --> 28:19.840
DD over the network, essentially.

28:19.840 --> 28:20.840
Yeah.

28:20.840 --> 28:21.840
Yeah, really.

28:21.840 --> 28:26.680
And they're going to actually backport it to 7.0 as well.

28:26.680 --> 28:30.400
Mostly I would imagine to upgrade Pixel phones because, again, only the Pixel support this.

28:30.400 --> 28:33.000
But an OEM could do this if they wanted to.

28:33.000 --> 28:36.680
It's built into 7.0 and it's going to be extended in Android 8.0.

28:36.680 --> 28:40.480
But the big question is, why are none of the OEMs doing this?

28:40.480 --> 28:46.840
Oh, that's the long, dark tunnel that is the debate about Android OEMs and who's responsible

28:46.840 --> 28:51.960
for what and how long they should be supported, at least at the end of the day, as I love

28:51.960 --> 28:54.420
to say.

28:54.420 --> 28:59.400
This is going to make it possible and safer to upgrade these phones if vendors choose

28:59.400 --> 29:00.580
to do it.

29:00.580 --> 29:04.640
If the vendors choose to take advantage of it, they now have a better mechanism in place

29:04.640 --> 29:05.800
to facilitate it.

29:05.800 --> 29:07.360
That seems like a good thing.

29:07.360 --> 29:10.920
And if you're buying a Pixel, you've got more bulletproof updates.

29:10.920 --> 29:12.540
That seems like a good thing.

29:12.540 --> 29:14.780
It does sort of put a little salt in the wound.

29:14.780 --> 29:19.240
There was no way for me to read this article and not be sort of bitter about it because

29:19.240 --> 29:25.060
this is a great, safe way to upgrade a phone OS, but the vast, vast majority of the users

29:25.060 --> 29:26.060
will never get it.

29:26.060 --> 29:27.060
Yeah.

29:27.060 --> 29:28.880
Well, you never know.

29:28.880 --> 29:33.200
Now that we've got this extra feature of the streaming updates, maybe more OEMs will take

29:33.200 --> 29:34.200
it on board.

29:34.200 --> 29:35.200
And you know what?

29:35.200 --> 29:39.720
For our audience, it would really be good enough if the ROM community took it on because

29:39.720 --> 29:43.840
this could be just an awesome way for ROMs to update, especially ones that frequently

29:43.840 --> 29:44.840
update.

29:44.840 --> 29:47.240
And every time you update, there's a chance of a problem.

29:47.240 --> 29:53.720
So if you can build a safer mechanism, the biggest users of this might actually be the

29:53.720 --> 29:54.720
ROM community.

29:54.720 --> 29:55.960
And that could be good, too.

29:55.960 --> 30:00.560
Yeah, every time I flash a new nightly update, I hold my breath.

30:00.560 --> 30:01.560
Right?

30:01.560 --> 30:03.440
Wouldn't that be nice if that was a little more stress-free?

30:03.440 --> 30:05.680
And this could achieve that.

30:05.680 --> 30:09.800
Even if your Samsungs and your Hawaii's and your HTCs aren't getting the updates they

30:09.800 --> 30:15.360
need, at least guys like Joe are.

30:15.360 --> 30:16.360
Very good, Joe.

30:16.360 --> 30:20.120
Well, I want to encourage everybody to go over to linuxactionnews.com slash subscribe

30:20.120 --> 30:24.520

And so next week's episode will be a day late because I'm going to be going to our camp

30:42.920 --> 30:47.600
and won't be around to record as we normally do on Sunday.

30:47.600 --> 30:50.600
So look out for that basically a day later than normal.

30:50.600 --> 30:55.400
Yeah, and if you have a question for Joe, go over to late night Linux website and submit

30:55.400 --> 30:58.680
a question for those guys because you guys are seeking questions right now for odd camp.

30:58.680 --> 31:00.560
So put a plug in for that too.

31:00.560 --> 31:04.400
And catch us next Monday, even if it's a day late, maybe it'll be Tuesday, but catch us

31:04.400 --> 31:08.520
next week for our weekly take on Linux and open source news.

31:08.520 --> 31:09.960
I'm at Chris LAS.

31:09.960 --> 31:11.520
I'm at Joe Rissington.

31:11.520 --> 31:14.120
Thank you for joining us and we'll see you next week.

31:14.120 --> 31:32.520
See you later.
