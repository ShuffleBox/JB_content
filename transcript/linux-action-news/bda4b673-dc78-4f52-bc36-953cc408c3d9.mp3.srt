00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,280
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, our weekly take on Linux and the open source world.

2
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:19,880
This is episode 60, recorded on July 1st, 2018.

3
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:20,880
I'm Chris.

4
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:21,880
And I'm Joe.

5
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:22,880
Hello, Joe.

6
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:23,880
It's good to be connected with you.

7
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:27,240
And we have huge news, lots to get into this week.

8
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:30,840
So let's start down at the infrastructure level, the chip level, if you will.

9
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:37,160
Yes, Psi5, who are the predominant company producing RISC-V chips and boards, have come

10
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:42,440
out and said that they can do better than ARM when it comes to power efficiency.

11
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:43,440
That's quite the claim.

12
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:47,240
Yeah, the California-based Psi5 announced the availability of the E2 Core IP series

13
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:53,520
of chips, which are configurable microcontroller cores that use less power and can cost less

14
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:55,600
than, say, an ARM processor.

15
00:00:55,600 --> 00:01:00,880
So remember, Psi5 licenses its chip designs to other companies, which then customize them

16
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:04,600
for manufacturing on their own inside their own products.

17
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:09,240
But compared to ARM, they have a much more open approach to the designs of the actual

18
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:10,420
CPUs.

19
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:15,980
And the E2 series extends Psi5's product line with two new standard cores, the E21, which

20
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:22,160
is a mainstream performance core for microcontrollers, sensors, motion things, Internet of Things

21
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:23,700
types of devices.

22
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:28,400
But then there's also the E20, which is a power-efficient standard core designed for

23
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:34,520
more mixed devices, like finite state controls and devices like open and controlling of DAMs.

24
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:39,080
You combine that with their previously announced desktop-level designs, which are built first

25
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:42,560
for Linux, and the whole range is open.

26
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:46,780
The whole range, the spec, the design, all of it is open.

27
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:49,840
And some of them are Linux-first devices.

28
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:53,680
Except that they've run into a bit of criticism recently for not being quite as open as people

29
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:54,680
hoped they would be.

30
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:56,320
Joe, I know.

31
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:57,640
The devil is always in the details.

32
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:03,280
You hear all these good things, and then somebody comes along and points out the well, actually.

33
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,280
So this is Ron Minnick.

34
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:07,640
He has been working with the Core Boot project for more than a decade.

35
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:12,280
He spearheads the effort to getting Core Boot on new Chrome OS devices at Google.

36
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:14,440
And he commented recently on the Hi5 chips.

37
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:20,760
He says, the Hi5 is really no more open today than your average ARM SoC.

38
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:23,680
In fact, it may be even less open than the Power Chips.

39
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:29,040
He says, I realize there's been a lot of hope that RISC-V implied general openness.

40
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:34,700
But open instruction sets do not necessarily result in open implementations.

41
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:40,100
An open implementation of RISC-V will require a commitment on the part of a company to open

42
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:44,200
up at all levels, not just the instruction set.

43
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:50,200
And if you dig down here, it turns out there is this issue with the DRAM controller and

44
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:57,240
the fact that the timing for the DRAM has to be set on boot every single time by proprietary

45
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:58,240
firmware.

46
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:03,160
However, it seems that Ron talking about this may have actually worked because Sci-5 are

47
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:06,080
now promising to open source all that stuff.

48
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:09,920
Yeah, talk about a really fast response on Sci-5's part.

49
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:13,620
And I wonder why it took a cage rattling to even get here.

50
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:18,160
But Sci-5 has commented on this saying that they are committed to supporting an open source

51
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:23,000
community and they're pleased to report that after discussions with IP partners, they're

52
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,480
going to be able to release all of the code.

53
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:31,060
The source code for the FSBL, including the DDR initialization, will be available shortly.

54
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:36,140
We can attest here that there is no other firmware run by the system during boot.

55
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:42,580
This is quite a relief to me because I'd pinned so many hopes on RISC-V as the future of computing.

56
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:43,580
Not right now.

57
00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:48,720
It's ready for mainstream use, but it's Linux first, as you said, and it's supposed to be

58
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:49,720
completely open.

59
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:53,640
And when I first heard about it not being open, I was really disappointed by that.

60
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:58,120
So I'm really hoping that you make good on these promises and that we can actually get

61
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:04,240
some properly free software running, free hardware sometime soon that can compete with

62
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:05,240
x86.

63
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:08,400
Well, OK, maybe that's a bit of a dream, but at least can compete with ARM, right?

64
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,400
It's so close.

65
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,400
It's so close.

66
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:13,300
Like, look at the Hi5 Unleashed, the U540.

67
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:14,640
It's really almost there.

68
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:18,460
It's a five core, 1.5 gigahertz CPU.

69
00:04:18,460 --> 00:04:19,900
It's fully Linux capable.

70
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:24,100
It's got gigabit ethernet, eight gigabytes of DDR4 RAM.

71
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:29,500
It's got a micro SD card reader, and it's around $1,000 today before it's even hit mass

72
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:31,200
market scale.

73
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:37,760
That's pretty dang close to a standard desktop or especially a standard ARM device.

74
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:43,060
If this is today, 2018, then imagine where we could be in 2020 for $1,000.

75
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:45,120
It could be a very competitive system.

76
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:48,940
And the fact that they are building this with Linux first and apparently even going back

77
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:53,600
and fixing rough areas that needed to be addressed is a very positive sign, I think.

78
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:57,120
So I say it's still worth following because it's getting more and more promising.

79
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:02,360
Yeah, but you're not going to be able to dual boot and play Fortnite on it, are you?

80
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:04,240
That's what I have a mobile device for.

81
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:07,960
In the meantime, at least I'll be sending emails potentially a little more securely.

82
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:14,080
Yeah, the EFF have announced start TLS everywhere, which they are hoping is going to be to email

83
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:16,880
as let's encrypt is to HTTPS.

84
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:17,880
Right.

85
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:23,960
So it's really all about start TTLS, which is an addition to SMTP, which really allows

86
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:28,280
one email server to say to the other, hey, I just want to connect to you over an encrypted

87
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:29,720
communications channel.

88
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:33,960
And then the recipient email server will say, sure, let's negotiate an encrypted communications

89
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:34,960
channel.

90
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:38,960
The server set up the channels and the emails delivered securely so that anybody listening

91
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:42,920
on the traffic between the servers only sees the encrypted data.

92
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:48,280
But keep in mind, start TTLS is not a replacement for secure end to end solutions completely.

93
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:53,040
Instead, it really allows email service providers and administrators to provide a baseline measure

94
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:57,720
of security just against outside adversaries in general and provides authentication and

95
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:58,720
verification.

96
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:02,120
Yeah, because the problem this is aiming to solve is that start TLS is used by a lot of

97
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:06,760
servers, but because they're not validating the certificates that they're using, then

98
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:08,120
they may as well not be.

99
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:12,240
Yeah, this lack of validation almost makes it pointless.

100
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:16,160
And as a result, the ecosystem is kind of stuck in this whole chicken and egg problem.

101
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:20,500
No one validates certificates because the other party often doesn't have a valid one.

102
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:24,320
And the long tail of mail servers that continue to use invalid certificates because no one's

103
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:25,720
validating them anyway.

104
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:30,400
So who wants to fix it when no one's really doing it right in the very first place?

105
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:33,800
But that's where this effort really comes in.

106
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:35,760
Start TLS to the rescue here.

107
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:41,520
If everyone can use start TLS with a let's encrypt back end to automatically get a valid

108
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:46,980
certificate from let's encrypt, then when you implement this at day one, you'll have

109
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:50,600
a valid certificate, then it's all of a sudden it's worth verifying and checking.

110
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:54,680
The more servers that have valid certificates, the more reason there is to verify and check

111
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:57,440
and you sort of solve this chicken and egg problem.

112
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:01,040
Now obviously this isn't going to replace end to end encryption, but if you have to

113
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:09,020
use email, then it's way better if you've got start TLS configured properly and working.

114
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:12,160
So it's a good initiative by the EFF to do this, I think.

115
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:16,520
They're kind of expanding a little bit here, but they're expanding in the right directions

116
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:17,520
as far as I'm concerned.

117
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:22,360
Okay, well, let's shift gears completely and talk about a story that got a lot of attention

118
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:24,440
in the last couple of days.

119
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:27,960
Gen2's GitHub organization was compromised.

120
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:32,840
Yeah, a malicious actor took control and locked the developers out.

121
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:35,080
And so that's a go to GitHub support.

122
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:41,880
And thankfully it was disabled pretty quickly and now it seems to be almost fixed.

123
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:47,260
It's not quite back up yet, but they have sorted out all of the malicious commits and

124
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:51,400
everything and they're just dealing with the pull requests as we record this.

125
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:54,480
It's quite embarrassing for Gen2, isn't it?

126
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:56,240
Really this is all hands to yellow alert.

127
00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:01,600
We're not full red alert here because the GitHub organization that got hacked was a

128
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:07,520
mirror of this project's upstream source and work, including the stuff that touches the

129
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:10,960
distributions and all of that was not affected by this.

130
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:16,100
So it sucks and it's embarrassing, but it didn't actually impact the core source code

131
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:17,680
of the project.

132
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:23,320
And to Gen2's credit, because these things do happen, their response has been outstanding.

133
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:26,980
In fact, one of the best responses I've seen from a Linux distribution.

134
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:28,840
They have status pages.

135
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:33,380
They have a Wiki entry that's a post-mortem as they learn more and they're keeping their

136
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:35,920
GitHub users updated as well.

137
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:40,780
And they're clearly documenting their current interactions with the GitHub organization.

138
00:08:40,780 --> 00:08:42,600
It's really done responsibly.

139
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:46,320
So I have to give Gen2 credit for that because bad things happen and when you consider how

140
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:50,280
many Linux distributions are out there, the fact that their infrastructure isn't attacked

141
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:53,080
and compromised more often is pretty remarkable.

142
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:57,440
And when it is, I think Gen2's response here should be looked at as a model.

143
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:00,680
It sucks that it happened, but how they're handling the response is top notch.

144
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:04,320
But surely no one's using Gen2 these days anyway, they've all moved over to Arch, haven't

145
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,320
they?

146
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:06,320
Oh, that hurts.

147
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,320
That hurts.

148
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:08,320
That hurts, Joe.

149
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,320
That hurts.

150
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:11,240
Obviously not because people cared.

151
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:14,560
Surely no one would be dumb enough to run a server on Gen2 or anything.

152
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:15,560
Hey now.

153
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:17,040
You know I've done that.

154
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:18,400
You know I've done that.

155
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:25,000
The project has really handled this well and the information was spread wide and far.

156
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:29,280
So there does still seem to be interest in the old Gen2 project, even if people like

157
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:31,280
me have stopped using it on their servers.

158
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:33,240
That was years ago, Joe.

159
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:37,120
I was a different person then.

160
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:42,960
dio.co slash action.

161
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:47,320
That's where you go to get a $100 credit over at DigitalOcean.

162
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:51,600
Now, I'd be sitting here and I'd be pretty amped about a $10 credit, because that's what

163
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:52,600
it used to be.

164
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:56,700
But when crazy DigitalOcean blow out the doors and took it up to $100, I thought there's

165
00:09:56,700 --> 00:10:01,320
only going to be maybe a week of this, maybe two weeks, maybe three weeks.

166
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:02,320
I don't know.

167
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,320
Maybe they forgot.

168
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:04,800
Maybe they forgot they're giving away $100.

169
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:08,080
I don't know what the explanation is because it's too much.

170
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:09,360
It's too much.

171
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:13,560
You can do an incredible amount at DigitalOcean for just $10.

172
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:16,960
But with the $100 credit, you can actually take things to the next level.

173
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:18,440
Try out their flexible droplets.

174
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:20,580
I just deployed one this weekend.

175
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:23,640
You mix and match the resources most appropriate for your needs.

176
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:27,200
They also have dedicated CPU droplets.

177
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:31,320
Now hypothetically, let's say you were going to set up a PeerTube alternative to totally

178
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:32,520
crush YouTube.

179
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:38,260
You would want the dedicated CPU droplets because you get raw performance on those suckers.

180
00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:42,200
So figure out which one works best for you and your application.

181
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:49,560
And just get started by visiting do.co action with an easy-to-use dashboard, a well-documented

182
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:55,560
API, clustered deployments, global availability, data centers all over the world, enterprise

183
00:10:55,560 --> 00:11:00,600
grade SSDs for every single droplet, 40 gigabit connections coming into those Linux boxes

184
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:09,920
that are running KVM with an entire open source stack, do.co action.

185
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:14,920
Let's talk about Amazon, AWS, and their desktop as a service.

186
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:19,600
So that used to be just Windows 7 and Windows 10, but we don't care about that.

187
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:26,040
But now they have launched Amazon Linux 2 with a Marte desktop, which you can run on

188
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:28,560
almost any device.

189
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:32,280
This is Amazon taking Linux very, very seriously indeed.

190
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:33,280
Yeah.

191
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:37,920
They've launched the Amazon Linux workspace that runs Linux 2, like Joe just mentioned,

192
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:43,440
and you get Marte, Firefox, Evolution, Pigeon, LibreOffice, and there's a few extra things

193
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:48,160
you can install, including development tools that are great for developing for AWS, surprise,

194
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:49,160
surprise.

195
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:53,680
They try to really kind of pigeonhole it to four particular types of workloads.

196
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:57,040
They say it's going to be great for people that are looking for a productivity environment

197
00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:02,560
for LibreOffice, or if you want to run something in kiosk mode and economically deploy applications

198
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:04,920
that run in kiosk mode, it'd be great for that.

199
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:11,640
And for quote, unquote, Linux workloads, which they define as data science, machine learning,

200
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:16,200
engineering, and other Linux-friendly workloads.

201
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:20,440
Engineering is a pretty big category, so I like that they consider data science and engineering

202
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:21,440
Linux workloads.

203
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:28,280
And then of course, the desktop environment, which is a combination of workspaces and Amazon

204
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:33,800
Linux 2 that makes it great for all of this, and they include GCC, Mono, and Java, so you

205
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:39,840
can build, test, and deploy your applications to the AWS infrastructure from your AWS Linux

206
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:40,840
desktop, Joe.

207
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:43,000
Well, of course.

208
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,360
It could be quite handy though, I can imagine.

209
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:50,120
It means that you can take your Linux desktop with you anywhere and just log in, done.

210
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:53,280
You don't have to worry about backups, you don't have to worry about migrating data to

211
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:56,820
new machines when you upgrade hardware or whatever.

212
00:12:56,820 --> 00:12:58,520
So that kind of seems appealing.

213
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:02,920
But then, I don't know, about losing control of my computing like this, I don't think as

214
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:04,440
a personal user I'd be interested.

215
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:07,280
I could imagine this being very popular in the enterprise though.

216
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:08,280
Yeah, it's funny you say that.

217
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:11,360
It's definitely not really for personal use, although I've been trying it all week, and

218
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:13,840
I'll talk about that here in a second.

219
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:17,800
But I have witnessed something fascinating in my time in the industry, and that is sort

220
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:19,840
of this ebb and flow.

221
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:25,160
We've started with time-sharing and remote systems, and then we ebbed towards personal

222
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:31,680
computers, getting them as fast as possible, getting as much local resources as possible,

223
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:36,800
and then we sort of flowed back into time-shared computing, but we call it cloud computing

224
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:37,800
now.

225
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:42,000
When I was really getting my start in the industry, it was when DOS was still the primary

226
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
desktop, if you can believe it.

227
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,400
That's how old I am, I know.

228
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:52,280
When I first started in IT, my job was to convert DOS stations into remote windowed

229
00:13:52,280 --> 00:14:00,320
terminal environments, and the way we did this was with these really basic thin clients.

230
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:05,600
They would run Windows CE, and then later they would run Linux, and they would connect

231
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:11,240
to a much more powerful central server with a full desktop environment.

232
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:14,760
That was in the early 90s and then into the late 90s.

233
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:21,720
And then in the 2000s, it was really a focus on getting really fast PCs and desktops.

234
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:25,560
Later on, it was the bring-your-own-device phenomenon.

235
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:31,520
But as things kind of settled down, I have heard from more and more audience members

236
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:36,760
who do their entire job in a remote Amazon session, and I've even heard from some of

237
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:42,520
them that were doing them in Linux Monte sessions, testing them for Amazon for over a year.

238
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:47,240
This has been in the works, and they were off the record running this as their daily

239
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:50,340
driver for a year.

240
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:54,300
And I thought, okay, well, maybe one day Amazon's going to announce this.

241
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:56,640
Maybe one day this will come out, but it's been a year.

242
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:58,240
It's not happening.

243
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:02,580
And then this week, they dropped this huge bomb.

244
00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:09,840
If you have an AWS account and you're current on all of your payments, you can go spin up

245
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:13,600
a Monte desktop on Amazon's infrastructure.

246
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:17,560
And that means you get 800 megabytes up and down download.

247
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:20,880
That means you get incredible CPU performance.

248
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:26,000
That means you get the speed of the AWS infrastructure as your desktop.

249
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,440
And you can spin these things up.

250
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:28,440
You can clone them.

251
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:32,560
You can set up a master image, and you can attach them to your Active Directory so you

252
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:36,640
can authenticate with the same user accounts that you've been using throughout your entire

253
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:37,640
corporation.

254
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:41,840
I mean, this is a slick system, and it works really well.

255
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:44,560
There's just one major flaw.

256
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:47,060
There's no Linux client to connect.

257
00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:48,400
They have a Windows client.

258
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:49,400
They have a Mac client.

259
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:51,860
They have an iOS and Android client.

260
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:54,320
They even have a web client.

261
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:56,920
But if you're on Linux, no client for you.

262
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:58,360
Doesn't matter if you even try the web client.

263
00:15:58,360 --> 00:15:59,620
No client for you.

264
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:01,960
People have tried to get it working under Wine.

265
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:04,360
There's a tutorial to use gaming on Linux.

266
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:06,660
There's a tutorial to use Crossover Office.

267
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:09,720
You can't get it working with stock Wine without a whole bunch of tweaks.

268
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:10,720
No client for Linux.

269
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:14,280
So you got to bust out a Mac to test this thing?

270
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:15,280
You bastard.

271
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:16,280
How dare you?

272
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:18,660
Yeah, basically to try the full-fledged client.

273
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:22,480
I mean, I initially tried it on an iOS device, and that was just painful.

274
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:27,060
But to really spend some time, I busted out a Mac to build out the whole environment and

275
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:28,060
loaded XFCE.

276
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:29,060
Nice.

277
00:16:29,060 --> 00:16:30,060
How did that go?

278
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:33,980
Well, I couldn't quite figure out how to change the default login environment because they're

279
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:37,040
not using, like, GDM or anything like that.

280
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:41,160
And they're not using, like, the defaults when you could go into Etsy and change your

281
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:42,160
default X session.

282
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:43,600
They're not using that stuff.

283
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:47,180
So I wasn't able to make it the default desktop environment.

284
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:49,220
But it's essentially RHEL.

285
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:50,620
It's their version of RHEL.

286
00:16:50,620 --> 00:16:53,160
So I was able to add the extra repository.

287
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:56,300
So I had started installing all kinds of additional applications on this thing.

288
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:57,580
Had a lot of fun with it, really.

289
00:16:57,580 --> 00:17:00,400
It's a real utilitarian setup.

290
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:03,640
It is MATE without any frills.

291
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:05,460
It's pretty basic.

292
00:17:05,460 --> 00:17:08,280
It's got very limited software installed by default.

293
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:12,360
But if you're willing to have some fun and you're willing to add the extra repositories

294
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:16,740
and things like that that are just normal for RHEL, you can get pretty far.

295
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:21,040
You do kind of hit a wall when it comes to things like Telegram and Slack and more kind

296
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:25,220
of modern work environment required software.

297
00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:27,520
But even that's actually possible to get working.

298
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:30,180
So what did you think of the implementation of MATE then?

299
00:17:30,180 --> 00:17:32,340
Boring, but functional.

300
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:36,860
And something I think I'll probably keep around for a little while, I get a couple of months.

301
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:40,420
I have this free tier account where I can run it for a few months for free.

302
00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:45,300
And they've included this feature that they've had with some other implementations on AWS.

303
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:49,980
But it's nice to see it by default with the workspaces where if I log out, after an hour

304
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:53,460
of inactivity, it automatically suspends the workspace.

305
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:55,860
So it's not sitting there running up the clock.

306
00:17:55,860 --> 00:17:56,860
OK.

307
00:17:56,860 --> 00:18:00,900
Because I asked a prominent MATE developer, I think you can guess who.

308
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:02,580
I think we asked the same person.

309
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:03,580
Yeah.

310
00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:05,940
And I asked him if I can quote him.

311
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:06,980
And he said yes.

312
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:11,460
And he said that is the worst implementation of MATE he'd seen.

313
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:14,420
Yeah, I'd say that's a fair interpretation.

314
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:16,540
I mean, to me, it seems utilitarian.

315
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:24,340
My understanding is that Amazon used the inspiration of an upstream MATE developers set up to build

316
00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:25,700
this desktop.

317
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:31,120
And it's not that it's bad because, I mean, stock MATE itself isn't that awful.

318
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:33,860
It's just it's basic and utilitarian.

319
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:37,060
But at the same time, you can modify a lot of that.

320
00:18:37,060 --> 00:18:40,960
It's pretty easy to snap into an existing organization.

321
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:46,220
And you can get like 700 megabytes down, 700 megabytes up with like two milliseconds of

322
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:47,220
latency.

323
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:51,220
So it's got its disadvantages, but it also has its advantages.

324
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:54,700
I think the lack of a Linux client, though, is shameful.

325
00:18:54,700 --> 00:19:00,460
Not only has there been ongoing community requests since 2014 to make a Linux client

326
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:07,040
and a commitment by one of the AWS development teams to actually add this as a feature.

327
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:13,780
The real shameful aspect of this is to really use this, you have to have a fully licensed

328
00:19:13,780 --> 00:19:20,220
copy of Windows or Mac OS on a Mac, which is ridiculous.

329
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:21,640
What's the point of that?

330
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:28,060
Why not allow folks to use super cheap, nice, economical implementations of, say, the XFCE

331
00:19:28,060 --> 00:19:35,140
desktop or Ubuntu MATE that allows them to then remote in to their organization's desktop.

332
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:39,500
Not having a Linux client takes out the number one economic advantage of this.

333
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:44,940
I just had a great conversation while I was in Texas with a listener, their entire organization.

334
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:47,860
More than 100 desktops do just this.

335
00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:53,900
They connect in on a daily basis to Amazon's workspaces, and they run their entire environment

336
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:55,480
in a virtual desktop.

337
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:58,440
And all of those machines are Windows boxes.

338
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:01,980
Not because they want them to be Windows boxes, but because that's how they could get the

339
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:07,500
official client at an economical scale that worked with large business purchasing contracts.

340
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:13,300
So they bought a hundred Dell workstations to run a remote desktop client that remotes

341
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:14,300
into Amazon.

342
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:15,860
And then what's the point?

343
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:19,180
If they could make a Linux version, you could save a ton of money.

344
00:20:19,180 --> 00:20:22,180
And you could have it on a whole range of devices.

345
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:26,700
Yeah, that does seem silly having to pay for a Windows license on top of this.

346
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:29,820
Surely they're going to sort that out sooner rather than later.

347
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:33,220
In the meantime, if you want to go play with it, you can play around for free.

348
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:38,540
And if you have a paid AWS account, you could mess around with their power instance.

349
00:20:38,540 --> 00:20:46,460
It's four CPUs, 16GB of RAM, 100GB of storage, and then their crazy fast AWS internet.

350
00:20:46,460 --> 00:20:48,140
There's a lot you can do here.

351
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:53,540
Also, it made me realize as a desktop Linux user, I could potentially use this to spin

352
00:20:53,540 --> 00:20:59,420
up Windows 7 instances or Windows 10 instances to bang out the occasional Windows thing.

353
00:20:59,420 --> 00:21:04,700
So it's kind of got me just re-looking at hosted desktops and maybe rebuilding my own

354
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:05,700
once again.

355
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:09,620
Well, maybe Google's looking over at this thinking, hmm, we should get into that.

356
00:21:09,620 --> 00:21:14,880
They certainly have reaffirmed their commitment to Linux this week by upping their membership

357
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:19,540
of the Linux Foundation to the platinum level, meaning half a million dollars a year.

358
00:21:19,540 --> 00:21:28,380
Yeah, $500,000 a year going to the Linux Foundation, which is the highest level of membership in

359
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:31,860
the Linux Foundation's nonprofit organization.

360
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:37,380
They were a silver membership, I think, before, which still is $100,000 a year.

361
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:43,160
But platinum members, as part of that, get access to a lot more, apparently including

362
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:45,460
the Linux Foundation board.

363
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:50,740
A member of Google's team, Google's head of open source strategy, she'll be joining the

364
00:21:50,740 --> 00:21:56,180
Linux Foundation's board of directors after this reaffirmation of their commitment to

365
00:21:56,180 --> 00:21:57,180
Linux.

366
00:21:57,180 --> 00:22:03,420
The first thing I thought of when I heard this was Fuchsia and how Google is seemingly

367
00:22:03,420 --> 00:22:11,140
desperate to get rid of the Linux kernel in all of its devices, certainly with the phones

368
00:22:11,140 --> 00:22:16,220
and with the Chromebooks, which may come together, we talked about that last week, under Fuchsia.

369
00:22:16,220 --> 00:22:18,940
That's kind of a long-term goal for them.

370
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:24,580
But then you have to think about the cloud side of things, and that really is why they're

371
00:22:24,580 --> 00:22:25,820
doing this.

372
00:22:25,820 --> 00:22:28,900
It's not really about Android and Chrome OS, I don't think.

373
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:29,940
I agree.

374
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:35,180
You don't pay the Linux Foundation $500,000 to further development of MIR.

375
00:22:35,180 --> 00:22:43,420
You join the Linux Foundation to assert some level of influence over the rest of the industry.

376
00:22:43,420 --> 00:22:51,540
As an example, Google is joining AT&T, Cisco, Fujitsu, Hitachi, Huawei, IBM, Intel, Microsoft,

377
00:22:51,540 --> 00:22:56,220
NEC, Oracle, Qualcomm, Samsung, and VMware as Platinum members.

378
00:22:56,220 --> 00:23:02,300
But the Linux Foundation in totality now has over 800 members at all levels, so keep all

379
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:03,580
of that in mind.

380
00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:09,380
Google will now be one of the biggest contributors, but they're really just one, sitting amongst

381
00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:13,540
Cisco and IBM and Intel and AT&T.

382
00:23:13,540 --> 00:23:15,860
But it is about influence.

383
00:23:15,860 --> 00:23:18,660
It is about getting access.

384
00:23:18,660 --> 00:23:23,220
And that's why when I hear these announcements, I'm excited, and I feel like it'll further

385
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:27,740
the interest of Linux in business.

386
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:30,760
It doesn't really fire me up.

387
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:32,380
It's very much a power play.

388
00:23:32,380 --> 00:23:36,620
You have to wonder to what extent Tencent joining the Linux Foundation at this same

389
00:23:36,620 --> 00:23:42,160
level has influenced this decision by Google to up their commitment here.

390
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:47,060
Because Tencent is a huge Chinese company that are massive in the cloud there, they're

391
00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:48,060
growing.

392
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:51,540
They're starting to have real influence over the industry.

393
00:23:51,540 --> 00:23:57,460
And you wonder if Google wanted to keep up with them by doing this, but then you would

394
00:23:57,460 --> 00:24:02,580
imagine that it's probably been quite a while in development, this decision.

395
00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:07,700
I don't think that they would have just done this with a couple of days notice.

396
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:10,620
Yeah, the pragmatist in me says, you're probably right, Joe.

397
00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:12,740
It's probably been in the works for months.

398
00:24:12,740 --> 00:24:18,700
But then the conspiracy bacon person inside me goes, well, actually, how much is this?

399
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:21,060
It's just a response to Microsoft.

400
00:24:21,060 --> 00:24:27,500
Because Microsoft A, already a platinum level member, B, just bought GitHub, and C, has

401
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:32,940
been making meme images with heart emojis all day long for things that are open source.

402
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:37,220
And Google's sitting back going, man, we're kind of losing this open source narrative

403
00:24:37,220 --> 00:24:38,660
to Microsoft.

404
00:24:38,660 --> 00:24:41,420
Maybe we should make a big investment.

405
00:24:41,420 --> 00:24:48,740
Because along with this $500,000 check that they wrote, they also released this sort of

406
00:24:48,740 --> 00:24:50,580
glowing PR statement.

407
00:24:50,580 --> 00:24:53,020
And it goes a little bit like this.

408
00:24:53,020 --> 00:24:58,540
Open source is an essential part of Google's culture, and we've long recognized the potential

409
00:24:58,540 --> 00:25:07,020
of open ecosystems to grow quickly, which, of course, is a hint towards Android, claiming

410
00:25:07,020 --> 00:25:11,700
that the monster fragmentation that is Android is a nod to open ecosystems.

411
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:12,860
I love how they reframe that.

412
00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:14,100
It continues.

413
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:18,900
We want things to be more resilient and adaptable in the face of change, and we want to create

414
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:20,420
better software.

415
00:25:20,420 --> 00:25:24,540
The Linux Foundation is a fixture in the open source community.

416
00:25:24,540 --> 00:25:25,540
Full stop.

417
00:25:25,540 --> 00:25:26,540
Let's stop right here.

418
00:25:26,540 --> 00:25:27,540
No, it's not.

419
00:25:27,540 --> 00:25:29,260
It is a full fixture in the commercial industry.

420
00:25:29,260 --> 00:25:34,020
It is a full fixture in Payne, Linus, Torvalds, and we all appreciate that.

421
00:25:34,020 --> 00:25:39,580
But in the community of open software developers and free software developers, it is but a

422
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:40,580
footnote.

423
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:41,960
And then they continue.

424
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:47,940
By working closely with the organization, we can better engage the community at large

425
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:53,380
and continue to build a more inclusive ecosystem where everyone can benefit.

426
00:25:53,380 --> 00:25:56,700
Again, none of that is true.

427
00:25:56,700 --> 00:26:00,660
By working closely with the Linux Foundation, they can better engage with the corporate

428
00:26:00,660 --> 00:26:05,700
side of money makers off of Linux, free software, and open source.

429
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:07,640
And I'm not saying that's a bad thing.

430
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:08,640
That's why it's here.

431
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:13,100
Richard Stallman himself is okay with people making money off of free software.

432
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:18,480
And this part about building a more inclusive ecosystem where everyone can benefit, I'll

433
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:20,360
believe that when I see Fuchsia.

434
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:21,760
Show me the source to Fuchsia.

435
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:23,980
Show me that you've licensed it in the GPL.

436
00:26:23,980 --> 00:26:26,460
Then I'm going to believe that statement.

437
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:31,140
Right now, when you write a yearly $500,000 check to the Linux Foundation, what you're

438
00:26:31,140 --> 00:26:34,660
getting from me as part of the Linux community is an acknowledgement that you're helping

439
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:39,740
Linus the Torvald's salary and helping further the interests of commercial Linux.

440
00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:43,780
Not a bad thing, but I'm not opening up my pants to Google for this.

441
00:26:43,780 --> 00:26:44,780
Okay.

442
00:26:44,780 --> 00:26:48,220
But what about their investment in KaiOS, which they've done this week?

443
00:26:48,220 --> 00:26:54,600
KaiOS, I think that's how you say it, K-A-I-O-S, which is what Firefox OS ended up being after

444
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:56,340
that died.

445
00:26:56,340 --> 00:26:59,620
It shows that they do care about open source, doesn't it?

446
00:26:59,620 --> 00:27:05,260
Or does it just show that they care about getting their apps on systems that are too

447
00:27:05,260 --> 00:27:09,100
low powered and cheap to run Android because it's so bloated?

448
00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:14,020
KaiOS, which is powering those new banana phones from Nokia, like the ones from the

449
00:27:14,020 --> 00:27:18,300
Matrix that you guys probably heard about a few weeks ago or maybe even months ago now,

450
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:21,660
where the phone slides down and it looks like the old school Matrix phone, but a little

451
00:27:21,660 --> 00:27:22,660
more modern.

452
00:27:22,660 --> 00:27:24,820
Well, it's running KaiOS.

453
00:27:24,820 --> 00:27:27,220
So it's already on some devices in India.

454
00:27:27,220 --> 00:27:32,300
In fact, it's one of the number one mobile OSes in India already.

455
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:38,220
And now it's shipping on these Nokia devices, which are available to Joe but not to us slackers

456
00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:40,060
over here in the States apparently.

457
00:27:40,060 --> 00:27:47,620
And they're running this KaiOS, which turns out to be a fork of Firefox OS just without

458
00:27:47,620 --> 00:27:49,260
all of the pesky source.

459
00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:53,540
You know, don't ask them about that because they're quote unquote working on it right

460
00:27:53,540 --> 00:27:54,540
now.

461
00:27:54,540 --> 00:27:57,940
They've been quote unquote working on it for months and they just haven't gotten around

462
00:27:57,940 --> 00:28:02,740
to publishing the source code, which I think I was just lamenting last week about Fuchsia

463
00:28:02,740 --> 00:28:08,900
OS and when you change the license to something much more permissive, then everyone else loses.

464
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:15,380
Well, here we are one week later and we have KaiOS and Google just spent $22 million to

465
00:28:15,380 --> 00:28:19,040
make sure they could get the Google apps on the devices that you were going to buy to

466
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:22,620
avoid the Google ecosystem, at least me.

467
00:28:22,620 --> 00:28:28,420
That was actually what appealed to me is you have these traditional non-smart phone Linux

468
00:28:28,420 --> 00:28:34,500
powered devices that have GPS, they have LTE, they have Wi-Fi hotspot.

469
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:41,740
They have basic phone functionality in a device that has 20 days of standby time.

470
00:28:41,740 --> 00:28:46,360
And one of the other perks was no tie in to the Google tracking system.

471
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:49,700
But all of that has changed with this $22 million investment because you're going to

472
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:54,580
get Google apps built into this thing, Google Maps, Gmail, et cetera.

473
00:28:54,580 --> 00:28:58,700
Which for you is a bad thing, but for the users is not because a lot of people want

474
00:28:58,700 --> 00:28:59,700
that stuff.

475
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:00,700
Surely most people do.

476
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:01,700
Right.

477
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:02,700
Absolutely.

478
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:03,700
It's definitely a good thing.

479
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:08,260
You know, Google Maps, YouTube, Google search on your phone is generally a good thing.

480
00:29:08,260 --> 00:29:11,140
It gives you more access to information.

481
00:29:11,140 --> 00:29:15,940
I just kind of lost out because this was sort of a safe haven I could, I could maybe jump

482
00:29:15,940 --> 00:29:20,940
to where my phone could be like my phone used to be when I was in my twenties.

483
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:25,580
In my twenties, the phone was just something I kept in my pocket for days and on the weekends

484
00:29:25,580 --> 00:29:29,840
I'd plug it in and then I would unplug it on Monday and I would use my phone.

485
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:33,300
And I just kind of missed that because I just, you know, a little nostalgic for that.

486
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:34,700
And this was sort of the answer.

487
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:36,780
I mean, it was a matrix style phone.

488
00:29:36,780 --> 00:29:39,240
Like what could be more of the nineties?

489
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:44,700
But Google, Google recognized that fact and they decided to swoop in and give them basically

490
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:47,780
$22 million, which they couldn't resist.

491
00:29:47,780 --> 00:29:49,340
Which is such chump change to Google.

492
00:29:49,340 --> 00:29:53,180
I mean, they get fined way more than that regularly.

493
00:29:53,180 --> 00:29:56,380
This is just back of the sofa rummaging for them.

494
00:29:56,380 --> 00:30:00,020
But this is very important for them because it's potentially reaching the next billion

495
00:30:00,020 --> 00:30:02,220
as people keep saying.

496
00:30:02,220 --> 00:30:07,740
It's them getting their apps on feature phones that are incredibly cheap compared with smartphones

497
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:11,820
to markets where people simply can't afford an iPhone or an Android device.

498
00:30:11,820 --> 00:30:12,820
Yeah.

499
00:30:12,820 --> 00:30:13,820
I don't disagree.

500
00:30:13,820 --> 00:30:17,660
Tim, don't you kind of feel like this is an acknowledgement by the market and by the biggest

501
00:30:17,660 --> 00:30:22,220
market player, Google, that Firefox OS was onto something, that there was value there?

502
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:25,260
I mean, maybe $22 million worth of value?

503
00:30:25,260 --> 00:30:29,580
Well, evidently it does have some value to them, but I don't think it's specifically

504
00:30:29,580 --> 00:30:30,580
Firefox OS.

505
00:30:30,580 --> 00:30:35,340
I think it's just that this is an OS which will work on a feature phone and Android is

506
00:30:35,340 --> 00:30:36,340
too bloated.

507
00:30:36,340 --> 00:30:38,340
As I said before, it's just too big.

508
00:30:38,340 --> 00:30:45,460
We've tried twice now to make affordable Android phones with low amounts of RAM and everything,

509
00:30:45,460 --> 00:30:50,780
but they just cannot get that price low enough because you can't make hardware cheap enough

510
00:30:50,780 --> 00:30:55,460
that is capable of running Android and having anything other than a horrendous experience.

511
00:30:55,460 --> 00:31:01,900
So they needed some other route into that market and this appears to be their best bet.

512
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:06,780
I don't think it's necessarily a massive vote of confidence in it in particular.

513
00:31:06,780 --> 00:31:07,780
No.

514
00:31:07,780 --> 00:31:11,580
You just described the market pressure for Fuchsia, didn't you?

515
00:31:11,580 --> 00:31:12,580
Damage-o.

516
00:31:12,580 --> 00:31:18,940
Well, indeed, we'll have to see what actually becomes of Fuchsia and whether or not not

517
00:31:18,940 --> 00:31:23,500
being based on Java and all of that stuff means that it can actually run on much lower

518
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:24,500
end hardware.

519
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:28,260
I'm not holding my breath on that and Google loves a hedge, don't they?

520
00:31:28,260 --> 00:31:32,940
They love to hedge their bets and that's why they've got like 10 messaging services or

521
00:31:32,940 --> 00:31:38,340
whatever because they just always back a few different horses and then see which one of

522
00:31:38,340 --> 00:31:41,100
them actually works out and then just kill the other stuff.

523
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:47,980
And so they might well, if Fuchsia works out, just kill KaiOS and just start shipping Fuchsia,

524
00:31:47,980 --> 00:31:55,220
but they've got different groups competing within the same company and that probably

525
00:31:55,220 --> 00:31:58,620
is quite a good strategy because it means that they all want to keep their jobs so they

526
00:31:58,620 --> 00:32:00,660
want to make the thing as good as possible.

527
00:32:00,660 --> 00:32:01,660
The decision year.

528
00:32:01,660 --> 00:32:07,220
Like 2018 for Google is where they're hedging their bets and positioning themselves to go

529
00:32:07,220 --> 00:32:08,220
anywhere.

530
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:15,060
Chrome OS with Linux apps, an investment in Fuchsia, doubling down on Linux Foundation's

531
00:32:15,060 --> 00:32:23,620
yearly contribution while in the background, $22 million is getting kicked over to KaiOS.

532
00:32:23,620 --> 00:32:29,180
Like 2018 right now, what we are watching at the midway point is Google at a fork in

533
00:32:29,180 --> 00:32:33,980
the road and I would bet within the next year or so they're going to make a hard decision

534
00:32:33,980 --> 00:32:36,460
and double down on a certain direction.

535
00:32:36,460 --> 00:32:40,580
Right now we are witnessing them line everything up to see which is the best route.

536
00:32:40,580 --> 00:32:41,580
No way.

537
00:32:41,580 --> 00:32:42,580
They'll never make a decision.

538
00:32:42,580 --> 00:32:47,580
They've got enough money to just keep throwing it at different bets and they can wait a few

539
00:32:47,580 --> 00:32:48,580
years.

540
00:32:48,580 --> 00:32:51,940
I don't think we're going to see a decision within a year or two on this.

541
00:32:51,940 --> 00:32:57,760
I think that they've got enough options to just keep them all as options and try a little

542
00:32:57,760 --> 00:33:01,180
bit here, try a little bit there, see how that does, see how that does.

543
00:33:01,180 --> 00:33:05,660
I just don't think you're going to get them, for example, killing Fuchsia or killing Chrome

544
00:33:05,660 --> 00:33:08,100
OS or killing Android.

545
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:09,260
That's not how Google works.

546
00:33:09,260 --> 00:33:10,340
Look at them historically.

547
00:33:10,340 --> 00:33:14,860
They just have multiple competing products from the same company.

548
00:33:14,860 --> 00:33:15,860
Yeah, you know what?

549
00:33:15,860 --> 00:33:16,860
Fair enough.

550
00:33:16,860 --> 00:33:17,860
I can't argue that.

551
00:33:17,860 --> 00:33:18,860
You make a good point.

552
00:33:18,860 --> 00:33:19,860
I guess there's only one way.

553
00:33:19,860 --> 00:33:21,860
We just have to wait and see and we'll keep covering it.
