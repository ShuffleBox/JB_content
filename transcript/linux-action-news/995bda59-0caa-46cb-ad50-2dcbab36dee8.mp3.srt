00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,160
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, episode 111, recorded on June 23rd, 2019. I'm Chris.

2
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:11,160
And I'm Joe.

3
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:16,160
Hello, Joe. We start out this week with a story that is getting a lot of discussion

4
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:22,360
online, and that is Ubuntu's plan to drop i386 support in 1910.

5
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:27,800
Yeah, this has been a long time coming. They've been discussing this for well over a year,

6
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:34,120
and now is the time to do it before the LTS. It's going to be dropped in 1910 in preparation

7
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:40,000
for the first LTS 2004 that will just have no i386 support at all.

8
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,920
Yeah, the post on the Canonical Discourse site reads, the Ubuntu engineering team has

9
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:52,800
reviewed the facts before us and concluded that we should not continue to carry the i386

10
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:59,880
support forward. Consequently, i386 will not be included as an architecture for 1910 release,

11
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:06,040
and will shortly begin the process of disabling it for the series across the Ubuntu infrastructure.

12
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:09,380
And they go on, and this is the part that really caught a lot of attention. While this

13
00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:14,860
means we will not provide 32-bit builds of new upstream versions of libraries, there

14
00:01:14,860 --> 00:01:19,560
are a number of ways that 32-bit applications can continue to be made available to users

15
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:21,120
in later Ubuntu releases.

16
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:26,120
Well, virtualization being the obvious one, and potentially Flatpak and Snaps.

17
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:31,240
Even a chroot of the 1804 libraries, because 1804, it has many years of support ahead of

18
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:32,240
it.

19
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:35,560
Yeah, another four years, which should be enough time, hopefully, to migrate away from

20
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:38,920
the various applications that are still using 32-bit components.

21
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:42,680
I mean, this is a thing that's happening. We've been talking about it for a year on

22
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:47,640
this show. OpenMandriva also announced this week their plans to drop the 32-bit release

23
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:51,880
in sort of a transitionary method. What are your thoughts on this, Joe? I mean, it kind

24
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:58,240
of feels like this is the future in a way. This story made me realize, I'm an old man,

25
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:04,120
by the way, because I have been here for the transition from 8-bit to 16-bit to 32-bit,

26
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:08,800
and now I'm watching the 64-bit transition. And this one seems like the sloppiest of all.

27
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:13,960
It does seem to be a very painful transition, definitely. It's been dragged out for many

28
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:18,720
years at this point. I think the way that Canonical have done this with Ubuntu has made

29
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:24,580
a lot of sense. They, first of all, dropped the ISO images, and they stopped automatically

30
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:31,880
upgrading people to 1904 in preparation, really, for an inevitable eventuality. And that is

31
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:40,080
that they can't just keep building that 32-bit i386 repo because of all the QA testing security

32
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,080
issues that come with it.

33
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:45,040
Well, and think about it from the Canonical developers' position. Once you make an announcement

34
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:49,640
like this, you still have to wait for all of the production-supported systems to work

35
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:55,940
their way out. So if you think about it, that would be 1404, 1604, and obviously 1804 all

36
00:02:55,940 --> 00:03:01,280
have years of support left. So they will have to continue to maintain these libraries even

37
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:07,080
after this announcement and this release is final. So it's long-term planning.

38
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:11,440
Yeah, you might have to pay to get some of those, like 1404, but yeah, that will be supported

39
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:18,760
potentially for another few years still. So this is extremely long-term planning from

40
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:22,480
them. And they have to draw a line at some point, don't they?

41
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:28,400
It does seem inevitable as the steady progress of time marches on. And I would not be surprised

42
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:33,280
if other distributions start having this same conversation in the next year or so. It may

43
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:38,720
be the number one conversation over the next year. And oftentimes, Canonical and Ubuntu

44
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:44,720
are kind of at the forefront of these kinds of decisions. I think of Mir and Upstart.

45
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:49,440
They weren't really popular decisions, but let's be frank. When they decided to choose

46
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:54,640
Mir, development on Wayland was going nowhere. It wasn't until they committed to Mir that

47
00:03:54,640 --> 00:04:01,400
Wayland picked up. And to be honest with you, Joe, the same is really true for Snaps. Flatpaks

48
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:06,160
weren't even called Flatpaks then. XGG Apps, I think is what they were called. And they

49
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:10,920
were going nowhere until Snaps were announced. I kind of think the reality is the same here

50
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:13,960
for this transition from i386 support.

51
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:18,600
Well, it took a few days, but the community did react to this. And it turns out that there

52
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:25,140
are quite a few, not even that niche cases, that still need some 32-bit libraries and

53
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:29,160
components to work properly, specifically Steam and Wine.

54
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:33,960
Yeah, you're right, Joe. 32-bit is alive and well in the gaming world. In fact, friend

55
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:38,520
of the show Popey, Canonical employee, did a little testing of his own and the results

56
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:45,520
were pretty much miss, not so much hit. A lot of things depend on those 32-bit libraries.

57
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:50,000
I'm not telling anybody anything they don't know that's ever attempted to get kind of

58
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,140
any sort of gaming setup on Linux. You really have to get all of those libraries installed

59
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:58,160
for it to work properly. But does that mean it should always be that way?

60
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:04,400
Well, hopefully not. Hopefully, this is going to be the impetus to push forward development

61
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:10,600
and move into the 21st century and stop using i386. And we do have to stress that this is

62
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:15,960
32-bit x86 we're talking about. It's nothing to do with ARM 32-bit, which is still going

63
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:17,560
strong and probably will be for a while.

64
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:21,280
Yeah, you're right. It's kind of funny we have to make that disclosure now. ARM 32-bit

65
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:27,960
is fine, guys. It's fine. It's fine. But really, I'm a little disappointed because there has

66
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:33,840
been a significant backlash to this announcement. It really kind of kicked off when that Valve

67
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:38,400
developer tweeted that they're dropping support for Ubuntu going forward. And then from there,

68
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:41,560
you had a change.org petition that people started signing.

69
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:42,560
Yeah.

70
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:49,000
I know. I don't know. I mean, I don't even think it's broke 200 people yet. But it really,

71
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:55,000
it started to stoke the internet outrage machine. And I'm a little disappointed because you

72
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:00,120
can see different Canonical employees immediately beginning to backtrack now. And now Canonical

73
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:06,760
is repositioning this as like a firm thing we're doing. And now it's a, hey, it's a proposal.

74
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:11,040
And it's not out yet. And we may change things. Guys, calm down.

75
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:15,720
Yeah, it's funny. There was a decision that had been made. And then now they're talking

76
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:20,680
about it as a proposal. And that is, well, you could say it's them listening to feedback

77
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:26,720
or dealing with the backlash. But this whole backlash has happened at the weekend. So we'll

78
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:32,080
have to see in this coming week how this is dealt with and whether they do officially

79
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:36,880
backtrack on it or whether they double down and say, look, if it means you moving off

80
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:41,560
to another distro, so be it. This is what we're doing. We've made a decision. And we're

81
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:42,560
going to stick with it.

82
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:48,840
Yeah, the timeline is not great here. So the announcement is made on Tuesday. And the language

83
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:54,340
is strong. You know, we're doing this thing. This is how it's going to be. And that happens

84
00:06:54,340 --> 00:07:00,280
on Tuesday. The internet doesn't care. Nothing happens, apparently. But then on Friday, a

85
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:04,680
Valve developer tweets that they're dropping support. And the internet outrage machine

86
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:09,240
goes into overdrive while all of the Canonical employees are, you know, having themselves

87
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:13,480
a weekend. It's its worst case scenario in a PR event here.

88
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:17,920
Well, I really do hope they don't backtrack on this. It's been difficult for the Canonical

89
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:22,940
employees basically on their free time trying to deal with this. But presumably, on Monday

90
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:27,760
morning, when they actually get together and discuss this, there will be a decision made

91
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:32,780
and maybe some sort of public statement about it. And I really hope that they do just double

92
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:37,760
down it and say, look, we are pushing forward for once. We're not going to just cave into

93
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:39,460
this outrage culture.

94
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:42,640
That would be great. I don't think that's what's going to happen. They're going to come

95
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:48,280
up with some sort of solution that involves just moving the 1804 maintain libraries forward

96
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:54,620
to 1910. And yeah, that's great. I think at the end of the day, I'm pretty disappointed.

97
00:07:54,620 --> 00:08:01,740
I think watching this entire discussion happen has made me realize that Canonical and Linux

98
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:06,160
project development in general, open source project development, really, in general, is

99
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:11,620
really subjective to outrage development. You start down a path, the internet freaks

100
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:17,500
out, and you turn to something that's less objectionable by the outraged Twitter groups.

101
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:21,600
And we all kind of suffer in the long term. We don't make the dramatic progress that we

102
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:26,480
really need. We make a compromised progress. And the rest of the end users, the silent

103
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:32,280
majority suffer. We don't get the real change we need. We get some sort of compromised end

104
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:36,680
product that satisfies the people that are upset over the weekend.

105
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:41,840
But isn't that kind of the point of open source development? Whereas, if you take something

106
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:48,160
like Mac OS dropping 32-bit support, that will have happened internally, the discussion.

107
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:52,800
Whereas, because this is open source, the discussion happens externally out in public.

108
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,480
And isn't that a good thing?

109
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:57,760
That's complicated. I think what you need is you need the public discussion because there

110
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:03,680
has been a lot of good points made online on Twitter and various different outlets that

111
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:08,480
are worth considering that Canonical should reflect on. At the same time, you have to

112
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:14,360
have people that are really committed to a vision that won't just cave to the outrage,

113
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:18,940
that are willing to see the big picture through. You got to have a balance there.

114
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:23,360
You do have to have a balance. And it's probably better for people to have the discussion in

115
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:28,340
the correct place. And just ranting on Twitter probably isn't the correct place for that.

116
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:33,840
In a calm discussion on the proper mailing list or on their discourse forum or whatever,

117
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:36,840
that would seem to me to be the correct place to do it.

118
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:41,760
I would love to see a rational, technological discussion around this. Imagine if all of

119
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:46,040
that energy had gone into coming up with a solution around this. Because every single

120
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:50,360
distribution is about to face this problem. So what if we came up with a way to solve

121
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:55,120
this? Maybe it's just the Steam runtime gets more libraries. Or maybe we double down on

122
00:09:55,120 --> 00:10:00,640
a Flatpak or Snap solution. But what if, as a community, we took this opportunity to come

123
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:06,480
up with a cross-distribution solution to this problem? Solace has tried it. There's a Flatpak

124
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:10,880
that tries this. There's a Snap that tries to solve this problem. Everybody has a solution

125
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:15,600
to this. What if, just for a moment, we took all of this upset and outrage at Canonical

126
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:19,900
and we said, you know what? They're trying to solve a problem we all face. How can we

127
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:26,800
solve this? That would be such an appropriate focus and use of everyone's energy. Instead,

128
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:31,480
we get silly things like change.org partitions, and we get silly outrage on Twitter, and we

129
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:36,580
get silly hot takes here and there. People don't even give it three days to settle and

130
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:37,580
marinate.

131
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:41,720
Well, they have to get their outrage out in time to build another video editor, right?

132
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:45,000
Yeah, let's launch a crowd funder too, Jim.

133
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:50,080
A petition to make another great video editor for Linux. That's what we need.

134
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:53,960
That'll solve it. Well, in the meantime, the rest of the press is all writing about these

135
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:58,400
outrageous security vulnerabilities that affect both Linux and FreeBSD.

136
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:02,940
Yeah, this is something called SAC Panic, which has been dubbed the new ping of death.

137
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:10,080
What's really happening here is the way the OS handles these SACs. A SAC is a TCP Selective

138
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:14,520
Acknowledgement, and there's various different ways the kernel can respond to these. And

139
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:21,080
in this particular and the other vulnerability that's happening here, CVE-2019-11478, the

140
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:25,600
operating system does not handle that kind of traffic very well, both in the case of

141
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:30,440
FreeBSD and Linux. And what essentially happens is the operating system becomes completely

142
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:35,640
consumed handling these types of TCP packets and can't respond to other services like,

143
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:37,920
you know, a web request.

144
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:40,200
And this is not exactly a new issue, is it?

145
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:44,840
No, that might even be the part that really kind of makes this a story. This flaw goes

146
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:52,880
as far back, at least as far as Linux is concerned, it goes back to kernel 2.6.29. So that's a

147
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:54,160
lot of kernels, Joe.

148
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:59,440
Yeah, and never before has Alan Jude's advice of patch your system, I think that's what

149
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:00,440
he's saying.

150
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:01,440
Your stuff, your stuff.

151
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:06,800
Oh, your stuff. That's it, yeah. Never before has that advice been so relevant. The patches

152
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:11,240
are there, but you have to apply them. And if you're not using a live kernel patch, then

153
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:17,880
it means a reboot. But I think some of these kernel flaws, you know, take it or leave it,

154
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:24,280
it's not really that important to reboot immediately. But with this one, I was just on it, rebooting

155
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:25,280
everything immediately.

156
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:30,380
Yeah, yeah. I mean, in total, we're really talking three different flaws that could be

157
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:35,680
found in the Linux kernel's handling of TCP networking. That, to me, definitely registers

158
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:40,280
as a worth it. And the most severe vulnerability could allow a remote attacker to trigger a

159
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:45,280
kernel panic, and nobody wants their system to go down. So it's worth updating on this

160
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:46,280
one.

161
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:50,920
Well, this was the week that Slack did a very successful IPO. But I noticed that Mattermost,

162
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:57,000
which is the kind of open source alternative to Slack, raised quite a lot of VC funding.

163
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:03,060
This is the story that did not get very much reporting in the wake of Slack's big IPO,

164
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:09,880
but Mattermost raised $50 million. And that's not all, really. This is their latest round

165
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:15,680
of funding. It brings their total raised money to $70 million to build a Slack competitor.

166
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:19,720
Now, I've been aware of Mattermost for quite a long time, but I'd never actually tried

167
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:25,840
it out. But this inspired me to spin it up on a digital ocean droplet. And I must say,

168
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:32,160
I was very impressed with it. It seems very much like Slack, but missing a few of the

169
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:36,920
features. But I suppose you could say it's focused on the features that you need rather

170
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:42,880
than some of the bloat that Slack might have. And I could seriously see myself and a team

171
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:49,400
using it, self-hosted, open source. I mean, there are obviously the enterprise versions

172
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:53,840
that have some added features, mostly around compliance and stuff. But I could definitely

173
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:57,800
see running this self-hosted version, certainly with a smallish team.

174
00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:01,840
Yeah, you and me and a few others gave it a go this weekend for this story so that we

175
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:07,260
could have some experience with Mattermost. And I think we all walked away fairly impressed.

176
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:11,040
If you're a Slack free user today, I really don't think there's any reason you couldn't

177
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:15,000
switch over to Mattermost immediately. Now, if you're not familiar, it's a startup that

178
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:21,520
characterizes itself as an open source messaging alternative to not just Slack, but also Microsoft

179
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:27,280
Teams or Atlassian HipChat, those kinds of enterprise chat softwares. And along with

180
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:31,640
the announcement of the money, there's also some changes in the Mattermost board. Most

181
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:36,960
significantly, the Twitter COO will join the Mattermost board as a director.

182
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:40,180
And there's also some good news that comes along with the fundraising. The project has

183
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:47,120
grown to 10,000 independent downloads a month and 1,000 unique contributors to the project.

184
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:51,960
Much of that in translation, admittedly. But it's kind of nice to see the project grow.

185
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:56,920
We tried it out and we both walked away with, huh, you know what? Better than I expected.

186
00:14:56,920 --> 00:15:01,120
I thought you'd have to like set up a matrix system and get a riot IM on top of that and

187
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:05,080
really build something out to get something competitive with Slack. But with Mattermost,

188
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:08,760
you stand it up in a few minutes, I assume, and you're good to go. I'm kind of curious,

189
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:12,640
Joe, how long did it take you to get a Mattermost instance running?

190
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:16,560
Well, the documentation was really good. And yeah, it only took a few minutes to get the

191
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:23,520
initial system up. And then only a few more minutes really to get the NGINX proxy going.

192
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:29,320
And I got my let's encrypt sorted out. And so yeah, total, probably less than an hour

193
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:34,720
of working on it. But now I've done it once, I think I could spin it up on another instance

194
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:35,920
much more quickly.

195
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:40,560
Well, their CEO says that this is going to accelerate their growth and their community.

196
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:48,440
They plan to go from 65 employees to 110 employees by 2020. They're going to like go at Slack

197
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:53,800
like full on, full force now. And having seen it, I've not only tried it out with your instance,

198
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:59,280
but also the Pop OS community is using Mattermost. I honestly think it's better than Slack free.

199
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:04,560
And if we were starting today, I would just use this. And if I was an open source project,

200
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:10,040
creating a distribution or a project that was being consumed by open source enthusiasts,

201
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:15,160
the Mattermost just be 100% the way I go. I mean, IRC rooms are great. Absolutely. I'd

202
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:19,760
probably have one of those too. But I wouldn't do a forum anymore. I wouldn't do a free Slack,

203
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:25,000
I would just stand up a Mattermost instance. And I think it would be really successful.

204
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:31,640
They also have apps for Windows, Linux, the Mac, Android, iOS, as well as a web application.

205
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:37,560
Yeah, I tried out the Android app. And it was pretty much on a par with Slack. The only

206
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:41,960
issue I had was that the notifications don't actually tell you what the message is. It

207
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:45,760
just tells you that, you know, Chris has sent a message or whatever. So then you have to

208
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:46,760
open the app.

209
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:47,760
That's how I like it.

210
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:48,760
Like a bit of mystery.

211
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:53,440
Yeah, read my message. It's a mystery. Yeah, I tried out the Linux desktop app. It's you

212
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:58,640
know, it's a it's a wrapper around the web application. But you get, you know, system

213
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:02,400
trays, and you get notifications, and you can have multiple instances. So it's it's

214
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:07,800
not bad. But it's a web app. It's a web app in a desktop application. But you know, they're

215
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:12,000
making a Linux version available. And it does integrate. So I can't complain.

216
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:16,200
Yeah, it's definitely one to watch. But it seems that something that we won't be watching

217
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:18,380
is any more Google tablets.

218
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:23,280
As a longtime Android on tablets enthusiast, which I thought it did better at I got the

219
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:28,580
Samsung tab, I obviously got the Nexus seven, I thought it was great. I'm a little sad to

220
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:33,160
see this news. But if Google's going to focus on a singular OS, especially one around the

221
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:39,520
laptop form factor, Chrome OS is definitely the OS to just focus on I, I really, really

222
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:44,620
wanted a pixel slate, but the reviews were so bad. It seems so so early, it seemed like

223
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:52,220
a product that lacked focus from its developers from from the makers. I hate to see this at

224
00:17:52,220 --> 00:17:56,360
the same time, they need to pick a horse and they just need to try to win a race. The iPad

225
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:58,720
Pro is so far ahead right now.

226
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:04,040
Well, that's the elephant in the room here, isn't it that the iPad Pro is very expensive,

227
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:10,400
but it is the class leader in that space. You could argue that maybe the surface devices

228
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:15,720
that Microsoft have got are competing there. That's kind of mostly an enterprise and stuff.

229
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:16,720
But

230
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:20,780
I kind of disagree there, Joe, with this change, I feel like Google is going more head to head

231
00:18:20,780 --> 00:18:21,780
with the surface.

232
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:27,880
Well, yeah, I suppose. And they're basically just leaving that tablet market to Apple now,

233
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:34,560
and just accepting defeat there, really. Because initially, they dropped Android on their own

234
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:38,680
tablets and tried to go for Chrome OS, but it just it doesn't make sense on that form

235
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:43,920
factor. Whereas the pixel book form factor, which is essentially a convertible laptop

236
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:48,760
that you can fold all the way around into a tablet, kind of splits the difference gives

237
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:56,440
you the best of both worlds. But without the keyboard attachment, that pixel slate just

238
00:18:56,440 --> 00:19:01,920
didn't make any sense at all. And because that keyboard wasn't really good enough. That's

239
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:08,160
probably why it didn't take off. So I'm not hugely surprised by this, really. But it's

240
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:13,920
just a bit sad that there will be OEMs like Samsung and stuff making tablets still.

241
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:17,520
Yeah, they'll keep going. They could go with the open source version of Android.

242
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:22,080
Well, yeah. And you know, Android, you can just run kind of phone Android on a slightly

243
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:27,360
bigger screen. But it just doesn't have that traction, the app ecosystem that Apple has.

244
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:31,440
That's the thing you need those applications, you got to have the app developers on board.

245
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:36,760
Yeah. Well, unless like me, I recently bought a Galaxy Tab S2, I think it's called and put

246
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:42,580
lineage on it. And that's the only a small, I think, an eight inch, four by three aspect

247
00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:45,840
ratio one. And that I use for reading news and stuff.

248
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:50,720
It's a great size. I love the seven inch that my Nexus seven is my favorite tablet. I have

249
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:56,200
an iPad Pro now. It's a great, it's a great tablet. It's so fast. But my favorite tablet

250
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:58,360
was the Nexus seven, I could put it in my coat pocket.

251
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:05,000
Yeah, I can do that somewhat with this Galaxy Tab S2. But really, I just have it set up

252
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:09,840
very much like my phone. It's just a bigger, easier to read phone, really. I think when

253
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:15,240
you get into the 10 inch plus, that's when you really need to have a UI that's based

254
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:20,240
around it. And that's why we're going to see iPad OS shortly, which is really just iOS

255
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:25,320
with a few extra features. And you need to have the apps that can take advantage of that

256
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:31,520
bigger form factor. And I think that Android is just lost in this space, unfortunately,

257
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:36,320
and Chrome OS never really got started. So yeah, it's kind of sad.

258
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:41,640
I kind of agree. I think at least immediately, that's true. Long term, Google is making a

259
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:49,440
lot of wins with the Google Apps integration with companies. And I think that sells Chromebooks

260
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:53,360
right there. I think they have a good long term strategy. And if they can get behind

261
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:58,200
one product like this, which has often been a criticism of Google, they could be really

262
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:02,360
successful. I'd love to see them bring something that's Linux based as a competition to the

263
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:06,880
iPad because right now, I'm using the iPad Pro because it's the best product. But if

264
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:14,280
I could buy a Google Linux based device that would be better, hmm, I may consider it then

265
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:19,280
it would really come down to the privacy stuff. You know, that little detail that nobody has

266
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:24,600
to worry about with Libra coin, that rumor we talked about last week, Joe, turns out

267
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:25,600
it's a real thing.

268
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:29,560
Yeah, it turns out those rumors were completely true. And it was officially announced this

269
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:33,960
week. And we've got a link in the show notes to a Verge article that then has a bunch of

270
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:39,920
links to way more articles if you really want to get in depth with this. But I think because

271
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:44,080
those rumors were pretty much spot on, we didn't learn a huge amount.

272
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:48,840
Yeah, I agree. What we kind of learned, if anything was the rollout plan. At launch,

273
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:53,960
you'll be able to send Libra inside of Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp, surprise, surprise.

274
00:21:53,960 --> 00:22:00,360
And then, for the most part, it'll be initially used as a way to take Facebook money and convert

275
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:05,440
it to real money. But eventually, like the long term plan that Facebook has, is they

276
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:10,320
hope that Libra will be accepted as a form of payment, and maybe other financial services

277
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:18,080
that they can build on top of some sort of service. They have, quote, plans long term

278
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:24,080
port to transform the global economy, end quote.

279
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:31,280
Well, global is the key issue here. This is not aimed at us in Europe and America. This

280
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:36,920
is aimed at developing nations where people are using these phone based payment systems,

281
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:39,240
and it's really looking to compete with those.

282
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:43,680
I agree. I completely agree. That's where the story is really going to get interesting

283
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:49,860
long term. Anyone who has followed the cryptocurrencies and blockchain for a while now has been just

284
00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:54,480
kind of sitting back and waiting for some large corporation to take advantage of what

285
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:59,440
is essentially a gift of the riches. If you can really pull this off, you make your own

286
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:05,760
currency and you make it math based and you follow the right kind of protocols and procedures,

287
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:11,920
you can have a hit. And I think any of us cryptocurrency enthusiasts, yay Bitcoin, have

288
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:16,680
been just kind of waiting. Who's going to figure this out? I thought it would be Microsoft,

289
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:17,680
but apparently it's Facebook.

290
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:22,560
Yeah, so it would seem. And our speculation last week about the price of Bitcoin going

291
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:29,200
up seems to have been correct because it has. It's been somewhat volatile, shall we say,

292
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:32,280
but it has gone up. Good news.

293
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:36,800
It wouldn't be a Bitcoin story without a little bit of volatility in there, would it?

294
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:41,600
Even though this Libra is, people are saying, it's not even a proper cryptocurrency. It's

295
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:47,800
basically just a fiat currency. And there's been a lot of naysayers, but I think that

296
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:51,480
it potentially has some legs. I don't know. I still don't know where I stand, whether

297
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:56,960
it's the death battle of a dying company, very slowly dying company, or whether it's

298
00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:02,360
going to really take off and make them a bunch of money in developing nations. I think really

299
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:05,240
we have to wait until it's launched next year.

300
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:11,580
Absolutely. I'm sitting here with a huge smile on my face right now because I love all of

301
00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:17,720
the parallels to free software and open source that are happening in the financial sector.

302
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:25,320
It's amazing. It feels like it's 1979 for the financial institutions right now. And

303
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:31,760
they are about to witness a reckoning when an open source way of doing currency comes.

304
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:38,220
And it's math backed at that. I really enjoy this. And there's so many parallels for somebody

305
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:42,080
who has been watching the free software and open source communities for years when it

306
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:48,280
comes to cryptocurrency. And it is one of the grandest experiments that's going to happen

307
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:54,360
on the human stage when it comes to software and everyday life. I can't wait to see where

308
00:24:54,360 --> 00:25:00,280
this goes because we have a very special position in history to watch this thing unfold.

309
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:03,040
Who's going to be the richest storm in a bit though? That's the big question.

310
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:10,560
Hey, at the end of the day, Joe, we're all Satoshi Nokamoto. Well, wherever it goes,

They have lots of open positions right now, from training architects across the board

316
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:38,080
to general engineering, like development on Ruby on Rails, QA engineering, Node.js and

317
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:43,720
Angular development. All of it is open right now. They're growing and they want people

318

320
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:55,120
We'll be back next Monday with our weekly take on the latest Linux and open source news.

321
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:57,120
I am at Chris LAS.

322
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:58,780
I'm at Joe Rissington.

323
