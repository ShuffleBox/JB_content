00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,400
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, our weekly take on Linux and the open source world.

2
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:21,120
This is episode 28, recorded on November 19th, 2017.

3
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:22,120
I'm Chris.

4
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:23,120
And I'm Joe.

5
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:25,880
Hello, Joe, and happy Fedora 27 release week to you.

6
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:29,760
Yeah, this is the second Fedora release that's happened during the run of this show.

7
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:32,400
So that means we must have been doing it for a while.

8
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:34,400
But yeah, Fedora 27.

9
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:36,560
There's not a massive amount to say, is there?

10
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:39,120
They've revved a lot of the packages.

11
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:44,280
But otherwise, there's nothing hugely new and outstanding about it, is there?

12
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:47,120
This is a nice and steady improvement over 26 to 27.

13
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:52,760
You get GNOME 3.2.6, which brings in fractional high DPI scaling and the new fancy settings

14
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:55,100
panel with lots of improvements.

15
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:58,360
And you also get trim support for encrypted disks under Fedora.

16
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:03,040
So nice workstation features, but maybe some of the more notable changes are on the server

17
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:04,040
side.

18
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:05,560
Yeah, it's all about modularity now.

19
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:08,360
I know they've been working on modularity for a couple of releases.

20
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:13,440
And I'm a big fan of this because it allows users to have a more modular operating system,

21
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:17,380
which would include managing multiple components that maybe are on different life cycles.

22
00:01:17,380 --> 00:01:22,720
So different versions of NGINX or the database server than what is perhaps packaged upstream

23
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:24,180
in the repository.

24
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:26,920
There's going to be a lot of additional work that goes into this.

25
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:30,380
And Fedora 27 modular server beta is available now.

26
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:32,120
And you updated your droplet, didn't you?

27
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:35,720
Yeah, I have a droplet that I update using DNF every single time.

28
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:39,460
I wait because the Fedora project always releases a guide, and I just want to make sure I do

29
00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:40,820
exactly right.

30
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:43,440
And I think I'm three or four releases in now.

31
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:44,440
It's pretty impressive.

32
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:45,440
Yeah, well, that's the thing.

33
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:49,080
If you're going to have a fairly short support window and release every six months, you need

34
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:51,520
to make it solid each time.

35
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:54,080
And Fedora has done that again.

36
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:55,080
It's a solid release.

37
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:57,560
It's not massively exciting, but to me, that's good.

38
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:58,560
It shouldn't be exciting.

39
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:02,440
It shouldn't be something that is causing you stress.

40
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:08,160
It's new kernel, it's new packages, it's new version of GNOME on the desktop, or new versions

41
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:10,480
of whatever packages you need on the server.

42
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:11,480
And it just works.

43
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:15,840
I think it's also worth pointing out that there's a new release of the Fedora media

44
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:16,840
writer.

45
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:21,280
And this thing's kind of cool, because it's a great way to convert non Linux users to

46
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,280
Fedora.

47
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:27,080
It also, in this latest version, allows you to create bootable SD cards with Fedora for

48
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:29,680
ARM devices, like the Raspberry Pi.

49
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:34,120
And there's a Mac version where it'll download the ISO automatically and write it to a USB

50
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:36,520
stick under Mac OS.

51
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:38,240
Makes it easy to switch a Mac user.

52
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:42,360
Yeah, but then would you really want to switch a Mac user to Fedora?

53
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:48,400
Isn't Fedora kind of more aimed at people who are familiar with Linux and developers,

54
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,400
that kind of thing?

55
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,400
I don't know, Joe.

56
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,400
I don't know.

57
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:55,600
It's a really great, steady, upstream development work environment.

58
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:59,040
It could be a pretty good way to reuse older MacBook hardware.

59
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:02,920
I'm not saying go out and buy a touchbook and throw Fedora on there.

60
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:06,360
But I'm saying you've got a 2013, 2015 MacBook Pro.

61
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:09,960
You might at least want to try loading Fedora on there and see if you get new life out of

62
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:10,960
the product.

63
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:11,960
Well, you could do a lot worse.

64
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:15,720
Well, in the category of doing a lot better, Firefox 57 is out.

65
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:19,160
And it's a quantum leap in performance, eh, Joe?

66
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:23,080
Ha ha ha, yes, the new version 57 Quantum.

67
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:27,320
Now I've been trying it out a little bit, but my wife has been trying it out more.

68
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:30,360
And the first thing she said to me was, oh, they've made Firefox all different.

69
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:32,560
Oh, I don't like this.

70
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:36,440
But then she kind of tweaked it a little bit and got it looking a little bit better than

71
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:38,320
it was out of the box.

72
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:40,440
And I'm fairly happy with it.

73
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:42,000
She's fairly happy with it.

74
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,840
I just don't think that I would go so far as to say it is five times better than it

75
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:51,120
was, five times faster than it was six months ago.

76
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,120
It's certainly different.

77
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:56,120
It's certainly a bit faster, but I just think that they're trying to hype this up a little

78
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:57,360
bit more than it deserves.

79
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:00,340
Well, surprise, surprise, Joe, I'm going to disagree.

80
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:05,320
I think at least as far as Firefox updates go, this is pretty much the biggest one since

81
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:08,080
version one back in 2004.

82
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,880
You've got the new UI, love it or hate it.

83
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:12,520
I happen to think it's pretty good.

84
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:18,320
You've got Google now as the default search provider in the US and in Canada.

85
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:24,000
And they're shipping the new Stylo CSS engine, which takes advantage of multi-core hardware.

86
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,160
So all of these things combined do seem to make a pretty substantial competitive release.

87
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:33,600
I feel like performance wise, it may be outclassing Chrome now.

88
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:38,000
It's not necessarily using less memory than it was in the past, but it feels like it's

89
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,560
doing more with that memory.

90
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:41,520
Well, yes, it is improved.

91
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,560
There's no doubt about that.

92
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:45,040
There've been significant improvements.

93
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:48,360
And once you know about the technicalities of it, you can see how much effort's been

94
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:50,040
put into it.

95
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:56,640
However, Google services, now this is not Mozilla's fault, but try and interact with

96
00:04:56,640 --> 00:05:01,080
Google maps, for example, in Firefox, and it's still a disaster.

97
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:04,680
It's a little bit better than it was, but it used to just crash all the time.

98
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:09,800
And so your only option was to use Chrome basically, if you wanted to use Google maps,

99
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:13,920
especially if you're doing more than just looking up one thing quickly.

100
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:18,200
And now it's a little bit better, but I asked my wife, she uses Google maps all the time.

101
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:24,440
I asked her to use Firefox for all the stuff she does maps with.

102
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:26,960
And then a day later, she's using Chrome again.

103
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:27,960
I said, what happened?

104
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:32,240
Well, it was a bit better, but it's still rubbish compared to Chrome.

105
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:34,120
And to me, that is the shadow.

106
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:36,920
Chrome is the shadow that looms over this whole thing.

107
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:37,920
I do agree.

108
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:43,920
I've been back on Chrome for a few tasks myself, having tried out 57 since the hour it was

109
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:44,920
released.

110
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:46,200
And I really like it.

111
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:49,240
It's now my casual go-to personal browser.

112
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:53,840
Like my work browser is Chrome right now, and my personal daily driver is the new Firefox

113
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:55,640
because I think it is really great.

114
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:59,080
I particularly like how it performs under Linux.

115
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:01,200
And I don't know, I think they're really nailing it.

116
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:05,440
And I want to support Mozilla too, so I kind of want to at least be another user to stat

117
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:09,400
out there that is representing the Firefox flag.

118
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:10,540
But I agree.

119
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:11,540
It's not 100%.

120
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:13,760
They still have some progress to make.

121
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:16,360
And Google's not sitting still with Chrome.

122
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:17,360
Yeah.

123
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:18,360
But that's the thing.

124
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:21,760
I'm sitting here using Firefox because I care about software freedom.

125
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:25,640
And even though I know that Chrome is essentially better than Firefox, I'm still using Firefox

126
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:27,560
because that's how much I care about it.

127
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:32,320
But if you look at all the changes that Firefox has made or Mozilla have made with Firefox

128
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:37,560
over the last few years, it is trying to catch up with Chrome, putting the tabs on top like

129
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:42,600
with Chrome and changing the UI generally to basically resemble Chrome.

130
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:45,880
And they are chasing Chrome.

131
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:50,960
And I don't know whether I agree with that strategy because, okay, Chrome has taken over

132
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,680
in terms of market share.

133
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:58,200
But should they be trying to ape them and copy them or should Mozilla be trying to forge

134
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:59,200
their own path?

135
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:05,160
I suppose they tried that with the privacy stuff and the we're not a huge corporation

136
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:07,480
and we're not tracking you and all that stuff.

137
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:09,380
And people kind of laughed at them.

138
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:13,120
So they basically can't win at this point, can they?

139
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:18,400
Well, I guess my closing thoughts on this would be there is some legitimate concern

140
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:19,620
to what you're saying.

141
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:24,500
If they spend too much time and effort chasing Chrome, then they may not do enough of their

142
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:26,220
own innovation.

143
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:30,020
Looking back over the past several releases of Firefox, they've been making steady progress

144
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:33,060
towards a pretty big technical goal.

145
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:37,040
And you've been able to watch the technologies they've chosen to build these new tools and

146
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:40,240
these new engines, and they're the best stuff out there.

147
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:44,960
And the processes that they've taken seem to be the best processes to build this stuff.

148
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:48,500
And the way they're rolling it out seems to be a very safe, sane way to roll it out.

149
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:53,400
And now that we've arrived here at 57 with all of these things coming together, I would

150
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:58,380
argue that they may have a more technical superior implementation than Chrome does.

151
00:07:58,380 --> 00:08:01,540
And speaking to the UI, while they have some elements that seem like they are pulled from

152
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:05,820
Chrome, I'm pretty sure that the Mozilla project did a lot of studying on the UI.

153
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:07,940
They write about that a little bit in their blog post.

154
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:11,900
And they put some real human testing into this thing to make sure it was sort of the

155
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:13,240
best of both worlds.

156
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:18,220
So on both points, I see where you're coming from, but I think once we've arrived here,

157
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:21,420
they've handled it really well and they've come out with a product that's superior in

158
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:22,420
a lot of ways.

159
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:24,340
Do you think they can use the rest of the web to catch up?

160
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:25,420
Well, maybe.

161
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:30,580
And the bottom line is that I am still using it because it is a truly free software browser.

162
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:32,740
And that, to me, is the most important thing.

163
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:37,180
So as long as they keep improving, then I'm definitely sticking with it.

164
00:08:37,180 --> 00:08:40,620
But if you don't like these huge changes, there is an option for you.

165
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:46,560
Pale Moon is a fork of Firefox that strips out some of the bloat and stuff.

166
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:52,540
And they have been working on a new Brazilisk, I think is the way you pronounce it, browser

167
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:57,620
technology that is still using the old Zool plugins and things.

168
00:08:57,620 --> 00:09:01,980
So if you really don't like change, then do check out Pale Moon and there's a link in

169
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:02,980
the show notes.

170
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:06,380
Go to linuxactionnews.com slash 28 and you can follow that.

171
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:11,300
And if you're fed up with the changes, then you can go back to how it used to be.

172
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:15,240
In the theme of keeping things the way they are and getting off my lawn, good news for

173
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:16,820
me this week.

174
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:22,860
There is some serious discussion of an Ubuntu Unity remix that's taking place on the Ubuntu

175
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:24,240
community hub right now.

176
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:30,620
I always say to people, if there's one thing I love more than XFCE, that is choice.

177
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:33,200
And I've never liked Unity.

178
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,700
There's no point pretending otherwise.

179
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:35,700
I never liked it.

180
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:38,900
But I know there are a ton of people out there who love it.

181
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:41,700
They used it as their daily driver for years.

182
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:47,060
And now they're having to change to this Gnome thing, which, OK, it's a very good implementation

183
00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:48,060
of it.

184
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:50,380
But some people just want to stay on Unity.

185
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:52,760
And isn't this the brilliant thing about Linux?

186
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:55,740
We're going to have, by the looks of things, this Unity flavor.

187
00:09:55,740 --> 00:10:01,640
And I know you've switched over to Unity recently, so you must be very excited about it.

188
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:02,780
I am very pleased to see this.

189
00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:06,760
I feel like it means I've made a good bet for at least the next couple of years.

190
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:11,260
We'll see where things land after Wayland and all of those transitions are complete.

191
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:17,340
But right now, this is promising, because it appears Canonical has given initial blessings

192
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:19,300
on using the Ubuntu trademark.

193
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:22,760
So that's one major step cleared right there.

194
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:27,040
And if you look at the discussions taking place, it looks like there's also some pretty

195
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:33,920
serious discussion on getting the Ubuntu Mate applications integrated with this Unity remix.

196
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:38,420
So instead of shipping Gnome 3 apps with the large client-side decorations that look a

197
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:44,460
bit funky in Unity and have removed some functionality, they would go with the Mate applications,

198
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:49,180
which just need a few different modifications that are pretty easy to make.

199
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:50,860
Of course, what do I know?

200
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:54,640
But they seem, on the surface, having looked at the discussion, pretty straightforward.

201
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:57,540
And now, all of a sudden, they'd be pretty well integrated with Unity.

202
00:10:57,540 --> 00:11:01,340
And then that would mean, of course, a wider adoption of these Mate applications, which

203
00:11:01,340 --> 00:11:05,720
means more bug submissions, more users, more code gets developed.

204
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:09,140
So it's better for Ubuntu Mate, it's better for the Unity remix as well.

205
00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:15,660
All this has been going down on the Ubuntu community hub, and one name popped up, Martin

206
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:16,660
Wimpress.

207
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:18,500
And he is helping out with this.

208
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:20,500
And that should tell you enough.

209
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:22,980
He is the leader of Ubuntu Mate.

210
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:27,740
And now that he's involved in helping them out, I think that really bodes well for it

211
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:29,540
as a project, doesn't it?

212
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:33,540
Having just the help of Wimpy, his experience working on Ubuntu Mate, and perhaps being

213
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:36,980
able to connect them with the right people could be extremely valuable.

214
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:42,220
I think looking at this, it makes more sense than it might initially seem on the surface.

215
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:45,260
16.04 is going to be around for years.

216
00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:51,060
And as part of their commitment to 16.04, Canonica will be maintaining Unity, even after

217
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:52,820
18.04 is released.

218
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:55,980
And it will be shipping in the 18.04 repositories.

219
00:11:55,980 --> 00:12:00,700
So there will still be maintenance happening to Compiz and to Unity, even though they've

220
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:04,740
switched to Gnome, because it's shipping in these LTS distributions.

221
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:09,700
So this is the perfect opportunity for a community to come along and take this code, which is

222
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:14,120
in maintenance mode but not yet abandoned, and start contributing real value to it, adding

223
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:18,620
these Mate applications, which are continuing to see new feature enhancements and continued

224
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:20,060
code improvement.

225
00:12:20,060 --> 00:12:23,540
And you end up with something that could be a very popular Ubuntu remix.

226
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:28,500
Yeah, and potentially, although it's early days, but potentially an official flavor.

227
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:33,060
I would love to see it be an official flavor and get all the support that that entails.

228
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:38,300
Because as I said, there are thousands, hundreds of thousands, maybe millions of people who

229
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:43,740
are used to using Unity, who would love to have an officially supported flavor of Ubuntu

230
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:45,700
that lets them just keep doing what they were doing.

231
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:50,780
Because it was basically feature complete, okay, it could do with some high DPI improvements,

232
00:12:50,780 --> 00:12:54,660
maybe a little bit, and the Wayland stuff, of course.

233
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:58,940
But if there's people working on it, then why not let it live alongside Chrome?

234
00:12:58,940 --> 00:13:04,300
Yeah, and I also think there's a place for Unity with an updated theme.

235
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:09,920
And it just maintains working on X for years, because there's, I think, a multi year transition

236
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:11,460
coming to Wayland.

237
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:16,020
And there will be some people on enterprise grade workstations and production grade workstations

238
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:18,560
that opt to run X for a little bit longer.

239
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:21,100
And why not have a first class desktop experience on that?

240
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:22,100
Yeah, totally.

241
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:27,780
And it's funny, you mentioned the Marte applications, it looks like Zubuntu is going to be using

242
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:29,580
the Marte applications as well.

243
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:32,460
I think that is also an extremely good development.

244
00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:36,460
Because now you've got these three distributions that are all sharing a common base, and they're

245
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:40,540
all sharing a common set of applications, they all have about the same goals in mind

246
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:43,180
about a traditional desktop paradigm.

247
00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:47,180
And three distributions using the same set of applications, at least three, it's gonna

248
00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:50,380
be more than that, is going to be great for the end users.

249
00:13:50,380 --> 00:13:54,380
I don't know about Unity having a traditional paradigm, I mean, I suppose it's traditional

250
00:13:54,380 --> 00:13:56,260
by now, but it's kind of the alternative.

251
00:13:56,260 --> 00:14:00,260
Well, it's funny, like, because I didn't think that about the music I listened to in high

252
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:03,700
school, and I turned on an oldies radio station, and they're playing the oldies, and it was

253
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:05,220
high school hits, Joe.

254
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:08,820
Eventually, even the new stuff turns into the old stuff.

255
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:13,060
Yeah, that's true.

256
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:17,020
Get yourself some new service over at Ting, go to last.ting.com.

257
00:14:17,020 --> 00:14:18,300
It's a smarter way to do mobile.

258
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:22,460
The average Ting bill is just $23 per month.

259
00:14:22,460 --> 00:14:26,340
It's really something compared to the traditional phone plans here in the States.

260
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:30,060
You just pay for what you use, your minutes, your messages, and your megabytes.

261
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:35,340
The line is $6 a month, plus Uncle Sam's cut, nationwide coverage here in the States, no

262
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:40,020
contract nor the termination fee, they have GSM and CDMA networks.

263
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:46,140
I brought a test CDMA phone ages ago, an old clunker, got it on the Ting network, and was

264
00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:51,940
immediately impressed that the $25 credit covered more than my first month, and it's

265
00:14:51,940 --> 00:14:55,360
been a Ting relationship ever since.

266
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:59,300
Get started by going to last.ting.com, and I'm going to point you to their blog this

267
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:00,300
week.

268
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:05,460
If you're trying to educate friends, family, extended loved ones, whoever it might be about

269
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:10,180
the woes of fishing, they have a great write-up that you can find on their blog and share

270
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:13,540
with those that are concerned, and help them understand the problem of fishing.

271
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:18,700
I know we don't need the blog, but we all know somebody that does.

272
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:20,340
Start by going to last.ting.com.

273
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:31,140
Okay, well, just a quick mention of the 4.14 release of the kernel, which there's a lot

274
00:15:31,140 --> 00:15:35,320
of technical stuff going on in here, but I don't want to get too bogged down in that.

275
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:38,780
To me, what's really interesting here is this is the kernel that's going to be around for

276
00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:43,100
six years because it's the LTS, the new six-year LTS.

277
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:48,420
It's going to be potentially in mobile devices, embedded devices, IoT.

278
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:51,460
This is a kernel that we're going to see for a long time, I think.

279
00:15:51,460 --> 00:15:55,740
Yeah, that is the big news about this release, is this is the one that we'll be sticking

280
00:15:55,740 --> 00:15:56,740
around.

281
00:15:56,740 --> 00:16:01,980
This is the one that will eventually ship on Project Treble devices for Android, I believe.

282
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:07,220
But it also means now that 4.14 is out, the real fun can begin with 4.15, which may see

283
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:09,620
entirely new architecture support added.

284
00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:10,620
Yeah, RISC-V.

285
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:17,460
They're totally open architecture, which I've been following for at least a couple of years

286
00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:21,580
now, and we're starting to see development boards coming out, and it would be absolutely

287
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:24,540
amazing to see mainline support for it.

288
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:29,220
Yeah, I don't know what use cases these chips are going to fill yet, but I know that there's

289
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:34,460
already an industry ready to go because there has been a steady march towards this code

290
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:35,460
in the Linux kernel.

291
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:39,220
Now, this is just really the beginning phase of it, too, because they're still building

292
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:41,260
all of the hardware around these chips.

293
00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:46,140
That means they still need to write device drivers, but the initial architecture is landing

294
00:16:46,140 --> 00:16:47,140
in 4.15.

295
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:52,000
Yeah, and if you look at the Linux kernel mailing list, Torvalds himself hasn't said

296
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:57,020
anything terribly bad about it, so that's a pretty good sign.

297
00:16:57,020 --> 00:17:02,500
There's a few issues that they need to iron out to get this support into 4.15, but I think

298
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:06,820
it's looking good, fingers crossed, and then there's no looking back from there.

299
00:17:06,820 --> 00:17:11,220
Something Linus did talk about was this zero-day bot that's been getting even better, as he

300
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:13,500
puts it, and making it more and more useful.

301
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:17,460
I did a little digging before the show, and it looks like an Intel project that's this

302
00:17:17,460 --> 00:17:23,420
multi-headed bot that scans all the different branches of development of the Linux kernel,

303
00:17:23,420 --> 00:17:28,700
finds problems, and then when it does, it emails the mailing list, and when it doesn't

304
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:33,000
find a problem, it then moves it along the testing stage to actually execute it and build

305
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,600
on physical hardware, and then generates a whole other series of reports, and is doing

306
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:38,140
this over and over again.

307
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:41,860
I'm going to try to dig into it more, try to get links to the code, because I think

308
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:47,020
the bot and all that stuff is open source, and I'll try to do a little mini-report in

309
00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:48,580
this week's Linux Unplugged.

310
00:17:48,580 --> 00:17:52,360
Well, ARM devices are definitely going to benefit from this long-term support kernel

311
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:57,900
for six years, and ARM is something that Red Hat is seriously thinking about these days.

312
00:17:57,900 --> 00:18:01,640
This is Red Hat's first commercial support for ARM architecture.

313
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:05,180
It's Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.4.

314
00:18:05,180 --> 00:18:11,160
Now they've been testing this for years, I think since like 2015 with a development preview,

315
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:15,240
but now they're pretty much ready to say, okay, we're going to ship it, and we're going

316
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:16,980
to support it for years.

317
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:22,860
Hello world, and meet Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.4 for ARM devices, and the timing of this

318
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:27,700
is pretty good, because there's recently been several large announcements, big announcements

319
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:33,380
by Cray and Qualcomm for big server-grade systems with lots of ARM cores on there.

320
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:35,320
We've been talking about it for years, haven't we?

321
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:40,740
This idea of the data center moving to ARM, and now it seems to finally be happening.

322
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:45,880
Everyone knows ARM chips have the advantage of lower power consumption and less heat output,

323
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:49,720
but the other advantage is you can slice and dice how these cores are assigned, and you

324
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:55,820
can purpose build applications for these cores, and you can stack a lot more of these ARM

325
00:18:55,820 --> 00:18:58,740
servers in a rack than you can x86 servers.

326
00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:03,820
It almost feels like this is inevitable, and Red Hat's trying to get there and offer an

327
00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:08,620
enterprise-grade product before it's too late in some cases, because there's other distributions

328
00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:12,740
that don't quite have that commercial enterprise prestige, but they've been there now for a

329
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:13,740
while.

330
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:15,460
Well, yeah, look at Canonical and Ubuntu.

331
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:20,100
That's been available for ARM for a long time, so the question is why has Red Hat taken so

332
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:21,100
long about this?

333
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:22,380
I guess they took their time.

334
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:27,060
They've been testing it since 2015, but the enterprise space isn't necessarily known for

335
00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:28,460
moving too fast.

336
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:33,380
Yeah, I suppose a company the size of Canonical can kind of afford to be more agile and move

337
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:38,060
more quickly, whereas Red Hat has to bide its time.

338
00:19:38,060 --> 00:19:43,380
I think it was a little bit overdue, but now they're seriously moving into this space.

339
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:49,280
You know they would have tested it properly, and it feels like now is about the right time

340
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:53,940
because we didn't really have the hardware for the data center before now, and now it's

341
00:19:53,940 --> 00:20:00,140
starting to appear with the Qualcomm staff, so they're probably spot on with their strategy.

342
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:03,720
There's a reason they are the biggest Linux company, to be fair.

343
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:07,780
On the total opposite end of the enterprise market, you have OnePlus.

344
00:20:07,780 --> 00:20:12,660
They move quick, and sometimes things slip through the cracks, and they're back in the

345
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:16,860
news again with a pretty major backdoor.

346
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:22,700
Yeah, Engineer Mode, which is an APK that they left on some builds of their operating

347
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:29,460
system for their various devices that essentially allows root access over ADB.

348
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:34,580
Now, it's not quite the big story that some people made it out to be because they were

349
00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:36,740
assuming that there'd be remote access here.

350
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:41,460
No, the reality is that you need to have enabled USB debugging, and you need to have physical

351
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:46,260
access to the device, which as we know, if you've got physical access to any computing

352
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:48,540
device, all bets are off.

353
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:51,820
But either way, this doesn't look good for them.

354
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:55,920
This comes on the back of a couple of months ago, some metrics they were collecting that

355
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:59,520
people weren't happy about.

356
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:06,540
This is supposed to be a brand aimed at developer types, tinkerers, people who like custom ROMs,

357
00:21:06,540 --> 00:21:14,000
people who want low price hardware with good specs, geeky people, essentially.

358
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:19,300
Not your Samsung users, the typical normals.

359
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:21,800
They need to be careful with this stuff, really.

360
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:25,340
Even if this turns out to be just incompetence, which to be honest, I think it is, I don't

361
00:21:25,340 --> 00:21:26,780
think there was any malice intended here.

362
00:21:26,780 --> 00:21:32,620
I think it was just debugging software that they forgot to remove.

363
00:21:32,620 --> 00:21:38,780
It's just not a good look for a brand which is associated with, well, people like us who

364
00:21:38,780 --> 00:21:40,700
like custom ROMs and stuff.

365
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:45,220
There's three elements to this story that I find intriguing.

366
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:50,680
Element number one is this is a diagnostic and testing application made by Qualcomm.

367
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:55,060
It's not made by OnePlus, it's made by Qualcomm, and it's something they build for OEMs to

368
00:21:55,060 --> 00:21:59,940
easily test all hardware components of the device, and they just left it on the image

369
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:03,700
of the OnePlus 3, OnePlus 3T, and the OnePlus 5.

370
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:05,580
So that's element number one.

371
00:22:05,580 --> 00:22:12,460
Element number two, this quote unquote backdoor was discovered by a Twitter user who goes

372
00:22:12,460 --> 00:22:18,460
by the name Elliot Anderson, which those of you who are Mr. Robot fans may recognize that

373
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:19,460
name.

374
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:23,900
Element number three, this Elliot Anderson on Twitter discovered that there was a password

375
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:29,100
needed by engineer mode in order to escalate the ADB privileges.

376
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:33,220
And mind you, this is a password set by Qualcomm employees.

377
00:22:33,220 --> 00:22:36,180
And this is a Twitter account named Elliot Anderson.

378
00:22:36,180 --> 00:22:37,420
And the password?

379
00:22:37,420 --> 00:22:43,260
The password was Angela, which those of you that watch Mr. Robot will know that Angela

380
00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:45,980
is a relevant character in the Mr. Robot series.

381
00:22:45,980 --> 00:22:47,900
Yeah, Elliot's oldest friend.

382
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:53,220
Right, so Qualcomm happens to have some Mr. Robot fans, and then the Twitter user outing

383
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:57,380
this entire thing happens to have a Mr. Robot handle.

384
00:22:57,380 --> 00:23:02,100
It almost feels like an inside leak because there's no obvious source from where the password

385
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:03,100
came.

386
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:07,680
The leaker hasn't given that information, doesn't disclose where the password came from,

387
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:09,840
just kind of figured it out and then tweeted it.

388
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:13,140
But the curious thing is that Qualcomm denies any involvement.

389
00:23:13,140 --> 00:23:18,100
They say that it's based on some code they wrote, but it is so different at this point

390
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:21,440
that they basically didn't write it.

391
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:24,720
So the mystery gets even deeper.

392
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:30,380
And then it gets even weirder that there's some other binaries on there that are basically

393
00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:35,320
collecting Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connection information and logging that.

394
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:40,800
But functionally, this just turns out to be a big bonus for owners of these OnePlus phones,

395
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:46,340
because it's almost impossible to execute this thing remotely.

396
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:50,500
And you have to implicitly turn on USB debugging on your phone.

397
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:57,540
So really, OnePlus 3, 3T, and 5 owners can now get root access without ever having to

398
00:23:57,540 --> 00:23:58,540
unlock their phone.

399
00:23:58,540 --> 00:24:01,060
They just got a simple way to root their devices.

400
00:24:01,060 --> 00:24:03,140
That's the functional aspect to the story.

401
00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:06,780
Yeah, without having to wipe all the data that goes along with unlocking the bootloader,

402
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:07,780
which is nice for some people.

403
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:10,900
I mean, it's the first thing I do, so it doesn't really bother me.

404
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:16,980
And as a OnePlus 3T owner, I'm not affected by any of this, because I'm running lineage.

405
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:20,860
But yeah, there's a kind of silver lining to all of this, isn't there?

406
00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:21,860
Yeah, I think so.

407
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:24,980
If I was an owner of one of these devices, I'd jump on this right now before they pushed

408
00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:27,620
out an update to remove this thing.

409
00:24:27,620 --> 00:24:28,620
Yeah.

410
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:33,660
But it just kind of goes to show how shady the whole OEM version of Android thing is.

411
00:24:33,660 --> 00:24:35,740
They all have their own stuff baked into it.

412
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:37,860
And you just got no idea what's going on.

413
00:24:37,860 --> 00:24:40,580
And I honestly don't think there's any malice here.

414
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:42,380
I think it's just incompetence.

415
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:45,540
I think they've just left stuff on there that they shouldn't have done.

416
00:24:45,540 --> 00:24:48,560
And people are just not doing their jobs properly.

417
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:49,780
And same with the logging stuff.

418
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:54,420
I don't really think they've got a massive interest in collecting user data.

419
00:24:54,420 --> 00:24:56,100
It's just sloppy development.

420
00:24:56,100 --> 00:25:01,700
And it just goes to show, man, if you run in proprietary software or software with huge

421
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:05,220
proprietary elements to it, you just can't trust what's going on with it.

422
00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:09,020
So just lineage all the way for me, thank you very much.

423
00:25:09,020 --> 00:25:10,660
Sloppy and incompetent.

424
00:25:10,660 --> 00:25:14,980
Just the aspects you want from your phone vendor that really inspires confidence.

425
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:17,340
But I suppose you only learn by doing.

426
00:25:17,340 --> 00:25:21,860
The OnePlus 5T, I think was just announced, I had to be honest, yo, it looks like a pretty

427
00:25:21,860 --> 00:25:23,140
good phone.

428
00:25:23,140 --> 00:25:27,620
But it does give me a little bit of pause because this is the second story in less than

429
00:25:27,620 --> 00:25:29,460
a month for them.

430
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:30,460
Yeah.

431
00:25:30,460 --> 00:25:34,100
It's funny, you're the second iPhone user that has said to me they're tempted by the

432
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:38,420
5T with its six inch display and it's all looking pretty good.

433
00:25:38,420 --> 00:25:44,860
But I'm a couple of versions behind now and I'm happy enough with the 3T.

434
00:25:44,860 --> 00:25:47,860
If I was going to suggest a phone to anyone, it'd be that 3T.

435
00:25:47,860 --> 00:25:48,860
It's a great phone.

436
00:25:48,860 --> 00:25:53,100
It's got the fingerprint reader and everything, first class lineage support.

437
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:56,100
You don't really need this new phone as far as I'm concerned.

438
00:25:56,100 --> 00:25:59,600
But if I had all the money in the world, I'd seriously consider it.

439
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:02,700
It's nice to see something taking on that Nexus line.

440
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:08,420
When the Pixel came out and the Nexus line ended, the Pixel was considerably more expensive

441
00:26:08,420 --> 00:26:10,940
and it makes me less inclined to want to tinker with it.

442
00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:14,980
It makes it less of a community supported phone because they're so expensive.

443
00:26:14,980 --> 00:26:18,020
And the OnePlus phones have really kind of stepped up to that role.

444
00:26:18,020 --> 00:26:22,340
So I hope they sort all this out because I think long term, they'd probably be the Android

445
00:26:22,340 --> 00:26:23,540
phone of choice for myself.

446
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:26,660
