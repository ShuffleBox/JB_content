00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,920
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, episode 131, recorded on November 10, 2019. I'm Joe.

2
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:10,920
And I'm Wes.

3
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:14,480
Hello, Wes. Thank you very much for stepping in while the boss is away.

4
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:15,480
Thanks for having me.

5
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:19,720
Google have been up to quite a lot this week. So let's start with them giving quite a few

6
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:22,560
Chromebooks a fair bit of extra support.

7
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:26,780
It's definitely good news, but a bit of a mixed bag. Depending on what particular model

8
00:00:26,780 --> 00:00:32,160
you happen to have, most models received another year of support, but others got only another

9
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:35,560
six months, and some lucky ones received two more years.

10
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:41,800
There were some models that had already been abandoned, which have been resurrected. Unfortunately,

11
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:47,960
not my C720, which remains abandoned, and so will live on with gallium OS.

12
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:53,320
Right, that kind of highlights why this matters, Joe. Chromebooks, unlike perhaps other devices

13
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:59,580
that you may be familiar with, have a strange fixed lifecycle, right? I mean, Google, after

14
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:04,400
they've certified a new platform for Chromebooks, they set an end date, and that's when your

15
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:06,120
security updates are no more.

16
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:11,160
Well, it's a little bit like smartphone style updates that you get that fixed window that

17
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:16,600
is generally much shorter than, say, a Windows or Mac device. And I think that's the crux

18
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:20,680
of this here. They're really looking to push further into the enterprise and education

19
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:24,000
markets, and those markets won't stomach these short support cycles.

20
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,320
Right, you've got to include whatever refresh rate they've got internally for the hardware,

21
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:31,800
otherwise they probably won't choose your platform.

22
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:34,880
And you would imagine that's the kind of feedback their sales reps would have been getting,

23
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:36,720
and so this is the result of that.

24
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:40,580
Probably matters, too, if you've bought one of the more high-end Chromebooks. I mean,

25
00:01:40,580 --> 00:01:45,920
Chrome OS has gained a lot of features. It's now very usable as a sort of high-end workstation.

26
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:51,700
And while you might be okay with your budget model expiring after four years, I'd like

27
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:53,720
longer life and a significant investment.

28
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:57,600
Yeah, they have been adding a lot of features, and this week they announced a couple more.

29
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:02,640
The big one for me is virtual desktops that they're calling virtual desks, something we've

30
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:07,080
had for a long time in Linux, but something that Chrome OS has really lacked.

31
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:11,480
Yeah, Linux has had this feature for quite a long time, but we've seen most other major

32
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:16,360
operating systems playing catch-up, so it's nice to see Chrome OS join the club. All you

33
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:20,640
have to do is open the overview and tap New Desk in the top right-hand corner, so it's

34
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:26,460
a fairly accessible feature, and it works just as you might expect. I'm also very pleased

35
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:31,160
to see they've added some keyboard shortcuts if you're not a big fan of the mouse.

36
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:34,700
They've also added a bit of a convergence feature where you can now make phone calls

37
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:40,000
on your Android phone originating with phone numbers on the Chrome OS device.

38
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:45,840
Makes me think of some of the slick integrations on that other platform we won't name.

39
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:50,600
Yeah, they've also added some improvements to printing. Now, I've never tried to do that

40
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:54,380
on a Chromebook before, but I've heard that it wasn't the easiest.

41
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:59,080
As someone who tries to avoid printing whenever possible, anything that makes it easier is

42
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:03,960
very much welcome. They say that compatible printers will just automatically show up,

43
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:08,800
no setup needed, although I'm not quite sure where that list of compatible printers is.

44
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:13,080
Yeah, they call it print without hassle. That just doesn't exist in my mind.

45
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:14,080
No.

46
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:19,080
Yeah, I'll believe it when I see it. But on the mobile side of things, Google have seemingly

47
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:23,760
put their hands up to the fact that Android has a bit of a malware problem.

48
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:29,200
Yeah, this week they've announced a partnership with three antivirus firms, ESET, Lookout

49
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:33,560
and Zimperium, to create what they're calling the App Defense Alliance.

50
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:38,640
Now, they already have a thing called Play Protect, which is something of a black box

51
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:42,600
to me. I don't know exactly how it works. I don't think anyone does, really, apart from

52
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:43,600
Google.

53
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:45,720
You just got to wave your hands and say, machine learning.

54
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:51,440
Yeah, machine learning. But that is obviously not enough because I keep reading almost on

55
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:58,400
a weekly basis about an app that was downloaded 25,000 times, 100,000 times, that was some

56
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:05,160
sort of malware. And so these three companies all have competing products for Android security.

57
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:09,440
And all three of them have a different approach. And so it's kind of typical Google, isn't

58
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:15,240
it? Instead of just having one solution, let's have three competing solutions and somehow

59
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:16,840
that will work well.

60
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:21,040
That does sound like Google, although some diversity can go a long way. You're right,

61
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:25,960
all of these companies already do this sort of scanning. But before this agreement, they

62
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:29,800
were doing it after the fact, right? They were trying to identify malware out in the

63
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:34,960
wild. With this partnership, before apps actually get to the Play Store, they'll have to go

64
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:38,080
through all four different protection engines.

65
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:43,720
So in theory, this will stop the malware before even gets into the Play Store. But it's funny

66
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:49,320
that the VP of Android security and privacy, Dave Kleidermacher, said, when you're at the

67
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:54,680
massive scale we have in these platforms, when you can even get 1% incremental improvement,

68
00:04:54,680 --> 00:05:01,160
it matters. So they're not necessarily looking to catch all the malware, but even a 1% improvement

69
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:02,640
would be massive for them.

70
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:07,200
With 2.5 billion Android devices out there, they do have a point.

71
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:11,680
Yeah, and Tony Anscombe from ESET said that they're likely to be scanning many thousands

72
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:18,360
of apps per day. So it really does go to show the scale of the whole Android ecosystem.

73
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:23,320
Yeah, there's a lot of investment here. And they started working on this two years ago.

74
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:27,000
We don't know anything about the finances of this. Presumably, the companies are making

75
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:31,080
a fair bit, but they're also getting access to a lot of data, which is always valuable.

76
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:35,160
Right, the more apps they scan, the better they can improve their own databases, which

77
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:40,240
makes their products better too. And hopefully, makes the Play Store a bit better at the same

78
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,240
time.

79
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:46,960
Hopefully, but realistically, this is an arms race. And okay, this is really stepping up

80
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:53,800
Google side of the arms race, but people will always find new ways to sneak crafty malware

81
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:54,800
into the Play Store.

82
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:59,720
Yeah, there's no getting around that. Even if it is a semi curated environment, think

83
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:02,560
twice before installing just any app.

84
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:08,920
Yeah, good advice. And think twice before getting into VR, I would say, as we had a

85
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:15,000
bit more evidence this week that VR is not really panning out to be the success a lot

86
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,400
of people hoped it would be.

87
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:23,560
Oh, Joe, you must be talking about the open sourcing of Google's cardboard VR headset,

88
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:27,400
which I'll note comes just a month after they dropped Daydream.

89
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:32,920
Yeah, Daydream was they're quite fancy VR headset, which is not supported by the new

90
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:39,840
Pixel 4 phones. And now they're open sourcing cardboard, the libraries and SDK for that.

91
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:44,520
And it feels to me that although they say they're going to continue to contribute to

92
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:50,120
it, or they may continue to contribute to it, realistically, this is one of those cases

93
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:57,440
where things are sort of put out to pasture by being open sourced. And realistically,

94
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:02,160
I can't see many people wanting to necessarily work on it, because it's almost an admission

95
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,600
that it's just a dead platform at this stage.

96
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:09,320
That's one way to look at it. Certainly. I am pleased that at least some remnants will

97
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:14,000
remain even if they never invest again, right? We've got the bones of the project here open

98
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,040
source, and perhaps some artists or enthusiasts, people just looking to play around can make

99
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:23,240
use of that. And I think having it open source is just better than having it die closed.

100
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:26,440
Oh, definitely. Yeah, I wish more people would do that.

101
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:31,520
You are right. It seems like maybe it was time for cardboard to die. You know, it was

102
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:37,200
launched five years ago. And while VR has certainly not taken off, as many may have

103
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:42,720
thought it might, cardboard was very early in this whole timeline and presented a device

104
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:48,600
that you could play around with, try to get an idea at the base stages of what might work

105
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:55,560
in the VR world. These days, the price has come down on much better VR tech. And I think

106
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:59,200
there's just less reason for cardboard to exist.

107
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:07,200
Yeah, but that said, we still don't have a truly wireless and truly portable VR solution.

108
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:12,040
Whereas we all have these phones in our pockets with relatively high resolution displays that

109
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:18,560
are totally wireless and can just slide into this cheap, like $20 or less cardboard headset.

110
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:23,960
And you can have very, very cheap VR, it might not be the best. But I've played with it and

111
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:29,560
it was pretty fun. It's a novelty. It's not something I'm going to do all the time. But

112
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:36,080
I think there is still a huge gap between cardboard and even the cheapest proper VR

113
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,080
solutions.

114
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:42,160
Yeah, you're right. It had a unique place in the market. And I played with it a bit

115
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:48,320
too. I've even got one of those plastic headset models you can find on eBay or Amazon. And

116
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:54,340
it's not amazing. But it was fun to play with. I hope we'll see more releases from Google.

117
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:59,880
They mentioned perhaps a Unity SDK package in the future. And really, the only thing

118
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:03,840
that will continue to make cardboard relevant is the community wanting to use it.

119
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:08,160
Yeah, well, we can hope and like you said, it's much better that they abandon it by open

120
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:13,640
sourcing it than not. And with the Apache 2 license that it's under, it could potentially

121
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:17,960
live on as some commercial products, although they are going to be quite restrictive about

122
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:23,520
the Google Cardboard trademark. You have to be a bit careful that you can use the term

123
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:28,880
Google Cardboard, but not implying that it's official. But I think that's fairly standard

124
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:30,440
for this sort of thing.

125
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:35,600
Well, something that hasn't been abandoned is Ubuntu 14.04. It ran out of support in

126
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:41,600
April, but thanks to Canonical's ESM program, which is extended security maintenance, you

127
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:49,320
can get support for it up to 2022. Up to now, you've had to pay for that. But this week,

128
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:53,800
Canonical announced that you can now get free access to that for up to three machines.

129
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:58,760
Or up to 50 machines if you're an official Ubuntu member. With that, you're going to

130
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:04,460
get fixes for high and critical severity CVEs for the most commonly used server packages.

131
00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:08,500
And you'll have access to Canonical's live patch technology, which permits users to apply

132
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:10,520
critical kernel patches without rebooting.

133
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:16,140
And they've got a new client for this, which is just called UA for Ubuntu Advantage. And

134
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:19,000
so I tried this out, I installed 14.04.

135
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,120
Something tells me you already had an installation lying around, Joe.

136
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:25,760
I haven't actually, I recently updated one to 16.04. But I'm not telling you where that

137
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:35,040
is. But I installed a fresh 14.04.6 and fully updated it, rebooted, checked for updates

138
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:39,960
again, it said there weren't any, but if you're part of this Ubuntu Advantage, you can get

139
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:46,660
them. And so I signed up for that and put in my key, which was really easy. And then

140
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:50,240
suddenly I had a bunch more updates, and I was completely up to date.

141
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:53,440
It does seem like they put in a lot of work to make this fairly seamless.

142
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:58,760
Yeah, definitely. It was really, really easy to do it. The only thing is, I wasn't sure

143
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:05,040
how I could get rid of that machine, how I could kind of uncouple it from my account.

144
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:11,320
Because having kind of deleted that VM, does that mean that it's there forever, and I've

145
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:15,460
kind of wasted one of my lives, as it were? I don't know, the documentation wasn't that

146
00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:16,460
clear on that.

147
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:21,700
Yeah, this is an area of Ubuntu I'm not too familiar with, because unless you need these

148
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:25,920
updates or already have a support relationship with Canonical, you just didn't have access

149
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:26,920
to it before.

150
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:30,320
Yeah, we generally talk about the kind of new and shiny stuff. But I think the reality

151
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:36,160
is that there is a lot of infrastructure out there that is running on old versions of Ubuntu

152
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:41,920
and old versions of various other distros as well. And it's this extra long term support

153
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:47,760
that makes you a proper enterprise company. And that's why Canonical started offering

154
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:55,080
the paid tiers for this, I think is part of their plan to IPO. And I think that what we've

155
00:11:55,080 --> 00:12:01,000
got here is them giving people a free taste of it to kind of hook them in and realize,

156
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:07,080
actually, this is good that we can rely on Ubuntu being updated for a seriously long

157
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:15,620
time. It's not clear whether 16.04 and 18.04 are going to get this free ESM arrangement.

158
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:17,400
So we'll have to wait and see on that one.

159
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:22,880
Nevertheless, it does seem like a goodwill and good PR move. I imagine from the perspective

160
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:29,160
of a small business or perhaps a nonprofit who still got a 14.04 machine running somewhere,

161
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:32,040
depending on it, this makes you pretty happy.

162
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:37,120
Well, there have been some significant changes since 14.04 came out. That was still using

163
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:39,360
upstart, no system D back then.

164
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:44,800
It really is a new era. And even with this support, I think these organizations will

165
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:47,600
still have to confront an update sometime.

166
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:52,680
Well 2022. So you know, a couple of years to get yourself sorted and get on to 16.04

167
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:55,240
and then face the same problem in another couple of years.

168
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:57,120
Yeah, there's no escaping updates.

169
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:01,680
Well, from the old to the very new, something that created a lot of buzz this week, something

170
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:08,720
that's really cool, Splitter. This is from the French music streaming service Deezer.

171
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:14,120
And it takes a music track and separates it into its constituent parts, for the most part,

172
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:15,320
actually very well.

173
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:20,380
Yeah, sounds like we both had a chance to give it a shot. It's really easy to get running.

174
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:25,960
It's a Python application using TensorFlow. And then they have access to some private

175
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:31,180
data sets that they've used to train all these models. So the tool basically downloads the

176
00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:36,040
model and runs it against whatever input file you've got, which could be a wave or a flack

177
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:37,040
or MP3.

178
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:40,800
Yeah, they've got access to tons of data for this because well, they're a music streaming

179
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:46,340
service. And that made me wonder, does this only work with commercial music that they

180
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:53,160
had trained the engine on? And the reality is no, I tried some of my own tracks and some

181
00:13:53,160 --> 00:14:00,640
more obscure stuff. And it really does work. I mean, the asterisk here is it's not studio

182
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:05,880
quality drums, studio quality guitar, studio quality vocals. But I think it's good enough

183
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:07,520
to do a remix or something.

184
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:12,280
Right. It seemed particularly effective at pulling the drum lines out. And while the

185
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:17,400
vocals were at times a bit eerie, which makes sense considering how well optimized our own

186
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:23,740
brains are at detecting human vocals, as a tool to pull the vocals out of a file, some

187
00:14:23,740 --> 00:14:26,040
things I tried worked surprisingly well.

188
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:32,440
Well, I'm not sure about it being really easy to get going. It took me probably about 10

189
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:38,400
or 15 minutes of messing around to get conda to work something that I'd not used before.

190
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:42,280
It's not just a case of calling the git repository and run a binary or anything.

191
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:46,480
I will note and maybe this would have helped you there are Docker images available both

192
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:52,200
for the CPU optimized version and the GPU optimized version, which is even faster.

193
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:56,680
Of course, that's the route you went down. You're all over Docker. So yeah, okay, that

194
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:59,680
makes sense. Yeah, that would be very easy. But I wanted to do it the other way. For some

195
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:05,200
reason. I'm just awkward. You mentioned the GPU there. With the right graphics card and

196
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:11,400
the right drivers, you can get it to go 100 times as fast as on the CPU. And the CPU was

197
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:17,000
for me on a fairly old laptop, about real time ish.

198
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:23,040
Yeah, and even on the CPU, it really wasn't that slow. I ended up spending a couple hours

199
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:27,400
and throwing 20 or so tracks at it. And I had a great time. So even if you're not going

200
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:33,720
to use it to remix or as a sample somewhere, it's just a neat application of technology.

201
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:38,240
And somewhat unique in this space. And being open source, there's a lot of commercial tools

202
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:44,120
that can do some of these same things, but you don't often get access to how it works.

203
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:49,240
Now I mostly tried it with the splitting into five different stems, but you can just separate

204
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:55,560
the backing track and the vocals. Or you can do a four stem version. But I would highly

205
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:59,800
recommend the five stem because that gives you a piano, which more often than not is

206
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:06,400
not a piano. It's just really cool, really eerie sounds that have come from all sorts

207
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:09,280
of sources within the track.

208
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:13,280
One angle on this tool I hadn't considered before is somewhat interesting just to try

209
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:19,160
to analyze how these pieces are put together and what the model thinks they should be.

210
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:23,960
Well, yeah, as someone who at least used to mix quite a lot of music tracks, this could

211
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:28,560
be really handy to assess your mix and see how you've done it. It's not necessarily going

212
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:34,760
to dictate the decisions that you make, but it is a good extra data point with regards

213
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:38,540
how you've separated the various frequencies within your mix.

214
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:43,760
Now while most of us don't have access to the private data sets, Deezer does. They include

215
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:48,920
all the technology in the open source release to go train this model on your own data. And

216
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:51,120
I wonder if we'll see any interesting results there too.

217
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:55,320
Yeah, I suspect that this is only going to get better as more people train it and contribute

218
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:59,640
to the open source project. And it is great to see that we do have an open source implementation

219
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:03,960
of this rather than it all being locked away. So yeah, I think this is definitely one to

220
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:09,300
watch. Much like our last story is definitely one to watch. And that is that Microsoft's

221
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:14,020
Edge browser is going to be released for Linux. It's official. I know I'm looking forward

222
00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:15,240
to it, Wes, are you?

223
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:19,980
Well, I'm looking forward to giving it a try. Anyway, I don't think it's going to replace

224
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:26,380
my main browser. But it seems like Microsoft is genuinely interested in making this a good

225
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:27,880
experience for all platforms.

226
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:31,440
Yeah, and this was announced in your neck of the woods, wasn't it at their Ignite conference

227
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:32,440
in Seattle?

228
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:37,920
Yeah, although unfortunately, I wasn't there to catch it in person. There is a video available

229
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:44,120
if you're curious. It's also not as surprising as it may seem because the new Microsoft Edge

230
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:46,720
is powered by chromium under the hood.

231
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:51,840
Yeah, it's using the blink engine. So it's not a huge stretch to get it onto Linux you

232
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:58,040
wouldn't have thought. But in that video, they announced it and kind of were expecting

233
00:17:58,040 --> 00:18:04,500
a reaction that they didn't quite get, which is quite funny. But, you know, I could see

234
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:09,800
this being relatively successful. And a lot of people would scoff at that. And just the

235
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:14,660
idea of edge coming to Linux seems to be funny to most people. But when you really think

236
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:21,360
about it, yes, we've got Firefox and Chromium. But sometimes you need to use Chrome for things.

237
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:27,400
Source Connect, which we sometimes use, for example. Now, if that worked in edge, it would

238
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:33,840
make me stop and think, whose proprietary browser would I prefer to use? Evil Company

239
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:41,840
A, Google, or Evil Company B, Microsoft? Honestly, I don't know. There's not much in it really.

240
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:47,360
Yeah, you know, at that level, it's probably worth just giving it a shot. I was able to

241
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:53,760
test it out under wine, which worked surprisingly well. And I mean, it was a it was a fine browsing

242
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:58,720
experience. In particular, I noticed they had really easy access to get a voice narration

243
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:01,520
of the page. And it was surprisingly decent.

244
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:06,500
All right, that's a nice accessibility feature. How did it compare to Chrome then?

245
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:13,040
It felt like a slightly lighter, more optimized version of Chrome with a little bit of the

246
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:15,480
Microsoft Windows aesthetic put on top.

247
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:19,880
Now I am curious. I will have to try this once it comes out. We don't really have any

248
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:25,360
further details on when that's going to be. But yeah, I'll give it a go. It'd be interesting

249
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:29,680
if you could try Source Connect in there and some other web apps that seemingly require

250
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:34,120
Chrome and see if Microsoft have managed to crack that aspect of it.

251
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:40,560
Now you're thinking it's also already available to try on Mac or Windows or iOS or Android

252
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:43,280
basically everywhere but Linux.

253
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:47,800
But realistically, I'm staring at these show notes in Firefox and I think I will be for

254
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:49,640
quite some time to come.

255
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:50,640
Same here.

256
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:54,040
Well, we'll follow the progress of Edge on Linux along with all the other stories in
