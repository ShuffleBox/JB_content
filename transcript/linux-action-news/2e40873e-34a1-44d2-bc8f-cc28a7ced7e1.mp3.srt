00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,020
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, our weekly take on Linux and the open source world.

2
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:20,080
This is episode 18, recorded on September 10th, 2017.

3
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:21,080
I'm Chris.

4
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:22,080
And I'm Joe.

5
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:23,080
Hello, Joe.

6
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:24,360
It's good to be with you again.

7
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:28,000
And I have one question for you at the top of our show, Joe.

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,340
Are you a wearables guy?

9
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:30,340
I am.

10
00:00:30,340 --> 00:00:32,340
I've got a Sony SmartWatch 3.

11
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:33,340
And I love it.

12
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:36,760
I've also got a Pebble that someone donated to me once, which I loved.

13
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:41,480
But then after the developments with Pebble getting bought by Fitbit, I thought, maybe

14
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:44,280
it's time to get an Android watch.

15
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:46,440
And I wear it all the time.

16
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:51,360
Generally only when I'm going out, because it's good for being polite in conversations.

17
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:54,640
A quick glance at the wrist is better than getting your phone out of your pocket, I find.

18
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:55,640
That is true.

19
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:57,760
I've over the years become more of a wearable person.

20
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:02,040
I started skeptical, also started with the Pebble myself, and just have tipped my toe

21
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:04,960
in over and over again just to see where things are at.

22
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:06,580
So the Connect watch got my attention.

23
00:01:06,580 --> 00:01:09,300
It's a smart watch with Asteroid OS.

24
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:11,160
And it's launched a crowdfunding campaign.

25
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:12,160
Yeah.

26
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:16,000
So Asteroid OS is something that was kind of part of the reason for buying the Sony

27
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,520
SmartWatch 3, because one of the early Alphas was available for that watch.

28
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:23,320
And so I have actually had a chance to check it out.

29
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:25,600
And OK, Bluetooth wasn't working.

30
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:28,080
So I couldn't really check it out as a functional device.

31
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:30,680
But it was looking quite nice back then.

32
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:35,800
And to have it on hardware that it's specifically designed to go on looks good to me.

33
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:42,680
And the fact that this is an open source watch OS, much more open source than Android wear

34
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:44,560
is, it's great.

35
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:50,020
The only problem is the crowdfunder is in French and very French centric.

36
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:52,960
And the promotional materials are all in French.

37
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:56,040
And so I think it's going to have a limited audience, which is a real shame, because I'd

38
00:01:56,040 --> 00:02:00,720
love to see a proper open source OS dominate this area.

39
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:03,560
Is this the first time we've seen something like this since the Pebble?

40
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:07,320
But this is even more open source and more out there than the Pebble was.

41
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:10,680
And that to me is also noteworthy, because we've seen a lot of attempts at phones and

42
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:13,400
tablets and convergence type devices.

43
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:15,120
But this is a proper watch.

44
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,120
It's small.

45
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:17,200
It's reasonably well designed.

46
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:21,620
I would say it has more of a sports look than a classic sort of showy watch.

47
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:24,640
And it has hard painted seconds around the outside.

48
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:29,840
And it's a circular display, a 1.4 inch 400 by 400 AMOLED display.

49
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:35,280
It's got a MediaTek quad core processor, has support for Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, GPS.

50
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:39,160
And depending on the model you get, you can also put a micro SIM in this.

51
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:42,320
And it has a GSM card in there.

52
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:47,800
That's kind of a kiss of death for me, because that just puts it in line with all those cheap

53
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:52,360
Chinese watches that are standalone, running some sort of version of Android, usually really

54
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:53,360
old version.

55
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:56,600
And I had one of those to start with, and that was just terrible.

56
00:02:56,600 --> 00:03:00,160
But I suppose it can't hurt to have the cellular functionality to it.

57
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:05,680
But as long as it pairs properly to an Android phone or an iOS device, I think that's the

58
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,080
main thing.

59
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:13,120
And it's kind of the Wi-Fi and cellular just kind of nice add-ons, I suppose.

60
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:15,200
But you've got two different versions of it.

61
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:19,480
One with 512 megabytes of RAM and one with a gig of RAM.

62
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:22,780
And they are 4 gigs of storage or 8 gigs of storage.

63
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:26,880
And the price is quite a reasonable price they're asking for on here.

64
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:29,440
$120 gets you the cheaper one.

65
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:35,060
And the expected retail price is only going to be $180, so 150 euros, which is very cheap

66
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:36,060
for a wearable.

67
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:40,600
Although I suppose it's quite a modestly spec'd one, so it's probably a fair price for it.

68
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:44,720
I'm a big believer that health is a lot of the reasons these devices are being sold.

69
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:49,160
People want to track everything from steps to sleep as a way to sort of quantify their

70
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:54,920
own health and maybe start losing weight or just start to set personal goals.

71
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:57,880
And I wonder, is it going to be competitive in that way?

72
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:02,040
And I just mention it because at this price point, which is a very competitive price point,

73
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:06,360
but at this particular price point, there's a lot of fitness players that do that job

74
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:08,720
really well at that price point.

75
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,680
Well that's the thing with wearables.

76
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:14,240
The fitness trackers have done really well and everything else just hasn't.

77
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:18,600
And so I think it's quite a niche market here that they're going after.

78
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:25,040
And it's probably the market, people like me, open source people who are interested

79
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:28,720
in having their notifications on their wrist basically.

80
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:34,000
So as for mass market adoption, I can't see it unless it does the fitness stuff as well

81
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
really well.

82
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,640
But we've yet to see that because it's still quite an early stage.

83
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:41,400
I'm going to watch this crowd funder with a lot of interest.

84
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:44,440
Not going to bag it myself, obviously, but I'm going to watch it with a lot of interest

85
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:48,740
just to see where a device like this, a wearable running asteroid OS goes.

86
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:53,320
I'm sure loads of other people will watch it too.

87
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:55,760
Otherwise they're all going to be getting together in Poland, I suppose.

88
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:57,560
It's either that or the watch, right Joe?

89
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:58,560
Yeah.

90
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:03,840
So there's going to be a sailfish OS meetup in Krakow, Krakow, Poland.

91
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:06,080
You see how I made you say it.

92
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:10,400
I think in Poland it's called Krakow, but everyone else calls it Krakow.

93
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:11,520
Anyway that doesn't really matter.

94
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,860
So this shouldn't be news, right?

95
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:19,160
Except for the CEO of Jola is actually going to be there.

96
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:23,360
So it seems like if you're in Poland or can get to Poland pretty easily and you're interested

97
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:27,160
in Jola and sailfish, you should be going to this thing.

98
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:31,880
What would you ask him if you could go?

99
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:34,520
That's a very good question that I should have thought about.

100
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:36,160
Because I know I can't go, I haven't thought about it.

101
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:41,200
So I suppose I'd ask realistically, how is the business side of things doing?

102
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:43,200
Are you going to survive?

103
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:46,000
And I suppose he's giving me a stock answer, but if I got him drunk enough, maybe he'd

104
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,080
give me the truth.

105
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:50,240
I would try to come up with a tactful way to ask him, what are you doing with the money

106
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:54,080
you raise for the Sony Xperia X running sailfish?

107
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:56,760
Are you paying off backers with that?

108
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:57,840
Are you funding the business?

109
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:00,800
Can you tell me where that money exactly is going?

110
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:04,200
Yeah, that would be a good question to ask, definitely.

111
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:08,960
So if anyone does go to this and speaks to Sammy, then do let us know.

112
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:13,920
Because it sounds like a very good opportunity to give him a grilling and see exactly what's

113
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:15,920
going on with sailfish.

114
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:18,440
In the meantime, things are looking up for you lineage users.

115
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:24,620
Yeah, so we've reported on Project Treble before, which is basically a modular underlying

116
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:33,440
base for Android, which means that the device drivers and the proprietary blobs can sit

117
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:40,000
underneath as a separate layer to the kind of UI and all of the rest of the Android stuff.

118
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,480
And that was kind of uncertain for what it would mean for custom ROMs.

119
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:51,120
Well, there's a story here on xdadevelopers.com, which is looking very positive because it

120
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:57,700
might well be that if you have a Project Treble phone, then all of the difficult bit is taken

121
00:06:57,700 --> 00:07:03,760
care of by that, and then you can just swap out the Android bit for any custom ROM, any

122
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:10,240
AOSP, ROM or lineage or whatever, which means that it's potentially going to be really easy

123
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,280
to develop custom ROMs for these phones.

124
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:16,960
Yeah, Errol Wright over at xdadevelopers.com puts a fine point on it in his article.

125
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:23,080
He says, almost all the components inside the phone use an independent proprietary blob

126
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:29,080
and requires patches and workarounds independently on each part so that newer software can take

127
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:31,360
advantage of it, like the new version of Android.

128
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:36,320
This is a truly time-consuming task, and the main reason why most stable custom ROMs like

129
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:43,240
Lineage OS don't appear for two to three months after the final Android release drops to AOSP.

130
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:48,720
All this effort also means the resulted ROM will only work on one device, or in the best

131
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:54,400
case, a handful of identically or very similar devices, maybe with different names.

132
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:59,280
But now, because of the way Project Treble has modularized this layer of Android with

133
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:04,480
the device interactions and device drivers, all Treble devices on the market, once we

134
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:09,640
get to that point, will be able to boot a generic stock AOSP build of Android.

135
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:14,600
So this is going to take away most of the hassle of porting a custom ROM to an older

136
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:15,680
device.

137
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:19,040
If it can boot AOSP, it's going to be able to boot Lineage.

138
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,880
Yeah, which is great news.

139
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:25,360
But the kind of fly in the ointment you alluded to it there is that it needs to be a Project

140
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:29,160
Treble phone, of which there are only three or four at the moment.

141
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:33,640
And yes, Google is trying to push this standard, and I hope they can use their power with the

142
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:36,800
OEMs to make it mandatory.

143
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:42,880
But it means that all the old phones are still going to be as difficult to develop for, which

144
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:46,520
we've got custom ROMs for some of them at the moment, the OnePlus One and the Nexus

145
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:47,520
phones and stuff.

146
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:52,560
But it's going to be incredibly difficult to convert those old phones to Project Treble.

147
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:56,120
There's a kind of ray of hope at the end of the article, but I think that's wishful thinking

148
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:57,120
really.

149
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,720
I'd also add, it won't be flawless.

150
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:02,700
Even once AOSP just builds and boots on the device, there's still going to be tweaks to

151
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:05,600
some of the drivers for the camera and all these other things.

152
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:10,280
So it's not 100% solution, but it takes care of the most challenging part of the problem.

153
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:12,080
Yeah, well, here's hoping.

154
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:15,360
Mozilla's taking on a challenging problem, and that's comments online.

155
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:20,080
They think they've reinvented online comments, and they're targeting it directly at journalists.

156
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:26,080
They've got to spend those billions somehow, and this week it's online comments.

157
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:31,560
So they've got Talk, which is developed by The Coral Project, which is in association

158
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:38,360
with some other people like the Washington Post and the Sydney Morning Herald and The

159
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:39,360
Age.

160
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:42,840
So there's quite a few people teaming up here, and Mozilla's pumping a bit of money into

161
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:46,520
it, and it sounds quite good in theory.

162
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:52,520
It's a nice, small, lightweight comment system that seems quite full-featured, easy moderation,

163
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:58,400
that kind of thing, but people are just moving away from comments, and that's what it's trying

164
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:03,780
to address, fair enough, but websites are discouraging comments or turning them off

165
00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:07,480
left, right, and center and just driving people towards social media and just let Twitter

166
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:09,840
or Facebook or whatever handle it.

167
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:13,520
So I can see why they want to do this, they want to decentralize it, but there has to

168
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:18,040
be the will for people to decentralize it, and are you going to take back the burden

169
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:21,680
of running your own comments and moderating them and paying people to do that if you're

170
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:22,680
a big company?

171
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:26,080
I can't see it being hugely successful, unfortunately.

172
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:28,900
That might be why they're targeting journalism, particularly.

173
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:32,760
So you mentioned it earlier, Fairfax Media's websites in Australia, including the Sydney

174
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:37,320
Morning Herald and The Age are taking part of this, as well as the Washington Post, and

175
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:43,600
the idea is they work with Mozilla and the Project Coral Group, and they self-host, I

176
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:46,640
don't know if it's on-premises or not, an instance of Talk.

177
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:51,240
Now Talk says that they've been informed by a huge amount of research into online communities.

178
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:56,200
They commissioned academic studies and held workshops around the world to find out what

179
00:10:56,200 --> 00:11:00,760
works, and also pushed guides to help newsrooms change their strategies.

180
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:03,880
In other words, they marketed heavily by writing papers.

181
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:08,120
But they do have some key principles I like, you own the data, you being the outfit that

182
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:10,600
runs the Talk server, and it's 100% free.

183
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:12,240
It's public and available for anyone to run.

184
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:15,000
You don't have to be a newspaper that would want to use this.

185
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:19,840
They really position themselves, though, as improving journalism through engagement, and

186
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:24,340
they talk a lot about that, and they talk about digital journalism revolutionizing how

187
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:26,640
the news engages with its audience.

188
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:33,720
That's a lot of big hyperbole, but there is a little bit of sound business logic to Mozilla

189
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:36,640
being one of the brands behind a platform like this.

190
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:40,880
Assuming the journalism business has a need for a product like this, Mozilla's a pretty

191
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:46,440
trusted brand in this space, and I think this is actually a decent angle for them to look

192
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:47,440
into.

193
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:51,320
In terms of them hosting it, because you've got the option to self-host, but Mozilla could

194
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:53,880
have a supported hosted version that they charge you for.

195
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:54,880
I think it's more than that.

196
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:58,720
It's Mozilla being willing to be such a large contributor to the Coral Project, and it's

197
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:04,240
Mozilla willing to work with the Washington Post and help commission these studies.

198
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:07,880
I think they're building on top of a well-trusted online brand.

199
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:11,680
But how does it make them money?

200
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:12,680
Money Joe?

201
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:13,680
That's not...

202
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:14,680
Oh, geez, Joe.

203
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:15,680
How dare you?

204
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:16,680
It must be...

205
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:17,780
I would assume it must be through hosting.

206
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:22,760
It must be eventually there, or maybe the real money's in consulting, setting it up,

207
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:26,720
doing a study with the business, coming in, looking at how they engage with their audience

208
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:30,320
and comparing it to their academic studies and the papers they've published, and then

209
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:34,720
writing them a recommendation, and then, of course, supplying the IT workforce to implement

210
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:35,720
that recommendation.

211
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:37,240
It could be a very lucrative business.

212
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:38,960
Yeah, that actually makes sense.

213
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:40,040
You don't have to host it yourself.

214
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:43,120
You can go and set it up for them on their own servers, and yeah, that's actually quite

215
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,120
a good business model.

216
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:50,920
Yeah, maybe you should do that kind of thing, Chris.

217
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:55,200
Speaking of self-hosting, go to DigitalOcean.com, create an account, and use our promo code

218
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,200
Here's The Thing.

219
00:12:56,200 --> 00:13:00,000
Now, they have systems starting at just three cents an hour that I love and even lower,

220
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,000
and they go all the way up to these monster systems with 200 gigs of RAM, the latest Intel

221
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:09,200
Xeon processors, and every single system at DigitalOcean has SSD storage, and when you

222
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:14,000
need more, you can attach block storage up to 16 terabytes, and it shows up to Linux

223
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,640
as an actual block device.

224
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:19,480
It's really fun to play with for educational or to put it in production, and that's how

225
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:24,480
all DigitalOcean is, with built-in monitoring and alerting, performance metrics, and guides

226
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:25,480
for days.

227
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:29,680
Go to DigitalOcean.com, use the promo code Here's The Thing, and then go take advantage

228
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:32,240
of their documentation, but here's a little secret.

229
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:36,760
It's available to everyone, and Brian B. up there has a guide about object storage versus

230
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:37,820
block storage.

231
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:40,320
It really makes sense of all of it.

232
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:44,960
DigitalOcean.com, get a system spun up in less than 55 seconds with a super sweet, easy-to-use

233
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:47,960
dashboard and straightforward API.

234
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:52,320
With systems that start at just $5 a month, use our $10 promo code Here's The Thing, all

235
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:57,600
one word at DigitalOcean.com.

236
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:00,920
So recently, we were talking about blockchain technology and how it's a little bit more

237
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:06,560
than just Bitcoin, and one aspect of it is ICOs, initial coin offerings.

238
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:11,720
Well, bad news if you're in China, because they have been banned by the government.

239
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:15,520
Bad news if you're a Bitcoin investor, because the price has been all over the place.

240
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:21,520
It shot up to $5,000 a few days ago, and then rocketed back down to $4,200.

241
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:26,160
That's a lot of movement for one day, and it's coming from a financial regulator out

242
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:27,160
of China.

243
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:32,320
The regulator described initial coin offerings as a form of unapproved illegal public financing

244
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:35,520
that raises suspicions of fraud and criminal activity.

245
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:36,520
Yikes.

246
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:38,980
And this is not just China, is it?

247
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:42,200
It's looking like this is going to happen in the US and Europe as well.

248
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:45,780
Yeah, similar regulation could be coming to the US for sure.

249
00:14:45,780 --> 00:14:50,940
This July, the US Securities and Exchange Commission warned that ICOs were being used

250
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:57,040
to sidestep the law, and last week, the agency issued another statement describing coin offerings

251
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:59,160
as potential scams, quote unquote.

252
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:03,960
Yeah, and I've heard other people throw around Ponzi scheme as a term.

253
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:04,960
That sounds familiar to me.

254
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:09,560
Yeah, there's a real challenge though with these peer-to-peer decentralized blockchain-based

255
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:12,240
technologies.

256
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:15,280
Blocking them is sort of like blocking the internet or water.

257
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:16,840
Eventually, it finds a path.

258
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:21,400
Yeah, but what about this rumor that China's going to shut down the Bitcoin exchanges there?

259
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:25,560
I mean, that has been a big part of the devaluation of Bitcoin this week.

260
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:29,520
Yes, this has definitely played a role in that price going all over the place.

261
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:34,320
China is a huge part of Bitcoin right now, with lots of mining and exchange activity

262
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:35,580
over there.

263
00:15:35,580 --> 00:15:39,320
And it's possible this is coming from the Bitcoin exchanges themselves.

264
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:43,780
They're apparently getting some warning signs, and they're awaiting clarification that authorities

265
00:15:43,780 --> 00:15:49,520
may order them to shut down, which the news has just caused Bitcoin to go crazy.

266
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:54,680
And if that does happen, presumably the price will drop for a bit, but then exchanges will

267
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:59,260
spring up in probably other Asian countries, and then the price will go back up again.

268
00:15:59,260 --> 00:16:01,280
So that would be a good time to buy.

269
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:02,280
Indeed.

270
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:05,000
And assuming this doesn't impact mining, I think you're probably right.

271
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,960
There will be an initial sale on Bitcoin as everybody processes this news.

272
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:12,160
But assuming they don't shut down the mining, which is just running computers doing math,

273
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:15,800
I don't imagine they would, I don't think it's going to long term affect Bitcoin much.

274
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:20,520
Yeah, I mean, they might try and block ports and stuff, but these people are pretty technical.

275
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:26,040
The miners in China, I'm sure they will get around it with DNS hacks or whatever, proxies,

276
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:27,040
that kind of thing.

277
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:29,400
So I can't see them shutting down the mining.

278
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:35,440
But yeah, I think short term, it's not looking good for Bitcoin, but I cannot see it going

279
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:36,440
down long term.

280
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:39,040
It just seems to be going up and up and up, and maybe I'm wrong.

281
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:44,120
Maybe it is a bubble, but I kind of changed my opinion on it in the last year because

282
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:48,720
I just kept thinking that it was going to crash and burn and go back to one cent or

283
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:49,800
something.

284
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:54,960
And you know, people are be ordering two pizzas for whatever.

285
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:57,680
But it's just it's not it's not going to happen.

286
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:58,920
It just keeps growing.

287
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:01,880
The thing to keep in the back of your mind about Bitcoin, and it's not to say something

288
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:05,600
couldn't come along and replace it, but you have that limited amount.

289
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:06,960
That's also a factor.

290
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:09,640
So there is a finite amount of bitcoins that will ever be mined.

291
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:14,580
And we are racing towards that deadline right now, which puts an extra spin on all of this,

292
00:17:14,580 --> 00:17:18,560
on the value of the coin, on what people are going to do with the fundamental technologies

293
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:20,000
after that's happened.

294
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,080
It adds a whole other dimension to it.

295
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:25,960
And you know, it's almost like someone should start a show and they should just podcast

296
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:27,240
about Bitcoin all the time.

297
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:29,400
Yeah, maybe it could be your plan B.

298
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:30,400
Maybe, maybe.

299
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:34,520
You know, speaking of those miners in China, I bet storage is a big issue for them.

300
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:39,600
So they're probably rushing to install the new ButterFS driver for Windows.

301
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:43,600
Yeah, that's twice you've made a joke about this and not taking it seriously.

302
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:44,600
I can't help it.

303
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:45,600
I can't help it.

304
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:48,000
You know, Joe, Joe, here's the thing.

305
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,720
Here's the thing, Joe.

306
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:55,320
If ButterFS was 100% solid and this code, this driver code was 100% solid, like we're

307
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:59,680
years into it being solid, then it's like serious usable storage technology.

308
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:04,280
But when it's an alpha driver for a file system that appears to be in beta state, I just can't

309
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:05,280
help it.

310
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:06,280
I can't help but laugh.

311
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:07,280
Well, hang on.

312
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:08,280
This is a 1.0 release.

313
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:10,520
That means it's completely finished and ready for production, right?

314
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:11,520
Yeah, it does.

315
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:12,520
It does.

316
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:13,520
It does look good.

317
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:17,120
I mean, it feels like it's only ready for production after years of being in production

318
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:18,240
when it comes to storage.

319
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:23,560
But it's got all of the major features, including RAID 0, 1, 10, 5, 6.

320
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:24,720
It's got caching.

321
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:28,440
It's got discovery of partitions, supports ACLs and symlinks.

322
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:34,240
It has free caching, I mean, free space caching, and it has compression support.

323
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:35,360
It's got trim support for SS.

324
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:36,360
I mean, it's all there, Joe.

325
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:37,360
It's all there.

326
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:39,680
It's arguably more there than Butterfess itself.

327
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:43,380
Yeah, I guess it's been in the works for more than a year or two.

328
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:45,160
So I have been making some fun.

329
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:46,160
You're right.

330
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:47,760
I respect it, though, and I appreciate it.

331
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:51,160
I know if I'm ever on a Windows machine and all of a sudden I need an extended 4 driver,

332
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:53,160
I am so thankful when I find one.

333
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:54,160
Yeah, exactly.

334
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:58,400
And if you are a SUSE user, then this might come in useful.

335
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,920
I think that's just the root partition, isn't it?

336
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:07,960
Like the storage tends to be something else, so it might not be that useful, but it's good

337
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:13,440
to see that Windows users can access Butterfess now at least.

338
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:16,660
Yeah, I suppose so.

339
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:18,680
And I don't judge anyone for using it.

340
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:19,720
Have a good time.

341
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:20,720
Let us know how it goes.

342
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:25,160
Go to jupitabroadcasting.com slash contact and send us an email or at linuxactionnews

343
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:26,640
on Twitter if you've tried this.

344
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,400
Meanwhile, let's take a look at Docker Hub.

345
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:34,280
Yeah, some stats about the base distribution in Docker images on Docker Hub that I found

346
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:36,200
really surprising this week.

347
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:37,460
Yeah, I did as well.

348
00:19:37,460 --> 00:19:40,120
So this is an analysis that the Anchor platform does.

349
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:45,380
They look at a bunch of different data sources, and so it's as reliable as their methodology,

350
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:50,000
but they're pulling it from Docker Hub, and soon they're going to expand to Amazon EC2

351
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
and other ones.

352
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:56,000
But right now they're just pulling from Docker Hub, and they show Debian with a surprising

353
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:04,640
61.7% lead as the base OS for these containers, and Alpine is number two at 19.7%.

354
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:11,360
And then coming in at a distant third, they show Ubuntu at 7.8%.

355
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:13,440
Now that is the big surprise to me.

356
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:17,520
Alpine I would expect to be very popular because it's so lightweight, it's so slimmed down,

357
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:20,820
it's perfect for containerization.

358
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:24,720
But then my understanding was that Ubuntu was up there with it, and that maybe it would

359
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:31,240
be kind of those two sharing, you know, 50-50 of the biggest chunk of it, and then all the

360
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:36,000
other ones, CentOS, BusyBox, you know, the smaller ones taking a small slice.

361
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,980
But I just had no idea that Debian was so popular.

362
00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:42,320
This data surprised me because some of the numbers, the market share I had heard for

363
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:46,160
Ubuntu was like 70% of containers.

364
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:52,540
To see Ubuntu represented at 7.8% leads me to think either a couple of things, Anchor's

365
00:20:52,540 --> 00:20:57,560
data is bogus, or that number is dramatically different depending on where you survey.

366
00:20:57,560 --> 00:21:01,840
Look at this on Docker Hub, that right there, let's stop there, Docker Hub contains a lot

367
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:06,000
of hobby projects, a lot of things people are just throwing up there and trying out.

368
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:11,020
If you were to look at things like Amazon EC2 or Azure, where people are running expensive

369
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:15,320
instances, they're getting work done, I wonder if these numbers would be significantly different.

370
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:19,320
So the platform you survey probably makes a huge difference in the results that you

371
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:20,320
get.

372
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:23,600
I expect to see a lot more Red Hat and a lot more Ubuntu, basically.

373
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:30,200
Yeah, yeah, because CentOS is 3.7%, it has less market share than unknown.

374
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:34,640
The only distribution that is more poorly represented on this chart is SUSE because

375
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:38,440
they don't open SUSE and SUSE Enterprise don't even register on the map.

376
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:45,460
Well again, you'd kind of expect to see SUSE on Azure and Amazon clouds rather than, as

377
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:47,160
you say, more of the hobbyist stuff.

378
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:54,440
So maybe when we get an analysis of that, which is promised by Anchor, then we will

379
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:55,440
see that for sure.

380
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:58,340
But this is another name clash, isn't it?

381
00:21:58,340 --> 00:22:00,760
How many tech things are there called Anchor?

382
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:07,000
There's that podcasting thing, there's these guys, and then there's the portable chargers.

383
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,720
It gets really confusing.

384
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:12,000
It's an old pet peeve of mine, Joe, that seems like an old man's complaint, but why can't

385
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:16,240
these kids figure out these names?

386
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:18,360
So let's talk about NGINX.

387
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:23,640
And it seems that they're growing up because at first it was kind of a really lightweight

388
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:27,880
server and good to use as a load balancer and a proxy and that kind of stuff.

389
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:31,440
But of course, they've got NGINX Plus, which is their proprietary commercial offering,

390
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:36,600
and now they're looking to seriously expand that and basically become proper enterprise-y

391
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:37,600
corporate.

392
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:42,280
Yeah, an application platform is how they're positioning themselves with a suite of products

393
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:44,840
that you put together and it makes a platform.

394
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:51,640
So you take NGINX Plus, which combines a load balancer and a cache and a web server, and

395
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:57,320
it's built on top of the open source NGINX, and then this platform also includes the NGINX

396
00:22:57,320 --> 00:23:00,800
Controller, which is like a centralized management component.

397
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:04,360
Now you can see where it's maybe going to play a role in enterprise with internal applications

398
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:06,600
built on top of Node.js and whatnot.

399
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:12,200
Yeah, and they are now going to support Kubernetes as well, which is massive in the enterprise.

400
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:15,400
Well, certainly if Canonical are to be believed.

401
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:19,080
Containers and Kubernetes and all of that and centralized management, that's all the

402
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:24,360
buzzwords and things you've got to do to play in this modern agile app world that Red Hat

403
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:25,960
and Canonical are all going after.

404
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:29,400
These are all the boxes you have to check, and NGINX is staying very competitive by doing

405
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:30,400
this.

406
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:34,300
To what extent do you think it's going to impact the open source version that millions

407
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:35,720
of people are using?

408
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:39,720
I'm going to hope that it just means increased funding for development.

409
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:43,720
And I would imagine that they recognize keeping that open, keeping that available exactly

410
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:49,080
as it is, is a key part to adoption and a key part to the integration they've seen in

411
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:50,080
the industry.

412
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:54,360
Yeah, because you need to learn something and you're not going to pay probably, whereas

413
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:58,840
if you can just app get install it or, you know, yum install it or whatever, it gets

414
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:04,240
to people who are learning it in the first place, sort of tied into NGINX, and then once

415
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:08,860
they're working professionally with it, maybe they're going to be convinced of their company

416
00:24:08,860 --> 00:24:13,600
to pay for the NGINX Plus and this new application platform.

417
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:17,800
NGINX is going through a process that we've seen a lot of open source projects over the

418
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:20,740
years go through when they become really critical to the enterprise.

419
00:24:20,740 --> 00:24:25,960
We've seen this happen with Docker and other projects where businesses form around them.

420
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:28,520
And then all of a sudden, they have a lot of different priorities.

421
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:34,840
I'm hoping that in 2017, we can look back at all the previous attempts, learn from their

422
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:37,000
mistakes and do it right.

423
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:40,120
So far, I haven't heard a lot of people complaining about them screwing this up.

424
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:41,640
Well here's hoping.
