Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, our weekly take on Linux and the open source world.

00:16.360 --> 00:21.840
This is episode 107, recorded on May 26th, 2019. I'm Chris.

00:21.840 --> 00:22.840
And I'm Joe.

00:22.840 --> 00:27.200
Hello, Joe. Good to be connected with you. We have a packed week, like a whole range

00:27.200 --> 00:32.400
of news stories. So let's kick things off with a brand new, faster than ever, Firefox

00:32.400 --> 00:33.400
release.

00:33.400 --> 00:39.200
Yeah, Firefox 67 and Mozilla are very proud of this release, saying that it is the fastest

00:39.200 --> 00:44.360
ever. And I've been running this for a few days, and I've not noticed it be any slower,

00:44.360 --> 00:47.880
but I can't say I've noticed it be any faster. What about you?

00:47.880 --> 00:52.240
Oh, that's funny. You know what? I noticed it immediately. I noticed it specifically

00:52.240 --> 00:56.960
in the way that Firefox paints the web pages now. And I did some looking into it, and it

00:56.960 --> 01:01.380
turns out there's some reason. First of all, they deprioritized the least commonly used

01:01.380 --> 01:06.320
features so they they just did a full review of all of the areas they felt could cause

01:06.320 --> 01:11.080
delay on delivering that painting effect of the web page. And they went through there

01:11.080 --> 01:15.440
and they looked at things like delaying the set timeout in order to prioritize scripts

01:15.440 --> 01:21.220
for things you need first, while maybe delaying other components on the website. This looks

01:21.220 --> 01:27.200
really great on Amazon or on Twitter or on Instagram where you'll see it will load the

01:27.200 --> 01:31.200
components necessary for you to navigate and read the page. And then the really complex

01:31.200 --> 01:36.180
little objects that are just sort of add ons. It adds those second and adds the images second

01:36.180 --> 01:40.480
like so that you immediately get the content. And the other thing that's very nice is if

01:40.480 --> 01:46.280
you're in a low memory situation, which Firefox seems to be lower than 400 megabytes of free

01:46.280 --> 01:52.320
RAM, it will now auto suspend unused tabs. It has some sort of timeout. If you haven't

01:52.320 --> 01:58.440
looked at them for a while, it just puts them to sleep. That's great. I noticed the painting

01:58.440 --> 02:03.720
stuff but having a whole bunch of tabs open is sometimes a bad habit of mine. So having

02:03.720 --> 02:05.720
that suspend feature could be very nice.

02:05.720 --> 02:12.080
Well, maybe it's because I relatively recently built this fairly fast machine and Firefox

02:12.080 --> 02:16.520
has just felt fast ever since then. But I don't know, I just don't see it. Now that

02:16.520 --> 02:21.000
you're talking about that painting thing, I've opened a few tabs and I can kind of see

02:21.000 --> 02:26.120
it but I don't know, maybe I'm just not observant enough. I think maybe if I went back to the

02:26.120 --> 02:31.160
old version, then I'd suddenly notice it. That's always the way with speed improvements

02:31.160 --> 02:36.840
for things. I can remember putting an SSD in my wife's laptop and said to her, so have

02:36.840 --> 02:40.920
you noticed it's faster? She's like, no, not at all. I said, right, I'm putting your hard

02:40.920 --> 02:45.040
disk back in and then she's like, okay, yes, this is significantly slower.

02:45.040 --> 02:49.920
Yeah, that's a great way to put it. I think I noticed it more because I was coming from

02:49.920 --> 02:54.560
Chrome as my daily driver and when I saw the Firefox update come down, which I got to say,

02:54.560 --> 02:58.840
both Fedora and Ubuntu updated pretty quickly. When I saw it land, I was like, all right,

02:58.840 --> 03:02.820
I got to give this a go. I noticed it because it's different than how Chrome renders the

03:02.820 --> 03:08.300
webpage and I think I prefer it. Something else they slipped in 67 is what they're calling

03:08.300 --> 03:15.680
the world's fastest AV1 decoder. AV1 is a new video decoder by Dave 1D, which is now

03:15.680 --> 03:22.560
enabled by default in Windows, OS 10, and Linux builds of Firefox, both 32-bit and 64-bit.

03:22.560 --> 03:32.160
It claims files that are 30% smaller than VP9 WebM codecs and 50% smaller than H.264.

03:32.160 --> 03:36.840
The other cool thing about this is that it's sponsored by the Alliance for Open Media,

03:36.840 --> 03:43.480
which is a joint effort between Videolan, the VLC folks, and FFmpeg, and it's baked

03:43.480 --> 03:45.000
into Firefox 67 now.

03:45.000 --> 03:50.560
Yeah, we talked about AV1, it must be a couple of months ago now, and that is a royalty-free

03:50.560 --> 03:56.140
video codec. It looked like it was going to be a bit of a kind of slow transition over

03:56.140 --> 04:01.100
to it, but thanks to being baked into Firefox, hopefully that's going to really push it forward

04:01.100 --> 04:03.880
and become the standard much sooner.

04:03.880 --> 04:07.540
It's really buried the lead though with the new Firefox 67 release. This is what really

04:07.540 --> 04:13.780
matters is there's this new support for smart dark mode. There's this prefers color scheme

04:13.780 --> 04:18.920
media feature now that allows sites to adapt their styles to match the preferences for

04:18.920 --> 04:23.880
the browser. So if you come to a website with dark mode enabled for Firefox, the website

04:23.880 --> 04:28.000
will load a dark version. I think that's so cool, and there is a great dark theme now

04:28.000 --> 04:34.600
for Firefox, and I'm just really happy because I love dark mode for the web.

04:34.600 --> 04:37.920
You may have predicted that dark mode was going to be the thing for this year.

04:37.920 --> 04:40.240
I know, so this is just wonderful.

04:40.240 --> 04:45.680
Yeah. Well, it does show that they're in tune with what's going on because the whole tech

04:45.680 --> 04:47.520
industry seems to be going over to dark mode.

04:47.520 --> 04:51.800
Hey, it's easy on the eyes, man. It's easy on the eyes. There's one kind of major change

04:51.800 --> 04:58.940
that landed in 67 that is messing with some folks. If you launched Firefox 67 and your

04:58.940 --> 05:04.240
add-ons were gone, your history was gone, all of your customizations were gone, that's

05:04.240 --> 05:09.600
being caused because the browser created a new profile for 67 instead of using your original

05:09.600 --> 05:15.800
one. This isn't a super uncommon problem. Firefox keeps each set of user data in their

05:15.800 --> 05:22.360
own profiles, and starting in 67, Mozilla has switched to individual profiles for each

05:22.360 --> 05:24.320
installed version of Firefox.

05:24.320 --> 05:28.640
Yeah, which could be super handy if you've got the beta or nightly or whatever alongside

05:28.640 --> 05:33.240
the standard one and you want to have a separate profile, but it seems that that has caused

05:33.240 --> 05:35.740
issues for quite a number of users.

05:35.740 --> 05:39.840
It is nice because sometimes those nightlies or those betas don't maybe support an extension

05:39.840 --> 05:43.800
or et cetera. There's lots of reasons why you might want to have that. It's a necessary

05:43.800 --> 05:46.880
change, but yeah, it's causing some workflow disruption.

05:46.880 --> 05:51.960
It is possible to rescue your old profile though, so all is not lost here. It's only

05:51.960 --> 05:56.040
a few clicks away, but it still must be very annoying. Thankfully, it hasn't happened to

05:56.040 --> 06:01.760
me, but I've read quite a lot of reports of it happening to people. But yeah, it's a bit

06:01.760 --> 06:07.880
embarrassing, but it's not quite on the scale of the last time people lost all their extensions,

06:07.880 --> 06:09.720
but let's not dwell too much on that, eh?

06:09.720 --> 06:13.800
No, hot off the mirrors in Germany, we have new releases of OpenSUSE, so let's dwell

06:13.800 --> 06:18.920
on that for a moment. A brand new release of 15.1 OpenSUSE Leap.

06:18.920 --> 06:23.320
Yeah, this is OpenSUSE Leap, which is their snapshot version, not to be confused with

06:23.320 --> 06:28.060
Tumbleweed, which is the rolling release. This is much closer to the Enterprise Edition

06:28.060 --> 06:30.120
SLE, as they call it.

06:30.120 --> 06:35.480
And 15.1 really seems to be about pulling in features that just make it a great stable

06:35.480 --> 06:40.240
Linux station. Lots of notes in here about improvements to Yast functionality, and they've

06:40.240 --> 06:46.820
backported the graphics hardware stack in the 4.19 Linux kernel to the kernel that ships

06:46.820 --> 06:52.100
in Leap, which is based on 4.12. And that's pretty nice, because that includes improved

06:52.100 --> 06:58.200
support for the AMD Vega chipset, now in a stable Enterprise-style distribution.

06:58.200 --> 07:04.600
Also in here is GNOME 3.26, and the long-term support version of Plasma 5.12. You can also

07:04.600 --> 07:11.260
install XFCE, if you like. And of course, Leap out of the box works with x86-64. But

07:11.260 --> 07:16.640
there's all kinds of now what they call deployment scenarios for physical machines, virtual machines,

07:16.640 --> 07:20.860
and they've got some cloud and container discussion in here as well. And they talk about the community's

07:20.860 --> 07:24.740
work to port it to ARM64 and power architectures.

07:24.740 --> 07:29.960
And then last but not least, nice to see a line in here about OpenSUSE for the Raspberry

07:29.960 --> 07:36.160
Pi now being simplified into one image that is very customizable. I downloaded it. I have

07:36.160 --> 07:40.520
it on my desktop upstairs right now. I'm going to give it a go here pretty soon. If I have

07:40.520 --> 07:44.080
anything to report, I might share my additional hands-on thoughts in Linux Unplugged this

07:44.080 --> 07:50.040
week. But initially, I want a stable Enterprise-grade workstation perspective. This looks like a

07:50.040 --> 07:54.820
super solid release, and it's nice to see them bring some of those graphics stack stuff

07:54.820 --> 08:00.520
back to their 4.12 kernel. And to see it based around 5.12 Plasma, which I'm running here

08:00.520 --> 08:05.000
in the studio, is a fantastic release of the Plasma desktop. Nice long-term support stack

08:05.000 --> 08:06.000
there.

08:06.000 --> 08:10.840
It's interesting that OpenSUSE really is there to try and hook you in, and then they can

08:10.840 --> 08:17.000
upsell you on the Enterprise edition because you can update directly from an OpenSUSE 15.1

08:17.000 --> 08:25.680
release to SUSE Linux Enterprise 15.1. And that update is seamless, supposedly. So they're

08:25.680 --> 08:30.440
quite transparent about that, that this is just to hook you in. And I like that. I like

08:30.440 --> 08:35.320
how they're just straightforward about it. This is our community edition, but hey, if

08:35.320 --> 08:38.280
you want to pay us for support, then it's really easy.

08:38.280 --> 08:43.920
Yeah. No pressure. Kick the tires. See it. Drive it. Put it in production. Make sure

08:43.920 --> 08:47.560
it's a good fit. And then if you decide that it's valuable enough that you want to upgrade

08:47.560 --> 08:51.320
to a paid support version, well, here's our phone number. I think it's actually a very

08:51.320 --> 08:56.840
clever move. This release comes at a very pivotal time for SUSE. Right now, as we record,

08:56.840 --> 09:01.420
OpenSUSE Con 2019 is happening. They're up there tweeting about it right now. But the

09:01.420 --> 09:07.200
other significant thing happening around this release is that OpenSUSE is considering changing

09:07.200 --> 09:10.200
their governance model, or at least they're looking at their options.

09:10.200 --> 09:15.120
Yeah, it's very, very early days for this. But they're looking around at the reality

09:15.120 --> 09:21.180
of this situation. SUSE keeps getting bought, doesn't it? And at the moment, they are completely

09:21.180 --> 09:25.520
dependent on the parent company. And things are working absolutely fine at the moment.

09:25.520 --> 09:30.120
They're perfectly happy. But who knows what's going to happen next time they get sold, which

09:30.120 --> 09:35.960
does seem inevitable. They are owned by an investment firm at the moment. And maybe that

09:35.960 --> 09:40.800
company isn't going to be necessarily as friendly to the OpenSUSE side of things. And so if

09:40.800 --> 09:45.240
they had more independent governance, then maybe they'd be in a stronger position. And

09:45.240 --> 09:49.280
so that's the discussion that they're having now. And because it's all open source, it's

09:49.280 --> 09:55.160
all out in the open. But I think it's going to be a long time really before anything happens.

09:55.160 --> 09:57.520
We're talking about months at minimum here.

09:57.520 --> 10:02.000
Well, good on them. Then that is exactly when they should be having this conversation. And

10:02.000 --> 10:07.800
also, good on them for how frank this conversation is. And the message seems pretty clear. Today,

10:07.800 --> 10:11.800
as things stand, they're not really an issue. And they're pretty happy with the public commitment

10:11.800 --> 10:18.400
that SUSE has made to OpenSUSE. But there is, like you said, that really kind of honest

10:18.400 --> 10:22.680
underpinning line here that says, it was an equity firm. And they're going to make them

10:22.680 --> 10:26.880
into a valuable purchase again for a reason, to sell them to somebody that's willing to

10:26.880 --> 10:31.400
spend money on them. And what happens then? Does that commitment change at that point?

10:31.400 --> 10:35.480
Because we don't know who the new owners would be. They could be somebody great, or not.

10:35.480 --> 10:39.800
And how does that affect us as a long term project who has commitments we want to make

10:39.800 --> 10:44.520
to our users? I think it's brilliant. They're thinking about that absolutely necessary.

10:44.520 --> 10:50.200
And honestly, if I was a daily driver of OpenSUSE, seeing that the team is willing to have this

10:50.200 --> 10:53.920
frank of a conversation around the issue and have it in the public would give me a lot

10:53.920 --> 10:57.820
of comfort to know that their heads in the right space and they're planning for the future.

10:57.820 --> 11:01.440
And they're doing it respectfully too. I think the conversation is respectful. Their timing

11:01.440 --> 11:06.080
is right. And the whole thing is, I think, being done really well. Also credit to Richard

11:06.080 --> 11:10.520
Brown, who seems to be very open to having this conversation and listening to what matters

11:10.520 --> 11:15.320
to these people. And he's not necessarily validating all of the concerns, but he's listening.

11:15.320 --> 11:17.720
And I think that's a big credit to him as well.

11:17.720 --> 11:23.040
Yeah, and thinking about governance structure and making proper plans is something that

11:23.040 --> 11:28.840
a lot of Linux distros could afford to do. Unfortunately, it seems that didn't happen

11:28.840 --> 11:34.880
with Antegos. And so that project is shutting down and pretty quickly.

11:34.880 --> 11:40.000
Whoo, boy, this hit me hard. You linked me to this. I think I was just about to go on

11:40.000 --> 11:44.960
air to record last week's Linux Unplugged and this dropped and it was like a ton of

11:44.960 --> 11:50.000
bricks had landed in the studio. I also I have to say I really respect and appreciate

11:50.000 --> 11:53.480
the way they're communicating this while I'm supremely disappointed because I think it

11:53.480 --> 11:59.300
was a really great distribution. They're being forefront. They're not dragging this thing

11:59.300 --> 12:04.280
on for a year. They're not ghosting out. They write, we came to this decision because we

12:04.280 --> 12:09.760
believe that continuing to neglect the project would be a huge disservice to the community.

12:09.760 --> 12:14.080
And they're right. So handling it this way, explaining what's going on and telling them

12:14.080 --> 12:18.380
what the exit strategy is, which they write, soon we will release an update that will remove

12:18.380 --> 12:23.000
the Antegos repos from your system, along with any Antegos specific packages that no

12:23.000 --> 12:25.920
longer serve a purpose due to the project ending.

12:25.920 --> 12:29.880
Yeah. So if you're running Antegos, you're just going to be running vanilla arch. So

12:29.880 --> 12:32.760
you're not completely left out in the cold at all. You're still going to get all your

12:32.760 --> 12:40.880
updates and everything, but it is still disappointing to see this happen. Although there is a move

12:40.880 --> 12:44.480
to potentially carry it on under a different name.

12:44.480 --> 12:49.840
That's right. When one project closes a door, another opens a window, Joe. It's called Endeavor.

12:49.840 --> 12:55.160
This is a post over on the Antegos forum. And they write that they're going to continue

12:55.160 --> 13:00.680
on in the spirit of Antegos. And the first stage is to set up a spot for the community

13:00.680 --> 13:08.760
to get together. I guess I applaud them. I think if I could go all Pacific Northwest

13:08.760 --> 13:12.560
artist on you for a moment, though, I feel like they should let Antegos go, man. Like

13:12.560 --> 13:16.360
let the art die and go create something new, man. Go create your own thing.

13:16.360 --> 13:20.480
Yeah. Well, we say it's called Endeavor. That's only the code name for now. They do want the

13:20.480 --> 13:24.760
community to help them come up with a new name. And a few things have been tossed around,

13:24.760 --> 13:30.240
but it doesn't look like they've decided yet. But this does feel a little bit like kind

13:30.240 --> 13:36.120
of clutching at straws. And perhaps the people involved in this don't really understand how

13:36.120 --> 13:42.540
much effort is involved with running a distro. It is an enormous amount of effort. And always

13:42.540 --> 13:46.600
people will jump up and say, hey, yeah, I can carry it on. But then when the reality

13:46.600 --> 13:51.960
dawns on them, you do have to wonder whether they will actually follow through with this.

13:51.960 --> 13:56.400
You kind of have to give them the benefit of the doubt at this stage, but I'm not massively

13:56.400 --> 13:57.760
hopeful for it, I'm afraid.

13:57.760 --> 14:01.640
You know, the pragmatist in me says there's a couple of nice things that Antegos brings

14:01.640 --> 14:05.840
to the table. Number one, you have a graphical installer called Cinchy that's actually pretty

14:05.840 --> 14:10.580
legit and they could continue to use that. It's open source. And just really putting

14:10.580 --> 14:16.680
that on top of what would otherwise be a fairly vanilla Arch install. That's great. If Endeavor

14:16.680 --> 14:22.280
turns into that, if they can avoid the whole custom repos, custom packages, because that

14:22.280 --> 14:25.600
is actually where Antegos got a little off in the weeds sometimes anyways. So if they

14:25.600 --> 14:30.680
could avoid all of that and continue to use Cinchy just to give people a nice 10 minute

14:30.680 --> 14:35.040
way to install Arch and pick your desktop and be done, I think it's nice. People always

14:35.040 --> 14:39.160
discount these kind of distributions and you always get people saying all the time, and

14:39.160 --> 14:42.960
this has been the number one comment since this news came out is, ah, Arch isn't that

14:42.960 --> 14:47.920
bad, just install it yourself. What people don't appreciate is A, that's true, and B,

14:47.920 --> 14:53.160
it doesn't matter. Straight up doesn't matter. Does not matter at all. There is just a simple

14:53.160 --> 15:01.240
barrier to entry where closing that gap, closing that tiny 5 to 10% gap makes all of the difference

15:01.240 --> 15:05.800
in the world. That's why jails have been around for decades, but Docker is a huge deal. They

15:05.800 --> 15:12.240
made, they closed that, the 10% difference often makes a significant one. And a graphical

15:12.240 --> 15:18.240
installer that you boot into in a live environment that lets you check a box for ZFS, gives you

15:18.240 --> 15:22.500
forms to fill out all of your users, and then you can choose one of the great open source

15:22.500 --> 15:26.280
desktop environments from a list, and then you hit a couple of buttons and you'll walk

15:26.280 --> 15:31.040
back in 10 minutes and you have a fully up to date, ready to go Arch install. I don't

15:31.040 --> 15:34.960
care who you are, that's convenient and it's that convenience that people want. That's

15:34.960 --> 15:41.160
why people buy apps in app stores. It's convenience, it's nice, it's simple. They got other things

15:41.160 --> 15:44.040
to do with their day. That was the gap Anagros filled.

15:44.040 --> 15:49.680
Yeah. And to some extent, Manjaro has filled that as well. And call it a coincidence, but

15:49.680 --> 15:54.460
this week Manjaro tweeted that they've had over a million downloads so far this year.

15:54.460 --> 15:59.360
So that's only just over one quarter's worth, which is pretty impressive.

15:59.360 --> 16:04.520
That is. People love Manjaro. And I'm sure it's a total coincidence since Anagros mentioned

16:04.520 --> 16:09.960
they had 900,000 downloads since 2014. I bet you it's a total coincidence.

16:09.960 --> 16:16.200
But there are a couple of other simple ways and scripts and stuff to install Arch. So

16:16.200 --> 16:21.560
I don't think we necessarily need Endeavor to continue and actually work out. There are

16:21.560 --> 16:27.560
simple ways to do it. But I don't know, Anagros was just the go to, wasn't it? If you want

16:27.560 --> 16:31.740
Manjaro and the customizations that they have, then you go down that route. But if you want

16:31.740 --> 16:34.600
something more vanilla, then you go for Anticross.

16:34.600 --> 16:37.840
Yeah. And you're right. There's plenty of different ways to install Arch that are very

16:37.840 --> 16:43.520
quick and simple. And that's why I think maybe Endeavor doesn't need to be a thing. When

16:43.520 --> 16:48.480
I put the Pacific Northwest hat on, which is nice, man. It's actually got a wood veneer

16:48.480 --> 16:51.560
front. I'm not kidding. I got a Pacific... It really is cool. It's a ball cap with a

16:51.560 --> 16:57.600
wood front. That's why I feel like just let it go. It was here. The market didn't really

16:57.600 --> 17:01.920
seem to respond super strong. Just let it go. But the pragmatist says, well, that sentry

17:01.920 --> 17:08.240
is nice. But there are a lot of others. I did a look around and I saw a couple, just

17:08.240 --> 17:13.480
within a couple of minutes of searching, and then some extra research was done by the team.

17:13.480 --> 17:18.000
And we found another handful of distributions that are basically vanilla Arch with an easy

17:18.000 --> 17:21.440
to use installer. Some of them are command lines. Some of them are graphical.

17:21.440 --> 17:27.020
Yeah. Maybe they should just let it go. Unlike Google, who will not let go of Google Glass.

17:27.020 --> 17:32.080
We keep thinking that it's going to die, but it seems to just keep coming back.

17:32.080 --> 17:37.200
Maybe there's a good crossover here. You could get flair that says, I'm an Arch user, and

17:37.200 --> 17:40.600
people that have Google Glass could see that flair above your head. You see, there could

17:40.600 --> 17:46.040
be a crossover. Just get it out of the way right there when you walk up. Yeah, it's back,

17:46.040 --> 17:51.540
Joe. Google is ready to have you purchase Google Glass Enterprise Edition 2 if you're

17:51.540 --> 17:57.260
willing to spend $1,000, which is actually a discount from the 1500 the last Enterprise

17:57.260 --> 18:02.960
Edition was. This one has a faster processor, an improved camera. It jumps from, I believe,

18:02.960 --> 18:09.800
five megapixels to now it's at eight megapixels. Still 720p video, but it looks better. And

18:09.800 --> 18:15.040
probably the biggest standout difference is you can get it with these Smith Optics safety

18:15.040 --> 18:19.160
frames. So it kind of looks like you're supposed to be on a construction site or something.

18:19.160 --> 18:22.520
I think they're telling us who this is targeted at, Joe. We did actually talk about this back

18:22.520 --> 18:27.220
in March on the show, but at the time that was just kind of speculation. Yeah, we saw

18:27.220 --> 18:32.360
the rumors and it did seem like back then they were making a straight beeline for business.

18:32.360 --> 18:38.480
Yeah. And here we are with the actual reality of it. And sure enough, yeah, it is very much

18:38.480 --> 18:43.680
aimed at enterprise and it's actually slightly higher spec than everyone had thought back

18:43.680 --> 18:47.640
then. Right. So not only does it have those nicer specs, but on the software side, Google

18:47.640 --> 18:53.700
is touting in sort of a big way that this is now quote unquote easier to develop for

18:53.700 --> 18:58.320
because it's now built on Android. I thought the previous versions were, but apparently

18:58.320 --> 19:04.000
it was its own custom OS and they continue. It can now leverage existing APIs as well

19:04.000 --> 19:11.560
as, and this is a big one, Android enterprise mobile device management for scaled deployments.

19:11.560 --> 19:15.760
So I think one could pretty easily see how this could be used by different manufacturing

19:15.760 --> 19:19.560
plants, say like a Tesla or some other modern place that's working with technology like

19:19.560 --> 19:23.280
this. You get a fleet of these things and then you use that central management system

19:23.280 --> 19:29.240
to flash work specific applications for the work of the day. I actually could see this

19:29.240 --> 19:34.060
being useful. It's weird and creepy obviously because it's a Google device strapped to your

19:34.060 --> 19:39.640
face that's always connected to the internet. We have to make that disclaimer obviously,

19:39.640 --> 19:43.680
but when they focus on business like this, the use cases become a little more obvious.

19:43.680 --> 19:48.120
Yeah, you do have to wonder if they will eventually make that crossover back into the consumer

19:48.120 --> 19:54.680
space, but I think that ship has sailed really. I think this is just them completely pivoting

19:54.680 --> 20:01.160
and realizing that there is a market for it where it kind of doesn't matter. Like at work,

20:01.160 --> 20:05.580
everyone's on camera all the time anyway and you're all being watched by bosses and stuff.

20:05.580 --> 20:10.920
So it doesn't really matter that privacy aspect of it. Whereas out and about in the real world,

20:10.920 --> 20:16.320
people are just not really going to go for this. So it's kind of weird to see it live

20:16.320 --> 20:21.520
on and I don't know, a thousand dollars, it still seems very expensive for what you're

20:21.520 --> 20:28.600
actually getting there. So I don't know how popular it's going to be really. Maybe they

20:28.600 --> 20:34.120
can do some bulk deals with enterprises, but I don't know. I think that it's just still

20:34.120 --> 20:38.040
a bit too pricey. That was always my concern with it in the first place. Not even really

20:38.040 --> 20:43.480
the privacy stuff. It was just, I'm not spending a thousand dollars or pounds on this thing.

20:43.480 --> 20:47.360
Well, for me, I was always waiting for the Huawei edition to come out, but I guess that

20:47.360 --> 20:49.080
won't be happening now.

20:49.080 --> 20:51.680
Yeah, probably not.

20:51.680 --> 20:55.920
Maybe they'll run KaiOS though. The rate things are going. This might be the third OS.

20:55.920 --> 21:02.280
Yeah, it's possible. And this week, KaiOS got another $50 million of funding and announced

21:02.280 --> 21:07.000
that it's hit a hundred million handsets that have been shipped.

21:07.000 --> 21:13.760
Soak that in for a second. A hundred million shipped devices across a hundred countries.

21:13.760 --> 21:20.720
And by the way, that new $50 million infusion brings our total fundraising up to $72 million.

21:20.720 --> 21:24.600
You'll recall the last time we talked about them, Google had just invested $22 million

21:24.600 --> 21:25.600
into the business.

21:25.600 --> 21:30.800
Yeah, yeah. And so this is the continuation of Firefox OS of course. And that again is

21:30.800 --> 21:35.480
something I didn't expect to see live on. But this KaiOS seems to be going from strength

21:35.480 --> 21:41.320
to strength. I actually did have a hands on with it on the Nokia, is it the 8110? I can't

21:41.320 --> 21:47.920
remember, the Banana, the Matrix phone anyway. And I wasn't really very surprised by it.

21:47.920 --> 21:53.360
It was just exactly what I expected, which is like somewhere in between a feature phone

21:53.360 --> 21:59.840
and a smartphone. It had apps to some extent, but didn't have a touchscreen. And so navigation

21:59.840 --> 22:05.960
was really clunky on it, but it was a very cheap device. So I can see the market they're

22:05.960 --> 22:13.080
going for. And that market is not in Europe or the US, it's in developing countries. And

22:13.080 --> 22:17.000
well, obviously it must be doing well.

22:17.000 --> 22:21.520
It's funny how up my alley a phone like this. So first of all, they have like the, the Banana

22:21.520 --> 22:25.760
phone styles, but they also have like the traditional flip phones. I miss having a flip

22:25.760 --> 22:30.320
phone where I could flip it closed, put it in my pocket. And I don't need a ton of stuff.

22:30.320 --> 22:34.520
In fact, in a way I'd like to have a simpler phone, but I wouldn't mind still having navigation.

22:34.520 --> 22:39.240
I wouldn't mind having YouTube on there as well. So it's, I actually, I would probably

22:39.240 --> 22:43.240
consider buying one of these if they sold them here in the West. I think it's also an

22:43.240 --> 22:48.640
interesting thought exercise to just talk about the numbers again, one more time, but

22:48.640 --> 22:53.440
keep the Librem five in mind. Now, when we talk about these numbers, they've shipped

22:53.440 --> 23:01.000
to a hundred million devices across a hundred countries. They've raised $72 million in funds

23:01.000 --> 23:05.880
just to do this one thing, just to do this.

23:05.880 --> 23:10.840
And they, they're not even a blip on anyone's radar in, in our circles. I just think we

23:10.840 --> 23:17.880
don't even have a appreciation as average users to the scale of the mobile market. I'll

23:17.880 --> 23:21.640
give you another number that's kind of staggering right now. It's estimated that today there

23:21.640 --> 23:27.840
are around 1.5 billion feature phone users active in the market. Feature phones still

23:27.840 --> 23:34.760
account for almost 25% of all handset shipments in Q3 of last year alone, which works out

23:34.760 --> 23:41.200
to be about a $28 billion market opportunity. I think we have a hard time conceptualizing

23:41.200 --> 23:46.680
the size of this market and the scale in which a company must reach in order to even have

23:46.680 --> 23:52.640
what would be considered somewhat sustainable success. And when you think about that and

23:52.640 --> 23:56.720
Purism's also building their own operating system, they're building laptops, they're

23:56.720 --> 24:02.240
trying to do hosted services. They're trying to build a phone. They're also trying to free

24:02.240 --> 24:07.580
the firmware on Intel management systems. They're trying to make applications convergent

24:07.580 --> 24:12.740
across their custom desktop and their phone OS. Plus they also have to support the devices

24:12.740 --> 24:18.400
they ship at the end of the day, and now the service they've launched. It's a massive undertaking

24:18.400 --> 24:23.060
and the scale of success in which you must reach to even really become sustainable I

24:23.060 --> 24:26.720
think is beyond our comprehension right now, but we're about to learn.

24:26.720 --> 24:31.840
Well, yeah. I mean, imagine KaiOS was just totally independent and not based on Firefox

24:31.840 --> 24:33.960
OS. We probably wouldn't have even heard of it.

24:33.960 --> 24:38.000
No. Or if it hadn't gotten $22 million from Google alone.

24:38.000 --> 24:39.000
Well, yeah.

24:39.000 --> 24:44.760
I mean, it's raised $72 million now. It takes a lot of money to do this and it takes a big

24:44.760 --> 24:51.400
team and it takes a lot of deals. It's a fascinating market and I think we have a hard time conceptualizing,

24:51.400 --> 24:54.160
especially when it goes to anything outside the West.

24:54.160 --> 24:55.160
That's true.

24:55.160 --> 25:00.560
I would have loved to have seen KaiOS or Firefox OS continue on though in these types of handsets.

25:00.560 --> 25:05.920
Imagine one of these things, $80 to $100 with a day or two battery life that gives you basic

25:05.920 --> 25:11.000
connectivity and functionality. Man, I'd be all over that device. I'd buy that.

25:11.000 --> 25:13.440
Well, you might buy it, but you wouldn't use it very long.

25:13.440 --> 25:17.200
I think I would on the weekends. It'd be like my weekend phone, Joe. I'd be that guy.

25:17.200 --> 25:22.400
I'm telling you, man. I used it for a day or two and it was so frustrating.

25:22.400 --> 25:24.280
Wow. Okay.

25:24.280 --> 25:28.520
You don't realize how dependent you are on a proper smartphone until you try and use

25:28.520 --> 25:32.720
one of these. Fair enough, if you live in a country, you don't have much money and this

25:32.720 --> 25:37.760
is all you've got available to you, then it's way better than nothing, but we are very spoiled

25:37.760 --> 25:42.880
by Android phones and iPhones and everything. I'm telling you, you would not enjoy using

25:42.880 --> 25:43.880
it.

25:43.880 --> 25:48.800
Okay, fair point because here's what I just started thinking about was I think I'm romanticizing

25:48.800 --> 25:55.160
the good old days of my cell phones because I do the same thing with my computers. Now,

25:55.160 --> 26:00.920
in 2019, if the internet goes out, my computer is like freaking worthless. I can poke around

26:00.920 --> 26:04.960
on it for a while, but I can't install software. I can't update my games. I can't really do

26:04.960 --> 26:08.660
anything. It's kind of, without the internet, it's kind of worthless and I imagine that's

26:08.660 --> 26:10.920
kind of what one of those phones would sort of feel like.

26:10.920 --> 26:11.920
Yeah, pretty much.

26:11.920 --> 26:18.040
Well, rounding out the news this week is something from GitHub. They have announced GitHub Sponsors,

26:18.040 --> 26:20.880
which they say is a new way to contribute to open source.

26:20.880 --> 26:26.280
Yeah, not content with trying to own the whole developer space in terms of code. Now, Microsoft

26:26.280 --> 26:30.680
wants to get involved with how people get paid for open source, which is a very cynical

26:30.680 --> 26:37.560
way to look at what is ultimately potentially a great new revenue stream from source developers,

26:37.560 --> 26:39.880
but I'm going to be cynical nonetheless.

26:39.880 --> 26:44.360
There's always an angle. There is always an angle. Even when they do something pretty

26:44.360 --> 26:49.280
remarkable, at least for the first year, they've done a couple of things that are pretty remarkable.

26:49.280 --> 26:57.560
No fees, so everything goes 100% goes to the developer and they're matching up to 5,000

26:57.560 --> 27:04.520
per sponsor developer in the first year. I love how it's beyond gracious. It's more generous

27:04.520 --> 27:09.400
than any other model out there, anything Patreon could hope to do, and yet people are still

27:09.400 --> 27:13.300
very skeptical. I guess stay skeptical. It's healthy, everybody.

27:13.300 --> 27:16.760
The basics of how this thing is going to work is anyone with a GitHub account can sponsor

27:16.760 --> 27:22.480
anyone with a, quote, sponsor developer profile through a recurring monthly payment. You can

27:22.480 --> 27:26.320
choose different sponsorship tiers and different monthly amounts with benefits that are set

27:26.320 --> 27:32.160
by that sponsor developer. Your sponsorship shares your existing billing date and payment

27:32.160 --> 27:34.880
method information that you might already have in your GitHub account.

27:34.880 --> 27:39.760
Now right now, today, this is kind of like a future thing. There's a very small number

27:39.760 --> 27:44.160
of sponsor developers that are currently participating in what they call a limited

27:44.160 --> 27:50.820
beta. Eventually, the goal is anyone who contributes to an open source project is eligible to become

27:50.820 --> 27:53.480
a sponsor developer in the future.

27:53.480 --> 27:57.800
We're not trying to completely control things here because it's really easy to just add

27:57.800 --> 28:04.480
a YAML file to your GitHub that has the various places that you want to be supported. Patreon

28:04.480 --> 28:09.400
is one of the supported places, as well as the community bridge, which we've talked about

28:09.400 --> 28:13.800
before from the Linux Foundation. It's not open source, but yeah, well, let's cross over

28:13.800 --> 28:21.240
that. It's not purely a GitHub thing, which is nice to see. Clearly, they want to centralize

28:21.240 --> 28:28.020
it around GitHub, but they are giving other options there. Maybe I'm being cynical just

28:28.020 --> 28:35.760
for the sake of it, just to kind of play up to my role, but I do have to wonder what Microsoft's

28:35.760 --> 28:40.860
end game is, what's in it for them. Maybe it's just good PR for them, and good PR is

28:40.860 --> 28:43.040
always good for any company.

28:43.040 --> 28:47.360
Maybe. Or maybe this has nothing to do with Microsoft. Maybe this is just something the

28:47.360 --> 28:52.480
folks in GitHub saw an opportunity to do. Who knows, really? That's probably a little

28:52.480 --> 28:58.680
naive, but we don't really know the full story. Perhaps we can look into it. Right now, I

28:58.680 --> 29:02.600
think they're really only taking sponsorships too from individuals, which feels like it's

29:02.600 --> 29:09.240
good. That's a good start, but it's not really going to change anybody's life, and that's

29:09.240 --> 29:12.920
why I'm not like buying into this whole like it's a way to take over the finance of open

29:12.920 --> 29:16.500
source. Let's not kid ourselves here. This is going to be coffee and pizza money for

29:16.500 --> 29:22.560
these people. We're not talking like wages here. Now, if GitHub came up with a way to

29:22.560 --> 29:28.480
entice companies to invest part of their marketing budget into developers so that that way the

29:28.480 --> 29:35.040
company got some sort of public recognition for supporting open source, then you could

29:35.040 --> 29:41.460
change things because individuals can't contribute a lot, but even companies with not a lot of

29:41.460 --> 29:47.280
money to donate generally have a lot of money in the marketing budget. If you can get ahead

29:47.280 --> 29:51.120
of them and it becomes a common practice to sponsor open source projects where there's

29:51.120 --> 29:55.400
some sort of... There would have to be a return on investment that everybody's comfortable

29:55.400 --> 29:59.600
with, but then we'd start seeing serious money come into the system. Then I would probably

29:59.600 --> 30:03.040
buy it's the conspiracy to change funding of open source because that would actually

30:03.040 --> 30:07.160
make a difference, but until something like that comes along, this is coffee money for

30:07.160 --> 30:13.160
folks and it's really good to see it. I'll probably participate because hell, if I can

30:13.160 --> 30:17.200
at least get somebody a coffee or a beer, at least that's something, but we're not changing

30:17.200 --> 30:18.200
lives here yet.

30:18.200 --> 30:22.320
Well, not yet, but I'm sure that's the plan long term and whether that does mean proper

30:22.320 --> 30:26.880
corporate sponsorship or just individuals remains to be seen. It's very early days for

30:26.880 --> 30:28.160
this as we said.

30:28.160 --> 30:32.100
As they say, Joe, but we'll keep our ears to the ground and learn more as this thing

30:32.100 --> 30:37.120
develops because it's brand new right now, but your Jupiter Broadcasting team is on it.

30:37.120 --> 30:41.800
Just like we're on all of the stories in Linux and the open source world every single week

30:41.800 --> 30:46.400
and you can get this here show at linuxactionnews.com slash subscribe, which has all the different

30:46.400 --> 30:48.040
ways to get new episodes.

30:48.040 --> 30:52.000

We have a lot going on like Texas Linux Fest next weekend. You can stay up to date with

30:55.740 --> 31:00.560

31:00.560 --> 31:04.280
We'll be back next Monday with our weekly take on the latest Linux and open source news.

31:04.280 --> 31:05.940
I'm at Chris LAS.
