00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,280
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, our weekly take on Linux and the open source world.

2
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:19,920
This is episode 70, recorded on September 8th, 2018.

3
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:20,920
I'm Joe.

4
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:21,920
And I'm Wes.

5
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:22,920
Hello, Wes.

6
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:25,080
Thank you very much for joining me again while the boss is still away.

7
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:26,880
He's back soon, don't worry.

8
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:31,200
But let's get straight on with it and talk about GNOME 3.30 that's being released.

9
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:33,840
I understand that you've actually managed to get this going on Arch.

10
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:36,960
Yes, of course, it's already available in testing.

11
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:41,800
I'm sure it'll be released into the main repository sometime very soon.

12
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:44,940
Until then, you can go install it if you want or go install it on some of the other places

13
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:46,360
that have it available.

14
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:50,600
If you like GNOME already, it's just more of the same stuff you already love.

15
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:54,040
Unfortunately, I wasn't able to try this out because I'm not going to the lengths of

16
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:57,520
installing Arch, even Antigos, no, thank you very much.

17
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:02,460
But what I've done traditionally is download the live CD, which was based on Debian and

18
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:04,760
previous releases had that but there wasn't one for this.

19
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:08,760
So unfortunately, it's just screenshots and descriptions for me.

20
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:11,040
But it's a fairly big deal.

21
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:17,280
They talk about it being six months of hard work and nearly 25,000 changes by over 800

22
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:18,280
contributors.

23
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:19,840
So it's a fairly big deal.

24
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:20,840
Absolutely.

25
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:25,080
One of the things I'm really excited about is the new Thunderbolt panel to manage devices

26
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:27,080
and it dynamically shows hardware.

27
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:30,840
I'll just show you stuff when you need to know it and it's not there when you don't.

28
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:31,840
Super streamlined.

29
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:35,200
And I don't know about you, Joe, but I have more and more Thunderbolt peripherals all

30
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:36,200
the time.

31
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:37,440
I don't think I have any Thunderbolt peripherals.

32
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:39,240
Well, you're behind the times, Joe.

33
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:40,240
Come on now.

34
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:43,260
I know I need to get myself sorted with that.

35
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:46,640
But one thing I noticed about this release announcement, you think of GNOME and you think

36
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:52,200
about free software rather than open source, you think of GNU and, you know, copyleft and

37
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:54,440
very much the freedom side of things.

38
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:57,440
And you don't necessarily associate that with pragmatism.

39
00:01:57,440 --> 00:02:03,540
But Boxes, which is their virtual machine application, can now connect to remote Windows

40
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:08,520
servers using RDP, which, yeah, I mean, it's all free software that's running it.

41
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:11,880
But it shows a real kind of pragmatic approach there, doesn't it?

42
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:14,760
Yeah, that's probably a real world use case people have.

43
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:19,840
And it's not directly related to running, you know, VMs, open source or free software

44
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:23,000
VMs on your local workstation whatsoever.

45
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,720
But it might be one of those helpful tools that means you can run free software on your

46
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:30,560
workstation and still do a lot of your day job.

47
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:33,080
Another thing I noticed is they've got a podcast app now.

48
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:37,040
And in the screenshot for this, I noticed a few podcasts that I recognized.

49
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,040
Late Night Linux.

50
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:39,040
Hmm, I think that's quite good.

51
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:41,080
Ubuntu podcasts, that's not bad.

52
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:43,160
Destination Linux.

53
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:45,720
But no Ubuntu broadcasting stuff, what's going on, guys?

54
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:51,200
I am confused and outraged, but I'm also a little excited about this new app.

55
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:54,140
Do you listen to many podcasts on your desktop?

56
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:56,800
Because for me, it's very much a phone based activity for me.

57
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,840
I would say it's about half and half.

58
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:03,540
I also end up playing a lot of podcasts through my TV slash sound system, but I control that

59
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:05,640
primarily through my desktop.

60
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:07,400
Phone is really only used in the car.

61
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:08,920
Okay, fair enough.

62
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:11,960
It's good to have it baked right into the desktop, though, so you know that you're going

63
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:18,440
to have proper integration with the volume control and skipping tracks and everything.

64
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:21,760
So yeah, I could see myself using this if I was using GNOME, definitely.

65
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:25,800
Right, I don't expect it to be the most full featured podcast client or anything close

66
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:29,600
to it, but if you just want something that's simple, works, and makes it easy right after

67
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:34,740
installation to get going and start listening again to your favorite shows, this is a hit.

68
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:37,240
Another thing, even more games.

69
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:38,880
Games the retro gaming application.

70
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:43,280
I can't say I'm have much time for that these days, but what about you?

71
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,840
Are you tempted by this?

72
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:45,960
Yes, I am.

73
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,880
It looks pretty neat.

74
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:51,700
And there's the Flatpak bundle now includes four more emulator cores.

75
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:56,480
So there's even a larger collection than they had before, which is already pretty significant.

76
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:59,300
This is about the only gaming I do have time for.

77
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:02,820
Some of these are classics that many of us have been playing for years.

78
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:06,680
And it's great that again, you know, you think about free software on the GNOME desktop,

79
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:11,040
but this is another pragmatic use case, maybe not for business applications, but for that

80
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,640
all important leisure time.

81
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:14,160
Well, you mentioned Flatpak there.

82
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:18,640
And we talked a few episodes ago about Flatpak reaching 1.0.

83
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:21,520
And of course, that is in this version of GNOME.

84
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:24,540
So you've got proper stable Flatpaks now, it's a first class citizen.

85
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:25,540
It's about time.

86
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:28,400
I think there's a lot of us in the community that's been playing with Flatpaks.

87
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:32,880
But this is a milestone release, and it means it's going to be a significant part of future

88
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,600
desktops to come.

89
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:36,240
What about stability then?

90
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:42,460
GNOME, one of the criticisms that I hear often leveled at it is that it tends to crash quite

91
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:43,960
a lot.

92
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:45,920
Any improvements there that you've noticed?

93
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:48,880
You know, I really haven't used it enough to see that.

94
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:52,280
At least on my simple systems, you know, not anything I'm using as a desktop replacement

95
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:56,720
or a real workstation powerhouse, GNOME has been rock solid for me.

96
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:00,680
So I think it's really only when you stress it out at workloads, maybe they're not really

97
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:04,880
thinking of or are a little unfortunately beyond the architecture at this point that

98
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:09,880
I've seen problems, and I just haven't evaluated 3.30 on that type of system yet.

99
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:13,920
I remember the OBS machine crashing quite a lot in the studio.

100
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:17,200
I suppose that's an example of stressing it quite a lot.

101
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:22,400
So yeah, it'd be good to see if this has become less crashy, because that seems to be the

102
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:25,560
primary criticism that people level at it.

103
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:29,280
And it's absolutely a feature you need in a desktop you're going to use for anything

104
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:30,280
serious.

105
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:33,200
Well, any serious web browsing you're going to do, surely you're going to use the Tor

106
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,200
browser.

107
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,200
Well, of course.

108
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:38,320
I mean, I don't want people spying on what I'm doing on the internet, Joe.

109
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:41,120
You don't want to see that.

110
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:45,920
So yeah, Tor browser 8.0 has been released, the first stable release based on Firefox

111
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,960
6D ESR.

112
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:49,440
And I've tried this out.

113
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:53,360
And it is actually an improvement over the previous version, I must say.

114
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:56,340
They talk a lot about their new onboarding experience.

115
00:05:56,340 --> 00:05:57,340
Did you go through that?

116
00:05:57,340 --> 00:05:58,340
I did.

117
00:05:58,340 --> 00:06:02,080
And that's what really impressed me with it, because there has been a bit of a barrier

118
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:06,960
to entry because, okay, I understand how it all works with the onion routing.

119
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:10,560
And you know, I understand about the relays and everything, but the average person who

120
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:14,520
just wants to browse privately might not necessarily know that.

121
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:18,800
And it lays it out in really clear terms about what exactly is happening in this kind of

122
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,520
first run wizard.

123
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:23,040
And you kind of go through it step by step.

124
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:27,200
And so yes, I think that they are right to put that front and center in this release

125
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,200
announcement.

126
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:32,400
And it goes a long way to some of their goals and making this sort of technology available

127
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,800
for anyone, not just computer experts.

128
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:35,800
Well, yeah.

129
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:38,360
And to that end, they've improved the language support as well.

130
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:43,640
They've added Catalan, Irish, Indonesian, Icelandic, Norwegian, Danish, Hebrew, Swedish

131
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:45,280
and traditional Chinese.

132
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:48,720
They already had a fair few languages, so it's good to see them expanding that.

133
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,680
An admirable goal for sure.

134
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:53,600
Now it's not all roses here.

135
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:57,680
WebGL is broken, for instance, and there are some rumors, there's some problems if you're

136
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,120
using Mac OS.

137
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:04,160
So make sure you go try maybe the latest alpha they've got with those issues fixed.

138
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,160
What's Mac OS, Wes?

139
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:07,200
I wouldn't understand about that sort of thing.

140
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:10,280
But the WebGL thing, that's kind of a big deal, isn't it?

141
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:14,240
You know, it just might mean any sort of problem like that is one use case where you have to

142
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,000
go explore another option.

143
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,920
Either you're setting up Tor manually, which takes a lot more work and knowledge, or you're

144
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:23,480
just using a less secure and anonymous browser.

145
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:25,480
Either way, it's not something you probably want to do.

146
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:27,840
Hopefully they can get that fixed in an upcoming release.

147
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:32,480
Now they've done a lot with the onboarding, and they've made this a very slick experience,

148
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:35,700
except for when you actually try and browse the web with it.

149
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:38,000
And that's not their fault at all.

150
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,840
They've done everything they can.

151
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:43,800
But the problem is that a lot of websites don't want you to be anonymous.

152
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:48,480
They don't want you to use Tor, and so they make it almost impossible to actually interact

153
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:50,000
with their sites.

154
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,960
You have these endless capture loops.

155
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:56,360
I tried with one website, and it just kept going round and round, wanting me to do buses

156
00:07:56,360 --> 00:08:01,500
and traffic lights, and just would not let me do what I wanted to do.

157
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:03,040
And it's not Tor's fault.

158
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:08,080
It's the rest of the web, but that doesn't make it any more usable on a day-to-day basis.

159
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:09,080
That's disappointing.

160
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:14,120
I know Cloudflare in particular is a company people are often upset about for those horrible

161
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:15,120
captures.

162
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:20,400
Unfortunately, yes, that is the real world, but if they can't solve that problem, they've

163
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:24,060
gone a long way to solving a lot of others, and it's getting to the point I could actually

164
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:28,420
recommend this to some people out there and think that they could actually use it without

165
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:30,720
me having to hold their hand through the entire process.

166
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:31,720
Oh, definitely.

167
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:32,720
Yeah.

168
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:35,840
And there are certainly some websites which work absolutely perfectly with it.

169
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:40,720
I tried out the podcast sites of the various shows I'm on, and you can play those episodes,

170
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:42,080
no problem.

171
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:47,840
But it's just the kind of more complicated interactive sites that want to scrape your

172
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:53,400
data that are not going to work, and, well, it's not a surprise, is it?

173
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:59,680
But they've also, the Tor project, released an alpha of a Tor browser for Android, which

174
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:03,640
is available on the Play Store, and you can download an APK directly.

175
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:08,900
When we recorded this, it didn't seem to be available on F-Droid, hopefully soon.

176
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:13,920
But you should know that this is really just a rebranding and a bringing in-house of the

177
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:18,600
project known as Orfox, which is built from the same source code as the main Tor browser,

178
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:21,760
which is, of course, itself based on Firefox.

179
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:26,440
That project, Orfox, has been developed by the software collective The Guardian Project.

180
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:32,400
Now that we've got the official version coming out in alpha, well, Orfox is kind of winding

181
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:35,600
down in the future, just look for the Tor browser itself.

182
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:39,680
Yeah, I think that's going to make it much simpler, because I have looked for the Tor

183
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:44,160
browser before and found this Orfox thing and thought, do I trust this?

184
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:49,640
If it's coming from the Tor project directly, it's called the Tor browser, I think it just

185
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:55,320
clears up any confusion there and just makes it, again, an easier onboarding experience.

186
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:56,320
Yeah, absolutely.

187
00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:01,200
The Android app, in this case, also features some tracker blocking tools to help just improve

188
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:04,680
isolation from every website that you visit, so that's a nice tip.

189
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:08,600
Yeah, and it works in very much the same way as Firefox on Android, because, well, that's

190
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:09,600
what it's based on.

191
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:13,720
If you're used to using Firefox, then it's not a huge transition to use a Tor browser.

192
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:14,720
Exactly.

193
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:18,280
Now, to actually connect to the Tor network with the Tor browser, you do need one more

194
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:23,040
application and that's The Guardian Project's Orbot, which actually connects you to the

195
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:26,740
Tor network and enables all of those awesome features.

196
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:31,180
That sounds like a lot, but don't worry, Tor Project's already working on bringing that

197
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:33,740
functionality into the new browser app.

198
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:35,560
Look for that sometime in the future.

199
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:38,680
Well, sometime in the future, we're not even going to be using Android, are we?

200
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:40,960
We're going to be using PureOS on the Librem 5.

201
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:43,520
Oh, I certainly hope so.

202
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:48,560
Unfortunately, there's some news that, well, we might have to wait a little bit longer.

203
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:54,080
Yeah, they had originally planned to ship this phone in January of 2019, but now it

204
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:59,000
looks like it's going to be April, or at least that's what they're estimating at the moment.

205
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:03,080
And they say, with all the advancements Purism is making with hardware, software, development

206
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:09,400
kits and services, during testing two silicon bugs were discovered in the Librem 5 CPU that

207
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:13,360
affect power management and power consumption.

208
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:17,920
And so, three months delay in production, unfortunately, but at least they're being

209
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:21,240
honest about this and are being realistic.

210
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:26,520
And they're trying to achieve some goals that really no one else is working that actively

211
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:27,520
on right now.

212
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:29,800
So the supply chains aren't optimized for it.

213
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:31,940
There's a lot of gotchas that are happening.

214
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:36,280
And of course, sort of in the middle of all of this, there was a bit of a system on a

215
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:39,160
chip shift to use a newer version.

216
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:40,400
There's some problems there.

217
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:45,480
It sounds like if you use this with the current flaws, your phone would be dead in about an

218
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:47,200
hour's worth of use.

219
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:50,280
I don't know about you, Joe, that's not really going to make it happen for me in the real

220
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:51,280
world.

221
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:53,080
No, unfortunately not.

222
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:57,280
So they did a press release about this, which kind of buried the lead, I think.

223
00:11:57,280 --> 00:12:00,720
And they were kind of talking about how great it is and everything.

224
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:05,600
But there is a link within that press release to a more technical blog post.

225
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:12,320
And in that, they explain why they decided to move from the original IMX6 to the IMX8.

226
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:19,480
And they talk about it being 64-bit with more GPUs and lower power consumption, and just

227
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:22,600
generally being a much better system on a chip.

228
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:27,560
But in deciding to move to that rather than the IMX6, which they kind of based their plans

229
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:30,880
on, they had to do some QA and testing.

230
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:35,080
And sure enough, that brought up this issue about the power management.

231
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:39,000
You know, it does seem like they're doing a pretty thorough job of both being transparent

232
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,360
and being realistic.

233
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:45,000
You know, some of this might happen earlier, but they just needed a hard date internally

234
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
to plan around.

235
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,520
I can certainly understand that.

236
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:52,780
Plus, there is the normal sort of Western world holiday season coming up and Chinese

237
00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:53,780
New Year.

238
00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:58,120
It's a lot of time that can just cause supply problems, so aiming for sometime in the spring

239
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:00,880
of next year seems like a doable goal.

240
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:04,780
And they say that they're going to start shipping the dev kits in October, but they do caveat

241
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:08,000
that with barring any unforeseen issues.

242
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:13,200
Now that is four months behind the original schedule, because thanks to archive.org, I

243
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:18,720
saw the original crowdfunding page when there was only $1,000 being pledged of the $2 million

244
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:19,720
I think they got.

245
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:22,000
So it was a very early snapshot.

246
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:26,640
And it says on that that the dev kits will be shipping in June.

247
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:29,740
And well, June has long come and gone.

248
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:32,940
And so now they're saying October, but they talk about in this blog post that it's going

249
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:34,560
to be on schedule, these dev kits.

250
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:40,080
So they're obviously talking about a revised schedule that it's now sticking to.

251
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:45,480
But they also say that the dev kits will ship with this hardware bug because the dev kits

252
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:49,240
are not designed to be run off batteries, they're designed to be plugged in, run off

253
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:52,920
the mains, so it doesn't matter that there are power management issues.

254
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:57,160
So that does make it seem more realistic that we'll see them in October, because October's

255
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:58,440
not very long, is it?

256
00:13:58,440 --> 00:13:59,440
No, that's coming up.

257
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:02,200
I mean, that's just next month.

258
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:06,840
But that would be a good way to get that pipeline going, get developers actually working on

259
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:11,240
testing, building, making sure all the software is going to run really well once there's actual

260
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:12,240
shippable units.

261
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:15,680
Although, you know, there is another bit of a red flag in here.

262
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:20,640
And that is they say the phone design schematics are pretty much complete.

263
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:21,760
Pretty much complete.

264
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:25,300
And we've been busy focusing on putting the device together.

265
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:28,480
There are some missing pieces like the modem that needs to be incorporated.

266
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:31,720
But other than that, there are currently no showstopping issues in regards to manufacturing

267
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:32,720
the phone.

268
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:33,720
Really?

269
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:37,720
The modem is probably the most important, right?

270
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:39,200
That's the whole thing?

271
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,200
Yeah.

272
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:44,840
And just even the case, if you don't know exactly what components are going where, and

273
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:52,180
you are still finalizing it, then surely they can't be ready to fab the cases yet, which

274
00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:58,720
is, okay, it's a fairly minor part of it, but you would hope that they would have that

275
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:00,760
ready at this stage.

276
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:04,520
I just hope that they get it together soon because we really need this.

277
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:10,080
And you know, we've been following this on this show on Linux Unplugged on, you know,

278
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:14,040
the whole Linux community has been following this, because we just really want this to

279
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:15,040
happen.

280
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:17,520
But it's just so difficult, isn't it?

281
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:20,360
The last great free software phone hope.

282
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:21,440
It is really hard.

283
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:22,560
It is worth doing.

284
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:25,480
And I guess we also have to make sure we manage our expectations.

285
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:29,320
You know, this is not going to be like an iPhone right out of the gate.

286
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:33,560
But if we can get to the point of a usable phone you can use in your everyday life and

287
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:38,680
respects a lot of the freedoms and philosophies that we hold dear, that would be a game changer.

288
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:43,280
Well, we'll definitely keep reporting on this one right up until it gets released and beyond

289
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:47,400
whether that is indeed in April next year or whether it gets pushed back again.

290
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:49,560
We'll have to see.

291
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:54,240
But going back to Android, I saw this week that CompuLab have announced their device

292
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:58,640
called Wild, which is Wi-Fi indoor location device.

293
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:06,840
And this is the first Wi-Fi RTT access point that allows for Wi-Fi indoor location detection

294
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:09,960
and tracking as long as you've got an Android 9 smartphone.

295
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:13,020
Now Wi-Fi RTT is round trip time.

296
00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:15,920
This is some seriously interesting technology.

297
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:22,020
You know, at first it sounded a little creepy to me, but you can imagine a ton of real world

298
00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:23,020
use cases.

299
00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:27,400
I especially see this being used at really large campuses or even just middle sized buildings

300
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:32,080
where you have a large number of APs to do triangulation with and where you might need

301
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:36,400
some assistance navigating or it could just be useful to know where people are, how to

302
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:41,100
get them and then perhaps even also navigating autonomous devices within a building like

303
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:42,100
that.

304
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:45,960
I don't know when the last time you visited a large hospital was, but that is a nightmare

305
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:52,200
trying to find the right place and being able to triangulate your location and get turn

306
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:55,580
by turn directions would be amazing for that.

307
00:16:55,580 --> 00:16:58,680
Now this Wi-Fi round trip time is really interesting.

308
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:01,020
It's such a simple concept.

309
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:06,120
It's just the time it takes for an access point to ping your device and back.

310
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:10,960
But then if you have at least three of them, you can triangulate where that person is down

311
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:15,120
to apparently under 0.5 meters, which I think is about a foot and a half.

312
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:20,520
It's really impressive and is kind of an ingenious use of information we already had available

313
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:24,400
and with just honestly some high school math, you can put this all together if you have

314
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:26,360
all that available to you.

315
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:28,800
Plus there's been some design with security in mind.

316
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:32,360
So the AP doesn't get to know that location, right?

317
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:41,280
Your phone can infer it through the protocol 802.11mc, which is the Wi-Fi RTT spec, but

318
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:45,000
you don't have to worry that everyone else on the network is also spying on you.

319
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:49,440
So this particular bit of hardware is familiar to me.

320
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:52,600
When I saw the photo of it, I thought, hang on, that looks familiar.

321
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:58,000
And sure enough, it's the same hardware as the Mint Box Mini 2, which is a little fanless

322
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:05,520
PC, basically, passively called, seems ideal for this purpose.

323
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:09,760
And they talk about it running the latest GNU slash Linux Debian, including KDE and

324
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:11,560
standard package management.

325
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:14,640
I don't know why you'd need a GUI on this, but hey, who cares?

326
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,000
KDE is nice.

327
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:21,440
And they also say that their drivers and utilities will be open source.

328
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:26,040
Now there's no mention of where that code actually is and what license it is.

329
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:28,120
So I'm a little bit skeptical about that.

330
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:34,200
But if they do deliver on their promise of open sourcing that, this is really great because

331
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:39,840
if you're going to have this kind of tracking, then it needs to all be open source.

332
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:44,680
You can't have proprietary stuff in there because then nefarious things can happen.

333
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:48,520
I would be much more comfortable using a system like this, knowing that it was open source,

334
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:53,920
knowing that we can audit the code, knowing that it's not just going to get sold that

335
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:54,920
data.

336
00:18:54,920 --> 00:19:00,000
But using a public specification, open source implementations dominating the market.

337
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:04,160
That's a world I can get behind and actually trust that it might not be abused.

338
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:06,480
And this is not ridiculously expensive either.

339
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:12,040
They talk about it being $175 for a barebone unit, if you order in volume.

340
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:15,640
And let's face it, to do this, you're going to have to order in volume because there's

341
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:20,000
no point in a small place, you're going to need 20 or 30 of these at least to make it

342
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
worthwhile.

343
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,440
Right, you're not putting this in your house, you're putting it in a hospital or a large

344
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:27,000
tech organization campus or an office building.

345
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,640
Yeah, or a museum or something like that.

346
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:33,520
And for $175 per access point, I mean, that's pretty competitive, isn't it?

347
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:34,520
Absolutely.

348
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:38,520
And you know, there's enterprise access points that already go for a lot more than that.

349
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:39,520
Yeah.

350
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:44,080
So I'm skeptical at this point, I do want to see that they follow through on publishing

351
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:45,080
the source code.

352
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:47,160
But this is definitely one to watch.

353
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:51,760
Now one that I was watching for not very long at all was spec being introduced into the

354
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:54,700
kernel, which came in in 4.17.

355
00:19:54,700 --> 00:20:00,040
But now it looks like in 4.20, it's going to be removed already.

356
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:01,760
This is an unusual case.

357
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:05,800
And there's really a large number of ways to read this story.

358
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:11,320
Google had been pushing for the NSA's spec algorithm for use on some of its lower end

359
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:15,480
mobile phones that just didn't have hardware implementations for things like AES.

360
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:22,080
So they wanted a faster, but also at a cost of being faster, less robust encryption algorithm.

361
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:26,920
Now, of course, there was pushback and spec was actually ultimately rejected by the ISO

362
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:27,920
as a standard.

363
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:32,560
Nevertheless, with Google's backing, it made it into the 4.17 kernel.

364
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:37,180
Google turns out, well, they've decided to go another way without their backing.

365
00:20:37,180 --> 00:20:38,180
Out it goes.

366
00:20:38,180 --> 00:20:40,000
Now, there is a bit of confusion here, isn't there?

367
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:45,680
Because Google didn't necessarily have to use spec for its lower end hardware version

368
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:46,680
of Android.

369
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:48,560
They could have used an alternative.

370
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:54,760
Yeah, so they've actually ended up going with XCHA CHA, which is a descendant of the CHA

371
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:58,440
CHA algorithm already implemented in Chrome.

372
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:05,240
And the construction they've chose to use, HPoly C, is faster than spec was and more

373
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:06,240
secure.

374
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:11,080
So this leads to some serious conspiracy baking being fired up here because if spec was technically

375
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:14,880
inferior, why were they pushing so hard to include it in the kernel?

376
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:18,280
If not, because of pressure from three letter agencies?

377
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:23,000
Yeah, you do have to wonder like, were the technical justifications, did they ever make

378
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
sense?

379
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:29,080
It also says some things I think about both the power Google has within the kernel community

380
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:34,280
and just how it functions as a thriving open source, back and forth discussion that we

381
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:39,600
saw put in, we saw it removed so quickly, and I guess we just steamroll ahead and move

382
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:40,600
on with our lives?

383
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:45,320
Well, when it was introduced, there was, of course, the option not to actually include

384
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:50,880
it when you compile the kernel, and I suspect that a lot of people will have been doing

385
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:51,880
that.

386
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:56,400
Whereas now, it looks like that's not going to be a problem for them, although it did

387
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:59,480
make it into 4.19, which is an LTS kernel.

388
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:04,360
So I suppose those distro maintainers are going to have that difficult choice to make,

389
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:05,760
do they include it or not?

390
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:10,420
I will say it does at least make me glad that instead of just adding a proprietary encryption

391
00:22:10,420 --> 00:22:15,500
method into the Android or into Play Store or something like that, we do get to see all

392
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:20,080
of this taking shape in the open source sphere on the mailing list, and then we get to blather

393
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:21,080
about it here.

394
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:25,960
Well, let's end with a fun or strange story, I suppose, and that's about the kernel maintainer

395
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:31,080
summit, which was scheduled to be in Canada, but now it's going to be in Scotland.

396
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:32,440
So they've moved continents.

397
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:33,440
Why?

398
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:38,760
Well, because Linus got the date and location wrong and was going to be on holiday in Scotland.

399
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:40,560
So let's just move over there.

400
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:41,560
Wow.

401
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:45,200
You know, they explored a bunch of options here, kind of in the scramble of what are

402
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:46,200
we going to do?

403
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:48,660
Linus is a rather important maintainer.

404
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:54,840
Option one, keep the summit in Vancouver and have it without Linus, or move the maintainer

405
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:58,160
summit to Edinburgh with Linus.

406
00:22:58,160 --> 00:23:00,320
Strangely enough, Linus was totally okay missing it.

407
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:02,600
He suggested option number one.

408
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:05,480
But it was ultimately decided that he's too important.

409
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:09,840
And that kind of tells you a lot, doesn't it, about, you know, he is the benevolent

410
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:15,880
dictator or whatever, but he really is just the linchpin of this whole operation.

411
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:17,040
He absolutely is.

412
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:21,060
And just to make it clear, if we both are not familiar, the focus of the maintainer

413
00:23:21,060 --> 00:23:25,640
summit is really on process and development issues and not technical issues.

414
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:28,020
There's also the Colonel Plummer's conference.

415
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:31,540
There's a number of other summits and conferences that happen that all those other things get

416
00:23:31,540 --> 00:23:32,540
hashed out.

417
00:23:32,540 --> 00:23:36,920
So it might just be an extra trip to Scotland for those lucky few invited to the maintainer

418
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:37,920
summit.

419
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:39,260
Well, Scotland is absolutely delightful.

420
00:23:39,260 --> 00:23:44,320
So I'm sure they'll be pleased to fly all that way from the west coast of North America

421
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:47,960
all the way there to reigning Scotland.

422
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:53,200
It just seems very strange that this would happen, but that's how important he is.

423
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:54,200
Yeah.

424
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:57,880
I mean, I like the humility and, you know, I'm sure he's wanting to see them do this

425
00:23:57,880 --> 00:24:01,840
without him just as for own peace of mind's sake, I'm sure I would be.

426
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:06,280
But at the end of the day, we have the Colonel we have, we have the leader we have, and all

427
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:09,640
just keeps ticking along and have fun in Scotland, guys.

428
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:12,980
Well, there are plenty of stories on this episode that we'll be following and reporting

429
00:24:12,980 --> 00:24:13,980
