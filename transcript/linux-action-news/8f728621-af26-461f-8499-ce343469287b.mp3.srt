00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,240
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, our weekly take on Linux and the open-source world.

2
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:20,920
This is episode 17, recorded on September 3rd, 2017.

3
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:21,920
I'm Chris.

4
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:22,920
And I'm Tor.

5
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:23,920
Hello, Joe.

6
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:27,440
You know, often the saying goes, where there's smoke, there's fire.

7
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:32,040
And apparently, there's a little bit of fire in New York, because an Ubuntu rally is in

8
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:36,860
the works, taking place in New York City, September 25th through the 29th.

9
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:39,360
And it looks like it could be quite the festival.

10
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:44,780
Yeah, I had heard about this on the grapevine, but now it's all official.

11
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:51,960
It's basically an excuse to get people together to work on snaps and GNOME, by the looks of

12
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:52,960
things.

13
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:57,620
They're inviting all sorts of people, and rumor has it, paying for all sorts of people

14
00:00:57,620 --> 00:01:00,100
to go there and take part in this.

15
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:04,680
Very much like the last one that they had in London about a year ago, was it?

16
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:11,400
Yeah, they seem to be targeting application developers, IoT device manufacturers, and

17
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:17,480
PC OEMs who want to help set future direction goals in Ubuntu, or enable Ubuntu on their

18
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:18,480
hardware.

19
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:22,160
And also then a call out to active and passionate community members as well.

20
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:26,880
I take this as sort of the beginnings of a kind of a big canonical event.

21
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:28,920
And it's really downtown in New York City.

22
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:31,000
I think it's like at one of the Hyatt hotels there.

23
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,360
There's information in the show notes and also on the Ubuntu insights blog.

24
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:36,520
Are you going to make it, Joe?

25
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:37,880
No, unfortunately.

26
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:40,080
But my friend Ike is, by the looks of things.

27
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:41,080
Yeah, yeah.

28
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:44,400
Quite a few folks that we mentioned often on the show are going to be there.

29
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:45,640
And I'm going to try to make it myself.

30
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:46,640
I don't know how.

31
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,400
I'm doing all the travel math right now.

32
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:52,360
And you and I, of course, are going to have to figure out recording math, but I'm going

33
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:53,360
to try to make it.

34
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:54,680
I'm going to try to get there.

35
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:57,000
And I think this is going to be a big event.

36
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:03,360
There is a lot of momentum in different directions around Ubuntu 17.10, big changes around canonical.

37
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:05,440
And with Mark Shuttle, we're sort of taking the reins again.

38
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:08,600
And he's going to be really rallying this event, this Ubuntu rally.

39
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:09,640
I want to see that.

40
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:11,920
I want to come back, and I want to report on it for the show.

41
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:13,120
So I think I'm going to try to make it.

42
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,280
Well, that would be awesome if you could get there.

43
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,720
It's a long way away, though, isn't it?

44
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:17,720
Yeah.

45
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:18,720
It's a long way away.

46
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:21,760
And the timing and budget is not so lining up at the moment.

47
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:22,920
That's sort of a nice way to say it.

48
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:29,080
So I may end up just loading up in my truck and sleeping in my truck and just driving

49
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:33,080
there and grinding it out and then just figuring out where I'm going to stay and how I'm going

50
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:34,440
to make that work when I get there.

51
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:39,080
You probably know enough people across the US to kind of stay on some couches or something.

52
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:40,080
Maybe.

53
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,600
This is the first time I'm saying anything publicly about it.

54
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:45,480
So if anybody's going to be around the area of this event, maybe hit me up on Twitter

55
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:49,680
or Telegram at Chris Ellis, and let me know if you've got a couch available for me and

56
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:52,160
my lady because, yeah, we're going to pile in there and head out.

57
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:56,880
And I'm going to put feelers out there for other folks within JB and see if they want

58
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:57,880
to go.

59
00:02:57,880 --> 00:03:02,080
But right now, it's just the early stages of sort of a crazy plan because I think it's

60
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:04,000
going to be worth going.

61
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Yeah, definitely.

62
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:12,520
So 1710, speaking of Ubuntu, the beta 1 has come out, but not of the main flavor of Ubuntu

63
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:14,760
because they don't participate in beta 1.

64
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:24,280
So it's a lot of the flavors, Ubuntu Mate, Ubuntu Chillin, Lubuntu, Ubuntu Studio.

65
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:26,200
So it's our first glance.

66
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:30,280
When I first heard about it, I was quite excited because I thought it was going to be a milestone

67
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:31,560
for the main version.

68
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:34,700
But it looks like we're going to have to wait a little while for beta 2.

69
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:39,600
But looking at some of these flavors, specifically, the most interesting to me is actually Ubuntu

70
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:43,360
Chillin, which is spelled Kailin, but it's pronounced Chillin.

71
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,400
And that looks like Windows.

72
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:48,560
They've basically taken Mate and made it look like Windows.

73
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,540
And this is for the Chinese market.

74
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:55,120
So it's not a huge surprise, is it, that they wanted to make it look like Windows?

75
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,120
Indeed.

76
00:03:56,120 --> 00:04:01,660
Looking at this 1710 release, when you consider Ubuntu Chillin and the work that the Ubuntu

77
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:06,640
Mate project has been doing, that flavor, with their new heads up display, the improved

78
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:11,520
Super Key support that really nails it now, global menu improvements, and really getting

79
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:19,840
a pretty spot on implementation of Unity called Mutiny, this is all going to draw more and

80
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:21,640
more attention to this project.

81
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:29,960
I think Ubuntu 1710, the Chillin and Ubuntu Mate flavors, are representing sort of a milestone

82
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:34,980
for the Mate project, a milestone that is easy to miss.

83
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:40,720
But if you think about it, really indicates that this traditional desktop paradigm has

84
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,420
gotten traction.

85
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:44,440
And there's people using it.

86
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:50,300
And it is actually possible to take this traditional desktop paradigm and move it into modern computing.

87
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:52,280
And both these projects are bearing that out.

88
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:56,320
Yeah, not to mention Plasma 5 that's been trucking along with the traditional desktop

89
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,600
for years now.

90
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:58,600
Indeed, indeed, indeed.

91
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:04,480
In fact, speaking of the Plasma 5 release, Ubuntu 1710 will have KDE Plasma 5.10 and

92
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:06,780
will use Xorg by default.

93
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:08,640
Some of these flavors will be using Wayland.

94
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:11,340
This is an interesting division throughout Ubuntu now.

95
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:14,520
You'll have Ubuntu proper 1710 using Wayland by default.

96
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:18,320
But some flavors, like Kubuntu, will be using Xorg.

97
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:24,280
Yeah, and the XFCE version, Zubuntu, which is what I use, that just looks exactly the

98
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:25,280
same.

99
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:26,280
It's funny.

100
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:27,280
That's what I like, though.

101
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:28,280
Just how you like it, right, Joe?

102
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:29,280
Yeah.

103
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:30,280
Yeah, exactly.

104
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:32,800
Why change for its own sake, you know?

105
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,000
Yeah, why change at all?

106
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:39,080
Of course, Reddit's making big changes, and the headline change for our audience is not

107
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:40,760
so much more with the open source.

108
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:46,760
I mean, individual components, but you know, sort of that big core component, not so much.

109
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:52,520
Yeah, which is a shame, but the reality is that it hasn't been properly open source for

110
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:53,520
a long time.

111
00:05:53,520 --> 00:06:00,140
They've been very bad with the commits and keeping it all up to date on GitHub.

112
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:05,640
And so really, they're just formalizing their position, saying that they basically can't

113
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:12,760
be open source for numerous reasons, which are a little bit spurious, really, I think.

114
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:14,000
Yeah, I agree.

115
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,680
They say that it makes it hard for them to develop some features in the clear, like the

116
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,240
recent video launch.

117
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:24,520
Well, that doesn't mean that you can't do that Google style and throw it over the wall

118
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:25,520
when it's finished.

119
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:26,520
Yeah, exactly.

120
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:28,880
And they say, look, you know, we're big now.

121
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,280
People know about Reddit.

122
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:35,320
We're a player on the web, so it's hard for us to be strategic in our planning when everyone

123
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:39,100
can see the code we're committing.

124
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:42,840
That's got to be some weak of the weakest sauce right there.

125
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:46,160
There are so many ways around that, and that's their number one feature.

126
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:50,500
Now, here's a part I do understand, and this is their second bullet point.

127
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:54,680
Because of the above, our internal development production and feature branches have been

128
00:06:54,680 --> 00:07:00,480
moving further and further from canonical state of the open source repository.

129
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:05,880
Such balkanization means that merges are getting increasingly difficult, especially as the

130
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:11,760
company grows and more developers are touching the code more frequently.

131
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:15,800
That is a legitimate point there, especially if you are trying to be less and less open

132
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:16,800
source.

133
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:20,920
Well, yeah, it's funny that they say they basically only open sourced it in the first

134
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:26,240
place because they knew they were a small company, and they could go bust or whatever,

135
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:30,720
and they wanted to have it out there for the community should the community need to step

136
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,000
up and take it off them.

137
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,020
But now they're basically saying, oh, we're safe now.

138
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:35,020
We've got our business model.

139
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:36,200
We've been around long enough.

140
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:37,520
We don't need to be open source.

141
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:38,520
And it's really disappointing.

142
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:40,400
What do you think about this argument?

143
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,480
Because I could see this coming up more and more.

144
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:44,440
This could be a way of the future here.

145
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:50,140
They write, as we move towards a more service oriented architecture, Reddit is being divided

146
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:55,760
into many smaller repositories that are under active development.

147
00:07:55,760 --> 00:08:00,400
So it's sort of this we're rebuilding Reddit in individual components.

148
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:06,200
And as we do that, we're not really rewriting them as open source components.

149
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:07,600
But why not?

150
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:10,480
Why not just make them open source?

151
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:13,160
It just seems like a lot of very spurious arguments here.

152
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:17,760
I could see these last two arguments being used by other open source projects that want

153
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:18,760
to go closed source.

154
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:21,680
But they point out that they still believe, these are the terminologies they actually

155
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,400
use, we believe in open source.

156
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:26,840
And we want to make sure that our contributions are both useful and meaningful.

157
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:31,800
So we'll continue to open source tools that are of use to engineers everywhere.

158
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:33,440
And they include a couple of examples.

159
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:34,760
It's funny that turn of phrase, isn't it?

160
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:35,760
They believe in open source.

161
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,600
Yeah, they literally believe it exists.

162
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:41,200
Well, that doesn't really help if you're code proprietary, does it?

163
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,480
I believe in gravity, Joe.

164
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,880
I'm a strong believer in gravity.

165
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:48,840
Yeah, well, Reddit's just toxic anyway, isn't it?

166
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:49,840
That is true.

167
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:52,480
You know, really, perhaps it's time for something new to come along.

168
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:55,120
Because it's overall, it's a dumpster fire.

169
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:59,880
And what we really need, perhaps, is a petition, a change.org petition for the people.

170
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:03,200
Yeah, because petitions always succeed in their goals, don't they?

171
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,200
Yeah.

172
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,200
Well, this one actually did.

173
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:10,280
A petition that was started by a community member of Phoenix OS, which we've talked about

174
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:16,240
in the past on this show, launched a change.org petition to open source the kernel of Phoenix

175
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,520
OS.

176
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:20,520
But in this circumstance, it actually made a difference.

177
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:23,640
Yeah, so they were violating the GPL before.

178
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:29,120
And now they've released what looks like it's probably all of the source code, but we're

179
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,880
not 100% sure, are we?

180
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,480
Yeah, they're still trying to verify it.

181
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:35,320
So it seems like there's been an effort for the last couple of days.

182
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:36,720
I went all in on this, Joe.

183
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:37,720
I read facts.

184
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:40,560
I got involved in the Discord comments and community.

185
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:42,520
I spoke to one of the developers.

186
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:47,360
And there was this weird two-day period where they attempted to verify the source code.

187
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:51,400
I'm not sure why it took so long, but somebody came along and offered their services and

188
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:56,320
did at least verify that there are deviations from upstream Android kernel source.

189
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:59,600
OK, so it's probably the kernel from Phoenix OS then.

190
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:00,600
Yeah.

191
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:04,920
It sounds like there's more work to be done, including making it possible for the community

192
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:05,920
interact and all of this.

193
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:07,400
So there's still more work to be done.

194
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:12,960
The change.org petition has been updated now to reflect that things are still outstanding.

195
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:14,080
Yeah.

196
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:19,780
And Phoenix OS is kind of the last man standing, isn't it, in terms of desktop Android?

197
00:10:19,780 --> 00:10:21,120
That's why this matters.

198
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:26,200
And it is actually, as far as open source and Android is concerned, a fairly important

199
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,200
story.

200
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:31,320
And there's more to be done with Phoenix OS, including a ton of work on graphics cards

201
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:33,200
and Wi-Fi and Bluetooth.

202
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:38,080
So there's a ton of area here where the open source community could really contribute and

203
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:39,320
make this thing more viable.

204
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:40,320
Yeah.

205
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:44,280
And I'd like to see it more international because it feels very Eastern at the moment.

206
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:48,960
It's very kind of Chinese-focused with the apps that you've got pre-installed and stuff

207
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:49,960
in it.

208
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:51,720
It just doesn't feel like it's for me as a Westerner.

209
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:52,720
Yeah.

210
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:57,560
I could see maybe bringing in the open source community as a way of resolving that as well.

211
00:10:57,560 --> 00:11:01,860
But back to regular Android handsets, those of us that will just be using stock Android

212
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:04,160
may have a bit of a better time.

213
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:06,440
We've been stuck with old versions of kernels.

214
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:11,400
Google has never really cared what version of the kernel an OEM uses, as long as everything

215
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:12,400
works.

216
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:13,400
Yeah.

217
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:20,360
But now they're going to mandate 4.4 or later, which is quite a big jump because even my

218
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:26,520
OnePlus 3T running the latest lineage, 14.1, which is based on Android 7.1.

219
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:28,400
So I suppose it's not quite the latest.

220
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:30,920
But that is running a 3.18 kernel.

221
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:32,240
Mm.

222
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:33,720
Which is, that's ancient.

223
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:34,720
Yeah.

224
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:41,080
Well, starting now, Google is going to require, if you use Oreo, that your system on a chip

225
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:44,960
has to support a 4.4 kernel or newer, and you have to ship that.

226
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:48,880
And the really slick thing about that is, and this is going to have long-term actual

227
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:54,160
ramifications here as people start to roll this out, Project Treble is built into this

228
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:58,720
version of Android, which means it's going to be easier to upgrade that kernel down the

229
00:11:58,720 --> 00:11:59,720
road.

230
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:02,480
And this is a major news story for Android.

231
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:08,500
Once we get people on this baseline version of Android, and on this baseline kernel 4.4

232
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:14,720
or newer, we will be starting a path towards an x86-style ability to update your kernel

233
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:17,400
on your phone whenever there's an update coming up.

234
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:20,160
And that's going to be a game changer for Android.

235
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:26,000
I don't know if it's quite that level of x86, but it's certainly a damn sight better than

236
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
it is at the moment.

237
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
You're right.

238
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,800
And I'm going to overstate it because it's going to be a multi-year process to get there.

239
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:36,960
Because just getting handsets on a kernel 4.4 is going to take years.

240
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:41,240
Then there's going to be a transition period where OEMs start to wake up to the reality

241
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:45,480
that they can now swap out individual layers of Android without having to worry about breaking

242
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:46,940
their driver support.

243
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:51,200
Once that clicks in and they've updated their development process, then Android handsets

244
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,200
will start to benefit.

245
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,920
But that's years, Joe.

246
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:56,680
Well, they needed to do this, didn't they, Google?

247
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:59,960
The whole update thing, we've been talking about for years.

248
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:03,880
It's just broken, fundamentally broken, the way updates work on Android.

249
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:11,600
The fact that you've got people running version 4 and stuff, it's just absolutely ridiculous.

250
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:16,800
Whereas if you look at the other side of the fence with Apple, even six, seven-year-old

251
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:21,160
iPhones are running maybe one or two versions behind at most.

252
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:22,880
So it needed to happen.

253
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:27,920
And it's good to see that Google have finally made the changes that they need to make.

254
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:34,200
And it's going to take a while, but at least we'll get there.

255
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:36,000
Linux Academy dot com slash unplugged.

256
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:40,280
Go there to support the show, but also sign up for a free seven-day trial of a platform

257
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:44,760
designed to teach you everything about Linux with self-paced, in-depth video courses, hands-on

258
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:49,480
scenario-based labs, full-time human instructors that are happy to help when you need them.

259
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:54,080
And one of the things that I'm really appreciative of Linux Academy, you choose your Linux distribution

260
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:57,920
that adjusts the courseware and the virtual machines that they spin up on demand.

261
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:58,920
They all match.

262
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:02,600
So Debian or Red Hat, whatever is perfect for your work environment.

263
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:03,600
That's genius.

264
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:06,720
That's something that only a platform built by Linux enthusiasts would do.

265
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:09,040
They have practice exams that prepare you for certs.

266
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:12,680
They also have courseware that's really designed to focus on certifications, if that's your

267
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:13,680
current goal.

268
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:17,960
Or if you want to move into a new career track, they have learning paths for that as well.

269
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:19,960
Linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

270
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:25,200
Go there to support this show and sign up for a free trial for seven days.

271
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:28,400
Linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

272
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:34,460
Okay, let's talk about the essential phone.

273
00:14:34,460 --> 00:14:39,120
So Andy Rubin, the father of Android, announced this a few months ago and there was a lot

274
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:41,140
of hype about it.

275
00:14:41,140 --> 00:14:47,760
And it has failed to deliver so far on many different levels.

276
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:51,200
The first is that he promised it would ship within 30 days.

277
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:53,320
And this was at the end of May.

278
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:55,000
So that means by the end of June.

279
00:14:55,000 --> 00:15:00,520
And here we are in September, and it's only just about starting to ship now.

280
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:03,480
And then they made promises that it would be within a week.

281
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:07,760
And it just they keep letting us down, which is kind of understandable for a startup.

282
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:11,540
And you know, I'm not going to be too harsh on them for that.

283
00:15:11,540 --> 00:15:16,440
But then this week, they just royally screwed up.

284
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:20,080
They managed to somehow send everyone's information to everyone.

285
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:24,280
What appears to have happened is that essential had a list of customers that needed to verify

286
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:26,620
to prevent fraud for orders.

287
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:29,220
So it sent them an email requesting more information.

288
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:35,440
But that email address was set up as a group email, which meant that replies sent to it

289
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:38,440
were then sent to everybody on the mailing list.

290
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:44,060
It was a misconfigured customer support address on their Zendesk system, which is a customer

291
00:15:44,060 --> 00:15:45,640
service portal.

292
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:48,200
And you know, it's one of those things when you're a new company, and you've never used

293
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:49,920
it in production.

294
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:51,200
These things happen.

295
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:53,160
And it's really embarrassing.

296
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:55,080
Yeah, that is really embarrassing.

297
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:59,800
I mean, where do you stand on them failing to deliver the actual phones, though?

298
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:02,280
delays in shipping are understandable.

299
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:03,820
This one may be fatal.

300
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:09,440
This delay has pushed them right up against the new launch of the note eight and the iPhone

301
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:11,560
eight massive competition.

302
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:14,220
And this could be a real death blow to the essential phone.

303
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:19,200
And then you combine it with the early reviews that are not looking particularly positive,

304
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:22,200
particularly around this camera that's been promoted extensively.

305
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:25,800
Oh, it turns out Joe phones are hard.

306
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:30,320
Yeah, it's funny that if only we knew of some other companies that tried to make phones

307
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:35,520
and push them into the market and disrupt it and failed completely.

308
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:37,960
The difference here is that he came up with Android in the first place.

309
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:41,880
So you think that he would know a bit about it, but apparently not.

310
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:45,560
I mean, I recall being a bit skeptical at the time and saying, there's no way I'd pay

311
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:46,880
that much for a phone.

312
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:51,820
And it seems that they've just overhyped the over promised and under delivered.

313
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:55,160
You've got a situation where it's a first generation phone, maybe they should have been

314
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:58,760
a bit more, more like OnePlus were about it.

315
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:03,480
Their first one was all word of mouth, and maybe not the invitation system and stuff.

316
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:05,080
That was kind of a bit dumb.

317
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:10,240
But be low key about it first, make sure you get one product out the door that's working.

318
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:14,520
And we haven't even talked about this 360 degree camera that was touted as one of the

319
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:15,520
great things about it.

320
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:19,200
This phone's modular, you can clip on these accessories, well, that camera is nowhere

321
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:20,280
in sight.

322
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:24,920
My takeaway from all of this, and it's something that I hope that open source projects can

323
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:29,840
watch and learn from so they don't make the same mistake, is the talent and the engineering

324
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:32,300
is a component.

325
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:37,400
But shipping a phone requires many components, and it requires a well oiled machine underneath

326
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:38,400
it.

327
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:42,520
And what's happening here is marketing promises that don't live up to the hype, like the promises

328
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:47,160
about camera or battery life that aren't living up to the hype, or the shipping dates.

329
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:50,400
You know, Andy doesn't have direct control over manufacturing deadlines and shipping

330
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:51,400
dates.

331
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:52,880
So it's not just good engineering talent.

332
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:56,680
It's also a really well oiled machine that supports shipping a consumer product like

333
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:57,680
this.

334
00:17:57,680 --> 00:18:00,360
Yeah, and first generation, you're going to make mistakes.

335
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:03,640
So they really shouldn't have hyped it as much as they did, but what are you going to

336
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:04,640
do?

337
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:05,880
They did.

338
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:12,680
Speaking of hype, blockchains have all of it these days, and there is big money in the

339
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:13,680
blockchain business.

340
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:18,560
Well, there's big money in cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin, for example, Ethereum, that sort

341
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:19,560
of thing.

342
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:22,640
But there's a lot more to this than meets the eye.

343
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:25,040
You think blockchain, you think Bitcoin.

344
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:31,400
But the reality is that big business has been watching this develop and actively taking

345
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:36,800
part in the development of blockchain technology and has been implementing it in lots of different

346
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:39,680
ways that have nothing to do with Bitcoin.

347
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:46,040
Indeed, like initial coin offerings, ICOs, which are essentially investment coins that

348
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:48,760
people are investing in different technologies.

349
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:53,440
There's venture capital firms like Sequoia and Anderson Horowitz that are getting into

350
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:54,440
this.

351
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:59,480
But you know what's really funny, Joe, is at the core of all of this blockchain hype

352
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:02,280
is the most boring thing ever.

353
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:07,840
And I'm sorry to our accountants in the audience, but underneath all of this, it's just a reinnovation

354
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:09,560
of accounting.

355
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:12,720
It's an improvement in a major way to accounting.

356
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:15,000
And that's the big story here.

357
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,520
And they're all just trying to figure it out.

358
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:22,680
Yeah, and not necessarily just financial accounting, but actual accounting of stock and where it's

359
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:28,480
moving to and which distribution networks it's going through and at what stage it is

360
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:29,480
and everything.

361
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:33,000
It's just documentation of all of the boring bits of a business.

362
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:37,480
Yeah, a blockchain is a kind of a ledger, a table that businesses could use to track

363
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:40,960
credits and debts, but also all the things that Joe just mentioned.

364
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:45,080
And it's not like a standard SQL database.

365
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:47,240
It's something that's cryptographically verified.

366
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:52,760
One of the blockchain's distinguishing features is that chains are verified transactions in

367
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:55,100
a sequence of blocks.

368
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:57,800
And you can't go back once a block is committed.

369
00:19:57,800 --> 00:20:02,680
So it's in, it's a public ledger, it's been cryptographically verified, it uses complex

370
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:07,040
verifiable math, so everybody can have faith in the system.

371
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:12,000
And when properly applied, a blockchain can help assure data integrity, maintain audible

372
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:19,840
records, and perhaps in some different iterations, render financial contracts into a programmable

373
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:20,840
software.

374
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:25,040
A contract is confirmed, it's read on the blockchain, action is immediately taken.

375
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:29,560
So that when you have something that businesses can share amongst themselves, that is cryptographically

376
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:34,400
verified, it opens up a huge range of business automation and potentials.

377
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,720
And that's what everybody's rushing towards right now.

378
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:40,560
You said one key word there, public, which we're used to with Bitcoin and stuff, but

379
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:42,840
it doesn't necessarily have to be a public ledger.

380
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:45,560
It can be an internal company ledger.

381
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:51,600
And I think that's one of the key strengths here, that you can have something that is,

382
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:55,560
as you say, cryptographically verified, so you can know within your company that it hasn't

383
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:58,160
been tampered with, it's exactly what it should be.

384
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:02,720
And it's a permanent record of pretty much anything you want it to be.

385
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:06,620
And so it's no wonder that these companies are taking advantage of it, because it makes

386
00:21:06,620 --> 00:21:09,400
far more sense than traditional databases.

387
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:12,640
And that's why you're seeing all kinds of companies jump in, and the Linux Foundation,

388
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:16,000
which is really trying to legitimize business around the blockchain.

389
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:21,160
Yeah, hopefully the Linux Foundation's involvement will make sure it all stays open source and

390
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:24,120
that we can all benefit from it.

391
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:26,960
But let's end with some positive news, shall we?

392
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:36,000
And that is that Linux browser market share is above 3% now, 3.37% according to NetApplications.

393
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:40,200
So we should all have a party for 3.37%.

394
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:43,420
That's actually pretty cool, 3.37%.

395
00:21:43,420 --> 00:21:47,240
So you might wonder, where do these stats come from and why do you seem to hear about

396
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:48,880
them from time to time?

397
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:54,640
NetApplications is a business that resells and white labels their data that they collect,

398
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:57,800
and they publish it free once a month.

399
00:21:57,800 --> 00:22:01,080
And this kind of creates a news story about once a month.

400
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:04,800
We've never really covered it because, well, it's never been above 3%.

401
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:06,280
Now where does the data come from?

402
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:10,680
They claim they have 40,000 websites that participate.

403
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:14,600
They take that data, they only count one visit per day, even if you visited, say, a site

404
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:17,360
a dozen times, they only count you once.

405
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:20,120
And then they average all out and they get their math.

406
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:24,000
It's interesting sounding, but when I dug into it, I tried to sign up.

407
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,680
I wanted to pretend like I wanted to participate in the program.

408
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:31,480
And when I sniffed around, it looked like they actually have more like 19,000 active

409
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:32,760
participating sites.

410
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:38,600
The number 40,000 participating websites hasn't changed since 2008, so I'm a little suspicious

411
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:40,440
of that.

412
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:45,600
And Apple and Microsoft are clients of theirs, and they've admitted that in the past.

413
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:51,840
So there could be some bias, but either way, even if it's not a huge selection, at best,

414
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:55,120
at absolute best, it's 160 million uniques.

415
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:57,600
That's if you believe their 40,000 number.

416
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:59,920
But surely you can extrapolate that to some extent.

417
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,160
I agree, and so do they.

418
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:09,320
In fact, they use data provided by the CIA, I'm not making this up, to consider like trend

419
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:14,120
information about different areas around the world to take that into consideration.

420
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:20,640
Historically, they've been really under-representing Asia, and I guess with this new data provided

421
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:25,440
by the CIA, they're now able to take more of a general accounting.

422
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:29,720
And so it does seem to be representative of the web, but I actually think it's low.

423
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:31,720
I think it's a low number.

424
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:36,960
And one of the challenges that they've had recently is Chrome OS and mobile, and I think

425
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:39,920
Linux is actually getting significantly under-represented.

426
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:44,600
But I'll take 3.3%, that's pretty respectable, but I think it's actually low, amazingly.

427
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:46,800
Well, I think we need to define this.

428
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:51,580
You say Linux, so Chrome OS has a Linux kernel and Android has a Linux kernel.

429
00:23:51,580 --> 00:23:54,240
Do you specifically mean GNU slash desktop Linux?

430
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:56,640
I do, because they do separate it out.

431
00:23:56,640 --> 00:24:03,280
Chrome OS has 0.56% according to another site, which is Stack Counter, and they also represent

432
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:07,360
Chrome OS in net applications market share data.

433
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:12,120
I do think Linux is under-represented in this data, simply because some of the sites that

434
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:17,480
they have in their participation program, I don't think really cater to a technical

435
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:18,480
audience.

436
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:25,320
They're more average consumer gossipy, entertainment websites, and e-entertainment, and those types

437
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:31,920
of gossip magazines, and less things like Stack Exchange, Google Groups, Hacker News,

438
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:32,920
those types of sites.

439
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:37,600
Surely, it would make more sense if they could get Google, google.com.

440
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:44,640
That would be a handy general purpose website, or Amazon, or something like that, that everybody

441
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:45,640
uses.

442
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:46,640
Yeah.

443
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:47,640
Yeah.

444
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:52,080
I think the real answer just has to lie in our hearts, Joe.

445
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:59,680
Well, 2017 is the year of Linux on a desktop for me, as have the last 10, so that's all

446
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:00,680
that matters to me.

447
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:01,680
That's right.

448
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:03,840
That's a personal year of the Linux desktop.
