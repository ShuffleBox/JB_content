00:00.000 --> 00:09.600
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, episode 189, recorded on May 15, 2021.

00:09.600 --> 00:10.600
I'm Chris.

00:10.600 --> 00:11.600
And I'm Wes.

00:11.600 --> 00:12.600
Hello, Wes.

00:12.600 --> 00:13.800
Let's do the news.

00:13.800 --> 00:19.440
Last week, we discussed Audacity's new management and their pull request adding telemetry to

00:19.440 --> 00:20.440
the project.

00:20.440 --> 00:23.840
Well, this week, it seems they've reversed course.

00:23.840 --> 00:30.040
Plans to use Google Analytics and Yandex to track and analyze events within Audacity was

00:30.040 --> 00:33.680
greeted with considerable alarm by the community.

00:33.680 --> 00:40.400
The request itself is nearing 3,500 clicks of the thumbs down emoji as we record with

00:40.400 --> 00:46.760
remarks such as it being, quote, a massive middle finger to the application's supporters,

00:46.760 --> 00:50.480
capturing the strength of some community members' feelings.

00:50.480 --> 00:52.560
And those are really just the people we heard from.

00:52.560 --> 00:53.920
Yeah, that's right.

00:53.920 --> 00:59.520
Now, despite attempts to calm things down, new project lead Martin Curie, also known

00:59.520 --> 01:06.280
as Tanta Cruel, posted yesterday that the plans as originally envisaged had been dropped.

01:06.280 --> 01:10.840
Google and Yandex would not feature in the immediate future, and self-hosting would be

01:10.840 --> 01:13.600
used for error reporting and update checks.

01:13.600 --> 01:19.280
Curie described the original pull request as, quote, a bad communication slash coordination

01:19.280 --> 01:23.300
blunder, saying that they were very sorry for causing so much alarm.

01:23.300 --> 01:28.680
He went on to say the response to PR 835 has brought about a realization at Muse that the

01:28.680 --> 01:33.880
convenience of using Yandex and Google is at odds with the public perception of trustworthiness,

01:33.880 --> 01:36.480
so we will be self-hosting instead.

01:36.480 --> 01:41.080
Curie goes on to say, it was a completely innocent mistake that ended up doing the announcing

01:41.080 --> 01:43.640
for us in the worst way possible.

01:43.640 --> 01:47.920
In other words, Wes, he's basically saying the problem was not the Google Analytics or

01:47.920 --> 01:53.120
the Yandex tracking, but the fake news about adding Google Analytics and Yandex.

01:53.120 --> 01:58.000
Yeah, I'm not sure that response is really acknowledging that the root of the issue here

01:58.000 --> 02:02.120
was the telemetry itself and not the communication, although I'm sure the project would have liked

02:02.120 --> 02:06.980
to have more control over that communication in open source and in a project that's just

02:06.980 --> 02:07.980
changed hands.

02:07.980 --> 02:10.680
You've got to expect that APR is going to get some scrutiny.

02:10.680 --> 02:13.160
Yeah, when you put it out there, we're all going to see it.

02:13.160 --> 02:18.560
That's how it works in the free software world, and especially with the quintessential free

02:18.560 --> 02:20.400
software audio editor.

02:20.400 --> 02:25.880
Even with these changes, Curie remains keen on telemetry overall, hoping to be informed

02:25.880 --> 02:30.800
about where time and effort could be and need to be invested in the project.

02:30.800 --> 02:35.200
There have been a few options floated for going forward, including making an optional

02:35.200 --> 02:40.120
add-on that users could elect to install, but that's all for the future to be decided.

02:40.120 --> 02:44.060
I'll have to make do without telemetry for the time being.

02:44.060 --> 02:47.720
Our next headline in news that you should know this week involves a story we've been

02:47.720 --> 02:53.040
covering for a very long time on the show, and that is Google's slow cook of Fuchsia

02:53.040 --> 02:54.040
OS.

02:54.040 --> 02:58.320
Now, you might recall back in December, Google opened up Fuchsia to developers of all varieties

02:58.320 --> 03:02.040
to contribute to the Fuchsia project, and we noted that moment right here on the show

03:02.040 --> 03:06.840
because it really also was, it was a milestone in the sense that the project came out into

03:06.840 --> 03:11.200
the limelight for the first time and Google started publicly talking about Fuchsia and

03:11.200 --> 03:12.840
contributing to Fuchsia.

03:12.840 --> 03:18.720
And having others use and contribute back up to Fuchsia certainly feels like a big milestone.

03:18.720 --> 03:23.920
One big name that appears to be taking up Google's offer to contribute to the project

03:23.920 --> 03:25.600
is Samsung.

03:25.600 --> 03:31.440
Samsung has submitted a patch related to their flash friendly file system or F2FS, which

03:31.440 --> 03:36.200
is an alternative file system designed and optimized specifically for flash storage,

03:36.200 --> 03:39.560
such as say, I don't know, the built in storage of a smartphone.

03:39.560 --> 03:44.280
Hmm, makes you wonder perhaps what Fuchsia just might be used for in the future.

03:44.280 --> 03:48.320
More importantly, though, this isn't a lone Samsung employee contributing work to Fuchsia

03:48.320 --> 03:49.760
in their own name.

03:49.760 --> 03:55.920
No, now you'll find in the official author's file Samsung Inc. listed side by side with

03:55.920 --> 03:58.440
Google LLC.

03:58.440 --> 04:02.720
The Ubuntu Touch project is in the headlines this week because they released OTA 17 with

04:02.720 --> 04:09.000
many improvements and the big headline feature is NFC hardware support, which is available

04:09.000 --> 04:14.080
for all Android 9 compatible devices such as the Google Pixel 3a and the Volaphone.

04:14.080 --> 04:18.200
And according to the UbiPorts project, NFC can now allow an app developer to implement

04:18.200 --> 04:23.280
the ability to read and write NFC tags right in the app, as well as communicate with other

04:23.280 --> 04:25.560
devices that support the NFC protocol.

04:25.560 --> 04:29.140
And they've already whipped up a demo application to kind of show it all off.

04:29.140 --> 04:35.240
That's not all though, in addition to NFC support, the Ubuntu Touch OTA 17 update adds

04:35.240 --> 04:40.840
many improvements to the camera, things like flash, focus, rotation, and zoom on several

04:40.840 --> 04:43.240
supported Ubuntu phone devices.

04:43.240 --> 04:50.260
Under the hood, Ubuntu Touch OTA 17 is based on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS, but as Dalton Durst told

04:50.260 --> 04:56.080
us recently, the team is still working hard to rebase things over to Ubuntu 20.04.

04:56.080 --> 04:59.720
And our last headline before we get to the discussion story this week is the framework

04:59.720 --> 05:03.760
laptop we told you about a little while ago is now available for pre-order.

05:03.760 --> 05:08.560
Now you may recall this is the repairable laptop that includes a series of modules you

05:08.560 --> 05:13.820
can add, and they have a DIY kit that lets you run Linux and you assemble it and install

05:13.820 --> 05:15.320
your own distribution.

05:15.320 --> 05:20.000
Each laptop comes with four bays that are compatible with this expansion card system

05:20.000 --> 05:26.520
that lets you select the ports via these exchangeable modules, so you have USB-C and A modules and

05:26.520 --> 05:31.840
HDMI and DisplayPort and MicroSD, like all of these are different fast modules that are

05:31.840 --> 05:33.940
using USB4 connectivity.

05:33.940 --> 05:38.360
Things like storage and an extra battery can be plugged in or a gigabit Ethernet module,

05:38.360 --> 05:40.000
which is also in the works.

05:40.000 --> 05:46.120
The framework laptop is offered with pre-configured models running Windows 10 Home or Pro, but

05:46.120 --> 05:52.560
the company also designed the DIY edition, which is sold as a kit to let people customize

05:52.560 --> 05:57.920
and assemble the laptop and install a Linux distribution.

05:57.920 --> 06:03.320
Currently there are three basic configurations, base, performance, and professional, ranging

06:03.320 --> 06:07.540
from just under $1,000 to just under $2,000.

06:07.540 --> 06:14.280
With hardware ranging from an Intel Core i5, 8 gigs of RAM and 256 gigs of NVMe storage,

06:14.280 --> 06:20.400
up to a Core i7, 32 gigs of RAM and a terabyte of storage space.

06:20.400 --> 06:26.800
As for the pre-order itself, Framework is only asking that users put down a $100 deposit,

06:26.800 --> 06:32.400
fully refundable they say, with the first laptop set to ship at the end of July.

06:32.400 --> 06:38.100
So far pre-orders are only available in the US, but Canada is promised in the next few

06:38.100 --> 06:43.720
weeks, and availability in Europe and Asia set for later this year.

06:43.720 --> 06:45.520
So Westpac, you're kind of in the laptop market.

06:45.520 --> 06:49.800
I know you went and plugged into their configurator a machine that would be an ideal config for

06:49.800 --> 06:50.800
you.

06:50.800 --> 06:52.440
I'm curious what you spec'd and what the price came out to be.

06:52.440 --> 06:54.840
Yeah, it was a fun little experiment.

06:54.840 --> 07:01.000
It was just over two grand for an 11th Gen i7, the nicest one that they offered, 64 gigs

07:01.000 --> 07:04.880
of RAM because, you know, you know I want to run a bunch of stuff in memory that I probably

07:04.880 --> 07:05.880
shouldn't.

07:05.880 --> 07:06.880
Like your entire OS.

07:06.880 --> 07:08.440
Yeah, like that.

07:08.440 --> 07:11.600
And I didn't want to go crazy with storage, still trying to keep it somewhat reasonable.

07:11.600 --> 07:16.000
So I just chose the one terabyte SSD, but it was the fastest version that they had.

07:16.000 --> 07:18.160
You could go higher, but that's enough to start with.

07:18.160 --> 07:21.360
I noticed though that this thing doesn't ship by default with a power adapter.

07:21.360 --> 07:24.600
No, really following the trends there, aren't they?

07:24.600 --> 07:28.740
Now it is just USB-C and they are very clear that you can go get one yourself and give

07:28.740 --> 07:32.680
you some specs that might help you find it, or they've got a fancy one they've custom

07:32.680 --> 07:33.680
engineered themselves.

07:33.680 --> 07:35.240
Yeah, it's like 50 bucks.

07:35.240 --> 07:36.240
It's not too bad.

07:36.240 --> 07:38.920
Yeah, I figured I'd just get that because it's nice to have one by default and it's

07:38.920 --> 07:43.400
not assigned, it's new, it's just for that laptop and I'd have to go buy one anyway.

07:43.400 --> 07:45.760
When you were pricing this, did you select the DIY edition?

07:45.760 --> 07:47.440
Yeah, you know I did.

07:47.440 --> 07:51.960
And that was interesting because you both get to and have to kind of bring your own

07:51.960 --> 07:52.960
connectivity.

07:52.960 --> 07:56.240
Now, I guess in the future when there's third party modules, you could be, you know, might

07:56.240 --> 07:59.480
have some already from a different laptop you want to plug and play, but I'm just getting

07:59.480 --> 08:02.000
started as is this ecosystem.

08:02.000 --> 08:03.920
So I needed to get some ports.

08:03.920 --> 08:08.080
You mean like the DIY edition, it really is DIY, like there are no ports on this thing.

08:08.080 --> 08:11.880
Yeah, that's why they say they, quote, recommend that you select for add-ons.

08:11.880 --> 08:16.760
All right, well, so like, how much are these add-ons?

08:16.760 --> 08:17.760
Not too bad.

08:17.760 --> 08:21.260
USB-C and A ports are each $9.

08:21.260 --> 08:25.720
Goes up a little bit though for fancier stuff like HDMI, DisplayPort, or MicroSD, which

08:25.720 --> 08:26.720
are 19.

08:26.720 --> 08:31.640
I could see having to pay $20 to have an HDMI port on your laptop being a turnoff, but then

08:31.640 --> 08:35.320
perhaps those people would be better suited for one of the packaged models that includes

08:35.320 --> 08:36.320
modules already.

08:36.320 --> 08:37.920
Yeah, that very well could be the case.

08:37.920 --> 08:40.880
And I could see this really shining for folks that wanted to buy a bunch of modules and

08:40.880 --> 08:43.940
reconfigure things depending on different scenarios, or maybe you just have a weird

08:43.940 --> 08:47.320
use case and you really want to use all of these with just USB-A.

08:47.320 --> 08:52.520
So after your modules and your power supply, what was your grand total for your config?

08:52.520 --> 08:53.520
2,176.

08:53.520 --> 08:56.600
All right, all right.

08:56.600 --> 08:57.600
That's not outrageous.

08:57.600 --> 09:03.600
I mean, that's definitely not the best deal around, but I mean, what's the value of repairability?

09:03.600 --> 09:08.280
And these modules, because they're using USB4, it's not like they're totally unique proprietary

09:08.280 --> 09:09.280
to the framework.

09:09.280 --> 09:12.920
I mean, I hate to say it, but they could kind of go away and you could maybe still wire

09:12.920 --> 09:13.920
into that.

09:13.920 --> 09:17.680
And then when you look at the internals of this thing, the disk and all that is just

09:17.680 --> 09:22.800
standard components that are just totally accessible by end users, including the battery.

09:22.800 --> 09:26.560
So what is the value of a laptop where you can replace the battery and the hard drive

09:26.560 --> 09:27.560
and repair it?

09:27.560 --> 09:29.940
I mean, it seems like maybe it's worth a slight premium.

09:29.940 --> 09:30.940
What do you think?

09:30.940 --> 09:31.940
Are you going to pull the trigger?

09:31.940 --> 09:35.560
It seems like I think that's a good idea because I just did.

09:35.560 --> 09:36.560
Yeah.

09:36.560 --> 09:38.040
There you go.

09:38.040 --> 09:39.760
A live pre-order right here on the show.

09:39.760 --> 09:40.760
Well, we'll see what happens.

09:40.760 --> 09:41.760
It's going to be interesting.

09:41.760 --> 09:42.760
Are you excited, Wes?

09:42.760 --> 09:46.400
It feels like an opportunity to fall in love with a laptop, which I haven't done really

09:46.400 --> 09:48.220
for a long time.

09:48.220 --> 09:49.220
It is a little bit steep.

09:49.220 --> 09:53.160
We'll see how that goes, but it's bucking a trend that just about no one else in the

09:53.160 --> 09:54.300
industry is.

09:54.300 --> 09:59.200
And I do like the idea of repairability and upgradability in a laptop that I control.

09:59.200 --> 10:02.040
And I tend to do pretty odd projects here and there.

10:02.040 --> 10:03.600
So it seems like a good fit.

10:03.600 --> 10:06.640
We'll see how it works out.

10:06.640 --> 10:08.980
Linode dot com slash LAN.

10:08.980 --> 10:12.080
You go there to get one hundred dollars and sixty day credit towards a new account.

10:12.080 --> 10:14.000
And of course, you support the show.

10:14.000 --> 10:19.480
Linode is the largest independent cloud provider and they are our cloud provider.

10:19.480 --> 10:21.120
That's where we host everything now.

10:21.120 --> 10:23.160
I've been using it personally for a couple of years.

10:23.160 --> 10:27.660
And when it was time to go independent again, we went with Linode and then after using it

10:27.660 --> 10:32.240
for a while, I knew that they would make the perfect sponsor, because when I use a product

10:32.240 --> 10:35.960
and I love it for reasons that I know will resonate with the audience, I think to myself

10:35.960 --> 10:38.320
that has serious sponsor potential.

10:38.320 --> 10:42.280
So I want you to go take advantage of this one hundred dollar credit because using Linode

10:42.280 --> 10:44.340
is really what makes it click.

10:44.340 --> 10:48.560
You'll see it's just a little bit nicer than the way everybody does their version of what

10:48.560 --> 10:51.080
Linode started back in 2003.

10:51.080 --> 10:54.000
They've been around forever and they have focused on this game.

10:54.000 --> 10:56.680
Their technology stack is top of the line.

10:56.680 --> 10:57.960
Their systems are fast.

10:57.960 --> 11:01.980
Their network connections are screaming and they've got 11 data centers around the world.

11:01.980 --> 11:05.320
They also have hundreds of guides, tutorials to help you get started.

11:05.320 --> 11:08.360
And you know, one of the things that I think is great about Linode that you appreciate

11:08.360 --> 11:10.720
when you need it is their support.

11:10.720 --> 11:14.980
And this is something that's really, really come in from our audience over time.

11:14.980 --> 11:19.200
As we've had Linode now for a little while as a sponsor, we get feedback and over and

11:19.200 --> 11:23.160
over again, I hear from you out there that say Linode's support is fantastic.

11:23.160 --> 11:28.200
I got myself into a pickle, Chris, and Linode got me out of it.

11:28.200 --> 11:31.520
By phone or ticket, they're going to give you the best support in the industry.

11:31.520 --> 11:35.520
We use the heck out of their S3 compatible object storage.

11:35.520 --> 11:39.160
That's something you could really look into to take advantage of just something that goes

11:39.160 --> 11:40.960
beyond even just hosting.

11:40.960 --> 11:43.020
It's something beyond just an average server.

11:43.020 --> 11:44.020
It's object storage.

11:44.020 --> 11:45.020
It's great.

11:45.020 --> 11:46.020
You should go check it out.

11:46.020 --> 11:48.440
They have a lot of stuff that you're going to take advantage of from five dollar rigs

11:48.440 --> 11:51.640
to really super fast high end systems.

11:51.640 --> 11:52.640
Go play around.

11:52.640 --> 11:53.640
Go learn.

11:53.640 --> 12:00.280
Go try something out with that $100 60 day credit at Linode dot com slash land.

12:00.280 --> 12:04.040
And a big thank you to Ting, Linux dot Ting dot com.

12:04.040 --> 12:09.560
Ting's new set 12 plan will give you 12 gigs of data with unlimited talk and text for just

12:09.560 --> 12:12.000
thirty five dollars a month.

12:12.000 --> 12:15.120
They also have the perfect family plan.

12:15.120 --> 12:18.640
And if you use two gigs or 20 gigs a month, Ting's going to have a plan that will work

12:18.640 --> 12:20.080
just right for you.

12:20.080 --> 12:23.620
You've really got access to three different networks that you can take advantage of.

12:23.620 --> 12:28.240
That means a nationwide LTE and 5G coverage that's best in your area.

12:28.240 --> 12:31.700
Plus the freedom of no contracts ever.

12:31.700 --> 12:36.080
And the great thing about Ting is their customer support is also fantastic.

12:36.080 --> 12:39.760
That's a big thing that I want nailed when we have a sponsor for you is I want them to

12:39.760 --> 12:41.780
be able to take care of you guys long term.

12:41.780 --> 12:42.960
And Ting is all about that.

12:42.960 --> 12:45.140
That's been a major focus of their business.

12:45.140 --> 12:50.520
So go to Linux dot Ting dot com and take $25 whatever plan you end up with, including their

12:50.520 --> 12:52.840
$45 a month unlimited plan.

12:52.840 --> 12:57.040
You take $25 off your first month when you go to Linux dot Ting dot com.

12:57.040 --> 12:59.960
I've been a customer for about 500 years, I think.

12:59.960 --> 13:03.280
I mean, I'm just I'm not great at math, but I think that's about it.

13:03.280 --> 13:07.200
And I'll tell you one of the things that I appreciate the most is over the entire lifetime

13:07.200 --> 13:10.080
that I've been a member of Ting, which has been years, honestly.

13:10.080 --> 13:14.320
I've had to interact with the customer service twice because of a device issue.

13:14.320 --> 13:17.080
And each time it was a great experience.

13:17.080 --> 13:21.800
But all the other all the other stuff, moving devices, switching networks, activating a

13:21.800 --> 13:27.080
new device, adding a family line, that's always been done through the Ting website.

13:27.080 --> 13:28.540
They nail those tools.

13:28.540 --> 13:30.080
They set that benchmark.

13:30.080 --> 13:34.780
If you're not big on interacting with human support over the phone, you're going to find

13:34.780 --> 13:37.200
their website really takes care of most your issues.

13:37.200 --> 13:40.440
So check out Linux dot Ting dot com, take $25 off.

13:40.440 --> 13:42.200
It's really simple to switch to Ting.

13:42.200 --> 13:45.400
Just about every phone will work because they do support so many networks.

13:45.400 --> 13:49.980
You go over to their website, you put in your phone information, and then when everything

13:49.980 --> 13:53.360
checks out, Ting sends you a SIM card, you pop that in, you go to their website a little

13:53.360 --> 13:54.480
bit later and you're good to go.

13:54.480 --> 13:55.600
I mean, you're done.

13:55.600 --> 14:00.840
You're talking like a half hour tops of investment here to save money every single month.

14:00.840 --> 14:05.960
So go to Linux dot Ting dot com.

14:05.960 --> 14:12.840
What you're hearing right now is System76's new launch keyboard in action with the Jade

14:12.840 --> 14:14.040
switches.

14:14.040 --> 14:19.240
Two sets of switches will be offered for this formally announced configurable mechanical

14:19.240 --> 14:20.240
keyboard.

14:20.240 --> 14:24.880
The second set, the Royal switches, are a little more muted.

14:24.880 --> 14:25.880
Yes, it's real.

14:25.880 --> 14:29.160
It is actually real and pre-orders are starting now.

14:29.160 --> 14:33.400
The compact, highly configurable mechanical keyboard is entirely open source, as we would

14:33.400 --> 14:35.560
expect from System76.

14:35.560 --> 14:40.160
The schematics, the chassis, even the firmware code is all freely available and there's tight

14:40.160 --> 14:45.860
integration with Pop OS, but it also works with all Linux distros, Windows and Mac OS.

14:45.860 --> 14:51.320
The device comes with extra sets of key caps, a key polar, a little bar to give you a little

14:51.320 --> 14:54.240
bit of a raise, all those kinds of things in the box.

14:54.240 --> 14:57.540
All the niceties you'd expect from a high end mechanical keyboard.

14:57.540 --> 15:02.480
Something that really stands out about the launch is its use of a split space bar.

15:02.480 --> 15:06.880
But yeah, not just one big space bar, but two separate keys.

15:06.880 --> 15:13.120
This is a little bit unusual, but System76 has its reasons for doing so, namely that

15:13.120 --> 15:18.200
their research reveals that most of us only use our right or left thumb for the space

15:18.200 --> 15:20.480
bar, but rarely both.

15:20.480 --> 15:25.200
So since there's half a key going to waste, you can swap it out for something you might

15:25.200 --> 15:26.860
actually use.

15:26.860 --> 15:33.560
The keyboard is also a USB hub with four USB 3.2 Gen 2 ports, two of those being type A

15:33.560 --> 15:35.800
and the other two type C.

15:35.800 --> 15:41.480
And the other aspect of the launch will be the software that is a companion piece with

15:41.480 --> 15:42.480
the keyboard.

15:42.480 --> 15:46.620
It lets you switch between different keyboard mappings at the push of a button.

15:46.620 --> 15:50.960
Anytime you want to switch a layout, you can hit a key on the keyboard or use the configuration

15:50.960 --> 15:53.000
app to initiate the change.

15:53.000 --> 15:57.360
And there will be four layers of key mappings that you can do to this.

15:57.360 --> 16:02.160
And like they're doing with their new products, these are made in Denver, Colorado.

16:02.160 --> 16:08.760
The cost will be $285 US greenbacks and the shipments will start early next month.

16:08.760 --> 16:12.800
So those are the facts, but how are we feeling about it?

16:12.800 --> 16:16.600
Well, my first thought is A, that's pretty pricey.

16:16.600 --> 16:21.680
But B, just from looking at all the promotional material and hearing from folks from System76,

16:21.680 --> 16:24.960
you can tell they've had a lot of fun and are really proud of this thing.

16:24.960 --> 16:28.560
Yeah, there's a high end keyboard market, no doubt about it.

16:28.560 --> 16:31.080
And I mean, because you can buy keyboards for $20.

16:31.080 --> 16:35.080
The keyboard that I have right here in front of me, this was like $100 keyboard, you know,

16:35.080 --> 16:39.400
and I think the most I've ever spent for a keyboard that is built for RSI, I think it

16:39.400 --> 16:40.640
was $300.

16:40.640 --> 16:43.840
The ultimate hacker keyboard, I think is around that price.

16:43.840 --> 16:49.200
And this is offering pretty much everything that those keyboards offer, plus it's fully

16:49.200 --> 16:54.040
open source, even the firmware, which a lot of them are now, but this is nice to see.

16:54.040 --> 16:58.440
And it's built right here in the US of A. And for us Linux users, I'm going to like

16:58.440 --> 17:03.040
the fact that it's using LVFS for future firmware updates on the keyboard.

17:03.040 --> 17:04.040
I like that.

17:04.040 --> 17:06.240
That means you might actually do those updates.

17:06.240 --> 17:08.120
I think I definitely will.

17:08.120 --> 17:09.120
So I did order one.

17:09.120 --> 17:13.000
I asked for a review unit too, so that way I could get some time on it perhaps earlier.

17:13.000 --> 17:20.840
But I ordered one because I like the idea of System76 getting into the accessory market.

17:20.840 --> 17:25.360
They could sell 70% of these to Windows users for all I care about, you know, finance a

17:25.360 --> 17:26.360
few Thalios.

17:26.360 --> 17:27.360
Yeah, that's a good point.

17:27.360 --> 17:29.820
This isn't really directed just at Linux users.

17:29.820 --> 17:34.240
It's really anyone who likes a nice mechanical keyboard or who's really a power user and

17:34.240 --> 17:36.840
might actually take advantage of all those layers.

17:36.840 --> 17:40.040
I think there's also something pretty clever from a planning standpoint.

17:40.040 --> 17:44.280
If they learn how to master this keyboard, that's going to become really, really useful.

17:44.280 --> 17:48.200
And that's going to be a lot of lessons learned when it comes time to build a laptop.

17:48.200 --> 17:53.480
And I think long term, if we want a vendor in this space who's shipping open source systems

17:53.480 --> 17:58.520
from top to bottom, from the chassis to the software, I think you got to kind of vote

17:58.520 --> 18:01.280
with your wallet a bit on this one, at least I'm going to.

18:01.280 --> 18:04.080
But it struck me, you know, it's like I'm not going to buy three of these things.

18:04.080 --> 18:06.520
I'm not going to deck out all my machines.

18:06.520 --> 18:08.280
And I know it's easy for me to say.

18:08.280 --> 18:14.280
I don't say this lightly at all, but what I would love to see is what kind of compromises

18:14.280 --> 18:16.960
would they have to make to get a hundred dollar version?

18:16.960 --> 18:21.360
Something where maybe if I'm ordering a workstation, I could throw this in the order and get a

18:21.360 --> 18:23.880
nice keyboard with my workstation.

18:23.880 --> 18:30.080
But you know, at $285, I don't know Wes, I'd almost probably rather spend that money on

18:30.080 --> 18:32.840
storage or memory than a keyboard.

18:32.840 --> 18:35.720
If I'm a typical user now, yeah.

18:35.720 --> 18:39.640
If I know the value of a mechanical keyboard, like I have now learned in the more recent

18:39.640 --> 18:40.640
in recent years.

18:40.640 --> 18:46.320
But, you know, at $285, unless I really know that I like keyboards, it's a big ask.

18:46.320 --> 18:47.320
I agree with you.

18:47.320 --> 18:48.800
Yeah, that's a good way to put it.

18:48.800 --> 18:52.540
I might buy this for my, you know, software development workstation at home because I

18:52.540 --> 18:57.560
want a nice keyboard, but I wouldn't just go adding it to any old random Thalia order.

18:57.560 --> 18:58.560
Yeah.

18:58.560 --> 19:01.800
And obviously some of this is going to come down to how it feels.

19:01.800 --> 19:05.560
My philosophy, just super briefly, I've talked about it plenty on Coder Radio.

19:05.560 --> 19:07.640
I'm touching my keyboard all day long.

19:07.640 --> 19:10.820
I realized it's my hands are constantly on my keyboard.

19:10.820 --> 19:14.340
It is my number one interface to my computer.

19:14.340 --> 19:16.080
And I think I want it to be nice.

19:16.080 --> 19:17.320
I want it to feel good.

19:17.320 --> 19:18.880
I want it to sound good.

19:18.880 --> 19:23.180
I want to have a nice experience when I interact with it because I'm interacting with it for

19:23.180 --> 19:25.800
God knows how many hours a week.

19:25.800 --> 19:28.720
Having an integrated hub could be pretty handy as well.

19:28.720 --> 19:32.400
I think in some keyboards, that's kind of a bonus feature just sort of thrown in as

19:32.400 --> 19:38.600
an afterthought, but having USB-C and USB-A makes me think it could be a great addition.

19:38.600 --> 19:41.500
Maybe you're using this keyboard at a mobile station where you just dock your laptop up

19:41.500 --> 19:43.800
in there and now you've got a few extra boards.

19:43.800 --> 19:44.800
Yeah.

19:44.800 --> 19:48.920
You mentioned also the developer aspect of being able to program the keys and things

19:48.920 --> 19:53.240
like that is pretty useful, but I think there could also be a use case for us in the studio

19:53.240 --> 19:56.760
when we're interacting with Reaper, our audio editor.

19:56.760 --> 20:01.380
You could potentially add like, you know, with Reaper you can set macros and actions

20:01.380 --> 20:04.400
that are a key combo that kick off a whole series of stuff.

20:04.400 --> 20:08.980
You could map that to some buttons on the launch and we could be flying through Reaper

20:08.980 --> 20:09.980
with our edit.

20:09.980 --> 20:11.880
That is a great idea.

20:11.880 --> 20:15.400
And you know that configuration tool, it's written in Rust.

20:15.400 --> 20:16.400
It is.

20:16.400 --> 20:19.080
And then you know what else is nice is that when you're done with the configuration tool,

20:19.080 --> 20:23.220
which looks really nice from the videos, we haven't tried it yet, but the videos make

20:23.220 --> 20:25.340
it look really simple and obvious to use.

20:25.340 --> 20:29.680
And then when you're done and you hit save, it actually writes that back to the keyboard

20:29.680 --> 20:30.680
firmware.

20:30.680 --> 20:33.880
You can pick the old keyboard up and go plug it into a different machine and all your mappings

20:33.880 --> 20:34.880
are still there.

20:34.880 --> 20:39.440
That's definitely a nice feature and one of those features you see on higher end keyboards.

20:39.440 --> 20:43.760
I don't think it's unique to System76 and that's true for a lot of the nice features

20:43.760 --> 20:44.760
on here.

20:44.760 --> 20:50.160
What I'm not so sure about is how big of a market for a keyboard this expensive is there?

20:50.160 --> 20:53.360
How much room in the market for System76 is there?

20:53.360 --> 20:57.440
And how good of a job are they going to be advertising outside of their main niche, which

20:57.440 --> 20:58.740
is frankly us.

20:58.740 --> 21:02.640
But there's a lot more mechanical keyboard users than people who are really focused on

21:02.640 --> 21:03.640
desktop Linux.

21:03.640 --> 21:04.640
Yeah, absolutely.

21:04.640 --> 21:05.640
That's a good point.

21:05.640 --> 21:08.820
I think the question you laid out there is how big is this market?

21:08.820 --> 21:12.200
We absolutely know there is a high end keyboard market.

21:12.200 --> 21:16.440
We've got a couple here in the studio and I pre-ordered one of these launches.

21:16.440 --> 21:19.280
So yes, it's a market that's obvious.

21:19.280 --> 21:20.720
How big though?

21:20.720 --> 21:25.400
How big is a $300 ish keyboard market?

21:25.400 --> 21:31.760
And I almost wonder if it doesn't really matter if it's that big or not, because as a company,

21:31.760 --> 21:36.040
it's not like they're necessarily ready today to take tens of thousands of orders and start

21:36.040 --> 21:39.120
cranking these things out by the tens of thousands, right?

21:39.120 --> 21:41.320
I mean, it's a brand new product.

21:41.320 --> 21:45.320
And as a business, they have to learn the process and procedures for procurement of

21:45.320 --> 21:49.400
the parts, for assembling and building it, for packaging it up and shipping it.

21:49.400 --> 21:51.280
And all of that is still new to them.

21:51.280 --> 21:54.080
And they probably, a slow ramp up would probably be ideal.

21:54.080 --> 21:57.480
I mean, I assume it's still new because we don't have review units.

21:57.480 --> 22:01.840
And if they could, they'd like to get review units out when the products announced so that

22:01.840 --> 22:04.080
way people can get information out there.

22:04.080 --> 22:07.480
And I get the sense it's a ramp up, Wes.

22:07.480 --> 22:13.280
And maybe a small market at a higher price point is a way to kind of cap how many orders

22:13.280 --> 22:14.360
come in.

22:14.360 --> 22:18.800
And then as you learn this thing and you don't really have to iterate much, so your initial

22:18.800 --> 22:24.720
R&D investment kind of starts to get paid off, maybe the price comes down 50 bucks or

22:24.720 --> 22:28.800
so in a year or maybe comes down 85 bucks in a year.

22:28.800 --> 22:32.680
I mean, maybe as time goes on and they don't have to redo this thing because a keyboard

22:32.680 --> 22:36.680
lasts for a long time, they recoup some of that initial cost, the price comes down a

22:36.680 --> 22:41.940
little bit and it kind of ends up in that sweet spot, Wes, where it's at a great price

22:41.940 --> 22:44.760
point and there's tons of people that are willing to pay that price and then it just

22:44.760 --> 22:46.560
takes off like gangbusters.

22:46.560 --> 22:48.880
And the reputation of it just sells itself.

22:48.880 --> 22:51.200
Yeah, I mean, it could go that way.

22:51.200 --> 22:54.720
I do think you've hit on some things though that this is going to be a learning experience

22:54.720 --> 22:58.740
for them, which is good as they continue to develop their hardware and they've already

22:58.740 --> 23:02.940
got some selection of manufacturing equipment in process and they'll be adding some things

23:02.940 --> 23:05.800
that they'll learn with this new development.

23:05.800 --> 23:10.200
So even if it isn't gangbusters, as long as they earn some money to recoup that expense,

23:10.200 --> 23:12.280
seems like it's really an investment in the future.

23:12.280 --> 23:14.800
But it sounds like you're kind of falling down on the side of you think it's probably

23:14.800 --> 23:16.600
going to remain kind of a niche product.

23:16.600 --> 23:20.860
Yeah, that's what I suspect, at least until they've got something a little further down

23:20.860 --> 23:24.440
the product line that you could actually just sell, you know, with most of the items that

23:24.440 --> 23:25.440
you ship.

23:25.440 --> 23:29.920
I want to know when they're going to make the system 76 mouse now.

23:29.920 --> 23:34.920
Or maybe like a launch keyboard, like accessory that like snaps on and has all these extra

23:34.920 --> 23:36.040
buttons.

23:36.040 --> 23:39.480
What about a 6k system 76 monitor at your desk?

23:39.480 --> 23:40.480
Yeah, there you go.

23:40.480 --> 23:43.000
