00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,480
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, our weekly take on Linux and the open source world.

2
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:21,240
This is episode 109, recorded on June 9th, 2019.

3
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:22,240
I'm Chris.

4
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:23,240
And I'm Joe.

5
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:24,240
Hello, Joe.

6
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:27,180
It's very good to be connected with you and I'm looking at our first couple of stories

7
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:32,880
and I'm thinking to myself, there is a couple of big themes developing in 2019.

8
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:35,260
And our first two stories are really about that.

9
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:37,080
Let's kick it off with the one about Firefox.

10
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:42,600
Yeah, this is Mozilla proudly announcing that Firefox now has enhanced tracking protection

11
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:44,040
by default.

12
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:46,240
If privacy isn't the buzzword of 2019.

13
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:47,240
I don't know what it is.

14
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:50,760
It is like what everybody's talking about from Facebook to Google right now.

15
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:55,120
But there's a couple of companies I genuinely believe when they talk about privacy and Mozilla

16
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:56,880
is one of them.

17
00:00:56,880 --> 00:01:01,320
They write on their blog this week, this past year, we've seen tech companies talk a big

18
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:05,980
game about privacy, as they realized that after several global scandals, people feel

19
00:01:05,980 --> 00:01:07,840
increasingly vulnerable.

20
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:11,960
They continue, it's unfortunate that this shift had to happen in order for tech companies

21
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:13,140
to take notice.

22
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:15,740
At Firefox, we're doing more than that.

23
00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:20,500
We believe that in order to truly protect people, we need to establish a new standard

24
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:22,400
that puts people's privacy first.

25
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:27,440
At Firefox, we have been working on setting this standard by offering privacy related

26
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:33,280
features like tracking protection in private browsing, long before these issues were brought

27
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:34,520
to light.

28
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:41,040
Today, Firefox will roll this feature out, as well as enhanced tracking protection to

29
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:44,200
all new users turned on by default.

30
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:46,200
This is exactly what Mozilla needs to be doing.

31
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:50,600
They can't compete with Chrome on features, they've kind of tried to compete on speed

32
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:55,280
and stuff, but ultimately, everybody knows that Google's business model is based around

33
00:01:55,280 --> 00:02:02,740
advertising and tracking and Firefox being completely open source has that advantage.

34
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:08,880
They can genuinely compete and I think that if Firefox stands any chance of regaining

35
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:11,720
some market share, then this is how they're going to do it.

36
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:15,800
They're in a unique market position here and it's great that they're leveraging this and

37
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:20,040
they also are talking a little bit about their Facebook container extension, which in my

38
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:24,160
opinion, if you're going to have a Facebook account, the only way to safely use Facebook

39
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:29,160
at this point in 2019 is with Firefox and the Facebook container extension.

40
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:31,160
So I'm a big fan.

41
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:35,120
They also are talking a little bit in this post about their new monitor service, which

42
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:37,560
we've covered previously in the show.

43
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:40,400
You remember that monitoring service lets you check your email address to see if it's

44
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,360
been compromised.

45
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:47,320
It's in association with the Have I Been Pwned database and they're bringing all these different

46
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:52,720
services together, privacy tracking, the Facebook container, the monitoring service and they're

47
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:56,360
saying this is Firefox.

48
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:58,880
I really like this.

49
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:00,340
I think this is super important.

50
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:03,320
At the same time, there's a couple of aspects that concern me.

51
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:04,720
You know, that's just who I am.

52
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:11,360
I mean, in total, I am more happy with Firefox than I've ever been and I am happier with

53
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:16,480
Mozilla than I've ever been in totality, but I do walk away with a couple of concerns nonetheless.

54
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:21,040
Number one, built-in content blocking is good.

55
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:25,500
I just am a little concerned about who's in control of the list of who gets blocked.

56
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:29,880
So we have some resources in our show notes if you're concerned about that as well.

57
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:31,360
Right now, it passes my sniff test.

58
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,140
I'll just put it that way.

59
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:37,440
Number two, the other thing that kind of worries me is I think this is a really important battle.

60
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,800
Privacy and protecting tracking online.

61
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:45,160
I just am concerned it's not enough to stem the tide of people switching to Chrome.

62
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:49,800
That's an important aspect of Firefox, but I don't think it's enough to prevent those

63
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:52,120
that are switching to Chrome from switching.

64
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:54,160
Well, surely it's got to be the other way around.

65
00:03:54,160 --> 00:04:00,440
It's got to be winning people back from Chrome and bringing them back to Firefox.

66
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:02,520
That surely has to be the goal.

67
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:07,680
I suppose the way you're looking at it is kind of try and stop the bleeding, whereas

68
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:11,600
I'm thinking more try and get the patient back to full fitness.

69
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:13,880
Yeah, I think you're right.

70
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:15,800
I could see it as an argument to come back.

71
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:19,080
Oh, you tried this other thing and now you're concerned about it tracking you.

72
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:21,800
Well, by the way, that's exactly what we've been working on.

73
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:22,800
Okay.

74
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:23,800
All right.

75
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:24,800
I could see that argument.

76
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:25,800
Is it enough though?

77
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:26,800
Is that enough?

78
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,080
Well, what else can they do?

79
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:29,560
I guess take it in full.

80
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:33,080
If you look at the big picture, which I think is what's important about this story, if you

81
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:37,720
look at all of 2019, it has been a strong year for Mozilla.

82
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:42,040
They've had a couple of missteps, but they have had solid Firefox release after Firefox

83
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:43,040
release.

84
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:47,640
When it comes to security, privacy, and performance, they have been killing it this year.

85
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:54,480
They've had a couple of not so awesome moments this year as well, but the core product has

86
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:55,880
just gotten better and better.

87
00:04:55,880 --> 00:05:00,620
I would argue that Edge switching over to Blink is probably a very bad thing that's

88
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:07,320
happened for Firefox this year, although that's kind of a double-edged sword because it does

89
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:13,680
make them stand out now as a project, it offers something different, but realistically, now

90
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:19,320
Google controls most of the web standards, so I don't know.

91
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:25,780
Maybe this is all wishful thinking that Firefox can actually regain some market share here.

92
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:27,440
That is a tough thing to watch.

93
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:33,480
So many times in our industry, we've seen not necessarily the best tech or the one that

94
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:38,200
is the most consumer-friendly tech win.

95
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:42,680
That sort of feels like a narrative that gets played out over and over again.

96
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:47,920
I look at the web with a bigger kind of picture perspective.

97
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:54,840
I've been using the internet since Mosaic, and I've watched Netscape become a thing and

98
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:55,840
die.

99
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:59,360
I've watched Firefox rise from the ashes of Netscape.

100
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:04,120
I have watched Internet Explorer become a thing, dominate the web and die, and now I'm

101
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:05,820
watching Chrome.

102
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:11,600
To me, it simply just feels like another phase of the web's development.

103
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:17,200
I look at people that stick with certain technologies long-term, like Firefox, as the long-term

104
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:19,080
players of the stock market.

105
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:23,280
People are hedging their bets on Firefox, and there's just a certain demo that's never

106
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:24,640
going to switch away.

107
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:29,320
For you existing users, Firefox is going to roll out that enhanced tracking protection

108
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:32,220
by default in the next coming months.

109
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:33,500
You don't have to change a thing.

110
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:35,720
It's not going to happen immediately.

111
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:39,600
But if you're like me and you're like, I kind of want to turn it on now, you can turn that

112
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:45,760
feature on by clicking on the little menu hamburger icon in the right of the browser.

113
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:49,400
If you go to the content blocking section, you'll see it there in the privacy preferences.

114
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:53,120
If you click on there, you can then go in there and mark cookies and all that kind of

115
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:58,120
stuff as privacy tracking protected, and you'll have all the features that Mozilla is rolling

116
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:00,760
out right now for brand new users of Firefox.

117
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:05,920
They will turn all of that stuff on eventually, but it's not on today by default.

118
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:12,280
And I say, for those of you that are hedging your bets that are holding on Firefox, just

119
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:13,480
keep investing.

120
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:17,840
Because so far, 2019 has been returning dividends like crazy.

121
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:19,760
It has gotten to be a great browser.

122
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:24,680
I have gone from it being my secondary browser to now it's once again my primary driver.

123
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:28,280
And I'm using Chrome as my second browser for all the Google properties.

124
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:31,120
And I don't think I'm alone in that.

125
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:34,320
I've heard a lot of feedback from the audience that says Firefox has gotten a lot better

126
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:35,320
this year.

127
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:39,080
So what you're saying is much like Bitcoin, with Firefox, you've got a huddle.

128
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:40,080
You got a hold, dude.

129
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:44,360
You got a hold.

130
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:47,200
Or you know, run them all like I do.

131
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:49,320
I'm just like, I just try them all.

132
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:52,160
I'm like a three, I just can't get by without three browsers.

133
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:53,160
I'm a three browser guy.

134
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:54,160
Hmm.

135
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:55,160
I've only got two installed at the moment.

136
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:58,960
I used to have Chromium and Chrome, but I've only got Chrome and Firefox now.

137
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:02,240
But I only use Chrome for stuff that needs it like Source Connect.

138
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:07,640
Well, while we're talking about like, big picture topics for 2019, privacy and each

139
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:11,080
Silicon Valley company trying to come up with their own privacy angle.

140
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:14,880
That's obviously one of the big picture topics, which is so funny coming from like the open

141
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:15,880
source Linux camp.

142
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:18,440
We'll just sit here and be like, hmm, that's cute.

143
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:19,440
Keep trying Facebook.

144
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:20,440
Keep trying Google.

145
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:21,440
That's adorable.

146
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:26,480
But there's been another huge, huge trend this year that I really wish one of us would

147
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:27,480
have predicted.

148
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:33,280
And that is the shift that software as a service is causing in the open source industry.

149
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:36,160
Yeah, we're seeing it with Redis and MongoDB.

150
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:40,880
And the latest project to change their license is CockroachDB.

151
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:45,820
And they are changing to the business source license, which is pretty funny, really.

152
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:50,600
It's almost an open source license, except you can do all of the normal stuff you can

153
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:55,040
with open source except for run it as a service.

154
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:58,080
Yeah, it's the reverse mullet license.

155
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:02,560
It's business up front, and it's party in the back, right?

156
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:07,440
So I think it's pretty good just to go right from the post over at cockroachlabs.com, which

157
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,360
we'll have linked in the notes.

158
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:12,520
CockroachDB was conceived as an open source software.

159
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:17,040
And they write, in the years since it appeared on GitHub, we've had to tread a relatively

160
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:22,200
typical path in balancing open source with creating a viable business.

161
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:26,920
We've kept our code under the Apache version 2 license, the APL.

162
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:33,080
We've launched a managed service and gated some features for established companies under

163
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:35,280
what is considered an enterprise license.

164
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:39,960
But our past outlook on the right business model relied on a crucial norm in the open

165
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:42,800
source world.

166
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:48,520
Companies could build a business around a strong open source core product without a

167
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:56,160
much larger technology platform company coming along and offering the same product as a service.

168
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:59,120
That norm no longer holds.

169
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:02,640
It sounds like their business model was wishful thinking when they write it like that.

170
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:03,640
Yeah.

171
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:04,640
Exactly.

172
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:11,040
But one thing about this business source license is that after three years, then that release

173
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:14,040
branch becomes properly open source.

174
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:17,640
So right around the time when everyone has moved off onto the next version.

175
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:20,780
Well, yeah, that's the party in the back that I was talking about.

176
00:10:20,780 --> 00:10:23,480
After three years, it goes back to the Apache license.

177
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:28,880
So it transitions from components being under the BSL to them being under the APL after

178
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:29,880
three years.

179
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:33,700
And I actually just went and did a bit of reading about this to try to get us a nice

180
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:35,400
concise breakdown.

181
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:42,980
So in concrete terms, Cockroach DB 19.2, which is currently tentatively scheduled for October

182
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:47,520
of this year, will be the first release that will use this new licensing scheme.

183
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:52,480
It will include code under both the BSL and the CCL.

184
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:59,840
Then in October of 2022, three years after its release, the portions of the Cockroach

185
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:04,640
DB 19.2 release under the BSL will convert to the APL.

186
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:06,440
So how about that, Joe?

187
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:11,840
It's restricted, but only for a limited period of time, and then after three years, you do

188
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:12,840
with what you want.

189
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:17,880
I mean, in terms of enterprise, three years really isn't that long.

190
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:21,400
This isn't super restrictive in enterprise timescales.

191
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:27,700
Well, that's true, but surely enterprise, when planning a deployment, are not going

192
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:31,240
to go for something like this when there are open source alternatives, because this is

193
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:33,280
not open source.

194
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:37,320
The source code is there, it is available, but would you take a risk on that?

195
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:41,600
If they've changed it once, then maybe they could change future versions to something

196
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,280
even more restrictive.

197
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:46,080
For me, I'd just be looking to move away from Cockroach DB.

198
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,080
Hmm.

199
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:48,080
Yeah, that's a good point.

200
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:52,660
I guess the only sort of caveat there would be this is how Maria or Mariah DB does it.

201
00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:55,000
They have a BSL license similar to this.

202
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,100
It's not quite the same implementation.

203
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:59,640
And that's been endorsed by the OSI founder, Bruce Perens.

204
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:05,080
Yeah, and the only thing that you can't do without buying a license is run it as a service.

205
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:11,120
But I do worry about those future versions and possibly them becoming more restrictive

206
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,120
with it.

207
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:14,800
So, no, I'm just, I'm not convinced.

208
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:23,120
Yeah, we're really witnessing a significant licensing transformation in 2019 that, looking

209
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:26,660
back at it, was obviously inevitable.

210
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:33,920
When you look at the success of the cloud, AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, of course they were

211
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:37,800
going to take some of this open source code and then reimplement it as a service and charge

212
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:38,800
a monthly fee.

213
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:42,000
Like, you would be almost foolish not to.

214
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,140
This was clearly coming.

215
00:12:43,140 --> 00:12:45,520
This reckoning was obvious.

216
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:49,360
And you've seen some, you've seen just as this year has gone on, you've just seen this

217
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:50,580
build and build.

218
00:12:50,580 --> 00:12:53,400
And now we're at the point where people have to take heart breaks.

219
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:55,880
They have to just make a huge change.

220
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:59,680
And it's, I don't know, it's just like it's happening in front of everybody.

221
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:00,680
It's so public.

222
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:02,040
It's really interesting to watch.

223
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:05,240
Well, the whole cloud market's been very interesting to watch.

224
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:10,480
And something that I didn't see coming at all was Microsoft and Oracle working together

225
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:13,440
to link up Azure and Oracle Cloud.

226
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:14,720
Literally link them up.

227
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:17,300
Like a physical connection between the clouds.

228
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:18,300
Isn't that fascinating?

229
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:19,300
This is actually pretty deep.

230
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:23,520
Microsoft and Oracle announced a new alliance that will see the two companies directly connect

231
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:29,440
their data centers with a direct network connection so that users can move workloads between the

232
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:30,440
two clouds.

233
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:36,000
The other thing I didn't really see coming was the huge response to this story.

234
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:40,080
Like even in our own community, like a lot of people are talking about this.

235
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:46,280
I find this entire thing fascinating because it's sort of like the B and C players of the

236
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:50,960
cloud coming together to form an alliance that goes beyond just like basic integration

237
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:54,560
and to a whole new level of data center connectivity.

238
00:13:54,560 --> 00:14:00,280
And for Oracle, the alliance means that its users can run services like Oracle eBusiness

239
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:08,400
Suite or the Oracle JD Edwards on the Azure services while still using Oracle databases

240
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:12,080
in the Oracle cloud that they've been paying for now for probably a couple of years.

241
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:17,600
And Microsoft gets in on the action of running some Oracle workloads on their servers while

242
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:25,560
still being able to utilize legit, genuine Oracle hosted Oracle database software.

243
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:28,000
You know, not something that probably appeals to you and I.

244
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:34,520
Like I personally avoided Oracle like the plague, not out of any kind of disrespect

245
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:38,680
to Oracle or the people that work on it, but just never an area I wanted to go into.

246
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:41,380
I felt like that was a rabbit hole I would never get out of.

247
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:44,640
But I could really see like if I'm trying to move this crap up to the cloud and then

248
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:49,480
these two guys get working together and the other thing that makes us kind of nice is

249
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:51,600
they will also share identity.

250
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:56,920
So if you are authenticated, say in the Oracle cloud, those authentication credentials will

251
00:14:56,920 --> 00:15:00,900
carry over to the Azure cloud and vice versa.

252
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:01,900
That's neat.

253
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:05,200
And it's probably some sort of like hosted active directory underneath it all.

254
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:08,140
This is quite limited to start with, though.

255
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:15,680
It's only Azure US East and Oracle's Ashburn data centers, but the plan is to expand this.

256
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:20,140
I was thinking about Microsoft's motivations for this and one of our research team dug

257
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:30,960
up some very interesting numbers from canalysis from February 2019 showing that in 2018, AWS

258
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:34,720
had about 32% market share.

259
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:37,680
Azure had about half of that roughly.

260
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:45,000
What's really interesting is the growth and how AWS has been growing at about 47% versus

261
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,240
Azure growing at 82%.

262
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:54,280
And so although AWS is the massive market leader, Microsoft is starting to gain on them

263
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:58,640
and Google as well have gotten huge growth of nearly 94%.

264
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:06,360
So it is a very dynamic market and I always think of it as AWS and the rest, but it seems

265
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:09,040
that that is shifting.

266
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:11,040
You know, I can't argue that.

267
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:17,120
I think it has been AWS and the rest, and I think it is shifting and that's interesting.

268
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:21,720
And the reason why I feel that way is I've just recently attended Linux Fest Northwest

269
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:27,540
Scale Red Hat Summit and now Texas Linux Fest as well as a couple of other intermediary

270
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:36,600
meetups and conferences and there is undoubtedly a common consistent theme in all of these

271
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:37,600
events.

272
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:41,700
Jeez, I feel like I'm coming to confessional right now because you have to understand my

273
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:47,360
background has been in traditional IT where I have set up infrastructures for companies

274
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:52,680
and I've built like super awesome setups with like local storage and virtualization.

275
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:59,360
So for me, like it feels like a loss to be moving away from that, but it is just no question

276
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:00,360
about it, Joe.

277
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:02,980
No, I mean, just zero.

278
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:06,520
And then when you expand out to all of the other events our whole team has gone to this

279
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:10,480
year, the common theme is moving workloads to the cloud.

280
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:14,240
And I mean, that's only simply validated by how much IBM was willing to pay for Red Hat

281
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:19,000
because they believe that a lot of shops with traditional workloads are going to move to

282
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
the cloud.

283
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:24,880
And in that world, it's just getting started.

284
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:33,760
And Microsoft has a huge, huge, huge on-premises advantage with Active Directory and SQL and

285
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:36,880
SharePoint and Exchange.

286
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:43,520
Just those products alone are industry defining and if they can get people that are hooked

287
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:49,960
into those ecosystems to transition to Azure, I mean, they're going to give AWS a run for

288
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:54,800
its money because for everybody that's signing up for some cloud service, there are small

289
00:17:54,800 --> 00:18:00,320
businesses and medium businesses and enterprises all over the world that are running their

290
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:04,760
own infrastructure that one day are going to move to the cloud.

291
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:10,400
And so, so, so many of them are using these franchise of products and for Microsoft to

292
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:15,120
be getting their crap together right now is perfect timing.

293
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:20,480
Like, they're not behind the ball here at all, it's just getting started.

294
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:23,880
The party is just, just getting started.

295
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:27,320
And IBM knows it too, that's why they're willing to spend so much on Red Hat because there's

296
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:33,760
still time to carve out a nice, healthy part of the market as the rest of, or what Ginny

297
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:39,060
at IBM calls the CEO of IBM, which she says is the next 80%, like the hardest stuff.

298
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:42,800
The stuff that everybody avoided moving to the cloud is now what they're working on moving

299
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:43,800
over.

300
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:50,000
And it kind of makes me sad a little bit because that means some of my past clients are moving

301
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:54,920
some of the really, really, really cool infrastructure I built for them over to the cloud and they're

302
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:55,920
no longer going to need it.

303
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:56,920
They're going to retire that stuff.

304
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:58,640
And I built it to last forever.

305
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:00,080
I'm really proud of it.

306
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:01,640
But that's just what it is, dude.

307
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:02,640
Yeah.

308
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:06,960
If you listen very, very carefully, you can hear a million sys admins quietly crying themselves

309
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:07,960
to sleep.

310
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:13,180
We didn't have like a meetup, like we would just get together and like just sort of have

311
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:18,040
like a, I don't know, like a moment where we pour one out.

312
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:23,280
Well, we mentioned Google Cloud, but at the other end of their business is Android.

313
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:29,360
And we talked about them being forced to cut Huawei off, but Google seems to be trying

314
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:35,040
to fight back against this by trying to claim that it's a national security risk.

315
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:37,000
But I'm somewhat skeptical, I must say.

316
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Are you?

317
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Oh, interesting.

318
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Okay.

319
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,160
Well, I'm going to say I actually follow Google's logic here.

320
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:50,560
So, Google has been arguing that by stopping Google from dealing with Huawei, the US is

321
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:55,080
risking creating two kinds of Android operating systems in the wild.

322
00:19:55,080 --> 00:20:00,600
The genuine version that Google maintains and then some random hybrid version that Huawei

323
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:02,160
is containing or maintaining.

324
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:03,160
Right.

325
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:04,600
And I completely agree up to that point.

326
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:05,600
Yeah.

327
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:06,600
That is obvious.

328
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:07,600
Yeah.

329
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:08,600
Okay.

330
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:09,600
But don't you think that does seem like right there bad?

331
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:14,280
I mean, the hybrid one is likely to have bugs or security issues that Google would be on

332
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:15,280
top of.

333
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:18,640
They have teams of people at Google that are fixing that stuff.

334
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:24,400
And there's no guarantee that Huawei or any other OEM would be on top of fixing that stuff.

335
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:27,360
And you could be putting even more users at risk then.

336
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:28,800
I can see the argument here.

337
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:32,680
I can see the argument and I can see why you would lead with that and not the underlying

338
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:33,960
motivation.

339
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:34,960
Call me cynical.

340
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:40,200
But we talked about the cloud market, there's 80% left to expand into.

341
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:42,360
Not so much with mobile.

342
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:46,440
The smartphone market in the West is basically saturated at this point.

343
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:49,560
And we see the likes of Apple having to move into services.

344
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:55,200
However, in countries where Huawei are selling their devices, there is still potentially

345
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:58,280
huge growth to be had.

346
00:20:58,280 --> 00:21:03,680
And if that is happening with a version of Android that doesn't have all the Google play

347
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:06,440
stuff in it, then Google loses out.

348
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:11,440
That's why they built Android to put the Google play services and their whole business model

349
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:12,440
of tracking and advertising.

350
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:14,360
Well, see, I disagree.

351
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:17,360
I think they, well, they purchased Android.

352
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:20,640
And I think initially they thought, this is going to be great.

353
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:27,460
We'll have a competitor to Apple just based on just massive open source evolution.

354
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:32,120
And then they realized to be competitive and to be dynamic in the mobile market, you need

355
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:36,400
to actually have some control over the hardware OEMs because they're going to do crap to ship

356
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:42,240
actual updates and security patches for their end users, unless you hit them over the head

357
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:46,360
with policies and rules and restrictions and contracts.

358
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:49,160
And then you combine in the patent wars and whatnot.

359
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:56,040
And I just don't see a reality where a company like Huawei or Purism or anybody else could

360
00:21:56,040 --> 00:22:01,240
really truly maintain a mobile operating system at the scale that Google can.

361
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:05,320
Even when it's Google's own operating system, they'll always be playing catch up.

362
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:09,600
And I think I don't really need to cite much more than just the history of Android to just

363
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:11,080
say that this has been played out.

364
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:16,520
This is like when you look at the Android marketplace now, the most up to date, secure,

365
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:18,920
feature rich phones are the Pixel phones.

366
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:20,480
Yeah, you're right.

367
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:22,880
But that doesn't mean the other thing isn't true as well.

368
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:25,040
This is not a binary situation.

369
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:28,080
Their motivations can be twofold here, I think.

370
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:32,080
This also kind of implies that Huawei was going to fork Android, where when they made

371
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:36,120
their statement, Huawei had said publicly that they had been working on getting their

372
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:40,260
own operating system ready, just in case they got caught off from Android.

373
00:22:40,260 --> 00:22:45,320
And they said that they felt like it was ready for customers as soon as this year, and that

374
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:49,400
they could even be ready for the US and the rest of the world by 2020.

375
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:53,580
I didn't even really think about it much, but it must be a fork of Android.

376
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:55,120
And Google's kind of outing that here.

377
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:59,400
Well, yeah, it must be at least the ROM based on AOSP, which I suppose you could call a

378
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:01,120
fork here.

379
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:04,080
And maybe Google knows a bit more than we do on this.

380
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:08,160
But you're a daily lineage user, so you're essentially living the lifestyle.

381
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:09,160
Yeah.

382
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:13,480
And you know, but I've manually flashed Google apps on there, where most people wouldn't

383
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:14,480
do that.

384
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:18,120
Do you feel confident that lineage stays on top of all of the security issues?

385
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:19,120
Yeah.

386
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:21,280
Would you feel confident that Huawei would or Motorola?

387
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:26,560
I guess Motorola's a bad example, but if it was an independent Android manufacturer,

388
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:28,280
would you have that same level of confidence?

389
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:31,640
Or do you trust lineage because it's an open source community?

390
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:37,800
I do trust lineage more, and the updates come faster, but with that comes a slight lack

391
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:38,800
of stability.

392
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:44,200
But I mean, I don't see why Huawei couldn't do it if they wanted to put the resources

393
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:45,200
in.

394
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:47,380
I mean, it's just developer hours, basically.

395
00:23:47,380 --> 00:23:49,760
If they spend the money, then they can do it.

396
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:53,160
I think they might be able to convince me if they were starting with something like

397
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:58,200
lineage, but if it's from scratch, in-house, I'm going to be pretty skeptical.

398
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:02,940
Even if it's an in-house remix of Android, pretty skeptical.

399
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:08,400
Maybe lineage, I just, I actually, I think Google's argument here is sound.

400
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:11,120
I think with Huawei, it's an unknown.

401
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:15,160
They may be able to maintain their own OS and keep it up to date and keep users secure

402
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:17,320
and relatively patched.

403
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:19,120
That's a maybe.

404
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:23,560
But it's a pretty well established, known with Google, that if you sign up with Google

405
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:26,440
and you play ball, you will get access to these updates.

406
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:28,760
You can get these as fast as you can roll them out.

407
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:31,840
And that is, today, a known quantity.

408
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:33,820
It's a known guaranteed.

409
00:24:33,820 --> 00:24:38,600
And it does make the US more vulnerable if a whole bunch of devices are running a version

410
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:42,560
of Android that is not kept up to date or as secure.

411
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:47,280
It's a maybe, but Google's argument in terms of like, you know for, it's just, it's guaranteed.

412
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:50,040
Like as far as Android gets.

413
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:51,760
Not being a huge Android fan myself.

414
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:52,760
Yeah, I suppose so.

415
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:55,760
I've got a trivia question for you though.

416
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:57,040
Oh, all right.

417
00:24:57,040 --> 00:25:00,680
Android initially was not made for phones.

418
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:01,680
What was it made for?

419
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:02,680
Hmm.

420
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:03,680
Oh, gosh.

421
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:05,840
I think I probably knew this at one point.

422
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:10,440
I'm thinking it was designed with a pointing device in mind and for Java devices.

423
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:16,020
But I can't really use that to kind of get to what it must have been designed for.

424
00:25:16,020 --> 00:25:18,520
Maybe like a PC-type device?

425
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:19,520
What?

426
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:20,520
All right.

427
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:21,520
I'm going to give you multiple choice then.

428
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:26,760
Do you think it was ATM software, cameras, or point-of-sale systems?

429
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:27,760
Hmm.

430
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:28,760
Hmm.

431
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:30,840
I'm going to say point-of-sale systems because the cursor.

432
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:34,400
Like ATMs don't need a cursor, but a point-of-sale system like might.

433
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:36,400
No, it was cameras.

434
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:37,880
Oh, really?

435
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:38,880
Yeah.

436
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:40,400
Originally developed for cameras.

437
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:41,400
Yeah.

438
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:42,400
And then pivoted to phones.

439
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:43,400
How did I not know that?

440
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:47,360
You know, how did I not know that before I had to look it up recently for the live show

441
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:48,360
we did at the weekend?

442
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:51,520
I actually would have thought it wasn't for cameras just because of the whole pointer

443
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:54,560
device thing and the whole history of Java applications.

444
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:59,720
But my knowledge and real like tracking of Android didn't start until Google purchased

445
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:00,720
Android.

446
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:01,720
Yeah.

447
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:02,720
I think a lot of people are in that situation.

448
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:03,720
Yeah.

449
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:07,560
Speaking of Google though, I think they sucked me in on this next one.

450
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:08,560
Really?

451
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:09,560
Yeah.

452
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:12,720
So they announced some details for Stadia and you're actually going to buy into it.

453
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:13,720
Yeah.

454
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:16,160
And it's red flagging all over the place.

455
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:20,200
This service is like, as you learn more about it, it becomes less and less appealing and

456
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:21,520
that's never a good sign.

457
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:23,080
You know what I mean?

458
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:24,080
Yeah.

459
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:26,080
This is their cloud gaming service, of course.

460
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:27,080
Yeah.

461
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:32,840
And they announced some pricing, which if you want to get in straight away in November,

462
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:37,080
then you have to buy the founder's edition, which is like 130 bucks.

463
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:38,080
Yeah.

464
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:39,080
Up front.

465
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:42,200
And then it'll be 9.99 after three months.

466
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:48,520
And if you want to get early access, like in 2019, the only way to get early access

467
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:50,960
is through this package.

468
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:55,240
It's available for pre-order right now on the Google store for like Joe said, about

469
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:56,240
130 bucks.

470
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:59,680
And you'll get a controller, which is a limited edition.

471
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:05,280
You get a Chromecast Ultra, which is a Chromecast that supports 4K and 60 frames a second.

472
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:09,720
And then you'll get three months of Stadia pro service as well as a buddy pass.

473
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:12,720
So maybe I'll give you a buddy pass, Joe.

474
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:16,840
And you get first dibs on your Stadia name too, which is it's interesting that they're

475
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:21,040
putting that in there as a selling aspect.

476
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:25,820
So yeah, in 2019, users will be unable to sign up for this pros level service where

477
00:27:25,820 --> 00:27:31,960
you get 4K and 60 frames a second without being in the founder's edition hardware package.

478
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:38,680
And I decided to pull the trigger and purchase it because I think it's going to actually

479
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:42,920
help me use a full open source stack on my desktop.

480
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:46,160
And that was sort of my deciding factor recently.

481
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:47,680
I'll tell you why here in a second.

482
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:51,360
But just a couple of things that I thought I'd pass along is Google has changed a couple

483
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:54,680
of the bits of details about their Stadia game streaming service as well.

484
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:58,980
They're now recommending that you have at least 10 megabits, which is up slightly for

485
00:27:58,980 --> 00:28:01,600
Stadia to work properly.

486
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:04,600
You'll get at least 720p and 60 frames per second.

487
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:10,660
Pro users, the plan that I just signed up for, will want 35 megabits per second.

488
00:28:10,660 --> 00:28:14,440
And streaming quality is going to sort of scale depending on how good that is.

489
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:19,340
You'll be able to use any desktop, laptop, or even a tablet that can run the desktop

490
00:28:19,340 --> 00:28:23,880
version of Chrome or Chromebook that can run the desktop version of Chrome.

491
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:28,320
And then they'll have mobile support for the Pixel 3 and 3a at launch.

492
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:32,840
And Google says they will expand to other phones over time.

493
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:40,000
But the part in there that got me was any Chrome desktop browser.

494
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,960
I've been doing something recently, you know, because I've talked to you about it off air

495
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:44,520
and I've talked a little bit about it on air.

496
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:49,000
But for the last few weeks, I've just been having a blast messing around finally after

497
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:53,520
all these years with PCIe pass-through and KVM.

498
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:58,880
And I've got a virtualized Windows 10 desktop right now where I'm passing through a Thunderbolt

499
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:04,280
3 docking station that has an NVIDIA GPU and some Ethernet and some USB and some DisplayPort

500
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:05,280
built into it.

501
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:09,840
So the whole dock, the entire dock is dedicated to my VM.

502
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:15,160
And so I can plug in one PCI, or I'm sorry, Thunderbolt 3 cable, which is essentially

503
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:20,600
PCI Express, into my ThinkPad and it's just dedicated to the VM.

504
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:25,320
And the brilliant thing about it is I don't have to have any crappy proprietary drivers

505
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:26,980
on the host system.

506
00:29:26,980 --> 00:29:32,200
So my laptop is running Fedora with all open source software.

507
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:37,920
The graphics stack, everything is open source and just is super solid and reliable.

508
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:43,420
And all the proprietary driver crap for the NVIDIA card and all that stuff is all isolated

509
00:29:43,420 --> 00:29:45,460
in the VM.

510
00:29:45,460 --> 00:29:47,120
Doesn't mess up my host system at all.

511
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:52,720
So I have brilliant stability with a great XFCE desktop on the ThinkPad T480 and then

512
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:58,080
I can abuse the crap out of this Windows 10 VM, which has a dedicated monitor, keyboard

513
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:04,360
and mouse, dedicated Ethernet, all of it, and the drivers installed and have at it.

514
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:09,040
But this, this would let me get rid of the VM.

515
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:13,480
Then I could still have a totally open source driver stack on my desktop and still play

516
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:15,120
the video games.

517
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:17,960
It's one level even better for me.

518
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:21,120
And I know a lot of people are skeptical about game streaming.

519
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:26,680
I was too, having messed around with OnLive when that was a thing and GeForce Now on my

520
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:31,180
Shield, I've actually had a great time streaming games.

521
00:30:31,180 --> 00:30:35,400
For me, it's been a good experience so far and I'm willing to give this a go.

522
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:41,760
If I can run 100% open source software on my desktop and the only trade is a $9 a month

523
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:46,560
subscription to Google to be able to stream video games where I want to play them, that's

524
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:47,560
a good value.

525
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:52,520
So I decided to buy the founder's package so I could get in there and test it and let

526
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:55,000
the audience know if this is really a thing.

527
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:58,680
And then they know when it comes out for free or if they want to get the $9 a month or whatever,

528
00:30:58,680 --> 00:30:59,800
they know if it's worth it or not.

529
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:03,920
You said completely open source software, a bit of an asterisk, you do need Chrome.

530
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:09,040
Not only Chrome, Joe, but I bet you also need some decoding of the HD64 video stream.

531
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:11,840
So there are compromises in there, you're right.

532
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:16,320
So what do you make of this phased rollout, which is essentially what they're doing here,

533
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:21,560
by making it $130 up front, it means that you're not going to have anywhere near the

534
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:26,600
number of people where if it was just $10 a month, that to me says that, well, it says

535
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:27,600
two things.

536
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:34,100
It says, one, they want to be careful with this and want to see how it goes and how much

537
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:37,980
resources are actually required to do this.

538
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:41,280
But it also says to me that maybe they're not confident in the infrastructure that they've

539
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:42,280
got.

540
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:43,280
Yeah.

541
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:44,280
That's what I read too.

542
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:52,600
You also have a bit of a selection bias because not everybody can afford $130 and you are

543
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:54,900
guaranteeing a couple of aspects.

544
00:31:54,900 --> 00:31:57,440
You're guaranteeing they're going to have a certain controller and that they're going

545
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:06,180
to be on a Chromecast Ultra, which will narrow the fragmentation and sort of make the initial

546
00:32:06,180 --> 00:32:09,040
rollout probably a little smoother, I would imagine.

547
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:13,760
So I think Google is mitigating their risks by gating it like this.

548
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:19,320
And they claim that after a certain period of time in 2020, they're going to announce

549
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:24,280
a free tier that doesn't require any monthly subscription at all, but you'll just have

550
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:25,280
to pay for the games.

551
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:31,560
What I'm really hoping is for a lot more detail on the backend Linux side of things and the

552
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:36,280
technologies that they're working on and seeing them upstream stuff, because that's the big

553
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:40,520
hope here that we'll all benefit from this.

554
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:46,200
We did get a little more details on this round, Stadia games run on a custom Linux based server

555
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:49,240
hardware that is maintained by Google.

556
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:53,160
It promises 10.7 teraflops of power.

557
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:59,600
In each instance, game audio and video will be streamed to those servers, then to a user's

558
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:04,240
device from there and inputs are streamed from the user's device to the server over

559
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:11,640
a network of what Google says are 7,500 edge nodes around the world to reduce latency.

560
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:13,120
I'm going to give it a go.

561
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:19,640
My $130 controller and Chromecast Ultra, both of which I don't want, I'd much rather just

562
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:25,800
use like a Xbox or PS4 controller and my Chrome browser on my desktop.

563
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:29,760
But when I do get it in November, I'll let you know what I think and I'll probably do

564
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:30,760
a review on Linux Unplugged.

565
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:34,400
I wonder if they're going to be like your typical crowd funder and then just keep pushing

566
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:38,160
it back and back and back or whether they'll actually deliver on this November deadline.

567
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:41,760
I think they're going to deliver because they're making deals with game publishers, you know,

568
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:46,160
so they're going to have some commitments in paper that they have to deliver on.

569
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:49,000
Either way, I suppose we'll be monitoring.

570
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:53,480
