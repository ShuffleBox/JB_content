Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, our weekly take on Linux and the open source world.

00:16.100 --> 00:20.200
This is episode 80, recorded on November 18th, 2018.

00:20.200 --> 00:21.200
I'm Chris.

00:21.200 --> 00:22.200
And I'm Joe.

00:22.200 --> 00:23.200
Hello, Joe.

00:23.200 --> 00:24.200
It's good to be connected with you.

00:24.200 --> 00:26.120
We have a bunch of news today.

00:26.120 --> 00:30.480
Let's start it off with the new Raspberry Pi.

00:30.480 --> 00:34.680
Maybe it's not the one you were expecting, but it may be one you end up wanting.

00:34.680 --> 00:37.320
Yeah, the Raspberry Pi 3 Model A Plus.

00:37.320 --> 00:39.460
It's a bit of a mouthful.

00:39.460 --> 00:46.320
And it's essentially just a cut down version of the 3B Plus, except that it's smaller,

00:46.320 --> 00:51.020
it doesn't have as many USB ports, and it's got half the amount of RAM.

00:51.020 --> 00:52.020
And it's cheaper.

00:52.020 --> 00:53.020
Right.

00:53.020 --> 00:58.060
It comes in at 25 US greenbacks, and it is a little strange to have a brand new model

00:58.060 --> 01:03.760
that has slightly less specs, but it's perfectly formed, as they say.

01:03.760 --> 01:05.960
It's really a great size.

01:05.960 --> 01:12.500
It's almost just a square size with a much denser sort of form factor.

01:12.500 --> 01:16.780
And you could sort of say it might be the most eloquent Raspberry Pi.

01:16.780 --> 01:20.720
In fact, in a way, it's sort of their goodbye to this entire architecture.

01:20.720 --> 01:22.600
It's their one last hurrah.

01:22.600 --> 01:24.980
And at $25, it's not bad.

01:24.980 --> 01:34.040
It's at 1.4 gigahertz, 64-bit quad-core ARM Cortex A53 CPU, has 512 megabytes of LPDDR2

01:34.040 --> 01:42.240
RAM, it has a dual band 802.11 AC wireless LAN, and it also has Bluetooth 4.2 BLE.

01:42.240 --> 01:46.520
Supposedly, they say they've improved the mass storage booting and the thermal management

01:46.520 --> 01:47.520
as well.

01:47.520 --> 01:50.480
Don't have any hands on with that yet, but that would also be a welcome addition to this

01:50.480 --> 01:51.480
unit.

01:51.480 --> 01:53.080
That really was pretty great.

01:53.080 --> 01:57.760
And if this is their goodbye to this architecture, if this is sort of the last hurrah, I think

01:57.760 --> 01:59.040
this is a pretty good one.

01:59.040 --> 02:00.040
And they convinced me.

02:00.040 --> 02:01.760
I ordered one this morning.

02:01.760 --> 02:05.240
For me, though, this is more about embedding it in projects.

02:05.240 --> 02:09.800
Because if anything, we want more RAM, don't we, rather than less?

02:09.800 --> 02:11.280
Only 512.

02:11.280 --> 02:16.120
That's really not much to do any sort of desktop or media center type work.

02:16.120 --> 02:23.040
Really, this is for putting in headless projects, camera stuff, things that need a bit more

02:23.040 --> 02:27.800
CPU for a bit of image processing, maybe, but don't necessarily need all the RAM.

02:27.800 --> 02:31.840
And don't need all the ports, because it's just going to be sitting, doing a time-lapse

02:31.840 --> 02:34.040
or something like that.

02:34.040 --> 02:39.800
So I don't see what you're going to use it for if you've already got a 3B.

02:39.800 --> 02:43.200
I actually have a couple of ideas, a couple of projects.

02:43.200 --> 02:46.200
Both of them would be quasi-embedded.

02:46.200 --> 02:51.840
So one of them is kind of like a Christmas gift package idea I have with the kids to

02:51.840 --> 02:55.040
build a little Raspberry Pi computer to play retro games.

02:55.040 --> 02:59.400
They've been really getting into retro Nintendo games, and they don't have a great way to

02:59.400 --> 03:00.680
play them right now.

03:00.680 --> 03:07.000
So I've ordered a couple of cool retro Super Nintendo controllers, USB controllers, and

03:07.000 --> 03:10.080
put this together in a little case hooked up to a TV screen.

03:10.080 --> 03:11.860
And they just helped me assemble it all.

03:11.860 --> 03:16.080
And I did some research into the ROM community, and people think 512 megs of RAM is still

03:16.080 --> 03:18.700
going to be plenty for what I'm trying to do.

03:18.700 --> 03:20.380
So it looks like it's got enough headroom there.

03:20.380 --> 03:27.160
The second use case is more of a home assistant bridging of some automation systems so I can

03:27.160 --> 03:31.720
have local LAN control without internet connection and work with some of these proprietary devices

03:31.720 --> 03:33.160
and services.

03:33.160 --> 03:37.240
And I don't think I need a lot of headroom there, but that's going to be the most tricky

03:37.240 --> 03:41.280
because it's a pretty beefy app, and it's going to need a full Linux subsystem underneath

03:41.280 --> 03:42.280
it.

03:42.280 --> 03:45.000
So that's going to be the biggest edge case, but that's what I want to test.

03:45.000 --> 03:51.760
How far can I get when they build a model for $25 and its biggest limitation is 512

03:51.760 --> 03:52.760
megabytes of RAM?

03:52.760 --> 03:54.780
I like this form factor better.

03:54.780 --> 03:58.840
This looks like a more refined device, and I'm curious how far I can push it.

03:58.840 --> 04:00.640
I feel like I'm up for the challenge.

04:00.640 --> 04:02.300
Okay, fair enough.

04:02.300 --> 04:07.480
It sits between the Zero and the Zero W. I mean, I don't think anyone would get a Zero

04:07.480 --> 04:10.900
at this point because it doesn't have the Wi-Fi on it.

04:10.900 --> 04:18.280
So it kind of sits between that $10-ish Zero W and then the $35 3B+.

04:18.280 --> 04:23.280
So I think you have to have a specific implementation in mind, really, to not spend that extra $10

04:23.280 --> 04:24.720
for the $35 one.

04:24.720 --> 04:28.200
That's what I would do because why not just have twice the RAM?

04:28.200 --> 04:29.840
Or you're trying to reach a certain scale.

04:29.840 --> 04:33.560
Maybe you're doing like a large educational program and you're buying 5,000 of them at

04:33.560 --> 04:34.720
a time, something like that.

04:34.720 --> 04:35.720
Oh, yeah.

04:35.720 --> 04:36.760
Yeah, that kind of makes sense, yeah.

04:36.760 --> 04:40.540
One of the other reasons I bought this sucker was because this is a platform.

04:40.540 --> 04:45.240
These Raspberry Pis, or maybe not even the best deal, they're not the most performant

04:45.240 --> 04:48.760
devices, but they are a standard.

04:48.760 --> 04:53.120
And I know that there are projects out there today that exist already that I can just throw

04:53.120 --> 04:56.720
on these things and they're ready to go and I can have this thing live in the corner of

04:56.720 --> 04:59.680
the studio and it'll just plug away forever.

04:59.680 --> 05:03.520
These next generation of devices that they kind of hint at here, they talk about them

05:03.520 --> 05:06.080
being a different architecture, a different breed of device.

05:06.080 --> 05:10.360
I mean, maybe we'll call it Raspberry Pi 4, but it's not going to be the Raspberry Pi

05:10.360 --> 05:11.960
that we all know.

05:11.960 --> 05:15.840
And that was another compelling reason for me to buy this one because it's going to be

05:15.840 --> 05:19.080
supported for years by all these open source projects.

05:19.080 --> 05:25.000
The implications of a new architecture do have me thinking what I'd really like to see

05:25.000 --> 05:30.360
in a future Raspberry Pi because these are a platform and buying the Raspberry Pi has

05:30.360 --> 05:32.360
a whole other lot of implications.

05:32.360 --> 05:36.920
There's an accessory ecosystem, there's a lot of educational opportunities, open source

05:36.920 --> 05:37.920
projects.

05:37.920 --> 05:42.400
But it matters that the Raspberry Pi have a wide range of product categories, I think.

05:42.400 --> 05:48.500
And I would love to see maybe a $55 Raspberry Pi or a $75 Raspberry Pi.

05:48.500 --> 05:50.340
What could we do with that?

05:50.340 --> 05:54.080
Keep the $25 and the $10 around forever as well.

05:54.080 --> 05:57.840
But what if we opened up this range when we go to this new architecture?

05:57.840 --> 06:01.920
What kind of things with Linux built in could we start seeing if we had even more power

06:01.920 --> 06:04.560
in what has become a common platform?

06:04.560 --> 06:08.120
I think that you're dreaming there, unfortunately.

06:08.120 --> 06:12.960
When I spoke to Eben about this, when the Raspberry Pi 3 came out, not the Plus, but

06:12.960 --> 06:18.040
the original 3, I talked to him about that only having one gigabyte of RAM and trying

06:18.040 --> 06:21.600
to up that to two and up the specs and everything.

06:21.600 --> 06:28.720
And he said that they are determined to keep it at $35 and cap it at that.

06:28.720 --> 06:31.640
And so that then becomes a limiting factor.

06:31.640 --> 06:36.460
Because this Broadcom chipset that they're using only supports up to a gigabyte of RAM,

06:36.460 --> 06:40.360
that means that they would have to change the complete innards of this thing.

06:40.360 --> 06:41.360
Maybe they will.

06:41.360 --> 06:44.520
Maybe that's what some of this implications of the new architecture are.

06:44.520 --> 06:45.780
But I follow what your meaning is.

06:45.780 --> 06:48.860
This is their goal is the pricing is paramount.

06:48.860 --> 06:51.160
That's one of their biggest priorities when they're building this thing is keeping it

06:51.160 --> 06:52.440
at that low price point.

06:52.440 --> 06:54.960
And I say fair enough.

06:54.960 --> 06:57.960
That's been good for them and that's good for people that want to get into these things

06:57.960 --> 06:58.960
at a low price.

06:58.960 --> 07:01.400
So who am I to say that they should build a more expensive one?

07:01.400 --> 07:03.440
There's plenty of alternatives out there, like I said earlier.

07:03.440 --> 07:04.440
Well, yeah, there's tons.

07:04.440 --> 07:07.320
And a lot of them have Pi in the name to try and cash in on it.

07:07.320 --> 07:13.280
But yeah, really, you're looking at possibly a slightly faster system on a chip with maybe

07:13.280 --> 07:15.000
two gigabytes of RAM.

07:15.000 --> 07:20.640
But this idea of having USB 3.0 and proper gigabit Ethernet and everything, I think people

07:20.640 --> 07:22.400
are dreaming there for $35.

07:22.400 --> 07:26.580
It's going to be at least another couple of generations before the other components come

07:26.580 --> 07:29.720
down low enough to enable them to do that.

07:29.720 --> 07:32.480
Because $35 is not a lot of money, is it?

07:32.480 --> 07:33.480
No.

07:33.480 --> 07:36.800
And these things get a lot of value for that $35.

07:36.800 --> 07:40.740
Many of them are running Raspbian, which just received a new update this week.

07:40.740 --> 07:45.120
And in that update is a hardware accelerated VLC.

07:45.120 --> 07:48.920
Now not for everything, but for certain types of media playback, they're actually getting

07:48.920 --> 07:55.400
hardware acceleration out of these things for H.264, MPEG2, and VC1 video.

07:55.400 --> 07:57.840
Didn't get a chance to try this, Joe, but have you given this a go yet?

07:57.840 --> 08:01.320
I did, yeah, and I was really surprised at how well it worked.

08:01.320 --> 08:07.680
Even on the Xero, standard definition playback worked well.

08:07.680 --> 08:14.560
Full screen, okay, it was a little bit hit and miss with a few drop frames here and there.

08:14.560 --> 08:19.280
It was kind of bearable, but I don't think you would really want to watch much video,

08:19.280 --> 08:26.200
maybe like for a presentation or something or a super low bit rate and low resolution

08:26.200 --> 08:27.400
you might get away with.

08:27.400 --> 08:35.240
But on my three, which is the original three, not the plus, that was not a problem at all.

08:35.240 --> 08:37.880
Standard def video works flawlessly on it.

08:37.880 --> 08:43.920
I tried 1080p, and I don't know if it was the bottleneck of the network streaming from

08:43.920 --> 08:47.760
my NAS, but it was a little bit hit and miss there.

08:47.760 --> 08:50.440
But 720p full screen, no problem.

08:50.440 --> 08:56.840
So it is massively, massively improved over the previous version of Raspbian and VLC where

08:56.840 --> 08:58.680
there was no hardware acceleration there.

08:58.680 --> 09:00.920
It was just even not full screen.

09:00.920 --> 09:02.200
Standard definition was choppy.

09:02.200 --> 09:05.960
Hmm, you know, that's got some serious potentials when you start hooking these things up to

09:05.960 --> 09:09.940
TVs, put Kodi on there, swap out the player for VLC, and I've got hardware accelerated

09:09.940 --> 09:10.940
Kodi playback.

09:10.940 --> 09:16.200
You're just an app get update, app get dist upgrade away if you want to get the latest

09:16.200 --> 09:17.200
Raspbian.

09:17.200 --> 09:21.320
And then, of course, just install VLC and you'll have that hardware accelerated version.

09:21.320 --> 09:22.440
They worked pretty hard on that.

09:22.440 --> 09:24.920
There's a bunch of other great updates in there as well.

09:24.920 --> 09:29.420
But I wanted to also go to another use case for Raspberry Pis that I think are pretty

09:29.420 --> 09:33.240
neat and touch on that whole, they're a bit of a platform thing.

09:33.240 --> 09:38.280
Kodak is going to sell like a high end 3D printer with a Raspberry Pi built in.

09:38.280 --> 09:43.540
Yeah, and high end, you're not joking there, three and a half thousand dollars.

09:43.540 --> 09:48.480
So this thing, you think that the controller for it would be a bit more powerful than the

09:48.480 --> 09:53.280
Raspberry Pi if you're paying that much, but I suppose it doesn't need to do that much.

09:53.280 --> 09:59.420
And it goes to show, yeah, as a platform, it's such a popular device and they can make

09:59.420 --> 10:03.160
them at such scale, it's ideal for something like this.

10:03.160 --> 10:06.880
If this was our perennial show, I'd be saying this is my runs Linux this week because it's

10:06.880 --> 10:09.000
a pretty slick looking unit.

10:09.000 --> 10:15.800
I mean, this is now 3D printers for the mainstream and they're targeting engineering, education

10:15.800 --> 10:18.420
and actual business workloads.

10:18.420 --> 10:23.180
But the Linux part of this thing is used for the touch screen, for sucking in files, but

10:23.180 --> 10:28.720
also for integrating with their cloud service where you can manage printing amongst multiple

10:28.720 --> 10:31.240
units, which is kind of a neat thing.

10:31.240 --> 10:35.760
I never thought about orchestration for 3D printers before, but I could actually see

10:35.760 --> 10:39.800
that being a thing and I want to be whoever that is that's having that problem because

10:39.800 --> 10:40.800
that's great.

10:40.800 --> 10:43.560
Well, they are pretty slow, aren't they?

10:43.560 --> 10:47.840
So it makes sense to do one bit in each one at the same time rather than having to wait

10:47.840 --> 10:48.840
around.

10:48.840 --> 10:52.380
Yeah, and the thing's got Wi-Fi or Ethernet, plus it's got a camera in the printing chamber

10:52.380 --> 10:56.320
so you can check on it from wherever you're at, and that's also being facilitated by the

10:56.320 --> 10:57.440
Raspberry Pi.

10:57.440 --> 11:01.920
They have a nickname, I'm going to call it, for their version of Linux on there.

11:01.920 --> 11:07.280
They call it 3D Printer OS, which is, you know, it's a Kodak recipe on top of a Linux

11:07.280 --> 11:08.820
kernel basically.

11:08.820 --> 11:11.880
It's just great to see these Raspberry Pis be put into production because when they first

11:11.880 --> 11:13.640
came out, like, oh, they're a toy.

11:13.640 --> 11:18.280
You can't really use them for real products and now you have Kodak 3D printer shipping

11:18.280 --> 11:19.280
with them.

11:19.280 --> 11:24.440
Well, speaking of toys, I put this next story in just because I wanted an excuse to laugh

11:24.440 --> 11:25.680
at folding phones.

11:25.680 --> 11:26.680
Yeah, good.

11:26.680 --> 11:27.680
Good, okay.

11:27.680 --> 11:30.840
I'm on board.

11:30.840 --> 11:35.560
This is actually also revealing something about Android I wasn't aware of before.

11:35.560 --> 11:37.400
So this is really at the core of it.

11:37.400 --> 11:41.940
It's about updating Android's multi-resume functionality.

11:41.940 --> 11:44.760
You know, when you've got, like, an Android device that has a big enough screen where

11:44.760 --> 11:49.520
you can split screen it and run two apps at once, well, whatever app isn't active gets

11:49.520 --> 11:50.520
put to sleep.

11:50.520 --> 11:54.840
I didn't realize that limitation of Android because I've never used that feature, but

11:54.840 --> 11:55.840
that's really lame.

11:55.840 --> 12:00.600
Yeah, I can't say I've ever noticed it either because I have tested out that feature briefly,

12:00.600 --> 12:02.320
but then I've just thought, this is pointless.

12:02.320 --> 12:05.460
Why am I doing this, certainly on a phone?

12:05.460 --> 12:11.320
But it matters on a split screen foldable phone because you'll have apps on sides that

12:11.320 --> 12:16.120
are folded and they'll have to be put to sleep and the multi-resume feature now makes it

12:16.120 --> 12:20.500
possible for multiple apps to be open and actually be running at the same time.

12:20.500 --> 12:22.540
It's kind of weird how Google's rolling this out.

12:22.540 --> 12:28.960
It's going to be baked into Android Q, but OEMs can opt into a special beta branch of

12:28.960 --> 12:34.680
Android P and get it pretty soon in Android P as well if they have to rush to market with

12:34.680 --> 12:36.200
a foldable device right now.

12:36.200 --> 12:40.520
Yeah, this must be Samsung who've been working with Google here because they are the ones

12:40.520 --> 12:47.200
who are pushing to sell this foldable phone in, I think, Q1 next year or certainly early

12:47.200 --> 12:48.200
Q2.

12:48.200 --> 12:51.640
If not, I mean, it just looks a bit ridiculous though, doesn't it?

12:51.640 --> 12:52.640
Oh my gosh.

12:52.640 --> 12:57.480
The only kind of foldable phone that I would be interested in would be like an actual flip

12:57.480 --> 12:58.480
phone.

12:58.480 --> 12:59.480
Yeah.

12:59.480 --> 13:04.680
That maybe you flip it up and it's two screens inside and you could hang it up and you could

13:04.680 --> 13:06.920
like a flip phone from the 90s.

13:06.920 --> 13:07.920
That would be fine.

13:07.920 --> 13:12.880
I'd be curious to give that a go, but I don't need to fold the glass itself.

13:12.880 --> 13:13.880
I don't get it.

13:13.880 --> 13:15.200
The prototypes look pretty bad.

13:15.200 --> 13:16.640
It's more like a wedge.

13:16.640 --> 13:18.020
Folding isn't really what you're doing.

13:18.020 --> 13:21.040
It's more like a really sharp bend.

13:21.040 --> 13:22.320
They're bending them.

13:22.320 --> 13:23.320
Yeah.

13:23.320 --> 13:25.600
And we all remember Bendgate with the iPhones.

13:25.600 --> 13:29.720
I'd be reluctant even if it was designed to fold.

13:29.720 --> 13:33.280
I saw someone do a video of folding an iPad Pro.

13:33.280 --> 13:34.280
Snap.

13:34.280 --> 13:35.280
You know, just bending it.

13:35.280 --> 13:37.800
It just shatters and oh, it's just painful to watch.

13:37.800 --> 13:38.800
Yeah.

13:38.800 --> 13:42.280
Well, you got Bendgate and of course you got Donglegate and Android phones are no longer

13:42.280 --> 13:44.200
free from Donglegate either.

13:44.200 --> 13:50.900
Essential has shown a few signs of life with their new magnetic headphone jack adapter.

13:50.900 --> 13:53.360
It's pretty looking, but it comes at a price.

13:53.360 --> 13:54.360
Yeah.

13:54.360 --> 13:57.200
A price of $150 or $149.

13:57.200 --> 14:01.280
To get a headphone jack.

14:01.280 --> 14:03.120
Which to be fair, that's not quite true.

14:03.120 --> 14:08.040
It is a very, very good digital to analog converter.

14:08.040 --> 14:09.040
Yeah.

14:09.040 --> 14:10.040
It actually seems like it checks out.

14:10.040 --> 14:14.840
I was reading some details on their website and it's audiophile grade as they put it,

14:14.840 --> 14:17.460
but with some legitimate details behind that.

14:17.460 --> 14:22.080
And they've done a design where you could put bigger audiophile headphones into this

14:22.080 --> 14:23.480
jack and they'll actually snap in.

14:23.480 --> 14:24.940
And the thing's neat, right?

14:24.940 --> 14:29.960
It magnetically pops right on and it gives you a great DAC and you can listen to it while

14:29.960 --> 14:31.080
your phone's in a dock.

14:31.080 --> 14:34.360
And you could see how somebody who has the money to blow on an essential phone might

14:34.360 --> 14:38.760
want to blow $150 to get a headphone jack, I guess.

14:38.760 --> 14:42.320
But that price, you literally could buy the market's highest end Bluetooth wireless headphones

14:42.320 --> 14:44.160
or something that sound fairly decent.

14:44.160 --> 14:46.080
I guess they're not audiophile grade though.

14:46.080 --> 14:51.300
Yeah, even the best Bluetooth is going to come nowhere near a proper wired, decent digital

14:51.300 --> 14:52.300
to analog converter.

14:52.300 --> 14:58.600
So I can see a market for this and it's only really interesting because we thought that

14:58.600 --> 15:03.680
essential were pretty much circling the drain and maybe this is their death rattle.

15:03.680 --> 15:04.680
I don't know.

15:04.680 --> 15:07.680
They kind of must've been working on this for a while and thought, well, at least we'll

15:07.680 --> 15:11.480
get this out and try and get some revenue in, but I can't see it doing well.

15:11.480 --> 15:17.240
It's not going to drive a lot of revenue because it's a niche accessory for a niche Android

15:17.240 --> 15:18.240
phone.

15:18.240 --> 15:21.260
There's not a huge essential market out there.

15:21.260 --> 15:26.160
And then there's going to be even fewer of them that want to spend that money on a headphone

15:26.160 --> 15:32.160
jack that only works with this phone, where something like regular Bluetooth headphones,

15:32.160 --> 15:36.040
again, not great audio quality, but would work with any phone they buy in the future.

15:36.040 --> 15:39.980
This is bad too, because this was first announced in June and then they said it'd be shipping

15:39.980 --> 15:43.040
in the summer, but that obviously came and went.

15:43.040 --> 15:46.920
And now here we are in November and it's available.

15:46.920 --> 15:51.400
That's rough for a pretty basic accessory that that was supposed to be one of the cornerstone

15:51.400 --> 15:55.720
features of this phone was the snap on accessories and this is what we've gotten so far.

15:55.720 --> 15:59.960
And it's only really news because of the hype that surrounded the essential phone in the

15:59.960 --> 16:04.080
first place, because Andy Rubin, one of the founders of Android in the first place, had

16:04.080 --> 16:08.520
left Google to do this new thing and everyone thought it was going to be great and they

16:08.520 --> 16:12.520
made all these promises and it's just failed to deliver, hasn't it?

16:12.520 --> 16:17.560
They've sold very few of these phones and the accessories that they promised, that always

16:17.560 --> 16:18.800
goes that way, doesn't it?

16:18.800 --> 16:20.600
Like Motorola have done that before.

16:20.600 --> 16:23.900
You launch a phone with these ports on it or whatever that you'll be able to put these

16:23.900 --> 16:26.960
proprietary accessories on and there's going to be tons of them coming in a few months

16:26.960 --> 16:29.640
and then they just never really deliver on that.

16:29.640 --> 16:33.120
Red's doing it right now with their camera, which I had a chance to use in the, in a,

16:33.120 --> 16:34.120
in a store.

16:34.120 --> 16:36.720
Oh man, that thing's huge.

16:36.720 --> 16:37.720
It's a big phone.

16:37.720 --> 16:42.120
With this like 3D, the 3DS style 3D on it, that looks horrible as well.

16:42.120 --> 16:43.120
Yes, exactly.

16:43.120 --> 16:47.000
If you've ever seen a 3DS, it's a lot like that, maybe slightly better and obviously

16:47.000 --> 16:49.120
higher resolution, but about that.

16:49.120 --> 16:51.960
Yeah, but that's a proper gimmick as well.

16:51.960 --> 16:55.520
You'd think with Red, the camera would be amazing because they're a camera company,

16:55.520 --> 16:57.760
but apparently it's just not that good.

16:57.760 --> 16:58.760
It's a standard part.

16:58.760 --> 17:03.200
Yeah, they might later on have a module that you can snap on, but in the meantime, people

17:03.200 --> 17:04.320
are getting real work done.

17:04.320 --> 17:09.600
Like the folks over at Canonical, Mark Shuttleworth made some headlines this week when he announced

17:09.600 --> 17:13.960
that Ubuntu 18.04 would get a 10 year support lifespan.

17:13.960 --> 17:18.960
Yeah, this was at his keynote at the OpenStack Summit in Berlin and he just kind of casually

17:18.960 --> 17:20.520
tossed it in there, didn't he?

17:20.520 --> 17:22.920
Yeah, it's going to be supported for 10 years.

17:22.920 --> 17:27.160
Yeah, we both watched it and it was just one of the bullet items that he was going through.

17:27.160 --> 17:29.200
That's just something we're going to do.

17:29.200 --> 17:33.880
And that might be because of the market he's now really competing in.

17:33.880 --> 17:35.080
That's sort of the standard.

17:35.080 --> 17:37.720
Windows has a very long support lifecycle.

17:37.720 --> 17:41.760
Red Hat Enterprise Linux has a very long support cycle.

17:41.760 --> 17:46.040
And my understanding is that this isn't necessarily available to just anybody.

17:46.040 --> 17:49.680
Yeah, that was one of the big questions that I saw a lot of people asking.

17:49.680 --> 17:54.240
Of course, with an LTS, you get five years with Ubuntu for free.

17:54.240 --> 17:57.800
But this extra five years, is that going to be free or is it going to be paid for as part

17:57.800 --> 17:59.800
of their ESM program?

17:59.800 --> 18:07.480
Well, I asked someone who was with Shuttleworth in Berlin and he told me that having spoken

18:07.480 --> 18:10.280
to Mark, it's going to be part of that ESM.

18:10.280 --> 18:12.920
So unfortunately, you're going to have to pay for it.

18:12.920 --> 18:17.880
And there is like a minimum to get into that program, like a minimum $2,500.

18:17.880 --> 18:20.000
You have to have a certain amount of rigs and whatnot.

18:20.000 --> 18:23.520
But that's not a very big barrier to entry to any organization that's running a fleet

18:23.520 --> 18:24.520
of these machines.

18:24.520 --> 18:29.040
And to get an additional five years means that people that are working on products right

18:29.040 --> 18:35.060
now in 2018, when they ship them in 2019 and 2020, they're going to be safe basing them

18:35.060 --> 18:36.720
on 1804 right now.

18:36.720 --> 18:38.120
And that's who he's speaking to.

18:38.120 --> 18:39.560
He's speaking to the telcos.

18:39.560 --> 18:43.160
He specifically called out the financial institutions and IoT as well.

18:43.160 --> 18:49.360
Yeah, don't think desktop here, think VMs, cloud, OpenStack, that sort of thing.

18:49.360 --> 18:50.360
Yeah.

18:50.360 --> 18:53.040
Really, that's where most of Canonical's revenue comes from.

18:53.040 --> 18:56.280
And those corporate users utilize that extended support.

18:56.280 --> 19:02.040
There's also an extended support program currently for 1204 and 1404.

19:02.040 --> 19:07.880
And there was implication by Mark Shuttleworth at this event that when the next LTS is released

19:07.880 --> 19:12.400
by Canonical, it may just launch with that longer support lifespan.

19:12.400 --> 19:13.400
Yeah.

19:13.400 --> 19:16.840
And all of this, as you mentioned, is about competing with Red Hat, essentially, isn't

19:16.840 --> 19:17.840
it?

19:17.840 --> 19:19.640
Because with RHEL, you can get 10 years.

19:19.640 --> 19:22.120
And they're competing in a very clever way.

19:22.120 --> 19:27.740
This is when you watch Mark up on stage, you really get a sense that he has a keen understanding

19:27.740 --> 19:33.560
of this market because of certain words and key phrases and focuses that he has are speaking

19:33.560 --> 19:36.280
to a very specific customer.

19:36.280 --> 19:40.360
And that's sort of that CIO, CTO level business person.

19:40.360 --> 19:41.880
That's who Mark's really addressing.

19:41.880 --> 19:46.800
And in an interview on ZDNet, he said, we are neutral on the public cloud.

19:46.800 --> 19:50.320
We work at arm's length with AWS, Azure, and Google.

19:50.320 --> 19:53.700
We provide a common currency across different environments.

19:53.700 --> 19:56.020
But we are not the lowest common denominator.

19:56.020 --> 20:02.600
We want to be the best operating system on Azure for Azure and AWS for AWS, and so on.

20:02.600 --> 20:07.600
So what he's saying there, that's business speak for we don't just have one agreement

20:07.600 --> 20:10.120
with one company and we optimize our OS for that.

20:10.120 --> 20:14.220
We optimize it for each public cloud because we're neutral.

20:14.220 --> 20:16.160
We are a common platform.

20:16.160 --> 20:21.900
And that is exactly why IBM is buying Red Hat, because Red Hat is this neutral player

20:21.900 --> 20:25.960
that they can go in and sell to their customers who don't want vendor lock-in.

20:25.960 --> 20:31.200
IBM is trying to save people from vendor lock-in with the Red Hat purchase.

20:31.200 --> 20:34.340
That's a big part of the value is Red Hat is Switzerland.

20:34.340 --> 20:37.800
That's been a big message is the Red Hat's going to remain Switzerland.

20:37.800 --> 20:41.520
And we're going to keep our go-to-market strategies.

20:41.520 --> 20:45.560
That's business speak for what the market wants now as they move more functionality

20:45.560 --> 20:49.160
to the cloud is they don't want to get locked into any particular cloud.

20:49.160 --> 20:53.440
And if you're building the platform that lets them run on multiple different clouds, then

20:53.440 --> 20:55.340
you are in their sights for purchase.

20:55.340 --> 20:56.720
And that's what Mark's talking about.

20:56.720 --> 20:58.480
And now that's what IBM is talking about.

20:58.480 --> 20:59.480
It's very clever.

20:59.480 --> 21:00.480
Well, yeah.

21:00.480 --> 21:05.560
And of course, being able to orchestrate your services across multiple cloud vendors means

21:05.560 --> 21:11.320
that when one of them has an outage, you can just spin up a few extra ones on their competitor

21:11.320 --> 21:12.320
and your service doesn't go down.

21:12.320 --> 21:17.600
I mean, we've seen AWS go down and Azure go down, and half the internet disappears.

21:17.600 --> 21:20.280
It might not be very long, but that's money lost.

21:20.280 --> 21:21.280
Right.

21:21.280 --> 21:27.680
And with big orchestration systems like Kubernetes and others, it becomes possible to say, we're

21:27.680 --> 21:30.200
going to have a really big weekend.

21:30.200 --> 21:34.520
We need additional infrastructure for this launch weekend, and you can spin up infrastructure

21:34.520 --> 21:40.520
on DigitalOcean and on AWS using the same central management tools.

21:40.520 --> 21:45.640
And that means keeping things vendor neutral is much more of a big deal now than it used

21:45.640 --> 21:48.220
to be because you want to have that flexibility.

21:48.220 --> 21:51.760
And so that's why they're speaking to these customers and they're using this language.

21:51.760 --> 21:54.800
And Mark does have an inherent advantage here.

21:54.800 --> 21:59.600
Ubuntu has sort of just taken off in the cloud, and they really have been able to remain vendor

21:59.600 --> 22:00.600
neutral.

22:00.600 --> 22:07.480
It doesn't take a ton of overhead to specialize certain spins of the OS for big cloud providers.

22:07.480 --> 22:13.720
If it takes a team of a dozen to customize Ubuntu a little bit for AWS, that's an investment

22:13.720 --> 22:14.720
that's well spent.

22:14.720 --> 22:19.960
Well, very much like the investment of this extended support is worth it, if they're bringing

22:19.960 --> 22:25.720
in $2,500 per customer minimum, then it doesn't take many of those customers, does it, to

22:25.720 --> 22:29.760
justify that program and the extra staff that are required for that.

22:29.760 --> 22:34.800
This is my sense, is that a lot of this stuff is making more revenue than people fully realize,

22:34.800 --> 22:40.520
and that Canonical is getting leaner and fitter and positioning themselves to be a much bigger

22:40.520 --> 22:44.000
player, or maybe I should say, to attract much bigger players.

22:44.000 --> 22:45.000
Well, yeah.

22:45.000 --> 22:47.440
Shot of Worth is getting serious now.

22:47.440 --> 22:50.280
He's had enough of messing around with things like the phone and everything.

22:50.280 --> 22:53.980
We saw him shut that down and slim down Canonical.

22:53.980 --> 22:57.640
And he's been talking about doing an IPO pretty much ever since then.

22:57.640 --> 23:04.160
And part of that is moving to genuine profit, serious figures, serious revenue, serious

23:04.160 --> 23:06.180
profit, serious growth.

23:06.180 --> 23:13.320
And he's even now looking for investors as kind of the first stage towards going to an

23:13.320 --> 23:14.320
IPO.

23:14.320 --> 23:16.040
So things must be going pretty well over there.

23:16.040 --> 23:17.960
Obviously, he's going to talk it up.

23:17.960 --> 23:18.960
That's what you do in business.

23:18.960 --> 23:24.200
But I think finally, they've got their ducks in a row, and they're starting to make some

23:24.200 --> 23:25.200
serious profit.

23:25.200 --> 23:28.200
You know, he said in an interview to TechCrunch, the numbers are looking good.

23:28.200 --> 23:30.300
The business is looking healthy.

23:30.300 --> 23:31.300
It's not a charity.

23:31.300 --> 23:33.220
It's not philanthropy.

23:33.220 --> 23:36.920
He goes on to say, there are some key metrics that I'm watching, which are the gate for

23:36.920 --> 23:42.040
me to take the next step, which would be growth equity, in other words, investment.

23:42.040 --> 23:46.400
And he said later, those metrics are the size of the business and how it's diversified.

23:46.400 --> 23:48.480
But he kind of sums it up as this.

23:48.480 --> 23:52.800
Shot of Worth likens this program of getting the company ready to IPO as to getting it

23:52.800 --> 23:53.800
fit.

23:53.800 --> 23:57.800
Because there's no point in saying, I haven't done any exercise in the last 10 years, but

23:57.800 --> 24:00.120
I'm going to sign up for tomorrow's marathon.

24:00.120 --> 24:01.120
It's a good way to put it.

24:01.120 --> 24:06.280
Like, you got to exercise, you got to get fit, you got to get ready for the marathon.

24:06.280 --> 24:07.720
Then you go do the big run.

24:07.720 --> 24:11.560
And I think they're probably getting really close, maybe closer than he implies.

24:11.560 --> 24:13.400
They're just waiting for the right situation.

24:13.400 --> 24:17.000
Well, it's looking increasingly like the IPO will happen in 2019.

24:17.000 --> 24:18.360
So we won't have long to wait.

24:18.360 --> 24:19.360
Yeah.

24:19.360 --> 24:22.200
But in the meantime, the competition isn't sitting still.

24:22.200 --> 24:28.560
Internet Enterprise Linux Beta 8 is out with a couple of nice big features like application

24:28.560 --> 24:32.920
streams, which I believe is essentially modularity from Fedora, and a few other things that are

24:32.920 --> 24:33.920
packed into this thing.

24:33.920 --> 24:37.480
Yeah, it's funny that they're not calling it modularity, they're calling it application

24:37.480 --> 24:38.480
streams.

24:38.480 --> 24:42.240
But that's the first thing that jumped out at me here was, well, this is just taken straight

24:42.240 --> 24:48.120
from Fedora, which, I mean, Fedora is the upstream for RHEL, so it's to be expected.

24:48.120 --> 24:49.120
They do that.

24:49.120 --> 24:53.880
Also, another thing that they're going to do that with is Cockpit, apparently.

24:53.880 --> 24:57.760
Cockpit is a brilliant web-based management tool, and I have dealt with some bad ones.

24:57.760 --> 25:02.480
But this one, I gave a review on Linux Unplugged about it a while back, and I like it so much

25:02.480 --> 25:09.280
that I switched my servers over to a giant Fedora installation managed by Cockpit.

25:09.280 --> 25:11.960
And it's great because you can do things through the web interface, and then you can switch

25:11.960 --> 25:14.840
to the command line, and just do stuff on the command line, and it won't break the web

25:14.840 --> 25:15.840
interface.

25:15.840 --> 25:16.840
It uses SSH for authentication.

25:16.840 --> 25:19.040
I've just, anyways, I did a whole deep dive on it.

25:19.040 --> 25:23.620
It's a really nice tool that the team over there has built that has been available on

25:23.620 --> 25:25.320
Fedora for a while.

25:25.320 --> 25:30.000
And they're calling it something else, something really plain, like just web console, which

25:30.000 --> 25:31.000
is so boring.

25:31.000 --> 25:32.000
Cockpit's great.

25:32.000 --> 25:34.120
It's like the control center of your server.

25:34.120 --> 25:36.560
Web console, womp womp.

25:36.560 --> 25:40.840
But they seem to, like, remarket them so that way people that are paying money for Red Hat

25:40.840 --> 25:43.680
feel like they're getting something special rather than something free.

25:43.680 --> 25:44.680
Yeah, yeah.

25:44.680 --> 25:48.320
They don't want to think, well, hang on, why don't I just use Fedora then?

25:48.320 --> 25:53.240
But it does go to show how much has changed in the last few years since RHEL 7 came out,

25:53.240 --> 25:54.240
doesn't it?

25:54.240 --> 25:57.560
RHEL 8 is looking very different and very modern compared to it.

25:57.560 --> 25:59.880
Yeah, there's a lot of other changes in here, too.

25:59.880 --> 26:05.400
And the Linux Academy crew has been going through this like crazy because, of course,

26:05.400 --> 26:08.980
they're looking at it from, OK, what do we have to update in our courseware?

26:08.980 --> 26:13.560
They have been waiting, like waiting for this announcement, and watching, and watching.

26:13.560 --> 26:14.920
And now they're spinning it up and testing it.

26:14.920 --> 26:16.240
And they're going through it.

26:16.240 --> 26:20.120
And there's way more than what's highlighted in the articles that have come out.

26:20.120 --> 26:21.880
This is a big update.

26:21.880 --> 26:25.420
And it can be downloaded by anyone that's enrolled in the Red Hat developer program

26:25.420 --> 26:26.420
right now.

26:26.420 --> 26:30.640
Or I guess if you want to go sign up and jump through all the hoops, you can get a copy

26:30.640 --> 26:32.200
of it, too, and see what's new.

26:32.200 --> 26:36.640
And it's not going to be a huge surprise to anyone following Fedora.

26:36.640 --> 26:42.760
But it's a neat period of time right now because RHEL 8 is sort of fresh, and new, and current.

26:42.760 --> 26:47.800
And so you can deploy the Red Hat Enterprise desktop and feel like you're running a modern

26:47.800 --> 26:49.680
Linux system for a little while.

26:49.680 --> 26:51.940
It's like the fun period for me for RHEL.

26:51.940 --> 26:55.120
And to watch the crew at Linux Academy scramble to go through it and pull all the different

26:55.120 --> 27:00.160
things out has been interesting to just see an industry respond to a new imminent release

27:00.160 --> 27:02.240
from a perspective I haven't seen before.

27:02.240 --> 27:04.600
It's a big deal when a new RHEL comes out.

27:04.600 --> 27:09.760
It's also a big deal when the entire cryptocurrency market tanks like it did this week.

27:09.760 --> 27:11.380
Oh, bad, too.

27:11.380 --> 27:15.900
We're talking some serious numbers now at this point.

27:15.900 --> 27:19.300
Nearly $30 billion was lost.

27:19.300 --> 27:25.000
About 15% of the crypto market share value was lost in the last couple of days.

27:25.000 --> 27:30.580
And as we record this episode, the Bitcoin price is around $5,500.

27:30.580 --> 27:31.580
It's bad right now.

27:31.580 --> 27:32.580
Yeah.

27:32.580 --> 27:37.680
And for the last few months, it's been kind of hovering around about $6,500, but it's

27:37.680 --> 27:40.920
kind of been, well, peaking at $6,500.

27:40.920 --> 27:46.200
So that is a significant drop, although it does seem to have stabilized, doesn't it?

27:46.200 --> 27:48.600
It seemed to stabilize very quickly.

27:48.600 --> 27:52.440
I think a lot of people were worried that it was just going to go through the floor.

27:52.440 --> 27:53.440
I'm bullish now.

27:53.440 --> 27:54.440
I'm bullish.

27:54.440 --> 27:55.440
We found our floor.

27:55.440 --> 27:56.440
It's $5,500.

27:56.440 --> 27:57.740
Bye.

27:57.740 --> 27:58.740
It's time to go, everybody.

27:58.740 --> 27:59.740
Let's rally up.

27:59.740 --> 28:00.740
Yeah.

28:00.740 --> 28:01.740
This is the sale, as you call it.

28:01.740 --> 28:02.740
Yeah.

28:02.740 --> 28:03.740
That's right.

28:03.740 --> 28:04.740
That's what Bitcoiners call this.

28:04.740 --> 28:05.740
It's on sale right now.

28:05.740 --> 28:08.760
And I don't mean to laugh at the loss, because I know as somebody who sometimes has followed

28:08.760 --> 28:12.280
this very closely, those price drops can be devastating.

28:12.280 --> 28:16.720
But at the higher level, it's fascinating to watch what happens with an open source

28:16.720 --> 28:18.420
currency, what happens here.

28:18.420 --> 28:23.760
And it may have been the very thing that affects many open source projects that sort of triggered

28:23.760 --> 28:25.340
this entire crash.

28:25.340 --> 28:32.680
That's what's fascinating, is a fork of Bitcoin Cash, a hard fork, may have caused this, well,

28:32.680 --> 28:35.220
at least began this process.

28:35.220 --> 28:36.920
And then it's really hard to say.

28:36.920 --> 28:39.860
There's a lot of automated trading that kicks in at certain points.

28:39.860 --> 28:41.840
So it's pretty hard to nail it down to one thing.

28:41.840 --> 28:47.680
But it's a fork, not quite as we know it, but in a similar vein that may have triggered

28:47.680 --> 28:48.680
this thing.

28:48.680 --> 28:54.780
And that's fascinating to me, that it's project politics and money all wrapped up into one

28:54.780 --> 28:55.780
thing.

28:55.780 --> 28:56.780
Yeah, a fork of a fork.

28:56.780 --> 28:57.780
Let's not forget.

28:57.780 --> 29:00.000
So it is a typical open source, isn't it?

29:00.000 --> 29:01.000
Yes.

29:01.000 --> 29:02.000
You're right.

29:02.000 --> 29:03.000
It is.

29:03.000 --> 29:04.800
We're like for conception now on this.

29:04.800 --> 29:09.900
And in both cases, though, the parent projects that they forked from, I mean, they're not

29:09.900 --> 29:11.820
doing great right now, but they haven't died.

29:11.820 --> 29:14.020
They're continuing on.

29:14.020 --> 29:18.700
And the weird thing, too, is when a project forks like this, you end up in some cases

29:18.700 --> 29:21.380
holding both kinds of cash all of a sudden.

29:21.380 --> 29:24.740
So you have one of, say, Bitcoin and one of Bitcoin Cash.

29:24.740 --> 29:30.780
And then it's a really weird thing that happens, because normally you're out, but in this case,

29:30.780 --> 29:31.780
you sometimes have more.

29:31.780 --> 29:32.780
Yeah.

29:32.780 --> 29:33.780
Free money.

29:33.780 --> 29:34.780
Sweet.

29:34.780 --> 29:37.980
So all of this internet money, it's really fun to watch.

29:37.980 --> 29:44.420
It would be very anxiety-inducing if I had all of my life savings wrapped up into this,

29:44.420 --> 29:46.100
like I know some folks do.

29:46.100 --> 29:48.540
I would not be as jovial about this.

29:48.540 --> 29:50.580
But I spent all of mine, mostly.

29:50.580 --> 29:54.660
So I'm at a point now where I only hold enough that it's not going to make me or break me.

29:54.660 --> 29:59.020
So I can just sort of watch it from a detached, almost scientific perspective.

29:59.020 --> 30:00.020
Yeah.

30:00.020 --> 30:02.820
I put 100 quid into it just for a bit of a laugh.

30:02.820 --> 30:06.620
That's probably worth about 20 quid now, because I bought right at the wrong time.

30:06.620 --> 30:12.460
But I don't know, it's got a little way to go to the end of the year to get up to 100,000,

30:12.460 --> 30:13.460
doesn't it?

30:13.460 --> 30:14.460
Well, our predictions may hold true.

30:14.460 --> 30:15.460
I mean, we could work.

30:15.460 --> 30:16.460
It could work out.

30:16.460 --> 30:17.460
We've got a few weeks.

30:17.460 --> 30:18.460
Yeah.

30:18.460 --> 30:19.460
Or I could go back and edit in.

30:19.460 --> 30:23.700
When we say, yeah, I think it's going to be 100,000, I'll just say, I think it's going

30:23.700 --> 30:24.700
to be 2,000.

30:24.700 --> 30:25.700
Right?

30:25.700 --> 30:29.340
Just totally different cadence, totally different tone.

30:29.340 --> 30:30.340
No one will notice.

30:30.340 --> 30:31.340
We'll be fine.

30:31.340 --> 30:33.860
We don't have to address it in our annual episode.

30:33.860 --> 30:38.380
Well, if you want to get next week's episode and get all future episodes, go to linuxactionnews.com

30:38.380 --> 30:41.780
slash subscribe for all the ways to get those there episodes.

30:41.780 --> 30:45.360
And go to linuxactionnews.com slash contact for ways to get in touch.

30:45.360 --> 30:48.260
And keep an eye out for Linux Academy's Black Friday sale.

30:48.260 --> 30:52.420
It's going to be a great price, and you lock that price for the lifetime of your account.

30:52.420 --> 30:53.780
You lock it in.

30:53.780 --> 30:55.560
And it's also available to current students.

30:55.560 --> 30:57.500
Maybe you signed up to support these here shows.

30:57.500 --> 31:00.900
Well, now you can lock in that Black Friday sale price forever.

31:00.900 --> 31:01.900
Very nice.

31:01.900 --> 31:05.460
We'll be back next Monday with our weekly take on the latest Linux and open source news.

31:05.460 --> 31:07.260
I'm at Chris LAS.

31:07.260 --> 31:08.740
I'm at Joe Ressington.

31:08.740 --> 31:11.660
Thank you for joining us, and we will see you next week.

31:11.660 --> 31:33.900
Until then, have a great day, and we'll see you later.
