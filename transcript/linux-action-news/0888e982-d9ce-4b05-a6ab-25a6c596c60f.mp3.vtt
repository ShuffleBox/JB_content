Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, our weekly take on Linux and the open-source world.

00:16.360 --> 00:21.200
This is episode 15, recorded on August 20th, 2017. I'm Chris.

00:21.200 --> 00:22.200
And I'm Joe.

00:22.200 --> 00:27.080
Hello, Joe, and my podcast-tuned ears tell me that sounds a bit like a hotel room. Are

00:27.080 --> 00:28.600
you still at Ogg Camp over there?

00:28.600 --> 00:33.760
I am still at Ogg Camp, yes. I've been there all day yesterday and all day today.

00:33.760 --> 00:34.760
How's it been going?

00:34.760 --> 00:38.240
Yeah, it's been going great. And I'm going to be going out for the social event tonight

00:38.240 --> 00:43.240
as well, Sunday night as we record this in the UK. But it's been really good. I've seen

00:43.240 --> 00:49.520
a bunch of talks about loads of random stuff. But I think one of the good ones for me was

00:49.520 --> 00:55.840
Richard Brown from OpenSUSE. He gave a really comprehensive overview of how the project

00:55.840 --> 01:02.160
works and how it ties in with SLE, the enterprise version and stuff. And that was really good.

01:02.160 --> 01:10.440
And also, he did one today, a shorter talk about OpenQA and how that relates to Tumbleweed

01:10.440 --> 01:15.440
and why they think that's the best way to do a distro, which is a little bit controversial

01:15.440 --> 01:20.360
to say that a rolling release is better than the snapshot releases that Ubuntu do.

01:20.360 --> 01:23.720
That does sound pretty interesting. And it sounds like also a few shows got produced

01:23.720 --> 01:26.640
while you're there. So there's some content out of OggCamp people can look forward to

01:26.640 --> 01:29.920
if they go check out late night Linux. So overall, pretty productive, Joe.

01:29.920 --> 01:31.640
Yeah, so far so good.

01:31.640 --> 01:34.920
Of course, there's another group of folks that are having a party this week. And that's

01:34.920 --> 01:37.680
Gnome. Gnome has officially turned 20, Joe.

01:37.680 --> 01:40.520
Yeah, can you believe it's that old as a project?

01:40.520 --> 01:44.440
It kind of makes me feel old. I know that's a selfish take on it. But that was my first

01:44.440 --> 01:48.480
thought is, whoa, wait, what? 20 years? Oh, no.

01:48.480 --> 01:51.800
Yeah. And Debian has turned 24.

01:51.800 --> 01:57.560
1993. That was the first release of Debian. Unbelievable. 24 years of Debian, 20 years

01:57.560 --> 02:02.760
of Gnome, two projects that have had a huge role in my Linux usage. Debian Day. What do

02:02.760 --> 02:05.080
you think of that, Joe? We should start celebrating Debian Day.

02:05.080 --> 02:09.880
Yeah, we should definitely. Maybe we can convert a few people, maybe.

02:09.880 --> 02:13.920
Speaking of Debian, there's a bit of a remix for the Raspberry Pi that's got an update.

02:13.920 --> 02:18.120
Yeah, the previous version of Raspberry Pi was based on Jessie. And now they have updated

02:18.120 --> 02:23.880
it to Stretch. So it's kind of up to date now. And there's not anything massively different

02:23.880 --> 02:31.120
in there. You've got new versions of things, new PHP. And some of the kind of core apps

02:31.120 --> 02:36.920
have been updated, like Sonic Pi has been updated to version three now.

02:36.920 --> 02:37.920
Yeah.

02:37.920 --> 02:42.780
Which is a major update for that. That's got a lot of new features on there. But in this

02:42.780 --> 02:52.480
blog post about it, Simon Long was talking about how he's fixed some issues with passwordless

02:52.480 --> 02:58.280
pseudo and the fact that the default user is Pi. And if you change that, then some applications

02:58.280 --> 03:03.680
don't like it. And he's kind of fixed that. But to me, that just highlights that I just

03:03.680 --> 03:09.280
don't think that it's put together very well, that distro. I think that having a default

03:09.280 --> 03:14.760
username and password, and you can change it, but it doesn't prompt you to do that,

03:14.760 --> 03:21.520
or at least not in very overt terms. And then to have pseudo with no password, it just seems

03:21.520 --> 03:27.720
like it's security and usability are always a balance, right? But in this case, I just

03:27.720 --> 03:31.480
feel that they've got that balance wrong for me. And that's why I would always use Ubuntu

03:31.480 --> 03:33.060
Mate on the Pi.

03:33.060 --> 03:36.320
One thing that was a red flag to me, and it's absolutely their choice to go this route,

03:36.320 --> 03:43.080
but they've ripped PulseAudio out. And that to me was a bit of a red flag. When you roll

03:43.080 --> 03:47.760
backwards, that's generally not something that's sustainable. I remember a time in Linux

03:47.760 --> 03:53.520
where only one application could use your audio interface at a time. And if you had

03:53.520 --> 03:58.300
something playing sound, that's all you could listen to. So when we start to slide backwards

03:58.300 --> 04:02.120
in audio, it does make me a little concerned. I'm not saying PulseAudio is the best thing

04:02.120 --> 04:06.160
ever, but just completely ripping it out and then saying, oh, if you need that, just install

04:06.160 --> 04:12.600
it yourself, seems a little bit of a backwards approach. Maybe, I don't know. Maybe I don't

04:12.600 --> 04:16.360
have extensive use with it on the Raspberry Pi. So maybe this is the right move. But that

04:16.360 --> 04:18.000
was a red flag to your point.

04:18.000 --> 04:24.480
Yeah. And another regression is, well, I suppose a change. Do you remember when they made a

04:24.480 --> 04:28.640
theme for LXDE and started calling it a desktop environment and called it Pixel?

04:28.640 --> 04:29.640
Yeah.

04:29.640 --> 04:35.320
And I pointed out to them that that was probably not such a good idea because of the Google

04:35.320 --> 04:36.320
Pixel.

04:36.320 --> 04:37.320
Sure.

04:37.320 --> 04:40.960
And that they might have trademark issues. And they said, oh, it's fine. Don't worry.

04:40.960 --> 04:47.240
It's totally different. Well, now they have silently rebranded it as Raspberry Pi Desktop

04:47.240 --> 04:51.760
and not a single mention of Pixel on their website anymore, apart from the old article.

04:51.760 --> 04:56.480
That's a good move, though. We don't know why, although I think your reason might be

04:56.480 --> 04:58.160
it. But that is a good move on their part.

04:58.160 --> 05:04.280
Well, I asked Ben Nuttall, the community manager. He did a lightning talk at OggCamp yesterday.

05:04.280 --> 05:07.480
And I asked him that very question. And he just took his phone out of his pocket and

05:07.480 --> 05:12.560
held it up as to why they've rebranded away from Pixel.

05:12.560 --> 05:13.560
Was it a Pixel?

05:13.560 --> 05:15.560
I believe so, yeah.

05:15.560 --> 05:18.040
That's I think you nailed it then.

05:18.040 --> 05:22.200
I suspect they got a letter from Google, but he wouldn't say for definite.

05:22.200 --> 05:26.400
Yeah. So here's something then that's good. Let's end on a positive note with our coverage

05:26.400 --> 05:33.100
of this. They have a fix for that Broadcom 43 wireless chipset that ships on the Raspberry

05:33.100 --> 05:38.160
Pi 3 and Pi 0. It potentially allowed an attacker to take over the chip and execute code on

05:38.160 --> 05:43.800
it. And this stretch release includes a patch to address that vulnerability. That's a pretty

05:43.800 --> 05:45.920
important fix and a good reason to update.

05:45.920 --> 05:50.720
Yeah. And to be fair, one thing that is quite impressive about this distro is that it will

05:50.720 --> 05:57.040
work on any Raspberry Pi, from the very first one on the zeros, on the two, the three. And

05:57.040 --> 06:00.920
it'll just work regardless of which Pi you have, which is not something that can be said

06:00.920 --> 06:04.400
for any other OS. So fair play to them on that one.

06:04.400 --> 06:08.900
Yeah, I agree. Just because Debian's 24 years old doesn't mean they're sitting still and

06:08.900 --> 06:14.740
enjoying the architectures and systems they already run great on. Work continues for Debian

06:14.740 --> 06:15.740
on mobile devices.

06:15.740 --> 06:21.040
Yeah, it's easy to forget that you can actually run a proper GNU slash Linux distro on some

06:21.040 --> 06:28.340
of these portable devices, including the Pocket Chip, which is a pretty cool little computer.

06:28.340 --> 06:32.960
And even a phone, Zero phone, which is based on the Raspberry Pi Zero.

06:32.960 --> 06:33.960
Very geeky phone.

06:33.960 --> 06:39.880
Yeah, yeah. The thing is that with the death of Ubuntu phone and Firefox OS, you kind of

06:39.880 --> 06:45.320
think that all hope is lost and Android is the only way if you want Linux on a kind of

06:45.320 --> 06:50.400
embedded small device. But it's good to see that Debian is actually working on this stuff

06:50.400 --> 06:51.760
and hasn't forgotten about it.

06:51.760 --> 06:56.200
I agree. And there's actually a device shipping soon that looks really compelling that'll

06:56.200 --> 07:02.000
ship with Debian. The Pandora folks are getting ready to ship the Pyra. I think I'm saying

07:02.000 --> 07:09.480
that right. P-Y-R-A. It's a 5-inch LCD touchscreen. It has gaming controls on it, but it also

07:09.480 --> 07:16.200
has a full QWERTY little mini keyboard. It looks about the size of a older Nintendo 3DS.

07:16.200 --> 07:20.800
It has a 1.5 gigahertz dual-core ARM CPU, which you could upgrade and get up to 4 gigs

07:20.800 --> 07:26.320
of RAM, backlit keyboard. And yeah, Debian pre-installed on these. And these guys have

07:26.320 --> 07:30.340
a history of shipping. It's a pretty compelling little device. And if you want something super

07:30.340 --> 07:34.560
mobile, I like it. And Joe, you'll like this too, at least in the screenshots. It's run

07:34.560 --> 07:35.560
on XFCE.

07:35.560 --> 07:39.080
Well, it's the only desktop that makes sense.

07:39.080 --> 07:44.600
So there's actually a few. When you stop thinking about the consumer handhelds like the Galaxy

07:44.600 --> 07:48.520
phones and the Nexus phones, and you start thinking about these really awesome geeky

07:48.520 --> 07:53.760
devices that, honestly, only a niche is going to want to buy, but that's fine. Debian starts

07:53.760 --> 07:57.720
to make a lot of sense here. The Xero phone was an interesting one, but also they're working

07:57.720 --> 08:04.160
on the Samsung Galaxy S Relay 4G. Now, I just said don't target consumer phones, but if

08:04.160 --> 08:09.320
you do need something that can make calls for some reason, and you want something running

08:09.320 --> 08:14.080
Debian, that's also going to be an option. But the pirate in me had the most compelling

08:14.080 --> 08:20.960
feature set, a really nice modular handheld computer with gaming controls, Wi-Fi, multiple

08:20.960 --> 08:27.600
SD card slots, USB ports. You can get it in Europe or the US, and it's going to be pre-loaded

08:27.600 --> 08:32.640
with Debian. The only downside, when I started to get a little bit more interested in it

08:32.640 --> 08:41.040
and looked at the pre-orders, the one I would want with four gigs of RAM is about $670 US.

08:41.040 --> 08:45.960
A little too expensive for me. Yeah. Well, it's funny, kind of related. While I've been

08:45.960 --> 08:51.080
here at Oddcamp, I got my hands on the GPD Pocket briefly. What do you think? Its build

08:51.080 --> 09:00.560
quality is brilliant. It's milled aluminum. It feels like a MacBook Pro type, but software-wise,

09:00.560 --> 09:05.760
it doesn't really work with certainly the LTS version of Ubuntu that was on there. Also,

09:05.760 --> 09:09.380
when I put it down on the table, it turned itself off and on again because of a loose

09:09.380 --> 09:15.160
connector in there. There's some quality control issues by the looks of things, but I really

09:15.160 --> 09:19.560
want one. If they weren't so expensive, I kind of wish I'd backed it now, but you see

09:19.560 --> 09:23.600
it all at Oddcamp. It's brilliant. There's another device coming out soon that is sort

09:23.600 --> 09:30.120
of making me also interested. This space is really starting to get interesting. My better

09:30.120 --> 09:35.280
sense says, wait another generation. That's what my better sense tells me, but my early

09:35.280 --> 09:40.240
adopter sense says, jump in now. It's obviously getting more and more interesting. We'll have

09:40.240 --> 09:44.920
some links in the show notes if you guys want to check it out, but in the meantime, those

09:44.920 --> 09:48.800
of us that have existing devices and nothing's really compelling to us, that's the situation

09:48.800 --> 09:54.600
I find myself in with my Nexus 6P. Lineage is starting to look more and more attractive,

09:54.600 --> 09:58.440
and they've recently launched a summer survey that I have to be honest with you, Joe. After

09:58.440 --> 10:02.740
I started taking the survey, even though I'm not a recent lineage user, it actually made

10:02.740 --> 10:07.400
me want to use lineage more and more. I hadn't realized how great it's gotten, and just looking

10:07.400 --> 10:10.300
at some of the questions in the survey, it's really standing out.

10:10.300 --> 10:14.180
I haven't used anything else apart from it. Well, I used Android Ice Cold, which is based

10:14.180 --> 10:19.880
on it, for a while, but as soon as I bought my OnePlus 3T a couple of weeks ago, literally

10:19.880 --> 10:22.080
the first thing I did was flash lineage on it.

10:22.080 --> 10:27.460
Yeah, you did. That is the fact I remember. It was basically, hey, I got this, and it's

10:27.460 --> 10:32.660
already running lineage, which is pretty funny. There was no gap. For me, I've just got the

10:32.660 --> 10:37.800
Nexus line of devices because I wanted to just get it directly from Google, and I thought

10:37.800 --> 10:42.080
if I'm going to be on an Android device, I should just run as close to what Google envisions

10:42.080 --> 10:44.160
for Android as possible.

10:44.160 --> 10:48.680
What I've discovered by that is it's not good enough, and it's boring, and I don't use my

10:48.680 --> 10:53.900
Nexus 6P as much. Lineage seems like a great way to sort of inject a little bit of life

10:53.900 --> 10:56.820
back into the device and make it a little more compelling again.

10:56.820 --> 10:59.840
The survey is linked in the show notes. If you're a lineage user and you want to give

10:59.840 --> 11:04.600
them your thoughts, they're calling it their summer survey, and they have divided it into

11:04.600 --> 11:10.920
five areas, apps, wallpapers, features, infrastructure, and how they handle public relations. So it's

11:10.920 --> 11:17.320
worth checking out lineageos.org slash summer dash survey, or go over to linuxactionnews.com

11:17.320 --> 11:19.560
slash 15 and find the link in the show notes.

11:19.560 --> 11:23.600
Yeah, and the thing is that you have no right to complain about a project if you don't take

11:23.600 --> 11:29.240
part in these surveys. I will always do a survey if I can because that's the best way

11:29.240 --> 11:36.320
to give them direct feedback, crowdsourced info and opinions. So if you do use Lineage,

11:36.320 --> 11:39.820
then I urge you do go and fill this out and help them out. It's a very simple way to give

11:39.820 --> 11:46.240
them a couple of minutes of your time to really help the project out.

11:46.240 --> 11:50.020

working on your project. DigitalOcean.com promo code, here's the thing. Everything uses

12:08.560 --> 12:13.680
SSDs, they have a simple API, they have highly available block storage, lightning fast networking

12:13.680 --> 12:18.760
with private networking that doesn't count against your transfer, which is really brilliant.

12:18.760 --> 12:23.040
If you have a front end proxy server connecting to back end web servers or doing backups on

12:23.040 --> 12:27.000
their back end, that private networking is over their data center land too, so it's crazy

12:27.000 --> 12:31.240
fast. They have load balancing as a service, team support if you want to work with a group,

12:31.240 --> 12:36.000
and monitoring and alerting to make you look like a boss. DigitalOcean.com, use our promo

12:40.840 --> 12:47.640
it is. DigitalOcean.com promo code, here's the thing.

12:47.640 --> 12:52.760
One of the projects that I've been watching closely for a few years now is Solus, and

12:52.760 --> 12:59.240
this week they've come out with Solus 3. Now, full disclosure, Aiki, the founder and lead

12:59.240 --> 13:04.040
developer of Solus, is on my other podcast, Late Night Linux, so I'm pretty much bound

13:04.040 --> 13:07.800
to say good things about it, but this is a really solid release.

13:07.800 --> 13:12.560
Yeah, this is the third iteration of Solus since they've moved to a rolling release,

13:12.560 --> 13:17.240
and I wanted to watch this kind of come out a couple of times after that transition, and

13:17.240 --> 13:20.600
it was this one that made me install it on the machine I'm sitting in front of right

13:20.600 --> 13:25.060
now, which is one of my most important machines in the studio. They've moved from a regular

13:25.060 --> 13:29.880
snapshot model that a lot of traditional distributions take, and they've now gone with sort of a

13:29.880 --> 13:35.560
hybrid curated rolling release model, and that works perfect for me because it keeps

13:35.560 --> 13:40.200
the applications fresh. I've opted to use the LTS kernel and the LTS video drivers,

13:40.200 --> 13:45.600
so those remain constant and stable, and I think it's a really good balance for me. This

13:45.600 --> 13:52.320
is also the first release of Solus to ship with an LSM by default. The Linux security

13:52.320 --> 13:59.320
models like SE Linux or App Armor that are essentially a control list or a control system

13:59.320 --> 14:03.980
that prevent applications from going outside certain boundaries, and Solus hadn't really

14:03.980 --> 14:08.560
picked a horse in that race, and now they've chosen App Armor, and by shipping App Armor

14:08.560 --> 14:14.360
by default, they've also brought in a bunch of the support they need to ship really good

14:14.360 --> 14:20.680
Snap support, like great, essentially Ubuntu-level Snap support with full confinement using the

14:20.680 --> 14:25.960
Linux security module within their own kernel, which this module happens to be App Armor

14:25.960 --> 14:31.680
to use Snap. So now we have complete Flatpak with confinement support and Snaps with confinement

14:31.680 --> 14:35.880
support on Solus, which is great for users of the operating system that might want to

14:35.880 --> 14:39.320
install something that isn't in their curated repository.

14:39.320 --> 14:44.840
Well that was one of the biggest criticisms to date of Solus, that the repo is relatively

14:44.840 --> 14:51.400
small compared to Debian or Ubuntu, for example, and now this basically takes care of that,

14:51.400 --> 14:53.040
or it certainly will in the future.

14:53.040 --> 14:56.080
Yeah I am looking forward to adding support for a couple of applications I don't think

14:56.080 --> 15:01.400
they would ever want to package, maybe things that run more as a server with NGINX, and

15:01.400 --> 15:05.080
I'm thinking of certain Usenet clients and whatnot that I just don't think would ever

15:05.080 --> 15:09.120
end up in the user repository for Solus. So this is pretty cool, it also represents some

15:09.120 --> 15:16.840
pretty great cross-platform collaboration between the canonical Snapcraft folks and Solus, which

15:16.840 --> 15:21.080
we got a little bit of the backstory on last week's Linux Unplugged from Wimpy and iKey,

15:21.080 --> 15:24.400
which sounded like essentially they just had to kind of point him in the right direction

15:24.400 --> 15:28.160
and he was able to roll all this in, but fascinating nonetheless.

15:28.160 --> 15:32.760
Not to focus too much on Snaps because there's a ton of other pretty great features in their

15:32.760 --> 15:38.240
custom desktop budgie 10.4, which has new animations, a new alt tab, a new nightlight

15:38.240 --> 15:43.320
feature that changes the color tones at night, all other kinds of really nice things including

15:43.320 --> 15:47.880
modifications to the menu that I really appreciate as a new adopter of the budgie desktop.

15:47.880 --> 15:51.520
Not to mention the most important thing, to put the panel in the correct place at last

15:51.520 --> 15:53.440
on the bottom.

15:53.440 --> 15:57.800
You know I read somebody say on the internet recently that Solus is one of the most newsworthy

15:57.800 --> 16:02.600
Linux distributions, and I have to agree. There's a lot happening here, and it's been

16:02.600 --> 16:04.960
fascinating to watch it for a little while myself.

16:04.960 --> 16:10.840
Yeah, it seems like we were right when we said that once iKey goes full time, development's

16:10.840 --> 16:15.640
going to accelerate, and it's just gone at an amazing speed. It was already going pretty

16:15.640 --> 16:20.560
quickly and it was already quite newsworthy, but it seems like iKey's going to be providing

16:20.560 --> 16:24.800
us with news for weeks and months and years to come.

16:24.800 --> 16:28.520
I totally agree. In fact, I'm looking forward to it. It's one of the reasons I installed

16:28.520 --> 16:33.060
it. I'm also always following news around the ZFS file system and getting better support

16:33.060 --> 16:38.620
for ZFS on Linux, and finally it looks like we might be getting decent encryption support.

16:38.620 --> 16:42.920
Which I would have thought for certain enterprise use cases is absolutely essential.

16:42.920 --> 16:48.360
I wonder how many people encrypt their NASs or their SANs in an enterprise. People listening,

16:48.360 --> 16:53.000
I'd like to know. Tweet us at Linux Action News or at ChrisLAS and let me know. Do you

16:53.000 --> 16:58.280
encrypt your data center storage? I could definitely picture encrypting any mediums

16:58.280 --> 17:06.000
that leave the data center, like backup drives or tapes or absolutely laptops, but large,

17:06.000 --> 17:09.760
large storage volumes. Do people actively encrypt those? I'm not sure.

17:09.760 --> 17:14.040
I would have thought so with certain areas like banking and where it's really critical

17:14.040 --> 17:15.040
security.

17:15.040 --> 17:21.080
Yeah, you definitely have controls around the data and restrictions and lots of protection,

17:21.080 --> 17:25.560
but encryption at rest comes with a pretty big considerable overhead when you have high

17:25.560 --> 17:31.000
usage applications hitting that drive a lot. So there's a big cost to doing that. I don't

17:31.000 --> 17:34.960
know. Maybe I'm a little old school on this, but to me it seems like you definitely encrypt

17:34.960 --> 17:39.720
the network during transit. You definitely encrypt any data leaving the data center,

17:39.720 --> 17:46.240
absolutely. But often on the LAN itself, you just manage it with access control lists and

17:46.240 --> 17:48.000
file permissions.

17:48.000 --> 17:51.760
So I wonder if it hasn't been a big concern for Linux. But they have been working on it

17:51.760 --> 17:55.600
for months. The patches go back for months and months, and it was just really until this

17:55.600 --> 18:01.800
last week that they felt like it was matured enough for merging into the upstream code.

18:01.800 --> 18:06.440
So you're going to have to wait for these updates to come downstream to you, but there's

18:06.440 --> 18:12.440
16,000 new lines of code. There's a fun fact along with this new Linux encryption support

18:12.440 --> 18:13.440
on ZFS.

18:13.440 --> 18:19.920
Yeah, so I wonder if this is one more small nail in B-tree FS's coffin. What do you think?

18:19.920 --> 18:24.760
I'm going to take the other side on that now. I think ButterFS is essentially untouchable.

18:24.760 --> 18:29.320
All of the shots that it can be, it's not dead yet, Joe. It's just a flesh wound and

18:29.320 --> 18:34.220
it's still going. Because where it's useful, there's certain NAS devices that ship it by

18:34.220 --> 18:40.400
default on the NAS hard drives. There is certain large Linux distributions out there that insist

18:40.400 --> 18:44.800
on shipping it. And there's certain crazy data mining corporations that run it on their

18:44.800 --> 18:47.520
edge network. They'll probably continue to do that for years.

18:47.520 --> 18:53.560
Yeah, well, SUSE are all in on it. Their whole basically update strategy relies on it because

18:53.560 --> 18:58.080
you need to have the rollback and they're not going to ship ZFS. They've made that very

18:58.080 --> 19:03.520
clear. So I think, yeah, even if it's only SUSE using it, it's going to stick around.

19:03.520 --> 19:07.840
Yeah, I'm glad because then we can really have a good turf war. Now we can have ZFS

19:07.840 --> 19:12.000
folks against ButterFS folks. And meanwhile, us Stratus hipsters over here will really

19:12.000 --> 19:14.200
have the high and mighty attitudes.

19:14.200 --> 19:19.000
Well, I'm just sitting here using XT4, what can I say?

19:19.000 --> 19:26.360
There's also a little upset in the Bitcoin community. Another fork is coming. Yes, we

19:26.360 --> 19:30.080
know there was just another fork. Bitcoin Cash just happened. On Wednesday, a group

19:30.080 --> 19:35.160
of Bitcoiners scheduled yet another split for the network in November, which would create

19:35.160 --> 19:40.340
a third version of Bitcoin. Now the date's not set yet because it's based on the number

19:40.340 --> 19:45.200
of blocks. So once they reach a certain block number, the split happens.

19:45.200 --> 19:50.680
And so this all comes down to Segregated Witness, doesn't it? Which is a feature that was being

19:50.680 --> 19:54.640
debated as to whether they were going to implement it and it was going to help with this block

19:54.640 --> 20:02.240
size problem. And so it was implemented into the main Bitcoin, but that wasn't enough to

20:02.240 --> 20:06.540
stop the fork of Bitcoin Cash where they just said, we don't care about Segregated Witness.

20:06.540 --> 20:11.800
We just want a bigger block size. And now this other fork is people want both. They

20:11.800 --> 20:17.040
want a bigger block size and Segregated Witness to basically optimize the block size as much

20:17.040 --> 20:18.040
as possible.

20:18.040 --> 20:25.320
It's going by two names, SigWit2x and BTC1, I believe. And its two main differences would

20:25.320 --> 20:31.840
be a two megabyte block size versus OG Bitcoin's one megabyte. And it would also include the

20:31.840 --> 20:36.880
new Segregated Witness. But that's not the interesting part about any of this. The interesting

20:36.880 --> 20:44.040
part about this is how fired up the Bitcoin community is. This appears to be a much bigger

20:44.040 --> 20:50.640
deal than the last split. And it's potentially going to be much more noticeable. There is

20:50.640 --> 20:57.040
a bunch of Bitcoin Core developers and Bitcoin Core community members who are very vocal.

20:57.040 --> 21:04.040
Henry Braid is one of these. A vocal person that's been promoting Bitcoin since 2011.

21:04.040 --> 21:08.640
He's a frequent speaker at events. He's very knowledgeable about Bitcoin and the blockchain.

21:08.640 --> 21:13.960
And he tweeted this morning, the SigWit2x hard fork scheduled for November is an attempted

21:13.960 --> 21:21.760
hostile corporate takeover of the Bitcoin protocol. Fight it and educate people.

21:21.760 --> 21:26.400
They're saying that New York business interests are coming out and it may even be a state

21:26.400 --> 21:34.000
takeover. And meanwhile, the SigWit2x folks are saying we have 80% of the hashing power.

21:34.000 --> 21:40.280
We have these former core developers on our side. Let's give this a go and let's see just

21:40.280 --> 21:46.360
where the cards lie. And it's getting really volatile back and forth. This is the interesting

21:46.360 --> 21:47.360
fork.

21:47.360 --> 21:52.120
Yeah, because Bitcoin Cash, it's not done massively well. It's done better than I expected,

21:52.120 --> 21:57.860
I must say, but people have just kept using Bitcoin basically. So you think that now this

21:57.860 --> 22:01.880
might be serious, that people might actually start using this other fork?

22:01.880 --> 22:08.340
I think it could be the combination effect of Bitcoin Cash and SigWit2x. Bitcoin Cash,

22:08.340 --> 22:13.480
if you mine, is more profitable right now than original Bitcoin. So if you're in the

22:13.480 --> 22:17.520
mining game, you can actually make more money with Bitcoin Cash. So that's going to eat

22:17.520 --> 22:23.100
away a bit of Bitcoin. And then SigWit2x comes along with their two megabyte blocks and segregated

22:23.100 --> 22:28.940
witness and big professional slick industry backing, quote unquote, the corporate people

22:28.940 --> 22:32.920
that are trying to take it over. It could be really appealing. And if you get companies

22:32.920 --> 22:38.920
like Coinbase and Bitpay, who is Bitpay is one of the big companies behind this, this

22:38.920 --> 22:43.520
could by default just become the elephant in the room, could suck all of the oxygen.

22:43.520 --> 22:47.420
I can't think of another metaphor. Could snuff, no, got nothing, Joe. But there's a lot of

22:47.420 --> 22:51.740
metaphors you could throw at this. Like there's this the metaphor, the metaphor potential

22:51.740 --> 22:52.740
is high.

22:52.740 --> 22:57.520
Yeah, it's we live in fascinating times with the whole Bitcoin thing. I'm just waiting

22:57.520 --> 23:01.540
for it to crash so I can invest again, because it seems to go up, crash right and then go

23:01.540 --> 23:03.980
up and go even higher than it was before.

23:03.980 --> 23:07.380
Those of us that follow Bitcoin call that a sale. Yeah, there's a you're waiting for

23:07.380 --> 23:11.220
the Bitcoin sale. Hopefully it'll come. As we record right now, it's somewhere north

23:11.220 --> 23:15.900
of $4000, which is just absolutely insane. It's mind blowing, isn't it? I've been I've

23:15.900 --> 23:22.340
been following Bitcoin since it was below $1. So sometimes it makes me want to break

23:22.340 --> 23:27.060
out the old plan B. But I tell you what, I'm too busy doing this here show, which you can
