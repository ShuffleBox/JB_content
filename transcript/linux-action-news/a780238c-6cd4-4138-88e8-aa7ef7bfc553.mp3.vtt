00:00.000 --> 00:16.440
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, our weekly take on Linux and the open source world.

00:16.440 --> 00:20.380
This is episode 57, recorded on June 10th, 2018.

00:20.380 --> 00:21.380
I'm Chris.

00:21.380 --> 00:22.380
And I'm Joe.

00:22.380 --> 00:23.380
Hello, Joe.

00:23.380 --> 00:26.860
It's good to be connected with you one last time from Austin, Texas.

00:26.860 --> 00:32.140
And we're going to start this week's episode with news that was still reverberating at Texas

00:32.140 --> 00:33.800
Linux Fest this weekend.

00:33.800 --> 00:35.880
It's Microsoft buying GitHub.

00:35.880 --> 00:42.640
Yeah, this was brewing just before we recorded last time, but it became official on the Monday.

00:42.640 --> 00:47.200
And it seems to have sent shockwaves throughout the whole FOSS community, doesn't it?

00:47.200 --> 00:49.160
Shockwaves might actually be putting it mildly.

00:49.160 --> 00:52.160
Even though it's sort of cliche to say it, it really is true.

00:52.160 --> 00:56.480
It was probably the number one conversation starter at Texas Linux Fest is what do you

00:56.480 --> 00:58.680
think of Microsoft buying GitHub?

00:58.680 --> 01:01.120
And then everybody had an opinion.

01:01.120 --> 01:03.480
And you've seen that also reflect online.

01:03.480 --> 01:09.000
And they are pretty varying opinions from people bailing from GitHub to GitLab or something

01:09.000 --> 01:13.200
like it, to people thinking that perhaps it's going to be a good investment long term and

01:13.200 --> 01:17.280
that GitHub was going to get purchased anyway, so it might have well been Microsoft.

01:17.280 --> 01:18.960
And a couple of interesting points were brought up.

01:18.960 --> 01:22.640
A few folks said to me, well, I'm just glad it's not Google, and I'm just glad it's not

01:22.640 --> 01:23.640
Amazon.

01:23.640 --> 01:27.240
But I think for myself right now, I'm sort of in a wait and see period, curious to see

01:27.240 --> 01:32.280
what Nat Friedman does with it, and I could see it going good or bad.

01:32.280 --> 01:35.320
I think ultimately, it's not a good thing.

01:35.320 --> 01:39.320
When Microsoft gets involved with anything, it's not a good thing, is it?

01:39.320 --> 01:44.200
And I think that if I had any code on GitHub, I would be migrating it or at least backing

01:44.200 --> 01:47.640
it up on another service like GitLab.

01:47.640 --> 01:51.680
But I think that not much is going to change, at least in the short term, because they can't

01:51.680 --> 01:55.840
afford the ill will of making huge changes to it right now.

01:55.840 --> 02:00.320
The changes that we're going to see are going to be over probably two, three, four, five

02:00.320 --> 02:07.120
years where these Microsoft features and connections to Azure and stuff are going to be sort of

02:07.120 --> 02:14.080
drip fed into it bit by bit, and then it may become unrecognizable down the line.

02:14.080 --> 02:17.440
I don't think that's fair to say, though, because I don't think it will be unrecognizable.

02:17.440 --> 02:22.120
I think that the core functionality will still remain, and I think that they're just going

02:22.120 --> 02:27.320
to add stuff to it that most people who don't want it will just be able to ignore.

02:27.320 --> 02:31.440
It is hard to say where GitHub would have gone in the future had they remained independent,

02:31.440 --> 02:36.240
which may have been my preference, but Microsoft still would have had substantial influence

02:36.240 --> 02:37.740
over the platform.

02:37.740 --> 02:44.520
If you just look at the raw numbers, Microsoft has almost 5,000 unique committers to different

02:44.520 --> 02:51.240
open source projects on GitHub, 5,000 different employees at Microsoft that are committing

02:51.240 --> 02:53.160
to different projects.

02:53.160 --> 02:54.320
That's a huge number.

02:54.320 --> 02:58.040
Yeah, but that doesn't necessarily mean that they have influence over the platform.

02:58.040 --> 02:59.200
See, I disagree.

02:59.200 --> 03:00.200
I think it does.

03:00.200 --> 03:04.020
I think, and Microsoft points out that they're the most active organization on GitHub.

03:04.020 --> 03:08.160
They're the biggest company on there with two million commits.

03:08.160 --> 03:14.720
I think it's naive to say that the largest creators or the largest providers or whatever

03:14.720 --> 03:19.580
category we're talking about of a service, whoever's the biggest customer to that service

03:19.580 --> 03:22.240
has influence over the platform.

03:22.240 --> 03:25.240
I've also noticed a definite split.

03:25.240 --> 03:28.960
A lot of the developers I've talked to through CoderRadio's email inbox, but also here at

03:28.960 --> 03:32.860
Texas Linux Fest, they're sort of nonchalant, I guess.

03:32.860 --> 03:37.120
They're more wait and see, but a lot of the enthusiasts, people that have enthusiast projects

03:37.120 --> 03:41.800
or are not necessarily full-time developers, they seem to be reacting more negatively.

03:41.800 --> 03:46.200
I think a lot of people who just use this as a tool to do their work, and they may be

03:46.200 --> 03:49.760
already using other Microsoft tools, they're not nearly as concerned.

03:49.760 --> 03:54.080
People that were using it as a place to store a passion project seem to be much more concerned,

03:54.080 --> 03:57.280
and I think maybe those people needed a good reminder about centralization of services

03:57.280 --> 03:58.280
to begin with.

03:58.280 --> 04:01.480
Well, I remember in the predictions episode that we did at the end of last year, you talked

04:01.480 --> 04:08.800
about this split between pragmatists and idealists, and I think that this is a perfect example

04:08.800 --> 04:10.000
of that.

04:10.000 --> 04:17.200
People's reaction does seem to be quite polarized between, meh, whatever, and the sky is falling,

04:17.200 --> 04:21.160
we need to move off to GitLab straight away.

04:21.160 --> 04:27.860
I think that you're right, it is more of the passion projects, the free software people,

04:27.860 --> 04:31.680
but then you have to question, as you said, why were they on there in the first place?

04:31.680 --> 04:38.500
Because it is not a free software platform, there are big parts of it that are proprietary,

04:38.500 --> 04:44.440
and maybe it's a good thing that it's shaken them into realizing that they probably oughtn't

04:44.440 --> 04:45.440
to be there.

04:45.440 --> 04:49.880
I mean, that said, I would have definitely moved my code off there, or at least backed

04:49.880 --> 04:55.840
it up, as I said, so I could see why they've done that, but I think that the bigger, more

04:55.840 --> 05:00.200
pragmatic projects are just not going to do that, are they?

05:00.200 --> 05:05.000
They're just going to see what happens, and it is decentralized enough, it's quite a hassle

05:05.000 --> 05:12.400
to move away from GitHub, but because Git itself is potentially decentralized, you can

05:12.400 --> 05:15.000
migrate relatively easily.

05:15.000 --> 05:17.220
I want to go back to a point you just made, though.

05:17.220 --> 05:19.120
Why were they on there in the first place?

05:19.120 --> 05:20.840
Why are they using Slack?

05:20.840 --> 05:22.140
Why are they using Discord?

05:22.140 --> 05:26.760
I think this is a great time for open source projects and free software to look at the

05:26.760 --> 05:30.880
different services they're using, the centralized services, because it's likely Slack's going

05:30.880 --> 05:34.400
to get bought one day, too, and then are we going to have another round of freakouts?

05:34.400 --> 05:36.540
Do we learn nothing from this lesson?

05:36.540 --> 05:42.920
This is a great moment to stop and reevaluate, and I don't think this is a loss for GitHub.

05:42.920 --> 05:46.600
I don't think these projects that are concerned about this were the right fit to begin with.

05:46.600 --> 05:50.600
They probably should have been on a different self-hosted platform to begin with, so I think

05:50.600 --> 05:52.480
this will balance itself out.

05:52.480 --> 05:54.760
We'll probably stop talking about it in a few months.

05:54.760 --> 05:58.880
Just around then, Nat Friedman will actually take over towards the end of the year, and

05:58.880 --> 06:00.640
then things, I think, will start to get interesting.

06:00.640 --> 06:04.320
But what do you think about this $7.5 billion price tag?

06:04.320 --> 06:05.600
Yeah, isn't that something?

06:05.600 --> 06:07.280
Now that's in stock for Microsoft.

06:07.280 --> 06:12.640
That's Microsoft's stock value of $7.5 billion, but the way these Azure services seem to be

06:12.640 --> 06:15.200
selling, that's probably going to be going in the right direction.

06:15.200 --> 06:19.900
That's a huge number, and I've heard it's many multitudes larger than their actual revenue

06:19.900 --> 06:20.900
and worth.

06:20.900 --> 06:25.360
Well, yeah, if you look at how many premium subscribers they have and stuff, it's just

06:25.360 --> 06:26.840
nowhere near that.

06:26.840 --> 06:29.920
It seems to be massively overvalued.

06:29.920 --> 06:33.720
Is it just because Microsoft have just got all the money in the world that can just afford

06:33.720 --> 06:38.120
it, or have they seen something that the rest of us haven't?

06:38.120 --> 06:39.680
Well, I think a lot of us have seen it.

06:39.680 --> 06:41.920
I just don't think anyone's made a move on it.

06:41.920 --> 06:45.840
Think about where GitHub sits in the workflow, how central that is, and how it sits between

06:45.840 --> 06:48.480
many different services.

06:48.480 --> 06:50.440
It's really a valuable position.

06:50.440 --> 06:54.400
Because they were an independent operator for so long, they're built into so many workflows

06:54.400 --> 06:58.800
from the AUR to people deploying their websites.

06:58.800 --> 07:03.200
It's such a key part of software development for so many different shops, and it's been

07:03.200 --> 07:08.200
so platform agnostic for so long that that made it very valuable, because the developers

07:08.200 --> 07:10.340
could use it as sort of this middle layer.

07:10.340 --> 07:13.800
And I think Microsoft had realized that because they put so much of their stuff on there.

07:13.800 --> 07:19.240
I had a couple of little birdies tell me from Microsoft that they're going to mutiny if

07:19.240 --> 07:24.520
Microsoft screws this up, because so many people now inside Microsoft use it for their

07:24.520 --> 07:29.760
own projects, plus the projects they're contributing to that are open source, that if Microsoft

07:29.760 --> 07:32.840
were to mess it up, it would destroy their workflow internally.

07:32.840 --> 07:36.520
Well, yeah, that's another reason why they aren't going to screw this up, or are very

07:36.520 --> 07:39.600
unlikely to, along with the goodwill factor.

07:39.600 --> 07:43.960
They don't want the ill will from developers all over the world.

07:43.960 --> 07:47.840
There are people, especially in our circles, who have freaked out and moved away, but all

07:47.840 --> 07:53.800
the pragmatists that we talked about, they are probably quite skeptical and keeping one

07:53.800 --> 08:00.000
eye on it and will be ready to jump ship if major changes are made.

08:00.000 --> 08:06.360
So it's not just the people within Microsoft that are probably, you know, half planning

08:06.360 --> 08:07.360
a mutiny.

08:07.360 --> 08:10.320
But it just seems so unlikely that they would do that.

08:10.320 --> 08:14.760
They wouldn't have spent that much money on something that they wanted to fundamentally

08:14.760 --> 08:15.760
change.

08:15.760 --> 08:19.480
I was joking at Texas Linux Fest when people would start the conversation, and sort of

08:19.480 --> 08:23.380
the way I would wrap it up is I'd say, if I were Microsoft, I'd take all this money

08:23.380 --> 08:27.680
that I have and I just set some aside and say, we're just going to let this run just

08:27.680 --> 08:30.960
to prove to all those skeptics that we weren't going to screw it up.

08:30.960 --> 08:33.920
And they'll just do it to make a point.

08:33.920 --> 08:38.320
This could be their way to buy reputation long term into the software development community

08:38.320 --> 08:42.560
and specifically the open source, maybe not free software, communities.

08:42.560 --> 08:47.360
And so they could really just play a long game here of proving everyone wrong.

08:47.360 --> 08:49.240
And that would almost be worth the purchase in itself.

08:49.240 --> 08:53.480
Well, yeah, and it's not likely to lose value, is it?

08:53.480 --> 08:57.600
So they could probably offload it at some point in the future if they had to.

08:57.600 --> 09:01.680
And there'll probably be at least a small amount of revenue coming in, it'll probably

09:01.680 --> 09:02.800
pay for itself.

09:02.800 --> 09:06.560
So yeah, it seems like a relatively small price to pay.

09:06.560 --> 09:13.320
I mean, it's a lot of money, don't get me wrong, but for Microsoft to buy that Goodwill,

09:13.320 --> 09:14.600
potentially not.

09:14.600 --> 09:19.920
But if they do mess it all up, we can all revolt by switching to React OS.

09:19.920 --> 09:23.600
One of the best little projects out there just got even cooler.

09:23.600 --> 09:27.400
Yeah, it's not been long since we talked about React OS and you tried it out and were very

09:27.400 --> 09:29.000
impressed with it.

09:29.000 --> 09:31.480
And they've hit a major milestone now.

09:31.480 --> 09:34.320
It can be built by itself.

09:34.320 --> 09:40.400
So rather than having to use Windows or another Unix-like system to build it, you can do it

09:40.400 --> 09:41.800
from within React OS.

09:41.800 --> 09:44.360
So it's a self-hosting operating system now.

09:44.360 --> 09:46.640
Yeah, and it will create a live CD for you.

09:46.640 --> 09:47.640
It'll mount it.

09:47.640 --> 09:52.560
And they say in their tweet to announce it, it even builds with a USB stack, which just

09:52.560 --> 09:53.560
is so Windows.

09:53.560 --> 09:54.560
It's wonderful.

09:54.560 --> 09:59.180
The thing is, though, this is a milestone that iOS devices haven't even reached yet.

09:59.180 --> 10:01.720
So it's pretty impressive if you think about it in that context.

10:01.720 --> 10:03.120
Well, yeah, and Android.

10:03.120 --> 10:04.120
Can you build that on Android?

10:04.120 --> 10:05.120
I don't think you can.

10:05.120 --> 10:06.120
Can you?

10:06.120 --> 10:07.520
You know, I've made that claim before.

10:07.520 --> 10:10.940
And then we got a bunch of well, actuallys where people had all these different ways

10:10.940 --> 10:12.160
they can pull it off.

10:12.160 --> 10:16.700
So I don't think there's an official way, but people seem to have figured out a way.

10:16.700 --> 10:18.640
But I can't think of a way you could do it with iOS.

10:18.640 --> 10:21.600
Yeah, and look how mature that is as an operating system.

10:21.600 --> 10:27.080
But I think that says more about the control that Apple want to have over it rather than

10:27.080 --> 10:28.960
the technical limitations of it.

10:28.960 --> 10:30.640
So really, what it is, this is all building.

10:30.640 --> 10:36.440
This is one of the many things they're building towards ReactOS 0.49, which will have general

10:36.440 --> 10:43.760
kernel fixes, shell improvements, and really some good bug fixes to the Win32 subsystem,

10:43.760 --> 10:48.120
as well as your favorite, Joe, those little balloon pop-up error messages that they sort

10:48.120 --> 10:53.080
of started with Windows 7, you know, the little down by the.

10:53.080 --> 10:56.160
I just love this project, and it's so cool.

10:56.160 --> 11:00.760
And so this is part of it, is getting ReactOS to a place where it can build itself.

11:00.760 --> 11:06.060
The developers can now start continuing to just develop on ReactOS and actually create

11:06.060 --> 11:07.060
new builds right there.

11:07.060 --> 11:11.160
But we as end users have the benefit of being able to generate those live CDs.

11:11.160 --> 11:12.360
I think this is really neat.

11:12.360 --> 11:16.580
And think about the possibilities for building rescue systems for your friends and family

11:16.580 --> 11:17.600
in the future.

11:17.600 --> 11:18.760
It's going places, Joe.

11:18.760 --> 11:23.480
Well, yeah, if they're lucky, they might even get bought by Microsoft, eh?

11:23.480 --> 11:29.560
Speaking of going places, TrueOS seems to be going into new territory.

11:29.560 --> 11:32.960
And there's a bit of a fork at play here.

11:32.960 --> 11:35.680
We're not quite sure exactly what the situation is.

11:35.680 --> 11:39.840
I'm sure our friends over at BSD Now will update us when they return from BSD Can.

11:39.840 --> 11:42.520
But it appears there's a shift in focus for TrueOS.

11:42.520 --> 11:46.840
Yeah, they say that they're going to focus on a core operating system, but then they

11:46.840 --> 11:50.040
clarify that, no, it's not going to be called CoreOS.

11:50.040 --> 11:53.640
They know there's already something that exists with that name.

11:53.640 --> 11:55.540
But it isn't clear, really.

11:55.540 --> 11:58.720
The communication is a bit muddled.

11:58.720 --> 12:07.480
They talk about it becoming a downstream fork of FreeBSD and much more of a general OS rather

12:07.480 --> 12:10.760
than the desktop OS that we're used to.

12:10.760 --> 12:17.760
And in order to have a desktop-focused version of it, they are creating a new project called

12:17.760 --> 12:18.760
Project Trident.

12:18.760 --> 12:19.760
Right.

12:19.760 --> 12:22.400
So they essentially have two new systems here.

12:22.400 --> 12:24.840
TrueOS is turning into something else.

12:24.840 --> 12:28.620
And the desktop version that was TrueOS is becoming Project Trident.

12:28.620 --> 12:33.800
And Project Trident is going to continue to be sort of a FreeBSD graphical-based Lumina

12:33.800 --> 12:39.360
desktop project led by Chris Moore, producer of Q5SYS from Jupiter Broadcasting.

12:39.360 --> 12:43.280
I believe Chris Moore's brother, as well as another individual.

12:43.280 --> 12:48.680
They're going to continue Trident, which will be a Lumina-based FreeBSD desktop.

12:48.680 --> 12:55.720
And then TrueOS over time, they say, is going to go modular, more core-centric, perfect

12:55.720 --> 13:02.920
for do-it-yourself advanced users that will use OpenRC and LibreSSL.

13:02.920 --> 13:08.400
And it'll have a JSON-based manifest, integrated procedure and package tools, and a bunch of

13:08.400 --> 13:13.980
other things that you can use to reproduce systems for mass deployment.

13:13.980 --> 13:19.680
And it seems to be an effort to, as they actually put it, innovate on FreeBSD and make it more

13:19.680 --> 13:20.680
modern.

13:20.680 --> 13:24.880
Well, that somewhat answers the question as to what value this adds over FreeBSD.

13:24.880 --> 13:32.000
But it was always about being really easy to use and being a sort of hassle-free way

13:32.000 --> 13:38.800
to get into BSD, whereas if it's now going to be potentially more powerful and more configurable,

13:38.800 --> 13:42.520
it's going to be much less easy to use for people, isn't it?

13:42.520 --> 13:46.640
So at that point, surely you would just use FreeBSD.

13:46.640 --> 13:48.920
This is like the tip of the iceberg of some of the questions I have.

13:48.920 --> 13:51.600
Like it's really, there seems to be some sort of fork here.

13:51.600 --> 13:53.440
There's a separation of the teams.

13:53.440 --> 13:56.580
Chris Moore, who was originally involved with the founding of TrueOS, will no longer be

13:56.580 --> 13:57.580
involved with it.

13:57.580 --> 13:59.120
I just have a bunch of questions.

13:59.120 --> 14:03.560
I did reach out to Alan Jude and our friends over there to see if they could give us the

14:03.560 --> 14:05.740
scoop because they were at BSD Can.

14:05.740 --> 14:07.600
But they're traveling back right now from it.

14:07.600 --> 14:09.720
So when he lands, I might get an update from him.

14:09.720 --> 14:16.440
And if I do, I'll try to slip it into this week's Linux Unplugged.

14:16.440 --> 14:18.680
deo.co action.

14:18.680 --> 14:24.340
That's the landing page to get a $100 credit to try out DigitalOcean for 60 days when you

14:24.340 --> 14:26.280
sign up with a new account.

14:26.280 --> 14:31.080
It's a simple and scalable computing platform with industry-leading price to performance,

14:31.080 --> 14:34.040
predictable costs, and optimized types of compute.

14:34.040 --> 14:38.880
You can get my favorite rig for $0.03 an hour, or you can go grab their $15 a month where

14:38.880 --> 14:41.920
you mix and match the components to exactly what you need.

14:41.920 --> 14:44.720
But for me, personally, $0.03 an hour is what I go with.

14:44.720 --> 14:48.360
And then if I need a system with additional storage, I attach that block storage, and

14:48.360 --> 14:50.440
it works fantastic.

14:50.440 --> 14:52.600
DigitalOcean also has data centers all over the world.

14:52.600 --> 14:58.600
They have enterprise-grade SSDs, they have a great API, and they have a fantastic dashboard.

14:58.600 --> 15:02.320
It makes it simple for beginners or experts to deploy systems in minutes.

15:02.320 --> 15:06.360
They have cloud firewalls that block the traffic at the edge devices so it never even touches

15:06.360 --> 15:10.160
your rig, and they have 40 gigabit connections coming in to the hypervisors.

15:10.160 --> 15:14.600
Plus, they have add-on things like monitoring, alerting, that you can check on to see what

15:14.600 --> 15:20.040
the performance of your rig is, 99.9% SLA because that's just how DigitalOcean rolls,

15:20.040 --> 15:23.820
and fantastic documentation, and a huge community.

15:23.820 --> 15:26.680
And they support tons of open source projects.

15:26.680 --> 15:30.800
I really think they should have a page where they just list a few of the projects because

15:30.800 --> 15:36.220
I just met half a dozen this weekend where their infrastructure is provided by DigitalOcean.

15:36.220 --> 15:38.760
So they're a fantastic member of the open source community.

15:38.760 --> 15:44.040
It's a great value with predictable pricing, and when you go to dio.co slash action, you

15:44.040 --> 15:49.840
can get a $100 credit to try it out for free for 60 days when you sign up with a new account.

15:49.840 --> 15:51.140
It's mind-blowing.

15:51.140 --> 15:55.220
As somebody who used to go throw huge servers into racks and pay thousands of dollars for

15:55.220 --> 16:00.480
a T1 connection, I just can't even believe what I'm seeing today, and you can try it

16:00.480 --> 16:06.800
out for a long time with a $100 credit when you go to dio.co slash action.

16:06.800 --> 16:14.260
Okay, so there's been a bit of controversy in the KDE world this week.

16:14.260 --> 16:19.160
The maintainer of Kaywin, Martin Fleursa, has stepped down.

16:19.160 --> 16:20.920
Yeah, bit of a shame, isn't it?

16:20.920 --> 16:22.240
I really respected Martin.

16:22.240 --> 16:28.560
He's obviously a very knowledgeable developer, and I've always liked reading his posts about

16:28.560 --> 16:31.580
the rationale behind some of the decisions they've made from Kaywin, and I've always

16:31.580 --> 16:34.480
appreciated that he's been willing to get in the conversation.

16:34.480 --> 16:40.720
So I think it is a loss, but things do change, and he says, I currently really just follow

16:40.720 --> 16:41.720
up on reviews.

16:41.720 --> 16:43.680
I hardly contribute code anymore.

16:43.680 --> 16:48.200
I think it's time to pass the torch, he writes, and we'll have his resignation letter in the

16:48.200 --> 16:51.280
show notes if you want to read it, linuxactionnews.com slash 57.

16:51.280 --> 16:55.120
But he goes in and says, there's current things that I'm concerned with with the direction

16:55.120 --> 16:58.240
of the Plasma Desktop and the project in general.

16:58.240 --> 17:01.040
And he says, but in the end, I'll still be around, and I'll still be helping out.

17:01.040 --> 17:04.240
So it's nice to see this, and I say, here's the concerns.

17:04.240 --> 17:06.360
Here's what I think of somebody who's been here for a long time.

17:06.360 --> 17:08.160
This is something we need to be talking about.

17:08.160 --> 17:09.240
I'm not rage quitting.

17:09.240 --> 17:11.520
I'll still be around, but good luck.

17:11.520 --> 17:12.520
I'm passing the torch.

17:12.520 --> 17:17.800
Yeah, it's good to see him not just storming off, although he does make some quite strong

17:17.800 --> 17:25.200
points in here, specifically about the VDG, the visual design group, talking about how

17:25.200 --> 17:31.400
they make decisions without consulting the relevant domain experts, and he's just not

17:31.400 --> 17:33.520
happy with how they have been working.

17:33.520 --> 17:36.720
Yeah, and you know, the strongest point I think he tries to make in his resignation

17:36.720 --> 17:40.720
letter is he says they're on the road to KDE 3's problems with configuration nightmares

17:40.720 --> 17:43.520
and unmaintainable code.

17:43.520 --> 17:48.040
He's worried that they're too focused on trying to make everyone happy, and instead of just

17:48.040 --> 17:52.300
trying to focus on like 90% of making everyone happy and keep everything maintainable and

17:52.300 --> 17:57.480
keep it tight and long term, that would be more sustainable, and he thinks that was the

17:57.480 --> 18:02.040
initial direction of the project, but they've deviated from those goals in an effort to

18:02.040 --> 18:06.440
just try to get as much usability baked in as the project could possibly get, is get

18:06.440 --> 18:10.240
as much visual uplift as possible, get as many features to make as many people happy

18:10.240 --> 18:13.360
as possible, and he thinks that's not the right direction.

18:13.360 --> 18:18.740
But did you see the comments from Alessandro Longo about how the idea that the visual design

18:18.740 --> 18:21.120
group is one entity is a bit spurious?

18:21.120 --> 18:26.920
Yeah, I agree, and also I think that a large part of the Plasma Desktop's current success

18:26.920 --> 18:31.040
and the reason why it appeals to me is because a lot of the work the visual design group

18:31.040 --> 18:37.120
has done, and I think it is an important part of the project.

18:37.120 --> 18:40.800
You know, perhaps it's just a changing of the guard, where there's a shift now where

18:40.800 --> 18:44.500
the visual design group has a little more sway, has a little more influence because

18:44.500 --> 18:49.060
of their success, but he may still have valid points that they still have to consult domain

18:49.060 --> 18:53.560
experts and make sure things are done correctly from a technical standpoint.

18:53.560 --> 18:56.640
Both parties are probably in the right in this particular case.

18:56.640 --> 18:58.900
Yeah, that's probably the case.

18:58.900 --> 19:04.320
But one thing that's great about the KDE project is their involvement with the community.

19:04.320 --> 19:08.500
And Plasma Mobile is one of the most exciting aspects of KDE.

19:08.500 --> 19:13.740
It's to me one of the best things that they're working on, but it has suffered a little bit

19:13.740 --> 19:18.360
from onboarding issues and getting people involved with it.

19:18.360 --> 19:25.080
And so now they have decided to try and make that process easier and have launched Find

19:25.080 --> 19:26.460
Your Own Way.

19:26.460 --> 19:29.360
This is actually a pretty good milestone to see the project getting to, where they've

19:29.360 --> 19:33.600
gotten to a point where they can look back at themselves and say, what are the barriers

19:33.600 --> 19:35.720
to people getting involved with our project?

19:35.720 --> 19:39.800
In their post, they talk about streamlining onboarding of new contributors, setting up

19:39.800 --> 19:43.200
three new goals, working with the KDE promo team and all of that.

19:43.200 --> 19:47.480
But the overarching goal here is more contributors to the project, getting more information about

19:47.480 --> 19:50.720
devices, and really just try to get the word out still.

19:50.720 --> 19:52.520
I think it's a great first step.

19:52.520 --> 19:56.320
And if you look at the website, it's so simply laid out.

19:56.320 --> 19:57.680
Do you want to help us with outreach?

19:57.680 --> 19:58.680
No.

19:58.680 --> 20:00.400
Is there anything else I can do?

20:00.400 --> 20:01.400
System development.

20:01.400 --> 20:02.400
Oh, yeah.

20:02.400 --> 20:03.400
Tell me more about it.

20:03.400 --> 20:09.620
And then it's broken down into further categories, and it's a really simple way to get people

20:09.620 --> 20:12.620
to the right place where they need to be on Fabricator.

20:12.620 --> 20:18.400
So I'm hoping that more developers and just contributors generally will be attracted by

20:18.400 --> 20:24.280
this because Plasma Mobile, for me, is one of the great hopes for mobile Linux.

20:24.280 --> 20:25.920
And I really want to see it succeed.

20:25.920 --> 20:30.320
And anything that is going to make that more of a reality, I think it's got to be a good

20:30.320 --> 20:31.320
thing.

20:31.320 --> 20:33.700
And we round out the show this week with a story about Dev1.

20:33.700 --> 20:39.720
They have a brand new release, ASCII 2.0, which I was so excited to try out for this

20:39.720 --> 20:40.720
here show.

20:40.720 --> 20:46.000
I loaded over a MiFi and set it up in a VM while my laptop was on battery just so I could

20:46.000 --> 20:47.520
kick the tires, Joe.

20:47.520 --> 20:48.520
Wow.

20:48.520 --> 20:49.720
That's commitment.

20:49.720 --> 20:55.640
I did not expect Dev1 to get to a 1.0 release, never mind a 2.0.

20:55.640 --> 20:59.820
So color me shocked, quite frankly.

20:59.820 --> 21:04.680
This of course is the fork of Debian that has no system D. There's a little bit of an

21:04.680 --> 21:06.320
asterisk there.

21:06.320 --> 21:13.280
There are some little bits of system D in it to some extent, but it is mostly system

21:13.280 --> 21:14.980
D free Debian.

21:14.980 --> 21:21.480
And it is pretty much just Debian Stretch, except with no system D in it.

21:21.480 --> 21:22.480
Right.

21:22.480 --> 21:23.480
Debian Stretch.

21:23.480 --> 21:24.480
Debian 9.

21:24.480 --> 21:31.160
In other words, the Debian that was released on June 17, 2017, almost exactly a year ago

21:31.160 --> 21:32.900
as we record this episode.

21:32.900 --> 21:35.720
And that's really kind of where the fun begins with this distribution.

21:35.720 --> 21:38.120
I really encourage you to give it a go.

21:38.120 --> 21:39.680
Go ahead and give it a download.

21:39.680 --> 21:43.320
I love my first experiences, you know, when you're in the live environment.

21:43.320 --> 21:45.800
And it's like, OK, this isn't too bad of an XFC experience.

21:45.800 --> 21:47.160
I kind of enjoy this.

21:47.160 --> 21:51.000
So I go and fire up the graphical, quote unquote, installer.

21:51.000 --> 21:53.080
And I'm immediately hit with a question.

21:53.080 --> 21:55.280
Would you like to use SU or sudo?

21:55.280 --> 21:59.060
Note, this does not affect how you administer your system.

21:59.060 --> 22:00.240
And that's all I get.

22:00.240 --> 22:02.960
I don't know if I would want to use sudo or SU.

22:02.960 --> 22:06.880
So thinking I like root all the time, I hit SU naturally.

22:06.880 --> 22:13.840
Then it prompts me for the root password, which is accessible in a text document that

22:13.840 --> 22:17.360
you double click on the desktop that opens it up in a terminal text editor.

22:17.360 --> 22:20.600
So you can read the username and password once you read the manual.

22:20.600 --> 22:23.580
Now it's a typical tour password, so not too surprising there.

22:23.580 --> 22:26.840
So once I type in my password, it starts the installation.

22:26.840 --> 22:30.480
And then I check the boxes of things I want, like do I want a home partition?

22:30.480 --> 22:32.680
Do I want to use encryption, stuff like that.

22:32.680 --> 22:34.320
And then it says, OK, choose your partitioner.

22:34.320 --> 22:35.600
Would you like to use gparted?

22:35.600 --> 22:37.080
How about fdisk?

22:37.080 --> 22:39.140
And you then proceed to set up your disks.

22:39.140 --> 22:40.140
And it's just a great time.

22:40.140 --> 22:41.820
I encourage any of you to give it a go.

22:41.820 --> 22:45.680
For extra bonus points, try setting it up on a high DPI monitor.

22:45.680 --> 22:46.680
That's extra fun.

22:46.680 --> 22:49.520
Do I detect a hint of sarcasm in your voice here?

22:49.520 --> 22:53.400
It was enjoyable from the standpoint of like when I went to the Computer History Museum

22:53.400 --> 22:56.600
and I got to see a whole bunch of old systems and see them operating.

22:56.600 --> 22:58.900
And it was enjoyable from that standpoint.

22:58.900 --> 23:03.040
It was comical from a standpoint of somebody who wants to sit down and get their machine

23:03.040 --> 23:04.640
going and get working immediately.

23:04.640 --> 23:09.360
I'm clearly not their demographic, but I could see somebody who wouldn't mind going through

23:09.360 --> 23:10.360
that.

23:10.360 --> 23:11.360
It was sort of fun in a way.

23:11.360 --> 23:15.380
Well, I had a go at that live image that has the installer in it, and it just didn't work.

23:15.380 --> 23:19.060
It went through it all and then just wouldn't boot from that partition.

23:19.060 --> 23:25.680
So then I downloaded the installer image, and that was just Debian, as far as I'm concerned,

23:25.680 --> 23:30.960
a rebranded Debian with no system day, of course.

23:30.960 --> 23:35.000
And it's got XFC by default, which I love.

23:35.000 --> 23:40.020
So I could actually use it once you get the installer image rather than the live one.

23:40.020 --> 23:42.960
I installed it today on hardware.

23:42.960 --> 23:47.960
I could easily continue setting that up and tweak it just the way I want it, and I'd be

23:47.960 --> 23:48.960
happy to use it.

23:48.960 --> 23:54.020
I wouldn't even notice the difference really between that and a regular Debian.

23:54.020 --> 23:55.720
Of course, there's no GNOME available for it.

23:55.720 --> 23:59.200
There's various other desktops, including Mate, which I tried out, and that was all

23:59.200 --> 24:00.200
fine.

24:00.200 --> 24:03.320
But GNOME has got the dependency on system day, hasn't it?

24:03.320 --> 24:10.040
So yeah, I don't think this is aimed at the mainstream Linux audience, is it?

24:10.040 --> 24:11.040
No, no.

24:11.040 --> 24:12.320
But the name is great, ASCII.

24:12.320 --> 24:13.320
That's fun.

24:13.320 --> 24:17.440
And there was one thing I did not get a chance to play with before the show is they have

24:17.440 --> 24:23.720
options for, quote, console productivity with hundreds of CLI and text utilities.

24:23.720 --> 24:25.040
I would love to know more about that.

24:25.040 --> 24:26.320
I did not get a chance to play with that.

24:26.320 --> 24:29.480
And the other thing that I thought was just sort of neat is since they're ripping out

24:29.480 --> 24:32.720
system D, you get to pick what init system you want to use.

24:32.720 --> 24:38.320
So you get to pick different init systems with dev1 and version 2.0 ASCII.

24:38.320 --> 24:43.520
I know they're trying to make a practical old style Unix admins distro, but it's turning

24:43.520 --> 24:48.480
out to be like a fun experiment in how like an alternative reality version of Linux could

24:48.480 --> 24:50.560
have gone in a parallel universe.

24:50.560 --> 24:52.640
Well, it seems to have an audience.

24:52.640 --> 24:55.400
Otherwise it wouldn't have got to 2.0, would it?

24:55.400 --> 24:57.080
I expected it to wither and die.

24:57.080 --> 24:59.480
And it seems to be going relatively strong.

24:59.480 --> 25:05.840
OK, it's a little bit behind or a fair bit behind the Debian release schedule.

25:05.840 --> 25:08.720
But there must be people using this, man.

25:08.720 --> 25:14.880
It seems it's found a bit of a home with some embedded devices because I count five derivatives

25:14.880 --> 25:20.600
of the project now and a couple of them are for like microservice, small like network

25:20.600 --> 25:21.600
machines.

25:21.600 --> 25:24.520
And they've got official images for stuff like the pie as well.

25:24.520 --> 25:29.080
So it's being used by more people than you would imagine, I think.

25:29.080 --> 25:30.680
Well, I hope they enjoy themselves.

25:30.680 --> 25:31.680
More power to them.

25:31.680 --> 25:32.680
I had some good fun with it.

25:32.680 --> 25:37.680
I just want to say thank you to everybody who came out and said hi at Texas Linux Fest.

25:37.680 --> 25:40.100
Lots and lots of fans of the show there, Joe.

25:40.100 --> 25:41.280
Everybody talked about Linux Action News.

25:41.280 --> 25:42.280
So that was super cool.

25:42.280 --> 25:46.600
We got we had many great meetups, actually, who had several nights of great meetups.

25:46.600 --> 25:47.600
It was a ton of fun.

25:47.600 --> 25:49.480
And my journey now continues on.

25:49.480 --> 25:53.720
I'm heading up to Keller, Texas, to meet up with Linux Academy at their office.

25:53.720 --> 25:58.160
So you can continue to follow my journey at jupyterbroadcasting.com slash Rover.

25:58.160 --> 26:00.480
And this is my last show from Austin, Texas.

26:00.480 --> 26:04.200
Yeah, and I had a great time at Foss Talk Live last night.

26:04.200 --> 26:07.480
That's why I sound a little bit hungover today, I'm afraid.

26:07.480 --> 26:08.480
No, no.

26:08.480 --> 26:11.800
Yeah, I know, right.

26:11.800 --> 26:17.000
And met a ton of listeners there of, you know, the various shows that I do.

26:17.000 --> 26:18.760
So yeah, that was really cool.

26:18.760 --> 26:22.600
And check out fostalk.com for the various live shows that were recorded there.

26:22.600 --> 26:24.520
They'll eventually get posted there.

26:24.520 --> 26:29.440
