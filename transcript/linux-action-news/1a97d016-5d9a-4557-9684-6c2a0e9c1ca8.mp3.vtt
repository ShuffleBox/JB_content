Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, our weekly take on Linux and the open source world.

00:16.360 --> 00:20.600
This is episode 78, recorded on November 4th, 2018.

00:20.600 --> 00:21.600
I'm Chris.

00:21.600 --> 00:22.600
And I'm Joe.

00:22.600 --> 00:23.600
Hello, Joe.

00:23.600 --> 00:27.980
It's great to be connected with you, and we have a week of releases.

00:27.980 --> 00:32.760
People have been busy since their summer break, and we kick things off with the Fedora 29

00:32.760 --> 00:33.760
release.

00:33.760 --> 00:34.880
Yeah, this is a big release for them.

00:34.880 --> 00:38.800
And I think the biggest thing that jumps out at me here is the modularity that they've

00:38.800 --> 00:39.800
now got.

00:39.800 --> 00:40.960
This is really neat.

00:40.960 --> 00:44.140
This is something that Wes and I had a play with before Linux Unplugged.

00:44.140 --> 00:49.680
And the idea is you can ship different versions of packages on the same Fedora base.

00:49.680 --> 00:54.360
So this means that you no longer need to make your whole OS upgrade just to get, say, the

00:54.360 --> 00:55.840
latest Node.js.

00:55.840 --> 01:02.240
Or vice versa, when Fedora 30 comes around and you have to upgrade because of the 13-month

01:02.240 --> 01:07.520
roughly support cycle, you don't want to have to rebuild your whole application based on

01:07.520 --> 01:13.720
the new version of Node.js and Fedora 30 so you can install Fedora 30 base but use the

01:13.720 --> 01:18.240
modular version to install the Fedora 29 Node.js package.

01:18.240 --> 01:23.300
It's a little confusing, but it solves a longstanding problem on Linux that Flatpaks and Snaps have

01:23.300 --> 01:26.520
attempted to solve, but this is at the package level.

01:26.520 --> 01:30.840
And it also is very handy in a distribution which has a very rapid update cycle.

01:30.840 --> 01:35.320
Well, Snaps immediately come to mind when I read about this modularity.

01:35.320 --> 01:39.880
You say that they've been attempting to solve it, but it feels like a fairly solved problem

01:39.880 --> 01:40.880
to me with Snaps.

01:40.880 --> 01:45.080
And Snaps are available in Fedora, so why did they need to do it?

01:45.080 --> 01:48.240
It's a choose-your-flavor-to-solve-the-problem kind of thing.

01:48.240 --> 01:54.200
So Snaps and Flatpaks you could think of as really the developer is able to directly publish

01:54.200 --> 01:56.000
the software to the end user.

01:56.000 --> 02:01.560
That's a developer model of distributing software and it's pretty popular right now.

02:01.560 --> 02:07.360
Distributing packages via a repo is really a system administrator's way to distribute

02:07.360 --> 02:08.360
software.

02:08.360 --> 02:10.160
That's how sysadmins would invent a system.

02:10.160 --> 02:15.680
You can have local repositories with your own keys and all this stuff that's very much

02:15.680 --> 02:21.120
of a system administrator's way of managing software and only root can install those packages.

02:21.120 --> 02:27.080
Again, the system administrator and they are a very valid way of managing software, especially

02:27.080 --> 02:28.840
on production systems.

02:28.840 --> 02:35.300
And so this is solving that software availability issue across multiple releases from the repository

02:35.300 --> 02:37.220
and software management standpoint.

02:37.220 --> 02:43.480
Because you can install say that Fedora 28 version of Node.js on Fedora 29 and now it's

02:43.480 --> 02:46.960
getting updated with security fixes as part of your DNF upgrade.

02:46.960 --> 02:49.160
It's just all of your packages.

02:49.160 --> 02:53.640
It is included in that and so you can manage it as you would a standard piece of software

02:53.640 --> 02:56.040
on your Linux box from the repositories.

02:56.040 --> 03:00.760
Yeah, it means that you don't have to have a million block devices when you do LSBLK

03:00.760 --> 03:03.600
to try and see where you're going to DD your ISO.

03:03.600 --> 03:05.920
So it makes that a bit cleaner as well.

03:05.920 --> 03:10.300
I suppose you're right that it is more of a sysadmin way of doing things and it's more

03:10.300 --> 03:11.640
traditional isn't it?

03:11.640 --> 03:15.560
It's a new take on the traditional way rather than completely reinventing the wheel like

03:15.560 --> 03:17.700
they have with Snaps and Flatpak.

03:17.700 --> 03:20.540
So I suppose I should be more on board with this really.

03:20.540 --> 03:25.040
It's an impressive bit of engineering too because it required some work at the DNF level,

03:25.040 --> 03:29.920
it required some work at the repository level and even required some work in like the namespace

03:29.920 --> 03:30.920
area.

03:30.920 --> 03:33.400
So it's been sort of a cross project effort.

03:33.400 --> 03:36.480
I don't know, that's always kind of impressive to see when a distribution pulls that off

03:36.480 --> 03:39.840
and now it's just one of the features in the new release.

03:39.840 --> 03:44.200
And of course the desktop version has got GNOME 3.30 and various other new packages

03:44.200 --> 03:45.200
across the board.

03:45.200 --> 03:48.560
Right, and they also have their different images for the different spins of Fedora now.

03:48.560 --> 03:55.440
I have Fedora Cloud up on a DigitalOcean droplet and did the upgrade from 28 to 29 and my next

03:55.440 --> 04:00.520
cloud instance continued perfectly fine and now we're even using that for more things.

04:00.520 --> 04:05.640
It's been a solid system and I went in via cockpit, I installed all of the available

04:05.640 --> 04:11.160
updates then SSHed into the box and there's some basic DNF commands that Fedora always

04:11.160 --> 04:15.440
does a great job of documenting where you go through, you grab the new package plug-in

04:15.440 --> 04:19.040
to do an upgrade, then you tell it what version you're upgrading to and it goes.

04:19.040 --> 04:22.600
And then it does a system D reboot and installs all the packages and when it comes back up

04:22.600 --> 04:24.680
you're on the new version of Fedora.

04:24.680 --> 04:29.800
And for four or five times in a row I have successfully upgraded from one version of

04:29.800 --> 04:32.160
Fedora Cloud to the next version of Fedora Cloud.

04:32.160 --> 04:37.000
Yeah, well with the support cycle as short as Fedora they really have to get those upgrades

04:37.000 --> 04:38.240
bulletproofed, don't they?

04:38.240 --> 04:41.680
Right, that was always my thinking, that's why I even set up this test box to begin with

04:41.680 --> 04:46.720
to see how far I could push it and so far they've nailed it.

04:46.720 --> 04:52.400
Also this week Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.6 has landed, this is a bit of business as usual

04:52.400 --> 04:54.720
from the Red Hat camp after the recent big news.

04:54.720 --> 04:57.320
Yeah, it's not a hugely interesting release, is it?

04:57.320 --> 05:03.920
It's as you say, business as usual, it's very much enterprise and cloud and hybrid cloud,

05:03.920 --> 05:07.800
exactly the sort of stuff we saw in the IBM announcement.

05:07.800 --> 05:13.320
We are living in the Red Hat hybrid cloud era, the words hybrid cloud show up in this

05:13.320 --> 05:20.060
press release 12 times, they just really want to talk about this and I guess if you really

05:20.060 --> 05:25.520
start defining down a category, hybrid cloud to them is sort of this bridging that they

05:25.520 --> 05:30.000
think is going to be the next 80% of cloud adoption.

05:30.000 --> 05:35.320
Maybe it will be, IBM thinks it's a trillion dollar market that we'll see, we'll see if

05:35.320 --> 05:43.480
this plays out and Red Hat Enterprise version 7.6 lands with the world leading support for

05:43.480 --> 05:47.200
hybrid cloud.

05:47.200 --> 05:51.520
Well it kind of does make sense hybrid cloud though if you take it to mean a bit of on-premises

05:51.520 --> 05:55.880
and a bit of public cloud, that's kind of quite a logical approach, isn't it, rather

05:55.880 --> 05:57.840
than sticking all your eggs in one basket?

05:57.840 --> 06:02.520
I agree, yeah, I think it's funny how these words kind of just take off, we can't just

06:02.520 --> 06:07.200
have a cloud and we can't just have a data center, can't call it hosted computing, no

06:07.200 --> 06:11.680
now it has to be hybrid cloud and you're right, when you look it up, the definition is exactly

06:11.680 --> 06:17.160
that, a mix of on-premises, private cloud and third party public cloud services and

06:17.160 --> 06:21.880
that's why orchestration software is such a big deal these days and that's why when

06:21.880 --> 06:26.080
shops like Digital Ocean announced Kubernetes support, it's a really big deal because you

06:26.080 --> 06:31.360
can use one set of tools to manage your systems that are right there on your LAN or off in

06:31.360 --> 06:36.660
some other country or state on a third party hosting platform, all one tool, all one set

06:36.660 --> 06:42.560
of commands, all one set of user structures, it's pretty powerful stuff and Red Hat's pretty

06:42.560 --> 06:49.360
well positioned here because they are a dominant player in the on-premises Linux server environment

06:49.360 --> 06:53.480
so it makes sense that they would be a pretty good partner in this area, it's just really

06:53.480 --> 06:54.480
in your face.

06:54.480 --> 06:58.840
Yeah, I think you mean IBM slash Red Hat as well, we've covered this.

06:58.840 --> 07:05.160
Yeah, yeah, and to sort of try to make some hay from all of this hoopla around IBM and

07:05.160 --> 07:07.560
Red Hat, the register had a bit of fun.

07:07.560 --> 07:13.000
Yeah, they engage in what can only really be described as clickbait, the headline was

07:13.000 --> 07:18.240
we may now know the real reason for that IBM takeover, a distraction for Red Hat to axe

07:18.240 --> 07:26.680
KDE and it's like, okay, so they're going to deprecate KDE and by 2024, it's not going

07:26.680 --> 07:27.680
to be in RHEL.

07:27.680 --> 07:32.880
Well, I mean, it's never been massively well supported anyway and they're really gnome

07:32.880 --> 07:41.520
focused so this is just not really good from the registers, it's really just them trying

07:41.520 --> 07:45.240
to grab clicks and you'd expect better from them really.

07:45.240 --> 07:50.800
Way to make a great impression on IBM when you know IBM and Red Hat are carefully watching

07:50.800 --> 07:56.960
the press coverage right now and apparently Steve Elmy from Red Hat did an interview with

07:56.960 --> 08:00.920
the registers, I wonder if he's going to be getting an email and he's quoted here saying,

08:00.920 --> 08:06.080
based on trends in the Red Hat enterprise Linux customer base, there is an overwhelming

08:06.080 --> 08:10.960
interest in desktop technologies such as Gnome and Wayland.

08:10.960 --> 08:20.140
While interest in KDE has been waning in our installed base, you wonder if maybe that's

08:20.140 --> 08:25.520
because they've been holding back their version of plasma and they've been pushing GTK, Gnome

08:25.520 --> 08:27.640
and Wayland very heavily.

08:27.640 --> 08:32.160
Maybe that's why the installed base seems to be more interested in Gnome.

08:32.160 --> 08:37.640
Yeah, I remember last time I tried CentOS on the desktop, I installed plasma or KDE,

08:37.640 --> 08:41.360
whatever, expected it to be plasma 5 and then it was KDE 4.

08:41.360 --> 08:42.360
Yeah.

08:42.360 --> 08:43.360
I was like, what?

08:43.360 --> 08:44.360
Nobody wants that.

08:44.360 --> 08:45.920
Did you see Jonathan Riddle's take on this?

08:45.920 --> 08:54.520
Yeah, it was quite concise and typically Jonathan just saying like, yeah, it's not really a

08:54.520 --> 08:55.520
big deal, is it?

08:55.520 --> 08:56.520
It's not news, he says.

08:56.520 --> 08:58.640
It's just kind of poor timing for Red Hat though.

08:58.640 --> 08:59.640
Yeah.

08:59.640 --> 09:04.080
He says, it's a pity that rel users won't be there to enjoy it by default, but there

09:04.080 --> 09:09.160
really never has been a great KDE experience in rel, so nothing's really changing here

09:09.160 --> 09:13.080
and it just leaves it up into the community to ship plasma 5, which is way better and

09:13.080 --> 09:14.080
way more modern.

09:14.080 --> 09:15.080
Yeah.

09:15.080 --> 09:20.840
But it's funny that now you've got your main three enterprise desktop Linux distros, rel,

09:20.840 --> 09:27.960
sle from SUSE and Ubuntu, all running GNOME with no KDE.

09:27.960 --> 09:34.280
I mean, I suppose with Ubuntu it's a bit easier to get plasma 5 going, but KDE and plasma

09:34.280 --> 09:39.880
is not in SUSE enterprise Linux at all and now it's not going to be in Red Hat, which

09:39.880 --> 09:42.280
is kind of going against the hype, isn't it?

09:42.280 --> 09:49.320
Like we have this idea that plasma is really popular, but the reality is that in enterprise,

09:49.320 --> 09:50.320
apparently not.

09:50.320 --> 09:53.960
You know, I've thought a little bit about this because of all the desktops, plasma really

09:53.960 --> 09:57.280
feels like a professional grade workstation.

09:57.280 --> 10:02.000
It's multi-threaded, it has multiple processes, so if something goes haywire, you don't lose

10:02.000 --> 10:03.380
your whole desktop.

10:03.380 --> 10:07.560
It's got features that make it really great on an enterprise network and it plugs in with

10:07.560 --> 10:10.720
collaboration software suites that most businesses use.

10:10.720 --> 10:16.040
So it's always really seemed to me like a really great workstation choice for the enterprise.

10:16.040 --> 10:19.520
And I have to wonder if it's not just historical momentum here.

10:19.520 --> 10:23.680
Gnome has traditionally always been pretty popular on the Red Hat side of things and

10:23.680 --> 10:28.320
Red Hat was sort of the originator of the enterprise grade Linux desktop, even if later

10:28.320 --> 10:29.860
on they waned from it.

10:29.860 --> 10:35.520
You have also sort of the weight and momentum of that carrying now through to other desktops

10:35.520 --> 10:39.960
when they try to make their enterprise grade desktop their shipping gnome because that's

10:39.960 --> 10:41.500
what Red Hat shipped.

10:41.500 --> 10:45.240
That sort of momentum that can be started when one major player in the industry starts

10:45.240 --> 10:51.480
a trend, I think is a bit of what it tributes to gnome success in these enterprise grade

10:51.480 --> 10:52.480
desktops.

10:52.480 --> 10:56.680
What we don't really hear is how these users are getting along with it, how stable it is

10:56.680 --> 10:57.680
for them.

10:57.680 --> 11:00.560
We don't really hear that kind of feedback from the general enterprise market.

11:00.560 --> 11:06.520
And of course you have to remember that pre-Plasma 5, it wasn't that good, was it?

11:06.520 --> 11:12.280
And Plasma 5 has only been around for, in enterprise terms, a blink of the eye because

11:12.280 --> 11:14.400
enterprise moves very slowly, doesn't it?

11:14.400 --> 11:19.240
So maybe eventually they'll catch on that it's good.

11:19.240 --> 11:24.680
I mean, I don't think there's much debate, is there, that 5 is way better than 4?

11:24.680 --> 11:25.680
That's my thinking.

11:25.680 --> 11:28.800
Yeah, 5 is pretty solid and just keeps getting better and better.

11:28.800 --> 11:33.160
And they've instituted that long-term support cycle, which you keep doing that, you stick

11:33.160 --> 11:34.400
with it.

11:34.400 --> 11:39.200
You may see a few enterprise distributions switch to it over time, maybe, maybe not.

11:39.200 --> 11:43.600
But in the meantime, Sailfish is hoping to get some enterprise phones to switch over.

11:43.600 --> 11:46.960
The new Sailfish 3 release is really going after the business customer.

11:46.960 --> 11:50.480
Yeah, it seems that they've realized that that's where the money is.

11:50.480 --> 11:55.640
They've kind of been going after enterprise and government installations for quite a while,

11:55.640 --> 11:59.600
but now they're really doubling down on that with this Sailfish 3 release.

11:59.600 --> 12:04.120
But that said, they are keeping the community stuff around as well with the Sailfish X program,

12:04.120 --> 12:06.160
which they're expanding to a few new phones.

12:06.160 --> 12:07.160
Yeah, fair enough.

12:07.160 --> 12:08.720
Sailfish X is living on.

12:08.720 --> 12:14.080
So I would say just what jumped out at me was sort of the verbiage in their version

12:14.080 --> 12:15.080
3 announcement.

12:15.080 --> 12:16.440
I thought this is interesting.

12:16.440 --> 12:23.760
They say, Sailfish OS has matured to its third generation, Sailfish 3, which now fully packetizes

12:23.760 --> 12:27.480
the offering for a multitude of corporate solutions.

12:27.480 --> 12:32.560
In line with the regional licensing strategy, Sailfish 3 has a deeper level of security,

12:32.560 --> 12:39.000
making it a solid option for various corporate and organizational solutions and other use cases.

12:39.000 --> 12:40.000
Okay, then.

12:40.000 --> 12:43.240
It's almost like a Red Hat press release, isn't it?

12:43.240 --> 12:44.240
It is.

12:44.240 --> 12:48.520
It's like when you start targeting business, you just have to just pack as many words in

12:48.520 --> 12:49.520
there as you can.

12:49.520 --> 12:52.640
And that's somehow writing for business.

12:52.640 --> 12:56.560
Yeah, well, management like that sort of thing, obviously.

12:56.560 --> 12:59.560
There are a few nice new features in here for users, though.

12:59.560 --> 13:02.160
They've got that quick settings up in the new top menu.

13:02.160 --> 13:07.280
Security encryption for memory cards is now available, a new keyboard that supports gestures,

13:07.280 --> 13:10.320
and this one sounds good too, USB on-the-go storage.

13:10.320 --> 13:16.160
You can connect different kinds of external storage devices to your Sailfish 3 phone or

13:16.160 --> 13:20.200
tablet or I guess whatever you're running on there, and then some camera improvements,

13:20.200 --> 13:24.400
mostly just around how it operates with the lock screen and the camera roll, but good

13:24.400 --> 13:26.560
stuff in there overall for end users as well.

13:26.560 --> 13:31.720
Now unfortunately, I don't have a device that is compatible with Sailfish 3, but I'm tempted.

13:31.720 --> 13:35.880
I'm very tempted because it looks very slick, doesn't it, from these screenshots.

13:35.880 --> 13:39.320
And I used an earlier version of Sailfish and thought that was pretty well polished.

13:39.320 --> 13:44.400
I thought it was probably one of the best alternative phone OSs I've ever used.

13:44.400 --> 13:49.400
So you kind of figure if they've been working on it for a while, you get the Sailfish X

13:49.400 --> 13:52.760
phone, like the Xperia XA2, you could run it on there.

13:52.760 --> 13:53.760
Yeah, I was looking on eBay.

13:53.760 --> 13:59.720
It was just slightly too much to kind of sell to my missus that I would spend that much

13:59.720 --> 14:02.360
on just something to check out Sailfish.

14:02.360 --> 14:06.580
But I've checked out two on my OnePlus One, but that was an unofficial ROM, so I don't

14:06.580 --> 14:11.000
know exactly whether that's a fair test of it.

14:11.000 --> 14:14.960
I would really like to get one of these Xperia devices, so I might have to convince her to

14:14.960 --> 14:15.960
let me.

14:15.960 --> 14:20.560
Yeah, may the negotiations go well for you, Joe, because I'd like to hear your take on

14:20.560 --> 14:21.560
it as well.

14:21.560 --> 14:29.640
I tried to give another new release this week a go, GhostBSD 18.10, which is the first release

14:29.640 --> 14:34.680
of GhostBSD based around true OS under the hood.

14:34.680 --> 14:38.020
And it's also got the Monte desktop for the end user.

14:38.020 --> 14:39.680
You say tried to test this.

14:39.680 --> 14:40.880
It didn't work out then.

14:40.880 --> 14:45.400
Yeah, I used Vert Manager to just basically do some local virtualization, and I could

14:45.400 --> 14:48.440
never get the desktop session to actually load.

14:48.440 --> 14:51.440
I got all these crazy weird green bars across my screen.

14:51.440 --> 14:53.640
I was surprised at how large it was, too.

14:53.640 --> 14:57.280
It was like a 2.6 something gigabyte download.

14:57.280 --> 14:58.280
Pretty big ISO.

14:58.280 --> 15:00.000
Pretty, pretty large for the BSDs.

15:00.000 --> 15:06.000
Yeah, well, I decided to try this out on my old test laptop, which is just Intel graphics.

15:06.000 --> 15:09.520
Works pretty well with Triscol, so you know that it's going to have a pretty reasonable

15:09.520 --> 15:10.520
chance.

15:10.520 --> 15:17.780
And it worked perfectly, GhostBSD 18.10, booted up no problem, installed no problem, installed

15:17.780 --> 15:21.120
some software, did a bit of media playback.

15:21.120 --> 15:23.960
It was just a perfectly functional operating system.

15:23.960 --> 15:26.960
And that's always been my experience of GhostBSD.

15:26.960 --> 15:33.480
Even before it was based on TrueOS, for me, if you are BSD curious like I am, I know very

15:33.480 --> 15:34.480
little about BSD.

15:34.480 --> 15:37.640
I've never run it on any servers or anything.

15:37.640 --> 15:42.560
I think GhostBSD is definitely the place to start, because I think when you're first getting

15:42.560 --> 15:48.800
into something like Linux, for example, having a really nice desktop makes it easier.

15:48.800 --> 15:52.120
It's kind of almost like a life preserver, isn't it?

15:52.120 --> 15:59.000
It's like you've got that safety blanket of a desktop, and then you can go tinkering with

15:59.000 --> 16:03.600
more of the command line stuff, and the package management, and all of that.

16:03.600 --> 16:09.240
And if you're just starting from scratch with, say, FreeBSD, and you've got no GUI there,

16:09.240 --> 16:14.600
it can be a little bit daunting, whereas having a really easy GUI installer, and if you've

16:14.600 --> 16:21.600
got an old laptop that you can chuck it on, I would highly recommend this GhostBSD 18.10.

16:21.600 --> 16:24.440
Install it, and get your feet wet with a bit of BSD.

16:24.440 --> 16:28.760
Now I know that you got your feet very wet at MeetBSD in California.

16:28.760 --> 16:31.000
Did GhostBSD come up at all there?

16:31.000 --> 16:35.200
There's definitely a few people there that use GhostBSD on their desktops.

16:35.200 --> 16:41.320
I heard a lot more, though, about TrueOS, which is an effort from a few IX Systems folks,

16:41.320 --> 16:48.080
including Chris Moore, to create a base BSD in which products and other BSDs can be based

16:48.080 --> 16:56.560
off of FreeNAS, TrueNAS, but also desktop BSDs, like the Trident desktop distribution,

16:56.560 --> 16:58.320
and now GhostBSD.

16:58.320 --> 17:02.640
So this is really neat, because instead of having all these crazy different bases, you've

17:02.640 --> 17:08.600
got one base that has an easily programatical way to create a derivative.

17:08.600 --> 17:12.800
And they're kind of calling them even distributions, in a sense, and this looks like a good one.

17:12.800 --> 17:20.040
You've swapped out the default SSL system and went with LibreSSL, and you also get advantage

17:20.040 --> 17:25.200
of the standard package tools in BSD, which are really easy to work with.

17:25.200 --> 17:26.960
It's using ZFS by default.

17:26.960 --> 17:30.100
It's got Network Manager to manage the network connections.

17:30.100 --> 17:35.480
This thing's got the latest Intel drivers and the NVIDIA 390 driver.

17:35.480 --> 17:39.080
This is a pretty great-looking BSD distribution, so yeah, I was a little disappointed I couldn't

17:39.080 --> 17:41.120
get it to go.

17:41.120 --> 17:45.740
If you were going to say upgrade, it would just be a package update, package upgrade

17:45.740 --> 17:46.740
type command.

17:46.740 --> 17:51.280
I mean, this is easy stuff even for Linux users that have never really tried BSD before

17:51.280 --> 17:53.400
to dive in and just give it a go.

17:53.400 --> 17:56.080
It's so easy, even us Linux users can figure it out, Joe.

17:56.080 --> 17:59.360
Yeah, even I managed to get it installed, so it must be all right.

17:59.360 --> 18:00.680
They would love to know that.

18:00.680 --> 18:04.640
It's a good-looking distribution, and I think that's why folks down there at MeetBSD ran

18:04.640 --> 18:08.520
it as a lot of them ran it as their desktop, although I will say there was more people

18:08.520 --> 18:13.920
at MeetBSD just using the command line as their desktop than an actual desktop.

18:13.920 --> 18:16.440
Why doesn't that surprise me?

18:16.440 --> 18:21.520
So we talked about EndlessOS a few months ago shipping on some Asus hardware, and it

18:21.520 --> 18:25.520
seems that it's shipping on some more hardware pretty soon.

18:25.520 --> 18:30.640
Yeah, this is the hack, hack-computer.com, and they pitch it as a way for kids to learn

18:30.640 --> 18:35.740
computers by giving them a fun, playful way to modify their environment, both with a graphical

18:35.740 --> 18:41.040
tool and then show them at a code level what's being changed, maybe CSS or operating code,

18:41.040 --> 18:44.320
whatever could be getting adjusted as they make settings changes in various applications

18:44.320 --> 18:47.720
and games with what they call playful narrative.

18:47.720 --> 18:52.700
And they say, parents, this is your opportunity to free up your computer and get a $300 computer

18:52.700 --> 18:57.560
for your kid that'll come loaded with coding software, learning apps, and 12 free months

18:57.560 --> 18:59.320
of content and updates.

18:59.320 --> 19:06.400
Well, again, this is an Asus machine, and it's a 14-inch full HD screen with four gigabytes

19:06.400 --> 19:07.400
of RAM.

19:07.400 --> 19:10.440
So that's not too bad for $300, is it?

19:10.440 --> 19:12.200
Depending on the build quality.

19:12.200 --> 19:17.200
Even if you put another Linux distro on there, that's not bad for a kind of entry-level laptop.

19:17.200 --> 19:20.280
But it goes to show that Endless is not dead.

19:20.280 --> 19:26.000
We talked about them laying off quite a few staff not too long ago, but this deal with

19:26.000 --> 19:32.200
Asus must be worth something to them, and if they sell a fair number of these, it might

19:32.200 --> 19:35.240
mean that they're kind of back in business.

19:35.240 --> 19:39.240
There's a content deal at play here too, because the hack computer comes with that subscription,

19:39.240 --> 19:45.760
and the idea is that as the kids' skill levels increase, every month there's new increasing

19:45.760 --> 19:48.660
challenges that download to the computer.

19:48.660 --> 19:52.520
Somebody has to be generating that, and I don't know, we don't know at this point, because

19:52.520 --> 19:53.520
this is early.

19:53.520 --> 19:58.360
I've contacted them to find out more information, and I've also signed up to be a beta participant

19:58.360 --> 20:01.280
in their program, so I can try to learn more.

20:01.280 --> 20:04.840
But right now, there are a couple of questions up in the air, like who's generating that

20:04.840 --> 20:05.840
content?

20:05.840 --> 20:06.840
Is it Endless?

20:06.840 --> 20:07.840
Is that an Asus initiative?

20:07.840 --> 20:11.680
At this point, we don't really have that information, but if you do, go to linuxactionnews.com slash

20:11.680 --> 20:13.280
contact and let us know.

20:13.280 --> 20:15.240
And if I find out more, I'll follow up.

20:15.240 --> 20:20.280
Well, the big hardware news this week was that System76 have got some new desktop machines,

20:20.280 --> 20:22.280
and they're looking pretty nice.

20:22.280 --> 20:30.880
You've got Thelio, Thelio Major, and Thelio Massive, which start at $1,000, $1,100-ish,

20:30.880 --> 20:36.240
and you could work your way up to $50,000, $60,000, maybe even $70,000 depending on how

20:36.240 --> 20:37.800
you configure one of these.

20:37.800 --> 20:45.820
My rig's somewhere between $3,000 and $5,600, depending on the drive and GPU configuration

20:45.820 --> 20:46.820
I go with.

20:46.820 --> 20:53.040
The other middle tier, Thelio Major, starts with either Threadripper or Core X CPUs, and

20:53.040 --> 21:01.160
it goes up to 128 gigs of RAM, and you can get up to nearly 46 terabytes of storage in

21:01.160 --> 21:02.160
this thing.

21:02.160 --> 21:07.120
And then they have a high-end one that goes up to 768 gigs of ECC RAM and 86 terabytes

21:07.120 --> 21:09.520
of storage.

21:09.520 --> 21:11.000
It's pretty intense.

21:11.000 --> 21:14.640
But I think maybe the other thing that is hard to really appreciate through an audio

21:14.640 --> 21:18.160
medium is the effort they've put into these custom case designs.

21:18.160 --> 21:23.840
They've got two types of wood that they've sandwiched in with a powdered metal, and it

21:23.840 --> 21:24.840
looks really sharp.

21:24.840 --> 21:26.400
They have maple or walnut.

21:26.400 --> 21:32.640
Walnut's sort of a classical, rich brown wood, and maple has sort of a high-contrast contemporary

21:32.640 --> 21:34.040
look to it.

21:34.040 --> 21:36.480
And Carl had a back-and-forth with me over email.

21:36.480 --> 21:38.320
He's very proud of this.

21:38.320 --> 21:41.320
And there's some good stuff in this machine aside from just the design, but they paid

21:41.320 --> 21:43.720
a lot of attention to the design.

21:43.720 --> 21:46.200
There's no bumps between metal and wood.

21:46.200 --> 21:49.280
It's seamless, and it looks really well done.

21:49.280 --> 21:53.560
Even the back end of this machine, they've put a solar system design on the fan grill.

21:53.560 --> 21:58.480
It's a lot of small attention to detail, including this cool daughterboard that they're breaking

21:58.480 --> 22:01.200
out some of the proprietary functionality into.

22:01.200 --> 22:03.080
That's a little bit controversial, though, isn't it?

22:03.080 --> 22:09.360
Because they'd kind of hype this up to be open and open hardware.

22:09.360 --> 22:14.720
And although this is certified by the Open Source Hardware Association, it is still just

22:14.720 --> 22:21.760
using your standard Intel or AMD hardware that needs all the blobs to run.

22:21.760 --> 22:25.960
And okay, the daughterboard does break some of that stuff out, and they've made that open

22:25.960 --> 22:26.960
hardware.

22:26.960 --> 22:28.240
But I think it has disappointed.

22:28.240 --> 22:29.240
Well, I know it has.

22:29.240 --> 22:33.520
I've seen the disappointment in some of the comments and discourse about this online.

22:33.520 --> 22:36.640
And I don't know, did they over-hype this?

22:36.640 --> 22:37.640
Maybe.

22:37.640 --> 22:38.640
Yeah.

22:38.640 --> 22:40.880
How could you deliver a fully open Intel system?

22:40.880 --> 22:43.400
The only way they were going to deliver that is maybe if it was a RISC-based system.

22:43.400 --> 22:46.400
And we don't even know for sure if that's true.

22:46.400 --> 22:51.320
I say this is a tricky line for them, because they have an intention here to continue to

22:51.320 --> 22:53.900
push this forward as much as possible.

22:53.900 --> 22:56.680
And they have open sourced a lot of the design.

22:56.680 --> 22:58.600
It's up on GitHub right now.

22:58.600 --> 23:04.960
But yeah, I think maybe it was people, when they hear open hardware, they think something

23:04.960 --> 23:07.200
a little different than what was delivered here.

23:07.200 --> 23:13.440
At the end of the day, it's still a very respectable, very high-performance, good-looking system

23:13.440 --> 23:16.200
that's more open than your average desktop PC.

23:16.200 --> 23:20.000
And there is some innovation in this daughterboard, but we just have to wait and see how far they

23:20.000 --> 23:21.000
push it forward.

23:21.000 --> 23:24.900
And they do look cool in 80s as well, which I like.

23:24.900 --> 23:26.740
As in they look like from the 1980s?

23:26.740 --> 23:31.480
They don't look like 80s computers, they look like 80s furniture to me, with that wood and

23:31.480 --> 23:32.480
metal combination.

23:32.480 --> 23:33.480
Yeah.

23:33.480 --> 23:36.200
But in a really cool, stylish way, not in a naff way.

23:36.200 --> 23:37.200
Right.

23:37.200 --> 23:40.640
No, they do look, I think, are some of the best looking desktops I've seen.

23:40.640 --> 23:46.520
Kind of makes me want to build a new system here, and play around with Threadripper too.

23:46.520 --> 23:48.080
Yeah, I wouldn't mind one of the cases.

23:48.080 --> 23:52.360
I don't think they're selling the cases separately, which I think they could probably sell quite

23:52.360 --> 23:53.360
a few of.

23:53.360 --> 23:54.360
Yeah, they could.

23:54.360 --> 23:57.080
They just want you to buy a computer with all the parts in it too.

23:57.080 --> 24:01.480
They said they will possibly have me out later this month to take a look at it in person,

24:01.480 --> 24:05.560
because right now it's just pre-orders, and that's where I'm on the fence.

24:05.560 --> 24:06.960
I do want to see it in person.

24:06.960 --> 24:07.960
I'd like to hear it too.

24:07.960 --> 24:09.960
That's a big thing for me.

24:09.960 --> 24:12.860
And I'd like to see the way it's designed on the inside a little more.

24:12.860 --> 24:15.440
That hasn't been something that there's a lot of pictures of.

24:15.440 --> 24:19.400
There's some good tea shots, but I'd like to see the inside of one of these things,

24:19.400 --> 24:23.240
see how it's put together, see how the cooling system works.

24:23.240 --> 24:26.920
It could be one of the better options for desktop Linux users.

24:26.920 --> 24:30.400
We just don't know quite yet, but for those that are willing to try it, the pre-orders

24:30.400 --> 24:31.400
are open.

24:31.400 --> 24:33.880
Yeah, well, when you're down there, you'll have to try and pick me up a case when no

24:33.880 --> 24:34.880
one's looking.

24:34.880 --> 24:36.600
I'll just sneak it into my bag.

24:36.600 --> 24:41.000
And if that happens, you'll find about it right here on the Linux Action News program.

24:41.000 --> 24:46.120
In fact, you can get all of the ways to get this show every single week at linuxactionnews.com

24:46.120 --> 24:50.840

And we'll be back next Monday with our weekly take on Linux and the open source news of

25:00.160 --> 25:01.160
the week.

25:01.160 --> 25:02.160
I'm at Chris Ellis.

25:02.160 --> 25:03.940
I'm at Joe Ressington.

25:03.940 --> 25:05.480
Thank you for joining us.

25:05.480 --> 25:06.480
See you next week.
