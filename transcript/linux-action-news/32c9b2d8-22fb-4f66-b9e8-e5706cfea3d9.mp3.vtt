Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, our weekly take on Linux and the open source world.

00:16.000 --> 00:20.400
This is episode 16, recorded on August 27th, 2017.

00:20.400 --> 00:21.400
I'm Chris.

00:21.400 --> 00:22.400
And I'm Joe.

00:22.400 --> 00:23.400
Hello, Joe.

00:23.400 --> 00:27.000
We have a lot to get to today, so let's jump right into it with some new hardware news

00:27.000 --> 00:30.200
from our friends over at the Ubuntu Budgie project.

00:30.200 --> 00:36.920
Yeah, they've teamed up with Nimbusoft, who are a UK based, well, Clevo reseller, let's

00:36.920 --> 00:38.200
face it.

00:38.200 --> 00:39.240
But let's move on from that.

00:39.240 --> 00:47.240
They're selling laptops and an all in one PC with Ubuntu Budgie preloaded, which is

00:47.240 --> 00:48.240
pretty good news.

00:48.240 --> 00:53.560
I hadn't even heard of Nimbusoft, so good on them for doing this deal and making us

00:53.560 --> 00:54.600
aware of them.

00:54.600 --> 00:55.680
I hadn't heard of them either.

00:55.680 --> 00:58.540
I was wondering, because they're UK based, if perhaps you had.

00:58.540 --> 01:02.960
They also ship Ubuntu Mate systems as well, stock Ubuntu systems.

01:02.960 --> 01:03.960
You mentioned the Clevo thing.

01:03.960 --> 01:06.860
I actually want to touch on it just for a second, because I think it does matter in

01:06.860 --> 01:07.860
this case.

01:07.860 --> 01:09.880
So you have an iMac like system.

01:09.880 --> 01:15.920
There's also a couple of laptops, a 14.1 inch widescreen laptop, as well as a 17.3 inch

01:15.920 --> 01:16.920
laptop.

01:16.920 --> 01:21.320
A nice thin one though, 25 millimeters is actually pretty amazing for a 17.3.

01:21.320 --> 01:26.000
You mentioned Clevo, and I think it's important simply because what it comes down to with

01:26.000 --> 01:29.960
these Clevo resellers is the implementation.

01:29.960 --> 01:34.840
How they do it, what research they do, the configuration of parts.

01:34.840 --> 01:38.080
And that's why I'd like to get the audience's feedback on Nimbusoft, if you guys have bought

01:38.080 --> 01:40.440
hardware from them, what your experience was.

01:40.440 --> 01:41.760
What do you think of the lineup though, Joe?

01:41.760 --> 01:45.360
This all in one type machine that looks pretty slick, which is getting more and more popular,

01:45.360 --> 01:46.840
especially in office places.

01:46.840 --> 01:47.840
And then these two laptops.

01:47.840 --> 01:51.400
Well, the two laptops have kind of got both bases covered.

01:51.400 --> 01:57.600
The huge 17.3 inch desktop replacement, and then the 14.1 inch one that's kind of more

01:57.600 --> 02:02.700
aimed at portability, but not the ultimate ultrabook portability.

02:02.700 --> 02:07.960
It's kind of still big enough to do your work on, but you can still put it in a bag.

02:07.960 --> 02:10.780
So I think it's a reasonable selection.

02:10.780 --> 02:18.200
And one of them, the big one's got the GTX 950M card in it, which is powerful, but it's

02:18.200 --> 02:20.980
not super, super powerful.

02:20.980 --> 02:22.840
It's kind of a good compromise.

02:22.840 --> 02:24.760
So yeah, all in all, I think it's a pretty good selection.

02:24.760 --> 02:27.840
It would be nice if they also had an ultrabook to go along with them.

02:27.840 --> 02:30.220
You mentioned the video cards, the GTX 950M.

02:30.220 --> 02:35.860
That's not so bad considering the price, 799 pounds, which is not bad, but none of these

02:35.860 --> 02:38.360
are overwhelmingly compelling to me.

02:38.360 --> 02:44.040
I would be more inclined to get an XPS 15 or an XPS 13.

02:44.040 --> 02:46.960
I do wish them luck, and I think this is great for the Ubuntu Budgie project.

02:46.960 --> 02:51.840
Okay, well let's move on to another small Linux hardware company, this time Purism.

02:51.840 --> 02:57.120
And this time instead of a laptop, we're talking about a phone, the Librem 5, which is not

02:57.120 --> 03:01.660
just going to be the same old Android phone with a few modifications.

03:01.660 --> 03:06.840
This is going to be a phone that runs completely Libre software.

03:06.840 --> 03:08.560
Well almost, but we'll get back to that.

03:08.560 --> 03:13.800
But it's going to run proper GNU slash Linux, and it's going to run their own pure OS.

03:13.800 --> 03:18.840
But it's also going to be able to run other GNU slash Linux distributions, the major ones

03:18.840 --> 03:20.320
like Ubuntu and Fedora.

03:20.320 --> 03:24.960
Yeah, there's some fire where there has been smoke for quite a while.

03:24.960 --> 03:26.800
And they've launched a fundraiser.

03:26.800 --> 03:31.320
They have quite a big goal of $1.5 million.

03:31.320 --> 03:36.680
They've raised 6.43% as we record right now, about 96,000 US greenbacks.

03:36.680 --> 03:44.400
This is also what they say, the world's first IP native mobile handset using end to end

03:44.400 --> 03:50.800
encrypted decentralized communication, which impressively appears to be powered by the

03:50.800 --> 03:53.520
open source Matrix project.

03:53.520 --> 03:58.120
Which is absolutely brilliant, as long as the people you want to speak to also use Matrix.

03:58.120 --> 04:02.960
This is something I could get behind for just even communicating with team members or family

04:02.960 --> 04:03.960
members.

04:03.960 --> 04:09.720
Matrix is way more than Slack, so I do it a disservice by even comparing it.

04:09.720 --> 04:11.840
But you get base functionality from there.

04:11.840 --> 04:15.560
But Matrix is like a connection matrix.

04:15.560 --> 04:16.560
Oh, look at that.

04:16.560 --> 04:21.580
It can connect everything from text to video, audio, files.

04:21.580 --> 04:23.080
It's a protocol too.

04:23.080 --> 04:26.240
And so it's brilliant to build it into a phone.

04:26.240 --> 04:29.740
And I honestly am surprised they're the first to do this.

04:29.740 --> 04:34.280
And it appears to be legitimate cooperation with the Matrix project who seem to be very

04:34.280 --> 04:36.780
excited about the possibilities here.

04:36.780 --> 04:42.280
And for how much I use the phone, this kind of thing would actually be perfect for me.

04:42.280 --> 04:47.700
And the idea that my phone calls would be safe, secure, and powered by this awesome

04:47.700 --> 04:54.580
open source project running on a free platform, I'm liking these things about it quite a bit.

04:54.580 --> 04:55.960
I was a bit worried at first.

04:55.960 --> 04:58.780
I thought that was going to be the only way to make phone calls on it.

04:58.780 --> 05:03.920
But it is going to have a standard 3G, 4G, LTE, that kind of thing.

05:03.920 --> 05:05.280
So you can make standard phone calls.

05:05.280 --> 05:07.640
You can use standard data on it.

05:07.640 --> 05:12.920
And they're going to separate that system on a chip from the CPU, which seems like a

05:12.920 --> 05:14.360
lofty ambition to me.

05:14.360 --> 05:16.760
But well, what do I know?

05:16.760 --> 05:20.380
And if they do that, it means that you can just disable that stuff completely if you

05:20.380 --> 05:25.480
just want to use it as a tablet effectively, a tablet that uses Matrix and Wi-Fi or whatever.

05:25.480 --> 05:29.280
So it is basically what we've been dreaming of.

05:29.280 --> 05:32.800
And also, just casual mention, it's also a convergence device.

05:32.800 --> 05:33.800
Yeah.

05:33.800 --> 05:38.000
Well, in fact, the Matrix folks says, well, you can plug in a keyboard and mouse and screen.

05:38.000 --> 05:39.240
So why not?

05:39.240 --> 05:40.400
It's got Debian on there.

05:40.400 --> 05:41.440
Why not?

05:41.440 --> 05:49.120
And in their traditional now purism trademark move, they've included hardware kill switches

05:49.120 --> 05:53.500
for camera, microphone, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and the baseband.

05:53.500 --> 05:59.760
That might look kind of tacky depending on how it's implemented, but is really appealing.

05:59.760 --> 06:05.480
Not even from like a worried about being spied on perspective, but just from a battery saving

06:05.480 --> 06:06.480
perspective.

06:06.480 --> 06:08.400
Just switch off the baseband.

06:08.400 --> 06:09.800
Switch off the Bluetooth.

06:09.800 --> 06:10.800
That's really nice.

06:10.800 --> 06:16.240
Yeah, it sounds like a very hackable little device, but it's funny that they talk about,

06:16.240 --> 06:22.400
well, what happens if we don't make our goal of $1.5 million?

06:22.400 --> 06:27.360
They're very passive aggressive, the way they say, oh, well, there's obviously not a need

06:27.360 --> 06:31.520
for a private phone that respects people's freedoms and stuff like that.

06:31.520 --> 06:35.360
And so they're kind of really banking on making this $1.5 million.

06:35.360 --> 06:37.920
And I don't know, is there that much interest in this?

06:37.920 --> 06:43.200
It's only been a few days and they've already raised nearly $100,000, but I don't know.

06:43.200 --> 06:45.720
It seems like lofty goal to me.

06:45.720 --> 06:52.760
$1.5 seems really lofty, but it also seems like a more legitimate price of what it would

06:52.760 --> 06:54.040
actually cost.

06:54.040 --> 06:57.320
Maybe it seems like it would even cost more than that.

06:57.320 --> 07:03.100
And the buy-in levels are rather high too, if you want anything of substance.

07:03.100 --> 07:05.640
So this is the part I'm concerned about.

07:05.640 --> 07:10.680
I'll tell you, Joe, why I would be inclined to back it if I could afford it would be the

07:10.680 --> 07:14.020
same reason I originally backed the Librem.

07:14.020 --> 07:21.920
Since backing the Librem, I still believe in a laptop that is custom-built by an OEM

07:21.920 --> 07:24.280
designed for Linux with these kill switches.

07:24.280 --> 07:30.200
I think it's just a very nice concept, and I'd love to see a company successful at it.

07:30.200 --> 07:33.020
I have that same desire for a mobile device.

07:33.020 --> 07:38.120
I'd love to have a mobile device that's essentially the PC of phones, that I can load whatever

07:38.120 --> 07:43.240
OS I want, just like I can take my x86 PC and load whatever OS I want.

07:43.240 --> 07:46.840
But nothing checks that box right now for me.

07:46.840 --> 07:52.240
But $600 for a five-inch phone that's got no official specs yet, because they're like,

07:52.240 --> 07:54.480
ah, we'll work out the specs later.

07:54.480 --> 07:55.480
Just give us your money now.

07:55.480 --> 07:56.480
I don't know.

07:56.480 --> 07:58.800
It's a big risk as a backer.

07:58.800 --> 08:00.800
It is.

08:00.800 --> 08:01.800
I'll give them this.

08:01.800 --> 08:05.440
They've made progress since their initial fundraisers.

08:05.440 --> 08:10.280
They've worked on getting their laptops to be as binary blob-free as possible.

08:10.280 --> 08:14.720
They've made a lot of progress on reverse engineering Intel technologies to facilitate

08:14.720 --> 08:15.720
that.

08:15.720 --> 08:19.640
And if they say that they'll do the same for the baseband stuff, I have a tendency to believe

08:19.640 --> 08:23.600
them, because legitimately, they have assigned dedicated resource to reverse engineering

08:23.600 --> 08:27.280
this stuff for the laptops and made steady progress.

08:27.280 --> 08:28.580
You got to give them credit for that.

08:28.580 --> 08:33.380
And I would like to see that if a company came along and did something like this, that

08:33.380 --> 08:35.760
they'd also be working on that same thing.

08:35.760 --> 08:41.880
And well, Purism seems to have shown they'll be willing to do that if the product is successful.

08:41.880 --> 08:42.960
We'll see, though.

08:42.960 --> 08:46.440
It's a big risk.

08:46.440 --> 08:50.440
I wonder how much of a stake they have in this.

08:50.440 --> 08:56.200
The tone of the fundraiser here leads me to suspect that if this doesn't go well for them,

08:56.200 --> 09:00.320
we could be looking at them having to make some tough decisions post-fundraiser.

09:00.320 --> 09:04.720
That's what I take from the tone of the fundraiser here, which is sort of concerning, because

09:04.720 --> 09:08.400
that means one less company working towards this goal.

09:08.400 --> 09:09.400
Yeah.

09:09.400 --> 09:12.280
Well, I've been very cynical about them in the past, but I do wish them the best.

09:12.280 --> 09:13.640
I hope they make it.

09:13.640 --> 09:17.520
I'm not going to back it, but I really do hope they make it, and I hope that it proves

09:17.520 --> 09:21.680
that there is a need for a proper Linux phone.

09:21.680 --> 09:26.680
But in the meantime, let's talk about another Linux operating system for phones, and that

09:26.680 --> 09:28.160
is Sailfish.

09:28.160 --> 09:36.200
So Yola have had all sorts of problems financially, and their latest scheme, shall we say, to

09:36.200 --> 09:44.460
make some money, is to port Sailfish to the Xperia X, the Sony phone, and charge people

09:44.460 --> 09:48.760
50 euros for the ROM.

09:48.760 --> 09:53.760
Now I don't like to think of them as selling a ROM, I like to think of it more as accepting

09:53.760 --> 09:57.680
donations or forcing people to donate in order to download it.

09:57.680 --> 09:58.680
What's wrong with that?

09:58.680 --> 09:59.680
I mean, I think it's great.

09:59.680 --> 10:01.200
I think they should be charging 100 bucks.

10:01.200 --> 10:07.000
The problem is that it's a development ROM, and you can get development ROMs all over

10:07.000 --> 10:09.520
XDA for different operating systems.

10:09.520 --> 10:10.520
Oh, sure.

10:10.520 --> 10:11.520
Yeah.

10:11.520 --> 10:13.040
See, this to me, though, reads differently.

10:13.040 --> 10:16.980
I'm reading this as we're starting with this as a base, and then we are going to actually

10:16.980 --> 10:21.640
pay people to make it work really good for the Sony Xperia X.

10:21.640 --> 10:26.720
So it's like a first-class OS on the Xperia X, as if Sony shipped it running that.

10:26.720 --> 10:31.800
So if you look at their current state right now, they are lacking major features.

10:31.800 --> 10:35.960
They don't have Bluetooth, they don't support the step counter stuff, the barometer stuff,

10:35.960 --> 10:38.400
the fingerprint or the FM radio.

10:38.400 --> 10:41.320
There's all kinds of little things that are rough around the edges that they're going

10:41.320 --> 10:44.920
to have to sit down and pay somebody to fix for months.

10:44.920 --> 10:47.680
So how do you afford to do that if you don't charge?

10:47.680 --> 10:49.320
Well, I suppose.

10:49.320 --> 10:50.320
I suppose.

10:50.320 --> 10:55.480
But just for me as a consumer, I don't really have any interest in paying money for something

10:55.480 --> 10:58.520
that doesn't work, but I suppose it's not really aimed at consumers.

10:58.520 --> 10:59.520
Yeah.

10:59.520 --> 11:00.520
Plus, you still have to buy the phone.

11:00.520 --> 11:03.120
It doesn't come with a phone, so you have to get that yourself.

11:03.120 --> 11:04.120
Yeah.

11:04.120 --> 11:08.600
I mean, flashing UBIPorts on an old Nexus is one thing, and checking it out and, oh,

11:08.600 --> 11:10.400
this has got potential and stuff.

11:10.400 --> 11:16.840
And then going back to my OnePlus 3T is one thing, but committing $50 for a ROM is just

11:16.840 --> 11:18.880
not something I could ever see myself doing.

11:18.880 --> 11:24.200
But they need a revenue stream somehow, and this seems like a reasonable-ish way.

11:24.200 --> 11:28.400
I think there are people who will pay it, but it feels very niche to me.

11:28.400 --> 11:29.400
I agree.

11:29.400 --> 11:34.520
But perhaps it'll be a sustainable method to development, and you might see one day

11:34.520 --> 11:39.160
that it's just a really great ROM for that Xperia X, and you can buy that phone and just

11:39.160 --> 11:42.480
have a first-class Sailfish experience.

11:42.480 --> 11:45.640
And we'll look back at it and go, that was a great approach.

11:45.640 --> 11:48.980
Or it'll just go nowhere, Joe, because I think you're probably right.

11:48.980 --> 11:53.800
Seems to me it's a niche of a niche of a niche inside a niche.

11:53.800 --> 11:54.800
Yeah.

11:54.800 --> 11:55.800
All right.

11:55.800 --> 11:59.520
Well, let's talk about the first-class experience you've had with your Nexus 6P over the last

11:59.520 --> 12:00.520
few days.

12:00.520 --> 12:01.520
Yeah.

12:01.520 --> 12:06.080
I took the plunge for the show, of course, and upgraded the Nexus 6P to Android 8.0,

12:06.080 --> 12:08.480
which launched on August 21st.

12:08.480 --> 12:11.640
It's Google's Oreo release.

12:11.640 --> 12:16.280
And there's big changes to notifications, which are the thing I'm most excited about.

12:16.280 --> 12:21.280
I don't really know how it's going to play out yet because no applications support these

12:21.280 --> 12:22.280
new things.

12:22.280 --> 12:26.760
But the big one that matters to me is notification channels and notification grouping of the

12:26.760 --> 12:28.580
visual alerts.

12:28.580 --> 12:32.060
Those are going to be great features for those of us that are a little sensitive to interruptions

12:32.060 --> 12:33.480
by notifications.

12:33.480 --> 12:37.020
But there's other nice things in here too, Joe, but nothing that really jumped out at

12:37.020 --> 12:38.760
me immediately as an end user.

12:38.760 --> 12:39.760
Yeah.

12:39.760 --> 12:42.220
It all seems to be sort of behind-the-scenes stuff, doesn't it?

12:42.220 --> 12:47.360
Just making things a little bit better, optimizations.

12:47.360 --> 12:53.280
The autofill API is pretty cool so that password managers will be able to speak directly to

12:53.280 --> 12:57.080
applications, and that should make security a little bit better.

12:57.080 --> 12:59.280
That'll remove a bit of a barrier for some people.

12:59.280 --> 13:00.280
Yeah.

13:00.280 --> 13:05.040
Now it'll be easier to use really complicated passwords and password managers when you're

13:05.040 --> 13:07.280
logging into your apps and websites.

13:07.280 --> 13:10.600
That's going to be super nice if apps update to trigger that.

13:10.600 --> 13:11.600
Yeah.

13:11.600 --> 13:13.480
I don't know about fingerprint gestures.

13:13.480 --> 13:15.700
Now I've finally got a fingerprint reader.

13:15.700 --> 13:20.760
It doesn't work all that well, for me at least, so I'm wondering if fingerprint gestures are

13:20.760 --> 13:24.120
even going to be a practical thing, and I just can't really envisage how they're going

13:24.120 --> 13:25.120
to work.

13:25.120 --> 13:27.120
But clearly some developers have got ideas about that.

13:27.120 --> 13:32.720
I have a suspicion that a week or two into using Android 8, I'll have a better idea if

13:32.720 --> 13:35.840
their new background limits work.

13:35.840 --> 13:39.880
These are more like an iPhone, the way it works with limiting background things.

13:39.880 --> 13:44.560
It limits what apps can do in the background in broadcasting on any of your antennas, on

13:44.560 --> 13:49.400
the services they can pull on, on how often they can grab location, and these things,

13:49.400 --> 13:54.640
just tampering down on that a bit, could actually make some pretty significant overall improvements

13:54.640 --> 13:55.640
in battery life.

13:55.640 --> 13:58.380
So I'll probably give you an update on that at some point.

13:58.380 --> 14:01.680
If I ever get it on a tablet, I'd probably enjoy the new picture-in-picture mode.

14:01.680 --> 14:05.440
They say it works on phones too, but that sounds kind of nice.

14:05.440 --> 14:09.040
So if you're on Telegram and watching YouTube video, you could pop out the YouTube video

14:09.040 --> 14:12.580
and then go back into Telegram chat and keep watching the video, so that all sounds kind

14:12.580 --> 14:13.580
of nice.

14:13.580 --> 14:18.000
As for the background limiting, I do worry a little bit about that, because on the one

14:18.000 --> 14:22.960
hand, yeah, it's great for battery optimization, there's no doubt about that, but isn't one

14:22.960 --> 14:26.720
of the great things about Android the proper multitasking that it can do?

14:26.720 --> 14:30.880
You can leave things running in the background that you want to be running, so I think they've

14:30.880 --> 14:35.280
got to get the granularity of that right, so that some apps that you genuinely want

14:35.280 --> 14:37.440
to be running in the background can still do that.

14:37.440 --> 14:41.480
Otherwise you end up with the iPhone, which is, is it fair to say pseudo-multitasking?

14:41.480 --> 14:46.320
Yeah, it's, you have certain privileged APIs that can run in the background, and outside

14:46.320 --> 14:48.480
of that your application gets suspended.

14:48.480 --> 14:52.080
It does make for better battery life, but you're right, it is one of the things I like

14:52.080 --> 14:54.560
about Android, as long as you manage it properly.

14:54.560 --> 15:00.040
I don't think most end users do, but I think most geeks and tech users probably manage

15:00.040 --> 15:01.280
that pretty good.

15:01.280 --> 15:06.400
Well, maybe I'll get to try it one day, once Lineage gets the code, which it has been open

15:06.400 --> 15:11.520
source now, so I'm sure there'll be a Lineage ROM coming soon, and as soon as I get that

15:11.520 --> 15:13.680
I'll check it out on one of my Nexus devices.

15:13.680 --> 15:17.160
I'd be tempted to try that myself, that might be when I switch over to Lineage.

15:17.160 --> 15:23.320
I'll say this, the first about hour that I had Android O on my Nexus 6P, it was very

15:23.320 --> 15:24.320
sluggish.

15:24.320 --> 15:26.680
I think it must have been running in some background processes, but then after that

15:26.680 --> 15:32.000
the performance has been pretty great, and overall, one of my smoother Android updates.

15:32.000 --> 15:36.080
It's pretty minimal update in terms of what you see, things just look a little more refined,

15:36.080 --> 15:43.080
and the performance seems to be about the same after the first hour or two of the update.

15:43.080 --> 15:45.560
last.ting.com, l-e-s.ting.com.

15:45.560 --> 15:51.920
Go there to support this show, keep us going, and get $25 in Ting service credits or $25

15:51.920 --> 15:54.360
off a device over at Ting.

15:54.360 --> 15:57.420
Ting is mobile done right.

15:57.420 --> 16:01.400
The average Ting bill is just $23 per phone per month.

16:01.400 --> 16:04.640
It's $6 for your baseline, and then your usage on top of that.

16:04.640 --> 16:09.600
You just pay for what you use, there's no crazy agreements or contracts or early termination

16:09.600 --> 16:10.600
fees.

16:10.600 --> 16:14.240
They have nationwide coverage, GSM and CDMA to choose from.

16:14.240 --> 16:15.240
You just pay for what you use.

16:15.240 --> 16:20.440
You want a couple of phones, $6 a line, plus whatever Uncle Sam's cut is in your local

16:20.440 --> 16:21.440
neck of the woods.

16:21.440 --> 16:24.400
The thing that Ting is really focused on is an incredible user experience.

16:24.400 --> 16:29.280
A great control panel, fantastic customer service, and a blog that's constantly updated

16:29.280 --> 16:30.920
with useful information.

16:30.920 --> 16:34.720
They got the full spectrum of devices from really nice value devices all the way up to

16:34.720 --> 16:39.040
the brand new greatest iPhones and Galaxy devices.

16:39.040 --> 16:42.980
Also, just grab a Nexus device and bring it over to Ting.

16:42.980 --> 16:47.000
They're great, and they have CDMA and GSM support so you can pick whatever works best

16:47.000 --> 16:48.480
in your area.

16:48.480 --> 16:49.480
last.ting.com.

16:49.480 --> 16:58.640
Okay, let's talk about Chrome OS and their new Enterprise Edition.

16:58.640 --> 17:02.440
Not content with dominating the education market, at least in the US.

17:02.440 --> 17:05.760
Google have decided they're going to have a go at Enterprise now.

17:05.760 --> 17:10.120
It kind of makes sense because the Enterprise doesn't really want to move beyond Windows

17:10.120 --> 17:16.600
7 because 8, disaster, 10, don't really like that very much.

17:16.600 --> 17:21.960
They're going to have this version that has active directory support and is only going

17:21.960 --> 17:29.080
to be $50 per year per device, which compared to Windows license is not very much.

17:29.080 --> 17:30.920
They're really going after Microsoft here.

17:30.920 --> 17:34.960
They're going after Microsoft's bread and butter because this also comes with Google

17:34.960 --> 17:38.560
Apps, which is a direct competitor to Microsoft Office.

17:38.560 --> 17:43.680
The offline Enterprise features like active directory integration means we'll support

17:43.680 --> 17:46.880
your existing authorization infrastructure.

17:46.880 --> 17:48.520
This was a classic Microsoft move.

17:48.520 --> 17:50.440
They did this to NetWare.

17:50.440 --> 17:54.200
Microsoft came in early to try to get Windows Server to take off and they said, we'll support

17:54.200 --> 17:56.400
your NetWare infrastructure.

17:56.400 --> 17:59.720
And then eventually everybody moved off of NetWare.

17:59.720 --> 18:02.680
This is a brilliant strategy by Google.

18:02.680 --> 18:05.880
If I was Microsoft, I'd be very worried here.

18:05.880 --> 18:06.880
It's getting a bit crowded.

18:06.880 --> 18:10.960
Of course, Microsoft's focused on perhaps greener pastures.

18:10.960 --> 18:16.320
Microsoft and Red Hat have just announced plans to expand an alliance that they've had

18:16.320 --> 18:18.200
in place for a few years now.

18:18.200 --> 18:22.720
There will be now native support made available for Windows Server containers on Red Hat's

18:22.720 --> 18:28.040
OpenShift platform, which is their Kubernetes-based container application platform.

18:28.040 --> 18:33.280
Red Hat's OpenShift Dedicated, is what it's called, will be offered also on Azure.

18:33.280 --> 18:34.280
Kubernetes.

18:34.280 --> 18:35.280
I've always said Kubernetes.

18:35.280 --> 18:36.280
I don't know.

18:36.280 --> 18:37.280
I've never...

18:37.280 --> 18:38.280
I think Kubernetes might be right.

18:38.280 --> 18:39.440
Kubernetes is just an old habit of mine.

18:39.440 --> 18:40.720
I'm horrible with those kinds of things.

18:40.720 --> 18:43.200
Don't follow my pronunciation.

18:43.200 --> 18:46.360
Get external verification.

18:46.360 --> 18:50.160
With this cozying up, it looks good from a corporate point of view, but it doesn't look

18:50.160 --> 18:51.880
good community-wise, does it?

18:51.880 --> 18:53.820
Is that really a thing anymore?

18:53.820 --> 18:58.200
Because this is really about running Windows on GNU slash Linux, isn't it?

18:58.200 --> 19:04.120
In fact, the third aspect of this, which is really big to my old school IT ears, is they're

19:04.120 --> 19:10.320
also greatly expanding the relationship, quote unquote, of the availability of SQL Server

19:10.320 --> 19:11.920
on Red Hat Enterprise Linux.

19:11.920 --> 19:12.920
Well, yeah.

19:12.920 --> 19:18.680
That means that you can either run Red Hat on Windows or Windows on Red Hat and SQL Server

19:18.680 --> 19:19.680
on either.

19:19.680 --> 19:20.680
Yeah.

19:20.680 --> 19:27.880
It's like a bigger, higher-stakes version of the old deal that they established with

19:27.880 --> 19:32.740
Novell back in the day to run SUSE Linux on Windows virtual servers.

19:32.740 --> 19:36.960
This is Windows servers for the most part, Windows containers actually, running on Red

19:36.960 --> 19:41.360
Hat's OpenShift platform, which is eating a lot of Microsoft's lunch too these days.

19:41.360 --> 19:43.600
Well, I suppose if you can't beat them, join them, right?

19:43.600 --> 19:44.600
Yeah, absolutely.

19:44.600 --> 19:46.320
And it's still a win for Microsoft at the end of the day.

19:46.320 --> 19:50.600
If you're spinning up a Red Hat instance on Azure, that's revenue for Microsoft.

19:50.600 --> 19:51.600
Yeah.

19:51.600 --> 19:56.080
But you've downplayed the community thing, but to me, I seriously think that it just

19:56.080 --> 20:00.280
makes people wary of Red Hat and therefore, by extension, Fedora.

20:00.280 --> 20:02.960
It just makes me think, it just makes me feel a bit dirty.

20:02.960 --> 20:07.000
If I was a Fedora user, I'd just be like, I don't really like that Red Hat are cozying

20:07.000 --> 20:09.040
up so much with Microsoft.

20:09.040 --> 20:12.400
What about Ubuntu in the Windows store or SUSE in the Windows store, does that bother

20:12.400 --> 20:13.400
you?

20:13.400 --> 20:17.880
A bit, if I'm honest, yeah.

20:17.880 --> 20:20.040
I feel like it's just a sign of the times.

20:20.040 --> 20:21.040
Things have changed.

20:21.040 --> 20:22.040
Yeah, definitely.

20:22.040 --> 20:26.480
You just have to accept it, but it doesn't make me feel any happier about it.

20:26.480 --> 20:30.800
Maybe I'm being a proper neckbeard here, but it's just, to me, Red Hat, they've always

20:30.800 --> 20:36.480
been the corporate side of Linux, but this to me, it really rams that point home and

20:36.480 --> 20:41.160
how they really, I keep using the word cozying up, but that's all I can think of because

20:41.160 --> 20:46.000
they're just being so corporate about it and just not caring really about anything but

20:46.000 --> 20:47.200
the bottom line here.

20:47.200 --> 20:52.000
They're not really caring about freedom and all the storm and stuff, and I suppose they

20:52.000 --> 20:53.000
never have.

20:53.000 --> 20:58.560
They've always pushed open source and never once talked about free software, but it doesn't

20:58.560 --> 20:59.720
sit right with me.

20:59.720 --> 21:01.640
Yeah, fair enough.

21:01.640 --> 21:04.960
I suppose there's probably a lot of people that feel the way you do.

21:04.960 --> 21:08.600
Medusa, they're unperturbed by the expansion of the Red Hat Microsoft deal.

21:08.600 --> 21:09.880
Well, so they say.

21:09.880 --> 21:11.400
Yeah, of course.

21:11.400 --> 21:14.360
It's funny that they even make a statement about it.

21:14.360 --> 21:22.360
They were asked to comment though by IT Wire, and I don't know, it's sort of cagey.

21:22.360 --> 21:26.440
I guess the question was posed to them, what do you think about Microsoft and Red Hat quote

21:26.440 --> 21:31.720
unquote cozying up and Red Hat becoming the preferred provider for Linux, and their response

21:31.720 --> 21:34.040
was I don't see where it says Red Hat is preferred.

21:34.040 --> 21:35.920
Perhaps I'm missing something.

21:35.920 --> 21:38.600
They're very direct, aren't they?

21:38.600 --> 21:42.180
Very unambiguous, if it doesn't say that.

21:42.180 --> 21:46.200
They also tweeted out after that, what's your toolkit for containers?

21:46.200 --> 21:49.800
We've expanded our offering staying true to hashtag open source.

21:49.800 --> 21:53.920
Yeah, and they talk about being an open source company and all the rest of it.

21:53.920 --> 21:59.200
To me, trying to appeal to the community, sending Richard over to WorldCamp to tell

21:59.200 --> 22:04.280
us all about how everything's open source and really community driven and all the rest

22:04.280 --> 22:05.280
of it.

22:05.280 --> 22:06.840
That's the image they're trying to go for, aren't they?

22:06.840 --> 22:10.640
They want to make money, but they don't want to be seen to be really corporate at the same

22:10.640 --> 22:11.640
time.

22:11.640 --> 22:15.360
And it's a good distraction from the fact that you totally fumbled the container craze

22:15.360 --> 22:19.000
and nobody's using SUSE to run all these container platforms.

22:19.000 --> 22:20.000
But they're working on it now, Chris.

22:20.000 --> 22:21.000
That's the main thing.

22:21.000 --> 22:25.280
Yeah, and I shouldn't say nobody, but it's essentially in terms of market, nobody.

22:25.280 --> 22:26.280
Yeah.

22:26.280 --> 22:29.840
But either way, they're still going to use BtreeFS or ButterFS, aren't they?

22:29.840 --> 22:33.960
Yeah, so people have been wondering what's going to happen now that more distributions

22:33.960 --> 22:38.640
are either launching with ZFS support or turning away from ButterFS support like Red Hat, who

22:38.640 --> 22:42.680
was a while ago a rather large contributor, and is now saying we're going to focus on

22:42.680 --> 22:44.680
other things like Project Stratus.

22:44.680 --> 22:49.360
SUSE has made a post on the SUSE blog over at suse.com, and they say that they're committed

22:49.360 --> 22:54.040
to ButterFS as the default file system for SUSE, Linux, Enterprise, and beyond.

22:54.040 --> 22:57.640
Well, they're nothing if stubborn, is that a word for it?

22:57.640 --> 23:01.600
They've decided to use ButterFS and they're sticking to it.

23:01.600 --> 23:02.600
What can you say, fair play?

23:02.600 --> 23:06.840
I am glad somebody is going to continue to support it and invest in it, because it does

23:06.840 --> 23:10.400
have potential and maybe one day could really be something great for everyone.

23:10.400 --> 23:13.980
There's a little insight into the thinking that they have on their blog in this post.

23:13.980 --> 23:18.840
They brag about being the number one upstream contributor now to ButterFS.

23:18.840 --> 23:22.500
That's sort of like that socially awkward guy who's the last one at a party bragging

23:22.500 --> 23:25.080
about how he's the only one still partying.

23:25.080 --> 23:26.120
Everyone's left.

23:26.120 --> 23:31.360
We're all moved on to other things, and now, sort of by process of elimination, they're

23:31.360 --> 23:32.800
the number one upstream contributor.

23:32.800 --> 23:36.480
As they've scaled up their investment and other people have left, like Red Hat, and

23:36.480 --> 23:42.840
Oracle has dialed way back, and Facebook is dialing back, you have essentially independent

23:42.840 --> 23:43.840
contributors left.

23:43.840 --> 23:47.000
You have Fujitsu, you have SUSE.

23:47.000 --> 23:51.120
In that list, SUSE is obviously the number one contributor, but yet they still make a

23:51.120 --> 23:53.400
point to brag about it in the post.

23:53.400 --> 24:00.660
It's funny that they address the issues with ButterFS and say that they still haven't implemented

24:00.660 --> 24:06.080
the automatic defragmentation, the in-band deduplication, and the higher RAID levels,

24:06.080 --> 24:10.560
and they say because the quality of these options is not where it ought to be, which

24:10.560 --> 24:12.260
again is kind of fair enough, really.

24:12.260 --> 24:17.360
That's them saying, look, the main bit of ButterFS is fine and enterprise-ready, but

24:17.360 --> 24:22.440
there's certain features which we don't think are, and so we're just refusing to support

24:22.440 --> 24:23.440
them.

24:23.440 --> 24:25.680
Yeah, completely reasonable and a safe way to do it.

24:25.680 --> 24:26.800
That is good.

24:26.800 --> 24:30.440
The sentence before that, though, indicates where the cracks are in the surface, because

24:30.440 --> 24:36.000
the sentence before that is, and against the demand of some of our partners, we're still

24:36.000 --> 24:38.760
refusing to support these things.

24:38.760 --> 24:43.160
So their partners, which might be a way of saying customers or people that want to base

24:43.160 --> 24:45.440
off of SUSE, want these features.

24:45.440 --> 24:47.280
They need these features in production.

24:47.280 --> 24:52.680
They're coming to SUSE and saying ButterFS isn't sufficient for us, so they write this

24:52.680 --> 24:54.920
in as demand, as if they're silly.

24:54.920 --> 24:59.200
As if their silly business use cases don't really matter, and if they would just calm

24:59.200 --> 25:04.280
down and just use the safe ButterFS implementation that the overlords at SUSE have implemented,

25:04.280 --> 25:07.120
everything would be fine.

25:07.120 --> 25:13.240
That's sort of a weird way of thinking about it, but it's a harsh way for me to look at

25:13.240 --> 25:19.480
this, I suppose, because if I zoom out from this blog post and some of the way it's written,

25:19.480 --> 25:27.600
I am overall really glad that a large contributor to open source like SUSE is taking ButterFS

25:27.600 --> 25:28.600
under their wing.

25:28.600 --> 25:32.920
They're really kind of owning it here with this blog post, and I'm glad someone is owning

25:32.920 --> 25:37.520
it and someone's saying we're going to stay committed, we're going to keep making it better.

25:37.520 --> 25:38.960
That's a good thing for open source.

25:38.960 --> 25:44.320
Man, I just can't help but think back to being in college listening to the Linux Action Show

25:44.320 --> 25:48.160
and you guys talking about how great this new thing was going to be, and here we are

25:48.160 --> 25:52.360
all these years later and you've got one distro using it.

25:52.360 --> 25:54.360
Yeah, yeah, it really is something.

25:54.360 --> 25:58.360
And there's some hardware out there using it too, but maybe future developments will

25:58.360 --> 26:01.120
be pretty great and adoption will take off again.

26:01.120 --> 26:02.400
There's one way you can find out.

26:02.400 --> 26:06.580
