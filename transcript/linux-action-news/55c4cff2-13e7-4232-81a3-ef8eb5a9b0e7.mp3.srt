00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,600
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, our weekly take on Linux and the open source world.

2
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:20,000
This is episode four, recorded on June 4th, 2017.

3
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
I'm Chris.

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
And I'm Joe.

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Hello, Joe.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,380
It's good to be with you again, and we have a great news lineup, but our first story is

7
00:00:27,380 --> 00:00:30,160
about Plasma 5.10 this week.

8
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:33,520
And I watched the story with interest because as soon as it landed, I thought, is this

9
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:36,260
the release that Joe switches to Plasma?

10
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:37,560
Because it's a good one, Joe.

11
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:39,360
It's got a lot of nice features.

12
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:42,400
It's simple by default and powerful when needed.

13
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:43,400
Very good.

14
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:44,400
Very good.

15
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:49,480
Did it draw you in with their new task manager configurations or folder view by default on

16
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:50,480
the desktop?

17
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:53,640
Well, put it this way, it's further improvement.

18
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:54,840
There's no doubt about that.

19
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:56,480
It's a lot of further improvement.

20
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:57,960
It's a lot of things that they've improved.

21
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:02,660
Yeah, the little changes they've made are definitely improvements and it's refinement

22
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:06,920
and it's making it more and more stable and just better.

23
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:13,280
However, the thought of it, it's like, I don't know, when you think about a really nice meal,

24
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:17,320
then you have, you actually eat it and it's a bit of a disappointment because I actually

25
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:18,320
did try it out.

26
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:25,800
I tried out 5.9 first and then 5.10 and don't get me wrong.

27
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:31,040
I'm not going to say it's bad, but it wasn't quite as good as I remembered it being.

28
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:36,600
And then going back to XFC, it was just like, ah, putting in a really comfortable pair of

29
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:38,840
trousers or something.

30
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:42,160
Just going back to XFC, that's what I want.

31
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:44,880
That's how I like to live my computing experience.

32
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:50,440
And so as much as I admire what they're doing, it's not for me yet.

33
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:55,040
It's very much kind of down the line, this abstract point in the future for me.

34
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:59,520
I am impressed with every single release, how many things they've made nicer or better

35
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:04,600
when it comes to the way the notification tray works or working with audio devices.

36
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:08,420
But their work on future Wayland support, I think, has put them ahead of just about

37
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:10,720
every other project out there.

38
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:14,160
So one of the things that jumps out at me now that Kaywin supports that I bet a lot

39
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:19,000
of you would be interested in is scaling support when you have different levels of DPI support

40
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,040
on your monitor.

41
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:24,440
So if you have one monitor that's high DPI, say your laptop monitor, and then you connect

42
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:30,600
an external display that is not high DPI, even if it's very high resolution, in X land,

43
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:34,040
in the world of X, everything's going to be one resolution.

44
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:38,040
And so your non-high DPI monitor ends up with everything huge.

45
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:42,760
And now Kaywin has baked in support for scaling at different levels if you have a high DPI

46
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:44,400
and a normal DPI monitor.

47
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,960
That's a home run feature for me.

48
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:47,820
Yeah, it feels very modern.

49
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:49,480
Everything about it feels modern, doesn't it?

50
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:52,840
Yeah, and the performance overall is continuing to get better.

51
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:58,440
I gave a little quick mention to the audio tweaks that they made that I like.

52
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:04,280
The audio volume applet now has a handy menu on each device which you can click on and

53
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:07,240
you can choose the default, so for like headphones or speakers.

54
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:11,600
So you can go to your audio device like I have hooked up to this computer we're recording

55
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:16,400
on and I can say use the headphone jack or use the main speaker jack that I have my big

56
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:20,000
speakers plugged into right there from the system tray menu.

57
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,200
I have a lot of positive stuff to say about it.

58
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:25,720
It hasn't switched me yet, but I'm mostly positive on this release.

59
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:28,080
Can I be a little bit negative about the audio stuff?

60
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,080
Sure.

61
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:32,440
So for you, or for me, that's really useful.

62
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:37,960
But for the average person, isn't that just more clutter, more options, more...

63
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:42,440
That's something KDE's always criticized for is there being too much configuration.

64
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:46,920
And this just adds clutter, doesn't it, to what otherwise most people, they plug their

65
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:51,000
headphones in to their laptop or they unplug them so they're either on speakers or headphones.

66
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:56,840
They don't have two different audio interfaces and a mixer or whatever.

67
00:03:56,840 --> 00:04:02,160
I can see why you really like it and it appeals to me definitely, but to the average person,

68
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:03,160
not sure.

69
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:04,320
It depends on how it's implemented.

70
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:08,280
So if by default for the average person, they plug in their headphones and everything just

71
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:12,880
works by default, then they nailed it because you see, Joe, they've embraced the wonder

72
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:15,040
of the hamburger menu.

73
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:20,160
And so you just have a standard audio device list, but the next to the audio device on

74
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,360
the right-hand side is the hamburger menu.

75
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:26,160
And then you click that thing and that's where you get all your extra crazy options, like

76
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:28,680
which particular output device and whatnot.

77
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:32,240
And that almost might be a compromise that works.

78
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:38,920
But this really is the opposite to GNOME and Unity RIP.

79
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:42,240
It's so aimed at power users who want to configure their system, isn't it?

80
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:45,440
And they say simple by default.

81
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:46,840
And for me, it's not really.

82
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:50,720
I don't like all the animations, I don't like all the widgets and stuff.

83
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:53,840
I like XFCE simplicity.

84
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:56,900
But the thing is that I can make it that way.

85
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:59,440
You can make it however you want and I can turn all the animations off.

86
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:04,200
I can make it really, really simple or you can go completely the other way.

87
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:07,240
But it is almost sort of made for tinkerers.

88
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:11,420
And when they say powerful when needed, that's basically them saying incredibly complicated

89
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:13,920
if you want it to be.

90
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:19,140
And so the question is, are the defaults sane enough for the average user?

91
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:21,200
And I don't know where I stand on that.

92
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:24,840
They're certainly not for me, the defaults, because as I say, I have to turn all those

93
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:25,840
animations off.

94
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:27,840
But what do you think?

95
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:30,760
Can you put yourself in an average user's shoes?

96
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:32,720
To me, it feels like it's got a lot going on.

97
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:35,120
It does still have a lot going on.

98
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:37,080
And I love it for it.

99
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:40,400
I mean, I really do because for me, that's what I want.

100
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:44,080
And I'm glad that there is somebody making a desktop that can try to be a little more

101
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:48,800
distraction free, but at the end of the day, still gives me the ability to choose particular

102
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,560
individual niddly settings.

103
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:54,920
I think that's a great, great, perfect balance for power users, which I think is going to

104
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:57,420
be the predominant Linux desktop user.

105
00:05:57,420 --> 00:06:00,560
And I think it's going to make general Linux desktop more competitive.

106
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:04,240
I think no one in particular now may have to respond to some of these nice features

107
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:08,360
and at least consider how they could make their desktop more appealing to power users.

108
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:13,560
But to your core point, Joe, I'm not so sure this is a great desktop for the quote unquote

109
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:15,040
totally new user.

110
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:18,320
And I think that's probably why you still see things like the Mate project doing really

111
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:21,680
well and also a Cinnamon and others.

112
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:26,400
There's still some, there is still a niche out there, but I'm a pretty big believer these

113
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:30,880
days that that's a niche of a niche, just the random new user stumbling into Linux accidentally.

114
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:33,360
I think it's now full of people that want to get work done.

115
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:36,120
They're pretty familiar with their options and they just want something that works really

116
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:38,560
well and gives them the features they want.

117
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:41,360
I think there's going to be a good group of people out there that the Plasmid desktop

118
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,880
is going to be pretty competitive for.

119
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:43,880
Yeah.

120
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:47,560
And the snap and flat pack support is a good hedge as far as I'm concerned.

121
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:50,400
Don't put all your eggs in one basket because who knows which one of them is going to win

122
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:51,400
out.

123
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:54,340
And the reality is it's Linux, probably both.

124
00:06:54,340 --> 00:06:57,200
So that's good to see that support in there as well.

125
00:06:57,200 --> 00:07:00,760
You're not even putting all of your eggs in one distribution basket, but for those of

126
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:06,100
us that may be looking more and more at XFCE these days, and I include myself in that particular

127
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:08,160
basket, there could be some good news, Joe.

128
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,160
Yeah.

129
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:14,320
On the XFCE blog this week appeared a post, the road to XFCE 4.14.

130
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:20,380
And so it's been a long time coming, but it looks like they are starting to ramp up, seriously

131
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:27,340
ramp up the move to GTK 3, which is badly, badly needed.

132
00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:31,720
It's been on GTK 2 for the longest time now and it's starting to get left behind.

133
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:36,280
You look at Marte, which has made the transition admirably and is looking really, really good

134
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:42,400
on GTK 3, and XFCE basically needed to decide whether they were going to do this or die.

135
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:45,680
And I was really worried that they were going to die, but it's looking good.

136
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:47,160
We haven't got much yet.

137
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:52,480
We had the panel that was ported last week, didn't mention that at the time.

138
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:56,840
But now there is at least a plan in place to make this happen.

139
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:58,920
So I'm really, really crossing my fingers.

140
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:00,760
I just want this to happen.

141
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:06,320
This transition is coming as part of the 4.14 release, do I understand that correctly?

142
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:07,320
Yeah.

143
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:12,360
And so they're trying to get to a GTK 3 minimum version of 3.20.

144
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:20,800
And the reason why I mentioned that particular challenge is in the road to this 4.14 release,

145
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:26,680
they've already had to shift the goalpost once because they were initially targeting

146
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:31,800
GTK 3.14, which is very old now.

147
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:35,200
And things have changed, things have broken in GTK since then.

148
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:40,760
And so most distributions today are shipping with at least GTK 3.20.

149
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:44,160
And so by the time they get this thing out, I bet you most of them will be running 3.22.

150
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:50,160
Probably, yeah, because XFCE development is glacial, to say the least.

151
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:54,440
So it may even be beyond that.

152
00:08:54,440 --> 00:09:00,200
I keep hearing that GTK 4, it's only around the corner, and they're still stuck on 2.

153
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:04,960
So by the time they finally get GTK 3 ported properly and working, GTK 4 is going to be

154
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:06,280
here.

155
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:10,820
But as long as they can get GTK 3 working, that's good enough for me, especially being

156
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:14,960
an LTS and Ubuntu LTS user, I can get a few years out of it.

157
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:20,880
And then hopefully this will spur them on to then target GTK 4 next.

158
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:23,800
I mean, that's a long way ahead.

159
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:29,480
But XFCE to me, as I always say, is the perfect balance between features and weight.

160
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:35,560
And as much as I am warming to KDE because I like all of the configuration options and

161
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:39,480
stuff and because of the excellent Wayland support and all that, and the fact that it's

162
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:46,240
a very modern, forward-looking desktop, XFCE still is very good.

163
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:51,920
And you talked about potentially thinking about it, presumably for your infrastructure,

164
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:54,600
not for your laptop or whatever, but for the studio infrastructure.

165
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:55,600
Yeah, yeah.

166
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:58,520
Yeah, for the main recording systems we're on.

167
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:02,760
Just before Joe and I even started, my GNOME system crashed on me.

168
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:05,020
And we had to wait for me to get my system back up.

169
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:08,920
And our OBS system that GNOME Shell's on has been, GNOME Shell's been crashing a couple

170
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:09,920
of times a day.

171
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:13,200
I'm a huge GNOME 3 Shell fan, but I've been having problems with it.

172
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:18,360
And it seems like XFCE could be the perfect solution for these production systems.

173
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:26,280
And in some ways, the slow glacial development pace is a benefit because it means that I'm

174
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:30,440
going to have something that is pretty solid in production for a few years.

175
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:34,320
And it's one of the reasons why I also kind of just like good old Debian in some ways

176
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:35,320
too.

177
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:36,320
But what about Mate?

178
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:38,600
Hasn't that somewhat rendered XFCE irrelevant?

179
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:40,600
I almost feel like it's too much.

180
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:47,220
If I'm going for that utility accessory appliance-like installation, it almost feels like Mate is

181
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:49,240
too much of a desktop for me.

182
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:53,520
And it is, at that point, well, if I'm going to run a full desktop, why not run the latest

183
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:55,820
full desktop, the most modern full desktop?

184
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:57,400
And that was why GNOME 3 came along.

185
00:10:57,400 --> 00:11:01,760
But we started with Mate, had a few problems with some, a couple of little itty-bitty stability

186
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:03,920
things, a couple of graphics issues.

187
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:04,920
But it wasn't bad.

188
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:08,480
In fact, we ran it in production for a year in the studio.

189
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:13,000
And then it was only later as we started using the machines more and more for more things,

190
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,480
and more people, even people that don't normally use Linux, started sitting down in front of

191
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:18,040
these computers to use them.

192
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:21,140
We realized, well, if we're going to have a full desktop environment that has all the

193
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:23,240
bells and whistles, let's just run GNOME Shell.

194
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:26,240
Now, that's sort of emerging as a sort of a standard desktop.

195
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:30,440
It was sort of a quote-unquote forward-looking move, I admit.

196
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:32,700
And it just didn't really play out.

197
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:35,560
Because at the end of the day, I realized I don't need that on any of these systems

198
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:36,560
day to day.

199
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:40,000
When we had everybody here in the studio working on the computers, it made sense.

200
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,240
But now that it's just the regular crew, it really was way too much.

201
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:46,600
I feel like Mate would still be way too much.

202
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:50,600
Well, I'm sure Wimpress is crying into his headphones listening to this.

203
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:56,880
No, I, you know, if I was going to do it, I only run one type of Mate, and that's Ubuntu

204
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:57,880
Mate.

205
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:58,880
And I mean it.

206
00:11:58,880 --> 00:11:59,880
I mean it.

207
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:03,120
I've tried it on Arch, and I'm a much bigger fan of the implementation on Ubuntu Mate.

208
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,360
So you can put that on a poster.

209
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:06,480
Yeah, it is tightly integrated.

210
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:11,040
If you've got someone who's a key player in the Mate project running his own distro, then

211
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:12,680
you know you're going to get the best of it.

212
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:13,680
Yeah, it's great.

213
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:18,400
So speaking of distros that might be well-positioned to feature a desktop, Fedora 26 is coming

214
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:20,720
out, and that's going to be a great desktop featuring Gnome Shell.

215
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,360
Fedora always is.

216
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:24,000
You're just going to have to wait a little bit.

217
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:30,340
Yeah, delayed as usual, about a month at the moment by the looks of things.

218
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:31,480
There's not much to say.

219
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:32,680
It's expected, isn't it?

220
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:40,080
And when I spoke to Matthew recently on Late Night Linux, we agreed that it's the kind

221
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:44,240
of distro where you don't just push it out at an arbitrary date, you wait until it's

222
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,240
ready.

223
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:49,920
Not quite to the extent that Debian does, but it's a nice compromise, I think.

224
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:53,680
Why push something out that's not ready just because you agreed to do it on a certain date?

225
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:54,920
I so agree.

226
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:57,080
And also congratulations to Matt.

227
00:12:57,080 --> 00:13:02,680
June 2nd was his third year anniversary, I believe, somewhere around there, of being

228
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:04,720
the guy that ran the Fedora project.

229
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:05,720
Somewhere.

230
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:07,260
He's got to set a record now, I think, at this point.

231
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:12,240
So that was a good chat if you guys haven't checked that episode of Late Night Linux out.

232
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:15,340
I guess a couple of things hanging up the beta at this point.

233
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:18,900
So because the beta is hung up, the release gets hung up, it's a domino effect.

234
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:24,040
There are some issues causing RPM hangs after updating to a GLib 2.25.

235
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:26,480
And of course, you can just go check the bug list if you care.

236
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:29,000
OK, so let's talk about Core Boot.

237
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:33,720
And that project has joined Conservancy as a member project.

238
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:42,300
So Core Boot, as you probably know, is the free BIOS or EFI replacement, which I suppose

239
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:48,720
is most commonly found on Chromebooks, kind of ironically, given Google's love of proprietary

240
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:50,680
stuff as well.

241
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:56,480
And they've decided to join Conservancy, who will look after not the kind of day-to-day

242
00:13:56,480 --> 00:14:00,920
code and stuff, but more of the administration that goes around it.

243
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:04,160
And I can see why they'd want to do that, because that kind of stuff is just a real

244
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:08,280
headache and you just want to get on with coding and testing and the actual interesting

245
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:09,280
stuff.

246
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:12,680
Yeah, and they say, this is Patrick, which is one of the long-term contributors to Core

247
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:13,680
Boot.

248
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:18,400
He says, by joining the Conservancy, Core Boot benefits from the project's organization

249
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:22,640
in terms of not just how to structure your project, here's some of the files and papers

250
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:25,600
and things and I's and T's you needed, all that.

251
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:28,600
But they also take care of community organization.

252
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:31,920
And I think that's probably a key part for people that just want to focus on code.

253
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:33,360
Don't have to worry about the legal stuff.

254
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:34,500
We want to have a great community.

255
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:37,400
We want to have a healthy community, but we're so busy writing code, we can't really manage

256
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:38,400
the community.

257
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:44,800
If the Conservancy can help that, too, that could be really great.

258
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:49,600
Thanks to Ting for sponsoring Linux Action News, last.ting.com, las.ting.com.

259
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:54,140
Go there to support the show and get $25 off a Ting device.

260
00:14:54,140 --> 00:14:57,760
If you bring a device, and you might want to do that, they have a BYOD page, you'll

261
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:01,480
get $25 in service credit, which gets applied to your line.

262
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:03,760
Average Ting bill is about $23 a month.

263
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:05,800
It's pay for what you use wireless.

264
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:07,080
If you've got a family, it's great.

265
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:11,480
So it's $6 for each line you want on the family plan, because it's sort of a family plan.

266
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:14,600
It's just pay for what you want wireless, and you can just use it however you want.

267
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:17,600
So I've got three devices, one for myself and two other family members.

268
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:20,760
And it's like $37 to $40 a month, depending on our usage.

269
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:23,600
Everywhere we go, we've got Wi-Fi, so I hardly ever pay for data.

270
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:28,080
I treat the mobile network like backup signal, and I use Telegram for all my text messaging,

271
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:32,560
so I pay nothing, almost nothing, unless something breaks, and I get a bunch of SMS alerts.

272
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:33,560
And that's what's beautiful.

273
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:39,800
Like, I had a busy month, my Linux Fest Northwest month, it was like a $34 month for me.

274
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:43,960
And then, you know, I go back and maybe one month's like $23, depending on what's going

275
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:44,960
on.

276
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:47,420
It's pay for what you use wireless, and you're in complete control.

277
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:51,640
You get all the information on their dashboard, in your app, and they have great customer

278
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:52,640
service.

279
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:56,680
And GSM, just get started by going to alas.ting.com.

280
00:15:56,680 --> 00:16:03,000
And a big thank you to Ting for sponsoring the Linux Action News.

281
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:08,640
So by now, it's pretty clear that Linux has dominated almost every market, apart from

282
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:09,640
the desktop.

283
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:11,240
But let's not talk too much about that.

284
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:17,800
It's dominated the server market, and cloud, and Internet of Things, and embedded devices,

285
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:20,660
Android, that kind of thing.

286
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:26,080
And now, it's looking like it's going to break into the automotive industry.

287
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:30,720
I was initially a little skeptical when I saw what is going on here, but this is the

288
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:33,920
Linux Foundation's automotive grade Linux project.

289
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:36,920
And they're celebrating their first big name user.

290
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:41,080
Toyota announced this week that they're going to employ automotive grade Linux in their

291
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:47,800
2018 Camry model, which means that the infotainment dashboard system will be running Linux.

292
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:48,880
And this is a big name.

293
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:52,360
There's other big names in there, though, Mazda's in there, I think Ford is in there

294
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:54,500
to some degree.

295
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:57,320
There's some other good names in there, but none of them have really shipped anything.

296
00:16:57,320 --> 00:17:01,920
Toyota is one of the really originator forces behind this big effort.

297
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:04,140
But it is a foundation project.

298
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:08,740
And think of automotive grade Linux as essentially a Linux distribution for a car.

299
00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:11,620
It's mostly an 80% solution.

300
00:17:11,620 --> 00:17:16,360
The manufacturers of the car modify the OS to match their branding, and their look, and

301
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:19,360
their display setup, and their accessories.

302
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:24,800
And they write, it seems to be about 20% to 30% of their own code, depending on who you

303
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:25,800
go by.

304
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:29,080
But the whole idea here is to provide them with a base 80%.

305
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:33,400
And that is, digging into this, that is a massive amount of things.

306
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:39,240
It is a Linux system that uses Wayland, that interfaces with devices over the CAN bus.

307
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:41,020
It's very sophisticated.

308
00:17:41,020 --> 00:17:45,160
And there's hopes for this to spread beyond just the infotainment system, aren't there?

309
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:50,000
They seem to be really trying to design something that can control a lot of the car's environmental

310
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,160
systems, lighting, sound, all of it.

311
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:56,060
And they are already showing examples of that.

312
00:17:56,060 --> 00:18:01,160
They had a big showing at CES this year, where they had essentially a car dashboard using

313
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:06,180
the actual car CAN bus, and DC power, and real peripherals, and fans that would be in

314
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:07,660
like the air conditioner.

315
00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:12,960
They showed how you could run it all using Linux with automotive grades, essentially

316
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:16,820
stock example interface that the manufacturers can modify.

317
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:21,560
And it wouldn't necessarily control the timing of your engine, or the charge of your battery,

318
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:24,080
but it could go pretty deep.

319
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:27,600
The position of your chair, the memorization per user, and things like that.

320
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:30,760
Well, they're going to want to keep that engine stuff completely proprietary, aren't they?

321
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:34,720
Otherwise, how are they going to hide their emission test stuff?

322
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:37,080
Heyo, that's probably true, Joe.

323
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:38,440
But you know what it really solves?

324
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:43,380
The car manufacturers are not the world's greatest software manufacturers.

325
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:47,240
And what they've been sort of coalescing around right now is Q and X, and then blobbing on

326
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:51,160
different proprietary components to achieve what they want to get to.

327
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:57,200
And the sort of commonality feature set like over-the-air updates, and things like that

328
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:00,400
have been missing because they're all inventing their own stack.

329
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:03,720
And this is trying to solve that particular problem, which I think is pretty cool.

330
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:06,880
They don't have things like over-the-air updates yet.

331
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:10,800
Probably the biggest attraction is automotive grade Linux, at least at present from what

332
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:14,600
I can tell, and I've reached out for comment, but I haven't heard back, is I don't believe

333
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:18,320
they support Android Auto or Apple CarPlay.

334
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:20,440
Yeah, that was something I was thinking about.

335
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:24,420
Because now with Android Things, I mean, I know that's designed more for smaller things

336
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:31,260
like thermostats and stuff, but why wouldn't you go for Android as a solution?

337
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:34,400
Because that's almost kind of drop-in, isn't it?

338
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:39,380
And then you're more likely to be able to work with other Android devices and iOS.

339
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:43,900
My sense is, having looked at this project a bit, when I deep-dived, they have a pretty

340
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:44,900
good wiki.

341
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:48,960
And you, as a manufacturer, there's a lot of information you need, and there's specs

342
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:53,680
you need, and there's all kinds of things that you have to consider when you're building

343
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:57,780
that they just lay out and document for you with automotive grade Linux.

344
00:19:57,780 --> 00:20:02,840
And I suspect that because particular nature of communicating on the CAN bus and the security

345
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:07,520
requirements and working with different interfaces and working with different accessories like

346
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:13,100
knobs and controls on the steering wheel, I bet you it turned out to be more straightforward

347
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:17,160
to build something based on Linux from the ground up than to use Android.

348
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:19,200
Plus then you don't have that Google strategy tax.

349
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:21,200
Yeah, I suppose.

350
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:24,360
You have to feel a little bit bad for Canonical in all of this, though, don't you?

351
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:30,340
Because that's kind of the market, not specifically automotive, but certainly embedded systems.

352
00:20:30,340 --> 00:20:33,020
That's kind of where they're putting all their eggs now.

353
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:36,320
You're right, although I suppose you could probably deploy some of this using SNAP packages

354
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:40,540
or using something like Ubuntu Core to run the core operating system.

355
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:43,420
So there could be room for them still to play in this.

356
00:20:43,420 --> 00:20:46,060
Going back a bit, though, I don't know if the market's going to care about Apple Car

357
00:20:46,060 --> 00:20:47,700
Play or Android Auto.

358
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:49,200
I think some of them might.

359
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:51,940
It's getting more and more, maybe more and more traction these days.

360
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:56,160
It seems like something, though, that automotive grade Linux could add on with the right deals

361
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:57,160
in place.

362
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:58,880
It doesn't seem like the system inherently prevents it.

363
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:03,660
But an open source base where they complete about 80% of it, digging in there means you

364
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:08,260
get things like multi-architecture support, people auditing the security, people working

365
00:21:08,260 --> 00:21:09,700
on patches to Wayland.

366
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:14,100
They're going to be hiring a contractor here very soon to go in and add additional code

367
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:16,100
and support in Wayland.

368
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:21,780
You get real good contributions back upstream by having something like this go across industry.

369
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:25,300
And they've got, in total, more than 90 companies involved with this thing.

370
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:30,260
Yeah, let's hope that they get the package management sorted out and the upgrades organized

371
00:21:30,260 --> 00:21:35,060
properly so that you're not ending up with insecure cars out there.

372
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:36,060
It's on their roadmap.

373
00:21:36,060 --> 00:21:37,900
So that gives me some hope.

374
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:39,740
But we actually have to see it happen.

375
00:21:39,740 --> 00:21:40,740
All right.

376
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:45,140
Well, let's talk more about Android to an extent.

377
00:21:45,140 --> 00:21:50,820
And Andy Rubin, who was, I'm thinking he was the actual founder of Android in the first

378
00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:51,820
place.

379
00:21:51,820 --> 00:21:52,820
Yeah, him and his team.

380
00:21:52,820 --> 00:21:53,820
Yeah.

381
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:54,820
And he worked at Danger.

382
00:21:54,820 --> 00:21:55,820
Yep, correct.

383
00:21:55,820 --> 00:21:56,820
Yeah.

384
00:21:56,820 --> 00:22:03,260
He has announced a new company, Essential, and a new OS, Ambient OS.

385
00:22:03,260 --> 00:22:07,760
And so basically, they've got a phone that is almost ready to ship, which is just stock

386
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:14,620
Android and has attracted a lot of attention for reasons that are a little bit baffling,

387
00:22:14,620 --> 00:22:15,700
but we'll get back to that.

388
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:22,680
But what's more interesting to me is their smart home platform, which is Ambient OS.

389
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:27,180
And it's going to be, he doesn't like to call it an Echo competitor, but let's face it,

390
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:29,660
it's basically an Echo competitor.

391
00:22:29,660 --> 00:22:35,100
And the fact that we might get a proper open source version of it, albeit more Android

392
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:39,860
throw it over the wall style open source, if that succeeds, that's got to be better

393
00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:44,260
than what we've got with Amazon and Alexa.

394
00:22:44,260 --> 00:22:45,700
That does seem like a long shot.

395
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:47,060
Ambient OS is a bit of an unknown.

396
00:22:47,060 --> 00:22:49,820
I assume it's Linux based, but that's just me kind of taking a guess.

397
00:22:49,820 --> 00:22:54,220
And we've got hints that it's going to be open source and they have solutions to prevent

398
00:22:54,220 --> 00:22:56,560
people from not updating and things like that.

399
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:57,660
It looks nice.

400
00:22:57,660 --> 00:23:02,080
It's like a puck that's angled upwards with a touch LCD round screen on it.

401
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:08,980
So it combines, it's a really nice looking version of an Echo in a tube with an LCD screen.

402
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:13,980
Well, yeah, it's like that Echo, what's the Echo with the screen that's-

403
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:14,980
Echo Show?

404
00:23:14,980 --> 00:23:18,500
Yeah, it's kind of the best of both worlds to me.

405
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:22,220
Because you don't want a big stand up basically tablet with a stand, do you?

406
00:23:22,220 --> 00:23:24,540
Otherwise you just use a tablet.

407
00:23:24,540 --> 00:23:27,140
I have to note the timing of all of this.

408
00:23:27,140 --> 00:23:32,400
I do not think it's a coincidence that Andy Rubin is up on stage making a big deal about

409
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:36,700
a pre-production cell phone and about a pre-production home assistant.

410
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:40,480
I think these two things are more related than it seems.

411
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:43,700
And I have to acknowledge that tomorrow is WWDC.

412
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:47,020
Yeah where they're almost definitely going to announce the Apple home or whatever they're

413
00:23:47,020 --> 00:23:48,020
going to call it.

414
00:23:48,020 --> 00:23:52,820
It's Siri in a tube and it's key competitive advantage over the Echo in a tube is going

415
00:23:52,820 --> 00:23:56,220
to be the fact that you also have Siri in your pocket and the two can work together

416
00:23:56,220 --> 00:24:01,980
on location stuff and it is more useful to have the same two things in your pocket.

417
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:05,260
It's the same advantage that Google Assistant has once it gets rolled out across enough

418
00:24:05,260 --> 00:24:07,700
devices and people buy the actual tube.

419
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:12,100
And I think that's why Andy Rubin is on stage right now talking about it because come Monday

420
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:15,100
it's going to be obvious old news to everybody else.

421
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:17,020
Yeah, that's the key thing here.

422
00:24:17,020 --> 00:24:21,300
He has to deliver this quickly because let's circle back to the phone right.

423
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:24,100
That is basically a stock Android phone.

424
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:29,980
I think it's going to have an unlocked bootloader so it's kind of in the OnePlus territory.

425
00:24:29,980 --> 00:24:33,540
You know the OnePlus 3T is the current one, the OnePlus 5 is coming soon because they've

426
00:24:33,540 --> 00:24:34,860
decided to skip 4.

427
00:24:34,860 --> 00:24:35,900
It does seem nice.

428
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:40,820
It's got titanium around the edges, it's got a ceramic back, it's got a full glass front.

429
00:24:40,820 --> 00:24:43,260
It looks like a nice stock Android phone.

430
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:51,140
And it's not that expensive is it, well I mean it's expensive to me, $800 I think.

431
00:24:51,140 --> 00:24:52,140
Kind of quite steep.

432
00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:55,580
I think it works out in the States it's slightly less than a Pixel.

433
00:24:55,580 --> 00:24:58,420
Yeah, which is well overpriced as far as I'm concerned.

434
00:24:58,420 --> 00:25:01,360
It's basically iPhone territory which is just ludicrous.

435
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:02,360
But there we go.

436
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:08,020
But what makes it interesting to me I suppose apart from the aesthetics of it which do look

437
00:25:08,020 --> 00:25:16,460
nice is this modularity where it's got, well he described it as wireless USB-C or USB 3.

438
00:25:16,460 --> 00:25:20,900
Yeah he said it was a 60Hz USB 3.0 wireless chip.

439
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:26,220
Yeah and two metal contacts which are magnetic to provide power for things that need it.

440
00:25:26,220 --> 00:25:31,940
And the only accessory they've got now is this 360 degree camera which looks a bit,

441
00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:36,140
well you're going to look like a bit of a prat aren't you walking around with that strapped

442
00:25:36,140 --> 00:25:37,140
to your phone.

443
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:43,580
You could get some very small things like extra storage maybe, but again no headphone

444
00:25:43,580 --> 00:25:44,580
jack.

445
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:50,620
I mean he is trying to be Pixel, iPhone, he's trying to go in at the top of the market.

446
00:25:50,620 --> 00:25:57,420
In fact he tries to use his new market advantage to say this is what gives us our edge because

447
00:25:57,420 --> 00:26:02,220
he says because we don't have large scale we can do things at manufacturing that are

448
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:07,620
so new that the bigger guys can't do at their large scale so we can do nanotubes and we

449
00:26:07,620 --> 00:26:14,340
can do things that are really unique that only work at 100,000 devices and we'll then

450
00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:18,280
just scale up the manufacturing as our sales scale up and we'll be able to stay more competitive

451
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:19,280
that way.

452
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:24,820
But he's totally failing to acknowledge the reality that every other smartphone OS and

453
00:26:24,820 --> 00:26:28,180
every other smartphone manufacturer and every other smartphone player has to face.

454
00:26:28,180 --> 00:26:31,840
It doesn't matter if he's running stock Android or if they somehow decided to port

455
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:35,260
Ambient OS to the phone one day, which he doesn't think they'll ever do.

456
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:37,060
He thinks it's perfectly fine running Android.

457
00:26:37,060 --> 00:26:38,060
He probably would.

458
00:26:38,060 --> 00:26:40,060
He helped create it.

459
00:26:40,060 --> 00:26:42,060
What is the end goal here?

460
00:26:42,060 --> 00:26:43,060
What are you going after?

461
00:26:43,060 --> 00:26:45,420
You're going after the Pixel which barely sells?

462
00:26:45,420 --> 00:26:48,400
You really have to be going after the Samsung S8 I would think.

463
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:52,540
Which is just not going to happen without serious carrier support.

464
00:26:52,540 --> 00:26:57,100
And this is the same thing we've watched Canonical go through, the same thing we watched Mozilla

465
00:26:57,100 --> 00:26:58,820
go through.

466
00:26:58,820 --> 00:27:00,280
This is not a new story.

467
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:03,700
And it would be interesting to see if Andy is successful here.

468
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:05,460
Or because this will be telling.

469
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:10,560
If he's able to find a niche and he's able to push forward with an ecosystem of accessories

470
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:15,620
that magnetically snap on, home assistance that compete with the Echo and a phone that

471
00:27:15,620 --> 00:27:17,180
competes with the Pixel.

472
00:27:17,180 --> 00:27:20,220
And he seems like he's got some good ideas behind him.

473
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:21,660
He's all about publishing the specs.

474
00:27:21,660 --> 00:27:25,620
So they're going to publish the spec of the wireless USB and the magnetic connector.

475
00:27:25,620 --> 00:27:29,100
They're going to work to try to make as much of this stuff open as possible like their

476
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:30,500
ambient OS.

477
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:34,020
If I was going to buy an Android phone I might want to buy a phone from a company that has

478
00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:35,020
his philosophies.

479
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:38,940
That seems appealing to me but it still seems like such a long haul.

480
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:40,620
And they're already under a little bit of fire.

481
00:27:40,620 --> 00:27:44,980
Well you know I've mentioned this already but you're talking about taking on Samsung

482
00:27:44,980 --> 00:27:46,360
or even Google.

483
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:49,620
To me I don't think that's what the play is with the phone.

484
00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:51,100
To me it's very straightforward.

485
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:52,820
It's an attack on OnePlus.

486
00:27:52,820 --> 00:27:57,340
Because OnePlus became successful with no advertising, just word of mouth.

487
00:27:57,340 --> 00:28:01,120
Because they had a high spec phone for a very low price.

488
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:06,740
And it was running Cyanogen OS which was essentially stock Android with a couple of tweaks.

489
00:28:06,740 --> 00:28:10,180
And then they fell out with them and now they've got Oxygen OS which apparently is quite good.

490
00:28:10,180 --> 00:28:11,180
I don't know.

491
00:28:11,180 --> 00:28:12,540
I haven't run it for a long, long time.

492
00:28:12,540 --> 00:28:17,460
Is it an attack or is it just a step aside kids and let the adults show you how we do

493
00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:18,460
this?

494
00:28:18,460 --> 00:28:19,460
Oh yeah okay.

495
00:28:19,460 --> 00:28:20,460
Attack is the wrong word.

496
00:28:20,460 --> 00:28:21,460
A market attack.

497
00:28:21,460 --> 00:28:22,460
They're not going to bad mouth them or anything like that.

498
00:28:22,460 --> 00:28:26,260
But they're going to try and sell as an American company.

499
00:28:26,260 --> 00:28:30,420
I'm sure it's all going to be made in the Far East but rather than being a Chinese company.

500
00:28:30,420 --> 00:28:36,340
Now I'm not trying to be anti-American here but I think the reality is that a lot of Americans

501
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:38,780
would rather buy an American phone than a Chinese one.

502
00:28:38,780 --> 00:28:42,380
I would generally agree with you however it doesn't seem to have changed the market at

503
00:28:42,380 --> 00:28:49,340
all because unless I'm mistaken, and I probably am, isn't the only phone, there's no phone

504
00:28:49,340 --> 00:28:50,820
manufactured in the States right?

505
00:28:50,820 --> 00:28:53,500
I can't think of any phone that's manufactured in the States anymore.

506
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:56,980
Yeah I wouldn't have thought so but if you're going to buy an iPhone then it's designed

507
00:28:56,980 --> 00:28:57,980
in California.

508
00:28:57,980 --> 00:29:00,260
Right, at least it's owned by an American company.

509
00:29:00,260 --> 00:29:01,260
Yeah exactly.

510
00:29:01,260 --> 00:29:02,260
I suppose so.

511
00:29:02,260 --> 00:29:03,580
And this is an American company.

512
00:29:03,580 --> 00:29:05,020
Yeah that's true.

513
00:29:05,020 --> 00:29:09,500
I think, and this is wild speculation, I think that they're going to basically try and go

514
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:16,380
after the OnePlus kind of market for people who want stock Android and no bloat on their

515
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:21,740
phone or whatever and that is going to finance Ambient OS and this home device of theirs.

516
00:29:21,740 --> 00:29:26,820
I think that that is the real play here because phones, I mean as he said in this interview

517
00:29:26,820 --> 00:29:32,980
with Walt, phones are kind of yesterday's news really that they've already, that market

518
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:40,060
saturated and assistance and AI and machine learning and all that stuff is the new hotness

519
00:29:40,060 --> 00:29:45,060
and so he's trying to get into that but that is a very expensive and complicated world

520
00:29:45,060 --> 00:29:51,220
and industry to get into as Mycroft have found out and although he has got quite a lot of

521
00:29:51,220 --> 00:29:58,620
VC funding behind him to actually establish the brand and shift some units of something

522
00:29:58,620 --> 00:30:04,900
even if it's just a phone might convince them to invest more and might build the brand and

523
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:12,020
so that to me seems to be the end goal of his is to get this home, this Echo competitor

524
00:30:12,020 --> 00:30:20,340
to be a mainstream device which is lofty ambition and okay he did create Android but not as

525
00:30:20,340 --> 00:30:21,340
we know it now.

526
00:30:21,340 --> 00:30:25,220
If you look at what he created it was pretty terrible wasn't it compared to what we've

527
00:30:25,220 --> 00:30:26,220
got now.

528
00:30:26,220 --> 00:30:29,940
Yeah and some of the deals that he created to make the operating system successful I

529
00:30:29,940 --> 00:30:33,620
think are why we are where we are at with Android.

530
00:30:33,620 --> 00:30:41,520
So he's clearly a sharp businessman and he can present pretty well on stage and in public.

531
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:45,460
So Joe is the thing to take away from this that the lady in the tube is the next big

532
00:30:45,460 --> 00:30:48,820
market that's 2018's big competitive market?

533
00:30:48,820 --> 00:30:53,460
No the thing to take away from this is that the big tech companies think that the lady

534
00:30:53,460 --> 00:30:54,580
in the tube is the next thing.

535
00:30:54,580 --> 00:30:58,180
They all want more information and they think the lady in the tube is the next best way

536
00:30:58,180 --> 00:30:59,180
to get that information.

537
00:30:59,180 --> 00:31:04,060
Well the same way they thought that wearables were the next big thing and that has just

538
00:31:04,060 --> 00:31:05,780
not happened has it?

539
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:12,360
I've got one and I wear my watch all the time and it's found a niche market but unlike with

540
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:17,200
phones and then tablets which again are declining now they have tried to create this market

541
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:21,980
and they've pushed really hard with it but how many people have bought an Echo or an

542
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:27,940
Echo Dot and been enthusiastic asking it the weather for a few weeks, a few months and

543
00:31:27,940 --> 00:31:31,740
then eventually they get annoyed with it and either forget that it's there listening to

544
00:31:31,740 --> 00:31:35,820
them all the time or just unplug it and stick it in a cupboard and definitely don't buy

545
00:31:35,820 --> 00:31:38,220
the new version of it.

546
00:31:38,220 --> 00:31:43,100
Maybe I'm being cynical here but for me it's what they think is the next big thing because

547
00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:47,860
they can't sell any more phones to people because phones have got good enough now why

548
00:31:47,860 --> 00:31:52,300
do I need a new one unless I drop it sort of thing.

549
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:54,020
Yeah you're probably right.

550
00:31:54,020 --> 00:31:58,900
I find mine to be pretty useful and I've stuck to it so I think if you get the right use

551
00:31:58,900 --> 00:32:00,780
cases they can be.

552
00:32:00,780 --> 00:32:06,020
Your use case is niche man like running a studio with it okay that's very very niche

553
00:32:06,020 --> 00:32:10,500
and I'm sure people will find uses in an industry and stuff but it's not going to be this mass

554
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:12,900
consumer device I don't think.

555
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:13,900
I think you're right.

556
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:18,060
I would say it's going to be much more successful in industries and that's huge that's a huge

557
00:32:18,060 --> 00:32:24,540
market this probably shouldn't be underestimated but I kind of think that a lot of this smart

558
00:32:24,540 --> 00:32:28,340
control stuff is going to start getting baked in over the years so you won't have to get

559
00:32:28,340 --> 00:32:33,860
a $25 AC outlet that has a Wi-Fi chip in it that then your Echo uses it'll just start

560
00:32:33,860 --> 00:32:37,820
getting baked into the TVs and the lamps and the light bulbs and then it's nice to have

561
00:32:37,820 --> 00:32:41,300
one thing instead of having to have five or six different apps to turn these things on

562
00:32:41,300 --> 00:32:42,300
and off.

563
00:32:42,300 --> 00:32:45,660
Unless you've tried it I know it sounds crazy so I'm going to shut up right now about it

564
00:32:45,660 --> 00:32:49,460
because I know it sounds ridiculous I thought it was ridiculous you know what I think is

565
00:32:49,460 --> 00:32:54,900
ridiculous that an accessories manufacturer is trying to stop Andy Rubin's attempt before

566
00:32:54,900 --> 00:32:58,740
they even get off the ground and launch a single product.

567
00:32:58,740 --> 00:33:04,700
Yeah I mean this is just someone wanting a paycheck isn't it at the end of the day.

568
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:09,860
Spigen I think is the company they make some phone cases and stuff and one of their brands

569
00:33:09,860 --> 00:33:15,540
is essential it's such a generic word that even if they do win or settle out of court

570
00:33:15,540 --> 00:33:22,180
it's only going to be a couple hundred thousand dollars maybe or maybe a tiny like one cent

571
00:33:22,180 --> 00:33:26,860
on every device sold which might add up for them and so fair play to them but I don't

572
00:33:26,860 --> 00:33:29,340
think it's going to stop Andy doing what he wants to do.

573
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:33,500
Andy wants us all to call it the essential phone you see how he did that essential yeah

574
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:37,260
that's clever that's clever we'll see if it goes anywhere though.

575
00:33:37,260 --> 00:33:40,300
Yeah it's definitely one to watch and there's been a lot of hype about it so we couldn't

576
00:33:40,300 --> 00:33:44,620
ignore it but yeah and ambient OS could be another Linux based OS that could be open

577
00:33:44,620 --> 00:33:47,740
source so that's something else to keep an eye out for too yeah definitely.

578
00:33:47,740 --> 00:33:51,260
