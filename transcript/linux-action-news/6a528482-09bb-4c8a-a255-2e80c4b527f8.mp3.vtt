00:00.000 --> 00:05.480
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News.

00:05.480 --> 00:10.980
Episode 228, recorded on February 16th, 2022, I'm Chris.

00:10.980 --> 00:11.980
And I'm Wes.

00:11.980 --> 00:12.980
Hello, Wes.

00:12.980 --> 00:14.880
Let's do the news.

00:14.880 --> 00:20.640
We start this week by keeping a close eye on the last-minute DECK developments.

00:20.640 --> 00:23.200
And the software that powers it, of course.

00:23.200 --> 00:30.520
That's because as we record right now, we're just mere weeks away from the official release.

00:30.520 --> 00:36.520
So that does make it rather noteworthy that a major version of Proton has just now been

00:36.520 --> 00:37.520
released.

00:37.520 --> 00:41.720
I mean, that's the big compatibility layer that makes running Windows games possible

00:41.720 --> 00:43.480
on the DECK.

00:43.480 --> 00:45.740
It's a critical component for the DECK.

00:45.740 --> 00:47.940
It's a big part of their strategy.

00:47.940 --> 00:55.360
And Proton 7.0, which is just released, pulls in Wine 7.0, which was a major release on

00:55.360 --> 00:56.360
its own.

00:56.360 --> 01:01.520
I mean, amongst a lot of other things, we get improved support for DirectX 9 through

01:01.520 --> 01:02.520
12.

01:02.520 --> 01:04.880
That's massive for the DECK.

01:04.880 --> 01:08.320
Even more exciting, though, is support for Easy Anti-Cheat.

01:08.320 --> 01:13.040
Well, okay, at least of the game in question is enabled the Linux module.

01:13.040 --> 01:16.320
But hey, it's possible at all now.

01:16.320 --> 01:21.560
Also worth remarking on here is that the development team, well, they seem pretty darn pleased

01:21.560 --> 01:25.000
with this release, and I think rightfully so.

01:25.000 --> 01:31.480
But the real question is, Chris, do you think you'll actually have Proton 7 when you get

01:31.480 --> 01:32.480
your DECK?

01:32.480 --> 01:36.240
Or are you going to have to update right out of the box?

01:36.240 --> 01:38.440
Are those images already baked?

01:38.440 --> 01:42.400
Stay tuned and find out.

01:42.400 --> 01:48.080
Good news for those of you out there still racking and stacking, Gigabyte and Canonical

01:48.080 --> 01:54.880
announced they'll be working together to certify Gigabyte server hardware for Ubuntu.

01:54.880 --> 01:59.560
Now Gigabyte has already advertised Ubuntu Linux support on various workstations and

01:59.560 --> 02:05.800
server motherboards because, well, of course Linux runs on that hardware, but they'll now

02:05.800 --> 02:11.280
be moving forward with obtaining official certification from Canonical.

02:11.280 --> 02:16.720
As part of that certification process, they'll be ensuring Gigabyte servers work on the two

02:16.720 --> 02:22.160
most recent Ubuntu LTS versions, as well as making sure things work with Canonical's Metal

02:22.160 --> 02:23.160
as a service.

02:23.160 --> 02:28.040
Yeah, so it's not really clear here if all of Gigabyte server products are going to get

02:28.040 --> 02:32.960
the certification treatment, but here's how you'll tell.

02:32.960 --> 02:38.280
In the near future, you'll be able to find a section on Canonical's website that'll have

02:38.280 --> 02:43.160
the Gigabyte certified servers listed, where you'll be able to just click a link and purchase

02:43.160 --> 02:44.160
them.

02:44.160 --> 02:48.760
So the models that do get certified by Canonical will be easy to find on Canonical's website,

02:48.760 --> 02:49.760
so that works.

02:49.760 --> 02:56.980
And this is really great to see, ASUS, Dell, Fujitsu, IBM, Huawei, Lenovo, and others.

02:56.980 --> 03:01.160
They have done this in the past, so it's nice to have one more added to this list.

03:01.160 --> 03:05.240
And also, if you're in Barcelona and you're going to Mobile World Congress 2022, Canonical

03:05.240 --> 03:06.240
will be there.

03:06.240 --> 03:09.600
They're going to demonstrate how to manage and operate distributed compute pools with

03:09.600 --> 03:11.680
their open source solution.

03:11.680 --> 03:14.800
And they have been going regularly since the Ubuntu Phone project.

03:14.800 --> 03:19.160
In fact, the mobile industry kind of represents a decent portion of their client base, and

03:19.160 --> 03:25.600
it made me realize looking at this, the fact that they're still going, I don't think that

03:25.600 --> 03:28.560
time they spent on the Ubuntu Phone was necessarily wasted.

03:28.560 --> 03:35.800
I think they invested in an industry that is continuing to pay dividends.

03:35.800 --> 03:41.960
We've got a couple exciting updates that will be coming to a kernel near you pretty soon.

03:41.960 --> 03:47.680
Let's start with our future workstation file system, at least we hope, BcacheFS.

03:47.680 --> 03:54.320
BcacheFS has been in development since the mid-2010s, having evolved from the Bcache

03:54.320 --> 03:58.440
module, which provides a block cache layer for the Linux kernel.

03:58.440 --> 04:02.240
It aims for speed, while also having ButterFS-like features.

04:02.240 --> 04:07.560
Say, for instance, snapshots, which were added fairly recently to the project.

04:07.560 --> 04:13.040
It's been under pretty heavy development lately, which hasn't left a ton of time for project

04:13.040 --> 04:14.040
updates.

04:14.040 --> 04:20.400
But, this week, lead developer Kent Overstreet provided one of those, with a new posting

04:20.400 --> 04:23.120
on the Linux kernel mailing list.

04:23.120 --> 04:28.280
We'll have the full post linked if you're curious, but while we're speaking of snapshots,

04:28.280 --> 04:33.400
he noted that, quote, I'm particularly proud of how snapshots turned out.

04:33.400 --> 04:39.000
It's roughly a versioned B-tree approach, and it's scalable and fast.

04:39.000 --> 04:44.160
He also noted some nice consequences of that design, things like the file system repair

04:44.160 --> 04:45.160
time.

04:45.160 --> 04:49.040
Well, that doesn't depend on the number of snapshots, so it sounds like we can kind of

04:49.040 --> 04:52.000
go crazy with them.

04:52.000 --> 04:53.000
Snapshot with abandon!

04:53.000 --> 04:57.960
He said that he had a VM that he had loaded up with a million snapshots, and performance

04:57.960 --> 04:59.800
was still just fine.

04:59.800 --> 05:05.160
He also recently noted, quote, things are in flux lately with all the allocator work,

05:05.160 --> 05:08.760
but I'm hoping that once that settles down, and I've worked through the backlog of bug

05:08.760 --> 05:17.440
reports and performance regressions, we might be ready for upstreaming sometime this year.

05:17.440 --> 05:22.720
One more kernel update to look forward to, it seems that long-time Linux kernel developer

05:22.720 --> 05:29.040
Jens Axbo is known for his IOMastery, maintaining the block subsystem, and developing features

05:29.040 --> 05:32.240
you hear about on this show like IOU ring.

05:32.240 --> 05:38.520
Well, recently, he picked up an Apple MacBook Pro with an M1 Pro inside, and jumped into

05:38.520 --> 05:41.640
the nascent M1 Linux community.

05:41.640 --> 05:48.560
After just a few days of tinkering, Axbo shared last week that he was, quote, very impressed

05:48.560 --> 05:54.760
by the hardware, and has begun dabbling with CPU frequency tuning support for the Apple

05:54.760 --> 05:59.840
M1, an effort that was started by Asahi Linux developer Hector Martin.

05:59.840 --> 06:25.600
Hey, maybe by this time next year, I'll be running BcashFS on my M1 running Linux.

06:25.600 --> 06:29.960
And a huge congratulations to everyone for the big news, Linode has been acquired by

06:29.960 --> 06:35.280
Akamai, and that's 19 years of hard work that's getting paid off, and you could really see,

06:35.280 --> 06:39.360
as they would put it, the synergy there with that acquisition.

06:39.360 --> 06:41.200
Go try it out right now.

06:41.200 --> 06:44.120
Maybe you want to build something yourself, maybe you want to take advantage of one of

06:44.120 --> 06:50.160
their one-click deployments, and their super fast systems, their S3 compatible object storage,

06:50.160 --> 06:55.080
their totally metal boxes if you like to go old school, they got it all.

06:55.080 --> 07:01.040
And they got a great interface, and the absolute best customer support in the business.

07:01.040 --> 07:06.280
From the support, to the super fast rigs, to the Linux culture that runs deep, I mean,

07:06.280 --> 07:07.920
that's something I know about Linode.

07:07.920 --> 07:11.400
I know they have a culture that's strong, and that runs deep.

07:11.400 --> 07:15.480
There's a lot of reasons why I choose Linode, but you may come up with your own set of reasons.

07:15.480 --> 07:19.160
So go try it yourself and get that experience, and go get that $100.

07:19.160 --> 07:24.320
Go to linode.com slash LAN.

07:24.320 --> 07:27.000
And a big thank you to Ting, linux.ting.com.

07:27.000 --> 07:31.200
If you're sick of overpaying for cell service, go see how much you could save, and then take

07:31.200 --> 07:34.320
25 bucks off that at linux.ting.com.

07:34.320 --> 07:38.120
One of the things I hear all the time from my friends outside the US is Ting does mobile

07:38.120 --> 07:40.600
how the rest of the world had to do it.

07:40.600 --> 07:44.700
They came into mobile a little bit later than we did in the States, and we got these big

07:44.700 --> 07:46.460
duopoly set up.

07:46.460 --> 07:50.160
But in other parts of the world, the carriers actually have to be competitive with each

07:50.160 --> 07:55.920
other, and they actually have to compete on things like value and customer service.

07:55.920 --> 07:59.200
That's Ting, and that's what makes Ting great in the States.

07:59.200 --> 08:01.440
They're a mobile virtual network operator.

08:01.440 --> 08:08.200
They ride on top of those big coast-to-coast networks, but you interface with Ting, who's

08:08.200 --> 08:13.280
nimble, who has great customer support, a fantastic deal, like seriously, they got a

08:13.280 --> 08:16.680
plan for everybody, and no contracts ever.

08:16.680 --> 08:20.800
I've been a customer since 2013, so I can tell you Ting is great.

08:20.800 --> 08:25.520
I've stuck with them for the long haul, because it's just a smarter way to do mobile.

08:25.520 --> 08:28.760
Every Ting plan gets access to their award-winning customer support.

08:28.760 --> 08:32.760
In fact, Ting mobile was just recently named the number one carrier by Consumer Reports

08:32.760 --> 08:33.760
in 2021.

08:33.760 --> 08:36.160
You never have to worry about a contract.

08:36.160 --> 08:38.000
It's super easy to get started.

08:38.000 --> 08:41.040
Their website makes it really quick and fast and straightforward.

08:41.040 --> 08:45.380
So go to linux.ting.com, check your current phone, create an account, and pick the plan

08:45.380 --> 08:47.160
that's right for you.

08:47.160 --> 08:48.600
Ting will send you a SIM card.

08:48.600 --> 08:53.120
You pop that sucker into your phone, and guess what, you're going to get activated in minutes.

08:53.120 --> 08:54.600
It can be in the middle of the night.

08:54.600 --> 08:58.820
Everyone's asleep in your house, and you're getting everybody set up on better, smarter

08:58.820 --> 08:59.820
mobile service.

08:59.820 --> 09:00.820
That's what I did.

09:00.820 --> 09:07.520
That's what you can do, linux.ting.com.

09:07.520 --> 09:15.320
We saved our last story for one we've been waiting for since episode 168, way back on

09:15.320 --> 09:19.680
December 20th, 2020.

09:19.680 --> 09:25.680
As you might recall, if you can remember back that far, that's when Google acquired Neverware,

09:25.680 --> 09:32.160
a company whose product made it possible to run Chrome OS on regular PCs.

09:32.160 --> 09:40.360
Well, on Tuesday, Google announced its plans to release Chrome OS Flex, a product designed

09:40.360 --> 09:47.960
to run on PCs and Macs as old as about 13 years.

09:47.960 --> 09:54.800
What's really new about all this is probably just that running Chrome OS on non-Chromebook

09:54.800 --> 09:59.400
hardware is now officially sanctioned by Google.

09:59.400 --> 10:05.540
But before you get too excited, you should know that as of now, Chrome OS Flex does still

10:05.540 --> 10:14.560
have some limitations, most significantly perhaps, Flex can't yet run Android applications.

10:14.560 --> 10:20.240
But if you don't care about that, well, it's available right now as quote, early access.

10:20.240 --> 10:23.200
So do set your expectations accordingly.

10:23.200 --> 10:29.840
It probably won't be as stable as the full blown release coming in hopefully a few months.

10:29.840 --> 10:35.200
Yeah, and with 13 years of general hardware support, you got a good shot here.

10:35.200 --> 10:42.000
You need four gigs of RAM, you need an x86 64-bit CPU and a modest 16 gigs of disk.

10:42.000 --> 10:45.600
There are some systems in the last 13 years that have come out, like specifically some

10:45.600 --> 10:47.720
Atom boxes that are not supported.

10:47.720 --> 10:51.080
That's all on Google's website here.

10:51.080 --> 10:56.960
And Google does say, quote, components made before 2010 might result in a poor experience.

10:56.960 --> 10:59.400
So you have that as well.

10:59.400 --> 11:02.640
But you know, really, I think if you're going to want to get the best Google experience

11:02.640 --> 11:06.840
and you know, if you're going to use this in an institution, you actually want hardware

11:06.840 --> 11:11.560
and software support, you're ultimately going to still want to get something that's actually

11:11.560 --> 11:15.080
been certified by Google, which at that point, you might as well get a Chromebook.

11:15.080 --> 11:17.560
But I mean, I could see other reasons why you might not.

11:17.560 --> 11:22.480
And Google is going to have a list of certified hardware models that they're going to test,

11:22.480 --> 11:25.000
they're going to troubleshoot and they're going to optimize for and then they're going

11:25.000 --> 11:28.360
to supposedly make it easy for you to find on their website.

11:28.360 --> 11:31.720
But what I find fascinating about this is it seems like because if you look at their

11:31.720 --> 11:35.840
specific BIOS support, they've they've made it really flexible.

11:35.840 --> 11:36.840
Ha ha.

11:36.840 --> 11:42.000
I just got maybe that's why they called it Chrome OS Flex, but they've made the BIOS

11:42.000 --> 11:44.440
support really clever and flexible.

11:44.440 --> 11:50.240
And so it's possible and people are speculating that you could install this on Chromebooks

11:50.240 --> 11:54.560
that are past their built in expiration date that are no longer supported.

11:54.560 --> 12:00.000
You could come along and put Chrome OS Flex on them and get a whole new life out of the

12:00.000 --> 12:01.560
box potentially.

12:01.560 --> 12:02.560
So we'll see.

12:02.560 --> 12:03.560
We'll see.

12:03.560 --> 12:06.920
But it does seem like we've been waiting for this one a little bit longer than we expected.

12:06.920 --> 12:11.280
I think you and I both thought this would probably be announced in 2021.

12:11.280 --> 12:13.360
Yeah, definitely.

12:13.360 --> 12:19.440
It is still nice to see now, though, you know, we hem and haw about how we feel about Chrome

12:19.440 --> 12:20.440
OS.

12:20.440 --> 12:21.440
Does it count as desktop Linux?

12:21.440 --> 12:23.040
Does it make us uncomfortable?

12:23.040 --> 12:27.640
But having an official version that you can just run on any old hardware, well, makes

12:27.640 --> 12:31.240
it a little more approachable, at least to me.

12:31.240 --> 12:36.980
And I imagine it might make it easier to use for schools that didn't already buy into the

12:36.980 --> 12:38.760
whole Chromebook paradigm, right?

12:38.760 --> 12:40.720
They've already got some hardware out there.

12:40.720 --> 12:47.240
Yeah, and I think it's good anytime you can make it possible to easily reuse old hardware.

12:47.240 --> 12:53.840
You know, why throw a PC out that's less than 13 years old and still works if you're at

12:53.840 --> 12:56.160
a school or an institution?

12:56.160 --> 12:59.240
If you know, I mean, a lot of us just need a web browser now.

12:59.240 --> 13:00.240
That's just it.

13:00.240 --> 13:02.400
Yeah, and I like it for that as well.

13:02.400 --> 13:09.080
I think also the messaging around that has been interesting.

13:09.080 --> 13:13.800
Google's kind of low key, making sure everyone understands that they've designed this to

13:13.800 --> 13:16.000
also work on MacBooks.

13:16.000 --> 13:22.500
I find that fascinating and perhaps appropriately timed because you're going to have organizations

13:22.500 --> 13:23.920
and groups.

13:23.920 --> 13:28.240
They're going to transition to the M1 or the Apple Silicon architecture and leave their

13:28.240 --> 13:30.460
old Intel machines behind.

13:30.460 --> 13:35.080
This could be one more thing you now do with those old Intel MacBooks, and I'm not thinking

13:35.080 --> 13:42.080
like the most recent Intel MacBooks, but I'm thinking, you know, like the 2015s, the 2013s,

13:42.080 --> 13:44.540
some of the older ones that are still perfectly good.

13:44.540 --> 13:46.600
Maybe you could try putting this on there.

13:46.600 --> 13:48.880
I will admit I'm pretty darn curious.

13:48.880 --> 13:53.680
I'm also kind of curious if they've done any custom work to make this work and install

13:53.680 --> 13:56.320
easily and well on Mac hardware.

13:56.320 --> 14:01.560
I mean, I know older Macs now tend to have some decent kernel support, but it can still

14:01.560 --> 14:02.560
be hit or miss.

14:02.560 --> 14:09.200
Yeah, and that trackpad, that trackpad and that Wi-Fi and that webcam, that can be very

14:09.200 --> 14:10.200
tricky.

14:10.200 --> 14:14.800
But back on the main PC side, what do you think, Wes?

14:14.800 --> 14:20.520
Does this mean that Google is now shipping a general PC Linux distro?

14:20.520 --> 14:25.400
I mean, you can run it on just about any hardware now.

14:25.400 --> 14:30.440
And you can run regular desktop Linux apps on it.

14:30.440 --> 14:34.800
Yeah, and it's definitely more Linux than Android, that's for sure.

14:34.800 --> 14:38.520
Yeah, I think I have to say, yes.

14:38.520 --> 14:43.320
I mean, don't call it that and don't call it a PC maybe, but yeah, I mean, they've kind

14:43.320 --> 14:49.360
of come at this in the same way Apple or a similar way that Apple has with the iPad OS

14:49.360 --> 14:50.360
and rebuilding things up.

14:50.360 --> 14:53.800
You know, they started with a very limited set of things you could do with this computer,

14:53.800 --> 14:58.920
but at this point with Chrome OS, yeah, I think you have to say that it is.

14:58.920 --> 15:05.360
Right, and in so many ways, Chrome OS is a more sensible architecture than Android.

15:05.360 --> 15:09.800
And you know, you could see how you could eek more performance out of Chrome OS too.

15:09.800 --> 15:13.200
We'll sit here and try to figure out what to call it and we'll let you know.

15:13.200 --> 15:14.840
