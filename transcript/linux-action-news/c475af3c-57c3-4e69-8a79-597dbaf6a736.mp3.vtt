00:00.000 --> 00:05.360
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News.

00:05.360 --> 00:08.960
Episode 139, recorded on December 20, 2019.

00:08.960 --> 00:09.960
I'm Chris.

00:09.960 --> 00:10.960
And I'm Joe.

00:10.960 --> 00:11.960
Hello, Joe.

00:11.960 --> 00:13.720
It's finally here.

00:13.720 --> 00:18.560
I feel like I've been waiting all year for our annual predictions episode.

00:18.560 --> 00:24.840
So this week, we own up to our past predictions, see how we did, and then, of course, make

00:24.840 --> 00:26.960
some flawless predictions for 2020.

00:26.960 --> 00:30.120
I'm actually pretty confident about my predictions this year.

00:30.120 --> 00:31.600
Yeah, I'm feeling kind of good, too.

00:31.600 --> 00:37.360
I feel like I brought my A game to these predictions, although I probably felt that way last year,

00:37.360 --> 00:39.040
if you think about it.

00:39.040 --> 00:44.360
Well, I certainly felt that way when I said that Microsoft would buy at least a significant

00:44.360 --> 00:49.600
percentage share in Canonical, which has not happened.

00:49.600 --> 00:52.960
Although I did say at the time, they're a private company, so it could happen and we

00:52.960 --> 00:54.440
wouldn't find out about it.

00:54.440 --> 00:58.160
But let's face it, we would have heard somehow.

00:58.160 --> 00:59.200
But yeah, that didn't happen.

00:59.200 --> 01:04.660
But the reason that I said it at the time was because they were starting to cozy up.

01:04.660 --> 01:10.720
And like we talked about last week on the Review of the Year episode, they have become

01:10.720 --> 01:14.340
increasingly tightly entwined.

01:14.340 --> 01:18.320
You only have to look at the Windows subsystem for Linux stuff.

01:18.320 --> 01:23.520
Canonical have even hired Hayden Barnes, who is really invested in WSL.

01:23.520 --> 01:26.000
That partnership seems to be getting tighter.

01:26.000 --> 01:27.640
And so I thought we were going to see it.

01:27.640 --> 01:33.600
I thought Microsoft were going to invest in Canonical and maybe even buy them outright

01:33.600 --> 01:35.800
and stop this IPO from happening.

01:35.800 --> 01:41.760
I saw a lot of others in the community echo a prediction like this or similar to this.

01:41.760 --> 01:47.940
There was just a sense in the room that this could be potentially happening.

01:47.940 --> 01:52.060
Maybe there were conversations, but it didn't pan out.

01:52.060 --> 01:56.760
So I think we have to say good old negative on that one there, Joe.

01:56.760 --> 01:58.720
Yeah, unfortunately, we do.

01:58.720 --> 02:03.200
I would predict something about that again for this year.

02:03.200 --> 02:05.680
But I didn't want to be boring.

02:05.680 --> 02:08.120
So I just did an unofficial one last week.

02:08.120 --> 02:09.720
I can't believe I lost my prediction.

02:09.720 --> 02:12.400
I already know it didn't pan out.

02:12.400 --> 02:18.020
But I predicted that Apple would launch a video streaming service that would not work

02:18.020 --> 02:19.680
on Linux.

02:19.680 --> 02:23.640
At the time of this prediction, it seemed like an Apple video streaming service was

02:23.640 --> 02:25.360
likely a lock.

02:25.360 --> 02:30.360
There had been no official announcements, but there had been rumors of Apple shopping

02:30.360 --> 02:34.280
around in Hollywood and doing hires and things like that.

02:34.280 --> 02:37.000
So I thought, OK, pretty good chance this is going to happen.

02:37.000 --> 02:40.980
But there's no way they'll launch it with a web service.

02:40.980 --> 02:45.160
And even if they did launch it with a web service, there's no way it would work under

02:45.160 --> 02:46.160
Linux.

02:46.160 --> 02:53.800
Well, what I didn't consider was that I indeed would have to sign up to test this because

02:53.800 --> 02:58.240
I haven't seen anybody report this.

02:58.240 --> 03:01.120
And I figured, you can't test it because I don't even know it's available where you're

03:01.120 --> 03:02.120
at.

03:02.120 --> 03:10.320
So I signed up and I got logged in and on my laptop, it failed to stream.

03:10.320 --> 03:11.320
It never worked.

03:11.320 --> 03:15.000
And I thought, oh, man, just narrowly missed it because I hit play.

03:15.000 --> 03:17.280
The player comes up, but then nothing ever happens.

03:17.280 --> 03:19.720
In fact, the whole page just becomes unresponsive.

03:19.720 --> 03:23.160
And I thought, oof, just missed that one.

03:23.160 --> 03:28.640
And then I got here to the studio and I thought, I better double check that on another computer.

03:28.640 --> 03:36.880
Fired up the same exact video from the Apple TV Plus website, hit play on my Linux desktop,

03:36.880 --> 03:39.240
and it started streaming immediately.

03:39.240 --> 03:42.400
So you were wrong then.

03:42.400 --> 03:43.400
It does work on Linux.

03:43.400 --> 03:45.160
What are the chances?

03:45.160 --> 03:46.160
What are the chances of that?

03:46.160 --> 03:48.000
I mean, this is Apple we're talking about.

03:48.000 --> 03:50.200
Presumably, that must have been Chrome, though.

03:50.200 --> 03:51.680
Yeah, it was Vivaldi.

03:51.680 --> 03:53.580
Yeah, yeah, absolutely.

03:53.580 --> 03:55.960
It was Vivaldi on the other machine, too, though.

03:55.960 --> 03:56.960
Same versions.

03:56.960 --> 03:57.960
One was on Fedora.

03:57.960 --> 03:58.960
One was on Manjaro.

03:58.960 --> 04:02.400
Well, I don't think it was an unreasonable prediction because we knew that this service

04:02.400 --> 04:03.400
was coming.

04:03.400 --> 04:06.480
I don't think you can even deny that.

04:06.480 --> 04:08.160
It was obvious.

04:08.160 --> 04:13.520
But if you remember, it wasn't that long ago that you couldn't watch the Apple Keynotes

04:13.520 --> 04:14.520
even.

04:14.520 --> 04:17.680
If you tried to do it on Linux, it would just say, hey, you need a different browser.

04:17.680 --> 04:20.640
And so I would be like, I'm not watching that then.

04:20.640 --> 04:22.240
That was my logic right there.

04:22.240 --> 04:23.740
That was it.

04:23.740 --> 04:28.280
And there really has been no reporting about Apple Plus on Linux.

04:28.280 --> 04:33.000
And if you recall, even in Linux headlines, we had reporting on Disney Plus not working

04:33.000 --> 04:36.720
on Linux before the service even launched in the States.

04:36.720 --> 04:39.160
And then it later was adjusted.

04:39.160 --> 04:43.400
The DRM was notched down or up, however that system works.

04:43.400 --> 04:47.240
And now Linux playback with Disney Plus is possible.

04:47.240 --> 04:48.960
And that was also reported on.

04:48.960 --> 04:52.560
But in the meantime, nothing about Apple Plus.

04:52.560 --> 04:55.000
I figured that meant, oh, good, it's not working.

04:55.000 --> 04:56.000
It must not be working.

04:56.000 --> 04:59.000
Otherwise, people would be saying, hey, look at this, it works.

04:59.000 --> 05:00.580
But it was slow.

05:00.580 --> 05:02.620
The experience wasn't very good.

05:02.620 --> 05:03.620
But it did stream.

05:03.620 --> 05:08.360
I suppose it's probably a case of the kind of people who would want to get it working

05:08.360 --> 05:14.200
on Linux wouldn't shout about it because they might be a bit embarrassed about paying Apple

05:14.200 --> 05:15.200
maybe.

05:15.200 --> 05:18.920
Yeah, I guess that could be true.

05:18.920 --> 05:19.920
I don't know.

05:19.920 --> 05:21.680
I kind of like that morning show with that Jennifer Aniston.

05:21.680 --> 05:26.760
Yeah, I hear good things about it, but I'm not signing up to Apple, so there's enough

05:26.760 --> 05:27.760
other content.

05:27.760 --> 05:28.760
Yeah.

05:28.760 --> 05:33.480
Yeah, I actually think the way it worked out is I got it for free with a device.

05:33.480 --> 05:35.280
So it was sort of perfect.

05:35.280 --> 05:39.200
But I think the way I did it is I get it for a year, and then in a year, they're going

05:39.200 --> 05:41.840
to start dinging me for the price if I forget to cancel it.

05:41.840 --> 05:43.800
Which you obviously will do.

05:43.800 --> 05:45.320
Of course I will.

05:45.320 --> 05:48.080
Your next prediction, pie in the sky.

05:48.080 --> 05:50.640
I would have loved to have seen this work out.

05:50.640 --> 05:54.400
Yeah, Steam Linux market share will crack 5%.

05:54.400 --> 05:59.000
It barely cracked 1%, so that was a massive fail.

05:59.000 --> 06:08.200
My reasoning was that the Epic store was going to take away enough of the Windows Steam market

06:08.200 --> 06:15.440
share to kind of by default raise the Linux market share, as well as Proton and everything

06:15.440 --> 06:17.000
raising it a little bit.

06:17.000 --> 06:19.000
And it was pie in the sky.

06:19.000 --> 06:21.600
I said 5% to be a real dreamer.

06:21.600 --> 06:24.600
I was thinking at least two or three, though.

06:24.600 --> 06:30.200
But to have remained stagnant at around about 1%, it's not great.

06:30.200 --> 06:32.620
Although it depends which way you look at it, right?

06:32.620 --> 06:37.320
Because the overall number of Steam users has gone up massively.

06:37.320 --> 06:42.360
And therefore the Linux users have gone up, but just not proportionally with the other

06:42.360 --> 06:43.360
platforms.

06:43.360 --> 06:44.460
I guess I can see the logic.

06:44.460 --> 06:50.440
If you were thinking the Epic store, amongst other things, would take users away from Steam,

06:50.440 --> 06:57.920
so the Windows user percentage would drop, and you combine Proton, I could see how that

06:57.920 --> 07:02.440
could have led to a boost, but it just didn't quite materialize.

07:02.440 --> 07:05.320
By all accounts, it remains to be a pretty small market share.

07:05.320 --> 07:06.320
A good one, though.

07:06.320 --> 07:09.000
I mean, I'm thrilled, but still pretty small.

07:09.000 --> 07:14.640
Yeah, I'm not going to make any predictions about that this year, because I just don't

07:14.640 --> 07:16.160
think it's going to change much, really.

07:16.160 --> 07:19.120
Well, I think I have made a prediction there.

07:19.120 --> 07:27.720
Okay, so my next one, maybe you could give it to me on a technicality, but I think I

07:27.720 --> 07:28.720
overshot.

07:28.720 --> 07:34.560
Office, as an Electron app, comes to Linux, likely just as a beta, or something available

07:34.560 --> 07:38.840
at Office 365 subs, but in a limited way is what I was thinking.

07:38.840 --> 07:43.060
Well, I think that we have to call this a win, because there's two ways you could possibly

07:43.060 --> 07:45.880
be half right, and two halves make a whole, right?

07:45.880 --> 07:54.920
So the first one is that we saw Teams come to Linux as an Electron app, and that is part

07:54.920 --> 07:55.920
of Office.

07:55.920 --> 07:56.920
Right.

07:56.920 --> 08:03.200
In fact, it was introduced as the first Office 365 app coming to Linux by Microsoft.

08:03.200 --> 08:04.200
Yeah.

08:04.200 --> 08:09.840
So I think even just that would qualify as a half point, and probably a win.

08:09.840 --> 08:16.800
But Hayden Barnes, who I mentioned, he has made an unofficial web app, Office Snap, which

08:16.800 --> 08:23.200
is just a web wrapper around Office 365, and isn't that what an Electron app essentially

08:23.200 --> 08:24.200
is?

08:24.200 --> 08:26.240
Kind of.

08:26.240 --> 08:28.600
So it's another half point, so two halves make a whole?

08:28.600 --> 08:29.600
Yeah.

08:29.600 --> 08:30.960
So I'm calling that a win, then.

08:30.960 --> 08:31.960
All right, I'll take it.

08:31.960 --> 08:32.960
I'll definitely take it.

08:32.960 --> 08:37.080
I think we'll probably see a lot more in 2020, but that's not an actual prediction, except

08:37.080 --> 08:39.680
for I think I just made it a prediction.

08:39.680 --> 08:42.360
You keep accidentally predicting things.

08:42.360 --> 08:44.880
I guess that means we should probably get into our 2020 predictions.

08:44.880 --> 08:46.520
Do you feel like going first?

08:46.520 --> 08:47.520
All right.

08:47.520 --> 08:54.560
So I think that in 2020, you'll be able to buy a RISC-V based single board computer that's

08:54.560 --> 09:00.840
capable of running a full Linux desktop, even if it's just XFCE or something like that with

09:00.840 --> 09:05.200
Debian, and it will cost no more than the most expensive Raspberry Pi.

09:05.200 --> 09:06.200
Okay.

09:06.200 --> 09:11.320
So are you talking like a small board with some IO on it that sort of looks familiar

09:11.320 --> 09:14.040
as a Raspberry Pi, or is this a full product?

09:14.040 --> 09:15.040
Is this in a case?

09:15.040 --> 09:16.040
Oh, no.

09:16.040 --> 09:19.840
I think we're talking something that looks very much like a Raspberry Pi that will probably

09:19.840 --> 09:25.160
have GPIO, and it'll have some sort of video out, whether that is HDMI or DisplayPort,

09:25.160 --> 09:26.160
something like that.

09:26.160 --> 09:30.580
It'll have USB ports, and you'll be able to run a full Linux desktop on it.

09:30.580 --> 09:35.760
I'm not saying that it's going to perform as well as a Raspberry Pi, but I think it'll

09:35.760 --> 09:40.000
be in and around about that price range of whatever the most expensive Raspberry Pi is

09:40.000 --> 09:45.160
at the time, which is this is kind of a double prediction that we may see a more expensive

09:45.160 --> 09:50.120
Raspberry Pi possibly with eight gigs of RAM or something like that, but it's going to

09:50.120 --> 09:53.800
be in that price range, in that affordable price range.

09:53.800 --> 09:58.200
It'll probably perform much more like a Raspberry Pi Zero, and it'll be very expensive for the

09:58.200 --> 10:03.520
performance that you'll get out of it, but I think that you will be able to run a full

10:03.520 --> 10:05.580
Linux desktop on a RISC-V board.

10:05.580 --> 10:08.520
That was going to be my next question is what you thought the performance would be like.

10:08.520 --> 10:10.560
I could see this.

10:10.560 --> 10:15.880
This is a little pie in the sky, but it's pie in the sky in a Joe way that I like.

10:15.880 --> 10:18.720
You've been rooting for something like this for a long time, so it'd be nice to see this

10:18.720 --> 10:23.400
really kind of come to fruition, and you're setting expectations pretty low with the Raspberry

10:23.400 --> 10:30.800
Pi Zero performance benchmark, so I mean, this really would be the next step to get

10:30.800 --> 10:35.480
application development for the RISC-V chip into gear.

10:35.480 --> 10:37.840
I think they should do this.

10:37.840 --> 10:38.840
Somebody should.

10:38.840 --> 10:41.040
Well, I think there is definitely a market for it.

10:41.040 --> 10:44.880
I don't know how big that market is, but I know that all of us would buy one if it's

10:44.880 --> 10:46.720
only the price of a Raspberry Pi 4.

10:46.720 --> 10:48.880
Yeah, I'd totally just check it out.

10:48.880 --> 10:51.360
Plus, you know future versions are going to get faster.

10:51.360 --> 10:52.360
Yeah, exactly.

10:52.360 --> 10:54.560
I also have a bit of a soft spot for RISC.

10:54.560 --> 10:55.560
All right.

10:55.560 --> 10:56.560
Well, that's a good one.

10:56.560 --> 10:57.560
So we shall see.

10:57.560 --> 11:02.160
Do you have a guess towards the end of 2020?

11:02.160 --> 11:05.200
Am I going to have this thing in the summer in my hands, or what do you think?

11:05.200 --> 11:08.760
I'm thinking it's going to be cold by the time you get this.

11:08.760 --> 11:09.760
All right.

11:09.760 --> 11:10.760
All right.

11:10.760 --> 11:11.760
Well, you know what?

11:11.760 --> 11:12.760
Give me something to do in the crappy weather.

11:12.760 --> 11:13.760
All right.

11:13.760 --> 11:18.000
Well, your old barber, Richard Stallman, is going to reemerge on the talk scene in 2020.

11:18.000 --> 11:23.560
He'll be in the talk circuit, not necessarily affiliated with any particular group.

11:23.560 --> 11:28.660
Now he's more like a mercenary for free software, going anywhere that will have him and speaking

11:28.660 --> 11:30.320
the good word of our freedoms.

11:30.320 --> 11:37.080
I don't think this is hugely unreasonable or unlikely, because he was doing a lot of

11:37.080 --> 11:41.880
traveling and talking before as part of his role at the FSF.

11:41.880 --> 11:45.880
And you kind of start to miss that, I would imagine, after a while.

11:45.880 --> 11:47.960
So you'll want to get back out there.

11:47.960 --> 11:50.560
And I know there's plenty of places that still would hear him talk.

11:50.560 --> 11:53.900
I mean, there are some that would be not interested at all.

11:53.900 --> 11:57.680
And there may be a bit of controversy if he goes anywhere.

11:57.680 --> 11:59.260
But I think people will book him.

11:59.260 --> 12:01.480
So yeah, I think this is pretty likely.

12:01.480 --> 12:09.520
Yeah, that's really the unknown is, are there places, talks, events, whatever, gatherings

12:09.520 --> 12:15.400
that are willing to A, pay whatever it would be to get him out there, and B, take the political

12:15.400 --> 12:16.400
risk of it?

12:16.400 --> 12:18.320
I wager yes.

12:18.320 --> 12:23.440
The reason why I put this down here is I don't think we've had a complete conversation around

12:23.440 --> 12:25.520
Richard Stallman and what happens next.

12:25.520 --> 12:29.960
I mean, maybe we just expect him all to retire and just quietly go away.

12:29.960 --> 12:34.360
But I don't see a man who's been living his entire life preaching one thing just all of

12:34.360 --> 12:35.360
a sudden stopping.

12:35.360 --> 12:39.760
It seems like he might wait for things to cool down, and then for friendly invites to

12:39.760 --> 12:41.000
come his way.

12:41.000 --> 12:42.000
That's my prediction.

12:42.000 --> 12:44.720
Sometime in 2020, we'll see him reemerge on the talk scene.

12:44.720 --> 12:51.120
I think we may well see him get booked and then subsequently no platformed at some places.

12:51.120 --> 12:54.440
And I think that we might well see some controversy about that.

12:54.440 --> 12:56.880
And it'll just reignite the whole thing.

12:56.880 --> 13:01.600
So yeah, I think it would be better if he did just retire.

13:01.600 --> 13:03.880
But you're right, he's not going to.

13:03.880 --> 13:08.480
Now we teased an AWS prediction last episode.

13:08.480 --> 13:09.760
So what do you got for us?

13:09.760 --> 13:15.560
Okay, by this time next year, there'll be a license that solves the AWS problem while

13:15.560 --> 13:17.640
still being open source.

13:17.640 --> 13:22.320
Now, if I knew the details of this, then I would be a much cleverer person.

13:22.320 --> 13:26.920
But I have faith that there is someone out there in the open source community that will

13:26.920 --> 13:28.840
find a solution to this problem.

13:28.840 --> 13:35.200
There will be a way to craft a license that is still open source and still meets the definition,

13:35.200 --> 13:39.880
but somehow stops the likes of Amazon and the other cloud providers from taking open

13:39.880 --> 13:45.400
source software and commercializing it and making money from it.

13:45.400 --> 13:50.080
I have no idea how that is possible, but it must be.

13:50.080 --> 13:53.880
And there must be someone in this community who's got the brains to do it.

13:53.880 --> 13:55.640
So you think it'll come from the community?

13:55.640 --> 13:56.640
Yes.

13:56.640 --> 14:01.280
I've been wondering if it won't come from AWS as a bit of a reaction to the backlash.

14:01.280 --> 14:03.800
They'll sit down and go, man, you know, we've got time and money.

14:03.800 --> 14:08.740
What we ought to do here is come up with a statement of how we contribute back.

14:08.740 --> 14:15.240
And we have a commitment of contribution to any projects that we utilize in the AWS infrastructure

14:15.240 --> 14:16.720
that we monetize.

14:16.720 --> 14:22.080
We have a commitment, like a code of giving back that we commit ourselves to for these

14:22.080 --> 14:23.080
projects.

14:23.080 --> 14:27.860
And maybe it's financially, maybe it's code, whatever it is, I think that solves it too.

14:27.860 --> 14:31.480
But it only solves it for one provider, I suppose, where something that's a license

14:31.480 --> 14:36.000
from within the community would solve it potentially across all cloud providers.

14:36.000 --> 14:37.320
It could do.

14:37.320 --> 14:42.800
Maybe one solution would be for AWS to add an option, like an optional fraction of a

14:42.800 --> 14:48.880
cent per hour or whatever, if you're using certain software, and then leave it up to

14:48.880 --> 14:49.880
the customers.

14:49.880 --> 14:51.600
Do they want to contribute?

14:51.600 --> 14:57.480
Or just set aside a tiny percentage per hour that gets used, and then just funnel that

14:57.480 --> 14:59.800
to the various open source projects.

14:59.800 --> 15:00.800
Hmm.

15:00.800 --> 15:04.040
The more we talk about this, Joe, the less likely it sounds.

15:04.040 --> 15:07.980
That sounds like you're adding additional costs to run cloud infrastructure and cutting

15:07.980 --> 15:10.080
costs is the name of the game there.

15:10.080 --> 15:11.280
Yeah, exactly.

15:11.280 --> 15:12.280
This is a tricky problem.

15:12.280 --> 15:17.840
And it's one that we've really seen up close and personal in 2019.

15:17.840 --> 15:19.840
I'm going to be watching to see if somebody solves this.

15:19.840 --> 15:20.840
I hope you're right.

15:20.840 --> 15:23.560
I hope we see a license that solves the quote unquote AWS problem.

15:23.560 --> 15:25.680
And if it does, that's how they'll be talking about it too.

15:25.680 --> 15:28.800
I don't have any clue how though.

15:28.800 --> 15:32.320
It seems like an unstoppable force meets an immovable object to me.

15:32.320 --> 15:33.320
Mm-hmm.

15:33.320 --> 15:34.320
It's fire meets fuel.

15:34.320 --> 15:35.320
Yeah.

15:35.320 --> 15:37.000
There just has to be a solution to this.

15:37.000 --> 15:38.000
Okay.

15:38.000 --> 15:39.000
You ready for mine?

15:39.000 --> 15:41.920
Now this one, it's sort of like my Apple TV prediction.

15:41.920 --> 15:44.780
There's rumors bubbling, but we don't have any commitments.

15:44.780 --> 15:51.720
We don't have any clarifications, but I'm getting the sense that Nvidia in 2020 via

15:51.720 --> 15:58.800
various types of support, be it code, documentation, developer time, et cetera, enables the Nuvoo

15:58.800 --> 16:04.400
driver to be fully functional for the majority of use cases with a few exceptions.

16:04.400 --> 16:06.160
I'm afraid I've never heard of that driver.

16:06.160 --> 16:07.640
Do you mean that Nuvo driver?

16:07.640 --> 16:08.640
Oh yeah.

16:08.640 --> 16:09.640
You know the Nuvo.

16:09.640 --> 16:10.640
All right.

16:10.640 --> 16:11.640
You finally got it right.

16:11.640 --> 16:12.640
Yeah.

16:12.640 --> 16:13.640
Yeah.

16:13.640 --> 16:14.640
Yeah.

16:14.640 --> 16:15.640
I think this could happen.

16:15.640 --> 16:20.240
I think they could look at what's happening with the AMD driver and they could say for

16:20.240 --> 16:24.960
the workstation case and for the gamer types, we're going to make this work.

16:24.960 --> 16:29.640
Now if you're going to do some sort of fancy XYZ workstation card or do some sort of high-end

16:29.640 --> 16:32.720
thing, you're going to need our special driver still.

16:32.720 --> 16:39.580
But for basic just install a vanilla distro and the Nvidia support is baked into the kernel

16:39.580 --> 16:43.520
and you can launch a game and you can play a Vulkan game.

16:43.520 --> 16:45.380
I think that's going to work in 2020.

16:45.380 --> 16:47.440
It might not be shipping in distros.

16:47.440 --> 16:51.200
You know, I don't know how far the code will be, but I think that's where we're going in

16:51.200 --> 16:52.200
2020.

16:52.200 --> 16:57.120
So you're talking about proper 3D acceleration and stuff, not just standard 2D stuff, which

16:57.120 --> 16:59.960
is there already on my desktop.

16:59.960 --> 17:04.320
That's kind of my media machine that's got a really, really low end Nvidia card in it.

17:04.320 --> 17:08.560
And that works perfectly without the binary driver, but I don't play any games on it.

17:08.560 --> 17:11.240
So you're saying that you will actually be able to play games here?

17:11.240 --> 17:12.680
Yeah, at least Vulkan games.

17:12.680 --> 17:18.280
Yeah, I think it's going to work just like with my AMD 580 I have upstairs.

17:18.280 --> 17:21.720
Just put that sucker in the old PCI slot, boot her up.

17:21.720 --> 17:22.960
The drivers baked right in.

17:22.960 --> 17:26.880
I launched Steam, start a game and I never had to install a single binary.

17:26.880 --> 17:29.080
Never had to do a dang thing.

17:29.080 --> 17:32.400
That'll be the experience ultimately with where Nvidia is going.

17:32.400 --> 17:36.280
Don't know if we're going to get to that point in 2020, but all of the groundwork, the code,

17:36.280 --> 17:39.980
the effort, all of that will start perhaps arch users or people that are on the edge

17:39.980 --> 17:43.200
and can maybe even build it and take advantage of it.

17:43.200 --> 17:45.080
But what about the machine learning stuff?

17:45.080 --> 17:46.840
You don't think that's going to be included?

17:46.840 --> 17:47.840
I don't know.

17:47.840 --> 17:49.160
I think there will be limits.

17:49.160 --> 17:50.920
I think there will be limits.

17:50.920 --> 17:56.520
Not sure where that line's at, mostly because I don't totally appreciate the difference

17:56.520 --> 18:00.540
between all the functional differences between Nvidia's ridiculously expensive enterprise

18:00.540 --> 18:02.640
cards and their consumer grade cards.

18:02.640 --> 18:05.320
But I definitely think there could be a line there, for example.

18:05.320 --> 18:07.400
And what other exceptions are we talking about then?

18:07.400 --> 18:08.400
I'm not sure.

18:08.400 --> 18:14.040
And the reason is, is I would not be surprised if this isn't even fully shipping to end users

18:14.040 --> 18:15.400
by the end of 2020.

18:15.400 --> 18:17.160
Something like this could take a long time.

18:17.160 --> 18:19.920
It really sort of depends on the state of that nouveau driver.

18:19.920 --> 18:22.820
Well, again, I think you're probably right.

18:22.820 --> 18:27.860
You've put enough caveats in this to get away with pretty much anything really, as long

18:27.860 --> 18:32.560
as you can play some sort of games with the nouveau driver.

18:32.560 --> 18:33.560
What about frame rates then?

18:33.560 --> 18:35.760
Are we talking comparable frame rates?

18:35.760 --> 18:40.240
Are we still talking that with the binary driver, it is going to be significantly better

18:40.240 --> 18:41.240
in terms of performance?

18:41.240 --> 18:43.920
Yeah, I think at binary equal performance, yeah.

18:43.920 --> 18:46.500
I'm thinking it's right there.

18:46.500 --> 18:48.320
It's binary equivalent.

18:48.320 --> 18:54.040
It's like all the stuff you need for a consumer grade, or even an enterprise workstation where

18:54.040 --> 18:59.000
you need some 3D acceleration, but maybe you're not doing CUDA stuff, or you're not doing

18:59.000 --> 19:02.520
machine learning stuff, or whatever those cards do, you know, the magic stuff where

19:02.520 --> 19:06.000
they open up a vortex inside the card and calculate things that only enterprise cards

19:06.000 --> 19:07.000
can calculate?

19:07.000 --> 19:08.000
Yeah.

19:08.000 --> 19:09.000
That won't work.

19:09.000 --> 19:10.000
Yeah.

19:10.000 --> 19:11.000
Yeah, I don't know.

19:11.000 --> 19:13.420
I'm kind of spitballing on this one, Joe, but I'm just reading the tea leaves, and I'm

19:13.420 --> 19:17.560
thinking from a competitive standpoint, AMD is kicking their ass right now in the Linux

19:17.560 --> 19:19.160
workstation space.

19:19.160 --> 19:23.180
And Nvidia, they're one of those companies that keeps an eye on what the competition

19:23.180 --> 19:24.180
is doing.

19:24.180 --> 19:26.320
But it's been such a good year for AMD.

19:26.320 --> 19:32.240
If you look at the Ryzen stuff, the Threadripper, and the Epic, and of course with the graphics

19:32.240 --> 19:35.680
cards just working out of the box with the kernel.

19:35.680 --> 19:40.800
So maybe we will see Nvidia start to think, hmm, we need a bit of that market.

19:40.800 --> 19:44.840
Yeah, I don't think they're feeling the heat like Intel is, but I bet they're feeling the

19:44.840 --> 19:45.840
heat a little bit.

19:45.840 --> 19:50.920
Well, I look forward to returning to these predictions next year, but not as much as

19:50.920 --> 19:56.080
I look forward to returning to Bitcoin prices where we always get it wrong.

19:56.080 --> 19:57.640
We have to do this.

19:57.640 --> 19:58.640
Sorry.

19:58.640 --> 19:59.640
We have to now.

19:59.640 --> 20:03.920
I hate this, but it's necessary, it's like the vegetables of the predictions episode.

20:03.920 --> 20:05.360
So how do we do last year?

20:05.360 --> 20:11.060
Okay, so we always do this, the high for the year, the low for the year, and the price

20:11.060 --> 20:14.200
on December 1st, all in US dollars.

20:14.200 --> 20:22.240
So I said that the high for 2019 would be $6,000, and you said it would be $12,000.

20:22.240 --> 20:24.880
It was actually $13,000 in June.

20:24.880 --> 20:25.880
Hmm.

20:25.880 --> 20:28.280
Did a little better than you expected there, Joe.

20:28.280 --> 20:30.560
In fact, it did a little better than I expected.

20:30.560 --> 20:34.360
Yeah, but by price is right rules, you still win.

20:34.360 --> 20:39.280
Yeah, so that's $13,000 was in June.

20:39.280 --> 20:41.720
So that's a little bit now.

20:41.720 --> 20:44.160
So it peaked around summertime.

20:44.160 --> 20:45.160
Let's talk about the lows.

20:45.160 --> 20:50.000
I predicted $900, and you predicted $300.

20:50.000 --> 20:55.760
So we thought it was really going to bottom out, but it actually only got down to $3,400,

20:55.760 --> 21:01.000
which is pretty low, but actually not too bad.

21:01.000 --> 21:02.000
Not as bad as we thought.

21:02.000 --> 21:04.680
It could have gotten a lot worse, it looks like.

21:04.680 --> 21:06.840
Well, yeah, it could have got a lot worse.

21:06.840 --> 21:12.880
It was relatively stable, kind of hanging around at about $4,000-ish for the first few

21:12.880 --> 21:21.740
months and then creeping up to that $14,000, and then creeping back down to about $7,400

21:21.740 --> 21:28.240
on the 1st of December, which you had said it would be $9,200, and I said it would be

21:28.240 --> 21:30.040
$2,000.

21:30.040 --> 21:35.880
So you're much closer, but price is right rules means that I win that one, I'm afraid.

21:35.880 --> 21:38.560
Yeah, fair enough, fair enough.

21:38.560 --> 21:45.720
You know, I look at these numbers, and I think $7,000, not quite what I expected.

21:45.720 --> 21:49.160
You seem to be satisfied with $7,000 as the year wraps up.

21:49.160 --> 21:52.280
I, on the other hand, not satisfied.

21:52.280 --> 21:59.760
I think if you look at Bitcoin, there's one factor that I always try to remember is at

21:59.760 --> 22:09.200
a certain point in the lifespan, which isn't that far away, it stops minting new coins.

22:09.200 --> 22:15.200
And then there will only be a set amount of Bitcoins in circulation ever.

22:15.200 --> 22:20.520
And people are losing these things like crazy, throwing away hard drives, forgetting passwords,

22:20.520 --> 22:23.760
getting them stolen by Russian hackers, it still stings.

22:23.760 --> 22:28.720
I try to factor that in a little bit into my prediction, keeping in mind that the longer

22:28.720 --> 22:35.520
Bitcoin stays alive, inherently the more valuable each coin becomes because there is a fixed

22:35.520 --> 22:36.520
amount.

22:36.520 --> 22:39.680
Well, it depends which way you look at it, because more and more keep being created,

22:39.680 --> 22:43.280
and therefore you'd expect the price to go down until we get to the point where that

22:43.280 --> 22:49.240
finite number have been created, there will be no more, and then you'd expect it to rise

22:49.240 --> 22:50.480
at least gradually.

22:50.480 --> 22:51.480
Yeah.

22:51.480 --> 22:55.800
Although, because people know, people know that's coming, they start to factor that into

22:55.800 --> 22:58.680
the cost ahead of time, I think.

22:58.680 --> 23:03.400
It's not in our lifetime, but it is within a conceivable amount of time.

23:03.400 --> 23:08.240
It's something like 21 million or something like that, if I recall.

23:08.240 --> 23:13.680
So when it's at $7,000, I'm like, oh, you know, okay, you could do better.

23:13.680 --> 23:18.080
But by some measures, some consider it one of the best investments of the decade.

23:18.080 --> 23:19.080
Yeah.

23:19.080 --> 23:24.640
If you'd invested just $1 in Bitcoin at the beginning of the decade, it'd be worth around

23:24.640 --> 23:26.920
90,000 now.

23:26.920 --> 23:31.800
So if you put a couple thousand dollars in, I'm not even going to do that math, it's too

23:31.800 --> 23:32.800
depressing.

23:32.800 --> 23:33.800
I know.

23:33.800 --> 23:34.800
It is way too depressing.

23:34.800 --> 23:37.120
It's way, way too depressing.

23:37.120 --> 23:42.620
But it's one of the best performing investments of the decade.

23:42.620 --> 23:45.200
That's from CNN Business, which is wild.

23:45.200 --> 23:49.320
It sounds like it's something that some crazy person on the internet is saying, but they're

23:49.320 --> 23:51.360
not the only one writing that either.

23:51.360 --> 23:55.280
So with that said, looking forward to 2020, expectations are kind of high, I think.

23:55.280 --> 23:56.280
I don't know.

23:56.280 --> 23:58.440
My expectations aren't that high.

23:58.440 --> 24:03.640
I want to see stability, because stability will ultimately mean a greater value.

24:03.640 --> 24:10.240
It'd be far better if it stabilized at a price and gradually, gradually, gradually ticked

24:10.240 --> 24:11.360
up and up and up.

24:11.360 --> 24:17.040
The fact that we see a graph that looks like a sine wave, it's not a good look.

24:17.040 --> 24:18.600
Now that's kind of true.

24:18.600 --> 24:24.020
However, if you look at that graph on a much wider zoom, you'll notice that when it does

24:24.020 --> 24:32.520
crash down, it generally doesn't go below the value before the rally started.

24:32.520 --> 24:37.160
So when Bitcoin goes through a rally, and then there's an eventual correction and the

24:37.160 --> 24:42.200
price comes way down, when it finally settles, it settles at a price higher than when the

24:42.200 --> 24:43.420
rally begun.

24:43.420 --> 24:47.520
So when you look at it from that perspective, and you consider that over a many, many, many,

24:47.520 --> 24:51.600
many year perspective, overall, it ends up higher.

24:51.600 --> 24:54.940
It's just in the meantime, it goes up and down quite a bit.

24:54.940 --> 24:58.400
But yeah, I know it still is all over the place.

24:58.400 --> 25:01.920
But I'm feeling good about it.

25:01.920 --> 25:02.920
I'm feeling good.

25:02.920 --> 25:05.360
People are going to be all jacked up about an election.

25:05.360 --> 25:09.680
Whenever the state of the US government comes into question, the price of Bitcoin always

25:09.680 --> 25:10.680
goes up.

25:10.680 --> 25:12.440
So I'm feeling good about 2020.

25:12.440 --> 25:13.440
Okay.

25:13.440 --> 25:18.060
So what's your high prediction then for 2020?

25:18.060 --> 25:25.040
My max high for 2020 is a price that Bitcoin hasn't seen in two years.

25:25.040 --> 25:27.800
And that is $22,000.

25:27.800 --> 25:29.440
Well it's never seen 22 has it?

25:29.440 --> 25:30.440
No.

25:30.440 --> 25:31.440
It got up to just about 20.

25:31.440 --> 25:34.080
So you think it's going to have an all time high this year?

25:34.080 --> 25:35.080
I do.

25:35.080 --> 25:36.080
Interesting.

25:36.080 --> 25:39.840
I was thinking about this while I was driving earlier, because I still just couldn't make

25:39.840 --> 25:40.840
my mind up.

25:40.840 --> 25:44.400
And I thought, right, it's going to get to a high of 19.

25:44.400 --> 25:48.960
And then it's not going to keep going because people are going to get too nervous.

25:48.960 --> 25:52.840
They're going to think, is it going to get to 20?

25:52.840 --> 25:53.840
Is it going to break that?

25:53.840 --> 25:54.840
And then it just won't.

25:54.840 --> 25:57.220
I think around about 19,000.

25:57.220 --> 25:59.680
And then it'll start to come back down again.

25:59.680 --> 26:00.680
19,000.

26:00.680 --> 26:02.200
That's higher than I was expecting.

26:02.200 --> 26:03.800
I'd like it to not get that high.

26:03.800 --> 26:06.680
I'd like it to be more stable, but I don't think we're going to see that.

26:06.680 --> 26:08.880
I think that we will see a bit of a run on it.

26:08.880 --> 26:13.680
I'm not sure at what point in the year, possibly around the election, I don't know.

26:13.680 --> 26:18.400
It depends who ends up being selected as the Democratic nomination.

26:18.400 --> 26:21.280
I think that could have a strong impact on it.

26:21.280 --> 26:27.680
So the 2020 low I think is the hardest thing to pin down for this prediction, because I

26:27.680 --> 26:32.960
think we are about to see the low when we go into January in the beginning of the year.

26:32.960 --> 26:37.240
I think we will be seeing the low point for Bitcoin in the year.

26:37.240 --> 26:42.080
So I didn't know what to say here because it's all over the place.

26:42.080 --> 26:45.020
It's staying somewhere in the seven thousand dollar price range.

26:45.020 --> 26:49.180
This morning before we recorded it almost broke sixty nine hundred.

26:49.180 --> 26:52.060
But as we record now, it's at seventy one hundred.

26:52.060 --> 26:56.060
So I have to factor in another disaster could happen.

26:56.060 --> 26:57.060
It's possible.

26:57.060 --> 26:59.720
And January is well, it's here.

26:59.720 --> 27:01.600
So you never know.

27:01.600 --> 27:06.280
I genuinely don't think it's going to go this low, but I want to give myself some some ceiling

27:06.280 --> 27:07.840
or some floor, I guess, in this case.

27:07.840 --> 27:12.320
So I'm going to say Bitcoin's 2020 low will be five thousand dollars.

27:12.320 --> 27:14.640
That's interesting because I think it's going to be four thousand.

27:14.640 --> 27:15.640
Really?

27:15.640 --> 27:18.400
Yeah, I think it's not going to go any lower than that.

27:18.400 --> 27:23.980
But I think it will break through the five into the fours and then settle around about

27:23.980 --> 27:26.760
four thousand and then creep back up again.

27:26.760 --> 27:30.880
Little news could cause market turmoil, which could cause the price to go up.

27:30.880 --> 27:34.600
Plus, there's more and more outlets right now doing these stories about Bitcoin being

27:34.600 --> 27:37.080
the best investment of the last decade.

27:37.080 --> 27:38.880
And that could also cause people to spend money.

27:38.880 --> 27:39.880
True.

27:39.880 --> 27:41.240
See, I think we're going into the low period right now.

27:41.240 --> 27:44.240
So it may not go lower than seven in 2020.

27:44.240 --> 27:45.360
But I'm putting five.

27:45.360 --> 27:46.360
You're putting four down.

27:46.360 --> 27:47.360
I'm going to say four.

27:47.360 --> 27:48.360
All right.

27:48.360 --> 27:49.360
All right.

27:49.360 --> 27:52.240
It is worth mentioning at this point that we're recording on the 20th of December, even

27:52.240 --> 27:54.440
though we're talking about this year when you're listening to this.

27:54.440 --> 27:56.560
So we may well be wrong already.

27:56.560 --> 27:59.960
I know that's so actually likely to be the case.

27:59.960 --> 28:00.960
It's ridiculous.

28:00.960 --> 28:05.720
Now, our price that we both think it will be on December 1st, 2020.

28:05.720 --> 28:09.080
This is like the health check.

28:09.080 --> 28:10.440
Does it come up from its lows?

28:10.440 --> 28:11.440
Does it stay low?

28:11.440 --> 28:14.520
Does it does it remain at its peaks, which I said it's going to be twenty two thousand

28:14.520 --> 28:15.520
dollars?

28:15.520 --> 28:21.560
I'm putting down for the price on December 1st, 2020, Bitcoin will be around fourteen

28:21.560 --> 28:22.800
thousand dollars.

28:22.800 --> 28:26.660
I'm going to say almost half that seven thousand four hundred.

28:26.660 --> 28:29.720
That's a very specific price because that's how much it was this year.

28:29.720 --> 28:33.880
I think that we're going to see stability in the long term.

28:33.880 --> 28:38.640
It'll go up, it'll go down, but eventually it will find its way back to seven thousand

28:38.640 --> 28:39.760
four hundred.

28:39.760 --> 28:44.120
That would be like the first year, though, that there wasn't a pretty significant value

28:44.120 --> 28:45.120
increase.

28:45.120 --> 28:47.680
So you're kind of taking a risk with that one.

28:47.680 --> 28:52.720
Yes, I'm taking a risk because it's what I want to happen, I think.

28:52.720 --> 28:55.440
Because how can you possibly predict Bitcoin?

28:55.440 --> 28:59.160
You've just got to do what you, you've either got to be crazy with it or say what you actually

28:59.160 --> 29:00.160
want to happen.

29:00.160 --> 29:01.160
That's true.

29:01.160 --> 29:05.580
Yeah, I'd love it to be worth a million because then I'd be rich with my tiny amount, less

29:05.580 --> 29:06.580
than one.

29:06.580 --> 29:10.080
But it's not going to happen that, is it?

29:10.080 --> 29:11.080
What should be wrong?

29:11.080 --> 29:12.080
And it will be worth a million.

29:12.080 --> 29:13.080
You never know.

29:13.080 --> 29:14.960
I suppose something could happen.

29:14.960 --> 29:20.240
Wouldn't it just take some nation or some massive institution saying we're switching

29:20.240 --> 29:23.480
to Bitcoin as our backing and then takes off like crazy?

29:23.480 --> 29:27.680
There'd be a pretty foolish nation doing that.

29:27.680 --> 29:28.680
I know.

29:28.680 --> 29:30.520
Yeah, I don't think so.

29:30.520 --> 29:33.800
And the thing is with crypto currencies is if you're going to do something like that,

29:33.800 --> 29:35.160
you just make your own.

29:35.160 --> 29:36.320
Yeah, true.

29:36.320 --> 29:42.120
You could see potentially like a huge crash in the dollar or something, which seems very

29:42.120 --> 29:43.760
unlikely.

29:43.760 --> 29:49.160
And if the dollar is worth much less than it is now, then by default Bitcoin will be

29:49.160 --> 29:50.160
worth more.

29:50.160 --> 29:52.760
But I think that's pie in the sky.

29:52.760 --> 29:59.480
Well history has taught us that if there's one thing more volatile than the Linux open

29:59.480 --> 30:02.700
source community, it is the Bitcoin community.

30:02.700 --> 30:04.040
So it's going to be all over the place.

30:04.040 --> 30:05.480
The community is all over the place.

30:05.480 --> 30:08.560
There'll be all kinds of different crypto developments.

30:08.560 --> 30:10.480
So it's really tough to nail it down.

30:10.480 --> 30:16.280
But I feel like this time next year, Bitcoin will still be the king cryptocurrency.

30:16.280 --> 30:19.400
No, my couple hundred dogecoin are going to be worth a fortune.

30:19.400 --> 30:20.400
No, it's Libra.

30:20.400 --> 30:24.840
It's going to be Facebook's Libra.

30:24.840 --> 30:28.600
