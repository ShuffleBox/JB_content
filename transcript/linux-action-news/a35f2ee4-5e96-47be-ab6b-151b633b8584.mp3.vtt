00:00.000 --> 00:15.920
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, our weekly take on Linux and the open source world.

00:15.920 --> 00:20.480
This is episode 27, recorded on November 12th, 2017.

00:20.480 --> 00:21.480
I'm Chris.

00:21.480 --> 00:22.480
And I'm Joe.

00:22.480 --> 00:23.480
Hello, Joe.

00:23.480 --> 00:25.040
It's good to be connected with you again.

00:25.040 --> 00:29.400
And as we're recording this particular episode, Bitcoin is on a bit of a nosedive.

00:29.400 --> 00:34.880
Yeah, which is a bit surprising to me, because I thought it would rally after this SegWit

00:34.880 --> 00:37.680
2x fork was called off.

00:37.680 --> 00:41.080
Yeah, we talked about this fork a couple of weeks ago on the show.

00:41.080 --> 00:45.640
And it was that big idea of increasing the size of the individual blockchain storage

00:45.640 --> 00:46.640
to two megabytes.

00:46.640 --> 00:52.760
Yeah, it was kind of a compromise between original Bitcoin and Bitcoin gold.

00:52.760 --> 00:55.280
And it was looking like it was definitely going to happen.

00:55.280 --> 00:58.640
And then at the last minute, they called it off.

00:58.640 --> 01:03.120
And so I don't understand why the price has dropped, really, because I thought that yet

01:03.120 --> 01:07.160
more fragmentation in Bitcoin would have been bad for the market.

01:07.160 --> 01:08.160
I agree.

01:08.160 --> 01:11.780
It's kind of odd, too, since the official reason for calling it off was to decrease

01:11.780 --> 01:17.360
potential user confusion in the next several weeks, and to keep people focused on mainline

01:17.360 --> 01:18.360
Bitcoin.

01:18.360 --> 01:20.080
So now we're seeing a big drop.

01:20.080 --> 01:24.720
And I've been watching the Twitters, and a few people I follow that are involved in Bitcoin

01:24.720 --> 01:27.100
and blockchain development projects.

01:27.100 --> 01:32.000
And they're saying that there was a huge reduction in processing power on the Bitcoin network

01:32.000 --> 01:33.280
last night as well.

01:33.280 --> 01:38.280
And as a result, transaction fees with the sale off happening and reduction in processing

01:38.280 --> 01:44.640
power, transaction fees are up near $40 right now per transaction, as we record this episode.

01:44.640 --> 01:48.320
Which is basically the crux of this whole potential fork, isn't it?

01:48.320 --> 01:53.800
That because the size is so small of each block, it is getting increasingly expensive

01:53.800 --> 01:55.620
to pay the transaction fees.

01:55.620 --> 01:59.720
So it's inevitable that they're going to have to raise that block size at some stage, you

01:59.720 --> 02:00.720
would have thought.

02:00.720 --> 02:01.720
Yeah.

02:01.720 --> 02:04.480
And in the announcement, it kind of implies this problem isn't going away.

02:04.480 --> 02:08.320
And maybe we'll all be a little more motivated in the future to solve it.

02:08.320 --> 02:11.620
And right now, I'm feeling a little motivated to solve it, because I couldn't imagine trying

02:11.620 --> 02:14.080
to buy goods right now with transaction fees that high.

02:14.080 --> 02:16.700
You can't use it for buying and selling goods.

02:16.700 --> 02:18.960
You can use it to trade the currency.

02:18.960 --> 02:23.960
But with fees that high, it's almost impossible to buy anything with the online window that

02:23.960 --> 02:27.060
typically is presented to a user when they're purchasing with Bitcoin.

02:27.060 --> 02:31.240
There's a limited window for the confirmations of the transaction.

02:31.240 --> 02:35.480
And if, say, your transaction isn't confirmed, and in this example, 15 minutes, it's canceled.

02:35.480 --> 02:39.480
Yeah, but if you're sending it to someone and you don't really care how long it takes,

02:39.480 --> 02:42.000
then you can just send it to the network and just wait, right?

02:42.000 --> 02:43.000
Yeah.

02:43.000 --> 02:45.440
That's why I say if you're just trading the currency and whatnot, it's not a big deal.

02:45.440 --> 02:49.680
It's only when you're really trying to buy and sell goods, and you want to buy and sell

02:49.680 --> 02:52.880
the goods before the price drops any further.

02:52.880 --> 02:54.120
Yeah.

02:54.120 --> 03:00.360
So we also talked last week about this idea of each transaction taking as much energy

03:00.360 --> 03:02.160
as a house does in a week.

03:02.160 --> 03:08.240
And that has basically prompted a new, at this stage, kind of vaporware currency called

03:08.240 --> 03:09.240
Chia.

03:09.240 --> 03:10.780
Ch-ch-ch-Chia.

03:10.780 --> 03:11.780
That's a great name.

03:11.780 --> 03:12.780
Yeah.

03:12.780 --> 03:17.120
Yeah, but in this case, instead of feeding it CPU power, you feed it storage.

03:17.120 --> 03:19.240
Yeah, but this isn't a unique idea.

03:19.240 --> 03:24.200
There are other currencies that do this, but other currencies don't have Bram Cohen behind

03:24.200 --> 03:25.200
them.

03:25.200 --> 03:27.280
He's the guy who invented BitTorrent.

03:27.280 --> 03:33.000
So he's a big name, and he's raised a lot of money already in VC funding to build this

03:33.000 --> 03:34.000
thing.

03:34.000 --> 03:36.700
There is something a little new here with Chia, and it's really kind of a combination

03:36.700 --> 03:38.040
of multiple techniques.

03:38.040 --> 03:43.520
I guess one of the typical weak points of proof of storage cryptos is people were doing

03:43.520 --> 03:47.400
sneaky attacks where they'd add a bunch of storage and then covertly remove it and trick

03:47.400 --> 03:52.120
the network and then I guess twirl their mustache and run off to the bank.

03:52.120 --> 03:56.560
And Chia has worked in a little failsafe to that.

03:56.560 --> 04:00.640
It relies on proofs of space that have timers set on them.

04:00.640 --> 04:07.440
It combines that to disarm a wide array of attacks to which proofs of space are susceptible.

04:07.440 --> 04:12.760
So does this mean that, along with graphics cards, now hard drives are going to be really

04:12.760 --> 04:13.760
expensive?

04:13.760 --> 04:14.760
Maybe.

04:14.760 --> 04:15.760
I guess.

04:15.760 --> 04:22.200
I can picture this like a network here at the studio where we have a dozen machines

04:22.200 --> 04:27.240
and they probably have about 80% of their hard drive free on most of them.

04:27.240 --> 04:32.680
So I don't really see this as purchasing additional storage just to get the cryptocurrency, but

04:32.680 --> 04:36.120
more like using my storage that I'm not currently utilizing.

04:36.120 --> 04:40.400
Yeah, but if there's any money to be made in it, people will buy hard drives, won't

04:40.400 --> 04:41.400
they?

04:41.400 --> 04:42.400
Yeah.

04:42.400 --> 04:43.400
It'll give hoarders a whole new reason.

04:43.400 --> 04:44.400
Yeah.

04:44.400 --> 04:49.360
Well, it'll make me get one because I've only got a few hundred gigabytes left in my desktop

04:49.360 --> 04:50.760
machine where I store everything.

04:50.760 --> 04:56.400
So maybe I'll have to get a couple of, I don't know, eight terabyte disks or something.

04:56.400 --> 04:59.680
Or you go the other direction and you do it all on your phone.

04:59.680 --> 05:05.480
We talked recently also about Samsung integrating a Linux desktop option on some of their Galaxy

05:05.480 --> 05:08.400
smartphones when you put them in the Dex dock.

05:08.400 --> 05:11.120
And now we appear to have gotten a little proof of concept.

05:11.120 --> 05:12.120
Yeah.

05:12.120 --> 05:16.720
I've got a video of it running now and it says Ubuntu 16, whatever that is.

05:16.720 --> 05:23.400
Although it does say 16.04 somewhere a little bit smaller, which is pretty cool that they've

05:23.400 --> 05:25.400
actually got a proof of concept.

05:25.400 --> 05:28.720
I don't think that it is just a kind of mock-up, is it?

05:28.720 --> 05:30.800
It does appear to actually be running.

05:30.800 --> 05:33.680
We have a link to the article which has this video embedded in it.

05:33.680 --> 05:40.000
Go to linuxactionnews.com slash 27 and in there about the 12 second mark, you see a

05:40.000 --> 05:43.520
Linux on Galaxy app and the user runs that.

05:43.520 --> 05:47.320
And then pretty quickly you get the menu, like Joe was saying, for Ubuntu 16.

05:47.320 --> 05:51.880
Also worth noting, there's a plus button there, which would seem to indicate you could add

05:51.880 --> 05:55.480
other distributions, making good on Samsung's promise.

05:55.480 --> 05:59.480
And it seems to be like it's an app that is running the Linux environment.

05:59.480 --> 06:03.720
I'm not sure how it's doing it, if it's like VNC into an X session, which is running in

06:03.720 --> 06:09.800
a contained environment, or if it's a virtualized system and it's all contained within the

06:09.800 --> 06:10.800
app.

06:10.800 --> 06:11.800
It's not clear from the video.

06:11.800 --> 06:16.200
But the speed seems pretty respectable and they even go as far as launching Eclipse and

06:16.200 --> 06:22.740
start doing native ARM development on the phone and Eclipse launches pretty fast, closes

06:22.740 --> 06:23.740
pretty quick.

06:23.740 --> 06:27.560
The whole interface seems to be better than, say, a remote X2Go interface would be.

06:27.560 --> 06:30.800
Yeah, proving that they're really marketing this at developers.

06:30.800 --> 06:35.480
Yeah, that was a point they made in the video at a minute and nine with big white text that

06:35.480 --> 06:40.160
comes up on the screen that really makes the point you can do native ARM development on

06:40.160 --> 06:41.640
this phone.

06:41.640 --> 06:46.120
And you could see how even maybe Android developers would like that for certain types of troubleshooting

06:46.120 --> 06:47.400
or bug fixing.

06:47.400 --> 06:51.200
This really could be aimed squarely at the developer market, sort of like the Dell Sputnik

06:51.200 --> 06:52.200
program is.

06:52.200 --> 06:56.920
Yeah, but that doesn't mean that us non-developers can't take advantage of the cool toys.

06:56.920 --> 07:01.760
Yeah, I mean, if this really works well, I would be honestly tempted by this.

07:01.760 --> 07:06.600
I was sort of thinking about this story on the drive down to the studio this morning

07:06.600 --> 07:11.840
and I got with me my backpack and I have my laptop and my charger and I have a USB to

07:11.840 --> 07:16.040
Ethernet in there and I have all these extra things that I might need someday.

07:16.040 --> 07:17.440
And it's a lot to carry around.

07:17.440 --> 07:20.240
And I'm here on a Sunday morning, I'm looking at them, all right, I'm bringing my stupid

07:20.240 --> 07:21.920
bag with me to work again.

07:21.920 --> 07:25.880
And at that point of thinking about the story, I thought, it would be kind of nice for what

07:25.880 --> 07:26.880
I need to do today.

07:26.880 --> 07:31.000
I just need to browse the web, respond to Telegram, use some docs.

07:31.000 --> 07:35.680
I could do all of that if I could put the phone in a doc and just have it in my pocket.

07:35.680 --> 07:39.280
It honestly, it puts another check in the Samsung column for me.

07:39.280 --> 07:43.960
I'm not likely to buy a Samsung phone anytime soon, but if this becomes a regular feature

07:43.960 --> 07:48.680
that is well executed, it will make me reconsider that position.

07:48.680 --> 07:54.240
Yeah, and if it does well and is popular, then it may spread to other OEMs as well,

07:54.240 --> 07:55.240
which would be nice.

07:55.240 --> 07:58.840
Although thinking about it, Google and their phones would be the obvious choice there,

07:58.840 --> 08:02.520
but they've moved away from developers towards consumers, or at least that's what they're

08:02.520 --> 08:07.040
trying to do, aren't they, with the Pixel line, now they've completely abandoned Nexus.

08:07.040 --> 08:11.520
Yeah, I did feel like the Nexus line was more aimed at developers.

08:11.520 --> 08:15.660
The Pixel does seem to be more consumer-based, but I have to say, if they added this functionality

08:15.660 --> 08:20.000
to the Pixel 3, if there was like a little code exchange between Google and Samsung,

08:20.000 --> 08:23.920
and they added this to the Pixel 3, boy, I think that would be a slam dunk phone for

08:23.920 --> 08:24.920
me.

08:24.920 --> 08:27.880
Yeah, well, we're seeing it working with Mario OS, so we know that it is possible.

08:27.880 --> 08:32.600
I don't think that it's, it's not exactly rocket science, it's using existing technologies

08:32.600 --> 08:39.400
that are there, LexD and LexC, and just containerization, and okay, it's one thing to say just a bit

08:39.400 --> 08:42.800
of that, but you're not having to reinvent the wheel, you're just having to combine things

08:42.800 --> 08:43.800
that already exist.

08:43.800 --> 08:45.040
Yeah, I think that's a great point.

08:45.040 --> 08:49.360
That is a really fair point, is it's already built into the host operating system that

08:49.360 --> 08:51.040
Android is built on.

08:51.040 --> 08:55.760
But maybe Google wants us to think more about Chrome OS, and it just got a bit easier to

08:55.760 --> 08:58.280
run Windows apps on Chrome OS.

08:58.280 --> 09:03.540
Yeah, thanks to Crossover, which is based on Wine, you can run some Windows apps on

09:03.540 --> 09:06.940
Chrome OS, but there's kind of a few asterisks here.

09:06.940 --> 09:12.440
It has to be an x86 based Chromebook, and it has to be one that's capable of running

09:12.440 --> 09:14.000
Android applications.

09:14.000 --> 09:15.000
And the Play services.

09:15.000 --> 09:17.920
Yeah, which are the modern ones, basically.

09:17.920 --> 09:22.640
Not my old C720, unfortunately, it's the touchscreen ones that have come out in the last year or

09:22.640 --> 09:28.360
two that all support Android apps, and this is Crossover as an Android app, which is allowing

09:28.360 --> 09:30.800
you to run Windows applications.

09:30.800 --> 09:35.000
The first example is Office, which seems a bit strange because Google wants everyone

09:35.000 --> 09:38.520
to use their own Google Docs, don't they?

09:38.520 --> 09:44.000
So it's strange that they would allow people to run Microsoft Office.

09:44.000 --> 09:47.400
I suppose once Crossover is approved to the Play Store, Google doesn't have much say in

09:47.400 --> 09:49.880
what Crossover enables you to do.

09:49.880 --> 09:53.000
And with the Chromebook, you got that full size keyboard most of the time.

09:53.000 --> 09:56.140
It's kind of begging for Office application type uses.

09:56.140 --> 10:01.280
But as a desktop Linux user of Crossover Office, what I wonder is if that UI that they've developed

10:01.280 --> 10:04.560
for this is going to make its way over to Linux.

10:04.560 --> 10:09.300
CodeWeavers has been slowly revving the UI with each release pretty steadily, but the

10:09.300 --> 10:13.040
version they've released for Chrome OS is completely redesigned.

10:13.040 --> 10:16.880
And so I would really be curious if somebody at CodeWeavers wants to get a hold of me at

10:16.880 --> 10:21.920
Chris Ellis, will that new version, that new UI, make its way to the desktop because it

10:21.920 --> 10:22.920
looked pretty good.

10:22.920 --> 10:23.920
Yeah, hopefully.

10:23.920 --> 10:28.160
Well, speaking of looking good, Ubuntu is looking for a new theme and they don't want

10:28.160 --> 10:29.160
to pay for it.

10:29.160 --> 10:32.720
So they want volunteers from the community to help them out.

10:32.720 --> 10:35.800
I like how you just go after, they won't be willing to pay for it because that crossed

10:35.800 --> 10:36.800
my mind too.

10:36.800 --> 10:37.800
I was like, oh, a community theme.

10:37.800 --> 10:40.920
But you know what, Joe, they've had a lot of success with this in the past.

10:40.920 --> 10:43.200
So I'm a bit more of a believer these days than I used to be.

10:43.200 --> 10:46.400
Well, I don't think there's anything particularly wrong with the theme that they've got already

10:46.400 --> 10:47.780
in 1710.

10:47.780 --> 10:50.760
It's not amazingly beautiful, but it's certainly not ugly.

10:50.760 --> 10:54.200
Yeah, you would, you XFCE user, you would be totally fine with it.

10:54.200 --> 10:55.200
Well, yeah.

10:55.200 --> 10:56.200
Are you not fine with it?

10:56.200 --> 10:59.000
You know, it's okay for a few days.

10:59.000 --> 11:03.560
And then after that, I ended up putting Arc Dark and that really looks tight.

11:03.560 --> 11:05.120
It looks really good.

11:05.120 --> 11:06.120
It's fine.

11:06.120 --> 11:07.120
It's usable.

11:07.120 --> 11:12.240
It's, I think, gets more crap than it should because the icons are very readable.

11:12.240 --> 11:14.920
It's all very clear.

11:14.920 --> 11:16.080
It's well designed.

11:16.080 --> 11:17.200
It's just old, Joe.

11:17.200 --> 11:18.200
That's all.

11:18.200 --> 11:19.200
It's just stale.

11:19.200 --> 11:22.600
But you can have this problem with the icons if you have a new theme that unless you make

11:22.600 --> 11:26.800
an icon for every possible application, you're not going to have consistency there, are you?

11:26.800 --> 11:27.800
Yeah.

11:27.800 --> 11:30.000
That's why I think they're taking a reasonable approach.

11:30.000 --> 11:36.100
They are going to do a fork, or at least they're going to start with something like Edwardia

11:36.100 --> 11:38.720
and then work on top of that as a base.

11:38.720 --> 11:40.920
And so it's not like they're creating it from whole cloth.

11:40.920 --> 11:45.580
Yeah, but it does kind of contradict this idea that they're still investing in the desktop

11:45.580 --> 11:50.360
because they don't really have much of a design team left and farming this stuff out to the

11:50.360 --> 11:52.520
community.

11:52.520 --> 12:00.340
It just feels like proof of my original feelings that they were effectively abandoning the desktop

12:00.340 --> 12:01.340
to the community.

12:01.340 --> 12:05.640
And I know we've talked about how they're joining the GNOME advisory board and they're

12:05.640 --> 12:11.960
pulling their weight there, but this is the real nuts and bolts of the desktop, at least

12:11.960 --> 12:14.520
as far as the Ubuntu users are concerned.

12:14.520 --> 12:19.640
Okay, all the Wayland stuff and all of the plumbing is what really matters.

12:19.640 --> 12:23.520
But what the users are faced with is kind of like the final layer, isn't it?

12:23.520 --> 12:25.480
The gloss on top of it.

12:25.480 --> 12:30.680
And if that's just farmed out to the community, it just feels like a bit of a cop out to me.

12:30.680 --> 12:32.080
I can see what you're saying.

12:32.080 --> 12:36.560
It's also pretty heavily connected to branding, which is generally important to these companies.

12:36.560 --> 12:37.560
I look at it like this.

12:37.560 --> 12:42.640
The problem with the theme is you can never please everybody and a huge percentage of

12:42.640 --> 12:45.960
their more advanced users likely change the theme anyways.

12:45.960 --> 12:49.080
So how much do you really want to invest as a company who's trying to be very careful

12:49.080 --> 12:53.120
about profitability and making development of this project sustainable?

12:53.120 --> 12:58.960
How do you justify investing a whole bunch of staff time into something that a lot of

12:58.960 --> 13:01.040
people are going to change and a lot of people won't like anyways?

13:01.040 --> 13:03.840
It just seems like that is the kind of thing you want to punt to the community.

13:03.840 --> 13:07.760
And people who really care will install their own theme and people who don't care will just

13:07.760 --> 13:08.760
use the default.

13:08.760 --> 13:09.760
Yeah, I suppose.

13:09.760 --> 13:11.600
And it doesn't really affect me anyway.

13:11.600 --> 13:15.480
I'm just here using Greybird on XFCE.

13:15.480 --> 13:16.480
That's true.

13:16.480 --> 13:19.520
Although maybe one day, if it's really successful, it'll work its way to XFCE.

13:19.520 --> 13:23.960
If they're basing it on Adwadia, you got a decent base to start with.

13:23.960 --> 13:24.960
With some minor...

13:24.960 --> 13:26.160
Well, I shouldn't say that.

13:26.160 --> 13:27.160
That's not true.

13:27.160 --> 13:30.720
But with some solid modifications and improvements, you could have another base theme that they

13:30.720 --> 13:33.280
could use for years and it could get passed around.

13:33.280 --> 13:35.520
It could become the next theme.

13:35.520 --> 13:43.120
I hear those guys over at System76 might have something they could try.

13:43.120 --> 13:44.840
Linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

13:44.840 --> 13:48.380
You go there to sign up for a free seven day trial and you support the show and you get

13:48.380 --> 13:50.120
to learn more about Linux.

13:50.120 --> 13:53.400
Seven days too will give you enough time to poke around and try out their self-paced in-depth

13:53.400 --> 13:54.400
video courses.

13:54.400 --> 13:58.680
They have scenario based labs, which is my favorite because that's what sticks with you.

13:58.680 --> 14:00.600
It gives you the real world experience.

14:00.600 --> 14:04.440
You get SSH into the server and you have a guide to go by.

14:04.440 --> 14:06.680
It'll match whatever distribution you've chosen for the guide.

14:06.680 --> 14:07.960
The virtual servers will match it.

14:07.960 --> 14:08.960
I love that.

14:08.960 --> 14:12.080
And if you ever get stuck, they have real human beings that can help you.

14:12.080 --> 14:15.440
And if you're super busy, if you got a lot going on these days, you can rest assured

14:15.440 --> 14:17.280
that they'll work with your busy schedule.

14:17.280 --> 14:22.000
They have a course scheduler that helps you set goals, stick with them, remind you about

14:22.000 --> 14:26.720
things that are coming up and you can sort of turn it up and turn it down as you need.

14:26.720 --> 14:30.120
Community stacked full of Jupyter broadcasting members and study tools.

14:30.120 --> 14:34.660
They're extremely useful and you can download and take them with you, like audio and text.

14:34.660 --> 14:38.080
And speaking of going with you, they have iOS and Android apps as well.

14:38.080 --> 14:42.360
It's a platform to learn more about Linux and every cloud and DevOps topic, including

14:42.360 --> 14:52.640
AWS, OpenStack, Azure, all that big stuff, linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

14:52.640 --> 14:57.600
Can you believe it's five years since the Linux Steam client was first released?

14:57.600 --> 14:58.600
Five whole years.

14:58.600 --> 15:03.000
No, actually that doesn't register for me because I still recall talking about the rumors

15:03.000 --> 15:06.720
if it was really going to happen or not and looking at like leaked images and Windows

15:06.720 --> 15:10.760
installers and covering Michael Arbol's early coverage of it where he said it was going

15:10.760 --> 15:11.760
to happen.

15:11.760 --> 15:14.440
All of that still is very, very vivid in my memory.

15:14.440 --> 15:15.440
Yeah.

15:15.440 --> 15:17.600
Presumably you were pretty excited about it at the time.

15:17.600 --> 15:18.600
I was.

15:18.600 --> 15:20.080
I still am.

15:20.080 --> 15:25.200
For me personally, Steam on Linux has reached the point where I'm pretty much 100% satisfied.

15:25.200 --> 15:29.880
All of the games I want to play are available for me and I have now way more games than

15:29.880 --> 15:31.160
I ever have time to play.

15:31.160 --> 15:33.120
I've absolutely been saturated.

15:33.120 --> 15:37.460
It's a great problem to have and even if Linux isn't huge for the Steam platform, it's made

15:37.460 --> 15:41.200
it completely possible for me to never need to boot into Windows.

15:41.200 --> 15:45.080
Do you think that's a common story with Linux users or do you think there are people who

15:45.080 --> 15:49.480
are still desperate to get the AAA titles on Linux?

15:49.480 --> 15:50.480
Yes and no.

15:50.480 --> 15:54.940
If you look at the top selling games on Steam right now, like Rocket League and Shadow Tactics

15:54.940 --> 16:01.240
and Counter-Strike Global Offensive and Rust and Ark Survival Evolved, Civilization games,

16:01.240 --> 16:04.880
those are all available for Linux and they're the number one seller.

16:04.880 --> 16:08.240
Some of the AAA games aren't available for Linux but the ones that are selling the most

16:08.240 --> 16:11.040
on Steam appear to be available for Linux.

16:11.040 --> 16:13.000
So you think that is quite a healthy situation.

16:13.000 --> 16:16.760
You see, I am totally outside this whole world.

16:16.760 --> 16:21.180
It's very much an academic interest to me because I don't really play games at all.

16:21.180 --> 16:25.920
So it's difficult for me to judge but you have historically been quite a gamer, haven't

16:25.920 --> 16:26.920
you?

16:26.920 --> 16:27.920
I've always tried to be a gamer.

16:27.920 --> 16:31.880
I've unsuccessfully tried to be a gamer constantly because I love the idea of just sitting down

16:31.880 --> 16:34.720
and having a great gaming experience and I get them from time to time.

16:34.720 --> 16:37.040
I've recently been really enjoying Rust.

16:37.040 --> 16:39.540
Mostly it's because I'm playing with other people that I really like.

16:39.540 --> 16:43.520
The elephant in the room about gaming on Linux, specifically Steam, is that if you look at

16:43.520 --> 16:47.060
the raw numbers, it appears Linux is doing quite bad.

16:47.060 --> 16:54.840
It's recently at 0.35% which is below the 2% it nearly was at the peak when Steam launched

16:54.840 --> 16:55.840
on Linux.

16:55.840 --> 16:59.680
So it would appear from the raw numbers that it's way down.

16:59.680 --> 17:04.720
However, that's also because Steam itself has grown considerably and there's certain

17:04.720 --> 17:09.760
aspects to the market that are only available to Windows users like the HTC Vive platform.

17:09.760 --> 17:15.440
So I think the state of Linux gaming is stronger than it has been but we're sort of all waiting

17:15.440 --> 17:22.760
for the transition to Vulkan to land because that looks to be very good for Linux.

17:22.760 --> 17:25.920
There's a couple of games, speaking of AAA games that came out, a racing game recently

17:25.920 --> 17:26.920
came out.

17:26.920 --> 17:33.760
Gorgeous game, AAA title, day one support for Linux and it's a Vulkan game.

17:33.760 --> 17:37.320
And friend of the show Wimpy was telling me about some of the unbelievable frame rates

17:37.320 --> 17:41.920
he was getting using external graphics and it's very promising.

17:41.920 --> 17:48.360
It's over 100 frames per second on a AAA title using Vulkan on day one launch for Linux.

17:48.360 --> 17:52.680
I wonder what you'd get under Windows for that, presumably a little bit more.

17:52.680 --> 17:54.920
Knowing Wimpy, I bet you he will test all of those things.

17:54.920 --> 17:59.440
I hope we will hear a full report from him soon and it's very promising.

17:59.440 --> 18:03.440
Over 100 frames per second using external graphics on Linux, that doesn't even seem

18:03.440 --> 18:08.420
like something that would have even been possible a few years ago and if that trend continues,

18:08.420 --> 18:11.900
we might see more and more games come to Linux just as a result of all the fundamental technology

18:11.900 --> 18:14.320
is being supported by Linux.

18:14.320 --> 18:19.760
But the whole Steam on Linux was a precursor to the Steam machines, wasn't it?

18:19.760 --> 18:22.120
And that has just not really worked out at all, has it?

18:22.120 --> 18:26.840
Yeah, it seemed like a big hedge, it seemed like a market reaction to the Windows Store

18:26.840 --> 18:28.400
and to Microsoft's strategies.

18:28.400 --> 18:32.720
But that threat isn't necessarily gone and Microsoft is continually getting more competitive

18:32.720 --> 18:34.320
in the gaming industry.

18:34.320 --> 18:38.900
They've really integrated the Xbox Live platform into all gaming aspects.

18:38.900 --> 18:42.880
The new Minecraft is heavily integrated into the Xbox experience, even if you're playing

18:42.880 --> 18:44.320
it on the Windows platform.

18:44.320 --> 18:47.560
That continues to be a fundamental threat to Valve's business model.

18:47.560 --> 18:52.520
So you think they're keeping it on the back burner and are ready to pounce if necessary

18:52.520 --> 18:53.520
then?

18:53.520 --> 18:54.520
I'd like to say that's the case.

18:54.520 --> 18:58.640
I'd really like to say that Valve is one of those companies that's unlike most companies

18:58.640 --> 19:02.920
in the tech field and that they're willing to invest over time slowly, maybe even for

19:02.920 --> 19:08.240
a decade into something, just to make sure it's right before they fully launch it or

19:08.240 --> 19:09.560
it really takes over.

19:09.560 --> 19:12.780
They're willing to take that slow burn approach for a lot of their projects.

19:12.780 --> 19:15.580
So I'm inclined to hope that's the case, Joe.

19:15.580 --> 19:16.580
But we just got to wait and see.

19:16.580 --> 19:18.800
And meanwhile, we're still getting great games for Linux.

19:18.800 --> 19:22.280
So as long as my Linux desktop is still getting great games, I really don't care what happens

19:22.280 --> 19:23.280
with Steam machines.

19:23.280 --> 19:27.680
Yeah, but the thing is that all it takes is one game to not be available to drive people

19:27.680 --> 19:29.960
to Windows or to keep people on Windows, rather.

19:29.960 --> 19:34.640
There's a person I know, I tried to convert him to Linux, I tried to say, look, you've

19:34.640 --> 19:39.240
got Steam available, and if not, then you've got to play on Linux and Wine and stuff.

19:39.240 --> 19:43.440
But there was just one game that he wanted to play, some stupid casino game or something,

19:43.440 --> 19:44.540
I don't even know.

19:44.540 --> 19:46.780
And it just wouldn't work.

19:46.780 --> 19:51.140
And so he was like, well, I'm not using Linux, then it's as simple as that.

19:51.140 --> 19:57.580
So until you get 100% of the Steam games available for Linux, you're going to have a lot of people

19:57.580 --> 19:59.840
who will just not move over.

19:59.840 --> 20:02.000
Don't you feel like that's true for gaming in general, though?

20:02.000 --> 20:05.960
Like I'm tempted right now by a Nintendo Switch because it's the only platform that has Mario

20:05.960 --> 20:11.680
Odyssey, and that would technically be taking gameplay time away from Linux.

20:11.680 --> 20:17.840
I think the nice thing that Linux has going for it is I can't install the Xbox OS on my

20:17.840 --> 20:18.840
Nintendo Switch.

20:18.840 --> 20:22.940
So I can play the hell out of Mario Odyssey for six months and then be bored and want

20:22.940 --> 20:25.880
to load a different OS on my Nintendo to play a different game, can't do it.

20:25.880 --> 20:30.840
At least with x86 hardware, you can be drawn to Windows for a game, and if time heals those

20:30.840 --> 20:35.960
wounds and makes that game available for Linux, they at least have the option of utilizing

20:35.960 --> 20:37.920
the same hardware investment.

20:37.920 --> 20:43.520
And that gives Linux a slight edge over like typical consoles or other platforms.

20:43.520 --> 20:45.200
Yeah, that's true.

20:45.200 --> 20:48.200
And you can do both as well, which you can't really do on consoles these days.

20:48.200 --> 20:51.160
So yeah, there is the option there to have both.

20:51.160 --> 20:53.040
Of course, Munich doesn't see it that way.

20:53.040 --> 20:58.600
It appears this is based on translation in the Linux unplugged subreddit, that the vote

20:58.600 --> 21:02.500
to move to Windows 10 in Munich has completed.

21:02.500 --> 21:03.500
It's done.

21:03.500 --> 21:05.420
It's over, and it's been decided.

21:05.420 --> 21:10.800
Over a two-year period, 29,000 PCs will be migrated from Linux to Windows 10.

21:10.800 --> 21:12.880
The dream is officially over.

21:12.880 --> 21:17.200
The poster child for an open source in government is dead.

21:17.200 --> 21:21.380
Joe, why do you suppose they had to have their own customized version of Linux, which ended

21:21.380 --> 21:25.320
up being a huge hassle, but they're totally fine with stock Windows 10?

21:25.320 --> 21:27.640
Well, it's politics, isn't it?

21:27.640 --> 21:30.480
And incompetence of politicians.

21:30.480 --> 21:36.120
We've been saying this throughout the whole thing, that if they'd gone with Red Hat, Suza,

21:36.120 --> 21:40.800
Ubuntu, and gone for a properly supported Linux, okay, it would have been a little bit

21:40.800 --> 21:44.960
more upfront investment, but we probably wouldn't be having this conversation now.

21:44.960 --> 21:49.600
They wouldn't have gone back to Windows because it wouldn't have necessarily worked out cheaper

21:49.600 --> 21:51.420
to do so.

21:51.420 --> 21:57.840
So why they rolled their own, presumably cost is the only thing I can think of.

21:57.840 --> 21:59.480
It must have been cheaper for them to do that.

21:59.480 --> 22:03.120
They must have done the maths of that, but not thinking ahead about the maintenance cost

22:03.120 --> 22:04.280
of it all.

22:04.280 --> 22:10.400
That surely could be the only driver here, unless there was some ideological reason that

22:10.400 --> 22:16.440
they wanted to create something that other people could benefit from, but that just doesn't

22:16.440 --> 22:17.680
really make sense, does it?

22:17.680 --> 22:20.680
Because everyone can benefit, at least from Ubuntu.

22:20.680 --> 22:24.720
This is my recollection, and I've been following this story so long that I've forgotten more

22:24.720 --> 22:26.800
about it than I can recall.

22:26.800 --> 22:30.960
But my recollection was, they specifically went with their own distribution because they

22:30.960 --> 22:36.120
made tweaks that made the migration from Windows for their users easier, made accommodations

22:36.120 --> 22:40.400
for their network and internet, and allowed them to package custom versions of some of

22:40.400 --> 22:45.240
the major software, like OpenOffice, I don't remember if you recall, but they forked their

22:45.240 --> 22:48.120
own version of OpenOffice with their own certain plugins.

22:48.120 --> 22:55.620
And so that sort of necessitated Limux, and then all of these customizations became very

22:55.620 --> 22:59.840
hard to move forward to future versions of Linux they wanted to base Limux off of.

22:59.840 --> 23:03.880
And they kind of got trapped in their own technical debt to a degree, and then the users

23:03.880 --> 23:05.880
got frustrated with the experience.

23:05.880 --> 23:10.200
And that's finally what broke this issue, is the users were just getting sick and tired

23:10.200 --> 23:13.160
of a system that wasn't up to snuff.

23:13.160 --> 23:16.760
You've got to imagine people come in from other companies, they come in from other areas

23:16.760 --> 23:20.880
of government and they see this, where they don't have these problems, and it must be

23:20.880 --> 23:22.160
ridiculous to them.

23:22.160 --> 23:27.280
And so this user pushback just grew and grew and grew over time, because it's a huge project

23:27.280 --> 23:31.040
to develop your own operating system, especially one that's highly customized, and then to

23:31.040 --> 23:35.500
ship it to end users workstations and get them upgraded and keep them up to date.

23:35.500 --> 23:38.440
It's a massive task in a government like that.

23:38.440 --> 23:42.240
And to your point, if they'd gone with the mainstream distribution, they would have had

23:42.240 --> 23:46.560
that burden removed, but they would have had a higher initial training cost.

23:46.560 --> 23:50.080
But that would have ultimately worked out to be much better for them, probably.

23:50.080 --> 23:53.040
It definitely wouldn't have been as embarrassing, because this thing has been a public sideshow

23:53.040 --> 23:54.760
now for a decade.

23:54.760 --> 23:59.400
Yeah, and it's not done any favors for Linux and open source generally, has it?

23:59.400 --> 24:04.240
If you think about other governments or whatever thinking about making the switch, this has

24:04.240 --> 24:05.820
got to really put them off.

24:05.820 --> 24:09.280
Even though they don't necessarily drill down into the details and realize they rolled their

24:09.280 --> 24:15.000
own and didn't go with a mainstream distro, it just looks bad generally, doesn't it?

24:15.000 --> 24:19.320
Well it's sure going to give some great quotes for total cost of ownership quotes by Microsoft

24:19.320 --> 24:20.320
salesmen.

24:20.320 --> 24:21.320
I'll give it that.

24:21.320 --> 24:22.320
Yep.

24:22.320 --> 24:27.800
Speaking of surprising the open source community, Apple will no longer be developing CUPS under

24:27.800 --> 24:28.880
the GPL.

24:28.880 --> 24:30.640
This snapped a few heads around this week.

24:30.640 --> 24:35.640
Yeah, they're going to move to the Apache license, which, okay, it's still open source,

24:35.640 --> 24:39.360
it's still free software, so does it really matter?

24:39.360 --> 24:43.680
Well, you've got to kind of look a bit deeper than that, haven't you, to realize why it

24:43.680 --> 24:46.280
ultimately might well matter.

24:46.280 --> 24:49.880
CUPS is the common Unix printing system, and it's been the engine for printing on Linux

24:49.880 --> 24:51.520
for ages now.

24:51.520 --> 24:55.120
And years ago, it was bought by Apple, and everyone always wondered, well, what's going

24:55.120 --> 24:56.440
to happen now?

24:56.440 --> 24:59.760
And they have been, to their credit, pretty good stewards of the project.

24:59.760 --> 25:00.760
It continues on.

25:00.760 --> 25:05.560
They hired the developer full time, they gave him a full time wage to work on CUPS at Apple.

25:05.560 --> 25:10.920
But my understanding has been there have been companies, hardware manufacturers, that have

25:10.920 --> 25:16.080
been knocking on Apple's door and saying, we want to bundle CUPS in our print server.

25:16.080 --> 25:20.680
We want to bundle it right here on chip with our little Ethernet-attached print server.

25:20.680 --> 25:21.800
Can we do that?

25:21.800 --> 25:23.560
And Apple says, is the source code available?

25:23.560 --> 25:24.600
It's under the GPL.

25:24.600 --> 25:30.600
And the hardware manufacturers go, oh, no thanks.

25:30.600 --> 25:32.080
And they go roll their own solution.

25:32.080 --> 25:34.280
What, you think the GPL is that toxic?

25:34.280 --> 25:38.720
I don't think it is, but apparently this is some of these hardware manufacturers' opinion,

25:38.720 --> 25:39.720
based on what I've read.

25:39.720 --> 25:44.760
Yeah, and so the much more permissive Apache license means that they're not going to care

25:44.760 --> 25:45.760
about that sort of thing.

25:45.760 --> 25:48.560
Yeah, it means we're probably going to start seeing embedded CUPS that then doesn't get

25:48.560 --> 25:50.240
updated for ages.

25:50.240 --> 25:54.040
So it's not necessarily going to be a good thing, but it might be better than what we

25:54.040 --> 25:55.040
have now.

25:55.040 --> 25:56.040
Might it, though?

25:56.040 --> 26:01.320
Because isn't the risk here that Apple will create a two-tiered system where they'll have

26:01.320 --> 26:06.680
Apple CUPS, which will be proprietary, but it'll be based on the open source one?

26:06.680 --> 26:10.880
Kind of like with their Bluetooth thing, isn't it, where you've got, it's based on a relatively

26:10.880 --> 26:14.280
open standard of Bluetooth, but then they bundle their proprietary stuff on top to make

26:14.280 --> 26:15.380
it better.

26:15.380 --> 26:21.560
And that's what makes their product a more appealing proposition for people.

26:21.560 --> 26:22.560
We'll see.

26:22.560 --> 26:26.560
I mean, I feel like printing is such a solid industry now.

26:26.560 --> 26:30.560
It's sort of like if we had to just take CUPS that we had today, the GPL version, and Apple

26:30.560 --> 26:33.200
never wrote another line of code, I feel like we'd be OK.

26:33.200 --> 26:37.520
We're like in the Thunderbird situation here, where we kind of know what we got.

26:37.520 --> 26:41.320
We're not really seeing new radical printing devices come on the market that totally change

26:41.320 --> 26:42.320
everything.

26:42.320 --> 26:46.320
CUPS has a lot of runway, even in its current version, tons of things you can do with it.

26:46.320 --> 26:49.120
I feel like we'd be pretty good in this particular position.

26:49.120 --> 26:51.640
Apple can do whatever the hell they want, because at the end of the day, we still have

26:51.640 --> 26:53.520
the code that was licensed under GPL.

26:53.520 --> 26:56.720
Yeah, but we are moving to driverless printing and stuff.

26:56.720 --> 26:58.280
There is innovation still happening there.

26:58.280 --> 27:02.680
And if CUPS doesn't continue to keep up with that stuff, then it could be left behind.

27:02.680 --> 27:03.680
I agree.

27:03.680 --> 27:06.520
And I think the other story here is, what about all the contributors over the years

27:06.520 --> 27:10.480
that have contributed to this project, assuming it would remain GPL?

27:10.480 --> 27:15.040
Was there some sort of contributors agreement that they assigned that said it would be OK

27:15.040 --> 27:16.040
to relicense?

27:16.040 --> 27:17.200
I believe there was.

27:17.200 --> 27:21.400
And is this maybe another opportunity to talk about these contributor agreements again?

27:21.400 --> 27:24.800
Because some of these developers may have contributed code under good faith that it

27:24.800 --> 27:25.800
would remain a GPL project.

27:25.800 --> 27:28.800
Of course, they're the ones that would have signed the agreement.

27:28.800 --> 27:33.600
Well, that's the thing, if you sign the agreement, then faith is the right word.

27:33.600 --> 27:38.160
There is no evidence to prove that it is going to remain under GPL.

27:38.160 --> 27:41.440
So you're signing away your rights to that.

27:41.440 --> 27:44.600
And if you don't like that, then don't sign the document.

27:44.600 --> 27:48.440
I tend to think in this particular story, the sky is not falling.

27:48.440 --> 27:51.760
Because if Apple was going to pull the rug out from underneath CUPS, they probably would

27:51.760 --> 27:53.380
have done it years ago.

27:53.380 --> 27:57.400
And they continued to invest in this project since they purchased it, since they hired

27:57.400 --> 27:58.440
this guy.

27:58.440 --> 28:02.200
I would imagine they're just going to continue investing in it now with a different license.

28:02.200 --> 28:06.720
Because in a way, it's in Apple's best interest for there to be more CUPS users.

28:06.720 --> 28:09.920
Because it means the printing experience on Macs will be better.

28:09.920 --> 28:11.400
Yeah, that's true.

28:11.400 --> 28:15.960
Although, to be fair, these days, who has a printer outside of their office?

28:15.960 --> 28:16.960
Yeah.

28:16.960 --> 28:18.320
But when I do print, I love it.

28:18.320 --> 28:19.320
It feels retro.

28:19.320 --> 28:20.320
I'm like, this is great.

28:20.320 --> 28:21.320
It smells good.

28:21.320 --> 28:22.680
I love the laser printer, Joe.

28:22.680 --> 28:24.560
Well, I've got a laser printer.

28:24.560 --> 28:28.320
And it always worked in Ubuntu 12.04 as Ubuntu 12.04.

28:28.320 --> 28:29.940
And then I updated to 14.04.

28:29.940 --> 28:30.940
And it's never worked since.

28:30.940 --> 28:32.240
I have to boot into Windows for it.

28:32.240 --> 28:33.240
I'm sorry.

28:33.240 --> 28:34.240
Did you say 14.04?

28:34.240 --> 28:35.240
Yeah.

28:35.240 --> 28:36.240
Yeah.

28:36.240 --> 28:37.600
I'm having a real hard time feeling bad for you, Joe.

28:37.600 --> 28:38.600
I'm having a...

28:38.600 --> 28:39.600
No, no.

28:39.600 --> 28:40.600
Well, I'm 16.04 as well.

28:40.600 --> 28:41.600
Oh, OK.

28:41.600 --> 28:45.420
I'm saying since I updated to 14.04, whenever that was, it has just never worked.

28:45.420 --> 28:48.400
And then I updated to 16.04, tried it again, no joy.

28:48.400 --> 28:49.840
You know, this is one of the things I love about CUPS.

28:49.840 --> 28:52.640
If you dig around in the config, you can turn on the web interface.

28:52.640 --> 28:56.520
And you get even way more powerful options, including just manually setting up an IP printer

28:56.520 --> 28:57.520
that's dead simple.

28:57.520 --> 28:59.640
It's a great web interface for CUPS.

28:59.640 --> 29:01.240
It's one of my favorite projects.

29:01.240 --> 29:06.360
And it was one of the original projects that let me set up a ton of Linux boxes at a company

29:06.360 --> 29:10.440
because Windows couldn't handle their print load, and CUPS handled it like a champ.

29:10.440 --> 29:11.440
Yeah.

29:11.440 --> 29:14.840
Well, you can go into dual.config, or you can just quickly reboot into your wife's Windows

29:14.840 --> 29:15.840
7 partition.

29:15.840 --> 29:21.340
