Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, our weekly take on Linux and the open source world.

00:16.200 --> 00:20.320
This is episode 47, recorded on March 31st, 2018.

00:20.320 --> 00:21.320
I'm Chris.

00:21.320 --> 00:22.320
And I'm Joe.

00:22.320 --> 00:23.320
Hello, Joe.

00:23.320 --> 00:27.200
It's good to be connected with you, especially on a week when we have a stacked news docket

00:27.200 --> 00:32.920
and we kick things off with a tablet that's running Chrome OS.

00:32.920 --> 00:39.360
Yeah, this is an Acer tablet, and it's definitely got nothing to do with the Apple tablet that's

00:39.360 --> 00:42.200
aimed at education that came out this week at all.

00:42.200 --> 00:45.720
No, no, absolutely no coincidence in timing here.

00:45.720 --> 00:46.800
Yeah.

00:46.800 --> 00:51.880
So this is a 9.7 inch tablet that runs Google Chrome, but it also supports Android apps,

00:51.880 --> 00:54.000
which they've been working on for quite a while.

00:54.000 --> 00:57.040
And last I heard, weren't very good, really.

00:57.040 --> 00:58.720
So I hope they've improved that.

00:58.720 --> 01:00.000
How much does that matter?

01:00.000 --> 01:03.980
Because this is really aimed at the educational market, isn't it?

01:03.980 --> 01:05.960
It's priced for the educational market.

01:05.960 --> 01:08.840
It's positioned to the educational market.

01:08.840 --> 01:13.280
And that sector, from my own experience with my kids, it's really there about the Google

01:13.280 --> 01:17.600
apps and the Chrome web browser, and you just need the cheapest device possible to run those

01:17.600 --> 01:18.600
things.

01:18.600 --> 01:23.920
But is this the cheapest possible device at $329, the same price as the iPad?

01:23.920 --> 01:26.860
That is where it doesn't quite make sense to me.

01:26.860 --> 01:29.060
What you get spec-wise, it's a good value.

01:29.060 --> 01:35.560
You get 4 gigs of RAM, 32 gigabytes of built-in storage, plus it has eMMC storage.

01:35.560 --> 01:42.760
There's also USB 3.1 Type-C, so you could essentially hook up a thumb drive, microSD

01:42.760 --> 01:46.320
card reader, and a headphone jack all in this device.

01:46.320 --> 01:53.160
That same package, especially if you consider the 5 megapixel camera, the Wi-Fi AC chipset,

01:53.160 --> 01:57.520
it's $499 from Samsung in a traditional Chromebook configuration.

01:57.520 --> 02:03.720
So their $329 price tag, I don't think it's just cutting off the keyboard that got them

02:03.720 --> 02:04.720
to that price.

02:04.720 --> 02:09.280
They're intentionally getting it down to a range that is at least competitive for the

02:09.280 --> 02:10.820
educational market.

02:10.820 --> 02:13.480
If it's a good competitor, I don't know about that.

02:13.480 --> 02:14.560
I'm not so sure.

02:14.560 --> 02:17.960
But the pricing, they seem to be taking a bit of a loss here, at least if you go by

02:17.960 --> 02:21.040
Samsung pricing.

02:21.040 --> 02:24.720
And is Chrome OS even really ready for a touchscreen interface?

02:24.720 --> 02:28.540
I know that a lot of the Chromebooks, the modern ones, have come with a touchscreen,

02:28.540 --> 02:33.920
but it's still an operating system that is very much designed around a keyboard and touchpad

02:33.920 --> 02:34.920
or mouse, isn't it?

02:34.920 --> 02:35.920
Yeah.

02:35.920 --> 02:40.980
I don't have, pardon the pun, hands-on experience with this on Chrome OS yet.

02:40.980 --> 02:45.480
But I do know from following the news for the last few years, they've been slowly adding

02:45.480 --> 02:47.520
more and more touch capabilities.

02:47.520 --> 02:52.880
And to your earlier point, if you're using this thing for Android applications, the touch

02:52.880 --> 02:54.600
support is even more relevant.

02:54.600 --> 02:55.600
Yeah.

02:55.600 --> 02:59.920
We've kind of seen this merging of Chrome OS and Android for quite a while now, haven't

02:59.920 --> 03:00.920
we?

03:00.920 --> 03:03.360
So I wonder which way it's going to shake out.

03:03.360 --> 03:08.160
Is it going to be that they'll end up going completely Chrome OS or completely Android,

03:08.160 --> 03:09.160
I wonder?

03:09.160 --> 03:10.160
Yeah.

03:10.160 --> 03:14.600
It just seems like it'd be easier to focus on one thing, not just from Google's personnel

03:14.600 --> 03:20.520
and investment standpoint, but it'd be nice to have a clear, concise story for school

03:20.520 --> 03:21.520
districts.

03:21.520 --> 03:25.720
Should you be investing in managing Android devices or investing in managing Chrome OS

03:25.720 --> 03:26.720
devices?

03:26.720 --> 03:29.640
Because think about this from the IT admin standpoint.

03:29.640 --> 03:36.760
You have tens of thousands of end users, and you've got five people in your department.

03:36.760 --> 03:37.760
That's the reality.

03:37.760 --> 03:39.500
So how do you manage these devices?

03:39.500 --> 03:41.040
How do you do this at scale?

03:41.040 --> 03:42.480
How do you charge these things?

03:42.480 --> 03:45.200
How do you move them between classrooms?

03:45.200 --> 03:52.120
Tablets, Chromebooks, and iPads all have different answers with different levels of complication,

03:52.120 --> 03:55.260
with different levels of completeness to that whole story.

03:55.260 --> 03:59.680
And I'm not sure if Google is really serving anybody by splitting the narrative here.

03:59.680 --> 04:00.960
But that's what Google does.

04:00.960 --> 04:02.840
They've got how many chat apps?

04:02.840 --> 04:05.040
They always hedge their bets, don't they?

04:05.040 --> 04:07.960
Maybe and maybe in the long term that does work out.

04:07.960 --> 04:12.600
I would bet that this is based on the fact that they've had huge success with Chrome

04:12.600 --> 04:18.520
OS on traditional Chromebooks in classrooms, and there is somewhat of a demand for some

04:18.520 --> 04:23.640
type of tablet touchscreen type device that's extremely portable.

04:23.640 --> 04:28.460
And Google's hoping to capitalize on the existing success and leverage it on these tablets.

04:28.460 --> 04:30.320
It's a little bit ham-fisted, though.

04:30.320 --> 04:34.380
And maybe that's where Apple has a competitive advantage, especially when you start to get

04:34.380 --> 04:36.840
in the same price territory.

04:36.840 --> 04:41.160
But remember, if you have one solution to manage Chromebooks, then you probably can

04:41.160 --> 04:44.280
use that same exact solution to manage these tablets.

04:44.280 --> 04:48.720
And for these understaffed IT departments, that can be extremely valuable.

04:48.720 --> 04:54.200
Well, one solution that they definitely won't be using is Firefox OS, which we knew was

04:54.200 --> 04:58.940
dead but now it is officially 100% dead.

04:58.940 --> 05:03.480
The App Store has been closed down and that is it for Firefox OS.

05:03.480 --> 05:04.480
Rest in peace.

05:04.480 --> 05:07.880
Yeah, it's not just dead for those of us who didn't have a device yet.

05:07.880 --> 05:12.320
But this kind of kills it off for all of you who are still holding on.

05:12.320 --> 05:17.240
But you know, not to pile on to Firefox here, Firefox OS, they had a valiant attempt.

05:17.240 --> 05:20.360
Microsoft hasn't released a Windows phone in years.

05:20.360 --> 05:23.480
Blackberry doesn't release Blackberry OS devices anymore.

05:23.480 --> 05:26.440
They now are focusing on Android devices.

05:26.440 --> 05:29.520
And there's few other smartphone operating systems in existence.

05:29.520 --> 05:33.080
We cover Sailfish X sometimes here on the show.

05:33.080 --> 05:36.160
And we just recently talked about WebOS, but that's not anywhere on phones.

05:36.160 --> 05:42.520
Ubuntu Touch is now living on as an open source project that's also fighting the good fight.

05:42.520 --> 05:46.940
I don't think we can necessarily blame Firefox OS for not succeeding in this market.

05:46.940 --> 05:52.320
It's just simply iOS and Android and their respective ecosystems have it all locked up.

05:52.320 --> 05:56.100
Yeah, but wasn't it supposed to be on TVs and stuff as well?

05:56.100 --> 06:00.600
And we've not seen enough of that to justify keeping this App Store running, it seems.

06:00.600 --> 06:01.600
True.

06:01.600 --> 06:02.600
That's true.

06:02.600 --> 06:07.440
I mean, Firefox OS and other homebrewed operating systems and just the general availability

06:07.440 --> 06:10.580
of the Linux kernel probably solved that problem.

06:10.580 --> 06:14.120
There wasn't anybody really asking for Firefox OS on a TV.

06:14.120 --> 06:16.480
It was never really built properly in the first place, though, was it?

06:16.480 --> 06:20.280
The fact that you couldn't update the browser without updating the whole OS and stuff, it

06:20.280 --> 06:24.320
just seemed to have been put together just badly.

06:24.320 --> 06:29.080
And I'm not surprised at all that it's ended up going this way, the way of all the other

06:29.080 --> 06:30.080
attempts pretty much.

06:30.080 --> 06:35.200
You know, I could still be convinced that a browser that runs all of your apps and your

06:35.200 --> 06:37.600
general desktop shell on a phone is a good idea.

06:37.600 --> 06:40.720
I mean, as long as it's done right, somebody could convince me of that.

06:40.720 --> 06:43.560
So I wouldn't say that necessarily sank it or not.

06:43.560 --> 06:48.000
But to me, it feels like there's a larger lesson for open source projects to take on

06:48.000 --> 06:49.000
here.

06:49.000 --> 06:51.760
And that's one that will surprise no one in our audience.

06:51.760 --> 06:57.680
iOS and Android have this whole market sewn up because they have these incredible ecosystems.

06:57.680 --> 06:59.760
And there is another way to approach this problem.

06:59.760 --> 07:04.200
Like our friends over at Plasma Mobile seem to be doing it in a very humble and steady

07:04.200 --> 07:09.480
approach that may eventually work because there's a lot of us enthusiasts out here that

07:09.480 --> 07:12.000
want an OS we can load on our own hardware.

07:12.000 --> 07:14.200
Well, yeah, same with Ubuntu Touch.

07:14.200 --> 07:15.720
You reports, guys.

07:15.720 --> 07:21.760
That is the way to do it is to be humble and slowly but surely build something that works

07:21.760 --> 07:27.200
really well and not try and have these huge launches and everything like we've seen from

07:27.200 --> 07:29.560
Mozilla with Firefox OS.

07:29.560 --> 07:33.120
So my money is still on Ubuntu Touch, I think.

07:33.120 --> 07:39.080
They're getting rid of scopes now and focusing on getting Android apps running in an inbox.

07:39.080 --> 07:42.240
So I think that it's going to be a big year for them.

07:42.240 --> 07:45.360
I said that in our predictions show and I'm sticking by it.

07:45.360 --> 07:47.920
I'm not quite sure what to make of this next story.

07:47.920 --> 07:53.120
It's either Google oppressing an open source project during a critical moment while they're

07:53.120 --> 08:01.100
trying to establish their identity or it's Google playing softball and appeasing a heavy-handed

08:01.100 --> 08:02.680
copyright lobby.

08:02.680 --> 08:07.140
Yeah, this is Google removing Kodi from autocomplete in the search.

08:07.140 --> 08:14.960
So if you search for K-O-D, then it's not going to suggest Kodi for you or add-ons for

08:14.960 --> 08:18.040
K-O, it's not going to suggest Kodi.

08:18.040 --> 08:20.720
And I think it's probably the latter.

08:20.720 --> 08:28.440
I think that it is Google bowing to pressure from the copyright lobbyists and the whole

08:28.440 --> 08:34.080
entertainment industry that are obsessed with Kodi, like they were obsessed with torrents

08:34.080 --> 08:35.960
and stuff years ago.

08:35.960 --> 08:40.480
Now they've realized that most people who want to watch copyrighted material for free

08:40.480 --> 08:45.360
will do it via streaming and Kodi is one of the biggest ways to do that.

08:45.360 --> 08:51.920
So I suppose if this is all it takes to appease them as far as Google's concerned, then it's

08:51.920 --> 08:53.900
not a huge issue.

08:53.900 --> 08:59.940
But it does speak to this bigger point, doesn't it, that Kodi is basically a toxic brand at

08:59.940 --> 09:02.400
this point, depending on how you look at it.

09:02.400 --> 09:07.440
It's either this amazing way to get loads of free, cool entertainment or if you are

09:07.440 --> 09:12.080
in the entertainment industry, it is a completely toxic word.

09:12.080 --> 09:17.360
But Kodi in of itself, as we always talk about this, is just free open source software that

09:17.360 --> 09:18.640
just plays media.

09:18.640 --> 09:23.920
You have to supply the streams or the media in order to use it.

09:23.920 --> 09:27.160
And in of itself, it's completely harmless.

09:27.160 --> 09:33.360
So they've got this real problem, the XBMC foundation, of what to do about this brand.

09:33.360 --> 09:35.640
I mean, do they have to rebrand again?

09:35.640 --> 09:38.880
They rebranded from XBMC to Kodi.

09:38.880 --> 09:40.360
Maybe that's the only solution here.

09:40.360 --> 09:44.760
You know, that's a good idea, I think, because the open source community will follow.

09:44.760 --> 09:45.760
We'll all understand.

09:45.760 --> 09:48.320
This is a game we've kind of gotten used to.

09:48.320 --> 09:50.800
And this is a weird position that Google is in.

09:50.800 --> 09:54.520
They want to play ball with the companies that they want to sell movies for on Play

09:54.520 --> 09:55.900
and YouTube.

09:55.900 --> 09:57.840
So of course, they have to be accommodating.

09:57.840 --> 10:04.000
And if Google doesn't take action, then Google gets branded as being complicit in piracy.

10:04.000 --> 10:09.800
So their limp-wristed response is, well, we'll just sort of nuke its autocomplete.

10:09.800 --> 10:13.960
You can still type in Kodi and hit Search and still get all the results.

10:13.960 --> 10:18.600
And if you start typing in Kodi, you start to get suggestions for things like Kodak or

10:18.600 --> 10:20.540
Kodiak bears.

10:20.540 --> 10:21.960
It's really awkward.

10:21.960 --> 10:28.760
And I wish Google would take a firmer stance here and say, no, this is an open source platform

10:28.760 --> 10:34.620
that can be used for good or bad, because Kodi really is now in our super hard spot.

10:34.620 --> 10:41.020
They have been aggressively for the last couple of years trying to remove the Kodi name from

10:41.020 --> 10:42.160
piracy.

10:42.160 --> 10:45.120
They've even reached out to the MPAA.

10:45.120 --> 10:50.340
They've taken a very hard stance in public forums denouncing piracy.

10:50.340 --> 10:56.520
They have really gone as far as a project possibly can, even borderline crossing the

10:56.520 --> 10:57.520
line.

10:57.520 --> 11:04.460
In fact, at scale, that was a topic of conversation, is that perhaps the Kodi project is too mean

11:04.460 --> 11:06.840
because they're yelling at people on Twitter about piracy.

11:06.840 --> 11:11.280
Well, is it not hypocritical of them to complain about piracy?

11:11.280 --> 11:19.540
Because let's face it, is anybody using Kodi to watch or listen to anything other than

11:19.540 --> 11:24.080
copyrighted material that they don't have the proper rights to watch?

11:24.080 --> 11:25.080
That's the whole point of it.

11:25.080 --> 11:29.920
Yes, in of itself, it's not doing anything wrong and it's totally legal and all the rest

11:29.920 --> 11:37.080
of it, but I can't think of anyone who uses it to watch anything other than pirated material.

11:37.080 --> 11:43.760
You know what, as far as I know, what they care about are the add-ons that enable streaming

11:43.760 --> 11:45.340
of content.

11:45.340 --> 11:52.320
If you have a big old NAS full of television and movie shows, they don't like that, but

11:52.320 --> 11:56.200
that's not why they're going after Kodi, because they realize you could use VLC to play it

11:56.200 --> 11:59.360
on a TV with a laptop hooked up to a TV screen.

11:59.360 --> 12:05.640
It's the one touch, hit a button, and now you are torrent streaming the latest movies.

12:05.640 --> 12:08.840
What really gets them fired up, and I remember this from last when we were covering this

12:08.840 --> 12:13.680
story on Linux Action News, or I'm sorry, Linux Action Show way back in the day now,

12:13.680 --> 12:20.000
feels like a decade ago, they care about the add-ons that people are selling that come

12:20.000 --> 12:22.320
pre-bundled into a box.

12:22.320 --> 12:28.480
You go buy a NUC or you go buy a media center PC, you hook it up to your TV's HDMI port

12:28.480 --> 12:33.440
and Bob's your uncle, you've got Kodi with this one click, you're streaming torrent movies.

12:33.440 --> 12:34.740
That's what they're upset about.

12:34.740 --> 12:39.520
They think that's going to be the big, big consumer revolution, that consumers are going

12:39.520 --> 12:44.320
to rush out and it's going to be the new VCR, and Kodi is going to be the enabler of a whole

12:44.320 --> 12:46.040
new generation of VCRs.

12:46.040 --> 12:47.160
That's what they think is happening.

12:47.160 --> 12:53.640
If you're streaming it over Samba or NFS or DNLA on your LAN, I don't think they care.

12:53.640 --> 12:57.680
The thing is though that KodiBox is like a name brand at this point.

12:57.680 --> 12:58.920
It's a household name.

12:58.920 --> 13:04.160
I know plenty of normal people who don't know anything about technology, don't even have

13:04.160 --> 13:05.560
a laptop at this point.

13:05.560 --> 13:10.320
They just have a phone and a KodiBox that they bought off eBay or something.

13:10.320 --> 13:13.520
They didn't configure any of the add-ons.

13:13.520 --> 13:18.760
They come pre-loaded or fully loaded or whatever, and that is the reality of the situation.

13:18.760 --> 13:22.400
There are a lot of people, there are probably millions of people out there who have bought

13:22.400 --> 13:26.160
these boxes and are streaming all this content for free.

13:26.160 --> 13:33.320
I would wager there are more users of Plex and there are more customers using Rokus with

13:33.320 --> 13:38.880
Plex installed streaming downloaded television shows than all of the KodiBox users in the

13:38.880 --> 13:39.920
world though.

13:39.920 --> 13:44.320
So if it doesn't stop with Kodi, then where does it end?

13:44.320 --> 13:49.480
Does MB become next and then after MB do they move on to Plex and then after Plex do they

13:49.480 --> 13:50.880
move on to Roku?

13:50.880 --> 13:52.240
Where does this end?

13:52.240 --> 13:58.560
There has to be some sort of rational distinction between the software that's capable of playing

13:58.560 --> 14:04.200
files and has the capability of add-ons just like a web browser versus something that is

14:04.200 --> 14:07.760
pre-built and pre-engineered to steal content.

14:07.760 --> 14:14.360
That's a big difference and going back to the Google point here, Google is complicit

14:14.360 --> 14:20.200
now in branding Kodi as a piracy tool because now they are one more organization that is

14:20.200 --> 14:21.280
shunning them.

14:21.280 --> 14:26.920
They're playing ball with organizations who misunderstand and misrepresent what the Kodi

14:26.920 --> 14:29.680
project is about and that's why it's a shame.

14:29.680 --> 14:34.280
Not because it won't auto-complete anymore but simply because Google didn't take a stance

14:34.280 --> 14:42.320
and defend open source but yet they bang that open source drum on a daily basis.

14:42.320 --> 14:44.320
Lass.ting.com.

14:44.320 --> 14:46.420
It's smarter than unlimited.

14:46.420 --> 14:49.720
If you just use Lass, you pay less.

14:49.720 --> 14:50.720
Lass.ting.com.

14:50.720 --> 14:57.400
Take $25 off a device or if you bring your own, they will give you $25 in service credit.

14:57.400 --> 15:03.800
Now your average Ting bill is just $23 per phone per month because it's pay for what

15:03.800 --> 15:05.280
you use wireless.

15:05.280 --> 15:10.840
$6 a month for the line and then you just pay for your minutes, your messages and your

15:10.840 --> 15:11.840
megabytes.

15:11.840 --> 15:15.200
However much you use, that's what you pay.

15:15.200 --> 15:17.080
It's really, really simple.

15:17.080 --> 15:23.000
That is the entire Ting story, $6 and then there's an Uncle Sam cut there.

15:23.000 --> 15:27.380
What you use, no contract, no service agreement, that's it.

15:27.380 --> 15:30.440
And then it's just like everything on top of it just is better.

15:30.440 --> 15:32.880
Great customer service, you get to talk to real human beings.

15:32.880 --> 15:37.820
The best dashboard in mobile to manage everything from the devices you have active to their

15:37.820 --> 15:40.360
individual services, all of it.

15:40.360 --> 15:43.880
They even have a great app for Android and iOS.

15:43.880 --> 15:47.640
And then my personal favorite feature, although it's something you never have to worry about

15:47.640 --> 15:52.800
with Ting if you don't want, but it's a thing I love, they have a GSM and a CDMA network.

15:52.800 --> 15:53.860
In the States, that's great.

15:53.860 --> 15:58.800
In the Pacific Northwest, there is clear areas where CDMA simply performs better because

15:58.800 --> 16:02.320
of the install, the hills, the trees, all of that.

16:02.320 --> 16:07.400
And when I am traveling, there's areas where GSM just rocks it and I can switch between

16:07.400 --> 16:08.400
them.

16:08.400 --> 16:09.400
My Nexus 6P supports both.

16:09.400 --> 16:10.400
I love that.

16:10.400 --> 16:14.020
You can get a device from Ting directly or bring your own, and because they have those

16:14.020 --> 16:16.480
two networks, there's a ton they support.

16:16.480 --> 16:20.320
Just check out their BYOT page, lass.ting.com.

16:20.320 --> 16:22.320
While you're there, check out their blog.

16:22.320 --> 16:28.080
They have a post right now about Hiya, which helps block unwanted calls on both iOS and

16:28.080 --> 16:29.080
Android.

16:29.080 --> 16:30.080
I installed it.

16:30.080 --> 16:31.080
I love it.

16:31.080 --> 16:32.140
That Ting blog is great.

16:32.140 --> 16:34.640
Just start by going to lass.ting.com.

16:34.640 --> 16:35.640
That's lass.ting.com.

16:35.640 --> 16:44.680
Okay, so we managed to avoid this last week, but the time has come to talk about Facebook

16:44.680 --> 16:49.800
and that whole controversy that went on with Cambridge Analytica.

16:49.800 --> 16:54.440
Now Mozilla have come out with an add-on for Firefox, which somewhat helps protect your

16:54.440 --> 16:58.720
privacy by isolating Facebook in a container.

16:58.720 --> 16:59.960
I think this is pretty neat.

16:59.960 --> 17:05.320
In fact, I almost would want to recommend anybody using Facebook, check this out.

17:05.320 --> 17:09.000
Even if you're typically a Chrome user, I think this is worth checking out.

17:09.000 --> 17:14.000
I think this is a simplification of an extension that I've used before that allows you to sort

17:14.000 --> 17:18.440
of pop different tabs into their own individual containers.

17:18.440 --> 17:19.680
Now let's back up.

17:19.680 --> 17:24.600
This one's focused on Facebook, and it works by isolating your Facebook identity into a

17:24.600 --> 17:29.320
separate container that makes it hard for Facebook to track the visits to other sites

17:29.320 --> 17:31.920
and other things you do on the internet.

17:31.920 --> 17:35.960
Once you install this extension, it deletes your Facebook cookies and it logs you out

17:35.960 --> 17:36.960
of Facebook.

17:36.960 --> 17:37.960
Tried this myself.

17:37.960 --> 17:39.080
That's exactly what happens.

17:39.080 --> 17:45.840
The next time you go to Facebook and you log in, it's all inside this little container.

17:45.840 --> 17:50.340
If you click Facebook share buttons on other browser tabs, it will load them within the

17:50.340 --> 17:52.320
Facebook container.

17:52.320 --> 17:53.520
It's pretty nice.

17:53.520 --> 17:56.400
There are some caveats, some downsides.

17:56.400 --> 18:01.160
It's important for you to realize it doesn't prevent Facebook from mishandling the data

18:01.160 --> 18:03.740
themselves, like that they already have on you.

18:03.740 --> 18:07.260
You're not preventing them from selling your information.

18:07.260 --> 18:11.840
You're just limiting the new information that they can track.

18:11.840 --> 18:18.400
Also if you use Facebook to log into other services on the web, like Facebook login functionality,

18:18.400 --> 18:20.320
that's probably not going to work.

18:20.320 --> 18:22.440
The one tab can't talk to the other tab.

18:22.440 --> 18:24.760
That's the whole point of the container system.

18:24.760 --> 18:29.280
So that's a bit of a bummer if you use Facebook login for some stuff.

18:29.280 --> 18:34.800
Well, jokes on Facebook, I don't use my real name or post any real data on any of my Facebook

18:34.800 --> 18:39.600
accounts, my many different Facebook accounts, which I probably shouldn't admit to having,

18:39.600 --> 18:40.600
should I?

18:40.600 --> 18:45.680
But I'm not going to use this because I just don't need to really.

18:45.680 --> 18:50.880
I don't have any information on there that they could use about me.

18:50.880 --> 18:53.260
None of that information is valuable.

18:53.260 --> 18:57.100
It's more about them tracking you as you go across the web though, because every website

18:57.100 --> 19:00.760
that has a Facebook like, they're now tracking when you visit that website.

19:00.760 --> 19:05.400
If it's got a like button anywhere on the page, then they know you went there.

19:05.400 --> 19:10.360
Yeah, which is pretty scary, which is why I tend to be logged out and I tend to not

19:10.360 --> 19:14.200
really use Facebook on my laptop at all anyway.

19:14.200 --> 19:17.920
I kind of just lurk a little bit on my phone and I definitely haven't installed the app

19:17.920 --> 19:20.400
or the messenger app.

19:20.400 --> 19:25.800
One thing that's interesting is that they've been collecting loads of data by using that

19:25.800 --> 19:28.880
messenger app and they've basically forced you to use the app.

19:28.880 --> 19:32.680
I don't know if you've ever had Facebook messages on the mobile website.

19:32.680 --> 19:34.800
I completely refuse to use it.

19:34.800 --> 19:38.600
I have lots and lots and lots of messages waiting for me.

19:38.600 --> 19:41.920
I get them from family too, but that was just a line too far for me.

19:41.920 --> 19:42.920
Yeah.

19:42.920 --> 19:45.840
Well, you get that notification and then you click it and then it opens the Play Store

19:45.840 --> 19:50.120
and wants you to install the messenger and I'm like, no thanks, but I've got a little

19:50.120 --> 19:51.120
hack for you.

19:51.120 --> 19:55.720
You can do a desktop version of the site and then you can use messenger, very clunky and

19:55.720 --> 19:59.720
stuff, but if you absolutely have to send a message in Facebook on your phone, that's

19:59.720 --> 20:00.720
how to do it.

20:00.720 --> 20:02.840
But yeah, I mean, I'm not a big Facebook user anyway.

20:02.840 --> 20:07.880
It's just something that I lurk and mostly really the only account that I ever really

20:07.880 --> 20:14.160
use is the one to post shows for late night Linux just because there's a small community

20:14.160 --> 20:16.480
there of people who want to use Facebook.

20:16.480 --> 20:21.280
But if you are forced to use Facebook like most people are to stay in touch with family

20:21.280 --> 20:26.760
and friends, then this container add on for Firefox seems like a pretty decent way to

20:26.760 --> 20:27.760
go.

20:27.760 --> 20:28.760
I agree.

20:28.760 --> 20:31.880
And speaking of tracking services, if you have multiple Google accounts or multiple

20:31.880 --> 20:37.000
Twitter accounts or whatever, maybe just check out the multi account container extension,

20:37.000 --> 20:41.380
which I'll link at linuxactionnews.com slash 47.

20:41.380 --> 20:46.440
That is this for Facebook, but for all the things, which I find to be the most useful

20:46.440 --> 20:48.480
because it color codes the tabs too.

20:48.480 --> 20:53.320
So I have one tab for my JB email, one tab for my personal email, and I can do the same

20:53.320 --> 20:54.880
thing with docs.

20:54.880 --> 20:55.960
That's really nice.

20:55.960 --> 20:57.720
And that is the multi account containers.

20:57.720 --> 21:00.960
And it's one of those nice little things that keeps me on Firefox.

21:00.960 --> 21:04.920
I do tend to criticize Mozilla quite a lot, but to be fair to them, they've made pretty

21:04.920 --> 21:09.880
good strides with this containerization stuff in Firefox and Firefox does continue to improve

21:09.880 --> 21:10.880
all the time.

21:10.880 --> 21:12.880
So I've stuck with it all this time.

21:12.880 --> 21:17.840
I'm still not a Chrome user and there's even more reason to stick with it now.

21:17.840 --> 21:19.640
So well done, Mozilla.

21:19.640 --> 21:22.800
The Oracle and Google case is not dead yet.

21:22.800 --> 21:27.600
My co-host on Coder Radio described this as the tech franchise that just keeps coming

21:27.600 --> 21:29.580
back into theaters.

21:29.580 --> 21:33.520
And I got to say, Google, I totally told you so.

21:33.520 --> 21:36.040
I hate to do it, but I told you so.

21:36.040 --> 21:37.040
Yeah.

21:37.040 --> 21:39.000
Where do we start with a nearly 10 year old case?

21:39.000 --> 21:43.120
I mean, you've been following this since the early days of Linux Action Show, haven't you?

21:43.120 --> 21:44.120
Yeah.

21:44.120 --> 21:49.200
Really since it began, I've been following this story and it started out really clearly

21:49.200 --> 21:50.200
in Google's favor.

21:50.200 --> 21:55.960
In fact, in 2010, Oracle sued Google and the open source community exploded.

21:55.960 --> 22:00.920
And Google won all their claims in 2012 and it emboldened everybody.

22:00.920 --> 22:06.240
And it wasn't until later when Oracle appealed the claim and sent it back to the federal

22:06.240 --> 22:13.240
circuit that emails were released from Andy Rubin and others within Google that clearly

22:13.240 --> 22:20.480
showed they evaluated all available technologies and determined that Java would be best and

22:20.480 --> 22:23.180
that they needed to license it.

22:23.180 --> 22:29.200
From that moment, I knew Google had a far, far shot of winning this thing because Oracle

22:29.200 --> 22:35.160
has them dead to rights in emails internally saying, we need to license this sucker.

22:35.160 --> 22:39.280
And they have emails where they say, we've got to go with Java because we're behind the

22:39.280 --> 22:40.920
ball on this.

22:40.920 --> 22:44.360
And if we're going to catch up to Apple and the iPhone, we've got to use something that

22:44.360 --> 22:45.920
has tons of developers already.

22:45.920 --> 22:46.920
So we've got to use Java.

22:46.920 --> 22:49.320
Yeah, but they've re-implemented most of it, didn't they?

22:49.320 --> 22:54.000
It was just some of the APIs that they reused and that's what this case boils down to.

22:54.000 --> 22:55.000
Yeah, exactly.

22:55.000 --> 22:59.020
In 2016, actually, the second jury that looked at this whole thing found that Google's use

22:59.020 --> 23:05.320
of the structure and sequence and the organization of 37 Java APIs was fair use.

23:05.320 --> 23:06.320
And that's where we're at now.

23:06.320 --> 23:10.880
So Oracle appealed that and this week, the Federal Circuit ruled that, yeah, Oracle's

23:10.880 --> 23:11.880
right.

23:11.880 --> 23:14.120
There's things in here that are clear copy and paste.

23:14.120 --> 23:17.720
And there's a couple of sections early on where it appears that Google even grabbed

23:17.720 --> 23:24.560
like the comments from the original Java source code and just copy and pasted it.

23:24.560 --> 23:29.680
They cleaned it up later on, but of course, it was all published, so they did some sleuthing

23:29.680 --> 23:33.480
and they found that early source code where there was line for line copies.

23:33.480 --> 23:35.120
Yeah, it doesn't look good for Google.

23:35.120 --> 23:39.940
I knew that this was going to be overturned a couple of years ago when the jury found

23:39.940 --> 23:42.700
that it was fair use because it's not fair use, is it?

23:42.700 --> 23:48.900
It's blatant copying of APIs which were proved to be copyrightable.

23:48.900 --> 23:52.160
And it was just this idea of whether it was fair use or not.

23:52.160 --> 23:53.840
And it just didn't seem like it at the time.

23:53.840 --> 23:57.200
And I knew an appeal would happen and I knew it would get overturned.

23:57.200 --> 24:01.600
So I think this is going to end up costing Google a lot of money.

24:01.600 --> 24:05.960
And the thing is, it's not a popular thing to say that Google are going to lose and Oracle

24:05.960 --> 24:11.120
are going to win this because Oracle are not a popular company within the open source community.

24:11.120 --> 24:15.980
But you can't change the facts here that they are basically in the right.

24:15.980 --> 24:21.600
And they have those emails from folks running Android at the time clearly seeing that, yeah,

24:21.600 --> 24:26.320
we need to license this and Andy Rubin himself said, yeah, I did see that email.

24:26.320 --> 24:28.720
So that's a tough thing to beat around.

24:28.720 --> 24:35.920
I do kind of think at a larger sort of bigger picture perspective here that Google may actually

24:35.920 --> 24:40.680
have a bit of a claim like this is such a common technology that you have claimed is

24:40.680 --> 24:44.360
a worldwide resource like you yourselves position it as that.

24:44.360 --> 24:48.880
You sort of in your own marketing justify why it is fair use for us to use these APIs.

24:48.880 --> 24:57.000
I can see that perspective if it wasn't for the conniving right out in the clear in their

24:57.000 --> 24:59.760
emails, Google may have a much better case here.

24:59.760 --> 25:02.240
Yeah, well, we'll see what comes of this.

25:02.240 --> 25:08.200
But to me, there has always been one very clear winner in this whole situation.

25:08.200 --> 25:10.200
And that is the lawyers.

25:10.200 --> 25:12.160
They are cleaning up on this.

25:12.160 --> 25:17.680
Well, and for something completely different, if not a bit unexpected, Microsoft just made

25:17.680 --> 25:23.160
it easier and open source for you to ship your own distro on top of the subsystem for

25:23.160 --> 25:24.160
Linux.

25:24.160 --> 25:31.740
Yeah, so before the actual code to make your Linux distro run on the subsystem was proprietary,

25:31.740 --> 25:38.480
but now they've published an example bit of code, which really facilitates anyone who's

25:38.480 --> 25:41.960
got a distro to make it run on WSL.

25:41.960 --> 25:45.640
And then you can easily sideload it onto your own system.

25:45.640 --> 25:51.280
But to put it out there into the public, you have to get it into the Microsoft App Store,

25:51.280 --> 25:56.280
which does require them to review it and make sure that everything's working properly.

25:56.280 --> 26:00.000
Yeah, you have to ask for permission to get it in the bigger App Store.

26:00.000 --> 26:02.720
And I bet that's going to be pretty limited.

26:02.720 --> 26:05.760
But they do make facilities available for you to load it yourself.

26:05.760 --> 26:10.840
So if you are your own distro maintainer, or you knew how to make a distro that you

26:10.840 --> 26:15.400
really loved work on this, you could still load it on your own instance of Windows.

26:15.400 --> 26:19.820
But it's interesting that they talk about needing permission to get into the App Store.

26:19.820 --> 26:26.300
Does that suggest that the likes of SUSE and Fedora and Kali Linux requested it themselves

26:26.300 --> 26:28.900
rather than Microsoft approaching them?

26:28.900 --> 26:30.920
It kind of implies that to me.

26:30.920 --> 26:35.700
It does imply it a bit, and maybe after Ubuntu was announced, maybe that is the case.

26:35.700 --> 26:41.400
But my initial read on all of those announcements was it was an invite, because Microsoft led

26:41.400 --> 26:43.080
the announcement in those cases.

26:43.080 --> 26:44.480
Yeah, I suppose so.

26:44.480 --> 26:46.880
Maybe I'm just trying to cook up some conspiracy bacon there.

26:46.880 --> 26:47.880
I like it though.

26:47.880 --> 26:48.880
You know me.

26:48.880 --> 26:49.880
I love some good bacon.

26:49.880 --> 26:50.880
Yeah.

26:50.880 --> 26:52.480
But do you think we're actually going to see more distros now then?

26:52.480 --> 26:55.960
Do you think anyone else is interested in being on the subsystem?

26:55.960 --> 26:56.960
Yeah.

26:56.960 --> 26:57.960
Oh, I'm sure.

26:57.960 --> 26:58.960
I bet.

26:58.960 --> 27:02.120
And I think you'll also see a lot of folks just do this to their own favorite distro.

27:02.120 --> 27:06.280
So say you wanted something that wasn't in there today, and they make this available

27:06.280 --> 27:09.400
for you to side load it, as they put it.

27:09.400 --> 27:10.400
Why not?

27:10.400 --> 27:11.400
Why not do it?

27:11.400 --> 27:12.400
I would do it.

27:12.400 --> 27:16.120
If I was stuck on Windows and I had to manage a bunch of Linux boxes, I'd totally do it.

27:16.120 --> 27:19.560
Especially if I was like some Gentoo guy or something, and we had all these Gentoo systems.

27:19.560 --> 27:21.000
Who would ever load Gentoo in production?

27:21.000 --> 27:22.160
I don't know.

27:22.160 --> 27:24.880
That person would have to be a crazy younger version of myself.

27:24.880 --> 27:27.800
And I would totally want Gentoo in my Windows system to manage it.

27:27.800 --> 27:28.800
Yeah.

27:28.800 --> 27:33.160
And I wonder if this opens the door a little bit closer to getting BSD running on it.

27:33.160 --> 27:37.960
I know it's a very big technical challenge to do it, but I'm sure someone out there must

27:37.960 --> 27:39.120
be trying to do it.

27:39.120 --> 27:41.400
Yeah, at least one person must want that.

27:41.400 --> 27:43.480
Yeah, maybe Alan wants to get it going.

27:43.480 --> 27:48.440
Well, if Alan Jude manages to pull that off, or any other interesting things develop in

27:48.440 --> 27:51.760
the open source world, and of course with Linux, we'll tell you about it right here

27:51.760 --> 27:53.240
