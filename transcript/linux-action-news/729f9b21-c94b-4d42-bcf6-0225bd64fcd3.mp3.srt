00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,560
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, our weekly take on Linux and the open source world.

2
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:22,000
This is episode 99, recorded on March 31st, 2019. I'm Chris.

3
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
And I'm Joe.

4
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,600
Hello, Joe. Good to be connect with you on Lucky 99. And we start out with some new software

5
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:28,600
from Mozilla.

6
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:34,320
Yeah, Firefox Lockbox has come to Android. And that allows you to sync your passwords

7
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:38,840
over from the desktop. And I've tried it out and it works pretty well.

8
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:45,160
This is another one of those was a test pilot. And then they launched it on iOS. On iOS,

9
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:50,860
they recently updated it to be more iPad friendly, as they say. And now we have it on Android.

10
00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:55,400
So I guess the value proposition here is, if you've already invested in saving all of

11
00:00:55,400 --> 00:01:01,800
your passwords in Firefox, this now abstracts them out essentially from Firefox. So it utilizes

12
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:06,520
that same password database, synchronizes it to the lockbox, you log in with your Mozilla

13
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:10,720
account, and Bob's your uncle, there's all your passwords from Firefox. And on these

14
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:15,160
mobile platforms, you can opt to also turn on autofill. So it will autofill apps and

15
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:16,960
other websites from other browsers.

16
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:20,800
Yeah, I tried out that autofill feature. And that worked absolutely perfectly. I was very

17
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:22,960
impressed with this generally, I must say.

18
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:27,040
And much like LastPass and other password managers that are out there, although lockbox

19
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:31,600
is a little simpler than a lot of what's out there, that might actually be kind of appealing

20
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:38,460
because it's not like too much. But for me, it's definitely not enough. And they're pitching

21
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:43,000
this at complete newbies to password management. Like in their blog post, they write, say goodbye

22
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,860
to the password cheat sheet. Store it as a note or a contact in your phone or maybe written

23
00:01:47,860 --> 00:01:52,240
on a sticky note on your desk. Like you're no longer doing the under the keyboard thing.

24
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:53,240
That's who they're pitching this at.

25
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:58,780
Oh, yeah, definitely. But I think one reason to switch to it from LastPass is the fact

26
00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:03,200
that it is open source. Unfortunately, it's not on F-Droid yet. So you do need the Play

27
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:08,080
Store to install it. But I'd rather use something that I know is open source and comes from

28
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:15,400
a trusted organization like Mozilla than LastPass, which they've had some breaches in the past

29
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:20,920
and I don't know, I just don't trust them somehow. Whereas I'm very tempted to start

30
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:21,920
using this.

31
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:25,480
But I really can't disagree with any of that. I would say if you haven't been using a password

32
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:30,520
manager, this might be a decent place to start, especially if you're a heavy Firefox user.

33
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:37,160
For me, I've been using LastPass now for so long that I disabled the built in Firefox

34
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:43,920
password manager. And so I have like a total of five passwords saved in my Firefox password

35
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:50,360
database and everything else is in LastPass. So this service has not a lot of intrinsic

36
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:55,480
value to me because I've already been using LastPass for so long. And there's a lot of

37
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:58,840
other good alternatives out there as well, like key pass and many others that people

38
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:03,840
could tell us about at linuxactionnews.com contact that I really feel like this is aimed

39
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:08,920
at the new to password management market that are heavily invested in Firefox, which is

40
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:13,600
a pretty narrow niche. But going back to your point, I do really like that this is open

41
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:14,600
source.

42
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:18,260
Yeah, and I think this is something that Mozilla should be spending money on. Some of the stuff

43
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:21,960
they've done before is a bit questionable, but I think this is very useful. And the tight

44
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:27,280
integration with Firefox means that it is actually really useful for people. And it

45
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:32,720
means that you can use Firefox on the desktop. You don't necessarily even have to use Firefox

46
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:38,760
on Android to take advantage of this because most people use apps for everything. So it

47
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:42,200
seems like the kind of thing I want to see them doing.

48
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:48,240
So let's talk about something Google is doing that I'm not yet sure how I feel about this.

49
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:52,480
They're bringing AMP to email, of course, starting with Gmail.

50
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:58,160
Of course with Gmail. So AMP accelerated mobile pages, which was originally a way to make

51
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:02,400
websites that were really stripped down and worked really quickly on mobile. But the features

52
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:07,320
have crept in and crept in. And now they're putting this into email. It was announced

53
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:13,080
about a year ago, and it's taken this long to be fully rolled out. And it's just something

54
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:20,840
that I'm not interested in at all. I don't even like HTML emails really. Never mind rich

55
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:26,800
features like carousels and being able to vote in polls and interact with emails. I

56
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:33,520
want emails to be just a plain text document really. I want just some facts in that email

57
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:37,980
and maybe some links that I can then click through. But the whole point of it is to make

58
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:41,320
it simpler, make it so that you don't have to click through.

59
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:46,600
So I think some people will like it. But for me, it just seems like emails fine. Don't

60
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:47,600
mess with it.

61
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:53,320
Google pitches this as turning email into a surface to get things done, which is pretty

62
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:59,780
broad. Another way to say is it's a way to turn emails more into apps without using a

63
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:06,440
ton of JavaScript. So this is a reduced version of the AMP spec specifically for email. We'll

64
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:10,360
have a link in the show notes if you want more information. And there are a considerable

65
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:14,400
amount of security considerations that have been put into this.

66
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:17,880
So let's talk about what Google is trying to do here. The way Google frames this is

67
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:23,980
that there is a movement for interactive emails that is being driven by large corporations

68
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:28,600
that want to have more engaging emails. And there's all these different competing ideas.

69
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:34,200
And so this is their suggestion. And from a high level, the advantages it offers is

70
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:38,120
real time content in emails like you could have flight information that's updated in

71
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:43,840
real time or news stories or weather that is updated real time in an email thread. You

72
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:48,080
could bring in other components. Google has partners they brought on like Pinterest and

73
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:52,760
others that will have dynamic content that updates in the email. It sounds like a nightmare

74
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:57,400
to me personally. However, Google's version of future is this is coming whether you want

75
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:58,400
it or not.

76
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:02,640
That is a reasonable argument. I suppose that if it's going to happen, then at least make

77
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:08,080
it an open standard and have it all be open source and everything. But I'd rather that

78
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:11,760
they just said no, we're not going to stand for this. Gmail is one of the biggest if not

79
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:16,480
the biggest email platforms in the world. And they could just say we're going to block

80
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:21,520
all of this HTML and JavaScript stuff, rather than encouraging it like this. But I suppose

81
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:25,160
then, ultimately, people may start switching away. And that's probably what they're worried

82
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,160
about.

83
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:30,920
One of the things that I admittedly thought this would be for would be so that way Google

84
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:35,840
could guarantee a way to deliver rich ads in email because right, I mean, that seems

85
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:42,200
like one of the things you would want a more interactive email experience to have is advertising.

86
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:47,100
But when you look at the AMP for email spec, they specifically removed the advertising

87
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:53,200
portion of the AMP spec. It's not allowed in AMP for email. And on top of that, if you

88
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:58,200
want to send one of these emails to a Gmail user, you have to go ask permission from Google

89
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:03,080
directly. And they have a whole series of verifications you have to go through and steps

90
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:06,800
you have to take to send AMP emails to Gmail users.

91
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:10,720
How long is it going to be before adverts slip into this, though? Because originally

92
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:15,520
AMP didn't have any adverts. And then eventually, they added that feature. And they've made

93
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:20,520
a bit of a song and dance about the fact that this doesn't have adverts in it. But it's

94
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:22,120
surely a matter of time.

95
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:26,960
I should think so. And AMP still has the original issues that we have with AMP. And that is

96
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:30,800
that is controlled primarily by Google. I admit they set up that new council, but that

97
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:36,920
council is still pretty much controlled by Google. And I'm not comfortable with this

98
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:43,480
very heavy handed using the leverage of Gmail. And they've partnered up with outlook.com

99
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:49,240
and mail.ru to also support AMP emails. So they're using this very large market lever

100
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:54,760
to really essentially force a standard onto everybody. And email used to be the one last

101
00:07:54,760 --> 00:08:00,240
remaining decentralized standard and protocol we have. Anybody could set up SMTP and IMAP

102
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:04,920
and POP3 or whatever the hell they want and have their own mail server. I don't recommend

103
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:09,400
it, but anybody could do it. But now we're beginning to see a shift where at least a

104
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:14,600
portion of the content of an email is going to be centrally controlled by one corporation.

105
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:19,400
Well, not necessarily, because they're not changing the way email works. They're adding

106
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:25,360
to it. And so this will be optional. And you can still send plain text emails to each other

107
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:30,400
without this. And I don't think they're ever going to stop that happening. And maybe you'll

108
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:34,880
just get a link to the content or whatever if your client doesn't support it. So I think

109
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:36,680
people will be able to just block this.

110
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:39,920
Yeah, they're going to have to have a fallback mode. You're right. Because a lot of people

111
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:44,120
just have plain text turned on on their mail client. And so there will have to be some

112
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:49,360
sort of fallback system. And I think what I'm getting at is Google's going to have,

113
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:55,320
they could if this takes off, have a very critical part of what becomes modern email.

114
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:59,280
They could really kind of own that. And maybe you could argue they already do with Gmail,

115
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:06,240
but I don't know, this just feels different. If you could just hit the reset button and

116
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:12,360
do AMP over again, it almost makes more sense in this context, especially in its more restricted

117
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:17,820
mode. You could kind of see like, start here, start with AMP for email and then over time

118
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:23,240
grow it to the web. Because I think undoubtedly part of it is my biases I have about AMP for

119
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:28,600
the web and how that's been bad for publishers, like ourselves, has influenced how I view

120
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:32,480
AMP for email. When it actually seems like it could be, especially when you watch some

121
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:37,600
of Google's videos, a pretty usable product, or at least one that you could see a lot of

122
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:42,840
companies would want to use. I don't know if I want it, but when you see their product

123
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:46,360
demonstrations, it's clear there's going to be market demand for something like this.

124
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:50,880
Well, I think you've almost hit the nail on the head there in that it's solving a problem

125
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:54,040
that doesn't exist. It's companies wanting to solve this problem.

126
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:55,040
Yes.

127
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:59,160
And it will appeal to them. But I don't think it's necessarily going to appeal to consumers,

128
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:01,400
because it's certainly not appealing to either of us.

129
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:07,000
I already hate my email. I don't want it doing more things. I don't need the weather updated

130
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:12,560
in my email. And I realized that was just a really cute example they had. But I'm perfectly

131
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:16,560
okay with just getting the link to go get the most relevant information. And I'm good

132
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:22,480
with that. And I'd like to keep email as clean and simple as possible. Then it's easier to

133
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:27,520
encrypt. It's easier. It's more standards compliant. But I doubt I'm going to get my

134
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:29,520
wish on that one, Joe.

135
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:33,880
Yeah. All right. Well, things have been happening in Ubuntu land this week.

136
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:38,360
Yeah. I have gotten my wish on one thing, and that is performance improvements and stability

137
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:44,040
improvements to the GNOME Shell Stack. And these are very apparent in the new Ubuntu

138
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:48,320
19.04. We wanted to give a quick rundown of a couple of these because there's some big

139
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:52,080
progress that's going to be trickling down to a lot of the new distribution releases

140
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:53,600
starting right here.

141
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:58,840
GNOME Shell 3.32, it's going to be shipping with Linux kernel 5.0, and a bunch of other

142
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:05,640
new things. I've been running it for two months now, I think. A month and a half at least.

143
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:10,520
And it's the fastest, most reliable GNOME experience I've ever had.

144
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:16,560
And now they've reached this beta milestone, beta one. It's really looking ready to ship,

145
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:17,560
isn't it?

146
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:21,680
Yeah. We don't normally talk about betas on this show. But with Linux 5.0 in there and

147
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:27,120
the new release of GNOME Shell, I think this is going to be a milestone release, like I

148
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:30,840
said, of all of the distributions of this next generation of 2019.

149
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:34,680
But it's not just the main version of Ubuntu, of course. All the other flavors have released

150
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:42,720
their beta one of 19.04. But Ubuntu Mate has released a beta of 18.04 for the Raspberry

151
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:43,720
Pi.

152
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:47,200
And I've been checking this out and it's pretty solid. It's got hardware accelerated VLC,

153
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:52,400
a proper Ubuntu kernel, so it's not sharing the Raspbian kernel like it used to. And that

154
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:58,280
old 16.04 image was pretty neglected at this point. It didn't really work properly. Firefox

155
00:11:58,280 --> 00:12:02,800
wouldn't open and stuff. It was just broken. So it is good to see that that project hasn't

156
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:08,040
been abandoned. And it's great to see that we've got a good competitor to Raspbian, which

157
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:15,040
now is very mature and a really solid OS for the Raspberry Pi. But competition is always

158
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:19,440
good and choice is always good. So I would say if you've got a Pi, definitely check it

159
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:24,480
out. We'll have a link to it in the show notes, linuxactionnews.com slash 99. And stick it

160
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:26,040
on your Raspberry Pi and see what you think.

161
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:32,080
Yeah. I'd love to hear people's take on it. Also, ffmpeg got hardware assisted video decoding

162
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:38,080
and encoding, which is huge on a device like this. That's a big deal. And something else

163
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:42,800
that Martin included that I think is genius is Steam Link is available for install now

164
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:48,940
on 1804 running Ubuntu Monte. That's great. I mean, it kind of makes me want to hook one

165
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:55,760
up to my TV with VLC having hardware decoding and ffmpeg having hardware decoding and Steam

166
00:12:55,760 --> 00:13:00,960
Link. I don't know. That actually starts to turn into a pretty competitive media system

167
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:01,960
too.

168
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:05,400
The only issue, though, is that there's no acceleration in the browser yet. That's something

169
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:10,840
he's been working on. But yeah, unfortunately, it's not there. So browsing is a bit of a

170
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:15,640
painful experience. But if you're only looking to the media stuff with it, then it's pretty

171
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:16,640
solid.

172
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:22,800
Well, speaking of media stuff, the Ubuntu Studio flavor also was recognized again officially

173
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:27,480
as a flavor. And two of the developers that applied for their upload rights to Ubuntu

174
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:32,080
Studio's core packages received permission to do so. So business continues as usual.

175
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:36,760
Yeah, there was some doubt about that because the team had changed and it just looked like

176
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:40,720
it may lose its official status. But good to see they've managed to sort that out and

177
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:41,720
it's going to continue.

178
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:46,640
Well, speaking of business as usual, Red Hat continues to make money. It looks like they

179
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:51,860
are finally crossing that three billion dollar revenue line. In fact, if you do the math,

180
00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:55,360
it is looking like it might be three point four billion dollars.

181
00:13:55,360 --> 00:14:00,080
Yeah, suddenly the IBM acquisition makes a lot more sense, doesn't it? I mean, as I said

182
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:03,720
at the time, they didn't buy them for a laugh. They bought them because they're a money making

183
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:04,720
machine.

184
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:10,000
Yep, I completely agree. And who says that open source can't make any money? This is

185
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:14,640
really something. And Jim Whitehurst, the CEO, attributes enterprise organizations as

186
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:21,960
a continued source of growth as they convert their environments to hybrid cloud environments.

187
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:26,520
Jim's favorite buzz term. And he also said their subscription service is up. It continues

188
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:31,240
to grow. OpenStack and OpenShift continues to be an area of growth for them, even though

189
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:35,960
the buzz is kind of those things are on their way out. And they're investing more into Kubernetes,

190
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:42,160
as everyone says. But the final bit of information here, Joe, is that the deal with IBM is due

191
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:48,080
to close in the second half of this year. So that means any time, I guess, between June

192
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:52,360
and December 31st, it could be anywhere in there.

193
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:57,080
Yeah, that's nice and vague. I wonder if it'll be before Thanksgiving or not.

194
00:14:57,080 --> 00:15:00,960
We should bet. I'll bet before. Do you want to take after or do you want to take before?

195
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:02,640
Because I'm going to bet before Thanksgiving.

196
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:05,560
I will bet after. I think it'll be right at the end of the year.

197
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:10,080
Now I feel bad. Now I want the other bet. All right. Let's see. What should we bet?

198
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:12,280
We got to bet something.

199
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:17,680
I know what we can do. Whoever loses has to go first with the Bitcoin predictions.

200
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:22,680
Okay. All right. Fair enough. Okay. All right. That seems fair. Okay. Well, let's talk about

201
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:27,520
the big news out of LVFS. We love talking about the Linux vendor firmware service, think

202
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:32,680
it's great for new users and potentially for servers in the future. But they have a big

203
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:33,680
announcement this week.

204
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:38,360
Yeah, they've joined the Linux Foundation. So yet another project that's done that.

205
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:42,160
The way that the folks involved in the project that are talking about it, it sort of sounds

206
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:50,120
like this is a way to vendor neutralize this fairly important service that could potentially

207
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:55,200
in the future expand into updating the server space and become even more critical that it's

208
00:15:55,200 --> 00:16:02,280
vendor neutral. I think the concern was that by some it was seen as a Red Hat project.

209
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:08,780
And I wouldn't also discount the long term Dell involvement with since the very beginning

210
00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:14,560
of this project. Even till now, Richard considers one of the Dell engineers has been involved

211
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:21,840
Mario, like a co-creator of the project. He's been so involved. And they have a close relationship

212
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:22,840
with the Linux Foundation.

213
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:26,720
Well, there were two things that stood out about this to me. One is that the firmware

214
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:31,200
files are distributed as cab files, which is just funny. But the other thing is that

215
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:39,160
they have now reached 500,000 downloads per month from the LVFS project, which is a lot

216
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:40,160
of machines.

217
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:44,720
Yeah, that's in the last month. That's in the last month. And the other way to say that

218
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:52,080
is 500,000 modern Linux desktops with machines that have updatable firmwares connected and

219
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:56,440
updated. That's a decent chunk of people. Because not everybody's running the absolute

220
00:16:56,440 --> 00:17:00,680
latest stuff or using GNOME software very much. And not everybody has a machine that

221
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:05,480
can be updated by LVFS yet. So I'm impressed with that number, especially for the last

222
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:10,840
30 days. It seems like Richard was talking about this. It seems like whenever the project

223
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:15,360
gets some news coverage, the downloads go up. And there's been a lot of news coverage

224
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:16,800
around joining the Linux Foundation.

225
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:20,600
Yeah, I suppose people start checking their software center and go, actually, I can update

226
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:22,160
my various firmwares here.

227
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:27,180
Yep. It's still open source. Richard's still at the helm. It's still a Python Flask project.

228
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:32,520
You can still go get involved. It's just they're trying to make it vendor neutral now. And

229
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:36,480
my reading of that is it's a positioning for a long term play.

230
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:41,120
I think you need to have a service like this to gain wide industry adoption and to be taken

231
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:46,280
seriously. And so joining the Linux Foundation kind of gives it that extra credibility as

232
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:47,280
well.

233
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:54,080
I don't know, Joe. Needs more blockchain, in my opinion. Joking, of course. I love LVFS.

234
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:59,060
But speaking of in it for the long term, Handshake has been making a lot of donations to open

235
00:17:59,060 --> 00:18:05,280
source projects. And it appears kind of recently, rather quietly, they made a pretty significant

236
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:07,080
contribution to Debian.

237
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:13,200
Yeah, $300,000, which is an awful lot of money given that Debian usually gets an order of

238
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:16,160
magnitude less than that donated to it every year.

239
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:20,940
Yeah. And the project says, and I think this is very true, I'm very happy to see this,

240
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:25,480
they say it's going to help them continue to replace old failing hardware. They have

241
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:30,640
a whole migration plan that the Debian system administrators have written up, which includes

242
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:35,800
reloading and renewing servers, replacing components, just making the workflow a little

243
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:40,120
easier for their developers, which we've talked about recently on some of our shows. That

244
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:44,520
all sounds like very, very positive long term improvements to the project.

245
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:48,360
And because they've been contributing to all these different projects over the last year

246
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:52,160
or so, you hear about Handshake a lot, but you might not remember what it is. Just a

247
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:58,640
quick recap. It's a decentralized permissionless naming protocol that is, guess what, compatible

248
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:05,200
with DNS. And the idea is taking away root DNS servers that are centrally controlled

249
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:10,520
and moving it to a peer to peer system that is, as you also guessed, powered by blockchain.

250
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:15,440
However, it does seem to be a very cool project. And I do like the idea of decentralized root

251
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:19,680
DNS servers that is still completely compatible with the DNS protocol. That seems pretty clever

252
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:20,680
to me.

253
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:25,120
That wasn't clear to me whether these donations to the various free software projects had

254
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:30,680
been in actual cash, or whether it just been in cryptocurrencies. But doing a little bit

255
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:35,200
of digging, it seems that it is cash, they will be getting some cryptocurrency as well.

256
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:38,760
But this 300,000 is actual cash, by the looks of things.

257
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:44,600
Oh, huh. Yeah, we had tried to get that answered in the past by various projects that have

258
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:49,280
been involved with contributions. And they were a little reluctant to answer that before.

259
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:50,960
So it's a combo thing.

260
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:55,620
By the looks of things, I mean, it's not completely clear. But from digging around and watching

261
00:19:55,620 --> 00:19:59,200
various YouTube videos and reading various articles, that's the conclusion I've come

262
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:03,520
to. But it would be good to get some clarification from the various projects.

263
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:08,760
That's true. They say USD, but they could just be saying in value of. Handshake writes

264
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:14,280
that they've gifted nearly $10.2 million to various floss projects. And they say it's

265
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:21,760
10.2 million in USD. They're not saying crypto. Although I think famously a lot of their initial

266
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:25,720
funding did come from various crypto sources. So I think that's where some of the speculation

267
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:26,720
comes from.

268
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:32,640
Yeah. It's funny that this money is essentially investment that they needed to enable them

269
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:38,320
to have a valuation that was true, but they didn't actually need that investment. So they

270
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:45,120
decided to re-gift it at $10 million. It's a lot of money. And I suppose who's to complain?

271
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:50,040
All these free software projects are benefiting from it. But it just seems all a bit strange,

272
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:51,040
doesn't it?

273
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:55,800
Mm-hmm. But they really picked some good projects. You can search the tags on our site. Just

274
00:20:55,800 --> 00:21:00,620
search the site for Handshake. And there's lots of great projects they've been contributing

275
00:21:00,620 --> 00:21:05,760
to now. So they keep picking good ones. And Debian absolutely could put that money to

276
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:14,320
good use. And that's nothing to sneeze at, 300,000 US greenbacks. So at this point, I

277
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:18,600
don't know if a blockchain-based DNS, a decentralized thing is ever going to take off, but hats

278
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:21,640
off to Handshake for their awesome contributions to the community.

279
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:25,800
Yeah, definitely. Well, before we get out of here, a quick mention for the UK Open Source

280
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:33,160
Awards 2019. And this is happening on the 12th of June in Edinburgh. And it's not just

281
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:37,080
the awards, it's kind of an afternoon into evening event where there'll be some speakers

282
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:38,640
and it's kind of a conference as well.

283
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:44,180
Right. And you can still nominate, they say categories are five and it's companies or

284
00:21:44,180 --> 00:21:49,000
individuals which in the last year have shown exceptional innovation in free and open source

285
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:54,200
software. And they have different categories for like public, company, individual, etc.

286
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:57,600
Link as always in the show notes or in your podcast player of choice.

287
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:01,840
I'd like to go up there for this, but I'm not sure about scheduling yet. So fingers

288
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:02,840
crossed on that one.

289
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:08,800
Hmm. It probably depends if they're going to have an open bar or not.

290
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:09,800
Very good point.

291
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:13,400
