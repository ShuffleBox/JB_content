00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,400
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, episode 163, recorded on November 15, 2020.

2
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:10,400
I'm Chris.

3
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:11,400
And I'm Wes.

4
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:12,400
Hello, Wes.

5
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:13,400
Let's do the news.

6
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:18,760
And let's start with a fix landing for Ubuntu users that allowed standard users to gain

7
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:20,400
root access.

8
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:25,000
We're finding this out from a blog post by Kevin Backhouse, a researcher over at GitHub

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,400
who describes an astonishingly straightforward way to escalate privileges on Ubuntu.

10
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:34,720
With a few simple commands in the terminal and a few mouse clicks, a standard user can

11
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:38,040
create an administrator account for themselves.

12
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:42,160
The first series of commands triggered a denial of service bug in a daemon called account

13
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:46,920
service, which, as its name suggests, is used to manage user accounts on the computer.

14
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:53,240
To do this, Backhouse created a symlink that linked a file named.pam environment to slash

15
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:59,320
dev slash zero, changed the regional language setting, and sent account service a sig stop

16
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:00,780
signal.

17
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:04,840
With the help of a few extra commands, Backhouse was able to set a timer that gave him just

18
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:08,760
enough time to log out of the account before account service was crashed.

19
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:13,520
And when he does this just right, Ubuntu would restart and open a window that allowed the

20
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:19,000
user to create a new account that, you guessed it, had root privileges.

21
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,240
Backhouse said that Ubuntu uses a modified version of the account service that contains

22
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:26,840
code that's not necessarily included in the upstream version.

23
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:30,800
That extra code looks at that pam environment file in the home directory.

24
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:35,600
By making a file that symlinks to dev0, pam environment gets stuck in an infinite loop.

25
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:42,080
There's also a second bug, and that bug involved a hack that resided in the GNOME display manager,

26
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:46,020
which among other things manages the user session and login screen.

27
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:50,120
The display manager, which is often abbreviated as GDM3, also triggers the initial setup of

28
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:54,000
the OS when it detects there is no users that currently exist.

29
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,900
Yeah, that was the problem, Chris.

30
00:01:56,900 --> 00:02:00,800
We've all seen that setup screen when you're first configuring your computer on a GNOME-based

31
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:01,800
system.

32
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,960
If you don't have any accounts, well, you need to set one up.

33
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:08,520
Unfortunately, what happens here is GDM tries to do a talk to account service to check like,

34
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:10,880
hey, are there any users on the system?

35
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:15,240
But the code, well, there's a small problem in that the variable is already set to false

36
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:16,800
is are there users?

37
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:21,400
And since that call never completes, that variable never gets changed to true, and it

38
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:23,640
just shows you that screen right away.

39
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:24,640
OK.

40
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:29,560
Yeah, and in fact, Backhouse says that he discovered these essentially by accident.

41
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:34,400
The Ubuntu account service issue was fixed on November 3, and the GNOME desktop issue

42
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:37,960
was patched a day later on November 4.

43
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:43,720
The vulnerability only impacted desktop users, and it required access to the GUI.

44
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:47,600
So not necessarily easy to exploit in most cases.

45
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:52,040
I suppose that that said, you could be a maniac like me and occasionally install a desktop

46
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:55,280
environment on your server, but not most.

47
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:59,600
Most people don't normally do that, but sometimes I find it handy, actually.

48
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:01,840
So install your patches.

49
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:06,960
According to the Ubuntu notes, all releases from 16.04 LTS to the most recent 2010 were

50
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:10,380
affected, and the team cranked that out and got that fix out.

51
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:11,380
So go get them installed.

52
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:16,280
You know, I do think this is kind of noteworthy just in that these days, most vulnerabilities,

53
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:20,120
you know, they require some code knowledge, some trickery, some complicated setups of

54
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:24,120
memory, state, and corruption, and this was all just done by basic Linux commands in the

55
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:26,960
terminal in the GUI, which is kind of interesting.

56
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:30,440
I should also stress here that the author points out that, you know, he spent a lot

57
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:34,480
of time recently looking for bugs in Ubuntu, and you shouldn't take this to mean that Ubuntu

58
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:35,480
is filled with bugs.

59
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:36,480
That's not his experience.

60
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:40,440
He looked for a lot and happened to find this one by accident, but there's a lot of eyes

61
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:42,880
here, and in general, it's secure.

62
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:47,640
It seems like it was actually relatively easy to surface in certain scenarios, but you really

63
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:52,120
have, you had that situation with GDM that perhaps the Ubuntu development team didn't

64
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:56,560
even consider, because that's such an edge case there, where, you know, GDM comes up

65
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:01,880
and it wants to be super helpful, and then in that environment, it leads to a problem,

66
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:04,260
but it's good to see everything fixed.

67
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:06,960
Those of you in the industry may be familiar with Proxmox.

68
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:12,320
Well, they've just released an open-source, Debian-based enterprise backup solution.

69
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:15,240
We are big fans of Proxmox here at Jupyter Broadcasting.

70
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:19,280
Used it for years, and it's been a bit, but we were just talking about trying it again,

71
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:22,940
and this backup server news might just be the excuse we need.

72
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:27,440
If you're not familiar with Proxmox, it's a virtualization suite that supports really

73
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:33,680
two ways to run your workloads, either something container-based with LXC or full virtualization

74
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:39,120
with KVM, and then on top of that, it includes a web console, command line tools, a REST

75
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:44,580
API for third-party tools, and some really high-end enterprise features that you need

76
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:45,580
with virtualization.

77
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:47,440
Now, it's been around for about 12 years.

78
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:51,840
It started in April in 2008, and this is a nice addition to this.

79
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:55,600
This backup server looks pretty cool, and I like that it's based on Debian.

80
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,600
Yeah, all right.

81
00:04:56,600 --> 00:05:01,160
So the Proxmox backup server is based on the latest Debian Buster release, and it's powered

82
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:04,320
by the long-term supported Linux 5.4 kernel series.

83
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:09,120
It also uses powerful open-source technologies like ZFS on Linux for advanced file system

84
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:11,080
and volume management.

85
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:15,360
It supports things like incremental backups, data deduplication, compression, and authenticated

86
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:16,360
encryption.

87
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:17,600
And Chris, you'll like this.

88
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:22,920
Using Rust as an implementation language guarantees high-performance, low-resource usage, and a safe, high-quality

89
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:23,920
code base.

90
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:24,920
Well, at least in theory.

91
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:25,920
It must be.

92
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:26,920
No, it must be.

93
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:29,600
It's proven because it's Rust.

94
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,240
This is nice to see this.

95
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:35,520
There are various subscription models available with Proxmox and the backup server.

96
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:39,200
Obviously, if you're running this thing in production, that's always recommended you

97
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:43,480
get access to the enterprise repository and support, so it's probably pretty important.

98
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:47,800
But the cool thing about Proxmox and why we wanted to mention it here in the show is it's

99
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:51,720
also free for you to go download and use fully featured for the most part.

100
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:56,160
You don't get access to some of the enterprise updates and obviously the enterprise support,

101
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:00,520
but you can get a real sense of what's possible with this virtualization suite, and you can

102
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:04,840
take a headless Linux box and turn it into like a closet VM machine.

103
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:09,500
Or here in the studio, we used to run encoding systems on it, and a lot of the things we

104
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:14,960
transitioned to the cloud, we first ran here locally on-premises, and Proxmox is just a

105
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:15,960
great way to do it.

106
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:18,280
So this backup server is pretty nice to see.

107
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:23,440
The incremental backups means that you're gonna have the minimum amount of transfer

108
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:30,120
for these VMs, which means maybe even WAN backups might be possible.

109
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:34,680
Data deduplication, I should say, compression, and authenticated encryption are also available.

110
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:40,280
So that to me is speaking like this is seriously something maybe even for offsite VMs.

111
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:41,280
I gotta play with it.

112
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:45,520
Yeah, I mean, I think having ZFS built right in, I would probably use that to roll my own

113
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:46,800
backup server anyway.

114
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:50,500
And so you can either adopt this standalone if you just need a backup server, and here's

115
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:51,880
a great open source offering.

116
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:56,240
But if you're already using Proxmox virtualization solution, this just integrates right in, right?

117
00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:00,800
It makes it super simple through the web GUI to go back everything up, take snapshots,

118
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:03,720
restore from those snapshots, and it seems pretty nice.

119
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:06,880
And of course, we've been talking about this in the context of virtual machines, but with

120
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:10,440
Proxmox, it's good to keep in mind that it supports containers.

121
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:14,520
So the Proxmox backup server will also support backing up your containers.

122
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:16,160
Yeah, it gets fancier than that.

123
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:20,560
They even have support for granular restore where you can do file level restore of container

124
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:21,560
backups.

125
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:26,200
Even better, they've got some interesting items on their roadmap, including LDAP and

126
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:29,520
Active Directory authentication and two factor support.

127
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:33,160
Support for backing up other solutions, things like their mail gateway, or actually backing

128
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:37,240
up the Proxmox host itself to the backup server.

129
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:40,520
And what I'm excited for, tape support.

130
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:46,640
Now as a final note, Proxmox backup solution is AGPL, and we'll have links to everything

131
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:52,480
we've talked about here, including their Git repository in our show notes.

132
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:54,080
Linode.com slash land.

133
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:57,960
Go there to get a $100 60 day credit towards your new account.

134
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:00,680
Linode is our server hosting provider and they can be yours too.

135
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:05,400
They provide virtual servers that make it easy and affordable for you to host anything

136
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:06,540
in the cloud.

137
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:09,640
They have native SSD storage on these virtual machines.

138
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:14,820
So you get really fast disk IO and Linode costs 30 to 50% less than major cloud providers

139
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:18,320
like AWS or Google Cloud or Azure.

140
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:21,440
And they've been around three years before AWS started.

141
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:23,080
They started with a love for Linux.

142
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:25,060
They saw what KVM could do.

143
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:28,600
They saw what the Linux kernel user mode could do and all of that.

144
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:30,480
And they've built something around it that's pretty special.

145
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:33,240
And as the years have gone on, they've made it better and better.

146
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:35,940
They're independently owned and they're founded on a love for Linux.

147
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:40,880
And because they got started in this thing so early on, they were able to build a diverse

148
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:43,820
flexible network powered by Linux.

149
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:47,960
They just recently, I think on like November 9th, put up a blog post that talks a little

150
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:52,460
bit about their networking model and why it's particularly useful for developers that need

151
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:55,900
really low latency high speed connections between their servers.

152
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:58,460
They got data centers in 11 places around the world.

153
00:08:58,460 --> 00:09:01,800
So there's probably ones either close to you or close to your client.

154
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:05,560
You combine that with the high speed disk and the nice high end systems that you can

155
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:08,360
get and you can have something extremely high performance.

156
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:10,640
But maybe you need something approachable.

157
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:12,680
Well they have systems that start at $5 a month.

158
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:18,400
You want to host a portfolio or a blog or a website that you could even back with object

159
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:21,020
storage so it's crazy super fast.

160
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:22,080
All of that's available.

161
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:26,780
And when you go to linode.com slash LAN, you get that $100 60 day credit.

162
00:09:26,780 --> 00:09:27,920
You can really try it.

163
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:29,160
You can really see what it's capable of.

164
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:30,960
Maybe build yourself a VPN box.

165
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:35,640
I've been asking people to tweet me at Chris LAS what they do with their Linodes and I've

166
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:40,340
heard some really cool stories about how people can use SSH to do amazing things.

167
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:43,200
And a $5 a month rig is perfect for that.

168
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:47,640
And like myself I heard from someone who set up a Minecraft server for their kids on Linode.

169
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:49,100
Also really great for that.

170
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:51,640
Check out linode.com slash LAN to get started.

171
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:54,360
You go there, you support the show, it lets them know you heard about it here and it gets

172
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:57,340
you that $100 60 day credit.

173
00:09:57,340 --> 00:09:58,340
Go there.

174
00:09:58,340 --> 00:09:59,340
Check them out.

175
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:00,340
See what they have.

176
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:01,960
And also by the way, Linode's often hiring.

177
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:06,280
Go to linode.com slash careers to see if they have a job position that might fit you.

178
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:08,200
There could be a great opportunity there.

179
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:13,520
Linode.com slash LAN receive a $100 60 day credit, support the show and much more.

180
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:16,920
Linode.com slash LAN and thanks to Linode for sponsoring Linux Action News.

181
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:22,360
I don't know if you heard Chris, but Bitcoin, well, it's up again.

182
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:23,360
It's outrageous.

183
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:28,440
Yeah, we talked about PayPal and their eventual support for Bitcoin.

184
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:29,560
Well guess what?

185
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:30,880
It's already here.

186
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:35,520
The CEO of PayPal noted too with the announcement of it going live that the shift to supporting

187
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:40,340
crypto was driven what he sees by inevitable drift towards virtual currencies.

188
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:46,640
But like you touched on, Wes, every time the price comes up, people start getting Bitcoin

189
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:47,640
crazy.

190
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:51,320
Here's a sample of a little mainstream coverage of a very technical topic.

191
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:55,040
PayPal cashing in on the crypto craze, a payment company announcing a new feature that will

192
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:59,200
allow users to buy, sell and hold crypto currencies, including Bitcoin.

193
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:03,600
The news any Bitcoin soaring more than 7 percent to its highest level of the year.

194
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:07,520
And our next guest is a crypto pro who says PayPal just gave a major stamp of approval

195
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:09,440
for the entire crypto space.

196
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:12,280
Joining us now is coinshare's chief strategy officer, Melton Demurers.

197
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:13,560
Melton, great to see you.

198
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:14,560
It's been a while.

199
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:15,560
It has been a while.

200
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:16,560
I feel like Bitcoin's exciting again.

201
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:17,560
So here we are.

202
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:18,560
It's great to be back.

203
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:19,560
Here we are.

204
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:25,040
In fact, we have the Bitcoin bug back up in the corner because it's gotten so exciting

205
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:26,040
now.

206
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:27,960
Gotta have that live price tracker, Wes.

207
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:28,960
Of course.

208
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:29,960
Yeah.

209
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:34,680
And so PayPal has has gone live with its support as it as it said it would.

210
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:36,480
There's there's, of course, some gotchas in there.

211
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,760
PayPal's in this to make money after all.

212
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:41,360
And so there's transaction fees and whatnot.

213
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:42,360
Yeah.

214
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:46,960
And actually, in an interesting twist, your coins can't really leave PayPal.

215
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:47,960
So you can hold them.

216
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:48,960
You can buy them.

217
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:52,520
You can trade them back into, you know, into the currency of your choice, but you can't

218
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:53,520
take them with you.

219
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:54,520
Yeah.

220
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:55,520
Yeah.

221
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:59,600
And like global support from PayPal, I don't think really comes until 2021.

222
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:03,360
So it's sort of limited in the rollout at this point.

223
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:11,440
And for to say nothing about using Bitcoin to actually pay PayPal merchants, that's also

224
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:12,800
a ways off still.

225
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,000
But it's kind of getting there.

226
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,480
I mean, I guess I guess this is early days.

227
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:20,720
So they have time to kind of hone this just right.

228
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:23,760
You also just have to figure for a company like PayPal, they've got to figure out a hold

229
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:28,840
such a volatile currency and represent that information accurately to users.

230
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:32,820
Could you imagine people who are not really familiar with this to the point that we just

231
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:33,820
heard from that clip?

232
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:35,320
The excitement is ridiculous.

233
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:40,480
I actually got a telegram from my mom last night asking me if I was familiar with the

234
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:44,560
cryptos and if I was if I was following any of the cryptos.

235
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:45,880
Everybody's talking about it again.

236
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:48,520
As we record, it's just below 16,000.

237
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:50,800
It was over 16,000 this weekend.

238
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:55,520
And it seems to be like an annual tradition, like every year as we approach the end of

239
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:59,280
the year, Bitcoin just goes crazy on this and we talk about it here on the show.

240
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:01,560
And here we are again now because of PayPal.

241
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:04,120
And this is adding in some ways a lot of legitimacy.

242
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:08,280
I mean, you heard in that clip to to people who are in the financial markets, a company

243
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:13,200
like PayPal getting behind something like this is a serious nod of legitimacy and approval

244
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,760
and brings it a little bit more to the mainstream.

245
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:17,080
Now I think that's the key.

246
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:20,280
If you're already interested in crypto currencies, you already have Bitcoin of your own.

247
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:23,860
You're probably not going to go use PayPal solution, at least at the moment.

248
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:26,360
But many folks already have a PayPal account.

249
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:27,360
I know.

250
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:28,360
I know I do.

251
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:29,360
And that makes it pretty easy.

252
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:33,240
You just got to go set up their PayPal cash account so you can actually store cash there,

253
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:37,080
transfer some stuff from your bank and then you can just buy Bitcoin or Ethereum or Bitcoin

254
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:38,080
cash or Litecoin.

255
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:40,540
Man, 2020 is a weird year.

256
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:44,560
What's nice to see about this, though, is and this will be a differentiator as time

257
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:45,560
goes on.

258
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:49,100
PayPal has received the first conditional bit license from the New York Department of

259
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:54,200
Financial Services, which is one of the most hawkish subnational financial regulators in

260
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,200
the US.

261
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:58,320
So many have noted that the fact that it got that's a good sign and the PayPal's crypto

262
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:02,240
services would entail coins that are bought on the platform and would not be able to leave.

263
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:06,400
And that may be tied back to this conditional bit license.

264
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:11,760
We will see it may be a compromise they had to make to bring crypto currency to a wider

265
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:13,740
audience on the PayPal platform.

266
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:20,220
And if that is a limit of their conditional bit license, that could have long term limiting

267
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:22,080
effects on what the service is capable of doing.

268
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:24,360
I think, you know, there are some things in their favor there.

269
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:28,480
And at least at the moment, Bitcoin seems to be more of a, you know, a store for value

270
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:32,120
differentiator in your portfolio than it is really for buying things in the street day

271
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:33,120
to day.

272
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:34,120
True, true.

273
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:38,560
So we've talked about Bitcoin, but there's also Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash and Litecoin support,

274
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:40,120
I believe, in PayPal as well.

275
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:41,120
Indeed.

276
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:42,720
So it's not all just one crypto.

277
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:46,800
And you obviously are not in direct control of your private keys.

278
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:50,000
PayPal doesn't give you access to your cryptocurrency keys.

279
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,000
So you're not going to be able to take them out of PayPal and store them in your own wallet.

280
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,480
And that's something people should be aware of.

281
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:58,320
Yes, it's very much if you're going to get into this, you're doing it on PayPal's terms.

282
00:14:58,320 --> 00:14:59,320
Yeah.

283
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:01,640
Otherwise, you're gonna have to learn some more technical solutions.

284
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:05,480
Well, some breaking changes may be inbound to system D 247.

285
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:08,840
Funny enough, though, it all stems from a kernel change in 4.14.

286
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:11,260
Yeah, that long ago.

287
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:15,980
It was a change designed to allow user space to handle devices that needed a little bit

288
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:18,960
of help before they could become fully functional.

289
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:24,280
To do that, the kernel added two new event types called bind and unbind.

290
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:25,280
Why is that a problem?

291
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:30,620
Well, it all comes down to Udev, which unfortunately has an assumption built in that there will

292
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:35,200
only be one event associated with, say, plugging in a new device.

293
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:39,040
And well, with two new events, that's no longer true.

294
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:42,560
At first, system D did have a short term fix.

295
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:45,080
But that was just to ignore the new events.

296
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:48,440
And obviously, that was never going to be a long term solution.

297
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:50,560
They have now come up with a long term solution.

298
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:55,280
But unfortunately, some parts of that solution have some unfortunate implications for users

299
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:56,880
with custom Udev rules.

300
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:57,880
Yeah.

301
00:15:57,880 --> 00:16:04,800
So we seem to have two fixes and the first fix is a change in how tags will work for

302
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:05,800
Udev.

303
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:10,040
Now, if you're not familiar, tags are special properties that can be attached, then matched

304
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:13,280
in subsequent rules or consumed by user space.

305
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:18,360
So rather than attaching tags to events, as is currently done, Udev will start attaching

306
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:23,240
them to devices so that tags added in response to, say, an add event will still be there

307
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:27,320
when that second bind event shows up and you won't lose all the state and you won't be

308
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:30,980
in a confusing place where your device didn't actually initialize successfully.

309
00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:31,980
That's nice.

310
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:38,520
Then there's that second fix, which may affect people with custom Udev rules, something that's

311
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:40,800
going to probably cause distribution some work.

312
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:41,800
Right.

313
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:45,200
So you've got all these Udev rule sets, which can match on these tags, perform actions after

314
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:47,460
devices are added or removed.

315
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:51,460
The problem here is that a lot of these rules were written under the assumption that no

316
00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:53,700
new event types would be added.

317
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:58,200
So anything that wasn't recognized as adding or modifying a device, well, that could just

318
00:16:58,200 --> 00:16:59,940
be ignored.

319
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:03,000
That's not the case now, and that's where the breaking change comes in.

320
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
We need new rules.

321
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,440
They're going to have to write new Udev rules.

322
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:07,440
Exactly.

323
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:08,440
Wilson, break.

324
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:12,680
Everyone's quick to jump on the system to hate train, but they're actually saying this

325
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:13,780
one's not on us.

326
00:17:13,780 --> 00:17:18,360
This is actually technically on the kernel and that change that happened at 4.14.

327
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:21,980
Was this a violation of the kernel's no regressions rule?

328
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:25,320
The answer must almost certainly be yes.

329
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:31,000
Food that worked with the 4.13 kernel no longer worked with 4.14, but what should have been

330
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
done about it?

331
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,440
Well, that's a bit less clear.

332
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:34,440
Yeah, indeed.

333
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:37,100
And the other thing is, is it was kind of hard to track this one down.

334
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:40,740
This is one of those funny things about open source software development.

335
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:48,040
The bug was first reported on KDE's Bugzilla, not to the kernel team, not to system D, but

336
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:52,360
on the KDE Bugzilla, and you can kind of see how that would take a while to work its way

337
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:53,360
through the process.

338
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:56,600
Yeah, I mean, it was almost a year later by the time it made it to the kernel mailing

339
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:57,600
list.

340
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:02,240
And by that time, 4.14 had been anointed an LTS release and distributed by distributions.

341
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:06,720
Yeah, and the kernel team may be ultimately responsible.

342
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:11,740
I mean, I guess the system D team could make that call here because of the change in 4.14,

343
00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:16,680
but I think what it really has underscored is maybe not who's at fault, but how to keep

344
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:22,040
all of these teams in sync and properly communicating because they each have their own mailing list,

345
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:25,920
but that's not really the place for this style of collaboration, because if you zoom out,

346
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:31,480
what we have here is a bug that was caused by the kernel a long time ago that impacted

347
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:37,800
the way system D behaved, which is forcing a breaking change for Udev.

348
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:42,480
And then ultimately users who are relying on these Udev rules, and it's a big, messy,

349
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:47,640
complicated ecosystem, but fundamentally we're all working on that same system, and we would

350
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:53,160
probably have an easier time of it if we could talk things through a little bit more.

351
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:57,760
Linux.ting.com, go there to get $25 off a device, or if you bring a device, and you

352
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:00,800
probably can, you'll get $25 in service credit.

353
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:02,360
And rest assured, Ting's going to have you covered.

354
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:06,280
They have three nationwide networks you can pick and choose from, which means they support

355
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:07,960
a lot of devices too.

356
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:10,280
Ting is really simple mobile that just makes sense.

357
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:13,960
It's a fair price for however much you talk, text, and however much data you use.

358
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:16,080
If you use less, you pay less.

359
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:19,600
I'm on Wi-Fi during the day, so Ting makes a lot of sense for me.

360
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:22,840
And when you combine the nationwide coverage, it means there's a lot of options when I travel.

361
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:25,160
And the brilliant thing about Ting is their dashboard.

362
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:27,920
They have the best dashboard in the industry.

363
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:29,800
You can take control of your entire account.

364
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:31,720
You can see your usage at a glance.

365
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:35,200
You can set usage alerts, which I think is pretty great.

366
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,800
And let's talk devices.

367
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:40,360
With Ting, the BYOD options are crazy with their three network support.

368
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:42,360
So go to linux.ting.com.

369
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:46,880
Support there, support the show, get that $25 credit, and then click on the Check Your

370
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:47,880
Phone link.

371
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:52,720
When you click on that, you'll plug in your phone's IM, EI number, put it all in there.

372
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:54,320
They'll tell you if you can bring it over or not.

373
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:55,800
It's really simple.

374
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:59,640
And you can get that simply off your phone by doing star pound zero six pound.

375
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:02,880
And then you get that number, you put it in the website, see what you can do.

376
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:06,600
Of course, you can buy devices from Ting directly as well or get a SIM card.

377
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:08,520
Ting has all of these really nice features.

378
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:11,440
And you might wonder, what is it about Ting that makes it possible?

379
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:13,160
Well, they're an MVNO.

380
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:14,840
Are you familiar with that?

381
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:16,920
It's a mobile virtual network operator.

382
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:19,320
They ride on top of several networks.

383
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:21,420
So they don't have to worry about building the towers.

384
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:22,980
They can focus on customer support.

385
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:24,800
They can focus on high value.

386
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:27,120
They really have something special here.

387
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:32,760
70% of MVNO customers that were surveyed recently said they were extremely happy with their

388
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:35,520
service and pricing, satisfied or very satisfied.

389
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:38,520
And Ting is at the very top of that stack.

390
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:40,000
Nobody doesn't like Ting.

391
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,320
MVNOs are pretty great.

392
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:42,840
And Ting is the top.

393
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:44,500
They're the one that they're the leader.

394
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:45,500
Everybody follows Ting.

395
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:46,800
So you should check them out.

396
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:48,080
They really get the pricing right.

397
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,120
They get the options right.

398
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:50,880
And they nail the support.

399
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:52,760
Linux.ting.com.

400
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:57,460
Go there, try them out and see why people love using Ting and see if your phone's compatible.

401
00:20:57,460 --> 00:20:58,920
And then you have no contract.

402
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:00,480
You just pay for what you use.

403
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:01,860
Great price.

404
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:03,280
Use less, pay less.

405
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:05,380
That's the brilliant thing about Ting.

406
00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:07,240
That's Linux.ting.com.

407
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:09,840
Thanks to Ting for sponsoring Linux Action News.

408
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:16,160
And thanks to everyone who supports the show by going to linux.ting.com.

409
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:22,200
KDE and Pine64 are announcing today the imminent availability of the new PinePhone KDE Community

410
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:23,200
Edition.

411
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:24,200
Hmm.

412
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:25,200
Very interesting.

413
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:27,560
And I think we're all pretty familiar with Plasma Mobile.

414
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:31,700
As you know, it's a direct descendant from KDE's successful Plasma desktop.

415
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:36,560
And there's some underlying technologies that drive both the desktop environment and the

416
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:37,560
mobile environment.

417
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:40,520
There are things in there like KDE Connect, which obviously lets you connect your phone

418
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:44,880
to your desktop, Ocular for document reading, Wave for music playing, and a bunch of other

419
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:48,760
apps that work both in phone mode and in desktop mode.

420
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:53,200
Now of course, the idea of having mobile devices that can display a full workstation desktop

421
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:57,120
when connected to a monitor, keyboard, and mouse has been around for years.

422
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:59,400
Hey, don't call it convergence.

423
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:04,460
And both the KDE Community and Pine64 have been working to make it a reality.

424
00:22:04,460 --> 00:22:08,320
The PinePhone handset itself is also ready for that convergence.

425
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:12,880
You can use any USB-C dock to connect it to an extra USB device like mouse, keyboard,

426
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:13,880
storage.

427
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:17,120
You can also connect it to external monitors or even a wired network.

428
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:21,180
And in fact, the three gigabyte version of the PinePhone already comes with a dock that

429
00:22:21,180 --> 00:22:26,200
provides two extra USB ports, a full size HD video port, and an RJ-45.

430
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:30,120
Yeah, I love the idea of having Ethernet on my phone.

431
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:32,340
On your phone.

432
00:22:32,340 --> 00:22:35,760
This also comes at a nice time for Plasma Mobile in general.

433
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:40,800
Michael Larbrel over on Pharaonyx has a nice write-up about some of the niceties that are

434
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:47,840
landing in Plasma Mobile here towards the end of 2020, kind of polishing things off.

435
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:49,280
And they've worked hard on this.

436
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:53,520
And they just put out a report, an October 2020 report, outlining all of the strides

437
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:55,520
they've made in like the last month and change.

438
00:22:55,520 --> 00:23:00,240
Yeah, some of those nice accomplishments are stuff like support for task switcher thumbnails.

439
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:05,320
That's always nice, tweaks to the task panel appearance, and a whole bunch of refactoring

440
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:08,400
for their spacebar, SMS, and MMS handling application.

441
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:14,400
Yeah, so the PinePhone is kind of becoming the go-to for community firmwares and different

442
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:17,360
desktop, sorry, phone environments.

443
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:18,360
That's a tricky one.

444
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:23,500
But what's nice about the Plasma Mobile version is we haven't seen a lot of these environments

445
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:25,400
that are Qt-based.

446
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:28,740
And Plasma seems like they've really put a lot of work into this mobile version.

447
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:33,320
So you finally get to see some hardware that's really going to showcase this desktop environment.

448
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:38,280
And for those of you who aren't huge GTK fans, you've got something non-GTK to throw on a

449
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:39,400
device now.

450
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:43,440
But if it doesn't work for you, you've still got all of the other OSs that you can load

451
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:44,440
on the Pine 64.

452
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:45,960
It's just an SD card swap away.

453
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:47,840
Hey, that's the power of Linux.

454
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:52,740
Well, from the next billion dollar industry file, we have some more eBPF news.

455
00:23:52,740 --> 00:23:58,200
Some things are coming out because eBPF Summit just wrapped up a couple of weeks ago.

456
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:05,200
And just a few days ago, Cillium announced a massive $29 million Series A financing round

457
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:08,720
backed by Anderson Horowitz, Google, and Cisco.

458
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:13,320
And what's kind of unique about Cillium and great about them is they're early adopters

459
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:15,880
and heavy users of eBPF.

460
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:21,280
Cillium is an open source project that's been designed on top of eBPF to address the networking,

461
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:26,840
security, and visibility requirements of container workloads, especially our friend Kubernetes.

462
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:32,000
It provides a high level abstraction on top of eBPF that basically lets Linux kernel better

463
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,640
integrate with these Kubernetes workloads.

464
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:36,340
That's probably getting more and more important.

465
00:24:36,340 --> 00:24:42,820
And during a Q&A session after Greg Cache's talk at the Linux application summit that

466
00:24:42,820 --> 00:24:48,120
just happened this last weekend as we're recording this, Greg Cache said something that caught

467
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:49,120
our attention.

468
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:54,280
He said, out of all of the technologies as the kernel's number two, as the commander

469
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:59,200
Riker of the Linux kernel, out of all of the technologies he's excited about, eBPF has

470
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:00,200
got to be one of the top.

471
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:01,200
All right.

472
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:05,720
eBPF, if you care about networking and networking control planes and stuff like that, and tracing

473
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:10,880
and modifications of the kernel as it runs, eBPF is great.

474
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:12,840
You don't have to write kernel modules anymore.

475
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:14,760
You don't have to write drivers anymore.

476
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:16,200
You can do some really cool stuff.

477
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:18,960
eBPF just keeps getting better and better.

478
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:19,960
There's more.

479
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:23,520
There's an eBPF conference last week.

480
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:24,920
So go look at the notes for that.

481
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:26,560
There's a book now about it.

482
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:30,200
It changes all the time in the kernel, but it's really, really, really good.

483
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:34,700
If I was buying and selling kernel stocks in new technologies for the Linux kernel,

484
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:37,280
this would be one I'd be, buy, buy, buy.

485
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:40,720
I know where I'm investing my Bitcoin.

486
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:44,760
There was one other technology that he was really super excited about, but I'm going

487
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:50,840
to save that clip for this week's Linux Unplugged, where I also have an Epic Dell laptop review.

488
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:53,840
So once you get done listening to Linux Action News, make sure you save a little bit of room

489
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:56,860
for Linux Unplugged, because it's going to be a good one this week.

490
00:25:56,860 --> 00:25:59,980
But that does bring us to the end of this week's Linux Action News.

491
