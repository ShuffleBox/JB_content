00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,080
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, our weekly take on Linux and the open source world.

2
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:20,640
This is episode 61, recorded on July 8th, 2018.

3
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:21,640
I'm Chris.

4
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:22,640
And I'm Joe.

5
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:23,640
Hello, Joe.

6
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:27,240
It's good to be connected with you from the Linux Academy offices.

7
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:31,280
I've commandeered one of their recording booths to get into some news with you.

8
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:36,120
And let's start with the huge story that everyone is still talking about all week long.

9
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:37,560
SUSE has been acquired.

10
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:43,160
Yes, for $2.5 billion by a company called EQT.

11
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:48,520
Yeah, EQT is buying them from Microfocus, who's owned them for a little bit now.

12
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:52,000
And the language around the whole announcement is super positive.

13
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,680
What I call an acquisition, they're calling a partnership.

14
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:59,920
And it sounds like EQT is interested in really kind of keeping things the way they are with

15
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:05,400
SUSE only doubling down on perhaps some talent and hiring and investing in certain areas

16
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:07,240
that they think SUSE is primed to grow.

17
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:08,800
I'm not sure what those areas are.

18
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:10,480
They don't really call those out.

19
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:14,600
But the language suggests that this is a really positive move for SUSE.

20
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:20,720
It's funny that when I think about SUSE, I don't think about a kind of fashionable distro,

21
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:27,480
but it's not kind of in the news for exciting developments very often.

22
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:33,960
But this kind of shows that it must be used by a lot of enterprises and people who are

23
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:39,760
actually paying them and making them worth $2.5 billion because that is a lot of money.

24
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:45,060
I mean, okay, it's not red hat money, but it does show that they must be profitable.

25
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:50,640
They must be growing and things must be chugging along nicely there.

26
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:58,160
It doesn't make it any more exciting as a distro and open SUSE never particularly excites

27
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:04,040
me either, but it must be doing well and that's got to be good for open source generally,

28
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,040
hasn't it?

29
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,040
Yeah.

30
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:07,040
You know, I think I mostly agree, Joe.

31
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:08,040
That's a pretty positive spin on that.

32
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:09,040
I'm impressed.

33
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:10,640
And I'll tell you where that figure comes from.

34
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:18,600
So it's like the final figure is 2.35 billion and that is 26.7 times the adjusted operating

35
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:22,880
profit of the SUSE software unit from Micro Focus.

36
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:26,600
That's according to Micro Focus in an interview in Reuters.

37
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:28,880
So that's a pretty big adjustment.

38
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:32,420
In some industries, you might see three times the operating profit.

39
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:36,760
Sometimes you see something much larger if there is an assumed potential.

40
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:39,480
And so you kind of hedge on the potential of the business.

41
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:44,800
So that could be where the 26.7 times what their profit was.

42
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:47,920
That's how they're getting to 2.535 billion.

43
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:51,080
And it could suggest what you're saying, that there is some direction they're going.

44
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:55,060
There is an obvious trajectory of growth here that they're seeing when they look at all

45
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:56,260
of the numbers.

46
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:58,720
And so that's why the figure could be so high.

47
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:01,720
And yeah, that is a good sign for open source and free software.

48
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:08,240
I wonder to what extent Red Hat doing so well lately and Canonical shaping up to try and

49
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:10,240
do an IPO or get bought or whatever.

50
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:16,080
I wonder to what extent all of that had a bearing on this valuation because it's not

51
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:18,620
just SUSE as an individual company.

52
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:20,660
It's the whole industry is going that way.

53
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:26,200
And as we move towards more automation and Internet of Things devices, it all needs a

54
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:27,200
backend.

55
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,440
It all needs servers.

56
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:31,120
And that is all running Linux.

57
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:37,740
And so it's almost like this rising tide lifts all ships idea, isn't it?

58
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:44,400
And so I wonder if part of the growth projection is just based on the industry in general growing.

59
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,600
Yeah, I might know the name for that rising tide, Joe.

60
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:48,160
I think it's called Kubernetes.

61
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:52,980
And SUSE earlier this year really started putting their marketing effort behind their

62
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:54,680
initiatives around Kubernetes.

63
00:03:54,680 --> 00:04:00,760
And they've launched several platforms, including the SUSE OpenStack Cloud, the SUSE Cloud Application

64
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:06,880
Platform, and the SUSE Cast Platform, which is a certified Kubernetes software distribution.

65
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:11,440
And when they got in that game and then started making hype about it around April, I think

66
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:16,000
that probably is a likely source of a lot of their future potential.

67
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,600
The Kubernetes hype is strong.

68
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:22,780
If they would have called it the SUSE Kubernetes blockchain distribution, that figure may have

69
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:25,360
been 80 times.

70
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:31,800
Well, something that surely there's only a positive spin to be put on is GNOME are hiring

71
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:35,700
thanks to the cash injection that they got a few weeks ago.

72
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:38,720
Now they're going to spend that on hiring some new personnel.

73
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,880
Yeah, for new posts.

74
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:46,220
And yes, we'll have a link to the job opening page in the show notes, linuxactionnews.com

75
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:47,680
slash 61.

76
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:52,480
Now the foundation is currently recruiting four positions, a development coordinator,

77
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:58,640
program coordinator, assist admin, and one developer, one GTK plus core developer.

78
00:04:58,640 --> 00:04:59,960
But didn't they get a million dollars?

79
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:03,520
So does that mean they're paying 250,000 each for these positions?

80
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:06,620
Because if they are, I'm in.

81
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:09,280
Something tells me it doesn't quite work as cleanly as that.

82
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:11,200
But it's probably, it's somewhere in the range.

83
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:18,280
I mean, it depends on where you hire a competent developer or assist admin or development coordinator

84
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:23,180
in the West Coast or East Coast area of the United States.

85
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:29,200
That's a fairly well paid position over probably 130 if you do it right and maybe more than

86
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:32,400
that depending in what area of California you work.

87
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:33,980
But really, I know they could hire anywhere in the world.

88
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:37,000
So I guess it's just sort of up to where they want to hire from.

89
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:41,460
It's interesting that this development coordinator under the very brief description of it says

90
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:46,240
that this will ensure that we receive sufficient funds to continue our work delivering free

91
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,420
software.

92
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:53,120
So that job is basically get us some more money so we can hire some more people.

93
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,780
It's the virtuous circle.

94
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:59,760
It is interesting that they're ramping up on a couple of key admin positions, the development

95
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:01,800
coordinator, and the program coordinator.

96
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:05,720
The development coordinator ensures that they receive sufficient funds to continue work

97
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:07,840
on delivering free software.

98
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:09,800
That's an interesting description for a development coordinator.

99
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:14,760
And then the program coordinator frees up time for those involved in organizational,

100
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:17,160
administrative, and logical problems.

101
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:21,160
So a program coordinator kind of sounds like an office admin type position.

102
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:27,040
But in this case, because they're a gnome foundation making software, it's called a

103
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:28,400
program coordinator.

104
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:32,200
Those two admin positions, though, sound like they're meant to sort of free up resources

105
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:38,380
within the foundation, people that are already overtaxed, perhaps wearing too many hats.

106
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:41,440
That's an interesting direction to go and often a good move.

107
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:45,320
It sounds like on the surface, oh, they're just hiring a bunch of more admin work.

108
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:48,640
But a lot of times you get people that have been working, have a lot of knowledge about

109
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:52,940
the project or the organizational structure, and they sort of get overtaxed.

110
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:56,520
They're doing too many things, and if you can free up some of their time, make them

111
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:59,760
more efficient, it's generally good for the project as a whole.

112
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:03,200
So this overall looks like a pretty good spread, and obviously getting a sysadmin in there

113
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:08,100
will help take off some of the load of managing the infrastructure, which I'm a big fan of.

114
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:10,720
And they specifically call out Flathub in here, and they're going to say it's going

115
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,040
to need more support soon.

116
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:15,880
Yeah, it's not only Flathub that that sysadmin is going to be helping out with.

117
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:18,840
There's also Nextcloud and GitLab.

118
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:21,240
So whoever gets the job is going to be busy.

119
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:25,020
Yeah, like I said at the start of the story, we do have the link to the positions page

120
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:28,660
if you want to take a look at the requirements and some of the other details.

121
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:32,920
One thing I just might note, I believe these are all one-year contracts initially.

122
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:36,240
They could continue on, obviously, and you think about the position of the foundation

123
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:40,140
and the uncertainty of future funding, that kind of makes sense.

124
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:43,960
One-year contracts right now, but they look like decent gigs, and they say competitive

125
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:49,940
salary, flexible working, generous paid time off, and travel allowances as well as healthcare.

126
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:53,180
Might be worth checking out, linuxactionnews.com slash 61.

127
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:59,200
Or something else that's definitely worth checking out is GNU Geeks GUIX, which is their

128
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:04,600
transactional package manager, and GeeksSD, which is their distro.

129
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:07,840
They don't mention Linux very much, surprise, surprise with it being GNU.

130
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:13,640
They're quite keen to call it a GNU distribution, but it does have the Linux kernel as well,

131
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:16,200
albeit the Libre version.

132
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:21,800
But 0.15 has been released, and they talk about it being the last 0.something release,

133
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:28,440
or at least one of the last 0.something releases, so they're gearing up for 1.0.

134
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:34,480
And what has caught my eye is that Geeks has been solving a lot of problems with the transactional

135
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:40,560
updates that now a lot of distributions are starting to solve in different ways.

136
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:45,080
So you can think of Geeks as really in two projects in a way.

137
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:48,360
They're a transactional package manager, but they're a distro as well.

138
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:54,240
But they do have instructions for overlaying Geeks on top of your own distro, even getting

139
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:59,120
it all set up with your boot environment and going as far as you might possibly want.

140
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:02,560
And one of the things that's kind of neat about that is then all of a sudden you get

141
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:07,180
transactional upgrades, which means if it doesn't work, you go right back, which includes

142
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:12,320
rollbacks, unprivileged package management, and I'll pause there if you recall recently

143
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:16,120
I was trying out the AWS Workspace.

144
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:19,820
It has very limited software selection now with their new Linux 2.

145
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:24,140
It's very much intended for certain types of workloads, and if you're outside that,

146
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:26,720
you kind of are out of luck.

147
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:29,480
This would give me everything I'm looking for.

148
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:31,360
I could install things like Chromium.

149
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:37,040
I could even install the GNOME desktop with the Geeks package manager on top of my existing

150
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:38,040
distribution.

151
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:42,560
And with rollbacks and unprivileged management, i.e. I don't have to be root, that means I

152
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:48,320
could get pretty far on a virtual instance or it's just a workstation where I don't have

153
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,360
root access.

154
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:52,880
It also has per user profile support and garbage collection.

155
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:57,520
It's really pulling in low-level mechanisms from one of my favorite package managers of

156
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:59,320
all time, Nix.

157
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:00,560
So that's what's so cool about it.

158
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:05,440
And you can try it out as a distro, which is a pretty hardcore installation process.

159
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:09,120
It drops you to a command prompt and then just says, hey, if you don't know what to

160
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:16,020
do, hit Alt F2, go over to your other TTY and read the instructions, and then come back

161
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:19,320
over and type the commands here at the root prompt that you want done.

162
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:23,000
So that's kind of a fun installation process if you know what you're getting into.

163
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:27,400
Or you could abuse an existing installation and try to lay this thing on top of it.

164
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:29,440
Both are super geeky and pretty cool.

165
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:32,720
Why do you think that it's not more popular than it is than Geeks?

166
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:38,160
Because technically it is amazing, but you don't seem to hear about it.

167
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:43,960
It's not implemented in other distros, and it just seems to have flown under the radar

168
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:44,960
somehow.

169
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:48,320
It's definitely got to be in part because it's kind of a bit of an afternoon to get

170
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:49,320
it up and going.

171
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:52,800
I mean, maybe a couple of hours if you're lucky.

172
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:55,500
And that's kind of a barrier to entry.

173
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:59,760
But on top of that, it's solving a problem that there's solutions for.

174
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:03,400
It's the Betamax VHS problem in our modern era.

175
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:11,840
I can get absolutely everything I need these days from Docker, Flat Hub, Snap packages,

176
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:15,120
and insert various other methods to get software.

177
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:18,880
When have you really been totally out of luck these days?

178
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:23,840
I used to run Arch as a daily driver just because the AUR was a surefire guaranteed

179
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:25,380
way for me to get software.

180
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:32,600
But for this entire 2018 year so far, I've been having no problem on an Ubuntu LTS, Kubuntu

181
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:37,200
based desktop, because I can get software different ways now that are good enough.

182
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:39,560
They're not ideal, but they're good enough.

183
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:42,200
And that's always been all the market really needs.

184
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:45,440
And there was a time where I couldn't even live on an LTS.

185
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:46,600
It just drove me crazy.

186
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:48,880
I became known as a rolling release guy.

187
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:51,160
And that was simply because of software availability.

188
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:53,720
I haven't had that problem for a while now.

189
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:58,560
And I think in a way, Geeks is solving a problem that other things that are kind of good enough

190
00:11:58,560 --> 00:11:59,560
already solve.

191
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:02,920
And it kind of took an edge case for me to really go, oh, I could use this.

192
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:06,960
And that's when I'm using AWS's Workspace as a daily driver.

193
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:13,160
And I got to admit, that's an edge case scenario there.

194
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:15,400
Linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

195
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:20,040
Linux Academy is a platform to learn more about Linux and all of the different ways

196
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:22,640
you can use it that help out the resume too.

197
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:27,240
AWS, Azure, OpenStack, or the essentials of Linux itself.

198
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:31,920
Basically, if it can run Linux or Linux runs on it, Linux Academy has courseware about

199
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:32,920
it.

200
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:35,840
And in July, they have their largest content launch in history.

201
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:39,520
That's why I'm down here at their office to help them celebrate the launch because not

202
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:42,920
only do I love a good party, but I'm going to be on their Tuesday stream while they're

203
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:44,400
launching a bunch of stuff.

204
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:46,280
I'm very excited about this, and so are they.

205
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:50,720
I've been watching the company really as a whole celebrate this massive achievement.

206
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:56,080
And you can get started right now for seven days absolutely free when you go to Linuxacademy.com

208
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:58,080
But you know what?

209
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:59,120
I'll also mention this.

210
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:02,440
They have a free community plan that they just recently added a bunch of new content

211
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:05,640
to as well, Linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

212
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:08,960
You go there to support the show, and then you can sign up for a free seven-day trial.

213
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:14,640
Get access to everything, downloadable content, audio guides, I mean, it's awesome.

214
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:18,600
Or try out the community section, tons of great content in there and it doesn't cost

you a dime, Linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

216
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:28,360
Another week, another Android security story.

217
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:34,400
This time it turns out that pretty much most Android apps can record your screen and then

218
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:37,520
send that off to various third parties.

219
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:43,820
Yeah, this is a massive study that is being billed as the first large-scale empirical

220
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:47,800
study of media permissions and leaks from Android apps.

221
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:52,940
And the damning thing here isn't necessarily the apps that you love, but the third-party

222
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:55,560
libraries that they're using.

223
00:13:55,560 --> 00:14:02,240
And this impacts over 89% of apps in the Google Play Store that make use of an API that requests

224
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:04,360
screen capture or recording.

225
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:09,080
And the user is oblivious as it evades the Android permissions framework entirely.

226
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:13,720
Now, this whole study has been done by several different large universities and they found

227
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:18,360
that users and app developers who purportedly set controlled permissions are unaware that

228
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:23,040
these third-party libraries are doing screen capture and even screen recording in some

229
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:24,040
cases.

230
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:26,220
And in the words of the researchers, they said the Android permission model is flawed

231
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:29,120
because it's coarse-grained and it's incomplete.

232
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:32,960
It's a pretty damning study because you don't really ever think about the libraries that

233
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:34,520
these apps might be depending on.

234
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:38,840
You trust the app developer, the core developer, but you have no idea what libraries they're

235
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:40,840
bundling underneath that app.

236
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:45,560
Well, no doubt Google will fix this in the next version of Android and then everyone's

237
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:48,800
going to get that instantly, so problem solved, right?

238
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:49,800
Yeah.

239
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:54,200
So, ask yourself, what is this data being used for?

240
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:56,080
What is this data being used for?

241
00:14:56,080 --> 00:15:01,040
Even if it's not being used by Google directly to sell Google AdWords, it's got to be used

242
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:02,420
for advertising.

243
00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:07,060
That's what all these companies are trying to do with this data is sell you better ads.

244
00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:09,720
And who are they probably buying those ads from?

245
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:11,720
At least in part, Google.

246
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:17,200
So it's not really surprising that the Android security model seems to allow things like

247
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:19,040
this over and over again.

248
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:22,960
I'm not saying Google's intentionally building Android like this, I'm just saying when an

249
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:27,520
advertising company is making an operating system, I'm not super surprised these things

250
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:28,560
keep happening.

251
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:32,400
You just want to find any excuse to justify your iPhone, don't you?

252
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:34,760
I tried not to bring up iOS at all.

253
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:37,160
For all I know, this library problem could affect iOS.

254
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:38,520
I mean, it's possible.

255
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:42,640
Well, they said they're going to move on to that next iOS and try and find whether it's

256
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:46,200
the same problem there or whether that's got other problems, which it might do.

257
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:49,520
But I do take your point that it seems less likely, doesn't it?

258
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:56,360
It seems less likely that a company who is out to sell you ridiculously expensive hardware

259
00:15:56,360 --> 00:16:01,800
as a business model is going to then spy on you and gather data so that they can sell

260
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:05,440
ads because they're not selling ads like Google is.

261
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:11,560
So I'm starting to come round to the logic of choosing iOS, but it's not something I

262
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:13,880
would ever do, I don't suppose.

263
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:18,160
But how many stories like this about Android being terrible with security is it going to

264
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:19,720
take?

265
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:24,120
That's why I think the top comment on the article we'll link to talks about Purism's

266
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:29,280
phone, the Labrum 5, and how important it is that we get something like that.

267
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:34,440
I mean, that commenter gets shot down instantly by someone saying that, you know, well, that's

268
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:38,600
not available right now, and I'm not going to spend $600 on something that's potentially

269
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:39,600
vaporware or whatever.

270
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:46,320
But it just seems so important to me that we get a completely free software mobile OS

271
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:50,080
that just doesn't have these problems, or if these problems are found, then they can

272
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:51,680
be fixed by the community.

273
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:56,560
I've always felt like the iOS device is a stopgap device for me, because it's not an

274
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:58,740
ideal solution itself.

275
00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:03,280
But it seems like the intention of the company behind it is to sell hardware, not to sell

276
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:04,280
ads.

277
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:07,920
And that is where I start with that, because like when I'm traveling, I'm out and about,

278
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:13,080
I'm using apps like Lyft or Uber and Google Maps, and I'm getting around because I don't

279
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:14,080
know where I'm at.

280
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:16,320
Like this morning, I had to nav to a grocery store, and then I had to navigate here to

281
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:17,820
the Linux Academy office.

282
00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:22,780
So I need that tier of applications because of my job, I guess.

283
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:29,200
And so I couldn't just switch whole hog to something like a Librem running Pure OS.

284
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:34,320
But if it had compromises maybe allowed me to run Android apps, then I'd be willing to

285
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:39,240
make a pretty big set of compromises to have a truly free platform, whatever it is.

286
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:44,760
It just needs to have decent hardware that's fast, so my phone isn't frustrating to use,

287
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:47,320
and an operating system I can trust.

288
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:52,000
I've always kind of felt like my best option might be to go with an Android ROM on a high-end

289
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,720
pixel device that is de-Google-ified.

290
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:56,840
And that's always kind of an option I'm keeping an eye out for.

291
00:17:56,840 --> 00:18:01,000
Well, up until recently, you could have used Copperhead OS, but we reported on that a few

292
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,120
weeks ago that things have gone a bit wrong there.

293
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:08,080
But thankfully, there's a fork of it, which has appeared called Rattlesnake OS.

294
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:12,760
Yeah, this is really taking independence to a next level because part of what the Rattlesnake

295
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:20,960
OS promises is over-the-air updates that you build and verify yourself using a fully automated

296
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:23,280
AWS infrastructure.

297
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:30,400
So it spins up using AWS Lambda, and it provisions EC2 spot instances that build Rattlesnake

298
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:37,080
OS, upload the build artifacts to S3, and then your phone updates over the air using

299
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:42,400
your own entire trusted chain of systems that you have management and ownership over, as

300
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:45,000
much as you can own somebody else's computer in the cloud.

301
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,680
So this is clearly not aimed at end users, is it?

302
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:50,040
It's very much aimed at the enterprise.

303
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:51,560
I don't know, man, but I love it.

304
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:52,760
I think it's aimed at me.

305
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:58,360
It's got support for the Google Pixel XL, and the Pixel 2 XL, and the standard Pixel,

306
00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:02,340
and untested support, quote unquote, for the Pixel 2 standard.

307
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:05,240
That is the range of hardware I was just thinking about.

308
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:10,520
It comes with F-Droid pre-installed, the Chromium browser with WebView patches that are awesome

309
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:14,880
because they block ads and enhance privacy, and it's using verified boot to make sure

310
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:18,480
it's using your own official builds from your own systems.

311
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:21,040
No Google apps are pre-installed at all.

312
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:24,920
The whole infrastructure just cost a few dollars a month to maintain, and you have a whole

313
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:26,040
chain of ownership there.

314
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:32,240
Well, I must say that does sound appealing, but as someone who flashes Google apps every

315
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:36,840
time I install lineage on a device, I don't know, there's just certain Google apps that

316
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:42,800
I'm tied to, and so I don't think this would be for me, but I know a few people who run

317
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:48,120
Google-less, and this extra level of security seems pretty appealing.

318
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:49,120
This is pretty neat.

319
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:50,120
I'm really impressed by the project.

320
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:53,720
That's the whole automated approach to building it on your own infrastructure.

321
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:57,480
You got to figure if you could figure out what that build environment was, you may be

322
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:58,960
able to set it up on a local box.

323
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:03,620
I don't think there's anything really specific to AWS other than the script that he created

324
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:08,480
to automate the whole thing uses AWS and makes the process super fast and makes the download

325
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:09,960
to your phone really fast.

326
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:11,800
The trickiest part is getting started.

327
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:16,360
You've got to get the initial setup on AWS, get all the things connected, and you've got

328
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:18,840
to have the initial deployment on your phone.

329
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:22,880
But after you successfully flash your device, you'll be running Rattlesnake OS, and future

330
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:28,760
updates happen through your own built-in OTA updater, which means if the project goes AWOL,

331
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:33,440
if people walk away with the GitHub, you still have your own build environment.

332
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:37,680
As long as that source goes getting created, you can still do your own verification.

333
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:41,400
Just doesn't solve the fact that it's Android, but it does solve a lot of other problems

334
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:43,480
that we run into with projects like this.

335
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:45,320
We'll have a link, again, in the show notes.

336
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:49,400
Okay, well, let's end with a quick security PSA, and that is if you've been using the

337
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:54,920
browser extension Stylish, stop doing that immediately because that has been stealing

338
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:56,200
people's browsing history.

339
00:20:56,200 --> 00:21:03,900
Yeah, it looks like since January of 2017 in Chromium and then March of 2018 in Firefox

340
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:05,400
is when this started happening.

341
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:11,320
And if you followed guides online like I did to make Firefox look really slick on Gnome

342
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:14,480
Shell, it uses Stylish to accomplish that.

343
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:18,840
So you may have installed it ages ago and not even realized, so go double-check your

344
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:19,840
extensions.

345
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:23,440
The short version of it is Stylish's developer sold it a while ago.

346
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:29,440
It's now owned by a company called SimilarWeb, and they actually promote market solutions

347
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:35,400
to see all of your competitors' traffic amongst one of its areas of interest and strength

348
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:36,720
on its website.

349
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:38,280
This is just what they do.

350
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:42,760
So they bought Stylish, and you can actually just look at the traffic, and you will see

351
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:50,560
large chunks of data being sent to api.userstyles.org, sucking up your bandwidth and spying on everywhere

352
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:51,560
you go.

353
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:53,680
So go rip that sucker out of your browser.

354
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:59,280
But the good news is there's a fork called Stylish which doesn't have any of this nasty

355
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:04,400
stuff in it, so you can continue to have the same functionality but safe in the knowledge

356
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:08,040
that all your browsing history isn't being sent to someone else.

357
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:09,560
I love open source.

358
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:11,080
That is awesome.

359
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:16,360
Battlesnake OS forks from Cobrehead OS, and we have Stylish, which is a fork of Stylish.

360
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:17,960
You gotta love it.

361
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:22,240
When some company closes the window, open source opens the door?

362
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:23,240
I'm not sure.

363
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:26,080
But whatever the situation is, we'll report on it every single week.
