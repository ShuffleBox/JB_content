00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,640
Hello and welcome to Linux Action News, episode 219 recorded on December 11th, 2021.

2
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:09,640
I'm Chris.

3
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:10,640
And I'm Wes.

4
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:11,640
Hello, Wes.

5
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:12,640
Let's do the news.

6
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:16,200
We start this week with good news for GNOME users.

7
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:21,760
Just recently landing in GNOME 42's development branch is a long awaited feature.

8
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:23,520
So here's the deal, Wes.

9
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:28,160
Up until now, GNOME has been making a compromise of sorts.

10
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:32,280
It's been compressing pointer motion events so that they are synchronized to the monitor

11
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:37,720
refresh rate, which can be anywhere from 30 hertz to 144 events per second.

12
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:39,860
It depends on your particular display.

13
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:44,600
Some of my monitors are 144, a couple of them are 30, and that would set the compression

14
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:45,600
rate.

15
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:49,960
So you could really only get as many motion pointer events as your monitor was supporting.

16
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:52,080
That was the limiting factor.

17
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:56,880
But to better handle software rendering at rates higher than the native refresh rate

18
00:00:56,880 --> 00:01:01,360
of your monitor, GNOME 42 is changing things up for the better.

19
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:03,560
Yeah, especially depending on your application, Wes.

20
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:09,000
So what has changed now is in version 42 and forward, GNOME will allow input events to

21
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,040
happen at their full input rate, regardless of the monitor refresh setting.

22
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:17,600
Now, of course, not all applications on the desktop will benefit from this change.

23
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:22,640
But applications that use the device input velocity, like as a measurement, like drawing

24
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:25,600
applications, they need as much granularity as possible.

25
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:30,760
And when events are compressed, that actually tampers with the application's calculations

26
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:36,920
of velocity, or really any application that just might render faster than say a 60 hertz

27
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:38,440
or 30 hertz monitor.

28
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:43,900
So without this change, those types of applications would spend multiple cycles, multiple frames

29
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:47,120
without seeing a motion event.

30
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:51,440
Obviously here games are another big application type that's going to benefit from this.

31
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:56,080
To keep the required calculations to a minimum, though, Mudder now caches a set of rectangles

32
00:01:56,080 --> 00:02:01,200
that approximates the visible uncovered area of the actor beneath the pointer.

33
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:05,600
Now these are in the same coordinate space as input events, so comparisons are direct.

34
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:10,120
And if the pointer moves outside the expressed region, or the cache is dropped by some other

35
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:15,280
means, the actor is just looked up again, and then that new area added back to the cache.

36
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:21,080
What's landing in GNOME 42 may or may not end up being the final fix for all this, though.

37
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:25,400
The applied fix is pretty robust, but unfortunately still temporary.

38
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:30,860
A better solution is being proposed at the Wayland Library level, but, well, that's unlikely

39
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:33,280
to be ready before GNOME 42.

40
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:35,560
I'll take even a temporary fix for right now.

41
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:39,720
Carlos has done some good work here, and I'd be really interested to know, Carlos, if this

42
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:43,680
work was inspired by perhaps, oddly enough, the Steam Deck.

43
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:48,960
I'm wondering if things like this perhaps played a role in Valve's choice to go with

44
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:53,760
Plasma instead of GNOME, which would be a bit simpler for new users.

45
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:58,800
I don't know, but perhaps Carlos could reach out at linuxactionnews.com slash contact and

46
00:02:58,800 --> 00:02:59,920
let us know.

47
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:03,640
But we did want to take a moment and mention that our friends over at the FreeBSD Project

48
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:06,440
released version 12.3 this week.

49
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:11,000
This is the fourth release of the Stable 12 branch, and some of the highlights include

50
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:16,000
updates to various networking drivers, several updates to upstream contributed software,

51
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:21,680
and several user applications getting improvements, and of course, those great kernel bug fixes.

52
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:25,560
Though we do realize that many of you have already moved on to FreeBSD 13, we wanted

53
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:30,340
to note the 12.3 milestone here on the show.

54
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:36,040
Systemd 250 is gearing up for release near the Christmas holiday this year, and this

55
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:41,520
week the first release candidate shipped packed full of new great gifts.

56
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:46,240
Systemd homed will now default to ButterFS's Zstandard compression, and this is a change

57
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:51,320
inspired by Fedora's recent decision to switch to Zstandard by default.

58
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:56,720
And quite excitingly, Systemd homed now makes use of UID mapped mounts.

59
00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:02,880
Well, if the kernel and the file system underneath support it, files will now be internally owned

60
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:08,080
by the nobody user and then dynamically mapped to the UID used locally on the system via

61
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:12,720
that fancy new UID mapping mount logic that was added in recent kernels, something we've

62
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:15,320
talked about here on Linux Action News.

63
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:20,360
There's also support for encrypted and authenticated credentials, a whole bunch of new settings

64
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:25,680
for unit files, such as network interface restrictions, and just a whole lot more.

65
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:30,240
We'll have a link to the release notes and a write up by Michael Horrible in the show

66
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:39,480
notes.

67
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:41,320
Linode is fast and reliable cloud hosting.

68
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:42,720
You've got to try it for your next project.

69
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:46,840
It's what I've used for years, especially now that Linode has been rolling out these

70
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:49,440
MVME PCI storage upgrades on their rigs.

71
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:52,300
Oh, it's time to try it, right?

72
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:56,000
The nice thing too about Linode is it does give you that extra safety layer.

73
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:01,040
So if, like a lot of my friends out there this week, you had to do some surprise patches

74
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:05,940
on your systems, I have a little bit of like extra insurance with Linode because not only

75
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:10,160
can I manually create a snapshot, but I have just turned on the auto backup.

76
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:14,560
And the thing that I really appreciate about Linode's UI is that auto backup stuff is really

77
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:18,280
easy to just kind of suss out and see what the state of your system's backups are.

78
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:24,080
Like when it was last taken, how many backups you can go back, all of that is made super

79
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:27,880
easy to see, super easy to understand when you log in.

80
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:31,880
And that kind of peace of mind and information makes it easier for me to proceed.

81
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:36,640
Of course, the ability to just like click snapshot right now is super great as well.

82
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:40,920
And the nice thing about Linode is the dashboard's fast, the machines are fast, everything's

83
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:41,920
really quick.

84
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:46,480
So that little extra time you'll take to go into the dashboard and create that snapshot,

85
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:47,760
it's totally worth it.

86
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:50,240
And the nice thing is their API is fantastic.

87
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:55,080
You can do a lot of this stuff programmatically, or if you just like to go my route a little

88
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:59,720
lazier, use their command line tool for this kind of stuff.

89
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:00,860
Seriously think about it.

90
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:03,840
You could even have the command line tool on the server you're managing.

91
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:07,720
So you fire off the snapshot from that box and then you proceed.

92
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:13,480
There's a lot of ways and a lot of places and a lot of different types of hosting out

93
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:14,480
there.

94
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:18,880
But nobody gets it like Linode with 11 data centers around the world, 40 gigabit connections

95
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:24,000
coming into the hypervisors and 18 years plus now of doing this.

96
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,760
I mean, they just keep getting better and better and they've really stepped it up over

97
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:30,040
the last few years and they blew me away.

98
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:31,880
And now they've got a customer for life.

99
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:35,120
I want you to try it and take advantage of that $100 offer.

100
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:41,040
Go to linode.com slash LAN, get $100 for 60 days on a new account and you really do support

101
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:42,120
the show.

102
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:46,440
It makes a big difference for me, it makes a big difference for you and everybody wins.

103
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:49,800
linode.com slash LAN.

104
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:53,100
And thank you to Ting, linux.ting.com.

105
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:57,040
If you're sick of overpaying for cell service, go see how much you could save and then get

106
00:06:57,040 --> 00:07:01,440
$25 off of that by going to linux.ting.com.

107
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:06,480
I've been a customer since 2013 and it's just a smarter way to do mobile.

108
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:10,840
It's how mobile should have to be done in the US if we had some decent regulations or

109
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:12,440
some real competition out there.

110
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:16,960
But because we got a duopoly, you really don't get to see these kind of features unless you

111
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:20,460
have somebody that comes along and brings it all together.

112
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:21,460
That's what Ting does.

113
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:24,780
They're an MVNO or a mobile virtual network operator.

114
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:29,280
They get access to the big carrier networks, but they get to layer on their superior customer

115
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:32,940
service and their superior pricing model because they don't have to pay for digging the holes

116
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:35,040
in the ground to stand up those towers.

117
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:40,360
And this Christmas marks the first year one of my kids gets a cell phone.

118
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:44,160
It's one of those things I've debated a lot about, but now that they are getting into

119
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:50,280
after school events and sports and all these kinds of things, it's becoming more and more

120
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:51,760
necessary.

121
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:54,280
And there's just no other way I'm going to go than Ting.

122
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:55,780
I love Ting's simplicity.

123
00:07:55,780 --> 00:08:00,520
You can get plans to start at $10 a month, plans with unlimited talk and text and just

124
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:02,200
the right amount of data that you need.

125
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:06,920
And every plan gets access to Ting's award winning customer service with nationwide LTE

126
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:10,640
and 5G coverage, plus the freedom of no contracts ever.

127
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:12,520
It's simple to switch to Ting and it's quick.

128
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:14,240
So go to linux.ting.com.

129
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:17,240
See if your current phone will work, it probably will create an account and pick the plan that's

130
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:18,240
right for you.

131
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:22,400
And then Ting's going to send you a SIM card and you're going to get active in minutes.

132
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:28,520
Go see how simple it is and take 25 bucks off linux.ting.com.

133
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:34,200
And now we wanted to take a few moments to talk about the biggest news story this week.

134
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:39,840
The new vulnerability that's been found in the popular open source project, Log4j.

135
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:44,480
Any Java application that takes advantage of Log4j and uses the official JVM version

136
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:47,040
11 or older is impacted.

137
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:51,840
Putting that another way, it's just a huge amount of software.

138
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:56,240
Initially discovered as a Minecraft exploit, researchers have demonstrated that many popular

139
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:59,040
products and services are vulnerable.

140
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:03,600
Maybe the most infamous is simply just changing the name of one's iPhone to exploit this issue

141
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:04,960
on iCloud.

142
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:06,120
That's pretty bad.

143
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:11,200
Of course, some of us also recall the Apache Foundation tweeted that Log4j is being used

144
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,720
on the Mars Linux copter.

145
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:16,040
Not an easy patch, I imagine.

146
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:21,600
Thankfully though, I don't think there are too many remote connections on Mars just yet.

147
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:26,880
In short, this vulnerability stems from the fact that Log4j supports evaluating certain

148
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:30,040
lookup values before it actually writes to the log.

149
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:35,800
The most dangerous of these performs a remote JNDI lookup on a user-controlled value.

150
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:40,560
Yeah, that stands for the Java Naming and Directory Interface.

151
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:45,320
It provides an API for applications to interact with remote objects like, say, a remote lookup

152
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:46,880
in an LDAP server.

153
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:52,840
So if your application logged user-provided strings and this lookup functionality is enabled,

154
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:58,120
after a few steps, an attacker can successfully execute arbitrary code on the remote host.

155
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:00,320
Yeah, here's how that might work.

156
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:05,080
First, an attacker sends in some malicious data with one of these lookup values encoded

157
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:06,080
in it.

158
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:11,160
Then, if the server logs that data in a request, which is super common, I mean, you gotta log

159
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:14,720
user input when you're trying to track down bugs and issues later on.

160
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:19,400
Well, that malicious payload directs the server to perform a remote lookup at an attacker-controlled

161
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:20,400
address.

162
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:24,160
And yeah, LDAP is a big one you see in a lot of these example attacks that have been put

163
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:25,780
up on GitHub.

164
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:30,720
That triggers the vulnerability, log4j, the library, goes out and makes that request.

165
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:35,020
And because it's an attacker-controlled server, well, the response from that server contains

166
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:37,320
a path to a Java class file.

167
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:43,200
Well, that gets downloaded and then injected into the running server process, which, boom,

168
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,160
remote code execution right there.

169
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:46,160
Boom, indeed.

170
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:50,360
I'm just picturing the process the researchers went through to kind of piece all this together.

171
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:53,560
Clearly, they had some good insights on how this works.

172
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:54,560
But it's a rough one.

173
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:56,560
I mean, there's patches out, right?

174
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:57,880
But we all know this.

175
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:58,880
I hate it.

176
00:10:58,880 --> 00:10:59,880
You hate it.

177
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:00,880
Everybody hates it.

178
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:03,280
But a lot of services are going to be impacted by this.

179
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:09,560
And it is versions of JVM that have been out since 2006, which means a lot of old enterprise

180
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:12,160
software is going to be impacted by it.

181
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:15,660
And I was hearing from friends and listeners all weekend that they were rushing to patch

182
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:17,520
this up over their Saturday.

183
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:21,080
Unfortunately, it's also present in a whole bunch of products that have been around for

184
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,080
a long time.

185
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:27,240
But Java is just everywhere, and we know those things don't get updated very regularly, if

186
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:28,240
at all.

187
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:29,240
No, no.

188
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:34,000
I think it's one of those situations where people just think of it as part of the infrastructure

189
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,800
and they build their applications on top of it and why ever touch it.

190
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:41,080
Even though we're only talking Java 11 here, that was from 2019.

191
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:42,960
That's actually not that long ago.

192
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:47,160
This whole thing is also about open source funding, right?

193
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:52,360
I mean, here we are again, with multiple billion dollar companies being exposed because some

194
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:58,280
small little piece of open source infrastructure hasn't really been getting funding or attention.

195
00:11:58,280 --> 00:12:02,080
Yeah, this is one of those where the memes kind of put it in perspective, oddly enough.

196
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:06,680
So we'll link to a repo that collected some of the best and there's a lot of them, but

197
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:12,120
it's like these little bits of open source software that can just topple an entire empire.

198
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:17,320
And there have been several high profile examples of this one just recently in NPM.

199
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:22,720
And I actually think we're getting to a point where some of these companies like your Googles

200
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:26,080
and your Microsofts and your Apples and your Samsungs, they're actually willing to pay

201
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:29,120
developers to fix this stuff.

202
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:31,000
But it's tricky.

203
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:35,240
We've experienced this just on our own little small scale here at JB, that when you try

204
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:39,560
to pay open source developers for their time, it's not just a simple thing.

205
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:43,240
There's often international things you got to sort through.

206
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:48,760
And some developers, a lot more than you'd expect, are very picky or very restricted

207
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:50,340
in how they can get paid.

208
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:54,440
And some of them have moral obligations about what companies they will or will not work

209
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:55,440
with.

210
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:59,600
A lot of times PayPal is on the list of companies that open source developers, especially the

211
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:02,680
free software developers, just refuse to work with.

212
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:08,560
And additionally, Google and Amazon, they're not going to go and log for Jay's Patreon

213
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:11,800
and become a Patreon supporter in one of their tiers, right?

214
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:14,920
That's not how these massive companies work.

215
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:21,760
They live in the land of invoices, POs, and ACH payments, not PayPal payments, not Patreon

216
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:24,320
payments, not GitHub sponsors.

217
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:26,720
That's just not what these companies do.

218
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:28,200
They have finance departments.

219
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:32,700
They don't have individuals that have PayPal accounts that go support some developer.

220
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:41,040
So we need a way that's not a big foundation or some law firm, but some platform that lets

221
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:46,200
developers get paid in the language, in the means that these companies want to do it.

222
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:50,480
And I know this sounds odd, but I can tell you from being on this end, there has been

223
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:54,840
multiple situations where we're like, we don't have a way to pay this guy because he doesn't

224
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:59,160
want to work with PayPal or there's this restriction because of the country he's in.

225
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:02,400
And it's so much more complicated than just send them a tip.

226
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:06,720
And it gets even more complicated when you have these companies with policies and procedures

227
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:11,040
and they're used to interfacing with other businesses, not individuals.

228
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:12,960
It's a really hard problem to solve.

229
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:14,600
Yeah, you're right about that.

230
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:18,760
And you point out that sometimes foundations, maybe some sort of nonprofit, sometimes that

231
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:23,560
can work, but it also comes with its whole host of own challenges.

232
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:25,800
And it doesn't seem like it's scaled successfully.

233
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:31,600
It's those have been reactionary moves when we discover something like openness, self-vulnerability,

234
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:35,560
then we'll set up some sort of foundational structure that provides a support infrastructure.

235
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:38,640
But in the meantime, there's thousands of different open source projects out there that

236
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:43,520
aren't on anyone's radar that go along for a decade and never get any funding, just like

237
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:44,520
this one.

238
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:51,360
I'm not sure there is an easy answer, unfortunately, although, hmm, maybe, what if we start making

239
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:53,360
these patches NFTs?

240
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:59,280
There you go, NFT for a pull request, or you know what, it could be even simpler, Wes.

241
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:00,840
It could just be like a screenshot.

242
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:01,840
Yeah.

243
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:02,840
Screenshot of the get diff.

244
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:03,840
Perfect.

245
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:08,000
Yeah, they'll make 70, 80K and their whole year of development will be funded.

246
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,720
Why didn't they think of that?

247
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:10,720
I don't know.

248
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:14,620
Maybe until the NFT thing comes along, maybe you'd like to join a network wide membership

249
00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:19,120
that we now have here, which includes every episode of Linux Action News ad free.

250
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:21,260
We're just getting that added to the feed right now.

251
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:25,400
If you go to Jupiter.party, you can sign up and for a limited time, I'm applying a holiday

252
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:28,960
discount that takes $2 off the price for a year.

253
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:33,400
It's just the price of two show memberships, but you get access to all the special feeds

254
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:36,080
for all the shows we produce here at Jupiter Broadcasting.

255
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:39,600
And it's the only way to get Linux Action News ad free.

256
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:42,160
So go to Jupiter.party and sign up for a membership.

257
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:46,400
And also you can give the gift of a Jupiter membership.

258
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:48,880
We have a gift membership option there, brand new.

259
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:49,880
We've got it all worked out.

260
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:54,000
You select the date range and you can give the gift of a Jupiter Broadcasting membership

261
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,300
or pick one up for yourself and take two bucks off.

262
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:59,760
It's already preloaded when you hit the link at Jupiter.party.

263
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:03,120
You've asked for it and we're finally delivering a membership.

264
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:04,640
Thank you for everyone who supports us.

265
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:05,900
