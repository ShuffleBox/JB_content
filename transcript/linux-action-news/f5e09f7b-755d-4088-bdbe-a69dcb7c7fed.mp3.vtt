Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, our weekly take on Linux and the open source world.

00:16.100 --> 00:20.220
This is episode 58, recorded on June 17th, 2018.

00:20.220 --> 00:21.220
I'm Chris.

00:21.220 --> 00:22.220
And I'm Joe.

00:22.220 --> 00:23.220
Hello, Joe.

00:23.220 --> 00:27.340
I think this is my last episode from Texas, and we're kicking it off with one of my favorite

00:27.340 --> 00:30.640
topics these days, a new release of the Plasma Desktop.

00:30.640 --> 00:35.120
Yeah, 5.13 is being released, and there's quite a few little improvements that have

00:35.120 --> 00:37.920
sort of come together to make one big improvement.

00:37.920 --> 00:41.720
I think the things that really stand out in this release are the browser integration for

00:41.720 --> 00:44.200
Chromium-based browsers and Firefox.

00:44.200 --> 00:48.680
Now the media controls and download status are integrated into the Plasma Desktop notification

00:48.680 --> 00:49.680
areas.

00:49.680 --> 00:52.900
They've redesigned the system settings, and there's a few other things they've slipped

00:52.900 --> 01:00.000
in there, like improved blur effects and early support for GTK global menu integration.

01:00.000 --> 01:03.480
So presumably you've upgraded to this on KDE Neon then.

01:03.480 --> 01:08.980
Yeah, and overall, like all of the previous updates, it's gone pretty smooth with the

01:08.980 --> 01:14.160
exception of one new bug that's already been reported, and I think work's already being

01:14.160 --> 01:15.500
done to fix it.

01:15.500 --> 01:20.040
But I don't know the exact circumstances, but on my system, which is a Dell XPS 13 with

01:20.040 --> 01:24.160
a high DPI display, and I'm using the breeze dark theme.

01:24.160 --> 01:29.060
When I click on the Wi-Fi menu, I get this cluttered huge icon list where I can't click

01:29.060 --> 01:31.300
on the individual Wi-Fi connections.

01:31.300 --> 01:36.760
The Wi-Fi signal icons are about 15 times the size they should be, and they're all sort

01:36.760 --> 01:41.240
of jumbled in the list, which is a big bummer when you're on the road and you're switching

01:41.240 --> 01:44.560
between Wi-Fi networks several times in a day.

01:44.560 --> 01:46.100
It's become tricky.

01:46.100 --> 01:50.480
The quick workaround for me has been to just go into the Wi-Fi settings area itself and

01:50.480 --> 01:53.840
just connect in there and not use the pop-up menu.

01:53.840 --> 01:56.880
Others have said they can clear caches and it seems to resolve it.

01:56.880 --> 01:58.240
Hasn't fixed it for me.

01:58.240 --> 02:03.520
Outside of that one problem, though, this must be the third release I've upgraded on

02:03.520 --> 02:06.480
the Dell XPS 13, and I just love it.

02:06.480 --> 02:11.240
I just love having this fresh plasma, and it reminds me that Kubuntu is great for those

02:11.240 --> 02:13.680
of us that need to use their system in production.

02:13.680 --> 02:18.160
All of my studio machines, Kubuntu 18.04, all day, and it isn't getting this 5.13 release

02:18.160 --> 02:19.160
of plasma.

02:19.160 --> 02:24.480
But if you're on Neon or some of the rolling distros like Arch or OpenSUSE, you might give

02:24.480 --> 02:25.480
it a go.

02:25.480 --> 02:29.960
With that exception of that Wi-Fi menu bug, it's pretty solid, and the performance is

02:29.960 --> 02:31.160
noticeably better.

02:31.160 --> 02:35.520
But it is possible to enable it via PPA on Kubuntu 18.04, but presumably you're not going

02:35.520 --> 02:37.280
to be doing that on the production systems then.

02:37.280 --> 02:38.280
Oh, yeah, that's right.

02:38.280 --> 02:39.280
I forgot about that.

02:39.280 --> 02:40.560
Yeah, that could be another way for folks to go.

02:40.560 --> 02:42.720
I don't know if I'd recommend it yet.

02:42.720 --> 02:43.720
I'm not doing that.

02:43.720 --> 02:49.640
I'm going to stick with the LTS release of plasma on Kubuntu 18.04, which is also an

02:49.640 --> 02:50.640
LTS.

02:50.640 --> 02:53.360
That was one of the things that really attracted me to it, so I'm going to stick with that

02:53.360 --> 02:54.880
supported LTS version.

02:54.880 --> 02:57.200
You're pretty much all in on plasma these days, aren't you?

02:57.200 --> 02:58.200
Yeah, I really am.

02:58.200 --> 03:04.140
It's been sort of the star of the road trip, because not only have I used it for every

03:04.140 --> 03:08.960
single show that I've done on the road, but I converted a couple of people from Nome at

03:08.960 --> 03:14.120
Linux Academy over to the plasma desktop, including Anthony, the CEO himself, who's

03:14.120 --> 03:16.160
giving Kubuntu a go next week.

03:16.160 --> 03:19.360
So I kind of became a bit of a pitch man while I was there.

03:19.360 --> 03:20.360
Who, me?

03:20.360 --> 03:21.360
Never.

03:21.360 --> 03:26.840
Well, yeah, there's this video showing off all the features, and it's pretty good apart

03:26.840 --> 03:27.840
from the voiceover.

03:27.840 --> 03:28.840
I didn't think much of that one.

03:28.840 --> 03:29.840
Yeah, no.

03:29.840 --> 03:31.320
You know, I think that guy was in his RV or something.

03:31.320 --> 03:32.320
You can kind of...

03:32.320 --> 03:33.320
It sounds a little weird.

03:33.320 --> 03:34.320
Yeah.

03:34.320 --> 03:35.320
That was weird.

03:35.320 --> 03:38.520
I just pressed play, and the last one was Michael, so I was kind of expecting him again,

03:38.520 --> 03:41.240
and it was like, oh, wow, yeah, there's Chris talking about that.

03:41.240 --> 03:43.240
He'll probably be back in the next one, I would imagine.

03:43.240 --> 03:46.200
I think he was crunched for time because he was itself.

03:46.200 --> 03:47.200
Right.

03:47.200 --> 03:48.200
Yeah, yeah.

03:48.200 --> 03:50.360
Well, it's a very slick video, though, isn't it?

03:50.360 --> 03:53.000
The visuals of it and everything, it's very well put together.

03:53.000 --> 03:54.000
I completely agree.

03:54.000 --> 03:58.440
The video's great, and I am really happy to see Nome doing that, as well as a few other

03:58.440 --> 03:59.440
open source projects.

03:59.440 --> 04:03.640
I think it was just a few years ago, I was sort of strongly advocating that projects

04:03.640 --> 04:07.700
should do this to really showcase the good work they're doing, but also as a user of

04:07.700 --> 04:13.360
these desktops, they do so much, even Nome, that it's nice to be reminded what's new,

04:13.360 --> 04:18.920
and it was because of that video that I went over and got the Plasma integration extension

04:18.920 --> 04:24.640
for my Firefox browser, and now I'm really liking that media player stuff because when

04:24.640 --> 04:28.960
I'm on the air, like if something starts playing, I don't even have to go into my browser.

04:28.960 --> 04:33.760
I can use the play pause keys on my keyboard that control the Plasma widget, which then

04:33.760 --> 04:35.020
stops the browser.

04:35.020 --> 04:39.360
So it's even faster now, I can stop an interruption, it's a great feature.

04:39.360 --> 04:42.120
And I didn't really grok it until I saw that video.

04:42.120 --> 04:45.800
And as usual, it's just slow and steady improvement to me.

04:45.800 --> 04:47.480
It's almost tempting to switch over.

04:47.480 --> 04:52.320
I must say, every new release of Plasma that comes out, I think, hmm, maybe I should jump

04:52.320 --> 04:58.080
ship, but then I think, no, no, XFC is good enough for me, thank you very much, but it's

04:58.080 --> 05:02.440
certainly a potential backup for me, I must say, and I'm tempted to put it on just one

05:02.440 --> 05:08.680
or two systems that I don't use very much, just to give it a really good go, but I don't

05:08.680 --> 05:11.720
want to move away from XFC, I'm too scared of change, I think.

05:11.720 --> 05:14.160
I'm going to just admit that it's a lot to take in.

05:14.160 --> 05:18.200
There's just so much going on with Plasma Desktop, and that's what I love about it,

05:18.200 --> 05:20.200
actually, that there's so much going on.

05:20.200 --> 05:22.600
But it takes a bit, it took me three times.

05:22.600 --> 05:27.340
This was my third time that it actually stuck for me, because each time I got a little more

05:27.340 --> 05:31.400
familiar with it, and I'm going to put a call out there, if anybody in the audience has

05:31.400 --> 05:37.480
like a guide or could write up a quick, like, text-based how-to to configure Plasma Desktop

05:37.480 --> 05:42.180
as close to, like, the default Xubuntu desktop, go to linuxactionnews.com slash contact and

05:42.180 --> 05:46.400
send that in, because I bet you there's some maniac in the audience that has configured

05:46.400 --> 05:49.240
his Plasma Desktop to look exactly like Xubuntu.

05:49.240 --> 05:51.840
Yeah, well, the only thing is I want the panel on the bottom, though.

05:51.840 --> 05:54.480
Gotta have the panel on the bottom, mine's on the bottom, gotta be on the bottom.

05:54.480 --> 05:58.160
Yep, old XP style, thank you very much.

05:58.160 --> 06:02.160
Speaking of being on the bottom, Mycroft's been on the bottom of personal assistance

06:02.160 --> 06:03.160
since the beginning.

06:03.160 --> 06:07.400
They've been behind, and now they're reaching out to the community once again to try to

06:07.400 --> 06:08.400
pull ahead.

06:08.400 --> 06:13.120
Yeah, but instead of doing a Kickstarter or IndieGoGo crowd funder, this time it's an

06:13.120 --> 06:16.440
opportunity to invest in Mycroft.

06:16.440 --> 06:20.880
And it's not just VCs anymore, anyone can invest for the low, low price of $250.

06:20.880 --> 06:25.600
Joe, have you been frustrated that you've been left out of the wealthy VC game for a

06:25.600 --> 06:26.600
long time?

06:26.600 --> 06:31.640
You know, it's been kept to accredited investors and wealthy individuals who make more than

06:31.640 --> 06:34.480
$200,000 per year and have more than a million in assets.

06:34.480 --> 06:37.960
Well, if you've been frustrated that they haven't been able to accommodate you, well,

06:37.960 --> 06:39.240
that's all changing now.

06:39.240 --> 06:45.600
Yeah, well, if I was going to invest in something, I'm afraid it would not be Mycroft.

06:45.600 --> 06:52.400
Because you know, the voice assistants are booming, there's no doubt, but I am personally

06:52.400 --> 06:53.400
not convinced by them.

06:53.400 --> 06:56.920
I mean, you are all in on the Amazon one.

06:56.920 --> 06:59.800
And when you're back in the studio, everything's automated with that.

06:59.800 --> 07:06.500
And you presumably would like to have that be totally open source, but Mycroft, how much

07:06.500 --> 07:10.440
money are they going to need to be able to compete with the likes of Amazon and Google

07:10.440 --> 07:12.680
and Apple on this stuff?

07:12.680 --> 07:14.060
Millions and millions.

07:14.060 --> 07:18.640
They point out in their own post, which by the way, I was reading from earlier as well,

07:18.640 --> 07:23.360
that they say to build the Echo, our friends at Amazon made three acquisitions and assigned

07:23.360 --> 07:25.680
hundreds of employees to the project.

07:25.680 --> 07:30.040
Here at Mycroft, we have a benefit of a great community, but we need additional resources

07:30.040 --> 07:31.440
to achieve that goal.

07:31.440 --> 07:35.280
Right there, right there, they're basically saying, we can't do this unless we can scale

07:35.280 --> 07:37.520
the way Amazon did.

07:37.520 --> 07:41.760
It's sort of an impossible goal at this point.

07:41.760 --> 07:48.120
And the problem is, I think we actually too often focus on the lady tubes from Amazon

07:48.120 --> 07:53.280
or from Google, but I think the real competition is the ones that are baked into the phones

07:53.280 --> 07:58.780
and the ones that are baked into TVs like the Google Assistant can be, because those

07:58.780 --> 08:02.560
are creating something that's going to be called ambient voice assistants.

08:02.560 --> 08:05.040
I'm coining that term, ambient assistant.

08:05.040 --> 08:09.720
What happens, especially in the case of the Siri ecosystem, is if you have a couple of

08:09.720 --> 08:15.540
iPhones and iPads in your house and then you get a HomePod, what essentially happens because

08:15.540 --> 08:21.080
of all of the great microphones on those different devices, anywhere you are, when you say the

08:21.080 --> 08:25.980
perfect incantation to that device, they essentially activate anywhere in your house.

08:25.980 --> 08:30.320
And there's an immediate Bluetooth network the moment you say those words that is created

08:30.320 --> 08:35.880
between all of the devices and they vote which one is the closest and then that device responds

08:35.880 --> 08:36.880
to you.

08:36.880 --> 08:37.880
You never think about it.

08:37.880 --> 08:42.080
It all happens instantaneously, even devices that aren't yours.

08:42.080 --> 08:46.320
So if you have a partner who has a separate iCloud account, has a completely separate

08:46.320 --> 08:52.200
phone, they still participate in this Bluetooth voting and it's creating this ambient network

08:52.200 --> 08:54.840
of virtual assistants.

08:54.840 --> 08:59.320
And that's the real competition because that's using the platform.

08:59.320 --> 09:02.520
That's Google with Google Assistant and Apple with Siri.

09:02.520 --> 09:06.440
And that's what really is the competition, not the single tubes.

09:06.440 --> 09:09.760
Tubes are part of it, but they're just one part of this whole ambient assistant that's

09:09.760 --> 09:11.520
going to take over everyone's homes.

09:11.520 --> 09:13.080
It's already there if you have a phone.

09:13.080 --> 09:14.080
It's already there.

09:14.080 --> 09:15.080
It's already happened.

09:15.080 --> 09:18.040
It's just you only have one or two microphones at this point, but there will be more.

09:18.040 --> 09:19.040
Right.

09:19.040 --> 09:24.480
And so they can't possibly help to compete with that, even if they got millions in investment

09:24.480 --> 09:25.520
here.

09:25.520 --> 09:32.480
So maybe they would be better off going down the open source privacy route and saying that

09:32.480 --> 09:35.240
this thing's going to work without access to the internet.

09:35.240 --> 09:39.520
It's going to be totally based on your LAN and you're going to be totally private.

09:39.520 --> 09:41.960
Maybe that would be the way to do it.

09:41.960 --> 09:45.360
And then people would accept that the voice is not going to be as good.

09:45.360 --> 09:52.240
I mean, it was almost laughable in this post by the Mycroft CEO saying that their goal

09:52.240 --> 09:57.040
is to have Mycroft be indistinguishable from a human being.

09:57.040 --> 09:59.320
And so you wouldn't even know you're talking to a robot.

09:59.320 --> 10:00.320
Oh man.

10:00.320 --> 10:01.320
That is such a pipe dream.

10:01.320 --> 10:07.000
I mean, even the Amazon and Google and Apple ones, you can blatantly tell.

10:07.000 --> 10:12.320
I mean, it's a great voice from them and you can understand it perfectly, but they are

10:12.320 --> 10:14.640
years away from that being indistinguishable.

10:14.640 --> 10:19.280
I mean, I know Google did that demo and everything that got headlines, but duplex.

10:19.280 --> 10:24.420
Yeah, but it's that feels a long way off even for the big players.

10:24.420 --> 10:28.320
So to be talking about that, it's just a pipe dream, isn't it?

10:28.320 --> 10:29.320
Definitely.

10:29.320 --> 10:33.080
And I like your idea of just going the opposite direction because you said something early

10:33.080 --> 10:34.080
in our conversation.

10:34.080 --> 10:38.040
You said you've got the echo tube, but if it was open source, you'd be using it.

10:38.040 --> 10:43.200
If it had 10% of the functionality and it was open source, if it could still turn my

10:43.200 --> 10:47.920
Wi-Fi devices on and off and issue those commands, I'm good.

10:47.920 --> 10:49.440
Really, I'm good.

10:49.440 --> 10:55.820
And that's why I really think if they could focus on the offline or the small scale office

10:55.820 --> 10:58.960
deployments where this could be great in a small business.

10:58.960 --> 11:03.300
Imagine you walk into a conference room and you can set up the projector and the lights

11:03.300 --> 11:06.560
and all of that, the temperature, everything with your voice.

11:06.560 --> 11:10.140
You never have to train staff on how to use any of the devices in that room.

11:10.140 --> 11:12.920
They just bark into the air and it happens.

11:12.920 --> 11:16.360
There's really no reason Mycoff couldn't do that because you could build special recipes

11:16.360 --> 11:20.440
just for your office environment, name your devices that you have them named, the quirky

11:20.440 --> 11:22.300
little office name that you have for them.

11:22.300 --> 11:27.120
And that could be the piece that they own, enterprise and business and privacy nuts like

11:27.120 --> 11:28.120
us.

11:28.120 --> 11:30.640
And they could open source as much of this stuff as they want because they're not even

11:30.640 --> 11:34.140
competing with the echoes of the world.

11:34.140 --> 11:41.460
But this idea that they could topple Amazon at this point or Google or Apple is ludicrous.

11:41.460 --> 11:42.760
It's ludicrous.

11:42.760 --> 11:46.200
It's like somebody launching a device right now saying they're going to topple Android.

11:46.200 --> 11:47.200
It just would be laughable.

11:47.200 --> 11:49.220
Yeah, you've got to find somewhere else to compete.

11:49.220 --> 11:53.440
And for me, the main feature would be nothing leaves your land.

11:53.440 --> 11:58.900
If they could say that, then that's going to be hugely attractive to a lot of people.

11:58.900 --> 12:02.580
Just make sure that if you're deploying it on your land in a Docker image that you check

12:02.580 --> 12:08.180
where that image came from because recently it was discovered that backdoor Docker images

12:08.180 --> 12:12.500
were downloaded five million times from the official Docker hub.

12:12.500 --> 12:15.080
This does not look good for Docker hub, does it?

12:15.080 --> 12:20.620
Especially given that they were reported within a few weeks of them first going up and they

12:20.620 --> 12:22.500
did nothing about it for months.

12:22.500 --> 12:23.500
Yeah.

12:23.500 --> 12:27.620
And the thing that's really sort of like insult on top of injury is that the user account

12:27.620 --> 12:35.100
that these, I think, 17 different images got published to was docker123321.

12:35.100 --> 12:40.020
Obviously just like a rando account that somebody threw together that if a human being even

12:40.020 --> 12:42.660
looked at it for 10 seconds would be a little suspicious.

12:42.660 --> 12:46.140
But the way this hub stuff works, if you guys aren't familiar with, is anybody can publish

12:46.140 --> 12:47.700
to the hub.

12:47.700 --> 12:53.420
And the idea is kind of great because it means some rando sysadmin could really solve a problem,

12:53.420 --> 12:58.160
put it all up in a Docker container and put it on the hub and now thousands of other sysadmins

12:58.160 --> 13:03.100
or developers or whoever can take advantage of that person's cleverness.

13:03.100 --> 13:04.780
That is a great idea.

13:04.780 --> 13:08.260
And then the whole theory is a sort of reddit dig style.

13:08.260 --> 13:13.560
The votes and the comments and app store review style stuff filter out the good and bad.

13:13.560 --> 13:18.220
But as we've all experienced on Amazon and Google Play and Apple's app store, it never

13:18.220 --> 13:19.220
works like that.

13:19.220 --> 13:26.460
So of course, images with oh, I'm sorry, it was I believe 14 images, 14 images with malware

13:26.460 --> 13:31.500
in them, in this case, crypto mining malware just went up and some of them got some pretty

13:31.500 --> 13:33.220
large deployments.

13:33.220 --> 13:34.220
It just sits there.

13:34.220 --> 13:39.080
And because Docker is probably not paying people to go through the hub full time, even

13:39.080 --> 13:42.380
when people start speculating in different avenues that there might be something wrong

13:42.380 --> 13:46.040
with these images, like Joe said, nothing happens.

13:46.040 --> 13:49.880
It's funny that when you and Wes were talking about this on the latest tech snap, I just

13:49.880 --> 13:56.300
kept thinking you could substitute Docker hub for the snap store, you know, because

13:56.300 --> 13:58.540
that again, anyone can upload to it.

13:58.540 --> 14:01.620
And yes, okay, they have confinement and everything.

14:01.620 --> 14:06.540
But we've actually seen crypto mining stuff on there as well.

14:06.540 --> 14:08.380
And yes, it was dealt with very quickly and everything.

14:08.380 --> 14:10.800
But I think that this is a growing problem.

14:10.800 --> 14:16.220
If you have an app store that anyone could upload to, then you can't necessarily trust

14:16.220 --> 14:17.300
everything that's in there.

14:17.300 --> 14:23.020
And then it becomes up to the user to assess who has uploaded it and see whether they trust

14:23.020 --> 14:24.020
them.

14:24.020 --> 14:26.140
And this seems to be a major problem to me.

14:26.140 --> 14:30.580
I think with Docker, it's probably less of a problem because the kind of people who are

14:30.580 --> 14:38.540
using that are going to be sysadmins and people who are very technical, but with snaps, it's

14:38.540 --> 14:42.420
a very different story, isn't it, because that is aimed at everyone.

14:42.420 --> 14:48.740
I would say because of docker's huge scale deployment, I mean, mega scale deployment,

14:48.740 --> 14:52.260
there's probably a lot more noobs installing Docker images than snap.

14:52.260 --> 14:58.140
Snap's sort of a little newer, less widely known, so you probably have more sysadmin

14:58.140 --> 15:02.740
knowledgeable people using them at this point, I'm guessing, rampant speculation, obviously.

15:02.740 --> 15:09.180
I think this is really true for any kind of software store or repo or even a website that

15:09.180 --> 15:10.900
collates links.

15:10.900 --> 15:11.900
This is an issue.

15:11.900 --> 15:16.940
And so the thing that we have to just acknowledge here for a moment, and maybe it just sucks,

15:16.940 --> 15:20.720
but this is the way the world works right now, is the onus is on the user to double

15:20.720 --> 15:21.860
check this stuff.

15:21.860 --> 15:27.060
And so that's why I think when you give users tools beyond just thumbing something up, it's

15:27.060 --> 15:28.060
valuable.

15:28.060 --> 15:31.780
So in the case of the Snap store, they're going to be adding verified publisher status

15:31.780 --> 15:33.500
and things like that.

15:33.500 --> 15:37.860
That is, even though it seems like an incremental improvement, is exactly the kind of tool you

15:37.860 --> 15:40.540
can give a user to make an educated guess.

15:40.540 --> 15:44.580
Now I wish I could sit here and tell you that using machine learning, artificial intelligence,

15:44.580 --> 15:48.740
and Google duplex, they could suss out all of the bad software on the internet.

15:48.740 --> 15:50.460
But the reality is it's just not going to happen.

15:50.460 --> 15:52.660
So it's got to be on the user.

15:52.660 --> 15:57.480
But the problem is, I think, is there is some responsibility all of a sudden when a corporation

15:57.480 --> 16:00.660
begins to curate and manage something.

16:00.660 --> 16:02.700
That's where it becomes a grey area.

16:02.700 --> 16:08.700
Well, that's the thing for however many years we've been using Linux 20 plus, we've had

16:08.700 --> 16:16.240
curated repositories that have been the responsibility of the distro in question, whereas now we're

16:16.240 --> 16:21.900
moving away from that model, more towards the old fashioned Windows style where it's

16:21.900 --> 16:25.380
just random binaries downloaded from the internet.

16:25.380 --> 16:28.620
And okay, it's not quite the same and it's not as bad.

16:28.620 --> 16:30.980
But for me, that is a step backwards.

16:30.980 --> 16:36.380
I can see why these things are solving problems, but it's still a step backwards.

16:36.380 --> 16:39.140
I wish there was some better way to do it.

16:39.140 --> 16:45.300
And verified publishers seems to be the very best solution that we have right now.

16:45.300 --> 16:48.260
Funny enough, in a lot of these cases, it always could have been worse.

16:48.260 --> 16:49.540
It always seems to be Monero.

16:49.540 --> 16:52.260
In fact, we'll have a link in the show notes.

16:52.260 --> 16:57.180
Around 5% of all Monero currency in circulation right now has most likely been mined using

16:57.180 --> 16:58.180
malware.

16:58.180 --> 17:02.820
Monero Project themselves, you know, the group, the collective, can really only account for

17:02.820 --> 17:05.860
about 20% of the overall hash rate.

17:05.860 --> 17:10.300
They really can't account for about 80% of it, so I just love Monero.

17:10.300 --> 17:17.780
And it's just like, of course, of course these Docker images were mining Monero.

17:17.780 --> 17:19.540
Linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

17:19.540 --> 17:23.500
You go there to support the show and you can sign up for a free seven day trial.

17:23.500 --> 17:24.500
Yeah, unplugged.

17:24.500 --> 17:26.300
We stole it from those jerks over at the unplugged show.

17:26.300 --> 17:29.780
I want to tell you about Linux Academy because it's a platform to learn everything about

17:29.780 --> 17:31.820
Linux and all of the stuff that runs Linux.

17:31.820 --> 17:37.420
And that includes these days, things like OpenStack and Azure and AWS and Google Cloud.

17:37.420 --> 17:42.460
And of course, the basics of Linux, Red Hat certifications, the whole empire that is Linux

17:42.460 --> 17:45.100
now, and they create courseware for it.

17:45.100 --> 17:50.500
Now back in April, I told you that they were launching 70 plus new challenges, coursewares,

17:50.500 --> 17:52.780
they were improving old content, new videos.

17:52.780 --> 17:54.900
I was like, this is a huge release.

17:54.900 --> 17:57.060
70 new bits of content and whatnot.

17:58.380 --> 18:02.100
Well in July, it's gonna be 150 new ways to learn.

18:02.100 --> 18:04.460
So you can start to see if you've been a subscriber for

18:04.460 --> 18:06.340
a little while to Linux Academy.

18:06.340 --> 18:09.340
You just continually get value out of your subscription.

18:09.340 --> 18:13.860
And I'm really excited for them because I started to get a little bit of the scuttle

18:13.860 --> 18:16.460
butt while I was down there at Linux Academy about some of the stuff they have

18:16.460 --> 18:17.860
in the works for July.

18:17.860 --> 18:20.580
What they're committing to is 150 new bits of content.

18:20.580 --> 18:24.500
That's like challenges or courseware or all that kind of stuff.

18:24.500 --> 18:29.980
Red Hat certification exams, Azure exams, they're launching security exams and

18:29.980 --> 18:33.220
training courseware, it's a big push.

18:33.220 --> 18:35.780
And the thing is, is that they're not standing still.

18:35.780 --> 18:37.820
While they're working on that, they're already working on the next phase.

18:37.820 --> 18:41.460
They have folks on board that are going through and updating the old content.

18:41.460 --> 18:44.180
And the thing about Linux Academy is you can get the whole suite.

18:44.180 --> 18:46.780
Like if you wanna go in and follow an entire track and

18:46.780 --> 18:49.980
learn up on a whole new area of IT, you can do that.

18:49.980 --> 18:52.140
But if you just need to know something specific,

18:52.140 --> 18:55.980
like a deep dive into a single topic, they have that functionality as well.

18:55.980 --> 18:58.900
And if you're busy, they've got a scheduling tool that helps you put

18:58.900 --> 19:02.220
a time frame on your learning, and then they help you stick to it with goal

19:02.220 --> 19:04.580
reminders, quizzes, things like that.

19:04.580 --> 19:07.300
It's a pretty great system, and I encourage you to go to linuxacademy.com

19:07.300 --> 19:11.580
slash unplugged, and then click over to their blog and learn about the 150 bits

19:11.580 --> 19:15.420
of new way to learn that are coming to Linux Academy in the month of July.

19:15.420 --> 19:17.060
That's one of the reasons I was down there,

19:17.060 --> 19:19.780
was to get their live stream system all up and running on Linux.

19:19.780 --> 19:22.580
That way, they could stream announcements about the different aspects of this

19:22.580 --> 19:24.420
content release in July.

19:24.420 --> 19:28.460
But don't tell anybody I told you that, linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

19:28.460 --> 19:34.820
Okay, so let's talk about something that is brand new and

19:34.820 --> 19:39.820
we've never spoken about before, and that is security problems with IoT devices.

19:39.820 --> 19:42.820
No, well, knock me over with a feather.

19:42.820 --> 19:47.220
Although this one is particularly bad because it really comes down to just bad

19:47.220 --> 19:52.100
OEMs shipping either debug developer versions of Android, or

19:52.100 --> 19:56.740
somehow having ways to turn it back on, which is just wreaking havoc on devices.

19:56.740 --> 20:00.580
Yeah, why would they ship a device with ADB enabled?

20:00.580 --> 20:04.300
It just doesn't make any sense to me, but it turns out that there are a lot of

20:04.300 --> 20:08.700
manufacturers doing this, and that effectively gives you a root shell

20:08.700 --> 20:10.740
on the devices, if you know what you're doing.

20:10.740 --> 20:16.940
I mean, it's definitely the most in China, and North Korea, and South Korea,

20:16.940 --> 20:19.100
and Taiwan, it looks like are on the list as well.

20:19.100 --> 20:24.220
But the United States is on the list, so is Sweden, Russia, and Canada, and Israel.

20:24.220 --> 20:27.980
So it is in Western nations as well.

20:27.980 --> 20:31.660
But I think it kind of makes a little more sense when you consider that some of

20:31.660 --> 20:35.300
these are set top boxes, like cheapo TV boxes,

20:35.300 --> 20:38.580
that people are connecting to their devices to watch Kodi and stuff.

20:38.580 --> 20:41.780
Yeah, that's true, they just knock them out really cheaply, and yeah,

20:41.780 --> 20:46.660
they probably don't have any QA and probably need ADB to do certain things on

20:46.660 --> 20:49.540
it and then just forget to disable it afterwards, yeah.

20:49.540 --> 20:54.380
Yeah, but researchers also found that they were able to turn ADB back on on some

20:54.380 --> 20:57.540
devices, which I didn't realize was actually possible, but they say it's

20:57.540 --> 21:01.260
highly problematic, because it allows anybody without a password to remotely

21:01.260 --> 21:07.780
access this device as root over port 5555, and then silently install software,

21:07.780 --> 21:10.300
and of course, execute malicious functions.

21:10.300 --> 21:13.620
And for whatever reason, these are listening on the network, and there is a

21:13.620 --> 21:19.860
worm that is based on the Mariah Botnet code that is installing, you guessed it,

21:19.860 --> 21:25.340
a crypto miner, and then spreading peer-to-peer via that port 5555.

21:25.340 --> 21:29.220
Now, this had me a little bit worried at first, because I have ADB enabled on my

21:29.220 --> 21:33.420
phone, just in case anything goes wrong or whatever, but thankfully, I don't have

21:33.420 --> 21:38.740
ADB of a network enabled, which okay to have USB ADB makes sense, right?

21:38.740 --> 21:42.900
You need to have physical access to the device to be able to do anything.

21:42.900 --> 21:45.980
And if you have physical access to any device, all bets are off.

21:45.980 --> 21:49.620
But to have ADB over the network, that is a pretty bad oversight,

21:49.620 --> 21:51.300
shipping devices in that state.

21:51.300 --> 21:54.740
Yeah, I agree, and it looks like right now, that worm I just mentioned,

21:54.740 --> 21:57.220
it's mining cryptocurrency.

21:57.220 --> 22:03.300
The researchers, as of June 5, saw about 40,000 unique IP addresses that were

22:03.300 --> 22:06.940
infected, and it would be perhaps even wider spread if it wasn't for the fact

22:06.940 --> 22:10.660
that there's a bug in the cryptocurrency mining software that makes it not work

22:10.660 --> 22:13.580
on some processors.

22:13.580 --> 22:16.340
Oh, man, it's just a complete tale of whoa, isn't it?

22:16.340 --> 22:20.780
This race to the bottom and just no proper quality control,

22:20.780 --> 22:22.460
and this is the result of that.

22:22.460 --> 22:26.980
Yeah, and unfortunately, some of us that try to take action into our own hands and

22:26.980 --> 22:30.620
solve the problem by maybe loading a different image or something like that,

22:30.620 --> 22:32.740
perhaps have one less choice this week.

22:32.740 --> 22:36.580
Yeah, Copperhead OS looks to be in pretty serious trouble.

22:36.580 --> 22:40.940
Yeah, there's clearly some kind of dispute between the founders of the project,

22:40.940 --> 22:46.380
and there is a, quote, open letter on Reddit that was written to the co-founder,

22:46.380 --> 22:50.140
Daniel McKay, and it's essentially kicking him out of the company.

22:50.140 --> 22:54.260
There is a pretty in-depth conversation over on lwn.net, which we'll link to in

22:54.260 --> 22:58.260
the show notes, linuxactionnews.com, slash 58.

22:58.260 --> 23:01.460
I hate to speculate, but it looks like there's been some sort of division

23:01.460 --> 23:02.380
between the two.

23:02.380 --> 23:06.540
Yeah, and when he left, he deleted his signing keys, which means that it's not

23:06.540 --> 23:10.660
possible for them to push any OTAs again, which means that the whole point of

23:10.660 --> 23:15.500
Copperhead OS being this security-focused version of Android, that just goes out of

23:15.500 --> 23:18.860
the window, because if you can't update it, then it's not going to be secure, is it?

23:18.860 --> 23:19.940
Yep, exactly.

23:19.940 --> 23:23.860
I mean, it's really too bad, too, because I know a couple of people that have used

23:23.860 --> 23:29.100
it for a while now, and they both really like it, and I don't know what to suggest

23:29.100 --> 23:31.700
to them, because it sort of scratched a particular itch for them.

23:31.700 --> 23:35.260
I mean, I know there's many others out there, but Copperhead OS was their choice,

23:35.260 --> 23:38.740
and both of them had talked to me about how it seemed like they'd paid attention

23:38.740 --> 23:41.620
to small things that other projects hadn't paid attention to, and they really

23:41.620 --> 23:42.580
appreciated that.

23:42.580 --> 23:46.540
But they're a company who are not without controversy in the first place, aren't

23:46.540 --> 23:48.740
they, especially with their licensing model?

23:48.740 --> 23:49.260
Yes.

23:49.260 --> 23:50.060
Now, that is true.

23:50.060 --> 23:55.820
So they do have this sort of, and I wouldn't be surprised if the revenue

23:55.820 --> 23:59.420
aspect of this model is maybe at the core of the dispute here.

23:59.420 --> 24:05.060
I hate to speculate, but there is some sort of legal entity as a company that

24:05.060 --> 24:07.380
now has to be dissolved or split up.

24:07.380 --> 24:08.940
I mean, there's more to the story.

24:08.940 --> 24:11.100
Yeah, well, we'll have to keep an eye on what happens with this.

24:11.100 --> 24:15.260
I suspect we're going to find out more about it over the next week or so, and

24:15.260 --> 24:19.180
hopefully they can resolve it, but it doesn't look good.

24:19.180 --> 24:22.580
But I suppose let's move on to something a bit more positive, and that is

24:22.580 --> 24:26.220
Debian seeking artwork for their 10.0 release.

24:26.220 --> 24:27.660
Holy smokes.

24:27.660 --> 24:30.380
Debian 10.0, are you kidding me?

24:30.380 --> 24:31.940
Yep, it's true.

24:31.940 --> 24:35.660
I couldn't believe it, but I read it twice, it is true.

24:35.660 --> 24:38.420
And they're calling it, as you know, Buster.

24:38.420 --> 24:41.700
And so this is the spot in the Buster cycle where they want

24:41.700 --> 24:43.060
to start taking in artwork.

24:43.060 --> 24:48.140
And I like this line here that I thought was maybe a bit braggadocious,

24:48.140 --> 24:50.780
but maybe was actually accurate.

24:50.780 --> 24:55.140
They said, would you like to create a desktop look and feel that will be

24:55.140 --> 24:59.060
seen by trillions of people?

24:59.060 --> 25:01.340
Yeah, I think that was a little bit tongue-in-cheek, wasn't it?

25:01.340 --> 25:02.260
To be fair.

25:02.260 --> 25:06.180
Maybe, but maybe it could end up on a television show that is very famous

25:06.180 --> 25:07.820
and is watched for generations.

25:07.820 --> 25:10.260
And in totality, it could be trillions.

25:10.260 --> 25:12.100
You never know, Joe.

25:12.100 --> 25:13.340
Yeah, I hadn't thought about that.

25:13.340 --> 25:16.820
But it's funny that the criteria that they're going to select this on

25:16.820 --> 25:20.100
are that it must be the most Debian.

25:20.100 --> 25:24.660
And they don't really say what that means, but it just has to be Debian.

25:24.660 --> 25:28.060
Which I suppose if you are familiar with Debian, it does make sense.

25:28.060 --> 25:31.540
Because it's not, dare I say, it's not super modern looking,

25:31.540 --> 25:35.220
but it's also not really old looking.

25:35.220 --> 25:37.580
They don't go for a fashionable look, do they?

25:37.580 --> 25:44.060
They just kind of go for something that's fairly minimal and inoffensive.

25:44.060 --> 25:48.740
Yeah, clean, simple, and a little bit of legacy, maybe.

25:48.740 --> 25:50.100
Maybe put it that way.

25:50.100 --> 25:51.060
Yeah, maybe.

25:51.060 --> 25:54.180
Speaking of legacy, though, just sort of a heads up for those of you

25:54.180 --> 25:55.740
that are still rocking the Pebble watch.

25:55.740 --> 25:58.260
First of all, I salute you, and second of all,

25:58.260 --> 26:01.860
you better go make sure all your Rebel account details are in order

26:01.860 --> 26:03.420
and that everything is up to date.

26:03.420 --> 26:08.580
Because the original Pebble services go offline June 30,

26:08.580 --> 26:11.700
and you need to get everything moved over to the Rebel equivalencies

26:11.700 --> 26:14.500
if you want to continue to use them and have your watch function.

26:14.500 --> 26:16.740
This isn't actually open to the public yet,

26:16.740 --> 26:18.740
but you can register in advance.

26:18.740 --> 26:22.280
And they're going to hopefully switch the servers on just

26:22.280 --> 26:23.820
in time for this switchover.

26:23.820 --> 26:26.820
And not everything is going to be supported straight away,

26:26.820 --> 26:30.380
but it's pretty much your only option at this point.

26:30.380 --> 26:32.780
So you've got no choice.

26:32.780 --> 26:36.300
Sign up for your Rebel account and get it ready.

26:36.300 --> 26:39.060
I will put a link to that Rebel auth page,

26:39.060 --> 26:42.500
as they put it, in the show notes so you guys can just click right to it.

26:42.500 --> 26:45.660
I have a Pebble watch, and I gave it to my old man.

26:45.660 --> 26:48.220
And now he rocks it, so I'm going to text him after the show

26:48.220 --> 26:50.460
and make sure that he's doing this, because he loves it.

26:50.460 --> 26:53.100
Yeah, I've got a first generation Pebble,

26:53.100 --> 26:54.780
and I've dug it out of the drawer and charged it today,

26:54.780 --> 26:57.420
so I will have to say about this as well.

26:57.420 --> 26:58.020
Very nice.

26:58.020 --> 27:00.020
Well, we'll keep you up to date on these stories
