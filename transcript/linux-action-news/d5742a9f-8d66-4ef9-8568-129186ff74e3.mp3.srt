00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,640
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News.

2
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:09,520
Episode 232, recorded on March 16th, 2022.

3
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:10,520
I'm Chris.

4
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:11,520
And I'm Wes.

5
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:12,520
Hello, Wes.

6
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:14,740
Let's do the news.

7
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:19,440
This week, Arch Linux turned 20 years old.

8
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:24,200
And we thought we should start the show out this week by wishing Arch, the project, and

9
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:27,400
the many people behind it, a happy birthday.

10
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:32,480
No, it's not quite old enough to drink, but you really shouldn't use Pac-Man under the

11
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:34,520
influence anyway.

12
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:40,480
Arch has seen distros come and go, the rise of SystemD, the introduction of Wayland, and

13
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:47,880
PulseAudio for that matter, but it was first released way back on March 11th, 2002, a simpler

14
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:55,560
time for the Linux desktop, and Arch 0.1 had a nice simple codename at that, Homer.

15
00:00:55,560 --> 00:01:01,400
Since then, they've managed to mostly keep things simple while also building out an incredible

16
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:08,440
user repository, a wiki that I still use even when I'm not using an Arch system, and an

17
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:11,580
amazing amount of community goodwill.

18
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:15,640
That's why, even though I get pretty excited about Fedora these days and still have some

19
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:21,480
Ubuntu machines laying around, of course, Arch, I think, will always remain one of my

20
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:23,640
go-to distros.

21
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:27,680
And I know you've had a few mean Arch desktops over the years, Chris.

22
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:30,160
Are you actually still using it, though?

23
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:31,160
I have.

24
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:32,160
I do.

25
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:36,760
I have, well, we have two boxes in the studio, a desktop machine of mine that's just been

26
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:39,800
a rock since like 2017.

27
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:46,080
I have just slowly upgraded Arch on that thing, and it's been totally great.

28
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:51,400
And then we have it on an old server here that it's still in transition, and it's running

29
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:54,200
on there in a server capacity.

30
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:55,600
Also quite stable.

31
00:01:55,600 --> 00:02:01,080
We started it as, honestly, a year ago as a lark because the live audience was giving

32
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:03,520
me the hardest time for not trying out Arch Linux.

33
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:05,880
This is probably a decade ago.

34
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:07,480
And I was like, all right, fine.

35
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:11,280
You know, being a smart arch kid that I was, I was like, fine, I'll try a chat room.

36
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:14,200
I'll see what your Arch user repository is all about.

37
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:16,640
And I did a week-long challenge.

38
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:19,520
And we still have people that write into the show that say, hey, I started listening during

39
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,940
the Arch challenge.

40
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:26,200
And I did a total deep dive into Arch and came away extremely impressed.

41
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:30,160
I went from a skeptic to a true Arch believer.

42
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:33,840
I try not to tell you about it all the time, by the way, but sometimes I just can't help

43
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:34,840
myself.

44
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:35,840
And I still love it.

45
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:40,120
It might not be like my go-to distro for like a laptop these days.

46
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:42,320
That tends to be Fedora.

47
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:47,840
But for custom-built systems, maybe rigs that are going to have a really specific purpose,

48
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:54,440
or when I'm trying out cutting-edge hardware, I always still turn to Arch.

49
00:02:54,440 --> 00:03:01,120
And I think part of that is because Arch hasn't changed much for the last 20 years.

50
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:04,160
I mean, it's changed technologically.

51
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:07,820
And it's changed with the Linux community in that way.

52
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:12,840
But I thought this is interesting in that first release there, that Homer release, the

53
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:14,640
0.1 release, really.

54
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:17,160
Arch was described as this.

55
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:22,880
Arch Linux is an i6-86 optimized Linux distribution based on ideas from Crux.

56
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:28,120
And then it goes on to say in the post, a default Arch install leaves you with a solid

57
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:29,120
base.

58
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:34,100
From there, you can add packages to create the custom installation you're looking for.

59
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:40,360
That 20 years later is still perfectly, it just perfectly describes Arch still.

60
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:44,120
And you've got to give the project credit for that.

61
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:46,320
That's a hard thing to really stick to over 20 years.

62
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:52,300
And by just nailing that basic promise, a lot of people have come to love the distribution.

63
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:57,100
So happy birthday, everybody.

64
00:03:57,100 --> 00:04:04,240
After what has felt like years of rumors, on March 15th, Google announced that Steam

65
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:11,120
for Chrome OS is finally here, or, well, almost here.

66
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,120
It's a little confusing.

67
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:13,400
It is.

68
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:17,240
It seems maybe the right hand doesn't know what the left hand is doing in this case at

69
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:18,240
Google.

70
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:20,820
So we dug into this just a little bit for the show.

71
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:26,880
And I'm thinking they were planning to have everything lined up for this Google Game Developer

72
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:27,880
Summit.

73
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:33,000
And then the announcement and the slides and all that stuff kept going forward and the

74
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,720
bits that Chrome OS needed didn't.

75
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:41,400
So a Google PR person confirmed that the Steam for Chrome OS stuff isn't actually available

76
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:46,000
right now, like they said it was, but it should be in the near future.

77
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,500
OK, fair enough.

78
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:49,280
That stuff can take time.

79
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:54,200
And to no real surprise, they are initially targeting the higher end Chromebooks.

80
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:57,400
OK, also, fair enough.

81
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:58,860
Not a surprise at all, really.

82
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:04,960
But you're going to need something in there like a decent Intel or AMD x86 64 CPU, not

83
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,000
an ARM CPU.

84
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,040
Those will not get support for this.

85
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:11,920
Unfortunately, you're also probably going to have something that has somewhat of a graphics

86
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:12,920
card on there.

87
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:15,800
They have a list that we'll have linked in the show notes.

88
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:21,680
Steam on Chrome OS is also leveraging, like you probably expected, those Linux application

89
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:24,760
containers that Google built a little while ago.

90
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:29,040
That means that Valve gets to use a lot of the stuff, well, pretty much everything they've

91
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:30,440
already built for Steam on Linux.

92
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:35,080
They don't have to like make a Chrome OS specific version.

93
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:39,000
And actually, speaking of Steam, Valve has sent the developer of Lutris a Steam Deck

94
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,040
to help with development of Lutris.

95
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:46,040
I mean, I just think that's pretty notable here because Lutris could be a tool that lets

96
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:48,720
you bypass the Steam ecosystem if you chose to.

97
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:53,820
You can participate with it as well, but it is essentially a competing tool that lets

98
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:56,840
you use multiple different game stores.

99
00:05:56,840 --> 00:06:02,980
Yeah, I guess the hope here is that having an actual Steam Deck in hand should help further

100
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:07,720
development on the Flatpak, as well as maybe hooking up anything special that's needed

101
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:11,160
to get Lutris to work specifically on the Steam Deck.

102
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:16,120
But yeah, I mean, as you say, like Lutris is not limited to the Steam ecosystem.

103
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:20,040
Yes, it does work in the Steam ecosystem, but it works with a whole lot of other things

104
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:21,200
too.

105
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:26,640
So good on Valve for kind of continuing to keep up this commitment of the Deck is just

106
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:27,640
a Linux device.

107
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:30,640
Yeah, they keep saying it's a PC.

108
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:34,640
If that doesn't underscore that philosophy, I don't know what else does.

109
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:37,440
And then just last bit of news on Steam.

110
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:42,800
The Steam survey results for February 2022 have been clackalated and we just have a couple

111
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:43,800
of notes.

112
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:49,320
Just a reminder, though, that this is kind of a notoriously unreliable metric because

113
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:56,000
the total Steam user base is always growing amongst all other kinds of things.

114
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,520
But here's the figures you're probably interested in.

115
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:07,240
In February of this year, Linux had a Steam market share of 1.02%.

116
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:13,120
Unfortunately that's down a little bit from 1.06% back in January.

117
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:17,600
But taking a longer term view, things look pretty healthy year over year.

118
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:26,360
Way back in February last year, if you can remember that, Steam on Linux sat at 0.81%.

119
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:30,480
Although again, as you noted there, Chris, Steam's overall market share has definitely

120
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:33,400
continued to increase significantly in that time.

121
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:37,120
So it's a little difficult to make complete sense of these numbers.

122
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:42,040
Yeah, I think we mostly just wanted to note it today because won't that number be pretty

123
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:44,360
interesting in about a year from now?

124
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:50,160
Not only has the Deck been sent out to people who pre-ordered it, but likely in a year from

125
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:55,880
now, hopefully, sales channels are loaded up, people have easy access to a Deck.

126
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:57,880
The number here could be pretty different.

127
00:07:57,880 --> 00:08:02,440
That may also have the halo effect, as Apple used to call it, where perhaps people see

128
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:06,740
the Deck and decide, well, if I've got a Deck now, maybe I also will try Linux on this machine

129
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:07,840
and install Steam.

130
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:10,640
We may see this number go up, perhaps in a year.

131
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:15,600
The thing we don't know at this point is, how's Valve going to calculate those Deck

132
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:16,600
numbers?

133
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:19,040
Are they going to lump it in with the general Linux scene, are they going to break it out

134
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:22,720
as a distro, or is it going to be its own category altogether?

135
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:27,440
We just don't have that answer yet.

136
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:33,100
Michael Larable over at Feromics caught wind of a new Linux driver testing framework this

137
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:37,220
week called RoadTest.

138
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:42,360
What immediately stood out to us about RoadTest is it enables drivers to be tested under

139
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:48,440
user mode Linux, and makes it super simple to use mocked or modeled hardware.

140
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:51,880
Yeah, modeled hardware, isn't that interesting?

141
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:55,800
But here's the problem they say they're trying to solve, quote, most of the hardware is not

142
00:08:55,800 --> 00:09:01,800
available in current CI systems, so most drivers can only, at best, be build tested there.

143
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:06,700
Even basic soundness, such as drivers successfully probing and binding to the devices it tries

144
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:09,480
to support, cannot be tested.

145
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:14,060
Drivers cannot be easily regression tested to ensure that bug-fixed code does not get

146
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:16,260
reintroduced again.

147
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:20,080
I think the key thing in there that they're talking about here is, testers can use this

148
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:25,760
modeled hardware to at least build some basic test coverage.

149
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:29,960
And when you have a setup, which a lot of these hardware vendors do now, when you have

150
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:33,840
a setup where you're building with a continuous integration system, anything more you can

151
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:37,320
do there is going to be great, even if it's just some really basic stuff, because I think

152
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:39,440
it's not particularly robust, Wes.

153
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:40,920
I think it's kind of basic.

154
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:45,040
Yeah, it's definitely focused on just simple tests.

155
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:49,200
Actually the tests and hardware models themselves are written in Python, taking advantage of

156
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,960
Python's built-in unit test framework.

157
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:55,880
So no, this isn't going to give you the full set of capabilities that real hardware has,

158
00:09:55,880 --> 00:10:00,080
and of course testing on real hardware is still important, but that's really difficult

159
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:04,000
in CI systems, just given the huge nature of different types of hardware and parameters

160
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,160
and configurations that hardware can be in.

161
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:12,640
All of that makes development, modification, maintenance work, reviewing patches to these

162
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:16,640
drivers, all of that is way harder than it actually needs to be.

163
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:25,600
So RoadTest hopes to make some of those things just a little bit easier.

164
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,120
Linode.com slash LAN.

165
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:32,040
Go there to get $100 in 60-day credit on a new account, and you go there to support the

166
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:33,040
show.

167
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:36,120
You know everything we've deployed in the last, like, what, two and a half years?

168
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:37,440
That's been on Linode.

169
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:41,880
It's the Linux Geeks Cloud with 11 data centers around the world, and they've been hard at

170
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:46,340
work for almost 19 years, creating the best experience for running your applications up

171
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:47,340
there on the cloud.

172
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:50,560
And you know, they're rolling out this new database as a service, and they've done it

173
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:51,560
right.

174
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:52,560
It's a MySQL project.

175
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:57,000
They worked with the project there, and they have focused on getting it just right.

176
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,280
They're gonna expand upon it.

177
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:01,240
I actually haven't had a chance to try it yet, though.

178
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:04,680
It's in beta right now, but I know Linode is gonna nail it.

179
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:07,680
You're gonna have the expertise and the pros that know how to make Linode tick.

180
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:09,240
They're gonna be behind that, right?

181
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:13,240
They're gonna have that fast infrastructure, and of course, the great uptime.

182
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:16,960
So I'm planning to try it, but if you get a chance to try it, let me know what you think.

183
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:20,600
In fact, go sign up and try it out yourself and send me the feedback.

184
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:22,320
I'll incorporate it in a future read.

185
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,540
Linode.com slash LAN.

186
00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:25,720
Go get that $100 to try it.

187
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:29,840
Linode has been rolling out screaming fast MVME-based block storage recently.

188
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:34,160
We use their super flexible S3-compatible object storage to power things like our Next

189
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:38,980
Cloud or the backend storage for services that are always growing.

190
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:43,760
If you want to deploy a matrix server like we have, Linode is great for that as well.

191
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:47,240
Maybe you just want to use Linode for a few minutes to try something out, or maybe you

192
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:51,000
want to run your business infrastructure on there for the next 10 years.

193
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,560
I know people that have been doing that, and I know that they've been loving it.

194
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:59,520
And one thing that I hear over and over again from our audience is the support is incredible.

195
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:03,240
When they need it, Linode support has been outstanding.

196
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:08,000
Great support, super fast rigs, crazy great networking, and 11 data centers to choose

197
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
from.

198
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,800
Yeah, there's a lot of reasons to like Linode.

199
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,040
So let's put it over the top.

200
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:15,320
Go grab that $100 in credit and support the show.

201
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:20,160
Linode.com slash LAN.

202
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:21,420
Do you hear that?

203
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:24,440
Good Savings is calling Linux.ting.com.

204
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:26,360
Thanks to Ting for sponsoring this episode.

205
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:28,720
I've been a Ting customer since 2013.

206
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:29,720
I love these guys.

207
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:33,640
I mean, really, it's the way mobile should be done here in the States.

208
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:35,360
They don't do it good enough.

209
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,360
They didn't have to.

210
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:37,400
They got in early.

211
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:41,880
But I've heard from friends outside the country that say, you know, over here in our country

212
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:45,280
and our fancy country, this is how mobile has to be done.

213
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:47,540
Ting is a mobile virtual network operator.

214
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:49,280
They're a lean mean fighting machine.

215
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:55,880
They focus on the customer experience, value, picking the plans that are simple and straightforward.

216
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:59,080
Great device selection, that kind of stuff.

217
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:02,320
Not greasing the wheels of politicians so that way they can dig a hole in the ground

218
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:04,100
and stand up a tower.

219
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:05,320
They don't bother with that.

220
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:06,960
Instead, they work at the meta level.

221
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:08,400
They rise above it.

222
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:12,880
And they pick multiple networks that they can work with nationwide coverage.

223
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:15,280
Great speeds, LTE and 5G.

224
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:18,280
And their customer support nails it when you need it.

225
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:24,840
In fact, Ting was recently named the number one carrier by Consumer Reports in 2021.

226
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:27,240
Ting's plans are simple and straightforward.

227
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:29,240
It's just the smarter way to do mobile.

228
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:33,960
And every single plan comes with that great support and no contracts ever.

229
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:35,640
It's pretty simple to switch to Ting.

230
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:37,240
Your phone's likely going to work.

231
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:39,480
So go to linux.ting.com.

232
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:43,440
Check your current phone, create an account and pick a plan that's just right for you.

233
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,520
Once everything's good to go, Ting will send you a SIM card.

234
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:46,520
You're going to pop that in your phone.

235
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:48,560
You'll get activated in minutes.

236
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:50,920
You'll kind of feel bad for not doing this sooner.

237
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:52,600
I went through that as well.

238
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:54,840
But you're going to be so glad you did it.

239
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:56,040
Start saving.

240
00:13:56,040 --> 00:14:04,200
Same great wireless experience, just better value, linux.ting.com.

241
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:10,080
You'd be forgiven if you didn't happen to notice the release of GNOME 42 this week.

242
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:15,040
It was what you might call lacking in ceremony.

243
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:23,240
But after a bug update to rename the release from RC to final, GNOME 42 has finally landed.

244
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:27,880
However, before you get too excited about it, and there's a lot of reasons to get excited

245
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:33,520
here, we should remind you that it will probably be a few weeks before it lands in a distribution

246
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:41,960
near you, with the upcoming Fedora 36 and Ubuntu 22.04 likely shipping it first.

247
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:47,000
Now the fact that it's not technically available in a distro easily didn't stop us from giving

248
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,400
it a go just so we could get some impressions for you.

249
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:50,400
Heck no.

250
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:52,840
I got to start here with the visual look.

251
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:54,640
They really took it to the next level.

252
00:14:54,640 --> 00:15:01,380
I wasn't sure what to expect because when GNOME 40 was announced, off in the far distance

253
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:06,440
was this big transition coming to GNOME 42 that involved Libidwaddy and a new way of

254
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:10,400
doing dark themes and themes on GNOME in general.

255
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:13,560
We just didn't know what that was going to materialize.

256
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:19,600
But this 42 release is just blow away in the terms of visual refinements.

257
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:23,520
Throughout the desktop and small little spots that I felt like didn't even need attention

258
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:28,200
have gotten attention, and the GNOME developers have made real efforts to implement a systemwide

259
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:31,000
dark mode that works here.

260
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:37,560
And they've also included a couple of pre-selected dark and light wallpapers that look really

261
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:38,560
great.

262
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:44,260
And so when you pick a dark mode or a light mode in the appearance selector, it now also

263
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:47,840
will adjust the wallpaper to be darker light, which just looks great.

264
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:52,840
And on top of all of that, they're doing this smooth onscreen transition.

265
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:53,840
They just nailed it.

266
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:54,920
It looks so good.

267
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:59,360
Like when they said they were going to do it, they committed to it and they did it right.

268
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:03,120
This is some impressive work to see, definitely.

269
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:06,640
But it's not all just shiny new shell work, no.

270
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:10,460
There's been a whole bunch of stuff behind the scenes to continue the efforts to port

271
00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:17,200
things to GTK4, making a whole bunch of apps faster, and yes, also shinier.

272
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:23,420
One thing I have mixed feelings though about in this release is that our longtime reliable

273
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:28,280
text editor, GEdit, is being replaced.

274
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:33,320
GEdit at least is being replaced by a new text editor that also supports theming.

275
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:34,320
Oh, okay.

276
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:35,320
All right.

277
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:36,320
All right.

278
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:38,520
I'm picking up on a theme here, I think, Chris.

279
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:39,520
Yeah.

280
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:40,520
Yeah, I know.

281
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:43,080
But GEdit, too soon.

282
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:47,640
And of course, as with every GNOME release, there's also a whole bunch of bug fixes, a

283
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:52,280
last minute crash fix, nice catch guys, and performance improvements.

284
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:58,120
Yeah, I think we'll have more on that specifically on the performance part coming up soon.

285
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:02,840
I also wanted to mention, though, that what's nice about this release is it seemed to really

286
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:05,720
kind of motivate the general GNOME ecosystem, too.

287
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:10,320
So you see a lot of numerous third party projects have been making improvements to try to land

288
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:11,680
in time for GNOME 42.

289
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:15,460
So a lot of GTK apps are getting some nice improvements there.

290
00:17:15,460 --> 00:17:17,520
So what we're going to keep doing is using it.

291
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:18,800
I'll keep running it.

292
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:23,080
Brendan West are going to give it a go and we'll give it a review in Sunday's Linux Unplugged.

293
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:27,400
We'll dig into some of the performance stuff and some of the areas they've improved, including

294
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:33,840
how they're doing remote windows and desktop applications with a full Wayland setup now.

295
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:37,080
Because I know a lot of people who use that on X11 have been wondering what the solution

296
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:38,600
is going to be for Wayland.

297
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:41,320
That is now baked in and we'll give that a try as well.

298
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:44,440
So don't miss our coverage in Sunday's Linux Unplugged.

299
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:49,360
And if you want to go get your hands on it, the Fedora 36 beta and Ubuntu 2204 betas are

300
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:50,360
out there.

301
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:52,120
Let us know what you think.

302
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:54,920
But that does bring us to the end of this week's Linux Action News.

303
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:59,740
If you would like to get this show every week ad free, support the entire network and become

304
00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:01,780

And don't forget our East Coast Meetup is coming up real soon, April 9th in Raleigh,

312
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:31,360
North Carolina.

313
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:36,240
We'd love to see you there meetup.com slash Jupiter broadcasting for the details.

314
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:41,920
We'll be back next week with our take on the latest Linux and open source news.

315
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:42,960
Thanks for joining us.

316
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:58,720
And that's all the news for this week.
