00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,200
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, our weekly take on Linux and the open source world.

2
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:21,240
This is episode 97, recorded on March 17th, 2019. I'm Chris.

3
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:22,240
And I'm Tom.

4
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:29,560
Hello, Joe. It's good to be connected with you. And holy smokes, we have so many stories

5
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:35,760
to get into today. Let's start off with some great news for Gnome users. Version 3.32 is

6
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:38,120
released and it's a big one.

7
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:41,180
And you've been running this for a while, haven't you? So have you been taking advantage

8
00:00:41,180 --> 00:00:42,960
of the fractional scaling?

9
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:47,320
I have been for weeks and it has been getting incrementally better and better and better

10
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:53,560
as the beta goes on. So that new fractional scaling is like the huge feature. And this

11
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:59,480
has been like three years in the work. Started years ago at Canonical, kind of got set aside

12
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:03,960
for a little bit and it's finally all come together with the upstream Gnome project.

13
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:09,380
And it's neat. So fractional scaling is a feature that allows everything on the screen

14
00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:15,020
to fractionally scale up for high DPI monitors. This is super nice if maybe you want a little

15
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:21,840
more real estate on your high DPI screen and has some great accessibility possibilities

16
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:28,200
as well. But right now, it's only an experimental feature. So to enable fractional scaling in

17
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:34,000
Gnome 3.32, you have to be using Wayland, which I am, and you have to run a specific

18
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,440
command on the command line, which we'll have linked in the show notes. But if you do these

19
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:42,440
two things, you get this option. It just sort of shows up in the Gnome settings. And it

20
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:46,560
is neat. I played around with it on my ThinkPad, which even though it's a 1080p screen, I was

21
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:52,320
still able to turn this on and play with it. It is fun. And I was wondering, I didn't see

22
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:56,520
an option in the UI, but maybe somebody in the audience knows, I'd love to go the other

23
00:01:56,520 --> 00:02:03,080
way. So you have increments of like 100%, 125%, 150, etc. I want to go the other way.

24
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:07,440
I want to scale down to 80%. That's something you could do in Unity 7. So you could get

25
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:11,920
even more real estate on a small screen. If anybody out there knows a way to do that with

26
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:16,280
this new fractional scaling, let me know, linuxactionnews.com slash contact.

27
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:19,440
One of the real headlines for this release are the performance improvements though. Presumably

28
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:20,780
you've noticed that then.

29
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:24,880
They are noticeable. And I think that's noteworthy right there. A lot of times you'll see like

30
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:30,760
performance improvements as one of the line items as a new feature for a new release.

31
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:36,200
But these are actually perceptible improvements in the performance of the UI.

32
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:40,200
So do you think this is going to be enough to tempt you back over to Gnome from Plasma?

33
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:46,200
When you combine the performance improvements, the stability improvements, the high DPI fractional

34
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:51,640
scaling, the way they've reorganized the settings menu, which looks slick, the new updates to

35
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:58,820
Gnome software, and the update to boxes, which makes accessing your GPU via a virtual machine

36
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:04,960
much easier. It's very, very hard to say no. Like I said, I've been running it on my ThinkPad

37
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:08,700
now for a few weeks, and there's just no way I'm taking it off at this point.

38
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:12,180
If you have had issues with Gnome, like I'm on the record, Gnome and I have been on a

39
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:18,620
break for a little while. I've been seeing Plasma for about a year. But this Gnome 3.32

40
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:23,040
is a really good looking release. And right now, I mean, I don't know where this is going,

41
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:26,100
but I'm excited and we're hitting it off. I'll just put it that way.

42
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:28,720
How did you install it then? What distro is it on top of?

43
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:33,620
I've tried it out on Rawhide, but the one that I ended up going with for my daily driver

44
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:40,140
is actually Ubuntu 19.04. Because from what I can tell looking at the whole Gnome landscape

45
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:46,300
right now, it appears there's a couple of more performance and stability fixes in Canonical's

46
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:51,280
version that they're going to vendor patch that just haven't quite been accepted upstream

47
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:56,040
yet. Like most of it's upstream, but not quite all of it has been accepted yet. And so some

48
00:03:56,040 --> 00:04:00,780
of those, I believe, will ship as vendor patches in 19.04. This is all kind of up in the air

49
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:06,900
right now, but I ended up landing on Ubuntu 19.04. That said, the Rawhide implementation

50
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:10,420
also same great performance improvements, really looks good too.

51
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:14,620
Well, I'm afraid I'm not tempted to switch away from XFCE just yet.

52
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:15,620
Not surprised.

53
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:16,620
Surprise, surprise.

54
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:22,320
No, no surprise to that actually. And I don't blame you if you're not already a Gnome user

55
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:26,780
or a big fan of the general workflow of Gnome, this isn't going to win you over. If you've

56
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:34,020
tried out Gnome in the past and Gnome as some like to call it, if Gnome Shell was a good

57
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:38,340
fit workflow wise for you, but other things prevented you from using it, like myself,

58
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:41,980
I think that's where it's definitely worth a relook in this new version. And maybe go

59
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:48,460
grab OpenSUSE Tumbleweed or try out the 19.04 dailies and just see if you can notice the

60
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:50,500
improvements. Doesn't cost much.

61
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:54,320
Well, you've actually got me tempted to try it now. So I think I will. I can't see me

62
00:04:54,320 --> 00:05:01,180
switch into it, but I think it's worth a go. So something you covered on LUP last week

63
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:04,700
was this Debian situation and there have been some developments.

64
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:09,140
Right. At the beginning of the week, it looked like no one wanted to run the Debian project.

65
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:11,300
They were going to be leaderless, Joe.

66
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:15,580
Yeah. And then one person stepped forward and then another person and another person.

67
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:17,700
And now there's five people running for election.

68
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:21,740
Well, nature abhors a vacuum, Joe. So by the time people are listening to this, there could

69
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:26,580
be another five that have stepped forward.

70
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:29,940
But it's good though, isn't it? Because we thought that no one was going to step forward

71
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:33,900
and it looked like it was just going to keep rolling on and on and on. Each week they'd

72
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:39,300
just keep it open for people to come forward. And I think really it was a case of no one

73
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:44,280
wanted to be the only one standing in the election because that's just a bit weird.

74
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:49,500
And then when one person came forward, that sort of opened the floodgates. So maybe the

75
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:54,540
project isn't quite in the trouble that some people were speculating that it is. It seemed

76
00:05:54,540 --> 00:06:01,340
a bit overblown to me, this idea of them having really old tooling and everything. I mean,

77
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:07,100
okay, yeah, it's not the most modern of distros, but it's been working pretty well for all

78
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:15,020
these years. And their governance model is very solid. And I just can't see huge problems

79
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:16,020
really.

80
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:19,340
I think I'm somewhere in the middle in that argument. I can accept that the tooling, like

81
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:25,140
their bug tracking system for one, and the way they deploy packages, and maybe the way

82
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:29,620
the release cadences are set, like those areas seem like they could use some retooling. But

83
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:34,940
the fundamental governance model does seem sound. And with the right intentions and the

84
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:40,060
right people, the tooling issues can be resolved. So it's not like, yeah, the sky isn't falling

85
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:44,060
here. But I think it's worth recognizing that as a project that's been around for a very,

86
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:48,900
very long time, and they're one of the grandfather Linux distributions, it makes sense there

87
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:54,620
could be some tools that need to be improved. And the motivation for that isn't to be hip,

88
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:59,260
isn't to follow trends, isn't to put everything on GitHub or whatever people might assume.

89
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:03,940
It's simply just to draw in new contributors, new ideas to the project to keep it healthy.

90
00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:07,900
Yeah, that's true, I suppose. You do need to keep the new blood coming in, don't you?

91
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:14,220
So maybe, hopefully, whoever wins this will have some influence. I mean, I know it's kind

92
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:20,180
of, it's mostly a advocacy role, really, isn't it? Going around to conferences and things,

93
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:25,060
but hopefully, they can have some influence and make it modernize a little bit.

94
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:28,540
Maybe what they need is like a really good foundation, Joe. You know, maybe something

95
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:33,020
the Linux Foundation could put together for a foundation inside a foundation that would

96
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:35,420
cover the Debian Foundation.

97
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:41,420
Yeah, because the Linux Foundation definitely needs more sub foundations, don't they? And

98
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:45,500
this week, how many did they announce? I've honestly lost count.

99
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:49,340
You know, it seems like that's a question that should be easy to answer, but it's not,

100
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:53,820
especially this week. The number could be somewhere between two and five. It just sort

101
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:59,760
of depends on how you do this math. So we've got the merger of a couple of foundations

102
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:05,460
into the OpenJS Foundation this week. Then you've also got the launch of the Continuous

103
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:12,080
Delivery Foundation this week. Also, the announcement of the Chips Alliance, which is kind of actually

104
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:18,540
like a foundation. And then on top of all of that, you've got the new Red Team project,

105
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:24,420
which in a lot of ways, operates like a foundation. And then to top it all off, you've got the

106
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:31,140
new Community Bridge platform, which is sort of enabling projects to create foundations

107
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:34,140
on demand. I don't know how many that is, Joe.

108
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:36,420
Yeah, it's like I said, too many to count.

109
00:08:36,420 --> 00:08:40,420
By the way, I didn't even mention the GraphQL Foundation.

110
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:47,020
They just love their bureaucracy, don't they? The Linux Foundation for some reason.

111
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:48,700
Foundations all the way down, Joe.

112
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:49,940
Foundations for days, yeah.

113
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:53,780
I don't really know how to sort this. I'm trying to wrap my head around this. It's almost

114
00:08:53,780 --> 00:08:59,340
too much to really conceptualize at once. I just kind of want to remind some of us about

115
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:05,060
the fundamentals. The Linux Foundation is not a charity organization. It is a trade

116
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:10,900
association, which is designed to serve the common business interests of its paid members

117
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:18,340
like Microsoft and VMware and others who control its board of directors. So it's not bad or

118
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:24,740
good necessarily. It's just a reminder that the Linux Foundation itself is not a charity.

119
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:30,060
It's not, if you give them money, it's not a tax write-off. It is a trade association.

120
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:37,740
And perhaps having foundations for days helps build that organization. I imagine there's

121
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:41,820
an obvious and clear reason why we need this many foundations. I just don't know what it

122
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:42,820
is.

123
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:48,500
Yeah, there's got to be a reason. But the Node.js and JS foundations merging, that's

124
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:53,780
been in the works for quite some time. We covered that back on Linux Action News 74,

125
00:09:53,780 --> 00:09:58,100
which was back in October, so five, six months ago. So it goes to show that these things

126
00:09:58,100 --> 00:10:00,740
do take a bit of time to work themselves out.

127
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:04,420
Yeah, you're dealing with 30 different companies that are involved with that particular one,

128
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:10,660
like Google, Microsoft, IBM, PayPal, GoDaddy, Joyent. There's even more. There's 30 of them

129
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:14,500
that are involved with this. So it takes time, I would imagine, to get alignment from all

130
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:19,560
of them. But each of them released different press statements saying, well, we support

131
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:24,340
the JavaScript ecosystem, and we support the merger of these foundations. It's all interesting.

132
00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:29,740
But can I tell you the one that really jumps out at me out of all of the recent Linux Foundation

133
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:34,580
announcements is this Community Bridge platform. This is interesting.

134
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:40,060
Yeah, it's sort of almost like Patreon Plus, isn't it? It's kind of got the Patreon aspects

135
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:44,900
to it. It's got some community management aspects to it. It's a pretty big deal.

136
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:49,600
Yeah, they pitch it as a platform they're going to add features to over time. And it

137
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:57,460
got its initial big commercial funding already from GitHub. They've contributed $100,000

138
00:10:57,460 --> 00:11:03,100
to this initiative. And when you look at the Community Bridge platform, they say it's about

139
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:08,920
funding security and people. So transparently raise and spend your money as a project. They

140
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:12,980
say they'll provide transparency into potential vulnerabilities and fixes, i.e. they will

141
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:19,260
scan your code repositories for vulnerabilities and apparently make that public. And they

142
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:25,140
say they're going to enable easy connections for mentors and prospects, people that want

143
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:33,420
to be mentees, etc. I looked into it a little bit. And what it is, is a closed source platform

144
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:40,100
for open source projects to manage some of the aspects of being a large project. But

145
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:43,900
it's not everything. You're still going to need lawyers. You're still going to need people

146
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:49,860
to take care of stuff that aren't your core responsibilities. And I have to say, Joe,

147
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:56,420
it is a damn tragedy. And I don't use that lightly, that this Community Bridge platform

148
00:11:56,420 --> 00:12:00,780
is not open source. I believe this is something the Linux Foundation must have been working

149
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:07,060
on for a while or whoever they acquired it from has been. It has a lot of focus around

150
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:13,060
mentorships and mentees, which I think is very important. And it has all of these elements

151
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:18,060
about collecting money and tracking how a project spends its money and making that transparently

152
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:22,340
available to the community. It is something that is more appropriate for open source projects

153
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:28,780
than say, Patreon. But the fact that it's closed source is such a shame, because this

154
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:33,740
is something that could uniquely be beneficial to the open source community. It could be

155
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:38,540
adopted by groups like the Software Conservancy that they could extend this platform. It could

156
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:44,380
be adopted by projects like Debian directly. It is a missed opportunity to truly give back

157
00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:48,680
to the open source community by locking this down as a proprietary platform.

158
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:53,500
You have to figure that their reasoning is that it would become too fragmented if they

159
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:58,220
made it open source. Because if everyone could run their own instance of it, then you wouldn't

160
00:12:58,220 --> 00:13:01,940
know where to go necessarily to find the projects that you're looking for. Whereas if it's all

161
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:08,140
centralized, then that's much more convenient for people. But that's a bit of a weak argument

162
00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:14,540
given that it's all based on open source projects. And therefore, it's just almost a no brainer.

163
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:18,500
You just expect it to be released under an open source license rather than just locked

164
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:19,500
down.

165
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:24,020
This is my opinion, but just watching the Linux Foundation over the last few years,

166
00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:27,380
and all of these foundations that they're launching, bringing all these companies on

167
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:32,380
board, and now the launch of this community bridge initiative.

168
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:37,620
What I see as a common thread here is the Linux Foundation wants to own all of this.

169
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:43,820
They want to be the umbrella organization for the entire open source community. That

170
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:50,540
is poison. That's toxic to an open source community. Its evolutionary nature is its

171
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:56,140
very strength and the centralization of power would be very, very damaging. But I think

172
00:13:56,140 --> 00:14:00,780
this is what we're seeing here. And I don't think it's about fragmentation. I think it's

173
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:06,220
about control and power. And that's why it's a hosted platform that they control. And if

174
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:09,540
they want to prove me wrong, go ahead and open source it, Linux Foundation. Have at

175
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:10,540
it.

176
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:14,780
Well, if they did open source this, then organizations like Mozilla would be able to run an instance

177
00:14:14,780 --> 00:14:18,700
and obviously people would be able to run their own. And I think that there are a lot

178
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:24,300
of people who would prefer to go with someone like Mozilla rather than the Linux Foundation,

179
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:29,460
which is a trade body, as he said. And it's not a foundation that is furthering the public

180
00:14:29,460 --> 00:14:34,560
good. It's there to further the interests of its members, which is totally fine. But

181
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:36,560
some people are just not going to be comfortable with that.

182
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:40,880
I think the Software Conservancy said it pretty well, although it is a bit aggressive. They

183
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:46,480
are not an unbiased party in this matter. But that said, they write at the end of their

184
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:50,600
blog post, which we'll have linked in the notes. The new Linux Foundation system is

185
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:56,300
probably just right for free and open source projects that a, prefer to use a single point

186
00:14:56,300 --> 00:15:02,380
of failure, proprietary software, and b, do not want to operate in a way that is dedicated

187
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:09,340
to the public good, and c, have minimal fiscal sponsorship needs, such as occasional reimbursement

188
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:10,700
of project expenses.

189
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:11,700
Ouch.

190
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:19,300
That's like a serious burn. That's so great. They obviously, again, are biased in this

191
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:26,340
area, but I can't help but completely see their point of view on this. This, in a really

192
00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:33,620
sad way, is no more free and no better for the open source community than just everybody

193
00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:38,740
using Patreon. The only difference here is they're taking care of some additional administrative

194
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:42,380
responsibilities, but not enough. Like the projects will still have to form their own

195
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:47,060
corporate organization in most countries. They'll still have to have legal counsel in

196
00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:53,740
most countries. Like it's not a full, complete package. I appreciate this is new, but it's

197
00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:59,380
off to a bumpy start in my opinion. And also, the fact that the Linux Foundation is a little

198
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:08,380
tone deaf to this particular issue is concerning as well, because it only furthers that narrative

199
00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:14,280
that they're serving at the will of the major corporations. And one really surefire way

200
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:19,980
to combat that narrative would be to actually empathize with the community's needs and deliver

201
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:24,500
something that the community would respond positively to that would indicate you're listening.

202
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:28,640
And every time you make an action that seems to indicate you're not listening, you're furthering

203
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:33,500
a narrative you probably don't want further. And either they're unaware of that or they

204
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:38,700
just don't care. And either one of those two things is extremely unfortunate and a shame

205
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:40,780
coming from the Linux Foundation.

206
00:16:40,780 --> 00:16:44,420
Even if they did open source, it would feel like somewhat duplicated effort given that

207
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:49,660
we have Librepay as a platform already that is completely open source. And so you'd think

208
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:54,060
that maybe they should have built on top of that and sort of given back to the community

209
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:57,740
rather than spending a bunch of money on something that only they can use.

210
00:16:57,740 --> 00:17:02,300
Yeah, it would be at least a decent starting point and maybe they could work with the Linux

211
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:06,700
Foundation. Okay, well, reaction has been a little more positive to the big news for

212
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:07,860
NGINX this week.

213
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:16,200
Yeah, NGINX has been acquired by F5 Networks for $670 million. That seems a lot for a web

214
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:17,740
server company to me.

215
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:24,060
Does it though? I mean, by even kind of moderate estimations, there's over 374 million sites

216
00:17:24,060 --> 00:17:30,540
using NGINX. 67% of the highest traffic sites on the internet use NGINX. But more than that,

217
00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:37,700
it's used as an accelerator in and even like a traffic cop in so many network configurations.

218
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:43,620
It's become the little engine that could. I feel like it's worth a lot more than this.

219
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:47,020
But you know, maybe I just compare everything to the price of Instagram.

220
00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:53,060
Yeah, or Red Hat maybe. Well, you only have to look at F5 stock price and how that dipped

221
00:17:53,060 --> 00:17:59,680
once this was announced to tell you that evidently NGINX is not really that valuable in terms

222
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:04,940
of revenue, not compared to something like Red Hat, which is obviously a revenue generating

223
00:18:04,940 --> 00:18:05,940
juggernaut.

224
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:11,100
Yeah, NGINX is really a problem solver that you just install quietly. And it takes care

225
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:17,600
of things. In a lot of ways. That's also what a lot of F5 network equipment does. There

226
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:20,460
is some actual, what do they call it?

227
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:21,460
Synergy?

228
00:18:21,460 --> 00:18:24,420
Corporate synergy. Yeah. There's some corporate synergy.

229
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:30,140
Well, really, this looks like a play by F5 to modernize and acquire a company that's

230
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:35,900
making something that is very much relevant technologically, unlike F5, which is seemingly

231
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:40,740
becoming less and less relevant as it ages. So again, there's something of a parallel

232
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:43,180
with the Red Hat and IBM acquisition.

233
00:18:43,180 --> 00:18:47,700
Yeah, perhaps. And I wonder if maybe F5 was losing some market share to people installing

234
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:53,220
NGINX boxes, in some cases doing what F5 boxes would have done in the past. So you could

235
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:57,060
see how they could pretty easily tie this in with their product line. And they say in

236
00:18:57,060 --> 00:19:01,640
the announcement that they're keeping everything open source. This isn't going away. They're

237
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:04,820
not going to change the brand name, things like that. They're keeping the brand, they're

238
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:09,340
keeping it open source. The core project remains as is. And I think that alleviates some of

239
00:19:09,340 --> 00:19:10,340
our fears.

240
00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:14,820
Well, I think there are plenty of people whose fears haven't been allayed. But I just don't

241
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:19,140
think it makes sense for companies to buy open source projects and then try and close

242
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:23,740
them down. Because the license just doesn't let you do that. Okay, they can close down

243
00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:28,740
future development, but you're only going to get a fork appearing a community fork or

244
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:34,580
even a company coming along and making a fork of it. So it seems very unlikely that this

245
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:35,980
is bad news to me.

246
00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:40,100
Yeah, and you just lose so much value if you do something like that, not to mention the

247
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:45,420
cost of the loss of community. It's it would be insane. It would be such a waste of money.

248
00:19:45,420 --> 00:19:51,780
Well, a prime example of a bit of software being forked happened this week, when Amazon

249
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:54,140
launched Open Destroy for Elasticsearch.

250
00:19:54,140 --> 00:19:58,820
Oh, Elasticsearch. So for those of you that don't follow this stuff super closely, think

251
00:19:58,820 --> 00:20:03,660
of it as a distributed document oriented search that gives you analytics with a whole engine

252
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:08,160
wrapped around that it supports structured and unstructured queries. And it doesn't require

253
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:12,900
a schema to be defined ahead of time, which not only makes it super easy for end users,

254
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:16,780
but also for developers to get a bunch of information like about analytics from web

255
00:20:16,780 --> 00:20:23,220
logs. And it originally launched as an open source project. And Amazon loved it, scooped

256
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:29,380
it up and made their own product out of that. Now, there has been some conflict between

257
00:20:29,380 --> 00:20:33,820
the upstream project and Amazon over the years, there are certain things that Amazon wanted

258
00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:39,020
contributed to the main open source project, not just the core, and the upstream group

259
00:20:39,020 --> 00:20:43,840
didn't necessarily agree with that. And so now they've got this open distribution, they're

260
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:50,140
calling it for Elasticsearch, which the term for distribution seems to be loose these days.

261
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:57,280
It's either a series of RPMs or a Docker image that you can download. I guess that's a distribution.

262
00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:01,180
They're distributing it. But they write on their blog, they're going for the high ground

263
00:21:01,180 --> 00:21:05,320
on their blog. And it feels like it's a it's a reference to the stuff that we've seen recently

264
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:11,820
with MongoDB and other license changes. They write, quote, we are seeing other examples

265
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:16,700
where open source maintainers are muddying the waters between the open source community

266
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:23,000
and the proprietary code they create to monetize open source at AWS. We believe that maintainers

267
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:28,680
of open source projects have a responsibility to ensure the primary open source distribution

268
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:34,700
remains open and free of proprietary code so that the community can build on the project

269
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:41,040
freely. And the distribution does not advantage any other company over another. This was part

270
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:47,300
of the promise the maintainer made when they gained the developers trust to adopt the software.

271
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:49,560
Doesn't that sound like they're taking a bit of a moral high ground here?

272
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:55,360
Well, they're certainly trying, aren't they? But it's a complicated one, isn't it? Because

273
00:21:55,360 --> 00:22:00,080
Amazon is making all this money from free and open source software. And so it's in their

274
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:06,240
interests for it to be freely available for them to use and make money. Meanwhile, they're

275
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:11,520
not really contributing much back to a lot of the stuff. And that's why we've seen with

276
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:18,200
Redis Labs and MongoDB, them changing the license to make it proprietary to stop Amazon

277
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:19,880
making money.

278
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:24,160
Amazon says it creates uncertainty about the longevity of open source projects with their

279
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:28,380
customers. They say customers also want their freedom to run the software anywhere and self

280
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:33,560
support at any point in time. And Amazon wants to help them do that, especially the run anywhere

281
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:38,480
work. That's why they've decided to partner with Expedia and Netflix to create a new open

282
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:44,800
source distribution of Elasticsearch. So now Amazon is taking this Apache licensed Elastic

283
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:49,880
project, adding in their own stuff and shipping it as their own version now.

284
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:53,880
Yeah, and effectively competing with the proprietary version because they're talking about putting

285
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:57,000
these features in that Elastic are charging for.

286
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:01,220
Right. And everything that Amazon says in the core version that they're releasing is

287
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:06,920
going to be Apache 2.0 license, which includes, like you said, components that compete with

288
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:13,760
the commercial version of Elasticsearch. That's aggressive. And I went and checked it out

289
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:19,100
and it is really easy to get going. Like it has nice UIs. It uses some projects that people

290
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:23,800
are familiar with to get clear, simple metrics set up. It's competitive.

291
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:30,000
But it's yet another example of how the open core business model is just not really working

292
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:36,160
anymore. Because who is going to pay for these proprietary add-ons if there's an open source

293
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:39,120
version that's equivalent in terms of features?

294
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:44,240
Yeah. And the fact that the upstream maintainer is Amazon in association with Expedia and

295
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:51,160
Netflix, that just adds some credibility to the project. And if I was a CTO or a CIO looking

296
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:57,680
at implementing something on a large scale in my company, that would grab my attention.

297
00:23:57,680 --> 00:24:01,640
I wouldn't be beyond that. That's notable that that's something Amazon's maintaining

298
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:05,040
and it would figure they're maintaining it because they run it on their own system. So

299
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:10,280
they have a long-term business interest in keeping it competitive.

300
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:14,600
I can't help but feel a little sad for the open source projects where this is happening

301
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:19,860
to. At the same time, in each case, you can point at examples where they messed with their

302
00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:25,120
license or they blurred the lines between what was open source and what was commercial.

303
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:29,500
And it has led to this. Of course, you can't expect these projects to be perfect and everybody's

304
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:34,240
learning as they go. But in all of these examples, there are key moments you can go back and

305
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:39,200
say, that was a mistake. It would just be nice to see someone compile all of that into

306
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:43,540
a master list of lessons learned for projects like this.

307
00:24:43,540 --> 00:24:49,480
Open source projects need a business model. And it seems that this business model is just

308
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:55,960
not working anymore. And so either we're going to have to learn the lessons, as you say,

309
00:24:55,960 --> 00:25:02,360
and find some new business models, or we're just not going to have any more big open source

310
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:06,200
projects like this appearing, which I don't think will happen. I think they will find

311
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:09,920
new business models, but I just can't think of what they will be.

312
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:17,560
Let me tell you about my friend, the subscription based service, Joe. I mean, but maybe actually.

313
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:22,900
This last story we have in the show notes, I can't wrap my head around it. When you figure

314
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:27,940
in like Fuchsia and everything else going on with Chrome OS, I don't know where this

315
00:25:27,940 --> 00:25:29,500
next story fits.

316
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:35,160
This is the fact that in the recently released Android Q beta, you could toggle on a desktop

317
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:36,160
mode.

318
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:42,640
Yeah. And then that also turns on the freeform multi window mode. You get a status navigation

319
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:48,080
bar at the bottom of the screen. You can set a custom wallpaper. I mean, it's like a like

320
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:50,200
a baby Chrome OS desktop.

321
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:55,720
Well, Google is always one to hedge its bets, right? How many chat applications have they

322
00:25:55,720 --> 00:26:00,000
had over the years, for example, and they often run concurrently before they finally

323
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:06,120
kill it. And this is just their hedge, isn't it? They've basically got three OSs now, two

324
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:09,200
of which are potential desktop operating systems.

325
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:14,360
We don't know what's going to happen with Fuchsia. It could end up being the basis of

326
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:21,520
a desktop OS or a mobile OS or I think more likely IoT stuff. But they've also got Android

327
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:25,200
things. I mean, it's just the typical Google mess, isn't it? I think that when you get

328
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:30,520
enough talented people in enough different departments, they're going to sort of compete

329
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:36,840
internally, which is probably actually better for the final product that wins out.

330
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:42,640
That is likely what it is. It just has my mind spinning. It makes me question the looming

331
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:48,200
Fuchsia release. It makes me suspect perhaps Android is going to be around in many forms

332
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:55,400
much longer. It also has me wondering if perhaps Android becomes their partners operating system

333
00:26:55,400 --> 00:27:00,640
and Fuchsia is Google's operating system, sort of like they're doing right now on the

334
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:06,360
Google Home. Google Home uses the Chromecast operating system. But if you're Lenovo or

335
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:11,940
another vendor like JBL that's making a smart Google Assistant display, well then you get

336
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:16,120
Android of things. You don't get the same OS Google's using. Maybe we're going to see

337
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:22,380
this kind of thing with Android and Chrome OS and Fuchsia. Who knows? Or most likely

338
00:27:22,380 --> 00:27:26,120
it's just what you say, Joe. It's a bunch of talented people in different areas and

339
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:31,600
they're all just kind of hashing it out and the fittest wins. But it is fascinating to

340
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:36,140
see this because it's baked right into Android Q. If you go out and get the betas right now

341
00:27:36,140 --> 00:27:40,840
on a Pixel 3 device, you flip a few settings that we have linked in the show notes and

342
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:45,880
you can use this today. You can hook your Pixel up to a HDMI display, get yourself a

343
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:51,840
Bluetooth keyboard and mouse and you've got a convergent Android based desktop right now.

344
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:55,560
Well this is something they've been working on for an awfully long time. The free form

345
00:27:55,560 --> 00:28:00,800
Windows have been around since Android 7 and Android Q, of course, is the 10th version.

346
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:06,280
So we're kind of three iterations along. So it feels like this has just been in the works

347
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:12,940
for forever. So maybe once they committed to it, they just kept rolling on with it and

348
00:28:12,940 --> 00:28:18,020
didn't tell that department to knock it off. Who knows really? Who knows how the internals

349
00:28:18,020 --> 00:28:25,320
of Google works? But to me, it seems that this competition idea is the most likely explanation

350
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:28,840
for it. That's how I would run a company if I had all the money in the world like Google

351
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:32,720
does because you're just going to get better products as a result of that. If people in

352
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:36,880
your own company are competing against each other in a friendly way where they can still

353
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:42,560
help each other as well, it's got to be good for innovation. It's like the whole open source

354
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:49,480
thing, Gnome versus Plasma. It's not really a competition, is it? And they do help each

355
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:53,380
other out where they can and they have a good relationship, but it does ultimately drive

356
00:28:53,380 --> 00:28:54,920
innovation forward for both of them.

357
00:28:54,920 --> 00:29:02,240
Yeah, that makes sense. It seems expensive, but it makes sense and kind of makes me want

358
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:07,120
Android Q. I kind of want that update on my Pixel 3 and I want to try it out. And you'll

359
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:10,560
remember one of the other things we've talked about that they're working on is the ability

360
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:15,680
to run multiple applications side by side at the same time. Traditionally, one of the

361
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:20,840
applications pauses, whichever application isn't in focus pauses. And one of the features

362
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:24,080
they're also working on is that you can have multiple applications running at the same

363
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:29,040
time without pausing. That all seems like it all's playing into using Android as a desktop.

364
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:36,360
I wonder if we'll actually see this matched up with a hardware device, a laptop type device,

365
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:41,560
you know, a Chromebook running Android. Where does this go? Who knows, Joe? Maybe it starts

366
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:42,560
with foldables.

367
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:47,960
Well, the logical place for this feature would be on a tablet with a keyboard and touchpad

368
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:52,960
attachment. So I wouldn't be at all surprised to see one of those come out fairly soon with

369
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:56,200
this feature being touted as the reason to buy it.

370
00:29:56,200 --> 00:30:00,420
