00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,680
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, our weekly take on Linux and the open source world.

2
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:20,680
This is episode 83, recorded on December 9th, 2018.

3
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:21,680
I'm Chris.

4
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:22,680
And I'm Joe.

5
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:23,680
Hello, Joe.

6
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:27,040
It's good to be connected with you, and I think we all did a collective double take

7
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:35,120
this week when we heard about our first story, and that is Microsoft Edge moving to a Chromium

8
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:36,120
base.

9
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:40,560
Well, Microsoft loves Linux and open source, so it just totally makes sense that they're

10
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:43,960
going to base their browser on an open source base, doesn't it?

11
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:45,920
Oh, yeah.

12
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:53,040
I mean, this is, to me, this is one of the biggest conceits in recent tech history, and

13
00:00:53,040 --> 00:01:04,000
I never expected Microsoft to be this willing to self-analyze and go, where are we losing,

14
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,600
and give up on Internet Explorer slash Edge.

15
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:12,960
I mean, this is a 20-year legacy, or another way to phrase this in corporate speak.

16
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:20,760
This is a 20-year investment that they fought for hard, and having a strategic stake in

17
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:26,320
the web via an engine is excessively valuable for these companies.

18
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:27,320
It's just ridiculous.

19
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:30,520
Like, it used to be kind of the game.

20
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:35,760
And so to see Microsoft, even though clearly Edge was not going to be a popular browser,

21
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:40,280
even with that still, that obvious evidence, to actually see them make this move, I don't

22
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:41,280
know what to do with that.

23
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:43,360
That's so crazy at this point.

24
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:47,040
If you were to come on next week and say they're shutting down Bing, I'd be like, oh, yeah,

25
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,440
that's what Microsoft's doing now.

26
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:50,240
They're doing that kind of thing now.

27
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:54,520
But if you think about it, do they really care what browser engine is talking to the

28
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:56,920
servers running on Azure?

29
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:57,920
Not really.

30
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:01,560
And that's where they're making their money, and that's where they seem to be heading,

31
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:02,560
doubling down on Azure.

32
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:03,560
Hmm.

33
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:04,560
Maybe.

34
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:09,880
I'm not going to say I believe this is a pure Azure play here, as so many other things

35
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:11,800
seem to be.

36
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:16,360
Because one of the little nuances about this story that people aren't talking a lot about

37
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:23,520
is there's a bunch of progressive web applications and other applications that are based around

38
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:27,520
the Edge engine selling in the Windows Store right now.

39
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:32,800
And those are going to continue to use that rendering engine even after the Chromium

40
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,280
switch has happened.

41
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:38,440
Those applications being sold through the store, still using Edge under the hood, the

42
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:40,060
old Edge engine.

43
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:44,760
So that's kind of an interesting thing, because a lot of those PWA apps are connecting to

44
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:45,760
Azure services.

45
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:47,840
So I'm not sure this is a pure Azure play.

46
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:54,600
But they will be trying to leverage control, but just through the more modern method of

47
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:55,600
doing so.

48
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:57,680
They write on their post about this.

49
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:02,660
As part of this, we intend to become a significant contributor to the Chromium project in a

50
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:08,000
way that can make not just Microsoft Edge, but other browsers as well better on both

51
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,220
PCs and other devices.

52
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:17,640
And we've begun making contributions to the Chromium project to help move browsing forward

53
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:20,720
on new ARM-based Windows devices.

54
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:23,540
They're already contributing code upstream for that purpose.

55
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:31,680
And in here, they say their goal is to embrace this open source, established model of providing

56
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:39,720
meaningful contributions that make it a better browser on Windows by contributing that upstream.

57
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:47,640
And the heavy, heavy, heavy implication here is this is about making electron-based applications

58
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:50,600
totally kick ass on Windows.

59
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:57,380
I'm pretty sure I know what this is in service of, a much bigger, longer term goal.

60
00:03:57,380 --> 00:04:01,400
But I'm going to save that prediction for our episode at the end of the year.

61
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:06,000
But this is about, I'll just say short term, this is about making electron apps the best

62
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
on Windows.

63
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:14,920
In fact, there's an implication in here that you may see a bit of a consolidated electron

64
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:15,920
runtime.

65
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:21,560
That when electron apps run on Windows, they sort of use this integrated, centralized runtime

66
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:25,320
instead of launching a dedicated runtime for each electron app.

67
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:29,220
Well, it will be baked into Windows 10, won't it, like Edge is currently.

68
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:31,480
So that would kind of make sense, yeah.

69
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:32,480
Yeah.

70
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,480
I hadn't thought about that.

71
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:34,480
Yeah, they say they'll do it over time.

72
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:36,480
They'll make the change under the hood.

73
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:39,260
So most end users won't even be aware this happened.

74
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:44,280
And then they say they'll do a frequent release cadence where they'll just start pushing updates

75
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:49,760
to Edge in the background kind of aggressively like the Chrome browser does itself.

76
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:54,700
And they plan to release a version of Edge for the Mac as well that will be running on

77
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:55,700
the Chromium.

78
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:58,920
Or really, it's the Blink rendering engine and the V8 JavaScript engine.

79
00:04:58,920 --> 00:04:59,920
Yeah.

80
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:01,560
So it's really, I think it's about web apps.

81
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:03,860
And it's about electron.

82
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:07,900
And I think it's about being just on a winning team, perhaps.

83
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:10,240
But it's a massive, massive win for Google.

84
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:13,640
Well, they didn't go so far as to say that it'd be available for Linux.

85
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:15,720
But there was a slight implication there.

86
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:19,920
I can't wait to install it on Linux and review it.

87
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:23,200
Look at some of their applications they release now that are electron based, like Visual Studio

88
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:24,200
Code.

89
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:28,280
This is going to be something that has to be available for Linux if those applications

90
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:29,280
are going to be using this technology.

91
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:30,280
Yeah, I suppose so.

92
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:34,560
Or even if we're not using it directly, we'll end up using it, well, not we, but the people

93
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,920
who are using those electron apps.

94
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:36,920
Yeah.

95
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:37,920
Right.

96
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:38,920
Keep in mind also, Skype, electron app.

97
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:39,920
Yeah.

98
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:44,840
Well, I try not to use that if at all possible, or I might have to use it this week, possibly.

99
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:46,040
Makes me shudder.

100
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:48,800
But Mozilla are not very happy about this, are they?

101
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:49,800
No.

102
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:50,800
Surprisingly enough.

103
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,760
Yeah, shocker there.

104
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:55,220
They come in swinging.

105
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:57,960
This is the opening sentence.

106
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:03,200
And I quote, Microsoft is officially giving up on an independent shared platform for the

107
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,200
internet.

108
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:10,880
By adopting Chromium, Microsoft hands over control of even more of online life to Google.

109
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:11,880
Dang.

110
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:13,880
That's the opening sentence.

111
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:18,040
Yeah, they're not messing about at all, are they?

112
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:22,300
But they do have a point that now it's a two horse race, whereas before it was something

113
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:23,840
of a three horse race.

114
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:29,880
We like to think as IT people that no one is actually using Edge, but it's still the

115
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:35,280
default browser on most Windows installations, at least outside of Europe.

116
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:37,200
And people tend to use the defaults.

117
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:40,420
And Windows 10 has got this huge market share.

118
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:45,040
So there must be a lot of people using Edge as it stands.

119
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:48,640
And so now after this change happens, there'll only be two horses in the race.

120
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:54,320
I don't know, is that good for Mozilla, probably not really, because it means that people are

121
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:59,920
just not really going to test things outside of Chromium and Chrome.

122
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:04,680
This is really, to me, two different ways to look at the same problem.

123
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:07,280
What you said is absolutely true.

124
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:08,880
And I think that's Mozilla's perspective.

125
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:12,920
And they've been trying to paint that picture for ages now.

126
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:14,880
There's also the reality of the situation.

127
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:21,320
If we zoom out and we look at the whole browser market, Edge, sure, it's the default on Windows

128
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:22,320
10.

129
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:26,320
And I bet you a pretty sizable percentage of Windows 10 users that are average users

130
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:27,320
keep that.

131
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:29,960
Probably not most in our audience, but maybe even some in our audience.

132
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:33,120
No, no judgment if you do.

133
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:38,400
But Windows 10 is just an itty bitty baby drop in the ocean compared to the Android

134
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,600
and iPhone market.

135
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:44,320
And then you combine all of the Windows machines that are using Chrome.

136
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:47,280
All the Macs and Linux boxes that are using Chrome.

137
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:54,280
WebKit and Blink just have a massive, impenetrable market share.

138
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:57,680
And I think Microsoft very wisely has sussed that out.

139
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:03,120
And instead, they're doing something that really only Microsoft can.

140
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:09,120
What other company has enough weight, has enough gravitas and experience to move the

141
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:12,800
needle in the direction of a project like Chromium other than Microsoft?

142
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:18,440
Google is such a massive stakeholder in this project for obvious reasons that really anyone's

143
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:23,120
contributions besides somebody like Microsoft would be a drop in the bucket.

144
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:26,320
And I'm reading from the Microsoft GitHub page here.

145
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:30,920
They have a massive plan for their contributions to this project.

146
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:37,000
They have a whole range of things they're planning to upstream that will make considerable

147
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,300
adjustments to the code base of this web browser.

148
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:44,600
And when you look at when Microsoft started to get involved in the Linux kernel for virtualization

149
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:50,000
compatibility, their contribution on that scale of top contributors exploded.

150
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:55,080
They can take that same approach and they can apply that to Chromium.

151
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:58,520
And I'm really curious to see where this goes because if you look at the reality of the

152
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:02,960
market, it's really a WebKit horse race.

153
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:09,480
Congratulations to the team that initially put KHTML together because you created something

154
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:14,520
that is going to be a standard on the web for a very long time now.

155
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:18,280
So congratulations to the KHTML team because this is really your legacy.

156
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:25,320
And I think this is humbling to see an open source project like this have a massive impact

157
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:26,320
on the web.

158
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:30,260
And if you look at the way open source has shaped the web from the top to the bottom,

159
00:09:30,260 --> 00:09:35,160
it might not be Mozilla's story, but it's still free software and open source's story.

160
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:39,280
And if Microsoft can make a dent, if they can impact or move the needle by contributing

161
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:43,080
to Chromium, then they're going to make a direct contribution and they're going to improve

162
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,920
the real market leader.

163
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:50,560
And I plead for anyone to run Firefox, that it works for them.

164
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:56,320
Consider running Firefox because at least then you can help make somewhat of a market

165
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:59,120
signal for that web browser.

166
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:03,260
But I think Microsoft's looking at the reality of the situation and how they can most effectively

167
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:05,840
apply some leverage and this is it.

168
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:10,240
And I would argue they may be one of the best companies positioned to actually pull this

169
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:11,240
off.

170
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:14,200
So do you think you'd give it a try if they released Edge for Linux?

171
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:16,520
Yeah, I suppose I'd have to just kick the tires.

172
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:17,520
I don't know if I'd switch though.

173
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:20,080
That'd be a little, I feel a little weird, Joe.

174
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:24,480
I don't think I'd install it on my main machine, put it that way, just on my test box.

175
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:25,480
Oh, skeptical.

176
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:26,480
Yeah.

177
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:28,680
Well, because it's not going to be open source, is it?

178
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:29,680
Well I think it will be.

179
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:30,680
It might be.

180
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:32,040
And I might trust it more than I trust Google Chrome.

181
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:34,480
I don't know about the Chromium project itself though.

182
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:37,400
I'd try it, but I don't think, I don't know, I don't know.

183
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:42,080
Well Chromium and WebKit and Blink are very much the standard for browsing the web, but

184
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:46,600
most of the sites that people will be looking at are powered by WordPress, or at least 30%

185
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:47,600
of them.

186
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:50,180
Yeah, it is a huge success story in itself.

187
00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:52,800
And version 5.0 came out this week.

188
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:56,440
I think the big headline feature is the new block-based editor.

189
00:10:56,440 --> 00:11:02,400
They call it a first step towards an exciting future, but the new block-based editor allows

190
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:07,280
you to arrange content, but doesn't really affect, don't think of it as affecting the

191
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:12,720
way the page renders or looks, but it's more about giving creators a blank canvas where

192
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:16,920
they can like draw a box and say, this media element goes here, or make these fonts in

193
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:18,320
this area fancy.

194
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:22,080
And you do it via this block concept, and they have a bunch of blocks you can just drop

195
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:23,720
in there and then you're good to go.

196
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:27,160
I've tried this out and I'm not convinced really.

197
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:33,680
I think that if I'd never used WordPress before, it would be a better experience than I have

198
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:40,160
got used to, but having already developed a workflow, this has somewhat just thrown

199
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:41,880
that out of the window.

200
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:48,160
There is a plugin which can bring you the old functionality back, the old editor, but

201
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:54,160
I don't like installing plugins if I don't have to, because it's just more attack surface

202
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:55,300
and stuff.

203
00:11:55,300 --> 00:12:00,040
And that only works until 2021, and then they're dropping compatibility for that plugin.

204
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:01,040
Yeah.

205
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:04,280
So I think I'm just going to have to get used to this and just start rolling with it.

206
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:07,160
It's radically different though.

207
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:08,160
I was pretty surprised.

208
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:10,800
I mean, minimalist would be one way to put it.

209
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,160
It's very minimal.

210
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:16,080
And you kind of start with a blank canvas and then build the blocks together and do

211
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:17,080
your post.

212
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:21,200
And I bet you if you could work with templates and systems like that, create your own blocks,

213
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:25,360
you could essentially replicate the workflow you have with the classic design.

214
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,360
But I agree.

215
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:32,600
As a long, long, long time WordPress user, jarring and surprising is how I would describe

216
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:34,320
the new UI.

217
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,880
But I have the same exact thought you had.

218
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:40,320
It was like, okay, well, I could totally see if this is the first time I ever sat down

219
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:42,040
to use WordPress.

220
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:45,600
And I wouldn't be surprised if that's their thinking, like we've got 30% of the web, but

221
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:46,600
what about the next 30%?

222
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:51,800
You know, that's a pretty common line of thinking for these ambitious groups like this.

223
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:56,280
But the other thing about 5.0, besides the new UI, is there's some very important security

224
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:57,280
fixes in here.

225
00:12:57,280 --> 00:13:01,560
They're not emphasizing those very much, but having followed this for TechSnap recently,

226
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:03,760
there's some pretty important security fixes in 5.0 too.

227
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:08,000
So it's worth the upgrade, but with all these big ones, you know, you can always try it

228
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,080
out before you make the upgrade, throw it up on a VPS for a bit and kick the tires.

229
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:14,720
And they have also some ones online you can try out.

230
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:18,400
Well, something else I think I've heard you talk about running on a VPS is MB.

231
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:23,720
Yeah, the open source communities answer to Plex, a media streaming system that automatically

232
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:25,500
indexes all your files.

233
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:29,560
It retrieves all the metadata from the various information services.

234
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:33,840
It displays them nicely in a web UI or on apps on Android or iOS.

235
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:36,680
And it even, you know, keeps track of what you've watched, gets trailers, you know, things

236
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:37,920
you expect from Plex.

237
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:39,560
This sounds like a great open source project.

238
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:40,760
Yeah, so I went all in.

239
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:46,160
I set myself up a droplet, got some big attached storage and I sync files up there.

240
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:52,880
And this week, sort of sneaky too, because obviously who wants to really emphasize this,

241
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:59,600
but in a new release, it is revealed that MB is essentially switching to a closed source

242
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:09,240
core model with other bits that are open source, a proprietary core with open source additions.

243
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:11,880
The nerd rage was strong on GitHub, wasn't it?

244
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:12,880
Yeah, yeah.

245
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:13,880
The comments are brutal.

246
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:14,880
And I'm pretty upset too.

247
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:17,240
This was the major differentiator between this and Plex.

248
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:21,840
Well, what put me off Plex and I think puts a lot of people off is that you have to log

249
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:22,840
in.

250
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:23,840
You have to have an account, don't you?

251
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:27,680
I think there are maybe some workarounds, but the standard workflow is that you have

252
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:32,280
to have this account with them, whereas MB was totally self hosted.

253
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:33,280
Yeah.

254
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:35,800
There are ways on Plex, like you said, though, to get around that.

255
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:36,800
Yeah, that's true.

256
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:43,000
I think that MB will still continue to be popular because it is totally independent.

257
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:47,080
You can just run it yourself, even if it's proprietary, because it's like things like

258
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:51,920
Servio that's totally proprietary, but no one cares, or very few people outside of the

259
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:56,440
Linux open source world care, as long as it works well.

260
00:14:56,440 --> 00:15:00,080
So I don't think it's really going to harm their adoption, is it?

261
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:06,360
I mean, I know they've got this nagware aspect of it, which, has that annoyed you then?

262
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:11,880
The nagware aspect would be extremely annoying if I hadn't been an MB premium subscriber

263
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:13,080
for a while now.

264
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:18,920
I threw in some money on like a yearly plan just to try to keep them around, to try to

265
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:23,760
prevent something like this from happening, because this to me was such a great solution.

266
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:29,160
You think about it, you can have a private collection of TV and movies for your kids,

267
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:32,840
and if maybe your kids are split between two homes, they can still watch the same stuff,

268
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:36,440
but you can also share it with friends and family, and when I'm traveling, it's just

269
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:42,800
so great, and it just was so perfect, and it's so disappointing to see this, and I actually,

270
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:46,560
I'm going to cancel my premium membership, I have no need for this.

271
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:51,900
And I guess I would just say this, their timing sucks, because Plex, I feel like, has recently

272
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:53,400
taken their eye off the ball.

273
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:59,200
It was originally a fork of XBMC, and it just was better Xbox Media Center XBMC, now known

274
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:01,080
as Kodi, it was just great at that.

275
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:04,720
But now they've gotten into trying to aggregate news, and they're even trying to be like a

276
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:08,720
podcast platform, and they're trying to do all this extra stuff outside of just streaming

277
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:10,560
my damn shows.

278
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:14,760
And so it would be MB's game to gain there, but not with this move.

279
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:16,320
I think it's going to slow that.

280
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:20,840
Yeah, and this seems to be all about that nagging screen, because people could fork

281
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:28,320
it before and were forking it and removing that aspect of it, the nag, and they just

282
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,680
don't want that to happen, because that damages their business model.

283
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:36,200
They want you to be annoyed enough to subscribe to the premium service, and now there's no

284
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:38,700
way to change that code and remove that.

285
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:41,000
So that's clearly the crux of this.

286
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,320
I think I smell a fork coming.

287
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:43,320
Oh, yeah.

288
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:46,800
Well, there's a lot of talk about that, but their attitude in GitHub as well was like,

289
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:52,600
yeah, good luck with that, which is, that's not going to win you any friends, is it?

290
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:54,160
This is way harder than you know.

291
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:55,160
Good luck.

292
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:56,160
Yeah.

293
00:16:56,160 --> 00:17:01,400
Well, you know, Linus has been winning over some friends, his emails have been much nicer

294
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:08,360
with no swearing so far, and it looks like this new attitude has gotten us a reasonable

295
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:11,400
compromise on what could have been a performance nightmare.

296
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:17,000
Yeah, and this upcoming 4.20 release, they're going to make the Spectre Variant 2 mitigations

297
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,120
optional on a per application basis.

298
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:26,720
This is really clever because the performance hit on these most recent fixes were like nearly

299
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:32,320
50% performance hit, and there's just so many applications that may potentially never need

300
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:33,320
this protection.

301
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:39,840
So now processes can decide to use it via a system call, and then if the application,

302
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:44,520
say maybe it's a particularly secure application, knows it needs that protection, it gets it,

303
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:48,160
but they can decide to take their chances or not, and thus decide to take the performance

304
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:49,720
penalty or not.

305
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:53,440
This is such a clever solution to the problem, isn't it?

306
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:54,440
It needed to happen.

307
00:17:54,440 --> 00:18:00,680
It's taken, what, basically a year for them to solve this problem, but hopefully this

308
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:03,240
is going to be the solution that we've all been waiting for.

309
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:07,080
It seems like the right compromise at least, and we got to keep in mind at this point,

310
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:12,140
there's not really any known exploits on any of these attack vectors in the wild.

311
00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:16,240
There has been theoretical proof, but there's nothing in the wild, so there's nothing that

312
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:21,040
we need to protect against currently, and so taking in some work cases a 50% performance

313
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:24,760
hit, especially on multi-processor systems and systems using hyper-threading, which is

314
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:28,160
a lot of systems these days, I think this is very wise.

315
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:32,880
Well, just because there's no public exploits using this doesn't necessarily mean that the

316
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:37,320
three-letter agencies don't have them, but let's not get all tinfoil hat, shall we?

317
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:38,320
Okay.

318
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:39,320
All right.

319
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:44,300
Well, instead, let's talk about some surprising news, and that was NVIDIA open sourcing PhysX.

320
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:49,240
This is surprising, but it's very welcome that something that is potentially very useful

321
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:55,400
to a lot more than just gaming is being released by NVIDIA, but there is a bit of a caveat,

322
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:59,520
isn't there, that you do kind of need to use it in conjunction with NVIDIA hardware.

323
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:02,800
Yeah, and I don't see that likely changing anytime soon.

324
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:09,080
I suppose if it's open source, it's possible, or maybe some shims could be created, but

325
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:13,800
I don't want that to detract from what this is, because this, again, is like a 10-year

326
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:18,960
investment by a company, and that really means a lot, and there is direct applications for

327
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:22,440
PhysX outside of gaming, AI research.

328
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:26,720
It's particularly useful for self-driving car modeling in game development.

329
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:32,000
It helps with creating unique, real-life-liking animations for, like, background characters,

330
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:36,080
so there's ways that lots of games could be improved, but in high-performance computing,

331
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:41,080
which might be one of the more important ones, things like simulations are being done, and

332
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:46,680
being able to take advantage of the GPUs in better ways could make scientific discovery

333
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:48,480
happen faster.

334
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:51,880
You really can't undersell this, and they're making it available this week.

335
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:56,160
It's already available as a BSD3-licensed open source project.

336
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:58,760
What do you make of that license choice, then?

337
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:04,400
That means that it can be baked into proprietary stuff, and the changes and improvements won't

338
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:05,400
be then shared.

339
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:09,360
I wonder why they did that rather than go in a copyleft route.

340
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:10,360
I'm not sure.

341
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:11,360
It's hard to say.

342
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:14,860
You know, we can't read their minds, and, boy, that would be useful, but when you read

343
00:20:14,860 --> 00:20:19,480
what they have released publicly, they talk about it in a way that they've come to this

344
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:24,480
realization that they've developed something that's foundationally important to the future

345
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:30,560
of research, and they write, we've decided to provide it to the world in an open source

346
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:31,560
fashion.

347
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:34,440
Like, they came to this realization, holy crap, we've created something really great

348
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:39,920
here, and, hey, you know, it does kind of require our video cards anyways, so let's

349
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:45,200
just open source this, because maybe we can become, like, the thought leader in this area.

350
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:51,080
We can become the dominating platform for this type of work, and so there is that huge

351
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:53,560
potential long-term benefit for them.

352
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:54,720
And benefit for all of us.

353
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:57,600
Maybe it won't just be Phoenix where you can get a Johnny Cab soon.

354
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:58,600
Yeah.

355
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:04,320
I mean, we may see a PhysX-assisted projects taking off all around the world, or we may

356
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:07,720
never really hear much about it because it's just going to be one of those foundational

357
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:11,240
low-level things that does all the heavy lifting.

358
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:12,960
But let's move on with our last story.

359
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:13,960
Bit of good news.

360
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:20,760
We just recently covered that Valve was discontinuing the Steam Link hardware, but they appear to

361
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:23,840
already be making good on that Steam Link as an app strategy.

362
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:28,840
Yeah, now there is a deb available for the Raspberry Pi, at least for the Raspberry Pi

363
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:31,080
3B and 3B+.

364
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:33,800
So I have to ask, have you had a chance to check this out?

365
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:34,800
No.

366
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:39,480
I had a conversation with Popey who gave it a go, and it sounds like it's pretty legit,

367
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:47,800
and you got to figure this is probably the first step in what is going to be, I hope,

368
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:52,440
a Netflix-like strategy for the Steam Link app.

369
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:55,360
When Roku started, it was known as the Netflix box.

370
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:58,800
It was the Netflix box, and then it became the Roku.

371
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:02,000
And now everything is a Netflix box.

372
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:07,760
Every television, every microwave, every set-top box, it has to ship with a Netflix app.

373
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:14,160
If Valve could achieve something similar to this strategy, even if it wasn't nearly as

374
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:19,360
comprehensive as Netflix's, but if they could just get on maybe the Nvidia Shield, if they

375
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:23,460
could get on a Roku, for example, because this right here proves it out.

376
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:27,320
If you can make it run on a Raspberry Pi, you can probably get it running on just nearly

377
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:31,560
any of these set-top boxes if they get the manufacturer on board.

378
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:37,600
And that would be a superior strategy than making hardware, because to be honest, I think

379
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:41,600
a lot of us are getting burned out on buying these boxes that we hook up to our televisions

380
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:44,480
and burning another HDMI port.

381
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:49,280
If you could instead get the Steam Link app on something already hooked up to your TV,

382
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:50,280
that's a huge win.

383
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:53,560
Yeah, well, that definitely seems to be the strategy they're going for here, but they've

384
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:57,900
had a bit of a checkered history with the hardware that they've sold, haven't they?

385
00:22:57,900 --> 00:23:02,020
These Steam boxes that just seem to disappear.

386
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:06,640
So who knows with Valve, they seem to throw a lot of stuff at the wall, and maybe this

387
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:07,640
will stick.

388
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:09,280
Yeah, you are right about that.

389
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:13,560
They sometimes come up with great strategies, and then the execution seems to sort of fumble.

390
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:17,080
Well, I'll be happy if they just get it for the Nvidia Shield, although every time we

391
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:19,940
talk about this, I'm reminded about the Moonlight project.

392
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:24,440
So if you're interested in setting up Steam streaming with a free and open source project,

393
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:25,840
go check out the Moonlight project.

394
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:28,280
We've covered it before on Linux Unplugged.

395
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:29,640
But that's it for this week.

396
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:34,260
I want to mention we have some great end of year shows planned, including the wrap-up

397
00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:36,480
of the major stories of the year.

398
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:39,120
And Joe put together a heck of a list, and we just double-checked it.

399
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:41,320
We're checking our list.

400
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:44,440
And there are some massive developments that are on there.

401
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:46,060
I can't believe how big this year was.

402
00:23:46,060 --> 00:23:50,280
So go to linuxactionnews.com slash subscribe for all the ways to get new episodes so you

403
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:52,560
get the regular shows and the end of year specials.

404
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:56,840
Yeah, and you can go to linuxactionnews.com slash contact for ways to get in touch with

405
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:57,840
us.

406
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:03,600
And don't forget about Linux Fest Northwest, April 26 to the 28th, 2019 at the Bellingham

407
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:04,600
Technical College.

408
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:08,100
It is the 20th year of Linux Fest Northwest.

409
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:15,260
They have some big plans, and Jupiter Broadcasting has massive plans, including a live Linux

410
00:24:15,260 --> 00:24:18,080
Action News recorded there at the show.

411
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:20,640
So go check out Linux Fest Northwest.

412
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:25,000
If you want to go, we'd love to see you there, April 26 through the 28th.

413
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,200
Yeah, it's going to be good fun.

414
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:30,740
We'll be back next Monday with our weekly take on the latest Linux and open source news.

415
00:24:30,740 --> 00:24:32,240
I'm at Chris LAS.

416
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:33,600
I'm at Joe Ressington.

417
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:36,660
Thank you for joining us, and we will see you next week.

418
00:24:36,660 --> 00:24:55,080
Until then, have a great day, bye-bye.
