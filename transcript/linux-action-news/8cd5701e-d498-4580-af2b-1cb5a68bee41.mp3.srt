00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,360
Hello and welcome to Linux Action News Episode 210, recorded on October 10th, 2021.

2
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:09,360
I'm Chris.

3
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:10,360
And I'm Wes.

4
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:11,360
Hello, Wes.

5
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:12,360
Let's do the news.

6
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:16,560
This week, we get to start with a significant milestone in the port of Linux to the Apple

7
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:17,560
M1.

8
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:24,480
The Asahi Linux team reports they have a full desktop up and working on the M1, with the

9
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:27,520
small exception of GPU acceleration.

10
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:30,640
Which they are working on diligently, they say.

11
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:38,080
But they report that the CPU software acceleration is actually so fast on the M1 that the overall

12
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:42,880
desktop experience still feels faster than something like the Rock Pro 64, which has

13
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:44,600
native hardware acceleration.

14
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:48,240
But no matter how you slice it, this is a major accomplishment.

15
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:52,120
And with more driver work that's currently being done and already pending, it's just

16
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:54,320
going to make the experience better and better.

17
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:58,240
On top of that driver work, the developers are beginning to adapt and figure out the

18
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:03,240
unique ways that Apple has set up some of their devices, like the NVMe disk, for example,

19
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:07,300
which differs quite a bit from how it would work on an x86 box.

20
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:09,080
That might make you worry then.

21
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:13,640
What about future Apple hardware updates like the pending M1X or M2?

22
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:18,940
Well, it looks like the compatibility situation with future hardware actually has the potential

23
00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:25,280
to be better than just about any other ARM platform Linux currently runs on.

24
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:31,080
The project noted, quote, Apple is unique in putting emphasis on keeping hardware interfaces

25
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:34,760
compatible across SOC generations.

26
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:39,600
The UART hardware in the M1 dates all the way back to the original iPhone.

27
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:43,920
This means we are in a unique position to be able to try writing drivers that will not

28
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:50,400
only work for the M1, but may work unchanged on future chips as well.

29
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:52,640
That would be remarkable.

30
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:59,040
If they could potentially leverage future architectures with current drivers, that's

31
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,040
pretty unheard of.

32
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:04,320
And, you know, Apple's not doing this to make it easier for the team to port Linux.

33
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:08,560
It's because it saves them a lot of work on future versions of their OS.

34
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:12,680
It just happens to be a happy, unintended consequence of Apple making that experience

35
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:14,000
better for themselves.

36
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,560
It means we could have a unique experience for Linux users in the ARM world.

37
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:22,180
And to be clear, it's never going to be as great as if all of the hardware was open source

38
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:25,240
and we had free drivers upstream for everything.

39
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:27,800
That would be the utopian ideal.

40
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:30,760
But it could have been a lot worse when it comes to M1 town.

41
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:37,000
In fact, the project states, quote, this is a very exciting opportunity in the ARM64 world.

42
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:43,900
We won't know until Apple releases the M1, X, or M2, but if we succeed in making enough

43
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:49,200
drivers forwards compatible to boot Linux on newer chips, that will make things like

44
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:54,020
booting older distro installers possible on newer hardware.

45
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:59,720
That is something people take for granted on x86, but it's usually impossible in the

46
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:01,000
embedded world.

47
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
We hope we can change that on these machines.

48
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:09,680
There really are a surprising number of subsystems that make up a modern computer, and reading

49
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:14,480
through this latest update, you get a very real sense of that.

50
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:20,840
And while at first this task seemed nearly impossible, these days it seems like we might

51
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:25,840
have a real working thing in just a matter of weeks.

52
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:29,760
The team says now one of their next major tasks is to extend the basic installer they

53
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:35,560
have right now aimed really just for developers into something official that might actually

54
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:39,360
have wider usage among, quote, adventurous users.

55
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:46,400
Well, Alyssa Rosenwig tweeted that the computer feels so fast that computers haven't been

56
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,840
this fast since before she was born or something like that.

57
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:51,080
Like it really, they are, the team is really excited.

58
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:56,880
I'm excited because I think these have a lot of potential to be low power servers.

59
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:58,800
You know, if you can get Linux running on these really well.

60
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:04,280
A Mac mini maxed out CPU load is somewhere around 33, 36 watts.

61
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:09,240
So it's competitive with some smaller board computers, but with just exponentially more

62
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:10,240
horsepower.

63
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:14,840
And so that's an area where I'm excited for the Asahi Linux team to succeed, but clearly

64
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:16,900
they're shooting towards the desktop.

65
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:20,160
And this installer, well, that's going to mean more and more people can try this out.

66
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,960
Maybe we're going to get more bug reports.

67
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:25,580
The initial version is going to guide you through resizing your Mac OS install.

68
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:28,140
It's going to be intended to be a dual boot scenario.

69
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:29,760
It makes space for Linux.

70
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:32,960
It'll install their mini bootloader and U-boot.

71
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:35,120
It'll set up an EFI partition for you.

72
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:38,760
And then the installer will optionally install a pre-built distro and its bootloader.

73
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:46,080
And well get this, initially it's going to be Arch by the way.

74
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:51,680
Another platform we're watching with quite a bit of interest is RISC-V. Essential bits

75
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:55,080
of support continue to land upstream in the kernel.

76
00:04:55,080 --> 00:05:00,600
And this week that list includes a significant enterprise and power user feature.

77
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:01,600
No kidding.

78
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:04,640
I mean, I could see how this would be important on a server and I could see how those of us

79
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:07,860
that want to build a RISC-V workstation would love to see this too.

80
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:15,540
And that is in Linux 5.16 KVM virtualization support for the RISC-V platform will land.

81
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:21,720
This is a huge amount of work, work that's been going on for a while and has recently

82
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:22,720
sped up.

83
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:28,960
Some patches that came in, some final revisions that went through and it looks good for 5.16.

84
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:34,080
And with faster and faster RISC-V processors on the long-term roadmap, having this hypervisor

85
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:39,160
support in Linux soon means when these devices land, well, things should be ready to go in

86
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:40,160
the kernel.

87
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:49,000
And in user space, QEMU was already updated and has its RISC-V support in place.

88
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,940
Canonical has announced and released Ubuntu Frame.

89
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:54,000
That's for display purposes only.

90
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:59,120
That's because Ubuntu Frame is a full-screen shell based on Wayland and offers compatibility

91
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:05,520
with existing graphical toolkits such as Flutter, Qt, GTK, and of course, web-based apps.

92
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:10,520
Frame is designed for interactive displays and offers interfaces to handle input from

93
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:14,840
touch screens, keyboard, and a traditional mouse.

94
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:19,600
Developers can get started building apps for Frame on any system that supports snaps and

95
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:22,320
should make it pretty straightforward to get started.

96
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:26,680
And of course, as you might expect, snaps play a pretty significant role in both application

97
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:29,160
distribution and in security.

98
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:33,240
And that means the display server and other system apps running on the Frame are isolated

99
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:35,360
from the vendor's applications.

100
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:38,960
This is done by leveraging snaps application confinement.

101
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:43,940
Canonical also uses this to force apps to only talk to the Ubuntu Frame server via what

102
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:46,760
Canonical calls a secure socket.

103
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:50,640
The promise made to developers with Ubuntu Frame is basically that they won't have to

104
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:55,720
waste time integrating and maintaining all the custom code that might typically be required

105
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:57,720
to use Linux in this way.

106
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:02,040
Instead, Canonical will do that and help manage the security.

107
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:05,840
And while maybe not all that innovative and new technology that's being introduced here

108
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:10,680
with the Ubuntu Frame, what is innovative about this is the stacking of technologies

109
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:15,160
that Canonical is already really familiar with and then packaging all of that together

110
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:21,120
and then niching down on a specific market and pitching a solution directly to them.

111
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:25,360
That's a pretty clever package and that market wasn't going to put all these different technologies

112
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:27,680
together and build their own solution.

113
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:30,680
And Canonical can also provide support with the product.

114
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:34,920
In fact, the Ubuntu Frame comes with 10 years of security updates when used in conjunction

115
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:39,240
with Ubuntu Core and Canonical says it's already being used by at least one customer.

116
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:43,600
The Lenovo Intelligent Devices Group is using the Ubuntu Frame in order to make it easier

117
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:47,840
for customers to create smart retail and digital signage solutions.

118
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:52,420
If you are interested, you can get more information in an upcoming webinar scheduled to take place

119
00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:53,600
on November 3rd.

120
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:55,640
We have a link in the show notes.

121
00:07:55,640 --> 00:08:00,580
Another week, another desktop position is opening at Red Hat.

122
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:04,800
This week, it's been spotted that the Red Hat desktop team is looking for a software

123
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:07,160
engineer in Spain.

124
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:13,180
The role will be responsible for quote, developing and maintaining containerization technologies

125
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:16,800
for software development like Toolbox.

126
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:21,920
They go on to say that you need a proficiency and go or see containers, certain kernel APIs

127
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:24,600
and well, of course, the Linux desktop itself.

128
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:31,120
What really seems like news here is the larger meta story around Red Hat continuing to hire

129
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:36,600
and fill well-paying jobs to work on the Linux desktop.

130
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:37,780
Absolutely.

131
00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:44,880
When Jim Whitehurst stepped down, I was vocal about my concerns that maybe IBM wouldn't

132
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:48,360
be all that motivated in future investments in the Linux desktop.

133
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:53,040
After all, they don't particularly sell a desktop product outside of some small commercial

134
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:54,040
deployments.

135
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:58,320
So I was really kind of worried that the bottom line, the bean counters would strike all of

136
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,320
these investments.

137
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:00,320
But I don't know.

138
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:04,680
I mean, it's still early days since the announcement, but seems like we've been seeing week after

139
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:08,680
week almost Red Hat is making direct investments in the Linux desktop.

140
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:13,280
I also think it's kind of like a particularly good kind of sign that they're investing in

141
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:18,640
a tool like Toolbox, which is just it's just a great resource for developers on a Linux

142
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,340
workstation.

143
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:23,920
It's one of those kind of invest in the developers kind of investments.

144
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:29,200
Yeah, not only are they doubling down on some of our favorite technologies like Toolbox,

145
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:33,120
they're also trying to solve some of the harder problems in the desktop space.

146
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:39,520
I mean, just over the summer, we saw Red Hat hire two new graphics developers, announce

147
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:45,000
a renewed investment in Pipewire and improving the video stack for Linux, open a position

148
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:52,480
to finally improve HDR support, work directly with Nvidia to enable Wayland support in their

149
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:59,260
driver, and hire a principal software engineer to work on LLVM and Clang.

150
00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:03,360
And that's on top of the numerous developers they already employ.

151
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:09,480
Projects like GNOME, Fedora, LVFS, and so many others that make what we know today as

152
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:12,480
the modern Linux desktop remotely possible.

153
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:15,840
They play a pretty critical role in the ecosystem.

154
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:19,840
So it was understandable to be concerned when Wider stepped down.

155
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:24,040
I mean, we trust IBM with a role this important?

156
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,040
But I agree.

157
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:29,000
It's also really reassuring to see these positions open up.

158
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,400
I mean, it's more than just words.

159
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:37,120
It's real action and dollars that will result in some measurable benefits for all desktop

160
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,840
Linux users.

161
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:42,120
But that doesn't mean we're taking our eye off them.

162
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:44,920
We're always watching.

163
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:46,400
Linode.com slash LAN.

164
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:50,880
Go there to get $100 in 60 day credit on a new account and you go there to support the

165
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:51,880
show.

166
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:53,440
We host everything these days on Linode.

167
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:57,600
They have 11 data centers around the world and they've really refined this into a lean

168
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,160
mean running machine.

169
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:03,000
Some of the things that I love about Linode is their powerful DNS manager and their overall

170
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,880
cloud dashboard to begin with.

171
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,300
It makes it really quick to get started.

172
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:08,500
I can go check on my system super fast.

173
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:11,920
And also I'll often just log into Linode and look at the different systems they have to

174
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:14,500
deploy or the different applications they have available.

175
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:17,860
Like for example, they have Alma Linux and Rocky Linux now.

176
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:21,120
So if that was something you were thinking about checking out, within a few seconds you

177
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:22,120
could get that deployed.

178
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:25,140
And if you're playing around with our $100 credit, that's a great way to learn.

179
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:29,120
They also have one click deployment applications that make it really easy to get up and start

180
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:32,520
with an entire stack built in an intelligent way.

181
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:35,880
Like maybe you want to experiment with VS Code server.

182
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:38,720
Why not have your own private editor up in the cloud?

183
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:40,680
They make that possible with a single click.

184
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:45,920
One of the features we're always finding new uses for is their S3 compatible object storage.

185
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:49,320
Like for example, we use that with Nextcloud so that way our team can keep working when

186
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:53,600
we're uploading files and we don't have to constantly manage and struggle with disk space

187
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:54,600
usage.

188
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:56,800
So it's one of those things you can really just go check out for yourself and really

189
00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:01,860
get a sense of why it's so great because it's not one particular feature or thing.

190
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:06,500
It's everything about Linode combined with their fantastic customer support and their

191
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:11,920
long term commitment to the Linux community, combined with great servers that have super

192
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:17,040
high end hardware, 40 gigabit connections coming into the hypervisors, brand new PCIe

193
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:22,400
MVB storage, AMD epic processors on the high end, and then honestly combining it with a

194
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:27,080
great price, 30 to 50% cheaper than the other major cloud providers.

195
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:30,600
Linode is dedicated to offering the best in virtualized cloud computing.

196
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:33,280
If it runs on Linux, it runs on Linode.

197
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:36,580
So go sign up today, linode.com slash lan.

198
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:41,520
Get $100 in 60 day credit on your new account and you support Linux Action News.

199
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:45,860
That's linode.com slash lan.

200
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:49,360
And thank you to Ting, linux.ting.com.

201
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:51,240
Ting is a mobile virtual network operator.

202
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:54,680
That means instead of digging holes in the ground to put up towers, they're taking advantage

203
00:12:54,680 --> 00:13:00,560
of the existing large carrier networks and focusing on customer support and great deals.

204
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:05,000
And Ting has a great mix of plans and fast data on LTE and 5G.

205
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,040
Their plans are simple and straightforward.

206
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:11,640
I've been a Ting customer since 2013, and I can tell you there's never been a better

207
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:15,320
time to switch to Ting, the smarter version of mobile.

208
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:19,560
If the carriers had to hit reset today and enter the market today, this is how they'd

209
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:21,000
all have to do it.

210
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:26,280
Ting has plans that start at like $10 a month and go up to like $55 a month.

211
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:29,880
And they have great plans for family to let you mix and match what you need, like unlimited

212
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:32,740
talk and text with just the right amount of data.

213
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:36,920
And speaking of data, if you're just willing to download your podcast and sync your music

214
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:41,240
and do that kind of stuff on Wi-Fi before you hit the road, you can save so much money

215
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:42,240
a month with Ting.

216
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:44,500
That could be a great little life hack right there.

217
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:49,480
And every single plan gets access to Ting's award winning customer service with nationwide

218
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:51,240
LTE and 5G coverage.

219
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:54,680
But the best part, no contracts ever.

220
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:56,360
And it's simple to switch to Ting.

221
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:59,540
Pretty much any phone will work because they got so many networks they support.

222
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:00,540
So get started.

223
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:05,580
Head over to linux.ting.com, check your current phone, create an account, pick the plan that's

224
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:06,580
right for you.

225
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:09,800
Ting will send you a SIM card, you pop that sucker in and you're going to get activated

226
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:10,860
in minutes.

227
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:11,860
It's smooth.

228
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:12,860
It's great.

229
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:13,940
It's fantastic.

230
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:15,640
It's linux.ting.com.

231
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:18,400
The next generation of Ting mobile is here.

232
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:26,960
Go see how much you could save and then take $25 off of that linux.ting.com.

233
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:33,240
After a lot of smoke around a secret SUSE project, it seems we've got some real fire

234
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:39,560
this week when Red Hat staffer and all around great guy Carl George noticed a new distro

235
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:43,200
name showing up in the Apple repo logs.

236
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:46,400
If you're not familiar with Apple, we'll have a link in the notes.

237
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:54,600
Carl saw 38 hits for a rel-based distribution called SUSE Liberty Linux, a seemingly strong

238
00:14:54,600 --> 00:15:01,520
confirmation of a much rumored rebuild of Red Hat Enterprise Linux managed by SUSE.

239
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:05,920
So dear listener, behind the scenes, we've been trying to confirm various rumors from

240
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:12,320
various sources for weeks that SUSE had launched an internal skunkworks effort to create a

241
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:17,560
Red Hat Enterprise clone like traditional CentOS shortly after the stream transition

242
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:18,600
was announced.

243
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:23,040
And while that does seem a little farfetched at first, it's actually, it's logically pretty

244
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:26,880
possible when one sees that this could just be a potential expansion of their already

245
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:31,100
existing enterprise service that they offer called Expanded Support.

246
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:37,980
That service provides patch services for SUSE and Red Hat Enterprise systems, only they

247
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:41,120
like to offer prices lower than if you were paying Red Hat directly.

248
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:46,000
Yeah, so it would make sense to presume then that a lot of the backend infrastructure they

249
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:50,240
needed to build all those rail packages was just already in place because they were working

250
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:53,360
on this cheaper than Red Hat patching service.

251
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:59,360
But I also seem to recall OpenSUSE tweeting some Tonya Harding memes teasing CentOS over

252
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:00,640
the stream announcement.

253
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:06,960
It occurs to me that wouldn't this offering kind of compete directly with their own SUSE

254
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:08,840
Enterprise Linux offering?

255
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:14,600
I mean, this move would kind of be putting themselves in the same position Red Hat was

256
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:20,700
in forcing their expensive commercial Enterprise Linux distribution to compete with their free

257
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:23,960
Enterprise Linux distribution.

258
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:29,120
Isn't that exactly where Red Hat used to find itself with CentOS in the old days?

259
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:30,760
You're completely right.

260
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:31,760
That's pretty funny.

261
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:37,900
Wow, they're recreating the same exact problem that Red Hat moved earth and mountains and

262
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:41,520
rivers to get out of like, that's pretty ironic.

263
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:45,360
And only this time, it's not even the same code base that their products based on or

264
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:48,200
even based on a product that they control.

265
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:51,780
But I'm actually just more struck by what almost seems like an implicit statement being

266
00:16:51,780 --> 00:16:54,500
made here by the Enterprise shop at SUSE.

267
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:56,480
This is the business side of the house.

268
00:16:56,480 --> 00:17:01,640
And they're kind of implicitly stating with this move that RHEL is the de facto Enterprise

269
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:03,480
operating system.

270
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:08,040
And to be clear, there has been no official announcement yet.

271
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:13,480
We'll keep an eye out, but these 38 hits in the repo logs line up exactly with the rumors

272
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:18,720
we've been hearing, even down to the name.

273
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:25,260
Also of note recently was an apparent decision made by CERN to stick with CentOS Stream.

274
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:29,480
Many in the CentOS community have been watching to see where this influential group would

275
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:30,480
end up.

276
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:35,600
When the presentation delivered on September 15th on behalf of the CERN IT group, and we

277
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:41,800
have the slides linked in the notes, the presentation gave a real clear eyed view of the overall

278
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:44,400
CentOS picture we have today.

279
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:48,260
And it seems they've been evaluating CentOS Stream for some time.

280
00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:51,100
And the results have been good.

281
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:57,140
The group said, quote, going forward, we propose to target CentOS Stream 8 as the standard

282
00:17:57,140 --> 00:18:00,080
distribution for experiments.

283
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:05,240
In particular, they liked having access to the latest software and tools from Red Hat,

284
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:10,600
and that the rate of change, e.g. system updates, was not as scary as they initially thought.

285
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:12,800
That's a direct quote.

286
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:18,160
They also liked that the overall system update stability was great, and the feeling that

287
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:24,480
the strong CentOS ecosystem meant that migrating to other options down the road would be, quote,

288
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:28,580
straightforward if an issue with Stream did happen to arise.

289
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:33,480
And their evaluations did show that CentOS Stream had a higher update frequency than

290
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:39,360
traditional CentOS, and it also showed that they had faster iterations of smaller changes

291
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:46,460
in Stream, but perhaps most importantly, they observed an overall much faster CVE response

292
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:48,360
time in CentOS Stream.

293
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:53,600
For those reasons and more, they concluded that CentOS Stream 8 would be a supported

294
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:58,560
and recommended operating system for new installations, and they're already planning to recommend

295
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:02,600
and support CentOS Stream 9 once released.

296
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:05,000
Reading through the presentation, I found it to be pretty fascinating.

297
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,240
It's a quick read too, so I don't know, I recommend it if you're interested in this

298
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:09,240
stuff at all.

299
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:14,920
But I think no matter how you shake this situation, this is a big, and I would argue, an important

300
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:17,140
endorsement for CentOS Stream.

301
00:19:17,140 --> 00:19:21,840
If Cernit came out and said they were going a different direction, you know, that would

302
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:24,040
have been a big loss for the project.

303
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:28,600
And I think it suggests that some of these doom and gloom predictions that came after

304
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:32,560
the Stream announcement, it might have been misplaced, maybe people should have waited

305
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:36,680
a little bit to see how things shake out, because it seems overall, the Linux community

306
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:42,000
now has better options than we ever did before any of this started, and we now actually have

307
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:46,940
like a real enterprise Linux community forming at the distribution level, which I'm kind

308
00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:49,440
of shocked we didn't really have that before.

309
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:55,360
It's a significant land shift in Linux's most critical market, and it's a shift for the

310
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:56,360
better.

311
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:57,360
I agree.

312
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:00,360
And we're going to keep an eye on this and everything else that's going on these days.
