00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,520
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, our weekly take on the Linux and open source world.

2
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:20,500
This is episode 69 recorded on September 2nd, 2018.

3
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:21,500
I'm Joe.

4
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:22,500
And I'm Wes.

5
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:23,500
Hello, Wes.

6
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:25,800
Thank you very much for standing in for Chris while he's off sick.

7
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:31,280
We've got a lot to get through today, so let's start with a huge release from the UbiPorts

8
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:33,640
team, Ubuntu Touch OTA 4.

9
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:38,880
It's been a long, difficult eight months of work, but it's finally here.

10
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:41,600
You might be wondering, why does this matter?

11
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:46,440
Well, if you ask the project, this is really a fresh start.

12
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:51,040
This is where they can build off a new solid foundation, and that foundation is Ubuntu

13
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:52,040
16.04.

14
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:58,380
Yeah, they say that it's the official starting point of the project, because really, when

15
00:00:58,380 --> 00:01:03,280
Canonical dropped the project just over a year ago, a year and a half ago at this point,

16
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:07,980
it was based on 15.04, which wasn't really supported anymore.

17
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:12,860
And so they've been playing catch up, trying to get it up to 16.04, because all the plans

18
00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:18,620
that they have are based on it first getting to 16.04, which is a supported code base,

19
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:23,400
at least for another few years, which means they can stop worrying about the upstream

20
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:27,400
stuff, at least for the time being, and concentrate on all of the cool new features that they

21
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:29,420
want to add, things like Andbox.

22
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:31,840
And so that's why this makes it so important.

23
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:35,160
And it's great to see that they finally got this out.

24
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:38,140
I've been waiting for it for a long, long time.

25
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:39,140
And it's pretty good.

26
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:41,560
I've tried it out on a Nexus 5, and it seems pretty solid.

27
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:45,420
They do mention a couple of bugs with the camera that they're still working on.

28
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:50,840
And the main browser has a few issues, and so they recommend that you try a different

29
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:51,840
one.

30
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,560
But it's a good base.

31
00:01:54,560 --> 00:02:01,520
And this is, as far as I'm concerned, the only hope really, apart from things like lineage,

32
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:06,680
the only hope for a free and open source Linux based mobile operating system.

33
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:10,920
It does seem like there are a number of just small, you know, ease of life improvements

34
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:11,920
in this one.

35
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:14,900
I noticed a big one was the addition of Wake Lock support.

36
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:17,800
And if you're going to be using this all day as your real phone, you probably want all

37
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,320
the battery life you can get.

38
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:23,840
Yeah, that's something that previous versions really suffered from.

39
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:29,600
Even if you just turned Wi-Fi off, put it on airplane mode, turn the screen off, left

40
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:33,400
it on your desk, after a day or so, the battery was just dead.

41
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:37,920
Whereas with Android, I mean, I've got some devices that I do that with, and I come back

42
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:41,320
a month later and they're down like 5%, 6%.

43
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:44,160
That's one of those features you just have to have, especially if we want to play outside

44
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:47,200
the hobbyist space and make this something anyone could use.

45
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,920
Well, I think that is the ultimate goal.

46
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,440
But they just had to get here first.

47
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:56,800
And I've been listening to their Q&As every couple of weeks for the past year or so.

48
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:01,680
And I've just seen the development, you know, I've heard about the development, week in,

49
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:04,560
week out, and it's been getting closer and closer.

50
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:07,960
And it must be a huge relief for them to get here.

51
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:11,040
And I just want to see what they're going to do next.

52
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,040
Definitely a project milestone.

53
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:17,080
Now, if you are looking to upgrade right away, you might find some ABI compatibility issues,

54
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:21,400
but they also have a handy upgrade wizard that will try and upgrade any apps that do

55
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:24,640
have a new 1604 base automatically.

56
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,160
It's very easy to install as well.

57
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:31,160
They've got their GUI installer, which I think they've got a snap, an app image, and a deb

58
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:32,160
for.

59
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:33,160
I use the app image.

60
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:34,160
I'd used that before.

61
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:38,080
Again, worked flawlessly, got it installed on my Nexus 5 straight away.

62
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:39,080
Very straightforward.

63
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:44,800
So, if you've been waiting to try this out, you can pick up a Nexus 5 or some of the other

64
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:49,000
support devices pretty cheaply on eBay or Craigslist or Gumtree or whatever.

65
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,160
I would say now is the time.

66
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:55,580
Well speaking of new and exciting software releases, this past week also saw the release

67
00:03:55,580 --> 00:03:59,600
of Linux Mint Debian Edition version 3, Cindy.

68
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:04,840
Yeah, this is based on Debian Stretch, and this time there's only a Cinnamon version.

69
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:08,880
They've dropped the Mate version, which kind of makes sense if you want to streamline your

70
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:10,840
development resources.

71
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:16,480
But why we're talking about this is I kind of thought LMDE was dead because the last

72
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:20,360
version was released in April 2015.

73
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:25,860
That was Linux Mint Debian Edition 2, and it had a few updates, but we haven't really

74
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:28,240
heard that much about it.

75
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,760
And suddenly, here we are.

76
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:34,760
Yes, we've seen some betas, and I kind of knew this was coming, but it is proof positive

77
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:40,360
that Clem and the team are serious about being based on Debian, at least having that option,

78
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:43,520
that backup plan that we always talked about.

79
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:49,320
And here we are, and I've tried it out, albeit not extensively, but it seems to work pretty

80
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:50,320
well.

81
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:52,600
It's just Cinnamon on top of Debian as far as I can see.

82
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:57,080
Yeah, it is structured just a little bit different than the standard Linux Mint, especially since

83
00:04:57,080 --> 00:05:00,000
LMDE doesn't have point releases.

84
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,040
So every so often, as you just said, we'll see big upgrades to the underlying Debian

85
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:08,960
Edition, and then all the rest of the time, new Linux Mint features will just go right

86
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:09,960
in.

87
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:14,320
Maybe it was unfair for me to say that it's just Cinnamon on top of Debian because there

88
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:19,200
is a lot of Mint stuff in there, things like the backup tool, which is really useful.

89
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:21,600
And they have forked these apps, haven't they?

90
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:25,720
And they have made it their own, like it or not.

91
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:26,760
There's no doubting that.

92
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:29,600
They have put their stamp on this thing.

93
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:32,280
And I think that it's a bit of an acquired taste.

94
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:37,840
It seems to be very popular with some people, but then I hear a bit of scorn poured on it

95
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:38,840
from other people.

96
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:46,580
I mean, I remember they had the security snafu, actually that must be a few years ago now.

97
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:50,000
But they have slowly started to improve stuff like that, haven't they?

98
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,720
They're definitely putting the time in.

99
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:56,120
It seems like a passion project that really has some good intentions but doesn't always

100
00:05:56,120 --> 00:06:01,160
have time or maybe just the inclination to do what we might call the right things.

101
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:05,680
A couple of years ago, they did have that big breach where some infected ISOs were served

102
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:06,680
up.

103
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:10,800
Now, these days, they do host their GPG signatures and their checksums on another site, which

104
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:11,800
is great.

105
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,440
But it is still pretty difficult.

106
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:16,360
You have to jump through four or five levels of links just to get those files.

107
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:22,480
So you can tell that maybe new user ease, they do a good job of having a lot of documentation

108
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:25,460
just about the common issues new users will have.

109
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:28,640
Maybe not a distro for someone a little more experienced and has a little more taste.

110
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:30,680
Well, you're saying that people who use it have got no taste.

111
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:32,840
You're going to get some hate mail about that, I think.

112
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:33,840
You're probably right.

113
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:34,840
Okay.

114
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:36,840
Well, we better move on.

115
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:39,940
Mozilla have been up to a couple of good things lately.

116
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:42,720
First of all, they have published user data.

117
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:50,920
And they're basing this user data from a representative 10% sample from the release beta, ESR, and

118
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:52,220
other channels.

119
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:55,760
And they're properly anonymizing this data, and they're going to publish it weekly, which

120
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:56,760
is pretty impressive.

121
00:06:56,760 --> 00:07:02,400
This is definitely a case of Mozilla putting their data where their mouth has been.

122
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:05,000
It's nice to see this level of transparency.

123
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:09,600
And it does seem like they've had an eye to trying to give good general high level information

124
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:12,100
about how Firefox is actually used.

125
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:15,960
So it started off a couple of years ago with just a hardware report.

126
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:20,360
And now you're getting a lot more information, things like the number of active clients in

127
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:25,320
the past 365 days in an effort to try to round out seasonal effects.

128
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:29,720
And then of course, a lot more detailed things that can be broken down by operating system

129
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:31,760
as well as top 10 countries.

130
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:35,980
It was interesting to see how active the users were in each country, because it's one thing

131
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:40,840
to have the browser open, but to actually be interacting with it, and how many hours

132
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:42,040
per day.

133
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:48,760
And well, all I can say is USA number one, we always are.

134
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:54,000
Unfortunately, Linux, well, I don't know, is this unfortunate Linux kind of round about

135
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:59,720
3% ish, 2.5 to 3% is kind of to be expected, isn't it?

136
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:01,560
Most of it's Windows 7 and Windows 10.

137
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:07,200
Yeah, I would like to hope that is just an indication of maybe one, that Firefox has

138
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:11,720
some good success, even in the proprietary operating system world, and two, that as much

139
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:16,320
as we like to think we represent ourselves well, well, there's just not that many Linux

140
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:17,320
users out there.

141
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:22,960
But you would think that Linux users would be more likely to use a free software browser

142
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:23,960
than Chrome.

143
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:28,600
Although I suppose a lot of Linux users are pragmatic, and if websites don't load properly

144
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:30,800
in Firefox, they're just going to fire up Chrome.

145
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:31,840
That is probably part of it.

146
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:35,640
I think too, there's a lot of applications that maybe have some desktop equivalents in

147
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:40,400
the Windows or Mac world that are relegated to perhaps web apps that work better in Chrome.

148
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:41,960
Yeah, that's true.

149
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:46,880
But unfortunately, they didn't publish any data from the mobile version of Firefox, but

150
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:50,000
they do hope to do that at some point soon.

151
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:55,320
That would be interesting, although I fear that may be even more depressing for Linux

152
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:56,760
users at least.

153
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:57,760
It might be.

154
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:01,800
I will say, Joe, that I am a Firefox on mobile user myself.

155
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:05,040
I've been really impressed with just its general usefulness.

156
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:10,400
It has a really nice save for later feature, and their mobile reading is I think among

157
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:11,400
the best.

158
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:13,880
Is it better than Chrome on Android for that though?

159
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:19,640
Because Chrome's got a fairly good mobile view option.

160
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:25,160
It really does, but I find that Firefox just works better on a wider array of sites, especially

161
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:30,680
doing show research, et cetera, on sometimes some rather ad-filled websites.

162
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:34,560
Between Firefox and Brave, these days, I don't even need Chrome on Android.

163
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:35,560
Ads on mobile?

164
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:36,560
You need to get Adaway installed.

165
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:40,680
You need to get your phone rooted, get Adaway done, get your host file updated regularly.

166
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:41,760
No more ads, Wes.

167
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:45,440
We can't all be as cool as you, Joe.

168
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:46,440
That's true.

169
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:51,000
Well, another thing Firefox is going to start doing is blocking tracking.

170
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,320
Pretty much wholesale, really.

171
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:57,000
Yeah, to start with, they've identified three main areas that they'd like to target and

172
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,280
see Firefox radically improve in.

173
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:04,040
Probably the most important one they're starting with is just improving page load performance.

174
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:08,720
They cite some figures that 55% of the total time required to load an average website was

175
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:13,400
spent just loading third-party trackers, which, hey, I don't want that slowdown.

176
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:15,120
That is pretty bad.

177
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:18,920
You'd think that in the days of GDPR, that would have been tightened up a little bit,

178
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:20,800
but apparently not.

179
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:23,960
Think before you include those JavaScript links, everybody.

180
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:27,240
Yeah, yeah, the Facebook buttons and all that.

181
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:28,240
Exactly.

182
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:30,480
And they also want to cut down on cross-site tracking, don't they?

183
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:34,600
Yeah, they make a pretty strong analogy here that in the physical world, as you're walking

184
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:38,960
from store to store and shopping around, you really don't expect people to be following

185
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:43,240
you and spying just about on everything you look at, let alone purchase.

186
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:44,240
And you know what?

187
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:47,820
You should have that same privacy expectation on the web.

188
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:53,320
So starting with maybe Firefox 65, if all things go well, Firefox will strip cookies

189
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:57,000
and block storage access from third-party tracking content.

190
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,080
But you can actually enable this right now in Firefox Nightly.

191
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:05,800
If you go to linuxactionnews.com.69, you'll see a link to the blog post about this detailing

192
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:06,800
how to do it.

193
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,600
It's fairly straightforward.

194
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:12,760
And I'm tempted, I'm tempted to get on the Nightly just to get this stuff going already.

195
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:17,200
Because they also talk about blocking fingerprinting and crypto mining.

196
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:23,080
It's a bit random to lump them together, but with the fingerprinting, each person's browser

197
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:29,200
is potentially unique based on all sorts of things like the extensions you've got installed,

198
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:32,040
the resolution of your screen, even things like theming.

199
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:36,300
Yeah, there's really an incredible number of ways for clever and motivated people to

200
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:37,560
track you on the web.

201
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:41,360
I know the list of fonts you have installed can also be a big giveaway there.

202
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:45,240
Masala's calling these quote unquote harmful practices.

203
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:48,200
And you know, I certainly don't want to be tracked without my consent.

204
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:53,080
And I certainly don't want my browser's time and my CPU and my power bill used to mine

205
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:56,680
cryptocurrency for someone's third-party website.

206
00:11:56,680 --> 00:12:01,560
What's particularly interesting about this is it seems like a real power play against

207
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:07,920
Google and Chrome specifically, because Google, they just can't do this with Chrome.

208
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:11,700
Their business model depends on tracking and selling you ads based on that.

209
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:15,380
So I just don't see how they could possibly implement this.

210
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:19,800
And it seems like Mozilla might have the upper hand here.

211
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:23,340
It really does show where the differing motivations, you know, Google wants to make a nice browser

212
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:27,200
so that you have a good time on the web using their products and their, you know, and their

213
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:32,220
cohorts products, Firefox and Mozilla behind them seem to be genuinely interested in an

214
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:36,640
open internet that allows people to have privacy, but still engage in all the wonderful things

215
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:37,640
that the internet provides.

216
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:42,200
I like how they put it that, you know, some sites will still continue to want user data

217
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:43,840
in exchange for content.

218
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:48,560
But after these Firefox changes, they'll actually have to ask for it, which is a great change,

219
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:52,120
especially for people, you know, who may not be listening to this program, even who don't

220
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:55,200
really know what they're giving away when they visit all these sites.

221
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:58,360
At least with after these changes, you'll have an idea of just what you're giving away

222
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:01,600
in exchange for all those top 10 lists.

223
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:02,600
Yeah.

224
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:06,440
And I do like to bash Mozilla sometimes and say they've got loads of money and they just

225
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:08,080
spend it on thriftless things.

226
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:14,320
But these two stories here really show that they are a good organization, and we are really

227
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:17,420
lucky to have them and people like the EFF.

228
00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:21,420
So I would urge you if you've stopped using Firefox, give it another go.

229
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:23,960
It has improved markedly over the last few releases.

230
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:25,600
It's got faster.

231
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:28,520
Now we're starting to get stuff like this coming in there.

232
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:32,220
I think you have to vote with your feet, don't you, or vote with your mouse or whatever.

233
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:34,320
And start using Firefox again.

234
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:35,320
It's great.

235
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:41,280
Well, whatever you may think of Google and their open source, semi open source browser,

236
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:46,040
there's another Google open source project you probably can't stop hearing about.

237
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:47,040
That's Kubernetes.

238
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:52,880
And, well, there's some big news in the, let's say, delicate relationship between the two.

239
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:58,600
Now a cynical person might say that they have handed off Kubernetes to the community now

240
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:05,840
and said, here, have a nice $9 million donation of Google Cloud time and, you know, run your

241
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:06,920
project with that.

242
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:10,600
But we're not interested in taking care of it anymore.

243
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,480
You know, you're a community.

244
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:13,480
Run with it.

245
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:15,040
But am I being too cynical there?

246
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:17,080
I think it's a reasonable question.

247
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:22,320
This is a three year grant of $9 million worth of cloud credits for Google Cloud.

248
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:27,200
So we'll maybe know a little bit more about the true character after three, four, five

249
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,240
years.

250
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:32,520
But a less cynical way to look at it is that Kubernetes is an open source project.

251
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:35,200
And so, you know, anyone can go contribute it, especially if you're a company that's

252
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:37,440
using it and want to feel like you have a stake.

253
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:42,520
But up until now, Google has been the one deciding when a new release got cut.

254
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:46,560
And they were the sole people in charge of all of the development infrastructure, the

255
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:50,600
CI CD systems, the servers that hosted all the container downloads that you need to actually

256
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:55,760
run the project, as well as just general stewardship of the project.

257
00:14:55,760 --> 00:15:00,000
As they say, they believe that all aspects of a mature open source project, including

258
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:04,620
its testing release infrastructure should be maintained by the people developing it.

259
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:09,400
So with this change, under the governance of the cloud native Computing Foundation,

260
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:14,000
Google is now just one other company that happens to be a sponsor and isn't some weird

261
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
mastermind.

262
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,080
So in a way, this is actually better for the project, then probably.

263
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:22,280
Yeah, I think it signals sort of a new phase, you know, Kubernetes has gone from just sort

264
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:27,400
of something to watch to a, you know, nascent, but not quite mature project to something

265
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:33,440
now that runs real production business critical applications in a huge number of large scale

266
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:34,440
enterprises.

267
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:38,640
And this move kind of goes along with that there is a consortium of companies and just

268
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:42,320
open source contributors involved, and now the governance structure will reflect that

269
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:43,320
a little better.

270
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:47,060
Well, it sounds like this change isn't going to have immediate effect.

271
00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:50,080
It's going to kind of be a slow transition, isn't it?

272
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:55,240
So the only thing we can do is watch and wait on this one and see exactly how it shakes

273
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:56,240
out.

274
00:15:56,240 --> 00:16:00,920
But it sounds from what you've said to be overall, a positive thing, I think a sign

275
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:03,520
of a maturing project with years to come.

276
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:08,440
Well, a court case that Google have been involved in, I think it's fair to describe as mature

277
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:12,640
or having dragged on for far too long at this point.

278
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:19,160
And that is their dispute with Oracle about Android and the various Java APIs, which may

279
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:25,360
or may not have been fair use, may or may not have been copyrightable, may or may not

280
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:29,480
end up costing Google the best part of $9 billion.

281
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:37,320
Well, Google were very much hoping to be able to appeal the latest decision, which went

282
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:39,740
against them, but that has not gone well.

283
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:45,040
So they only have two options left now, either pay the money to Oracle or take it to the

284
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:47,040
Supreme Court.

285
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:48,440
Something tells me it's going to be the latter.

286
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:52,640
I mean, there's only one way to fight Oracle and that's with more lawyers.

287
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:53,640
Yeah.

288
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:57,600
When this came up last time, that's what I said, the lawyers, they're the only winners

289
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:58,600
in this.

290
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:02,880
They just keep getting paid for this to go backwards and forwards, backwards and forwards.

291
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:06,720
But it doesn't look good for Google, I don't think.

292
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:12,160
There are emails basically proving that they knew they should have licensed Java when they

293
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:13,840
didn't.

294
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:19,920
And not many people like Oracle, I suppose not many people like Google these days, but

295
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:22,240
I just don't think it's going to work out for Google.

296
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:25,040
I think they are going to ultimately have to pay, whether it's going to be the full

297
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:30,840
$8.8 billion, we'll see, but I think they're going to have to pay something.

298
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:33,280
But I mean, that's not even that much money to Google, is it?

299
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:36,760
Okay, it's a little bit to them, but it's not going to ruin them.

300
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:41,520
No, it's definitely I think, whether or not Google has to pay money, I just sort of worry

301
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:43,960
about the precedent this sets.

302
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:49,720
A lot of the technology, especially the internet and Unix based systems have relied on open

303
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:56,960
interfaces and basically open API's that anyone could implement.

304
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:01,360
Especially today where Java is still a hugely popular platform, and systems that run on

305
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:05,800
it are on your mobile phone, on the servers that power the apps on your mobile phone.

306
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:10,220
It does, I think, have a worrying sense that it could stymie some of the wonderful open

307
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:13,760
culture that we've been trying and maybe not succeeding to create.

308
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:17,880
Well, that's a fair point and a fair worry, but I don't think that changes the facts of

309
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:18,880
this case.

310
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:24,760
And okay, I'm not a lawyer, and all the rest of it, but I stand by it that I think this

311
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:26,720
is going to end badly for Google.

312
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:30,480
And I really hope that you're wrong that it doesn't have a knock on effect, but I fear

313
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:31,760
that you may be right.

314
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:35,920
Unfortunately, we just don't have a great legal tradition of understanding the implications

315
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:38,040
of our decisions around technology.

316
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:39,040
Yep.

317
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:43,520
All right, well, let's end on a bit of a fun one.

318
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:50,560
It turns out that blockchain is way older as a technology than Bitcoin.

319
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:53,040
In fact, it goes all the way back to 1991.

320
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:59,400
Now, Joe, I don't know about you, but when I think about blockchain, Bitcoin is what

321
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:04,400
comes to my mind and really, I guess, just a way to have a database that's maintained

322
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:10,360
by the network of users and secured through some sort of verifiable cryptography.

323
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:16,240
But really, blockchains, insofar as they constitute just like a chronological chain of hashed

324
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:21,280
data, were first invented by cryptographers Stuart Haber and Scott Stornetta way back

325
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:26,720
in 1991, as you said, and well, their use cases were a lot less ambitious.

326
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:31,600
Yeah, really, they just wanted to timestamp some digital documents and verify that they

327
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:33,200
were authentic.

328
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:37,880
It wasn't about billion dollar ICOs and all of that for them.

329
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:43,680
It was just they wanted a way to prove that these particular documents were what they

330
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:48,600
were and when they were in the physical world, we already have a variety of mundane ways

331
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:49,600
to do that, right?

332
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:53,600
You can send yourself something in a sealed envelope, or you can make a bunch of chronological

333
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:58,560
entries in a secure notebook, but verifying authenticity and that no one has actually

334
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:01,560
mangled a digital document, that's a lot harder.

335
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:06,600
Yeah, so these guys started a company called surety, I think that's how you say it.

336
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:09,920
And their main product was a thing called absolute proof.

337
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:15,760
And really, it was just a cryptographically secure seal on these digital documents.

338
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:21,840
But they solved this problem of making this ledger public in a really interesting way.

339
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:27,280
Instead of relying on a whole network of servers eating power crunching a bunch of math to

340
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:32,720
maintain the security and integrity of the distributed ledger, well, surety was in some

341
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:36,040
ways just a bit more clever.

342
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:43,240
Now instead of uploading any sensitive consumer information or posting it publicly, instead,

343
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:48,440
surety would create a unique hash of all the new seals added to its database every week,

344
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:51,440
and then they publish that hash value in the New York Times.

345
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:55,600
Yeah, in the classified section, which must have been super cheap.

346
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:58,320
And they've been doing that every week since the 90s.

347
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:03,000
Yeah, if you go look and find it, you'll see right under notices and lost and found some

348
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:07,520
just strange looking series of digits and numbers, which you'll probably recognize as

349
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:09,100
a cryptographic hash.

350
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:14,460
And talk about distributed, even now, they still have a print circulation of over half

351
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:21,880
a million copies per edition, which means that it would be extremely difficult to tamper

352
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:22,880
with those.

353
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:24,440
There's just too many of them.

354
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:29,520
Yeah, really about the only way to invalidate the claims that they've published would be

355
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:33,560
to make a fake paper with fake hashes and be able to have a wider distribution.

356
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:36,400
I don't know about you, Joe, but I just don't have that much paper.

357
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:38,880
Yeah, not to mention all the ink.

358
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:41,200
But come on, newspapers are old technology.

359
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:43,380
Surely you want to keep up with all the new stuff.

360
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:49,080
And the best way to do that is go to linuxactionnews.com subscribe for all the ways to get new episodes

361
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:53,440
and linuxactionnews.com contact for ways to get in touch.

362

And don't forget you can support the whole network at the Patreon page patreon.com slash

363
00:21:57,540 --> 00:21:58,980
Jupiter signal.

364
00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:02,660
We'll be back next Monday with our weekly take on the latest Linux and open source news.

365
00:22:02,660 --> 00:22:04,280
I'm at Westpane.

366
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:06,240
I'm at Joe Rissington.

367
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:25,520
Thanks for joining us and we'll see you next week.
