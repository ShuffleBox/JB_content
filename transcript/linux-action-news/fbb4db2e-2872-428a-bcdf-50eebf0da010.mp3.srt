00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,900
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, episode 126, recorded on October 6, 2019.

2
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:10,900
I'm Chris.

3
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:11,900
And I'm Joe.

4
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:12,900
Hello, Joe.

5
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:14,180
Good to be connected with you.

6
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:19,380
We kick the show off today with a project that just seems to be getting better all the

7
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:20,380
time.

8
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:21,380
Yeah, Nextcloud.

9
00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:26,060
They've released version 17, and this feels like a very enterprise-y release to me.

10
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:27,740
I think there's no doubt about it.

11
00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:31,840
Indeed, this has to be the result of some large deployments that have come back with

12
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:35,780
individual feature requests and driven some of this development.

13
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:39,820
I've kind of gotten that just having some chats with the Nextcloud project.

14
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:43,340
This release, though, brings a couple of major features that are in line with that.

15
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:48,480
Remote wipe allows administrators to forcibly clean files from remote devices.

16
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:50,980
You know, maybe like a laptop is stolen.

17
00:00:50,980 --> 00:00:55,960
They've made big improvements to both secure document viewing and watermarking, as well

18
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:59,860
as implemented their new text editor, which they say is distraction-free.

19
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:04,100
It is also a live collaborative text editor.

20
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:07,540
It's one that we've done some testing with recently in-house, and it is pretty great.

21
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:08,540
Supports markdown as well.

22
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:11,940
And there's other things in here that are very enterprise-y.

23
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:14,340
Improvements to the way two-factor authentication works.

24
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:15,740
Oh, here's a big one.

25
00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:17,260
This is great.

26
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:18,860
LDAP write support.

27
00:01:18,860 --> 00:01:24,060
So now you can make changes to users in an LDAP database from Nextcloud.

28
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:27,180
You could, in a sense, have two-way attribution sync as well.

29
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:28,180
That's massive.

30
00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:32,380
In the past, Nextcloud could read some of that user data, but never have any write functionality

31
00:01:32,380 --> 00:01:37,300
to that LDAP database, which meant you were always foreseeing changes down to Nextcloud.

32
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:42,660
Now networks that use LDAP for central authentication have another option to manage users.

33
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:47,500
And lastly, there's other things in there that really seem focused at large installations,

34
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:53,380
but seem to have, I would say, trickle-down benefits to everyday end users or small business

35
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:54,920
installations as well.

36
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:57,260
You don't have to be a government to use remote wipe.

37
00:01:57,260 --> 00:01:58,260
That can be useful for anybody.

38
00:01:58,260 --> 00:02:03,100
Yeah, and that collaborative text editor, Nextcloud Text, that has got me very, very

39
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:04,100
interested.

40
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:07,580
I've tried it out briefly, but I think we need to do some serious testing of it.

41
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:11,500
It looks like it could potentially replace Google Docs.

42
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:15,500
It's not as feature-rich, but then I think a lot of the features in Google Docs we don't

43
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:17,220
necessarily need.

44
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:23,640
And the fact that you can either write in Markdown or just in completely WYSIWYG style,

45
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:27,820
and it will create Markdown files for you, I think could solve a lot of problems for

46
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:32,820
us because I hate writing in Markdown, and you hate writing in anything else.

47
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:34,140
I think in Markdown.

48
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:35,340
I take notes in Markdown.

49
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:38,420
When I'm writing personal shopping lists, I write them in Markdown.

50
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:39,860
I really do.

51
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:43,160
So for me, it's like, that's a pretty big feature.

52
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:47,900
And I like the idea of these being files on a file system somewhere as well.

53
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:51,900
You know, with Google Drive, you can get there, but it's not just sitting on your file system

54
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:53,580
on a server that syncs to your desktop.

55
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:57,360
Yeah, with Google Drive, it is possible to download the files, but that's much conker

56
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:00,940
than just having them right there as just a.md file.

57
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:08,060
So I think we're on Nextcloud 16 right now for our main team collaboration tool, but

58
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:10,360
I really don't see any reason why we won't be upgrading pretty soon.

59
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:14,940
So we might do that before this week's Linux Unplugged and see how it turns out.

60
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:19,120
I'm a little apprehensive now because we rely on Nextcloud so much as a tool, but it really

61
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:23,820
has become a valuable tool, and when we're done recording this podcast, I will transfer

62
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:27,340
the flax to Joe using Nextcloud.

63
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:28,580
It's critical to what we do now.

64
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:30,060
Yeah, but I'm sure Wes is on it.

65
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:32,540
If it all goes wrong, you can just roll back or whatever.

66
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:33,540
That's true.

67
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:34,540
It's all in a container, Joe.

68
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:35,540
What could go wrong?

69
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:36,540
It's a container.

70
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:41,420
Well, speaking of documents, the Document Foundation has come up with a new way of raising

71
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:46,020
funds for the project, and to do that, they are creating the Document Collective.

72
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:51,920
Yeah, and I'll remind everybody that the Document Foundation is the home of LibreOffice, and

73
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:56,780
of note for this story, the foundation was established in part to ensure that commercial

74
00:03:56,780 --> 00:04:02,760
entities did not have undue influence on the project, which limited the types of activities

75
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:04,900
they could engage in.

76
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:12,180
In particular, selling branded versions of LibreOffice in app stores was something that

77
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:17,420
the Document Foundation could not take on, so they looked for a way to solve this problem,

78
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:18,420
and they think they have one.

79
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:25,300
It is now the Document Collective, the TDC, which will engage in certain commercial activities

80
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:28,940
that they say are complementary to the Document Foundation.

81
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:33,580
Which pretty much means selling branded versions of LibreOffice in app stores.

82
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:34,580
Right.

83
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:38,180
And how they're pulling this off is a little funky, so stay with me.

84
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:44,980
The new Document Collective will work with Public Software CIC, which is a European umbrella

85
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:51,320
organization where Simon Phipps is its director, and they will directly engage in the app creation

86
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:52,960
and putting it in the app stores.

87
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:59,100
The Collective will sort of observe and watch, and then the Document Foundation will benefit,

88
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:00,200
is the idea.

89
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:04,980
And I guess they're working with this third party, the Public Software CIC, to move really

90
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:05,980
fast.

91
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:07,940
They want to get in app stores right now.

92
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:12,820
So instead of waiting around for the Document Collective to get their leadership structure

93
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:17,140
figured out, to get all of their policies and practices defined, they're just going

94
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:22,820
to get right to work with Public Software CIC, which has raised a few eyebrows.

95
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:28,040
Yeah, because Simon Phipps, who you mentioned there, is a Document Foundation board deputy,

96
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:32,860
but he's also one of the founders and the only director of Public Software CIC.

97
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:36,500
So there have been concerns of a potential conflict of interest there.

98
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:40,640
Thankfully, the board meetings, this conversation, it's all public.

99
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:41,980
It's documented.

100
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:47,780
And LWN.net is doing a first class job of writing all of this up.

101
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:52,380
So these are the kinds of things that, as an open community, we can watch and observe.

102
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:56,160
And they are addressing people's questions in their next board meeting.

103
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,680
This stuff's still kind of new.

104
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:01,580
So it's not worth getting too upset or worked up about potential conflicts of interest.

105
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:06,300
I think the reality here is, a lot of times in super small, tight communities, you have

106
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:08,980
people that are wearing multiple hats.

107
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:11,060
And nobody's getting super rich here, right?

108
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:14,620
We're not talking like millions and millions of dollars on the line.

109
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:17,220
Maybe I'm in the wrong business, actually.

110
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:19,580
Maybe I shouldn't speak too soon.

111
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:26,340
Well, it's worked out pretty well for Krita, selling that in the Steam and Windows stores.

112
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:31,280
One of the devs actually commented on an LWN article, saying that they make eight times

113
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:36,920
as much selling Krita in those stores than they get from donations.

114
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:40,260
And the donations are about 30,000 euros per year.

115
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:42,460
So we're not talking just pocket change here.

116
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:47,080
I think there's a lot of opportunity in these app stores for free software to sell itself

117
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:48,200
for a little bit of money.

118
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:53,700
Because getting even $5 when you were going to get absolutely nothing is $5 earned.

119
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:55,420
And they must be watching Krita.

120
00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:56,420
They have to be.

121
00:06:56,420 --> 00:06:57,420
I hope so.

122
00:06:57,420 --> 00:07:00,860
I hope they're watching other projects to see what they're doing to stay financially

123
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:05,740
stable and viable and sustainable and try to take some action when they see something

124
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:07,020
successful.

125
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:11,980
Like you're saying, the Krita story shows us that not only can you fund open source

126
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:21,080
software development, but the reality of that is more Windows users are using free software

127
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:28,860
to do creative work, and they're using less heavily established versions in that ecosystem,

128
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:30,340
like Adobe.

129
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:35,600
And I don't know if the numbers are true or not, but I've heard very high numbers for

130
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:40,540
Windows usage, particularly on Windows 10, because of that app store, like phenomenal

131
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:42,720
success for the Krita project.

132
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,940
That is a bit of a story that's not being talked about.

133
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:47,060
Now I haven't verified the numbers, so I'm not going to share them.

134
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:51,300
But if they are accurate, they are way beyond anybody's wildest expectations.

135
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:53,180
So there could be some real fire to that smoke.

136
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:57,300
Yeah, and I can see LibreOffice doing equally as well, because there's probably more people

137
00:07:57,300 --> 00:08:00,620
who need an office suite than need an art program.

138
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:05,440
But it does beg the question, who would buy something that you can download for free from

139
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:07,620
a different website?

140
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:13,420
Does the convenience of going to the app store really make it worth spending 15 or 25 bucks

141
00:08:13,420 --> 00:08:14,420
for something?

142
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:20,100
I don't know about 20 bucks, but I'll tell you, there is a real convenience on the Mac

143
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:21,100
side.

144
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:24,300
When we loaded up a system for editing back in the day, you would just open up the Apple

145
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:29,540
app store, you would go to your purchase tab and just hit install, install, install, install,

146
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:31,380
install, install, done.

147
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:37,700
And you'd walk back in an hour, and you'd have the entire Apple editing suite installed.

148
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:42,140
It's like a cheap, lazy instant restore when you have to wipe a system.

149
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:44,220
You could script it, you could back it all up.

150
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:47,860
But if it's in the app store, you just log into the app store, you hit that button, once

151
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:50,380
you've bought it once, you've got it forever.

152
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:54,540
And if you really value an office suite, in fact, some people, some people probably feel

153
00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:56,800
more confident when they can pay for it.

154
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:01,260
If there's something I'm truly dependent on, I would rather pay for it, so that way I know

155
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:02,500
it's not going to go away.

156
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:03,500
I suppose.

157
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:07,260
And people feel more confident getting it from the app store in their operating system

158
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:11,980
rather than going to some dodgy website, even though that is, you know, the Document Foundation's

159
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:12,980
website.

160
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:15,980
But still, it's a thing, Windows users, it's something you and I kind of don't really think

161
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:18,500
about as much on Linux, although you still have to be vigilant.

162
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:26,180
But on Windows, there is a real rampant issue of fake software that messes your system up

163
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:28,940
with ads and all kinds of crap.

164
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:34,540
So it's a real problem where, at least with the Microsoft Windows Store, you know, it's

165
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:37,900
almost 95% guaranteed to be safe.

166
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:41,060
It might be crap, but it's not going to wreck your system.

167
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:44,660
Yeah, and well, it seems like a very good way to fund the project as well.

168
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:47,460
If they're really going to make a ton of money from this, then great.

169
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:54,420
Yeah, the elephant in the room is, of course, there's nothing like this on Linux.

170
00:09:54,420 --> 00:10:01,340
And you don't want a project to get too hyper distracted by where, well, I mean, I guess

171
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:05,020
I don't know how to say this, because you can't blame them for focusing on Windows going

172
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:08,740
forward a lot more if it's the sole source of income.

173
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:14,300
It's already probably just by a huge margin, I mean, just huge margins, the larger user

174
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:15,300
base.

175
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:17,620
So maybe this is already an issue.

176
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:22,380
But I do worry that if all of your money, if you make zero revenue from one platform

177
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:27,620
and all of your money from another platform, I do worry how that sets the priorities.

178
00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:29,020
But maybe we're already in that world.

179
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:33,340
Well, I think we definitely are in that world where most of the users of these big open

180
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:37,980
source projects are on Windows, but most of the devs are on Linux.

181
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:41,100
And that's why it's so great when you use them on Linux.

182
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:42,100
It's true.

183
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:43,100
It really is great right now.

184
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:47,100
I just, it feels like a very tenuous balance.

185
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:51,580
And I don't know, maybe I'm just worried that Microsoft keeps upping their game.

186
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:52,580
I don't know.

187
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:54,340
There's probably a lot of fears at play here.

188
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:59,740
But the truth of the matter is it's already the reality for GIMP, for Firefox, for Libre

189
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:05,260
Office, for really any major open source tool, VLC, like I could just go on and on, they

190
00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:07,100
end up with way more Windows users.

191
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:10,580
And so far, us Linux users haven't been left out when that happens.

192
00:11:10,580 --> 00:11:16,740
But I guess sometimes I sit on my porch, looking at the cloud and think, I don't like that

193
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:17,740
very much.

194
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:22,500
Well, something I don't like is how you get Google Apps running on the Huawei Mate 30

195
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:23,500
Pro.

196
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:26,060
I really did cringe when I read this this week.

197
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:28,340
Yeah, we knew this was going to be a doozy.

198
00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:30,860
But this big of a whopper?

199
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:31,860
Wow.

200
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:36,180
So background here, of course, is that Huawei was unable to ship the Google Apps and get

201
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:42,320
a play certified device because of the current trade restrictions in place against Huawei.

202
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:45,300
So they had to come up with their own solution.

203
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:51,000
But we were speculating very recently that they were likely going to leave some way for

204
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:55,940
consumers in the West to get their hands on this device and then install Google Apps.

205
00:11:55,940 --> 00:11:58,780
And we had a couple of theories.

206
00:11:58,780 --> 00:12:03,520
And here we are now before most people can even get their hands on the device.

207
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:09,620
And we have a super sketchy way to get Google Apps installed from a rando website.

208
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:13,020
Yeah, there was speculation as to whether the bootloader would be unlockable.

209
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:14,820
And it turns out, no, it's not.

210
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:18,580
So there's no just installing a custom recovery and then flashing Open G Apps or something

211
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:19,700
like I would do.

212
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:26,420
No, you have to go to lzplay.net and then allow that website access to the Android mobile

213
00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:33,500
device management API, which gives that website complete and utter control over your phone.

214
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:38,280
This is supposed to be used by IT departments who will assign you a phone and then they

215
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:40,260
have complete control over it.

216
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:43,720
This is not designed to give to a random Chinese website.

217
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:48,540
So this permission, this so called device owner permission is getting accessed through

218
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:55,660
essentially an API that Huawei has created that is available on the Mate 30 Pro.

219
00:12:55,660 --> 00:13:01,000
It's really something and how LZPlay even knew about it before the device was shipping

220
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:06,900
is rather confusing because the only way you could find out currently is by reading the

221
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:13,700
docs which are in Chinese and require that you have permission and sign an agreement

222
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:15,380
with Huawei.

223
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:21,300
Once you do that, you will discover that Huawei has implemented Android's MDM APIs and added

224
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:27,740
two extra permissions for a device administrator that LZPlay is utilizing.

225
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:33,660
One is MDM install sys app and the other is MDM install undetachable app.

226
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:35,020
Now this is the interesting part.

227
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:42,140
With this system, an application that lives in user space can be signed as a system app

228
00:13:42,140 --> 00:13:47,180
and the Android OS will treat it as if it's running from the read-only system partition

229
00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:51,260
and give it full permissions of the device forever indefinitely.

230
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:56,100
There are ways you can remove it once you've done this but if you do not, this LZPlay stays

231
00:13:56,100 --> 00:14:00,420
and remains a full device administrator indefinitely.

232
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:04,900
How many people are going to remember or even realize that they should disable it afterwards?

233
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:08,560
Because what I'm picturing here is someone has bought the phone, assuming that it would

234
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:12,700
have Gmail and maps and everything on there and the Play Store, then they get it out of

235
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:16,700
the box and start using it and realize, well, hang on, there's no Google Apps here, somehow

236
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:22,320
stumble across this website through a bit of Googling, allow it all these permissions,

237
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:26,060
get the Google Apps and then just start using them and then potentially whoever is running

238
00:14:26,060 --> 00:14:30,940
the LZPlay has got access to their phone indefinitely.

239
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:35,320
In the link that we have in the show notes, R speculates that perhaps Huawei is aware

240
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:41,020
at some level of LZPlay just simply because they were so ahead of this secret API that

241
00:14:41,020 --> 00:14:43,900
nobody would really know about.

242
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:50,080
But they contacted Huawei for a comment on that and they say, no, we have no affiliation.

243
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:53,800
But this is interesting in the sense that this is something that never would have happened

244
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:58,260
on a phone with Google Play, since one of the requirements of licensing the Google Play

245
00:14:58,260 --> 00:15:06,460
apps is the adherence to the Android compatibility definition document, which clearly outlines

246
00:15:06,460 --> 00:15:09,340
that you do not do things like this.

247
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:12,780
And so if you want Google Play apps, you have to go through the certification and you can't

248
00:15:12,780 --> 00:15:14,180
do these kinds of things.

249
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:19,740
And so they took the immediate opportunity to add this security flag that makes this

250
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:20,740
possible.

251
00:15:20,740 --> 00:15:22,340
I actually think it's great.

252
00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:27,060
I mean, not necessarily by getting from some random website, but if I could use this myself

253
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:32,060
somehow to get Google apps on a Mate 30 Pro, it would just put it on my consideration list.

254
00:15:32,060 --> 00:15:36,460
It goes from probably not going to spend that kind of money on a device that can't navigate

255
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:41,620
me properly to if I could get that device and try it out at some point.

256
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:42,620
I like that.

257
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:47,540
I kind of think the idea of Android devices that don't ship by default with Google Play

258
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:51,780
stuff but have the option to install them would be a perfect setup for me.

259
00:15:51,780 --> 00:15:52,780
Well, yeah.

260
00:15:52,780 --> 00:15:53,780
But not like this.

261
00:15:53,780 --> 00:15:55,780
Surely you want them to just have an unlockable bootloader.

262
00:15:55,780 --> 00:16:00,780
Well, yeah, for you, that's the easy way and probably the right way.

263
00:16:00,780 --> 00:16:06,340
But nothing's easier than going to a website and pushing a button, Joe.

264
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:09,980
Yeah, but sometimes easy isn't best, is it?

265
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:11,900
No, definitely not in this case.

266
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:13,980
Not for a device that important either.

267
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:18,100
But it's a very fascinating story the way those APIs got added and then LZ Play knew

268
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:20,300
about it so fast.

269
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:23,300
Would it be a bad move for Huawei?

270
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:24,300
Google's already shut it down.

271
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:25,380
They have Play Protect.

272
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:27,420
They can detect the device you're on.

273
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:32,860
And from what I've read, it has shut down most of the fancy Play apps like the Play

274
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:33,860
Store itself.

275
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:39,900
Now, even if you use that to get the Google apps on your Mate 30 Pro, the Play Store won't

276
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:40,900
work.

277
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:44,620
Well, I've said it before, but I'm sure Huawei are regretting their decision to lock down

278
00:16:44,620 --> 00:16:45,620
their bootloaders.

279
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:50,780
Why don't we mention an Android Zero day right now that impacts multiple devices, including

280
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:51,780
the Pixel?

281
00:16:51,780 --> 00:16:54,680
Yeah, this was discovered by Google's Project Zero team.

282
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:59,180
And they actually did patch this vulnerability once before, but it seems to have resurfaced.

283
00:16:59,180 --> 00:17:02,860
I guess regressions happened back in December of 2017.

284
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:05,420
They found it and fixed it.

285
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:11,280
But newer versions after that have been found to be vulnerable since Android 8 or later.

286
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:16,740
So Pixel 2 has affected the Huawei P20, a few Yame devices, the Moto Z3, and the Samsung

287
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:21,100
S7, S8, and S9 are also impacted by this.

288
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:23,120
And it appears that it is being used in the wild.

289
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:27,380
So you have Google's Project Zero team who found the vulnerability, like you mentioned,

290
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:32,180
and then they coordinate with their threat analysis group, TEG, which is another division

291
00:17:32,180 --> 00:17:39,140
in Google that goes out and does real world research to discover how this vulnerability

292
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:41,140
was actually used in the real world.

293
00:17:41,140 --> 00:17:46,100
And they came back and said that they believe this Zero day was the work of an NSO group,

294
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:51,500
a well-known Israeli-based company that sells exploits and surveillance tools to state actors

295
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:53,780
as well as others.

296
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:56,900
So they really do a comprehensive job now.

297
00:17:56,900 --> 00:18:00,620
Here's all the affected devices, here's the versions, here's where it was introduced,

298
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:04,160
and then they hand it off to another team that comes back with a full report of how

299
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:06,620
it was actually used in the wild.

300
00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:07,980
This is next level stuff here.

301
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:14,020
It is worth saying that a spokesperson from NSO said, NSO did not sell and will never

302
00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:16,140
sell exploits or vulnerabilities.

303
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:18,820
So they are completely denying involvement in this.

304
00:18:18,820 --> 00:18:19,820
Yeah.

305
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:20,820
Who knows?

306
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:25,480
Although I have a sense that Google is the kind of company that probably measures twice

307
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:29,300
before they name drop somebody, but who knows?

308
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:32,940
Either way, we have another quote from the Android Open Source Project.

309
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:37,300
A representative said, quote, the issue was rated as a high severity on Android and by

310
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:43,540
itself requires the installation of a malicious application for the full potential exploitation.

311
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:47,540
Any other vectors, such as web browsers, require chaining additional exploits.

312
00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:54,240
And also Google has notified device manufacturers, OEMs, and we'll have the patch in the October

313
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:55,240
update.

314
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:57,580
Yeah, so this isn't quite as serious as it could have been.

315
00:18:57,580 --> 00:19:00,260
Certainly not quite as serious as I thought it was when I first read about it.

316
00:19:00,260 --> 00:19:05,860
I was panicking, saying, hmm, vulnerable kernels, well, they don't get updated very often, do

317
00:19:05,860 --> 00:19:06,860
they?

318
00:19:06,860 --> 00:19:07,860
Most Android phones.

319
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:13,060
Well, an up and coming Android manufacturer made a lot of news this week.

320
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:18,100
Microsoft, they introduced new hardware for the upcoming 2020 holiday season.

321
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:22,580
Two devices that they're very proud of, one of which will be running Android.

322
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:27,920
But there were some side comments that Satya Nadella, Microsoft's CEO, made that the Verge

323
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:33,540
picked up on, quote, what is the most important to us is the app model and experience.

324
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:38,220
He goes on to say, how people are going to write apps for Duo Neo will have a lot more

325
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:43,460
to do with each other than just writing a Windows app or an Android app, because it's

326
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:46,300
going to be about the Microsoft graph.

327
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:50,300
All right, get that term in your head, because Microsoft graph is something we're going to

328
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:52,040
hear a lot more about.

329
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:58,220
It's like a Microsoft API and services layer that appears to be OS agnostic to a large

330
00:19:58,220 --> 00:19:59,220
degree.

331
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:03,620
Essentially, what he's admitting here is that if you can't beat and join them, and they

332
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:08,860
tried with mobile and could not beat Google and Apple, and they're not going to join up

333
00:20:08,860 --> 00:20:14,320
with Apple, but they're going to start supporting Android, which they kind of already have to

334
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:17,060
some extent, but it feels like they're going all in now.

335
00:20:17,060 --> 00:20:19,460
Yeah, I thought they were done making mobile devices.

336
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:22,300
But here they are, they're making an Android device.

337
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:29,340
And knowing how Microsoft communicates, I'm reading between the lines here a bit, but

338
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:36,580
going on some experience with this, I think they had some high level talks with Google.

339
00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:39,540
And they said, look, we want to make this product.

340
00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:41,960
And we can go the Amazon route.

341
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:47,860
And we can make Microsoft OS that's based on Android, or we can work together.

342
00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:50,020
And Google said, well, what do you need?

343
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:53,140
And they said, well, we're going to need some APIs.

344
00:20:53,140 --> 00:20:56,100
And Google said, let's do it.

345
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:59,900
And the details are pretty thin right now.

346
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:06,020
But this device running Android that they showed off at their event has the Microsoft

347
00:21:06,020 --> 00:21:08,460
Graph APIs built into Android.

348
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:12,700
I don't want to get too off topic here, but it is a ridiculous folding phone that we're

349
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:13,700
talking about.

350
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:14,700
Yes, it is.

351
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:15,700
You're right.

352
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:16,700
Yeah, you're right.

353
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:17,700
We're trying to dance around that issue.

354
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:19,300
But it is one of these folding devices.

355
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:20,620
I mean, who knows, man?

356
00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:21,620
Maybe.

357
00:21:21,620 --> 00:21:22,620
Maybe we'll get there.

358
00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:25,980
But I think the big story here is this sort of position of, well, don't think about Windows

359
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:26,980
so much.

360
00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:27,980
Don't even think about Azure so much.

361
00:21:27,980 --> 00:21:30,700
Think about all of these APIs and services together.

362
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:33,820
That's a decent-ish way to think about it, I guess.

363
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:37,220
I don't know if I buy the headline story, though, that Windows doesn't matter.

364
00:21:37,220 --> 00:21:41,620
I think Windows is still a nice wedge in their strategic portfolio.

365
00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:49,280
Yeah, I can't see them deprecating Windows any time ever, really.

366
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:51,260
Not within the next 10 years, at least.

367
00:21:51,260 --> 00:21:53,740
You know what it is, is they want the apps.

368
00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:57,220
They want all those apps that are getting developed for Android and the web.

369
00:21:57,220 --> 00:22:00,100
That's why they switched Edge to a Blink backend.

370
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:02,140
That's why they're working with Android.

371
00:22:02,140 --> 00:22:07,140
They want their devices and their services to have all of these apps, all these developers

372
00:22:07,140 --> 00:22:11,860
who need all these backend services and all these nice practical workstations and stuff

373
00:22:11,860 --> 00:22:13,140
that they want in that action.

374
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:16,180
Yeah, and ultimately, they have to think long term.

375
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:21,220
They moved far too late on mobile, and it just didn't work out for them.

376
00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:26,540
They have to think, well, what are the trends going to be over the next 10 to 20 years?

377
00:22:26,540 --> 00:22:29,640
We don't want to get left behind on that.

378
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:37,840
It may require that they put their pride aside and work more with Google.

379
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:43,940
You wonder if the success they're having, supposed success they're having with Edge,

380
00:22:43,940 --> 00:22:46,380
and the fact that Google's handled that pretty well.

381
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:48,460
There hasn't been a big public spat.

382
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:51,700
There hasn't been any balls taken and gone home.

383
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:54,540
There seems to be a working relationship.

384
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:58,580
Some of the changes Microsoft has introduced have even been upstreamed into the Chromium

385
00:22:58,580 --> 00:22:59,580
project.

386
00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:06,860
Perhaps that led the way to further collaboration, or at least maybe a willingness at management

387
00:23:06,860 --> 00:23:08,700
to proceed further.

388
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:11,740
Now we're seeing this work with Android.

389
00:23:11,740 --> 00:23:12,740
Who knows?

390
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:16,500
It seems like a lot of aspirations for where they think this is going.

391
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:17,940
They think this is going to be the future.

392
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:23,860
We'll link to that story in the show notes, but I'm a little more moderate on this one.

393
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:28,580
I think it's Microsoft being extremely practical here, and they'll leverage Windows when it

394
00:23:28,580 --> 00:23:30,500
serves them to.

395
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:36,420
Rightfully so, and they'll work with Google, and they'll use Android when they have to

396
00:23:36,420 --> 00:23:37,420
as well.

397
00:23:37,420 --> 00:23:41,060
It's very pragmatic, and it leaves a lot of a scratch in our heads because I think a lot

398
00:23:41,060 --> 00:23:46,740
of people in our community work from a point of passion and scratching an itch.

399
00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:48,220
It's just a different set of motivations.

400
00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:53,060
They don't really care what device consumers are ultimately using as long as it's connecting

401
00:23:53,060 --> 00:23:55,940
somehow to Azure and making them some money.

402
00:23:55,940 --> 00:23:59,380
Yeah, I think that's it.

403
00:23:59,380 --> 00:24:01,300
It's still like they're such a large company.

404
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:02,500
There's so many people.

405
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:04,040
There's so many things they're working on.

406
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:08,780
They just recently announced that Microsoft Game Studios will exclusively... I could

407
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:11,380
be getting this wrong, I don't follow it, but I'm pretty sure they announced they're

408
00:24:11,380 --> 00:24:14,100
going to exclusively focus on Microsoft platforms.

409
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:18,180
Well, there's no love for Linux in there, but at the same time, that doesn't necessarily

410
00:24:18,180 --> 00:24:20,860
mean that as a business as a whole, they're anti-Linux.

411
00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:26,220
It just means that one division is taking a certain competitive strategy.

412
00:24:26,220 --> 00:24:31,900
I think as Linux users, we're left observing and often finding these weird mixed messages,

413
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:35,100
and it creates a bit of this conundrum, like what's really going on here?

414
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:42,780
When you take it all in total, you can prescribe absolutely pragmatic, economic motivated reasons

415
00:24:42,780 --> 00:24:43,780
for their actions.

416
00:24:43,780 --> 00:24:49,700
I can't remember the old idiom, but it's something to the effect of usually the simplest reason

417
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:50,700
is the truth.

418
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:51,700
I think that applies here.

419
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:53,340
Yeah, Occam's razor, it's called.

420
00:24:53,340 --> 00:24:54,340
I knew you'd know, Joe.

421
00:24:54,340 --> 00:24:56,980
I knew it.

422
00:24:56,980 --> 00:24:59,340
It has been a big year, and it was a big week.

423
00:24:59,340 --> 00:25:03,100
I don't think I'll be getting a foldable Microsoft device running Windows X or Android anytime

424
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:04,100
soon though.

425
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:08,020
But looking at the photos or mock-ups, whatever they are, of that folding phone, it looks

426
00:25:08,020 --> 00:25:12,580
like it's two separate screens rather than one horrible plastic screen where if you breathe

427
00:25:12,580 --> 00:25:14,160
on it, it breaks.

428
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:15,940
So maybe it'll actually be decent.

429
00:25:15,940 --> 00:25:18,060
They may have the winning approach here.

430
00:25:18,060 --> 00:25:23,260
I think LG tried something similar, and it's more like dual monitors than it is one foldable

431
00:25:23,260 --> 00:25:24,260
device.

432
00:25:24,260 --> 00:25:29,140
So all of the strain is on the hinges instead of on the screen, and that does seem like

433
00:25:29,140 --> 00:25:31,580
it'd be a lot more sturdy.

434
00:25:31,580 --> 00:25:35,220
They talk about it in their announcement about even taking some tumbles, like you can drop

435
00:25:35,220 --> 00:25:39,100
it a few times, whereas the Galaxy Fold's like, don't touch it too hard.

436
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:40,860
Seriously, don't touch the screen too hard.

437
00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:41,860
You will break it.

438
00:25:41,860 --> 00:25:43,580
So it's a very different durability.

439
00:25:43,580 --> 00:25:46,860
Yeah, and who knows, maybe you'll be able to unlock the bootloader and install lineage

440
00:25:46,860 --> 00:25:47,860
on it.

441
00:25:47,860 --> 00:25:48,860
Whoa.

442
00:25:48,860 --> 00:25:52,780
Could you imagine if Microsoft managed to be the Android vendor that shipped the most

443
00:25:52,780 --> 00:25:53,900
open Android device?

444
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:55,180
No way.

445
00:25:55,180 --> 00:25:56,500
Not the people that invented Secure Boot.

446
00:25:56,500 --> 00:25:57,900
That's not going to happen, I don't think.

447
00:25:57,900 --> 00:26:02,620
No, it seems far fetched, but you know, dare to dream is my motto.

448
00:26:02,620 --> 00:26:03,620
That's right.

449
00:26:03,620 --> 00:26:06,060

There's a lot of talk these days about containers and reverse proxy and what it all is, is explained

453
00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:21,900
in an extras we just released, go to extras.show.

454

The basics of reverse proxy and some projects, I'll explain, and we'll have a link in the

455
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:26,640
show notes too.

456
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:30,460
