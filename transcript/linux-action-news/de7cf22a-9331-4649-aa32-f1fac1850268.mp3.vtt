00:00.000 --> 00:14.360
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News Episode Zero, recorded May 5th, 2017.

00:14.360 --> 00:15.360
I'm Chris.

00:15.360 --> 00:16.360
And I'm Joe.

00:16.360 --> 00:19.780
Joe, we've got some really interesting stories this week, and the first one that piqued both

00:19.780 --> 00:24.100
our interests is one that's coming out of GR Security, and I'm not sure if it's on very

00:24.100 --> 00:26.000
many radars out there.

00:26.000 --> 00:27.160
What's going on with our first story?

00:27.160 --> 00:33.000
Yeah, so GR Security, they take the kernel, and they add some security patches to it,

00:33.000 --> 00:35.320
and then sell it.

00:35.320 --> 00:41.120
And up to now, you have been able to see these patches and use them even if you're not a

00:41.120 --> 00:42.720
customer of theirs.

00:42.720 --> 00:44.960
But now they've decided to pull the plug on that.

00:44.960 --> 00:48.960
And so only if you pay them will you get these changes.

00:48.960 --> 00:50.600
And that rings alarm bells, right?

00:50.600 --> 00:53.440
Well, hang on, they're making changes to GPL software.

00:53.440 --> 00:55.800
Shouldn't they have to release the changes?

00:55.800 --> 01:01.080
So to give it some context, too, you could compare it somewhat to GR Security to SE Linux

01:01.080 --> 01:02.080
or AppArmor.

01:02.080 --> 01:06.060
In some cases, GR Security would say it's even more complete of a solution.

01:06.060 --> 01:09.920
And so there are folks out there on Debian systems that are all hardened up with this

01:09.920 --> 01:10.920
GR Security.

01:10.920 --> 01:14.160
They're essentially hooked on the good sauce, the good security sauce.

01:14.160 --> 01:17.240
And they base their audits off this stuff.

01:17.240 --> 01:21.020
It's a very important tool for some people that have these installations, and it's been

01:21.020 --> 01:22.500
free historically.

01:22.500 --> 01:28.040
What I thought was interesting, too, Joe, is GR Security is put out by a corporation

01:28.040 --> 01:31.760
that runs it, the Open Source Security Inc. company.

01:31.760 --> 01:37.640
And they did some sort of big company reforming in 2015.

01:37.640 --> 01:40.440
And this is sort of a big bombshell announcement.

01:40.440 --> 01:43.920
And I got to wonder if when they reformed, if maybe something was in the works, a way

01:43.920 --> 01:45.640
to try to get to profitability.

01:45.640 --> 01:49.560
And they essentially say, if you don't want to pay, well, then you can use the one that's

01:49.560 --> 01:51.500
based on Linux kernel 4.9.

01:51.500 --> 01:55.280
It's an LTS kernel, and it'll last for quite a while, and you can just stay on that.

01:55.280 --> 01:58.880
But if you want something new, you have to purchase a subscription.

01:58.880 --> 02:01.200
Oh, what's the cost of that subscription?

02:01.200 --> 02:02.200
Just ask us.

02:02.200 --> 02:03.200
We're not putting it on the website.

02:03.200 --> 02:04.200
Yeah.

02:04.200 --> 02:05.200
It's funny.

02:05.200 --> 02:08.520
You talk about corporate restructuring in open source projects.

02:08.520 --> 02:09.520
That sounds familiar, doesn't it?

02:09.520 --> 02:12.200
Trying to make a profit all of a sudden.

02:12.200 --> 02:13.200
Yeah.

02:13.200 --> 02:16.460
This is an interesting approach, though, because it's like you touched on.

02:16.460 --> 02:21.280
It's taking GPLed software and saying you can't have access to it unless you pay a subscription.

02:21.280 --> 02:24.200
And I don't think RMS would have a problem with that, necessarily.

02:24.200 --> 02:26.800
But there is a contract agreement, I believe.

02:26.800 --> 02:30.140
It's hard to get details, because there's only vague information online.

02:30.140 --> 02:34.740
But it sounds like you have to agree that you will not redistribute GPLed software.

02:34.740 --> 02:38.780
And if you do agree to that, and you still share the code with somebody, like you give

02:38.780 --> 02:43.800
them some of the GR security software magic, they will terminate your contract.

02:43.800 --> 02:47.880
So you can share it, because legally, they have to let you, since it's GPLed software,

02:47.880 --> 02:49.080
but they'll punish you for it.

02:49.080 --> 02:54.120
And it's really not in the spirit of open source and free software, this, is it?

02:54.120 --> 02:56.760
Well, how is this different than what Red Hat does?

02:56.760 --> 02:59.160
Well, Red Hat, the source is available.

02:59.160 --> 03:00.160
You've got Centos.

03:00.160 --> 03:01.160
You've got Scientific.

03:01.160 --> 03:02.160
You've got Unbreakable.

03:02.160 --> 03:04.120
The source is available, and it's just not the binaries.

03:04.120 --> 03:05.120
Right.

03:05.120 --> 03:06.120
Yes, that's true.

03:06.120 --> 03:10.560
But in the same sense, though, they're distributing GPLed software that you pay for with the Red

03:10.560 --> 03:12.520
Hat subscription.

03:12.520 --> 03:16.400
And they are telling you not to redistribute that GPLed software, in some sense.

03:16.400 --> 03:17.400
I agree.

03:17.400 --> 03:19.000
It's not a good analogy.

03:19.000 --> 03:22.640
And actually, Red Hat does make binaries available as well.

03:22.640 --> 03:26.480
So the analogy doesn't quite hold up, but it's not, I would say, unprecedented that

03:26.480 --> 03:32.120
there isn't some sort of contract that almost seems to override some inherent aspects of

03:32.120 --> 03:33.120
the GPL.

03:33.120 --> 03:36.960
Yeah, but even though it's legal what they're doing, probably, although there are some people

03:36.960 --> 03:40.320
online who are kind of arguing that it's not.

03:40.320 --> 03:45.080
But even if it is legal, which I think it is, it's just not in the spirit, is it?

03:45.080 --> 03:50.560
The whole point of open source software is that you make your changes available to everyone.

03:50.560 --> 03:54.840
They would argue that they're putting a lot of work into this, and they're seeing demand

03:54.840 --> 03:56.960
to move over to ARM platforms.

03:56.960 --> 04:00.600
They're seeing demand for Android protection and mobile in general.

04:00.600 --> 04:02.360
And there's no funding to do that.

04:02.360 --> 04:04.080
And there's demand.

04:04.080 --> 04:05.800
People are deploying Linux on ARM systems.

04:05.800 --> 04:10.040
They want GR security, and they want to deliver it.

04:10.040 --> 04:11.520
I mean, what are they going to do?

04:11.520 --> 04:12.520
They've got to make a buck.

04:12.520 --> 04:16.160
Yeah, but that's the argument that kind of just falls down.

04:16.160 --> 04:21.200
If you can't make money from it, then should you be in open source in the first place?

04:21.200 --> 04:22.200
I don't know.

04:22.200 --> 04:24.960
I mean, I can see why they want to charge money for it.

04:24.960 --> 04:25.960
It's fine.

04:25.960 --> 04:27.120
A lot of work goes into it.

04:27.120 --> 04:33.840
But at the same time, they are taking something that has been contributed to by a lot of people

04:33.840 --> 04:36.160
and is free to anyone.

04:36.160 --> 04:39.520
And yeah, they're working on that.

04:39.520 --> 04:42.200
And then they're not releasing their changes.

04:42.200 --> 04:44.520
It's just not in the spirit of open source.

04:44.520 --> 04:48.640
And I keep saying that because there's one thing to be within the rules and within the

04:48.640 --> 04:50.880
law and the contracts and all the rest of it.

04:50.880 --> 04:55.960
But to be in the spirit of open source, it just looks bad to me.

04:55.960 --> 04:57.560
It feels too corporate.

04:57.560 --> 04:58.920
And I suppose that's probably what they want.

04:58.920 --> 04:59.920
They want to be corporate.

04:59.920 --> 05:00.920
They want to make money, right?

05:00.920 --> 05:04.080
Well, I mean, Richard Stallman doesn't have a problem with people making money off of

05:04.080 --> 05:05.080
GPL software.

05:05.080 --> 05:07.920
Here's where I'll give you something.

05:07.920 --> 05:12.160
I don't know if I completely agree with you, but where I do kind of feel like they definitely

05:12.160 --> 05:15.400
win against the whole spirit of the community is they've been around, they've been doing

05:15.400 --> 05:18.000
this for like 16 years in one form or another.

05:18.000 --> 05:20.300
They haven't been a corporation, I don't think, for that long.

05:20.300 --> 05:26.600
But they've been a community, I think, for 16 years and doing this for free for 16 years.

05:26.600 --> 05:31.280
And you got to ask yourself, at what point do you have to make some kind of change to

05:31.280 --> 05:35.320
turn this thing around, to make it in from a hobby to a day job to make it sustainable,

05:35.320 --> 05:36.320
to grow it?

05:36.320 --> 05:38.360
But that, I think, is one conversation.

05:38.360 --> 05:40.760
Then I think there's a second conversation, and this is where I'm going to give you some

05:40.760 --> 05:46.560
ground here, is the second conversation, how they went about it.

05:46.560 --> 05:49.800
How they went about this is rough.

05:49.800 --> 05:51.080
It's brutal.

05:51.080 --> 05:56.620
The change is effective the day of the post, April 26, 2017, that that post went online.

05:56.620 --> 05:58.600
The change was immediate.

05:58.600 --> 06:02.000
No more options, no warning, just done.

06:02.000 --> 06:06.720
We're switching gears, enjoy your 4.9 based release, we're moving on.

06:06.720 --> 06:11.480
And that, to me, that immediate kind of abruptness, no warning.

06:11.480 --> 06:17.120
When you're talking enterprise installations, it's almost like they pulled the rug out from

06:17.120 --> 06:19.760
underneath people and the only way to pick yourself back up is to subscribe.

06:19.760 --> 06:26.360
In fact, they even talk about it in their frequently asked questions, where they say,

06:26.360 --> 06:27.800
what do I do if I'm dependent on this?

06:27.800 --> 06:29.520
They say, well, then you should probably subscribe.

06:29.520 --> 06:30.520
You should probably.

06:30.520 --> 06:31.520
Yeah.

06:31.520 --> 06:32.520
Yeah.

06:32.520 --> 06:35.640
At least what Canonical did with Ubuntu, changing to GNOME, if you want to stay on

06:35.640 --> 06:42.280
community, at least you've got 16.04 for another four years, which you can make your plans.

06:42.280 --> 06:44.280
Whereas this, exactly.

06:44.280 --> 06:48.440
It just feels, it leaves a bad taste in my mouth, put it that way.

06:48.440 --> 06:49.440
Yeah.

06:49.440 --> 06:52.000
And it seems to be that there could have been a different route, there could have been a

06:52.000 --> 06:53.800
different path to take here.

06:53.800 --> 06:59.480
I didn't really follow GR security super closely before this because for myself, SE Linux or

06:59.480 --> 07:02.120
AppArmor has always sort of done whatever I've needed.

07:02.120 --> 07:03.760
But it is interesting to check it out.

07:03.760 --> 07:09.360
You can go to grsecurity.net and if you want to know how it compares to SE Linux and AppArmor

07:09.360 --> 07:14.460
and why I'm making that comparison, even though it's not exactly apt, you can find it at grsecurity.net

07:14.460 --> 07:17.460
slash compare.php.

07:17.460 --> 07:20.740
Everyone's favorite subject, secure boots in the news this week coming from Debian.

07:20.740 --> 07:24.480
The final stretch of Debian 9 stretch is upon us.

07:24.480 --> 07:29.200
And one of the revelations that's come out from that is secure boots been booted.

07:29.200 --> 07:30.200
Yeah, Joe?

07:30.200 --> 07:33.520
Well, it's considered no longer a blocker to release.

07:33.520 --> 07:37.040
So it's not looking good for its inclusion straight away, put it that way.

07:37.040 --> 07:39.880
So it's not that they're explicitly excluding it, it's that they're not going to let it

07:39.880 --> 07:41.540
hold up the release.

07:41.540 --> 07:44.680
So it could come after release then possibly, I would imagine.

07:44.680 --> 07:48.840
Yeah, I would have thought so because yeah, it's kind of important, but they just don't

07:48.840 --> 07:51.320
deem it important enough to stop the release.

07:51.320 --> 07:53.600
And that's the question you have to ask yourself.

07:53.600 --> 07:57.520
If you are capable of installing Debian and want to install Debian rather than one of

07:57.520 --> 08:02.680
the more, well, I was going to say mainstream, but easier distros like Ubuntu, Fedora, that

08:02.680 --> 08:06.880
kind of thing, are you really the kind of person who's going to worry about going into

08:06.880 --> 08:09.840
your BIOS, well, your EFI and turning off secure boot?

08:09.840 --> 08:12.800
I mean, it's not going to be an issue for someone like me.

08:12.800 --> 08:18.000
I suppose it's dependent on who the target is because there are some servers that have

08:18.000 --> 08:22.720
secure boot as well and enterprises potentially for security reasons would want to use secure

08:22.720 --> 08:23.720
boot.

08:23.720 --> 08:27.120
I don't really have the hate for secure boot that the entire Linux community apparently

08:27.120 --> 08:28.120
has.

08:28.120 --> 08:31.160
Having talked to some people that helped develop it, they seem to have very rational approaches

08:31.160 --> 08:32.160
on it.

08:32.160 --> 08:34.920
The Linux Foundation doesn't seem to have a big issue with it.

08:34.920 --> 08:38.960
They don't even seem to have a big issue with Microsoft asking OEMs to include Microsoft

08:38.960 --> 08:40.140
keys by default.

08:40.140 --> 08:43.560
They say as long as it's consumer choice, they don't really seem to have a big issue

08:43.560 --> 08:44.560
with it.

08:44.560 --> 08:45.560
How do you feel?

08:45.560 --> 08:47.720
Because to me, this seems like almost like a non-issue.

08:47.720 --> 08:51.000
Secure boot, either it's on or off, almost doesn't seem like it matters to me.

08:51.000 --> 08:55.800
Well, where it matters is with the kind of person who goes to their local electronics

08:55.800 --> 09:00.560
store, buys a Windows laptop, uses it for a couple of years, it gets so slow that they

09:00.560 --> 09:03.120
can't reliably use it anymore.

09:03.120 --> 09:06.560
Then they start hearing about things like Linux Mint or Ubuntu, and they want to try

09:06.560 --> 09:07.560
that out.

09:07.560 --> 09:13.480
They follow some instructions, and then it won't boot because secure boot doesn't work.

09:13.480 --> 09:17.840
That isn't going to be an issue with the more mainstream distributions.

09:17.840 --> 09:21.440
Whereas with Debian, that's what I said at the beginning of this.

09:21.440 --> 09:25.560
If you're the kind of person who's wanting to install Debian, then you're going to have

09:25.560 --> 09:32.800
the technical skills to get into the EFI and turn off secure boot anyway.

09:32.800 --> 09:34.960
For me, secure boot, I can't stand it.

09:34.960 --> 09:35.960
It just gets in the way.

09:35.960 --> 09:38.200
It makes it harder to boot Linux.

09:38.200 --> 09:43.480
The first thing I do, I got a new laptop this week from entryware, and the first thing I

09:43.480 --> 09:46.880
did was turn off secure boot, and then I've just never looked back, basically.

09:46.880 --> 09:48.920
It's been working fine since then.

09:48.920 --> 09:53.960
But the kind of person who isn't going to turn that off, that's why you need to have

09:53.960 --> 09:55.400
support for it.

09:55.400 --> 09:58.240
But for me, Debian, I don't think they need it.

09:58.240 --> 10:03.080
It would be nice to have it, but I think it's justified to say it's not a blocker.

10:03.080 --> 10:05.400
I agree, and I think you have a good point.

10:05.400 --> 10:06.400
I do take your point.

10:06.400 --> 10:10.480
And also, if you're the type of person that would probably be comfortable installing Debian

10:10.480 --> 10:14.300
and turning on or off secure boot, you might also be someone who would be more inclined

10:14.300 --> 10:20.320
to try dev1, the GNU slash Linux project that is Debian Jesse now without systemd, and they're

10:20.320 --> 10:22.060
supporting new devices.

10:22.060 --> 10:23.060
Are they going to get you, Joe?

10:23.060 --> 10:24.560
Are they going to pull you in with their Chromebook support?

10:24.560 --> 10:31.200
Well, not the Chromebook stuff, but the Raspberry Pi stuff, maybe, because dev1, to me, I didn't

10:31.200 --> 10:36.280
think it would even get to a 1.0, and we're at release candidate two now, so we're almost

10:36.280 --> 10:37.520
there.

10:37.520 --> 10:42.320
Because to me, it just feels a bit irrelevant, because systemd, it's one.

10:42.320 --> 10:47.280
There's no point trying to fight against it, and from my experience, I haven't really noticed

10:47.280 --> 10:48.280
the difference.

10:48.280 --> 10:53.580
I don't really get down and dirty with init scripts and stuff anyway, so as long as the

10:53.580 --> 10:55.720
system boots, that's all I care about.

10:55.720 --> 10:58.160
And in most cases, with systemd, it seems to boot faster.

10:58.160 --> 11:00.440
Well, yeah, exactly.

11:00.440 --> 11:02.480
So that's kind of a plus for me.

11:02.480 --> 11:08.360
Yeah, although I started, you know, Joe, I started as a dev1 skeptic.

11:08.360 --> 11:11.960
I made fun of the name a little bit, and I kind of thought it was a bunch of gray beards

11:11.960 --> 11:15.120
that just wanted everybody off their lawn.

11:15.120 --> 11:19.560
And I still don't quite grok all of the use cases for the project, but I'm starting to

11:19.560 --> 11:24.760
see more of it, especially when it comes to lower-end devices with lower, maybe perhaps

11:24.760 --> 11:26.140
some system memory.

11:26.140 --> 11:30.880
But also, I think it could potentially be a really great distribution to base other

11:30.880 --> 11:37.120
distributions off of that want to do very niche solutions, distros that are very targeted.

11:37.120 --> 11:39.700
Dev1 could be a really great base distribution for those, too.

11:39.700 --> 11:43.720
So as time goes on, I'm starting to respect the project a little more and more, and I

11:43.720 --> 11:47.080
also got to respect the fact that they're nailing these releases.

11:47.080 --> 11:50.400
You know, they're on their second release candidate just two weeks after the first release

11:50.400 --> 11:55.240
candidate came out, and they're already talking about turning their attention to the ASCII

11:55.240 --> 11:59.620
release, which is their current development branch, once Jessie's released.

11:59.620 --> 12:03.240
So they really seem to have their t's crossed and their i's dotted.

12:03.240 --> 12:06.800
Yeah, well, fair play to them, and choice is always good.

12:06.800 --> 12:10.600
I don't think it's necessarily going to be something I'm going to choose on the desktop

12:10.600 --> 12:15.040
or server, but what interests me is the fact that it's going to be available for a ton

12:15.040 --> 12:20.240
of ARM devices, including the Raspberry Pi 1, 2, and 3.

12:20.240 --> 12:26.840
And I have been pretty vocal in the past about not being a huge fan of Raspbian, the kind

12:26.840 --> 12:32.320
of default Debian-based distro for the Raspberry Pi.

12:32.320 --> 12:39.080
So maybe, dare I say it, a properly implemented Debian might be nice on the Pi.

12:39.080 --> 12:41.160
And so it's something I'm keen to check out.

12:41.160 --> 12:45.880
Only once we get a proper release, I'm going to check it out, and yeah, maybe I can report

12:45.880 --> 12:46.880
back on it.

12:46.880 --> 12:53.360
I have also been very, very interested in Google's SDK of Google Home, the whole Google

12:53.360 --> 12:56.980
Assistant AI that you can now load on a Raspberry Pi.

12:56.980 --> 12:59.040
And I'm not the only one that's kind of interested.

12:59.040 --> 13:03.400
It looks like, is it MagPi that's putting together a kit, like a do-it-yourself kit

13:03.400 --> 13:05.600
to create a really cheap Google Home?

13:05.600 --> 13:12.000
Yeah, so the Raspberry Pi official magazine called the MagPi, which is funded and subsidized

13:12.000 --> 13:17.320
by the Raspberry Pi Foundation, they have given away a few things in the past, including

13:17.320 --> 13:19.960
the Raspberry Pi Zero, which was pretty amazing.

13:19.960 --> 13:24.880
I mean, people were talking about, in my day, we used to get software disks given away with

13:24.880 --> 13:28.360
magazines, and now we get a computer given away.

13:28.360 --> 13:32.200
And now they've kind of upped it a little bit by giving away this kit, which is basically

13:32.200 --> 13:39.960
a cardboard box, a speaker, and a button, and then the other necessary hardware to connect

13:39.960 --> 13:47.220
to the Google SDK and get Google Assistant talking to you and interacting with you.

13:47.220 --> 13:52.840
And the whole point of the Raspberry Pi Foundation is to get kids into computing.

13:52.840 --> 13:59.160
And so on the one hand, I feel that this is a great thing, because you've got kids tinkering

13:59.160 --> 14:05.240
with this stuff, and potentially Raspberry Pis that have been sitting in a drawer might

14:05.240 --> 14:08.720
end up being brought out and actually used for this thing.

14:08.720 --> 14:12.920
But then at the same time, I think, well, Google are kind of a big evil corporation,

14:12.920 --> 14:21.080
and should the Raspberry Pi Foundation really be encouraging kids to get more enveloped

14:21.080 --> 14:26.240
in that Google world, where everything's tempting because it's free and cool and shiny?

14:26.240 --> 14:32.560
Yeah, but in the world, in the reality of Chromebooks, YouTube, and the Chrome browser,

14:32.560 --> 14:35.520
I feel like that's probably the last worry.

14:35.520 --> 14:39.160
In fact, one of the things I kind of thought was neat about it for the security-conscious

14:39.160 --> 14:42.760
folks that are still curious, it doesn't have always-on listening.

14:42.760 --> 14:43.760
You have to push the button.

14:43.760 --> 14:46.960
So when you're not pushing the button, it can't hear you, which might be some folks'

14:46.960 --> 14:48.920
preferred way to interact with a Google Assistant.

14:48.920 --> 14:51.160
Well, that's what they tell you.

14:51.160 --> 14:53.160
Yeah, maybe so.

14:53.160 --> 14:58.640
I think the button press has to be used because that's what activates the microphones off

14:58.640 --> 14:59.640
on the Raspberry Pi.

14:59.640 --> 15:01.200
I don't remember the details.

15:01.200 --> 15:05.480
Yeah, well, this kit comes with a microphone, and so, yeah, that makes sense.

15:05.480 --> 15:10.160
But you can hook up any mic and speaker to any Raspberry Pi, and you can sort the software

15:10.160 --> 15:11.400
out yourself.

15:11.400 --> 15:18.160
So you're not limited to just this kit, but if you do get this kit, then it's free with

15:18.160 --> 15:22.760
a magazine which is like four pounds or something, or five pounds, ridiculously cheap for what

15:22.760 --> 15:24.040
you're getting.

15:24.040 --> 15:27.680
And you wonder how much of that money is Google money and how much of it's Raspberry Pi money.

15:27.680 --> 15:29.960
They've both got a few quid, I think.

15:29.960 --> 15:30.960
Good point.

15:30.960 --> 15:31.960
Good point.

15:31.960 --> 15:37.080
Also, you get at least a good project.

15:37.080 --> 15:40.980
This is the thing with the Raspberry Pi for kids is I've always felt like it's great,

15:40.980 --> 15:46.520
but you actually need something to accomplish that is desirable by the average person to

15:46.520 --> 15:49.120
play with this.

15:49.120 --> 15:52.860
Even if you and I might have concerns about the security implications of always listening

15:52.860 --> 15:57.800
devices or assistance, to be able to say to a kid, you can assemble this box with this

15:57.800 --> 16:02.360
little Linux computer in here, and then you can ask it questions and do Google searches,

16:02.360 --> 16:05.600
that's actually an achievable thing that kids would want to get involved in, or actually,

16:05.600 --> 16:06.760
let's be honest, even adults.

16:06.760 --> 16:08.720
And so I do like that aspect of it.

16:08.720 --> 16:09.720
I'm not totally sold.

16:09.720 --> 16:15.600
I would love to say I would love to be doing a story that was a Mycroft box, and you came

16:15.600 --> 16:20.360
with all the kit you needed, and it was just a really great, super responsive Mycroft box.

16:20.360 --> 16:21.360
We're not there yet.

16:21.360 --> 16:22.360
We're just not there.

16:22.360 --> 16:24.000
The Google Assistant is a real product.

16:24.000 --> 16:25.860
The SDK came out recently.

16:25.860 --> 16:28.420
You can set up yourself, or you can get a kit like this.

16:28.420 --> 16:31.320
And I think it's actually going to get people to get their hands on these things.

16:31.320 --> 16:33.160
I think it's going to be a huge hit.

16:33.160 --> 16:34.440
Man, Mycroft.

16:34.440 --> 16:36.760
That was the word that I just kept thinking about, Mycroft.

16:36.760 --> 16:38.680
And the next word was, why?

16:38.680 --> 16:40.120
Why don't we have that yet?

16:40.120 --> 16:41.120
Where are you?

16:41.120 --> 16:46.640
I don't know, everyone had such good hopes for that, and here we are.

16:46.640 --> 16:50.400
They still haven't delivered.

16:50.400 --> 16:52.640
The opportunity's lost now, surely.

16:52.640 --> 16:53.640
You've got Alexa.

16:53.640 --> 16:58.320
I mean, the thing is, even the real hardcore open source people that I know, like you and

16:58.320 --> 17:04.000
Wimpy and Poppy and those kind of people, you've all bought Echoes now.

17:04.000 --> 17:06.720
You've kind of just given up on that whole Mycroft thing.

17:06.720 --> 17:08.600
You know what else?

17:08.600 --> 17:11.080
He'd probably kill me for saying this.

17:11.080 --> 17:13.160
But if you ask him, he'd admit it.

17:13.160 --> 17:16.160
Noah is looking at the Echo 2 now.

17:16.160 --> 17:21.480
He can connect it to his offline home automation system and use it as the voice bridge.

17:21.480 --> 17:26.160
And he was obviously a skeptic, but then working in the studio throughout the last week and

17:26.160 --> 17:27.160
using it to-

17:27.160 --> 17:28.160
He sold him on it.

17:28.160 --> 17:29.160
To control the studio.

17:29.160 --> 17:30.160
It did.

17:30.160 --> 17:31.160
It sold him on it.

17:31.160 --> 17:33.560
And you see the benefits of it, especially when you're moving stuff around and working

17:33.560 --> 17:35.240
with equipment.

17:35.240 --> 17:36.360
And so there is something to it.

17:36.360 --> 17:41.760
And you could, the Google Assistant in the Raspberry Pi can connect all the same services

17:41.760 --> 17:47.640
and APIs and control your lights and all of that in that little cardboard box.

17:47.640 --> 17:51.240
And somehow, I don't know, I'd probably prefer Google than Amazon somehow.

17:51.240 --> 17:52.240
I don't know why.

17:52.240 --> 17:53.240
Really?

17:53.240 --> 17:54.240
Yeah.

17:54.240 --> 17:55.240
I don't know why that is.

17:55.240 --> 17:56.240
I just don't really like Amazon.

17:56.240 --> 17:59.000
I think the lack of taxpaying and stuff like that.

17:59.000 --> 18:00.000
Yeah.

18:00.000 --> 18:01.000
I have those concerns too.

18:01.000 --> 18:06.160
I mean, they're the Walmart of the internet for sure, but I find their motivation understandable.

18:06.160 --> 18:10.000
They want to put a storefront in my house and they want to sell me goods from their

18:10.000 --> 18:12.360
website that I buy goods from.

18:12.360 --> 18:17.440
But Google has a totally different motivation for putting an assistant in a Raspberry Pi

18:17.440 --> 18:18.880
or in a tube.

18:18.880 --> 18:21.480
And that is data collection.

18:21.480 --> 18:24.000
And they're already experimenting with the advertisements.

18:24.000 --> 18:28.680
So if you can ask these assistants, you can ask all these ladies in a tube, what's going

18:28.680 --> 18:29.680
on?

18:29.680 --> 18:30.680
What's new?

18:30.680 --> 18:31.680
What's the report?

18:31.680 --> 18:34.480
And they'll start kicking off your different news feeds and give you a verbal reading of

18:34.480 --> 18:37.200
what's going on in whatever news feeds you follow.

18:37.200 --> 18:40.600
And then now what they're just doing is they're slipping in an ad for a movie, also playing

18:40.600 --> 18:44.840
today at a theater near you, and it's a paid ad that they're just slipping into the feed

18:44.840 --> 18:45.840
now.

18:45.840 --> 18:48.920
You can already see the trajectory that they're going with the Google assistant.

18:48.920 --> 18:56.520
So for me, when I look at the motivations, it seems like Amazon's probably the most trustworthy.

18:56.520 --> 18:57.520
I don't even want to say it.

18:57.520 --> 18:58.520
I can't even say it.

18:58.520 --> 19:04.280
Well, you can trust them to be a company that's selling things, whereas Google, what do they

19:04.280 --> 19:05.280
sell in advertising?

19:05.280 --> 19:09.480
It's kind of a little bit shadier, isn't it?

19:09.480 --> 19:10.480
Yeah.

19:10.480 --> 19:11.480
Amazon just wants to sell you shoes.

19:11.480 --> 19:12.480
Yeah.

19:12.480 --> 19:18.640
I want to take a moment and thank DigitalOcean for sponsoring the Linux Action News.

19:18.640 --> 19:19.640
DigitalOcean.com.

19:19.640 --> 19:21.480
Go there, sign up, and use our promo code.

19:21.480 --> 19:22.480
Here's the thing.

19:22.480 --> 19:23.480
Oh, Joe, we've got to come up with a new promo.

19:23.480 --> 19:24.480
We'll think about that.

19:24.480 --> 19:26.460
But for right now, go retro.

19:26.460 --> 19:27.460
Here's the thing.

19:27.460 --> 19:29.680
You create an account and you apply to DigitalOcean.

19:29.680 --> 19:34.060
DigitalOcean is an easy way to spin up a server on their infrastructure.

19:34.060 --> 19:35.240
They call them droplets.

19:35.240 --> 19:39.240
I call them magic, and they have a great interface to manage it.

19:39.240 --> 19:40.240
Really nice services.

19:40.240 --> 19:42.460
And Joe, have you seen DigitalOcean's documentation?

19:42.460 --> 19:43.600
It's like ArchWiki good.

19:43.600 --> 19:44.600
Yeah.

19:44.600 --> 19:46.600
I use it all the time for all kinds of stuff, yeah.

19:46.600 --> 19:47.600
Yeah.

19:47.600 --> 19:48.600
It's a really convenient way.

19:48.600 --> 19:52.480
Once you get a system set up, they have one-click deployments of an entire application stack,

19:52.480 --> 19:55.960
or you can just do a base system and then go read the documentation.

19:55.960 --> 19:57.040
It's really top-notch.

19:57.040 --> 20:03.120
They're also rolling out high CPU droplets, so if you just need a ton of CPU power, they're

20:03.120 --> 20:04.120
rolling that out.

20:04.120 --> 20:05.120
You can get early access right now.

20:05.120 --> 20:06.620
They've recently rolled out monitoring.

20:06.620 --> 20:07.960
They have block storage.

20:07.960 --> 20:11.400
You can get a machine spun up in less than 55 seconds, and if you use our promo code,

20:11.400 --> 20:12.400
here's the thing.

20:12.400 --> 20:16.280
You can try out the $5 rig, two months for free, and you're voting for the new show,

20:16.280 --> 20:17.920
which we really appreciate that.

20:17.920 --> 20:19.440
Let our sponsors know that you're still listening.

20:19.440 --> 20:23.120
Go over to DigitalOcean.com, use our promo code, here's the thing.

20:23.120 --> 20:28.000
Spin up a droplet on their incredible infrastructure with 40 gigabit e-connections, SSDs for all

20:28.000 --> 20:31.040
of the storage, and maybe some ponies.

20:31.040 --> 20:33.480
DigitalOcean.com, promo code, here's the thing.

20:33.480 --> 20:37.920
Okay, let's talk about Nexus phones and devices, shall we?

20:37.920 --> 20:42.720
This is a story that I've seen floating around this week, and it wasn't really news to me,

20:42.720 --> 20:47.740
but it seems that it is news to quite a lot of people, and that is that you basically

20:47.740 --> 20:54.040
get about three years of support with a Nexus device for official ROMs from Google.

20:54.040 --> 20:58.860
Well, three years if you're lucky, really, because if you buy a Nexus device, say, nine

20:58.860 --> 21:05.400
months to a year into its release, which is not unusual because sometimes the Nexus devices

21:05.400 --> 21:08.720
or Pixel devices are actually very hard to get your hands on because Google doesn't seem

21:08.720 --> 21:09.920
to make enough of them.

21:09.920 --> 21:16.040
And so if you buy them nine months, a year into release, the phone will stop receiving

21:16.040 --> 21:19.080
updates before your carrier agreement is up.

21:19.080 --> 21:21.520
Yeah, which isn't very good, is it?

21:21.520 --> 21:25.680
As somebody who's bought just about every Nexus, just about, this is something I've

21:25.680 --> 21:32.600
definitely noticed, and it does sting a little bit because I thought that was the point of

21:32.600 --> 21:36.920
the Nexus program, was to keep getting updates directly from Google, and I was surprised

21:36.920 --> 21:43.080
when little things like a contract with Broadcom expired, so they just stopped shipping updates.

21:43.080 --> 21:45.440
That surprised me when that happened.

21:45.440 --> 21:49.840
And I used to tell myself that this was fine because the Nexus devices, like the 5 and

21:49.840 --> 21:54.420
the 5X, are reasonably cheap compared to other smartphones on the market.

21:54.420 --> 21:58.440
And so if I have to replace them somewhat more frequently, in the end, it's probably

21:58.440 --> 21:59.960
about the same cost.

21:59.960 --> 22:06.120
However, now with the Pixel phones being $700, $800, that whole math has changed now.

22:06.120 --> 22:09.640
Yeah, and we're talking about three years here, that is the security updates.

22:09.640 --> 22:18.440
The major versions of Android are only two years for the 6P, the 5X, the 9, the 6, and

22:18.440 --> 22:19.440
the 5 even.

22:19.440 --> 22:22.520
Yeah, and let's be honest, I actually care more about that than I even do security.

22:22.520 --> 22:24.520
I mean, I want my security updates too, but...

22:24.520 --> 22:25.520
Yeah.

22:25.520 --> 22:30.320
I mean, the thing is that the phones are not completely useless without the security updates,

22:30.320 --> 22:35.800
and let's face it, billions of people or billions of devices out there running, you know, the

22:35.800 --> 22:40.760
cheaper ones, Samsung and other OEMs, that basically you buy the device and never get

22:40.760 --> 22:42.360
a single update.

22:42.360 --> 22:46.000
People are happily using them, logging into their bank and all the rest of it.

22:46.000 --> 22:51.180
So it's not like it gets bricked after three years, but yeah, you'd think that coming straight

22:51.180 --> 22:57.540
from Google, and I mean, the thing is that if you buy a laptop running Windows, how many

22:57.540 --> 23:01.280
years are you expecting to get in terms of security updates with that?

23:01.280 --> 23:02.640
I don't know, seven maybe?

23:02.640 --> 23:03.640
I mean, I would think.

23:03.640 --> 23:04.640
Yeah.

23:04.640 --> 23:08.560
I mean, XP got like 10, you know?

23:08.560 --> 23:14.000
So in theory, you can buy a laptop or you used to be able to buy a laptop, a computing

23:14.000 --> 23:18.280
device, which let's face it, phones and tablets are as well, and you could get at least five,

23:18.280 --> 23:22.960
six, seven plus years of security updates, right?

23:22.960 --> 23:28.840
Whereas now with these ARM devices, because it's so difficult to update them because they're

23:28.840 --> 23:33.160
all unique and they all need their unique ROM and drivers and all rest of it, that you

23:33.160 --> 23:41.400
get these situations where the kind of shining poster child for updates, the Nexus series,

23:41.400 --> 23:42.640
are only getting three years.

23:42.640 --> 23:47.940
I mean, thankfully you've got custom ROMs and that's something that I have been into

23:47.940 --> 23:50.640
for a long time because I don't want all of the Google stuff.

23:50.640 --> 23:56.040
I want some of the Google stuff, but Open GApps Pico for the win is all I would say

23:56.040 --> 23:57.040
there.

23:57.040 --> 24:00.240
You get the Play Store and that's it, and then you can build that up.

24:00.240 --> 24:06.280
You can install whatever you want, and I'm hoping that my Nexus 9 and my Nexus 7 will

24:06.280 --> 24:08.760
continue to be supported with security updates.

24:08.760 --> 24:12.800
Right now they're basically up to date, but if you're the kind of person who's not into

24:12.800 --> 24:18.000
doing that kind of stuff and flashing ROMs and just wants stock, then you're just out

24:18.000 --> 24:19.000
of luck basically.

24:19.000 --> 24:23.440
Well, and that's really, that's really not saying the majority of the market is an understatement

24:23.440 --> 24:24.440
really.

24:24.440 --> 24:25.440
That is the market.

24:25.440 --> 24:27.960
It is such a niche to do this custom ROMs.

24:27.960 --> 24:34.200
That's why I sort of wince when it even is brought up because it's so often an excuse

24:34.200 --> 24:38.440
for what to me seems to be inadequate customer support.

24:38.440 --> 24:43.320
The iPhone 5, I mean, I don't mean to make this comparison, but the iPhone 5 and the

24:43.320 --> 24:48.640
iPad 4 released in 2012, still getting updates, still getting fixes.

24:48.640 --> 24:54.120
Well my friend just upgraded from a 4S to a 7 and she was still getting security updates.

24:54.120 --> 24:55.120
Yeah.

24:55.120 --> 24:59.320
I'm not saying that should be for all Android phones, it just doesn't seem scalable with

24:59.320 --> 25:03.980
the multi-vendor model, but for Pixel devices and Nexus devices, it seems like that would

25:03.980 --> 25:04.980
be reasonable.

25:04.980 --> 25:08.960
So if you're wondering, the Pixel phones that are on the market right now will stop getting

25:08.960 --> 25:11.080
updates in October 2018.

25:11.080 --> 25:13.080
Which is not very far off, is it?

25:13.080 --> 25:14.080
Yeah.

25:14.080 --> 25:16.020
And then I think you get like security for another year after that.

25:16.020 --> 25:19.640
So you know, take it for what it is, I guess.

25:19.640 --> 25:22.360
At least you know going in, I suppose now.

25:22.360 --> 25:25.360
That was the other thing, Joe, really, is this wasn't really official official.

25:25.360 --> 25:28.920
Like it was not really quite clear for many years with the Nexus program.

25:28.920 --> 25:32.480
So at least now we have some numbers, we have some expectations to be said.

25:32.480 --> 25:38.360
Well they kind of said two and three years, but it had always been from the last time

25:38.360 --> 25:39.360
it was available.

25:39.360 --> 25:42.560
Whereas now we've got some actual, as you say, in numbers.

25:42.560 --> 25:46.260
September 2017, September 2018, that kind of stuff.

25:46.260 --> 25:48.160
So at least people know where they are now.

25:48.160 --> 25:53.760
But maybe it'll drive people to custom ROMs, and maybe even in a dream world, not installing

25:53.760 --> 25:59.080
the Google stuff on there, but yeah, F-Droid and stuff, maybe a better dream on that one.

25:59.080 --> 26:03.200
And maybe convergence will take off, and we'll all be running Ubuntu on our phones.

26:03.200 --> 26:04.200
Oh wait.

26:04.200 --> 26:07.120
Oh well, you never know with Maru, they've got proper conversions.

26:07.120 --> 26:08.120
Maybe so, maybe so.

26:08.120 --> 26:10.920
And at least we'll all be able to play and encode MP3s.

26:10.920 --> 26:11.920
So that's good.

26:11.920 --> 26:17.760
Yeah, so there's been quite a hoo-ha about this, the final MP3 patents running out.

26:17.760 --> 26:22.000
And even Fedora now is adding full MP3 support.

26:22.000 --> 26:26.840
So you could previously decode, so you can play back your MP3s, but now you can even

26:26.840 --> 26:35.080
encode, or you will be able to on Fedora, which is kind of a sign to me that a legal

26:35.080 --> 26:38.560
team as big as Red Hat have got, seem to think it's fine.

26:38.560 --> 26:40.040
So therefore it must be, right?

26:40.040 --> 26:41.040
Yeah.

26:41.040 --> 26:46.360
Well, and to me, the big signal was that the folks that originally held some of the licensing

26:46.360 --> 26:49.040
posted on their website, essentially saying, have at it.

26:49.040 --> 26:51.880
And I thought, OK, that's a pretty clear communication.

26:51.880 --> 26:54.040
It's still not free software fully.

26:54.040 --> 26:59.880
I mean, it's free as in cost, and it's free as in speech, but it's not open source code.

26:59.880 --> 27:01.600
But here's my question to you.

27:01.600 --> 27:02.600
Is this enough?

27:02.600 --> 27:07.280
And is this going to be the death of Ogg?

27:07.280 --> 27:08.600
Could be.

27:08.600 --> 27:13.400
Could be, because, yeah, I suppose now that you don't have to worry about MP3.

27:13.400 --> 27:17.880
But then again, is this not a sign that MP3 is a defunct format?

27:17.880 --> 27:20.760
I mean, it's basically ubiquitous at this point.

27:20.760 --> 27:23.080
Yeah, that was actually what they implied when they posted it.

27:23.080 --> 27:24.080
Was it Fraha?

27:24.080 --> 27:25.080
How do you say their name, Joe?

27:25.080 --> 27:26.080
Do you know?

27:26.080 --> 27:27.080
The Fraunhofer?

27:27.080 --> 27:28.080
Fraunhofer?

27:28.080 --> 27:29.760
I would say Fraunhofer.

27:29.760 --> 27:30.760
OK.

27:30.760 --> 27:33.520
So they essentially said on their blog, yeah, we're done.

27:33.520 --> 27:34.520
We're over MP3.

27:34.520 --> 27:36.020
There's other things we're moving on to.

27:36.020 --> 27:37.640
There's other better stuff out there.

27:37.640 --> 27:39.200
And we have plenty of patents on those things.

27:39.200 --> 27:44.560
But there's probably petabytes of MP3 sitting on various people's hard drives and NASes

27:44.560 --> 27:45.560
and stuff.

27:45.560 --> 27:46.560
Oh, for sure.

27:46.560 --> 27:47.560
For sure.

27:47.560 --> 27:52.400
And the reality is, when I asked you about the Ogg thing, the reason why I asked is we've

27:52.400 --> 27:57.040
recently, for our new shows, been doing a whole new renovation on the back end.

27:57.040 --> 28:02.240
And that includes moving to different hosting providers for our files and doing a lot of

28:02.240 --> 28:03.920
market research.

28:03.920 --> 28:10.880
And Joe, in my market research, what I found was that MP3 is the de facto supported format

28:10.880 --> 28:12.240
everywhere.

28:12.240 --> 28:17.440
And if a platform like Libsyn or another one has support, it's sort of like hacked on.

28:17.440 --> 28:23.520
And if they do have a secondary format support, it's almost always M4A, AAC Audio.

28:23.520 --> 28:27.320
And Joe, these companies, their entire business is hosting podcasts.

28:27.320 --> 28:28.400
That's what they do.

28:28.400 --> 28:30.320
And they don't have Ogg support.

28:30.320 --> 28:32.320
And this is not one of these many companies.

28:32.320 --> 28:34.000
They simply don't have Ogg support.

28:34.000 --> 28:36.820
They maybe, maybe have AAC support.

28:36.820 --> 28:38.480
And they definitely have MP3 support.

28:38.480 --> 28:41.580
So in the podcasting world, it's getting harder.

28:41.580 --> 28:43.840
It's getting harder to distribute Ogg files.

28:43.840 --> 28:47.040
It's costing more because you have to build your own hosting solutions.

28:47.040 --> 28:48.960
And if you have a lot of downloads, it gets expensive.

28:48.960 --> 28:52.920
Yeah, well, hopefully this will mean that people will stop complaining, why don't you

28:52.920 --> 28:53.920
have an Ogg?

28:53.920 --> 28:54.920
Why don't you have an Ogg?

28:54.920 --> 28:57.040
Because MP3 is relatively free now.

28:57.040 --> 28:58.040
Yeah.

28:58.040 --> 28:59.040
Can we all just move on to Opus?

28:59.040 --> 29:00.440
I want everybody asking, where's the Opus?

29:00.440 --> 29:01.440
Where's the Opus?

29:01.440 --> 29:02.440
What about Speaks?

29:02.440 --> 29:03.440
Yeah, where's Speaks?

29:03.440 --> 29:04.440
I want Opus, Speaks.

29:04.440 --> 29:06.760
I want it in VP9, too.

29:06.760 --> 29:10.480
Just I want to take an image file and encode it in VP9 with a Theora audio track.

29:10.480 --> 29:11.480
Why not?

29:11.480 --> 29:12.480
I don't know.

29:12.480 --> 29:14.080
I don't know if we're going there.

29:14.080 --> 29:15.080
Let's face it, Chris.

29:15.080 --> 29:16.080
We should be putting this out in FLAC.

29:16.080 --> 29:17.080
Right.

29:17.080 --> 29:18.400
That's the only format that matters.

29:18.400 --> 29:19.400
I agree.

29:19.400 --> 29:20.400
We can only do it for two minutes, though.

29:20.400 --> 29:21.400
We have to make it a two-minute show.

29:21.400 --> 29:22.400
That way it fits.

29:22.400 --> 29:23.400
Yeah.

29:23.400 --> 29:28.200
Well, that does bring us to the end of our first episode, episode zero of Linux Action

29:28.200 --> 29:29.200
