Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, our weekly take on Linux and the open source world.

00:16.260 --> 00:20.920
This is episode 31, recorded on December 10th, 2017.

00:20.920 --> 00:21.920
I'm Chris.

00:21.920 --> 00:22.920
And I'm Joe.

00:22.920 --> 00:23.920
Hello, Joe.

00:23.920 --> 00:26.220
Good to be connected with you once again.

00:26.220 --> 00:32.040
But this first story brings a pretty big smile to my face, because anyone that's been listening

00:32.040 --> 00:39.520
to you for about the last six months has heard you make inferences and jokes about a really

00:39.520 --> 00:44.140
potential interesting situation brewing between Mozilla and Yahoo.

00:44.140 --> 00:45.240
And that's where we start this week.

00:45.240 --> 00:49.680
Yeah, so it's no longer Yahoo as it's called Yahoo Holdings and Oath.

00:49.680 --> 00:53.880
But we're essentially talking about the company that was Yahoo.

00:53.880 --> 01:01.440
And back in 2014, they did a deal with Mozilla to become the default search in some countries,

01:01.440 --> 01:03.380
America and Canada, I think.

01:03.380 --> 01:12.880
And that was a very valuable deal at $375 million per year, up through to 2019, which

01:12.880 --> 01:16.220
works out at a lot of money.

01:16.220 --> 01:23.600
But part of that deal was a clause that said, if Yahoo is sold, and Mozilla is unhappy with

01:23.600 --> 01:29.300
the person who buys them, then they can terminate the deal and go with another default search

01:29.300 --> 01:32.000
provider, but they can keep all the money.

01:32.000 --> 01:33.000
Right.

01:33.000 --> 01:38.360
And as we all know, Yahoo was sold to Verizon and Mozilla exercised that clause.

01:38.360 --> 01:43.000
Yeah, and have now gone back to Google as a default search and are getting that Google

01:43.000 --> 01:44.760
money coming in.

01:44.760 --> 01:48.080
But they want to have their cake and eat it as per the deal.

01:48.080 --> 01:53.500
But now Oath, which is a new name for Yahoo effectively, does not want to pay by the looks

01:53.500 --> 01:54.500
of things.

01:54.500 --> 01:57.140
And so it is getting legal.

01:57.140 --> 01:58.520
This has all been developing recently.

01:58.520 --> 02:04.420
On December 1st, Yahoo Holdings and Oath filed a legal complaint against Mozilla, claiming

02:04.420 --> 02:07.260
that they improperly terminated the agreement.

02:07.260 --> 02:12.880
And then on December 5th, Mozilla filed a cross complaint seeking to ensure that their

02:12.880 --> 02:17.520
rights under the contract that they had with Yahoo were enforced.

02:17.520 --> 02:21.860
And Mozilla has taken to their blog and essentially said, we just had a good contract.

02:21.860 --> 02:26.660
We did a good job writing this contract and we exercised a clause that was clearly spelled

02:26.660 --> 02:29.640
out in said contract and we're pretty happy with it.

02:29.640 --> 02:32.240
Well, this is all Marissa Mayer's fault.

02:32.240 --> 02:38.000
She was in charge of Yahoo at the time and she oversaw this deal and it was happening

02:38.000 --> 02:46.160
on her watch and she's now long since gone and I don't see who else to blame for it.

02:46.160 --> 02:51.440
Honestly, Joe, this deal was made at the peak of the Marissa Mayer hype where there was

02:51.440 --> 02:55.320
nothing Yahoo could do wrong because they had new leadership.

02:55.320 --> 02:57.440
Why would they ever sell in this situation?

02:57.440 --> 03:02.560
So they signed on the dotted line and Mozilla says the terms of the contract are clear and

03:02.560 --> 03:04.880
they feel like they have a good legal standing here.

03:04.880 --> 03:10.040
Well, the typical I'm not a lawyer, but from my understanding of it, I don't see how Mozilla

03:10.040 --> 03:11.500
can lose this.

03:11.500 --> 03:16.260
If they had a contract, they had a contract, but the way lawyers work, maybe they'll pick

03:16.260 --> 03:21.220
that contract apart and find some thing that was illegal in it and maybe Mozilla will lose

03:21.220 --> 03:27.680
out on this, well, it must be nearly a billion dollars, well, at least half a billion.

03:27.680 --> 03:28.680
Perhaps.

03:28.680 --> 03:33.080
I would bet these kinds of things are fairly common in business contracts.

03:33.080 --> 03:35.440
So I bet there's a pretty solid defense behind it.

03:35.440 --> 03:38.200
But you know, Mozilla has many things that they're working on at once.

03:38.200 --> 03:39.920
So we'll stay tuned and find out.

03:39.920 --> 03:46.140
But in the meantime, don't worry about fake news any longer, citizen, because Mozilla

03:46.140 --> 03:47.140
has a solution.

03:47.140 --> 03:50.600
Yeah, this is kind of a relatively small story, really.

03:50.600 --> 03:58.420
They are putting up $40,000 as prize money for a few artists who can put together works

03:58.420 --> 04:05.160
for an exhibition in a museum in California that points out the problem of fake news and

04:05.160 --> 04:07.640
what we can do about it.

04:07.640 --> 04:09.600
It's kind of a token effort from them really.

04:09.600 --> 04:14.600
For me, this falls under the category of things I wish Mozilla was not going anywhere close

04:14.600 --> 04:15.600
to.

04:15.600 --> 04:17.640
Fake news is a politically charged term.

04:17.640 --> 04:20.800
And different people see fake news as different things.

04:20.800 --> 04:25.520
A lot of people see fake news as just things that go against the narrative that they prefer.

04:25.520 --> 04:31.040
And this post, it comes across as tone deaf to their audience.

04:31.040 --> 04:36.480
I mean, think of the Mozilla enthusiast, somebody who is passionate about a free web, somebody

04:36.480 --> 04:41.280
that wants to use an open source web browser, somebody that wants to further Mozilla's goals

04:41.280 --> 04:45.100
in advocating a free web, right?

04:45.100 --> 04:48.740
That could be like the core really fired up Mozilla audience member.

04:48.740 --> 04:53.920
And in the post, they write, we live in strange times in which legitimate news organizations

04:53.920 --> 04:59.240
such as CNN have to launch advertising campaigns to remind people of what real information

04:59.240 --> 05:00.240
is.

05:00.240 --> 05:06.980
Now, later on in the post, they talk about defending net neutrality and whatnot.

05:06.980 --> 05:11.680
But that is a complete disconnect when they talk about defending CNN.

05:11.680 --> 05:19.900
And just yesterday, CNN had to make a huge retraction on a really big story that they

05:19.900 --> 05:21.120
messed up.

05:21.120 --> 05:23.560
And you can point to one of these things every single day.

05:23.560 --> 05:25.680
Now, some people call it fake news.

05:25.680 --> 05:27.120
Some people just call it news.

05:27.120 --> 05:29.720
And you have a different opinion of what fake news is.

05:29.720 --> 05:36.680
And I just don't really see the long term positive side to Mozilla getting involved

05:36.680 --> 05:40.120
with something that really comes down to often people's belief systems.

05:40.120 --> 05:47.520
Yeah, I think they're taking fake news to mean deliberate misinformation, propaganda,

05:47.520 --> 05:54.800
written by people who know it to be false, rather than journalistic mistakes, which happen

05:54.800 --> 05:55.800
all the time.

05:55.800 --> 06:00.240
Because of perhaps sloppy journalism, you might not properly fact check things.

06:00.240 --> 06:04.240
But to me, at least, there is a distinction there.

06:04.240 --> 06:07.160
That to me is what it felt like they were getting at there.

06:07.160 --> 06:08.160
That makes sense.

06:08.160 --> 06:09.760
I like that interpretation of it.

06:09.760 --> 06:13.920
I think the reason why I have a disconnect is because it's these statements, and these

06:13.920 --> 06:20.720
pro net neutrality statements, and then they do these hand wavy mentions to mixed reality

06:20.720 --> 06:25.940
art demonstrations that include 3D virtual content, which can be integrated with someone's

06:25.940 --> 06:30.780
perception of the physical world around them, from simple enhancements of everyday experience

06:30.780 --> 06:36.900
with augmented reality to completely synthesize immersive virtual reality worlds, all in variations

06:36.900 --> 06:37.940
in between.

06:37.940 --> 06:40.360
You can read more about it here, and they give you a link.

06:40.360 --> 06:45.920
And that sounds like a bunch of hand wavy BS.

06:45.920 --> 06:51.900
It is a subjective content, fake news, that's a subjective subject, with a subjective goal

06:51.900 --> 06:54.080
that when I read it, doesn't even make any sense to me, really.

06:54.080 --> 06:55.800
I don't get what they're going for here.

06:55.800 --> 06:59.120
And then the prize is $40,000?

06:59.120 --> 07:03.400
How about you give $40,000 to extension developers that have to completely rebuild their extensions

07:03.400 --> 07:05.080
to make it work with Firefox Quantum?

07:05.080 --> 07:06.080
I just don't get it, Joe.

07:06.080 --> 07:07.080
I'm sorry.

07:07.080 --> 07:10.720
I know it can be negative, but I simply don't see it as money well spent.

07:10.720 --> 07:12.160
Well, I have to agree there.

07:12.160 --> 07:16.600
There are far better things they could be spending their money on, like development

07:16.600 --> 07:21.840
of Firefox itself, or maintaining Thunderbird, even, rather than...

07:21.840 --> 07:26.480
Because you think about the $40,000 that's going into this for the prize money, how many

07:26.480 --> 07:31.800
salaries are going into people working on the project and organizing it and everything?

07:31.800 --> 07:35.960
They must be spending a lot more than that public $40,000.

07:35.960 --> 07:40.200
But they are awash with cash, unless Yahoo wins.

07:40.200 --> 07:42.200
So they've got to spend it on something.

07:42.200 --> 07:47.080
And like you, I would rather they spend it on the core stuff, quite frankly.

07:47.080 --> 07:51.080
They wrap up their post saying that the Reality Redraw Challenge, which is the name of the

07:51.080 --> 07:55.640
challenge, is part of Mozilla's Information Trust Initiative, which was announced on August

07:55.640 --> 08:00.180
8th of this year to build a movement to fight misinformation online.

08:00.180 --> 08:07.160
And in that umbrella term, they also envision the fight against net neutrality and other

08:07.160 --> 08:08.320
web open standards.

08:08.320 --> 08:12.540
Apparently, not the DRM extension stuff, but other standards that they view as part of

08:12.540 --> 08:19.240
this trust initiative to combat, perhaps, corporate narratives or interest narratives

08:19.240 --> 08:21.440
online.

08:21.440 --> 08:26.120
This just in a one in zero world seems like a good idea.

08:26.120 --> 08:30.800
Where I personally have a little bit of issue with it is I just would like my tech companies

08:30.800 --> 08:36.640
to focus on making the best tech possible and let other companies focus on some of these

08:36.640 --> 08:37.640
politics.

08:37.640 --> 08:38.640
Not all of them.

08:38.640 --> 08:41.220
It's harder where you should draw the line.

08:41.220 --> 08:46.320
But for me, it does feel like Mozilla getting into some sort of campaign to fight misinformation

08:46.320 --> 08:48.720
online maybe crosses it.

08:48.720 --> 08:52.640
I think there are a lot of people who would disagree, but I can't say that I'm one of

08:52.640 --> 08:53.640
them.

08:53.640 --> 08:54.640
All right.

08:54.640 --> 08:59.400
Not strictly Linux, well, not Linux at all, but it is open source news.

08:59.400 --> 09:05.360
Classic Shell has been abandoned, but it's been abandoned in the correct way.

09:05.360 --> 09:07.040
It is now open source.

09:07.040 --> 09:11.760
So Classic Shell, of course, is software you can run on Windows to bring back a proper

09:11.760 --> 09:12.760
start menu.

09:12.760 --> 09:15.640
And none of this Windows 8 and 10 nonsense.

09:15.640 --> 09:18.480
And it's been very, very popular, this software.

09:18.480 --> 09:24.600
But the developer has said that he's had enough of trying to chase the changes that keep happening

09:24.600 --> 09:28.640
in Windows 10 a couple of times a year and that he's had enough.

09:28.640 --> 09:31.200
And so here you go, community, have it if you want it.

09:31.200 --> 09:35.560
Released under an MIT license, seems like a fair enough deal to me.

09:35.560 --> 09:38.680
And the thing I appreciate about this story is the developer is leaving the community

09:38.680 --> 09:43.760
forums active and running on his servers at his cost for a period of time to give people

09:43.760 --> 09:47.680
a place to temporarily organize to get this thing rolling again.

09:47.680 --> 09:52.920
The reason I put this in, okay, it's not Linux-y, it's not that interesting, but what's interesting

09:52.920 --> 09:55.640
is this is how to abandon software.

09:55.640 --> 10:01.040
And I would really like to see other proprietary software abandoned in this way so that it

10:01.040 --> 10:06.320
is available to the community rather than just dying and going away and being locked

10:06.320 --> 10:09.720
up as proprietary software that we can't do anything with.

10:09.720 --> 10:11.040
This is actually a pretty useful tool.

10:11.040 --> 10:12.140
And that's why I agree with you.

10:12.140 --> 10:15.840
It's great to see a useful tool that helps people work well with the machine.

10:15.840 --> 10:18.040
You learn a way to use a computer.

10:18.040 --> 10:19.920
You've been using it that way for 10, 15 years.

10:19.920 --> 10:24.960
We have a lot of people that listen to this show that are using Windows as their daily

10:24.960 --> 10:29.040
driver and they probably have their Windows box configured in a way that works really

10:29.040 --> 10:30.040
well for them.

10:30.040 --> 10:33.840
I recently tried out Windows 10 just for a few days as a quarter radio challenge about

10:33.840 --> 10:34.840
two weeks ago.

10:34.840 --> 10:36.040
You know, it's not bad.

10:36.040 --> 10:37.040
I was impressed.

10:37.040 --> 10:40.620
It did better than I expected, especially once you load the Windows subsystem, you put

10:40.620 --> 10:44.760
a different terminal emulator on there, and I could see how adding something like this

10:44.760 --> 10:47.060
would make people pretty productive.

10:47.060 --> 10:50.740
And it's really nice that once you get sort of in a groove to not just have something

10:50.740 --> 10:55.600
like this disappear, which is often the risk on these proprietary platforms.

10:55.600 --> 10:59.060
So having this go open source means that people that have a good workflow that can get their

10:59.060 --> 11:02.400
job done are going to have a tool now that maybe the community will continue.

11:02.400 --> 11:06.080
That's going to be the interesting thing because there's a few other tools that solve this

11:06.080 --> 11:07.080
particular problem.

11:07.080 --> 11:08.800
So I don't know how much demand there is.

11:08.800 --> 11:11.720
So we'll have to just kind of wait and see where the community takes this thing.

11:11.720 --> 11:16.040
Well, if I was forced to use Windows, I would want to use something like this and I would

11:16.040 --> 11:22.400
far rather it be free and open source software.

11:22.400 --> 11:24.680
Linux Academy dot com slash unplugged.

11:24.680 --> 11:28.000
You go there to sign up for the Linux Academy platform.

11:28.000 --> 11:32.360
It's a full featured training library with everything you need to learn new skills and

11:32.360 --> 11:33.560
advance your career.

11:33.560 --> 11:38.560
And you get a seven day free trial at Linux Academy dot com slash unplugged.

11:38.560 --> 11:42.980
My favorite feature of Linux Academy is the hands on lab scenario based labs that spin

11:42.980 --> 11:46.540
up when you need them to give you experience on real servers.

11:46.540 --> 11:52.100
The distribution in that VM matches the distribution you chose for your courseware.

11:52.100 --> 11:57.720
And if it's a virtual server on their infrastructure or an AWS lesson, they handle all of that

11:57.720 --> 12:00.000
with a really sophisticated back end.

12:00.000 --> 12:02.360
And you get real world experience with this.

12:02.360 --> 12:06.520
So when you go do something in production or you go take the test, you have that confidence

12:06.520 --> 12:07.780
because you've done it.

12:07.780 --> 12:11.800
And they have self paced in depth video courses on every Linux and cloud and DevOps topic.

12:11.800 --> 12:15.680
And if you get stuck, you need a little help, don't worry.

12:15.680 --> 12:20.040
They have full time human instructors that are happy to advise and answer questions that

12:20.040 --> 12:21.040
you might have.

12:21.040 --> 12:24.740
Course schedulers when you're busy, especially like around the holidays, if you got a couple

12:24.740 --> 12:29.940
of kids like I do and you run your own business, the course scheduler is invaluable and they

12:29.940 --> 12:30.940
work with you too.

12:30.940 --> 12:34.680
And there's flashcards to help you study that are forked by the community like it's an open

12:34.680 --> 12:35.680
source project.

12:35.680 --> 12:38.360
And the community is stacked full of Jupiter broadcasting members.

12:38.360 --> 12:41.260

12:48.800 --> 12:53.220
Okay, let's talk about Bitcoin again.

12:53.220 --> 12:58.040
We talked about it last week cracking the $10,000 barrier and it's been up nearly to

12:58.040 --> 13:00.820
20 and it's been back down to 1314.

13:00.820 --> 13:06.680
I think it's about 15 ish now as we record, but not interested in that particularly.

13:06.680 --> 13:11.760
I'm more interested in the U.K. and the EU planning to crack down on Bitcoin because

13:11.760 --> 13:16.080
people are using it to launder money and fund terrorism and things.

13:16.080 --> 13:17.080
Right.

13:17.080 --> 13:21.620
And we we all know that if you live in the West, you're only allowed to use cash around

13:21.620 --> 13:28.680
the world to fund terrorism and launder money and only tax loopholes in certain islands.

13:28.680 --> 13:33.280
But one of my lessons, Joe, and because when you look at the article, looks pretty bad.

13:33.280 --> 13:37.020
But one of my lessons that I've learned in Bitcoin over the years as I watch different

13:37.020 --> 13:42.640
governments go through this process is this is step one into legitimizing the Bitcoin

13:42.640 --> 13:46.720
market for here in the states, I would say Wall Street.

13:46.720 --> 13:49.040
So you have to have this in place.

13:49.040 --> 13:53.400
This happened while I was recording Plan B years ago.

13:53.400 --> 13:54.400
This happened here in the states.

13:54.400 --> 13:55.680
This began to happen.

13:55.680 --> 14:01.240
And it was a necessary step because today, as we record this episode, some big Wall Street

14:01.240 --> 14:04.400
banks are launching a futures market for Bitcoin.

14:04.400 --> 14:07.720
They couldn't have done that without this step.

14:07.720 --> 14:13.040
And the reality is there's plenty of other crypto out there for these particular use

14:13.040 --> 14:14.040
cases.

14:14.040 --> 14:15.120
You want to buy drugs.

14:15.120 --> 14:17.040
You want to fund a little terrorism.

14:17.040 --> 14:18.040
There's other cryptos.

14:18.040 --> 14:20.240
Bitcoin isn't the crypto for you already.

14:20.240 --> 14:21.240
It's already not.

14:21.240 --> 14:22.920
It's Bitcoin is not anonymous.

14:22.920 --> 14:24.060
It's not anonymous.

14:24.060 --> 14:30.360
So this is a legitimizing of the marketplace that then allows businesses to build predictability

14:30.360 --> 14:34.920
around Bitcoin in terms of how the government's going to react to them profiting it and how

14:34.920 --> 14:36.100
they're going to tax them.

14:36.100 --> 14:40.000
And once that predictability is in place, they start building products or offering services

14:40.000 --> 14:41.000
around it.

14:41.000 --> 14:44.540
It seems bad on the surface, but it typically leads to a marketplace.

14:44.540 --> 14:48.020
So you don't think that it's bad that the government wants to try and get in and tax

14:48.020 --> 14:52.160
it and regulate it and get their hands all over it?

14:52.160 --> 14:53.160
No, I don't think so.

14:53.160 --> 14:57.480
I think it makes it a practical commodities market now, in a sense.

14:57.480 --> 14:59.140
I'm not saying you should do it.

14:59.140 --> 15:01.080
I'm not saying people should invest in Bitcoin.

15:01.080 --> 15:05.720
But I'm saying people that are interested now have a legal framework to work within

15:05.720 --> 15:10.080
where they can have gains and losses and report it to the government.

15:10.080 --> 15:12.680
It sounds like you just want the price to keep getting driven up.

15:12.680 --> 15:16.600
So the few bitcoins you've got keep getting more valuable.

15:16.600 --> 15:17.600
I don't know about that.

15:17.600 --> 15:20.920
I've sort of I don't personally hold any Bitcoin anymore.

15:20.920 --> 15:22.920
JB has some, but not a lot.

15:22.920 --> 15:26.560
It's sort of at the point now where it's not going to make a huge difference for us either

15:26.560 --> 15:27.560
way.

15:27.560 --> 15:31.920
But I'm kind of fired up about the blockchain concept and adding more and more value to

15:31.920 --> 15:33.760
that to sort of validate that.

15:33.760 --> 15:39.160
And I'm really passionate about the concept of money being divorced from the state and

15:39.160 --> 15:43.620
having Internet money, essentially, even if it's just like a back end technology.

15:43.620 --> 15:45.440
It's an implementation detail.

15:45.440 --> 15:48.720
And the fact that it's open source and the fact that it's worth so much right now makes

15:48.720 --> 15:50.960
it extremely fascinating.

15:50.960 --> 15:54.940
And so I like to kind of I kind of like to watch these stories develop because I've seen

15:54.940 --> 15:56.240
a pattern now.

15:56.240 --> 16:00.620
We're hearing about it when it comes from the UK or it comes from the US.

16:00.620 --> 16:06.320
But the reality is that a lot of other countries have already gone down the same exact path

16:06.320 --> 16:07.800
and it's worked out for the better.

16:07.800 --> 16:08.800
All right.

16:08.800 --> 16:09.800
Fair enough.

16:09.800 --> 16:15.380
Well, let's talk about Android Go, which is a confusing name because of Google's programming

16:15.380 --> 16:16.520
language called Go.

16:16.520 --> 16:19.180
But OK, let's ignore that.

16:19.180 --> 16:24.560
And this is a version of Android for low end hardware, as in phones with a gigabyte of

16:24.560 --> 16:26.760
RAM and under.

16:26.760 --> 16:31.640
And they announced this back in May of this year, but now it's being released to the OEM

16:31.640 --> 16:34.360
so they can start making these devices.

16:34.360 --> 16:36.200
And to me, this is really exciting.

16:36.200 --> 16:42.480
I'd like to see a lot of this stuff rolled into custom ROMs and maybe if Lineage, for

16:42.480 --> 16:47.760
example, have the resources to make an open source version of it, I'd be very interested

16:47.760 --> 16:51.000
in running it because Android is big and bloated.

16:51.000 --> 16:56.560
And even on a flagship phone, albeit one from a couple of years ago, it's a little bit bloated.

16:56.560 --> 16:59.840
So I would like to see this slimmed down version running.

16:59.840 --> 17:05.160
And I just don't understand why Android main version can't run on a phone with under a

17:05.160 --> 17:06.420
gigabyte of RAM.

17:06.420 --> 17:07.680
That was my takeaway too.

17:07.680 --> 17:13.660
I saw this and I thought, if you could do all of this stuff for lower resources phones,

17:13.660 --> 17:17.800
why not do this for all the phones and the phones with more resources would just be even

17:17.800 --> 17:19.500
faster.

17:19.500 --> 17:20.640
It sort of boggles the mind.

17:20.640 --> 17:24.080
So I'll give you a couple examples, some concrete examples.

17:24.080 --> 17:28.320
They have a Google Go app, which, yes, this is Android Go.

17:28.320 --> 17:31.940
And then it has a Google Go app, which is a renamed version of their search app.

17:31.940 --> 17:35.080
It's like a light, smaller version.

17:35.080 --> 17:39.760
And one of the things it does is it transcodes or recompresses all of the third party web

17:39.760 --> 17:42.040
pages for faster loading.

17:42.040 --> 17:46.920
So then they have a version of YouTube called YouTube Go, kind of the same general thing.

17:46.920 --> 17:50.680
The YouTube app lets you download videos for offline viewing, even if you don't have a

17:50.680 --> 17:51.680
red subscription.

17:51.680 --> 17:52.920
Sounds pretty nice.

17:52.920 --> 17:55.160
And here's another nice thing it can do.

17:55.160 --> 17:59.680
It can share videos with nearby friends by transferring the actual YouTube video you

17:59.680 --> 18:01.080
downloaded over Wi-Fi.

18:01.080 --> 18:05.620
It creates an ad hoc network and transfers the video between YouTube apps when you have

18:05.620 --> 18:06.620
YouTube Go.

18:06.620 --> 18:08.560
Now, there are some limitations, like standard quality.

18:08.560 --> 18:12.500
It doesn't go above 360p, I believe.

18:12.500 --> 18:14.920
But boy, wouldn't I love that?

18:14.920 --> 18:21.480
Wouldn't I love that, if I could download my videos here at work on my fast 100 megabit

18:21.480 --> 18:26.940
Wi-Fi connection, then go home to my RV when I'm camping out in the boondocks and transfer

18:26.940 --> 18:30.740
all of them to my Android TV YouTube app and watch them right there offline, that would

18:30.740 --> 18:31.920
just be wonderful.

18:31.920 --> 18:34.540
But I'm too privileged, apparently.

18:34.540 --> 18:39.100
Then the other thing, just sort of from a quantifiable standpoint, the YouTube app on

18:39.100 --> 18:44.360
Android Go is 8.94 megabytes.

18:44.360 --> 18:47.640
The YouTube app for standard Android, 25 megabytes.

18:47.640 --> 18:51.920
Yeah, which means every time you have to update it, you have to pull down another 25 megabytes.

18:51.920 --> 18:52.920
Right.

18:52.920 --> 18:58.400
And the smaller Go apps are also using improved version of the Android runtime, a modification,

18:58.400 --> 19:03.480
apparently, they call it the Go edition of the Android runtime, which uses 50% less space

19:03.480 --> 19:07.120
than the Android 7 version comparison did.

19:07.120 --> 19:12.000
And Google says that the average app is now 15% faster on devices running Android Oreo

19:12.000 --> 19:13.440
Go edition.

19:13.440 --> 19:15.300
And space is always at a premium, isn't it?

19:15.300 --> 19:20.220
So that's more space for your apps and your downloads and your photos and videos and everything.

19:20.220 --> 19:22.700
It just sounds like a brilliant idea.

19:22.700 --> 19:27.960
And I really hope that I can get access to this somehow on my devices.

19:27.960 --> 19:32.400
I would be surprised if this didn't trickle down to standard Android as well.

19:32.400 --> 19:37.040
Why not have some of these gains and performance improvements and load time improvements on

19:37.040 --> 19:39.100
standard Android if you can?

19:39.100 --> 19:43.480
Perhaps this was the initiative that took Google to focus on this problem.

19:43.480 --> 19:47.960
And then they can turn back and upstream that to the standard Google apps as well.

19:47.960 --> 19:49.560
Yeah, hopefully.

19:49.560 --> 19:54.580
And MediaTek have announced that they've got some SystemHonored chips that are purpose

19:54.580 --> 19:57.320
designed to work with Android Go edition.

19:57.320 --> 20:01.560
Yeah, it's even more than that, though, Joe, because it's like pre-certified.

20:01.560 --> 20:04.600
It's essentially almost everything you need to build a phone.

20:04.600 --> 20:07.320
You add the screen, you add your own software.

20:07.320 --> 20:11.300
And they have three different iterations of SystemHonored chips, among others that they're

20:11.300 --> 20:17.100
working on, that have support out of the box and are already certified for Android Oreo

20:17.100 --> 20:22.000
Go edition, which means you cut weeks out of the certification process.

20:22.000 --> 20:26.320
Now, there's still more certification has to happen because OEMs add their own crap

20:26.320 --> 20:28.360
on top and then have to get it recertified.

20:28.360 --> 20:33.000
But the fact that the SystemHonored chip and the main boards are good to go cuts a ton

20:33.000 --> 20:34.160
of overhead out.

20:34.160 --> 20:36.720
And this is all about the next billion, isn't it?

20:36.720 --> 20:38.600
Yeah, it's about the next billion users.

20:38.600 --> 20:41.960
And MediaTek is the big name that's working with Google.

20:41.960 --> 20:46.560
MediaTek is kind of famous for making low-end cheap SystemHonored chips.

20:46.560 --> 20:50.320
But Google's been working closely with them to try to get something that's cheap enough

20:50.320 --> 20:55.860
and ready to go where a manufacturer can come along and produce really cheap Android devices.

20:55.860 --> 20:58.320
And yeah, get that next billion users.

20:58.320 --> 21:03.420
Well, it's looking good for the future of ARM devices, but it's not looking too good

21:03.420 --> 21:06.960
for the present of x86 Intel devices, is it?

21:06.960 --> 21:11.360
There's been a lot of talk recently about the Intel management engine, about different

21:11.360 --> 21:14.560
OEMs that are taking provisions to try to disable it.

21:14.560 --> 21:20.100
And now we have news about researchers that have discovered a flaw that not only could

21:20.100 --> 21:24.280
exist after the management engine has been disabled by these OEMs because it exists in

21:24.280 --> 21:30.060
a different layer, but could even potentially be exploited remotely depending on the particular

21:30.060 --> 21:31.060
type of attack.

21:31.060 --> 21:33.920
Yeah, this came out of Black Hat Europe this week.

21:33.920 --> 21:40.340
And the idea that if you've got physical access to the machine, you can overwrite the updated

21:40.340 --> 21:44.720
firmware with an older one and then exploit it, that's quite worrying.

21:44.720 --> 21:51.080
And the fact that there's potential for remote exploits happening here is very worrying for

21:51.080 --> 21:53.800
all of my machines that are running Intel processors.

21:53.800 --> 21:59.040
Yeah, and the duo that showed this off at Black Hat also showed off the ability to completely

21:59.040 --> 22:05.760
bypass what Intel calls the canary, which is a memory watcher that catches overflows

22:05.760 --> 22:09.800
via change detection and then says, oh, somebody's trying to screw with me.

22:09.800 --> 22:12.680
They've completely bypassed that detection technique.

22:12.680 --> 22:18.400
And that allows them to run executable code running return-oriented programming according

22:18.400 --> 22:19.400
to their presentation.

22:19.400 --> 22:24.160
It went a little over my head, but what I grok from this was with a couple of island

22:24.160 --> 22:25.940
hopping type exploits.

22:25.940 --> 22:30.260
They could eventually get remote control depending on the version of the management firmware

22:30.260 --> 22:34.960
and the exploits that are there, or if they could gain physical access and just reload

22:34.960 --> 22:38.360
the previous versions that were vulnerable, which there's no protection mechanism against.

22:38.360 --> 22:41.640
Yeah, and once they've got control of one machine, they can spread through the network

22:41.640 --> 22:42.640
to others.

22:42.640 --> 22:45.000
Now, I want to play devil's advocate for a moment.

22:45.000 --> 22:50.600
I hear my sysadmin brothers and sisters out in the audience that are saying, but guys,

22:50.600 --> 22:56.400
I have so many machines and the management engine does actually give me useful functionality

22:56.400 --> 23:03.140
that I care about, including some features that allow for remote system recovery, which

23:03.140 --> 23:09.720
can be a game changer, device inventory management, which can be really important and a huge time

23:09.720 --> 23:11.680
saver for IT departments.

23:11.680 --> 23:14.680
So it's not as if there's zero use for the management engine.

23:14.680 --> 23:18.740
But what I think we're discovering is perhaps something like this shouldn't be integrated

23:18.740 --> 23:20.800
so deeply into the system.

23:20.800 --> 23:26.260
Maybe it should be a PCI expansion card, or a USB dongle, or something that is added by

23:26.260 --> 23:28.740
the user that could even be open source.

23:28.740 --> 23:31.060
I'd love to see an open source solution here.

23:31.060 --> 23:35.560
And if the community knows of something like this, please let me know at chrislas.

23:35.560 --> 23:39.840
I would love to do a deep dive into that because it seems like with the management engine and

23:39.840 --> 23:45.080
AMD's PSP getting a lot of attention recently, we need the open source community to step

23:45.080 --> 23:46.080
up here.

23:46.080 --> 23:48.960
So maybe AMD could come and eat Intel's lunch.

23:48.960 --> 23:53.500
Yeah, and really take a market leader position and do this right, make it open source, engage

23:53.500 --> 23:57.120
the community and just run away with it potentially.

23:57.120 --> 23:59.000
This is the time to strike right now.

23:59.000 --> 24:03.200
Well, we've been watching this Intel story develop for the last few months and no doubt

24:03.200 --> 24:05.640
there's going to be further developments down the road.
