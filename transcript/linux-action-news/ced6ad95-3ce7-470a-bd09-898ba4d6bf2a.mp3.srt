00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,160
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, episode 222, recorded on January 5th, 2022.

2
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:10,160
I'm Chris.

3
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:11,160
And I'm Wes.

4
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:12,160
Hello, Wes.

5
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:15,600
The show is at its new time, but it is still the holidays.

6
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:19,640
So there's not a lot going on in the news, but we did pick a few stories we thought were

7
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:23,280
worth talking about, and one that, well, really makes me smile.

8
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:27,620
It seems the future of the GNU PG project is quite bright, and they don't really need

9
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:29,120
your donations anymore.

10
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:36,240
Yeah, GNU PG maintainer, Werner Koch, posted an update on the project and its new associated

11
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:43,360
GNU PG VS desktop line of business that is, yeah, as you put it, going quite well.

12
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:50,000
Writing, quote, for many years, our work was mainly financed by donations and smaller projects.

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,680
Now, we have reached a point where we can benefit from a continuous revenue stream to

14
00:00:54,680 --> 00:01:00,480
maintain and extend the software without asking for donations or grants.

15
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:04,640
This is quite a new experience for us, and I'm actually a bit proud to lead one of the

16
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:07,920
few self-sustaining free software projects.

17
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:12,040
Yeah, and then he closes with, so you don't need to donate.

18
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:15,720
If you had a recurring PayPal, it's been canceled.

19
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:19,760
And he says that they really have a sustainable project now.

20
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:26,280
And if you look at the history of this, it goes back to really contracts that came from

21
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:30,280
the German government to implement open source solutions when they were bouncing back and

22
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:37,240
forth between Linux and Windows, and they needed to bring their GPG system with them.

23
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:42,820
And it's developed now into a full-fledged business that is supporting this critical

24
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:44,840
open source project.

25
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:47,240
And it's so rare that this happens these days.

26
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:50,200
It just feels like that after log4j.

27
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:56,080
It's nice to see years and years of hard work making software that the public can use at

28
00:01:56,080 --> 00:02:00,800
large, actually paying off and being recognized that not only is it just suitable for general

29
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:05,560
encryption needs, it can also, maybe with just a little investment, be up to snuff for

30
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:07,960
government security as well.

31
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:15,120
You know what does strike me about it though, Wes, is what's making money isn't the core

32
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,920
GNU PG, right?

33
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:21,160
It's part of what's making them money, but it's this product that they've built on top

34
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:26,840
of it, really for the Windows platform, that is bringing in enough revenue that it can

35
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:31,600
fund development of the core technology that we all use in the open source community.

36
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:32,920
I just find that kind of ironic.

37
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:38,000
Yeah, I think it's an example of open source developers really having to be a little bit

38
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:43,380
clever and go above and beyond to make things work out financially, where you can actually

39
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:49,000
get a whole bunch of revenue and what exactly the best path for the pure open source project,

40
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:53,760
those aren't always 100% aligned.

41
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:58,560
Something I've noticed for years now, maybe way too long, is that right around the new

42
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:05,220
years, speculation about Fuchsia OS always starts percolating.

43
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:06,800
It's coming for Linux, you know.

44
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:09,320
Yeah, well, is this the year, right?

45
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:10,320
That's always the question.

46
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:11,400
It could be.

47
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:13,080
It could be.

48
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:17,280
And I think for those of you that are curious, you're not familiar with it, we have talked

49
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:22,360
about it on the show before, but Fuchsia is a Google project and it's designed to be entirely

50
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:28,040
modular that really just means you can touch and adjust the system or change libraries

51
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:32,680
and applications, remove things entirely, and it doesn't affect the core system.

52
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:36,560
And then it uses a lot of modern technologies that a lot of developers are excited about,

53
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:41,900
besides just C and C++, of course, but things like Rust, Go, and Dart are in there.

54
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:46,720
And then the native front-end applications for the user environment, well, that's all

55
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:50,760
Dart and Flutter, which has a bunch of excitement around it.

56
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:54,720
And last but not least, there's the kernel, Zircon.

57
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:59,560
Yeah, this isn't Linux here, it's its own kernel, something of a microkernel with a

58
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:04,280
lot of stuff left to be implemented in user space.

59
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:07,520
Now we all know there can be a lot of advantages to that, it doesn't happen with our beloved

60
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:13,880
Linux kernel, but the folks over at Fuchsia are trying to make that work in a modern set

61
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:19,440
of tools and operating systems and systems for security reasons, for maintainability

62
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:20,440
reasons.

63
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:24,200
I mean, I think that's what's kind of interesting about watching Fuchsia happen is it's just

64
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:29,400
taking some ideas that aren't as mainstream right now and playing with them.

65
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:34,840
And it's no longer just a test ground either, it's in production.

66
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:39,800
In fact, Google just announced another IoT-type device is switching over to Fuchsia.

67
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:44,360
See, they don't necessarily seem to be going after Android devices right now, but things

68
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:49,260
like the Nest Hub and devices like that, they're swapping over to Fuchsia just right out from

69
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:50,640
underneath the user.

70
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:55,080
You can tell if you dig around deep enough, but you really have to know what you're looking

71
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:56,080
for.

72
00:04:56,080 --> 00:05:01,020
And I don't know really if Android or Linux have to worry today, because I think initially,

73
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:06,900
if I were to guess, Fuchsia will be the OS for people who don't want Linux.

74
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:11,840
I know it's shocking to hear it, but there's actually a customer out there looking for

75
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:13,240
a solution, not Linux.

76
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:18,200
For whatever obviously incorrect reason, that is actually a customer base.

77
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:23,460
And I think those people will be the first in line for something like Fuchsia.

78
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:26,160
And hey, you know, it is open source.

79
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:30,140
The question will be what kind of open source, how friendly will it be to non-Google use

80
00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:34,720
cases and where will it go from here, but right now, I just don't know.

81
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:39,960
Oh, and we have a link in the show notes to a Fuchsia emulator, a portable Fuchsia emulator.

82
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:44,440
If you want to play around with it, link in the notes.

83
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:50,560
Well, speaking of Google operating systems, if you've ever used one of those x86 Android

84
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:55,720
tablets, you'll know the experience isn't always great.

85
00:05:55,720 --> 00:06:00,200
But there's some interesting forthcoming work in the Linux kernel that might make things

86
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:01,200
a little bit better.

87
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:07,360
Yeah, it seems this is going to land in Linux 5.17, and it's a driver that aims to fix up

88
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,360
a lot of these limitations.

89
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:12,160
This is something that Michael Larble has been watching closely, and he has a write

90
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:14,440
up a link to in the show notes.

91
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:21,040
The gist of it is, these x86 based Android tablets, YaoMei makes some of these, Asus

92
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:25,520
made some of these, they have some quirky ACPI issues.

93
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:26,900
And amongst other things.

94
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:30,840
And so this driver is looking to cover as many of those quirks or mistakes, whatever

95
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:36,520
you want to call it as possible, to allow these aging tablets to work fine with a mainline

96
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:37,520
Linux build.

97
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:43,280
And one of the examples they have here is the Asus Memo Pad 7, which is pretty old.

98
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:47,480
It originally shipped eight years ago with Android 4.4.

99
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:51,960
But now after this patch, should be in a lot better shape for mainline Linux.

100
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:53,560
Yeah, this is nice to see.

101
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:58,280
I mean, it's nice to see mainline Linux getting, you know, better Android device support in

102
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:02,280
general for a variety of reasons, not least of which is, hey, maybe eventually these Android

103
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:05,320
devices will stop using such gross custom kernels.

104
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:09,280
But this is also great for owners of these devices that might still have some uses for

105
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:14,880
them long after the manufacturer has stopped caring about them.

106
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:20,160
The GNOME Projects Libitwaita, the much talked about Libitwaita has hit 1.0.

107
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:24,400
This is a library for implementing the GNOME Human Interface Guidelines, and it's going

108
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:27,400
to play a big role in GTK4.

109
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:33,440
Yeah, in GTK4, Libitwaita is basically the successor to the role that Lib Handy played

110
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:34,440
in GTK3.

111
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:40,160
Now, you should note, though, some of these changes are not fully compatible with the

112
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,120
GTK default.

113
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:47,000
So there will be some changes you might have to make to an application while you're porting.

114
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:51,640
It's pretty aggressive, but there's some nice things that you gain here.

115
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:57,120
They have some great examples on the GNOME blog, which we will link, especially around

116
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,920
those of us who like to use dark variants.

117
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:02,640
Now there's essentially a standard way for this to be implemented.

118
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:07,880
Before the dark mode that was in GNOME wasn't really meant to be used at the level it has

119
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:08,880
been.

120
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:13,400
It was more for specific applications that needed a dark environment, like a movie player

121
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:15,840
that maybe has a theater mode.

122
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:20,980
That kind of basic functionality is what all the theme makers built on to create a dark

123
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:22,320
mode for GNOME.

124
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:28,500
But now, this dark variant that they have is built into Libitwaita, and that means that

125
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:30,480
things look really good.

126
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:33,940
And you'll have to see the screenshots in the show notes to see what we're talking about.

127
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:38,280
But I would say it turns out on the typical GNOME desktop, there's probably four, five,

128
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:43,240
six little edge cases that we've all just kind of gotten used to, but really shouldn't

129
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:44,520
be that way.

130
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:49,760
And historically, changing these things has been a really big lift, just the way that

131
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:52,040
GTK did this.

132
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:59,720
And so now, Libitwaita is splitting all of that out into smaller manageable files.

133
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:05,680
So we may actually see it leads to more artistic license on the GNOME desktop down the road.

134
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:06,680
We might.

135
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:08,720
Yeah, you know, that really speaks to my inner developer.

136
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:14,080
Sure, it may not be exciting outside, but when you have a big maintainability increase,

137
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,720
I think you're exactly right, Chris.

138
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:18,600
That just means it's easier to work on the project.

139
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:21,800
That means you can get bugs done without having to pull your hair out.

140
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:23,680
That's just good for everyone.

141
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:24,680
Yeah.

142
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:25,680
Yeah.

143
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:32,480
And it's nice to see now like an official supported API that's cross-desktop for Darkstyle,

144
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:39,080
which means that should now eventually work across GNOME and elementary, or GNOME and

145
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:42,480
MATE, or GNOME and Plasma.

146
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:43,480
That's great.

147
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:48,560
There will be some adjustments to make room for that, but long term, it's better to have

148
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:51,400
these things as a supported API.

149
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:56,480
There also are some regressions, at least compared to Lib Handy, there are some regressions

150
00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:00,440
that mean that some swipe gestures will no longer work with the mouse.

151
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:04,840
You have to actually use a touchscreen, and that's just going to require an update down

152
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:07,320
the road to fix that kind of stuff.

153
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:10,340
And I imagine as time goes on, we'll hear of a few other edge cases that come up where

154
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:11,400
things don't work.

155
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:16,720
But it truly is a 1.0, and I think it's a little unfortunate that the conversation around

156
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:22,640
this started as no more theming on GNOME, because that's not really what's going on

157
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:24,000
here at all.

158
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,400
And it gives us some new base functionality that everybody gains.

159
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:30,600
Yeah, it certainly seems like a necessary step to move forward.

160
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:32,680
Sure, there's still a lot of work to do.

161
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:35,240
There's still a lot of stuff that we'd like to see changed in GNOME, at least many of

162
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:36,240
us.

163
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:40,000
But yeah, congrats to the team.

164
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,560
Linode.com slash LAN.

165
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:45,840
Go there to get $100 in 60-day credit on a new account, and you go there to support the

166
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:46,840
show.

167
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:48,740
Linode is fast, reliable.

168
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:51,520
It's the Linux geeks cloud.

169
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:52,920
Go try it for your next project.

170
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:56,160
It's what I use when I'm just testing things out.

171
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:59,000
I have been experimenting with a new server.

172
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Photo prism.

173
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,520
I don't know if you're familiar with this, but you can privately host and organize and

174
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:08,760
share your photos, and it also can do the kind of Google photo style image recognition.

175
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:13,440
I wanted to throw a lot of bandwidth and a lot of processor at this, and I wanted a lot

176
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:14,440
of disk IOs.

177
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:16,640
So that way I could just test it and just figure this out, because I only had about

178
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:18,920
a half hour to spend on it.

179
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:24,280
And Linode has recently been rolling out MVME PCIe storage, and that's just a game changer

180
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:27,520
for applications like this where I'm analyzing the photos.

181
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:30,240
It makes such a difference, and they can help you sort that stuff out too.

182
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:36,200
They have fantastic support, the best in the business, 24-7, fantastic customer support.

183
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:40,980
I mean, you know the kind of performance that MVME drives can offer.

184
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:45,640
And then on their high-end CPU systems, they have AMD EPYC processors.

185
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:49,840
So if you're a performance hound or your application needs a lot of storage throughput, Linode

186
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:52,840
can really help you get something dialed in.

187
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:57,440
And they're 30 to 50% less than the hyperscalers they're going to try to lock you in.

188
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:00,560
And they have 11 data centers around the world, so you can go try it out yourself.

189
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:04,760
They've been doing it for 18 years, and that $100 really lets you kick the tires.

190
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:08,920
Go try it out and see for yourself, linode.com slash LAN.

191
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:14,000
That's linode.com slash LAN.

192
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,520
And a big thank you to Ting, linux.ting.com.

193
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:22,560
If you're sick of overpaying for cell service, go see how much you could save and take $25

194
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:25,040
off at linux.ting.com.

195
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:27,720
They're an MVNO or a mobile virtual network operator.

196
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:33,320
That means Ting gets access to the big nationwide carrier networks, but with way better customer

197
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:36,880
service and at a lower cost for you.

198
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:42,260
And Ting Mobile has the nationwide coverage you're looking for, LTE and 5G networks.

199
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:48,920
And Ting was recently named the number one carrier by Consumer Reports in 2021.

200
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:50,600
How about that?

201
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:51,600
I already knew.

202
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:56,760
I've been a customer since 2013, but it's nice to see Consumer Reports catching on.

203
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:58,800
It's just a smarter way to do mobile.

204
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:01,640
They have plans to start at $10 and go up from there.

205
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:04,320
You can get the plan that has just the right amount of data.

206
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:08,340
They have plans with unlimited calls and texts for $35 a month.

207
00:13:08,340 --> 00:13:11,600
And every plan gets Ting's award-winning customer service.

208
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:15,560
They'll always make sure that you're taken care of and you have the freedom of no contracts

209
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:16,560
ever.

210
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:17,560
It's simple to switch to Ting.

211
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:21,080
So just go to linux.ting.com, put in your information, get started.

212
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:22,580
See if your phone's compatible at least.

213
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:25,080
See what might be available in your area.

214
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:27,560
Then create an account, order a SIM.

215
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:30,120
You're gonna pop that in your phone once you receive that in a couple of days and you're

216
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:31,120
gonna be off to the races.

217
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:34,040
It only takes you a few seconds to get activated via the Ting website.

218
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:37,560
It's simple to start saving money every single month.

219
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:40,120
Why not get started at the beginning of the year?

220
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:48,160
And then at the end of the year, you can look back and see how much money you saved, linux.ting.com.

221
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:54,080
There's been a lot happening over at the Matrix Project over 2021 and seemingly a lot planned

222
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:55,080
for 2022.

223
00:13:55,080 --> 00:14:00,840
And since it's been a little while since we checked in over there and they recently published,

224
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:05,480
a huge breakdown of a lot of those goings on, well, we thought we'd take a look and

225
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:08,500
highlight some of the stuff that stood out to us.

226
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:13,480
And we have to start with some of the big breakthroughs they made in stabilizing memory

227
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:17,280
usage in the Synapse home server.

228
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:22,760
Now that's the home server powering Jupiter Broadcasting's Matrix server and a ton of

229
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:24,640
production home servers out there.

230
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:31,320
And well, it's safe to say that until now, it kind of ate as much RAM as it could find.

231
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:38,360
But even the behemothmatrix.org Synapse server now apparently only uses two to three gigs

232
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:45,640
of RAM, despite having more than doubled up to 1.1 million active users over the course

233
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:47,520
of the last year.

234
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:49,360
That's nice to see, isn't it?

235
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:53,120
That is an area we've been chasing since we launched our Matrix server.

236
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:57,040
I mean, I know they have other things in the works which we will get to, but it's good

237
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:59,000
to see Synapse still getting love.

238
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,780
Yeah, it really is.

239
00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:04,960
Another big feature that caught my eye was the addition of threads.

240
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:10,900
Now okay, they're not actually quite out there in the lab right now, but that classic threaded

241
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:13,680
model is finally coming to Matrix.

242
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:16,760
And you know, because it's Matrix, this wasn't just a hack it in thing.

243
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:20,800
Now there's been a lot of changes and conversations and debates and discussions about how to get

244
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:25,480
this right and how to make it work well in the system that is the Matrix we have today.

245
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:29,880
Yeah, you can't just have any old API, you got to have one that all the different clients

246
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:31,440
can implement.

247
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:35,200
So beyond just the software, though, there's been a lot of high profile open source projects

248
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:38,640
that adopted Matrix all over the place throughout the year.

249
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:45,240
Just to name a few, Debian, Fedora, NixOS, Arch, Tor, Ansible, and many others.

250
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:48,840
There's been online events that have been hosted on Matrix with hundreds of thousands

251
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:50,060
of attendees.

252
00:15:50,060 --> 00:15:55,120
And Element has really continued to act as the flagship client and really a spot for

253
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:58,560
example development and official SDKs.

254
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:03,360
Like I'm sure one of the very first places this new thread support will land is going

255
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,580
to be an element.

256
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:07,520
And that continues to set a pace there.

257
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:12,280
There's just been also a ton of work this last year that went into making VoIP calls

258
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:17,240
really solid, the person-to-person VoIP calls to make it maybe even your go-to solution

259
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:19,240
for remote workers.

260
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:24,680
And if you do switch over to Element for remote work, well, you'll be glad to know that 2021

261
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:30,240
saw the long-awaited creation of a dedicated cryptography team that's just focusing on

262
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:32,800
improving encryption within Matrix.

263
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:36,440
Now of course Matrix has pretty much always prioritized encryption, but it's something

264
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:41,420
that needs constant attention, so it's nice to finally see that happening so explicitly.

265
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:47,000
As for 2022, well, the project definitely has some ambitious goals, including to further

266
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:55,720
advance their new Matrix Rust SDK and possibly get that in use in some of their mobile clients.

267
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:59,600
They're also hoping to improve Dendrite, which is a second-generation home server written

268
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:05,220
in Go, and if things go well, could eventually take over as something of the default home

269
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:08,120
server rather than Synapse.

270
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:12,920
I don't know why, Wes, but something tells me we're probably going to make the switch

271
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:13,920
when that happens.

272
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:17,920
I mean, after all, we got to review it for show content at some point in the future.

273
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:23,320
But I really am really impressed with the rate and pace of development, and our Matrix

274
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:26,140
community has been growing at a rapid pace too.
