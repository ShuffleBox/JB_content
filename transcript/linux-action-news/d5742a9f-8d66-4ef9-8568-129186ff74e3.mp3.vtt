00:00.000 --> 00:05.640
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News.

00:05.640 --> 00:09.520
Episode 232, recorded on March 16th, 2022.

00:09.520 --> 00:10.520
I'm Chris.

00:10.520 --> 00:11.520
And I'm Wes.

00:11.520 --> 00:12.520
Hello, Wes.

00:12.520 --> 00:14.740
Let's do the news.

00:14.740 --> 00:19.440
This week, Arch Linux turned 20 years old.

00:19.440 --> 00:24.200
And we thought we should start the show out this week by wishing Arch, the project, and

00:24.200 --> 00:27.400
the many people behind it, a happy birthday.

00:27.400 --> 00:32.480
No, it's not quite old enough to drink, but you really shouldn't use Pac-Man under the

00:32.480 --> 00:34.520
influence anyway.

00:34.520 --> 00:40.480
Arch has seen distros come and go, the rise of SystemD, the introduction of Wayland, and

00:40.480 --> 00:47.880
PulseAudio for that matter, but it was first released way back on March 11th, 2002, a simpler

00:47.880 --> 00:55.560
time for the Linux desktop, and Arch 0.1 had a nice simple codename at that, Homer.

00:55.560 --> 01:01.400
Since then, they've managed to mostly keep things simple while also building out an incredible

01:01.400 --> 01:08.440
user repository, a wiki that I still use even when I'm not using an Arch system, and an

01:08.440 --> 01:11.580
amazing amount of community goodwill.

01:11.580 --> 01:15.640
That's why, even though I get pretty excited about Fedora these days and still have some

01:15.640 --> 01:21.480
Ubuntu machines laying around, of course, Arch, I think, will always remain one of my

01:21.480 --> 01:23.640
go-to distros.

01:23.640 --> 01:27.680
And I know you've had a few mean Arch desktops over the years, Chris.

01:27.680 --> 01:30.160
Are you actually still using it, though?

01:30.160 --> 01:31.160
I have.

01:31.160 --> 01:32.160
I do.

01:32.160 --> 01:36.760
I have, well, we have two boxes in the studio, a desktop machine of mine that's just been

01:36.760 --> 01:39.800
a rock since like 2017.

01:39.800 --> 01:46.080
I have just slowly upgraded Arch on that thing, and it's been totally great.

01:46.080 --> 01:51.400
And then we have it on an old server here that it's still in transition, and it's running

01:51.400 --> 01:54.200
on there in a server capacity.

01:54.200 --> 01:55.600
Also quite stable.

01:55.600 --> 02:01.080
We started it as, honestly, a year ago as a lark because the live audience was giving

02:01.080 --> 02:03.520
me the hardest time for not trying out Arch Linux.

02:03.520 --> 02:05.880
This is probably a decade ago.

02:05.880 --> 02:07.480
And I was like, all right, fine.

02:07.480 --> 02:11.280
You know, being a smart arch kid that I was, I was like, fine, I'll try a chat room.

02:11.280 --> 02:14.200
I'll see what your Arch user repository is all about.

02:14.200 --> 02:16.640
And I did a week-long challenge.

02:16.640 --> 02:19.520
And we still have people that write into the show that say, hey, I started listening during

02:19.520 --> 02:20.940
the Arch challenge.

02:20.940 --> 02:26.200
And I did a total deep dive into Arch and came away extremely impressed.

02:26.200 --> 02:30.160
I went from a skeptic to a true Arch believer.

02:30.160 --> 02:33.840
I try not to tell you about it all the time, by the way, but sometimes I just can't help

02:33.840 --> 02:34.840
myself.

02:34.840 --> 02:35.840
And I still love it.

02:35.840 --> 02:40.120
It might not be like my go-to distro for like a laptop these days.

02:40.120 --> 02:42.320
That tends to be Fedora.

02:42.320 --> 02:47.840
But for custom-built systems, maybe rigs that are going to have a really specific purpose,

02:47.840 --> 02:54.440
or when I'm trying out cutting-edge hardware, I always still turn to Arch.

02:54.440 --> 03:01.120
And I think part of that is because Arch hasn't changed much for the last 20 years.

03:01.120 --> 03:04.160
I mean, it's changed technologically.

03:04.160 --> 03:07.820
And it's changed with the Linux community in that way.

03:07.820 --> 03:12.840
But I thought this is interesting in that first release there, that Homer release, the

03:12.840 --> 03:14.640
0.1 release, really.

03:14.640 --> 03:17.160
Arch was described as this.

03:17.160 --> 03:22.880
Arch Linux is an i6-86 optimized Linux distribution based on ideas from Crux.

03:22.880 --> 03:28.120
And then it goes on to say in the post, a default Arch install leaves you with a solid

03:28.120 --> 03:29.120
base.

03:29.120 --> 03:34.100
From there, you can add packages to create the custom installation you're looking for.

03:34.100 --> 03:40.360
That 20 years later is still perfectly, it just perfectly describes Arch still.

03:40.360 --> 03:44.120
And you've got to give the project credit for that.

03:44.120 --> 03:46.320
That's a hard thing to really stick to over 20 years.

03:46.320 --> 03:52.300
And by just nailing that basic promise, a lot of people have come to love the distribution.

03:52.300 --> 03:57.100
So happy birthday, everybody.

03:57.100 --> 04:04.240
After what has felt like years of rumors, on March 15th, Google announced that Steam

04:04.240 --> 04:11.120
for Chrome OS is finally here, or, well, almost here.

04:11.120 --> 04:12.120
It's a little confusing.

04:12.120 --> 04:13.400
It is.

04:13.400 --> 04:17.240
It seems maybe the right hand doesn't know what the left hand is doing in this case at

04:17.240 --> 04:18.240
Google.

04:18.240 --> 04:20.820
So we dug into this just a little bit for the show.

04:20.820 --> 04:26.880
And I'm thinking they were planning to have everything lined up for this Google Game Developer

04:26.880 --> 04:27.880
Summit.

04:27.880 --> 04:33.000
And then the announcement and the slides and all that stuff kept going forward and the

04:33.000 --> 04:35.720
bits that Chrome OS needed didn't.

04:35.720 --> 04:41.400
So a Google PR person confirmed that the Steam for Chrome OS stuff isn't actually available

04:41.400 --> 04:46.000
right now, like they said it was, but it should be in the near future.

04:46.000 --> 04:47.500
OK, fair enough.

04:47.500 --> 04:49.280
That stuff can take time.

04:49.280 --> 04:54.200
And to no real surprise, they are initially targeting the higher end Chromebooks.

04:54.200 --> 04:57.400
OK, also, fair enough.

04:57.400 --> 04:58.860
Not a surprise at all, really.

04:58.860 --> 05:04.960
But you're going to need something in there like a decent Intel or AMD x86 64 CPU, not

05:04.960 --> 05:06.000
an ARM CPU.

05:06.000 --> 05:08.040
Those will not get support for this.

05:08.040 --> 05:11.920
Unfortunately, you're also probably going to have something that has somewhat of a graphics

05:11.920 --> 05:12.920
card on there.

05:12.920 --> 05:15.800
They have a list that we'll have linked in the show notes.

05:15.800 --> 05:21.680
Steam on Chrome OS is also leveraging, like you probably expected, those Linux application

05:21.680 --> 05:24.760
containers that Google built a little while ago.

05:24.760 --> 05:29.040
That means that Valve gets to use a lot of the stuff, well, pretty much everything they've

05:29.040 --> 05:30.440
already built for Steam on Linux.

05:30.440 --> 05:35.080
They don't have to like make a Chrome OS specific version.

05:35.080 --> 05:39.000
And actually, speaking of Steam, Valve has sent the developer of Lutris a Steam Deck

05:39.000 --> 05:42.040
to help with development of Lutris.

05:42.040 --> 05:46.040
I mean, I just think that's pretty notable here because Lutris could be a tool that lets

05:46.040 --> 05:48.720
you bypass the Steam ecosystem if you chose to.

05:48.720 --> 05:53.820
You can participate with it as well, but it is essentially a competing tool that lets

05:53.820 --> 05:56.840
you use multiple different game stores.

05:56.840 --> 06:02.980
Yeah, I guess the hope here is that having an actual Steam Deck in hand should help further

06:02.980 --> 06:07.720
development on the Flatpak, as well as maybe hooking up anything special that's needed

06:07.720 --> 06:11.160
to get Lutris to work specifically on the Steam Deck.

06:11.160 --> 06:16.120
But yeah, I mean, as you say, like Lutris is not limited to the Steam ecosystem.

06:16.120 --> 06:20.040
Yes, it does work in the Steam ecosystem, but it works with a whole lot of other things

06:20.040 --> 06:21.200
too.

06:21.200 --> 06:26.640
So good on Valve for kind of continuing to keep up this commitment of the Deck is just

06:26.640 --> 06:27.640
a Linux device.

06:27.640 --> 06:30.640
Yeah, they keep saying it's a PC.

06:30.640 --> 06:34.640
If that doesn't underscore that philosophy, I don't know what else does.

06:34.640 --> 06:37.440
And then just last bit of news on Steam.

06:37.440 --> 06:42.800
The Steam survey results for February 2022 have been clackalated and we just have a couple

06:42.800 --> 06:43.800
of notes.

06:43.800 --> 06:49.320
Just a reminder, though, that this is kind of a notoriously unreliable metric because

06:49.320 --> 06:56.000
the total Steam user base is always growing amongst all other kinds of things.

06:56.000 --> 06:59.520
But here's the figures you're probably interested in.

06:59.520 --> 07:07.240
In February of this year, Linux had a Steam market share of 1.02%.

07:07.240 --> 07:13.120
Unfortunately that's down a little bit from 1.06% back in January.

07:13.120 --> 07:17.600
But taking a longer term view, things look pretty healthy year over year.

07:17.600 --> 07:26.360
Way back in February last year, if you can remember that, Steam on Linux sat at 0.81%.

07:26.360 --> 07:30.480
Although again, as you noted there, Chris, Steam's overall market share has definitely

07:30.480 --> 07:33.400
continued to increase significantly in that time.

07:33.400 --> 07:37.120
So it's a little difficult to make complete sense of these numbers.

07:37.120 --> 07:42.040
Yeah, I think we mostly just wanted to note it today because won't that number be pretty

07:42.040 --> 07:44.360
interesting in about a year from now?

07:44.360 --> 07:50.160
Not only has the Deck been sent out to people who pre-ordered it, but likely in a year from

07:50.160 --> 07:55.880
now, hopefully, sales channels are loaded up, people have easy access to a Deck.

07:55.880 --> 07:57.880
The number here could be pretty different.

07:57.880 --> 08:02.440
That may also have the halo effect, as Apple used to call it, where perhaps people see

08:02.440 --> 08:06.740
the Deck and decide, well, if I've got a Deck now, maybe I also will try Linux on this machine

08:06.740 --> 08:07.840
and install Steam.

08:07.840 --> 08:10.640
We may see this number go up, perhaps in a year.

08:10.640 --> 08:15.600
The thing we don't know at this point is, how's Valve going to calculate those Deck

08:15.600 --> 08:16.600
numbers?

08:16.600 --> 08:19.040
Are they going to lump it in with the general Linux scene, are they going to break it out

08:19.040 --> 08:22.720
as a distro, or is it going to be its own category altogether?

08:22.720 --> 08:27.440
We just don't have that answer yet.

08:27.440 --> 08:33.100
Michael Larable over at Feromics caught wind of a new Linux driver testing framework this

08:33.100 --> 08:37.220
week called RoadTest.

08:37.220 --> 08:42.360
What immediately stood out to us about RoadTest is it enables drivers to be tested under

08:42.360 --> 08:48.440
user mode Linux, and makes it super simple to use mocked or modeled hardware.

08:48.440 --> 08:51.880
Yeah, modeled hardware, isn't that interesting?

08:51.880 --> 08:55.800
But here's the problem they say they're trying to solve, quote, most of the hardware is not

08:55.800 --> 09:01.800
available in current CI systems, so most drivers can only, at best, be build tested there.

09:01.800 --> 09:06.700
Even basic soundness, such as drivers successfully probing and binding to the devices it tries

09:06.700 --> 09:09.480
to support, cannot be tested.

09:09.480 --> 09:14.060
Drivers cannot be easily regression tested to ensure that bug-fixed code does not get

09:14.060 --> 09:16.260
reintroduced again.

09:16.260 --> 09:20.080
I think the key thing in there that they're talking about here is, testers can use this

09:20.080 --> 09:25.760
modeled hardware to at least build some basic test coverage.

09:25.760 --> 09:29.960
And when you have a setup, which a lot of these hardware vendors do now, when you have

09:29.960 --> 09:33.840
a setup where you're building with a continuous integration system, anything more you can

09:33.840 --> 09:37.320
do there is going to be great, even if it's just some really basic stuff, because I think

09:37.320 --> 09:39.440
it's not particularly robust, Wes.

09:39.440 --> 09:40.920
I think it's kind of basic.

09:40.920 --> 09:45.040
Yeah, it's definitely focused on just simple tests.

09:45.040 --> 09:49.200
Actually the tests and hardware models themselves are written in Python, taking advantage of

09:49.200 --> 09:51.960
Python's built-in unit test framework.

09:51.960 --> 09:55.880
So no, this isn't going to give you the full set of capabilities that real hardware has,

09:55.880 --> 10:00.080
and of course testing on real hardware is still important, but that's really difficult

10:00.080 --> 10:04.000
in CI systems, just given the huge nature of different types of hardware and parameters

10:04.000 --> 10:07.160
and configurations that hardware can be in.

10:07.160 --> 10:12.640
All of that makes development, modification, maintenance work, reviewing patches to these

10:12.640 --> 10:16.640
drivers, all of that is way harder than it actually needs to be.

10:16.640 --> 10:25.600
So RoadTest hopes to make some of those things just a little bit easier.

10:25.600 --> 10:27.120
Linode.com slash LAN.

10:27.120 --> 10:32.040
Go there to get $100 in 60-day credit on a new account, and you go there to support the

10:32.040 --> 10:33.040
show.

10:33.040 --> 10:36.120
You know everything we've deployed in the last, like, what, two and a half years?

10:36.120 --> 10:37.440
That's been on Linode.

10:37.440 --> 10:41.880
It's the Linux Geeks Cloud with 11 data centers around the world, and they've been hard at

10:41.880 --> 10:46.340
work for almost 19 years, creating the best experience for running your applications up

10:46.340 --> 10:47.340
there on the cloud.

10:47.340 --> 10:50.560
And you know, they're rolling out this new database as a service, and they've done it

10:50.560 --> 10:51.560
right.

10:51.560 --> 10:52.560
It's a MySQL project.

10:52.560 --> 10:57.000
They worked with the project there, and they have focused on getting it just right.

10:57.000 --> 10:58.280
They're gonna expand upon it.

10:58.280 --> 11:01.240
I actually haven't had a chance to try it yet, though.

11:01.240 --> 11:04.680
It's in beta right now, but I know Linode is gonna nail it.

11:04.680 --> 11:07.680
You're gonna have the expertise and the pros that know how to make Linode tick.

11:07.680 --> 11:09.240
They're gonna be behind that, right?

11:09.240 --> 11:13.240
They're gonna have that fast infrastructure, and of course, the great uptime.

11:13.240 --> 11:16.960
So I'm planning to try it, but if you get a chance to try it, let me know what you think.

11:16.960 --> 11:20.600
In fact, go sign up and try it out yourself and send me the feedback.

11:20.600 --> 11:22.320
I'll incorporate it in a future read.

11:22.320 --> 11:23.540
Linode.com slash LAN.

11:23.540 --> 11:25.720
Go get that $100 to try it.

11:25.720 --> 11:29.840
Linode has been rolling out screaming fast MVME-based block storage recently.

11:29.840 --> 11:34.160
We use their super flexible S3-compatible object storage to power things like our Next

11:34.160 --> 11:38.980
Cloud or the backend storage for services that are always growing.

11:38.980 --> 11:43.760
If you want to deploy a matrix server like we have, Linode is great for that as well.

11:43.760 --> 11:47.240
Maybe you just want to use Linode for a few minutes to try something out, or maybe you

11:47.240 --> 11:51.000
want to run your business infrastructure on there for the next 10 years.

11:51.000 --> 11:54.560
I know people that have been doing that, and I know that they've been loving it.

11:54.560 --> 11:59.520
And one thing that I hear over and over again from our audience is the support is incredible.

11:59.520 --> 12:03.240
When they need it, Linode support has been outstanding.

12:03.240 --> 12:08.000
Great support, super fast rigs, crazy great networking, and 11 data centers to choose

12:08.000 --> 12:09.000
from.

12:09.000 --> 12:10.800
Yeah, there's a lot of reasons to like Linode.

12:10.800 --> 12:12.040
So let's put it over the top.

12:12.040 --> 12:15.320
Go grab that $100 in credit and support the show.

12:15.320 --> 12:20.160
Linode.com slash LAN.

12:20.160 --> 12:21.420
Do you hear that?

12:21.420 --> 12:24.440
Good Savings is calling Linux.ting.com.

12:24.440 --> 12:26.360
Thanks to Ting for sponsoring this episode.

12:26.360 --> 12:28.720
I've been a Ting customer since 2013.

12:28.720 --> 12:29.720
I love these guys.

12:29.720 --> 12:33.640
I mean, really, it's the way mobile should be done here in the States.

12:33.640 --> 12:35.360
They don't do it good enough.

12:35.360 --> 12:36.360
They didn't have to.

12:36.360 --> 12:37.400
They got in early.

12:37.400 --> 12:41.880
But I've heard from friends outside the country that say, you know, over here in our country

12:41.880 --> 12:45.280
and our fancy country, this is how mobile has to be done.

12:45.280 --> 12:47.540
Ting is a mobile virtual network operator.

12:47.540 --> 12:49.280
They're a lean mean fighting machine.

12:49.280 --> 12:55.880
They focus on the customer experience, value, picking the plans that are simple and straightforward.

12:55.880 --> 12:59.080
Great device selection, that kind of stuff.

12:59.080 --> 13:02.320
Not greasing the wheels of politicians so that way they can dig a hole in the ground

13:02.320 --> 13:04.100
and stand up a tower.

13:04.100 --> 13:05.320
They don't bother with that.

13:05.320 --> 13:06.960
Instead, they work at the meta level.

13:06.960 --> 13:08.400
They rise above it.

13:08.400 --> 13:12.880
And they pick multiple networks that they can work with nationwide coverage.

13:12.880 --> 13:15.280
Great speeds, LTE and 5G.

13:15.280 --> 13:18.280
And their customer support nails it when you need it.

13:18.280 --> 13:24.840
In fact, Ting was recently named the number one carrier by Consumer Reports in 2021.

13:24.840 --> 13:27.240
Ting's plans are simple and straightforward.

13:27.240 --> 13:29.240
It's just the smarter way to do mobile.

13:29.240 --> 13:33.960
And every single plan comes with that great support and no contracts ever.

13:33.960 --> 13:35.640
It's pretty simple to switch to Ting.

13:35.640 --> 13:37.240
Your phone's likely going to work.

13:37.240 --> 13:39.480
So go to linux.ting.com.

13:39.480 --> 13:43.440
Check your current phone, create an account and pick a plan that's just right for you.

13:43.440 --> 13:45.520
Once everything's good to go, Ting will send you a SIM card.

13:45.520 --> 13:46.520
You're going to pop that in your phone.

13:46.520 --> 13:48.560
You'll get activated in minutes.

13:48.560 --> 13:50.920
You'll kind of feel bad for not doing this sooner.

13:50.920 --> 13:52.600
I went through that as well.

13:52.600 --> 13:54.840
But you're going to be so glad you did it.

13:54.840 --> 13:56.040
Start saving.

13:56.040 --> 14:04.200
Same great wireless experience, just better value, linux.ting.com.

14:04.200 --> 14:10.080
You'd be forgiven if you didn't happen to notice the release of GNOME 42 this week.

14:10.080 --> 14:15.040
It was what you might call lacking in ceremony.

14:15.040 --> 14:23.240
But after a bug update to rename the release from RC to final, GNOME 42 has finally landed.

14:23.240 --> 14:27.880
However, before you get too excited about it, and there's a lot of reasons to get excited

14:27.880 --> 14:33.520
here, we should remind you that it will probably be a few weeks before it lands in a distribution

14:33.520 --> 14:41.960
near you, with the upcoming Fedora 36 and Ubuntu 22.04 likely shipping it first.

14:41.960 --> 14:47.000
Now the fact that it's not technically available in a distro easily didn't stop us from giving

14:47.000 --> 14:49.400
it a go just so we could get some impressions for you.

14:49.400 --> 14:50.400
Heck no.

14:50.400 --> 14:52.840
I got to start here with the visual look.

14:52.840 --> 14:54.640
They really took it to the next level.

14:54.640 --> 15:01.380
I wasn't sure what to expect because when GNOME 40 was announced, off in the far distance

15:01.380 --> 15:06.440
was this big transition coming to GNOME 42 that involved Libidwaddy and a new way of

15:06.440 --> 15:10.400
doing dark themes and themes on GNOME in general.

15:10.400 --> 15:13.560
We just didn't know what that was going to materialize.

15:13.560 --> 15:19.600
But this 42 release is just blow away in the terms of visual refinements.

15:19.600 --> 15:23.520
Throughout the desktop and small little spots that I felt like didn't even need attention

15:23.520 --> 15:28.200
have gotten attention, and the GNOME developers have made real efforts to implement a systemwide

15:28.200 --> 15:31.000
dark mode that works here.

15:31.000 --> 15:37.560
And they've also included a couple of pre-selected dark and light wallpapers that look really

15:37.560 --> 15:38.560
great.

15:38.560 --> 15:44.260
And so when you pick a dark mode or a light mode in the appearance selector, it now also

15:44.260 --> 15:47.840
will adjust the wallpaper to be darker light, which just looks great.

15:47.840 --> 15:52.840
And on top of all of that, they're doing this smooth onscreen transition.

15:52.840 --> 15:53.840
They just nailed it.

15:53.840 --> 15:54.920
It looks so good.

15:54.920 --> 15:59.360
Like when they said they were going to do it, they committed to it and they did it right.

15:59.360 --> 16:03.120
This is some impressive work to see, definitely.

16:03.120 --> 16:06.640
But it's not all just shiny new shell work, no.

16:06.640 --> 16:10.460
There's been a whole bunch of stuff behind the scenes to continue the efforts to port

16:10.460 --> 16:17.200
things to GTK4, making a whole bunch of apps faster, and yes, also shinier.

16:17.200 --> 16:23.420
One thing I have mixed feelings though about in this release is that our longtime reliable

16:23.420 --> 16:28.280
text editor, GEdit, is being replaced.

16:28.280 --> 16:33.320
GEdit at least is being replaced by a new text editor that also supports theming.

16:33.320 --> 16:34.320
Oh, okay.

16:34.320 --> 16:35.320
All right.

16:35.320 --> 16:36.320
All right.

16:36.320 --> 16:38.520
I'm picking up on a theme here, I think, Chris.

16:38.520 --> 16:39.520
Yeah.

16:39.520 --> 16:40.520
Yeah, I know.

16:40.520 --> 16:43.080
But GEdit, too soon.

16:43.080 --> 16:47.640
And of course, as with every GNOME release, there's also a whole bunch of bug fixes, a

16:47.640 --> 16:52.280
last minute crash fix, nice catch guys, and performance improvements.

16:52.280 --> 16:58.120
Yeah, I think we'll have more on that specifically on the performance part coming up soon.

16:58.120 --> 17:02.840
I also wanted to mention, though, that what's nice about this release is it seemed to really

17:02.840 --> 17:05.720
kind of motivate the general GNOME ecosystem, too.

17:05.720 --> 17:10.320
So you see a lot of numerous third party projects have been making improvements to try to land

17:10.320 --> 17:11.680
in time for GNOME 42.

17:11.680 --> 17:15.460
So a lot of GTK apps are getting some nice improvements there.

17:15.460 --> 17:17.520
So what we're going to keep doing is using it.

17:17.520 --> 17:18.800
I'll keep running it.

17:18.800 --> 17:23.080
Brendan West are going to give it a go and we'll give it a review in Sunday's Linux Unplugged.

17:23.080 --> 17:27.400
We'll dig into some of the performance stuff and some of the areas they've improved, including

17:27.400 --> 17:33.840
how they're doing remote windows and desktop applications with a full Wayland setup now.

17:33.840 --> 17:37.080
Because I know a lot of people who use that on X11 have been wondering what the solution

17:37.080 --> 17:38.600
is going to be for Wayland.

17:38.600 --> 17:41.320
That is now baked in and we'll give that a try as well.

17:41.320 --> 17:44.440
So don't miss our coverage in Sunday's Linux Unplugged.

17:44.440 --> 17:49.360
And if you want to go get your hands on it, the Fedora 36 beta and Ubuntu 2204 betas are

17:49.360 --> 17:50.360
out there.

17:50.360 --> 17:52.120
Let us know what you think.

17:52.120 --> 17:54.920
But that does bring us to the end of this week's Linux Action News.

17:54.920 --> 17:59.740
