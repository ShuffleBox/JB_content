00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,440
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, our weekly take on Linux and the open source world.

2
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:20,540
This is episode 91 recorded on February 3rd, 2019.

3
00:00:20,540 --> 00:00:21,540
I'm Chris.

4
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:22,540
And I'm Joe.

5
00:00:22,540 --> 00:00:23,540
Hello, Joe.

6
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:25,040
It's good to be connected with you.

7
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:28,680
And it is a great week to be a Firefox user.

8
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:31,400
Yeah, Firefox 65 has come out.

9
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:33,960
And it is all about privacy.

10
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:38,720
Privacy really has turned into a bit of a buzzword, hasn't it, especially recently after

11
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:42,240
the proposed changes by Google and Chromium.

12
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:47,320
It seems like privacy for the web browser is the battlefield for 2019.

13
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:50,280
And Firefox isn't going to be left out of that fight, Joe.

14
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:54,680
Yeah, they've got a new set of redesigned controls to give you real granularity about

15
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:57,620
how you protect yourself when you're browsing.

16
00:00:57,620 --> 00:00:59,000
This is a really sensible approach.

17
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,800
So the default is standard for anyone who wants to just set it and forget it.

18
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:06,320
It's the default right now, you're good to go.

19
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:11,700
And it really is the perfect setting for those of you who expect ultimate privacy when you

20
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:13,840
open up their private browsing mode.

21
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:18,360
But for the rest of us that want a little more, quote unquote, strict control.

22
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:22,800
That's for people who want a bit more protection and don't mind if a couple of sites here and

23
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:23,880
there break.

24
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:29,720
This setting blocks all known trackers by Firefox, regardless of the privacy mode or

25
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:30,720
not.

26
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:34,840
But then if you like to kind of get down to the weeds, they also have now a custom mode.

27
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:37,280
That's three different modes, Joe, for privacy.

28
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:41,440
Well, it's always been the browser for the power user with the about config options and

29
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:42,480
everything.

30
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:47,300
And now with the privacy settings, you've got real control as a power user if you want

31
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:53,200
it or if you want to just go for the defaults, then that's pretty much fine for most people.

32
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,840
So it kind of serves both types of users.

33
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:56,520
Yeah, it's really not bad, is it?

34
00:01:56,520 --> 00:02:01,440
It's nice to see the three different options and to see them expand out this built in set

35
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:03,000
of options.

36
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:08,120
But it's pretty generic and basic and not enough.

37
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:09,640
It's really one of those feature sets.

38
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:13,160
It's good to see, but it's not enough to move the needle.

39
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:18,320
That said, some of the things that they are working on for future versions of Firefox,

40
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:20,600
I think that kind of stuff could move the needle.

41
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:24,680
Well, in the next version, 66, it looks like they're going to implement a feature that

42
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:26,880
warns users about man in the middle attacks.

43
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:29,920
So again, it's all about privacy and security.

44
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:30,920
Right.

45
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:36,320
This is a very, very useful feature, especially for those of you on Windows.

46
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:43,040
Starting with version 66, Firefox will let you know if, say, a rando antivirus product

47
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:49,620
or malware or maybe even your ISP is intercepting your HTTP and HTTPS traffic.

48
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:55,600
They're building in a new style of air page into Firefox when it detects this kind of

49
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:56,600
shenanigans.

50
00:02:56,600 --> 00:03:01,920
And the way this feature works is to show that visual, hey, you user, your traffic is

51
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:02,920
being intercepted.

52
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:07,760
You need to look into the software on your computer or ask questions with your ISP.

53
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:13,440
That is the kind of feature set that I don't really see Google all that compelled to introduce.

54
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:18,240
Well, that's hopefully what's going to save Firefox and Mozilla here, because we all know

55
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:24,200
that Chrome has just been absolutely eating up all the market share and Firefox is way,

56
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:29,520
way down now, almost insignificant in terms of percentage.

57
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:33,720
But hopefully with features like this, they might be able to claw some of that market

58
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:40,020
share back and become more relevant as people wake up to the reality that their data is

59
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:45,040
actually worth something and they should be a bit more careful about who they give it

60
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,040
to.

61
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:50,800
With that said, I can't help but take a bit of a downer note on this story, because when

62
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:55,720
I look at what Firefox is attempting to do, I'll give you an example.

63
00:03:55,720 --> 00:04:00,280
They've limited, the limit is remarkable, it's like four or five extensions.

64
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:04,160
When you consider all of the extensions available to Firefox, Mozilla has picked four or five

65
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:08,760
that they are occasionally recommending to a subset of users.

66
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:12,780
An example would be if you go to Facebook, Mozilla will recommend an extension to you

67
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:14,540
called the Facebook container.

68
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:18,600
This is one of the best things that has come out of Mozilla in the last five years.

69
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:23,600
It completely isolates everything about Facebook to an isolated Firefox container.

70
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:28,560
It can't track you across websites, it's contained to this specific environment.

71
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:32,400
And yet, users are reacting very negatively.

72
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:39,920
In fact, bug 1523701 has been filed in the last three days, essentially saying, you're

73
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:44,400
advertising to me, you're giving me advertisements and I think at the end of the day, what it

74
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:48,900
represents is Mozilla has lost the trust of their users.

75
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:52,600
And if they can't keep their existing user base happy, then how can they possibly hope

76
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,200
to grow?

77
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:58,720
That's a bit of a negative take on it, but I'm inclined to agree, unfortunately.

78
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:04,180
But I don't know, maybe people who are the hardcore Firefox users at this point actually

79
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:07,340
care about open source and software freedom and everything.

80
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:11,440
And they're the ones who are going to go on Reddit, ironically, and complain about this

81
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:12,440
stuff.

82
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:19,240
And maybe the people who read the mainstream headlines about Google doing evil things and

83
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:24,000
Facebook doing evil things might then do a little bit of digging and discover Firefox

84
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,160
and remember, oh, yeah, I used to use that before I switched to Chrome.

85
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:29,800
And maybe, oh, right, this recommendation, that looks cool.

86
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:36,760
So maybe the existing users might be a bit alienated, but the users that they will attract

87
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:40,080
might find this good, I don't know.

88
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:42,680
Maybe I'm being naive.

89
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:47,800
Yeah, that's very optimistic for you, Joe, I got to say.

90
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:55,120
Well, it's all good in the hood if you are an HP user, because I am extremely thrilled

91
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:59,360
this week to say that LVFS is welcoming HP to the fold.

92
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:04,240
Yeah, this is excellent news that I did somewhat see coming, but not this quickly.

93
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:08,800
Because we're seeing other major OEM sign ups with Linux vendor firmware service.

94
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:12,120
But now HP is like the other behemoth.

95
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:18,520
So almost all laptops now, potentially, are going to be updatable via the GUI when it

96
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:19,520
comes to firmware.

97
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:20,720
And that's got to be a good thing.

98
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,120
So you did see this coming, huh?

99
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:24,000
I got to be honest, I didn't.

100
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:29,320
I mean, after System76 said, nah, no, not for us, I wasn't sure what direction this

101
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:30,320
would go.

102
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:32,240
But since then, we saw a doubling down from Dell.

103
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,840
We saw AMI get in the game.

104
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:40,000
We've seen HP and even Lenovo get in the game.

105
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:45,040
To me, it's like every time one of these new vendors comes along, it's a total unique delight.

106
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:49,500
I am so thrilled, because I guess I just don't expect it.

107
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:53,700
Because when I think of Linux computers, I don't think of HP.

108
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:59,700
But they're looking at the Z2, Z6, Z8, Z440 line.

109
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:04,520
That's the kind of rigs they're targeting, maybe even the Z840 and more.

110
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:05,520
OK.

111
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:06,520
All right.

112
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:07,520
It's starting to click with me.

113
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:09,080
But I guess I just didn't see HP next.

114
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:12,640
If you were going to ask me to make a prediction, say, at the beginning of the year, I don't

115
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:14,120
know if HP would have been on that list.

116
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:18,480
Well, he likes to drop hints, usually, about the various companies that he's in negotiations

117
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:20,720
with and working with.

118
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:23,840
And it obviously takes quite a while to make these things happen.

119
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:26,720
And just the speculation of being that it would be HP.

120
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,720
So I was pleasantly surprised to see it.

121
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:32,200
It'd be good if they could support more models, but I suppose you have to start somewhere.

122
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:38,240
Reading his blog, though, for a while now, you get a real sense of pride in his work,

123
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:40,200
which is completely understandable.

124
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:44,400
And I hope he does feel a sense of pride because he's doing a huge service for Linux users.

125
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:50,080
But in that sense of pride, he kind of can't help but give a little indication of what's

126
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:51,240
coming next.

127
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:54,680
And in the blog post, it's not even vague.

128
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:55,920
It's pretty much in your face.

129
00:07:55,920 --> 00:08:02,960
He says, even seemingly unlikely companies like Microsoft are still interested in shipping

130
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:07,240
firmware on LVFS in the future.

131
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:12,080
Does that mean we're about to get firmware updates for Surface Books on Linux?

132
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:13,080
What does that mean, Joe?

133
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:17,560
Well, surely we'd have to get actual, proper Linux support first before we got any firmware

134
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:18,560
updates.

135
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:22,760
When I read that, I'm thinking to myself, are we talking about Azure Sphere OS?

136
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:24,760
Yeah, you never know.

137
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:27,560
But something that people have actually been getting their hands on over the weekend at

138
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:34,240
Fosdom is new hardware from Pine64, including a tablet and an upgraded PineBook Pro.

139
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,240
Right.

140
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:37,520
But the real story here is the freaking prices.

141
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:42,440
I mean, if you want all your gadgets running pure Linux, then Pine64 has you covered.

142
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:47,000
But if you don't have a lot of money to spend, well, then Pine64 has you covered.

143
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:53,320
And the news coming out of Fosdom this year is really about the Pine Tab, a 10-inch tablet

144
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:55,920
with either Linux or BSD.

145
00:08:55,920 --> 00:09:01,440
Inside the Pine Tab, you'll find a 64-bit system-on-a-chip ARM processor.

146
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:09,240
It's a Cortex A53 quad-core processor, a Mali 400 GPU, two gigabytes of DDR3 RAM, 16 gigabytes

147
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:16,480
of eMMC storage built in, and two megapixel front camera and a five megapixel rear shooter.

148
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:23,040
All of that is behind a 10-inch LCD touchscreen, which is running about 720p for 80 bucks.

149
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:27,200
Yeah, but you do have to take that price with a bit of a pinch of salt.

150
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:32,800
$79 might end up being more like $150 by the time you've paid for shipping and import duty

151
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:33,800
and stuff.

152
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:35,200
But it's still fairly cheap.

153
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:39,480
But then it's a fairly low-res screen and things, so it's probably a fair price for

154
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:40,480
it.

155
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:45,100
And it is worth keeping in mind that the demo model that they've got at Fosdom is running

156
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:46,820
Android at the moment.

157
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:52,120
But they have said that it is fairly similar specs-wise to the original PineBook.

158
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:55,400
And there's plenty of distros and ROMs available for that.

159
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:59,240
So in theory, they should work with minimal tweaking.

160
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:04,280
So the software support should be there pretty much from day one, and I'm very tempted to

161
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:05,280
get this.

162
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:07,080
Yeah, but what do you think about that $20 keyboard?

163
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:11,780
I think that looks pretty good, and the people I've spoken to at Fosdom say it's pretty

164
00:10:11,780 --> 00:10:12,780
solid as well.

165
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:13,780
Really?

166
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:14,780
Oh, okay.

167
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:18,000
See, I was thinking $20 magnetic keyboard, there's no way they can deliver that.

168
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,800
That out of all of this was the thing I was the most skeptical about.

169
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:27,000
Well, yeah, I mean, for the price, obviously, it's not going to be the quality of a Surface

170
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,880
or whatever.

171
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:32,920
This is a budget device, and you have to go into it with that in mind.

172
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:38,320
But based on my PineBook, that for a budget device feels relatively high-end.

173
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:42,620
It's plastic and everything, but it's solid plastic and doesn't creak and bend and everything.

174
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:45,640
So I give them the benefit of the doubt on that.

175
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:50,200
But this PineBook Pro, now they're making some pretty hefty claims about that.

176
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:54,840
Yeah, the PineBook Pro is what I am actually excited about.

177
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:59,440
And it's just anecdotally what I've heard the most from the audience from this week.

178
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:09,840
I mean, the idea is a 14-inch 1080p IPS display with about 128GB of eMMC storage, 4GB of system

179
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:15,800
RAM, and maybe the option of adding your own MV&E SSD drive.

180
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:22,440
Plus, you get all the usual ports like USB-A, USB-C, and inside that sucker, a dual-core

181
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:26,720
ARM processor, maybe a quad-core, depending on the way the specs work out, and the whole

182
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:32,080
thing comes together for $200, that puts it below a Chromebook, Joe.

183
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:35,400
Yeah, and it is the same processor that's used in a fair few Chromebooks as well.

184
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:38,880
So in theory, you should get decent performance from it.

185
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:42,760
Now, what piqued my interest towards the end of this part of their announcement was where

186
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:48,760
they said that the PineBooks that people already have might well be upgradable to this.

187
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:51,380
Because it's very hackable, the PineBook that I've got.

188
00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:56,040
You can open it up with like 10 screws or whatever, and they're just standard screws.

189
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:59,760
And you can see all the boards right there, and it wouldn't be difficult to change the

190
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,280
insides of this thing.

191
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:05,660
And you've got the screen, the keyboard, touchpad, battery, and all the ports.

192
00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:09,400
And so in theory, you could put in the more powerful hardware and have an actual usable

193
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:14,200
laptop, because at the moment, it's not a daily driver, and they make no bones about

194
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,200
that.

195
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:19,120
But they're saying that this PineBook Pro would be daily driver-worthy.

196
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:25,440
In the Chromebook category, you're not going to be compiling kernels on it in 10 minutes.

197
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:30,400
It's a fairly lightweight browsing machine, but the claim is that it would be good enough

198
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:31,660
to do that.

199
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:38,260
And so I had been tempted to sell my PineBook and maybe get the tablet, but now I'm thinking

200
00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:43,080
maybe hang on, and hopefully it'll be not that expensive to buy just the board to put

201
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:47,880
inside my PineBook, and I could be off to the races.

202
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:48,880
No kidding, right?

203
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:53,520
Like how cool would it be if the part of the Pine brand was upgradability?

204
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:59,320
I mean, it seems like such an obvious thing, but you can't name a single brand that's well

205
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:03,800
recognized that is known for the upgradability of its components and its laptops.

206
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:04,800
That just doesn't exist.

207
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:08,880
Yeah, well, these days you're lucky to get RAM slots rather than soldered RAM.

208
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:10,960
Or disk, yeah.

209
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:15,840
And so if you could change the entire system on a chip and the whole basically motherboard

210
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:18,800
of it very easily and relatively cheaply...

211
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:20,560
Swap it out, just the whole board.

212
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:22,960
I think that'd be pretty great.

213
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:27,880
And to say nothing about the other rumors coming out of FOSDEM, the one that I'm probably

214
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:32,600
the most looking forward to is a $20 open source IP camera.

215
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:34,960
I would be all about that.

216
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:39,980
And then there's the one that I'm the most skeptical about, which is the $150 Linux smartphone

217
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:42,000
with an unspecified screen size.

218
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,400
Well, they do actually have working dev kits of that phone, which is more than you can

219
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:47,120
say of Purism at this stage.

220
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:48,240
Oh, shots fired.

221
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:49,240
Shots fired indeed.

222
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:52,080
But, you know, and they're being very modest about it.

223
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:54,480
They're not making this big song and dance about the phone.

224
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:59,560
They're kind of saying that we're working on it and, you know, here's a prototype and,

225
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:02,580
you know, it's not this big grand product.

226
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:06,160
And that's kind of never been their style as it's always been.

227
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:08,320
We're aimed at hackers and tinkerers.

228
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:13,200
And you know, this is the phone that we're working on and it's going to be ready when

229
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:17,240
it's ready rather than making firm promises and then not keeping them.

230
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:22,680
It seems like a genuine, clear understanding of the actual marketplace.

231
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:27,440
And then you combine that with the same thing that I feel like other projects we've talked

232
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:31,880
about in the same space, sort of primarily Plasma Mobile, where they come at it with

233
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:33,440
a humbleness.

234
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:35,080
This is where we're at today.

235
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:38,400
You know, this is what we can offer today and we think it's something that is unique

236
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:42,280
to hackers and we're trying to offer it at a competitive price point.

237
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:46,040
We're not saying it's going to replace the iPhone or compete with the Pixel.

238
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:51,080
But if you are in this particular market and you even know what these things mean, we have

239
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:52,600
a product for you.

240
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:53,600
And God bless them, Joe.

241
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,560
Yeah, and they have the attitude of come and help us.

242
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:57,880
This is an open source project, come and help us hack on it.

243
00:14:57,880 --> 00:14:58,880
Yeah.

244
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:02,600
And that is the right approach, because then it's not, oh, we're going to take over the

245
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:03,600
world.

246
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:07,520
We're going to fundamentally change the consumer landscape and alter cloud computing all in

247
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:08,520
one swoop.

248
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:12,800
It's, hey, we have something we think is appealing and we're going to iterate on it for years.

249
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:15,640
And eventually we're going to get to something that we think is super competitive.

250
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:17,400
In the meantime, help us make it better.

251
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:18,400
Yeah.

252
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:21,480
In the meantime, hackers are going to use it and have fun doing so.

253
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:25,320
But I suppose the elephant in the room whenever we're talking about any of these arm based

254
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:29,200
systems is the Raspberry Pi Foundation.

255
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:33,820
And you and I have some predictions in the works, in play, as you might say, that could

256
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:35,800
be affected by this next news story.

257
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:38,520
But we're here to report the news as it is.

258
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:44,360
It appears we will not see a Raspberry Pi 4 at least in 2019.

259
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:48,720
Yeah, this is very disappointing to me because I predicted this with great confidence that

260
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:52,080
we'd see it this year, but apparently not.

261
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:56,920
In an interview with Tom's Hardware, Evan Upton has said that, no, it's not happening

262
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:57,960
this year.

263
00:15:57,960 --> 00:16:00,280
It will be called the Raspberry Pi 4.

264
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:05,460
It will be $35 and it will be more powerful and have more RAM.

265
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:09,960
So it's most of what we thought, but it's just not going to be this year, which is going

266
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:11,680
to disappoint quite a lot of people, I think.

267
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:12,680
Well, not just other people.

268
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:13,680
I mean, just you and me.

269
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:20,040
Like I was hoping that we would have a super cheap Raspberry Pi, a $35 Raspberry Pi, and

270
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:28,080
then like a $55 Raspberry Pi or so, because the reality is, Joe, is $35 today isn't necessarily

271
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:31,840
buying you what $35 bought you when the Raspberry Pi launched.

272
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:36,600
And I think there's room in there for a more feature, maybe more memory, more processor,

273
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:38,880
but more feature rich Raspberry Pi.

274
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:43,360
I've made this argument before and reading this over at Tom's Hardware, I can see that

275
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:45,880
Evan is totally in disagreement with me.

276
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:49,760
Well, he does seem to be very much sticking to that $35 price and has done from the very

277
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:50,760
beginning.

278
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:57,040
But if you consider with inflation, that $35 doesn't actually go as far as it once did.

279
00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:00,600
It's roughly equivalent to about $38 in today's money.

280
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:06,520
So if they're only selling it for $35 now, then it makes it very tricky for them to squeeze

281
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:08,560
more and more performance out of a new model.

282
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:12,000
I really recommend that people read this article because it made something really click for

283
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
me.

284
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,440
And you just touched on it, Joe.

285
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:17,480
They're really sticking to this $35 price.

286
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:22,560
Now, who knows, maybe they'll have future products that are outside the core Raspberry

287
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:27,920
Pi product line that are of a completely different price like they did with the Xero.

288
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:31,920
But reading this article, it seems like he's pretty committed to that $35 price point.

289
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:38,320
And I think that's important for the market because at their scale, they are actually

290
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:44,000
applying downward pressure on the prices for the overall component ecosystem.

291
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:48,740
But it also, to me, resonates with something that the audience has been giving us as solid

292
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:51,720
feedback anytime we talk about the Raspberry Pi.

293
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:56,420
And that is simply summed up as there are really good competitive alternatives.

294
00:17:56,420 --> 00:18:00,880
And it seems to me that those competitive alternatives just got even more competitive

295
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:01,880
with this.

296
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:03,160
So both the audience is right.

297
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:07,920
But at the same time, the Raspberry Pi is doing us an overall good by putting downward

298
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:10,320
pressure on the prices of the entire market.

299
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:16,000
Well, that's true, but we talked about Pine64 and it feels like if the Raspberry Pi Foundation

300
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:21,680
don't put out a new board this year, then Pine64 might well start eating their lunch.

301
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:25,160
I mean, there's a lot of other boards out there.

302
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:28,040
Most of them are like orange pie, banana pie, that sort of thing.

303
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:32,540
For my money, anything that has Pi in the name is a cheap rip off and is just to be

304
00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:33,540
avoided.

305
00:18:33,540 --> 00:18:39,640
Now, that's maybe the wrong attitude to have, but it just feels like just cheap and nasty

306
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:41,400
to me to put a pie in the name.

307
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:47,120
Whereas Pine64, what makes them sort of sets them apart is that they don't need to try

308
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:48,120
and cash in.

309
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:50,100
They just do what they're doing.

310
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:52,200
And that makes me take them more seriously.

311
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:53,560
I totally agree.

312
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:58,600
And on top of that, you also have to figure RISC-V is now a real player in the marketplace

313
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:00,900
and there are RISC-V boards being built.

314
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:03,960
And that is also competition for the Raspberry Pi.

315
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:04,960
That is true.

316
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:05,960
Yeah.

317
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:10,560
I mean, the photo of a RISC-V board running plasma mobile at FOSDEM, I mean, it's nowhere

318
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:15,200
near the size of a Raspberry Pi and it's going to be significantly more expensive at this

319
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:16,200
stage.

320
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:21,360
But that is coming and we saw Raspberry Pi join the RISC-V foundation.

321
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:25,840
So maybe we'll see a RISC-V Pi at some stage.

322
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:28,960
It seems very unlikely anytime soon.

323
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:32,720
But maybe in this hacker board space, the tide is turning and that crown is starting

324
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:35,440
to slip slightly from Raspberry Pi.

325
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:41,120
Raspberry Pi is a brand that is a that's a known quantity and it works in like the education

326
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:48,200
space and business and there is just it's so well recognized that they have carved out

327
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:52,320
a market for themselves now and it is really their game to lose.

328
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:53,320
But that's just an aside.

329
00:19:53,320 --> 00:20:00,280
I want to take a moment and talk about some throwaway comments that Eben makes about USB-C

330
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:04,000
and maybe seeing future Raspberry Pi devices with USB-C.

331
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,240
And this is a quote.

332
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:11,720
He says, there's some awkward decisions in the pin choices on the USB-C connector in

333
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:15,160
a kind of fairly rugged environment that people use the Pi in.

334
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:21,520
If the connector gets twisted or if dust gets in it, you can end up exposing the high speed

335
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:25,960
differential pairs on that connector to rather high voltages.

336
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:31,560
Overall, it sounded like he wasn't very happy with USB-C and was fairly happy with the ports

337
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:33,920
they have on the Raspberry Pi devices right now.

338
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:38,240
Yeah, it seems like he's voting for micro USB still.

339
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:43,140
And he is an engineer with a lot of experience in this area, so you kind of have to trust

340
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:44,140
him on that.

341
00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:49,200
He's obviously looked at it and we all have hailed USB-C as the next big thing and the

342
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:54,320
standard, but he's made me question that now he's doubted my faith in it.

343
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:55,320
Same with me.

344
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:58,920
I have been having doubts about USB-C for months now.

345
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:04,160
Behind the scenes, we've had just issues amongst the staff with different laptops that have

346
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:07,740
come in the house that have different features on the USB-C ports, and you really have no

347
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:12,620
idea of knowing what those ports can do unless you are intimately familiar with the entire

348
00:21:12,620 --> 00:21:14,320
spec of the laptop.

349
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:18,720
And we've just been talking as a group, like, how is this going to work for average consumers?

350
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:24,280
Well, average consumers are going to buy that Meizu Zero phone that's got no ports at all.

351
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:26,200
So I don't think they'll be worried.

352
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:27,200
There you go.

353
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,200
Problem solved.

354
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:33,240
Meanwhile, back here on Earth, those of us who love a great media center fully under

355
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:38,600
our control and of course is open source are celebrating the release of Kodi 18.

356
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:42,200
I tried this out and it doesn't look much different from 17.

357
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:47,800
It's nowhere near the huge leap in skin that we had from 16 to 17, but there's quite a

358
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:49,700
lot under the hood that's changed.

359
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:53,680
You could probably easily be forgiven for missing the changes, to be honest, especially

360
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:58,100
if you're like me, you're on the Nvidia Shield, which I think is one of the best TV devices

361
00:21:58,100 --> 00:21:59,240
ever.

362
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:02,800
And you have Kodi installed on it, which is one of the best media centers ever.

363
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:06,800
This update kind of came along and it was just more good stuff where the last one, like

364
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:11,080
you said, was like this huge change in the way it looked and everything.

365
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:13,200
But what you get under the hood is pretty noteworthy.

366
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:16,480
In fact, what they took out is kind of noteworthy.

367
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:22,520
Nearly half a million lines of code were removed and nearly half a million new lines of code

368
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:24,240
were added.

369
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:25,240
That's arbitrary to us.

370
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:29,960
Half of that stuff could be Hello World for all we know, but it's just kind of a big number.

371
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:39,040
And it represents 10,000 commits to the project, which is 36 different individual open source

372
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:44,600
contributors that are writing code to the main upstream Kodi project now.

373
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:51,080
And it also represents just a ton of beer and wine and retro gaming for us Kodi users.

374
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:55,160
This is something that I tried to try out, if that makes any sense, and didn't get very

375
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:56,160
far.

376
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:58,200
I didn't spend a huge amount of time on it.

377
00:22:58,200 --> 00:22:59,440
I didn't do much reading.

378
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:02,680
I just tried to go in as the kind of new user.

379
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:08,460
And it wasn't immediately obvious to me how to get the emulators working and get my ROMs

380
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:11,080
loaded up and start playing Sonic.

381
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:15,840
So I think this is more aimed at people who get down and dirty with hacking it with extensions

382
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:16,840
and everything.

383
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:18,240
No, actually all that checks out, Joe.

384
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:24,000
I got to say what's great about Kodi and also kind of not great about Kodi is all add ons

385
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,640
are essentially created equal.

386
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:30,320
The Jupiter broadcasting add on that Rob Loach wrote for us like four or five years ago is

387
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:33,940
like on par with some of this new stuff that is headline features.

388
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:39,920
And that's cool and feels great from an independent content creator standpoint, but isn't really

389
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:42,640
serving the project the best it could.

390
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:45,540
That would be one criticism I might have.

391
00:23:45,540 --> 00:23:51,400
But once you kind of live and learn Kodi, you kind of can figure things out.

392
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:57,440
But even that said, it took the audience writing into me personally saying, hey, Chris, by

393
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:01,760
the way, you can use Plex inside of Kodi, do XYZ and it all works.

394
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:06,400
It took like it took about 20 of them writing me before it clicked how to actually set all

395
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,400
of that up.

396
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:13,980
Well, also, they've added DRM to this release, and it's a similar situation is not straightforward

397
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:16,640
to get Netflix and Amazon working in it.

398
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:18,360
It's not out of the box support.

399
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:22,740
It requires you to install add ons and do a bit of hacking.

400
00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:24,400
But that's kind of the beauty of it.

401
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:29,920
It can either be this fairly simple interface that, to be fair, actually adding media to

402
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:35,400
it can be a little bit confusing for new users I've found that I've set up for.

403
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:38,720
But once you've got all that set up, it's really straightforward.

404
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:43,360
Or if you want to get really hacky with it, you can.

405
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:47,720
And you can do all sorts of stuff, including getting Netflix and Amazon working and your

406
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:49,540
ROMs on emulators and everything.

407
00:24:49,540 --> 00:24:54,440
And first and foremost, Kodi is the player that gives me the least screen tearing of

408
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:56,040
any video player on Linux.

409
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:58,080
So that's why I use it.

410
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:59,560
Everybody's got their Kodi reason, Joe.

411
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:01,480
Yeah, I say the least screen tearing.

412
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:02,480
It's not perfect.

413
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:03,480
It's Linux.

414
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:07,600
You know, got to get that X jab in there whenever you can.

415
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:11,380
Before we go all down the Linux hate hole here for a second, can I just say that Kodi

416
00:25:11,380 --> 00:25:18,680
is a standout Android TV application and version 18 adds a couple of nice features that make

417
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:21,680
it feel like a full fledged Android TV application.

418
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:26,400
I don't actually use this, but if you are a fan of Google Assistant on say like the

419
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:33,960
Nvidia Shield TV, Kodi now has full feature support for voice search and voice typing

420
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:35,560
using the remote and all of that.

421
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:39,400
It's I mean, that's like a first class app kind of thing on that ecosystem.

422
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:41,600
It's it's a big deal for a lot of people.

423
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:46,160
It doesn't resonate with me, but it checks a box with the quote unquote market.

424
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:50,660
Well, hopefully they can ride this tide of positive publicity and get to a point where

425
00:25:50,660 --> 00:25:56,000
they're releasing early and often with new features and kind of put the negative publicity

426
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,000
behind them.

427
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,000
I agree.

428
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:01,640
I hope I really hope so, because Kodi is one of these open source projects that makes a

429
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:04,180
daily positive impact on my life.

430
00:26:04,180 --> 00:26:09,120
As we record this episode right now, I am in route from Texas to Washington and many,

431
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:13,640
many times in route, I don't have Internet connectivity and I use Kodi to stream media

432
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:15,000
around my local land.

433
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:20,200
And it is after everything I have tried over the years, the absolute best application for

434
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:21,200
the job.

435
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:25,840
It would negatively impact my life if it went away and it positively impacts my life when

436
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:29,480
they have a new release, just like so many other great open source projects.

437
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:33,800
So much free software now positively impacts my life because I use it on a daily basis

438
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:38,880
and it probably impacts you out there to go to Linux action news dot com slash subscribe
