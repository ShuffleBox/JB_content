00:00.000 --> 00:09.440
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, episode 143, recorded on February 2nd, 2020.

00:09.440 --> 00:10.440
I'm Chris.

00:10.440 --> 00:11.440
And I'm Joe.

00:11.440 --> 00:12.440
Hello, Joe.

00:12.440 --> 00:13.440
Good to be connected with you.

00:13.440 --> 00:16.080
Huge week, a lot to jump into.

00:16.080 --> 00:18.000
Let's start with Qt's changes.

00:18.000 --> 00:21.480
No, not changes that are Qt, but changes from Qt.

00:21.480 --> 00:26.840
Yeah, we're talking about the toolkit that Plasma's based on, sometimes called Qt, from

00:26.840 --> 00:29.240
the Qt company, formerly Trolltech.

00:29.240 --> 00:34.360
To kick the new year off with some big changes, they write on their blog, to support the continuous

00:34.360 --> 00:39.120
growth required to keep Qt as a development platform relevant, we need to make changes

00:39.120 --> 00:40.120
to our offering.

00:40.120 --> 00:45.740
One, installing of Qt binaries will require a Qt account, a.k.a. you'll have to get a

00:45.740 --> 00:49.420
user ID and password, and you'll have to log in to get to them.

00:49.420 --> 00:55.080
Their long-term supported LTS releases and their offline installer will only be available

00:55.080 --> 01:00.160
to commercial licensees, and the new Qt offering for startups and small businesses will be

01:00.160 --> 01:01.160
launched.

01:01.160 --> 01:06.140
It'll be a special price point at $499 a year.

01:06.140 --> 01:10.680
This could put the open source community in a bad situation.

01:10.680 --> 01:16.120
Because if I'm reading this right, Joe, bug fixes will be going to the LTS versions or

01:16.120 --> 01:18.960
the latest development releases of Qt.

01:18.960 --> 01:24.800
In other words, say you're building Corita or KDN Live, you either need to license the

01:24.800 --> 01:30.000
long-term support versions of Qt and get bug fixes on that, which at a minimum would be

01:30.000 --> 01:31.000
$499.

01:31.000 --> 01:37.220
However, I think the Corita Foundation looked into it, and at a budget of $125,000 a year,

01:37.220 --> 01:41.320
they make too much to get that $499 price point.

01:41.320 --> 01:43.780
So who really knows how much they have to pay?

01:43.780 --> 01:48.180
So they either pay an untold amount of money to get the long-term support version, or they

01:48.180 --> 01:52.220
ride that development wave and they stay absolutely current.

01:52.220 --> 01:57.280
So here's the thing to consider, we're not that far away from Qt 6.

01:57.280 --> 01:58.600
And then what do we do?

01:58.600 --> 02:00.640
Does everybody just jump to this brand new release?

02:00.640 --> 02:04.840
Because the older versions, except for the LTS, as far as I understand this, won't be

02:04.840 --> 02:05.840
getting bug fixes.

02:05.840 --> 02:08.100
Well, that seems to be the situation.

02:08.100 --> 02:12.280
And so surely there are only two possible conclusions to this.

02:12.280 --> 02:18.860
Either Qt will be forked and maintained by the community or someone else, and people

02:18.860 --> 02:26.380
will just use that and not necessarily contribute to the original Qt, or the Qt company is going

02:26.380 --> 02:28.220
to have to backpedal on this.

02:28.220 --> 02:30.100
And that seems more likely to me.

02:30.100 --> 02:33.540
I'm pretty sure there's already a serious contender from the community in the works.

02:33.540 --> 02:35.660
I don't know much about it, so I don't want to speak out of turn.

02:35.660 --> 02:39.420
But it seems that the developers are already actively considering that.

02:39.420 --> 02:44.160
I'm left pondering long term what the Qt company's business model is here.

02:44.160 --> 02:48.260
They were already on fragile terms with the open source community's understanding of what

02:48.260 --> 02:50.060
the licensing requirements are.

02:50.060 --> 02:53.780
I've seen them upset developers over changing the rules.

02:53.780 --> 02:57.320
And now this, it just wasn't a step in the right direction.

02:57.320 --> 03:02.180
On the Qt project mailing list, Nikola Marchenko nailed what the new business model is.

03:02.180 --> 03:03.780
And it just sums up my concerns.

03:03.780 --> 03:07.680
He writes, Qt is becoming your average AAA game.

03:07.680 --> 03:10.260
They're essentially selling us time savers.

03:10.260 --> 03:14.460
Most of the attached value of the commercial license isn't something that is inherent to

03:14.460 --> 03:21.580
the license, but stuff that everyone could do anyway, just with a lot of effort.

03:21.580 --> 03:25.760
They are selling us the solution to a problem that they are the ones that are creating in

03:25.760 --> 03:26.760
the first place.

03:26.760 --> 03:29.600
He's talking about these things are going to be selling through the marketplace, which

03:29.600 --> 03:32.300
is the real reason they want you to create an account.

03:32.300 --> 03:36.180
They say they want you to create an account because it will encourage open source community

03:36.180 --> 03:39.060
members to contribute if they already have an account.

03:39.060 --> 03:41.340
And it opens up a dialogue with businesses.

03:41.340 --> 03:46.220
But the real reason is because it also gets you an account in their marketplace.

03:46.220 --> 03:50.160
Here's what they're offering developers now, a login requirement that you have to get credentials

03:50.160 --> 03:56.020
for, no offline packages, you have to spend time compiling Qt with your own system, no

03:56.020 --> 04:00.980
LTS support unless you buy it, or go find one of the community forks that will undoubtedly

04:00.980 --> 04:04.260
be created around their own LTS fork.

04:04.260 --> 04:07.860
And it's all possible to do all of that without paying.

04:07.860 --> 04:11.080
So they're just asking you, pay us some money and we'll solve these problems for you that

04:11.080 --> 04:13.400
we just created.

04:13.400 --> 04:16.180
And they're not even really doing it right.

04:16.180 --> 04:17.620
Because it's not something you couldn't solve.

04:17.620 --> 04:19.960
It's not some unsolvable problem without their help.

04:19.960 --> 04:23.140
It's something if you just put a little time and effort into it and go find the right stuff

04:23.140 --> 04:24.140
in the community.

04:24.140 --> 04:26.620
Yeah, I'll solve it.

04:26.620 --> 04:30.980
Also, there's alternatives to Qt now that are getting less buggy and more efficient

04:30.980 --> 04:32.460
as Qt gets bigger.

04:32.460 --> 04:35.340
I just don't know what they're thinking here.

04:35.340 --> 04:38.940
It's so disappointing because I know it's something that is so useful.

04:38.940 --> 04:44.640
It has been impressive to watch the plasma desktop build off of these technologies.

04:44.640 --> 04:49.620
And all of the great Qt applications in that ecosystem have just in the last five years

04:49.620 --> 04:53.100
have just gotten better and more feature rich and more stable.

04:53.100 --> 04:55.960
So it's a real punch to the gut to see stuff like this.

04:55.960 --> 04:57.220
So what do you see happening here?

04:57.220 --> 04:59.580
Do you think they'll backpedal like I do?

04:59.580 --> 05:00.580
I don't.

05:00.580 --> 05:01.980
I don't think they'll backpedal.

05:01.980 --> 05:02.980
I wish they would.

05:02.980 --> 05:06.740
But I think the community will adapt and they'll come up with their own solutions.

05:06.740 --> 05:12.100
But I think upstairs in the tower of the Qt company, they're looking at their businesses

05:12.100 --> 05:16.140
there, their papers in Finland, and they're saying to ourselves, you know what?

05:16.140 --> 05:20.820
Our headcount in the last year increased from 295 to 339.

05:20.820 --> 05:24.960
And our revenue, all our charts show things are growing.

05:24.960 --> 05:29.460
Our open source strategy is working because look at this.

05:29.460 --> 05:30.780
Our revenues are going up.

05:30.780 --> 05:32.280
Our company is growing.

05:32.280 --> 05:34.380
More Qt is in deployment than ever.

05:34.380 --> 05:35.380
Everything's great.

05:35.380 --> 05:38.380
But you have to wonder how long it's going to keep going well for them if they keep making

05:38.380 --> 05:39.780
decisions like this.

05:39.780 --> 05:44.000
Well, Linus thought it was a good decision to release Linux 5.5.

05:44.000 --> 05:47.280
And he says, quote, it was a pretty quiet week.

05:47.280 --> 05:54.380
If this is Linus's version of quiet, I don't want to know his version of crazy busy.

05:54.380 --> 05:58.860
There's a lot of stuff in here that I personally am very pleased to see land in the Linux kernel.

05:58.860 --> 06:02.980
Well, yeah, one of the huge ones is mainline support for the Raspberry Pi 4.

06:02.980 --> 06:05.020
Yeah, that's great.

06:05.020 --> 06:07.300
I'm hearing that I have a handful of them.

06:07.300 --> 06:10.540
Also temperature info from MVME SSDs.

06:10.540 --> 06:11.540
That's pretty great.

06:11.540 --> 06:17.620
But the one that really tickles me is I have a seven year old Logitech G15 gaming keyboard

06:17.620 --> 06:22.360
that actually runs Linux itself and has a little display on it.

06:22.360 --> 06:27.660
And support for that sucker landed thanks to a Red Hat engineer in 5.5.

06:27.660 --> 06:30.500
I'm going to go take that thing out of the closet.

06:30.500 --> 06:31.500
No way.

06:31.500 --> 06:34.860
I didn't think that anyone would have one still from 15 years ago.

06:34.860 --> 06:35.860
It's like a surfboard.

06:35.860 --> 06:39.080
It is a serious little machine in there and it gets warm.

06:39.080 --> 06:44.340
Also kind of cool to see some code from System76 landing in the Linux kernel.

06:44.340 --> 06:45.900
Yeah, the ACPI driver.

06:45.900 --> 06:48.820
And I noticed that too and thought, that's cool that they're getting some stuff upstreamed.

06:48.820 --> 06:53.380
But I do have to correct you on your pronunciation of NVME as usual.

06:53.380 --> 06:54.380
Did I get it wrong again?

06:54.380 --> 06:55.380
I really tried this time.

06:55.380 --> 06:56.700
I know you tried.

06:56.700 --> 07:00.180
But that one kind of scares me because it means I'm probably gonna have to buy a heat

07:00.180 --> 07:03.060
sink when I see how hot mine is running.

07:03.060 --> 07:04.300
I can see the telegrams now.

07:04.300 --> 07:05.620
You think this is right?

07:05.620 --> 07:06.620
Check yours.

07:06.620 --> 07:07.620
What's your temperature at?

07:07.620 --> 07:08.620
Yeah.

07:08.620 --> 07:09.940
And good news for you, Joe.

07:09.940 --> 07:13.420
They landed Thunderbolt 3 support for Macs in this kernel.

07:13.420 --> 07:17.900
I know your brand new MacBook Pro is going to need that.

07:17.900 --> 07:24.700
My Core 2 Joe or MacBook Pro has got USB 2, I think, and some sort of FireWire.

07:24.700 --> 07:25.860
I think that's already all supported.

07:25.860 --> 07:27.780
Oh, you got FireWire on that thing.

07:27.780 --> 07:28.780
Oh, yeah.

07:28.780 --> 07:32.500
I'm a big fan of FireWire.

07:32.500 --> 07:34.140
I do really like this kernel.

07:34.140 --> 07:44.060
However, I can't help but look at the new Shiny because Linux 5.6 is on track to mainline

07:44.060 --> 07:45.500
WireGuard.

07:45.500 --> 07:53.020
It's in Linus's tree right now, and there is such an unlikely chance it's gonna be taken

07:53.020 --> 07:54.020
out at this stage.

07:54.020 --> 07:59.180
I have set my expectations to mild, but it's so unlikely.

07:59.180 --> 08:00.420
It's like a lock pretty much.

08:00.420 --> 08:01.620
Yeah, and this is huge.

08:01.620 --> 08:03.220
We've been waiting for this for how long?

08:03.220 --> 08:10.580
I think 2,000 years because I feel like this has been the software that we have essentially

08:10.580 --> 08:15.980
waited the last three or four releases for, and it just wasn't quite there, but part of

08:15.980 --> 08:21.420
what's pushed this over the final line, I suspect, is WireGuard's main developer, Jason

08:21.420 --> 08:27.020
Donfield, has also been contributing to the AVX crypto optimizations to the kernel, which

08:27.020 --> 08:31.740
is not part of WireGuard itself, but something WireGuard could potentially use.

08:31.740 --> 08:35.500
And I think that's helped get that more performant, which is up to the standards of WireGuard,

08:35.500 --> 08:39.380
and the two have kind of come together at the right time, and it's a kumbaya, and Linus

08:39.380 --> 08:42.820
has always been a big fan of the technology to begin with.

08:42.820 --> 08:48.780
And here we are with a simple change line that just says, quote, add WireGuard.

08:48.780 --> 08:55.940
But come on, the biggest change coming in 5.6 is a fix for the 2038 bug in 32-bit kernels.

08:55.940 --> 08:56.940
I saw that.

08:56.940 --> 08:57.940
Yeah, yeah.

08:57.940 --> 09:00.780
I don't know about you, but I'm a little disappointed in this one.

09:00.780 --> 09:04.800
I was really looking forward to some Y2K hype again.

09:04.800 --> 09:06.780
Everything that's old is new again, and I'm ready for that.

09:06.780 --> 09:08.100
That was a good time.

09:08.100 --> 09:10.940
Can you believe that that is happening in 18 years?

09:10.940 --> 09:13.300
I mean, I'd like one a little sooner than that.

09:13.300 --> 09:15.720
I'd like another hype cycle.

09:15.720 --> 09:16.780
For me, it was a great time.

09:16.780 --> 09:19.140
I remember we stayed up late.

09:19.140 --> 09:23.180
We waited to see if the world burned down, and then my coworker and I loaded up in our

09:23.180 --> 09:27.820
car, and we went to work, and we checked on all the servers to make sure everything was

09:27.820 --> 09:28.820
working.

09:28.820 --> 09:34.500
As a young IT professional, I looked back on it very fondly, and I had no skin in the

09:34.500 --> 09:35.500
game.

09:35.500 --> 09:36.500
Everybody was freaking out.

09:36.500 --> 09:37.500
I'm like, yeah, whatever happens, happens.

09:37.500 --> 09:38.500
I got a job.

09:38.500 --> 09:39.500
Fair enough.

09:39.500 --> 09:41.340
It was great.

09:41.340 --> 09:44.340
But USB 4.0 is also going to be in 5.6.

09:44.340 --> 09:45.340
Yeah.

09:45.340 --> 09:48.540
Boy, talk about getting stuff before it's even needed in the market.

09:48.540 --> 09:51.340
I love when vendors work upstream.

09:51.340 --> 09:54.780
Along with that USB 4.0 support is also a bunch of other drivers and things that make

09:54.780 --> 10:02.660
that possible, and finally, time namespace, which was originally proposed back in 2018,

10:02.660 --> 10:07.460
it allows for per namespace offsets to the system clock.

10:07.460 --> 10:09.940
I know, what?

10:09.940 --> 10:11.220
It's crazy.

10:11.220 --> 10:17.740
But think of a multi-thousand container system or multi-hundred even container system, and

10:17.740 --> 10:23.180
you want to boot things up in a way where everything's in the right time, everything's

10:23.180 --> 10:27.020
in the right sync, even though there's delays just because of the pure load of that.

10:27.020 --> 10:33.060
If you can factor for that and set time offsets in those namespaces, well, then magic can

10:33.060 --> 10:34.060
happen.

10:34.060 --> 10:37.780
I actually don't know what the primary use case would be other than compensating for

10:37.780 --> 10:40.940
boot time, but perhaps that's enough reason to implement this.

10:40.940 --> 10:43.380
I just think it's the coolest feature ever.

10:43.380 --> 10:44.380
Time namespaces, Joe.

10:44.380 --> 10:48.980
Yeah, I knew you'd notice that one with you being all in on containers these days.

10:48.980 --> 10:49.980
Oh, yeah.

10:49.980 --> 10:50.980
Well, I'm just so all in.

10:50.980 --> 10:52.260
You know what it is?

10:52.260 --> 10:55.860
It's just that I'm sort of sick and tired of doing VMs.

10:55.860 --> 11:01.900
Looks like Michael Larable over at Feromics noticed that Ubuntu 2004, even though it will

11:01.900 --> 11:08.000
ship an older kernel, will backport WireGuard into Ubuntu 2004, which is important since

11:08.000 --> 11:10.580
that's a long-term support.

11:10.580 --> 11:15.620
Not technically too hard either since WireGuard has been maintaining a tree that goes alongside

11:15.620 --> 11:20.020
the Linux kernel for years now, so the code's there.

11:20.020 --> 11:23.640
It just had to do the work to bring it in and get the userspace tools up in the archive

11:23.640 --> 11:24.640
and all that.

11:24.640 --> 11:25.640
It looks like that's happening.

11:25.640 --> 11:28.220
So it looks like 2020 is the year of WireGuard then.

11:28.220 --> 11:29.220
Whoop, whoop.

11:29.220 --> 11:33.940
I don't think I made a prediction about that, which is a massive oversight on my part.

11:33.940 --> 11:36.300
Yeah, but Alex did, so he's got that one over here.

11:36.300 --> 11:37.300
Ah, dang it.

11:37.300 --> 11:38.300
Good for him.

11:38.300 --> 11:39.300
Good for him.

11:39.300 --> 11:40.300
Good.

11:40.300 --> 11:41.300
Fair play.

11:41.300 --> 11:42.300
Fair play, I suppose.

11:42.300 --> 11:45.820
Well, something that I'm not sure many people would have predicted is that Thunderbird is

11:45.820 --> 11:52.420
being spun out into its own wholly owned subsidiary, cleverly called the MZLA Technologies Corporation

11:52.420 --> 11:54.660
or MZLA Technologies Corporation.

11:54.660 --> 11:55.660
Yeah, MZLA.

11:55.660 --> 11:58.340
You know, I'm not surprised.

11:58.340 --> 12:02.060
Thunderbird's kind of been on shaky ground from, we're putting her in maintenance mode

12:02.060 --> 12:07.220
to, oh, all right, we'll take donations to, hey, we got some donations I'm going to hire

12:07.220 --> 12:09.060
to now this move.

12:09.060 --> 12:13.020
They write on the blog, this move has been in the works for a while as Thunderbird has

12:13.020 --> 12:16.900
grown in donations, staff, and aspirations.

12:16.900 --> 12:21.860
This will not impact Thunderbird's day-to-day activities or missions.

12:21.860 --> 12:24.740
It will remain free and open source.

12:24.740 --> 12:25.740
So that's good.

12:25.740 --> 12:31.540
They go on to write, moving to MZLA, which sounds a lot like Mozilla, but without some

12:31.540 --> 12:37.180
of the letters, to MZLA Technologies Corporation will not only allow Thunderbird to have more

12:37.180 --> 12:43.060
flexibility and agility, but also allow us to explore offering our users products and

12:43.060 --> 12:46.740
services that were not possible under the Mozilla Foundation.

12:46.740 --> 12:51.900
The move will allow the project to collect revenue through partnerships and non-charitable

12:51.900 --> 12:57.180
donations, which in turn can be used to cover the cost of new products and services.

12:57.180 --> 13:00.100
So we're going to get a VPN client in Thunderbird.

13:00.100 --> 13:04.500
Oh, I hope so.

13:04.500 --> 13:06.220
Yeah.

13:06.220 --> 13:10.340
Let's see, a VPN client, a cloud storage client.

13:10.340 --> 13:11.340
Actually that wouldn't be too bad.

13:11.340 --> 13:13.940
I don't know.

13:13.940 --> 13:18.660
It's never going to happen, but I would pay for really well-developed Mozilla extensions,

13:18.660 --> 13:22.340
like a Fantastic Cal quality calendar from Mozilla.

13:22.340 --> 13:26.060
Fantastic Cal is an app on the phone, just a really great calendar app.

13:26.060 --> 13:30.340
Something that was like Enigma, but even easier and simpler and more approachable, I'd pay

13:30.340 --> 13:32.060
a couple of bucks for that.

13:32.060 --> 13:34.500
I suspect it's through other partnerships.

13:34.500 --> 13:35.980
I have no idea what that could mean.

13:35.980 --> 13:36.980
Maybe it's bundling.

13:36.980 --> 13:37.980
Who knows?

13:37.980 --> 13:39.340
I guess we'll just wait and see.

13:39.340 --> 13:42.060
Well, this is good news as far as I'm concerned.

13:42.060 --> 13:47.100
It's good news in that they're not just leaving it to rot, they're putting it out there as

13:47.100 --> 13:52.340
its own corporation that can work to make its own money.

13:52.340 --> 13:56.560
And I set my dad up on Thunderbird years and years ago and he's just been slowly updating

13:56.560 --> 14:00.540
and using it and it's been working fine for him, but I've been kind of keeping an eye

14:00.540 --> 14:03.980
on alternatives in case Thunderbird goes away.

14:03.980 --> 14:07.500
But this kind of gives me confidence that it won't go away and I won't have to migrate

14:07.500 --> 14:08.500
him.

14:08.500 --> 14:09.500
I really like it too.

14:09.500 --> 14:13.580
I don't use it every single day, but just about every system I have that I do email

14:13.580 --> 14:16.220
on, I got Thunderbird on there doing something.

14:16.220 --> 14:19.840
We can put some of this into context when we look at their last year.

14:19.840 --> 14:24.220
In the last year, they hired six new employees, five engineers and a community manager, which

14:24.220 --> 14:29.980
really came in from what I can tell, primarily funded by donations, which seems to be the

14:29.980 --> 14:32.140
company's primary source of funding.

14:32.140 --> 14:38.580
Now that's not going to scale much wider than I would bet it is right now, unless they started

14:38.580 --> 14:42.660
taking on a lot of new users because a very small percentage of them might contribute.

14:42.660 --> 14:47.020
So I can see why they need to look for other revenue sources, but boy, is this going to

14:47.020 --> 14:51.700
be one of those things that the community will watch so closely with a lot of skepticism

14:51.700 --> 14:56.300
because email is one of those things people can be very sensitive about.

14:56.300 --> 15:01.380
And if you're in Thunderbird, there's a very, very high chance you're already sensitive

15:01.380 --> 15:05.580
to snooping from things like Gmail and Hotmail and all the other cloud emails that are reading

15:05.580 --> 15:06.580
your emails.

15:06.580 --> 15:07.580
Yeah.

15:07.580 --> 15:11.220
So let's hope that any of these commercial offerings will be optional.

15:11.220 --> 15:13.060
I would imagine they would be.

15:13.060 --> 15:16.480
You know, my read is that they know how to handle this kind of thing, that they know

15:16.480 --> 15:19.860
their audience and they know how to go about it.

15:19.860 --> 15:21.980
So I'm not overly concerned.

15:21.980 --> 15:23.660
Just a little more context.

15:23.660 --> 15:29.020
According to the data from Litmus Email Analytics, the Mozilla email client accounted for just

15:29.020 --> 15:34.540
0.5% of all email opened across devices in Q1 of 2019.

15:34.540 --> 15:39.460
However, that is up from 0.1% in Q2 of 2018.

15:39.460 --> 15:42.260
So they had a pretty good year in 2019.

15:42.260 --> 15:49.440
To put that in perspective, Apple is around 7.8% with their mail client and Outlook is

15:49.440 --> 15:53.620
only around 10%, just really around 9.2%.

15:53.620 --> 15:58.620
I'm surprised that's even that high given how popular webmail is these days.

15:58.620 --> 15:59.620
Yeah.

15:59.620 --> 16:00.620
Yeah.

16:00.620 --> 16:05.300
Outlook I thought would be a little higher because back in my corporate days, I literally

16:05.300 --> 16:08.260
saw people that spent their entire day in Outlook.

16:08.260 --> 16:14.380
It was on every corporate computer everywhere, although I bet a lot of them are just sending

16:14.380 --> 16:15.540
internally.

16:15.540 --> 16:19.740
And so when you're collecting analytics based on headers, you're only looking at emails

16:19.740 --> 16:21.340
that are sent externally.

16:21.340 --> 16:25.140
So maybe that Outlook figure is a little low, but you're right, it really does demonstrate

16:25.140 --> 16:29.460
the total massive dominance of webmail.

16:29.460 --> 16:30.460
It's crazy.

16:30.460 --> 16:34.580
Well, we have some news from IBM this week that shows quite how important Red Hat is

16:34.580 --> 16:36.460
to them these days.

16:36.460 --> 16:41.940
The current CEO, Ginni Rometty, is stepping down from the 108-year-old company.

16:41.940 --> 16:46.100
She's going to be replaced by IBM's senior vice president of cloud.

16:46.100 --> 16:53.700
And the same day, Jim Whitehurst, the CEO of Red Hat, will become president of IBM.

16:53.700 --> 17:00.500
Yeah, and Arvind Krishna, the new CEO, was pretty heavily involved in the Red Hat acquisition.

17:00.500 --> 17:05.820
So to put him in charge and then to have his number one be Jim Whitehurst, to me at least,

17:05.820 --> 17:09.700
says that the acquisition was pretty important to them.

17:09.700 --> 17:14.440
I remember when they acquired Red Hat, there was speculation about sort of an acquisition

17:14.440 --> 17:17.020
from within and having Jim run the company.

17:17.020 --> 17:21.100
And I suspect Red Hat employees are pretty happy with this move.

17:21.100 --> 17:26.060
And it was an unfounded speculation because you have to understand Ginni didn't necessarily

17:26.060 --> 17:29.780
oversee like a super successful run of the company.

17:29.780 --> 17:37.020
IBM experienced 22 consecutive quarters of sales declines under her leadership.

17:37.020 --> 17:38.140
That is pretty bad.

17:38.140 --> 17:44.060
Year over year sales dropped nearly 4% from 2018.

17:44.060 --> 17:49.900
And I suspect part of the Red Hat acquisition was an attempt to right that trend, but it

17:49.900 --> 17:50.900
was too late.

17:50.900 --> 17:55.500
Yeah, and the stock price hasn't exactly done well under Ginni, but I think she was kind

17:55.500 --> 18:01.220
of there at a big period of change in the whole industry.

18:01.220 --> 18:08.220
And to be fair to her, she did oversee that Red Hat acquisition and that hopefully for

18:08.220 --> 18:13.660
IBM will kind of drag them back into relevance and profitability.

18:13.660 --> 18:15.780
Yeah, I completely agree with that.

18:15.780 --> 18:19.720
I mean, maybe she had a certain set of market conditions that were changing and IBM was

18:19.720 --> 18:23.020
geared for one set and a transition needed to happen.

18:23.020 --> 18:27.500
Yeah, and a company of that size doesn't just turn on a sixpence, you know, it takes a long

18:27.500 --> 18:29.980
time to turn that ship around.

18:29.980 --> 18:32.540
And that's kind of what she's done here, isn't it?

18:32.540 --> 18:38.740
I wonder how involved Jim Whitehurst will be at Red Hat now, if he still is also running

18:38.740 --> 18:43.860
the show over there, if there's going to be promotions within Red Hat, I have a suspicion

18:43.860 --> 18:47.500
there will be another part of this story once this sort of settles down.

18:47.500 --> 18:50.460
And that'll be, what's the leadership story now at Red Hat?

18:50.460 --> 18:54.820
Yeah, it will be interesting to see that, but we probably won't find out before April,

18:54.820 --> 18:58.340
because that's when Krishna and Whitehurst are actually going to take up these new roles.

18:58.340 --> 19:02.980
Well, I haven't said this for a while, Google has something pretty cool for the open source

19:02.980 --> 19:03.980
community.

19:03.980 --> 19:04.980
It's OpenSK.

19:04.980 --> 19:10.260
Yeah, which is a fully open source security key implementation written in Rust.

19:10.260 --> 19:12.780
So that got you excited, I assume.

19:12.780 --> 19:17.860
Well, of course, and the fact that it supports the FIDO U2F and FIDO2 standards, but this

19:17.860 --> 19:19.460
is like a full stack they have here.

19:19.460 --> 19:25.060
The OpenSK research platform, as they put it, it's not only a software part, but they

19:25.060 --> 19:31.580
have the hardware bit and they even make available a custom 3D printable case so you can protect

19:31.580 --> 19:32.580
the key.

19:32.580 --> 19:34.420
I love this.

19:34.420 --> 19:37.100
You're right, the fact that it's written in Rust is kind of nice.

19:37.100 --> 19:43.380
Rust has strong memory protection, and it makes code generally less vulnerable to logical

19:43.380 --> 19:44.380
attacks.

19:44.380 --> 19:48.500
And they combine that with TalkOS, which has a sandboxed architecture.

19:48.500 --> 19:53.420
That's the little bit that runs on the key, which offers isolation between the security

19:53.420 --> 19:58.980
key applet itself, the drivers, the kernel, it's all completely isolated from each other.

19:58.980 --> 20:01.800
It's really kind of neat the way it does it.

20:01.800 --> 20:04.340
And they bring it all together into a complete package.

20:04.340 --> 20:07.740
They have a demo that we'll have linked in the show notes.

20:07.740 --> 20:11.860
And anybody that's thought about like a Yuba key kind of thing before, this is right up

20:11.860 --> 20:12.860
your alley.

20:12.860 --> 20:14.800
Yeah, this isn't kind of a finished product.

20:14.800 --> 20:18.260
This is more aimed at people who want to make a finished product out of it.

20:18.260 --> 20:21.560
Yeah, I mean, I think tinkers would be happy with it too, but you're right.

20:21.560 --> 20:24.080
This is a great starting point.

20:24.080 --> 20:27.740
And I was, funny enough, just before this announcement, I was thinking to myself, maybe

20:27.740 --> 20:30.660
I should get back into this again.

20:30.660 --> 20:34.800
When you have a Yuba key, it was really so nice, especially when you use it for SSH logins

20:34.800 --> 20:37.540
and laptop encryption keys and stuff like that.

20:37.540 --> 20:39.180
It's so great.

20:39.180 --> 20:44.100
So something that's an open standard like this that anybody could build, it's pretty

20:44.100 --> 20:45.100
good to see.

20:45.100 --> 20:46.100
Pretty good.

20:46.100 --> 20:49.060
And you can actually try this out right now if you've got a Nordic dongle.

20:49.060 --> 20:52.600
You can just flash this on there and get going straight away.

20:52.600 --> 20:55.000
So much going on every single week.
