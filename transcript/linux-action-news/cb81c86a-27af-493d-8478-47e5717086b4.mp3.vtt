00:00.000 --> 00:09.000
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, episode 203, recorded on August 22nd, 2021.

00:09.000 --> 00:10.000
I'm Chris.

00:10.000 --> 00:11.000
And I'm Wes.

00:11.000 --> 00:17.240
Hello, Wes, from a really warm, sunny, beautiful Parker, Colorado, just outside of Denver.

00:17.240 --> 00:18.240
Let's do the news.

00:18.240 --> 00:23.060
We wanted to start this week by giving you an idea of what's coming soon in the Linux

00:23.060 --> 00:24.960
desktop pipeline.

00:24.960 --> 00:30.960
It's been another busy week over at KDE, and developer Nate Graham has once again done a

00:30.960 --> 00:35.960
great job helping us wrap our heads around some of the more notable bits.

00:35.960 --> 00:39.960
I know the work on the new overview effect caught Chris's attention in particular.

00:39.960 --> 00:41.500
Indeed, this is looking really great.

00:41.500 --> 00:43.400
It's a new QML based overview effect.

00:43.400 --> 00:47.840
And Nate stresses in his post, this is still kind of early days, it's still going to need

00:47.840 --> 00:49.440
some testing.

00:49.440 --> 00:54.700
But the idea is to give you one spot that gives an overview of all the relevant window

00:54.700 --> 00:58.880
functionality similar to a third party kwin script that already exists called parachute

00:58.880 --> 01:02.880
and also somewhat similar to how Mac OS is mission control works today.

01:02.880 --> 01:04.760
It's going to ship in plasma 523.

01:04.760 --> 01:06.340
And they're going to want everybody to take a look at it.

01:06.340 --> 01:08.520
But this is the way they're going a new way to do this.

01:08.520 --> 01:10.760
And they'd like everybody to get some eyes on it.

01:10.760 --> 01:14.320
Also another feature that caught my attention that made me think, how did we not have this

01:14.320 --> 01:15.320
before?

01:15.320 --> 01:20.080
But now in KDE system settings, you can choose the status of your Bluetooth adapter at login.

01:20.080 --> 01:24.480
So if you want it to be powered on when you log in or powered off, perhaps or how about

01:24.480 --> 01:28.160
just whatever the last state was, that will now be an option you can control.

01:28.160 --> 01:32.720
And like nearly every recent release, work has gone into making the Wayland experience

01:32.720 --> 01:33.880
better.

01:33.880 --> 01:38.720
In the plasma Wayland session, middle click paste now works between native Wayland apps

01:38.720 --> 01:41.680
and those running under X Wayland.

01:41.680 --> 01:46.240
Among several other fixes, one I was happy to see is the resolution of at least one of

01:46.240 --> 01:49.780
the ways that the lock screen could get broken on Wayland.

01:49.780 --> 01:54.640
In a relatively new ongoing update series, Felix Hacker filled us in on the road to GNOME

01:54.640 --> 01:56.400
41.

01:56.400 --> 02:01.620
And speaking of new system settings, there's two new panels that have landed in GNOME.

02:01.620 --> 02:04.380
One is multitasking, and the other is cellular.

02:04.380 --> 02:08.340
The multitasking panel provides helpful functionality to improve your productivity when working

02:08.340 --> 02:11.080
with many apps at once with some nice options there.

02:11.080 --> 02:14.880
And the cellular panel allows you to configure various aspects of a mobile connection and

02:14.880 --> 02:16.440
a mobile modem.

02:16.440 --> 02:22.040
Many of the GNOME supporting apps are seeing updates land as well, including the podcast

02:22.040 --> 02:26.280
app for GNOME that now supports an episode description page where users can read the

02:26.280 --> 02:32.520
notes for an episode, fold titles of long episode names, and share the episode URL.

02:32.520 --> 02:36.400
And when many of us think of shipping the GNOME desktop, we think of Ubuntu, which normally

02:36.400 --> 02:41.440
ships with the latest GNOME desktop version that's generally released just before Ubuntu

02:41.440 --> 02:42.440
ships.

02:42.440 --> 02:48.400
But with Ubuntu 21.04, they ended up sticking with GNOME 3.38, rather than jumping on GNOME

02:48.400 --> 02:50.200
40 just as it was released.

02:50.200 --> 02:54.240
Now interestingly, Michael Larble over at Ferronix notes that he's been looking at

02:54.240 --> 02:58.800
the development track of Ubuntu 21.04, and it looks like they're going to opt to stick

02:58.800 --> 03:03.480
with GNOME 40 and not GNOME 41, which will be released by then.

03:03.480 --> 03:08.600
GNOME 41 will be out in September, as usual, with the latest and greatest from the half-year

03:08.600 --> 03:09.600
update.

03:09.600 --> 03:15.920
When asked about Ubuntu's GNOME version plans, Canonical's Sebastien Blachet wrote,

03:15.920 --> 03:21.760
Ideally, we would have updated to 41, but future freeze is today, and we didn't really

03:21.760 --> 03:24.880
have the resources available for the update.

03:24.880 --> 03:28.120
And while that's really a shame to see, it seems that maybe Canonical will cherry-pick

03:28.120 --> 03:33.120
a few features to backport to 40, and GNOME 41 is currently up to beta state right now.

03:33.120 --> 03:37.520
A release candidate is coming in early September, and the official GNOME 41 release is planned

03:37.520 --> 03:40.160
for September 22nd.

03:40.160 --> 03:47.320
Sticking with GTK, but shifting away from GNOME, after 18 months of development, Mate

03:47.320 --> 03:50.440
1.26 has been released.

03:50.440 --> 03:56.680
1.26 introduces Wayland support for Atrial, System Monitor, Pluma, Terminal, and a host

03:56.680 --> 03:58.960
of other desktop components.

03:58.960 --> 04:03.040
And an area that saw a lot of development that you might not expect at first pass is

04:03.040 --> 04:05.280
actually Mate's text editor Pluma.

04:05.280 --> 04:09.640
It was subject to massive improvements, and just a few of those are the new minimap that

04:09.640 --> 04:13.640
gives you an instant overview of a large dock, the new grid background pattern that turns

04:13.640 --> 04:17.520
Pluma into a writing pad, and of course the preference dialog that had to get pretty much

04:17.520 --> 04:19.840
reworked to accommodate a bunch of new features.

04:19.840 --> 04:23.560
I mean, they've really invested in Pluma this release cycle.

04:23.560 --> 04:28.900
The project seems pretty darn proud of this work, and notes in particular that together

04:28.900 --> 04:34.360
with the brand new Pluma plugins, the text editor can now be turned into a feature-rich

04:34.360 --> 04:39.360
IDE, with support for things like bracket completion, commenting and uncommenting of

04:39.360 --> 04:43.980
code blocks, a built-in terminal, and of course, autocomplete.

04:43.980 --> 04:48.960
And as always, but especially after 18 months, this really, really rings true.

04:48.960 --> 04:53.240
The project has just fixed a lot of bugs, some memory leaks, and has modernized the

04:53.240 --> 04:56.080
codebase of just about all of their desktop components.

04:56.080 --> 05:01.080
It really looks like Mate 1.26 is a banger release.

05:01.080 --> 05:07.520
Matrix, the open standard and protocol for real-time communication released six years

05:07.520 --> 05:14.640
ago, has many clients under active development, but one of the largest, Element, saw a significant

05:14.640 --> 05:25.440
update this week.

05:25.440 --> 05:29.560
On mobile, you can use the new voice message button two different ways.

05:29.560 --> 05:34.300
Either press and hold to instantly send a message, or drag the button up to lock the

05:34.300 --> 05:37.640
recorder on if you're sending a longer message and don't want to have to hold the button

05:37.640 --> 05:39.680
down the whole darn time.

05:39.680 --> 05:53.880
After that, you can review the message you've recorded before you send it off.

05:53.880 --> 06:07.640
And of course, it's easy to issue a quick reply.

06:07.640 --> 06:11.700
And probably worth noting here, the Element project said that this has been one of their

06:11.700 --> 06:23.120
oldest and most upvoted feature requests ever.

06:23.120 --> 06:28.880
And even better, when we dug into it, we were so pleased to see that they're using Opus

06:28.880 --> 06:33.160
wrapped in an Ogg container to actually send the audio bits around.

06:33.160 --> 06:38.080
It's so nice to see open source audio being used for what it's best at.

06:38.080 --> 06:42.340
And really, besides voice messages, a ton of improvements for voice and video calls

06:42.340 --> 06:44.040
have landed as well.

06:44.040 --> 06:48.560
If you've tried that stuff out in the past, now is definitely the time to give it another

06:48.560 --> 06:49.560
go.

06:49.560 --> 06:51.000
Yeah, it seems like a lot of underhood improvements.

06:51.000 --> 06:56.240
They said that they did a lot of rework to update to more current matrix specs that make

06:56.240 --> 06:58.400
VoIP calls a lot more robust.

06:58.400 --> 07:01.880
That was an aspect they sort of underlined and said, please give that a go if you haven't

07:01.880 --> 07:02.880
used that before.

07:02.880 --> 07:06.520
If you used it in the past and thought it didn't work great, try it again.

07:06.520 --> 07:11.000
They also just really cleaned up the chat timeline with just how images are displayed,

07:11.000 --> 07:17.480
how replies and read receipts are displayed, and the entire experience of the core chat

07:17.480 --> 07:18.480
has been improved.

07:18.480 --> 07:20.800
And when isn't that a big win in the chat application?

07:20.800 --> 07:25.280
So if you'd like to join our matrix server, head over to linuxunplug.com slash matrix

07:25.280 --> 07:27.640
and it'll send you there.

07:27.640 --> 07:33.140
And just a brief update on the Tenacity project, a community fork of Audacity with quite a

07:33.140 --> 07:35.240
bit of momentum.

07:35.240 --> 07:40.280
The developer has posted an update for distribution packagers that lets them know about some of

07:40.280 --> 07:45.760
the big changes to Tenacity's build system, what they might need to do for pipeline support,

07:45.760 --> 07:46.880
and a lot more.

07:46.880 --> 07:52.360
And buried in that post are some details that indicate ongoing work to update Tenacity's

07:52.360 --> 07:56.640
window toolkit, wxwidgets, to a newer version.

07:56.640 --> 08:02.440
The project's lead, called Bean, has also gone the extra mile by making sure the ecosystem

08:02.440 --> 08:07.760
of libraries around Tenacity are in good shape, effectively becoming the new upstream for

08:07.760 --> 08:09.120
some of them.

08:09.120 --> 08:14.200
And seems work is proceeding well, some of the hardest parts already tackled.

08:14.200 --> 08:18.800
But Bean notes the project is not yet ready to be packaged, there's still rebranding

08:18.800 --> 08:23.560
work to do to remove those Audacity trademarks.

08:23.560 --> 08:24.880
Linode.com slash LAN.

08:24.880 --> 08:29.320
Go there to get $100 in 60 day credit on a new account and you go there to support this

08:29.320 --> 08:30.320
show.

08:30.320 --> 08:34.400
This show is made possible by our sponsors like Linode.

08:34.400 --> 08:39.520
Linode is where we host pretty much everything now and definitely everything we've built

08:39.520 --> 08:41.320
in the last two and a half years.

08:41.320 --> 08:44.200
They started in 2003, so 18 years ago.

08:44.200 --> 08:48.120
I've known about them for a long time because I've seen them at community events, but I

08:48.120 --> 08:53.120
really got a new appreciation of what it's like to work with Linode as a business.

08:53.120 --> 08:56.720
Because you can use somebody's services, you can check out their website, but you don't

08:56.720 --> 09:01.380
get a sense of what they really are like internally until you've had an opportunity to do something

09:01.380 --> 09:04.560
like we just did, which was our Denver meetup.

09:04.560 --> 09:05.560
What an opportunity.

09:05.560 --> 09:08.820
I really am so grateful for Linode's support.

09:08.820 --> 09:10.640
They brought our community together.

09:10.640 --> 09:13.200
They created something special.

09:13.200 --> 09:17.480
We gave away a set of Raspberry Pis and it couldn't have worked out better because one

09:17.480 --> 09:24.320
of our first winners for the Raspberry Pis was Jose who flew in from Puerto Rico and

09:24.320 --> 09:28.860
Jose is working on accessibility for Linux.

09:28.860 --> 09:31.320
He's a blind developer himself.

09:31.320 --> 09:36.480
He flew by himself from Puerto Rico to our meetup and he was the first winner of the

09:36.480 --> 09:39.040
Raspberry Pi giveaway kit that Linode did.

09:39.040 --> 09:45.240
It just made that moment so perfect and it was really special.

09:45.240 --> 09:47.880
That wouldn't have happened without Linode's support.

09:47.880 --> 09:51.320
On top of just being a great company with great people inside it, they've got Linux

09:51.320 --> 09:55.580
geeks in there that have built an awesome product because they knew where Linux was

09:55.580 --> 10:01.440
going back in 2003 and they thought, jeez, instead of racking a server for every Apache

10:01.440 --> 10:06.200
box, we could start using this user mode Linux stuff that's going towards virtualization

10:06.200 --> 10:10.960
and actually create multiple Linux servers on one host.

10:10.960 --> 10:13.480
That was their big breakthrough back in the day.

10:13.480 --> 10:16.820
They were first in this and now they're doing it the best.

10:16.820 --> 10:18.600
They're still independently owned.

10:18.600 --> 10:20.880
They have 11 data centers around the world.

10:20.880 --> 10:25.800
They are their own ISP so the interlinks between their data centers are crazy fast.

10:25.800 --> 10:29.400
We use the heck out of their S3 compatible object storage.

10:29.400 --> 10:30.600
You can as well.

10:30.600 --> 10:34.160
They're currently testing out bare metal boxes just because sometimes that's the way you

10:34.160 --> 10:35.160
got to go.

10:35.160 --> 10:41.680
DDoS protection, VLAN support, a powerful DNS manager, that's all in there as well.

10:41.680 --> 10:46.520
With pricing 30 to 50% cheaper than other major cloud providers and the fact that you

10:46.520 --> 10:52.280
can support Linux action news by going to linode.com slash land, I mean, it seems like

10:52.280 --> 10:53.280
a great opportunity.

10:53.280 --> 10:57.680
Even if you just wanted to try something out, deploy something, compare it to another provider

10:57.680 --> 11:01.360
or maybe learn something, they have a bunch of tutorials that can help you do that and

11:01.360 --> 11:04.480
they also have a marketplace of applications.

11:04.480 --> 11:09.160
While I don't generally tend to deploy the entire application stack with the eventual

11:09.160 --> 11:15.520
application installed, I do tend to deploy their base stacks with the correct repos for

11:15.520 --> 11:19.440
whatever I might be using, generally Docker, because you can click that and get that going

11:19.440 --> 11:23.200
in no time and then you just jump in, make sure everything's up to date, it usually is,

11:23.200 --> 11:30.700
and the other nice thing is Linode has a mirror of the distro repos packages so you're updating

11:30.700 --> 11:35.640
over Linode's crazy fast LAN and then their boxes are super fast and the SSDs are super

11:35.640 --> 11:40.480
fast so it's a blast updating your boxes on Linode.

11:40.480 --> 11:44.720
And if you ever get stuck, they have the best customer support by phone, by ticket, however

11:44.720 --> 11:49.680
you like to do it, they'll hook you up with great, great customer support.

11:49.680 --> 11:53.240
Linode is dedicated to offering the very best in virtualized cloud computing.

11:53.240 --> 11:56.200
If it runs on Linux, it'll run on Linode.

11:56.200 --> 12:02.280
To go sign up today and support the show, linode.com slash lan.

12:02.280 --> 12:07.500
Linux action news is also brought to you by Ting and if you're sick of overpaying for

12:07.500 --> 12:13.800
cell service, go see how much you could save and then take 25 bucks off that at linux.ting.com.

12:13.800 --> 12:16.600
Ting is an MBNO or a mobile virtual network operator.

12:16.600 --> 12:22.440
That means they're not digging big holes and installing towers and arguing with local governments.

12:22.440 --> 12:23.920
They don't have to focus on that stuff.

12:23.920 --> 12:28.520
Instead, they can focus on making a great value for their customers and great customer

12:28.520 --> 12:29.520
service.

12:29.520 --> 12:33.720
With Ting Mobile, you get the same coast-to-coast coverage as you would with all the big networks.

12:33.720 --> 12:35.640
You just pay less for it.

12:35.640 --> 12:42.360
That's why I've been a Ting customer since 2013 and on this road trip, I've had an opportunity

12:42.360 --> 12:47.300
to chat with customers of Ting that have listened to our show and signed up for Ting and one

12:47.300 --> 12:52.600
of the use cases that I never really considered because I'm always traveling by land is people

12:52.600 --> 12:56.720
who fly into a certain area love to use Ting for when they're traveling.

12:56.720 --> 12:59.840
So a common one was people who come in from out of country.

12:59.840 --> 13:03.360
They can have a Ting SIM in the United States, but also people who are just traveling out

13:03.360 --> 13:07.960
of their area and want to pick something that is better in that area that they're traveling

13:07.960 --> 13:12.400
to because with Ting, you have multiple networks and if you work with their support, you can

13:12.400 --> 13:17.520
get the right SIM card so you end up getting the best type of coverage for your area and

13:17.520 --> 13:21.960
they have really easy plans and simple to understand that make it a great value for

13:21.960 --> 13:26.680
using Ting like that, but they also have plans that just work great for families.

13:26.680 --> 13:30.880
If you just sync your music and you sync your podcast before you get started, it'll blow

13:30.880 --> 13:31.880
your mind.

13:31.880 --> 13:35.880
The kind of savings you can get compared to like the big duopolies, like the kind of service

13:35.880 --> 13:37.280
you might get with a big duopoly.

13:37.280 --> 13:42.760
You're probably going to be paying on a family plan like, I don't know, over $130 where with

13:42.760 --> 13:44.920
Ting, they have like the set 12 plan.

13:44.920 --> 13:47.920
You get 12 gigs of data and unlimited talk and text.

13:47.920 --> 13:52.160
So the stuff that really matters and that's $35 a month.

13:52.160 --> 13:56.800
So it's like a hundred dollars less a month and it's really easy to add lines as you need

13:56.800 --> 13:58.800
it and you can pool that data.

13:58.800 --> 14:04.040
So it's just really worth looking at if you just use a little bit of outside the box thinking

14:04.040 --> 14:07.480
when it comes to mobile, two gigs, 20 gigs or even more, there's going to be a Ting plan

14:07.480 --> 14:08.480
for you.

14:08.480 --> 14:12.040
So go get clever and then you get access to Ting's award-winning customer service when

14:12.040 --> 14:18.980
you sign up, their nationwide LTE and 5G coverage and the best part is no contracts ever.

14:18.980 --> 14:22.760
And it's funny, I've been a customer since 2013 and I think ironically, one of the reasons

14:22.760 --> 14:25.240
I stick around is because there is no contract.

14:25.240 --> 14:28.600
There's no like agreement as the carriers call it now.

14:28.600 --> 14:31.840
They don't like calling it contracts, no, no, but they call it agreement and there's

14:31.840 --> 14:34.640
no agreement like looming over my head.

14:34.640 --> 14:41.000
It's clean, it's straightforward, it's simple and you can get started by going to linux.ting.com.

14:41.000 --> 14:44.600
Go check your current phone, create an account, pick the plan that's right for you.

14:44.600 --> 14:47.600
Ting will send you a SIM, you pop it in, you're up and going in minutes.

14:47.600 --> 14:49.600
The next generation of Ting mobile is here.

14:49.600 --> 14:54.960
So go see how much you could save and then take 25 bucks off that.

14:54.960 --> 14:56.820
Linux.ting.com.

14:56.820 --> 15:02.040
This past week, we had the absolute privilege of spending some time at the System76 factory

15:02.040 --> 15:05.040
in Denver, Colorado.

15:05.040 --> 15:09.600
During our time there, we had a chance to chat with founder and CEO, Carl Rochelle.

15:09.600 --> 15:15.520
The entire chat was featured in Linux Unplugged 4.19, but there was a bit where Carl made

15:15.520 --> 15:16.520
some news.

15:16.520 --> 15:18.540
Yeah, it's a bit of exclusive information.

15:18.540 --> 15:20.480
So we wanted to let you know about it here.

15:20.480 --> 15:26.440
I asked Carl if we were ever going to see a $100 version of their customizable open

15:26.440 --> 15:27.840
launch keyboard.

15:27.840 --> 15:32.800
And that got us chatting about the roadmap in general for the launch.

15:32.800 --> 15:38.440
And Carl, like an open book that he is, shared some never released details about their future

15:38.440 --> 15:39.440
plans.

15:39.440 --> 15:40.560
There is a roadmap for launch.

15:40.560 --> 15:43.560
It just doesn't go down to $100.

15:43.560 --> 15:49.320
I don't think that we can build a product that we would be proud of that fits with the

15:49.320 --> 15:51.800
design and the characteristics of launch itself.

15:51.800 --> 15:55.840
We don't want the quality to be any lower, but there are things that we can do to bring

15:55.840 --> 15:57.880
the price down for another model.

15:57.880 --> 16:02.440
So the launch roadmap includes a model that's going to have a 10 key numpad.

16:02.440 --> 16:07.520
So that'll be coming, I think, both of these are probably first half next year.

16:07.520 --> 16:12.800
So a 10 key, we've got to get our production up and running and caught up, but the 10 key.

16:12.800 --> 16:20.080
And then another smaller, I believe it's 67 key, which is going to remove the F row.

16:20.080 --> 16:23.880
So you'd hit the function row underneath the function key with one, two, three and

16:23.880 --> 16:24.880
so forth.

16:24.880 --> 16:25.880
So an even smaller footprint.

16:25.880 --> 16:27.280
Right, an even smaller one.

16:27.280 --> 16:28.560
So that cuts out a bunch of switches.

16:28.560 --> 16:30.140
We're also going to remove the hub from that.

16:30.140 --> 16:33.280
And my hope is we can get that to $199.

16:33.280 --> 16:39.000
Besides future keyboard plans, Carl was also pretty open about their ambitions to build

16:39.000 --> 16:40.760
a laptop.

16:40.760 --> 16:45.000
A topic we'll have some information on sometime soon.

16:45.000 --> 16:50.840
And really, it just seems like System76 is in a great location for what they're doing.

16:50.840 --> 16:54.600
I was blown away by the number of Denver locals who showed up at our meetup.

16:54.600 --> 16:58.720
I mean, everyone from new Linux users who had just found the shows to folks who've

16:58.720 --> 17:03.360
been doing software development on Linux for way longer than they would ever like me to

17:03.360 --> 17:04.960
say on air.

17:04.960 --> 17:09.280
The Linux tech scene in general was impressive in Denver, I think way more than either of

17:09.280 --> 17:10.280
us were expecting.

17:10.280 --> 17:12.320
Yeah, I would agree with that.

17:12.320 --> 17:16.560
I don't know what I was expecting going into it exactly.

17:16.560 --> 17:20.200
But like you mentioned, there was some folks there that were just learning Linux, and they

17:20.200 --> 17:23.720
had just traveled to the area and got Linux jobs.

17:23.720 --> 17:25.720
And then there was folks have been there for a long time.

17:25.720 --> 17:28.680
And it was a good mix of like just arrived, the tech scene is growing.

17:28.680 --> 17:33.400
It seems like it's on a heck of a trajectory, I think we're gonna have to return someday.

17:33.400 --> 17:37.640
And I think there's going to be a lot of development out there with all of those people getting

17:37.640 --> 17:38.640
these Linux jobs.

17:38.640 --> 17:43.160
