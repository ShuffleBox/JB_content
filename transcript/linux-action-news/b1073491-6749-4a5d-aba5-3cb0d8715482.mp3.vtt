00:00.000 --> 00:08.840
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, episode 140, recorded on January 12th, 2020.

00:08.840 --> 00:09.840
I'm Chris.

00:09.840 --> 00:10.840
And I'm Joe.

00:10.840 --> 00:11.840
Hello, Joe.

00:11.840 --> 00:13.400
Good to be connected with you.

00:13.400 --> 00:16.560
And we start things out with a pretty high-profile exit.

00:16.560 --> 00:20.880
Yeah, Bruce Perens has quit the OSI, the open source initiative.

00:20.880 --> 00:23.960
He was one of the original founders of that.

00:23.960 --> 00:26.520
And he's not happy with how things have been going there.

00:26.520 --> 00:31.020
It seems like the crux of this issue stems back to a license that was drafted about a

00:31.020 --> 00:36.160
year ago, called the Cryptographic Autonomy License, or the CAL.

00:36.160 --> 00:40.400
And it was on the behalf of a distributed software platform called Holo.

00:40.400 --> 00:45.600
This was submitted to the open source initiative for approval as a open source definition compliant

00:45.600 --> 00:46.800
license.

00:46.800 --> 00:51.700
And that's where the debate begins, and is ultimately left to the co-founder Bruce Perens

00:51.700 --> 00:53.680
resigning and leaving the organization.

00:53.680 --> 00:58.160
Yeah, not doing it quietly either, throwing around terms like stuffing the ballot box.

00:58.160 --> 01:03.360
Yeah, there's a lot of history here, it seems, and different interpretations of events depending

01:03.360 --> 01:04.360
on who you talk to.

01:04.360 --> 01:07.800
And full credit to The Register, we'll have a link to their article.

01:07.800 --> 01:13.560
They sourced as many individuals in the story as they could to try to get the broadest picture

01:13.560 --> 01:14.780
possible.

01:14.780 --> 01:19.100
It seems like from Bruce's standpoint, he felt the organization was heading towards

01:19.100 --> 01:26.240
accepting a license that didn't respect freedom fully, and maybe even more importantly, contributed

01:26.240 --> 01:32.600
to like an abundance of free software licenses, an overabundance of free software licenses

01:32.600 --> 01:35.560
that could be leading to confusion for developers.

01:35.560 --> 01:39.200
Yeah, he sees it as proliferation of software licenses.

01:39.200 --> 01:45.720
And he told The Register that he believes only three licenses are necessary, the AGPLv3,

01:45.720 --> 01:52.200
and Apache v2, which would certainly simplify things, I think, a little bit too much.

01:52.200 --> 01:53.800
But I do get where he's coming from.

01:53.800 --> 01:56.400
There are way too many software licenses.

01:56.400 --> 01:57.840
Yeah, I kind of agree.

01:57.840 --> 02:01.280
I mean, those maybe are not enough, the ones he's outlined.

02:01.280 --> 02:06.640
But his point is that it's harmful to the community to have too many because it creates

02:06.640 --> 02:11.900
a legal burden for developers where they have to consult a lawyer to ship software.

02:11.900 --> 02:13.520
That might sound extreme.

02:13.520 --> 02:19.920
However, that was a ongoing point of conversation in the Coder Radio podcast about that very

02:19.920 --> 02:20.920
issue.

02:20.920 --> 02:24.860
And it really is something developers have to struggle with, especially if it contributes

02:24.860 --> 02:26.240
to their bottom line.

02:26.240 --> 02:31.000
He's also quoted by The Register saying, most people who develop open source don't have

02:31.000 --> 02:33.480
access to lawyers.

02:33.480 --> 02:40.200
One of the goals for open source was you could use it without having to hire a lawyer.

02:40.200 --> 02:44.960
You could put open source software on your computer and run it.

02:44.960 --> 02:50.480
And if you don't redistribute or modify it, you don't really have to read the license.

02:50.480 --> 02:56.180
His main contention here around this cryptographic license, this new one that led to this resignation,

02:56.180 --> 03:00.440
is that that license has language around how user data is handled.

03:00.440 --> 03:05.800
And it specifically puts a burden on the user of the licensed software to make certain kinds

03:05.800 --> 03:09.680
of data available to users on demand.

03:09.680 --> 03:12.920
It's sort of a GDPR inspired type license.

03:12.920 --> 03:15.180
And there's a pretty solid argument for that.

03:15.180 --> 03:21.320
But Bruce's core point is you can't expect a single developer or a couple of developers

03:21.320 --> 03:26.940
that are working on a project to be able to necessarily always abide by this certain provision.

03:26.940 --> 03:28.480
It restricts freedom.

03:28.480 --> 03:30.160
But the software landscape is changing.

03:30.160 --> 03:34.160
And what we're talking about with the Cal license is a different type of software that

03:34.160 --> 03:36.720
is distributed, that is peer to peer.

03:36.720 --> 03:40.040
And arguably, you do need a new license for that.

03:40.040 --> 03:41.520
Yeah, that's the thing.

03:41.520 --> 03:44.960
I completely agree that there's too many licenses.

03:44.960 --> 03:52.340
At the same time, it kind of seems like there is a need for a license exactly like this.

03:52.340 --> 03:56.480
And that's most likely the argument you could make for every single one of those licenses

03:56.480 --> 03:57.920
that's out there.

03:57.920 --> 04:02.360
And so then I start to think, well, is it the end of the world for the developer to

04:02.360 --> 04:07.160
have to do a little research before they try to make their income on an application?

04:07.160 --> 04:08.160
I don't think it is.

04:08.160 --> 04:14.100
I think enough of the world has bended to the laziness of developers that maybe on this

04:14.100 --> 04:18.280
one thing, they could be asked to spend a day or two googling.

04:18.280 --> 04:23.600
But imagine if we only had the three licenses that he talks about, we'd have no issues with

04:23.600 --> 04:24.600
ZFS.

04:24.600 --> 04:27.080
It would have already been on all the test shows.

04:27.080 --> 04:29.360
Man, that's a utopia, isn't it?

04:29.360 --> 04:33.880
When you think about it, and you could just keep it all in your head, all of the differences

04:33.880 --> 04:36.880
and the requirements, you could just keep it all in your head.

04:36.880 --> 04:38.760
It really would be nice.

04:38.760 --> 04:44.920
Doesn't seem practical, especially with things like blockchain and peer-to-peer software.

04:44.920 --> 04:50.360
It does seem like things change and you need software licenses to adapt to the new realities.

04:50.360 --> 04:55.000
But it would be nice to consolidate some of the existing licenses and maybe trim some

04:55.000 --> 04:56.000
of that fat.

04:56.000 --> 04:58.840
But then you've got a lot of software out there that's already licensed with them.

04:58.840 --> 05:01.000
So it's not an easy thing to do.

05:01.000 --> 05:02.000
Yeah, fair point.

05:02.000 --> 05:05.600
Well, let's transition to something that's apparently almost impossible to do, and that's

05:05.600 --> 05:10.920
to go pure system D for Debian, because we have results on their init system diversity

05:10.920 --> 05:11.920
vote.

05:11.920 --> 05:19.000
Yeah, after quite a complex and seemingly fair voting process, they went for proposal

05:19.000 --> 05:24.300
B, which is system D, but we support exploring alternatives.

05:24.300 --> 05:29.040
So pretty much where they were before this whole vote thing.

05:29.040 --> 05:30.040
No one wins.

05:30.040 --> 05:31.600
Well, I don't know.

05:31.600 --> 05:36.520
Here's the language of proposal B that I think matters, quote, the Debian project recognizes

05:36.520 --> 05:41.340
that system D service units are preferred configuration for describing how to start

05:41.340 --> 05:42.680
a service.

05:42.680 --> 05:47.000
However, Debian remains an environment where developers can use and explore and develop

05:47.000 --> 05:51.360
alternate init systems and alternatives to system D features.

05:51.360 --> 05:53.480
Now here's the key line.

05:53.480 --> 05:59.000
Those interested in exploring such alternatives need to provide the necessary development

05:59.000 --> 06:02.420
and packaging resources to do that work.

06:02.420 --> 06:08.080
Later on, they write packages should include service units or init scripts to start daemons

06:08.080 --> 06:09.880
and services.

06:09.880 --> 06:15.560
Packages may use system D's facilities at a package maintainer's discretion, provided

06:15.560 --> 06:18.520
it's consistent with other policy requirements.

06:18.520 --> 06:22.120
This sounds like they're codifying the way things kind of have been.

06:22.120 --> 06:29.000
With the exception, the kind of give I see here is as a project, we will make space for

06:29.000 --> 06:34.320
alternatives if people show up to do the work, we have now made a policy to make space for

06:34.320 --> 06:35.320
you.

06:35.320 --> 06:36.320
Is that how you read it?

06:36.320 --> 06:37.600
Yeah, I think so.

06:37.600 --> 06:43.900
And it seems like quite a kind of roundabout way of not ultimately supporting much more

06:43.900 --> 06:49.560
than system D. You're putting in the policy to say, if you want to do it, have at it,

06:49.560 --> 06:52.760
but realistically, is anyone going to do that?

06:52.760 --> 06:53.760
Probably not.

06:53.760 --> 06:58.920
So it's kind of a win for system D only, which, how I read the original proposals from Sam

06:58.920 --> 07:03.120
Hartman, the Debian project lead, it feels like that's the direction that he wanted to

07:03.120 --> 07:10.640
go with it, to just double down on system D and just finally end that debate.

07:10.640 --> 07:15.640
Whereas this is keeping the door open, but I think you're not going to have that many

07:15.640 --> 07:20.200
people who really step up and provide those development resources.

07:20.200 --> 07:26.000
Yeah, this does kind of seem like not enough for either side.

07:26.000 --> 07:30.240
But imagine for a moment, if we could just snap our fingers and say all of the folks

07:30.240 --> 07:34.800
from the dev one community come back over to Debian and just put all of your efforts

07:34.800 --> 07:37.560
in maintaining the alternative packages.

07:37.560 --> 07:42.320
Now Debian has codified room for them, like that they would make space for them.

07:42.320 --> 07:46.500
Obviously this is sort of saying, show up and do the work and we'll make space, otherwise

07:46.500 --> 07:50.800
we're going to continue on for system D.

07:50.800 --> 07:58.440
But not firmly, like as somebody like myself, what I see here is perhaps a vulnerability

07:58.440 --> 08:03.800
in the design of an open source community, where they can't just take decisive action,

08:03.800 --> 08:07.720
whatever it might be, and then strike forward and build an innovative product on top of

08:07.720 --> 08:08.720
that.

08:08.720 --> 08:13.720
However, the bigger picture version of the Linux landscape tells me that this is precisely

08:13.720 --> 08:21.560
what Debian is for and derivatives, especially popular ones like Ubuntu can take decisive

08:21.560 --> 08:27.400
action with upstart or system D. And that's really where they can add a lot of value.

08:27.400 --> 08:32.480
And it's sort of perfect if you look at the overall landscape of Linux, that some distribution

08:32.480 --> 08:37.840
is thinking very deeply about this question because it is supremely important.

08:37.840 --> 08:42.800
It is probably one of the most important components of a Linux system right now.

08:42.800 --> 08:47.880
And so thinking about this matters and I don't really know where else you can allow space

08:47.880 --> 08:50.080
for it other than in Debian.

08:50.080 --> 08:56.240
I mean, there's projects like Gentoo and others that add tremendous value, but Debian's at

08:56.240 --> 08:59.880
a scale where it really actually kind of matters too.

08:59.880 --> 09:01.040
That's what I think is terrific here.

09:01.040 --> 09:04.440
Well, it's interesting that you talk about Debian and Ubuntu.

09:04.440 --> 09:09.720
Ubuntu has been around for 27 years, let's say 30, round it up.

09:09.720 --> 09:13.340
What's more likely to still be around in 30 years, Debian or Ubuntu?

09:13.340 --> 09:15.300
I'd say both.

09:15.300 --> 09:21.760
At this point, there will still be Ubuntu systems in production in 30 years.

09:21.760 --> 09:25.600
They may be running old releases, but they'll absolutely still be running because that's

09:25.600 --> 09:28.800
just the way those kinds of things work.

09:28.800 --> 09:34.480
I wonder, boy Joe, if we could go on the record now and then check in on a 30-year production,

09:34.480 --> 09:36.480
that would really be something.

09:36.480 --> 09:41.800
No, I think they probably will both still be around, but just serving different needs

09:41.800 --> 09:42.800
really.

09:42.800 --> 09:49.680
And I think Debian, although it does have something of a flaw in that there's no dictator,

09:49.680 --> 09:55.120
that's also what's good about it and why it will ultimately probably keep going indefinitely.

09:55.120 --> 10:00.320
Yeah, I think you'll have Debian, you'll have Red Hat, and they'll all be dynamic environments

10:00.320 --> 10:03.040
you can spin up on your Fuchsia system in seconds.

10:03.040 --> 10:04.600
Probably, yeah.

10:04.600 --> 10:10.480
They'll end up being a Fuchsia version of Debian, like with the herd.

10:10.480 --> 10:12.080
It's just one of the user land environments.

10:12.080 --> 10:13.280
Oh, you want one of those apps?

10:13.280 --> 10:14.600
Yeah, sure, no problem.

10:14.600 --> 10:15.600
Fuchsia supports that.

10:15.600 --> 10:20.240
Well, before we get to that Fuchsia future, we've still got Android.

10:20.240 --> 10:24.920
And something we reported on last year was the search engine ballot, where if you buy

10:24.920 --> 10:29.480
an Android phone in Europe, the first time you turn it on, it's going to give you a selection

10:29.480 --> 10:32.520
screen of which search provider you want to use.

10:32.520 --> 10:35.380
And now we know what those search providers are going to be.

10:35.380 --> 10:37.120
This is so Google.

10:37.120 --> 10:38.120
It's so beautiful.

10:38.120 --> 10:43.040
Google is profiting at the expense of competition because they've managed to turn this thing

10:43.040 --> 10:44.500
into an auction.

10:44.500 --> 10:49.640
So the search engines that are shown to users will vary for each EU country with the selection

10:49.640 --> 10:55.160
screen described as a fourth price auction system.

10:55.160 --> 10:59.520
Each provider tells Google how much it's willing to pay the company every time a user selects

10:59.520 --> 11:01.520
their product as the default.

11:01.520 --> 11:04.520
So when you select DuckDuckGo, they pay out a little bit.

11:04.520 --> 11:09.120
The three highest bidders are then shown to users with the chosen provider paying Google

11:09.120 --> 11:12.360
the amount offered by the fourth highest bid.

11:12.360 --> 11:15.880
The process is then repeated every four months.

11:15.880 --> 11:21.400
Well, apparently Microsoft didn't really feel like playing game in a lot of these different

11:21.400 --> 11:22.660
EU countries.

11:22.660 --> 11:25.160
And so they're at the bottom of the list.

11:25.160 --> 11:28.240
I think they're only in one market.

11:28.240 --> 11:30.200
And it's a bunch of search engines I've never heard of.

11:30.200 --> 11:31.760
The whole thing seems kind of a mess.

11:31.760 --> 11:37.760
Yeah, this is very much Google obeying the letter of the EU law and not the spirit of

11:37.760 --> 11:40.640
it, as you say, profiting from it.

11:40.640 --> 11:43.040
And DuckDuckGo are not very happy about it.

11:43.040 --> 11:47.120
Even though they're having to pay, they're still doing it begrudgingly.

11:47.120 --> 11:52.840
And it really is cheeky of Google to have done this, I think, but they obviously think

11:52.840 --> 11:53.840
they can get away with it.

11:53.840 --> 11:54.840
Yeah, well, they are.

11:54.840 --> 11:55.840
They are.

11:55.840 --> 12:00.760
It's so Google, if this is if you followed Google as a company, and if you've read Into

12:00.760 --> 12:07.520
the Plex, this is so in Google's wheelhouse, this whole auction system, and they can then

12:07.520 --> 12:11.680
claim it's fair market prices and not Google setting the price.

12:11.680 --> 12:14.320
It's how they also run AdWords.

12:14.320 --> 12:17.760
That's all auction based as well and YouTube ads, all that's auction based.

12:17.760 --> 12:21.560
Yeah, it's almost like they're treating this selection as an advert, which it kind of is

12:21.560 --> 12:22.560
really.

12:22.560 --> 12:23.560
Well, it is.

12:23.560 --> 12:28.560
It's their software platform that's in front of users that is placing other companies that

12:28.560 --> 12:30.160
compete with them.

12:30.160 --> 12:33.720
Now, they were supposed to do it because they're a monopoly and they've figured out a way to

12:33.720 --> 12:35.240
make money from it.

12:35.240 --> 12:40.120
But it is probably some of the most valuable real estate you could buy as one of these

12:40.120 --> 12:43.240
companies because it sets everything to that as the default.

12:43.240 --> 12:47.840
Well, arguably, one of the other prime bits of real estate on an Android phone are the

12:47.840 --> 12:49.720
pre-installed apps.

12:49.720 --> 12:55.760
And if you get a cheap government subsidized phone in the US, then you might be getting

12:55.760 --> 12:58.240
some nasty ones pre-installed.

12:58.240 --> 12:59.680
This is shameful.

12:59.680 --> 13:01.840
This is a story I would expect out of China.

13:01.840 --> 13:04.920
And in fact, some of the software has ties to China.

13:04.920 --> 13:09.000
But these are phones that have been subsidized by the US government.

13:09.000 --> 13:13.560
Some of them are called Obama phones as a bit of a joke because they were launched in

13:13.560 --> 13:14.560
2008.

13:14.560 --> 13:17.560
Well, it was expanded in 2008, really.

13:17.560 --> 13:26.940
And it's a low end UMX U686CL phone provided by the Virgin Mobile Assurance Wireless program.

13:26.940 --> 13:30.720
The upside is you get an Android phone for $35.

13:30.720 --> 13:38.400
The downside is it's loaded with not one, but two different kinds of horrible software,

13:38.400 --> 13:42.920
including a fake auto update system that installs ads.

13:42.920 --> 13:44.080
It's shameful.

13:44.080 --> 13:49.120
And it's fundamentally one of the core issues I have with the Android platform.

13:49.120 --> 13:50.200
Is it scale?

13:50.200 --> 13:52.320
It's used to abuse users.

13:52.320 --> 13:54.760
And Malwarebytes are calling it malware.

13:54.760 --> 13:57.120
Well, they would, wouldn't they?

13:57.120 --> 14:04.140
I am hesitant to say that myself because Virgin have come out and said specifically that they

14:04.140 --> 14:06.180
don't consider it to be malware.

14:06.180 --> 14:10.400
So I think it's left up to the reader and listener to decide.

14:10.400 --> 14:14.560
But either way, it's apps that most people are not going to want on their phones.

14:14.560 --> 14:18.280
I mean, of course, they're going to say that the moment you log into the mobile device,

14:18.280 --> 14:24.000
the quote unquote wireless update app starts auto installing crap.

14:24.000 --> 14:27.360
And it's stuff that doesn't take any user consent.

14:27.360 --> 14:29.360
There's no agree to do any of this.

14:29.360 --> 14:31.400
There's no OK.

14:31.400 --> 14:37.500
And once it's loaded, it's an app variant of ad ups, which is from a Chinese based company

14:37.500 --> 14:43.320
that just loads your Android device up with ads on the home screen, in the notifications

14:43.320 --> 14:45.600
app, it overrides apps and websites.

14:45.600 --> 14:47.520
It's extremely aggressive.

14:47.520 --> 14:50.280
And a lot of it does location tracking, too.

14:50.280 --> 14:53.120
And it just starts installing the moment you install it.

14:53.120 --> 14:58.380
And there are so many other instances of these low cost Android phones from a variety of

14:58.380 --> 15:01.600
different providers and manufacturer that do this.

15:01.600 --> 15:06.320
Blue, BLU, is one of the most infamous, where they installed a powerful backdoor and a root

15:06.320 --> 15:12.480
kit and downloaders on 26 different phone models from various manufacturers that white

15:12.480 --> 15:16.760
labeled their devices that were sold by mainstream carriers.

15:16.760 --> 15:21.180
Android at the low end is user hostile.

15:21.180 --> 15:27.160
And it's so upsetting to see Linux used this way to abuse the users.

15:27.160 --> 15:30.040
It doesn't empower the users, it abuses them.

15:30.040 --> 15:35.960
And honestly, people would be better buying used iPhones off of eBay than they would be

15:35.960 --> 15:38.360
getting these $35 Android devices.

15:38.360 --> 15:45.360
And that's so awful to have to say on a Linux podcast that Apple with their iOS devices

15:45.360 --> 15:51.440
that you could buy used on eBay is a safer route to go if you're a consumer looking for

15:51.440 --> 15:58.040
a cheap device than a phone you could go into a Virgin store or Verizon and buy directly.

15:58.040 --> 15:59.040
It's mind boggling.

15:59.040 --> 16:03.640
Yeah, arguably, you could say go down the lineage route, but for most consumers, that's

16:03.640 --> 16:04.640
just not an option.

16:04.640 --> 16:06.760
They don't have the technical skills to do that.

16:06.760 --> 16:09.340
It's not even in the realm of possibility for them.

16:09.340 --> 16:15.160
Not only are they barely even aware of a concept of an operating system, but the idea to reload

16:15.160 --> 16:20.240
it is so far above and beyond their capabilities in terms of research or connecting to the

16:20.240 --> 16:24.920
computer or even conceptualizing the idea of an operating system in an image file.

16:24.920 --> 16:26.480
It's so far beyond them.

16:26.480 --> 16:27.960
It's not even a possibility.

16:27.960 --> 16:30.840
And that's why I say for them, it's got to be iOS.

16:30.840 --> 16:34.680
Now for savvy users, people that listen to this podcast that could go buy a used Android

16:34.680 --> 16:37.240
device and reload it with Linux, yeah, sure, go for it.

16:37.240 --> 16:38.740
But lineage on there, have at it.

16:38.740 --> 16:39.740
It's going to be great.

16:39.740 --> 16:43.840
But you can't expect people that are buying these subsidized devices to know how to do

16:43.840 --> 16:44.840
that.

16:44.840 --> 16:49.120
I mean, they're struggling with just basic malware on their phones now.

16:49.120 --> 16:53.520
It really, it just has for years, Joe, it's just really upset me to see Linux abused like

16:53.520 --> 16:54.520
this through Android.

16:54.520 --> 16:58.720
Like it's, it's great that Linux is in so many pockets.

16:58.720 --> 17:03.700
And it's great that it's brought so many OEMs into contributing to the Linux kernel.

17:03.700 --> 17:06.200
But there has been a human cost.

17:06.200 --> 17:07.880
And it's this kind of stuff.

17:07.880 --> 17:09.920
And it's even worse in other countries.

17:09.920 --> 17:14.520
Yeah, and Google could put a stop to this, at least with devices that they're certifying

17:14.520 --> 17:18.620
and allowing to have the Google Play stuff on there, they could put some rules in to

17:18.620 --> 17:19.620
stop it.

17:19.620 --> 17:24.080
And they could enforce those rules and make sure that OEMs do not get away with this.

17:24.080 --> 17:28.240
It's such a shame because by the time mobile devices came around, we knew how to do things

17:28.240 --> 17:29.240
better.

17:29.240 --> 17:34.680
We had lived through the era of horrible Windows OEMs loading PCs up with crap.

17:34.680 --> 17:38.720
And we had recognized what a flaw that was, especially groups like Google who are trying

17:38.720 --> 17:41.000
to do things differently.

17:41.000 --> 17:42.360
And here we are.

17:42.360 --> 17:46.520
And it's just Windows and Mac OS all over again, only in the mobile space.

17:46.520 --> 17:50.440
Well, don't worry, machine learning and deep learning is going to save us from all this.

17:50.440 --> 17:52.680
And Amazon has got just the thing for that.

17:52.680 --> 17:55.940
You know it's legit, Joe, because it's got a dot science TLD.

17:55.940 --> 17:57.280
It's Amazon dot science.

17:57.280 --> 17:59.780
So this is for real here.

17:59.780 --> 18:01.400
It's called AutoGluon.

18:01.400 --> 18:03.500
And it's named after what, Joe?

18:03.500 --> 18:04.500
You looked this up.

18:04.500 --> 18:05.500
I didn't look it up.

18:05.500 --> 18:07.440
I knew that a gluon was a subatomic particle.

18:07.440 --> 18:08.440
Nerd.

18:08.440 --> 18:09.440
Yeah, no, OK.

18:09.440 --> 18:10.820
And so that's where it gets its name from.

18:10.820 --> 18:16.100
And so they've open sourced this AutoML library that automates deep learning and machine learning

18:16.100 --> 18:21.540
for real world applications involving image and text and certain types of data sets.

18:21.540 --> 18:23.280
So what does that mean in practical sense?

18:23.280 --> 18:27.120
Well, in practical sense, if you're on a Linux system and you've got Python, you can pull

18:27.120 --> 18:31.580
this down now and you can start throwing it at images and it will start recognizing the

18:31.580 --> 18:35.620
crap in those images, like people, motorbikes, tree.

18:35.620 --> 18:37.780
So that's one of the many things it can do.

18:37.780 --> 18:42.400
But what it's doing on the back end is what Amazon says is the real magic.

18:42.400 --> 18:47.140
The part where they're saying they're democratizing machine learning is because they've built

18:47.140 --> 18:53.780
a system that figures out a lot of the hard stuff, a lot of the tweaking where you try

18:53.780 --> 18:58.720
something, it doesn't work, you retry it, you tweak it a little bit, modify this, run

18:58.720 --> 19:02.320
it again, it doesn't work, and you iterate on that 100 times.

19:02.320 --> 19:03.960
They call this hyperparameters.

19:03.960 --> 19:08.440
And they say it represents a considerable number of choices the developers must make

19:08.440 --> 19:10.540
when they're constructing a neural network.

19:10.540 --> 19:13.740
Joe and I have this problem all the time when we're building our neural networks to do podcasting

19:13.740 --> 19:14.740
for us.

19:14.740 --> 19:18.180
It involves all kinds of selections, like the number of layers in the neural network,

19:18.180 --> 19:22.460
how these layers should be connected, like the architecture of that network even, and

19:22.460 --> 19:28.180
then how to train each individual network, what data sets to use, all of that is automated

19:28.180 --> 19:33.240
by this library, this Python library that you pull down on your Linux box.

19:33.240 --> 19:38.020
And it looks at what you're trying to do and it runs through these scenarios and solves

19:38.020 --> 19:43.140
a lot of these problems for you, tries different things very fast, and gets it all set up.

19:43.140 --> 19:47.580
Essentially now, what their pitch is, and of course, the proof will be in the results,

19:47.580 --> 19:52.540
but their pitch is the developers don't have to manually experiment with hundreds of individual

19:52.540 --> 19:57.300
choices that must be made when you're designing a deep learning model.

19:57.300 --> 20:02.020
They'll just simply click, specify when they'd like to have their trained model ready, and

20:02.020 --> 20:03.020
it runs.

20:03.020 --> 20:08.020
And this is open source, it's Apache licensed, so you can run it on your own machine.

20:08.020 --> 20:12.140
But I wonder why Amazon might be giving this to the community?

20:12.140 --> 20:16.580
Maybe to run these instances on AWS and make a lot of money?

20:16.580 --> 20:20.140
Machine learning as a service, Joe.

20:20.140 --> 20:22.780
It does seem like anyone can benefit from this, though.

20:22.780 --> 20:26.260
It really simplifies it down to just a few lines of code.

20:26.260 --> 20:31.180
And it feels like even I could maybe get started with this.

20:31.180 --> 20:36.580
I had that same thought when I looked at it, I was like, oh, I could actually throw this

20:36.580 --> 20:41.180
at some of my Shinobi surveillance footage and actually just have it start auto-tagging

20:41.180 --> 20:42.180
stuff in there.

20:42.180 --> 20:45.580
I was like, wow, this is super approachable.

20:45.580 --> 20:49.380
And one of the things I like about it is right now, it only works on Linux.

20:49.380 --> 20:53.060
They're going to support other operating systems, like that's totally on the roadmap.

20:53.060 --> 20:56.460
But this is like cutting edge stuff.

20:56.460 --> 20:59.660
And it's so cool that Linux is the only supported OS right now.

20:59.660 --> 21:05.660
It just really is a reaffirmation of the state of Linux in this area of computing.

21:05.660 --> 21:06.660
Yeah.

21:06.660 --> 21:07.660
Linux first.

21:07.660 --> 21:08.660
Yeah.

21:08.660 --> 21:09.660
It's great.

21:09.660 --> 21:11.500
I mean, they'll get it for the other platforms.

21:11.500 --> 21:16.060
But it's just, it's so, I don't know, it feels so great to be on this side of it for once.

21:16.060 --> 21:19.540
And it's been like this for a little while with this kind of stuff.

21:19.540 --> 21:23.260
And if anyone out in the audience gets a chance to play around with this and has some fun,

21:23.260 --> 21:24.260
do let us know.

21:24.260 --> 21:27.860
So go to linuxactionnews.com contact and tell us how you're using it.

21:27.860 --> 21:32.260
I have actually now looked it up and I know a little bit more about what a gluon is.

21:32.260 --> 21:36.980
It's an elementary particle that acts as the exchange particle or gauge boson for the strong

21:36.980 --> 21:38.340
force between quarks.

21:38.340 --> 21:39.340
Right.

21:39.340 --> 21:40.340
The gauge boson.

21:40.340 --> 21:45.020
And don't forget, you can go to linuxactionnews.com slash subscribe for all the ways to get new

21:45.020 --> 21:46.020

21:49.980 --> 21:51.780
Think of it as a sunsetter for your evening.

21:51.780 --> 21:56.340
In three minutes or less, everything happened in Linux and open source that day.

21:56.340 --> 22:00.100
We'll be back next Monday with our weekly take on the latest Linux and open source news.

22:00.100 --> 22:02.100
I am at Chris LAS.

22:02.100 --> 22:03.780
I'm at Joe Rissington.

22:03.780 --> 22:04.780
Thanks for joining us.

22:04.780 --> 22:05.780
We'll see you next week.

22:05.780 --> 22:28.380
See you later.
