Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, our weekly take on Linux and the open source world.

00:16.080 --> 00:20.640
This is episode 61, recorded on July 8th, 2018.

00:20.640 --> 00:21.640
I'm Chris.

00:21.640 --> 00:22.640
And I'm Joe.

00:22.640 --> 00:23.640
Hello, Joe.

00:23.640 --> 00:27.240
It's good to be connected with you from the Linux Academy offices.

00:27.240 --> 00:31.280
I've commandeered one of their recording booths to get into some news with you.

00:31.280 --> 00:36.120
And let's start with the huge story that everyone is still talking about all week long.

00:36.120 --> 00:37.560
SUSE has been acquired.

00:37.560 --> 00:43.160
Yes, for $2.5 billion by a company called EQT.

00:43.160 --> 00:48.520
Yeah, EQT is buying them from Microfocus, who's owned them for a little bit now.

00:48.520 --> 00:52.000
And the language around the whole announcement is super positive.

00:52.000 --> 00:55.680
What I call an acquisition, they're calling a partnership.

00:55.680 --> 00:59.920
And it sounds like EQT is interested in really kind of keeping things the way they are with

00:59.920 --> 01:05.400
SUSE only doubling down on perhaps some talent and hiring and investing in certain areas

01:05.400 --> 01:07.240
that they think SUSE is primed to grow.

01:07.240 --> 01:08.800
I'm not sure what those areas are.

01:08.800 --> 01:10.480
They don't really call those out.

01:10.480 --> 01:14.600
But the language suggests that this is a really positive move for SUSE.

01:14.600 --> 01:20.720
It's funny that when I think about SUSE, I don't think about a kind of fashionable distro,

01:20.720 --> 01:27.480
but it's not kind of in the news for exciting developments very often.

01:27.480 --> 01:33.960
But this kind of shows that it must be used by a lot of enterprises and people who are

01:33.960 --> 01:39.760
actually paying them and making them worth $2.5 billion because that is a lot of money.

01:39.760 --> 01:45.060
I mean, okay, it's not red hat money, but it does show that they must be profitable.

01:45.060 --> 01:50.640
They must be growing and things must be chugging along nicely there.

01:50.640 --> 01:58.160
It doesn't make it any more exciting as a distro and open SUSE never particularly excites

01:58.160 --> 02:04.040
me either, but it must be doing well and that's got to be good for open source generally,

02:04.040 --> 02:05.040
hasn't it?

02:05.040 --> 02:06.040
Yeah.

02:06.040 --> 02:07.040
You know, I think I mostly agree, Joe.

02:07.040 --> 02:08.040
That's a pretty positive spin on that.

02:08.040 --> 02:09.040
I'm impressed.

02:09.040 --> 02:10.640
And I'll tell you where that figure comes from.

02:10.640 --> 02:18.600
So it's like the final figure is 2.35 billion and that is 26.7 times the adjusted operating

02:18.600 --> 02:22.880
profit of the SUSE software unit from Micro Focus.

02:22.880 --> 02:26.600
That's according to Micro Focus in an interview in Reuters.

02:26.600 --> 02:28.880
So that's a pretty big adjustment.

02:28.880 --> 02:32.420
In some industries, you might see three times the operating profit.

02:32.420 --> 02:36.760
Sometimes you see something much larger if there is an assumed potential.

02:36.760 --> 02:39.480
And so you kind of hedge on the potential of the business.

02:39.480 --> 02:44.800
So that could be where the 26.7 times what their profit was.

02:44.800 --> 02:47.920
That's how they're getting to 2.535 billion.

02:47.920 --> 02:51.080
And it could suggest what you're saying, that there is some direction they're going.

02:51.080 --> 02:55.060
There is an obvious trajectory of growth here that they're seeing when they look at all

02:55.060 --> 02:56.260
of the numbers.

02:56.260 --> 02:58.720
And so that's why the figure could be so high.

02:58.720 --> 03:01.720
And yeah, that is a good sign for open source and free software.

03:01.720 --> 03:08.240
I wonder to what extent Red Hat doing so well lately and Canonical shaping up to try and

03:08.240 --> 03:10.240
do an IPO or get bought or whatever.

03:10.240 --> 03:16.080
I wonder to what extent all of that had a bearing on this valuation because it's not

03:16.080 --> 03:18.620
just SUSE as an individual company.

03:18.620 --> 03:20.660
It's the whole industry is going that way.

03:20.660 --> 03:26.200
And as we move towards more automation and Internet of Things devices, it all needs a

03:26.200 --> 03:27.200
backend.

03:27.200 --> 03:28.440
It all needs servers.

03:28.440 --> 03:31.120
And that is all running Linux.

03:31.120 --> 03:37.740
And so it's almost like this rising tide lifts all ships idea, isn't it?

03:37.740 --> 03:44.400
And so I wonder if part of the growth projection is just based on the industry in general growing.

03:44.400 --> 03:46.600
Yeah, I might know the name for that rising tide, Joe.

03:46.600 --> 03:48.160
I think it's called Kubernetes.

03:48.160 --> 03:52.980
And SUSE earlier this year really started putting their marketing effort behind their

03:52.980 --> 03:54.680
initiatives around Kubernetes.

03:54.680 --> 04:00.760
And they've launched several platforms, including the SUSE OpenStack Cloud, the SUSE Cloud Application

04:00.760 --> 04:06.880
Platform, and the SUSE Cast Platform, which is a certified Kubernetes software distribution.

04:06.880 --> 04:11.440
And when they got in that game and then started making hype about it around April, I think

04:11.440 --> 04:16.000
that probably is a likely source of a lot of their future potential.

04:16.000 --> 04:17.600
The Kubernetes hype is strong.

04:17.600 --> 04:22.780
If they would have called it the SUSE Kubernetes blockchain distribution, that figure may have

04:22.780 --> 04:25.360
been 80 times.

04:25.360 --> 04:31.800
Well, something that surely there's only a positive spin to be put on is GNOME are hiring

04:31.800 --> 04:35.700
thanks to the cash injection that they got a few weeks ago.

04:35.700 --> 04:38.720
Now they're going to spend that on hiring some new personnel.

04:38.720 --> 04:40.880
Yeah, for new posts.

04:40.880 --> 04:46.220
And yes, we'll have a link to the job opening page in the show notes, linuxactionnews.com

04:46.220 --> 04:47.680
slash 61.

04:47.680 --> 04:52.480
Now the foundation is currently recruiting four positions, a development coordinator,

04:52.480 --> 04:58.640
program coordinator, assist admin, and one developer, one GTK plus core developer.

04:58.640 --> 04:59.960
But didn't they get a million dollars?

04:59.960 --> 05:03.520
So does that mean they're paying 250,000 each for these positions?

05:03.520 --> 05:06.620
Because if they are, I'm in.

05:06.620 --> 05:09.280
Something tells me it doesn't quite work as cleanly as that.

05:09.280 --> 05:11.200
But it's probably, it's somewhere in the range.

05:11.200 --> 05:18.280
I mean, it depends on where you hire a competent developer or assist admin or development coordinator

05:18.280 --> 05:23.180
in the West Coast or East Coast area of the United States.

05:23.180 --> 05:29.200
That's a fairly well paid position over probably 130 if you do it right and maybe more than

05:29.200 --> 05:32.400
that depending in what area of California you work.

05:32.400 --> 05:33.980
But really, I know they could hire anywhere in the world.

05:33.980 --> 05:37.000
So I guess it's just sort of up to where they want to hire from.

05:37.000 --> 05:41.460
It's interesting that this development coordinator under the very brief description of it says

05:41.460 --> 05:46.240
that this will ensure that we receive sufficient funds to continue our work delivering free

05:46.240 --> 05:47.420
software.

05:47.420 --> 05:53.120
So that job is basically get us some more money so we can hire some more people.

05:53.120 --> 05:54.780
It's the virtuous circle.

05:54.780 --> 05:59.760
It is interesting that they're ramping up on a couple of key admin positions, the development

05:59.760 --> 06:01.800
coordinator, and the program coordinator.

06:01.800 --> 06:05.720
The development coordinator ensures that they receive sufficient funds to continue work

06:05.720 --> 06:07.840
on delivering free software.

06:07.840 --> 06:09.800
That's an interesting description for a development coordinator.

06:09.800 --> 06:14.760
And then the program coordinator frees up time for those involved in organizational,

06:14.760 --> 06:17.160
administrative, and logical problems.

06:17.160 --> 06:21.160
So a program coordinator kind of sounds like an office admin type position.

06:21.160 --> 06:27.040
But in this case, because they're a gnome foundation making software, it's called a

06:27.040 --> 06:28.400
program coordinator.

06:28.400 --> 06:32.200
Those two admin positions, though, sound like they're meant to sort of free up resources

06:32.200 --> 06:38.380
within the foundation, people that are already overtaxed, perhaps wearing too many hats.

06:38.380 --> 06:41.440
That's an interesting direction to go and often a good move.

06:41.440 --> 06:45.320
It sounds like on the surface, oh, they're just hiring a bunch of more admin work.

06:45.320 --> 06:48.640
But a lot of times you get people that have been working, have a lot of knowledge about

06:48.640 --> 06:52.940
the project or the organizational structure, and they sort of get overtaxed.

06:52.940 --> 06:56.520
They're doing too many things, and if you can free up some of their time, make them

06:56.520 --> 06:59.760
more efficient, it's generally good for the project as a whole.

06:59.760 --> 07:03.200
So this overall looks like a pretty good spread, and obviously getting a sysadmin in there

07:03.200 --> 07:08.100
will help take off some of the load of managing the infrastructure, which I'm a big fan of.

07:08.100 --> 07:10.720
And they specifically call out Flathub in here, and they're going to say it's going

07:10.720 --> 07:12.040
to need more support soon.

07:12.040 --> 07:15.880
Yeah, it's not only Flathub that that sysadmin is going to be helping out with.

07:15.880 --> 07:18.840
There's also Nextcloud and GitLab.

07:18.840 --> 07:21.240
So whoever gets the job is going to be busy.

07:21.240 --> 07:25.020
Yeah, like I said at the start of the story, we do have the link to the positions page

07:25.020 --> 07:28.660
if you want to take a look at the requirements and some of the other details.

07:28.660 --> 07:32.920
One thing I just might note, I believe these are all one-year contracts initially.

07:32.920 --> 07:36.240
They could continue on, obviously, and you think about the position of the foundation

07:36.240 --> 07:40.140
and the uncertainty of future funding, that kind of makes sense.

07:40.140 --> 07:43.960
One-year contracts right now, but they look like decent gigs, and they say competitive

07:43.960 --> 07:49.940
salary, flexible working, generous paid time off, and travel allowances as well as healthcare.

07:49.940 --> 07:53.180
Might be worth checking out, linuxactionnews.com slash 61.

07:53.180 --> 07:59.200
Or something else that's definitely worth checking out is GNU Geeks GUIX, which is their

07:59.200 --> 08:04.600
transactional package manager, and GeeksSD, which is their distro.

08:04.600 --> 08:07.840
They don't mention Linux very much, surprise, surprise with it being GNU.

08:07.840 --> 08:13.640
They're quite keen to call it a GNU distribution, but it does have the Linux kernel as well,

08:13.640 --> 08:16.200
albeit the Libre version.

08:16.200 --> 08:21.800
But 0.15 has been released, and they talk about it being the last 0.something release,

08:21.800 --> 08:28.440
or at least one of the last 0.something releases, so they're gearing up for 1.0.

08:28.440 --> 08:34.480
And what has caught my eye is that Geeks has been solving a lot of problems with the transactional

08:34.480 --> 08:40.560
updates that now a lot of distributions are starting to solve in different ways.

08:40.560 --> 08:45.080
So you can think of Geeks as really in two projects in a way.

08:45.080 --> 08:48.360
They're a transactional package manager, but they're a distro as well.

08:48.360 --> 08:54.240
But they do have instructions for overlaying Geeks on top of your own distro, even getting

08:54.240 --> 08:59.120
it all set up with your boot environment and going as far as you might possibly want.

08:59.120 --> 09:02.560
And one of the things that's kind of neat about that is then all of a sudden you get

09:02.560 --> 09:07.180
transactional upgrades, which means if it doesn't work, you go right back, which includes

09:07.180 --> 09:12.320
rollbacks, unprivileged package management, and I'll pause there if you recall recently

09:12.320 --> 09:16.120
I was trying out the AWS Workspace.

09:16.120 --> 09:19.820
It has very limited software selection now with their new Linux 2.

09:19.820 --> 09:24.140
It's very much intended for certain types of workloads, and if you're outside that,

09:24.140 --> 09:26.720
you kind of are out of luck.

09:26.720 --> 09:29.480
This would give me everything I'm looking for.

09:29.480 --> 09:31.360
I could install things like Chromium.

09:31.360 --> 09:37.040
I could even install the GNOME desktop with the Geeks package manager on top of my existing

09:37.040 --> 09:38.040
distribution.

09:38.040 --> 09:42.560
And with rollbacks and unprivileged management, i.e. I don't have to be root, that means I

09:42.560 --> 09:48.320
could get pretty far on a virtual instance or it's just a workstation where I don't have

09:48.320 --> 09:49.360
root access.

09:49.360 --> 09:52.880
It also has per user profile support and garbage collection.

09:52.880 --> 09:57.520
It's really pulling in low-level mechanisms from one of my favorite package managers of

09:57.520 --> 09:59.320
all time, Nix.

09:59.320 --> 10:00.560
So that's what's so cool about it.

10:00.560 --> 10:05.440
And you can try it out as a distro, which is a pretty hardcore installation process.

10:05.440 --> 10:09.120
It drops you to a command prompt and then just says, hey, if you don't know what to

10:09.120 --> 10:16.020
do, hit Alt F2, go over to your other TTY and read the instructions, and then come back

10:16.020 --> 10:19.320
over and type the commands here at the root prompt that you want done.

10:19.320 --> 10:23.000
So that's kind of a fun installation process if you know what you're getting into.

10:23.000 --> 10:27.400
Or you could abuse an existing installation and try to lay this thing on top of it.

10:27.400 --> 10:29.440
Both are super geeky and pretty cool.

10:29.440 --> 10:32.720
Why do you think that it's not more popular than it is than Geeks?

10:32.720 --> 10:38.160
Because technically it is amazing, but you don't seem to hear about it.

10:38.160 --> 10:43.960
It's not implemented in other distros, and it just seems to have flown under the radar

10:43.960 --> 10:44.960
somehow.

10:44.960 --> 10:48.320
It's definitely got to be in part because it's kind of a bit of an afternoon to get

10:48.320 --> 10:49.320
it up and going.

10:49.320 --> 10:52.800
I mean, maybe a couple of hours if you're lucky.

10:52.800 --> 10:55.500
And that's kind of a barrier to entry.

10:55.500 --> 10:59.760
But on top of that, it's solving a problem that there's solutions for.

10:59.760 --> 11:03.400
It's the Betamax VHS problem in our modern era.

11:03.400 --> 11:11.840
I can get absolutely everything I need these days from Docker, Flat Hub, Snap packages,

11:11.840 --> 11:15.120
and insert various other methods to get software.

11:15.120 --> 11:18.880
When have you really been totally out of luck these days?

11:18.880 --> 11:23.840
I used to run Arch as a daily driver just because the AUR was a surefire guaranteed

11:23.840 --> 11:25.380
way for me to get software.

11:25.380 --> 11:32.600
But for this entire 2018 year so far, I've been having no problem on an Ubuntu LTS, Kubuntu

11:32.600 --> 11:37.200
based desktop, because I can get software different ways now that are good enough.

11:37.200 --> 11:39.560
They're not ideal, but they're good enough.

11:39.560 --> 11:42.200
And that's always been all the market really needs.

11:42.200 --> 11:45.440
And there was a time where I couldn't even live on an LTS.

11:45.440 --> 11:46.600
It just drove me crazy.

11:46.600 --> 11:48.880
I became known as a rolling release guy.

11:48.880 --> 11:51.160
And that was simply because of software availability.

11:51.160 --> 11:53.720
I haven't had that problem for a while now.

11:53.720 --> 11:58.560
And I think in a way, Geeks is solving a problem that other things that are kind of good enough

11:58.560 --> 11:59.560
already solve.

11:59.560 --> 12:02.920
And it kind of took an edge case for me to really go, oh, I could use this.

12:02.920 --> 12:06.960
And that's when I'm using AWS's Workspace as a daily driver.

12:06.960 --> 12:13.160
And I got to admit, that's an edge case scenario there.

12:13.160 --> 12:15.400
Linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

12:15.400 --> 12:20.040
Linux Academy is a platform to learn more about Linux and all of the different ways

12:20.040 --> 12:22.640
you can use it that help out the resume too.

12:22.640 --> 12:27.240
AWS, Azure, OpenStack, or the essentials of Linux itself.

12:27.240 --> 12:31.920
Basically, if it can run Linux or Linux runs on it, Linux Academy has courseware about

12:31.920 --> 12:32.920
it.

12:32.920 --> 12:35.840
And in July, they have their largest content launch in history.

12:35.840 --> 12:39.520
That's why I'm down here at their office to help them celebrate the launch because not

12:39.520 --> 12:42.920
only do I love a good party, but I'm going to be on their Tuesday stream while they're

12:42.920 --> 12:44.400
launching a bunch of stuff.

12:44.400 --> 12:46.280
I'm very excited about this, and so are they.

12:46.280 --> 12:50.720
I've been watching the company really as a whole celebrate this massive achievement.

12:50.720 --> 12:56.080
And you can get started right now for seven days absolutely free when you go to Linuxacademy.com

12:56.080 --> 12:57.080
slash unplugged.

12:57.080 --> 12:58.080
But you know what?

12:58.080 --> 12:59.120
I'll also mention this.

12:59.120 --> 13:02.440
They have a free community plan that they just recently added a bunch of new content

13:02.440 --> 13:05.640
to as well, Linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

13:05.640 --> 13:08.960
You go there to support the show, and then you can sign up for a free seven-day trial.

13:08.960 --> 13:14.640
Get access to everything, downloadable content, audio guides, I mean, it's awesome.

13:14.640 --> 13:18.600
Or try out the community section, tons of great content in there and it doesn't cost

13:18.600 --> 13:25.180
you a dime, Linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

13:25.180 --> 13:28.360
Another week, another Android security story.

13:28.360 --> 13:34.400
This time it turns out that pretty much most Android apps can record your screen and then

13:34.400 --> 13:37.520
send that off to various third parties.

13:37.520 --> 13:43.820
Yeah, this is a massive study that is being billed as the first large-scale empirical

13:43.820 --> 13:47.800
study of media permissions and leaks from Android apps.

13:47.800 --> 13:52.940
And the damning thing here isn't necessarily the apps that you love, but the third-party

13:52.940 --> 13:55.560
libraries that they're using.

13:55.560 --> 14:02.240
And this impacts over 89% of apps in the Google Play Store that make use of an API that requests

14:02.240 --> 14:04.360
screen capture or recording.

14:04.360 --> 14:09.080
And the user is oblivious as it evades the Android permissions framework entirely.

14:09.080 --> 14:13.720
Now, this whole study has been done by several different large universities and they found

14:13.720 --> 14:18.360
that users and app developers who purportedly set controlled permissions are unaware that

14:18.360 --> 14:23.040
these third-party libraries are doing screen capture and even screen recording in some

14:23.040 --> 14:24.040
cases.

14:24.040 --> 14:26.220
And in the words of the researchers, they said the Android permission model is flawed

14:26.220 --> 14:29.120
because it's coarse-grained and it's incomplete.

14:29.120 --> 14:32.960
It's a pretty damning study because you don't really ever think about the libraries that

14:32.960 --> 14:34.520
these apps might be depending on.

14:34.520 --> 14:38.840
You trust the app developer, the core developer, but you have no idea what libraries they're

14:38.840 --> 14:40.840
bundling underneath that app.

14:40.840 --> 14:45.560
Well, no doubt Google will fix this in the next version of Android and then everyone's

14:45.560 --> 14:48.800
going to get that instantly, so problem solved, right?

14:48.800 --> 14:49.800
Yeah.

14:49.800 --> 14:54.200
So, ask yourself, what is this data being used for?

14:54.200 --> 14:56.080
What is this data being used for?

14:56.080 --> 15:01.040
Even if it's not being used by Google directly to sell Google AdWords, it's got to be used

15:01.040 --> 15:02.420
for advertising.

15:02.420 --> 15:07.060
That's what all these companies are trying to do with this data is sell you better ads.

15:07.060 --> 15:09.720
And who are they probably buying those ads from?

15:09.720 --> 15:11.720
At least in part, Google.

15:11.720 --> 15:17.200
So it's not really surprising that the Android security model seems to allow things like

15:17.200 --> 15:19.040
this over and over again.

15:19.040 --> 15:22.960
I'm not saying Google's intentionally building Android like this, I'm just saying when an

15:22.960 --> 15:27.520
advertising company is making an operating system, I'm not super surprised these things

15:27.520 --> 15:28.560
keep happening.

15:28.560 --> 15:32.400
You just want to find any excuse to justify your iPhone, don't you?

15:32.400 --> 15:34.760
I tried not to bring up iOS at all.

15:34.760 --> 15:37.160
For all I know, this library problem could affect iOS.

15:37.160 --> 15:38.520
I mean, it's possible.

15:38.520 --> 15:42.640
Well, they said they're going to move on to that next iOS and try and find whether it's

15:42.640 --> 15:46.200
the same problem there or whether that's got other problems, which it might do.

15:46.200 --> 15:49.520
But I do take your point that it seems less likely, doesn't it?

15:49.520 --> 15:56.360
It seems less likely that a company who is out to sell you ridiculously expensive hardware

15:56.360 --> 16:01.800
as a business model is going to then spy on you and gather data so that they can sell

16:01.800 --> 16:05.440
ads because they're not selling ads like Google is.

16:05.440 --> 16:11.560
So I'm starting to come round to the logic of choosing iOS, but it's not something I

16:11.560 --> 16:13.880
would ever do, I don't suppose.

16:13.880 --> 16:18.160
But how many stories like this about Android being terrible with security is it going to

16:18.160 --> 16:19.720
take?

16:19.720 --> 16:24.120
That's why I think the top comment on the article we'll link to talks about Purism's

16:24.120 --> 16:29.280
phone, the Labrum 5, and how important it is that we get something like that.

16:29.280 --> 16:34.440
I mean, that commenter gets shot down instantly by someone saying that, you know, well, that's

16:34.440 --> 16:38.600
not available right now, and I'm not going to spend $600 on something that's potentially

16:38.600 --> 16:39.600
vaporware or whatever.

16:39.600 --> 16:46.320
But it just seems so important to me that we get a completely free software mobile OS

16:46.320 --> 16:50.080
that just doesn't have these problems, or if these problems are found, then they can

16:50.080 --> 16:51.680
be fixed by the community.

16:51.680 --> 16:56.560
I've always felt like the iOS device is a stopgap device for me, because it's not an

16:56.560 --> 16:58.740
ideal solution itself.

16:58.740 --> 17:03.280
But it seems like the intention of the company behind it is to sell hardware, not to sell

17:03.280 --> 17:04.280
ads.

17:04.280 --> 17:07.920
And that is where I start with that, because like when I'm traveling, I'm out and about,

17:07.920 --> 17:13.080
I'm using apps like Lyft or Uber and Google Maps, and I'm getting around because I don't

17:13.080 --> 17:14.080
know where I'm at.

17:14.080 --> 17:16.320
Like this morning, I had to nav to a grocery store, and then I had to navigate here to

17:16.320 --> 17:17.820
the Linux Academy office.

17:17.820 --> 17:22.780
So I need that tier of applications because of my job, I guess.

17:22.780 --> 17:29.200
And so I couldn't just switch whole hog to something like a Librem running Pure OS.

17:29.200 --> 17:34.320
But if it had compromises maybe allowed me to run Android apps, then I'd be willing to

17:34.320 --> 17:39.240
make a pretty big set of compromises to have a truly free platform, whatever it is.

17:39.240 --> 17:44.760
It just needs to have decent hardware that's fast, so my phone isn't frustrating to use,

17:44.760 --> 17:47.320
and an operating system I can trust.

17:47.320 --> 17:52.000
I've always kind of felt like my best option might be to go with an Android ROM on a high-end

17:52.000 --> 17:54.720
pixel device that is de-Google-ified.

17:54.720 --> 17:56.840
And that's always kind of an option I'm keeping an eye out for.

17:56.840 --> 18:01.000
Well, up until recently, you could have used Copperhead OS, but we reported on that a few

18:01.000 --> 18:04.120
weeks ago that things have gone a bit wrong there.

18:04.120 --> 18:08.080
But thankfully, there's a fork of it, which has appeared called Rattlesnake OS.

18:08.080 --> 18:12.760
Yeah, this is really taking independence to a next level because part of what the Rattlesnake

18:12.760 --> 18:20.960
OS promises is over-the-air updates that you build and verify yourself using a fully automated

18:20.960 --> 18:23.280
AWS infrastructure.

18:23.280 --> 18:30.400
So it spins up using AWS Lambda, and it provisions EC2 spot instances that build Rattlesnake

18:30.400 --> 18:37.080
OS, upload the build artifacts to S3, and then your phone updates over the air using

18:37.080 --> 18:42.400
your own entire trusted chain of systems that you have management and ownership over, as

18:42.400 --> 18:45.000
much as you can own somebody else's computer in the cloud.

18:45.000 --> 18:47.680
So this is clearly not aimed at end users, is it?

18:47.680 --> 18:50.040
It's very much aimed at the enterprise.

18:50.040 --> 18:51.560
I don't know, man, but I love it.

18:51.560 --> 18:52.760
I think it's aimed at me.

18:52.760 --> 18:58.360
It's got support for the Google Pixel XL, and the Pixel 2 XL, and the standard Pixel,

18:58.360 --> 19:02.340
and untested support, quote unquote, for the Pixel 2 standard.

19:02.340 --> 19:05.240
That is the range of hardware I was just thinking about.

19:05.240 --> 19:10.520
It comes with F-Droid pre-installed, the Chromium browser with WebView patches that are awesome

19:10.520 --> 19:14.880
because they block ads and enhance privacy, and it's using verified boot to make sure

19:14.880 --> 19:18.480
it's using your own official builds from your own systems.

19:18.480 --> 19:21.040
No Google apps are pre-installed at all.

19:21.040 --> 19:24.920
The whole infrastructure just cost a few dollars a month to maintain, and you have a whole

19:24.920 --> 19:26.040
chain of ownership there.

19:26.040 --> 19:32.240
Well, I must say that does sound appealing, but as someone who flashes Google apps every

19:32.240 --> 19:36.840
time I install lineage on a device, I don't know, there's just certain Google apps that

19:36.840 --> 19:42.800
I'm tied to, and so I don't think this would be for me, but I know a few people who run

19:42.800 --> 19:48.120
Google-less, and this extra level of security seems pretty appealing.

19:48.120 --> 19:49.120
This is pretty neat.

19:49.120 --> 19:50.120
I'm really impressed by the project.

19:50.120 --> 19:53.720
That's the whole automated approach to building it on your own infrastructure.

19:53.720 --> 19:57.480
You got to figure if you could figure out what that build environment was, you may be

19:57.480 --> 19:58.960
able to set it up on a local box.

19:58.960 --> 20:03.620
I don't think there's anything really specific to AWS other than the script that he created

20:03.620 --> 20:08.480
to automate the whole thing uses AWS and makes the process super fast and makes the download

20:08.480 --> 20:09.960
to your phone really fast.

20:09.960 --> 20:11.800
The trickiest part is getting started.

20:11.800 --> 20:16.360
You've got to get the initial setup on AWS, get all the things connected, and you've got

20:16.360 --> 20:18.840
to have the initial deployment on your phone.

20:18.840 --> 20:22.880
But after you successfully flash your device, you'll be running Rattlesnake OS, and future

20:22.880 --> 20:28.760
updates happen through your own built-in OTA updater, which means if the project goes AWOL,

20:28.760 --> 20:33.440
if people walk away with the GitHub, you still have your own build environment.

20:33.440 --> 20:37.680
As long as that source goes getting created, you can still do your own verification.

20:37.680 --> 20:41.400
Just doesn't solve the fact that it's Android, but it does solve a lot of other problems

20:41.400 --> 20:43.480
that we run into with projects like this.

20:43.480 --> 20:45.320
We'll have a link, again, in the show notes.

20:45.320 --> 20:49.400
Okay, well, let's end with a quick security PSA, and that is if you've been using the

20:49.400 --> 20:54.920
browser extension Stylish, stop doing that immediately because that has been stealing

20:54.920 --> 20:56.200
people's browsing history.

20:56.200 --> 21:03.900
Yeah, it looks like since January of 2017 in Chromium and then March of 2018 in Firefox

21:03.900 --> 21:05.400
is when this started happening.

21:05.400 --> 21:11.320
And if you followed guides online like I did to make Firefox look really slick on Gnome

21:11.320 --> 21:14.480
Shell, it uses Stylish to accomplish that.

21:14.480 --> 21:18.840
So you may have installed it ages ago and not even realized, so go double-check your

21:18.840 --> 21:19.840
extensions.

21:19.840 --> 21:23.440
The short version of it is Stylish's developer sold it a while ago.

21:23.440 --> 21:29.440
It's now owned by a company called SimilarWeb, and they actually promote market solutions

21:29.440 --> 21:35.400
to see all of your competitors' traffic amongst one of its areas of interest and strength

21:35.400 --> 21:36.720
on its website.

21:36.720 --> 21:38.280
This is just what they do.

21:38.280 --> 21:42.760
So they bought Stylish, and you can actually just look at the traffic, and you will see

21:42.760 --> 21:50.560
large chunks of data being sent to api.userstyles.org, sucking up your bandwidth and spying on everywhere

21:50.560 --> 21:51.560
you go.

21:51.560 --> 21:53.680
So go rip that sucker out of your browser.

21:53.680 --> 21:59.280
But the good news is there's a fork called Stylish which doesn't have any of this nasty

21:59.280 --> 22:04.400
stuff in it, so you can continue to have the same functionality but safe in the knowledge

22:04.400 --> 22:08.040
that all your browsing history isn't being sent to someone else.

22:08.040 --> 22:09.560
I love open source.

22:09.560 --> 22:11.080
That is awesome.

22:11.080 --> 22:16.360
Battlesnake OS forks from Cobrehead OS, and we have Stylish, which is a fork of Stylish.

22:16.360 --> 22:17.960
You gotta love it.

22:17.960 --> 22:22.240
When some company closes the window, open source opens the door?

22:22.240 --> 22:23.240
I'm not sure.

22:23.240 --> 22:26.080
But whatever the situation is, we'll report on it every single week.
