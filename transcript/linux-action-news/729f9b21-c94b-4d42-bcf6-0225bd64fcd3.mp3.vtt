Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, our weekly take on Linux and the open source world.

00:16.560 --> 00:22.000
This is episode 99, recorded on March 31st, 2019. I'm Chris.

00:22.000 --> 00:23.000
And I'm Joe.

00:23.000 --> 00:27.600
Hello, Joe. Good to be connect with you on Lucky 99. And we start out with some new software

00:27.600 --> 00:28.600
from Mozilla.

00:28.600 --> 00:34.320
Yeah, Firefox Lockbox has come to Android. And that allows you to sync your passwords

00:34.320 --> 00:38.840
over from the desktop. And I've tried it out and it works pretty well.

00:38.840 --> 00:45.160
This is another one of those was a test pilot. And then they launched it on iOS. On iOS,

00:45.160 --> 00:50.860
they recently updated it to be more iPad friendly, as they say. And now we have it on Android.

00:50.860 --> 00:55.400
So I guess the value proposition here is, if you've already invested in saving all of

00:55.400 --> 01:01.800
your passwords in Firefox, this now abstracts them out essentially from Firefox. So it utilizes

01:01.800 --> 01:06.520
that same password database, synchronizes it to the lockbox, you log in with your Mozilla

01:06.520 --> 01:10.720
account, and Bob's your uncle, there's all your passwords from Firefox. And on these

01:10.720 --> 01:15.160
mobile platforms, you can opt to also turn on autofill. So it will autofill apps and

01:15.160 --> 01:16.960
other websites from other browsers.

01:16.960 --> 01:20.800
Yeah, I tried out that autofill feature. And that worked absolutely perfectly. I was very

01:20.800 --> 01:22.960
impressed with this generally, I must say.

01:22.960 --> 01:27.040
And much like LastPass and other password managers that are out there, although lockbox

01:27.040 --> 01:31.600
is a little simpler than a lot of what's out there, that might actually be kind of appealing

01:31.600 --> 01:38.460
because it's not like too much. But for me, it's definitely not enough. And they're pitching

01:38.460 --> 01:43.000
this at complete newbies to password management. Like in their blog post, they write, say goodbye

01:43.000 --> 01:47.860
to the password cheat sheet. Store it as a note or a contact in your phone or maybe written

01:47.860 --> 01:52.240
on a sticky note on your desk. Like you're no longer doing the under the keyboard thing.

01:52.240 --> 01:53.240
That's who they're pitching this at.

01:53.240 --> 01:58.780
Oh, yeah, definitely. But I think one reason to switch to it from LastPass is the fact

01:58.780 --> 02:03.200
that it is open source. Unfortunately, it's not on F-Droid yet. So you do need the Play

02:03.200 --> 02:08.080
Store to install it. But I'd rather use something that I know is open source and comes from

02:08.080 --> 02:15.400
a trusted organization like Mozilla than LastPass, which they've had some breaches in the past

02:15.400 --> 02:20.920
and I don't know, I just don't trust them somehow. Whereas I'm very tempted to start

02:20.920 --> 02:21.920
using this.

02:21.920 --> 02:25.480
But I really can't disagree with any of that. I would say if you haven't been using a password

02:25.480 --> 02:30.520
manager, this might be a decent place to start, especially if you're a heavy Firefox user.

02:30.520 --> 02:37.160
For me, I've been using LastPass now for so long that I disabled the built in Firefox

02:37.160 --> 02:43.920
password manager. And so I have like a total of five passwords saved in my Firefox password

02:43.920 --> 02:50.360
database and everything else is in LastPass. So this service has not a lot of intrinsic

02:50.360 --> 02:55.480
value to me because I've already been using LastPass for so long. And there's a lot of

02:55.480 --> 02:58.840
other good alternatives out there as well, like key pass and many others that people

02:58.840 --> 03:03.840
could tell us about at linuxactionnews.com contact that I really feel like this is aimed

03:03.840 --> 03:08.920
at the new to password management market that are heavily invested in Firefox, which is

03:08.920 --> 03:13.600
a pretty narrow niche. But going back to your point, I do really like that this is open

03:13.600 --> 03:14.600
source.

03:14.600 --> 03:18.260
Yeah, and I think this is something that Mozilla should be spending money on. Some of the stuff

03:18.260 --> 03:21.960
they've done before is a bit questionable, but I think this is very useful. And the tight

03:21.960 --> 03:27.280
integration with Firefox means that it is actually really useful for people. And it

03:27.280 --> 03:32.720
means that you can use Firefox on the desktop. You don't necessarily even have to use Firefox

03:32.720 --> 03:38.760
on Android to take advantage of this because most people use apps for everything. So it

03:38.760 --> 03:42.200
seems like the kind of thing I want to see them doing.

03:42.200 --> 03:48.240
So let's talk about something Google is doing that I'm not yet sure how I feel about this.

03:48.240 --> 03:52.480
They're bringing AMP to email, of course, starting with Gmail.

03:52.480 --> 03:58.160
Of course with Gmail. So AMP accelerated mobile pages, which was originally a way to make

03:58.160 --> 04:02.400
websites that were really stripped down and worked really quickly on mobile. But the features

04:02.400 --> 04:07.320
have crept in and crept in. And now they're putting this into email. It was announced

04:07.320 --> 04:13.080
about a year ago, and it's taken this long to be fully rolled out. And it's just something

04:13.080 --> 04:20.840
that I'm not interested in at all. I don't even like HTML emails really. Never mind rich

04:20.840 --> 04:26.800
features like carousels and being able to vote in polls and interact with emails. I

04:26.800 --> 04:33.520
want emails to be just a plain text document really. I want just some facts in that email

04:33.520 --> 04:37.980
and maybe some links that I can then click through. But the whole point of it is to make

04:37.980 --> 04:41.320
it simpler, make it so that you don't have to click through.

04:41.320 --> 04:46.600
So I think some people will like it. But for me, it just seems like emails fine. Don't

04:46.600 --> 04:47.600
mess with it.

04:47.600 --> 04:53.320
Google pitches this as turning email into a surface to get things done, which is pretty

04:53.320 --> 04:59.780
broad. Another way to say is it's a way to turn emails more into apps without using a

04:59.780 --> 05:06.440
ton of JavaScript. So this is a reduced version of the AMP spec specifically for email. We'll

05:06.440 --> 05:10.360
have a link in the show notes if you want more information. And there are a considerable

05:10.360 --> 05:14.400
amount of security considerations that have been put into this.

05:14.400 --> 05:17.880
So let's talk about what Google is trying to do here. The way Google frames this is

05:17.880 --> 05:23.980
that there is a movement for interactive emails that is being driven by large corporations

05:23.980 --> 05:28.600
that want to have more engaging emails. And there's all these different competing ideas.

05:28.600 --> 05:34.200
And so this is their suggestion. And from a high level, the advantages it offers is

05:34.200 --> 05:38.120
real time content in emails like you could have flight information that's updated in

05:38.120 --> 05:43.840
real time or news stories or weather that is updated real time in an email thread. You

05:43.840 --> 05:48.080
could bring in other components. Google has partners they brought on like Pinterest and

05:48.080 --> 05:52.760
others that will have dynamic content that updates in the email. It sounds like a nightmare

05:52.760 --> 05:57.400
to me personally. However, Google's version of future is this is coming whether you want

05:57.400 --> 05:58.400
it or not.

05:58.400 --> 06:02.640
That is a reasonable argument. I suppose that if it's going to happen, then at least make

06:02.640 --> 06:08.080
it an open standard and have it all be open source and everything. But I'd rather that

06:08.080 --> 06:11.760
they just said no, we're not going to stand for this. Gmail is one of the biggest if not

06:11.760 --> 06:16.480
the biggest email platforms in the world. And they could just say we're going to block

06:16.480 --> 06:21.520
all of this HTML and JavaScript stuff, rather than encouraging it like this. But I suppose

06:21.520 --> 06:25.160
then, ultimately, people may start switching away. And that's probably what they're worried

06:25.160 --> 06:26.160
about.

06:26.160 --> 06:30.920
One of the things that I admittedly thought this would be for would be so that way Google

06:30.920 --> 06:35.840
could guarantee a way to deliver rich ads in email because right, I mean, that seems

06:35.840 --> 06:42.200
like one of the things you would want a more interactive email experience to have is advertising.

06:42.200 --> 06:47.100
But when you look at the AMP for email spec, they specifically removed the advertising

06:47.100 --> 06:53.200
portion of the AMP spec. It's not allowed in AMP for email. And on top of that, if you

06:53.200 --> 06:58.200
want to send one of these emails to a Gmail user, you have to go ask permission from Google

06:58.200 --> 07:03.080
directly. And they have a whole series of verifications you have to go through and steps

07:03.080 --> 07:06.800
you have to take to send AMP emails to Gmail users.

07:06.800 --> 07:10.720
How long is it going to be before adverts slip into this, though? Because originally

07:10.720 --> 07:15.520
AMP didn't have any adverts. And then eventually, they added that feature. And they've made

07:15.520 --> 07:20.520
a bit of a song and dance about the fact that this doesn't have adverts in it. But it's

07:20.520 --> 07:22.120
surely a matter of time.

07:22.120 --> 07:26.960
I should think so. And AMP still has the original issues that we have with AMP. And that is

07:26.960 --> 07:30.800
that is controlled primarily by Google. I admit they set up that new council, but that

07:30.800 --> 07:36.920
council is still pretty much controlled by Google. And I'm not comfortable with this

07:36.920 --> 07:43.480
very heavy handed using the leverage of Gmail. And they've partnered up with outlook.com

07:43.480 --> 07:49.240
and mail.ru to also support AMP emails. So they're using this very large market lever

07:49.240 --> 07:54.760
to really essentially force a standard onto everybody. And email used to be the one last

07:54.760 --> 08:00.240
remaining decentralized standard and protocol we have. Anybody could set up SMTP and IMAP

08:00.240 --> 08:04.920
and POP3 or whatever the hell they want and have their own mail server. I don't recommend

08:04.920 --> 08:09.400
it, but anybody could do it. But now we're beginning to see a shift where at least a

08:09.400 --> 08:14.600
portion of the content of an email is going to be centrally controlled by one corporation.

08:14.600 --> 08:19.400
Well, not necessarily, because they're not changing the way email works. They're adding

08:19.400 --> 08:25.360
to it. And so this will be optional. And you can still send plain text emails to each other

08:25.360 --> 08:30.400
without this. And I don't think they're ever going to stop that happening. And maybe you'll

08:30.400 --> 08:34.880
just get a link to the content or whatever if your client doesn't support it. So I think

08:34.880 --> 08:36.680
people will be able to just block this.

08:36.680 --> 08:39.920
Yeah, they're going to have to have a fallback mode. You're right. Because a lot of people

08:39.920 --> 08:44.120
just have plain text turned on on their mail client. And so there will have to be some

08:44.120 --> 08:49.360
sort of fallback system. And I think what I'm getting at is Google's going to have,

08:49.360 --> 08:55.320
they could if this takes off, have a very critical part of what becomes modern email.

08:55.320 --> 08:59.280
They could really kind of own that. And maybe you could argue they already do with Gmail,

08:59.280 --> 09:06.240
but I don't know, this just feels different. If you could just hit the reset button and

09:06.240 --> 09:12.360
do AMP over again, it almost makes more sense in this context, especially in its more restricted

09:12.360 --> 09:17.820
mode. You could kind of see like, start here, start with AMP for email and then over time

09:17.820 --> 09:23.240
grow it to the web. Because I think undoubtedly part of it is my biases I have about AMP for

09:23.240 --> 09:28.600
the web and how that's been bad for publishers, like ourselves, has influenced how I view

09:28.600 --> 09:32.480
AMP for email. When it actually seems like it could be, especially when you watch some

09:32.480 --> 09:37.600
of Google's videos, a pretty usable product, or at least one that you could see a lot of

09:37.600 --> 09:42.840
companies would want to use. I don't know if I want it, but when you see their product

09:42.840 --> 09:46.360
demonstrations, it's clear there's going to be market demand for something like this.

09:46.360 --> 09:50.880
Well, I think you've almost hit the nail on the head there in that it's solving a problem

09:50.880 --> 09:54.040
that doesn't exist. It's companies wanting to solve this problem.

09:54.040 --> 09:55.040
Yes.

09:55.040 --> 09:59.160
And it will appeal to them. But I don't think it's necessarily going to appeal to consumers,

09:59.160 --> 10:01.400
because it's certainly not appealing to either of us.

10:01.400 --> 10:07.000
I already hate my email. I don't want it doing more things. I don't need the weather updated

10:07.000 --> 10:12.560
in my email. And I realized that was just a really cute example they had. But I'm perfectly

10:12.560 --> 10:16.560
okay with just getting the link to go get the most relevant information. And I'm good

10:16.560 --> 10:22.480
with that. And I'd like to keep email as clean and simple as possible. Then it's easier to

10:22.480 --> 10:27.520
encrypt. It's easier. It's more standards compliant. But I doubt I'm going to get my

10:27.520 --> 10:29.520
wish on that one, Joe.

10:29.520 --> 10:33.880
Yeah. All right. Well, things have been happening in Ubuntu land this week.

10:33.880 --> 10:38.360
Yeah. I have gotten my wish on one thing, and that is performance improvements and stability

10:38.360 --> 10:44.040
improvements to the GNOME Shell Stack. And these are very apparent in the new Ubuntu

10:44.040 --> 10:48.320
19.04. We wanted to give a quick rundown of a couple of these because there's some big

10:48.320 --> 10:52.080
progress that's going to be trickling down to a lot of the new distribution releases

10:52.080 --> 10:53.600
starting right here.

10:53.600 --> 10:58.840
GNOME Shell 3.32, it's going to be shipping with Linux kernel 5.0, and a bunch of other

10:58.840 --> 11:05.640
new things. I've been running it for two months now, I think. A month and a half at least.

11:05.640 --> 11:10.520
And it's the fastest, most reliable GNOME experience I've ever had.

11:10.520 --> 11:16.560
And now they've reached this beta milestone, beta one. It's really looking ready to ship,

11:16.560 --> 11:17.560
isn't it?

11:17.560 --> 11:21.680
Yeah. We don't normally talk about betas on this show. But with Linux 5.0 in there and

11:21.680 --> 11:27.120
the new release of GNOME Shell, I think this is going to be a milestone release, like I

11:27.120 --> 11:30.840
said, of all of the distributions of this next generation of 2019.

11:30.840 --> 11:34.680
But it's not just the main version of Ubuntu, of course. All the other flavors have released

11:34.680 --> 11:42.720
their beta one of 19.04. But Ubuntu Mate has released a beta of 18.04 for the Raspberry

11:42.720 --> 11:43.720
Pi.

11:43.720 --> 11:47.200
And I've been checking this out and it's pretty solid. It's got hardware accelerated VLC,

11:47.200 --> 11:52.400
a proper Ubuntu kernel, so it's not sharing the Raspbian kernel like it used to. And that

11:52.400 --> 11:58.280
old 16.04 image was pretty neglected at this point. It didn't really work properly. Firefox

11:58.280 --> 12:02.800
wouldn't open and stuff. It was just broken. So it is good to see that that project hasn't

12:02.800 --> 12:08.040
been abandoned. And it's great to see that we've got a good competitor to Raspbian, which

12:08.040 --> 12:15.040
now is very mature and a really solid OS for the Raspberry Pi. But competition is always

12:15.040 --> 12:19.440
good and choice is always good. So I would say if you've got a Pi, definitely check it

12:19.440 --> 12:24.480
out. We'll have a link to it in the show notes, linuxactionnews.com slash 99. And stick it

12:24.480 --> 12:26.040
on your Raspberry Pi and see what you think.

12:26.040 --> 12:32.080
Yeah. I'd love to hear people's take on it. Also, ffmpeg got hardware assisted video decoding

12:32.080 --> 12:38.080
and encoding, which is huge on a device like this. That's a big deal. And something else

12:38.080 --> 12:42.800
that Martin included that I think is genius is Steam Link is available for install now

12:42.800 --> 12:48.940
on 1804 running Ubuntu Monte. That's great. I mean, it kind of makes me want to hook one

12:48.940 --> 12:55.760
up to my TV with VLC having hardware decoding and ffmpeg having hardware decoding and Steam

12:55.760 --> 13:00.960
Link. I don't know. That actually starts to turn into a pretty competitive media system

13:00.960 --> 13:01.960
too.

13:01.960 --> 13:05.400
The only issue, though, is that there's no acceleration in the browser yet. That's something

13:05.400 --> 13:10.840
he's been working on. But yeah, unfortunately, it's not there. So browsing is a bit of a

13:10.840 --> 13:15.640
painful experience. But if you're only looking to the media stuff with it, then it's pretty

13:15.640 --> 13:16.640
solid.

13:16.640 --> 13:22.800
Well, speaking of media stuff, the Ubuntu Studio flavor also was recognized again officially

13:22.800 --> 13:27.480
as a flavor. And two of the developers that applied for their upload rights to Ubuntu

13:27.480 --> 13:32.080
Studio's core packages received permission to do so. So business continues as usual.

13:32.080 --> 13:36.760
Yeah, there was some doubt about that because the team had changed and it just looked like

13:36.760 --> 13:40.720
it may lose its official status. But good to see they've managed to sort that out and

13:40.720 --> 13:41.720
it's going to continue.

13:41.720 --> 13:46.640
Well, speaking of business as usual, Red Hat continues to make money. It looks like they

13:46.640 --> 13:51.860
are finally crossing that three billion dollar revenue line. In fact, if you do the math,

13:51.860 --> 13:55.360
it is looking like it might be three point four billion dollars.

13:55.360 --> 14:00.080
Yeah, suddenly the IBM acquisition makes a lot more sense, doesn't it? I mean, as I said

14:00.080 --> 14:03.720
at the time, they didn't buy them for a laugh. They bought them because they're a money making

14:03.720 --> 14:04.720
machine.

14:04.720 --> 14:10.000
Yep, I completely agree. And who says that open source can't make any money? This is

14:10.000 --> 14:14.640
really something. And Jim Whitehurst, the CEO, attributes enterprise organizations as

14:14.640 --> 14:21.960
a continued source of growth as they convert their environments to hybrid cloud environments.

14:21.960 --> 14:26.520
Jim's favorite buzz term. And he also said their subscription service is up. It continues

14:26.520 --> 14:31.240
to grow. OpenStack and OpenShift continues to be an area of growth for them, even though

14:31.240 --> 14:35.960
the buzz is kind of those things are on their way out. And they're investing more into Kubernetes,

14:35.960 --> 14:42.160
as everyone says. But the final bit of information here, Joe, is that the deal with IBM is due

14:42.160 --> 14:48.080
to close in the second half of this year. So that means any time, I guess, between June

14:48.080 --> 14:52.360
and December 31st, it could be anywhere in there.

14:52.360 --> 14:57.080
Yeah, that's nice and vague. I wonder if it'll be before Thanksgiving or not.

14:57.080 --> 15:00.960
We should bet. I'll bet before. Do you want to take after or do you want to take before?

15:00.960 --> 15:02.640
Because I'm going to bet before Thanksgiving.

15:02.640 --> 15:05.560
I will bet after. I think it'll be right at the end of the year.

15:05.560 --> 15:10.080
Now I feel bad. Now I want the other bet. All right. Let's see. What should we bet?

15:10.080 --> 15:12.280
We got to bet something.

15:12.280 --> 15:17.680
I know what we can do. Whoever loses has to go first with the Bitcoin predictions.

15:17.680 --> 15:22.680
Okay. All right. Fair enough. Okay. All right. That seems fair. Okay. Well, let's talk about

15:22.680 --> 15:27.520
the big news out of LVFS. We love talking about the Linux vendor firmware service, think

15:27.520 --> 15:32.680
it's great for new users and potentially for servers in the future. But they have a big

15:32.680 --> 15:33.680
announcement this week.

15:33.680 --> 15:38.360
Yeah, they've joined the Linux Foundation. So yet another project that's done that.

15:38.360 --> 15:42.160
The way that the folks involved in the project that are talking about it, it sort of sounds

15:42.160 --> 15:50.120
like this is a way to vendor neutralize this fairly important service that could potentially

15:50.120 --> 15:55.200
in the future expand into updating the server space and become even more critical that it's

15:55.200 --> 16:02.280
vendor neutral. I think the concern was that by some it was seen as a Red Hat project.

16:02.280 --> 16:08.780
And I wouldn't also discount the long term Dell involvement with since the very beginning

16:08.780 --> 16:14.560
of this project. Even till now, Richard considers one of the Dell engineers has been involved

16:14.560 --> 16:21.840
Mario, like a co-creator of the project. He's been so involved. And they have a close relationship

16:21.840 --> 16:22.840
with the Linux Foundation.

16:22.840 --> 16:26.720
Well, there were two things that stood out about this to me. One is that the firmware

16:26.720 --> 16:31.200
files are distributed as cab files, which is just funny. But the other thing is that

16:31.200 --> 16:39.160
they have now reached 500,000 downloads per month from the LVFS project, which is a lot

16:39.160 --> 16:40.160
of machines.

16:40.160 --> 16:44.720
Yeah, that's in the last month. That's in the last month. And the other way to say that

16:44.720 --> 16:52.080
is 500,000 modern Linux desktops with machines that have updatable firmwares connected and

16:52.080 --> 16:56.440
updated. That's a decent chunk of people. Because not everybody's running the absolute

16:56.440 --> 17:00.680
latest stuff or using GNOME software very much. And not everybody has a machine that

17:00.680 --> 17:05.480
can be updated by LVFS yet. So I'm impressed with that number, especially for the last

17:05.480 --> 17:10.840
30 days. It seems like Richard was talking about this. It seems like whenever the project

17:10.840 --> 17:15.360
gets some news coverage, the downloads go up. And there's been a lot of news coverage

17:15.360 --> 17:16.800
around joining the Linux Foundation.

17:16.800 --> 17:20.600
Yeah, I suppose people start checking their software center and go, actually, I can update

17:20.600 --> 17:22.160
my various firmwares here.

17:22.160 --> 17:27.180
Yep. It's still open source. Richard's still at the helm. It's still a Python Flask project.

17:27.180 --> 17:32.520
You can still go get involved. It's just they're trying to make it vendor neutral now. And

17:32.520 --> 17:36.480
my reading of that is it's a positioning for a long term play.

17:36.480 --> 17:41.120
I think you need to have a service like this to gain wide industry adoption and to be taken

17:41.120 --> 17:46.280
seriously. And so joining the Linux Foundation kind of gives it that extra credibility as

17:46.280 --> 17:47.280
well.

17:47.280 --> 17:54.080
I don't know, Joe. Needs more blockchain, in my opinion. Joking, of course. I love LVFS.

17:54.080 --> 17:59.060
But speaking of in it for the long term, Handshake has been making a lot of donations to open

17:59.060 --> 18:05.280
source projects. And it appears kind of recently, rather quietly, they made a pretty significant

18:05.280 --> 18:07.080
contribution to Debian.

18:07.080 --> 18:13.200
Yeah, $300,000, which is an awful lot of money given that Debian usually gets an order of

18:13.200 --> 18:16.160
magnitude less than that donated to it every year.

18:16.160 --> 18:20.940
Yeah. And the project says, and I think this is very true, I'm very happy to see this,

18:20.940 --> 18:25.480
they say it's going to help them continue to replace old failing hardware. They have

18:25.480 --> 18:30.640
a whole migration plan that the Debian system administrators have written up, which includes

18:30.640 --> 18:35.800
reloading and renewing servers, replacing components, just making the workflow a little

18:35.800 --> 18:40.120
easier for their developers, which we've talked about recently on some of our shows. That

18:40.120 --> 18:44.520
all sounds like very, very positive long term improvements to the project.

18:44.520 --> 18:48.360
And because they've been contributing to all these different projects over the last year

18:48.360 --> 18:52.160
or so, you hear about Handshake a lot, but you might not remember what it is. Just a

18:52.160 --> 18:58.640
quick recap. It's a decentralized permissionless naming protocol that is, guess what, compatible

18:58.640 --> 19:05.200
with DNS. And the idea is taking away root DNS servers that are centrally controlled

19:05.200 --> 19:10.520
and moving it to a peer to peer system that is, as you also guessed, powered by blockchain.

19:10.520 --> 19:15.440
However, it does seem to be a very cool project. And I do like the idea of decentralized root

19:15.440 --> 19:19.680
DNS servers that is still completely compatible with the DNS protocol. That seems pretty clever

19:19.680 --> 19:20.680
to me.

19:20.680 --> 19:25.120
That wasn't clear to me whether these donations to the various free software projects had

19:25.120 --> 19:30.680
been in actual cash, or whether it just been in cryptocurrencies. But doing a little bit

19:30.680 --> 19:35.200
of digging, it seems that it is cash, they will be getting some cryptocurrency as well.

19:35.200 --> 19:38.760
But this 300,000 is actual cash, by the looks of things.

19:38.760 --> 19:44.600
Oh, huh. Yeah, we had tried to get that answered in the past by various projects that have

19:44.600 --> 19:49.280
been involved with contributions. And they were a little reluctant to answer that before.

19:49.280 --> 19:50.960
So it's a combo thing.

19:50.960 --> 19:55.620
By the looks of things, I mean, it's not completely clear. But from digging around and watching

19:55.620 --> 19:59.200
various YouTube videos and reading various articles, that's the conclusion I've come

19:59.200 --> 20:03.520
to. But it would be good to get some clarification from the various projects.

20:03.520 --> 20:08.760
That's true. They say USD, but they could just be saying in value of. Handshake writes

20:08.760 --> 20:14.280
that they've gifted nearly $10.2 million to various floss projects. And they say it's

20:14.280 --> 20:21.760
10.2 million in USD. They're not saying crypto. Although I think famously a lot of their initial

20:21.760 --> 20:25.720
funding did come from various crypto sources. So I think that's where some of the speculation

20:25.720 --> 20:26.720
comes from.

20:26.720 --> 20:32.640
Yeah. It's funny that this money is essentially investment that they needed to enable them

20:32.640 --> 20:38.320
to have a valuation that was true, but they didn't actually need that investment. So they

20:38.320 --> 20:45.120
decided to re-gift it at $10 million. It's a lot of money. And I suppose who's to complain?

20:45.120 --> 20:50.040
All these free software projects are benefiting from it. But it just seems all a bit strange,

20:50.040 --> 20:51.040
doesn't it?

20:51.040 --> 20:55.800
Mm-hmm. But they really picked some good projects. You can search the tags on our site. Just

20:55.800 --> 21:00.620
search the site for Handshake. And there's lots of great projects they've been contributing

21:00.620 --> 21:05.760
to now. So they keep picking good ones. And Debian absolutely could put that money to

21:05.760 --> 21:14.320
good use. And that's nothing to sneeze at, 300,000 US greenbacks. So at this point, I

21:14.320 --> 21:18.600
don't know if a blockchain-based DNS, a decentralized thing is ever going to take off, but hats

21:18.600 --> 21:21.640
off to Handshake for their awesome contributions to the community.

21:21.640 --> 21:25.800
Yeah, definitely. Well, before we get out of here, a quick mention for the UK Open Source

21:25.800 --> 21:33.160
Awards 2019. And this is happening on the 12th of June in Edinburgh. And it's not just

21:33.160 --> 21:37.080
the awards, it's kind of an afternoon into evening event where there'll be some speakers

21:37.080 --> 21:38.640
and it's kind of a conference as well.

21:38.640 --> 21:44.180
Right. And you can still nominate, they say categories are five and it's companies or

21:44.180 --> 21:49.000
individuals which in the last year have shown exceptional innovation in free and open source

21:49.000 --> 21:54.200
software. And they have different categories for like public, company, individual, etc.

21:54.200 --> 21:57.600
Link as always in the show notes or in your podcast player of choice.

21:57.600 --> 22:01.840
I'd like to go up there for this, but I'm not sure about scheduling yet. So fingers

22:01.840 --> 22:02.840
crossed on that one.

22:02.840 --> 22:08.800
Hmm. It probably depends if they're going to have an open bar or not.

22:08.800 --> 22:09.800
Very good point.

22:09.800 --> 22:13.400
