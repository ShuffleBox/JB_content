00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,480
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, episode 113, recorded on July 7th, 2019.

2
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:10,480
I'm Chris.

3
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:11,480
And I'm Joe.

4
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:12,480
Hello, Joe.

5
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:13,480
Good to be connected with you.

6
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:17,640
We kick off today's show with a couple of really important releases, starting with Debian

7
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:18,640
10 Buster.

8
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:23,240
Yeah, this is 25 months in development, and it's going to be supported for five years

9
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:24,240
as well.

10
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:25,800
So this is a pretty big deal.

11
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:30,520
Yeah, Buster ships with several desktop applications and environments ready to go.

12
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:34,680
Cinnamon 3.8, GNOME 3.30, Plasma 5.14.

13
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:43,840
Of course, Joe's favorite, Xfce 4.12, Mate 1.20, as well as LXQt 14 and LXDE 0.99.2.

14
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:49,600
But we default to GNOME with Buster, and that is now on top of Wayland instead of Xorg.

15
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:55,000
Yeah, which is kind of surprising, because Debian is traditionally very conservative.

16
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,880
But if even Debian think that Wayland is ready for mainstream, then what does that tell you?

17
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:04,120
Is X just dead, finally?

18
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:08,160
I don't know, man, because I installed the Xfce edition when I tried out Buster, and

19
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:09,160
so I was using Xorg.

20
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:11,040
So it's not dead for me.

21
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:14,880
I actually gave two different goes at Debian 10.

22
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:19,560
They have the live ISOs you can download, which are full live environments in a DVD.

23
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:22,720
I grabbed, obviously, the Xfce one, but they have others.

24
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:24,680
And then they have the net installs.

25
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:28,120
I chose to try out Buster using both install methods.

26
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:29,280
Did you get a chance to try it?

27
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:31,760
Yeah, I went for the network install.

28
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:36,420
And it was a bit fiddly, because I had to get the blob for my wireless card.

29
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:41,520
But once I sorted that out, it was just plain sailing, really, super quick.

30
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:42,520
And just Debian.

31
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:43,520
I mean, that's the thing.

32
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:46,820
It's not massively different from the last one, is it?

33
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:48,880
It's just updated and just Debian.

34
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:51,760
There's a couple of notable differences I'll touch on here in a second.

35
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:56,560
But from my install experiences, I'm going to recommend people use the net install.

36
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:58,860
You get a graphical installer either way.

37
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:03,520
The one in the live environment is laid out slightly different than the graphical one

38
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:05,080
for the net install.

39
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:09,480
But it's perfectly functional, and it boots right into that graphical net installer right

40
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:10,480
away.

41
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:11,960
So that's definitely the way to go.

42
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:13,840
And then you can choose your desktop and all of that stuff.

43
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:18,980
But OK, Joe, here's a couple of the things that are different since version 9.

44
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:23,320
For those of you that are in a security-focused environment, AppArmor, which is mandatory

45
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:29,160
access controls for restricting programs capabilities, is now installed and enabled by default.

46
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:36,280
Also, thanks to the reproducible builds project, over 91% of the source packages in Debian

47
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:42,400
10 will build bit for bit identically to the binary packages, which is, as you know, a

48
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:47,320
very important feature to verify the source and to protect against, say, malicious attempts

49
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:51,960
to tamper with software in between the original source and the end user.

50
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:54,240
Yeah, and it also has Secure Boot this time around.

51
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:56,920
Yeah, and a total of 10 architectures are now supported.

52
00:02:56,920 --> 00:03:01,680
Not all of them support Secure Boot, but Debian itself now supports 10 total architectures.

53
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:04,580
Yeah, it really is the universal operating system.

54
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:09,080
But what I meant by it being the same old Debian is, although there's been some pretty

55
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:15,520
major changes with that security stuff, the actual end user experience hasn't changed

56
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:17,480
much at all, really.

57
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:18,640
And I see that as good.

58
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:24,060
If you are familiar with Debian and how it all works, the install is the same.

59
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:29,920
The end product is, well, the GNOME that I had was just basically just stock GNOME 3.30.

60
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:33,140
It feels just like Debian.

61
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:36,120
I also tried out the Mate edition, which is perfectly fine and functional.

62
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:40,460
And the XFCE edition does have Edwardia Dark installed by default.

63
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:44,560
My walkaway impression from that was, this is the perfect desktop for Joe, because it's

64
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,580
going to be supported for five years.

65
00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:51,400
And when they do an upgrade, you just get exactly what you expect.

66
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:55,820
And with someone like yourself who runs a desktop that isn't updated super frequently,

67
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:59,260
you pair that with a base operating system like Debian.

68
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:03,640
I'm not clear on why you're not using this as your daily driver, actually.

69
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:04,760
And you're not a big gamer either.

70
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:07,600
So some of the gaming poles to Ubuntu aren't there for you.

71
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:12,880
Well, I think what it is, right now, I could happily use Debian 10 Buster, no problem.

72
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:19,000
But in a few years, it starts to feel a bit, even for me, a bit old and stale.

73
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,560
Some of the applications just get left behind.

74
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:25,360
And new features come along that I actually want.

75
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:32,080
And for me, upgrading every couple of years with Ubuntu, a few months kind of behind the

76
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:35,720
release, that feels like a good cadence for me.

77
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:39,840
And I can cope with, say, two, two and a half year old software.

78
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,920
But then I need to upgrade.

79
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:45,240
I suppose I could do that with Debian as well.

80
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:50,360
But I don't know, I'm just kind of stuck in this Ubuntu rut now.

81
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:52,120
And well, it's not even a rut.

82
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:54,780
I'm happily in that rut, if you know what I mean.

83
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:57,720
And so I just don't really feel the need to change.

84
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:02,720
But I could happily use Debian if Ubuntu just disappeared overnight.

85
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:07,440
Another way to put rut is you found a really good workflow that's just working perfectly

86
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,440
fine for you.

87
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:12,240
There's no reason to toss the whole thing up in the air on a lark.

88
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,240
I get that.

89
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:14,240
Yeah, I get that.

90
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:17,720
Well, I'm interested that I didn't try out the Xfce version, because traditionally, it's

91
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:21,160
just been a very stock Xfce, which is really ugly.

92
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:24,200
So I do need to check it out if they've actually themed it nicely this time.

93
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:25,200
Oh, no, not by default.

94
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,200
No.

95
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,200
Oh, right, right, right.

96
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,200
No, it's quite ugly.

97
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:29,200
It's quite ugly.

98
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:31,160
But it takes only just a few moments to tweak it.

99
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:35,240
I guess your point, though, is taken when you said that it's almost too far on that

100
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:41,200
slow spectrum, and you could jump on that upgrade cycle when the new, say, Debian 11

101
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:42,200
ships.

102
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:47,320
But Ubuntu does sort of have that sweet spot for you where you get a lot of those advantages.

103
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:52,720
But if you need to pull in a PPA or a snap for that one thing, like, say, Telegram or

104
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:57,520
Firefox that you want super current, because as an example, Debian 10 ships with the ESR

105
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:58,520
version of Firefox.

106
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:02,000
And that could be a great use case of you probably want the most current version of

107
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,480
Firefox if possible, where you do strike that balance with Ubuntu.

108
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:09,440
And that, in part, is why Fedora has worked so well for me, because it's even further

109
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,960
up on that scale, but it's not at the arch level.

110
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:17,280
It's curated still, it's release based, but it's very current packaging, very clean system.

111
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:23,720
And so for me, Fedora has been that sort of perfect spot on the package current spectrum.

112
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:26,600
And I can see where, for you, Ubuntu is a little bit further down, and then Debian

113
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:28,280
is much, much further down on that spectrum.

114
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:34,120
Yeah, well, you could argue that Ubuntu interim releases are similar to Fedora in that way.

115
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:40,520
But I'm kind of Ubuntu LTS, and we've been kind of talking about it as if ignoring the

116
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:41,520
interim releases.

117
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:48,880
But yeah, I could happily recommend Fedora or, at the moment, 19.04 Ubuntu to some people,

118
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:50,760
but I'm just that bit more conservative.

119
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:53,600
But yeah, Debian, I think, is just too conservative for me.

120
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:56,760
But I can see some people who I would highly recommend it for.

121
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:59,280
And I know a bunch of people do use it happily.

122
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:06,360
Yeah, especially the people that I'm thinking of like all of the things about Debian that

123
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:07,560
maybe others might not like.

124
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:08,880
They like the slow pace.

125
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:11,560
They like the simple rate of change.

126
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:15,600
There's a school district nearby here that has workstations that are set up on Debian

127
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:16,960
with XFCE.

128
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:23,240
And for the most part, those systems have gone unchanged for nearly a decade now.

129
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:28,860
We've kept upgrading them, but there's been no massive change to the staff's workflow

130
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:29,860
in nearly a decade.

131
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:35,100
These systems are so old, but yet they're just barely under that 64-bit line or across

132
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:36,100
that 64-bit line.

133
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:38,820
So you could just keep going at it until they die.

134
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:40,700
That's how they treat them at the school districts.

135
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:47,560
And for them, XFCE on Debian has been the go-to stack now for that entire time.

136
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:49,300
And I don't think they're complaining yet.

137
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:54,240
Things could change for Debian when it comes to how they handle code names in the future.

138
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:57,280
This is not really related to the release of Debian, but we'll have a link in the show

139
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:04,120
notes if you're familiar with Debian's sources.list file where it pulls down its different packages

140
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:05,520
from different sources.

141
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:09,440
There's always kind of been a naming scheme in there for stable or testing, and there's

142
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:14,460
discussions right now about maybe tweaking that to be specific to a release or maybe

143
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:15,460
a date-based thing.

144
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:20,640
It's evolving into a much larger conversation, LWN, as always, has a fantastic write-up that

145
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:22,640
if you're interested, we'll have a link in the show notes.

146
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:26,560
Yeah, and I was reading through that agreeing with a lot of it, so yeah, highly recommended.

147
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:27,560
Yeah, me too.

148
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:28,560
I was like, you know what?

149
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:32,560
As somebody who tangentially uses Debian, I am so in this line of thinking.

150
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:36,960
Now, for those of you on Chromebooks, there's been a really important release for you this

151
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:37,960
week.

152
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:42,280
Yeah, Gallium OS 3.0 has been released, and I've been waiting for this for a long time.

153
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:49,760
I've got an old C720, the Acer Chromebook, which is a perfectly functional laptop.

154
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:56,040
And that was stuck on the old version of Gallium OS 2.0, which was based on Ubuntu, well, Zubuntu

155
00:08:56,040 --> 00:09:01,160
really, 16.04, and now we've finally got an 18.04 version.

156
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:02,800
And so I have upgraded to that.

157
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:05,760
Well, I actually did it just a new compave, it was just easier.

158
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:09,160
And well, a bit like Debian, it's not really changed much.

159
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:13,880
It's just based on 18.04 now, and otherwise works really well.

160
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:18,080
Yeah, they really kind of billed themselves as doing a lot of work under the hood.

161
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:22,440
So the desktop environment, they pitch as an attractive full-featured desktop, which

162
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:25,400
is based around XFCE, surprisingly.

163
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:27,180
But it's under the hood that matters.

164
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:31,200
They have a touchpad driver optimized for Chromebooks, kernel schedulers that are optimized

165
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:36,640
for the type of CPU in Chromebooks, and they have SSD patches for particular types of Chrome

166
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:41,400
devices that need them that other distros don't have, and then they have, quote, fixes

167
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:47,800
for dozens of device-specific bugs, end quote, all while requiring less memory and disk space

168
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:50,640
than a typical Linux distro install.

169
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:53,720
So it's pretty competitive for these devices, and there's so many of these, like the one

170
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:55,720
you have and many, many, many more out there.

171
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:59,920
They have a ton of devices that they support, link in the show notes, and you can try it

172
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:04,200
out in a live environment, and you can also dual boot, so you don't even have to nuke

173
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,520
Chrome OS if you don't want.

174
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:10,200
Yeah, and you can pick up some of these older Chromebooks for next to nothing now, and my

175
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:14,920
one's only got two gigabytes of RAM, so it's kind of a bit limited, but if you look inside

176
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:20,520
it, it's almost all battery, and the battery life, mine has started to fade now, but when

177
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:25,520
I first picked it up secondhand, pretty cheap, I think I paid about 80 pounds for it or something.

178
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:26,520
Wow.

179
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:28,080
The battery life was amazing.

180
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:31,960
It was just a perfect little media machine and browsing machine.

181
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:33,040
Yeah, like seven hours.

182
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,040
I had one too.

183
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:35,640
I got like seven hours out of it.

184
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:40,160
Yeah, exactly, which is like premium laptop style, and if all you're doing is a bit of

185
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:45,360
web browsing and stuff, but you want that extra kind of functionality that you get with

186
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:51,280
proper GNU slash Linux rather than Chrome OS, then gallium OS is just a no-brainer

187
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:55,960
as far as I'm concerned, so it's great to see that the project is still going and still

188
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:56,960
releasing.

189
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:57,960
Absolutely.

190
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:02,200
I'll just add, it makes for a great homework workstation because you can get actual Libre

191
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:07,160
Office on this thing, and yeah, it's getting there now with Chromebooks and Chrome OS,

192
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:09,600
but this is the real deal, so we'll have a link there.

193
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:13,760
Check it out because it's so lightweight, they're so inexpensive that if you've got

194
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:18,400
kids and you're worried about them damaging the machine, this is a little bit safer on

195
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:19,400
the pocketbook.

196
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:24,160
It's a little bit easier to swallow when an $80 Chromebook gets destroyed versus like

197
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:25,400
a $900 laptop.

198
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:30,320
Well, I suppose regardless of which laptop you use, you probably, if you're listening

199
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:34,880
to this show, like to stay current with the news, and Mozilla has a new service that they're

200
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:36,400
hoping will pique your interest.

201
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:40,880
Yeah, the first I heard about this was in our Slack when Drew from our team posted that

202
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:48,800
he had seen this pop up and offer this $5 a month ad-free news subscription, but then

203
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:52,680
when you actually click through, it turns out that they haven't launched it yet and

204
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:56,520
they're just trying to gauge interest with a survey, but it seems that this popped up

205
00:11:56,520 --> 00:12:00,480
for quite a few people because it certainly did the rounds in the tech press.

206
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:06,560
Yeah, this comes not long after Apple began offering Apple News+, which is $10 per month,

207
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:10,800
and I think others are working on similar solutions.

208
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:14,600
It appears Mozilla is working with Scroll.

209
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:15,600
Scroll is still in beta.

210
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:19,640
It doesn't even have open signups yet, but the company says it offers an ad-free access

211
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:24,640
to a variety of websites including BuzzFeed, Slate, Gizmodo, Media Group Properties, and

212
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:26,360
Vox Media sites.

213
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:31,480
And I think the kind of pitch to this particular news service is not only do you get ad-free

214
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:36,840
access to the news sites, but the service will actually read the news, like they have

215
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:42,400
a supposedly human sounding voice that reads the news to you and supports cross-platform

216
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:45,460
syncing of the news articles that you've read.

217
00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:49,520
That's their value pitch and Mozilla would probably white label this as the assumption

218
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:52,560
and offer it as part of their overall bundling.

219
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:56,000
I have a lot of thoughts on this, Joe, but I'm kind of curious to know what your first

220
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
takes are.

221
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,600
Well, my first thought was, ah, so they're going to add this to the VPN thing as well

222
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:01,600
then.

223
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:05,720
So we're slowly starting to see this drip feed of the services, plural, that they're

224
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:06,720
going to offer.

225
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:10,440
And as for news, I don't know really.

226
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:16,760
I think that $5 a month is not very much, but how much do you actually get for that?

227
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:22,080
Whereas you compare it with Apple, which is, what, $10 a month and you get a whole bunch

228
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:23,080
more.

229
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:27,120
It's magazine subscriptions, essentially, which I've actually found to be valuable.

230
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:32,240
I subscribed to Linux format, Outsider, Car and Driver, and a couple of other magazines

231
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:37,840
now that I never would have read if there wasn't for some way for me to do it on a display

232
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:41,680
that is super high resolution and makes it really lazy to push a button.

233
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:46,640
I might do the same for Mozilla's and drop Apple's if it was competitive, but part of

234
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:51,740
me at the same time has questions about really trying to monetize news as a service that

235
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:55,600
feels dirty to me and also feels unnecessary.

236
00:13:55,600 --> 00:14:03,160
Because there's so many ways to get news between aggregators, Google's news site, Twitter,

237
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:08,040
all of the established news outlets that have been around for 10, 20, 30 years.

238
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:10,900
There's so many ways to get news.

239
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:14,560
Who's like, oh man, I wish somebody would just put all this together in one spot for

240
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:15,560
me.

241
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:16,560
Really?

242
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:17,560
That's what an RSS reader does.

243
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:22,360
Well, obviously not for our audience, I don't think, because also podcasts are a great way

244
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:27,400
to digest important news and it's an established medium that's obviously successful.

245
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:31,280
I guess I would give it a go, but I'm a bit of a news hound because of our line of work.

246
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:36,160
I would take issue with that it feels dirty to try and monetize news because it's being

247
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:39,440
monetized by tracking and adverts at the moment.

248
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:42,720
And surely a subscription service is a way better way to do it.

249
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,200
Yeah, fair point.

250
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:49,840
I guess really that comment comes from some sort of idealist news should be a loss.

251
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:53,720
It should be something you do as a public service.

252
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:57,280
We've taken dramatic efforts to take advertising out of this show.

253
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:59,040
This is an ad free show.

254
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:04,280
I think it's important, but I appreciate that it's just not possible as somebody who has

255
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:05,880
also been on the other side of that.

256
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:10,460
I understand and Mozilla would be a trusted source and your point's taken, I would prefer

257
00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:12,100
it over tracking.

258
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:16,840
Did you also see though that another little bit of information, we got kind of some brand

259
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:20,440
name now for the Firefox VPN service?

260
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:23,400
Yeah, Firefox Private Network, FPN.

261
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:25,880
It's a bit like a VPN, eh?

262
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:32,040
Yeah, and they appear to be teasing three different price tiers right now, $5, $10,

263
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:34,160
or $13 per month.

264
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:40,300
There's been some ads online and in a podcast I listened to, Radio Lab, they recently had

265
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:42,960
an ad for the new Firefox services.

266
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:46,760
It never even mentioned the fact that Firefox was a web browser.

267
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:49,680
I think I might dig that clip up and play it in this week's Linux Unplugged if I can

268
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:50,680
find it.

269
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:51,960
Because it was like a surreal moment.

270
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:58,480
I'm hearing an ad for Firefox on a podcast and it's nothing about what Firefox does.

271
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:00,080
So they're really making a fast pivot.

272
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:03,840
Before they've even got everything lined up, before everything's done and finalized, they're

273
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:05,680
already advertising the service.

274
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:08,000
They're trying to move quick on this.

275
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,640
And hearing that ad in that podcast, it struck me.

276
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:15,880
Not only was it, again, nothing about what Firefox actually does, but it was advertising

277
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:19,820
something that does not exist.

278
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:20,820
It's not yet done.

279
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:22,400
In fact, it's not even complete.

280
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:23,400
They don't have final pricing.

281
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:28,940
They don't even have the whole thing put together yet, but they're already advertising it.

282
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:34,560
That to me indicates that they're trying to move really quick and they're, in probably

283
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:38,760
a very calculated way, putting the cart before the horse and deciding, we got to get out

284
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:42,880
there on the messaging and start this rebranding, start talking about this even before everything's

285
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:44,160
lined up.

286
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:45,480
I think that's really fascinating.

287
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:51,680
It is a very aggressive approach and I wonder if it will backfire on them because my rule

288
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:57,320
of thumb, and okay, I'm not the greatest marketer in the world, but my rule is do the thing,

289
00:16:57,320 --> 00:17:00,960
then talk about the thing, or at least have it ready to go.

290
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:05,920
If you start building too much hype too soon, then it could potentially be a letdown, whereas

291
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:12,480
if it's like, hey, here's this service, have at it, then it feels harder to disappoint

292
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:13,680
people that way.

293
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:14,680
I can see that.

294
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:20,260
I think maybe it's about steering a brand into a new direction that's been known for

295
00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:25,320
one thing for so long, and they feel like to get people to see it as something else,

296
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:28,040
it's going to take years, so might as well get started now.

297
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:30,520
Maybe that's it, or maybe there's something they're trying to get out ahead of.

298
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:35,240
Maybe some source of, this is all speculation, who knows, but maybe some source of income,

299
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:36,840
or who knows?

300
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:38,880
They seem like they're trying to get ahead of this thing in a big way.

301
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:45,360
I'm kind of really fascinated to see how they pull it off, and there's hints of maybe this

302
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:49,520
is something that could really work for me, but their timing's a little bad too, to be

303
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:50,520
honest with you.

304
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:51,720
They needed to do this two years ago.

305
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:56,480
Yeah, or maybe a year ago when people started to really wake up to privacy and tracking

306
00:17:56,480 --> 00:18:00,360
and stuff and VPNs really took off.

307
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:03,880
So it does feel a little bit late, but if they do it correctly, they do have that brand

308
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:09,280
power that maybe it'll take off, but it'll be very interesting to see it.

309
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:15,560
But meanwhile this week, they were called out, Mozilla, as a villain by the ISPA, which

310
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:23,920
is an industry body that represents ISPs in the UK, and this is some serious, serious

311
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:25,380
Streisand effect.

312
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:31,080
This is great because Mozilla is a bad guy because they're introducing a way to bypass

313
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:32,080
government filtering.

314
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:38,220
So they're not a bad guy because they're doing monitoring and filtering and spying, they're

315
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:44,000
a bad guy because they're creating tools to undermine filtering and monitoring, and it's

316
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,800
all because of the children, Joe.

317
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:50,680
So this is from the Internet Services Providers Association, and they write on their site,

318
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:56,320
ironically, they are pleased to announce the finalist for the 2019 Internet Hero and Villain

319
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:57,680
Awards.

320
00:18:57,680 --> 00:19:02,220
And this is following, they write, weeks of consultation and large range of nominations

321
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:05,480
received via email and Twitter from the public.

322
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:09,520
Well, I'm satisfied, Joe.

323
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:15,560
It's interesting that they put Mozilla alongside Article 13 and President Donald Trump.

324
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:20,160
I better not say anything about the last one, but I think we can all agree that Article

325
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:25,000
13 was something of a misstep by the European Commission.

326
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:30,760
So it's just weird, but I think this has really just shone a light on the fact that Mozilla

327
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:39,880
is introducing DNSR over HTTPS, something that probably not that many people knew about,

328
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:45,320
and people will be looking into now and finding guides on how to enable it.

329
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:47,920
And so it's just spectacularly backfired for the ISPA.

330
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:53,120
It has, and what's great is they've been called out on it and then they've doubled down on

331
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:54,120
it.

332
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:55,560
And they just sound ridiculous.

333
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:56,560
They sound like fear mongers.

334
00:19:56,560 --> 00:20:02,560
They write, the debate over DNS over HTTPS is evidently a topic that polarizes opinion,

335
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:04,680
a.k.a. people are disagreeing with us.

336
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:06,520
However, our position is clear.

337
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:12,320
The ISPA believes that bringing in DNS over HTTPS by default would be harmful for online

338
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:16,560
safety, cybersecurity, and consumer choice.

339
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:25,060
They never actually say how or why, although we can speculate that the filtering is online

340
00:20:25,060 --> 00:20:29,760
safety and cybersecurity is the monitoring aspect that it's preventing.

341
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:39,560
In a nutshell, what HTTP over DNS is, or DOH, is simply sending your DNS requests over HTTPS

342
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:43,480
at the application level to a predefined host.

343
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:44,680
That's the technology.

344
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:49,720
Additionally, the applications you use that look up a name online, as you likely know,

345
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:51,760
are using your system's DNS.

346
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:57,760
And that's configured in most home cases to be your ISP or whatever your corporate server

347
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:59,480
is, et cetera, et cetera.

348
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:05,400
But with DNS over HTTPS, it's controlled at the application level.

349
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:10,320
So Firefox could be using an entirely different DNS server than Chrome is using, which is

350
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:13,800
also building support for DNS over HTTPS.

351
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:18,280
Because it's at the application level, it can be baked in or it can be user defined.

352
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:20,640
It all depends on the application.

353
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:24,720
As a complete aside, it's funny that the ISPA site is so bad.

354
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:29,360
Not only have they not specified a background color, so you've got gray text on a gray background

355
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:35,640
for me with my weird Firefox profile that's messed up, but also you've got this really

356
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:39,560
annoying pop up about cookies that you just can't get rid of.

357
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:45,400
And on a desktop, it's not too bad, but on my phone, it took up a major part of the screen

358
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:46,800
and I was just infuriating.

359
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:48,960
Normally, okay, they pop up, they're annoying.

360
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:50,360
You click yes, go away, whatever.

361
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:52,720
But this just wouldn't let you get rid of it.

362
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:54,840
So so annoying.

363
00:21:54,840 --> 00:22:00,120
I'm pretty sure we're going to dig more into DNS over HTTPS because we've been experimenting

364
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:01,120
a little bit.

365
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:07,700
I'll just say members on our team have come up with ways to use DNS over HTTPS to say,

366
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:10,980
get internet access while on a plane without having to pay for the extremely expensive

367
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:12,600
internet service.

368
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:19,280
The way DOH hides DNS queries inside a regular HTTPS traffic means that third party observers

369
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:24,160
are unable to sniff that traffic and tell what the DNS queries are, where they're going,

370
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:28,320
et cetera, and redirect them or capture them or even just monitor them, right?

371
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:30,000
There's a lot of vulnerabilities in DNS.

372
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,720
It's over plain text.

373
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:33,440
It's something that's easily intercepted.

374
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:35,080
It's something that's easily observed.

375
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:36,200
This changes all of that.

376
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:37,480
That's the advantage.

377
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:41,320
The downside is it all comes to the implementation.

378
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:47,520
It could be very easy to have every Firefox user's DNS over HTTPS traffic all going to

379
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:52,840
Cloudflare and now Cloudflare has got millions and millions of Firefox users data, at least

380
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:54,040
for their DNS queries.

381
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:58,920
So there are downsides, but how it's implemented is separate from how the technology actually

382
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:03,880
works, because you could set up your own proxy on a VPS somewhere and just use it yourself.

383
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:05,520
That's what we've been doing internally for testing.

384
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:07,520
Yeah, I was going to mention Cloudflare.

385
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:11,040
That is unfortunate, and it's, to be honest, what I thought this was about at first, that

386
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:14,620
they were pointing that, oh, they're putting it all through Cloudflare, but no, they don't

387
00:23:14,620 --> 00:23:15,620
even care about that.

388
00:23:15,620 --> 00:23:21,200
It's just the fact that Mozilla are potentially helping people get around blocks, but Mozilla

389
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:24,600
have said that they're not implementing it by default anyway.

390
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:27,560
So it's just something that users can do if they want to.

391
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:31,800
But yeah, we're going to definitely have to talk more about this plane situation because

392
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:36,160
I've got a couple of plane flights coming up where that'll be very useful to me.

393
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:39,840
Yes, it is super, super useful when you've got something urgent you just need to send

394
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:45,360
off a message and you know it's capable, but they're blocking it some way artificially.

395
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:52,680
I think also what Mozilla's statement was is that DNS over HTTPS would not be enabled

396
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:55,200
by default in the UK.

397
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:58,720
Now that might mean everywhere, but the spokesperson for Mozilla specifically said it would not

398
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:01,120
be enabled in the UK.

399
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:05,920
It may still happen here in the US and Google's also a big proponent of this.

400
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:11,880
They see it as a way to bypass filtering and restrictions and get more people onto their

401
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:12,880
services.

402
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:16,840
So Google's really into this and Mozilla sees it as a way to prevent censorship and filtering.

403
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:23,800
So both browsers seem to be really near implementation and it's not clear which will be on by default

404
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:24,800
and which won't.

405
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:28,080
Well, I have a feeling I might well be implementing it at some point in the future.

406
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:33,880
Yeah, I want to implement my own, but I'm not necessarily keen on a lot of applications

407
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:37,000
doing this because this isn't just a web browser technology.

408
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,160
Any application could do this.

409
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:44,160
Telegram could bake this in Skype and there is a reason to have system level DNS and network

410
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:45,160
level DNS.

411
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:50,000
There's benefits to every application on your system talking to the same name resolution

412
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,000
servers.

413
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:56,400
It could get wonky for end users and produce unexpected results when maybe half your applications

414
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:58,960
are talking to different DNS servers.

415
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:04,920
I know they have ways to build in some accommodations for that, but Firefox is a pretty solid accommodation

416
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:07,680
system for that very scenario and it's still not perfect.

417
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:11,360
It does feel like early days for this, but it seems to be inevitable that this is the

418
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:12,360
way we're all going to go.

419
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:15,440
And I'm sure that these problems will get ironed out one way or another.

420
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:21,600
You know what else is inevitable is I still feel like the fuchsia bomb is inevitable.

421
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:26,400
And this week that just got turned up like a whole nother notch, Joe.

422
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,440
I'm legitimately concerned about fuchsia.

423
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:33,560
Yeah, this is Google's alternative OS that they've very seldom spoken about.

424
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:37,660
We've heard little snippets here and there and mostly the code has done the talking.

425
00:25:37,660 --> 00:25:43,280
It's been in public repos and it's permissively licensed and essentially an alternative to

426
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:44,280
Linux.

427
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:45,280
Right.

428
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:48,400
The public first found out about fuchsia in August of 2016 when they dumped a whole bunch

429
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:49,400
of code.

430
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:52,760
They dumped a whole bunch of code over the wall on GitHub and everything that we know

431
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:57,440
about it really is either from a couple of statements by Google engineers, some early

432
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:03,760
on that were incredibly in depth and others that have been in like Google IO keynotes

433
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:04,760
and whatnot.

434
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:09,440
But when you look at the actual source code, it sort of does all of the talking.

435
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:15,040
It is clear that there is a lot being built here to make it the next generation Android

436
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:16,840
with all kinds of devices.

437
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:21,960
People will kind of talk about it as an IoT operating system, but so much of the tech

438
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:25,520
in this is built for creating great desktop experiences.

439
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:28,680
And when you look at the fact that one of their target devices is an Intel NUC, which

440
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:32,360
is a desktop device, that doesn't seem like an IoT thing.

441
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:37,440
Yeah, this is clearly about more than just IoT and more than just phones and desktops

442
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:38,440
even.

443
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:43,800
And so now you can go to fuchsia.dev and actually learn a fair bit about it.

444
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:47,440
They haven't specified a background color for a part of it, so I'm annoyed about that.

445
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:53,680
But apart from that, it is a good resource to kind of see where they want to go with

446
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:54,680
this.

447
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:58,480
And if they're going to continue to do this Android style throw over the wall, it means

448
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:05,200
they're going to be in control of it potentially forever, or at least have significant control

449
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:06,200
over it.

450
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:10,360
So the topic of fuchsia really almost deserves its own dedicated show because there's so

451
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:15,200
much going on here, because there's a lot happening around fuchsia that makes it viable

452
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:16,200
down the road.

453
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:22,800
For example, the adoption of Go and Flutter are technologies that are at home on fuchsia.

454
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:27,720
And when fuchsia launches as a general available OS, these developers will be ready to pick

455
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:28,720
up and get going.

456
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:33,640
In fact, fuchsia also supports running Python and Rust as well as a bunch of other languages.

457
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:39,040
But one of the really strong appeals to it is this process model where essentially everything

458
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:40,220
is isolated.

459
00:27:40,220 --> 00:27:44,760
You can do away with containers now because it's just integrated into the way the operating

460
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:46,280
system works.

461
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:49,560
Even the file systems themselves live entirely within user space.

462
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:54,440
They're not linked or loaded to the kernel, they're just simply user space processes that

463
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:59,680
can be implemented as servers that other processes can then attach to.

464
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:03,520
And they talk about you can do total modifications of these file systems and it's just a matter

465
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:07,840
of killing a process and relaunching them, forget rebooting your operating system.

466
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:11,960
And then you have the GPU driver architecture, which is called Magma.

467
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:18,960
And these are also drivers that do not execute inside the kernel, but again, user space processes.

468
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:21,620
And Magma is designed around Vulkan.

469
00:28:21,620 --> 00:28:28,360
And so you've got a lot of modern technologies that are kind of in a way, it's like Google

470
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:32,960
looked at all of the mistakes and compromises they made with Android and Chrome OS and said

471
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:38,640
to themselves, if we took every lesson we learned and built a new operating system,

472
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:43,160
where we controlled it completely, even if it's open source, they're still doing the

473
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:45,020
over the wall approach.

474
00:28:45,020 --> 00:28:50,720
And we build up an entire ecosystem around Go and Flutter and Dart.

475
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:55,860
I mean, they support Python on the damn thing, like it's ready to go almost, it's so close.

476
00:28:55,860 --> 00:29:00,540
And this new website is loaded full of documents that we have a researcher pouring through

477
00:29:00,540 --> 00:29:03,000
right now to try to learn as much as we can.

478
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:07,440
But there is more and more signs that Google is relatively far along with Fuchsia.

479
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:09,920
And we don't have a lot of details yet.

480
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:14,040
But one thing that stands out to me as a clear user interface that would be great on like

481
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:20,280
a mobile device is this thing they call stories, which is a user facing logical container,

482
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:25,640
encapsulating human activity, satisfied by one or more related modules.

483
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:29,800
Stories allow the users to organize activities in ways they find natural.

484
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:32,960
Stories are presented in a visual thing called a story shell.

485
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:35,120
It's Microsoft's timeline feature.

486
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:39,720
But in this whole shell around based around your, your activity in your timeline, and

487
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:41,000
they call it story.

488
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,460
That's not for IoT devices.

489
00:29:42,460 --> 00:29:43,460
Give me a break.

490
00:29:43,460 --> 00:29:47,920
No, that is clearly aimed at mobile and maybe kind of home assistance and stuff, which I

491
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:52,040
suppose technically are IoT, but we're not talking about the low end thermostats and

492
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:54,460
stuff like that.

493
00:29:54,460 --> 00:30:00,240
You said that it's as if they looked at the mistakes they made with Chrome OS and Android,

494
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:04,200
but it's almost like they've taken an even bigger step back and looked at the mistakes

495
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:12,160
of Unix and Linux and everything that we've known really, for the last like 40 odd years.

496
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:18,240
And thinking about how to just reimplement it all completely from scratch with modern

497
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:21,400
technologies and ideas, design ideas.

498
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:27,240
There's also some fundamental differences in design philosophy, which kind of really

499
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:35,080
puts fuchsia opposite to Linux and a is permissively licensed, which is going to make driver manufacturers

500
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:40,000
very happy because they don't have to worry about, quote, GPL contamination, end quote.

501
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,640
But there's the design of the kernel itself.

502
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:46,600
Fuchsia is a microkernel and Linux is a monolithic kernel.

503
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:50,520
And this is an age old debate that goes back like forever in the industry.

504
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:55,600
And we're going to see these two things compete head to head on the world stage.

505
00:30:55,600 --> 00:31:00,760
And then, of course, last but not least, fuchsia will be controlled by Google with an ecosystem

506
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:05,880
around it that it cultivates like Go and Flutter and Kubernetes and all of these things that

507
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:10,820
make it applicable on mobile and server against Linux, which is developed by the entire world

508
00:31:10,820 --> 00:31:14,560
and not owned by a single person or controlled by a single company.

509
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:18,600
And it's going to be on all these different fronts, totally different approaches going

510
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:21,600
head to head, potentially when fuchsia launches.

511
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:26,480
And it really does seem close, like they've been working on this for a long time.

512
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:27,620
They're getting close.

513
00:31:27,620 --> 00:31:30,320
And what they do with it, we have yet to see.

514
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:34,800
They've been downplaying what they would, they just say it's an experimental operating

515
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:35,800
system.

516
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:38,320
But they've invested so much tech into this.

517
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:40,120
It seems it's clearly more than that.

518
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:45,320
Yeah, it's potentially quite worrying, really, that they could use their vast resources,

519
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:50,280
even spending a few hundred million on it wouldn't be that much to them.

520
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:53,760
I mean, it's a bit more than pocket change, but it's still not very much.

521
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:56,720
And what could you accomplish with that?

522
00:31:56,720 --> 00:32:01,800
And maybe they could just take over the world like Linux has.

523
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:06,760
I mean, it might take them a little while, five, 10 plus years, but we could be in a

524
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:12,040
situation in another decade where Linux is sort of playing second fiddle.

525
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:13,760
I mean, look what happened with Firefox.

526
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:18,040
Okay, that's a much smaller bit of software, relatively speaking.

527
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:23,280
But Firefox was going strong and looking like it was going to take over.

528
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:27,400
And then suddenly, Google comes along with the resources that they have to make Chrome

529
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:31,080
and it just basically has wiped out Firefox.

530
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:35,720
And what if that same thing happened with Linux and we ended up having this Android

531
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:40,800
style operating system that's just thrown over the wall and yes, is open source, but

532
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:45,320
fundamentally is just controlled by one giant company?

533
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:47,360
It makes me a bit uncomfortable, really.

534
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:50,240
To truly disrupt Linux, you just have to disrupt it on the server.

535
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:52,400
I mean, I just toss that out there nonchalantly.

536
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:53,960
That's a huge statement.

537
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:57,160
But let's go with where you're taking this for a moment.

538
00:32:57,160 --> 00:33:00,320
There's some things about Fuchsia that I think are super appealing.

539
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:04,440
First of all, Google has a clear demand for an efficient operating system, even if it's

540
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:05,920
just in their data center.

541
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:10,480
It's sort of that same reason I just tossed Kubernetes under the bus a moment ago.

542
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:13,920
The reason that makes Kubernetes kind of appealing to people is Google has every incentive to

543
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:17,520
make it work great for them if only they ever used it internally.

544
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:21,120
And that kind of inherently makes it a great product because they're at such scale that

545
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:23,760
they're solving problems people need solved.

546
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:25,540
Fuchsia would provide them that same sort of utility.

547
00:33:25,540 --> 00:33:30,320
They could take Linux off of their own servers and put Fuchsia on there and they would grok

548
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:36,720
the benefits of reducing the complexity now because you just get rid of things like namespaces

549
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:42,600
and control groups and Docker as a concept goes away because every application is protected

550
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:43,960
and isolated.

551
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:47,280
And even the file systems are protected and isolated.

552
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:52,440
It's really well designed for dense application servers that could run even more applications

553
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:55,440
than we can now because you get rid of all these middle layers that make it possible

554
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:57,500
and make them isolated.

555
00:33:57,500 --> 00:34:03,480
That right there could be enough to drive the market because that gets them more density

556
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:06,240
out of their existing data center footprint.

557
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:09,640
And if the operating system's free, it's pretty hard to turn down.

558
00:34:09,640 --> 00:34:14,440
If they make it easy enough to run Linux applications, it could be a slam dunk.

559
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:18,080
Now that's a far, far, far maybe.

560
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:20,160
I've yet to see anything really take Linux out.

561
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:23,180
And most of the time what ends up happening is Linux adapts, incorporates the best and

562
00:34:23,180 --> 00:34:25,040
continues on.

563
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:30,320
In this one case, because of who Google is, their market position and the way they're

564
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:34,280
building this, yeah, it worries me.

565
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:39,720
Because Fuchsia worries me 10 times more than the Windows subsystem for Linux does on Windows

566
00:34:39,720 --> 00:34:40,720
10.

567
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:41,720
Way, way more.

568
00:34:41,720 --> 00:34:45,600
What this is represents a much bigger threat to me than anything that Microsoft is doing

569
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:46,600
right now.

570
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:50,040
There is another distinct possibility, though, and that is that Google will just do what

571
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:54,280
they always do and spend a load of money developing something for ages and ages and then just

572
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:55,280
drop it.

573
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:56,280
Absolutely.

574
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:57,280
And that's what I'm hoping for.

575
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:58,840
That's what I'm betting on.

576
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:02,720
