00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,960
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, our weekly take on Linux and the open source world.

2
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:20,400
This is episode 21 recorded on October 1st, 2017.

3
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:21,400
I'm Chris.

4
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:22,400
And I'm Joe.

5
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:23,400
Hello, Joe.

6
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:27,960
I'm very happy to say I'm back from New York and we get to start this episode out with

7
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:30,160
a Runs Linux this week.

8
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:33,320
The new Atari console is going to run Linux.

9
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:34,680
This thing actually is kind of nice.

10
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:38,120
It's the Atari box and it's got a wood front, so I'm sold.

11
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:41,000
Yeah, it does look kind of cool and retro.

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,800
It's got Linux on there, of course.

13
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:48,800
Atari says it lets them be more open because they get to use Linux.

14
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:52,360
I guess that's probably true only in the sense that they didn't have to create their own

15
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:53,680
operating system.

16
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:58,600
The box draws heavily from the Atari 2600, which obviously hits that retro soft spot

17
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:03,560
for me, and it comes preloaded with, quote, tons of classic Atari retro games.

18
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:07,960
Yeah, but because it runs Linux, it's going to be able to run loads of modern stuff as

19
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:08,960
well in theory.

20
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:15,320
Yeah, and it's going to have four USB ports, so you could hook up maybe a disk with additional

21
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:19,760
ROMs, a mouse and a keyboard or other USB peripherals to play with that.

22
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:22,900
But it's got this weird launch that they're doing.

23
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:28,840
The Atari box is going to launch first on Indiegogo in the coming weeks with an unspecified

24
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:35,400
goal, and then later on in late spring of 2018, it's going to ship retail for around

25
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:38,600
$250, US greenbacks.

26
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:40,840
So what is it going to launch at Indiegogo at?

27
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:45,720
If it's going to be any less than that, then it can't be very high spec'd, can it?

28
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:49,720
Yeah, and if it's going to be cheaper than Indiegogo, it might be a good time to jump

29
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:50,720
in.

30
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:55,040
But if you're going to have a very powerful box to play these old games, you're not going

31
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:58,640
to be running the most latest Dolphin emulator or something like that.

32
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:03,200
Oh, well, yeah, you can play old Atari games on a Raspberry Pi, so you don't need hardly

33
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:07,040
any power at all, but if you want to play modern games, if you want to get Steam going

34
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:12,440
on there, then you're probably going to need more than $250 worth of hardware.

35
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:14,960
I'm going to be interested to take a look at it.

36
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:18,880
I'd probably more than even playing the games would like to just go under the hood and see

37
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:23,320
what distro did they choose, which kernel is it shipping, how did they implement it?

38
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:25,160
It just feels like this came out of nowhere.

39
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:26,360
See what else it can do.

40
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:27,360
Yeah, yeah.

41
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:31,600
And maybe it'll be running Ubuntu, although probably not Ubuntu 17.10, though we did get

42
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:32,920
the final beta this week.

43
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:38,000
Yeah, I had a quick look at it, and I didn't want to give it too much of a play because

44
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,400
I think we should probably do a review or at least talk about the final release, but

45
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,120
it's looking really good to me.

46
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:50,600
Yeah, and the thing that I'm happy to see got included is kernel 4.13, which is the

47
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:56,840
version of the Linux kernel that has AppArmor baked in, which is a key part of snap confinement,

48
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:58,860
so now that's mainline to the Linux kernel.

49
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:02,040
And just overall, it feels very polished.

50
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:04,680
All the work that they've put into it has paid off.

51
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:08,800
Well, maybe you'll be upset about this, Joe, because they're officially dropping 32-bit

52
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:11,700
desktop ISO images with 17.10.

53
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:15,320
This has been going around quite a lot on Google Plus and everything.

54
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:19,860
People are panicking, but the reality is that it's just the ISO images that they're dropping.

55
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:22,700
They're not dropping the 32-bit archive.

56
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:25,060
The flavors are not dropping 32-bit ISOs.

57
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:32,400
This is only Ubuntu proper, and you can still upgrade to 17.10 because the archive is still

58
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,400
there.

59
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:35,680
It's just literally they're not building the ISO and hosting it.

60
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:39,240
Okay, true enough, but don't you think that also is going to lead to less users testing

61
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:42,760
this stuff and an overall degrading of the 32-bit experience?

62
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:46,680
Well, is anyone really testing it anyway, is the question.

63
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:49,200
Isn't it just a kind of waste of resources at this point?

64
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:55,100
I mean, fair enough, Lubuntu or Zubuntu even, or even Ubuntu Marte would work reasonably

65
00:03:55,100 --> 00:04:01,320
well on an old 32-bit machine, but the server makes sense for 32-bit, especially if it's

66
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:06,280
containerized or whatever because it's smaller, but I just can't see any use case for 32-bit

67
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:11,080
full-blown Ubuntu desktop because the only machine I've got that's 32-bit only, it'd

68
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:16,000
just be dog slow to run gnome on that, so I just don't see the issue.

69
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,160
I think that's a good point, and like you said, there's going to be other ways to get

70
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:26,420
32-bit support, and I would not be surprised if the container use case keeps 32-bit packages

71
00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:30,960
alive for quite a while, and other things like gaming will also require 32-bit libraries,

72
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:34,000
which you'll still be able to install on your 64-bit distribution.

73
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:39,760
Yeah, and also, if you really want to have full-blown Ubuntu, you can just get the minimal

74
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:42,080
or the net install and build it up that way.

75
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:44,440
It just means you won't have a 32-bit live image.

76
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:45,440
Right.

77
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:49,160
Yeah, and let's be honest, that's how real hardcore Ubuntu users do it, right, Joe?

78
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:50,160
Right?

79
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,880
I do occasionally, but not normally.

80
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:56,760
Speaking of hardcore, you know, the Kaywin project is pretty hardcore, and they're looking

81
00:04:56,760 --> 00:05:01,740
at the future and saying, hey, let's see if we can't get Kaywin and Wayland running without

82
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:06,480
any X tentacles, no X Wayland support, no X dependencies.

83
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:11,280
Well, this is surely what they need to do regardless, right, and now they're just finally

84
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:12,560
getting around to doing it.

85
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:16,760
Yeah, it is sort of funny because it's like fixing the barn door before we even have cows

86
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:22,280
in this particular case, but the general idea here is getting Kaywin X11 free, so that way

87
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:27,960
the code that isn't loaded cannot interfere, which is a direct quote from the Kaywin maintainer.

88
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:32,520
The whole idea here obviously is to reduce exposure to attack surfaces, code dependency

89
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:38,000
problems, legacy code, and build towards the future where we're Wayland 100%.

90
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:43,200
Now having just sat in a room full of people that are hacking away on Wayland issues, I

91
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:47,040
feel like that future is further away than most of us think.

92
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:52,160
It's not necessarily going to be in the next year or so, but good on them for working on

93
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:54,040
this problem before it's really even necessary.

94
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:59,720
Yeah, well someone needs to lead the way and it's good to see that it is happening in KDE

95
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:00,720
land.

96
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:06,240
One of the most surprising stories this week was that the LTS kernel is now going to be

97
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:11,160
supported for six years instead of two, which is just a massive difference.

98
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:14,200
Yeah, I'd say this is the story that I was most pleased to see this week too.

99
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:18,400
This is going to have really great benefits and it's going to have a few downsides, I

100
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:19,400
suspect.

101
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:23,080
Traditionally, the long-term support kernel was supported for two years, and now Greg

102
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:25,280
Kh will be maintaining it for six years.

103
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:29,680
Beginning with the current 4.4 LTS cycle, it will be extended for six years.

104
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:33,840
The current 4.4 LTS cycle, underscore that for a moment.

105
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:38,920
Meanwhile, Linux 4.14 is the next LTS that's currently being worked on that would then

106
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:42,600
be supported until 2023.

107
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:43,680
That's a long time.

108
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:48,080
Is the world even going to still be going by that point, but at least our Android phones

109
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:49,920
will benefit from this, eh?

110
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:50,920
Definitely.

111
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:54,600
This is obviously a move that I think was influenced by Google and Google's Project

112
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:57,120
Treble, which we have talked about on this show.

113
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:00,880
When we were talking about Project Treble and doing research, I seem to recall coming

114
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:06,320
across a discussion thread that implied that Google was campaigning upstream to the Linux

115
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:08,280
kernel community for this change.

116
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:12,560
I don't know if this is made solely for Google though, because I could see this having big

117
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:17,900
ramifications for business, especially in the server and in the media production space.

118
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:22,440
That's the positive side, obviously, and the positive ramifications for Project Treble.

119
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:27,500
I am concerned that this will cause some system on a chip manufacturers to essentially sit

120
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:33,680
on their hands and not bother updating patches and kernel drivers for anything other than

121
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:38,300
the LTS releases, which could cause quite a bit of problems with the pace of standard

122
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:41,640
Linux kernel development that most distributions end up shipping.

123
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:46,080
But surely the changes that you're talking about there don't really affect most of the

124
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:52,440
distros that are shipping, for example, x86 versions of Linux, because that's all drivers

125
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:54,640
and stuff that's just not even relevant.

126
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:56,280
You could be right on the x86 side of things.

127
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:58,840
I'm not sure if this will have a huge impact either way.

128
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:03,360
I'm thinking primarily about the ARM side of things, where new devices come out that

129
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:08,400
support some new feature or some new radio, and they require enablement via a newer version

130
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:13,880
of the kernel, but all of the other system chips in that device are dragging their feet

131
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:14,940
with the software.

132
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:19,960
That could cause some sort of weird back porting or forking of the kernel for these devices.

133
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:23,440
I guess that's sort of in a straw man argument, so this is going to be one of those wait and

134
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:24,440
see issues.

135
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:27,080
So it's not really worth getting all that worked up about, but when it comes to these

136
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:31,960
system on a chip vendors, I've learned to expect the least.

137
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:36,360
I suppose, but maybe it will lead to more standardization because if you've got drivers

138
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:42,680
in the kernel and as you say, if you've got one device that needs newer firmware, then

139
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:45,160
maybe they won't ship that newer device.

140
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:50,800
Maybe they'll ship something that's more tried and tested and you'll end up with more standardization

141
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:55,920
and it'll just be cheaper for them to work alongside all the other OEMs to have a kind

142
00:08:55,920 --> 00:09:01,440
of more standard set of components in these devices.

143
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,680
You are a communist, Joe.

144
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:03,680
You are a communist.

145
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:04,680
No, I'm kidding.

146
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:07,760
I think that could very well be true.

147
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:11,380
If only there was some sort of mechanism where the code could be shared and then everybody

148
00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:13,400
could benefit and contribute back to it.

149
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:17,400
That might just make things work out.

150
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:22,280
But back to the x86 side of things, the first thing I thought about was Red Hat and RHEL

151
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:26,700
because at the moment they are supporting the kernel for like 10 years and having to

152
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:28,520
pay people for that.

153
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:30,240
This is going to save them a bunch of money.

154
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:35,160
Not just Red Hat, SUSE, Canonical, any distribution that's maintaining a quote unquote long term

155
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:39,580
supporter enterprise kernel could switch over to this branch now and then just apply their

156
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:41,720
minimal set of patches on top of it.

157
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:42,720
It's going to be great for them.

158
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:46,400
Yeah, I do wonder about hardware enablement and stuff and how that's going to work.

159
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:53,160
But yeah, I think it will be ultimately at least a little bit less work for them.

Linux Academy dot com slash unplugged.

161
00:09:54,940 --> 00:09:58,740
Go there to support the show and sign up for a free seven day trial to a platform that

162
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:04,240
is designed to teach you more about Linux and open source technologies and all of the

163
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:06,740
quote unquote stacks on top of that.

164
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:11,160
And I guess when I say stacks, I mean things like AWS, Azure, OpenStack, and of course

165
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:14,640
all of the individual components of Linux itself.

166
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:18,520
Linux Academy gives you self-paced, in-depth video courses on every Linux cloud and DevOps

167
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:19,520
topic.

168
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:22,060
One of the things that's really valuable is they have hands on scenario based labs that

169
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:27,280
give you experience on real servers and instructors, real human beings that are ready and available

170
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:28,280
to help you when you get stuck.

171
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:31,160
And if you're going for certifications, they have great courseware on that.

172
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:34,540
They have mobile applications so you can learn on the go, comprehensive study guides you

173
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:38,820
can download with you, virtual servers they spin up on demand, and much, much more.

174
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:40,420
It's a platform to learn more about Linux.

175
00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:41,420
You get it.

176
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:43,800
They also have public profiles to demonstrate your achievements.

177
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:47,200
It's a great way to learn more about Linux and advance your career.

178

179
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,600

Support the show and go to Linux Academy dot com slash unplugged.

181
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:01,560
Nextcloud's done a whole bunch of work on integrating end to end encryption.

182
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:05,800
They're working on a new version of the Nextcloud client software.

183
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:07,920
It's in preview right now.

184
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:11,160
And it's going to be a final feature in Nextcloud 13.

185
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:12,960
And it's client side encryption.

186
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:17,160
Yeah, this is potentially massive for them, especially in enterprise where that stuff

187
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:18,640
is really, really important.

188
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:21,660
OK, as a home user, it's nice to have encryption.

189
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:24,040
In the enterprise, it's absolutely essential.

190
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:28,000
And they really go out of their way to say this is end to end encryption done on the

191
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
client side.

192
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:33,080
There's no middleman, no web interfaces that can get compromised, no server side decrypting

193
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:35,520
that's possible without the client keys.

194
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:38,600
And the solution works on a per folder level.

195
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:44,820
They say it does have a server assisted but fully secure key management system with support

196
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:49,640
for creating an offline administrator recovery key, which could be kept in a physically separated

197
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:51,280
location like a safe.

198
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:53,000
And this is neat, Joe.

199
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,800
Users get warned if that recovery key is ever enabled.

200
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:59,340
Yeah, that is very nice.

201
00:11:59,340 --> 00:12:01,520
Obviously this is something that's going to need a lot of testing.

202
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:05,320
And they also make it clear that this is in preview mode right now and they're seeking

203
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:06,320
feedback.

204
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:07,480
I want to try this, though.

205
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:12,120
I really want to give it a go, encrypt a few folders and just try it out for a while, because

206
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:15,280
this is exactly the kind of feature set we want from Nextcloud.

207
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:18,840
And it's something that Dropbox simply can't offer because of their business model.

208
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:19,840
Yeah.

209
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:23,240
And you know, I really like the attitude that they have with this.

210
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:28,120
They say, security being as hard as it is, we expect some harsh criticism, but we look

211
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:32,160
forward to the constructive feedback which will enable us to improve and fine tune our

212
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:33,740
design and implementation.

213
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:38,080
They're basically saying, look, there's people out there who know a lot more about this than

214
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:42,760
us and please try it out, poke holes in it and tell us what we've done wrong, rather

215
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:45,960
than having an arrogant attitude of we've done this great thing.

216
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:48,680
You know, I really like to see that humble attitude.

217
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:49,680
Yeah.

218
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:52,760
They've integrated support for an audit log as well, which is a great feature when you're

219
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:54,940
building a feature set like this.

220
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:59,080
They also have a revoking key system, again, a great feature to have built in from the

221
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:00,540
very beginning.

222
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:02,120
This really looks like it could be a hit.

223
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:06,040
All of the basic stuff you want in your first implementation is there.

224
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:09,600
And now it's just a matter of refining it and making sure it's a solid implementation.

225
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:15,560
I've invited Joss and Frank from Nextcloud to come on next week's, or I guess this week's,

226
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:18,780
Linux Unplugged to tell me about it, because I've got a few more questions specifically

227
00:13:18,780 --> 00:13:21,200
about the administrative side of things.

228
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,880
And then I think I'm going to get my hands on this and I'm going to deploy it myself.

229
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:25,120
I look forward to listening to that.

230
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:27,120
Yeah, that should be good.

231
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:29,600
So let's talk about Microsoft.

232
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:33,320
They've been in the news a lot over the last week or so.

233
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:37,960
Well, in fact, over the last few years, really, they've been creeping more and more into the

234
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:39,640
Linux space.

235
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:44,560
And you've got a few small things like SQL Server is now finally available for Linux.

236
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:46,080
We've talked about that when it was announced.

237
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:48,040
Now it's fully out there.

238
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:51,200
You can deploy it on your Linux server.

239
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:53,600
And also there's a new Skype for Linux preview.

240
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:59,640
But for me, the biggest story is Microsoft becoming a premium sponsor of the OSI, the

241
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:02,460
open source initiative.

242
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:08,960
Microsoft are really embracing, aren't they, the Linux and open source world, or at least

243
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:10,120
seemingly so.

244
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:11,120
Indeed.

245
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:14,380
So first of all, context, the OSI launched in 1998.

246
00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:20,160
It is known for taking a largely pragmatic approach to open source.

247
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:23,140
And it advocates for open source in business and government.

248
00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:28,240
They also review open source licenses, which are often specific to vendors to ensure that

249
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:30,920
they conform to community norms and expectations.

250
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:34,360
So now Microsoft has become a premium sponsor of this organization.

251
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:36,480
They've been working together for a couple of years.

252
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:40,840
When Microsoft announced some recent licenses, they tossed it over to the OSI to make sure

253
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:43,880
that they were legit, like back in like 2005 even.

254
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:48,720
And now as a premium sponsor, Microsoft's joining the likes of Google, HPE, Adblock

255
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:52,960
Plus, GitHub, a bunch of others.

256
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:58,000
They are technically a higher level sponsor to the OSI than Red Hat, the Linux Foundation,

257
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,160
Mozilla, or HP themselves.

258
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:07,400
And that is surprising, isn't it, that the Linux Foundation are not a bigger sponsor.

259
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:11,560
You know, Joe, I've been to quite a few events in the last couple of years.

260
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:15,560
And Microsoft has been at all of them in a major way.

261
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:18,440
And they are either there funding for the community get together, or they're there with

262
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:22,040
a booth, or they have their developers there coordinating with people.

263
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:24,800
Obviously, I just got back from the Ubuntu rally.

264
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:28,540
And there I met one of the Skype for Linux developers.

265
00:15:28,540 --> 00:15:32,720
And we were talking about different packaging solutions and talking about a particular bug

266
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:36,520
that was affecting the current LTS of Ubuntu.

267
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:39,000
And he's a Linux user.

268
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
He's a Linux user.

269
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,240
He's a Microsoft Windows guy that's developing in a Linux VM.

270
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:45,360
I mean, this is just his world.

271
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:48,240
To him, there's no OS war to fight.

272
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:50,520
He's just making a product for Linux users.

273
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:54,840
And I think Microsoft is working at that level in a lot of different areas in the organization

274
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:55,840
now.

275
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:57,840
They've sort of lost the passion for the desktop war.

276
00:15:57,840 --> 00:16:04,200
Yeah, I mean, aren't Microsoft a different company from the company involved with Bomber

277
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:07,800
saying that Linux was cancer and all that kind of stuff?

278
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:14,000
Is it really a totally different outlook from the company, or is there something more sinister

279
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
going on?

280
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:19,200
Because that's what some people seem to think.

281
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:23,400
Whereas looking at it from a pragmatic point of view and a kind of realistic business point

282
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:29,900
of view, the war for the desktop, as you say, they don't really care about that anymore.

283
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:33,840
They care much more about the cloud and stuff.

284
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:40,120
And as long as Azure is doing well, then they're fairly happy.

285
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:46,240
And if that means having to embrace Linux, then they're just going to have to do that.

286
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:51,320
Well, outlets like Tech Republic debate if Microsoft is going to love Linux to death,

287
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:56,200
and they throw headlines around about Shuttleworth and Stallman disagreeing about Microsoft and

288
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:57,400
Linux.

289
00:16:57,400 --> 00:17:01,400
In the background, while that conversation is going on, Microsoft has learned how to

290
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:03,020
make money on Linux.

291
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:06,920
And they're one of the few US companies that genuinely makes a big profit on Linux.

292
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:08,000
I mean, just look at the math.

293
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,200
They've now joined the Linux Foundation.

294
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:12,080
They've now joined the OSI.

295
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:17,280
All major Linux distributions can now run on Azure, including Debian, Red Hat, Ubuntu,

296
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:18,280
et cetera.

297
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:23,160
And Microsoft is sending developers and money to all of these open source events to get

298
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:28,280
their developers sitting next to other developers creating open source code.

299
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:33,160
It's one of these situations where this debate, this discussion we're having, doesn't match

300
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:35,340
the reality of the marketplace.

301
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:39,800
Just like the debate between Unity 7 and Gnome never really matched the fact that in the

302
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:43,840
marketplace, millions and millions and millions of Ubuntu machines are being sold.

303
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:46,440
And they don't care what it ships with, they're just getting their work done.

304
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:50,560
Meanwhile, in the tech sphere, we have these conversations constantly about these aspects

305
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:54,880
that we find interesting, but don't actually impact the marketplace.

306
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:58,800
And you look at this, Microsoft's not doing it out of the goodness of their heart, they're

307
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:02,680
doing it because they figured out how to turn a profit by working like this.

308
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:06,280
And I suppose everyone benefits in a sense.

309
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:12,360
It's just very hard for me to accept that everyone can benefit in the Linux world from

310
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:20,680
Microsoft because just the history, that history is so...

311
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:22,800
They're just the enemy, aren't they, traditionally?

312
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:28,520
And if you look at it from a realistic point of view, you're right, but I think that as

313
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:35,660
a Linux community, it's just so difficult for us to look to Microsoft and see anything

314
00:18:35,660 --> 00:18:39,520
other than the evil company who called us cancer.

315
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:44,940
But I suppose we have to ask ourselves, what did we expect to happen if Linux won?

316
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:46,620
And Linux has won the server space.

317
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:48,400
This is exactly what would happen.

318
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:52,560
And I don't think Microsoft's really competing on the desktop space with Linux anymore because

319
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:55,920
they probably view the Mac as a much bigger threat.

320
00:18:55,920 --> 00:19:00,920
And so their desktop efforts now are focused on their Surface hardware, which is more of

321
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:03,540
a direct competitor with the MacBook line.

322
00:19:03,540 --> 00:19:07,860
And on the server, they're playing ball because that's how you make money in the server space

323
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:09,040
where Linux has won.

324
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:15,520
Well, except how do you explain WSL, the Windows subsystem for Linux, if that is not them being

325
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:17,720
worried about Linux as a competitor on the desktop?

326
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:22,060
Ah, but that's just about creating web apps which run on Linux servers.

327
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:25,000
It's really about the developer's tool chain matching what's on production.

328
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,420
So if they have Ubuntu systems, they want to have Ubuntu in the runtime on Windows.

329
00:19:28,420 --> 00:19:31,640
It's not so much about going after Ubuntu on the desktop.

330
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:32,640
Isn't it though?

331
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:35,380
Isn't it trying to keep people in Windows?

332
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:41,280
If you're, for example, dual booting for your games and maybe for exchange support or whatever

333
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:47,360
in Windows, but then you're doing your development in Ubuntu or some other Linux distro, or you're

334
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:51,320
thinking of getting a new machine and you buy it with Windows.

335
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:56,120
And then you think, well, I've got the subsystem, that's all I really need, why bother setting

336
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:57,120
up that other partition?

337
00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:01,320
I bet you that's a nice benefit to the strategy, but I don't get the sense that that's the

338
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:03,400
core strategy of the Windows subsystem for Linux.

339
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:07,400
If it was, there would probably have been more of an emphasis on running GUI applications

340
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:12,080
or they would have bundled a Wayland or X Wayland server or an X11 server.

341
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:14,580
But is that not coming down the road?

342
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:16,360
It really should if they're not working on that.

343
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:18,280
I mean, it seems like a good strategy to me.

344
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:21,440
If you've got the subsystem, you might as well take a few shots at your competitor if

345
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:22,440
you can.

346
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:23,440
It's already there.

347
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:24,920
If I were Microsoft, I'd be doing it.

348
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:30,440
Yeah, but would that maybe upset the likes of Ubuntu, you know, Canonical, if they've

349
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:37,600
worked hard with them for just this one aspect of it that's kind of, as you say, not a direct

350
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:44,200
competitor on the desktop, for then suddenly to be able to run GUI apps and potentially

351
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:46,320
even a desktop environment.

352
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:51,820
At that point, you've got basically almost like a dual boot system without needing to

353
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:52,820
dual boot.

354
00:20:52,820 --> 00:20:56,760
You know, I had that same thought, and I asked around a little bit.

355
00:20:56,760 --> 00:21:02,320
And the sense I've gotten from people at Canonical, you know, do you consider this a threat?

356
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:04,680
Are you worried about this taking away Ubuntu on the desktop?

357
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:06,940
You're doing all this work now, then Microsoft.

358
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:11,920
The sense I get is, no, no, the reason why people choose to run Ubuntu on their desktop

359
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:16,560
and on their workstations is because they're sick and tired of using Windows.

360
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:19,200
And it's just, they're done with it.

361
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:22,280
And they want something that's just going to let them get their work done, that matches

362
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:24,660
production, and that's why they're choosing Ubuntu.

363
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:28,960
And until Windows is no longer Windows, they're not really concerned about it, doesn't sound

364
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,200
like to me.

365
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:31,200
Maybe they're right, maybe they're wrong.

366
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:35,380
Well, yeah, I would never choose Windows if I could, if I had the choice.

367
00:21:35,380 --> 00:21:38,580
And while Linux continues to exist, I would keep using it.

368
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:39,680
But then I'm not a developer.

369
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:46,040
So I don't know, in my mind, the typical developer plays games as well in their spare time.

370
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:49,400
Maybe that's a stereotype, but yeah, I could see it.

371
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:56,600
And that the fact is that with Steam, okay, you can get a few games running on Linux,

372
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:59,300
but just gaming is better on Windows.

373
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:04,160
And so that's just what I have in my mind of who the subsystem is aimed at.

374
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:10,960
It's aimed at developers who like to play games and have a Windows machine.

375
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:15,100
And it's just trying to pull them into that Windows world full time.

376
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:16,100
I don't think you're wrong.

377
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:17,160
I think it is partially that.

378
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:22,400
But more so, I think it's about freeing developers from being locked inside Linux VMs all day,

379
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:26,400
and getting them back inside their desktop, and reducing the overhead of having a bunch

380
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:27,720
of Linux VMs.

381
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:30,480
And I think that's why they're working on being able to run multiple different Linux

382
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:35,080
distributions in windowed mode, so you have SUSE next to Ubuntu, just like you would if

383
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:36,160
you're doing VMs.

384
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:38,400
That's what they're targeting right now.

385
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:41,080
Could see it going that direction, or I could just see them adding features that makes it

386
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:43,520
more and more competitive to the Linux desktop.

387
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:47,140
But I think it's more so about that developer who's stuck in the VM.

388
00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:48,140
That's my take on it.

389
00:22:48,140 --> 00:22:49,840
Yeah, I think realistically you're right.

390
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:54,800
I think that there are far fewer dual booters than I like to think when if you've got a

391
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:58,800
decent laptop with loads of RAM, you're just going to be running a bunch of VMs.

392
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:02,600
So yeah, I suppose you're right, that takes away those VMs and the overhead, as you say.

393
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:04,840
So maybe I'm just dreaming.

394
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:08,400
And besides, while we're figuring all of this out, Bill Gates is switching to Android, and

395
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:09,400
that's...

396
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:14,560
Yeah, that was quite a big story in some parts this week, wasn't it?

397
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:17,160
For me, I just can't get too excited about that.

398
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:19,720
I mean, he's not going to use an iPhone, is he, at the end of the day?

399
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:20,720
I suppose not.

400
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:22,680
And so he's not going to use...

401
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:23,680
What's the alternative?

402
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:26,240
He's not going to use a Sailfish phone, is he?

403
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:29,680
I was going to say he could switch to Blackberry, but then I realized those run Android too.

404
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:32,000
So you're right, he's pretty much stuck.

405
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,760
Maybe if we wouldn't ask Tim Cook, they'd give him an iPhone X early and then he could

406
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:36,520
at least have a status symbol.

407
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:40,240
If you want a status symbol, you should have a new episode of Linux Action News in your

408
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:42,640
pod feeder every single week.

409
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:47,000
