00:00.000 --> 00:16.440
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, our weekly take on Linux and the open source world.

00:16.440 --> 00:20.540
This is episode 91 recorded on February 3rd, 2019.

00:20.540 --> 00:21.540
I'm Chris.

00:21.540 --> 00:22.540
And I'm Joe.

00:22.540 --> 00:23.540
Hello, Joe.

00:23.540 --> 00:25.040
It's good to be connected with you.

00:25.040 --> 00:28.680
And it is a great week to be a Firefox user.

00:28.680 --> 00:31.400
Yeah, Firefox 65 has come out.

00:31.400 --> 00:33.960
And it is all about privacy.

00:33.960 --> 00:38.720
Privacy really has turned into a bit of a buzzword, hasn't it, especially recently after

00:38.720 --> 00:42.240
the proposed changes by Google and Chromium.

00:42.240 --> 00:47.320
It seems like privacy for the web browser is the battlefield for 2019.

00:47.320 --> 00:50.280
And Firefox isn't going to be left out of that fight, Joe.

00:50.280 --> 00:54.680
Yeah, they've got a new set of redesigned controls to give you real granularity about

00:54.680 --> 00:57.620
how you protect yourself when you're browsing.

00:57.620 --> 00:59.000
This is a really sensible approach.

00:59.000 --> 01:03.800
So the default is standard for anyone who wants to just set it and forget it.

01:03.800 --> 01:06.320
It's the default right now, you're good to go.

01:06.320 --> 01:11.700
And it really is the perfect setting for those of you who expect ultimate privacy when you

01:11.700 --> 01:13.840
open up their private browsing mode.

01:13.840 --> 01:18.360
But for the rest of us that want a little more, quote unquote, strict control.

01:18.360 --> 01:22.800
That's for people who want a bit more protection and don't mind if a couple of sites here and

01:22.800 --> 01:23.880
there break.

01:23.880 --> 01:29.720
This setting blocks all known trackers by Firefox, regardless of the privacy mode or

01:29.720 --> 01:30.720
not.

01:30.720 --> 01:34.840
But then if you like to kind of get down to the weeds, they also have now a custom mode.

01:34.840 --> 01:37.280
That's three different modes, Joe, for privacy.

01:37.280 --> 01:41.440
Well, it's always been the browser for the power user with the about config options and

01:41.440 --> 01:42.480
everything.

01:42.480 --> 01:47.300
And now with the privacy settings, you've got real control as a power user if you want

01:47.300 --> 01:53.200
it or if you want to just go for the defaults, then that's pretty much fine for most people.

01:53.200 --> 01:54.840
So it kind of serves both types of users.

01:54.840 --> 01:56.520
Yeah, it's really not bad, is it?

01:56.520 --> 02:01.440
It's nice to see the three different options and to see them expand out this built in set

02:01.440 --> 02:03.000
of options.

02:03.000 --> 02:08.120
But it's pretty generic and basic and not enough.

02:08.120 --> 02:09.640
It's really one of those feature sets.

02:09.640 --> 02:13.160
It's good to see, but it's not enough to move the needle.

02:13.160 --> 02:18.320
That said, some of the things that they are working on for future versions of Firefox,

02:18.320 --> 02:20.600
I think that kind of stuff could move the needle.

02:20.600 --> 02:24.680
Well, in the next version, 66, it looks like they're going to implement a feature that

02:24.680 --> 02:26.880
warns users about man in the middle attacks.

02:26.880 --> 02:29.920
So again, it's all about privacy and security.

02:29.920 --> 02:30.920
Right.

02:30.920 --> 02:36.320
This is a very, very useful feature, especially for those of you on Windows.

02:36.320 --> 02:43.040
Starting with version 66, Firefox will let you know if, say, a rando antivirus product

02:43.040 --> 02:49.620
or malware or maybe even your ISP is intercepting your HTTP and HTTPS traffic.

02:49.620 --> 02:55.600
They're building in a new style of air page into Firefox when it detects this kind of

02:55.600 --> 02:56.600
shenanigans.

02:56.600 --> 03:01.920
And the way this feature works is to show that visual, hey, you user, your traffic is

03:01.920 --> 03:02.920
being intercepted.

03:02.920 --> 03:07.760
You need to look into the software on your computer or ask questions with your ISP.

03:07.760 --> 03:13.440
That is the kind of feature set that I don't really see Google all that compelled to introduce.

03:13.440 --> 03:18.240
Well, that's hopefully what's going to save Firefox and Mozilla here, because we all know

03:18.240 --> 03:24.200
that Chrome has just been absolutely eating up all the market share and Firefox is way,

03:24.200 --> 03:29.520
way down now, almost insignificant in terms of percentage.

03:29.520 --> 03:33.720
But hopefully with features like this, they might be able to claw some of that market

03:33.720 --> 03:40.020
share back and become more relevant as people wake up to the reality that their data is

03:40.020 --> 03:45.040
actually worth something and they should be a bit more careful about who they give it

03:45.040 --> 03:46.040
to.

03:46.040 --> 03:50.800
With that said, I can't help but take a bit of a downer note on this story, because when

03:50.800 --> 03:55.720
I look at what Firefox is attempting to do, I'll give you an example.

03:55.720 --> 04:00.280
They've limited, the limit is remarkable, it's like four or five extensions.

04:00.280 --> 04:04.160
When you consider all of the extensions available to Firefox, Mozilla has picked four or five

04:04.160 --> 04:08.760
that they are occasionally recommending to a subset of users.

04:08.760 --> 04:12.780
An example would be if you go to Facebook, Mozilla will recommend an extension to you

04:12.780 --> 04:14.540
called the Facebook container.

04:14.540 --> 04:18.600
This is one of the best things that has come out of Mozilla in the last five years.

04:18.600 --> 04:23.600
It completely isolates everything about Facebook to an isolated Firefox container.

04:23.600 --> 04:28.560
It can't track you across websites, it's contained to this specific environment.

04:28.560 --> 04:32.400
And yet, users are reacting very negatively.

04:32.400 --> 04:39.920
In fact, bug 1523701 has been filed in the last three days, essentially saying, you're

04:39.920 --> 04:44.400
advertising to me, you're giving me advertisements and I think at the end of the day, what it

04:44.400 --> 04:48.900
represents is Mozilla has lost the trust of their users.

04:48.900 --> 04:52.600
And if they can't keep their existing user base happy, then how can they possibly hope

04:52.600 --> 04:54.200
to grow?

04:54.200 --> 04:58.720
That's a bit of a negative take on it, but I'm inclined to agree, unfortunately.

04:58.720 --> 05:04.180
But I don't know, maybe people who are the hardcore Firefox users at this point actually

05:04.180 --> 05:07.340
care about open source and software freedom and everything.

05:07.340 --> 05:11.440
And they're the ones who are going to go on Reddit, ironically, and complain about this

05:11.440 --> 05:12.440
stuff.

05:12.440 --> 05:19.240
And maybe the people who read the mainstream headlines about Google doing evil things and

05:19.240 --> 05:24.000
Facebook doing evil things might then do a little bit of digging and discover Firefox

05:24.000 --> 05:27.160
and remember, oh, yeah, I used to use that before I switched to Chrome.

05:27.160 --> 05:29.800
And maybe, oh, right, this recommendation, that looks cool.

05:29.800 --> 05:36.760
So maybe the existing users might be a bit alienated, but the users that they will attract

05:36.760 --> 05:40.080
might find this good, I don't know.

05:40.080 --> 05:42.680
Maybe I'm being naive.

05:42.680 --> 05:47.800
Yeah, that's very optimistic for you, Joe, I got to say.

05:47.800 --> 05:55.120
Well, it's all good in the hood if you are an HP user, because I am extremely thrilled

05:55.120 --> 05:59.360
this week to say that LVFS is welcoming HP to the fold.

05:59.360 --> 06:04.240
Yeah, this is excellent news that I did somewhat see coming, but not this quickly.

06:04.240 --> 06:08.800
Because we're seeing other major OEM sign ups with Linux vendor firmware service.

06:08.800 --> 06:12.120
But now HP is like the other behemoth.

06:12.120 --> 06:18.520
So almost all laptops now, potentially, are going to be updatable via the GUI when it

06:18.520 --> 06:19.520
comes to firmware.

06:19.520 --> 06:20.720
And that's got to be a good thing.

06:20.720 --> 06:22.120
So you did see this coming, huh?

06:22.120 --> 06:24.000
I got to be honest, I didn't.

06:24.000 --> 06:29.320
I mean, after System76 said, nah, no, not for us, I wasn't sure what direction this

06:29.320 --> 06:30.320
would go.

06:30.320 --> 06:32.240
But since then, we saw a doubling down from Dell.

06:32.240 --> 06:34.840
We saw AMI get in the game.

06:34.840 --> 06:40.000
We've seen HP and even Lenovo get in the game.

06:40.000 --> 06:45.040
To me, it's like every time one of these new vendors comes along, it's a total unique delight.

06:45.040 --> 06:49.500
I am so thrilled, because I guess I just don't expect it.

06:49.500 --> 06:53.700
Because when I think of Linux computers, I don't think of HP.

06:53.700 --> 06:59.700
But they're looking at the Z2, Z6, Z8, Z440 line.

06:59.700 --> 07:04.520
That's the kind of rigs they're targeting, maybe even the Z840 and more.

07:04.520 --> 07:05.520
OK.

07:05.520 --> 07:06.520
All right.

07:06.520 --> 07:07.520
It's starting to click with me.

07:07.520 --> 07:09.080
But I guess I just didn't see HP next.

07:09.080 --> 07:12.640
If you were going to ask me to make a prediction, say, at the beginning of the year, I don't

07:12.640 --> 07:14.120
know if HP would have been on that list.

07:14.120 --> 07:18.480
Well, he likes to drop hints, usually, about the various companies that he's in negotiations

07:18.480 --> 07:20.720
with and working with.

07:20.720 --> 07:23.840
And it obviously takes quite a while to make these things happen.

07:23.840 --> 07:26.720
And just the speculation of being that it would be HP.

07:26.720 --> 07:28.720
So I was pleasantly surprised to see it.

07:28.720 --> 07:32.200
It'd be good if they could support more models, but I suppose you have to start somewhere.

07:32.200 --> 07:38.240
Reading his blog, though, for a while now, you get a real sense of pride in his work,

07:38.240 --> 07:40.200
which is completely understandable.

07:40.200 --> 07:44.400
And I hope he does feel a sense of pride because he's doing a huge service for Linux users.

07:44.400 --> 07:50.080
But in that sense of pride, he kind of can't help but give a little indication of what's

07:50.080 --> 07:51.240
coming next.

07:51.240 --> 07:54.680
And in the blog post, it's not even vague.

07:54.680 --> 07:55.920
It's pretty much in your face.

07:55.920 --> 08:02.960
He says, even seemingly unlikely companies like Microsoft are still interested in shipping

08:02.960 --> 08:07.240
firmware on LVFS in the future.

08:07.240 --> 08:12.080
Does that mean we're about to get firmware updates for Surface Books on Linux?

08:12.080 --> 08:13.080
What does that mean, Joe?

08:13.080 --> 08:17.560
Well, surely we'd have to get actual, proper Linux support first before we got any firmware

08:17.560 --> 08:18.560
updates.

08:18.560 --> 08:22.760
When I read that, I'm thinking to myself, are we talking about Azure Sphere OS?

08:22.760 --> 08:24.760
Yeah, you never know.

08:24.760 --> 08:27.560
But something that people have actually been getting their hands on over the weekend at

08:27.560 --> 08:34.240
Fosdom is new hardware from Pine64, including a tablet and an upgraded PineBook Pro.

08:34.240 --> 08:35.240
Right.

08:35.240 --> 08:37.520
But the real story here is the freaking prices.

08:37.520 --> 08:42.440
I mean, if you want all your gadgets running pure Linux, then Pine64 has you covered.

08:42.440 --> 08:47.000
But if you don't have a lot of money to spend, well, then Pine64 has you covered.

08:47.000 --> 08:53.320
And the news coming out of Fosdom this year is really about the Pine Tab, a 10-inch tablet

08:53.320 --> 08:55.920
with either Linux or BSD.

08:55.920 --> 09:01.440
Inside the Pine Tab, you'll find a 64-bit system-on-a-chip ARM processor.

09:01.440 --> 09:09.240
It's a Cortex A53 quad-core processor, a Mali 400 GPU, two gigabytes of DDR3 RAM, 16 gigabytes

09:09.240 --> 09:16.480
of eMMC storage built in, and two megapixel front camera and a five megapixel rear shooter.

09:16.480 --> 09:23.040
All of that is behind a 10-inch LCD touchscreen, which is running about 720p for 80 bucks.

09:23.040 --> 09:27.200
Yeah, but you do have to take that price with a bit of a pinch of salt.

09:27.200 --> 09:32.800
$79 might end up being more like $150 by the time you've paid for shipping and import duty

09:32.800 --> 09:33.800
and stuff.

09:33.800 --> 09:35.200
But it's still fairly cheap.

09:35.200 --> 09:39.480
But then it's a fairly low-res screen and things, so it's probably a fair price for

09:39.480 --> 09:40.480
it.

09:40.480 --> 09:45.100
And it is worth keeping in mind that the demo model that they've got at Fosdom is running

09:45.100 --> 09:46.820
Android at the moment.

09:46.820 --> 09:52.120
But they have said that it is fairly similar specs-wise to the original PineBook.

09:52.120 --> 09:55.400
And there's plenty of distros and ROMs available for that.

09:55.400 --> 09:59.240
So in theory, they should work with minimal tweaking.

09:59.240 --> 10:04.280
So the software support should be there pretty much from day one, and I'm very tempted to

10:04.280 --> 10:05.280
get this.

10:05.280 --> 10:07.080
Yeah, but what do you think about that $20 keyboard?

10:07.080 --> 10:11.780
I think that looks pretty good, and the people I've spoken to at Fosdom say it's pretty

10:11.780 --> 10:12.780
solid as well.

10:12.780 --> 10:13.780
Really?

10:13.780 --> 10:14.780
Oh, okay.

10:14.780 --> 10:18.000
See, I was thinking $20 magnetic keyboard, there's no way they can deliver that.

10:18.000 --> 10:20.800
That out of all of this was the thing I was the most skeptical about.

10:20.800 --> 10:27.000
Well, yeah, I mean, for the price, obviously, it's not going to be the quality of a Surface

10:27.000 --> 10:28.880
or whatever.

10:28.880 --> 10:32.920
This is a budget device, and you have to go into it with that in mind.

10:32.920 --> 10:38.320
But based on my PineBook, that for a budget device feels relatively high-end.

10:38.320 --> 10:42.620
It's plastic and everything, but it's solid plastic and doesn't creak and bend and everything.

10:42.620 --> 10:45.640
So I give them the benefit of the doubt on that.

10:45.640 --> 10:50.200
But this PineBook Pro, now they're making some pretty hefty claims about that.

10:50.200 --> 10:54.840
Yeah, the PineBook Pro is what I am actually excited about.

10:54.840 --> 10:59.440
And it's just anecdotally what I've heard the most from the audience from this week.

10:59.440 --> 11:09.840
I mean, the idea is a 14-inch 1080p IPS display with about 128GB of eMMC storage, 4GB of system

11:09.840 --> 11:15.800
RAM, and maybe the option of adding your own MV&E SSD drive.

11:15.800 --> 11:22.440
Plus, you get all the usual ports like USB-A, USB-C, and inside that sucker, a dual-core

11:22.440 --> 11:26.720
ARM processor, maybe a quad-core, depending on the way the specs work out, and the whole

11:26.720 --> 11:32.080
thing comes together for $200, that puts it below a Chromebook, Joe.

11:32.080 --> 11:35.400
Yeah, and it is the same processor that's used in a fair few Chromebooks as well.

11:35.400 --> 11:38.880
So in theory, you should get decent performance from it.

11:38.880 --> 11:42.760
Now, what piqued my interest towards the end of this part of their announcement was where

11:42.760 --> 11:48.760
they said that the PineBooks that people already have might well be upgradable to this.

11:48.760 --> 11:51.380
Because it's very hackable, the PineBook that I've got.

11:51.380 --> 11:56.040
You can open it up with like 10 screws or whatever, and they're just standard screws.

11:56.040 --> 11:59.760
And you can see all the boards right there, and it wouldn't be difficult to change the

11:59.760 --> 12:01.280
insides of this thing.

12:01.280 --> 12:05.660
And you've got the screen, the keyboard, touchpad, battery, and all the ports.

12:05.660 --> 12:09.400
And so in theory, you could put in the more powerful hardware and have an actual usable

12:09.400 --> 12:14.200
laptop, because at the moment, it's not a daily driver, and they make no bones about

12:14.200 --> 12:15.200
that.

12:15.200 --> 12:19.120
But they're saying that this PineBook Pro would be daily driver-worthy.

12:19.120 --> 12:25.440
In the Chromebook category, you're not going to be compiling kernels on it in 10 minutes.

12:25.440 --> 12:30.400
It's a fairly lightweight browsing machine, but the claim is that it would be good enough

12:30.400 --> 12:31.660
to do that.

12:31.660 --> 12:38.260
And so I had been tempted to sell my PineBook and maybe get the tablet, but now I'm thinking

12:38.260 --> 12:43.080
maybe hang on, and hopefully it'll be not that expensive to buy just the board to put

12:43.080 --> 12:47.880
inside my PineBook, and I could be off to the races.

12:47.880 --> 12:48.880
No kidding, right?

12:48.880 --> 12:53.520
Like how cool would it be if the part of the Pine brand was upgradability?

12:53.520 --> 12:59.320
I mean, it seems like such an obvious thing, but you can't name a single brand that's well

12:59.320 --> 13:03.800
recognized that is known for the upgradability of its components and its laptops.

13:03.800 --> 13:04.800
That just doesn't exist.

13:04.800 --> 13:08.880
Yeah, well, these days you're lucky to get RAM slots rather than soldered RAM.

13:08.880 --> 13:10.960
Or disk, yeah.

13:10.960 --> 13:15.840
And so if you could change the entire system on a chip and the whole basically motherboard

13:15.840 --> 13:18.800
of it very easily and relatively cheaply...

13:18.800 --> 13:20.560
Swap it out, just the whole board.

13:20.560 --> 13:22.960
I think that'd be pretty great.

13:22.960 --> 13:27.880
And to say nothing about the other rumors coming out of FOSDEM, the one that I'm probably

13:27.880 --> 13:32.600
the most looking forward to is a $20 open source IP camera.

13:32.600 --> 13:34.960
I would be all about that.

13:34.960 --> 13:39.980
And then there's the one that I'm the most skeptical about, which is the $150 Linux smartphone

13:39.980 --> 13:42.000
with an unspecified screen size.

13:42.000 --> 13:45.400
Well, they do actually have working dev kits of that phone, which is more than you can

13:45.400 --> 13:47.120
say of Purism at this stage.

13:47.120 --> 13:48.240
Oh, shots fired.

13:48.240 --> 13:49.240
Shots fired indeed.

13:49.240 --> 13:52.080
But, you know, and they're being very modest about it.

13:52.080 --> 13:54.480
They're not making this big song and dance about the phone.

13:54.480 --> 13:59.560
They're kind of saying that we're working on it and, you know, here's a prototype and,

13:59.560 --> 14:02.580
you know, it's not this big grand product.

14:02.580 --> 14:06.160
And that's kind of never been their style as it's always been.

14:06.160 --> 14:08.320
We're aimed at hackers and tinkerers.

14:08.320 --> 14:13.200
And you know, this is the phone that we're working on and it's going to be ready when

14:13.200 --> 14:17.240
it's ready rather than making firm promises and then not keeping them.

14:17.240 --> 14:22.680
It seems like a genuine, clear understanding of the actual marketplace.

14:22.680 --> 14:27.440
And then you combine that with the same thing that I feel like other projects we've talked

14:27.440 --> 14:31.880
about in the same space, sort of primarily Plasma Mobile, where they come at it with

14:31.880 --> 14:33.440
a humbleness.

14:33.440 --> 14:35.080
This is where we're at today.

14:35.080 --> 14:38.400
You know, this is what we can offer today and we think it's something that is unique

14:38.400 --> 14:42.280
to hackers and we're trying to offer it at a competitive price point.

14:42.280 --> 14:46.040
We're not saying it's going to replace the iPhone or compete with the Pixel.

14:46.040 --> 14:51.080
But if you are in this particular market and you even know what these things mean, we have

14:51.080 --> 14:52.600
a product for you.

14:52.600 --> 14:53.600
And God bless them, Joe.

14:53.600 --> 14:55.560
Yeah, and they have the attitude of come and help us.

14:55.560 --> 14:57.880
This is an open source project, come and help us hack on it.

14:57.880 --> 14:58.880
Yeah.

14:58.880 --> 15:02.600
And that is the right approach, because then it's not, oh, we're going to take over the

15:02.600 --> 15:03.600
world.

15:03.600 --> 15:07.520
We're going to fundamentally change the consumer landscape and alter cloud computing all in

15:07.520 --> 15:08.520
one swoop.

15:08.520 --> 15:12.800
It's, hey, we have something we think is appealing and we're going to iterate on it for years.

15:12.800 --> 15:15.640
And eventually we're going to get to something that we think is super competitive.

15:15.640 --> 15:17.400
In the meantime, help us make it better.

15:17.400 --> 15:18.400
Yeah.

15:18.400 --> 15:21.480
In the meantime, hackers are going to use it and have fun doing so.

15:21.480 --> 15:25.320
But I suppose the elephant in the room whenever we're talking about any of these arm based

15:25.320 --> 15:29.200
systems is the Raspberry Pi Foundation.

15:29.200 --> 15:33.820
And you and I have some predictions in the works, in play, as you might say, that could

15:33.820 --> 15:35.800
be affected by this next news story.

15:35.800 --> 15:38.520
But we're here to report the news as it is.

15:38.520 --> 15:44.360
It appears we will not see a Raspberry Pi 4 at least in 2019.

15:44.360 --> 15:48.720
Yeah, this is very disappointing to me because I predicted this with great confidence that

15:48.720 --> 15:52.080
we'd see it this year, but apparently not.

15:52.080 --> 15:56.920
In an interview with Tom's Hardware, Evan Upton has said that, no, it's not happening

15:56.920 --> 15:57.960
this year.

15:57.960 --> 16:00.280
It will be called the Raspberry Pi 4.

16:00.280 --> 16:05.460
It will be $35 and it will be more powerful and have more RAM.

16:05.460 --> 16:09.960
So it's most of what we thought, but it's just not going to be this year, which is going

16:09.960 --> 16:11.680
to disappoint quite a lot of people, I think.

16:11.680 --> 16:12.680
Well, not just other people.

16:12.680 --> 16:13.680
I mean, just you and me.

16:13.680 --> 16:20.040
Like I was hoping that we would have a super cheap Raspberry Pi, a $35 Raspberry Pi, and

16:20.040 --> 16:28.080
then like a $55 Raspberry Pi or so, because the reality is, Joe, is $35 today isn't necessarily

16:28.080 --> 16:31.840
buying you what $35 bought you when the Raspberry Pi launched.

16:31.840 --> 16:36.600
And I think there's room in there for a more feature, maybe more memory, more processor,

16:36.600 --> 16:38.880
but more feature rich Raspberry Pi.

16:38.880 --> 16:43.360
I've made this argument before and reading this over at Tom's Hardware, I can see that

16:43.360 --> 16:45.880
Evan is totally in disagreement with me.

16:45.880 --> 16:49.760
Well, he does seem to be very much sticking to that $35 price and has done from the very

16:49.760 --> 16:50.760
beginning.

16:50.760 --> 16:57.040
But if you consider with inflation, that $35 doesn't actually go as far as it once did.

16:57.040 --> 17:00.600
It's roughly equivalent to about $38 in today's money.

17:00.600 --> 17:06.520
So if they're only selling it for $35 now, then it makes it very tricky for them to squeeze

17:06.520 --> 17:08.560
more and more performance out of a new model.

17:08.560 --> 17:12.000
I really recommend that people read this article because it made something really click for

17:12.000 --> 17:13.000
me.

17:13.000 --> 17:15.440
And you just touched on it, Joe.

17:15.440 --> 17:17.480
They're really sticking to this $35 price.

17:17.480 --> 17:22.560
Now, who knows, maybe they'll have future products that are outside the core Raspberry

17:22.560 --> 17:27.920
Pi product line that are of a completely different price like they did with the Xero.

17:27.920 --> 17:31.920
But reading this article, it seems like he's pretty committed to that $35 price point.

17:31.920 --> 17:38.320
And I think that's important for the market because at their scale, they are actually

17:38.320 --> 17:44.000
applying downward pressure on the prices for the overall component ecosystem.

17:44.000 --> 17:48.740
But it also, to me, resonates with something that the audience has been giving us as solid

17:48.740 --> 17:51.720
feedback anytime we talk about the Raspberry Pi.

17:51.720 --> 17:56.420
And that is simply summed up as there are really good competitive alternatives.

17:56.420 --> 18:00.880
And it seems to me that those competitive alternatives just got even more competitive

18:00.880 --> 18:01.880
with this.

18:01.880 --> 18:03.160
So both the audience is right.

18:03.160 --> 18:07.920
But at the same time, the Raspberry Pi is doing us an overall good by putting downward

18:07.920 --> 18:10.320
pressure on the prices of the entire market.

18:10.320 --> 18:16.000
Well, that's true, but we talked about Pine64 and it feels like if the Raspberry Pi Foundation

18:16.000 --> 18:21.680
don't put out a new board this year, then Pine64 might well start eating their lunch.

18:21.680 --> 18:25.160
I mean, there's a lot of other boards out there.

18:25.160 --> 18:28.040
Most of them are like orange pie, banana pie, that sort of thing.

18:28.040 --> 18:32.540
For my money, anything that has Pi in the name is a cheap rip off and is just to be

18:32.540 --> 18:33.540
avoided.

18:33.540 --> 18:39.640
Now, that's maybe the wrong attitude to have, but it just feels like just cheap and nasty

18:39.640 --> 18:41.400
to me to put a pie in the name.

18:41.400 --> 18:47.120
Whereas Pine64, what makes them sort of sets them apart is that they don't need to try

18:47.120 --> 18:48.120
and cash in.

18:48.120 --> 18:50.100
They just do what they're doing.

18:50.100 --> 18:52.200
And that makes me take them more seriously.

18:52.200 --> 18:53.560
I totally agree.

18:53.560 --> 18:58.600
And on top of that, you also have to figure RISC-V is now a real player in the marketplace

18:58.600 --> 19:00.900
and there are RISC-V boards being built.

19:00.900 --> 19:03.960
And that is also competition for the Raspberry Pi.

19:03.960 --> 19:04.960
That is true.

19:04.960 --> 19:05.960
Yeah.

19:05.960 --> 19:10.560
I mean, the photo of a RISC-V board running plasma mobile at FOSDEM, I mean, it's nowhere

19:10.560 --> 19:15.200
near the size of a Raspberry Pi and it's going to be significantly more expensive at this

19:15.200 --> 19:16.200
stage.

19:16.200 --> 19:21.360
But that is coming and we saw Raspberry Pi join the RISC-V foundation.

19:21.360 --> 19:25.840
So maybe we'll see a RISC-V Pi at some stage.

19:25.840 --> 19:28.960
It seems very unlikely anytime soon.

19:28.960 --> 19:32.720
But maybe in this hacker board space, the tide is turning and that crown is starting

19:32.720 --> 19:35.440
to slip slightly from Raspberry Pi.

19:35.440 --> 19:41.120
Raspberry Pi is a brand that is a that's a known quantity and it works in like the education

19:41.120 --> 19:48.200
space and business and there is just it's so well recognized that they have carved out

19:48.200 --> 19:52.320
a market for themselves now and it is really their game to lose.

19:52.320 --> 19:53.320
But that's just an aside.

19:53.320 --> 20:00.280
I want to take a moment and talk about some throwaway comments that Eben makes about USB-C

20:00.280 --> 20:04.000
and maybe seeing future Raspberry Pi devices with USB-C.

20:04.000 --> 20:05.240
And this is a quote.

20:05.240 --> 20:11.720
He says, there's some awkward decisions in the pin choices on the USB-C connector in

20:11.720 --> 20:15.160
a kind of fairly rugged environment that people use the Pi in.

20:15.160 --> 20:21.520
If the connector gets twisted or if dust gets in it, you can end up exposing the high speed

20:21.520 --> 20:25.960
differential pairs on that connector to rather high voltages.

20:25.960 --> 20:31.560
Overall, it sounded like he wasn't very happy with USB-C and was fairly happy with the ports

20:31.560 --> 20:33.920
they have on the Raspberry Pi devices right now.

20:33.920 --> 20:38.240
Yeah, it seems like he's voting for micro USB still.

20:38.240 --> 20:43.140
And he is an engineer with a lot of experience in this area, so you kind of have to trust

20:43.140 --> 20:44.140
him on that.

20:44.140 --> 20:49.200
He's obviously looked at it and we all have hailed USB-C as the next big thing and the

20:49.200 --> 20:54.320
standard, but he's made me question that now he's doubted my faith in it.

20:54.320 --> 20:55.320
Same with me.

20:55.320 --> 20:58.920
I have been having doubts about USB-C for months now.

20:58.920 --> 21:04.160
Behind the scenes, we've had just issues amongst the staff with different laptops that have

21:04.160 --> 21:07.740
come in the house that have different features on the USB-C ports, and you really have no

21:07.740 --> 21:12.620
idea of knowing what those ports can do unless you are intimately familiar with the entire

21:12.620 --> 21:14.320
spec of the laptop.

21:14.320 --> 21:18.720
And we've just been talking as a group, like, how is this going to work for average consumers?

21:18.720 --> 21:24.280
Well, average consumers are going to buy that Meizu Zero phone that's got no ports at all.

21:24.280 --> 21:26.200
So I don't think they'll be worried.

21:26.200 --> 21:27.200
There you go.

21:27.200 --> 21:28.200
Problem solved.

21:28.200 --> 21:33.240
Meanwhile, back here on Earth, those of us who love a great media center fully under

21:33.240 --> 21:38.600
our control and of course is open source are celebrating the release of Kodi 18.

21:38.600 --> 21:42.200
I tried this out and it doesn't look much different from 17.

21:42.200 --> 21:47.800
It's nowhere near the huge leap in skin that we had from 16 to 17, but there's quite a

21:47.800 --> 21:49.700
lot under the hood that's changed.

21:49.700 --> 21:53.680
You could probably easily be forgiven for missing the changes, to be honest, especially

21:53.680 --> 21:58.100
if you're like me, you're on the Nvidia Shield, which I think is one of the best TV devices

21:58.100 --> 21:59.240
ever.

21:59.240 --> 22:02.800
And you have Kodi installed on it, which is one of the best media centers ever.

22:02.800 --> 22:06.800
This update kind of came along and it was just more good stuff where the last one, like

22:06.800 --> 22:11.080
you said, was like this huge change in the way it looked and everything.

22:11.080 --> 22:13.200
But what you get under the hood is pretty noteworthy.

22:13.200 --> 22:16.480
In fact, what they took out is kind of noteworthy.

22:16.480 --> 22:22.520
Nearly half a million lines of code were removed and nearly half a million new lines of code

22:22.520 --> 22:24.240
were added.

22:24.240 --> 22:25.240
That's arbitrary to us.

22:25.240 --> 22:29.960
Half of that stuff could be Hello World for all we know, but it's just kind of a big number.

22:29.960 --> 22:39.040
And it represents 10,000 commits to the project, which is 36 different individual open source

22:39.040 --> 22:44.600
contributors that are writing code to the main upstream Kodi project now.

22:44.600 --> 22:51.080
And it also represents just a ton of beer and wine and retro gaming for us Kodi users.

22:51.080 --> 22:55.160
This is something that I tried to try out, if that makes any sense, and didn't get very

22:55.160 --> 22:56.160
far.

22:56.160 --> 22:58.200
I didn't spend a huge amount of time on it.

22:58.200 --> 22:59.440
I didn't do much reading.

22:59.440 --> 23:02.680
I just tried to go in as the kind of new user.

23:02.680 --> 23:08.460
And it wasn't immediately obvious to me how to get the emulators working and get my ROMs

23:08.460 --> 23:11.080
loaded up and start playing Sonic.

23:11.080 --> 23:15.840
So I think this is more aimed at people who get down and dirty with hacking it with extensions

23:15.840 --> 23:16.840
and everything.

23:16.840 --> 23:18.240
No, actually all that checks out, Joe.

23:18.240 --> 23:24.000
I got to say what's great about Kodi and also kind of not great about Kodi is all add ons

23:24.000 --> 23:25.640
are essentially created equal.

23:25.640 --> 23:30.320
The Jupiter broadcasting add on that Rob Loach wrote for us like four or five years ago is

23:30.320 --> 23:33.940
like on par with some of this new stuff that is headline features.

23:33.940 --> 23:39.920
And that's cool and feels great from an independent content creator standpoint, but isn't really

23:39.920 --> 23:42.640
serving the project the best it could.

23:42.640 --> 23:45.540
That would be one criticism I might have.

23:45.540 --> 23:51.400
But once you kind of live and learn Kodi, you kind of can figure things out.

23:51.400 --> 23:57.440
But even that said, it took the audience writing into me personally saying, hey, Chris, by

23:57.440 --> 24:01.760
the way, you can use Plex inside of Kodi, do XYZ and it all works.

24:01.760 --> 24:06.400
It took like it took about 20 of them writing me before it clicked how to actually set all

24:06.400 --> 24:07.400
of that up.

24:07.400 --> 24:13.980
Well, also, they've added DRM to this release, and it's a similar situation is not straightforward

24:13.980 --> 24:16.640
to get Netflix and Amazon working in it.

24:16.640 --> 24:18.360
It's not out of the box support.

24:18.360 --> 24:22.740
It requires you to install add ons and do a bit of hacking.

24:22.740 --> 24:24.400
But that's kind of the beauty of it.

24:24.400 --> 24:29.920
It can either be this fairly simple interface that, to be fair, actually adding media to

24:29.920 --> 24:35.400
it can be a little bit confusing for new users I've found that I've set up for.

24:35.400 --> 24:38.720
But once you've got all that set up, it's really straightforward.

24:38.720 --> 24:43.360
Or if you want to get really hacky with it, you can.

24:43.360 --> 24:47.720
And you can do all sorts of stuff, including getting Netflix and Amazon working and your

24:47.720 --> 24:49.540
ROMs on emulators and everything.

24:49.540 --> 24:54.440
And first and foremost, Kodi is the player that gives me the least screen tearing of

24:54.440 --> 24:56.040
any video player on Linux.

24:56.040 --> 24:58.080
So that's why I use it.

24:58.080 --> 24:59.560
Everybody's got their Kodi reason, Joe.

24:59.560 --> 25:01.480
Yeah, I say the least screen tearing.

25:01.480 --> 25:02.480
It's not perfect.

25:02.480 --> 25:03.480
It's Linux.

25:03.480 --> 25:07.600
You know, got to get that X jab in there whenever you can.

25:07.600 --> 25:11.380
Before we go all down the Linux hate hole here for a second, can I just say that Kodi

25:11.380 --> 25:18.680
is a standout Android TV application and version 18 adds a couple of nice features that make

25:18.680 --> 25:21.680
it feel like a full fledged Android TV application.

25:21.680 --> 25:26.400
I don't actually use this, but if you are a fan of Google Assistant on say like the

25:26.400 --> 25:33.960
Nvidia Shield TV, Kodi now has full feature support for voice search and voice typing

25:33.960 --> 25:35.560
using the remote and all of that.

25:35.560 --> 25:39.400
It's I mean, that's like a first class app kind of thing on that ecosystem.

25:39.400 --> 25:41.600
It's it's a big deal for a lot of people.

25:41.600 --> 25:46.160
It doesn't resonate with me, but it checks a box with the quote unquote market.

25:46.160 --> 25:50.660
Well, hopefully they can ride this tide of positive publicity and get to a point where

25:50.660 --> 25:56.000
they're releasing early and often with new features and kind of put the negative publicity

25:56.000 --> 25:57.000
behind them.

25:57.000 --> 25:58.000
I agree.

25:58.000 --> 26:01.640
I hope I really hope so, because Kodi is one of these open source projects that makes a

26:01.640 --> 26:04.180
daily positive impact on my life.

26:04.180 --> 26:09.120
As we record this episode right now, I am in route from Texas to Washington and many,

26:09.120 --> 26:13.640
many times in route, I don't have Internet connectivity and I use Kodi to stream media

26:13.640 --> 26:15.000
around my local land.

26:15.000 --> 26:20.200
And it is after everything I have tried over the years, the absolute best application for

26:20.200 --> 26:21.200
the job.

26:21.200 --> 26:25.840
It would negatively impact my life if it went away and it positively impacts my life when

26:25.840 --> 26:29.480
they have a new release, just like so many other great open source projects.

26:29.480 --> 26:33.800
So much free software now positively impacts my life because I use it on a daily basis

26:33.800 --> 26:38.880
and it probably impacts you out there to go to Linux action news dot com slash subscribe
