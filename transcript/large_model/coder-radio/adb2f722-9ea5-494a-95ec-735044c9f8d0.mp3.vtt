00:00.000 --> 00:15.720
This is KOTORadio, episode 397 for January 18th, 2021.

00:15.720 --> 00:19.840
Hi everyone and welcome into Jupiter Broadcasting's weekly talk show, taking a pragmatic look

00:19.840 --> 00:24.320
at the art and business of software development and the world of technology.

00:24.320 --> 00:28.480
This episode is brought to you by Cloud Guru, Cloud Guru now includes Cloud Playground,

00:28.480 --> 00:33.360
Azure AWS or Google Sandboxes on ACG's credit card, not yours.

00:33.360 --> 00:35.800
Get certified, get hired, get learning to cloudguru.com.

00:35.800 --> 00:36.800
Who me?

00:36.800 --> 00:37.800
Yeah.

00:37.800 --> 00:38.800
Thanks for asking.

00:38.800 --> 00:39.800
Yeah.

00:39.800 --> 00:40.800
I'm Chris.

00:40.800 --> 00:41.800
Thanks.

00:41.800 --> 00:42.800
But what really matters is our host, Mr. Dominic.

00:42.800 --> 00:43.800
Hello, Mike.

00:43.800 --> 00:44.800
Hello, Mr. Fisher.

00:44.800 --> 00:45.800
How are you?

00:45.800 --> 00:46.800
Oh, I'm pretty good.

00:46.800 --> 00:51.200
Sitting here in my minimum viable robe, enjoying a nice comfortable, you know, because I keep

00:51.200 --> 00:52.720
it a little cool in the studio in the winter.

00:52.720 --> 00:54.920
I like to keep the window cracked during the day.

00:54.920 --> 00:55.920
That's okay.

00:55.920 --> 00:56.920
Ask me what I'm wearing.

00:56.920 --> 00:57.920
What are you wearing?

00:57.920 --> 00:58.920
My ACP shirt.

00:58.920 --> 01:05.560
I'm not sure if that's supposed to cut or I don't know.

01:05.560 --> 01:07.520
It's supposed to get feedback on YouTube.

01:07.520 --> 01:09.480
That's what it's supposed to do.

01:09.480 --> 01:10.480
There is that.

01:10.480 --> 01:11.480
Yeah.

01:11.480 --> 01:12.480
I got stories for you today.

01:12.480 --> 01:13.480
Oh, go.

01:13.480 --> 01:14.480
Let's do it.

01:14.480 --> 01:15.480
Let's just get right in.

01:15.480 --> 01:16.680
Well, first I wanted to, you know, you remember a Veed?

01:16.680 --> 01:18.480
He's written in before to the show.

01:18.480 --> 01:19.480
Remember him?

01:19.480 --> 01:20.480
Remember him?

01:20.480 --> 01:21.480
It's been a while.

01:21.480 --> 01:22.480
Spend some time.

01:22.480 --> 01:23.480
My old friend.

01:23.480 --> 01:24.480
Stay a while and listen.

01:24.480 --> 01:25.480
That's right.

01:25.480 --> 01:28.760
That is exactly what I was in the reference I was invoking.

01:28.760 --> 01:29.760
Well done, sir.

01:29.760 --> 01:30.760
Well done.

01:30.760 --> 01:31.760
Yeah.

01:31.760 --> 01:32.760
Stay a while and listen.

01:32.760 --> 01:33.760
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

01:33.760 --> 01:35.880
We have Deckard Cain on the soundboard and I didn't know this.

01:35.880 --> 01:36.880
Yeah.

01:36.880 --> 01:37.880
Well, yeah.

01:37.880 --> 01:38.880
Yeah.

01:38.880 --> 01:40.160
It's cause it's usually on the Linux unplugged, but every now and then I let it bleed in.

01:40.160 --> 01:41.760
Cause I mean, it's, it's Deckard Cain.

01:41.760 --> 01:43.520
Stay a while and listen.

01:43.520 --> 01:44.520
I love it.

01:44.520 --> 01:46.240
I don't remember what we're talking about.

01:46.240 --> 01:47.240
Go ahead.

01:47.240 --> 01:52.560
He's been a listener since 2009 and he says, I just wanted to show or throw a shameless

01:52.560 --> 01:53.560
plug towards you guys.

01:53.560 --> 01:57.760
In the last episode, you mentioned iTerm and you mentioned AWS.

01:57.760 --> 02:00.200
It does sound like us, Mike.

02:00.200 --> 02:01.200
Those are things we would mention.

02:01.200 --> 02:03.120
It does sound about right, doesn't it?

02:03.120 --> 02:04.120
Yeah.

02:04.120 --> 02:05.720
He said, I just wanted to throw you this.

02:05.720 --> 02:13.520
It's a GPL project that scrapes AWS and digital ocean to create dynamic profiles for iTerm

02:13.520 --> 02:15.360
for easy SSHing.

02:15.360 --> 02:20.360
It also creates an SSH config entry with the same information if that's the way you prefer.

02:20.360 --> 02:25.520
He says he'd love to get some information from people on like our, our, our patches

02:25.520 --> 02:28.840
to support Linode or Azure or other cloud providers.

02:28.840 --> 02:32.320
And there's also a windows support for MOBA Xterm.

02:32.320 --> 02:33.320
How about that?

02:33.320 --> 02:38.320
So he, he essentially, I guess, uses the API to figure out what your sit, what your like

02:38.320 --> 02:41.800
digital ocean droplets are or what your AWS instances are.

02:41.800 --> 02:44.760
And then auto builds out iTerm connections for you.

02:44.760 --> 02:46.680
So you should be trying iTerm.

02:46.680 --> 02:48.080
That's what this, that's what this is about.

02:48.080 --> 02:51.080
You realize this is because you besmirched iTerm.

02:51.080 --> 02:53.360
I have some thoughts on iTerm, but let's just keep moving.

02:53.360 --> 02:55.000
I was going to give it another week.

02:55.000 --> 02:56.000
Oh wow.

02:56.000 --> 02:57.000
Okay.

02:57.000 --> 03:01.400
I mean, cause I mean again, you besmirch, you besmirch a great terminal.

03:01.400 --> 03:02.400
You're besmirching.

03:02.400 --> 03:03.400
I didn't say I besmirch.

03:03.400 --> 03:04.680
I just said I had thoughts.

03:04.680 --> 03:07.400
I know, but they're probably besmirchy thoughts.

03:07.400 --> 03:10.680
I would say they're besmirch adjacent.

03:10.680 --> 03:11.680
Yeah.

03:11.680 --> 03:13.800
Besmirchish you might say.

03:13.800 --> 03:17.280
I would say they're like the, you know what?

03:17.280 --> 03:18.280
Let's just keep moving.

03:18.280 --> 03:19.280
Okay.

03:19.280 --> 03:20.280
All right.

03:20.280 --> 03:21.280
I mean, I just think it's a nice little terminal.

03:21.280 --> 03:23.880
I got to configure the way I like, but I understand.

03:23.880 --> 03:27.160
I think you and I wouldn't configure our terminal the same way.

03:27.160 --> 03:28.160
Just saying.

03:28.160 --> 03:29.160
All right.

03:29.160 --> 03:30.160
You know what?

03:30.160 --> 03:32.440
Next week we can have the terminal off.

03:32.440 --> 03:37.680
Then Mike writes in Mike K, listener Mike, big fan of the show he says, and by the way,

03:37.680 --> 03:39.520
can't wait for the ropes to drop.

03:39.520 --> 03:40.520
Absolutely.

03:40.520 --> 03:41.520
God dammit.

03:41.520 --> 03:46.040
He says, I have this question haunting me for a while and I had to ask it here.

03:46.040 --> 03:49.360
What is so terrible about an electron app?

03:49.360 --> 03:50.360
I agree.

03:50.360 --> 03:53.760
It sounds like a hot mess of an idea and yet it works.

03:53.760 --> 03:55.520
It works really well.

03:55.520 --> 03:59.600
VS code is the most popular code editor in the world and I build on it.

03:59.600 --> 04:01.360
In fact, I built on top of it.

04:01.360 --> 04:04.100
So Slack also use that all the time.

04:04.100 --> 04:06.920
Turns out my favorite get client also electron.

04:06.920 --> 04:10.920
I have plenty of issues with flat packs and the like over the years, but never really

04:10.920 --> 04:11.920
an electron app.

04:11.920 --> 04:14.080
They don't seem to be much heavier than the alternatives.

04:14.080 --> 04:18.680
Meanwhile, you basically get web, Linux, windows, Mac builds right out of the box.

04:18.680 --> 04:21.560
It might even work on Mike's M1 without crashing.

04:21.560 --> 04:22.560
Seems like a huge upside.

04:22.560 --> 04:27.520
And yet electron apps seem to be slandered in the Linux world.

04:27.520 --> 04:31.160
I'm a web developer and I want to start writing Linux apps and contributing.

04:31.160 --> 04:36.060
So I naturally want to reach for electron, but I hesitate because all of the hate speech

04:36.060 --> 04:38.680
around it, despite its popularity.

04:38.680 --> 04:40.780
So what am I missing?

04:40.780 --> 04:42.480
Why doesn't this add up?

04:42.480 --> 04:44.280
I'd love your take on this item.

04:44.280 --> 04:45.280
Thanks.

04:45.280 --> 04:46.280
Sure.

04:46.280 --> 04:48.440
So right off the bat, Mike, I'm curious what get client are using.

04:48.440 --> 04:52.200
I have a, I mean, I use the terminal, the one true terminal, Chris.

04:52.200 --> 04:54.640
He mentions in here that he uses get cracking, which I've tried.

04:54.640 --> 04:55.640
Oh, that's what I was going to say.

04:55.640 --> 04:56.640
Is it cracking?

04:56.640 --> 04:57.640
Yeah.

04:57.640 --> 04:58.640
Okay.

04:58.640 --> 04:59.640
That makes a ton of sense.

04:59.640 --> 05:04.520
So I'm going to say that electron apps aren't that bad unless you're on Mac.

05:04.520 --> 05:05.520
Oh, okay.

05:05.520 --> 05:08.400
Even then they're not that bad.

05:08.400 --> 05:14.240
Mac is kind of weirdly broken on macOS in terms of the calling and like releasing the

05:14.240 --> 05:21.240
odd, the audio input device and audio output devices.

05:21.240 --> 05:26.240
But I think the problem, I think this is kind of a problem is have easy in quotes.

05:26.240 --> 05:31.080
It is to write an electron app and just shuffle it to all the platforms that people kind of

05:31.080 --> 05:32.480
write lazy electron apps.

05:32.480 --> 05:33.480
If that makes sense.

05:33.480 --> 05:34.600
Yeah, it does.

05:34.600 --> 05:39.720
Or it's it's just a non-optimized version at least I can tell you when I'm working on

05:39.720 --> 05:45.200
Mac, I noticed the electron apps a lot more because you know, they're not bespoke and

05:45.200 --> 05:47.840
didn't cost me, you know, 27 Starbucks lattes.

05:47.840 --> 05:48.840
Yeah.

05:48.840 --> 05:52.480
Well, the other thing is on Linux, there's a lot less standardization, right?

05:52.480 --> 05:54.960
People just kind of do what they're doing with their apps and sometimes things like

05:54.960 --> 05:57.580
randomly pulling KDE or cute components.

05:57.580 --> 06:01.560
So having a mismatched UI isn't a shocker, right?

06:01.560 --> 06:05.120
When on Mac I can like tell like, okay, a little slack is doing something ridiculous

06:05.120 --> 06:10.280
because it's actually like a Chrome instance, right?

06:10.280 --> 06:12.920
Having said that, I sell electron apps to people.

06:12.920 --> 06:15.600
I think they're great for line of business apps.

06:15.600 --> 06:21.400
I don't think anything but web apps makes a ton of sense in most normal cases, unless

06:21.400 --> 06:27.040
you're doing something like CAD or you know, like flight simulators.

06:27.040 --> 06:28.040
I don't know.

06:28.040 --> 06:29.040
What's your take?

06:29.040 --> 06:34.520
It's the trade offs these days are you probably want to go with web standards in general.

06:34.520 --> 06:41.880
I really connect with where Mike K is coming from in this email because as Linux users,

06:41.880 --> 06:45.640
like you better, you better learn to love electron because it's probably the only shot

06:45.640 --> 06:50.920
Linux users have for large corporations to invest development time is if they invest

06:50.920 --> 06:54.560
development time that can be deployed on multiple environments.

06:54.560 --> 07:00.760
And right now, especially with Microsoft looking at developing electron or I'm sorry, outlook

07:00.760 --> 07:05.520
in electron and likely other office applications and electron in the future after outlook comes

07:05.520 --> 07:06.520
out.

07:06.520 --> 07:10.040
I think it's probably just going to be a lot more, not a lot less, especially in the business

07:10.040 --> 07:14.680
line of applications where enterprise applications have traditionally been kind of clunkers to

07:14.680 --> 07:15.960
begin with.

07:15.960 --> 07:20.880
So UI and performance aren't typically first or even second or third priorities with those

07:20.880 --> 07:21.880
applications.

07:21.880 --> 07:26.520
So I totally see where he's coming from because Linux users, this is their best shot.

07:26.520 --> 07:29.640
And I'll tell you, it's like many things in tech.

07:29.640 --> 07:33.600
The problem is nuanced and complex.

07:33.600 --> 07:39.560
Fundamentally, you could make a security argument that you have a really kind of complicated

07:39.560 --> 07:45.920
chromium stack that gets shipped with these applications and some of them don't get properly

07:45.920 --> 07:46.920
updated.

07:46.920 --> 07:49.000
And so you could have different stacks at different times.

07:49.000 --> 07:54.760
So you could have Slack using one electron stack and you could have Discord using a separate

07:54.760 --> 07:55.760
one.

07:55.760 --> 07:58.160
And perhaps the Slack one is vulnerable to something that Discord isn't.

07:58.160 --> 08:02.480
And so it's kind of a mix match and a large surface for attack.

08:02.480 --> 08:04.120
And so that has a security criticism.

08:04.120 --> 08:08.200
Then you have the performance criticism and you have the native application criticism.

08:08.200 --> 08:14.920
And I think like so many things in technology, none of that stuff fundamentally matters for

08:14.920 --> 08:18.680
why it gets adopted and why it gets deployed and why it gets market share.

08:18.680 --> 08:24.080
And all those things can be true about something and it'll still be a successful technology

08:24.080 --> 08:25.080
platform.

08:25.080 --> 08:31.240
And I hate to be a non-controversial on this, but over time, I think I've started to just

08:31.240 --> 08:32.680
get used to electron apps.

08:32.680 --> 08:36.400
You guys know, I mean, traditionally, I really am not a big fan of web applications, but

08:36.400 --> 08:40.320
the thing that I like at least about electron apps is they get it out of my damn browser

08:40.320 --> 08:45.160
and it's one less thing that my browser can take down or it's one less tab in my browser.

08:45.160 --> 08:48.920
I prefer that these things have their own windows, their own processes so I can kill

08:48.920 --> 08:52.080
them or they can crash on their own and they're independent.

08:52.080 --> 08:56.800
And at least electron, in that sense, it gives me that with these web applications.

08:56.800 --> 09:01.820
And I am kind of delighted sometimes when I'm using an application as a desktop app

09:01.820 --> 09:07.320
and then I go to the web and I find essentially a total and complete implementation that is

09:07.320 --> 09:08.960
in the web for when I need it.

09:08.960 --> 09:14.520
VS codes web server version of this, for example, is just great because it's essentially VS

09:14.520 --> 09:17.840
code that I can run in a Docker container on a web server on my LAN.

09:17.840 --> 09:18.840
And I love that.

09:18.840 --> 09:19.840
Now, you know what?

09:19.840 --> 09:20.840
This is great.

09:20.840 --> 09:22.600
So there is advantages to it as well.

09:22.600 --> 09:27.640
But I definitely can also sympathize with the performance argument.

09:27.640 --> 09:30.280
This is my last point is on Arch Linux.

09:30.280 --> 09:34.840
You can play around with this a little bit and see the difference.

09:34.840 --> 09:40.340
There's specific versions of common packages like Slack and Discord that you can opt to

09:40.340 --> 09:46.580
use the arch system version of electron, which is always very up to date and the most performant

09:46.580 --> 09:47.960
version available.

09:47.960 --> 09:51.080
And so the these packages install the applications.

09:51.080 --> 09:56.160
But instead of using their bundled electron runtime, use the system electron runtime.

09:56.160 --> 10:01.960
And you notice certain things work a lot better and it runs a lot faster.

10:01.960 --> 10:05.360
And you realize that there is still performance gains to be had.

10:05.360 --> 10:09.420
And part of it is just a lack of optimization and a lack and a lack of keeping these things

10:09.420 --> 10:10.420
up to date.

10:10.420 --> 10:16.080
And now on my workstation upstairs here in the studio, my like my office space, I run

10:16.080 --> 10:21.360
these versions of Slack and Discord that use the system electron and they use less RAM

10:21.360 --> 10:23.120
and they perform better.

10:23.120 --> 10:25.900
And if you have if you can look, look for your systems, I'm sure it's available for

10:25.900 --> 10:30.000
other distros and desktops out there and you notice a performance improvement.

10:30.000 --> 10:32.840
So that tells me there is room for improvement.

10:32.840 --> 10:34.880
They're just not taking it.

10:34.880 --> 10:39.000
So I think there's people have a valid argument there, too, like all things in tech.

10:39.000 --> 10:40.000
It's complicated.

10:40.000 --> 10:41.000
Right.

10:41.000 --> 10:42.000
It's complicated.

10:42.000 --> 10:43.000
It's really how it is.

10:43.000 --> 10:44.000
Yeah, I think it's fair.

10:44.000 --> 10:46.160
I think that's I mean, I said one thing.

10:46.160 --> 10:50.240
I don't think anyone's going to win the argument against electron or something like it.

10:50.240 --> 10:55.200
You imagine if, you know, in five years, all of office is just shipped as an electron app.

10:55.200 --> 10:57.320
I mean, the argument's over.

10:57.320 --> 10:58.360
Corporate America is not going to care.

10:58.360 --> 11:01.960
I think that's almost a certainty.

11:01.960 --> 11:07.960
Alex writes in and he says, I'm a mechanical engineer training recently to do some development.

11:07.960 --> 11:13.280
But check out what he does is he says, I'd like to talk about how I think that programming

11:13.280 --> 11:16.880
is becoming a critical skill for anybody working in a technical field.

11:16.880 --> 11:20.120
I've reached the limits of what spreadsheets on on more than one occasion.

11:20.120 --> 11:24.880
And so I've been thankful that I've had programming skills to fall back on.

11:24.880 --> 11:31.960
He's recently been doing CAD design automation in Python, which he says is really changing

11:31.960 --> 11:33.480
his game.

11:33.480 --> 11:36.200
And also he's moved over to the M1 and loving it.

11:36.200 --> 11:40.160
We got several people this week that said that they moved over to the M1 and love it.

11:40.160 --> 11:45.680
So I'm one loving that email and one grand loving if you catch my drift.

11:45.680 --> 11:50.180
And then he asked if I've launched a network wide support, you know, so you can get a membership

11:50.180 --> 11:52.320
and get access to all the show's special features.

11:52.320 --> 11:54.520
I was really, really close, but it backfired on me.

11:54.520 --> 11:56.720
So I kind of hit the pause button.

11:56.720 --> 11:57.720
That's not out yet.

11:57.720 --> 12:01.760
But I am hoping to make good for anybody who's a patron at Patreon.com slash Jupiter signal.

12:01.760 --> 12:05.880
Whatever I come up as a bundle, I'm going to try to include everybody over there.

12:05.880 --> 12:10.440
So Jasmine writes in and we were asking people how they test and she says, how do I test

12:10.440 --> 12:11.440
painfully?

12:11.440 --> 12:12.440
I'm working.

12:12.440 --> 12:13.440
I know.

12:13.440 --> 12:14.440
I love that.

12:14.440 --> 12:19.560
I'm working on an enterprise application and a mono repo built on a Java 8 and Docker.

12:19.560 --> 12:24.480
All our builds use Apache Ant and we do our unit testing with a combination of Junit and

12:24.480 --> 12:26.640
I think it's Makito.

12:26.640 --> 12:33.200
The problem is, besides Java 8 woes, our unit testing is old, crusty and all around a bad

12:33.200 --> 12:34.200
time.

12:34.200 --> 12:38.120
I saw by more than one senior dev that they expected that they expected they'd have time

12:38.120 --> 12:41.040
to fix it and write unit tests that are better.

12:41.040 --> 12:45.020
But of course, that never actually opens and happens and it takes sometimes one to two

12:45.020 --> 12:47.820
and a half times as long as writing actual code.

12:47.820 --> 12:51.280
As of right now, I've been around six months on the job.

12:51.280 --> 12:53.760
They are sadly correct, as I have learned.

12:53.760 --> 12:58.500
Our unit testing is functional integration testing by just a different name, causing

12:58.500 --> 13:02.280
nearly everything to be extremely complex and complicated.

13:02.280 --> 13:06.080
You know, kind of the opposite of what unit testing means.

13:06.080 --> 13:10.040
Our service mocks actually make everything much harder to test or fix while actually

13:10.040 --> 13:13.200
also hiding bugs from us.

13:13.200 --> 13:14.800
This is so painful.

13:14.800 --> 13:18.760
All this of the fact that our testing finds such a minuscule amount of issues, it makes

13:18.760 --> 13:21.340
it full rage inducing.

13:21.340 --> 13:23.560
That is the key thing at the end there.

13:23.560 --> 13:26.400
When they go through all this trouble, it actually just finds like a tiny amount of

13:26.400 --> 13:27.400
issues.

13:27.400 --> 13:28.400
Right.

13:28.400 --> 13:30.400
It's like trivial issues that never would stop a release.

13:30.400 --> 13:31.400
Yeah.

13:31.400 --> 13:32.400
That's how I test.

13:32.400 --> 13:33.400
She says.

13:33.400 --> 13:36.400
Honestly, Jasmine, I feel your pain.

13:36.400 --> 13:41.720
For years, I have been kind of a curmudgeon on the whole unit testing thing.

13:41.720 --> 13:45.560
You know, at a certain scale, I've never seen a case, and I know I'm going to get a lot

13:45.560 --> 13:50.120
of hate mail for this one, where maintaining the unit test doesn't just become like somebody's

13:50.120 --> 13:56.920
job and it's just like this huge overhead and people get tempted to write them.

13:56.920 --> 14:02.480
So I can't think of a good adjective or adverb here, but let's just say they write them in

14:02.480 --> 14:04.200
a way that they're unlikely to fail.

14:04.200 --> 14:05.200
Yeah.

14:05.200 --> 14:06.200
You know what?

14:06.200 --> 14:11.160
I know my fellow Ruby hipsters will want to jump down my throat, but I still don't think

14:11.160 --> 14:13.840
you can replace manual testing.

14:13.840 --> 14:18.520
I haven't bought into the unit testing, and I know that's a sacrilege.

14:18.520 --> 14:21.920
I know there's lots of blog posts about how you're not a real developer unless you embrace

14:21.920 --> 14:24.200
test first development or whatever.

14:24.200 --> 14:28.320
I'm going to obviously have to take the opposite side just so that way I don't get flamed.

14:28.320 --> 14:29.320
Of course.

14:29.320 --> 14:30.440
That's a spicy day.

14:30.440 --> 14:34.040
Because it's important to spend four out of five days in your week writing unit tests,

14:34.040 --> 14:35.040
right?

14:35.040 --> 14:36.040
Well, I know.

14:36.040 --> 14:38.720
Like, where do you even figure out the limit there?

14:38.720 --> 14:41.600
And especially a small team, too.

14:41.600 --> 14:44.560
It's just really, it's a whole other level of...

14:44.560 --> 14:45.560
It's a whole other job.

14:45.560 --> 14:51.840
Well, I think what happens is, and I like what AS, I can't even say that, but someone

14:51.840 --> 14:56.800
in the chat is saying where, you know, testing your implementation details in kind of like

14:56.800 --> 14:57.800
asterisks.

14:57.800 --> 15:03.400
But the problem is as a system gets bigger and bigger and bigger, there's all these weird

15:03.400 --> 15:07.920
details, quote unquote, edge cases and things where, yeah, sure, unit tests are super cool

15:07.920 --> 15:11.960
on like the first 1.0, and they make a ton of sense when you know the logic.

15:11.960 --> 15:17.000
But what if someone comes back to you and says, I don't know, let's rewrite how permissions

15:17.000 --> 15:19.560
work in this giant application.

15:19.560 --> 15:23.080
And you have a couple of hundred tests that now just fail overnight.

15:23.080 --> 15:24.080
Yeah.

15:24.080 --> 15:26.280
Do you even bother really redoing them at that point?

15:26.280 --> 15:28.520
At some point, is it just like a sunk cost, right?

15:28.520 --> 15:29.520
Yeah.

15:29.520 --> 15:30.520
Okay.

15:30.520 --> 15:31.520
So Steve from Canada is doing a check in.

15:31.520 --> 15:34.600
It says, hey, guys, I know you're asking for feedback on our home setups.

15:34.600 --> 15:36.880
I thought I'd chime in as well as with the rest of us.

15:36.880 --> 15:40.560
I'm now working from home, or I guess you should probably say a lot of you.

15:40.560 --> 15:42.880
I'm working from home indefinitely now.

15:42.880 --> 15:48.080
Previous to that, I was about 85 to 90% on the road.

15:48.080 --> 15:53.200
So he went from nearly 90% on the road to indefinitely working at home now.

15:53.200 --> 15:54.200
It's a win.

15:54.200 --> 15:55.200
Yeah.

15:55.200 --> 15:56.200
Yeah.

15:56.200 --> 15:57.200
I agree for him.

15:57.200 --> 15:58.200
It's probably got to be a huge quality of life improvement.

15:58.200 --> 16:03.320
But I was just thinking, if even five or 10% of people who work from who were traveling

16:03.320 --> 16:06.560
that much are now just working from home, things are going to change forever.

16:06.560 --> 16:08.640
I'm really just curious to see where that goes.

16:08.640 --> 16:10.560
But he goes crazy with the monitors.

16:10.560 --> 16:15.640
He has two horizontal monitors on top and a 132 inch 2K monitor in the middle, which

16:15.640 --> 16:16.720
is my setup, too.

16:16.720 --> 16:21.360
But then he has another vertical, additional vertical monitor, I think he puts on the left.

16:21.360 --> 16:25.300
He got himself a new keyboard after using a $20 keyboard for years.

16:25.300 --> 16:30.560
He got himself a Red Dragon, I think a Cerurra mechanical keyboard.

16:30.560 --> 16:31.560
I don't know.

16:31.560 --> 16:32.560
I don't know how these things are pronounced.

16:32.560 --> 16:33.560
Whatever.

16:33.560 --> 16:34.560
It's a dragon.

16:34.560 --> 16:35.560
Let's not piss it off.

16:35.560 --> 16:36.560
I know.

16:36.560 --> 16:37.560
I was like, dragons are great.

16:37.560 --> 16:38.560
But you know what he says in here?

16:38.560 --> 16:39.560
And this is interesting.

16:39.560 --> 16:41.240
My buddy Alex has kind of shown me this, too.

16:41.240 --> 16:45.120
He's surprised nobody's written in and talked about what a hack it is to have a 3D printer

16:45.120 --> 16:49.240
because he prints bins for stuff and desk organizers.

16:49.240 --> 16:54.840
And he says his whole desk is completely decolored now because of his 3D printer.

16:54.840 --> 16:58.240
So I think, you know, he says he tried to meet up with you one time in Jersey or twice

16:58.240 --> 16:59.240
in Jersey.

16:59.240 --> 17:00.240
So he's that Steve, if you remember.

17:00.240 --> 17:03.400
He must have been the Steve that was stalking you for a bit.

17:03.400 --> 17:04.400
I don't mind being stalked.

17:04.400 --> 17:05.400
That's OK.

17:05.400 --> 17:06.400
You know what?

17:06.400 --> 17:07.400
I'm pretty lonely these days.

17:07.400 --> 17:08.400
I could use a stalker.

17:08.400 --> 17:09.400
Especially if the stalker's bringing beer.

17:09.400 --> 17:10.400
You know?

17:10.400 --> 17:11.400
Well, I'm trying to trim down.

17:11.400 --> 17:15.200
Let's do, like, Tito's gluten-free vodka, but sure.

17:15.200 --> 17:16.200
Are you really?

17:16.200 --> 17:17.200
Are you?

17:17.200 --> 17:19.160
You're not doing the glutes anymore, huh?

17:19.160 --> 17:23.200
No, I am doing the glutes, but I've lost 20 pounds, man.

17:23.200 --> 17:24.200
Congratulations.

17:24.200 --> 17:25.200
That's awesome.

17:25.200 --> 17:27.160
And mostly just cutting back on carbs and stuff or what?

17:27.160 --> 17:28.160
Yeah.

17:28.160 --> 17:29.920
And I've been doing intermittent fasting.

17:29.920 --> 17:30.920
You know what?

17:30.920 --> 17:34.040
People laughed at me when I talked about that a couple of years ago, but it's a serious

17:34.040 --> 17:38.400
way to get just like, I don't know, it makes kind of sounds like just stop eating after

17:38.400 --> 17:39.400
sunset.

17:39.400 --> 17:40.400
Like, is that such a crazy idea?

17:40.400 --> 17:41.400
Yeah.

17:41.400 --> 17:45.320
Well, I don't eat until roughly 11, and then I don't eat at night, so.

17:45.320 --> 17:47.480
So what time do you stop eating at night?

17:47.480 --> 17:49.720
I mean, sunset right now is kind of stupid.

17:49.720 --> 17:50.720
It's like 530.

17:50.720 --> 17:51.720
Yeah.

17:51.720 --> 17:54.760
But I don't eat past, I think, seven or eight, but seven.

17:54.760 --> 17:56.320
Seven's usually my cutoff, too, if I do it.

17:56.320 --> 17:57.560
I got to get back into it.

17:57.560 --> 18:00.640
It helps because I have a four-year-old who I currently have who's like, yeah, no, I'm

18:00.640 --> 18:01.640
tired.

18:01.640 --> 18:02.640
Let's go to bed.

18:02.640 --> 18:06.000
See, I have the opposite problem, is my little monsters want to eat until right up until

18:06.000 --> 18:10.360
bedtime despite me trying hours before bedtime, making sure they've eaten everything.

18:10.360 --> 18:11.360
Yeah.

18:11.360 --> 18:12.360
And brush their teeth.

18:12.360 --> 18:15.600
They still get hungry right around bedtime constantly.

18:15.600 --> 18:19.960
They just are little weeds, and it's cliche to say it, but I legitimately have no idea

18:19.960 --> 18:20.960
where they put it all.

18:20.960 --> 18:21.960
Something else.

18:21.960 --> 18:22.960
Oh, no.

18:22.960 --> 18:23.960
My kids, my son's the same way.

18:23.960 --> 18:29.960
It's like, I bought a giant bag of apples, and I'm like, this will last a week.

18:29.960 --> 18:35.080
And I was at Publix today buying another bag of apples, and it's Monday.

18:35.080 --> 18:37.360
I bought it, granted, I brought it on Friday, but yeah.

18:37.360 --> 18:39.520
This will last a week, and it's gone in a day.

18:39.520 --> 18:44.040
Yeah, cut out beer, cut out, and it's basically if you want to drink, it's just like clear

18:44.040 --> 18:48.440
liquor, but like club soda, no tonic, no mixers.

18:48.440 --> 18:52.440
Like I don't eat out much anymore because, you know, the apocalypse.

18:52.440 --> 18:56.040
I went the opposite way as far as that, is I, instead of going to grocery stores, I started

18:56.040 --> 18:57.600
ordering food a lot more.

18:57.600 --> 19:01.520
I was doing that for a while, and I ballooned up, and I was kind of like, okay, no.

19:01.520 --> 19:02.960
Yeah, it's wild.

19:02.960 --> 19:05.080
It's wild how much eating out affects that.

19:05.080 --> 19:06.080
It's really something.

19:06.080 --> 19:09.120
Well, and you know, I'm single now, so I'm on the prowl, so you know.

19:09.120 --> 19:14.680
You want to be a slim and cut gentleman who is attractive to the ladies.

19:14.680 --> 19:21.360
Yes, and ladies, if you happen to own any patents for, I don't know, automation technology,

19:21.360 --> 19:25.080
I would love to meet you, and there's a deal we can make.

19:25.080 --> 19:26.560
I love it.

19:26.560 --> 19:30.520
In the meantime, Jason writes in, you know, we were asking people about their work setups.

19:30.520 --> 19:32.280
We got a lot of M1ers.

19:32.280 --> 19:34.660
They're really representing, they're hyped right now.

19:34.660 --> 19:35.660
Take out the robe, guys.

19:35.660 --> 19:36.660
Yeah.

19:36.660 --> 19:37.660
Let's go.

19:37.660 --> 19:38.660
Take them out.

19:38.660 --> 19:42.520
Although the thing is, a lot of the M1ers out there are also robe bros.

19:42.520 --> 19:43.520
I know.

19:43.520 --> 19:44.520
There's a high overlap.

19:44.520 --> 19:45.520
Yeah.

19:45.520 --> 19:53.080
You know, I've never in the history of this show seen a new product take off in our audience

19:53.080 --> 19:54.080
like this before.

19:54.080 --> 19:56.000
Like the robe or the M1 or both?

19:56.000 --> 19:57.000
Well, both, actually.

19:57.000 --> 19:58.000
Oh, Jesus.

19:58.000 --> 20:03.000
I mean, I'd say we probably got seven people this week that were writing us from an M1.

20:03.000 --> 20:04.000
Oh, yeah.

20:04.000 --> 20:05.000
I got a bunch of tweets.

20:05.000 --> 20:06.000
People are saying they love it.

20:06.000 --> 20:07.000
Yeah.

20:07.000 --> 20:08.000
It's kind of significant.

20:08.000 --> 20:09.000
Jason writes in.

20:09.000 --> 20:10.000
He's on a Linux stack.

20:10.000 --> 20:14.040
He says, I'm a full-time open-source developer working on a project that's written in C,

20:14.040 --> 20:18.120
and as of 2017 includes some Rust components, and I couldn't be happier.

20:18.120 --> 20:19.360
Oh, ho, ho.

20:19.360 --> 20:20.360
Got a Rust mention in here.

20:20.360 --> 20:21.360
It's been a bit.

20:21.360 --> 20:22.360
Take a shot.

20:22.360 --> 20:23.360
Yeah.

20:23.360 --> 20:26.680
But only something clear with Sparkling Water.

20:26.680 --> 20:27.680
You know, like Jim.

20:27.680 --> 20:32.080
He says, my day-to-day environment has been Fedora with GNOME since Fedora S7.

20:32.080 --> 20:36.800
I use the Terminal, Emacs, IntelliJ for Rust, and some experimentation with VS Code these

20:36.800 --> 20:37.800
days.

20:37.800 --> 20:41.320
My 10-plus years with IntelliJ is a hard habit to break.

20:41.320 --> 20:45.200
And of course, Chrome and too many electron apps for all the chat systems.

20:45.200 --> 20:47.720
There's an electron slam.

20:47.720 --> 20:50.680
In the evenings, I play with writing crypto trading bots.

20:50.680 --> 20:52.880
Oh, Jason, let's talk, my friend.

20:52.880 --> 20:56.360
Let's talk, which is a great way to try out new things with Rust.

20:56.360 --> 20:58.560
Jason, email your buddy, Chris.

20:58.560 --> 20:59.700
Come on.

20:59.700 --> 21:01.160
Let's get some Ethereum action going.

21:01.160 --> 21:02.160
Jesus Christ.

21:02.160 --> 21:03.160
Robes of Ethereum.

21:03.160 --> 21:04.160
I know, right?

21:04.160 --> 21:05.160
Well, come on.

21:05.160 --> 21:06.160
What else do I have?

21:06.160 --> 21:08.800
Well, come on, what else do I got going?

21:08.800 --> 21:09.800
You know?

21:09.800 --> 21:10.800
I'm in the same boat.

21:10.800 --> 21:11.800
Hook me up.

21:11.800 --> 21:12.800
I got some GPUs.

21:12.800 --> 21:16.560
Ethereum's going to be my health plan and my retirement plan.

21:16.560 --> 21:24.920
Ice says, I have an aging i7 overclocked to 4.2 gigahertz, MVMEs, and AMD RX 580s.

21:24.920 --> 21:27.160
Sounds a lot like my setup.

21:27.160 --> 21:30.880
And I have some off-lease Xeon servers in the closet running Elasticsearch, Plex, et

21:30.880 --> 21:31.880
cetera.

21:31.880 --> 21:32.960
Keep up the great work.

21:32.960 --> 21:35.960
I appreciate Jason telling us about his server setup, too.

21:35.960 --> 21:39.960
You know, people didn't really tell us if they're running any home server infrastructure.

21:39.960 --> 21:40.960
So that's your next question.

21:40.960 --> 21:43.320
Shoot, I should have asked you last time.

21:43.320 --> 21:46.420
What is your, do you have a little home setup system?

21:46.420 --> 21:48.340
Maybe some VMs for testing?

21:48.340 --> 21:49.340
Some CI stuff?

21:49.340 --> 21:50.340
Let us know.

21:50.340 --> 21:51.340
Coder.show slash contact.

21:51.340 --> 21:53.440
Yeah, I actually was wondering that, too.

21:53.440 --> 21:56.720
With COVID and everything, are more people just being like, to hell with it, let me just

21:56.720 --> 21:58.440
run a server?

21:58.440 --> 22:00.340
Maybe that's why people are buying Mac Minis.

22:00.340 --> 22:02.440
So Asish wants to write in to make me sad.

22:02.440 --> 22:07.440
M1 Air with eight gigs of RAM, he says, I mostly do back-end node nowadays, also deploying

22:07.440 --> 22:10.520
to Lambda, and I have yet to feel constrained by the eight gig limit.

22:10.520 --> 22:12.600
Now, you got one with 16 gigs, right, Mike?

22:12.600 --> 22:15.800
Yeah, because I like to let money on fire, but let's just keep moving.

22:15.800 --> 22:19.240
Have you noticed it being a limitation in terms of performance at all?

22:19.240 --> 22:23.920
What I've noticed is that it makes me want to take this iMac Pro and drop kick it.

22:23.920 --> 22:26.280
But like you haven't like ran out of RAM, right?

22:26.280 --> 22:27.280
Never.

22:27.280 --> 22:28.880
I haven't even like seen a stutter.

22:28.880 --> 22:33.120
I think unless I'm doing multiple VMs, I could really make 16 gigs work.

22:33.120 --> 22:36.560
I prefer to have, actually I don't even need 32, 24 would be the sweet spot.

22:36.560 --> 22:41.960
But anyways, he doesn't know if he'll hit that limit yet, but he does plan to do some

22:41.960 --> 22:42.960
VM soon.

22:42.960 --> 22:47.560
He initially got the M1 because his web meetings on his laptop were just sucking and he wanted

22:47.560 --> 22:49.840
to appear at least somewhat presentable.

22:49.840 --> 22:52.200
And so he got the cheapest MacBook Air possible.

22:52.200 --> 22:56.520
He says, to make me a little sad though, me, Chris, I'd expect the desktop to also go the

22:56.520 --> 23:01.680
way of the console when ARM and RISC-V come to x86 home turf.

23:01.680 --> 23:05.020
I like being able to load whatever I want on there.

23:05.020 --> 23:06.200
That's my thing.

23:06.200 --> 23:10.460
That's the thing about the x86 platform is you could always build your own beast if you

23:10.460 --> 23:11.460
really had to.

23:11.460 --> 23:17.800
You could go crazy with some Threadripper system and 128 gigabytes of RAM and 24 terabytes

23:17.800 --> 23:18.860
of internal storage.

23:18.860 --> 23:21.240
You could really go nuts with some of these.

23:21.240 --> 23:27.320
I was looking at the Lenovo P60, which is a Threadripper based Linux workstation that

23:27.320 --> 23:30.480
starts at around $6,000.

23:30.480 --> 23:35.840
And then you look at like the Thaleo, which you can just spec out to be an absolute monster.

23:35.840 --> 23:40.280
I bet it's going to be a long time before Apple meets that kind of performance.

23:40.280 --> 23:42.040
How much you want to bet?

23:42.040 --> 23:44.840
Put it in the only currency you actually care about, robes.

23:44.840 --> 23:47.360
I'll bet you a robe.

23:47.360 --> 23:48.360
Bet me a robe?

23:48.360 --> 23:49.360
All right.

23:49.360 --> 23:50.360
I bet you a robe with a selfie.

23:50.360 --> 23:57.280
So we have a topic we should wait till we get there, but I have some thoughts too.

23:57.280 --> 23:59.200
Datadog.com slash Coder Radio.

23:59.200 --> 24:01.520
This episode right here, yeah, it's sponsored by Datadog.

24:01.520 --> 24:02.520
Now who is Datadog?

24:02.520 --> 24:05.360
Well, they're solving big problems for you.

24:05.360 --> 24:10.840
All your applications, all your systems across all your clouds in one place through the unified

24:10.840 --> 24:15.560
monitoring and analytics platform that gives you comprehensive visibility into your cloud,

24:15.560 --> 24:19.080
into your hybrid clouds, like you got some on-prems, yeah, they're going to do that.

24:19.080 --> 24:21.640
You quickly analyze the performance of your Linux servers.

24:21.640 --> 24:26.040
You get beautiful real-time dashboards, got to go see these dashboards at their website.

24:26.040 --> 24:28.260
Go to Datadog.com slash Coder Radio.

24:28.260 --> 24:33.120
You can customize the dashboards and troubleshoot issues in seconds with a unified view of your

24:33.120 --> 24:36.060
metrics, your traces, your logs, all in one place.

24:36.060 --> 24:40.400
And then you have turnkey integrations with over 400 technologies, so really make it easy

24:40.400 --> 24:42.280
to just plug in and start working.

24:42.280 --> 24:46.720
You can use Datadog to watch key metrics on your Linux boxes, compare them with metrics

24:46.720 --> 24:49.640
from like, say, just the application inside a container.

24:49.640 --> 24:53.280
I mean, you get real full stack visibility with these tools.

24:53.280 --> 24:54.880
You should really check it out.

24:54.880 --> 24:58.360
They wrote some of their agents and rewrote some of their agents semi-recently a couple

24:58.360 --> 24:59.360
years ago now.

24:59.360 --> 25:03.880
They've iterated on a few times in Go, and it's super simple to get up and going if you

25:03.880 --> 25:04.880
need one of those tools.

25:04.880 --> 25:08.320
Their integrations are just really fast and straightforward.

25:08.320 --> 25:13.040
And you can start a free trial if you create one dashboard, you get a free Datadog t-shirt

25:13.040 --> 25:18.440
by supporting us and checking out datadog.com slash CoderRadio.

25:18.440 --> 25:21.160
Support the show, free swag, unify your metrics.

25:21.160 --> 25:22.480
It's a win, win, win.

25:22.480 --> 25:24.720
Imagine it, you're troubleshooting a problem.

25:24.720 --> 25:28.420
One team needs to communicate with another team, Datadog can help you visualize it all

25:28.420 --> 25:36.200
across the entire infrastructure, datadog.com slash CoderRadio.

25:36.200 --> 25:39.280
Little bit more feedback and then we will continue on.

25:39.280 --> 25:41.680
We have so much email, it's great.

25:41.680 --> 25:43.660
And I really actually appreciate it, I love it.

25:43.660 --> 25:47.080
It's exciting to open it up and go, man, look at all these people that wrote in.

25:47.080 --> 25:48.700
And we had one really cool one.

25:48.700 --> 25:53.840
We had a listener who's specializing in high-speed optical transceivers, how about that?

25:53.840 --> 25:58.560
Gabriel is a software engineer for a small company specializing in these optical transceivers,

25:58.560 --> 26:01.380
and the team is developing a new transceiver from scratch.

26:01.380 --> 26:05.840
He writes the firmware for the transceiver in addition to any programs that need to interface

26:05.840 --> 26:08.920
with it for testing, you know, for development or production uses.

26:08.920 --> 26:12.800
And he says, since I'm working with embedded devices, my day-to-day involves reading too

26:12.800 --> 26:17.460
much documentation for too little information and dealing with hardware oddities and working

26:17.460 --> 26:20.080
around limited development software.

26:20.080 --> 26:24.640
I am forced to use Windows as the tool chain for the microcontroller we're using.

26:24.640 --> 26:27.000
It's proprietary, it only works on Windows.

26:27.000 --> 26:30.760
The compiler is built into the proprietary IDE.

26:30.760 --> 26:33.800
Actually he says, thank Jar Jar, it's not based on Eclipse.

26:33.800 --> 26:37.260
You're so welcome.

26:37.260 --> 26:38.720
Built in, you gotta love that.

26:38.720 --> 26:42.820
It looks like it was pulled right out of Windows 95, it says there's a few desktop applications

26:42.820 --> 26:43.820
I do write.

26:43.820 --> 26:46.560
My go-to language is Rust.

26:46.560 --> 26:47.560
Second Rust mention.

26:47.560 --> 26:48.560
It's a double.

26:48.560 --> 26:52.760
I'll be honest, I don't make anything more complex than a CLI application, but the libraries

26:52.760 --> 26:55.060
available for us make it so easy.

26:55.060 --> 26:58.920
I've been using Rust for years and I've loved nearly every moment of it.

26:58.920 --> 27:02.280
If I say much more than that, I'll just start sounding like a fanboy.

27:02.280 --> 27:03.840
Keep up the work, thanks you two.

27:03.840 --> 27:09.200
If you're gonna be a fanboy, Rust is obviously the right choice.

27:09.200 --> 27:10.200
Not a bad one, right?

27:10.200 --> 27:11.200
Right.

27:11.200 --> 27:16.240
I mean, it's a language that punishes you up front.

27:16.240 --> 27:18.480
So you don't get angry customers later.

27:18.480 --> 27:20.200
That's kind of all I want.

27:20.200 --> 27:22.600
Okay, so this is our last one today.

27:22.600 --> 27:27.440
Brian writes in, he works for a US hosting company, we're not gonna say which one.

27:27.440 --> 27:33.820
He says they got great sysadmins, a good solid sysadmin team, but he is the sole developer

27:33.820 --> 27:36.440
for the entire company.

27:36.440 --> 27:42.640
So his roles range from a small command line utility to distribute services and some of

27:42.640 --> 27:47.440
their microservices to entire front ends written in React.

27:47.440 --> 27:51.920
He also ends up doing a lot of his own DevOps work to support his applications.

27:51.920 --> 27:53.480
Can you imagine?

27:53.480 --> 27:57.800
Like Brian must be like tense and stressed all the time.

27:57.800 --> 27:59.480
Just yikes.

27:59.480 --> 28:04.440
Brian, convince your managers to hire a vendor to help you with that development work.

28:04.440 --> 28:05.440
Right.

28:05.440 --> 28:07.960
And I just happened to know one, the mad botter in Florida.

28:07.960 --> 28:08.960
Boom.

28:08.960 --> 28:13.240
No, but kidding aside, that's terrible.

28:13.240 --> 28:15.360
That's just a lot of ground for one person to cover.

28:15.360 --> 28:16.960
It really is.

28:16.960 --> 28:20.440
And to make things a little more challenging, there's several thousand servers that are

28:20.440 --> 28:21.800
running Windows.

28:21.800 --> 28:24.560
So he has to write a lot of stuff that interfaces with them too.

28:24.560 --> 28:26.120
He runs Fedora on his workstation.

28:26.120 --> 28:28.240
He's got an XPS 15 for that.

28:28.240 --> 28:29.720
Good choice.

28:29.720 --> 28:31.200
Yeah, right.

28:31.200 --> 28:32.980
But his predecessor, I think, used a lot of.NET.

28:32.980 --> 28:36.200
So he's been learning it, been picking it up.

28:36.200 --> 28:39.040
And he's actually pretty happy that he can get it working as well as it does on Linux.

28:39.040 --> 28:41.260
And management is happy that he's using their preferred language.

28:41.260 --> 28:43.560
So that's all actually kind of working out pretty well.

28:43.560 --> 28:48.680
He says it's a hobby he recently branched out to writing small GTK based applications

28:48.680 --> 28:55.280
in C. And he's making inroads into learning things like Rust.

28:55.280 --> 28:56.280
It's a Rust week, Mike.

28:56.280 --> 28:57.280
It's a Rust week.

28:57.280 --> 28:59.560
It's time to hit the ground, folks, because that's a triple shot.

28:59.560 --> 29:00.680
No kidding.

29:00.680 --> 29:01.680
People are going to get wasted.

29:01.680 --> 29:02.680
He says all the best.

29:02.680 --> 29:03.680
Thanks, Brian.

29:03.680 --> 29:09.480
So for the hobby dev, I would, or hobby development rather, I would almost suggest you take a

29:09.480 --> 29:13.680
look at like an Uno or an Avalonia if you already are proficient in C Sharp.

29:13.680 --> 29:16.800
I know you're doing it for a hobby, so maybe you want to branch out.

29:16.800 --> 29:21.280
But if it's something you need for yourself or you just want to put out there, if you're

29:21.280 --> 29:27.720
familiar with the.NET stack, those are, I mean, I've done quite a bit of Avalonia, a

29:27.720 --> 29:31.980
little more than I'd like to admit to, to be totally honest with you.

29:31.980 --> 29:33.440
It's a great stack.

29:33.440 --> 29:42.040
It's maybe I'm hesitating a little because now Xamarin is getting Linux support and without

29:42.040 --> 29:47.120
putting a dog in this fight, Uno has kind of surpassed them in a lot of ways.

29:47.120 --> 29:53.960
It's still a great platform, and the big benefit is their implementation of GTK apps is actually

29:53.960 --> 30:02.960
like native GTK, where I believe Uno is still a WA WebAssembly, WASM, how do you say that?

30:02.960 --> 30:05.440
Do you say WASM or I just say WebAssembly now?

30:05.440 --> 30:10.120
Well, I say WASM to be kind of a little bit of a troll about it.

30:10.120 --> 30:11.120
It's WASM.

30:11.120 --> 30:14.320
Yeah, but Brian, maybe it's time to polish up that resume too.

30:14.320 --> 30:15.320
Just saying.

30:15.320 --> 30:16.320
Yeah.

30:16.320 --> 30:17.320
Yeah, I wonder.

30:17.320 --> 30:20.720
I hope he's got a decent package, I mean, payment package.

30:20.720 --> 30:23.480
I was going to say, really, Chris?

30:23.480 --> 30:26.480
You know, that's just, that's not the way I...

30:26.480 --> 30:29.560
You know, we do the show at night and we're just a little looser than we used to be.

30:29.560 --> 30:34.200
I just, I was thinking payments and like bonuses and health insurance, you know, the whole

30:34.200 --> 30:35.200
package.

30:35.200 --> 30:36.200
Wait, health insurance?

30:36.200 --> 30:37.200
Yeah, I know, right?

30:37.200 --> 30:38.200
What are we, Sweden?

30:38.200 --> 30:40.200
Don't even get me started.

30:40.200 --> 30:41.200
You know what?

30:41.200 --> 30:44.520
All the European listeners get mad at us every time we do that.

30:44.520 --> 30:48.080
They roll their eyes at us whenever we talk about health insurance, ISPs, or cell phone

30:48.080 --> 30:49.080
plans.

30:49.080 --> 30:50.880
Remember the dude who was like, just come move to Germany?

30:50.880 --> 30:51.880
Yeah.

30:51.880 --> 30:52.880
Yeah.

30:52.880 --> 30:53.880
He's probably right though.

30:53.880 --> 30:56.800
I mean, I do like beer and pretzels, although I'm off beer right now.

30:56.800 --> 31:02.120
I'm toying long term, like, you know, when the kids are all old and grown up and, you

31:02.120 --> 31:05.120
know, they have their own lives and don't care about old dad anymore.

31:05.120 --> 31:06.960
I could podcast from anywhere in the world, right?

31:06.960 --> 31:07.960
So why stay here?

31:07.960 --> 31:09.700
Why not go somewhere warm?

31:09.700 --> 31:12.080
Whatever happened to Amsterdam?

31:12.080 --> 31:13.080
Remember that whole phenomenon?

31:13.080 --> 31:14.080
Oh yeah.

31:14.080 --> 31:15.440
The app developers were moving to Amsterdam.

31:15.440 --> 31:16.440
Yeah.

31:16.440 --> 31:18.480
Maybe I should go check in and see what happened to Amsterdam.

31:18.480 --> 31:21.160
You know, I don't know if I'm, I don't think that's where I want to go though.

31:21.160 --> 31:24.400
I think table stakes are an M1 to get in though.

31:24.400 --> 31:26.960
Oh geez.

31:26.960 --> 31:29.200
I got to tell you about this M1 situation.

31:29.200 --> 31:30.200
Let's do it.

31:30.200 --> 31:31.200
All right.

31:31.200 --> 31:36.880
So why don't we, to get there, why don't we talk about what Intel had to say recently.

31:36.880 --> 31:37.880
That they're sorry.

31:37.880 --> 31:45.600
They've got a new CEO and he's, uh, he's shooting some fire.

31:45.600 --> 31:50.620
He says that Apple is a lifestyle brand and that they have to deliver better products

31:50.620 --> 31:55.480
in the PC ecosystem than that lifestyle company and corporate Tino makes.

31:55.480 --> 31:57.720
Uh, we have to be good in the future.

31:57.720 --> 32:05.760
He says, we should ship products that don't suck.

32:05.760 --> 32:09.600
They gotta be good in the future, so problem solved, right?

32:09.600 --> 32:14.720
I mean, my general strategy for 2021 is just suck a little less.

32:14.720 --> 32:15.720
Yeah.

32:15.720 --> 32:19.680
Like I kind of, I saw this when you put it in the doc and I was like, I actually thought

32:19.680 --> 32:20.680
it was a joke.

32:20.680 --> 32:21.680
I know.

32:21.680 --> 32:25.480
And calling the Apple, which is one of the richest companies in the world with one of

32:25.480 --> 32:31.600
the more interesting tech stories ever, uh, calling them a lifestyle brand is clearly

32:31.600 --> 32:35.960
just trying to be demeaning to what used to be one of their best customers, but, uh, their

32:35.960 --> 32:42.900
current CEO, Bob Swan is stepping down on Feb 5th, uh, 15th, 15th, 15th, not fifth.

32:42.900 --> 32:44.880
And the new guy who's not a new guy at all.

32:44.880 --> 32:49.320
In fact, I think he worked at Intel for like 30 years left and is coming back to replace

32:49.320 --> 32:50.320
Bob Swan.

32:50.320 --> 32:52.360
His name's Pat.

32:52.360 --> 32:53.680
And he told him to be good.

32:53.680 --> 32:59.000
I assume as a CEO, you don't want to say, you know what guys, let's just be really lousy

32:59.000 --> 33:00.000
this year.

33:00.000 --> 33:05.080
Really, you know, this year our CPUs are going to be hotter and slower.

33:05.080 --> 33:06.080
That's the plan.

33:06.080 --> 33:07.080
Right?

33:07.080 --> 33:08.080
Yeah.

33:08.080 --> 33:09.080
I think they're outsourcing some of that.

33:09.080 --> 33:11.200
I think they've just kind of decided, fine, we're going to outsource the TSMC a little

33:11.200 --> 33:17.640
bit for some of the manufacturing, um, we'll see, but, um, along, along these same lines,

33:17.640 --> 33:23.640
there's been a lot of information that kind of just so happened to leak about Apple during

33:23.640 --> 33:29.500
CES week, just news that just happened to dominate the CES news cycle accidentally came

33:29.500 --> 33:35.160
out from Mark Gurman, which he, and also, so there's two, there's two sources this week,

33:35.160 --> 33:42.660
both who have extremely accurate track records, uh, Ming-Chao Kuo and Mark Gurman have really

33:42.660 --> 33:45.600
significantly pretty, pretty accurate track records.

33:45.600 --> 33:51.960
They are saying that Apple has a brand new strategy for the, uh, Apple processor based

33:51.960 --> 33:58.740
14 inch and 16 inch Mac books that will be coming out this year, featuring Apple Silicon.

33:58.740 --> 34:05.700
And the big idea is get ready for this, the return of MagSafe, adding more ports back

34:05.700 --> 34:11.960
and getting rid of the touch bar, literally just undoing and wiping away the entire Johnny

34:11.960 --> 34:18.600
Ive era because the keyboard's now gone, touch bar is now gone and bringing MagSafe back

34:18.600 --> 34:22.680
would basically wipe out Johnny, Johnny Ives touch on the Mac book.

34:22.680 --> 34:26.320
Kind of admitting that the last five or six years or seven years or whatever it's been

34:26.320 --> 34:28.160
of Mac books was a failure.

34:28.160 --> 34:29.160
Yeah.

34:29.160 --> 34:31.640
One of the things I love about my air is it does not have a touch bar.

34:31.640 --> 34:34.640
Uh, you know, I guess I never really used it enough to care.

34:34.640 --> 34:35.640
I don't know.

34:35.640 --> 34:38.840
It just seemed fine, but yeah, it seems like extra taps to do basic things like turn up

34:38.840 --> 34:39.840
the volume.

34:39.840 --> 34:43.800
Every once in a while the touch bar gets weird, but we don't need to bash on it because it's

34:43.800 --> 34:45.420
obviously going away.

34:45.420 --> 34:49.840
That's the real meta story though, that in order to be competitive again, not just adding

34:49.840 --> 34:56.320
a faster processor and just sticking with USB-C, but actually kind of considering additional

34:56.320 --> 34:57.320
ports.

34:57.320 --> 34:58.880
And German, you know, he's usually right.

34:58.880 --> 34:59.880
Yeah.

34:59.880 --> 35:00.880
I do.

35:00.880 --> 35:06.000
I do worry about the MagSafe thing only because is that going to be a proprietary port now?

35:06.000 --> 35:07.000
Probably I'd bet.

35:07.000 --> 35:09.440
I'd bet it's still with charge over USB-C as well.

35:09.440 --> 35:14.480
You get both, you know, just going to be confusing cause they've got MagSafe for the phone.

35:14.480 --> 35:25.320
Also 21.5 and 27 inch M based Mac iMacs with edge to edge screens and a Mac pro mini with

35:25.320 --> 35:26.320
a brand new display.

35:26.320 --> 35:30.840
This is, this is, this is what they're claiming is coming this year.

35:30.840 --> 35:33.080
And you know, we've been getting people that have read into the written of the show and

35:33.080 --> 35:35.200
saying, Chris, you need to get an M1.

35:35.200 --> 35:39.760
You need to experience what this is like because it's a pretty big shift and just reading about

35:39.760 --> 35:42.440
it isn't sufficient to understand it.

35:42.440 --> 35:44.400
And I have had that happen.

35:44.400 --> 35:49.280
I feel like Docker is my most recent thing where, you know, we knew about Docker from

35:49.280 --> 35:50.560
day one.

35:50.560 --> 35:52.840
We talked to the, we talked to the original founders.

35:52.840 --> 35:56.000
When they were still cloud, whatever their name, dot cloud, right?

35:56.000 --> 36:01.720
So we got it, you know, conceptually I got it, but it really wasn't until I started deploying

36:01.720 --> 36:02.720
my own services.

36:02.720 --> 36:07.760
When I switched from using VMs to using containers, I was like, Oh, the application and the data

36:07.760 --> 36:08.760
are totally separate.

36:08.760 --> 36:12.080
I can destroy and stand up the application whenever I want, have the absolute latest

36:12.080 --> 36:15.920
version and it just keeps on ticking and I can just package that up and send it around

36:15.920 --> 36:16.920
the world.

36:16.920 --> 36:17.920
That's amazing.

36:17.920 --> 36:18.920
And then I got it right.

36:18.920 --> 36:23.800
Then I really got why it's, why it's taken off like wildfire and people have said, it's

36:23.800 --> 36:27.840
sort of similar, sort of similar with the M one max.

36:27.840 --> 36:29.280
And I don't have a counter to that.

36:29.280 --> 36:32.560
You've kind of suggested that's true as well.

36:32.560 --> 36:35.680
So I've been thinking about what to do in that regard.

36:35.680 --> 36:43.200
And I'll tell you in just a moment, lino.com slash coder, go to lino.com slash coder and

36:43.200 --> 36:44.200
support the show.

36:44.200 --> 36:49.280
I got to hold on a second here, a hundred dollars, a hundred dollars.

36:49.280 --> 36:54.160
Obviously apparently crazy Linode is giving you a hundred dollars if you go to lino.com

36:54.160 --> 37:00.120
slash coder, you get a hundred dollars in credit to use on Linode for 60 days towards

37:00.120 --> 37:01.120
your new kids.

37:01.120 --> 37:02.120
Can't be right.

37:02.120 --> 37:03.120
Somebody verify this.

37:03.120 --> 37:05.200
You know, Linode is our server provider.

37:05.200 --> 37:07.400
We hear from people in the audience that use it all the time.

37:07.400 --> 37:12.320
Listener Jeff use Linode to migrate a next cloud instance as a test scenario before he

37:12.320 --> 37:13.920
went and deployed it on his land.

37:13.920 --> 37:16.980
But while testing it, he realized, shoot, these Linode systems are so much faster than

37:16.980 --> 37:18.840
my local box sucking down power.

37:18.840 --> 37:20.320
He just migrated to Linode.

37:20.320 --> 37:24.360
I just think that's so funny because it was a perfect test for him.

37:24.360 --> 37:28.280
Like not only did he verify that he knew how to migrate the data, but then he's like, this

37:28.280 --> 37:29.280
is way better.

37:29.280 --> 37:31.680
But I use Linode to host everything.

37:31.680 --> 37:33.960
I was just messing around with our matrix server today.

37:33.960 --> 37:34.960
That's running up on Linode.

37:34.960 --> 37:36.560
I've been messing around with peer tube.

37:36.560 --> 37:38.040
Of course that's up on Linode.

37:38.040 --> 37:43.080
Our backend infrastructure for JB 3.0, it's all Linode because you get fast SSD disk.

37:43.080 --> 37:47.640
You get 40 gigabit connections to the hypervisors and 11 data centers around the world.

37:47.640 --> 37:50.760
But they have this UI that sits on top of it with their cloud dashboard.

37:50.760 --> 37:53.560
That's really intuitive, really clean, simple.

37:53.560 --> 37:57.360
When you pull up one of your Linodes right at the top, you get all the vital information,

37:57.360 --> 38:00.760
how to connect to it, what its address is, how to get a remote console.

38:00.760 --> 38:03.960
And you come down from that, you get descriptions about its resources.

38:03.960 --> 38:06.800
You get a snapshot of its CPU and disk and network IO.

38:06.800 --> 38:10.600
And it's all just right there organized for you really intelligently.

38:10.600 --> 38:14.240
And you can turn on and enable backups with just a couple of clicks.

38:14.240 --> 38:18.200
You don't really have to be some sort of Linux expert to make it work.

38:18.200 --> 38:22.760
But if you are, Linode doesn't prevent you from getting behind the scenes and really

38:22.760 --> 38:23.760
messing around with stuff.

38:23.760 --> 38:31.320
I remember one time I was setting up a mesh VPN system for my mobile router and I needed

38:31.320 --> 38:38.320
to actually re-image Linode with their weird Linux appliance image.

38:38.320 --> 38:44.640
And Linode actually had official documentation on how to do something like that.

38:44.640 --> 38:46.280
Think about that for a moment.

38:46.280 --> 38:49.480
Unlike entry-level service providers, they don't try to hide that stuff.

38:49.480 --> 38:50.480
It's there if you want.

38:50.480 --> 38:53.220
But if you never need it, you don't have to worry about it.

38:53.220 --> 38:55.960
They're dedicated to offering the best virtualized cloud computing.

38:55.960 --> 38:58.200
If it runs on Linux, it runs on Linode.

38:58.200 --> 39:01.480
You can start with something that's $5 a month and build it up from there.

39:01.480 --> 39:06.100
But with our $100 credit, try out a real serious rig.

39:06.100 --> 39:08.280
Build something powerful and fast and have some fun.

39:08.280 --> 39:10.920
Because it's delightful to use these systems.

39:10.920 --> 39:15.600
And then they have great ancillary services like object storage, which is S3 compatible.

39:15.600 --> 39:20.440
We have a system that is using their object storage for its video storage.

39:20.440 --> 39:24.060
When we upload a video, it's actually using object storage on the backend to store it.

39:24.060 --> 39:28.240
So our storage grows dynamically as we need it instead of carving off block storage.

39:28.240 --> 39:31.320
We just use object storage and it works great.

39:31.320 --> 39:35.560
There's tons of ways to use Linode from hosting a game server or a personal website to building

39:35.560 --> 39:39.400
the backend infrastructure for your community and your company.

39:39.400 --> 39:43.560
So go to linode.com slash coder, support this show and get that 100.

39:43.560 --> 39:45.040
Did you check that?

39:45.040 --> 39:46.040
Yeah?

39:46.040 --> 39:47.040
Crazy.

39:47.040 --> 39:48.040
Yeah.

39:48.040 --> 39:49.040
Yeah.

39:49.040 --> 39:50.040
We just checked it.

39:50.040 --> 39:51.040
linode.com slash coder.

39:51.040 --> 39:55.960
Get that $100 60 day credit towards your new account and support the show.

39:55.960 --> 40:04.600
And I realized I'm probably, I'm not going to be happy with an M1 MacBook Air or even

40:04.600 --> 40:12.540
an M1 MacBook 13, but the Mac mini, the Mac mini is right up my alley.

40:12.540 --> 40:15.840
And I was sitting there up in my office and I was like, I could make these three monitors

40:15.840 --> 40:19.720
work with a Mac mini M1 and I could really get an experience at least not for the battery

40:19.720 --> 40:23.400
life, which sounds incredible, but for the CPU speed.

40:23.400 --> 40:30.520
And I was debating what to do because I ordered a brand new Mac mini for Angela because her

40:30.520 --> 40:32.720
computer just died on her.

40:32.720 --> 40:33.720
Yeah.

40:33.720 --> 40:37.080
And her, her battery in her Mac book has blowed up.

40:37.080 --> 40:40.740
You know how the old, she has a really old Mac book, like maybe even before Thunderbolt

40:40.740 --> 40:41.740
was a thing.

40:41.740 --> 40:43.720
When they actually become improvised explosive devices.

40:43.720 --> 40:44.720
Yes.

40:44.720 --> 40:46.760
I'm familiar with that concept.

40:46.760 --> 40:52.360
And so we had this massive power outage last week and I guess probably cause the thing

40:52.360 --> 40:57.280
had to run on battery for the first time in forever or what, whatever it got real bad,

40:57.280 --> 41:02.420
real fast, but because the power was out, she couldn't order anything for herself because

41:02.420 --> 41:03.420
everything was down.

41:03.420 --> 41:07.480
And so she drove to like Arby's to send me a text message because even the cell towers

41:07.480 --> 41:08.480
were down.

41:08.480 --> 41:12.600
We had a really bad storm and she sends me a text message and she's like, can you order

41:12.600 --> 41:13.600
me an M1?

41:13.600 --> 41:14.600
I'll pay you back.

41:14.600 --> 41:15.600
Like what?

41:15.600 --> 41:19.880
She's like, yeah, well here's the situation.

41:19.880 --> 41:25.800
And so yeah, I went on there and I got a, I, you know, a maxed out M1 Mac book or I'm

41:25.800 --> 41:30.000
sorry, Mac mini is 16 terabytes of Ram and two terabytes of storage.

41:30.000 --> 41:34.480
But she has a billion pictures, so she had to go with the two terabytes of storage.

41:34.480 --> 41:35.480
She just has no choice.

41:35.480 --> 41:38.720
And you know, 16 gigs of Ram, what are you, what are you going to do eight?

41:38.720 --> 41:40.160
Well, come on.

41:40.160 --> 41:44.180
So yeah, I will get a little bit of a hands on time with it.

41:44.180 --> 41:45.180
That's the deal.

41:45.180 --> 41:48.780
That's the trade is for my time to set it up a little bit for her and do the ordering.

41:48.780 --> 41:52.620
I'll get a little hands on time with the Mac mini M1, play with it for a few days before

41:52.620 --> 41:57.760
I hand it off to her without having to buy one myself, you know?

41:57.760 --> 41:59.440
So it's kind of a good hack.

41:59.440 --> 42:02.700
It's not as nice as getting the experience, the laptop, but I think I'd have to have a

42:02.700 --> 42:07.040
laptop for days and days, maybe a week or two before I'd be like this battery life is

42:07.040 --> 42:08.040
changing my life anyways.

42:08.040 --> 42:09.040
Yeah.

42:09.040 --> 42:11.960
I mean, I'm going to tell you it's the laptop.

42:11.960 --> 42:16.520
I don't want to downplay cause it's actually very good, but it's so good that you keep

42:16.520 --> 42:20.280
forgetting how good it is until you're not using it in terms of the battery life.

42:20.280 --> 42:21.480
I mean, right.

42:21.480 --> 42:22.600
You just don't care anymore.

42:22.600 --> 42:24.480
I can't believe we're and people are rolling their eyes.

42:24.480 --> 42:25.600
I can't believe they're talking about this.

42:25.600 --> 42:26.720
I'll tell you what.

42:26.720 --> 42:27.920
I'll tell you what.

42:27.920 --> 42:31.960
This is the state of things right now because you can go by our email and just all of the

42:31.960 --> 42:32.960
stuff that's going on.

42:32.960 --> 42:34.680
This is what people are talking about.

42:34.680 --> 42:36.400
Mike and I were having a conversation before the show.

42:36.400 --> 42:39.640
We're like looking at the hoopla and we're like, well, we could talk some more about

42:39.640 --> 42:40.640
Parler.

42:40.640 --> 42:41.640
Yeah.

42:41.640 --> 42:42.640
I'd rather not.

42:42.640 --> 42:43.640
You know?

42:43.640 --> 42:48.040
So, and this is, this really, it seems to be the topic that has captured a lot of the

42:48.040 --> 42:49.960
people in the technical circles.

42:49.960 --> 42:50.960
I thought it was over.

42:50.960 --> 42:54.360
I thought the hype bubble had passed to be honest with you, but then people are now receiving

42:54.360 --> 42:56.960
their devices and our audience has been emailing in their experiences.

42:56.960 --> 42:58.360
I also, we got email.

42:58.360 --> 43:03.200
We got lots of emails from people on Intel systems and we had an email from an individual

43:03.200 --> 43:07.560
who's on an X1 carbon and a Gallego pro, which I thought that was fascinating.

43:07.560 --> 43:11.080
So I have an email back and forth with them asking them what it's like.

43:11.080 --> 43:15.400
So we got a lot of hardware in this week, but the M1 was the clear winner and I thought

43:15.400 --> 43:20.280
what a cool opportunity for me to get to play with it, set it up for Ange and then just

43:20.280 --> 43:21.280
pass it on.

43:21.280 --> 43:23.600
Cause it's never, it's not the right machine for me anyways.

43:23.600 --> 43:28.920
No, I mean, I will pour a little bit of a bucket of cold poop on these rumors though.

43:28.920 --> 43:37.000
I find it hard to believe that they're going to release a Apple Silicon IMAX and a smaller,

43:37.000 --> 43:43.840
presumably you know, more modest version of the Mac, I'm sorry, the Mac pro in the same

43:43.840 --> 43:47.840
year that just, and, and a new Apple display that just seems like a lot.

43:47.840 --> 43:51.880
Well, I think it's sort of like a rip the bandaid off kind of thing possibly.

43:51.880 --> 43:52.880
You think so?

43:52.880 --> 43:54.000
It's like we're going for it.

43:54.000 --> 43:58.160
Well, and also this transition has been in the works for a long time.

43:58.160 --> 44:02.240
So they may have had a, they may have already had a couple of year lead to build these systems,

44:02.240 --> 44:07.440
you know, maybe that's possible because they haven't been doing a lot with the IMAX.

44:07.440 --> 44:11.000
They've just kind of been revenue and revenue and they haven't really done anything.

44:11.000 --> 44:12.040
They haven't really changed the screen.

44:12.040 --> 44:15.040
They haven't changed the big old chin, nothing.

44:15.040 --> 44:18.440
And I've always thought they must be waiting until they make that arm transition and then

44:18.440 --> 44:19.440
they're just going to roll it out.

44:19.440 --> 44:21.920
And I wouldn't be surprised if that's exactly the case.

44:21.920 --> 44:27.360
Well, it's going to be terrible when like the base or two step up IMAX trounce the IMAX

44:27.360 --> 44:28.360
pros.

44:28.360 --> 44:30.720
I'm just, you know, maybe if it's a little personal for me, but.

44:30.720 --> 44:33.560
Well, I think that's what's selling them is the performance.

44:33.560 --> 44:39.600
And you do wonder if it's already kind of getting to the point where it's pretty competitive,

44:39.600 --> 44:42.240
what does it mean when it's even significantly more performant?

44:42.240 --> 44:47.240
I don't know what it is in me that worries a little bit that it's, it's going to create

44:47.240 --> 44:51.700
this exodus of the Intel market, which is just as absolutely ridiculous because I'm

44:51.700 --> 44:57.040
only talking about one category of user, but I think that's the concern in a sense is like

44:57.040 --> 45:01.320
if what if they have something here that's so significant that it kind of just makes

45:01.320 --> 45:03.640
everything else look too old and slow.

45:03.640 --> 45:05.920
Like I'm already feeling that a little bit.

45:05.920 --> 45:10.240
Like I look at that X1 carbon, which I just got, and I'm like, uh, maybe I should sell

45:10.240 --> 45:14.800
this thing because it doesn't really, I mean, it doesn't feel, it doesn't feel like it's

45:14.800 --> 45:18.840
new and, and, and like the most modern thing I could be using as fast as possible.

45:18.840 --> 45:20.440
And performance is a big deal for me.

45:20.440 --> 45:23.280
It's something that's like, that's a serious thing for me.

45:23.280 --> 45:27.440
It is, but I think there's a lot of the market who doesn't want to run Mac OS, right?

45:27.440 --> 45:29.920
There's a lot of marketers, frankly on windows, right?

45:29.920 --> 45:30.920
For various reasons.

45:30.920 --> 45:31.920
Yep.

45:31.920 --> 45:32.920
Absolutely.

45:32.920 --> 45:37.020
I mean, the next market shares obviously small, but I guess I don't see a lot of platform

45:37.020 --> 45:38.400
switchers because of this.

45:38.400 --> 45:39.400
Maybe I'm wrong.

45:39.400 --> 45:40.400
Right?

45:40.400 --> 45:42.040
Well, your point about Mac OS is kind of a good one.

45:42.040 --> 45:43.040
Yeah.

45:43.040 --> 45:45.720
Not to talk about Parler, but to talk about Parler just a little bit.

45:45.720 --> 45:47.960
It runs on excerpts cause that's all they could find.

45:47.960 --> 45:48.960
Sorry.

45:48.960 --> 45:50.200
That's all the rest has got.

45:50.200 --> 45:55.880
I watched all of that go down and I thought to myself, this is probably why ultimately

45:55.880 --> 46:00.560
it's better to build my own infrastructure where I can self-host my own software and

46:00.560 --> 46:06.060
my services when I can and use a platform that isn't tied to a single company, even

46:06.060 --> 46:08.620
for my computers as well.

46:08.620 --> 46:13.400
And I wonder if I will get to a point where it just simply doesn't matter how good of

46:13.400 --> 46:18.280
a system they make as long as it says fundamentally flawed that it's Apple that controls it.

46:18.280 --> 46:20.740
I'll never be fully comfortable with it.

46:20.740 --> 46:26.480
You know, no one tells me when or what updates I have to do with Linux.

46:26.480 --> 46:31.960
Nobody tells me what software I can or can't run with an x86 machine and Linux.

46:31.960 --> 46:36.820
And maybe that ultimately will end up being more important than having my applications

46:36.820 --> 46:38.320
load a little bit faster.

46:38.320 --> 46:43.740
I'm not sure because there's like ideals and then there's the actual like practical day

46:43.740 --> 46:48.720
to day getting your work done pragmatic stuff about it, you know, like, but I have been

46:48.720 --> 46:53.200
thinking more and more about how like that single source of control.

46:53.200 --> 46:54.200
And it's also it's like the same.

46:54.200 --> 46:55.480
It's the same issue with YouTube.

46:55.480 --> 46:58.240
All these platforms where these big companies are controlling them.

46:58.240 --> 47:01.840
It just takes them flipping a switch in San Francisco to shut your business down.

47:01.840 --> 47:08.360
Well, I mean, I would say the YouTube situation is far more severe.

47:08.360 --> 47:09.360
Okay.

47:09.360 --> 47:14.560
I don't think, you know, if I write an app for Android or an electron app for a client

47:14.560 --> 47:19.680
and Apple's annoyed, they're not going to, like, disable my MacBook Air remotely, right?

47:19.680 --> 47:20.680
Right.

47:20.680 --> 47:21.680
That's crazy.

47:21.680 --> 47:24.360
Worst case with Apple's, they're going to disable a developer account or something.

47:24.360 --> 47:25.360
Right.

47:25.360 --> 47:29.120
But even then, you know, I will I will we've bashed them a lot over the years.

47:29.120 --> 47:30.720
I will give them one thing.

47:30.720 --> 47:34.620
They have never messed with my developer account for the consulting business, even when they

47:34.620 --> 47:37.760
threw us off the iTunes charts.

47:37.760 --> 47:42.960
Even they only like had an accident where they somehow missed the review or something.

47:42.960 --> 47:43.960
Right.

47:43.960 --> 47:47.700
See, it's funny because you mentioned YouTube and like that just triggered me a little bit

47:47.700 --> 47:52.540
because like that is the kind of platform control that scares the crap out of me.

47:52.540 --> 47:59.160
But the content stuff, because I somehow have YouTube red or gold or.

47:59.160 --> 48:00.160
Yeah.

48:00.160 --> 48:01.160
YouTube premium.

48:01.160 --> 48:04.060
I had a Google Play music and I loved it and then they took it away from me.

48:04.060 --> 48:10.360
So they gave me something else, so I don't I don't know, but it's kind of like how I

48:10.360 --> 48:15.060
listen to all my music now, but they just kind of pick what I listen to.

48:15.060 --> 48:19.120
And then you fall asleep listening to YouTube videos like I listen to like every once in

48:19.120 --> 48:23.040
a while, listen to the Xamarin videos and I wake up and it's like some crazy right wing

48:23.040 --> 48:24.040
dude.

48:24.040 --> 48:26.080
Like, what the hell?

48:26.080 --> 48:29.640
You're always three videos away for some crazy rabbit hole conspiracy theory thing.

48:29.640 --> 48:34.400
It's usually like Jordan Peterson's the gateway drug and then you're just like, oh, yeah,

48:34.400 --> 48:38.240
yeah, you're always you fall asleep for a few hours and then all of a sudden your Facebook

48:38.240 --> 48:43.360
ads have dramatically changed three videos away from Jordan Peterson.

48:43.360 --> 48:47.880
Like, I don't know, man, I just wanted to learn how to use this new XAML component.

48:47.880 --> 48:51.640
So geez, there's a Python library I was curious about.

48:51.640 --> 48:55.840
I mean, my whole thing with the M1 is I love it, it's great.

48:55.840 --> 49:01.160
But if like System76 or Dell releases a Linux machine that can go toe to toe with this MacBook

49:01.160 --> 49:04.600
Air, then great.

49:04.600 --> 49:05.600
That's what I want.

49:05.600 --> 49:06.760
I think competition is good.

49:06.760 --> 49:11.580
I think, yes, I will say Apple's ahead, right?

49:11.580 --> 49:15.480
But isn't this an opportunity for the other vendors to kind of get their ass together?

49:15.480 --> 49:19.320
Well, I don't want to go all our mess on you here, but I don't think they're ever going

49:19.320 --> 49:21.680
to because I mean, look at look at this.

49:21.680 --> 49:22.680
Look at this.

49:22.680 --> 49:27.720
We're 30 plus years into Apple being a thing and they're still laughing, everybody.

49:27.720 --> 49:29.320
I mean, let's be honest about it.

49:29.320 --> 49:33.600
They really are the build quality, the performance, the integration with the OS.

49:33.600 --> 49:37.480
It's a dream for other vendors to have that kind of level of integration and control.

49:37.480 --> 49:41.280
And we're not just talking about like control, we're talking about like some of these vendors

49:41.280 --> 49:47.000
who are manufacturing things are on the line like their survival depends on Apple.

49:47.000 --> 49:52.660
Apple has ultimate control of the supply chain relationships of everything from the chip

49:52.660 --> 49:57.400
chips, from the glass that's on the screen to the bits, all of it.

49:57.400 --> 49:59.400
And nobody's matching that.

49:59.400 --> 50:01.960
I don't think people are going to catch up.

50:01.960 --> 50:04.360
I think there will be equivalences.

50:04.360 --> 50:07.480
There will be places where they maybe surpass them in some areas.

50:07.480 --> 50:12.760
But as a whole complete product and package, it just Android hasn't managed to do it yet

50:12.760 --> 50:13.960
for the iPhone.

50:13.960 --> 50:15.560
It just doesn't seem to be happening.

50:15.560 --> 50:16.560
Hang on.

50:16.560 --> 50:17.560
That's scrolling.

50:17.560 --> 50:21.240
Project Butter has been going on for seven years.

50:21.240 --> 50:22.240
It's great.

50:22.240 --> 50:23.720
That's a deep breath.

50:23.720 --> 50:26.000
That is only a long time.

50:26.000 --> 50:27.000
Listeners will get that.

50:27.000 --> 50:28.000
Yeah, man.

50:28.000 --> 50:29.740
And, you know, that just proves it doesn't.

50:29.740 --> 50:33.760
And so but this is where I kind of channel my inner beard from RMS.

50:33.760 --> 50:36.660
And I think to myself, what if that doesn't matter?

50:36.660 --> 50:41.920
What if what ultimately matters is the computer does what I tell it to do in every situation?

50:41.920 --> 50:42.920
But it doesn't.

50:42.920 --> 50:43.920
But it doesn't.

50:43.920 --> 50:45.400
You're always going to be running some proprietary hardware.

50:45.400 --> 50:48.440
We're always running some proprietary drivers.

50:48.440 --> 50:54.680
And frankly, even if they're not proprietary, there are 50 drunk Russians right now trying

50:54.680 --> 50:59.200
to screw with the Mesa drivers or any open source driver you care to name.

50:59.200 --> 51:00.200
Yeah.

51:00.200 --> 51:05.560
So what you're saying is give in to our new dictator and long live Apple.

51:05.560 --> 51:10.960
Now, what I'm saying is you have to adopt a level of cynicism that you have yet to attain.

51:10.960 --> 51:13.360
And which is weird because someone in the chat is mentioning unfilter.

51:13.360 --> 51:14.680
I listen to unfilter.

51:14.680 --> 51:15.680
You're a cynic.

51:15.680 --> 51:17.440
Yeah, I suppose sometimes I am.

51:17.440 --> 51:22.040
Well, you know, with unfilter, it's more like I just pop the popcorn and I just watch the

51:22.040 --> 51:23.040
crazy show.

51:23.040 --> 51:24.720
And that's what unfilter really is.

51:24.720 --> 51:28.960
But with this, it's like, I guess I look at this and I think this is my ultimate thing.

51:28.960 --> 51:34.720
But just what if someday somebody decides, you know, those hippies who propose the free

51:34.720 --> 51:37.160
software should take over the world, they're dangerous.

51:37.160 --> 51:39.840
And somebody says, we got to shut down that Linux Unplugged podcast.

51:39.840 --> 51:40.840
It's dangerous.

51:40.840 --> 51:45.320
I'm going to be really glad that I'm not like making my entire living off of YouTube or

51:45.320 --> 51:48.720
some other platform that could just turn off the, you know, the access like that.

51:48.720 --> 51:52.480
And I think watching these last few weeks, there's something there.

51:52.480 --> 51:56.980
I don't know what it is yet, but there's something brewing in the back of my mind where I'm like,

51:56.980 --> 51:58.560
something has shifted.

51:58.560 --> 52:00.720
The way I look at this has shifted.

52:00.720 --> 52:04.360
And I bet for a lot of other people, it's shifted as well.

52:04.360 --> 52:07.520
And I don't know if it's shifted for the better or not.

52:07.520 --> 52:08.520
Maybe.

52:08.520 --> 52:11.060
But I feel like something isn't the same anymore.

52:11.060 --> 52:16.840
Is it possible that you feel that these for profit corporations have way, way too much

52:16.840 --> 52:17.840
power?

52:17.840 --> 52:18.840
Yeah.

52:18.840 --> 52:20.100
I mean, that is definitely the case.

52:20.100 --> 52:21.100
That's totally true.

52:21.100 --> 52:22.100
Right.

52:22.100 --> 52:28.360
I mean, the fact that Apple could effectively put any podcast out of business tomorrow seems

52:28.360 --> 52:29.680
like a lot to me.

52:29.680 --> 52:30.680
Seems bad.

52:30.680 --> 52:31.680
Right.

52:31.680 --> 52:32.680
Yeah.

52:32.680 --> 52:35.320
Yeah, that does seem bad.

52:35.320 --> 52:36.320
Yeah.

52:36.320 --> 52:40.840
I guess Decentral, I've just, and it seems impossible because it really is just perhaps

52:40.840 --> 52:43.200
that we're too late stage in it, perhaps.

52:43.200 --> 52:46.800
And we're late stage, don't you think?

52:46.800 --> 52:48.820
We have our big companies.

52:48.820 --> 52:49.820
We have our app.

52:49.820 --> 52:51.120
Are you going to say rent seeking next?

52:51.120 --> 52:52.120
Because I...

52:52.120 --> 52:53.120
No.

52:53.120 --> 52:57.280
No, I just mean we're too late stage in development of this particular technological cycle.

52:57.280 --> 53:03.060
You have your big players, you have your platforms, you have your silos, and nothing stays the

53:03.060 --> 53:04.060
same forever.

53:04.060 --> 53:05.840
But it's going to be this way for a while.

53:05.840 --> 53:08.360
This is the new reality for quite a while.

53:08.360 --> 53:12.240
Yeah, I mean, I think the worst case scenario you could possibly think of is like maybe

53:12.240 --> 53:15.840
YouTube, but I'm thinking more of the app store.

53:15.840 --> 53:21.880
As a developer, I kind of hate the fact that Apple controls it with such like an iron grip.

53:21.880 --> 53:27.120
But as someone who does IT support for his family, that's why I make sure they get iPhones.

53:27.120 --> 53:28.120
Good point.

53:28.120 --> 53:29.120
Same.

53:29.120 --> 53:30.120
Yeah.

53:30.120 --> 53:31.120
That describes me to a T.

53:31.120 --> 53:32.480
So I don't know.

53:32.480 --> 53:35.760
So you're saying I want my cake and I want to eat it too is what you're saying.

53:35.760 --> 53:36.760
That's what you're saying?

53:36.760 --> 53:37.760
Who doesn't?

53:37.760 --> 53:39.680
I have some reasonable expectations.

53:39.680 --> 53:43.840
What I need to have are lowered expectations.

53:43.840 --> 53:47.680
Well, you do run Fedora.

53:47.680 --> 53:50.080
I like Fedora.

53:50.080 --> 53:52.160
I actually like Fedora quite a bit.

53:52.160 --> 53:54.400
I think it's a good little operating system.

53:54.400 --> 53:55.560
It's no Arch.

53:55.560 --> 53:56.560
It's no Arch.

53:56.560 --> 53:57.560
Oh, Jesus.

53:57.560 --> 53:58.560
All right.

53:58.560 --> 54:00.480
Let's wrap it up right there.

54:00.480 --> 54:02.120
I think that's probably it.

54:02.120 --> 54:05.160
You know we're out of material if we're talking about Arch.

54:05.160 --> 54:06.280
Go get Mike on Twitter.

54:06.280 --> 54:07.280
He's at Dumanuku.

54:07.280 --> 54:08.680
His company is at the Mad Botter Inc.

54:08.680 --> 54:10.600
Is there anything else you want to mention, Mr. Dumanuku?

54:10.600 --> 54:11.600
Yeah.

54:11.600 --> 54:12.600
Don't forget the Coder QA.

54:12.600 --> 54:13.600
Subscribe.

54:13.600 --> 54:15.640
I think it's $10 a month.

54:15.640 --> 54:16.640
Cheaper than that.

54:16.640 --> 54:17.640
It's even cheaper than that.

54:17.640 --> 54:18.640
Even cheaper.

54:18.640 --> 54:21.880
CoderQA.co and you get a limited ad feed as well.

54:21.880 --> 54:23.160
You get the Coderly report.

54:23.160 --> 54:24.160
That's out.

54:24.160 --> 54:25.160
It's awesome.

54:25.160 --> 54:27.080
So go get that.

54:27.080 --> 54:29.560
If you haven't got it, I don't know what your problem is.

54:29.560 --> 54:30.560
CoderQA.co.

54:30.560 --> 54:32.360
It's cheaper than Disney Plus.

54:32.360 --> 54:34.140
They spent all their money on M1 Macs.

54:34.140 --> 54:35.200
That's their problem.

54:35.200 --> 54:36.200
That's what it is.

54:36.200 --> 54:37.200
Yeah, that's what it is.

54:37.200 --> 54:38.200
Yeah.

54:38.200 --> 54:39.200
I'm at Chris Lass.

54:39.200 --> 54:41.200
The network is at Jupiter Signal on the Twitter.

54:41.200 --> 54:43.840
Twitter, which is a horrible platform you shouldn't use.

54:43.840 --> 54:47.440
And the show is at Coder Radio Show, but I wouldn't follow it because it's Twitter.

54:47.440 --> 54:52.400
Links to what we talked about today, they're at coder.show slash 397 and our contact form

54:52.400 --> 54:53.400
there is too.

54:53.400 --> 54:54.400
Thanks for joining us.

54:54.400 --> 54:55.400
Join us live next Monday.

54:55.400 --> 54:56.400
See you next week.

54:56.400 --> 55:07.400
Thanks for watching CoderQA.co.
