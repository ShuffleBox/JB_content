00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,800
This is KOTOR Radio, episode 455 for February 28, 2022.

2
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:20,080
Hello there and welcome back to Jupiter Broadcasting's weekly talk show, taking a pragmatic look

3
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:24,940
at the art and business of software development and the world of technology.

4
00:00:24,940 --> 00:00:28,980
My name is Chris and joining us every single month right there next to his microphone it's

5
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:30,520
our host, Mr. Dominic.

6
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:31,520
Hello Mike.

7
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:32,520
What's up?

8
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:34,000
Let's launch into KOTOR Radio.

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Woo!

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,420
Right, you and I are both here with our launch keyboards.

11
00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:38,420
That's right.

12
00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:41,920
I could hear you typing away to the chat room before we started.

13
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:45,600
They do make a certain racket, don't they?

14
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:46,600
I love it though.

15
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:49,960
I love me the clacky keyboards, tell you what.

16
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:53,720
Well, we got quite a bit of feedback.

17
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:57,200
We touch on these topics sometimes that seem to resonate with people.

18
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:02,160
Some of them make sense, like burnout, career decisions, and then every now and then we

19
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:09,800
talk about things like blue and green message bubbles or cold hands, and then we just get

20
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:10,800
all the feedback.

21
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:14,200
So I just thought I'd just super quickly get through some of that.

22
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:16,360
Staying warm at your desk, we got a few suggestions.

23
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:21,360
A few people recommended heat lamps, like the ones for food, but for your hands.

24
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:22,360
I love it.

25
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:23,360
Or heated gloves.

26
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:25,080
It seems smart.

27
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:28,480
The bearded tech said concerning cold hands, one thing that isn't talked about enough

28
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:31,840
is sometimes cold hands can be a symptom of carpal tunnel syndrome.

29
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:37,200
My fiance had surgery on both her hands and now she feels cold and hot, completely different

30
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,400
than before.

31
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:43,700
And then Tyler wrote in and mentioned that cold therapy also works, a little more difficult

32
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:45,920
than gloves though.

33
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:49,240
But the one that got the people stirred up last week was when you and I talked about

34
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:56,320
Windows 11 accounts requiring a transition with yet another tier of Windows, now with

35
00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:01,240
Windows Pro, requiring everyone sign up with an online Microsoft account.

36
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:04,640
Used to be just like home, but now they're expanding that and you and I had thoughts

37
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:05,640
on that.

38
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:12,740
Well, listener Mike R wrote in and he has written out a comprehensive workaround guide

39
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:18,360
on GitHub and I skimmed through it and it essentially involves tricking the installer

40
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:23,840
by not connecting to any networking, so don't join a Wi-Fi network, unplug it from Ethernet

41
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:27,320
and then when you get to a certain point in the installer, you can invoke a console and

42
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:32,400
then following his guide, in about five, 10 seconds bypass the whole online account required

43
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,400
thing.

44
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:36,680
Assuming Microsoft leaves that little workaround open, but he's got a great guide.

45
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:39,560
So there you go, problem solved, Mike.

46
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:40,560
I love it.

47
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:41,560
Yeah.

48
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:42,560
I'm sure you'll be doing this from now on.

49
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,560
I mean, you may have to.

50
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:45,040
I may have to actually.

51
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,800
I'll put a link in the show notes.

52
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:50,920
Apparently listener Mike knows how to write up a guide because he has put together a hell

53
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:53,280
of a guide for people getting the deck.

54
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:57,320
He himself is a game dev, he's heading down to the game developers conference and he wanted

55
00:02:57,320 --> 00:03:01,360
to put together a guide for other developers who might want to target the platform, so

56
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,300
we have that in the show notes too.

57
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:08,000
If you're just kind of interested in the Steam Deck though, it's worth checking out.

58
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,560
Like I said, Mike R knows how to write a guide.

59
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,840
I was to say, have you gotten your hands on a deck?

60
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:16,560
No, I guess I must have been like an hour late.

61
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:20,200
I ordered pretty soon after the news was live, but I was out and about.

62
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:23,520
So I think I'm going to probably be in the next batch or so, which I'm fine with.

63
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:26,040
Yeah, I'm in like batch 17, so I'm screwed.

64
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:28,060
I don't really, I'm not in a rush.

65
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:35,160
I figure, you know, if it's going to be out to developers now, then by the time I get

66
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:37,720
it, there'll probably be some bug fixes and stuff.

67
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:39,000
Things will have been polished.

68
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
True.

69
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,440
I'm pretty happy with the Oculus right now anyways, so I don't really need a new toy.

70
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:44,440
Oh, we'll get there.

71
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:45,440
Oh, we'll get there.

72
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:48,200
Speaking of clearing the deck, how about this?

73
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:49,760
Brace yourself.

74
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:51,000
Listener Egon wrote in.

75
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,600
Like Voldemort, he's back.

76
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:57,760
He's back and he said, recently you talked about listener Casey from Austria who has

77
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:58,760
an issue.

78
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:03,080
He says, I suggest that he teams up with me, a fellow Austrian freelancer that is specializing

79
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:07,560
in service and hosting solutions, and he thinks maybe doing some networking would be great.

80
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:11,840
So if listener Casey is interested in talking to listener Egon, email me, I'll make a little

81
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,300
magic happen.

82
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:17,880
This is a special occurrence, and this is why actually Egon's email made it on air.

83
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:21,840
You see, when Egon writes into the show, it's a special occasion.

84
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:30,280
Our first email from Egon came in Dakota radio on Wednesday, September 22nd, 2012.

85
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:31,280
Can you believe that?

86
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:32,280
It was glorious.

87
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:39,400
I mean, that's a while ago, September 26th, it was like our 12th episode or something

88
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:40,400
like that.

89
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:45,800
But my absolute favorite email from listener Egon so far, I mean, other than the times

90
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:52,720
we got in trouble, has to be when he wrote in on September 22nd, 2014, obviously responding

91
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:56,400
to something you said, although I've completely forgotten the context, and he writes, Dear

92
00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:00,320
Mike and Chris, Mike has falsely proclaimed the end of private nudes.

93
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:04,720
I have come to the rescue of that achievement of civilization for the 20th century.

94
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:08,000
This is how one can still accomplish private nudes.

95
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,880
Step one, buy a device that can take pictures but is not attached to a phone or any network.

96
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:15,220
We used to call these digital cameras.

97
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:18,460
Step two, take the nudes as you prefer them.

98
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:23,520
Step three, save the data on non cloud storage, maybe a USB thumb drive.

99
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:29,680
And step four, if you prefer to send the nudes to someone, put the storage card in an envelope.

100
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:32,960
Love the show, Egon.

101
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:37,360
That never made it on air, but that is some solid advice right there.

102
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:42,480
Still applicable, you know, from 2014, still works in 2022.

103
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:46,920
It does, depending on the level of malware the recipient's computer has on it that's

104
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:51,160
going to copy that drive and upload it to wherever.

105
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:55,840
But yes, coins to Egon, that is a lot of effort.

106
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:56,840
That's true.

107
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:57,840
Yeah.

108
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:00,280
You know, the problem is, is you don't know what they're going to do on the other end

109
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:03,520
that you're right, because it's more and more likely that they would just throw it into

110
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:06,480
some sort of photo program that auto clouds them.

111
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:10,740
Or like they'll open it and not realize they have like Dropbox running that just syncs

112
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:12,960
everything right or Google Drive or something crazy like that.

113
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:17,920
I just appreciate A, that Egon's been writing in for so long and B, that he clearly had

114
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:20,000
given thought to that process.

115
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,880
I don't know why I could make some assumptions.

116
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:25,440
And then C felt like he was comfortable enough sharing it with us.

117
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:29,800
And then it sits in our inbox since 2014.

118
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:30,800
For eight years.

119
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:31,800
Yes.

120
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:32,800
Isn't that amazing?

121
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:35,080
I mean, there's just something special about that.

122
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:37,920
That's the Coder Radio Miracle, so if you'd like to have your email sit in our inbox for

123
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:40,320
a while, we do eventually get to them.

124
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:42,160
Coder dot show slash contact.

125
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,920
We love getting your emails.

126
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:50,040
Also something I've been meaning to do more is people are sending us boostagrams.

127
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:52,720
And I know that you probably don't know what I'm talking about, do you?

128
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,100
No idea.

129
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:59,640
So there is a kind of a new generation of podcast apps, new podcast apps dot com.

130
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:04,380
There's a movement, I should back up, there is a movement out there to keep podcasting

131
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:08,840
decentralized and define a whole new set of features that's done in an open standard kind

132
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:09,840
of way.

133
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:16,140
And one of the great features of this new system is listeners while listening to a podcast

134
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:20,960
can send a boost, which is kind of like equivalent to a YouTube super chat, but there's no middleman.

135
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:24,860
There's no like PayPal that takes a cut or can stop a payment.

136
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:25,860
It's really great.

137
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:30,200
And people listening to this show while they're listening will say something and they'll send

138
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,200
us a boost.

139
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:38,280
Dave Jones sent us 500 sats and he said the only way to fully learn rust is a brainstem

140
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:41,520
tap that can just put the information directly into your brain.

141
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:44,800
He says that's the only way to learn all of rust and we must have said something about

142
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:47,680
rust and so Dave sent that into the show while we were talking about it.

143
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:51,160
I also happen to know that Dave works on a backend rust application.

144
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:52,960
I love it.

145
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:53,960
Yeah.

146
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:54,960
Yeah.

147
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:59,200
Also, he had to note that we talked about cumulative updates on last week's episode

148
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:02,800
and he said that they are the bane of a sysadmin's existence.

149
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:08,040
He writes, I prefer periodic monolithic updates that bring things current so there's a recent

150
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:09,040
baseline.

151
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,040
There you go.

152
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:11,040
So there you go.

153
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:13,960
So if you want to send us a boost, you can get a new podcast app and it's all in there

154
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:15,000
and send them into the show.

155
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
They come in live too.

156
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,420
That's the other cool thing is as people are listening to them, they come into the show.

157
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:26,780
So I have this front end that Dave Jones has written that sits and connects back to his

158
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:31,960
rust backend and it pulls in the boost as people send them so I can see when people

159
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:35,720
are listening because it includes the episode that they're listening to, their name if they

160
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:39,620
choose to include it and a brief message if they choose to include it and it comes in

161
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:42,120
right there on that dashboard in real time.

162
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:46,580
So it's pretty rad and we've talked a little bit more about it in Linux Unplugged if people

163
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:52,280
are totally lost but just go to newpodcastapps.com and figure it out.

164
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:57,840
Linode.com slash coder, go there to get $100 in 60 day credit on a new account and go there

165
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:01,600
to use the hosting and cloud provider that we use for everything we've built in the last

166
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:02,960
two and a half years.

167
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:07,440
And I just noticed some new rigs that we deployed recently have MVME storage.

168
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:13,520
This is brand new game changing PCI fast storage that Linode has been rolling out.

169
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:17,480
If you've got a project you want to test, something you want to learn or something you

170
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:22,260
want to put in production for a couple of people or millions of people, Linode has a

171
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:24,600
the right solution for you.

172
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:28,720
Their systems are screaming fast and they have 11 data centers around the world.

173
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:35,000
They are their own ISP and recently they're now with Akamai and taking things to the next

174
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
level.

175
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,560
And I think you're going to love the interface.

176
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:40,160
Nobody quite does it like Linode.

177
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:44,000
It seems like at some point all of the cloud providers decided to make these really kind

178
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:49,640
of esoteric unique dashboards that were part of their brand instead of just building something

179
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:54,480
that is clean, elegant and functional, which then would be a reflection of the brand, right?

180
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:57,040
Which is exactly they're at Linode with.

181
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:58,520
That's the kind of experience they have though.

182
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:00,120
They know how to do this kind of stuff.

183
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:04,360
Their command line client is extremely handy and their website, when you log in, it gives

184
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:09,240
you, you click on your Linode, it gives you the information you need right away to immediately

185
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:11,880
start assessing the state of your system.

186
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:16,000
Just brilliantly done, nice and simple.

187
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Gives you what you need.

188
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,080
You get in, you get action.

189
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:19,120
It's great.

190
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:22,160
Every time I spin up a Linode, I make sure I attach my SSH keys.

191
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:23,840
I make sure it's part of the backup program.

192
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:26,200
I can do all of that stuff in seconds.

193
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:28,320
It makes provisioning infrastructure for us.

194
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,260
Well, it's a foregone conclusion.

195
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:31,920
That's how we're going to provision it.

196
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:34,960
You know, it's just so great, so reliable.

197
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:37,040
I look at what's out there.

198
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:38,280
Nothing competes.

199
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:39,880
Go try it out and really see for yourself.

200
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:43,080
I mean, with a hundred dollars, you can really form a solid opinion.

201
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:46,440
I think that says something about Linode's confidence and how much you're going to like

202
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:47,440
it.

203
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:49,400
Go to linode.com slash coder.

204
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:54,440
Get that $100 in 60 day credit on a new account and you go there to support the show.

205
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:57,040
Linode.com slash coder.

206
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:01,920
Here's a bit of a spicy take for you.

207
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:06,500
Everybody should just shut up and accept the fact that Win32 is the actual stable Linux

208
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:10,320
user land ABI and deal with the consequences.

209
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,320
Wow.

210
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:12,320
Okay.

211
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:18,000
This is a post that was inspired by a developer after the Steam Deck came out.

212
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Okay.

213
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:24,600
Their argument is that Valve is pushing everyone to use Proton as a runtime.

214
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:28,880
Even games that have Linux compatibility, Valve has pushed them that direction.

215
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:33,680
And when you look at all of the distribution fragmentation, all of the toolkit fragmentation,

216
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:38,040
the kernel fragmentation, the fact that the LSB really doesn't solve the problem, free

217
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:43,520
desktop doesn't cover enough, you look at what it would take to ship a large scale commercial

218
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:45,680
application on Linux.

219
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:49,400
And their argument is just release your Windows app on Proton.

220
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:52,680
So like any sentence that begins with just do whatever, right, is-

221
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:53,680
Come on, man.

222
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:54,680
Just do it.

223
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:55,680
Yeah.

224
00:11:55,680 --> 00:12:02,840
I will definitely say if you had just said games, I might be more like, yeah, of course,

225
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:05,440
because I play lots of Windows games on Linux.

226
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:11,960
I recently acquired Rogue Legacy 2, great sequel to the already great Rogue Legacy,

227
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:17,480
and it is a Windows game, not even Mac support, and I play it on my POP machine.

228
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:18,480
It's great.

229
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:20,440
Via Proton, obviously.

230
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:22,560
So that's cool, right?

231
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:23,560
That's good.

232
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:27,120
See, the problem with desktops is you're going to have to have controls and they're probably

233
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:32,480
going to look like crap on the system in terms of desktop apps, right?

234
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:35,220
Not just games, desktop programs.

235
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:39,720
And while I'm sure it's possible to run your line of business application on this, I feel

236
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:48,440
like the answer for this in most line of business senses exists, and that answer is called Electron.

237
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:50,200
And it's fine.

238
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:56,360
I mean, we're doing this whole podcast on a web-based application, which could easily

239
00:12:56,360 --> 00:13:01,900
be wrapped in an Electron wrapper and distributed as a dock icon app.

240
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:11,080
So I don't know that it would make a lot of sense for anybody to take any non-game application,

241
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:13,600
specifically target Linux via Proton with it.

242
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:15,680
That just seems kind of weird to me.

243
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:17,640
I'll take the other side of this one then.

244
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:21,360
I mean, as a Linux user, I kind of would hate to see this.

245
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:26,200
I prefer desktop apps that look like they belong on my desktop.

246
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:32,400
However, I also have to acknowledge that 20 years into this thing, Linux has failed as

247
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:38,180
a quote-unquote collective to deliver essentially a stable desktop ABI that developers could

248
00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:45,780
be targeting in terms of toolkit and language and APIs and all of it.

249
00:13:45,780 --> 00:13:48,120
Not just the kernel ABI, but all of it.

250
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:51,080
It just really hasn't materialized yet, despite some of the better efforts out there that

251
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,320
come and go.

252
00:13:52,320 --> 00:14:00,940
And when I look at something like, say, Adobe After Effects, Adobe Premiere and Photoshop,

253
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:05,840
or something of that complicated nature, I could see where it makes a lot of sense.

254
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:07,760
I agree with your take.

255
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:11,480
If it's a new app that's being created, if it's something that already exists as a web

256
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:14,780
app, it just doesn't make sense to ship the Windows version when you could just ship the

257
00:14:14,780 --> 00:14:16,160
Electron version.

258
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:20,500
But if it's something that's pre-existing, a large enterprise application or something

259
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:24,760
like one of the Adobe Suite applications, I kind of think it makes a lot of sense because

260
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:28,720
Valve is very dedicated to keeping that thing alive.

261
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:30,160
They've hired developers.

262
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:33,480
Is Valve going to chase incompatibilities with updates to Photoshop?

263
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:35,680
No, but that's the beautiful thing.

264
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:37,000
You just do what Valve did.

265
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
You hire a developer.

266
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:42,920
I mean, Valve hired a handful of really skilled developers to turn this thing into something

267
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:44,640
they can ship a product on.

268
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:45,740
Adobe could do the same.

269
00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:49,980
It's all open source, and they would build on top of what Valve has graded for them.

270
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:51,020
Adobe's not going to do that.

271
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:53,360
You see where their investment already is.

272
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:54,360
It's in web apps, right?

273
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:57,280
Yeah, there's just no reason for them to do it, right?

274
00:14:57,280 --> 00:15:01,280
The only reason they would do it is if they had enough Creative Cloud users who were demanding

275
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:04,440
it, but they don't even have a Creative Cloud client for Linux as far as I know.

276
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:09,560
And even then, they just hire a few more TypeScript developers and go to town in the web version.

277
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:10,560
Maybe.

278
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:11,560
Maybe.

279
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:13,680
I mean, there's no good business case for this because if you have a legacy Windows

280
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:20,480
application, unless it's a real easy, you know, pop it over to Proton and it's fine,

281
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:24,120
it's probably not going to be something you're really invested in doing.

282
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:27,860
And the other side of that is, okay, then once you release it, you have to support it.

283
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:32,960
And shops that have Win32 apps, first of all, the world of Win32 apps, we're talking a lot

284
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:36,840
of Battleship Gray line of business applications here.

285
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:39,840
These folks are not like moving to Linux.

286
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:44,080
And frankly, if they are, they just bought like VMware Workstation and run them on there,

287
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:47,280
just like their users who use Mac run parallels or something.

288
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:52,760
This is like a problem that's on the legacy and being solved by VMs or people just simply

289
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:54,400
running Windows.

290
00:15:54,400 --> 00:16:03,200
And in the future, I mean, Electron, man, it's such a small percentage of non-game users

291
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:07,360
that are needing Linux applications, especially if we're talking about stuff that's still

292
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:08,360
Win32.

293
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:16,760
You're automatically talking basically older, more mature applications in a business environment.

294
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:19,040
So I don't know.

295
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:20,040
Is that possible?

296
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:21,040
Sure.

297
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:22,040
Right.

298
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:28,120
It makes sense if there was a user demand, and I think that's the core of your argument

299
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:32,280
is there's really no, there's no business case, there's no user demand for this.

300
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:35,120
And for new applications being developed, you just wouldn't go this route where you're

301
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:39,160
going to create a user base or you maybe have a service, a web based service or software

302
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:40,160
as a service.

303
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:41,160
It just does.

304
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:42,160
This doesn't make sense.

305
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:47,840
While I could see maybe a handful of applications over the next 10 years take advantage of this

306
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:53,720
really great wine stack that has been created here and the wine project is better, is healthier

307
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:55,080
and better than ever.

308
00:16:55,080 --> 00:17:00,160
I could see some people doing that, but not at scale, not, not, not like Adobe, not anything

309
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:01,520
massive like that.

310
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:07,000
I think it is just a little bodacious, maybe windbaggy to come out and say, ah, just forget

311
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:11,760
everything else and just go with the windows ABI and then use it on top of Linux.

312
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:15,880
Because the reality is that over time, the Linux desktop is getting more and more attractive.

313
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:19,240
I know this is an old tune, but you know what?

314
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:24,000
I look at what the GNOME desktop guys are doing and cows and I look at GTK four and,

315
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:29,120
and, and the stack that they're creating there and it's starting to make a lot of sense to

316
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:30,120
me.

317
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:31,120
I can see what they're trying to build.

318
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:32,120
Yeah, for sure.

319
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:34,480
I mean, there are different customers for different things, right?

320
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:36,480
And that's ultimately what it's going to come down to.

321
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:41,040
Like your, your line of business, you know, small to mid tier company that's just doing

322
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:45,600
LOB apps is probably almost all doing web apps now if they're doing new development.

323
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:46,600
Yeah.

324
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:49,480
Unless there's like some weird case where they're like tablet kiosks and there are like

325
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:52,680
cases where it doesn't make sense or they have to integrate with some like machine or

326
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:54,280
piece of hardware.

327
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:58,880
But certainly using some of the new sexy stuff, particularly in KDE or some of the new GNOME

328
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:03,920
stuff, you could have, I could see like someone trying to become the rogue Amoeba or panic

329
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:05,720
of the Linux world.

330
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:08,960
It's just, that's a tough road to hoe, but it's also tough on Mac these days anyway.

331
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:09,960
So I don't know.

332
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:10,960
Yeah.

333
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:11,960
Yeah.

334
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:12,960
I suppose so.

335
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:17,680
This is my life as a Linux user is things get pretty good and then I make some move

336
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:20,480
where I'm out on the fringe all over again.

337
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:24,480
And I can definitely feel that happening with ARM and Linux.

338
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:27,000
I have a lot more ARM Linux systems now.

339
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:36,640
I have way too many raspberry pies and on my M1 MacBook Max, I have two or three VMs,

340
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:45,120
really two VMs that I use on the regular that are Linux, that are ARM Linux and that I love.

341
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:50,720
It's exceptionally good, but it has even less application compatibility.

342
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:58,380
And it is, I mean, I think there are actually ways to run 64 bit wine apps on ARM Linux,

343
00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:01,120
but it's a hell of a journey and it's brutally slow.

344
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:07,720
And it's funny just because I see today that a ThinkPad X13 was announced with a snap dragon

345
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:10,800
CPU in it and 165 Hertz screen.

346
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:17,320
And they're saying 25 hour battery life, they're saying 60% better performance to energy efficiency

347
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:20,040
when compiling software than on X86, right?

348
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:27,200
They're like making some really attractive claims, 2.3 pounds, kind of a new look too.

349
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:32,440
They say battery life so long you can leave the charger at home, but the software experience

350
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:34,840
is just not going to be great.

351
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,760
It's not going to be good.

352
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:43,380
And I mean, what do you figure, Mike, at best, this thing, which doesn't even ship till May,

353
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:47,920
is probably going to clock somewhere between the MacBook Air M1 that shipped last year

354
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:50,120
and the new MacBooks, right?

355
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:54,760
It's going to be, it's not even going to be like, it may not even be as fast as an M1

356
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:56,480
released a year ago.

357
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:59,920
And I think there are going to be so many caveats and edge cases where things you actually

358
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:03,720
want to do as a Windows user are going to be a challenge.

359
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:05,400
It's a whole different ecosystem, right?

360
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:09,980
Microsoft has so many different ways to develop applications for their stuff that I'm not

361
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:12,600
totally convinced that they could pull off a Rosetta 2.

362
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:15,100
And I don't think they're saying they can.

363
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:18,260
There is 64-bit compatibility, but it's just nowhere as fast.

364
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:23,080
How do you define performance on a fair benchmark where it's a native binary for the platform?

365
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:24,080
Who cares?

366
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:27,160
Because even on the Mac side of things, almost nobody is running ARM applications.

367
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:29,760
Well, you really can't tell for the most case.

368
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:33,640
Yeah, you can't tell until you lean your arm on the arrow key.

369
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:34,640
It makes arrow noises.

370
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:35,640
Yeah, we'll see.

371
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:39,920
I mean, and for me, I actually think the situation is better on the Linux desktop than it is

372
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:42,840
on Windows, although I do not have a lot of comparison experience.

373
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:44,120
So that's a full acknowledgement.

374
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:50,640
But I am very impressed with there are multiple distros now where I can just download an ISO

375
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:52,640
image like you would for any PC.

376
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:55,280
And it's just the ARM ISO image.

377
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:57,640
You install it, you really have no idea you're on ARM.

378
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:59,560
There's lots of applications in the repo.

379
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:02,800
Anything that's really free software and open source is available to install.

380
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:07,440
It's you get to the proprietary apps, those places where maybe they offer an RPM or a

381
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:10,880
deb for download, you know, for their weird app.

382
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:13,960
None of them, for the most part, have ARM builds.

383
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:14,960
So that gets pretty bad.

384
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:15,960
Pretty sketch quick.

385
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:18,760
It's going to be a hard row the toe.

386
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:19,760
Is that it?

387
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:20,760
It's hard total.

388
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:22,120
Is it a is a rowing that's happening?

389
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:23,120
That's hard.

390
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:24,600
I never actually understood that analogy.

391
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:30,000
Probably should have gone with something else.

392
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,040
Datadog.com slash coder radio.

393
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:33,040
Yeah, that's right.

394
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:38,240
Datadog.com slash coder radio is where you go to get a free trial for two weeks and a

395
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:39,560
data dog t shirt.

396
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:45,320
Now, Datadog is a software as a service monitoring and security platform that enables full stack

397
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:50,740
observability for developers, IT ops, security professionals, business teams, really anyone

398
00:21:50,740 --> 00:21:52,960
that's working in the cloud age now.

399
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:57,800
Now along with Datadog's five hundred plus vendor backed integrations, you can correlate

400
00:21:57,800 --> 00:22:03,500
your metrics, your application logs, traces, security signals, anything from your infrastructure,

401
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:08,360
your third party services, and you bring it all into a single pane of beautiful glass.

402
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:10,840
And what I'm talking about is the dashboard.

403
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:12,080
It's great.

404
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:16,280
And these capabilities combined with their drag and drop dashboard, it's like next level

405
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:17,280
stuff.

406
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:21,640
And Datadog also on top of that offers machine learning based alerts to help teams troubleshoot

407
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:23,520
and collaborate more effectively.

408
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:25,160
Well, that's going to prevent downtime.

409
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:29,520
It's going to enhance performance, reliability and communication.

410
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:30,760
This is serious stuff.

411
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:31,920
It's really going to make an impact.

412
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:34,760
So we've got an exclusive offer for Coder Radio listeners.

slash Coder Radio.

417
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:53,960
I don't think we got to talk about this a lot because I can tell what you want to talk

418
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:55,000
about is your Oculus.

419
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,000
I can tell.

420
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
I know.

421
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,000
Feel it.

422
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,000
Yeah, I can feel it.

423
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:02,280
But, you know, when you and I get something right, every noun that I'm compelled to just

424
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:08,000
point it out a little bit because I think we nailed that, that whole Activision, Blizzard,

425
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,600
Microsoft acquisition, the whole Vulture circling situation.

426
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:18,120
So it looks like that, in my opinion, controversial CEO Bobby Cocktick or whatever his name was,

427
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:19,120
Cocktick.

428
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:20,120
I think it's Codick.

429
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:21,120
OK, sure.

430
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:26,480
He is going to get a nice big fat 15 million dollar golden parachute payout.

431
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:32,400
It looks like he just had like had some benchmarks to achieve for like improving culture.

432
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:35,400
And this is all coming from some SEC filings from Microsoft.

433
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:39,800
It reveals in there that they figured out, you know, if he reaches these benchmarks,

434
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:43,120
the Activision board agrees, he gets more of a payout.

435
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:45,240
In fact, it's not just him.

436
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:52,800
All the top execs are getting a larger payout as a result of the cleaning up of the culture.

437
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:55,720
OK, short translation.

438
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:57,220
This is a payout.

439
00:23:57,220 --> 00:24:02,840
So the CEO and the other top execs didn't dig their hooves in to stop the acquisition.

440
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:05,760
They had to put that there was some metric to make it, you know, kosher.

441
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:10,440
But that's, yeah, Bobby, Bobby Codick wasn't leaving without a golden parachute.

442
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:15,320
And, you know, it's, you know, the Wall Street Journal story came out three days later.

443
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:17,280
Phil Spencer's like, hey, man, what's up?

444
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:19,320
It's so obvious what happened here.

445
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:24,160
It's almost like, yeah, you want the guy to give up his company that he wants a significant

446
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:30,040
stake in and, you know, if he really throws a fit, he could probably not be forced out

447
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:31,480
or at least maybe legally he could.

448
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:37,200
But, you know, these these boards of directors and CEOs are always usually fairly friendly.

449
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:40,780
So I don't know, unless you can get like a Bill Atkins in there to cause trouble.

450
00:24:40,780 --> 00:24:44,560
But even then, he'd be one board member and he'd have to like do a Bill Atkins, a hedge

451
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:48,000
fund guy who likes to go on crusades.

452
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:52,640
But sometimes he does, sometimes he's the guy who tried to put a Herbalife out of business.

453
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:55,480
But this is like, I don't know, this dude was always going to get a lot of money from

454
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:59,320
Microsoft and Microsoft is still going to make a ton of money just by buying them.

455
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:01,760
So everybody wins except for the employees.

456
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:03,320
I got numbers on that here in a second.

457
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:05,280
But I also thought this was interesting.

458
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:10,680
The chief creative officer of King that they brought over when Activision Blizzard acquired

459
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:15,640
Candy Crush, he's quietly leaving along with the president they brought over.

460
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:19,040
Their reasons, both of them, they gave for their departure is to spend more time with

461
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:20,040
family.

462
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:24,160
Oh, yes, because all the people who make it to that level in their career want to spend

463
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:25,160
more time with their family.

464
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:26,160
Gotcha.

465
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:28,600
There's also an interesting little thing in this SEC filing.

466
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:31,300
No more details other than this.

467
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:40,800
An unnamed individual made a big play to acquire Blizzard and the board gave it some thought,

468
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:45,600
but they slow walked the whole process hoping Microsoft would finish up because their quote

469
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:52,760
prior dealings and quote with that individual raised concerns about them leaking.

470
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:57,000
No idea who this could be, but it sounds like there was somebody else bidding at the same

471
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,720
time, but they they didn't trust them.

472
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:05,040
So they they intentionally quote slow walked the process to give Microsoft time to get

473
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:06,520
their bureaucratic act together.

474
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:07,520
Yeah.

475
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:12,280
And also, this is a pretty sweet deal for for the shareholders of Activision, granted

476
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:16,080
what was very likely to be a huge problem for them, right?

477
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:20,480
And you know, it's funny, like a Kotaku, like those kind of gaming sites are still covering

478
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:23,040
some of the crap that went on over there.

479
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:30,040
But I feel like the glow of the wonderfulness that is Satya Nadella and just like the Microsoft's

480
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:35,120
like very good reputation on all this culture stuff has it's kind of worked.

481
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:38,400
Don't you don't you feel that it's kind of like washed a lot of sins away, at least in

482
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:41,200
terms of like they're not getting attacked.

483
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:45,840
Like I think if they didn't get bought by Microsoft, they would still be getting savaged

484
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:46,840
in the press.

485
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:51,980
Yeah, I think the two CEO transition from Gates to Balmer to Satya has helped with some

486
00:26:51,980 --> 00:26:52,980
of that, too.

487
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:53,980
Right.

488
00:26:53,980 --> 00:26:54,980
And right.

489
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:57,560
And to be clear, they deserve all the crap they were getting for sure.

490
00:26:57,560 --> 00:27:01,240
There's no there's no like this isn't, you know, Mike being anti woke.

491
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:02,240
This is.

492
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:06,560
In fact, it's a little sick that this dude is getting so much money, but there was no

493
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:08,120
way you had to pay him off.

494
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:11,160
There was no way that all these they would pay them just to keep them quiet.

495
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:13,640
Quiet and just help smooth this thing over.

496
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:17,280
OK, so the transition they can leave in six months and still get their money.

497
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:21,880
That never happens that short.

498
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:26,300
Talk to the poor Instagram guys who suffered at Facebook for, you know, it's as far as

499
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:27,300
I know.

500
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:30,320
I have very limited experience, but as far as I know, based on what I've been told by

501
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:33,480
lawyers and from what we've just observed, it's usually two years.

502
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:34,480
It can be a year.

503
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:40,880
Sometimes it's usually at least a full year from the completion of the acquisition.

504
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:46,440
But if the let's say if you if you're the acquirer and you think the personality perhaps

505
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:51,200
or the behavior of the founders was and Bobby Kodak's kind of a founder because he like

506
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:55,840
bought it out of bankruptcy is the problem, then you might, you know, I don't know.

507
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:59,280
I feel like this was the worst kept secret in the whole industry.

508
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:00,280
Isn't it funny?

509
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:04,600
OK, so according to the same filing with the SEC, long term revenue estimates prepared

510
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:11,460
in November indicate that Activision Blizzard expects a dramatic nearly two point five billion

511
00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:15,320
dollar revenue increase in 2013.

512
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:16,880
So Microsoft bought at the right time.

513
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:23,440
Yeah, well, Diablo four overwatch two and there is an unnamed Warcraft property, isn't

514
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:24,440
there?

515
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:25,440
Oh, of course.

516
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:26,440
Yeah.

517
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:28,680
So this is a very savvy move by Microsoft.

518
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:32,720
I stand by my original assessment that this is really going to create the Disney of video

519
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:33,720
games because they're not done.

520
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:35,800
They're not going to just stop.

521
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:39,920
They're not just like, OK, we got enough games now.

522
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:45,080
I sort of feel like like as people are like drooling over like the 15 million that Kodak's

523
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:46,080
getting ice.

524
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:49,760
I kind of think Microsoft got a really sweet deal here.

525
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:51,080
Long term, no doubt about it.

526
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:52,480
No doubt about it.

527
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:53,880
It's not just owning the properties.

528
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:56,720
It's been able to license the streaming and all of that.

529
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:57,720
This is going to pay.

530
00:28:57,720 --> 00:29:03,280
It's funny because now, you know, I have a PS5 and I have an Xbox S. That's the little

531
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:04,280
one.

532
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:05,280
I think it's.

533
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:06,280
Yeah.

534
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:07,280
You know, the graphical difference is pretty significant.

535
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:10,120
It's not huge, but like I'm certain games can definitely tell.

536
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:16,400
And I'm like, well, although with the Xbox as I don't really buy games anymore because

537
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:22,760
I have a game pass and I will just wait until the game inevitably becomes a Microsoft property.

538
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:27,700
I mean, yeah, it's like with Google, you wait till they kill a product with Microsoft.

539
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:29,160
You just wait till they buy that product.

540
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:32,280
Oh, is it time to mention Google Google Wave again?

541
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:33,280
There it is.

542
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:34,840
There it is.

543
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:36,000
Nicely done.

544
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:42,400
I am not as inclined anymore to want to play like on my switch because I had a really good

545
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:44,640
gaming experience with the Oculus Quest.

546
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:46,040
I'd never really gotten to the gaming.

547
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:50,080
I was working on like the whole like virtual office angle.

548
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:53,640
And then you're like, you got to go get this Vader game after you got your quest.

549
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:55,200
It kicked my ass.

550
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:56,200
Yeah.

551
00:29:56,200 --> 00:30:01,120
I got to tell you, man, it's a totally different experience playing a first person shooter

552
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:03,520
like that in VR.

553
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:08,560
When Vader walked up to me for the first time, I legit felt like a little bit of intimidation.

554
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:09,900
Like this guy's big.

555
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:11,220
He's standing over me.

556
00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:13,200
His whole suit was very intimidating.

557
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:14,200
He's not playing.

558
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:15,260
He's not screwing around here.

559
00:30:15,260 --> 00:30:17,420
He's not playing at all.

560
00:30:17,420 --> 00:30:19,120
And I've never had that experience.

561
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:23,600
Also putting my ship into hyperdrive and then walking into the back to like configure some

562
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:25,480
of the ship's systems.

563
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:26,480
That's just a lot of fun.

564
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:27,480
All right.

565
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:28,480
Ready?

566
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:29,480
Knights of the Old Republic, Oculus Edition.

567
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:30,480
Okay.

568
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:31,480
That's a good version.

569
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:32,480
Can you imagine it?

570
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:34,400
I think it's better than you expected, huh?

571
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:35,400
I'm blown away.

572
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:36,400
I love it.

573
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:37,400
Really?

574
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:40,720
And it's funny because every member of my house except for the five year old because

575
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:43,100
five has tried it.

576
00:30:43,100 --> 00:30:44,880
And we've all latched on to other things.

577
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:50,360
For instance, I've been getting my ass handed to me by BDSM Anakin Skywalker.

578
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:54,520
And the teenager discovered Beat Saber.

579
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:56,600
And my house has been full of Lady Gaga.

580
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:57,600
Yeah.

581
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:58,600
Yep.

582
00:30:58,600 --> 00:30:59,600
Supernatural.

583
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:00,600
Do you have a fitness one?

584
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:01,600
Oh, yeah, I think so.

585
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:02,600
Yeah.

586
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:03,600
There's a couple of workout ones I want to try.

587
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:04,600
Yeah.

588
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:05,600
The missus to be has been playing that.

589
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:07,080
And I just started building my office.

590
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:08,080
Okay.

591
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:09,080
Tell me.

592
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:10,800
I'm trying to go for as goth as possible.

593
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:14,400
But like but like not goth as in like black nail polish.

594
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:15,400
Okay.

595
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:20,800
Actual old school gothic like I want my screen and then, you know, just to look like I'm

596
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:21,800
in an old castle.

597
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:22,800
Cool.

598
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:25,600
Like like Batman, the movie from like 89 or whatever.

599
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:26,600
Yeah.

600
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:27,600
I want the Michael Keaton Batman.

601
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:28,720
Yeah, that's perfect.

602
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:29,720
That's a cool aesthetic.

603
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:30,720
Huh?

604
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:35,920
You know, okay, this this, I have to say is a little bit of like, we have to eat some

605
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:41,080
humble pie on this because I on all of this initially, because it just seemed like, I

606
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:47,080
think I went it's attached to Facebook, therefore, I will never take it seriously.

607
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:48,080
Right.

608
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:50,560
And I just kind of collapsed it down to that single variable.

609
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:53,800
Did you struggle with the whole meta thing connection to Facebook?

610
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:56,640
I didn't like that you have to log in your Facebook account.

611
00:31:56,640 --> 00:32:00,620
That feels creepy in ways that I'm not sure that I completely understand yet.

612
00:32:00,620 --> 00:32:04,320
But then I immediately handed Facebook like $150 in apps I bought.

613
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:05,320
Yeah, I know.

614
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:07,120
Yeah, you get used to it pretty quick.

615
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:09,580
You don't have it's not like you interface with it a lot.

616
00:32:09,580 --> 00:32:11,400
It's not like in your face about it.

617
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:15,320
I also, I can't believe I'm gonna say this.

618
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:20,680
And it was actually my wife who pointed it out to me, ironically, she's like, you know,

619
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:22,080
where an NFT would make sense.

620
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:25,480
Like, if you have that virtual office and you start decorating, it wouldn't be nice

621
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:28,280
if you could take that stuff to a different environment.

622
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:33,240
And she's like, I because she was looking at it from like having a meditation zone.

623
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:37,080
She's like, I would like to be able to decorate it with art.

624
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:38,560
Okay, I got the Oculus.

625
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:42,040
I'm also reading a book called the reality plus, which everybody who is going to show

626
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:47,960
that reads should read because I think my whole mind has just changed on this VR thing.

627
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:48,960
Oh, really?

628
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:53,920
Yeah, I think between this academic writing this book, me reading it and experiencing

629
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:55,440
it for myself.

630
00:32:55,440 --> 00:33:01,440
You know, I have done more exercise by getting the kicked out of me by Anakin, true.

631
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:04,720
And trying that supernatural boxing thing.

632
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:08,680
Then I think I've like ever done since I was a kid doing martial arts.

633
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:12,680
Yeah, I worked up a sweat doing the practice lightsaber thing where you fight those little

634
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:15,200
bots from the Star Wars movie that those cheap bastards.

635
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:16,760
Yeah, they're all over the place.

636
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:18,240
We're like, we're fast.

637
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:21,040
Yeah, yeah, I worked up a sweat.

638
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:24,520
They got to set your your guard area or whatever they call it.

639
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:25,520
Yeah, yeah.

640
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:29,920
The Guardian Zone or whatever, because sometimes you might hit a wall and that can be painful.

641
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:30,920
It's a compelling idea.

642
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:34,960
And you know, recently, a crowd funder launched called the Simula VR.

643
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:40,920
This is a Linux box, a like 11th Gen Intel x86 Linux box in the headset.

644
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:46,360
And they're writing a Wayland based desktop environment where you can bring up all the

645
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:47,360
screens.

646
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:52,640
And their primary focus is really crisp, high resolution text, because I think that is an

647
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:59,040
area where the Oculus Quest two right now suffers is I have to make my screens really

648
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:02,560
big because the text is fuzzy.

649
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:05,640
So I compensate by having huge screens, I happen to love huge screens.

650
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:07,440
So it's not a huge compromise.

651
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:09,720
And you can have unlimited huge screens.

652
00:34:09,720 --> 00:34:14,520
But I could really see the advantage of the entire computer being in that headset.

653
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:17,840
Because then you just wherever you're at, you pop that thing on and you have your entire

654
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:19,540
private workspace.

655
00:34:19,540 --> 00:34:21,340
And no one can see your screen.

656
00:34:21,340 --> 00:34:24,160
It really is confidential.

657
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:32,000
And you have state, right, because that virtual state remains all your screens, all your windows,

658
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:36,700
where you had all your notes, your chat windows, everything laid out exactly the same wherever

659
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:38,880
you're at anywhere in the world.

660
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:39,900
That's pretty powerful.

661
00:34:39,900 --> 00:34:42,000
So should we even talk about the developer story?

662
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,440
Because I've been definitely looking at it.

663
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:47,000
Yeah, you know, we got an email in from a listener.

664
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,240
I think he was asking kind of the same thing.

665
00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:54,460
A listener Casey says, thanks for answering my question about maintenance contracts recently.

666
00:34:54,460 --> 00:34:59,360
I have a question about what your thoughts are on the coding possibilities in VR.

667
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:03,680
I picked up the Valve Index over Christmas, and I'm really enjoying VR games.

668
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:06,360
But I haven't tried virtual workspaces yet.

669
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:09,680
I find the text a bit blurry and difficult to read in VR.

670
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:14,320
But I find the advantages of having huge and multiple monitors very intriguing.

671
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:18,980
Did you see yourself coding or working in a terminal in VR?

672
00:35:18,980 --> 00:35:24,420
So yes, which I'm very shocked that it's actually what I think.

673
00:35:24,420 --> 00:35:28,180
But I feel like this is my concern.

674
00:35:28,180 --> 00:35:30,920
You know how it's like some old ladies make those fairy gardens?

675
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:34,280
Yes, I used to live next to one.

676
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:35,280
Well, so do I.

677
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:36,980
That's what the ladies and they're beautiful.

678
00:35:36,980 --> 00:35:40,400
The problem is every time it like rains, she has to redo it.

679
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:42,320
But because she keeps it outside.

680
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:48,320
I worry that like the level of effort in making the perfect, like I'm bad enough with my desk,

681
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:49,320
right?

682
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:53,300
I tweet photos of when I changed the most minuscule crap on my desk.

683
00:35:53,300 --> 00:35:58,360
Would that not be the same in the VR and what I start buying NFTs, right?

684
00:35:58,360 --> 00:35:59,360
Is this a rabbit hole?

685
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:01,320
And what if I'm in a different kind of mood?

686
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:05,560
Maybe today I want to work in like a koi, you know, like a Buddhist monk temple with

687
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:11,120
a koi pond, which is like my, my, you know, VS code window floating in the air.

688
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:14,620
But maybe sometimes I feel like I'm Batman, you know, it's 1989.

689
00:36:14,620 --> 00:36:18,160
Sometimes I want the log cabin, but I just recently decided to switch to the space station.

690
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:20,160
Are you really doing the space station?

691
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:21,360
I kind of like it now.

692
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:25,040
You know, it just feels like, it feels like a high level because you've got that big window

693
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:26,600
where you can see earth.

694
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:29,760
It just seems like, you know, this is where I could go to think big about stuff.

695
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:33,440
Maybe this feels like it could become like some very unhealthy.

696
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:34,920
We mentioned them every week now.

697
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:40,920
William Gibson style stuff, you know, I don't know, we'll trade NFTs, you know, we can have

698
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:45,200
Koda radio NFT swag for your virtual desk.

699
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:47,240
Instead of Clippy, you have a VR jar jar.

700
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:51,240
We just have entire economies that are, that are propped up selling virtual goods.

701
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:52,240
What could go wrong?

702
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:53,240
Nothing.

703
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:54,240
Nothing.

704
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:55,240
This feels healthy.

705
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:56,240
No, I mean, we don't, I just don't take it there.

706
00:36:56,240 --> 00:37:00,120
You know, I feel like if you just take it for what it is now, it's just a new way to

707
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:04,220
work that still feels like it's, it's not a hundred percent there yet.

708
00:37:04,220 --> 00:37:05,220
It's more casual.

709
00:37:05,220 --> 00:37:06,460
It's more consumption.

710
00:37:06,460 --> 00:37:09,360
It's more iPad than it is laptop at this point.

711
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:14,680
But I could really see one, just literally one generation difference.

712
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:18,160
Or if Apple comes out with something or the Simula VR headset.

713
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:21,120
And then listen, I'm going to tell you, I was very skeptical on Apple coming out with

714
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:25,160
something Tim, there's 30% here for you.

715
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:26,380
You could get it.

716
00:37:26,380 --> 00:37:31,240
This is my thought is it actually really works well with the app store model.

717
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:35,300
It's it's kind of a perfect.

718
00:37:35,300 --> 00:37:39,160
And people are charging a premium for VR content because it does take more work.

719
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:41,800
Only thing is Apple is so into the AR idea right now.

720
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:45,800
Yeah, but there is overly, by the way, a little pro tip, you can turn it on in your settings

721
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:50,280
and then you can just double tap the side of your Oculus and it will turn on the AR

722
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:53,800
cameras so you can see around your room, which is really neat like in the, when the kids

723
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:54,800
come running in.

724
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:58,620
So I recommend that's in the settings for guardian.

725
00:37:58,620 --> 00:38:01,840
And then it's just a, like, it's just a sensor they have in there.

726
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:05,760
So you just tap it hard enough for the sensor to read it and then it flips on the AR cameras.

727
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:09,240
And I think that's where Apple could really do a lot better job than Oculus because those

728
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:10,240
cameras kind of suck.

729
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:11,240
Yeah, they do.

730
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:17,360
Where you could really see how Apple could put in just iPhone quality cameras with LIDAR

731
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:19,680
and the Apple AR stuff that they already exist.

732
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:21,280
You could you could bring them together.

733
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:23,480
It doesn't have to be just one or the other.

734
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:27,200
You know what I just like literally popped in my head all the fitness plus stuff that

735
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:30,640
Apple is doing and the fact that the watch is getting better and better heart readings

736
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:32,480
and oxygen readings.

737
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:36,200
I could see that being particularly for me, someone with a heart condition, like my ultimate

738
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:40,760
fitness setup is an Apple VR where instead of boxing and supernatural, which is now I

739
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:45,200
think of going to be a Facebook property or already is, you know, whatever their version,

740
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:46,200
right?

741
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:50,400
Or some, in fact, some developer could make like, you know, boxing class.

742
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:51,400
Wow.

743
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:52,400
Peloton is screwed.

744
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:54,660
I know that is a way better to work out.

745
00:38:54,660 --> 00:38:55,660
It's way better.

746
00:38:55,660 --> 00:39:00,640
It's so much more fun to like blow stuff up and fight stuff for your workout.

747
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:06,840
And just as an aside, Mark Zuckerberg was recently on the Lex Friedman podcast.

748
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:13,800
And in there, Zuck talks about some of their ideas for software development in VR.

749
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:19,760
And also about how they'll casually be able to create VR environments for just regulars,

750
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:22,400
you know, just sort of block building kind of stuff.

751
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:27,800
He is of the opinion, it sounds like to me that within a few years, he expects this is

752
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:33,320
probably going to make the developers at Meta about 5% more effective on average for their

753
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:34,640
daily job.

754
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:40,500
But he feels like if you take that 5% and you multiply it across all of Meta's developers,

755
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:41,600
that's a huge return.

756
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:44,760
And that immediately pays for the headset itself.

757
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:47,320
And so he thinks it's, that's the direction these things are going.

758
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:53,640
And they have mandated that staff now use all these virtual workspace apps for their

759
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:56,640
collaborative meetings, like Horizon workplaces and whatnot.

760
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:58,600
So they're dogfooding everything they're putting out.

761
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:00,520
That's part of their mandate now.

762
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:03,400
So how does it make you more productive?

763
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:08,440
I think the number one thing is the interaction in meetings is way more natural.

764
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:12,080
So you know, you never really make eye contact in a video call.

765
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:15,440
When you're in a Zoom call, you're either looking at their face, but the person on the

766
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:18,000
other side then sees you looking down.

767
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:22,560
Or you look in the camera, so you're looking in their eyes on the other side, but then

768
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:24,880
you're looking at the camera and you can't see them.

769
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:30,120
In VR, the headset can detect the position of your head and figure out when you're looking

770
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:32,920
at somebody and it creates an eye contact.

771
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:37,280
Additionally, the positional audio means that you can hear someone on your left and your

772
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:40,280
right and you hear where they're at in the room with you.

773
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:44,960
And it also means you could even lean over and say, Hey, you know, this guy is just going

774
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:45,960
on forever.

775
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:47,440
We should wrap this up.

776
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:50,840
Like you can in a real meeting and the person on the other end of the room can't necessarily

777
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:51,840
hear you.

778
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:53,000
So there's that kind of stuff.

779
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:57,160
Plus, you also see like right now as I'm talking to you, I'm actually expressing quite a bit

780
00:40:57,160 --> 00:41:01,480
of this conversation with my hands, even though I'm sitting in a studio by myself.

781
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:03,120
And all of that comes through as well.

782
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:04,120
Sure.

783
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:05,480
Also, it's lower latency.

784
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:10,160
So there's that factor as well, because you're not sending an H.264 video stream and an AAC

785
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:11,160
audio.

786
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:16,240
You're just sending vector information and then it's being rendered locally on your machine.

787
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:19,880
And then there's just the, you know, audio to go along with that.

788
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:25,360
But you don't actually have to perfectly nail that audio timing so you can actually be a

789
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:27,560
little more creative with that.

790
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:31,080
And so it actually produces a lower latency experience.

791
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:33,040
So it makes the meetings more natural.

792
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:37,500
You don't have that issue that you have on VoIP calls or Zoom calls now where people

793
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:41,520
can't quite tell if you're done talking or just pausing because the latency makes it

794
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:45,080
hard to guess the gap when you should jump in or not.

795
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:46,080
That kind of stuff goes away.

796
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:47,080
Damn.

797
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:48,080
I could totally see that.

798
00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:52,720
I know a lot of people listening probably think we're crazy, but you know, here we were

799
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:59,820
two cynical skeptics like just two, three weeks ago, you know, and I admit my big blocker

800
00:41:59,820 --> 00:42:01,360
was the Facebook connection.

801
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:03,840
I just didn't take it seriously.

802
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:08,640
But now that like you, now that I've tried this, I'm 90% sure Apple's going to release

803
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:10,360
a device like this.

804
00:42:10,360 --> 00:42:13,920
And I could see Apple doing some crazy stuff where they like call Adobe and make a deal

805
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:20,360
that like the Mac OS, iOS, and like Apple VR OS, whatever it's going to be, you know,

806
00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:26,760
you can be working on your InDesign file or hell, we might see like a flourishing of CAD

807
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:31,240
software on Mac because then, okay, you can go into the Apple VR and like do a meeting

808
00:42:31,240 --> 00:42:35,360
with it and have the actual like item you're building right there.

809
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:36,680
I am so torn.

810
00:42:36,680 --> 00:42:41,680
I've been talking to Wes about it since like Saturday or Friday.

811
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:44,120
I am so torn on the Simula V1.

812
00:42:44,120 --> 00:42:51,480
So the base price to pre-order and you can do 50% upfront or you can do it all upfront,

813
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:59,280
but the base price for this Simula VR Linux computer is $2,700 and their limited availability

814
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:02,920
one is five grand.

815
00:43:02,920 --> 00:43:05,240
I know, I know.

816
00:43:05,240 --> 00:43:09,440
Says the guy sitting in front of a $5,000 iMac Pro that will be obsolete in two months.

817
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:10,440
But yeah.

818
00:43:10,440 --> 00:43:11,440
It is an entire computer, right?

819
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:12,440
It's not just a VR headset.

820
00:43:12,440 --> 00:43:18,360
It is an entire modern 11th Gen Intel Linux compatible computer and the computer component

821
00:43:18,360 --> 00:43:21,720
is actually detachable from the headset.

822
00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:23,480
So there's that element of it.

823
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:27,440
So it's not like it's a crazy, crazy investment and they're really upfront about the cost.

824
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:30,920
They explain, you know, the screen and the stuff that's causing the price.

825
00:43:30,920 --> 00:43:36,960
And I feel like a Linux enthusiast who's now starting to become a VR enthusiast, this feels

826
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:44,160
like the perfect crossover, but I worry having experienced the Oculus, that my gut tells

827
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:49,800
me the VR headset is more like a phone than it is like a computer.

828
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:54,800
And so it means you need an app store and you need an ecosystem and you need developers

829
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:57,320
that are pushing to get their content on here.

830
00:43:57,320 --> 00:43:59,400
And this isn't going to have any of that.

831
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:02,940
It's just going to have a really good working environment and it's going to be able to bring

832
00:44:02,940 --> 00:44:10,600
in some floating screens, which is going to be awesome, but it feels like only a third

833
00:44:10,600 --> 00:44:13,380
of what the VR headset should do.

834
00:44:13,380 --> 00:44:17,840
And so when you're, when you're looking at nearly $2,700, I don't know, that's really

835
00:44:17,840 --> 00:44:18,840
tricky.

836
00:44:18,840 --> 00:44:22,740
I would be, and I know people are going to like burn us in the comments on this, but

837
00:44:22,740 --> 00:44:24,640
I would be Sue.

838
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:28,200
Like now is probably not the time to start a big new VR project, especially if you're

839
00:44:28,200 --> 00:44:29,400
an independent developer.

840
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:32,680
One is something I want to mentioned.

841
00:44:32,680 --> 00:44:34,800
MacBook is doing a good job with the SDKs.

842
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:38,440
There's like the native ant, there's the native SDK, there's, they have great, it looks like

843
00:44:38,440 --> 00:44:40,440
really good unity support.

844
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:42,340
Maybe that's unity doing a good job.

845
00:44:42,340 --> 00:44:46,960
And they have unreal engine support and web RX, which I don't know much about.

846
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:52,860
If Apple's really going to release something in the next, let's say 10 months, I just feel

847
00:44:52,860 --> 00:44:56,520
like that will be an automatic win unless Apple stupidly makes it like for grant.

848
00:44:56,520 --> 00:44:58,280
Oh, they'll make it expensive.

849
00:44:58,280 --> 00:45:02,240
But now that I've seen this thing sitting at 2,700, it's going to seem like a deal because

850
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:07,240
it probably will be two grand, like a Gurman or whoever said it was going to be.

851
00:45:07,240 --> 00:45:10,640
This is going to be another thing that's also going to leave a bunch of people behind.

852
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:11,640
How do you mean leave them behind?

853
00:45:11,640 --> 00:45:12,640
It's just too expensive?

854
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:13,640
Well, there is that.

855
00:45:13,640 --> 00:45:15,120
Although I would imagine the price will come down, right?

856
00:45:15,120 --> 00:45:19,440
You can get a, you can find an Oculus for 300, $350 used.

857
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:23,240
So I imagine the prices will come down over time and they'll hold, they'll have probably

858
00:45:23,240 --> 00:45:29,160
multiple additions where they keep one that they've released years ago and they do like

859
00:45:29,160 --> 00:45:30,760
they do with the phones.

860
00:45:30,760 --> 00:45:36,600
So I think the pricing thing will solve itself after the initial kind of ecosystem gets established.

861
00:45:36,600 --> 00:45:42,440
But I just mean there's a lot of technology coming that people are just not getting on

862
00:45:42,440 --> 00:45:44,120
board with anymore.

863
00:45:44,120 --> 00:45:46,760
My dad never bothered with social media.

864
00:45:46,760 --> 00:45:48,400
I say good move, right?

865
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:52,580
Never has created any account on any social media platform ever.

866
00:45:52,580 --> 00:45:55,000
Never has checked a social media platform.

867
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:56,000
And that's fine.

868
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:59,440
Actually, I used to work with a guy who didn't get a cell phone.

869
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:00,440
You know what I'm saying?

870
00:46:00,440 --> 00:46:03,460
In each major wave, there's people who just decide not to jump on.

871
00:46:03,460 --> 00:46:06,640
It feels like cryptocurrency is definitely one of those, at least Bitcoin.

872
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:09,160
And it seems like VR is one of those things.

873
00:46:09,160 --> 00:46:12,440
It's like there's just going to be some people that are just going to nope out like, ah,

874
00:46:12,440 --> 00:46:15,840
this is a scam or this isn't going anywhere.

875
00:46:15,840 --> 00:46:16,840
It's weird.

876
00:46:16,840 --> 00:46:19,120
It feels like there's more and more resistance than ever these days.

877
00:46:19,120 --> 00:46:23,520
Yeah, but you know, once something really new comes out, I think it's going to, there's

878
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:25,000
going to be another cycle of hotness.

879
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:28,280
Now granted pricing is going to be a thing and I think that's why Facebook's the new

880
00:46:28,280 --> 00:46:29,280
okay.

881
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:31,280
It's going to be a hundred bucks, right?

882
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:34,960
So if Apple, Apple will as always have their high end, like you're, like you were saying,

883
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:39,120
German saying, but I don't know, I could see it.

884
00:46:39,120 --> 00:46:40,120
Poor HoloLens.

885
00:46:40,120 --> 00:46:43,960
You know, it's funny is now what Apple is going to start doing is they're going to start

886
00:46:43,960 --> 00:46:48,560
slowly ratcheting up the price of apps.

887
00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:52,320
If they release a headset, apps are going to be $24.99.

888
00:46:52,320 --> 00:46:56,560
I mean, even mobile apps, good mobile apps are expensive to develop these days because

889
00:46:56,560 --> 00:47:02,000
the consumer expectation is so high, but just the level of graphical assets you need for

890
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:05,520
even any like relatively simple VR experience.

891
00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:09,080
And you probably are going to want some sort of way to bring in folks as NFT products.

892
00:47:09,080 --> 00:47:16,640
I can't believe I'm on board with NFTs now, but these are big undertakings.

893
00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:20,760
These are bet the company moves for, I think most smallish indie developers.

894
00:47:20,760 --> 00:47:25,600
Unless, you know, unless you're doing some like trivial, not trivial, but like you're

895
00:47:25,600 --> 00:47:26,600
not, you know what I mean?

896
00:47:26,600 --> 00:47:33,400
You're doing something that's not that complicated, but to have a really good virtual experience,

897
00:47:33,400 --> 00:47:39,200
I can't even imagine just the graphical assets alone, what the cost is going to look like.

898
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:44,720
There could be whole design firms opened up, if you're a very skilled 3D designer, you

899
00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:51,480
might consider design consultancy, just supplying developers and other companies effectively

900
00:47:51,480 --> 00:47:52,520
NFTs, right?

901
00:47:52,520 --> 00:47:53,520
Just the assets for the NFTs.

902
00:47:53,520 --> 00:48:00,480
Well, and if these things took off, if this became a legitimate ecosystem in a decade,

903
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:05,760
would we start looking at companies like Unreal as one of the premier IDE developers, perhaps?

904
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:08,520
Because you could see how that could be their wheelhouse.

905
00:48:08,520 --> 00:48:12,040
I think this is the best thing that's happened to Unity since iOS.

906
00:48:12,040 --> 00:48:17,400
Yeah, you know, Unity is having a resurgence.

907
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:18,400
Wild.

908
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:20,120
What a trip we just both had with this thing.

909
00:48:20,120 --> 00:48:24,080
I think, you know, my advice would be, unless you like to tinker with stuff early days,

910
00:48:24,080 --> 00:48:25,080
you could hold off.

911
00:48:25,080 --> 00:48:29,600
This isn't necessarily an endorsement to go out and buy one, unless you want to just play

912
00:48:29,600 --> 00:48:34,160
with this stuff and kind of see what we're talking about and experience it at the ground

913
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:35,160
level.

914
00:48:35,160 --> 00:48:38,080
I think one revision away, and it's time to buy.

915
00:48:38,080 --> 00:48:45,040
Well, I got to tell you, if you're young, like I was when iOS came out and you can shoot

916
00:48:45,040 --> 00:48:51,000
your shot and you don't have a lot to lose, I would probably say to hell with mobile and

917
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:53,080
take a look at this stuff.

918
00:48:53,080 --> 00:48:56,040
Start small, but you'll be early.

919
00:48:56,040 --> 00:48:58,040
It's got that hungry consumer thing going.

920
00:48:58,040 --> 00:49:00,760
People have their new hot device and they want to grab apps for it.

921
00:49:00,760 --> 00:49:04,280
I'm spending money on the Oculus apps like a drunk sailor, right?

922
00:49:04,280 --> 00:49:05,280
I know it sucks.

923
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:06,560
It sucks.

924
00:49:06,560 --> 00:49:07,560
And the apps are pricey.

925
00:49:07,560 --> 00:49:12,560
Yeah, I wasn't really, I didn't really budget that in, but it's, I'm slowing down now.

926
00:49:12,560 --> 00:49:14,440
But yeah, I definitely, I went shopping.

927
00:49:14,440 --> 00:49:18,320
You know, you get this device, you got to load it up with apps and you know, hey, they're

928
00:49:18,320 --> 00:49:19,840
cheaper than a Switch game.

929
00:49:19,840 --> 00:49:22,040
I bought Resident Evil 4 for the fourth time.

930
00:49:22,040 --> 00:49:23,480
All right, eighth time.

931
00:49:23,480 --> 00:49:24,480
But yeah.

932
00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:27,680
Well, I've got to go fight Darth Vader, so we should probably wrap it up there.

933
00:49:27,680 --> 00:49:29,480
Is there anywhere you'd like to send folks?

934
00:49:29,480 --> 00:49:32,440
Go to alice.dev and help fund my VR habit.

935
00:49:32,440 --> 00:49:33,640
Right, right, right.

936
00:49:33,640 --> 00:49:35,680
Why not join us on Matrix?

937
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:39,920
