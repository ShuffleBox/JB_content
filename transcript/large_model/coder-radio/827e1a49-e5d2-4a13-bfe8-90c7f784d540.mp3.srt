00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
This is Koto Radio, episode 313 for June 14th, 2018.

2
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,880
Welcome to Koto Radio, Jupiter Broadcasting's weekly talk show, taking a pragmatic look

3
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:40,640
at the art and business of software development and its related technologies. This episode

4
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:45,440
is brought to you by our two fine sponsors, Digital Ocean and Linux Academy. I'll tell

5
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:50,600
you more about those sponsors as this show goes on, but our host, our host is established

6
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:57,600
in the stormy bayous of Florida. It's Mr. Dominic. Hello, Mike.

7
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:02,300
Greetings from Thor's apartment. Yeah, it really is the hammer of thunder

8
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:06,040
over there. You might hear a little bit in the background from time to time. Apparently,

9
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:10,040
it's the apocalypse in Florida. Are you going to be okay? Are you going to survive this?

10
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:14,560
If I don't, I'll get eaten by alligators, so it's very green, very ecologically efficient.

11
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:19,180
Yeah, it is the circle of life. Well, Mr. Dominic, we have a great show, so we're going

12
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:23,080
to get to our traditional follow-up and feedback, and then later on in the show, the CEO of

13
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:28,320
GitLab is going to join us. Sid Brande will come on and he'll talk about GitLab and what

14
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:31,240
they're doing and some new things that are in the work. I think it's going to be a fascinating

15
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:35,800
chat in light of recent news, but before we go, there's some things that I have to give

16
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:40,440
Mike a hard time about. Some traditional follow-up here on the show, and probably to keep things

17
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:47,760
continuous, continuity, I suppose, we should start with a follow-up on last week's episode

18
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:54,840
where Mr. Dominic had a strong reaction to Apple's WWDC, but you had a chance to sit

19
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:58,760
down, read some of the docs, and burn everything to the ground.

20
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:04,560
Yeah, I still think the videos are terrible. I just want to put that front and center,

21
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:08,080
but what I was impressed with when I actually got to look at some of the session videos

22
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:17,800
and the docs really was ARKit 2, and I don't know if I'm impressed with Metal. I find it

23
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:22,960
intriguing that they're deprecating OpenGL in favor of Metal. Did you catch that little

24
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:23,960
bit there?

25
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:27,440
Oh yeah, I did. Oh yeah, I caught that. I definitely caught that. Yeah, I'm really torn

26
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:31,520
on that because Metal does seem like it lets people, developers, accomplish some really

27
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:36,400
great stuff, but at the cost of industry standardization.

28
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:41,800
Right, which is weird because they're really doing all they can to make Swift not an Apple

29
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:47,720
language, right? It's an open source standard, but on the graphics side, Metal is completely

30
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:48,720
proprietary.

31
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:53,760
Yeah. OpenGL never has been great on the Mac platform.

32
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:57,600
Is that Apple's fault, or? Yes, it is actually. Never mind.

33
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:06,240
I think so. It's hard to say, but yeah. So, Metal aside, ARKit, yeah, I think actually

34
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:10,080
the Mac got some of the best stuff in this last round. There's no good Mac hardware,

35
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,080
but that's a separate issue.

36
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:16,360
That's a separate issue. I mean, I actually updated my MacBook Pro to Mojave, which you

37
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:17,360
have to say with the little...

38
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:20,040
Oh, you did? Really? You really rolled the dice, huh?

39
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:26,760
I rolled the dice. Dark mode looks terrible on apps that aren't ready for it, shocker,

40
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:31,800
but the updates to Xcode are really, really nice, particularly if you are in any way an

41
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:38,720
Xcode user. Check out the session video for LLDB and new debugging tools. There's a lot

42
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:46,040
of just cool stuff added to Xcode. Now, if you've ever used a JetBrains IDE or Visual

43
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:51,640
Studio proper, you'll be like, okay, so this is features that they should have had years

44
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:58,440
ago, but the fact that they have them now is really good. In particular, just the command

45
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:11,240
line interface on the console in Xcode is just awesome. It's really catching up. I understand

46
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:17,280
from the technical session what they're doing with the whole machine learning and kind of

47
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:21,200
the machine learning. Remember we talked about the machine learning on the iMac Pro potentially

48
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:25,560
using Swift to train your models. I now get what they mean that for. You are not going

49
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:31,520
to build a giant backend service that's like an AI assistant. What you might build though

50
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:39,560
is like a little help, like a help function or some other kind of tangential or additional

51
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:44,920
functionality into an app on an Apple platform. If that's all you're doing, if machine learning

52
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:48,400
and AI, and I'm starting to hate the term machine learning because apparently everything

53
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:54,440
is machine learning now, this is a not so painful path, except for the big thing that

54
00:04:54,440 --> 00:05:01,960
I know Chris is going to jump all over. The hardware is just, you would not do this, right?

55
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:08,000
You would not generally want to train machine learning models on any of the common Mac hardware

56
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,160
today. I mean, maybe an iMac Pro, sure.

57
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:15,440
And you wouldn't really expect the story to be, we'll use an eGPU. Oh, and yeah, we'll

58
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:20,160
get Nvidia. We'll get Nvidia working in there, but for now just use an eGPU. That's not really

59
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:24,800
the answer. And the answer also can't be buy an iMac Pro. And the thing is the iMac Pro

60
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:33,560
is now damn near 200 days old. So even their newest machine is old. That is not competitive.

61
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:37,320
And so they want to get into this VR, AR, they want to get into machine learning. They

62
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:41,320
want people to look at Mac OS Mojave as a professional workstation. They got to close

63
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:45,480
the gap on the hardware. They got to fix the MacBook keyboard and they got to get newer

64
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:49,720
cost-effective machines out that developers can start to experiment with. They almost

65
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:52,640
have to go back a little bit to their roots when they were trying to convince developers

66
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:55,040
to come over to the Mac again.

67
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:59,440
And so the reason why I thought WWDC was decent is because I could see the groundwork. I could

68
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:03,640
see the software groundwork being laid. I don't see any hardware suggestions or hints,

69
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:08,440
but that's not necessarily indicative of anything. But that's why I thought it doesn't really

70
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:13,520
impact my day-to-day life. Not going to change how I do work, but if I use the Mac platform

71
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:21,360
and iOS to an extent, because their automation stuff with their workflow version of shortcuts

72
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:27,120
I think is powerful. So if I followed that platform closely or was looking forward to

73
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:31,960
improvements to that platform, I would consider I got something, at least a value out of WWDC.

74
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:37,640
If they don't answer it though with the hardware component soon, it's still half the story.

75
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:42,520
Yeah, I would even add too that if you're not like a graphics development person, which

76
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:48,720
I am not though I'm having to learn more Metal than I would like, Metal is actually kind

77
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:53,840
of the unsung hero of this WWDC, I think, when you look at the technical docs. For instance,

78
00:06:53,840 --> 00:07:00,040
core animation, which is, if you don't know, it's a high-level framework. Basically a common

79
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:05,500
pattern let's say would be, you know, animation with duration, blah blah blah, here's a C

80
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:10,120
block with your animation. That's obviously the Objective-C syntax. What would happen

81
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:15,240
in the past is that would be a core animation call, which would call into the core animation

82
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:20,520
API, which in turn would actually call into OpenGL for you. So you needed no knowledge

83
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:24,080
of OpenGL, right? Just like Grand Central Dispatch.

84
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:26,240
Don't worry about that. Don't worry about that.

85
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:32,040
Right. It's an abstraction, right? Just like Grand Central Dispatch is and was an abstraction

86
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:37,640
over threading, core animation is now not calling into OpenGL, is my understanding.

87
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:41,720
It's calling directly into Metal, which does seem to have some significant performance

88
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:50,080
increases. I think going forward, particularly if you're looking at AR solutions, the investment

89
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:56,720
of learning Metal, which is a pretty, I've been doing some research into it, thick and

90
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:02,840
juicy piece of API, is probably going to pay off big time. And of course there was a little

91
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:04,840
carrot for me that I didn't know about it.

92
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:06,880
Oh, what was it?

93
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:10,040
This to God's one true programming language.

94
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:12,720
Oh, really? Objective-C got some-

95
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:16,240
Objective-C has quietly been getting improvements. I love it.

96
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:19,920
Really? That's good. You know what? That must be because there's still some diehards in

97
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:21,840
Apple that are using it, right?

98
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:26,040
There's got to be one guy like me saying, I don't care. What's that Swift for? Get it

99
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:27,040
out of here.

100
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:31,200
I love it. You know what? Maybe it was a birthday present to you because rumor has it you and

101
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:34,400
Donald Trump share similar birthday weeks. So happy birthday, Mr. Trump.

102
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:35,400
Yeah, mine was yesterday.

103
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:40,920
Yeah, and Trump's is today. So you and Donald get together, have a little birthday party

104
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:45,880
this weekend and Apple gave you a gift and that was some modest improvement at Objective-C.

105
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:48,520
What was it in particular?

106
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:52,720
It's just some basically better interop with Swift, a few more. They've been getting it

107
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:57,200
the whole time, but yeah, I know. A lot of it has to do with interoping with Swift and

108
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:02,280
being able to not be completely foreign. I mean, the reality of the situation is if you're

109
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:06,480
starting a new iOS app, you probably should just do it in Swift. Although there was a

110
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:10,520
great post I read and I completely agree and we should have put it in the show notes, but

111
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:15,040
I forgot where Objective-C is the one true programming language. And my favorite part

112
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:19,880
compared to Swift is that I didn't have to write this post. So see, I'm not the only

113
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:20,880
one.

114
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:24,520
Yeah. Speaking of people that are writing posts for us, just kind of gingerly related

115
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:29,020
to what we were just talking about. Rogue, Amoeba, long time, really high quality Apple

116
00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:35,200
software developers that have made third party apps for the Mac for ages have released a

117
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:40,280
post today called On the Sad State of Macintosh Hardware. And they basically lay it out there

118
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:45,320
that it's devastating to them that there is so much Mac hardware that's out of date that

119
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:50,480
they're seriously concerned as a Mac software shop. And if you look at the Mac Rumors Buying

120
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:55,760
Guide, every machine is essentially a don't buy with the exception of the iMac Pro, which

121
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:57,360
is marked as a neutral.

122
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,360
And just for-

123
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:01,040
It's a 5,000 plus dollar neutral.

124
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:10,480
Yeah. Yeah. And just for note, the Mac Mini today, 1,337 days old. That's how long ago

125
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:16,160
it was updated. The Mac Pro has been more than a year, 436 days. MacBook Pro, also more

126
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:24,440
than a year, 374 days. The MacBook Pro hasn't been updated for 374 days. And they say it's

127
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:28,800
very difficult to recommend the current crop of Macs to customers. And that's deeply worrisome

128
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:33,360
to us as a Mac based software company. For our internal needs, we've wound up purchasing

129
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:39,060
and used, we've wound up purchasing and used hardware for testing rather than optimizing

130
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:45,360
to compromise heavily on a new machine. This isn't good for Apple, nor is it what we want.

131
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:50,000
So I thought we should just mention that in the light of WWDC, there's still huge problems

132
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,540
and now it's the hardware stuff. And so that's the reality of that. And it's not just us

133
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:55,960
that's bitching about it. It's other people-

134
00:10:55,960 --> 00:11:01,680
No, it really isn't. I mean, I was actually pretty surprised that they didn't, at least

135
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:10,480
like spec bump, at least the iMac Pro, thinking this is your one really viable contender to

136
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:17,200
say like the high end Dells and basically everybody else, right? HP has high end machines,

137
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:23,880
Dell has high end machines, but they didn't do it, like nothing. So it seems-

138
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:27,520
I was recently just shopping here because Linux Academy is putting it in an OBS system

139
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:32,360
and it's like, well, what do we use? What is the go to high end PC that's guaranteed

140
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:37,480
to work with Linux? And I run through all the usual suspects and there's different compromises

141
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:42,840
with each set. And we've reached a point now where the Mac isn't even a consideration.

142
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:47,840
Yeah. I mean, we're doing the show right now 100% on Linux, right? I'm on POP and you're

143
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:48,840
on-

144
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:49,840
Yeah.

145
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:50,840
What do you want still, KDE?

146
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:51,840
Kubuntu 1804, all the way, baby.

147
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:52,840
Yeah.

148
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:57,600
Rocking it on all the machines, all the machines we're routing through audio, all on Kubuntu

149
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:04,840
end to end. So yeah, that is speaking of remote, I am remote this week. I'm in Texas. I think

150
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:12,120
I mentioned I'm at Linux Academy. I'm just outside of the Fort Worth area. And I have

151
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:17,800
been exposed now pretty heavily this week to a company that believes pretty deeply in

152
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:23,000
remote work. I'd say about half their staff, maybe more, maybe as much as 60%, 70% of their

153
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:28,600
staff are remote at Linux Academy. And they've, for competitive reasons and all kinds of reasons,

154
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:32,000
including some people just work better that way. You and I have gone back on this, back

155
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:37,040
and forth on this because I've been working remote now since May 27th. I have been on

156
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:43,760
the road since May 27th doing all of the shows and doing all running the business remotely.

157
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:48,000
And then coming here to Linux Academy, this is my last stop before I start the long haul

158
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:53,760
home. And it's really given me perspective on this remote work thing. And so if it didn't

159
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:59,800
make me smile, I don't know what would, yesterday, Mr. Dominic tweets, at Chris LAS is going

160
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:04,300
to have a lot of fun making fun of me on the next code of radio because I've already given

161
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:12,920
up the onsite work thing. So Mr. Dominic, here we go. John Kerry of the remote work

162
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:18,640
flip floppers, flipping and flopping on the remote work. And I want to know what happened

163
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:22,040
because you were going all in. I mean, you had an office building you're going down with.

164
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:26,560
You had people there on site. You had an air conditioning machine making ticking noises

165
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:29,200
in the background. You were all in.

166
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:35,680
And people were clear that that won't be too common anymore. It's funny because I flip

167
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:39,960
flopped on this a few times and it's always for the same reasons, right? What occurred

168
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:46,360
to me in this latest adventure is that limiting yourself to one physical location creates

169
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:53,440
all kinds of weird logistical problems where being remote doesn't. And people really, especially

170
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:58,640
developers, really don't do their best work chained to a desk nine to five every day.

171
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:03,160
If that hasn't been an adjustment for me because I've been working at a desk setting up a machine

172
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:07,920
and I hear a lot of different conversations around me and I have really lost my ability

173
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:09,240
to tune that out.

174
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:14,120
Right. And, you know, the problems I thought I was solving by going on on site are actually

175
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:19,240
solved in a much perhaps more brutal way. Like if someone screws something up, you should

176
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:27,880
just fire them like immediate where, you know, remote because remote requires and I think

177
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:32,080
this is going to be something that some people are going to have a hard time with. It requires

178
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:38,000
a level of kind of self accountability and self management that maybe some folks don't

179
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:42,760
have. But the reality is someone who's like a bad dev is going to be a bad dev on site

180
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:48,440
or off site, right? There's no, no difference. And, and, and maintaining the site is just

181
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:54,680
expensive. Yes. Now it's one thing to have like a small space to have like an office

182
00:14:54,680 --> 00:15:00,360
if you need to meet a client or, you know, whatever, but to every time you hire someone,

183
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:05,080
you need more desks, more, you know, obviously remote employees, you're still buying them

184
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:14,480
computers generally, but it's just like the, the ongoing process of growing becomes incredibly

185
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:24,040
costly with the space. And it, it doesn't seem, how can I put this?

186
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:28,920
It's not money spent on the core product in a way. It's not money spent well and the advantages

187
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:37,160
of having a centralized location, you know, I I'm in plant city, Florida right now, Tampa

188
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:42,840
or Orlando, Florida would be different to have an office, but the cost would be at least

189
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:47,000
double and that's just to be part of that community and whatever, but everything's more

190
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:51,700
expensive, right? It's like before we were in New Jersey, an office in Manhattan may

191
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:57,440
have been more beneficial, but like would have been like 10 times as much. Yeah. So

192
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:05,480
when you're small, uh, I've come to the realization that your main strength is actually a flexibility

193
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:12,480
and being tied down to one address is, is not flexible. It's not that go ahead.

194
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:15,680
No, I follow it. Go finish it up. Cause I follow what you're saying. It's like the being

195
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:19,680
a small, you have that dynamic flexibility. You can pivot, you can make drastic changes

196
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:26,440
and make big decisions, but when you add the cost of real estate or rent or just a contract,

197
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:28,520
it slows you down there.

198
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:34,860
Exactly. And you know, I still see an advantage in having a small space, um, that you can

199
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:38,680
meet a customer at, do an event at like we're actually a, I don't know if you know this

200
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:43,960
first, I tweeted this too, but you only get me on the gotcha tweets. Uh, the mad botters

201
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:49,280
now sponsoring the plant city software development meetup. So on the 21st after work, we're having

202
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:54,160
people over and we're catering coffee and a couple of, uh, treats there and in our office,

203
00:16:54,160 --> 00:17:00,640
yeah, on the 21st, yeah. In our offices in plant city. So that should be, uh, yeah, the

204
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:05,640
Thursday, if that's 21st, 22nd, I'm not sure, uh, that is one use for a space, right? It's,

205
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:10,280
it's good to have, you know, if your team's still relatively local, you can have meetings.

206
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:13,600
But the other reality is like, I don't know if you know this, the economy is really good

207
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:18,340
right now and hiring people is like super hard. So saying you must work in plant city

208
00:17:18,340 --> 00:17:22,600
Florida is not super effective.

209
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:29,440
Yeah. Okay. That's all fair. Um, what I've noticed that canonical and now Linux Academy

210
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:35,560
seem to do is they do seem to drop some cash on like large meetup events or summits or

211
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:40,560
sprints or whatever the companies happen to call them. And they, they bring people in

212
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:46,280
and have them work together for, for intense periods of time. Um, and then they go back

213
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:49,600
and go back and work remote and they seem to do that a few times a year. What are your

214
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:53,560
thoughts on something like that? Is that, is that feasible in a, in a, in a smaller

215
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:54,560
operation?

216
00:17:54,560 --> 00:18:01,280
Well, I think the smaller you are, the more budget constrained you are. Um, I could see

217
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:06,900
a situation where you're renting like a shared office type of space or indeed doing what

218
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:13,520
I'm doing. You are keeping a, a small physical office. Um, then yeah, I can see that making

219
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:16,920
sense. You know, maybe once a quarter.

220
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:21,120
You know, we should ask our guests about this. So why don't we bring on Sid Sabrande? He

221
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:26,000
actually is a pretty, a pretty big advocate for remote work. And I'd be curious how they

222
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:31,200
do that at GitLab. So we'll get there, but let's, let's get Sid. So without further ado,

223
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:37,240
joining us on the line from GitLab co-founder and chief executive officer is Sid Sabrande.

224
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:38,760
Sid, welcome to the show.

225
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:40,680
Thanks for having me.

226
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:44,880
How'd I do on that pronunciation of the last name? I just kind of took a shot at it.

227
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:45,880
Good enough for me.

228
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:51,800
Well, thank you for being generous. I appreciate that. So Sid, we absolutely wanted, we've

229
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:55,860
actually been wanting to chat with you forever, uh, because Mike is a GitLab user as part

230
00:18:55,860 --> 00:19:00,280
of his day-to-day business, but also, obviously thanks for that.

231
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:07,920
Thank you. Yeah. Yeah. It's actually, it's very popular with our audience. Um, and so

232
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:11,680
with the big news from Microsoft recently, we thought this would just be a great opportunity

233
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:17,120
to chat with you. Uh, and I, we were just talking about remote work and so I want to

234
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:21,040
get to there in a moment, but maybe we should just kind of back up a little bit. So GitLab

235
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:26,560
is famous for being an open core company. And I thought, I thought if I recall the first

236
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:30,680
time I'd ever seen you talk about it, I thought I recall you talking about GitLab as an open

237
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:35,520
source company. And then I noticed sort of a tone change to an open core company. So

238
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:39,280
would you, would you kind of explain how the GitLab model works for us?

239
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:45,720
Yeah, for sure. So GitLab started as an open source project by my co-founder Dimitri in

240
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:53,120
2011. And we, uh, uh, we built a company around it and we tried to finance that company in

241
00:19:53,120 --> 00:20:01,640
different ways. Um, we tried, uh, donations, we tried consulting, we tried support contracts,

242
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:07,040
um, but it all wasn't sustainable. And all the while that the popularity of the open

243
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:12,480
source project was increasing. So there was more and more time going into release management,

244
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:18,120
performance updates, uh, bug fixes, all these things that you have to do. So we needed a

245
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:25,560
better model. So we settled on licensed software. We, uh, introduced GitLab enterprise edition,

246
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:32,640
which is paid and, uh, proprietary. And so we changed from saying we were open source

247
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:38,760
to open core. There's both an open source edition and a proprietary edition of GitLab.

248
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:41,840
And that's what we, uh, that's what open core means.

249
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:48,040
I see. Thank you. So the other off the wall question I had is, is it true, the rumors

250
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:54,760
that, uh, before you started GitLab, the relational submarine company, is that a true thing?

251
00:20:54,760 --> 00:21:00,720
Yeah, it's a true thing. Uh, I was the first employee and, and, and incorporated a company

252
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:04,200
that still makes the most submarines every year.

253
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:09,720
No kidding. That is, that is the, that is the neatest little, like, I would love, I

254
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:14,920
didn't even know a personal submarine was something I could have. So it's, um, if you

255
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:21,400
want, you can have a trade over bowl, but it really is, is, uh, a bit expensive. It's

256
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:27,440
about $2 million. And, uh, most people that own it have a, a large boat to, uh, store

257
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:28,440
it on.

258
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:33,040
Sure, sure. Boy, I saw there's things to aspire to is what you're telling me. I, I like that.

259
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:36,960
So I, I guess, uh, also when I was digging through sort of your background, it looks

260
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:41,600
like, uh, you have some, or you used to, you used to at least have some love for, uh, Ruby.

261
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:45,000
Yeah, I used to be a Ruby on Rails developer.

262
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:50,160
Now, uh, I won't hold, uh, hold that against you in any way as, uh, as the show goes on,

263
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:53,960
but do you, I suppose these days, not much chance to do much Ruby?

264
00:21:53,960 --> 00:22:00,720
No, it's, uh, I went from programming code to maybe programming some processes in the

265
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:04,760
company. I do commit regularly to our handbook.

266
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:09,960
Okay. So, um, let's talk about the company for a little bit. So let's talk about GitLab.

267
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:11,880
How big is GitLab now?

268
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:15,400
It's 300, 300 people.

269
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:19,880
Holy smokes. The last number I saw was somewhere in the hundreds. That's, that's amazing. So

270
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:23,400
these last few weeks must have been, uh, pretty remarkable.

271
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:31,080
Yeah, it was amazing. After, uh, GitHub got acquired, um, we saw a lot of love for GitLab,

272
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:35,600
a lot of people migrating, but especially a lot of people giving GitLab an audit look

273
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:39,960
and, uh, and really being amazed by where we've come since a few years ago.

274
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:45,720
I think both Mike and I really liked, uh, the messaging approach that GitLab had around

275
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:50,960
the GitHub purchase. You guys really seemed on top of it, like almost like you were waiting

276
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:56,540
for this to happen. Like you had that stuff up your sleeve, ready to pull out. Can you,

277
00:22:56,540 --> 00:22:59,040
can you explain that a little bit to us?

278
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:03,900
There were rumors in the week before that they might've been acquired. And so we, uh,

279
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:09,840
we started preparing and, uh, I think, I think we did well in, in the preparations and over

280
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:14,920
the weekend we saw people moving to GitLab and, uh, it was great to see that, that response.

281
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:21,920
I'm looking at a tweet here from Zach Kaling, uh, who tweets, okay, I get it. GitLab's product

282
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:27,000
leapfrog GitHub. I'm shocked how incredibly nice, thoughtful, and well designed it is.

283
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:32,040
Fantastic building tools, incredible Kubernetes support, built-in CI-CD, security testing,

284
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:37,160
project management, and support features. Moving to GitLab. That is really what we love

285
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:42,560
to see. Not people moving because they're hating on Microsoft or GitHub, because I think

286
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:47,640
Microsoft is going to do a good job being a maintainer of GitHub, but really moving

287
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:51,480
because they, they like a single product for the whole DevOps cycle.

288
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:52,480
Yeah.

289
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:56,600
One thing that's very attractive, uh, for my company using GitLab is that we can host

290
00:23:56,600 --> 00:24:00,520
it ourselves. Do you, do you have any, do you see that as a competitive advantage for

291
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:05,960
you or is that kind of a, an offshoot of the main product or do you see that as the main

292
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:06,960
product?

293
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:11,080
Yeah, no, we, we have two products or we have one product and two ways to consume it. Either

294
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:15,120
you use our.com or you self-host it, but it's a, the self-hosting is a really important

295
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:19,000
part. Not in the least because it, uh, it means you have that freedom. Even if you're

296
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:23,320
using the.com, you'll always have an export button and you can move to your own hosted

297
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:30,120
instance or, uh, GitLab host.com or somewhere else where you want to, uh, where you want

298
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:31,120
to be.

299
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:37,120
Yeah. Now, uh, back to the acquisition of Microsoft, when you heard that, uh, when the

300
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:42,360
rumors first started circulating, were you concerned? It seems like it takes a, essentially

301
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:46,320
a competitor and sort of supercharges them with Microsoft's bank account.

302
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:52,240
Yeah. So they're going to have a bigger bank account. Um, and, um, I think for us, the

303
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:58,560
hardest thing will be that they'll have Microsoft's Salesforce. Like Microsoft speaks to a lot

304
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:04,280
of companies. Uh, they, they, they regularly deal at the C level in those companies and

305
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:10,840
they can now like add this additional, uh, offering to that, to their, to their bundles.

306
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:15,280
And then they're, they're famous for having a good bundling strategy. So that's going

307
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:21,120
to be harder for us. What's going to be better for us is that, um, they're going to be focused

308
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:27,160
on, on integrating with Microsoft and Azure and all those other things. And, uh, I think

309
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:31,500
for us, uh, we're going to go full steam ahead and we'll keep releasing every single month

310
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:36,600
and keep adding great features for the whole, uh, for that whole DevOps life cycle.

311
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:40,320
Now a little birdie tells me, speaking of some of those features, that there's something

312
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:44,960
called auto DevOps that's coming along. And I was wondering if you could share a little

313
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:47,080
details about auto DevOps.

314
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:55,480
Yeah. So we're really, really bullish on auto DevOps on a week from now, June 22nd, we'll

315
00:25:55,480 --> 00:26:01,280
release GitLab 11.0 and other DevOps will be generally available. And what you do is

316
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:08,120
you just push your code and GitLab does the rest. It will build your code, run your tests,

317
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:14,560
check the quality, do static application security testing, dependency scanning, license management,

318
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:18,760
container scanning. It will boot up a review app, kind of like a staging environment, per

319
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:24,640
merge request, dynamic application security testing and deploy it. It will do browser

320
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:29,920
performance testing and it will do monitoring of all the vital metrics. So all of that,

321
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:35,040
just by pushing your code, nothing to configure. We think that is the future and we're really

322
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:37,800
excited about having it out to the world.

323
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:40,560
Yeah. That's great timings. That's coming pretty soon.

324
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:43,960
Yeah. Now in a week, the 22nd.

325
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:49,160
Oh, very neat. Well, I look forward to hearing about it or seeing about it when it launches.

326
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:54,280
So auto DevOps, I am, I'm not familiar. I, I, but it sounds like a, sounds like a fantastic

327
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:56,880
addition and top of that, haven't you go ahead, Mike.

328
00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:00,880
No, I'm pretty deep into using the current continuous integration tools in the community

329
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:07,080
edition of GitLab. Is there a break point between auto DevOps and the enterprise edition?

330
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:10,120
Or is that just, everybody's getting that?

331
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:15,040
Everybody's getting auto DevOps. The only thing is that the security features right

332
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:20,240
now are ultimate edition. So they're not part of the community edition. I think all the

333
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:26,480
other things, maybe except the license management is, is part of it. So you just push your code

334
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:30,000
and you get your review app, you get the monitoring, everything.

335
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:37,400
Can we talk about the additions for a moment? Because I noticed that you've recently made

336
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:41,600
for open source projects and for schools, some of the high end plans are free now. So

337
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:45,560
can you talk a little bit about the reasoning behind that and what the different plans are?

338
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:47,960
Cause I'm, I'm a noob to this stuff.

339
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:54,340
Yeah. So we have a lot of universities using GitLab already and we wanted to make sure

340
00:27:54,340 --> 00:28:00,400
that those, the students, they train with all of our features. So when they go out into

341
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:05,040
the workplace, they tell their new employer, like, why aren't you using all these awesome

342
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:09,280
GitLab features that are available that many people are not yet aware of.

343
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:11,800
That's interesting. So it was a barrier for them.

344
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:16,880
It was a barrier. Universities don't have big budgets or they're not like paying for

345
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:22,560
software a lot. So we figured we just give this away. And also open source projects,

346
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:27,560
some open source projects like Gnome and Debian, they insist on using open source. So they

347
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:32,480
switched to GitLab and they're using core, but some open source projects are pragmatic

348
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:39,160
about whether they run on proprietary software. And for them, we, we, we want to make it easy

349
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:44,000
for them to also use all those security features. We're passionate about open source and we

350
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:49,080
want to help them in any way we can. And there's different plans for, for GitLab. So there's

351
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:54,520
a great core edition that's totally free, both if you download it or if you use private

352
00:28:54,520 --> 00:29:00,400
repos on GitLab.com. And we have three different tiers from starter, which is four bucks per

353
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:05,880
user per month, all the way to ultimate, which is 99 bucks per user per month.

354
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:11,600
So do you kind of see this as a type of contribution back to open source then?

355
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:17,320
So ultimate for free, we see that as a bit of a contribution, but what we don't want

356
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:23,320
to give is the impression that we think this is an alternative to having a really great

357
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:27,940
open source edition. We understand that there's lots of open source projects that only want

358
00:29:27,940 --> 00:29:33,340
to be based on open source. I will keep listening to Gnome and Debian and all the other projects

359
00:29:33,340 --> 00:29:38,300
who are in the process of switching. We'll make sure that core will always be a great

360
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:41,000
way to, to run an installation like that.

361
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:46,400
Do you think that could be a market that starts to grow and maybe, maybe as a result in somewhat

362
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:50,640
of this Microsoft purchase that, that core group of open source developers who maybe

363
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:55,280
have fairly large projects, but they do have that, I guess, moral ground you might call

364
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:58,720
where it has to be open source, but they need something that has enough features. It seems

365
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:00,680
like there could be some contention there.

366
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:04,680
I don't think it's going to be a problem. I think Microsoft has shown it's, it's an,

367
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:09,400
it's a new company. They're not pulling the tricks of the past. So I don't, I think that

368
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:16,280
companies and organizations are contemplating a move to GitHub will not be phased. Um, there

369
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:20,680
are, however, a lot of big open source projects that say, we're not going to go to someone

370
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:26,160
else's software as a service ever. We want to be in control. We want to run our own website.

371
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:33,160
And examples are like Ruby and Apache foundation and Gnome and Debian. And some of those are

372
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:37,840
now moving to GitLab. And we think if you want to self host a GitLab is the logical

373
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:41,520
choice and we want to stimulate that as much as we can.

374
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:48,280
Yeah. I was, uh, I was just a fantasizing about some news announcement one day, uh,

375
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:52,360
where the Linux kernel moves off of GitHub to a self hosted GitLab instance. And I was

376
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:57,600
trying to think of what would they need from a GitLab core to pull that off. And I wonder

377
00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:04,240
if everything is there yet and w would you be comfortable maybe contributing things to

378
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:07,360
the open source version that haven't been there in the past to meet those needs. If

379
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:11,640
it meant a significant maybe set of projects might come over.

380
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:16,600
Yeah, we're open to that. I don't think the Linux kernel considers themselves hosted on

381
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:21,560
GitHub at this moment. I think they're, they're hosted on self hosted Git and they're sending

382
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:28,920
patches by email. Um, if they ever wanted to move to GitLab, um, we'd be very open to

383
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:33,720
talking about open sourcing certain features. And with Gnome and Debian, it was the same.

384
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:38,080
We open source certain features that they, uh, they, they thought were absolutely essential

385
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:45,400
that, uh, that's, that's a great point. Uh, well put. Is it, um, go ahead. No, I was going

386
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:48,160
to switch to remote work, but if you've got more, keep going.

387
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:52,920
How common is it? Is it for someone to switch from the open source, uh, edition that I'm

388
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:57,280
currently on to the, to the, I want to say proprietor, but to the paid edition.

389
00:31:57,280 --> 00:32:05,200
Yeah. So far about 6% of the people have done that. And we think, uh, six, six or 60, uh,

390
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:12,600
zero six. So only, only five to 6% has actually switched to a paid edition. And we see it

391
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:17,800
increases as the organizational size increases and as they adopt more of the different features

392
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:24,880
of a GitLab. So Mike, probably you're not switching yet because you're, you might be

393
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:29,720
a smaller organization. If you were using, yeah, if you were using the same amount of

394
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:33,600
features that would like a thousand people, I think it would be a no brainer to switch

395
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:35,480
to a paid edition.

396
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:39,600
And does that process, uh, cause you know, we've done a few upgrades. We tested it out

397
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:44,600
for a while. Is that process a pretty easy turnkey process? I'm thinking in particular

398
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:48,960
because we have, I know a lot of our listeners are independent development shops, consultants

399
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:55,360
that maybe have 30, 40 people and are thinking about maybe it's time to step up to the ultimate

400
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:56,360
mission.

401
00:32:56,360 --> 00:33:04,640
Yeah. So, um, it is a very easy process. It's, uh, either you just install the new packages

402
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:10,440
and you import a backup. Um, but if you've downloaded GitLab recently, you'll probably

403
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:15,940
have enterprise edition by default with all the core features. Uh, but you have that installation

404
00:33:15,940 --> 00:33:19,680
and then it's really a question of just entering a license key and you're done.

405
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:21,280
Oh, that's great. Okay.

406
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:27,840
Yeah, that is great. I like that. Um, so Mike and I have had an on and off relationship

407
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:32,920
with remote work. He and I both, uh, have small businesses and we have a handful of

408
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:37,840
contractors and employees and we've, we've really tried to experiment with this remote

409
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:41,560
work and we've had this ongoing multi-year conversation now with our audience about it

410
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:46,400
who are also experimenting. And so when, uh, I was, uh, kind of doing some research on

411
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:51,640
you before the show, I saw several different talks where, uh, you sort of were a proponent

412
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:57,760
of remote work and you mentioned over 300 employees or a staff. How many of those roughly

413
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:01,640
if you can share are remote and can you, can you, uh, share your thoughts on that?

414
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:08,720
Yeah. So 100% of our team members are remote and we're now, uh, we have people in 40 countries.

415
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:16,180
Wow. Wow. And, and, um, I'm curious, do you supplement the remote work with like get together

416
00:34:16,180 --> 00:34:21,320
events like summits or sprints where you bring people together and have teams working together

417
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:24,180
for a bit and they go back home? How does that work?

418
00:34:24,180 --> 00:34:29,000
We do a summit every nine months and we try to go to a nice location. Last one was in

419
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:35,440
Crete in Greece and the next one is in Cape Town, South Africa and it's for a week and

420
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:39,320
we don't put you in a conference room for the entire week, but we try to go out and

421
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:45,040
do things together. Um, right. Which legitimately is team building too. Yeah. We think that

422
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:49,880
if we're going to all that effort and expense to get together, we shouldn't do things that

423
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:54,280
we could do remote, like watching a presentation. We should do things that you can only do in

424
00:34:54,280 --> 00:35:02,000
person like visiting something together. Um, and it's all about getting to know, uh, your

425
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:08,200
fellow team members and the members of the GitLab community. What's, but like every nine

426
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:14,080
months is way too little. So what we also do is, is a lot of like structured social

427
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:19,760
interaction. When you, when you spend one and a half hours every day, driving to work

428
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:26,640
or going to work there at work, you have kind of unstructured social interaction just by

429
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:31,720
virtue of people walking around, they'll talk to each other. We don't have that. So we facilitate

430
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:36,120
that. We have different things. We have things called virtual coffee breaks. We just schedule

431
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:40,440
time on someone's calendar. They understand the concept and you, you can talk about work,

432
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:46,680
but you don't have to. It's kind of just chit chatting. What facilitates that conversation?

433
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:52,880
It's Google calendar and zoom. Okay. And we ever, everyone that joins the company has

434
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:58,040
to, has to start with 10 so that they get accustomed to it. We have a team call every

435
00:35:58,040 --> 00:36:03,080
day and it's a five minutes of announcements and then 25 minutes of people talking about

436
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:08,760
their life outside of work. Sometimes it's about a certain subject. Today we had breakout

437
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:14,400
rooms. Suddenly you're in a room with just a subset of the people. That's a great, great

438
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:19,480
way to kind of get to know each other, get to know each other's hobbies. For people that

439
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:24,920
have like GitLab people around them, we also like pay for them to organize a meetup. And

440
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:28,680
if you want to go visit other GitLab team members, we, we pay for the travel that's

441
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:29,680
involved.

442
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:36,200
Really? Wow. So there is a bunch of interesting ideas in there that I'd never considered that.

443
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:41,920
That daily call strikes me as almost borderline too much though. Like in terms of taking productivity,

444
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:46,400
is that something that is debated a lot or have you found that that you just stick to

445
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:47,400
it and it works?

446
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:55,720
Yeah, I think you, you don't want to be too afraid of, of hurting productivity. People,

447
00:36:55,720 --> 00:37:00,440
what we always say is we don't monitor your hours, we monitor your results. And so we're

448
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:04,560
not, we're not going to, we're not going to force you to be in that call. It's, it's optional.

449
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:08,040
Like almost every meeting at GitLab, if you don't want to be there, you don't have to

450
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:12,240
be there. And if it's not interesting to you, it's totally fine to go do something

451
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:18,800
else while you're, while you're logged into a meeting.

452
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:22,560
And that's a nice balance. I like that balance you've struck there. That makes, that makes

453
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:26,400
a lot of sense. And then the other thing that I've, go ahead.

454
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:30,040
Yeah. People new to GitLab sometimes say, I'm going out for lunch and everyone says,

455
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:33,460
well, I have a great lunch, but you don't have to tell us. Like you're, you're the boss

456
00:37:33,460 --> 00:37:38,320
of your day. If you want to go to the gym during the day when it's quiet or to the supermarket,

457
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:41,200
that's the freedom of remote work and you should embrace it.

458
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:46,160
Boy, that really does sound appealing. So the other thing you said in there that is

459
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:51,560
a new concept and it sounds expensive to me as a business owner, but I like it, is you'll

460
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:56,160
pay for the travel if they want to go meet another team member. That, how does, how does

461
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:59,760
that really, does that work well? Even people don't abuse that and that's, that's not a

462
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:02,080
huge cost center.

463
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:07,520
It's not. So we pay for like the, the plane ticket. We'll pay a few hundred dollars and

464
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:12,840
then when they're there, they sometimes rely on the hospitality of the other team members

465
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:18,400
or connection they have to, to actually stay there.

466
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:24,000
That is, that really gives me something new to think about. And what about the onboarding

467
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:29,080
process? You know, getting somebody acquainted with the culture, how you work, some of these

468
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:33,240
ideas, it seems like the onboarding process maybe would be the time where you'd want people

469
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:34,240
together.

470
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:41,920
Yeah. So what's important is that you get to meet your, the other people that are also

471
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:48,200
onboarding because kind of you feel connected to them. So we do a GitLab 101s, which are

472
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:54,380
sessions where they ask questions to an executive. So it's not a presentation. It's just purely

473
00:38:54,380 --> 00:39:00,380
asking that executive questions. I do those and every C-level exec does those. It's also

474
00:39:00,380 --> 00:39:03,860
about getting to know the people in the company. So those, those virtual coffee breaks really

475
00:39:03,860 --> 00:39:08,320
help there. And then for the rest, we just want to make it as efficient as possible.

476
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:13,440
So you get an onboarding issue and there's more than a hundred check boxes on that of

477
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:17,560
all the things that have to happen. Most of it you have to do yourself, but also the work

478
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:21,680
that other people have to do for you, adding you to systems that's visible so you can check

479
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:26,720
whether it's still coming up or whether people have done that. And then we have a great handbook

480
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:30,840
of over a thousand pages that describes all the different processes in the company. You

481
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:34,880
don't have to read all of that, but everything that relates to your function, you're expected

482
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:41,960
to read. So you can onboard without having to bother people with a lot of questions.

483
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:45,840
Now you say great handbook. Now, didn't you earlier say that you work on the handbook?

484
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:46,840
Yeah.

485
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:48,840
You might be biased.

486
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:53,740
I'm very biased towards the handbook because we've seen it work.

487
00:39:53,740 --> 00:39:59,280
That's a good idea. I like that idea. I'll admit I've never thought about creating a

488
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:03,880
handbook, but I could really see the usefulness of it, especially if you're bringing on a

489
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:05,480
lot of people pretty fast.

490
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:10,600
Yeah. We're growing about TREACs year over year. So it's really important that we can

491
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:15,160
onboard new people. And people always say, look, I onboarded. And what was amazing was

492
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:18,820
every time I had a question, people were so nice. And then I always think, yeah, that's

493
00:40:18,820 --> 00:40:23,880
because you have 10 times less questions because most things are documented already. So when

494
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:28,040
there's few questions, it's easier to be receptive to them.

495
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:35,240
That makes a lot of sense. And as somebody who is just sort of getting acquainted with

496
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:39,120
GitLab after the recent news, I've always been aware of it, but really getting acquainted

497
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:44,640
now, that gives me a confidence in the long-term structure of the company. It sounds like there's

498
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:50,800
a real process for scaling, bringing new staff on, and keeping that going without derailing

499
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:54,240
the company because that can be one of the hardest things with a company is bringing

500
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:56,680
people on and getting that right.

501
00:40:56,680 --> 00:41:02,320
So I am pretty positive about the future. You must be as well. You must be pretty positive

502
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:05,200
about what at least the next few years have for GitLab.

503
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:11,440
Yeah. I'm super excited. This year, we're going to complete our vision of complete DevOps.

504
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:17,560
So it used to be that GitLab was just version control, and then it was just for developers.

505
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:21,360
And now we're going to make sure that you can run the entire lifecycle all the way up

506
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:25,460
to deploying to production and monitoring in GitLab. And we think that's going to bring

507
00:41:25,460 --> 00:41:31,040
so many advantages. Imagine you're rolling, you're pushing your code. It gets deployed,

508
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:37,120
but then GitLab says, sees that you're breaching a service level objective. It automatically

509
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:42,300
rolls back the code and says, hey, something went wrong here. Or overnight, there's like

510
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:47,000
Debian has a security update. It gets rolled out automatically, but we monitor it. And

511
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:51,760
if it doesn't work, we roll it back. So instead of babysitting deployments, you can do it

512
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:57,240
all with GitLab. And super excited by what we're doing there.

513
00:41:57,240 --> 00:42:02,800
So that's auto DevOps, right? And that's going to be launching on June 22. That's next week.

514
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:07,640
So one feature I mentioned is auto revert. That's not yet in GitLab, but that will be

515
00:42:07,640 --> 00:42:09,220
launching this year.

516
00:42:09,220 --> 00:42:13,900
It just really strikes me as a way to empower even understaffed open source projects. People

517
00:42:13,900 --> 00:42:18,200
that are on GitLab now that maybe don't have all of the resources that larger projects

518
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:22,960
might, this could help them get more done. So that's going to be a great feature.

519
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:26,880
Spend less time on your tooling. Spend less time on babysitting changes. Spend more time

520
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:28,560
on actually creating functionality.

521
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:33,720
Yeah. Well, Sid, thank you very much for coming on. I'm sure these are very busy days for

522
00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:37,240
you. And so Mike and I both really appreciate you making time to come on the Coder Radio

523
00:42:37,240 --> 00:42:38,240
program.

524
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:39,800
Anytime. Thank you.

525
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:45,400
Thanks, Sid. Boy, that was great picking Sid's brain on the remote work stuff. I mean, very

526
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:50,360
awesome hearing about GitLab and also very much looking forward to them launching auto

527
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:57,040
DevOps. But what do you think about his thoughts on the remote work stuff? Like they 100% remote

528
00:42:57,040 --> 00:42:58,580
work.

529
00:42:58,580 --> 00:43:03,440
You know what? Honestly, I was a little, cat got my tongue because I was thinking about

530
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:11,680
what he was saying. I was like, can that really work? I might have to try it. I mean, yeah,

531
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:17,160
some of that stuff, you know what, having the team meetups, it makes a ton of sense.

532
00:43:17,160 --> 00:43:23,040
And if they're growing, as he said, 3x year over year, it's scaled up to what, 300 people?

533
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:26,360
That's incredible to me. That's great.

534
00:43:26,360 --> 00:43:31,240
I'll put a link. He mentioned, as we were saying goodbye, that that handbook is open

535
00:43:31,240 --> 00:43:34,360
source. So I'm going to put a link to that in the show notes. So if you want to grab

536
00:43:34,360 --> 00:43:39,240
it, you can go to coder.show slash 313 and we'll have a link to their handbook that they've

537
00:43:39,240 --> 00:43:42,480
put in the show. But Mike, I think that's probably it right there. I think we should

538
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:47,880
probably wrap it up. I'm going to be traveling with kids for the next weekends or so. So

539
00:43:47,880 --> 00:43:51,080
I don't really know what the recording schedule is going to be. So just the surefire bet is

540
00:43:51,080 --> 00:43:56,880
coder.show slash subscribe. Mike and I will work it out over the next few days. But when

541
00:43:56,880 --> 00:44:01,100
we do publish an episode, as long as you go to coder.show slash subscribe and subscribe

542
00:44:01,100 --> 00:44:04,320
from one of the ways there, you'll get every single episode that we put out. Mr. Dominic,

543
00:44:04,320 --> 00:44:06,560
where should people find you throughout the week?

544
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:11,820
Follow me at Dominic on Twitter. Boom. You can follow me on Twitter. I'm at Chris L.A.S.

545
00:44:11,820 --> 00:44:16,520
and follow my journey home from Tejas at Jupiter broadcasting dot com slash Rover. Thanks so

546
00:44:16,520 --> 00:44:36,880
much for being here and hopefully we'll see you right back here next week.
