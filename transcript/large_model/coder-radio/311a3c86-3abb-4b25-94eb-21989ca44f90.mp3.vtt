This is Kota Radio, episode 427 for August 16, 2021.

00:15.360 --> 00:19.620
Hello friends and welcome in to Jupiter Broadcasting's weekly talk show, taking a pragmatic look

00:19.620 --> 00:23.580
at the art and business of software development and the world of technology.

00:23.580 --> 00:25.300
This episode is brought to you by Cloud Guru.

00:25.300 --> 00:30.360
You know, Cloud Guru has them Cloud Playgrounds, Azure, AWS, and Google on their sandboxes

00:30.360 --> 00:32.360

00:32.360 --> 00:37.280
So go get certified, get hired, get learning at a cloudguru.com.

00:37.280 --> 00:41.920
My name is Chris and joining us like the podcast champion that he is established in the hot

00:41.920 --> 00:42.920
zone.

00:42.920 --> 00:44.400
It's our host, Mr. Dominic.

00:44.400 --> 00:45.400
Hello, Mike.

00:45.400 --> 00:48.900
What's up, Mr. Fisher?

00:48.900 --> 00:52.520
Let me tell you, it is crazy.

00:52.520 --> 00:55.960
So I'm here right now at System 76 as we do the show in Denver.

00:55.960 --> 00:58.360
We made it last night around midnight.

00:58.360 --> 01:00.280
Nice, Mike.

01:00.280 --> 01:04.000
It was the worst driving of my life.

01:04.000 --> 01:06.640
It was a hurricane.

01:06.640 --> 01:11.440
It was like I was driving the RV into a destruction chamber.

01:11.440 --> 01:15.120
The I-76 sections of I-76 are so bad.

01:15.120 --> 01:16.520
It's 75 miles per hour.

01:16.520 --> 01:22.800
I had to drop it down to 35 miles per hour with my hazards on, crawling in the dark down

01:22.800 --> 01:27.320
this highway for an hour as it destroyed my home.

01:27.320 --> 01:29.440
It was brutal.

01:29.440 --> 01:30.840
It was horrible driving.

01:30.840 --> 01:36.640
In fact, I have had awful experiences coming into the Colorado Denver area every single

01:36.640 --> 01:37.640
time.

01:37.640 --> 01:40.560
And I think I will never, ever, ever do it again in my RV.

01:40.560 --> 01:43.080
I'll fly in, but I will never drive in again.

01:43.080 --> 01:46.160
It has been horrendous, the trip in here.

01:46.160 --> 01:50.080
Now this trip will always be a really great trip except for the drive into Denver was

01:50.080 --> 01:51.720
awful.

01:51.720 --> 01:53.280
It was awful.

01:53.280 --> 01:54.280
I didn't sleep.

01:54.280 --> 01:59.600
Afterwards, I was so traumatized by how bad the drive was, I couldn't sleep.

01:59.600 --> 02:01.160
But let me tell you, it's good to be here.

02:01.160 --> 02:07.860
It's good to be here, to be at System 76 where we said hi to a couple of people and parked

02:07.860 --> 02:09.000
right up against their entrance.

02:09.000 --> 02:12.600
I'm going to just sneak right in and grab us a couple more launches.

02:12.600 --> 02:13.600
No big deal.

02:13.600 --> 02:14.600
It's going to be great.

02:14.600 --> 02:16.880
How are you doing?

02:16.880 --> 02:17.880
I am good.

02:17.880 --> 02:21.760
Now, I didn't tell you this off the air because I kind of forgot.

02:21.760 --> 02:25.960
So remember how I had my son's school schedule?

02:25.960 --> 02:29.600
What I did not pay attention to was Monday, they get out an hour early.

02:29.600 --> 02:30.600
Oh my gosh.

02:30.600 --> 02:36.580
So I'm going to apologize in advance if anybody hears, I don't know, Mario or various other

02:36.580 --> 02:38.520
Nintendo Switch games behind me.

02:38.520 --> 02:39.520
Sure.

02:39.520 --> 02:42.720
Yes, I had the baseball slide into getting him.

02:42.720 --> 02:48.200
And have you carline that didn't exist when I was a kid, but it's a goddamn nightmare.

02:48.200 --> 02:49.200
Yep.

02:49.200 --> 02:52.800
The queuing up and it takes forever and you're just stuck.

02:52.800 --> 02:54.200
You're just stuck until it's done.

02:54.200 --> 02:55.200
Oh, yeah.

02:55.200 --> 02:56.200
No fun.

02:56.200 --> 03:00.400
You know, what was fun, though, is I was reading the Netscape.com home page.

03:00.400 --> 03:02.680
Just I don't know, like just bubbled up online.

03:02.680 --> 03:03.680
As one does.

03:03.680 --> 03:08.200
You know, you can download Netscape Communicator 401 for Macintosh and Windows and you can

03:08.200 --> 03:12.960
get communicator preview release six for Unix.

03:12.960 --> 03:13.960
Yeah.

03:13.960 --> 03:14.960
Wow.

03:14.960 --> 03:15.960
Reading the old Netscape.com.

03:15.960 --> 03:16.960
I'll put a link in the show notes.

03:16.960 --> 03:17.960
You guys should go check this out.

03:17.960 --> 03:22.880
It's like a whole other era where Netscape your guide to navigating the net and they've

03:22.880 --> 03:27.600
got like a sailing boat that's sailing across the digital Internet.

03:27.600 --> 03:29.960
It's it's really quaint.

03:29.960 --> 03:31.160
It's a totally different time.

03:31.160 --> 03:34.840
Oh, yeah, because it was it was like the web, but it was like an ocean to write.

03:34.840 --> 03:37.040
Sometimes it was a highway, like a superhighway.

03:37.040 --> 03:38.600
The information superhighway.

03:38.600 --> 03:41.560
Sometimes it was an ocean, you know, where we were just trying to wrap our heads around

03:41.560 --> 03:42.560
it.

03:42.560 --> 03:43.560
I don't know.

03:43.560 --> 03:44.840
Something just made me smile looking at that.

03:44.840 --> 03:51.120
You know, I thought we would get a just a metric ton of feedback about the Apple scanning

03:51.120 --> 03:54.920
your phone pictures for child porn and we didn't get a single email about it.

03:54.920 --> 03:55.920
How weird is that?

03:55.920 --> 03:57.600
I think they don't want us to talk about Apple.

03:57.600 --> 03:58.800
Well, that might be true.

03:58.800 --> 03:59.800
That might be true.

03:59.800 --> 04:03.600
They have a M1 NV could be or it's the exact opposite.

04:03.600 --> 04:04.600
They've all switched.

04:04.600 --> 04:07.480
They've got iPhones and they've made their choice and now they don't want to have to

04:07.480 --> 04:12.520
think about too much or maybe everybody's actually OK with it and it's just it's just

04:12.520 --> 04:16.680
us that are like, wait a minute, this seems like a pretty slippery slope here.

04:16.680 --> 04:23.520
I think Apple did say that they are going to change the program so that way it's not

04:23.520 --> 04:27.840
just the database run by the FBI, but it'll have to be hashes that are added by multiple

04:27.840 --> 04:31.520
countries at the same time or something like that.

04:31.520 --> 04:34.960
I have somebody mentioned something about Beijing before.

04:34.960 --> 04:38.320
Yeah, I've decided Macs just are horrible workstations.

04:38.320 --> 04:39.320
Today's experience.

04:39.320 --> 04:43.640
So I decided to bring a Mac with me on the trip just to, you know, give it a swing.

04:43.640 --> 04:46.600
And it's the best performing machine I have with the largest screen.

04:46.600 --> 04:49.480
And so I brought it to do the remote broadcasts.

04:49.480 --> 04:56.280
And it it has been so frustrating because of the the built in stuff that it just does

04:56.280 --> 04:57.480
in the background.

04:57.480 --> 04:59.360
And I have no control over it.

04:59.360 --> 05:03.700
One is like photo analysis of like detecting faces that I take with my iPhone.

05:03.700 --> 05:08.720
But the other thing that's actually killing me right now as we speak is this damn and

05:08.720 --> 05:10.860
has your session demand.

05:10.860 --> 05:18.400
This thing is taking two megs to four megabytes a second megabytes a second of bandwidth down.

05:18.400 --> 05:22.880
And I'm on a really limited LTE connection because the system 76 buildings actually blocking

05:22.880 --> 05:24.560
one of my cellular providers.

05:24.560 --> 05:27.400
So like I've got like no bandwidth to spare.

05:27.400 --> 05:30.120
And this damn Mac, this damn Mac.

05:30.120 --> 05:34.040
Doesn't matter how many times I kill NS URL session D. I turned off iCloud drive.

05:34.040 --> 05:36.040
I turned off all iCloud stuff.

05:36.040 --> 05:37.720
It doesn't matter what I do.

05:37.720 --> 05:43.560
I cannot get NS URL session D to stop taking every absolute available bit of bandwidth

05:43.560 --> 05:44.560
that I have.

05:44.560 --> 05:48.840
I'm looking at my at my bandwidth transfer chart right now and it's redlined.

05:48.840 --> 05:50.800
It is redlined the entire time.

05:50.800 --> 05:54.820
And I have like 60 kilobits left over for the conversation you and I are having right

05:54.820 --> 06:01.000
now and everything else, everything else is being allocated to this NS URL session D.

06:01.000 --> 06:05.120
And sometimes I see just background processes taking 200 percent of CPU core.

06:05.120 --> 06:07.160
I have no idea what they're doing.

06:07.160 --> 06:10.520
There's no way for me to prevent it because if I if I kill the process, launch D just

06:10.520 --> 06:12.160
restarts it.

06:12.160 --> 06:13.800
This is a joke workstation.

06:13.800 --> 06:18.740
The fact that I have no control and here I am trying to do a live stream, trying to do

06:18.740 --> 06:22.360
my job and the Mac is doing God knows what.

06:22.360 --> 06:23.360
I can't even tell what it is.

06:23.360 --> 06:27.080
I used activity monitor to check the open files and it doesn't give me any indication

06:27.080 --> 06:28.660
of what it's actually doing.

06:28.660 --> 06:31.640
So there could be that, too.

06:31.640 --> 06:34.200
Anyways, I just think it's a joke.

06:34.200 --> 06:37.360
And if anybody knows how to fix that, let me know.

06:37.360 --> 06:38.360
You don't fix it.

06:38.360 --> 06:40.000
You just you get more bandwidth.

06:40.000 --> 06:41.200
Uncle Tim needs his cut.

06:41.200 --> 06:42.200
Yeah, that's true.

06:42.200 --> 06:43.200
Right.

06:43.200 --> 06:45.040
You got to have you got to have those services staying in sync.

06:45.040 --> 06:48.200
Hans writes and he says, hey, guys, love the show.

06:48.200 --> 06:49.200
Keep on going.

06:49.200 --> 06:52.600
You recently touched on a blog post about Gnome's apparent delusional future.

06:52.600 --> 06:55.280
And well, honestly, I couldn't agree more with your analysis.

06:55.280 --> 06:57.320
I am a huge fan of Linux desktop.

06:57.320 --> 07:00.020
And because of that, I like the choice it offers.

07:00.020 --> 07:03.640
What I wonder is what you would recommend as a replacement for Gnome right now.

07:03.640 --> 07:07.320
I'm currently on XFCE and actually been thinking about going back to Gnome, but that doesn't

07:07.320 --> 07:09.040
seem like a viable option anymore.

07:09.040 --> 07:10.320
Is KDE really worth it?

07:10.320 --> 07:13.140
I never gave it much of a chance because it always kind of looked too similar to Windows

07:13.140 --> 07:14.140
to me.

07:14.140 --> 07:15.600
What about CineBit, Mate or Budgie?

07:15.600 --> 07:18.440
I'd be really curious to hear your thoughts on other desktop alternatives.

07:18.440 --> 07:22.840
And I just want to say thank you to Hans for writing in to give me a chance to once again

07:22.840 --> 07:26.720
talk about Plasma on the show so I can slowly chip away at Mike and eventually one day get

07:26.720 --> 07:27.720
him to try it.

07:27.720 --> 07:29.880
I just recommend Plasma a whole straight up.

07:29.880 --> 07:33.840
And yes, default, it will look like Windows, but that's actually clever, I think, because

07:33.840 --> 07:38.760
a lot of people can map their experiences with traditional desktop paradigms onto that

07:38.760 --> 07:40.280
Plasma setup.

07:40.280 --> 07:45.080
But the thing you'll learn about Plasma to almost to a fault is it is extremely customizable

07:45.080 --> 07:47.680
and you can make it look like Unity 7 if you want.

07:47.680 --> 07:51.160
You can make it look like XFCE if you want.

07:51.160 --> 07:55.640
And it's modularized so you can have components of it that will fail that don't take down

07:55.640 --> 07:57.400
the entire desktop stack.

07:57.400 --> 07:59.840
Their Wayland support is coming along really well.

07:59.840 --> 08:04.880
And the performance is now, I would bet you, although I can't guarantee it, but I would

08:04.880 --> 08:09.300
bet you there's a good chance it'll use less resources than XFCE does on your box.

08:09.300 --> 08:11.400
It's really, really light these days.

08:11.400 --> 08:13.560
Did I convince you?

08:13.560 --> 08:14.560
No.

08:14.560 --> 08:15.560
Okay.

08:15.560 --> 08:16.560
All right.

08:16.560 --> 08:20.760
So John writes in, hey guys, I've been a software engineer for about 11 years now and I've now

08:20.760 --> 08:23.360
transitioned into a manager.

08:23.360 --> 08:24.360
Hmm.

08:24.360 --> 08:25.360
Hmm.

08:25.360 --> 08:26.360
Yes.

08:26.360 --> 08:27.360
Hmm.

08:27.360 --> 08:28.360
Okay.

08:28.360 --> 08:30.780
Well, he's happy about it.

08:30.780 --> 08:31.780
So we'll go with that.

08:31.780 --> 08:36.720
He says, I work for a large company and while I know how to be a good developer, I'd like

08:36.720 --> 08:40.340
to hear your guys' thoughts on what makes a good manager of developers.

08:40.340 --> 08:44.960
It's my first time as a manager and I'm going to have to be in charge of a large group in

08:44.960 --> 08:46.080
multiple countries.

08:46.080 --> 08:49.440
I've read a lot of articles and posts, but I would appreciate to hear your collective

08:49.440 --> 08:50.440
perspectives on this.

08:50.440 --> 08:51.440
Keep up the great work.

08:51.440 --> 08:56.160
Sean, do you have any tips maybe you've derived from having bad managers that you would pass

08:56.160 --> 08:57.160
on to Sean?

08:57.160 --> 08:58.160
Yeah.

08:58.160 --> 09:04.380
I mean, I do a lot of management myself these days and I, it's tough because ultimately

09:04.380 --> 09:07.180
it comes down to when's this going to be done?

09:07.180 --> 09:08.180
What's the estimate?

09:08.180 --> 09:09.180
The estimate's always wrong.

09:09.180 --> 09:15.280
Like I feel like the manager problems, at least the way I do things, have always been

09:15.280 --> 09:17.800
on both sides.

09:17.800 --> 09:23.880
The developer problem of like estimation, but with an extra layer of being removed from

09:23.880 --> 09:26.160
the situation.

09:26.160 --> 09:29.720
So I even less visibility into the problem.

09:29.720 --> 09:31.280
I can give you one real case.

09:31.280 --> 09:32.280
Okay.

09:32.280 --> 09:35.980
When I was very, very young, I had a manager who used to literally his move was to count

09:35.980 --> 09:36.980
people's commits.

09:36.980 --> 09:37.980
Oh yeah.

09:37.980 --> 09:39.920
That's like another version of butts in seats almost.

09:39.920 --> 09:40.920
Yeah.

09:40.920 --> 09:42.260
It was really weird and like lines of code.

09:42.260 --> 09:46.520
It was really, that company did not last.

09:46.520 --> 09:47.520
Surprise.

09:47.520 --> 09:48.520
Surprise.

09:48.520 --> 09:53.540
I mean, I struggle with this myself, to be honest, because there's always the let the

09:53.540 --> 09:55.680
coders just code and be happy.

09:55.680 --> 09:57.880
And then there's the way you need process.

09:57.880 --> 10:04.000
And I'm constantly adjusting between more process or less process, right?

10:04.000 --> 10:12.720
Like at one point, we're super deep into Jira, Alassian Jira, and then that just became heavy.

10:12.720 --> 10:17.280
And right now we're kind of basically working in Trello, but already I'm starting to see

10:17.280 --> 10:22.380
things that I'm kind of missing from what I want in Trello, because the manager's job

10:22.380 --> 10:27.880
is ultimately to talk to the stakeholders, sorry, I said stakeholders, I have to vomit,

10:27.880 --> 10:33.400
and be like the middleman between the stakeholders and developers and make sure that expectations

10:33.400 --> 10:36.360
that are being set make sense and that they're met.

10:36.360 --> 10:37.360
Yes.

10:37.360 --> 10:38.360
Yeah.

10:38.360 --> 10:42.840
And also that things the stakeholders are asking for are actually developable, right?

10:42.840 --> 10:46.120
That isn't like, you know, build me a pony.

10:46.120 --> 10:50.520
I actually think accountability and expectations was the area I was going to hit on.

10:50.520 --> 10:52.880
So I think I totally agree with you.

10:52.880 --> 10:58.960
As a manager, I think you need to find a way to hold people accountable and also make expectations

10:58.960 --> 11:00.520
clear all the time.

11:00.520 --> 11:06.760
Like focus on accountability and expectations, but accountability is a tricky one because

11:06.760 --> 11:09.600
you don't want to be a dictator.

11:09.600 --> 11:16.060
You want to be the type of manager that can suss out when performance is lacking because

11:16.060 --> 11:20.400
somebody isn't trained up or doesn't know how to do something versus somebody is just

11:20.400 --> 11:22.600
being lazy and taking you from a ride.

11:22.600 --> 11:27.280
And you kind of have to have a different manager's hat for different situations in that regard.

11:27.280 --> 11:31.040
So keep flexibility in mind when holding people accountable.

11:31.040 --> 11:36.620
But if you don't, if you don't build that muscle, it will become harder and harder over

11:36.620 --> 11:41.120
time and you will build a culture of unaccountability.

11:41.120 --> 11:43.480
And that is going to spell disaster.

11:43.480 --> 11:48.160
Like Mike was just saying, you'll hear guys come up with systems that are just ridiculous

11:48.160 --> 11:53.800
to try to hold people accountable, like counting lines of code or commits.

11:53.800 --> 11:57.880
And you know, that that's obviously not going to work, but you could probably guess what

11:57.880 --> 11:59.360
that person was trying to get at, right?

11:59.360 --> 12:03.840
They were, they were trying to come up with some sort of process and system to hold people

12:03.840 --> 12:05.040
accountable.

12:05.040 --> 12:06.040
That's universal.

12:06.040 --> 12:10.640
And yeah, you can do that to some degree with project boards and, and sprints that have

12:10.640 --> 12:12.980
specific tasks and goals and key results.

12:12.980 --> 12:18.520
But I think the reality is a manager is always kind of being flexible and wears a slightly

12:18.520 --> 12:20.920
different manager hat for each person they work with.

12:20.920 --> 12:25.180
And that's why large teams can be very hard, very, very hard.

12:25.180 --> 12:31.240
And why you will need people who work with you to help message, to help check in your,

12:31.240 --> 12:37.240
you cannot do it all yourself in a worldwide large team in different time zones.

12:37.240 --> 12:38.760
There's a lot you can do.

12:38.760 --> 12:42.100
You could also consider, I hear something that's working really well for people that

12:42.100 --> 12:46.080
are managing groups in different time zones is moving your meetings to a more async style

12:46.080 --> 12:50.340
meeting where perhaps you're posting video updates to a channel.

12:50.340 --> 12:53.880
And instead of everybody sitting in a meeting or a standup because the time zone situation

12:53.880 --> 12:58.960
is so difficult, you come up with more interesting, clever ways to still have high touch communication,

12:58.960 --> 13:01.400
but in a way that doesn't bog people down with meetings.

13:01.400 --> 13:04.600
And as a manager, it's your opportunity to kind of come up with clever solutions for

13:04.600 --> 13:05.600
that.

13:05.600 --> 13:09.920
So focus on accountability with flexibility, focus on making sure that your communication

13:09.920 --> 13:12.720
strategy is clear and that you have a way to manage that many people and keep them all

13:12.720 --> 13:17.960
in sync across different time zones, perhaps async meeting styles instead of everybody

13:17.960 --> 13:21.920
getting on a zoom call, you do individual updates and that kind of stuff.

13:21.920 --> 13:25.360
And I think if you think in those terms, you're probably going to do all right.

13:25.360 --> 13:28.000
You're probably going to do better than most developer managers.

13:28.000 --> 13:31.300
And also I'll just say this too, is like, listen to your people.

13:31.300 --> 13:34.480
If you know they're pushing something or if they think there's a direction that project

13:34.480 --> 13:38.860
needs to go in, at least listen to them and have that conversation, Sean, because perhaps

13:38.860 --> 13:42.900
they know more about a particular thing than you do, because although you sound like you

13:42.900 --> 13:47.180
are a good developer, you've been doing it for 11 years, as time goes on, you're going

13:47.180 --> 13:53.400
to be removed from the day to day into just like problems that the developers are solving.

13:53.400 --> 13:56.280
You're going to be, as time goes on, more and more removed from that just naturally

13:56.280 --> 13:57.640
by not doing it.

13:57.640 --> 14:02.280
And there will be a point where perhaps you need to catch yourself and say, you know,

14:02.280 --> 14:05.680
I do know a lot about this, but maybe this individual, maybe she knows more about it

14:05.680 --> 14:06.680
and I need to listen to her.

14:06.680 --> 14:08.920
And you got to be that kind of manager as well.

14:08.920 --> 14:09.960
Not an easy job.

14:09.960 --> 14:13.600
Turns out it's a lot more work doing the management stuff or it's a different kind of work to

14:13.600 --> 14:14.600
right?

14:14.600 --> 14:18.480
Absolutely and that listening to other folks and but also, again, you can't listen to everybody,

14:18.480 --> 14:19.480
right?

14:19.480 --> 14:22.360
If you have a team of like five or six, you're going to have conflicting opinions and you

14:22.360 --> 14:26.880
have to find a way to resolve those, particularly about like dumb stuff like linters.

14:26.880 --> 14:28.160
It's always the dumb stuff.

14:28.160 --> 14:29.160
It's always the dumb stuff.

14:29.160 --> 14:30.160
Right.

14:30.160 --> 14:31.160
Words.

14:31.160 --> 14:32.160
You could just get two people who are...

14:32.160 --> 14:33.160
Colors.

14:33.160 --> 14:34.160
Yeah.

14:34.160 --> 14:35.160
Oh, my God.

14:35.160 --> 14:36.160
Yes.

14:36.160 --> 14:38.480
You could tell we've both dealt a lot with that.

14:38.480 --> 14:40.240
And that's where everybody always has the most input.

14:40.240 --> 14:44.360
And so it's super frustrating because you just get bogged down in the nuance of stuff

14:44.360 --> 14:47.560
that doesn't matter and it's just excruciating.

14:47.560 --> 14:49.840
And so you got to navigate that as a manager as well.

14:49.840 --> 14:50.840
Have fun, Sean.

14:50.840 --> 14:54.600
It's going to be a blast.

14:54.600 --> 14:55.600
Good luck.

14:55.600 --> 14:56.600
Yeah.

14:56.600 --> 14:57.600
Good luck with that.

14:57.600 --> 14:58.600
Hey, you know what?

14:58.600 --> 15:01.720
I just want to mention super quick meetup.com slash Jupiter broadcasting.

15:01.720 --> 15:02.920
It's this week.

15:02.920 --> 15:07.400
It's Friday the 20th in Denver at Pindustry.

15:07.400 --> 15:11.320
We are asking that you just kind of start trickling in after four o'clock at Pindustry.

15:11.320 --> 15:12.840
You'll find us there.

15:12.840 --> 15:13.840
Linode's going to be there.

15:13.840 --> 15:14.840
We're going to be giving away raspberry pies.

15:14.840 --> 15:18.720
They're going to be giving away a bunch of Linode credit and other stuff.

15:18.720 --> 15:20.520
Some friends from Linode will be there as well.

15:20.520 --> 15:22.960
Some friends from System76 will be there.

15:22.960 --> 15:25.960
A lot of the JB crew, but not all of the JB crew will be there.

15:25.960 --> 15:28.020
And we always get a lot of coder love at these meetups.

15:28.020 --> 15:33.520
So if you're a Coder Radio listener, you are 100% invited to Pindustry this Friday in Denver

15:33.520 --> 15:38.040
at 4 p.m. local time or start trickling in after that.

15:38.040 --> 15:39.040
This is it.

15:39.040 --> 15:42.800
This is the big meetup, the one that we've been on the road for, and it's almost here.

15:42.800 --> 15:46.800
It's very exciting, and we'd love to see it.

15:46.800 --> 15:48.600
Linode.com slash Coder.

15:48.600 --> 15:50.120
Yep, that's right.

15:50.120 --> 15:54.280
Linode sponsors this here podcast, and we enthusiastically use Linode for all of our

15:54.280 --> 15:55.280
hosting needs.

15:55.280 --> 15:59.080
You know, I've built everything on Linode over the last couple of years, and I have

15:59.080 --> 16:04.440
legitimately experienced like all the different options out there for hosting.

16:04.440 --> 16:06.560
I have tried all kinds of things.

16:06.560 --> 16:09.560
But what I like about Linode is the fundamentals.

16:09.560 --> 16:11.020
They have really good performance.

16:11.020 --> 16:12.240
They have a really good interface.

16:12.240 --> 16:15.160
They have a really clear, easy to understand API.

16:15.160 --> 16:17.920
And on top of that, they also have a dashboard that's, you know, that's great.

16:17.920 --> 16:18.920
Like their interface is great.

16:18.920 --> 16:22.940
But they have 11 data centers worldwide, and the connections between those data centers

16:22.940 --> 16:23.940
is super fast.

16:23.940 --> 16:27.080
So if you need multiple spots, you're covered there.

16:27.080 --> 16:30.360
And then Linode itself, as a company, their fundamentals check out as well.

16:30.360 --> 16:34.480
They are the largest independent cloud provider in the world, full stop.

16:34.480 --> 16:35.480
Right there.

16:35.480 --> 16:36.480
Right?

16:36.480 --> 16:37.480
They're independently owned.

16:37.480 --> 16:40.720
They're not backed by a VC that has some goal to dump on the market and then completely

16:40.720 --> 16:42.920
take over the space and jack the prices up.

16:42.920 --> 16:46.840
They've been doing this for 18 years, iterating on it, getting it better and better and better.

16:46.840 --> 16:50.200
And now they have millions of customers, well, at least a million.

16:50.200 --> 16:54.160
I actually haven't checked, but I think it's around a million customers and businesses

16:54.160 --> 16:55.160
around the globe.

16:55.160 --> 16:56.160
I mean, think about that.

16:56.160 --> 17:01.280
This is an independent company that started in cloud computing years before AWS was even,

17:01.280 --> 17:03.880
you know, a glimmer in Bezos's eye.

17:03.880 --> 17:08.260
And Linode has remained focused on providing great hosting since then.

17:08.260 --> 17:12.880
They make cloud computing simple, affordable and accessible to all 30 to 50% cheaper than

17:12.880 --> 17:15.000
the major cloud providers while being fast.

17:15.000 --> 17:18.440
And it's not just me saying that, although I've personally experienced how fast they

17:18.440 --> 17:19.440
are.

17:19.440 --> 17:22.520
They've actually been reviewed and tested against the other cloud providers.

17:22.520 --> 17:27.120
One of Linode's edges is they're using brand new AMD EPYC processors in their dedicated

17:27.120 --> 17:28.120
CPU rigs.

17:28.120 --> 17:32.080
They're using crazy fast SSDs and they are their own ISP.

17:32.080 --> 17:36.540
So it's like every part in the stack has been optimized and it all comes together to give

17:36.540 --> 17:37.920
Linode a performance edge.

17:37.920 --> 17:40.500
I love their S3 compatible object storage.

17:40.500 --> 17:44.920
Have you ever looked into how much software actually supports S3 storage and how much

17:44.920 --> 17:49.640
backup software and how you can do configuration management and all kinds of stuff with object

17:49.640 --> 17:50.640
storage?

17:50.640 --> 17:51.640
Well, they've got it in spades.

17:51.640 --> 17:53.320
I use it for my next cloud instance.

17:53.320 --> 17:55.640
I use it for all kinds of backend file sharing.

17:55.640 --> 17:56.640
It's great.

17:56.640 --> 18:01.680
They have cloud firewalls, VLAN support, a powerful DNS manager and one click application

18:01.680 --> 18:02.680
deployments.

18:02.680 --> 18:05.280
If that's more your thing, if you're not so much of a DIYer, they can cover you there

18:05.280 --> 18:07.080
too with their one click deployments.

18:07.080 --> 18:10.700
So there's an open source product called Minio that I've been using for years.

18:10.700 --> 18:15.800
It basically is, if you know, Doku, right, is an open source implementation of the Heroku

18:15.800 --> 18:16.800
API.

18:16.800 --> 18:21.400
Minio started out as an open source implementation of the S3 API.

18:21.400 --> 18:26.600
Now they have a whole ML thing, but they still support the old, they maintain it.

18:26.600 --> 18:28.440
But they have two sides to their business now.

18:28.440 --> 18:30.260
Originally it was just a FOSS project.

18:30.260 --> 18:35.120
Now there's like some, I don't know what they're doing with the commercial side, but for example,

18:35.120 --> 18:40.400
if you import, this is my real world case, the Ruby S3 gem, but you want to self-host

18:40.400 --> 18:45.880
your files, you just target the endpoint to your local server running Minio.

18:45.880 --> 18:49.520
And from that point on, you don't ever have to think about, and that server could be a

18:49.520 --> 18:53.320
Linode VPN, right, you don't ever have to think about that it's Minio.

18:53.320 --> 18:58.040
You just use all the S3 classes, all the S3 utilities in the S3 gem.

18:58.040 --> 19:01.560
Goes the same for the PIP package and Python and the Java jar and all that kind of stuff.

19:01.560 --> 19:03.120
So yeah, that's a great project too.

19:03.120 --> 19:05.080
It's interesting too to see them try to make it profitable.

19:05.080 --> 19:09.480
And of course Linode has been supporting the Linux community and this year program, making

19:09.480 --> 19:12.720
Coda radio possible and Jupiter Broadcasting's meetup as well.

19:12.720 --> 19:16.640
They're really, their commitment to the community genuinely does run deep.

19:16.640 --> 19:17.640
It's pretty great.

19:17.640 --> 19:20.560
They're also dedicated to offering the best in virtualized cloud computing, which probably

19:20.560 --> 19:21.760
matters a lot to you.

19:21.760 --> 19:24.440
If it runs on Linux, it's going to run great on the node.

19:24.440 --> 19:29.000
So sign up today, get $100 and 60 day credit on your new account and you support the show,

19:29.000 --> 19:32.440
make it possible for us to keep giving away free independent content.

19:32.440 --> 19:35.120
That's linode.com slash coder.

19:35.120 --> 19:39.200
Go there to get $100 and support the show, linode.com slash coder.

19:39.200 --> 19:43.200
All right, I'm attempting to kill processes.

19:43.200 --> 19:48.280
Wes Payne has sent me several launch CTL commands to attempt to stop this NSC URL session.

19:48.280 --> 19:49.720
It's still going like crazy though.

19:49.720 --> 19:55.240
Just crack open some POS files and just go to town.

19:55.240 --> 19:58.520
You know, I'm just, I'm kind of, I'm a little disappointed because we've been getting all

19:58.520 --> 19:59.520
these emails.

19:59.520 --> 20:00.520
They're like, Oh, Max, great workstation, blah, blah, blah.

20:00.520 --> 20:02.600
And it kind of, you know, I was like, okay, well I'll give it a go.

20:02.600 --> 20:04.400
The listeners seem to sure like it an awful lot.

20:04.400 --> 20:09.000
Maybe I, and here I am and I am just, I've thrown everything I can at this.

20:09.000 --> 20:14.520
Only 3.9 megabytes a second on an LTE connection behind the building that's just so frustrating.

20:14.520 --> 20:18.000
But let's talk about the stacked overflow developer survey because it's kind of become

20:18.000 --> 20:19.480
a tradition on this show.

20:19.480 --> 20:20.480
Yes.

20:20.480 --> 20:21.480
How about this one?

20:21.480 --> 20:23.040
Of course I had to start with this one.

20:23.040 --> 20:26.720
They surveyed the respondents for operating systems and you guys probably know this, but

20:26.720 --> 20:30.060
just as a recap, stack overflow does this every year.

20:30.060 --> 20:35.320
They say this year they observed a significant evolution in the way developers are educating

20:35.320 --> 20:36.680
themselves.

20:36.680 --> 20:42.480
They say the younger coders are using online resources like videos and blogs.

20:42.480 --> 20:47.960
In fact, they are more popular using videos and blogs is more popular than school and

20:47.960 --> 20:50.400
books combined now in younger developers.

20:50.400 --> 20:55.160
However, older developers, however that's defined more than 50% of them indicate they

20:55.160 --> 20:59.800
still, uh, or sorry, a lot of them indicate that they are still just using good old traditional

20:59.800 --> 21:02.040
books and traditional ways of learning.

21:02.040 --> 21:03.040
Yep.

21:03.040 --> 21:07.280
And 30% of the people that responded said they were new to coding less than a decade

21:07.280 --> 21:13.280
and 35% have less than five years in the trade, 35% of less than five years, a lot of new

21:13.280 --> 21:21.400
people and um, all respondents when they were asked said windows was the top OS at 45% Linux

21:21.400 --> 21:33.360
number two at 25.32 and Mac OS number three at 25.19 and then WSL at 3.29% interesting

21:33.360 --> 21:43.400
that WSL is broken out 3.29% for WSL and then BSD is at, is at 0.18%, 0.18 for BSD.

21:43.400 --> 21:46.580
Oh man, that's bad.

21:46.580 --> 21:51.440
That's sad when you flip the survey over though to professional developers.

21:51.440 --> 21:54.920
So not just all respondents, but those who identify as a professional developer, I don't

21:54.920 --> 21:56.920
even know what that means, but who knows?

21:56.920 --> 21:58.280
Windows is still in the lead.

21:58.280 --> 21:59.880
Mac OS now comes in at second.

21:59.880 --> 22:06.400
So it now has replaced Linux when you just focus on developers with a 30% indication

22:06.400 --> 22:13.960
and then Linux comes in now at third at 25% WSL three and BSD remains slightly better

22:13.960 --> 22:17.160
at 0.14% of people said they use BSD.

22:17.160 --> 22:21.840
When I saw this, my thinking was the people who are professional developers are more likely

22:21.840 --> 22:25.280
to be like the full time, you know, like, like me or, you know, just like people would

22:25.280 --> 22:26.760
do it as their day job.

22:26.760 --> 22:27.760
Right?

22:27.760 --> 22:28.760
Yeah.

22:28.760 --> 22:29.760
Yeah.

22:29.760 --> 22:33.200
I think that Apple like joint venture stuff and the business support stuff, it's probably

22:33.200 --> 22:38.160
kind of a lot of places it's like you can get the Dell or you can get the Mac book,

22:38.160 --> 22:41.880
right with, in terms of the corporate it, you know, your standard issue.

22:41.880 --> 22:47.040
It could be, if you were looking to at this survey for programming and scripting and markup

22:47.040 --> 22:50.760
languages, I don't know, this might've hurt you because objective C is damn near bottom

22:50.760 --> 22:56.440
of the list of ones people love 73% of respondents said they dreaded using objective C and a

22:56.440 --> 23:01.160
hundred percent of those people have bad taste.

23:01.160 --> 23:06.080
C plus plus is smack dab in the middle, 50% love it, 50% hate it.

23:06.080 --> 23:08.920
Java leans a little bit more towards the hate side.

23:08.920 --> 23:11.880
Well, hmm. Yeah.

23:11.880 --> 23:16.600
Can you guess what's at the top of the list that people just love by a huge margin?

23:16.600 --> 23:17.720
I didn't do my homework.

23:17.720 --> 23:18.720
Is it rust?

23:18.720 --> 23:20.240
How did you guess?

23:20.240 --> 23:21.240
That's right.

23:21.240 --> 23:28.120
Well, it was either rust or Python, so.

23:28.120 --> 23:29.120
People love rust.

23:29.120 --> 23:30.120
I just.

23:30.120 --> 23:31.120
They love rust.

23:31.120 --> 23:32.120
They really do.

23:32.120 --> 23:34.520
They just love it so much.

23:34.520 --> 23:38.340
They love a compiler that kicks you squarely in the balls.

23:38.340 --> 23:41.600
And Westpain will be happy to see that Clojure comes in at number two.

23:41.600 --> 23:42.600
So.

23:42.600 --> 23:43.600
Oh dear Lord.

23:43.600 --> 23:46.340
I thank God we're not doing those challenges anymore.

23:46.340 --> 23:48.720
Now this is also not just programming languages, right?

23:48.720 --> 23:50.740
So TypeScript's on here.

23:50.740 --> 23:55.680
So yeah, you know, I mean, yeah, I mean, yeah, I mean, it's kind of, it's a toy language.

23:55.680 --> 23:56.680
Let's be honest.

23:56.680 --> 23:57.680
I'm just kidding.

23:57.680 --> 24:03.540
I just feel like now I'm trying to get people to email it, you know, cause if they don't

24:03.540 --> 24:05.320
write in, I'm like, all right, fine.

24:05.320 --> 24:09.600
I'm going to, I'm going to, I'm going to poke you in the side until you write into the show.

24:09.600 --> 24:16.080
AWS was the number one loved platform followed by Google.

24:16.080 --> 24:20.280
Actually Google ties it up pretty much with Azure and DigitalOcean, Heroku's on there,

24:20.280 --> 24:22.680
Oracle's on there.

24:22.680 --> 24:23.680
Look at all that.

24:23.680 --> 24:24.680
Wow, man.

24:24.680 --> 24:26.320
A lot of stuff in there, but there you have it.

24:26.320 --> 24:28.600
That's the new, that's the new developer survey.

24:28.600 --> 24:32.960
I guess I was a little surprised to see Linux as high as it was in a way, especially on

24:32.960 --> 24:35.880
the, on the all people respondents, on the all respondents.

24:35.880 --> 24:36.880
Linux beat the Mac.

24:36.880 --> 24:40.400
Well, this has been the trend for a couple of years now though, right?

24:40.400 --> 24:42.260
Where Linux has been gaining share.

24:42.260 --> 24:46.200
It just feels like if you, if you look at the emails we've gotten after the M1 announcement,

24:46.200 --> 24:49.900
it felt like that, that trend was going to start sliding in the other direction.

24:49.900 --> 24:54.920
I would like to see this and even the emails we get broken down by age because I have a

24:54.920 --> 24:59.880
feeling your theory from last week is right that people who, you know, become moms or

24:59.880 --> 25:04.760
dads at a certain age, just like run out of patience with some of the more finicky Linuxy

25:04.760 --> 25:07.520
stuff and end up on the Mac.

25:07.520 --> 25:10.520
Having said that, most of my guys use Papa Westal and it's fine.

25:10.520 --> 25:12.520
In fact, I just ordered someone a Gazelle.

25:12.520 --> 25:13.520
Oh, nice.

25:13.520 --> 25:15.200
Do you want me to walk in there and grab it for you?

25:15.200 --> 25:16.200
I'm right here.

25:16.200 --> 25:17.200
It shipped.

25:17.200 --> 25:20.360
I was going to ask you to actually, it already shipped though.

25:20.360 --> 25:22.320
I'll grab you another launch instead.

25:22.320 --> 25:24.360
Yeah, there is that.

25:24.360 --> 25:26.760
I've definitely gotten that.

25:26.760 --> 25:30.720
So we've done the Salt Lake City meetup and we've had four micro meetups where it's just

25:30.720 --> 25:38.780
like a small group of people and universally it's like people are shifting some opinion

25:38.780 --> 25:39.780
on this.

25:39.780 --> 25:42.140
Not everybody is like switched or anything like that, but there's definitely some opinions

25:42.140 --> 25:48.120
that are shifting and it does seem to be not to, not to like put too fine of a point on

25:48.120 --> 25:54.640
it, but kind of seems like it's people that are near or at their or over their forties.

25:54.640 --> 26:00.280
They've got some kids, they've been working for a little while, a $1,300 laptop isn't

26:00.280 --> 26:04.960
going to make or break them and they kind of just throw their hands up and that's definitely

26:04.960 --> 26:11.240
been not a hundred percent, but it's been really common to see that on this road trip

26:11.240 --> 26:13.040
for better or for worse.

26:13.040 --> 26:14.200
Not everybody though.

26:14.200 --> 26:18.640
So it's been a range of people that I've talked to and I'm kind of like I'm coming up with

26:18.640 --> 26:22.440
a series of questions I'm asking people as these meetups go on to kind of get the information

26:22.440 --> 26:26.600
out of like, well, what went wrong, when did you switch, why did you do it, you know, I'm

26:26.600 --> 26:27.600
just asking.

26:27.600 --> 26:31.520
It's really kind of all anecdotal, but I'll probably get 20, 30 responses from people

26:31.520 --> 26:33.000
overall by the end of this trip.

26:33.000 --> 26:35.800
So I'm starting to change my perspective on it.

26:35.800 --> 26:40.160
And you know, the truth of the matter is the way I'm looking at it right now is this Mac

26:40.160 --> 26:44.200
seems more finicky and it seems like more hassle than a Linux box because this Linux

26:44.200 --> 26:49.440
box, so before it was downloading, now it is uploading.

26:49.440 --> 26:53.300
And I don't know what NSURLSessionD is uploading, but it's uploading two megs a second, which

26:53.300 --> 26:56.160
is about all I have again.

26:56.160 --> 26:59.480
And I'm trying to do a live show, right?

26:59.480 --> 27:00.480
It's so frustrating.

27:00.480 --> 27:04.800
Do you have like a Charles proxy or like a, I think it's like Netcat or something to like

27:04.800 --> 27:07.000
see what exactly it's doing.

27:07.000 --> 27:12.340
Well, I did go into activity monitor and I opened up the process and I looked at the

27:12.340 --> 27:16.960
open files in the process and it doesn't really tell me anything.

27:16.960 --> 27:18.920
Like I see logs in here.

27:18.920 --> 27:26.920
I see analytics.whitelist in here and I see some HTTPS connections from my host to probably

27:26.920 --> 27:29.520
some iCloud server, just the IP address.

27:29.520 --> 27:31.460
This is why Snow Leopard was better.

27:31.460 --> 27:33.060
This is a disqualifier for me.

27:33.060 --> 27:35.760
Is it the first time you've used it in a while?

27:35.760 --> 27:40.880
No, I mean, no, I've used it on, I've been using it on this road trip and you know, so

27:40.880 --> 27:42.240
it was just a couple, a couple of days ago.

27:42.240 --> 27:43.240
When did I do LAN?

27:43.240 --> 27:44.240
Yesterday.

27:44.240 --> 27:45.240
I did LAN yesterday.

27:45.240 --> 27:46.240
That's weird.

27:46.240 --> 27:47.240
Okay.

27:47.240 --> 27:48.240
Yeah.

27:48.240 --> 27:49.240
That's a disqualifier for me.

27:49.240 --> 27:50.240
I think it disqualifies.

27:50.240 --> 27:51.240
I mean, I'm not sure.

27:51.240 --> 27:55.560
I'm going to see if I can figure out how to, how, if I can tame this NSURL session D beast,

27:55.560 --> 27:56.560
then it's not.

27:56.560 --> 28:00.280
But having something take up this much bandwidth when you're on the road is, ooh boy, I should

28:00.280 --> 28:04.160
stop bitching about it, but it's, it's just like so quintessentially like an example of

28:04.160 --> 28:06.040
how the Mac is not fully under your control.

28:06.040 --> 28:07.040
Bitch away.

28:07.040 --> 28:11.360
That's what the advertisers pay for.

28:11.360 --> 28:13.420
Datadog.com slash Coder Radio.

28:13.420 --> 28:17.320
This episode of Coder Radio is sponsored by Datadog, the monitoring and security platform

28:17.320 --> 28:21.200

faster and break down silos between your teams, create real time, beautiful dashboards for

28:33.100 --> 28:38.440
over 450 technologies in just minutes and easily pivot from high level overview of your

28:38.440 --> 28:43.480
environment to a granular visualization of the metrics and events.

28:43.480 --> 28:48.040
Datadog offers infrastructure monitoring, APM, security monitoring, real user monitoring

28:48.040 --> 28:50.800
and more all in one place.

28:50.800 --> 28:51.800

29:03.040 --> 29:06.520
Also if you start a free trial and you create one dashboard, Datadog is going to give you

29:06.520 --> 29:07.520
a free t-shirt.

29:07.520 --> 29:11.120
I don't know about you, but I could always use another t-shirt, especially cause I always

29:11.120 --> 29:16.080
spill stuff on myself and free t-shirts help with that pain.

29:16.080 --> 29:20.520
So go over to datadog.com slash Coder Radio, sign up, create a free trial, create a dashboard,

29:20.520 --> 29:26.200
get a t-shirt, support the show and see how it's so nice to bring everything into one

29:26.200 --> 29:31.640
place, communicate across teams, visualize problems faster than ever and plug it into

29:31.640 --> 29:41.360
over 450 different pieces of technology you likely already own.

29:41.360 --> 29:44.600
I really liked this tweet by Steven Trotten-Smith.

29:44.600 --> 29:47.000
He's a developer on the Apple platform.

29:47.000 --> 29:48.080
He's created some pretty good apps.

29:48.080 --> 29:52.040
One that I like a lot is called, I think it's called Broadcast or Broadcaster and it's just

29:52.040 --> 29:57.480
a nice, clean, simple internet radio streaming app for the iPhone that does some smart buffering

29:57.480 --> 29:59.200
and yeah, you might want to check it out.

29:59.200 --> 30:04.680
So Steven Trotten-Smith on Twitter said, quote, the Mac is in the best place it has ever been.

30:04.680 --> 30:10.200
Fresh off a CPU transition, a new design language, beautiful new hardware with two brand new

30:10.200 --> 30:15.000
UI frameworks, universal apps and a popular new programming language.

30:15.000 --> 30:20.680
If that's not enough to convince developers to make native apps, what is?

30:20.680 --> 30:21.680
And I thought about it for a second.

30:21.680 --> 30:23.760
I thought, damn, I think he's right.

30:23.760 --> 30:33.000
Like are we seeing the last great push for native apps with new hardware, new design,

30:33.000 --> 30:36.200
you know, the new design and what is a Big Sur, I can't remember, whatever the new UI

30:36.200 --> 30:37.560
they did.

30:37.560 --> 30:40.240
And of course, Swift getting more popular than ever.

30:40.240 --> 30:43.560
They have the two UI frameworks to make it easy if you're already developing for iOS

30:43.560 --> 30:46.280
to bring your applications to the Mac.

30:46.280 --> 30:47.280
And they're all native.

30:47.280 --> 30:48.280
They're all native.

30:48.280 --> 30:53.160
Do you think Apple has lined everything up to actually convince developers to start focusing

30:53.160 --> 30:55.520
on native apps and give up on things like Electron?

30:55.520 --> 30:56.520
No, it doesn't make sense.

30:56.520 --> 31:02.760
I mean, if you're like a small indie, yeah, you know, the Mac market's surely big enough

31:02.760 --> 31:09.500
to make very beautiful, very kind of polished native applications using Apple's latest frameworks,

31:09.500 --> 31:11.520
you know, kind of running on the treadmill, right?

31:11.520 --> 31:14.120
We've talked about that for years, more in the context of iOS.

31:14.120 --> 31:15.120
Right.

31:15.120 --> 31:18.820
And well, and I think to be fair to them, they have lined this up better than Microsoft,

31:18.820 --> 31:21.440
which is traditionally very good at this kind of stuff.

31:21.440 --> 31:25.320
But when you bring it all together, I think Apple has lined it up better than any other

31:25.320 --> 31:26.320
platform.

31:26.320 --> 31:28.240
And I could even see that sort of leading the way.

31:28.240 --> 31:31.840
Other platform providers like Google and Microsoft looking at that going, let's start building

31:31.840 --> 31:32.840
our own chips.

31:32.840 --> 31:36.640
Let's start shoring this up and making this a good experience for native developers.

31:36.640 --> 31:40.780
I mean, there's an easy Swift dig here, but I'm not going to make it.

31:40.780 --> 31:45.000
I would have a hard time pitching to someone to a business that they should do a native

31:45.000 --> 31:46.000
Mac.

31:46.000 --> 31:51.140
I'd even have a hard time pitching they should do a native iOS app, although on the iPad

31:51.140 --> 31:54.720
now that things are somewhat loosened up, which I think we should talk about more in

31:54.720 --> 32:01.480
a couple of weeks, there is definitely more opportunity.

32:01.480 --> 32:02.480
I don't buy it.

32:02.480 --> 32:05.120
I mean, I want to buy it.

32:05.120 --> 32:06.600
That's why I keep hemming and hawing here.

32:06.600 --> 32:13.320
But yeah, the reality is for most businesses, maintaining native applications is a huge

32:13.320 --> 32:14.760
pain in the ass.

32:14.760 --> 32:19.160
You're almost better off with a PWA or some sort of web based solution.

32:19.160 --> 32:24.900
You know, whether that be a flask or a fast API app returning Jinja, the templating engine

32:24.900 --> 32:28.920
for Python, or just straight up Rails with ERB.

32:28.920 --> 32:32.920
That way you have one thing to update, one thing to maintain, and you don't have these

32:32.920 --> 32:33.920
problems.

32:33.920 --> 32:37.880
And frankly, the PWA capabilities, especially if we're talking about desktop here, where

32:37.880 --> 32:42.640
you don't have Apple's crazy restrictions on iOS Safari, although I did just hit a bug

32:42.640 --> 32:46.440
on Safari for Mac I tweeted about, if you can follow me if you want to see my bitching

32:46.440 --> 32:51.640
about how Apple decided to not cooperate where every other browser does.

32:51.640 --> 32:55.780
I mean, I don't know, and I'm a guy who used to sell Mac applications, right?

32:55.780 --> 32:57.880
So like, I want this to be true.

32:57.880 --> 33:00.640
I think it is true.

33:00.640 --> 33:08.640
I just don't know that, at least in the enterprise space, which is mostly where I live now, it

33:08.640 --> 33:14.120
would ever again, make sense for me to sell someone a native Mac application as like a

33:14.120 --> 33:15.960
custom development job.

33:15.960 --> 33:20.640
And after I asked you the question, I started thinking too, like, it seems like the mobile

33:20.640 --> 33:22.580
industry is just too large.

33:22.580 --> 33:25.200
Mobile users are the number one target.

33:25.200 --> 33:29.080
Oh, yeah, dude, on mobile Xcode file new project, right?

33:29.080 --> 33:30.080
All day long.

33:30.080 --> 33:31.080
Yeah.

33:31.080 --> 33:33.520
It's always going to make the desktop kind of like a second class target, I think.

33:33.520 --> 33:39.280
I think it's just the size of the desktop market has been eclipsed by a juicier, larger

33:39.280 --> 33:40.280
market.

33:40.280 --> 33:43.580
And I think that's just where the native apps are going to be now.

33:43.580 --> 33:45.960
When you have a native app, it's going to be in an app store.

33:45.960 --> 33:49.040
And when you're downloading apps and you're loading them on your PC, on your freeloading

33:49.040 --> 33:55.040
PC with no app store, or the app store you're not using, it's going to be like a web app

33:55.040 --> 33:56.040
for a lot of them.

33:56.040 --> 33:57.040
Yeah.

33:57.040 --> 34:00.620
And I remember like my old app for Mac Code Journal.

34:00.620 --> 34:04.360
One of the things I was completely unprepared for, but ended up being true was people wanting

34:04.360 --> 34:07.520
to buy site licenses for it.

34:07.520 --> 34:12.360
And this is back when the Mac App Store just had come out and did not support anything

34:12.360 --> 34:15.240
close to an organization account.

34:15.240 --> 34:16.240
I don't know.

34:16.240 --> 34:17.240
I mean, maybe I'm wrong.

34:17.240 --> 34:18.240
I'm sure I am wrong.

34:18.240 --> 34:19.600
Obviously, game developers exist.

34:19.600 --> 34:23.120
And I feel like when we say app, we're not talking about games.

34:23.120 --> 34:28.520
But to me, the kind of, quote, productivity or developer tools software market is really

34:28.520 --> 34:32.600
a B2B game, an enterprise sales game.

34:32.600 --> 34:33.600
Yeah.

34:33.600 --> 34:36.480
And like Aveth points out in the chat room, most users don't even know when it's not a

34:36.480 --> 34:37.480
native app.

34:37.480 --> 34:39.980
So that's a factor as well.

34:39.980 --> 34:43.960
And I don't know if you've heard about what one password just did recently, but they just

34:43.960 --> 34:49.540
released one password version eight and the Mac users are revolting because it's now it's

34:49.540 --> 34:53.280
gone from a native app and it is now an electron app.

34:53.280 --> 34:56.000
But then don't worry, it's got a rust back end.

34:56.000 --> 35:01.560
So the rust back end is native, but the user front end is electron.

35:01.560 --> 35:04.040
And some users, you know, they don't care, right, obviously.

35:04.040 --> 35:06.900
But there are a lot of Mac users who are like, well, screw this.

35:06.900 --> 35:08.280
You just took away my pretty native app.

35:08.280 --> 35:09.960
Well, but that makes a ton of sense, right?

35:09.960 --> 35:16.120
Like we're doing C++ back ends with effectively JavaScript front ends.

35:16.120 --> 35:20.640
And you know, for for one password and Microsoft is going to go this way with Office eventually

35:20.640 --> 35:21.640
too.

35:21.640 --> 35:26.680
But with one with one password, it means they now have a Linux version and a Windows version

35:26.680 --> 35:28.980
and a Mac version that's all going to be in sync.

35:28.980 --> 35:31.600
And I guess it doesn't matter that it's going to lose some users.

35:31.600 --> 35:35.120
Some users will quit over this, but I bet long term they're not because where are they

35:35.120 --> 35:36.120
going to go?

35:36.120 --> 35:39.280
I guess they're using Safari as their browser.

35:39.280 --> 35:41.920
Most of the other password managers aren't very good.

35:41.920 --> 35:44.160
I like LastPass, but all right.

35:44.160 --> 35:45.160
I liked Lice.

35:45.160 --> 35:49.160
I switched just about, you know, I don't know, a year or two, I can't remember now, from

35:49.160 --> 35:50.160
LastPass.

35:50.160 --> 35:51.540
And I've been really happy with Bitwarden.

35:51.540 --> 35:55.640
If if anybody wants to give Bitwarden a try, they've got it's open source, but they do

35:55.640 --> 35:58.920
have a premium version if you want to host on their servers and stuff.

35:58.920 --> 36:01.100
And I've liked Bitwarden a lot.

36:01.100 --> 36:05.760
And so if people are looking for an alternative that, you know, is reasonable and seems to

36:05.760 --> 36:08.800
have a good team behind it, I would recommend Bitwarden.

36:08.800 --> 36:13.000
LastPass is not bad, too, but they've recently changed to some crazy scheme where you got

36:13.000 --> 36:17.460
to pay a certain rate to be able to open up your password database on a desktop or a mobile.

36:17.460 --> 36:20.740
And if you don't pay, you can only open it on mobile or you can only open on a desktop.

36:20.740 --> 36:22.480
It depends which one you open it on first.

36:22.480 --> 36:23.480
Like what?

36:23.480 --> 36:24.480
Okay.

36:24.480 --> 36:25.480
That's not confusing.

36:25.480 --> 36:29.200
I don't even want to tell you the stupid thing that I do, but I use iCloud everywhere.

36:29.200 --> 36:31.000
Well, I mean, it works.

36:31.000 --> 36:32.000
You know, it's simple.

36:32.000 --> 36:33.000
It's built into the system.

36:33.000 --> 36:38.320
And most of the stuff I need those passwords for, one, I've aggressively moved to 2FA

36:38.320 --> 36:39.440
for everything.

36:39.440 --> 36:42.520
So that kind of changes, you know.

36:42.520 --> 36:47.040
I mean, the nice thing about having the iCloud password is that it's, you know, it's also

36:47.040 --> 36:51.040
then it works with your fingerprint and your face ID stuff so you can authorize the password

36:51.040 --> 36:52.760
filling with your fingerprint.

36:52.760 --> 36:53.760
That's nice, actually.

36:53.760 --> 36:54.760
Right.

36:54.760 --> 36:55.760
Or the cops can just flash your phone at you.

36:55.760 --> 36:56.760
Yeah, it's really good.

36:56.760 --> 37:01.160
I want to know why you're getting picked up by the cops and they need your passwords in

37:01.160 --> 37:02.160
the first place.

37:02.160 --> 37:03.160
What's going on over there?

37:03.160 --> 37:04.160
Florida, man.

37:04.160 --> 37:08.920
I sold them a Mac desktop app about five years ago and it doesn't work and they're mad.

37:08.920 --> 37:10.720
So, see, full circle.

37:10.720 --> 37:11.720
Oh, yeah.

37:11.720 --> 37:12.720
Okay.

37:12.720 --> 37:13.720
Yeah, there you go.

37:13.720 --> 37:16.560
Hey, I want to say thank you to our QA members, Coder QA at CoderQA.co.

37:16.560 --> 37:19.520
You have a Coderly that's been posted for this quarter.

37:19.520 --> 37:20.520
Go there to join up.

37:20.520 --> 37:23.760
You can get past Coderlys if you haven't yet, but it's really about supporting the show.

37:23.760 --> 37:26.680
You get a limited ad feed as a thank you.

37:26.680 --> 37:30.760
And you get to listen to Mike and I go on about stuff that's sort of like higher level

37:30.760 --> 37:33.360
recap stuff in the quarter reports.

37:33.360 --> 37:35.360
That's a CoderQA.co.

37:35.360 --> 37:38.080
Mr. Dominic, is there anywhere you want to send people this week?

37:38.080 --> 37:41.080
Go at Dumanuco on Twitter and we have a bunch.

37:41.080 --> 37:47.880
We have two job openings at the Mad Botter right now, a junior Python developer and a

37:47.880 --> 37:52.560
entry level QA engineer, but we're looking for someone who at least is somewhat familiar

37:52.560 --> 37:53.560
with Python.

37:53.560 --> 37:55.600
If you can't tell, we do a lot of Python.

37:55.600 --> 37:56.640
There you go.

37:56.640 --> 37:57.640
And where do they find that?

37:57.640 --> 38:00.920
I think this is a procurer slash the Mad Botter Inc.

38:00.920 --> 38:01.920
Okay.

38:01.920 --> 38:02.920
There you go.

38:02.920 --> 38:04.200
Well, you can find me on Twitter.

38:04.200 --> 38:05.200
I'm at Chris Ellis.

38:05.200 --> 38:09.840
The network is at Jupiter Signal and this here podcast, yes, it does have a Twitter

38:09.840 --> 38:14.080
handle which could be useful for like time changes or announcements, anything like that.

38:14.080 --> 38:16.360
That's at Coder Radio Show.

38:16.360 --> 38:20.360
And yeah, everything we talked about today and links and all that, that's at Coder.show

38:20.360 --> 38:22.080
slash 427.

38:22.080 --> 38:25.680
You're also going to find our contact form over there, our subscribe link and all that

38:25.680 --> 38:27.960
stuff if you want to listen to every episode.

38:27.960 --> 38:29.600
You can also join us live.

38:29.600 --> 38:34.840
We do this here show at 10 a.m. Pacific, what is that, 1 Eastern?

I don't know because I'm traveling, but you can get it all at JupiterBroadcasting.com

38:37.720 --> 38:38.720
slash calendar.

38:38.720 --> 38:40.520
We convert it to your local time right there.

38:40.520 --> 38:41.520
That's easy.

38:41.520 --> 38:42.520
You know, I'm robots.

38:42.520 --> 38:47.640
Thanks so much for joining us on this week's episode of the Coder Radio program and we'll

38:47.640 --> 38:57.680
see you right back here next week.
