00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
This is KOTOR Radio, episode 483 for September 14th, 2022.

00:15.000 --> 00:19.000
Hey there, good buddy. Welcome back to Jupiter Broadcasting's weekly talk show.

00:19.000 --> 00:25.000
Taking a pragmatic look at the art and the business of software development and the world of technology.

00:25.000 --> 00:29.000
And joining me like the damn pro he is, it's our host, Mr. Dominic.

00:29.000 --> 00:31.000
Hello, Mike. How are you feeling?

00:31.000 --> 00:33.000
Hey, hey, hey. I'm here. How are you?

00:33.000 --> 00:43.000
I'm here. You know, I feel like I didn't sleep last night, but I feel like I also shouldn't complain since I'm not sick either.

00:43.000 --> 00:45.000
At least not yet. I could be going that direction though.

00:45.000 --> 00:50.000
Oh man. It's, you know what, kids. Kids and cons.

00:50.000 --> 01:01.000
Yeah, I kind of, unfortunately, know I think more people that are sick right now with COVID-like symptoms than when we did the lockdowns back in 2019.

01:01.000 --> 01:10.000
There are several members of the JB team that are sick right now. I've got a neighbor who's sick right now. I've got friends that are sick.

01:10.000 --> 01:14.000
It's just a lot of people are getting it because the kids are going back into the schools, you know?

01:14.000 --> 01:16.000
Yes, wonderful children.

01:16.000 --> 01:29.000
I feel like somebody should do a podcast out there that is really just focuses on how to be productive and have offspring or like how to be productive and have a big, you know, a time consuming hobby.

01:29.000 --> 01:34.000
Like how to be productive and not let it consume your life. You know, just like there's a whole series out there.

01:34.000 --> 01:38.000
If anybody has pro tips, they should start a podcast and send us a link.

01:38.000 --> 01:44.000
All right. Let's get into the feedback this week. We are recording on a Wednesday, which is unusual for us.

01:44.000 --> 01:49.000
A lot's going on this week, but we're going to start with Dan.

01:49.000 --> 01:51.000
Dan says.

01:51.000 --> 01:57.000
You might as well forget your dreams of Windows on top of a Linux kernel. It is impossible.

01:57.000 --> 02:05.000
Hi, Chris and Mike, I've been listening to episode 481 and I heard the suggestion from Dave Jones that Windows should switch to the Linux kernel.

02:05.000 --> 02:14.000
In my humble opinion, that's never going to happen due to extremely tight connections between the Windows user space and the kernel space in the Windows API.

02:14.000 --> 02:23.000
For instance, Windows kernel drivers are launched as a service, essentially like a daemon on Linux, where you pass the same parameters to the service with the driver's main entry point.

02:23.000 --> 02:30.000
It expects that all of this follows the extremely strict Windows API and ABI stability guarantees.

02:30.000 --> 02:32.000
Microsoft never depreciates anything.

02:32.000 --> 02:37.000
It's a humongous API, tens of thousands of functions.

02:37.000 --> 02:44.000
But the upside is, if you wrote something in the 90s with the documented API, you could probably still try to run it and it may actually work.

02:44.000 --> 02:47.000
Just try that on Linux. The downside is obvious, though.

02:47.000 --> 02:56.000
Any iteration of Windows must stay compatible with the old APIs, building a compatibility layer for all user space calls is challenging by itself.

02:56.000 --> 03:01.000
Wine is slowly getting there, but the real problem is the Linux kernel.

03:01.000 --> 03:04.000
There's no stable kernel internal API or ABI.

03:04.000 --> 03:13.000
But there is one for Windows and Windows driver vendors expect that because they just want to throw it in there and they don't want to mess with the API changes or breakage.

03:13.000 --> 03:16.000
They don't want to do code reviews from pesky nagging kernel developers.

03:16.000 --> 03:27.000
The bottom line is, in my opinion, Windows switching to Linux kernel is an idealistic dream that is impossible due to the Windows guaranteeing of API and ABI stability for decades.

03:27.000 --> 03:29.000
But keep up the great show.

03:29.000 --> 03:33.000
Also, he's wondering if Mike has any recommendations for getting into MTG.

03:33.000 --> 03:37.000
Do you agree with this take that it's impossible for this kind of thing to happen?

03:37.000 --> 03:39.000
Because I feel like you could have made this argument.

03:39.000 --> 03:42.000
It's impossible to ever have native Linux running on Windows.

03:42.000 --> 03:45.000
But Microsoft made a compatibility layer that makes that work.

03:45.000 --> 03:48.000
Yeah, I think the word impossible is kind of problematic.

03:48.000 --> 03:52.000
Is it very hard and inconvenient and maybe not super practical?

03:52.000 --> 03:54.000
He makes a very good argument for that.

03:54.000 --> 03:57.000
Is it worth the engineering effort? Probably never.

03:57.000 --> 04:00.000
With infinite devs and infinite money, you can basically do anything, right?

04:00.000 --> 04:02.000
But the point is well taken.

04:02.000 --> 04:05.000
I mean, yeah, so I agree then.

04:05.000 --> 04:06.000
I doubt it will happen.

04:06.000 --> 04:09.000
I wouldn't say it's impossible, but it seems unlikely.

04:09.000 --> 04:13.000
Into getting into MTG, boy, do I have tips.

04:13.000 --> 04:24.000
So I'm assuming you mean Paper MTG, not Arena, which is the digital game, which runs fine on Lutris, by the way, for our Linux-loving folks.

04:24.000 --> 04:25.000
Oh, good.

04:25.000 --> 04:30.000
I recommend, and this is kind of a situation dependent on your location, finding your local game store,

04:30.000 --> 04:37.000
seeing if they have like a casual night of either a commander or draft, and just go on over.

04:37.000 --> 04:39.000
Most of the community is pretty friendly.

04:39.000 --> 04:44.000
It is very much like the Linux community, except they won't mention packaging.

04:44.000 --> 04:49.000
Although they will mention deck sleeves and boxes a lot, which is, I guess, a form of goddammit, it's all packaging.

04:49.000 --> 04:53.000
Yes! You can never escape it.

04:53.000 --> 04:55.000
There's the equivalent of the Arch user over there, too.

04:55.000 --> 04:58.000
It's like, oh, I was running this, you know, 10 years ago.

04:58.000 --> 04:59.000
Oh, of course.

04:59.000 --> 05:02.000
Yeah, you know, it's in his AUR.

05:02.000 --> 05:03.000
What is it?

05:03.000 --> 05:05.000
Yeah, the AUR, Arch User Repository.

05:05.000 --> 05:07.000
Oh, my Lord.

05:07.000 --> 05:12.000
Yeah, I would go down to an LGS, preferably on a casual night.

05:12.000 --> 05:17.000
People can get a little salty on like the ranked tournaments if you don't know what you're doing.

05:17.000 --> 05:21.000
Another good way to learn just like the mechanics of the game.

05:21.000 --> 05:26.000
Arena is basically free if you want it to be.

05:26.000 --> 05:32.000
And if you want to spend a little bit of money, like 20 bucks, you can go again to that LGS, buy it.

05:32.000 --> 05:41.000
I think they call it the Arena Starter Kit, which is two kind of easy-to-play decks that come with a code for Arena that give you those cards as well.

05:41.000 --> 05:43.000
Other than that, have fun, right?

05:43.000 --> 05:47.000
I mean, I'm assuming you're not looking to go like, you know, RCQ or Pro Tour it up.

05:47.000 --> 05:49.000
Just go to something casual.

05:49.000 --> 05:52.000
One last tip, definitely buy sleeves.

05:52.000 --> 05:55.000
As always, packaging is all we talk about on the show.

05:55.000 --> 06:01.000
And people do like to have them soda while they play and people just, I don't get it.

06:01.000 --> 06:03.000
Sugar and cardboard, it's just not a good combination.

06:03.000 --> 06:05.000
It's like laptops and beverages.

06:05.000 --> 06:06.000
They don't go well together.

06:06.000 --> 06:08.000
Hendrix gin is amazing for a Mac.

06:08.000 --> 06:11.000
Yeah, you got to make sure it's the good gin.

06:11.000 --> 06:15.000
Yeah, you don't want to pour like anything out of a plastic bottle is just insulting.

06:15.000 --> 06:19.000
By the way, I'm on my dev one while its body may be plastic, I think.

06:19.000 --> 06:20.000
Or magnesium.

06:20.000 --> 06:21.000
Yeah, magnesium, I think.

06:21.000 --> 06:22.000
I think I was corrected.

06:22.000 --> 06:23.000
It's not plastic.

06:23.000 --> 06:24.000
It's like a magnesium.

06:24.000 --> 06:35.000
It's this is my I'm working at the bar computer or I have to take it with me to my local game store because this thing for whatever reason.

06:35.000 --> 06:41.000
And I think this is maybe Carl because you remember that little meeting we had with them in HP where you just blew up my spot about beverages in it.

06:41.000 --> 06:43.000
I do.

06:43.000 --> 06:45.000
That's not great.

06:45.000 --> 06:46.000
You got you got called out.

06:46.000 --> 06:49.000
You got called out on a phone call with HP.

06:49.000 --> 06:51.000
And the HP guys are like, what the fuck?

06:51.000 --> 06:52.000
What do you mean?

06:52.000 --> 06:54.000
He's going to pour a drink into it.

06:54.000 --> 06:56.000
This machine has avoided all liquids.

06:56.000 --> 06:57.000
Well, now you almost got to do it.

06:57.000 --> 06:58.000
Like, prove a point.

06:58.000 --> 07:03.000
Well, I literally I've taken photos for Twitter trolling, putting martini glasses on it.

07:03.000 --> 07:05.000
And it seems I don't know.

07:05.000 --> 07:07.000
So far, so good.

07:07.000 --> 07:08.000
Yeah.

07:08.000 --> 07:09.000
Are you still are you still liking the rig?

07:09.000 --> 07:10.000
You still liking the dev one?

07:10.000 --> 07:11.000
I like the rig.

07:11.000 --> 07:14.000
I mean, the only thing I've in fact, this is we should maybe do a dev one update.

07:14.000 --> 07:17.000
I think it's a little psychotic on the battery estimation.

07:17.000 --> 07:19.000
Are you saying that, too?

07:19.000 --> 07:20.000
I always have.

07:20.000 --> 07:22.000
I've always it's always kind of been kind of psychotic.

07:22.000 --> 07:26.000
So I don't really pay any attention to it until it's down to like 34 or 30 or 20 percent.

07:26.000 --> 07:27.000
Then I start taking it seriously.

07:27.000 --> 07:29.000
You notice it jumps like.

07:29.000 --> 07:30.000
Yeah. Yeah.

07:30.000 --> 07:33.000
That's I think that's part of their weird screen.

07:33.000 --> 07:35.000
They're trying to power power manage it.

07:35.000 --> 07:36.000
There's that.

07:36.000 --> 07:42.000
I also think there's still work in progress on some of the AMD components to just kind of really dial in.

07:42.000 --> 07:45.000
I think it gets better with newer kernels, but I don't know for sure.

07:45.000 --> 07:47.000
I've also had, you know, some updates installed.

07:47.000 --> 07:52.000
And I'd say right now I'm having one out of three or four times.

07:52.000 --> 08:00.000
I open the lid when it's been sleeping, maybe overnight or something like that, or sometimes even short, you know, 30 minute breaks.

08:00.000 --> 08:05.000
Every fourth time, every third time ish, somewhere in that range, the Wi-Fi won't reactivate.

08:05.000 --> 08:06.000
Interesting.

08:06.000 --> 08:08.000
I could try toggling airplane mode.

08:08.000 --> 08:10.000
Doesn't do anything.

08:10.000 --> 08:13.000
It just the Wi-Fi just never comes back and I have to reboot.

08:13.000 --> 08:14.000
I'm not on pop.

08:14.000 --> 08:15.000
I'm on Nix.

08:15.000 --> 08:17.000
And I don't know if there's a.

08:17.000 --> 08:20.000
Yeah, I'm still on the pop that it came with.

08:20.000 --> 08:21.000
So I haven't seen that.

08:21.000 --> 08:25.000
Although I honestly when I put it in my briefcase because I this is maybe going way back.

08:25.000 --> 08:29.000
Do you remember those 13 inch MacBooks with the NVIDIA GPUs?

08:29.000 --> 08:30.000
Yeah. Yeah.

08:30.000 --> 08:37.000
I had one of those that basically decided to melt down in my briefcase way back when because it didn't sleep properly.

08:37.000 --> 08:40.000
So I tend to just shut down when I put them in the briefcase.

08:40.000 --> 08:43.000
But yeah, and it boots so damn quick.

08:43.000 --> 08:46.000
That's what I've started doing is I just shut it down.

08:46.000 --> 08:47.000
Yeah, I just shut it down.

08:47.000 --> 08:49.000
I mean, it's so far so good.

08:49.000 --> 08:58.000
I am a little bit wishing they had a configurator on that Web page because I'm starting to see that I'm probably going to want to go up to like 24 gigs.

08:58.000 --> 09:03.000
Yeah, we're going to we're going to experiment with doing a RAM upgrade in one of the dev ones here at the studio.

09:03.000 --> 09:04.000
We have two now.

09:04.000 --> 09:08.000
Oh, and we're going to open up brands and upgrade the RAM.

09:08.000 --> 09:11.000
Yeah, it looks pretty pretty straightforward.

09:11.000 --> 09:13.000
Yeah. And I know HP says you have to buy their fancy RAM.

09:13.000 --> 09:15.000
I think that's basically bull.

09:15.000 --> 09:16.000
We didn't.

09:16.000 --> 09:17.000
Corsair, here we come.

09:17.000 --> 09:18.000
Right.

09:19.000 --> 09:20.000
New way. Totally.

09:20.000 --> 09:21.000
Yeah. All right.

09:21.000 --> 09:23.000
So anyway, it's still been a really great it's been a solid machine.

09:23.000 --> 09:24.000
Good performance.

09:24.000 --> 09:29.000
You know, in terms of like smoothness, it's very it's a very smooth machine.

09:29.000 --> 09:30.000
I like all that about it.

09:30.000 --> 09:32.000
And it's quite a bit of CPU power.

09:32.000 --> 09:35.000
And if you're disgusting, it does have another.

09:35.000 --> 09:37.000
So so the wardrobe.

09:37.000 --> 09:38.000
Oh, my God.

09:38.000 --> 09:40.000
No, I was going to say your cult following now.

09:40.000 --> 09:42.000
I know we have a wardrobe cult following now.

09:42.000 --> 09:43.000
We do ropes.

09:43.000 --> 09:44.000
We wear ropes.

09:44.000 --> 09:45.000
I don't know.

09:45.000 --> 09:51.000
I think there's something I think what I love is that I touched on something that the Coder audience has been thinking about.

09:51.000 --> 09:53.000
Maybe we all think about this.

09:53.000 --> 09:56.000
Have you considered just doing the wardrobe thing?

09:56.000 --> 09:57.000
Have you thought about this?

09:57.000 --> 09:59.000
Just same thing every day, basically.

09:59.000 --> 10:02.000
Maybe you change it up depending on the season.

10:02.000 --> 10:05.000
You know, I not really.

10:05.000 --> 10:11.000
I mean, when I go on site with clients, I just have like a purple matte border polo shirt.

10:11.000 --> 10:14.000
And I usually wear that with jeans or khakis.

10:14.000 --> 10:16.000
So I guess that's kind of a wardrobe.

10:16.000 --> 10:17.000
But yeah, that's uniform ish.

10:17.000 --> 10:18.000
Yeah.

10:18.000 --> 10:20.000
But when I'm just like home or working, I'm I don't know.

10:20.000 --> 10:24.000
Right now I'm wearing an ATP T-shirt because I'm a trader.

10:24.000 --> 10:31.000
I've been thinking I should I should just get like a branded basically that kind of stuff.

10:31.000 --> 10:32.000
David wrote in.

10:32.000 --> 10:33.000
I think so.

10:33.000 --> 10:34.000
I'm still taking opinions.

10:34.000 --> 10:37.000
So let me know because I'm not going to do anything before the road trip.

10:37.000 --> 10:39.000
So I got time to mull it over.

10:39.000 --> 10:40.000
And David wrote in over there.

10:40.000 --> 10:42.000
He says, hey, I say, hey, David, how's it going?

10:42.000 --> 10:49.000
He says, hey, personally, I wear a bunch of Navy colored polo shirts and it seems to be the standard in the industry with engineers from various companies.

10:49.000 --> 10:52.000
The Navy color means they don't show the stains.

10:52.000 --> 10:53.000
They look smart.

10:53.000 --> 10:56.000
And most importantly for me, they don't need ironing.

10:56.000 --> 10:59.000
Wash them and immediately hang them dry indoors.

10:59.000 --> 11:00.000
Perfect. Love the podcast.

11:00.000 --> 11:04.000
As always, David from the United Kingdom.

11:04.000 --> 11:05.000
Well, hey, David, thank you.

11:05.000 --> 11:07.000
I like the tip about the eye.

11:07.000 --> 11:11.000
I I stain a lot, so I appreciate that tip.

11:11.000 --> 11:12.000
That's a good one.

11:12.000 --> 11:16.000
Yeah, I don't really have any more white shirts for a reason.

11:16.000 --> 11:17.000
Yeah.

11:17.000 --> 11:23.000
Oh, and then the ones I did, they got mixed up with some like pink stuff from the girls.

11:23.000 --> 11:25.000
It's now my undershirts are pink.

11:25.000 --> 11:27.000
It's it's bad.

11:27.000 --> 11:28.000
It's bad.

11:28.000 --> 11:36.000
And then we also on the wardrobe track, we got a boost from Bronzerwing, who boosted it with just over nine thousand sats.

11:36.000 --> 11:39.000
It's over nine thousand.

11:39.000 --> 11:45.000
They say not to keep the uniform lifestyle thing going, but I to live the uniform lifestyle.

11:45.000 --> 11:46.000
But it's not an option.

11:46.000 --> 11:48.000
I work for the U.S. Army as a drone operator.

11:48.000 --> 11:52.000
The aircraft is called the Shadow and the interface runs on Red Hat Linux.

11:52.000 --> 12:02.000
It's nice that I don't have to think about what I'm going to wear each day, but I find that when I need to go somewhere somewhat formal in my civilian life, I really don't have any clothes to wear.

12:02.000 --> 12:04.000
So I need two wardrobes.

12:04.000 --> 12:05.000
Thanks for the show.

12:05.000 --> 12:06.000
I keep up the good work.

12:06.000 --> 12:07.000
That's how I feel.

12:07.000 --> 12:14.000
I just want to say this guy writes in saying he's a drone operator for the military on something called the shadow.

12:14.000 --> 12:18.000
And he thinks the interesting part of his email is his wardrobe.

12:18.000 --> 12:21.000
I thought the interesting part was that the shadow runs REL.

12:21.000 --> 12:23.000
That's what I thought was great.

12:23.000 --> 12:24.000
Actually, question.

12:24.000 --> 12:28.000
Does the DOD pay per drone a license for REL?

12:28.000 --> 12:29.000
Is that how that works?

12:29.000 --> 12:30.000
I bet. I bet.

12:30.000 --> 12:31.000
At least the workstations.

12:31.000 --> 12:32.000
I bet they do.

12:32.000 --> 12:33.000
Yeah, my God.

12:33.000 --> 12:35.000
Oh, I wish they'd tell us more.

12:35.000 --> 12:36.000
I really would love to know more.

12:36.000 --> 12:37.000
And why?

12:37.000 --> 12:46.000
I mean, I'm sure there's some dark basement somewhere in Virginia where there's like a guy taking these damaged drones and putting ARCH on them.

12:46.000 --> 12:49.000
You know he exists, the ARCH drone operator.

12:49.000 --> 12:57.000
Also, you got to think about like there was some Linux dev out there who's like building applications for Linux to run these drones.

12:57.000 --> 13:01.000
And so imagine saying you're a Linux dev and then somebody asks, so what do you do?

13:01.000 --> 13:05.000
I create the desktop UI software to run the drone program.

13:05.000 --> 13:06.000
Like, that's what I do.

13:06.000 --> 13:08.000
That's my software development for Linux.

13:08.000 --> 13:10.000
They are the darkest of dark matter devs.

13:10.000 --> 13:13.000
I love it.

13:13.000 --> 13:16.000
I'd be interested to know if the drones themselves run Linux.

13:16.000 --> 13:18.000
I have so many questions.

13:18.000 --> 13:19.000
Like, is it the GNOME desktop?

13:19.000 --> 13:23.000
Oh, no, I think it's the drones themselves that are running probably like headless REL.

13:23.000 --> 13:29.000
You think that like the operation machine, the control machine is actually running REL too?

13:29.000 --> 13:30.000
Yeah.

13:30.000 --> 13:32.000
Yeah, because he wrote the interface runs on Red Hat Linux.

13:32.000 --> 13:33.000
Oh, okay.

13:33.000 --> 13:34.000
Yeah.

13:34.000 --> 13:36.000
So, but I'm wondering, is that like a GTK application?

13:36.000 --> 13:38.000
Is it like a cute app on a GNOME desktop?

13:38.000 --> 13:40.000
Like, how weird is it?

13:40.000 --> 13:41.000
So many questions.

13:41.000 --> 13:43.000
Okay, you have to write in again, man.

13:43.000 --> 13:49.000
But this time, just let's forget the wardrobe.

13:49.000 --> 13:55.000
You know, I wish I'd figured this out before the meetups because I really don't have anything great to wear to the meetups.

13:55.000 --> 13:57.000
And we're about to do a whole swath of West Coast meetups.

13:57.000 --> 14:01.000
This is my last show in studio before, last coder.

14:01.000 --> 14:03.000
We're going to do Linux Unplugged on Sunday.

14:03.000 --> 14:05.000
Oh, actually, wait a minute.

14:05.000 --> 14:09.000
I think I'm going to squeeze out next week's coder first before I leave.

14:09.000 --> 14:13.000
I think that's my plan is I'm going to sneak, I'm going to get the RV ready to go.

14:13.000 --> 14:17.000
And then I'm going to sneak down to the studio because we're doing it in the morning now.

14:17.000 --> 14:19.000
We'll bang out coder in the morning.

14:19.000 --> 14:23.000
And then I'm basically hitting the road immediately after we get off the air.

14:23.000 --> 14:25.000
Do you want to do it earlier then?

14:25.000 --> 14:26.000
No, I don't.

14:26.000 --> 14:28.000
I don't think I could.

14:28.000 --> 14:31.000
My name for a show is pretty early.

14:31.000 --> 14:35.000
I'm not complaining, but I get up at probably about 630 to do the show at 9.

14:35.000 --> 14:36.000
Of course, maybe.

14:36.000 --> 14:39.000
Recently, I've been waking up at 4 like an idiot, so you never know.

14:39.000 --> 14:40.000
But no, I think it'll be fine.

14:40.000 --> 14:46.000
I think it'll work out because the way I look at the timing, I think that means we'll actually just offset all of the major traffic.

14:46.000 --> 14:49.000
So we may actually work out really well.

14:49.000 --> 14:54.000
If you're going to be able to make it to any of the West Coast meetups, and we have several of them up and down the I-5 corridor,

14:54.000 --> 14:58.000
go to meetup.com slash Jupiter Broadcasting and let us know so we can prepare the venue.

14:58.000 --> 14:59.000
We want to let everybody know.

14:59.000 --> 15:01.000
We're also going to bring some swag on board.

15:01.000 --> 15:03.000
You'll have an opportunity to grab some of that.

15:03.000 --> 15:06.000
And then we'll be doing the shows from the road as well.

15:06.000 --> 15:13.000
And we have a matrix chat room to discuss all of the logistics at bit.ly slash West Coast Crew.

15:13.000 --> 15:16.000
You can go over there and chat with us and chat with the other folks in the area.

15:16.000 --> 15:19.000
Some people are looking to do like carpooling, things like that.

15:19.000 --> 15:22.000
Bit.ly slash West Coast Crew.

15:22.000 --> 15:25.000
And of course, a big thank you to Linode for making this possible.

15:25.000 --> 15:29.000
They are the ones that are sponsoring this, putting it all together, helping us with the logistics,

15:29.000 --> 15:31.000
because they want to invest in our community.

15:34.000 --> 15:36.000
Linode.com slash Coder.

15:36.000 --> 15:37.000
That's right.

15:37.000 --> 15:42.000
Linode.com slash Coder is where you go to get $100 in 60-day credit on a new account.

15:42.000 --> 15:46.000
And it's just a great way to support the show while you're checking out something truly awesome.

15:46.000 --> 15:49.000
Linode is fast, reliable cloud hosting.

15:49.000 --> 15:51.000
You really should try it for your next project.

15:51.000 --> 15:56.000
It's what we use for everything we've built, like our brand new website, because we're performance hounds.

15:56.000 --> 15:58.000
And they've got 11 data centers for you to choose from.

15:58.000 --> 16:02.000
So something's going to be close to you, your customer, your client, your friends, your fams, whatevs.

16:02.000 --> 16:05.000
But also, they just have screaming fast rigs.

16:05.000 --> 16:07.000
They've got MVME storage if you need it.

16:07.000 --> 16:08.000
They've got AMD EPYC CPUs.

16:08.000 --> 16:10.000
They've got GPU dedicated rigs.

16:10.000 --> 16:14.000
They've got something that's going to meet your price and performance ratio that you need

16:14.000 --> 16:21.000
without being overly complicated, without over-jargoning everything and giving everything its own crazy esoteric name,

16:21.000 --> 16:25.000
like those duopoly hyperscalers do that want to lock you into their platform.

16:25.000 --> 16:29.000
Linode's been getting by by just building a good product for nearly 19 years.

16:29.000 --> 16:33.000
Their business stands on the back of a good product.

16:33.000 --> 16:37.000
That's why they want to give you $100 to try it, because they know they've got something good.

16:37.000 --> 16:41.000
And if they give you the ability to really kick the tires, you'll come away impressed.

16:41.000 --> 16:44.000
I love their S3 compatible object storage.

16:44.000 --> 16:47.000
Their cloud firewalls make it easy for us to manage traffic.

16:47.000 --> 16:51.000
And of course, the backup and snapshots are so simple and straightforward.

16:51.000 --> 16:56.000
And just reviewing where you're at, making sure your backups are good before you make a major change, super simple.

16:56.000 --> 17:00.000
You know, something Linode has begun offering semi-recently.

17:00.000 --> 17:06.000
I mean, they've been offering it for a little bit now, but I think it's worth talking about is their new managed database service.

17:06.000 --> 17:12.000
What is new about it is they expanded to more database offerings, including Postgres and Mongo and MySQL, of course.

17:12.000 --> 17:16.000
So databases are rarely a one size fits all thing.

17:16.000 --> 17:21.000
And of course, there's lots of different ways you could deploy them, lots of different options and configuration choices.

17:21.000 --> 17:27.000
So what I would recommend you do is if you go over to Linode's site, they have great documentation.

17:27.000 --> 17:35.000
And one of the areas you can look up is understanding managed databases versus unmanaged databases and figuring out where maybe you fit.

17:35.000 --> 17:37.000
A managed database is so nice.

17:37.000 --> 17:44.000
It gives developers and organizations an easy, cost effective way to deploy a self-sufficient database cluster.

17:44.000 --> 17:49.000
And you let Linode's experts manage it and you focus on building your application.

17:49.000 --> 17:51.000
It's something that I think is super valuable.

17:51.000 --> 17:56.000
If you have a core focus and you want to let somebody else manage that kind of stuff, check that out.

17:56.000 --> 18:01.000
You can build it from scratch or you could do a one click deployment and you've got customer support 24-7.

18:01.000 --> 18:07.000
Go check them out, support the show and get $100 on a new account when you go to linode.com slash coder.

18:07.000 --> 18:11.000
One more time to support the show, it's linode.com slash coder.

18:14.000 --> 18:18.000
iOS 16 came out on Monday and it was like late in the day.

18:18.000 --> 18:21.000
I almost thought they were going to punt, but they eventually did it.

18:21.000 --> 18:23.000
Have you upgraded any of your devices?

18:23.000 --> 18:24.000
Yeah, my phone.

18:24.000 --> 18:26.000
Yeah, I did my phone.

18:26.000 --> 18:32.000
I've had the iPad on the beta for almost two months and it's still on the beta.

18:32.000 --> 18:35.000
But I did go ahead and I did upgrade the phone.

18:35.000 --> 18:38.000
Not a lot different on this release.

18:38.000 --> 18:40.000
This feels like one of their smaller ones, doesn't it?

18:40.000 --> 18:41.000
Yeah.

18:41.000 --> 18:42.000
Maybe for the best.

18:42.000 --> 18:45.000
I mean, it's a pretty mature platform at this point, right?

18:45.000 --> 18:46.000
Yeah.

18:46.000 --> 18:48.000
Maybe better that they're not going hog wild.

18:48.000 --> 18:52.000
And I got to be honest, I do like the lock screen customizations.

18:52.000 --> 18:56.000
The thing that really put over the top for me was that when you select a photo,

18:56.000 --> 19:00.000
you can then apply a filter to it to kind of give a – I won't be able to show it on camera,

19:00.000 --> 19:03.000
but to kind of give like a theme for the background.

19:03.000 --> 19:05.000
I just really like the way it all came together.

19:05.000 --> 19:08.000
I actually think the lock screen customization stuff is done pretty well.

19:08.000 --> 19:13.000
But you know, when you're using it, you won't really notice much different.

19:13.000 --> 19:17.000
But there was one feature that I remember them mentioning,

19:17.000 --> 19:19.000
but I completely forgotten about it.

19:19.000 --> 19:22.000
Until last night, I was looking at photos with the wife,

19:22.000 --> 19:26.000
and I just kind of accidentally discovered that when you tap an object,

19:26.000 --> 19:33.000
a dog, a person in a photo, Apple has added this kind of automatic edge detection

19:33.000 --> 19:38.000
and will pull that object, person, dog, whatever out of the background

19:38.000 --> 19:42.000
and kind of like almost create a PNG sticker out of them.

19:42.000 --> 19:45.000
And if that isn't the funnest thing, I don't know if you've tried this yet,

19:45.000 --> 19:50.000
but if you go into your photos app and you find like a picture of a person

19:50.000 --> 19:54.000
and you tap them, almost like you're trying to make a live photo play,

19:54.000 --> 19:57.000
you'll see this really cool animation that looks like they've just been beamed up

19:57.000 --> 19:59.000
to the Starship Enterprise.

19:59.000 --> 20:02.000
Then it'll pull them away, and you can see when you move your thumb around,

20:02.000 --> 20:07.000
it's pulled that object out of the background, and now you can copy that, you can share it.

20:07.000 --> 20:12.000
Man, I remember using early versions of Photoshop when they first got layers

20:12.000 --> 20:15.000
and learning how to cut people and objects out of photos,

20:15.000 --> 20:18.000
and now to think that you can just tap and hold on your stupid little phone,

20:18.000 --> 20:22.000
and it does a pretty good job of finding the edges.

20:22.000 --> 20:25.000
It's like one of those little features that I just think is really great.

20:25.000 --> 20:31.000
And then also, finally, the pedometer that's shipped in like every freaking iPhone ever

20:31.000 --> 20:35.000
will go towards your movement rings and close them,

20:35.000 --> 20:38.000
which is just something I've always hated if I forget my watch.

20:38.000 --> 20:41.000
I never got credit for it.

20:41.000 --> 20:45.000
And you can edit iMessage, small stuff, right, for users.

20:45.000 --> 20:50.000
But I actually think Apple has a decent amount here for developers.

20:50.000 --> 20:53.000
Everything came with APIs and a kit, basically.

20:53.000 --> 20:59.000
You've got widget kit for the lock screen, a whole new set of app intents,

20:59.000 --> 21:02.000
selectable map features you can pull in individual parts of maps into apps.

21:02.000 --> 21:04.000
They have a whole new API there.

21:04.000 --> 21:08.000
New API for in-app purchases, a little bit better improvement there.

21:08.000 --> 21:11.000
New weather kit API.

21:11.000 --> 21:14.000
They have platform-specific APIs.

21:14.000 --> 21:18.000
They also have a set of rest APIs that anybody can use for weather kit.

21:18.000 --> 21:23.000
They've got new AR Kit 6 in here, new types of apps in CarPlay,

21:23.000 --> 21:29.000
including EV charging apps, and some other things that should have been in the CarPlay forever.

21:29.000 --> 21:31.000
Just things like that.

21:31.000 --> 21:34.000
There's new sets of developer toolkits and APIs.

21:34.000 --> 21:36.000
But you look at all this, plus you look at the iPhone 14,

21:36.000 --> 21:39.000
I'm kind of curious to hear what your takeaway is, since the event just happened.

21:39.000 --> 21:43.000
The reviews just landed this morning for the iPhone 14 as we're recording.

21:43.000 --> 21:45.000
I just would love to hear what your takeaway of all this is.

21:45.000 --> 21:47.000
Are you finding any of this interesting?

21:47.000 --> 21:49.000
Or is this a total bore to you?

21:49.000 --> 21:54.000
I did not purchase an iPhone because even though I'm two generations behind,

21:54.000 --> 22:00.000
it's just not big enough of a change to warrant the $800 it would cost.

22:00.000 --> 22:05.000
Yeah, it feels like a $1,000 cell phone these days is a little ridiculous.

22:05.000 --> 22:11.000
Not that it never was, but just with the price of everything

22:11.000 --> 22:14.000
and the overall kind of economic situation,

22:14.000 --> 22:17.000
it just feels like a lot of money to drop on a cell phone.

22:17.000 --> 22:22.000
Right. And also, I found something more expensive to spend money on that I can't talk about.

22:22.000 --> 22:23.000
Oh.

22:23.000 --> 22:24.000
Oh, yes.

22:24.000 --> 22:25.000
Hookers.

22:25.000 --> 22:27.000
Did you say hookers?

22:27.000 --> 22:29.000
Wow.

22:29.000 --> 22:31.000
I'm actually opening my own gin mill now.

22:31.000 --> 22:35.000
I'm doing my own, you know, like an actor, right?

22:35.000 --> 22:36.000
I'm doing my own label.

22:36.000 --> 22:37.000
Yes.

22:37.000 --> 22:44.000
No, I mean, on the dev side, it's really interesting that they've basically made an API for every new feature

22:44.000 --> 22:47.000
because all things have to relate to Magic the Gathering.

22:47.000 --> 22:52.000
Now, I could totally see the Magic Companion app using WidgetKit, Hint, Wizards, Hint

22:52.000 --> 22:57.000
to have your lock screen show everybody's life totals since you haven't always on lock screen

22:57.000 --> 23:00.000
if you're on an iPhone 14.

23:00.000 --> 23:01.000
So that's pretty cool.

23:01.000 --> 23:07.000
Being able to do things without jumping into individual apps is definitely going to be, I think, a major feature.

23:07.000 --> 23:12.000
I don't know if that's going to be great for app devs, though, from a monetization standpoint.

23:12.000 --> 23:15.000
Yeah, I can see that being an issue.

23:15.000 --> 23:17.000
Oh, I should have mentioned Metal 3's in here, too.

23:17.000 --> 23:19.000
What was your major takeaway?

23:19.000 --> 23:25.000
I think the thing that stuck out with me is this is kind of a classic Apple release.

23:25.000 --> 23:27.000
This is what I think they should be doing more of, to tell you the truth.

23:27.000 --> 23:32.000
I don't need the super shiny, crazy, whizbang features that blow me away.

23:32.000 --> 23:35.000
I like the small little things here.

23:35.000 --> 23:40.000
You know, this release also made some improvement for HomeKit, and I'm all about home automation stuff.

23:40.000 --> 23:44.000
They added support for Matter Standard, which should be coming later next year.

23:44.000 --> 23:46.000
And those kinds of things are nice to see.

23:46.000 --> 23:50.000
The stuff that resonated with me was actually the iPhone 14.

23:50.000 --> 24:02.000
I like the satellite emergency calling feature just because I do go on a lot of road trips where there's large swaths of road that have no cell signal.

24:02.000 --> 24:10.000
And I've often wondered, what the hell am I going to do if I ever get in an accident or something breaks down and I'm hours away from signal?

24:10.000 --> 24:18.000
And I've thought about getting those little Garmin handhelds and paying the $11 a month or whatever it is to have one just in case.

24:18.000 --> 24:20.000
But, you know, then it's another device I have to charge.

24:20.000 --> 24:21.000
It's something I have to store.

24:21.000 --> 24:23.000
I have to teach the family how to use in an emergency.

24:23.000 --> 24:26.000
And then it's another monthly bill that I'm paying.

24:26.000 --> 24:31.000
So to have this built into the cell phone and it's free for a couple of years.

24:31.000 --> 24:33.000
So you get a good sense of it works or not.

24:33.000 --> 24:39.000
That to me feels like a pretty significant feature and a worthy addition to like a phone.

24:39.000 --> 24:42.000
Like, I wish we'd see all vendors do this.

24:42.000 --> 24:45.000
And then on top of that, I think the camera improvements are decent.

24:45.000 --> 24:47.000
The reviews are saying that it's a good looking camera.

24:47.000 --> 24:49.000
It does not blow away, but it's better.

24:49.000 --> 24:54.000
Yeah, I think it's pretty, pretty useful, especially if you do any kind of like biking or hiking.

24:54.000 --> 24:59.000
I can tell you down here in Florida, we have some pretty interesting trails with lots of reptiles that want to kill you.

24:59.000 --> 25:05.000
So I guess the always on screen is like really always on.

25:05.000 --> 25:08.000
People are saying, yeah, I don't know if I like that.

25:08.000 --> 25:13.000
But on the iPhone 14 Pro, if you've got an Apple Watch and you walk out of the room,

25:13.000 --> 25:18.000
the screen will turn off using the proximity detection that they have based on the strength of the Bluetooth signal.

25:18.000 --> 25:22.000
And so when you walk back into the room, the screen turns back on.

25:22.000 --> 25:23.000
That's pretty neat. Yeah.

25:23.000 --> 25:32.000
I think it also has some like pocket detection stuff and proximity sensor stuff where it turns off the screen if it's in your pocket and things like that.

25:32.000 --> 25:34.000
But, you know, you boil it down always on screen.

25:34.000 --> 25:35.000
They should have had that for a while.

25:35.000 --> 25:36.000
Lock screen widgets.

25:36.000 --> 25:38.000
They should have had that for a while.

25:38.000 --> 25:43.000
But now they're there and a better camera and the satellite emergency calling.

25:43.000 --> 25:46.000
I went ahead and pulled the trigger for my upgrade program.

25:46.000 --> 25:48.000
Oh, that's right. You have the upgrade program.

25:48.000 --> 25:51.000
Yeah. And, you know, I've had that since the iPhone 7.

25:51.000 --> 25:57.000
And it just works for me when I'm on the edge, when I can't, you know, I say, all right, I'll do it.

25:57.000 --> 26:04.000
You also the iPhone 14 Pro has that improved dual frequency GPS support that the watch ultra has.

26:04.000 --> 26:10.000
Again, another feature I use quite a bit for those in the notes, the L5 satellite frequency.

26:10.000 --> 26:12.000
And they've added that to the iPhone 14 Pro.

26:12.000 --> 26:18.000
So, again, you're going to get more accurate GPS navigation in places where you don't necessarily have cell signal.

26:18.000 --> 26:19.000
Again, another feature.

26:19.000 --> 26:27.000
This really feels like for those of us that end up in areas where we don't have cell signal very often, this is a pretty good iPhone upgrade.

26:27.000 --> 26:30.000
If I didn't have the upgrade program, I don't think I'd bother.

26:30.000 --> 26:33.000
Yeah. It doesn't feel like there's anything must have in here.

26:33.000 --> 26:39.000
Yeah. I am pleased, like you said, that they are just coming out of the gate with APIs.

26:39.000 --> 26:44.000
They haven't launched it yet, but they also do the live intents for the dynamic island.

26:44.000 --> 26:50.000
So that new feature also ships almost on day one with an API.

26:50.000 --> 26:54.000
That's good. I mean, that's stuff we've been asking out of Apple for a while.

26:54.000 --> 26:56.000
I think it remains a competitive phone.

26:56.000 --> 27:07.000
I just think the pricing, I wonder if we're going to see Apple sales really take a hit because I think a lot of people are repricing things right now in their head.

27:07.000 --> 27:09.000
Then again, Apple sells to a particular demographic.

27:09.000 --> 27:11.000
Maybe they're the last to take a hit. I don't know.

27:11.000 --> 27:16.000
Yeah. I mean, I think out of what they announced, probably the watch.

27:16.000 --> 27:22.000
And I could see a lot of people upgrading to the AirPods Pro 2 who maybe skipped the last generation.

27:22.000 --> 27:32.000
I don't know. I don't know. I don't know that people are going to be clamoring for this new iPhone, except, as you pointed out accidentally, that upgrade program.

27:32.000 --> 27:36.000
If you have the upgrade program, you kind of might as well, I suppose.

27:36.000 --> 27:40.000
And that there's also rumors that they're going to launch another like phone subscription program.

27:40.000 --> 27:43.000
But, you know, Google has a really competitive one for the Pixel.

27:43.000 --> 27:49.000
If that floats your boat because their program, it's every two years, which seems totally reasonable to me.

27:49.000 --> 27:51.000
But I think you get to keep the phone.

27:51.000 --> 27:52.000
Oh, interesting.

27:52.000 --> 27:55.000
Yeah. Which is great for like, you know, hand-me-downs to kids and stuff.

27:55.000 --> 28:07.000
Yeah. I mean, one of the nice things from a dev standpoint here is there's nothing necessarily exclusionary that's like iPhone 14 only from an API perspective.

28:07.000 --> 28:13.000
You could argue that a lot of the lockscreen stuff is maybe less useful on the older phones because, you know, the phone goes to sleep.

28:13.000 --> 28:15.000
But you could still totally do it, right?

28:15.000 --> 28:19.000
And those people, users could take advantage of those features when they wanted to.

28:19.000 --> 28:25.000
I think in a couple of weeks, you're going to see people like David Smith and others going crazy with the lockscreen widgets.

28:25.000 --> 28:27.000
I think that's going to be a big area.

28:27.000 --> 28:29.000
I mean, David Smith, this is like, this is his jam, right?

28:29.000 --> 28:31.000
He did a Widget Smith.

28:31.000 --> 28:32.000
Yep.

28:32.000 --> 28:38.000
In fact, if you're thinking of making like a Widget Smith with a lockscreen, David Smith's already been on it probably for like a month.

28:38.000 --> 28:40.000
Don't even try.

28:40.000 --> 28:47.000
Tailscale.com slash coder. Go there to get a free personal account for up to 20 devices.

28:47.000 --> 28:49.000
And it's a great way to support the show.

28:49.000 --> 28:52.000
Tailscale is a zero config VPN.

28:52.000 --> 28:54.000
You get it installed on any device in minutes.

28:54.000 --> 28:56.000
It'll take care of your firewall rules.

28:56.000 --> 29:00.000
It'll navigate your double carrier grade nets if you got something like that.

29:00.000 --> 29:06.000
And your devices will connect directly to each other on a mesh flat network using WireGuard's noise protocol for encryption.

29:06.000 --> 29:13.000
So you're building a flat mesh network that's your own private network using WireGuard's encryption technology.

29:13.000 --> 29:14.000
It's so great.

29:14.000 --> 29:22.000
Even when you're separated by firewalls or subnets or different providers, everything is on one easy to understand flat network.

29:22.000 --> 29:25.000
And then you got great controls on top of that, like ACLs.

29:25.000 --> 29:31.000
If you want to share a particular machine or a particular port with another tail scale user, I use that functionality all the time.

29:31.000 --> 29:36.000
Tailscale send, which is kind of like airdrop, but for all your tail scale systems.

29:36.000 --> 29:43.000
And now also tail scale SSH, which allows you to establish an SSH connection between your devices in the tail scale network.

29:43.000 --> 29:48.000
I think what's been key for me is I've used tail scale over, I don't know, the last almost a year probably.

29:48.000 --> 29:49.000
It's been a bit.

29:49.000 --> 29:52.000
I keep improving the way I have things set up.

29:52.000 --> 29:58.000
I've mentioned before, but for me, the big change was none of my networks now have inbound ports on my firewall.

29:58.000 --> 30:02.000
I just use tail scale on my phone and I manage things that way.

30:02.000 --> 30:05.000
I've set up home assistant on my tail scale network at the studio.

30:05.000 --> 30:15.000
So that way I can remote into the studio over the tail scale network into the studio's home assistant instance and manage the lights and the heat and the fans and all that kind of stuff in the studio.

30:15.000 --> 30:21.000
It's made it possible for me to provide remote desktop support to my kids, my family members.

30:21.000 --> 30:32.000
And it's a game changer for folks that are not here at the studio physically, but need to get access to the resources we have on the land here for our remote workers, which is like almost always everybody but me.

30:32.000 --> 30:35.000
And it's just totally been a fundamental game changer.

30:35.000 --> 30:40.000
Tail scale is the product we all hoped would come along when we saw WireGuard was going to land in the Linux kernel.

30:40.000 --> 30:46.000
And now they've brought it to every platform with their special sauce that makes it work like magic.

30:46.000 --> 30:48.000
I think you're going to be really impressed.

30:48.000 --> 30:53.000
So go support the show and try it for free up to 20 devices when you go to tailscale.com slash coder.

30:53.000 --> 30:59.000
One more time, tailscale.com slash coder.

30:59.000 --> 31:14.000
I just wanted to mention really quickly that today we got word that Patreon is laying off 17 percent of their staff, affecting 80 employees, which also comes after news that they laid off their entire cyber security staff last week.

31:14.000 --> 31:18.000
They're also closing their Dublin office as well.

31:18.000 --> 31:21.000
I think, yeah, their Berlin office as well.

31:21.000 --> 31:28.000
So they're closing two offices and they are laying off 17 percent of their staff.

31:28.000 --> 31:36.000
That comes in the shadow of a larger tidal wave of tech industry layoffs.

31:36.000 --> 31:44.000
Layoffs have affected light tricks, stream elements, jelly smack, TikTok, Snapchat, Snapchat.

31:44.000 --> 31:47.000
I mean, we've been hearing about several tech companies that are beginning to do layoffs.

31:47.000 --> 31:50.000
Now, this is we've been talking about this for a while, right?

31:50.000 --> 31:52.000
This is going to be a readjustment period.

31:52.000 --> 31:59.000
You know, what's crazy is Patreon just raised one hundred and fifty five million dollars in VC funding last year.

31:59.000 --> 32:08.000
Are they already out of steam? Because in December, Patreon said they plan to double in size in 2022.

32:08.000 --> 32:14.000
In December. And now here we are and they're doing rounds of layoffs and closing two offices.

32:14.000 --> 32:22.000
Well, I mean, it kind of almost like with the digital advertising stuff being down, I imagine the thing is getting tighter.

32:22.000 --> 32:25.000
It's really easy just to cancel Patreons, right?

32:25.000 --> 32:29.000
That's got to be it. That's got to be one of the first to go. Indeed.

32:29.000 --> 32:32.000
Well, that's why we're grateful for some boost.

32:32.000 --> 32:36.000
Alex Gates came in with three thousand three hundred and thirty three sats.

32:36.000 --> 32:40.000
Graphene OS is the best it's ever been with less compromises than before.

32:40.000 --> 32:44.000
If you want privacy, take it into your own hands and stop trusting the companies.

32:44.000 --> 32:48.000
That goes for both Apple and Google, who have had CSAM news.

32:48.000 --> 32:51.000
I wish Linux phones were further along, but I'll take what I can get now.

32:51.000 --> 32:56.000
OK, you know what, Alex, I am kind of up for taking the Graphene OS challenge.

32:56.000 --> 32:59.000
I'm pretty sure you can get it working on the Pixel 3.

32:59.000 --> 33:09.000
I have my experience has always been these these these Android forks always have issues and their teams struggle to stay up to date with what Google's doing.

33:09.000 --> 33:13.000
But I'd love to be proven wrong. I like the idea of Graphene OS.

33:13.000 --> 33:19.000
I believe one of the things that offers is essentially a sandboxed Google Play API in store.

33:19.000 --> 33:25.000
So you can have some of those G app goodies without it taking over your entire phone and monitoring everything you do.

33:25.000 --> 33:30.000
And Graphene OS is Google fide. So it's not sending stuff off to Google, sending the metrics and things like that.

33:30.000 --> 33:35.000
But it's still a modern Android experience. That sounds really compelling.

33:35.000 --> 33:40.000
I went through the website after this boost came in and.

33:40.000 --> 33:44.000
If you have the right hardware, you can actually flash your phone from their website.

33:44.000 --> 33:47.000
It looks really, really simple.

33:47.000 --> 33:51.000
Of course, it never is as simple as it looks usually, but I I want to give it a try.

33:51.000 --> 33:53.000
So I may have an update on that in the future.

33:53.000 --> 34:00.000
Woden 501 boost in with 3000 sats gives us another reason to act quick on your RSI issues.

34:00.000 --> 34:09.000
Geocracy, he says, start the process of getting ergonomic devices at your workplace ASAP because you never know how long it's going to take to actually get them.

34:09.000 --> 34:13.000
I've been waiting six months for my split keyboard and vertical mouse.

34:13.000 --> 34:17.000
Oh, geez, that sucks, man. The RSI is just getting worse in the meantime.

34:17.000 --> 34:21.000
I mean, I think you and I would just go out and buy our own keyboard, wouldn't we?

34:21.000 --> 34:23.000
Yeah, and probably not what you should do, really.

34:23.000 --> 34:27.000
The company should be paying for that stuff, but that's always how I've been.

34:27.000 --> 34:34.000
If they'd let me, I'd bring my own monitors to just, you know, they just weren't willing to spend the money on the on the keyboards and the monitors.

34:34.000 --> 34:38.000
Woden goes on to say a vertical mouse is required for me.

34:38.000 --> 34:44.000
Otherwise, I get bad trigger thumb. For a keyboard, a fully separated split keyboard with tenting is my go to.

34:44.000 --> 34:49.000
Yeah, I agree. Split keyboard with tenting has been a game changer for my desktop upstairs.

34:49.000 --> 34:53.000
He goes on to say, I've got a mechanical keyboard with the tenting kit.

34:53.000 --> 34:57.000
It's been very comfortable to use. Well, thank you, Woden.

34:57.000 --> 35:01.000
And then we got 2000 sats from Fred.

35:01.000 --> 35:08.000
He says, check out pay with moon, guys. They're temporary credit cards that are useful for avoiding reoccurring subscription fees.

35:08.000 --> 35:12.000
So you can get one that's valid for only three months.

35:12.000 --> 35:19.000
Pay with moon dot com is where you go. It's like a temporary credit card that you generate.

35:19.000 --> 35:29.000
This is so cool. I might actually try this out on the road trip because we were doing some sat splits in the booths with Brent for Linux unplugged and office hours.

35:29.000 --> 35:35.000
And so he is using sats to put fuel in the tank and buy goodies on the road trip.

35:35.000 --> 35:38.000
So pay with moon could be an interesting little trick.

35:38.000 --> 35:45.000
Yeah, mega strike boost in rounding us out with three thousand three hundred thirty one sats.

35:45.000 --> 35:48.000
Guys, I've got great respect for Apple and the work they've done in hardware.

35:48.000 --> 35:53.000
There's no denying that their products have a premium feel to them and the M1 seems to have good performance.

35:53.000 --> 35:57.000
However, I just can't get behind their software.

35:57.000 --> 36:04.000
It makes zero sense and feels way too restrictive. Basic tasks that you can do on an Android like rearrange your screen icons.

36:04.000 --> 36:09.000
Not even an option on iOS. Their software is what makes it a complete deal breaker for me.

36:09.000 --> 36:14.000
But thanks as always. I think we both understand that position.

36:14.000 --> 36:17.000
It is also what breaks it for you on the iPad most of the time.

36:17.000 --> 36:21.000
That and the policies. You combine the two and it's that's a mess.

36:21.000 --> 36:27.000
The iPad, it's just it's just mocks me. It could be that Star Trek tablet that I would love.

36:27.000 --> 36:29.000
One day. One day maybe.

36:29.000 --> 36:33.000
And our last boost came in from a young dookie. Fifty sats.

36:33.000 --> 36:37.000
Just wanted to put this one in here. Usually we have a two thousand sat minimum.

36:37.000 --> 36:41.000
But I love this message. Finally getting set up with a podcasting 2.0 app.

36:41.000 --> 36:44.000
Now I've got Matrix and I just want to say thanks.

36:44.000 --> 36:54.000
You know I'm really, really kind of relieved and excited that the Matrix decision seems to be a really good one.

36:54.000 --> 36:57.000
Our community is really growing over there and it's a really good community.

36:57.000 --> 37:01.000
We have details at Jupiter Broadcasting dot com slash Matrix.

37:01.000 --> 37:07.000
The podcasting 2.0 community has been incredible. The stuff they're building for future podcasts is so great.

37:07.000 --> 37:12.000
And PeerTube, which is where we're live streaming now, turns out has been a really great decision.

37:12.000 --> 37:19.000
Because it exposes a whole API available to us that we can use to do all kinds of really neat things.

37:19.000 --> 37:24.000
Like now when we're live, if you go to Jupiter Broadcasting dot com right now.

37:24.000 --> 37:31.000
There'll be a red background behind the live link that just shows when we're live the live link actually lights up live.

37:31.000 --> 37:36.000
For 15 years you've never known when you go to our website if we're live or not.

37:36.000 --> 37:41.000
It's so ridiculous. But now we have an API that we can check to see are we actually live.

37:41.000 --> 37:48.000
So it's just been great. So a lot of good technologies and they're all ones that we're hosting that are all decentralized.

37:48.000 --> 37:54.000
Pretty stoked about it. So take that tech companies. Yeah!

37:54.000 --> 37:56.000
Yeah, we've got a little light thing.

37:56.000 --> 38:00.000
Yeah, that's right. That's right. Thank you everybody who boosted in.

38:00.000 --> 38:03.000
Also thank you to Grant who sent his first boost in this week.

38:03.000 --> 38:09.000
We also got 4,000 sats from OAGuy1 who just wanted to send me some safe travel wishes for the road trip.

38:09.000 --> 38:13.000
And we got a row of ducks from Mr. Quackers.

38:13.000 --> 38:16.000
Quacka Wacka! It's a treasure! Yippee!

38:16.000 --> 38:20.000
Thank you everybody. If you'd like to get a new podcast app, go to newpodcastapps.com.

38:20.000 --> 38:24.000
I love Podverse. It's open source, available on Android, iOS and the web.

38:24.000 --> 38:29.000
And if you just want to earn sats while you listen to podcasts, you can try out Fountain FM.

38:29.000 --> 38:32.000
I'll have a link to my profile in the show notes.

38:32.000 --> 38:36.000
Mr. Dominic, before we go, I have one email I wanted to read.

38:36.000 --> 38:39.000
And then I want you to tell us where to send folks.

38:39.000 --> 38:42.000
But check this one out. This is a simple one. This isn't even a high quality one.

38:42.000 --> 38:46.000
But I wanted to read this email that came in from Dennis.

38:46.000 --> 38:48.000
Oh God. I think I know which one this is.

38:48.000 --> 38:52.000
Dennis would like to know our gambling and non-gambling prices.

38:52.000 --> 38:57.000
Hey guys, can you quote me your best reseller prices on the following please?

38:57.000 --> 39:03.000
A regular non-gambling ad and a gambling based ad.

39:03.000 --> 39:07.000
Looking forward to hearing from you. Kind regards, Dennis.

39:07.000 --> 39:13.000
And all we'd have to do is say, hey Dennis, our price is $5,000 or whatever we want to set.

39:13.000 --> 39:15.000
And he'd probably pay it.

39:15.000 --> 39:19.000
I think we should do that. Why can't we get some of that Barstool sports money?

39:19.000 --> 39:24.000
We could probably just accept it and I bet most of them wouldn't even notice if we ran them or not.

39:24.000 --> 39:26.000
They would just pay.

39:26.000 --> 39:31.000
You know what we should do? Since I'm back into all the gaming stuff and I have more to announce soon.

39:31.000 --> 39:36.000
We should just sell e-sport ads. What could we sell? You know, dick pills.

39:36.000 --> 39:41.000
What about packaging for your, oh no, you go on brand packaging for your cards.

39:41.000 --> 39:43.000
Oh yeah, well I don't think they would pay as much.

39:43.000 --> 39:48.000
But I've been watching a lot of MTG streamers. They know their audience.

39:48.000 --> 39:52.000
You're in your 30s, 40s, you need some help in the bedroom.

39:52.000 --> 39:55.000
You're losing your hair, so you got some Keeps advertising going there.

39:55.000 --> 39:58.000
Maybe some vitamins, yeah, some Keeps, that'd be good. Yeah.

39:58.000 --> 39:59.000
Oh, we could do that.

39:59.000 --> 40:04.000
I'm sure around Valentine's Day there's going to be like a million flowers and chocolate, you know, like don't forget idiots.

40:04.000 --> 40:09.000
I got it right now. Hey everyone, what's more important than your health?

40:09.000 --> 40:14.000
Well, your sexual health. That's why we want to tell you about our friends over at Big Deep Pills.

40:14.000 --> 40:21.000
That's right, Big Deep Pills. Go there to support the show and get $20 off your order of $200 or more at Big Deep Pills.

40:21.000 --> 40:24.000
I would even be sleazier than that.

40:24.000 --> 40:29.000
We know that you're an arch user. You value performance and stability.

40:29.000 --> 40:31.000
Well, why not have that in the bedroom?

40:31.000 --> 40:35.000
Right. We know you optimize your workstation so it performs at its best all the time.

40:35.000 --> 40:41.000
Well, why not optimize your body? Big Deep Pills dot com.

40:41.000 --> 40:44.000
And we could even do like the mental health ones, right?

40:44.000 --> 40:48.000
We know you're running Windows and that hurts. Better help dot com.

40:48.000 --> 40:50.000
Oh, man, we got this.

40:50.000 --> 40:52.000
I think we should catch their checks.

40:52.000 --> 40:56.000
You know, you're right. I was going to say, you know, thanks members. Thanks that we don't have to do this.

40:56.000 --> 40:59.000
But why not have it all? You know, we could just have it all.

40:59.000 --> 41:02.000
Would they even listen to know that we're screwing with them in the ads?

41:02.000 --> 41:07.000
Oh, man. Oh, I feel like we should launch a podcast where we do just that.

41:07.000 --> 41:10.000
That's probably what some podcasters are doing, let's be honest.

41:10.000 --> 41:16.000
Yeah, I've never known that there was like 400 companies who are worried about dudes in their 40s losing their hair.

41:16.000 --> 41:19.000
It's because you got to become a dude in your 40s and then all of a sudden they find you.

41:19.000 --> 41:22.000
Yeah, I'm still below that mark.

41:22.000 --> 41:23.000
Oh, they're coming for you.

41:23.000 --> 41:24.000
Oh, they're coming.

41:24.000 --> 41:31.000
In the meantime, thank you to our Coder QA crew, our members who make it so we don't have to respond to emails like that and go into crazy schemes.

41:31.000 --> 41:34.000
If you want to support the show, keep us on the straight and narrow, keep independent content going.

41:34.000 --> 41:36.000
I look at it like this.

41:36.000 --> 41:41.000
When you're a member, you're investing in the ongoing production of the show.

41:41.000 --> 41:44.000
And when you're a booster, you're supporting that particular episode.

41:44.000 --> 41:46.000
You're supporting that particular release.

41:46.000 --> 41:51.000
You're showing us value for that particular episode.

41:51.000 --> 41:58.000
Memberships invest in the long term day to day production because it's not just a one day thing, you know, and that's amazing.

41:58.000 --> 42:00.000

42:11.000 --> 42:14.000

42:14.000 --> 42:18.000

42:18.000 --> 42:22.000
