00:00.000 --> 00:10.000
This is KOTOR Radio, episode 479 for August 15th, 2022.

00:10.000 --> 00:20.320
Hey, good buddy, welcome back to Jupiter Broadcasting's weekly talk show, taking a pragmatic look

00:20.320 --> 00:24.920
at the art and the business of software development and the world of technology.

00:24.920 --> 00:29.960
My name is Chris, and joining us fighting his old IRC client, it's our host, Mr. Dominic.

00:29.960 --> 00:30.960
Hello, Mike.

00:30.960 --> 00:36.240
She's an oldie, but she got me all the way across Route 66, all the way to Orleans, down

00:36.240 --> 00:37.800
to Tampa Way.

00:37.800 --> 00:41.600
That addium, it's old, reliable, just not working right now.

00:41.600 --> 00:42.600
It's working right now.

00:42.600 --> 00:47.920
So, I reopen it, it's like you already identified, I'm like, I know, thank you.

00:47.920 --> 00:51.720
IRC's old, it's old, it is.

00:51.720 --> 00:57.960
I think what happens, I didn't use this computer since last week's show, and all of my stuff

00:57.960 --> 00:59.280
is just popping up.

00:59.280 --> 01:00.280
You're not logged in.

01:00.280 --> 01:01.280
You're logged in.

01:01.280 --> 01:02.280
You're not logged in.

01:02.280 --> 01:03.280
It's like, yes.

01:03.280 --> 01:06.840
Now that we have the star power of Michael Dominic on our Matrix server, we might as

01:06.840 --> 01:08.860
well just migrate our chat over to Matrix soon.

01:08.860 --> 01:09.860
You know what I mean?

01:09.860 --> 01:11.800
We should, as soon as I authorize this machine.

01:11.800 --> 01:12.800
Yeah.

01:12.800 --> 01:16.760
Oh, I've been trying out Fluffy Chat, by the way, which is a pretty decent Matrix client

01:16.760 --> 01:17.760
as well.

01:17.760 --> 01:18.760
Ooh, Fluffy.

01:18.760 --> 01:19.760
Yeah.

01:19.760 --> 01:24.120
We'll have to run it by the union though, because it's already turned around on us.

01:24.120 --> 01:25.120
What was this?

01:25.120 --> 01:28.420
A month before having a mascot has completely derailed the show?

01:28.420 --> 01:29.660
It may be over after this.

01:29.660 --> 01:30.660
It may be over.

01:30.660 --> 01:35.320
At Coder Radio Show, from the official Coder Radio mascot, they write, I want to remind

01:35.320 --> 01:38.160
you both that we have strict labor laws in Europe.

01:38.160 --> 01:41.800
I don't think denying a mascot its vacation is legal.

01:41.800 --> 01:46.200
I consider founding the first podcast mascot union to make sure the podcast mascot's rights

01:46.200 --> 01:48.360
are respected and not eradicated.

01:48.360 --> 01:49.360
This is a threat.

01:49.360 --> 01:54.140
If we don't act, this is a threat, and they will launch a union, a Coder Radio union,

01:54.140 --> 01:55.680
and then you know where that leads.

01:55.680 --> 01:58.280
The show's costs are going to explode.

01:58.280 --> 02:00.160
It's not going to be profitable to do the show.

02:00.160 --> 02:01.160
We're going to have to end the show.

02:01.160 --> 02:05.640
Well, luckily, I called an old friend from the state department and she had an interesting

02:05.640 --> 02:06.640
thing to say.

02:06.640 --> 02:07.640
How quick are you on your soundboard?

02:07.640 --> 02:09.800
F*** the EU.

02:09.800 --> 02:12.640
But we do love Egon, our Coder Radio mascot.

02:12.640 --> 02:16.840
Yeah, but Newlin's going to come over there and clear things up, I would expect.

02:16.840 --> 02:18.240
But don't worry, she'll bring sandwiches.

02:18.240 --> 02:21.640
She's definitely not personally responsible for anything that's going on right now.

02:21.640 --> 02:23.720
No, definitely not directly responsible.

02:23.720 --> 02:24.720
No.

02:24.720 --> 02:28.080
You know, the thing about the Coder Radio mascot though, I thought maybe we could just

02:28.080 --> 02:31.520
buy him off with some air time, you know, because air time is valuable.

02:31.520 --> 02:34.080
So maybe if we just spent, you know what I'm saying, we'll just bribe him with some air

02:34.080 --> 02:35.080
time.

02:35.080 --> 02:36.080
We'll see.

02:36.080 --> 02:37.080
It's treacherous though, friends.

02:37.080 --> 02:40.840
If the if the show isn't here next week, it's because the union took us out.

02:40.840 --> 02:43.400
That's what we get for agreeing to a mascot.

02:43.400 --> 02:44.400
All right.

02:44.400 --> 02:47.920
We got some feedback into the show and I thought we'd cover all bits of it.

02:47.920 --> 02:52.800
Some of it I replied to directly, but I wanted to read a frustrated commuters feedback.

02:52.800 --> 02:56.920
Listening to last episode, I think there's a huge issue in the ideas about what the workplace

02:56.920 --> 03:01.360
is supposed to be and why the prospect of being in the office is so absurd.

03:01.360 --> 03:06.280
I live in the greater Sacramento area, but whereas I live in the lower west due to proximity

03:06.280 --> 03:10.860
to my family, most jobs are in the northeast.

03:10.860 --> 03:14.320
And as such, I have about an hour commute each way.

03:14.320 --> 03:20.080
I just started a job at a nationwide retailer and we do projects in stores across the country.

03:20.080 --> 03:23.880
I'll never touch a physical machine or a server as they're located in retail stores

03:23.880 --> 03:25.420
in the US and Canada.

03:25.420 --> 03:30.480
My direct supervisor recently received a special exemption to move to Tennessee and works completely

03:30.480 --> 03:31.480
remote.

03:31.480 --> 03:35.560
But I am required to be in the office eight hours a day, three days a week for now.

03:35.560 --> 03:41.200
But they say full time is on the horizon and we have an always on camera to validate.

03:41.200 --> 03:44.200
What's worse, I am not allowed to sign something to skip lunch.

03:44.200 --> 03:46.920
I have to clock out for an hour at least.

03:46.920 --> 03:50.380
And that means in my previous job, I gave them eight hours of my time per day.

03:50.380 --> 03:55.880
But now I have to give this company essentially eleven hours of my day and spend more money

03:55.880 --> 03:56.880
on fuel.

03:56.880 --> 04:01.240
I'm just less inclined to fit in with this culture working remotely, maybe.

04:01.240 --> 04:03.280
But I'm not there to make friends.

04:03.280 --> 04:05.140
This isn't a social club or a barbecue.

04:05.140 --> 04:09.800
If I'm meeting the expectations, then the culture fit shouldn't matter.

04:09.800 --> 04:12.940
The insistence on going back to the office is just unnecessary.

04:12.940 --> 04:16.720
It's often insulting as the people with the authority get the exceptions to keep enjoying

04:16.720 --> 04:21.120
the comforts of a remote workplace that they had during the pandemic, whereas rubes are

04:21.120 --> 04:24.680
now arguably paying the tax to sit in their AC.

04:24.680 --> 04:28.200
At the end of the day, I just can't help those three extra hours a day don't do anything

04:28.200 --> 04:30.820
to make me want to fit into the workplace.

04:30.820 --> 04:33.640
They just make me ponder my next contract.

04:33.640 --> 04:35.560
Frustrated commuter.

04:35.560 --> 04:38.240
Could you imagine the always on camera stuff?

04:38.240 --> 04:39.800
How awful that's getting now?

04:39.800 --> 04:41.880
Yeah, no, no, I don't.

04:41.880 --> 04:46.200
That's I really don't think that that's appropriate task of anybody.

04:46.200 --> 04:47.960
Like part of me says, well, go get a new job, man.

04:47.960 --> 04:49.160
If you don't like it, get a new job.

04:49.160 --> 04:51.360
Like that's how you vote with your you know, with your feet.

04:51.360 --> 04:55.400
But then I also understand it's not as always easy as that, depending on your industry and

04:55.400 --> 04:59.160
your work and, you know, financial situation.

04:59.160 --> 05:03.760
And the disturbing thing is, is The New York Times put out a pretty good piece just yesterday

05:03.760 --> 05:06.520
about the rise of worker productivity scores.

05:06.520 --> 05:13.600
And they're using all these automated tools, cameras, keyboard monitors, mouse monitors,

05:13.600 --> 05:19.400
input on the screen monitors, and they're then generating scores for the like manager

05:19.400 --> 05:23.320
to review them, to get an idea of like how hard they're working to basically collect

05:23.320 --> 05:25.400
data on what they're doing.

05:25.400 --> 05:31.360
And this New York Times article lays out like how it started at lower wage workers.

05:31.360 --> 05:34.220
But now it's lawyers, nurses.

05:34.220 --> 05:38.640
They talk about a hospice care provider who got one point for calling the family.

05:38.640 --> 05:42.240
She got another productivity point for like each patient she saw.

05:42.240 --> 05:45.760
They also have some quotes from some of the makers of this monitoring software saying

05:45.760 --> 05:48.280
that, you know, our data points aren't super accurate.

05:48.280 --> 05:52.560
They still need refinement and probably shouldn't be used for judging people's overall performance.

05:52.560 --> 05:54.680
And yet clearly it's happening.

05:54.680 --> 05:57.520
I mean, United Health seems like one of the bigger ones they talk on here, but they mentioned

05:57.520 --> 06:04.600
three or four different companies that are doing this with cameras, with activity monitoring.

06:04.600 --> 06:12.720
And they also talk about the rise of mouse jigglers, ads on TikTok and Instagram where

06:12.720 --> 06:17.180
you buy a mouse jiggler that you put on your desk and you set your mouse in the jiggler

06:17.180 --> 06:21.100
which randomizes input to make it look like you're busy.

06:21.100 --> 06:22.960
And they're selling like hotcakes right now.

06:22.960 --> 06:23.960
So okay.

06:23.960 --> 06:24.960
Right.

06:24.960 --> 06:31.380
This is where I'm somehow meditating on our mascots, shall we say pinko commie ways.

06:31.380 --> 06:36.920
And maybe I have been listening to some Ace of Base, so there's some Euro pop involved.

06:36.920 --> 06:41.500
But also like my evil capitalist is like, you can certainly demand that people come

06:41.500 --> 06:42.500
to the office.

06:42.500 --> 06:43.500
I think it's stupid.

06:43.500 --> 06:47.500
Like we talked about last week, if you're a small company like ours, right.

06:47.500 --> 06:53.000
But like this middle ground of I'm going to spy on you in your home, I just feel like

06:53.000 --> 06:57.560
that's, if you distrust the people that work for you that much, they shouldn't work for

06:57.560 --> 06:58.560
you.

06:58.560 --> 07:03.040
And speaking from the position of like small teams and small organizations where it's,

07:03.040 --> 07:05.200
you know how it is, Chris, it gets super personal, right?

07:05.200 --> 07:08.080
Like somebody has a kid, it's a big deal, right?

07:08.080 --> 07:15.360
Like it's, you know, I just, I can't imagine, I mean, I think we both know how I would react,

07:15.360 --> 07:20.960
but I can't even imagine asking someone to do that without feeling like a complete scumbag.

07:20.960 --> 07:23.040
Here's some of the justification.

07:23.040 --> 07:29.640
They say it gives them solid metrics and what they say, new found clarity.

07:29.640 --> 07:34.800
The New York Times goes on to write, derelict workers can be rooted out, industrious ones

07:34.800 --> 07:41.360
can be rewarded, quote, it is a way to really just focus on the results, end quote, rather

07:41.360 --> 07:43.380
than the impressions.

07:43.380 --> 07:48.520
So it's just this kind of spin of like, well, but the good employees get rewarded and it's

07:48.520 --> 07:53.400
only really the bad employees that get worked out, which the good employees appreciate too,

07:53.400 --> 07:54.920
so everyone wins.

07:54.920 --> 07:58.680
So basically the same justification of stack ranking.

07:58.680 --> 07:59.680
Yeah.

07:59.680 --> 08:00.680
And OKRs.

08:00.680 --> 08:04.800
I mean, it's stack ranking plus taping you, I guess.

08:04.800 --> 08:05.800
Yeah.

08:05.800 --> 08:06.800
God.

08:06.800 --> 08:07.800
You know what this is?

08:07.800 --> 08:09.320
I got, I got some bacon for you, buddy.

08:09.320 --> 08:10.320
Yeah.

08:10.320 --> 08:11.880
You ready?

08:11.880 --> 08:18.840
This is all a ploy by big hard drive to just sell more local storage because everybody's

08:18.840 --> 08:21.720
going to the cloud and they want to sell these hard drives.

08:21.720 --> 08:23.080
They've got, you know, these huge trucks.

08:23.080 --> 08:27.580
So big storage is colluding with software developers.

08:27.580 --> 08:30.080
It's Western Digital and Seagate.

08:30.080 --> 08:33.040
They got to sell big enterprise storage because you imagine like if you're monitoring all

08:33.040 --> 08:38.800
your employees, actually, let's be real, that's probably a cloud service, too.

08:38.800 --> 08:40.240
There's some SaaS vendor.

08:40.240 --> 08:44.600
So, you know, no offense, but there's some kids somewhere thinking, these guys are idiots.

08:44.600 --> 08:49.240
I'm going to make this SaaS right now or I just, yeah, it's making me physically ill.

08:49.240 --> 08:50.240
I understand.

08:50.240 --> 08:51.240
All right.

08:51.240 --> 08:53.280
Let's talk about something that gets people fired up.

08:53.280 --> 08:54.280
GitHub versus GitLab.

08:54.280 --> 08:59.800
And I want to make it clear that the GoToRadio program always recommends if you can host

08:59.800 --> 09:03.960
your own infrastructure, then nobody can just disable you or do weird stuff.

09:03.960 --> 09:04.960
Whatever.

09:04.960 --> 09:10.200
Well, yeah, I mean, I think we're coming to a new understanding.

09:10.200 --> 09:12.440
I think we're coming to a new middle ground.

09:12.440 --> 09:15.960
And Josh writes in, hey, guys, just finished 478.

09:15.960 --> 09:19.480
And I wanted to hype up GitHub over GitLab.

09:19.480 --> 09:22.680
One thing I love about GitHub is its VS code integration.

09:22.680 --> 09:25.920
If I get a bug report, I can view the report on the website.

09:25.920 --> 09:31.880
And by pressing my period, a web version of the VS code opens up with that repo pre-imported.

09:31.880 --> 09:36.620
I do a minor change, I push it out, and it's instantly updated without me ever leaving

09:36.620 --> 09:38.040
the repo web page.

09:38.040 --> 09:39.040
That's pretty great.

09:39.040 --> 09:41.000
I wanted to add my three cents.

09:41.000 --> 09:42.000
Josh.

09:42.000 --> 09:47.640
Yeah, I think the other thing that we kind of dance around, but is huge.

09:47.640 --> 09:52.160
If you want to do an open source project, ironically, it's going to be more successful

09:52.160 --> 09:56.320
on GitHub than on GitLab, in my opinion.

09:56.320 --> 09:57.640
It's a network effect.

09:57.640 --> 09:58.640
Simple as that.

09:58.640 --> 10:01.340
You know, we're doing the new JB website.

10:01.340 --> 10:05.760
And I think the fact that it's on GitHub has been a huge part of the success we're seeing

10:05.760 --> 10:06.760
with the project.

10:06.760 --> 10:11.600
Yeah, there's also the even like more grubby practical side of if you're someone pretty

10:11.600 --> 10:16.960
new in your career and looking to really make some aggressive jumps in your career.

10:16.960 --> 10:18.680
Recruiters now know about GitHub.

10:18.680 --> 10:20.960
And so do internal hiring managers.

10:20.960 --> 10:24.840
So if you have a nice beefy GitHub profile, that's going to go a long way.

10:24.840 --> 10:25.840
Good point.

10:25.840 --> 10:26.840
All right.

10:26.840 --> 10:27.840
We also got an email from Stoff.

10:27.840 --> 10:28.840
It was long.

10:28.840 --> 10:32.860
I think I'll link it in the show notes because it's about tabs or spaces, which you brought

10:32.860 --> 10:34.240
upon us.

10:34.240 --> 10:35.880
But I did pull a little bit of it.

10:35.880 --> 10:41.560
He wrote, essentially, tabs are idealistic and would win any argument not based on real

10:41.560 --> 10:44.600
world, quote, not caring of humans.

10:44.600 --> 10:46.660
But in reality, spaces win.

10:46.660 --> 10:51.280
But how many spaces is the better question?

10:51.280 --> 10:54.280
I wonder what the audience would say about two spaces.

10:54.280 --> 11:01.880
So, yeah, I'll put a link to this in the show notes and you guys can read the whole thing.

11:01.880 --> 11:08.640
He says an ideal world tabs, but in the real world spaces, and he just suggests two spaces.

11:08.640 --> 11:13.580
So we'll have a link to his whole email if you want to nerd out and see why he thinks

11:13.580 --> 11:17.000
two spaces is the one true way to go.

11:17.000 --> 11:18.920
Well, then you can let us know what you think.

11:18.920 --> 11:23.880
I will say most beautiful feature in Python, you don't have a goddamn choice.

11:23.880 --> 11:28.720
Reminder, meetups are coming next month.

11:28.720 --> 11:31.840
Right about this time that you're listening, things are going to be just getting started

11:31.840 --> 11:33.420
in Southern Oregon.

11:33.420 --> 11:39.800
So just super quick, Southern Oregon, September 20th, Northern California, September 23rd,

11:39.800 --> 11:45.520
JPL, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, September 29th, Southern California meetup around the

11:45.520 --> 11:51.640
JPL area, September 30th, and then October 7th, a Portland area meetup.

11:51.640 --> 11:53.560
It's a lot of meetups.

11:53.560 --> 11:58.120
Along the way, we'll be stashing some geocaches with swag in them, and then we'll give hints

11:58.120 --> 12:02.200
on the show where you can find the geocache, and then we'll also have swag on board JOOPS

12:02.200 --> 12:04.960
we'll be bringing to the meetups and all of that.

12:04.960 --> 12:10.660
So details are at meetup.com slash Jupiter Broadcasting, and I also invite you to join

12:10.660 --> 12:19.360
us in our matrix room, bit.ly slash West Coast Crew, where we're chatting about details,

12:19.360 --> 12:23.880
getting tips from locals, and then we'll also use that area for future meetups as well.

12:23.880 --> 12:25.280
There's a lot going on.

12:25.280 --> 12:27.480
I'll put a link to all of that in the show notes.

12:27.480 --> 12:34.200
If you're in the Western area of the United States, we'd love to see you.

12:34.200 --> 12:36.400
Linode dot com slash coder.

12:36.400 --> 12:40.200
That's where you go to get a hundred dollars for 60 days on a new account, and it's a great

12:40.200 --> 12:41.920
way to support the show.

12:41.920 --> 12:47.240
Linode offers just the best options for developers and businesses that don't need or want the

12:47.240 --> 12:52.080
complexities of hyperscalers and don't need all their endless options.

12:52.080 --> 12:56.720
And yeah, there's also budget VPS providers out there, but I just wouldn't mess with that

12:56.720 --> 13:00.720
stuff, not if it's something that matters, not if it's something that's for my business

13:00.720 --> 13:04.440
or my data is important or my availability is important or support's important if I ever

13:04.440 --> 13:05.440
get stuck.

13:05.440 --> 13:10.120
There's a lot of reasons to choose Linode, but their nearly 19 year track record has

13:10.120 --> 13:11.760
got to be one of them.

13:11.760 --> 13:16.840
Incredible uptime over that 19 years, always innovating on making the network faster and

13:16.840 --> 13:17.840
more capacity.

13:17.840 --> 13:21.800
They've got 11 data centers around the world for you to choose from, and then a bunch of

13:21.800 --> 13:27.720
really nice backend features that are just implemented nice and easily, like object storage,

13:27.720 --> 13:31.280
backups, simple snapshots, an API that goes for days.

13:31.280 --> 13:32.340
You can do all kinds of stuff.

13:32.340 --> 13:36.760
My favorite little hot tip is put the Linode command line client on your box and do a snapshot

13:36.760 --> 13:39.880
right there on your box before you make any changes.

13:39.880 --> 13:43.960
There's so many things though I love about Linode besides just the performance, the great

13:43.960 --> 13:44.960
support.

13:44.960 --> 13:48.800
There's also a huge community, and tons of my friends from open source projects around

13:48.800 --> 13:51.160
the world are using Linode.

13:51.160 --> 13:55.440
Linode sponsors a lot of the infrastructure for open source.

13:55.440 --> 14:00.160
And of course, Linode is making it possible for us to go on our west coast road tour this

14:00.160 --> 14:02.400
year to meet up with a whole bunch of you.

14:02.400 --> 14:06.480
So if you're in the area, make sure you come see us because we'll have some Linode swag

14:06.480 --> 14:08.320
on board that we're giving away.

14:08.320 --> 14:11.840
And I've been told it's very cool brand new swag.

14:11.840 --> 14:15.420
But on top of that, it's just the best place to run something on Linux.

14:15.420 --> 14:20.380
Don't get locked into those esoteric hyperscalers, don't get fooled by the budget VPS providers

14:20.380 --> 14:22.560
who will inevitably disappoint you.

14:22.560 --> 14:24.000
Go get the real thing.

14:24.000 --> 14:27.800
The folks that have been building for 19 years and only getting better and better as they

14:27.800 --> 14:28.800
do it.

14:28.800 --> 14:31.680
And why not get $100 while you try it?

14:31.680 --> 14:35.800
Support the show and get 100 bucks to try out Linode when you go to linode.com slash

14:35.800 --> 14:37.360
coder.

14:37.360 --> 14:38.360
One more time.

14:38.360 --> 14:43.040
It's linode.com slash coder.

14:43.040 --> 14:48.360
We may finally see a light at the end of the electron tunnel.

14:48.360 --> 14:51.760
I'm not saying electrons dead.

14:51.760 --> 14:56.280
But this might be a critical flaw that they can never solve.

14:56.280 --> 14:59.400
And maybe in a decade, it'll force people off of electron.

14:59.400 --> 15:00.400
I don't know.

15:00.400 --> 15:01.960
But you know, it's black hat season.

15:01.960 --> 15:06.160
So we're hearing about lots of exploits and researchers have found remote code execution

15:06.160 --> 15:12.600
vulnerabilities in basically all of the major electron based applications, Discord, teams,

15:12.600 --> 15:14.440
Slack, you name it, right?

15:14.440 --> 15:15.760
Surprise, surprise.

15:15.760 --> 15:17.400
And here's the core flaw.

15:17.400 --> 15:20.640
These particular issues they found have been patched.

15:20.640 --> 15:22.560
Some of these they found like a year ago.

15:22.560 --> 15:28.640
But the fundamental issue is, surprise, surprise, they write in the research, quote, this occurs

15:28.640 --> 15:32.180
because of the way ElectronJS is designed.

15:32.180 --> 15:38.560
And in the fundamental design issue within the framework, ElectronJS and Chromium that

15:38.560 --> 15:44.760
they've branched is always behind the main normal Chrome browser, i.e.

15:44.760 --> 15:51.700
Electron is always two or three months behind any upstream fix in Chromium at best.

15:51.700 --> 15:57.800
Then you have applications like Discord that are actually shipping a version of Electron

15:57.800 --> 16:00.200
that's been end of life for a while.

16:00.200 --> 16:04.520
And they're just like patching it like animals to keep it running.

16:04.520 --> 16:08.080
And they just will never be able to solve this problem because this is just the nature

16:08.080 --> 16:09.560
of the way this project works.

16:09.560 --> 16:11.440
It's downstream of Chromium.

16:11.440 --> 16:17.520
And they've changed it significantly enough that there is inherently a delay between when

16:17.520 --> 16:21.200
the bug fix goes out in Chromium and when it goes in your Electron app.

16:21.200 --> 16:24.320
And you know, the Discord developers, they try to jump in and say, look, when we found

16:24.320 --> 16:28.520
out about these vulnerabilities, we had it patched within like 42 hours.

16:28.520 --> 16:29.520
Like look at us.

16:29.520 --> 16:33.240
But you know, like, OK, you got one of probably hundreds of vulnerabilities.

16:33.240 --> 16:37.360
And it seems to me this is just inherent with Electron apps.

16:37.360 --> 16:38.360
There's no way around it.

16:38.360 --> 16:40.280
So not only is it not a great experience.

16:40.280 --> 16:44.400
Not only are we still not seeing the performance and memory usage that we'd like to see, it's

16:44.400 --> 16:45.520
still an issue.

16:45.520 --> 16:47.520
But now you have this fundamental way it's designed.

16:47.520 --> 16:50.160
It seems like this is always going to be a security issue.

16:50.160 --> 16:55.480
Do you think long term this could force people's hand to move to something else?

16:55.480 --> 16:57.600
Microsoft's working on Electron replacement.

16:57.600 --> 16:59.000
Don't know if it wouldn't have these problems.

16:59.000 --> 17:05.120
But if you could port, if you could move, if you think about the technologies being

17:05.120 --> 17:09.940
used here, it actually should be fundamentally possible to rip out the Chromium stuff from

17:09.940 --> 17:12.320
Electron and put something else in there.

17:12.320 --> 17:13.320
Yeah.

17:13.320 --> 17:18.160
So, OK, one, this is not going to stop people from using Electron.

17:18.160 --> 17:23.120
You're sacrificing a lot to use Electron to gain development speed and cross-platformness.

17:23.120 --> 17:28.520
I would definitely caution the dunking on Electron, especially from my Linux community,

17:28.520 --> 17:30.880
because you wouldn't have the applications without it.

17:30.880 --> 17:36.840
And that's just probably true of a lot of Mac applications, too, at this juncture now.

17:36.840 --> 17:42.300
With that all said, you could have we don't have it in the notes for this week, but there

17:42.300 --> 17:49.280
is a big post by the Dino team on how they're kind of probably moving further from Node

17:49.280 --> 17:50.280
for reasons.

17:50.280 --> 17:51.280
Right.

17:51.280 --> 17:52.280
We don't need to super go into it.

17:52.280 --> 17:57.440
It's not not a framework that I use a lot, but I could see something like that where,

17:57.440 --> 18:03.960
you know, whatever the Electron replacement is, is effectively a compatibility thing,

18:03.960 --> 18:08.400
and then eventually replaces it a good example of this on the mobile side, if you're doing

18:08.400 --> 18:14.920
cross-platform is Cordova, which is well deprecated and something like Capacitor, which does have

18:14.920 --> 18:20.740
Cordova backwards compatibility, i.e. you can use Cordova plugins.

18:20.740 --> 18:22.420
I don't know.

18:22.420 --> 18:24.960
And I'm usually like not Microsoft bacony.

18:24.960 --> 18:31.540
I am not sure that a Microsoft Electron replacement would necessarily be as different as maybe

18:31.540 --> 18:36.720
it sounds, because it would certainly be like an edge base, which is itself Chromium based.

18:36.720 --> 18:40.960
Now maybe edge and Chrome are going to diverge.

18:40.960 --> 18:43.440
That's certainly possible, right?

18:43.440 --> 18:48.380
Again, I just don't see this not being a problem based on anything that's architected like

18:48.380 --> 18:55.920
this, where you are modifying a very large, very complex upstream project, and you simply

18:55.920 --> 18:56.920
can't keep up.

18:56.920 --> 19:01.460
I mean, if anybody who's done mobile dev for a long time knows that all these cross-platform

19:01.460 --> 19:06.360
frameworks are beautiful, except like if you really, really want to be there day one and

19:06.360 --> 19:10.340
have like the hottest new Apple thing to try to get featured on the store, that becomes

19:10.340 --> 19:14.680
real touch and go in Dicey, and it goes the same for security stuff, right?

19:14.680 --> 19:20.600
When your project that you're dependent on is following at a lagging pace, not through

19:20.600 --> 19:25.520
any fault of their own, but through just the way stuff works, a upstream project, you're

19:25.520 --> 19:27.600
always going to have these things.

19:27.600 --> 19:34.160
And I don't think the value proposition that Electron or something Electron-like brings

19:34.160 --> 19:38.620
is ever going to be defeated at this juncture.

19:38.620 --> 19:42.540
Certainly not if the alternative is everything is either literally, I mean, I think the more

19:42.540 --> 19:48.120
likely scenario is people just run their web apps in actual Chrome, right, or edge, and

19:48.120 --> 19:49.120
maybe Safari.

19:49.120 --> 19:54.120
I mean, I prefer the Electron wrappers because I like the native notifications on both Mac

19:54.120 --> 19:55.120
and GNOME.

19:55.120 --> 19:57.760
And I like having it its own process, its own window.

19:57.760 --> 20:02.280
Right, because, you know, Squadcast likes to just take down your Chrome window, right?

20:02.280 --> 20:05.280
We use apps that like break browsers sometimes.

20:05.280 --> 20:10.400
That's what the developer and researcher of these flaws said, quote, if you're paranoid,

20:10.400 --> 20:15.120
I recommend using the website itself because then you have the protection of the latest

20:15.120 --> 20:16.120
Chromium.

20:16.120 --> 20:19.600
Also, it's sandboxing and all of that, which is much larger than Electron.

20:19.600 --> 20:23.160
So you could use a lot of these apps just in the browser and not use the Electron app

20:23.160 --> 20:26.000
and benefit from the more updated security in the browser itself.

20:26.000 --> 20:30.960
Yeah, I mean, I, you know, it would be not the worst idea.

20:30.960 --> 20:33.960
I just like my little Slack, you know, doc icon, right?

20:33.960 --> 20:36.720
I like to be able to, you know, tap around to the different applications.

20:36.720 --> 20:39.960
Well, and maybe this is something the operating system should be solving.

20:39.960 --> 20:44.080
You know, I think of like Fedora Silverblue and NixOS, which are immutable.

20:44.080 --> 20:48.720
And so even if, you know, the browser or the or Electron app just goes crazy and starts

20:48.720 --> 20:53.360
trashing your system, at best it could read your home directory, but it couldn't really

20:53.360 --> 20:55.160
make any permanent changes to the system.

20:55.160 --> 20:58.840
It couldn't install itself and run in the background after you reboot, it'd be gone.

20:58.840 --> 20:59.840
Right?

20:59.840 --> 21:00.840
Yeah.

21:00.840 --> 21:05.200
I mean, but how many years that people just run Flash and it didn't matter, right?

21:05.200 --> 21:06.200
And it was super obscure.

21:06.200 --> 21:11.640
I'm just saying the value prop from like you're an enterprise IT manager, you need to hire

21:11.640 --> 21:16.280
some dev shop or some contractor to write you an application.

21:16.280 --> 21:19.000
I mean, I would be more than happy to write you three.

21:19.000 --> 21:20.320
It'd be great.

21:20.320 --> 21:21.600
That sounds fun.

21:21.600 --> 21:26.360
The only thing I'll say maybe in defense of Microsoft having an alternative is they have

21:26.360 --> 21:29.360
done a hell of a job with VS Code.

21:29.360 --> 21:30.920
And Edge is pretty impressive.

21:30.920 --> 21:33.440
It's my day-to-day browser when I'm on POP.

21:33.440 --> 21:39.220
So I don't know, maybe their alternative would, what a world.

21:39.220 --> 21:43.620
So now your development tool chain is basically VS Code and your target environment becomes

21:43.620 --> 21:45.120
a Microsoft based framework.

21:45.120 --> 21:46.120
Yeah.

21:46.120 --> 21:47.120
And then you go run it on Azure.

21:47.120 --> 21:51.160
I was going to say, are we having flashbacks yet?

21:51.160 --> 21:54.680
Funny how all these roads lead to Azure.

21:54.680 --> 21:56.480
I wonder what the audience thinks.

21:56.480 --> 21:59.560
Here's what you said Flash, it's exactly what it made me think of.

21:59.560 --> 22:03.840
So let us know, coder.show slash contact or send us in a boost.

22:03.840 --> 22:06.280
I feel like this is its Flash moment.

22:06.280 --> 22:13.000
The very beginning of what took a decade is we started discovering fundamental issues

22:13.000 --> 22:17.160
that were obvious in some cases, but we just hadn't realized or in other cases we didn't

22:17.160 --> 22:18.160
know.

22:18.160 --> 22:20.520
We start discovering these just, oh man, there's no fixing this.

22:20.520 --> 22:22.760
Oh man, another one, there's no fixing this.

22:22.760 --> 22:24.320
And it took a decade of that.

22:24.320 --> 22:29.200
And at the end of that decade and a lot of help from Steve Jobs, we finally freed ourselves

22:29.200 --> 22:30.200
from Flash.

22:30.200 --> 22:31.200
Yes.

22:31.200 --> 22:37.240
When Uncle Steve took his double barrel shotgun and took old Flashy out behind the shed.

22:37.240 --> 22:41.360
Nobody wrote those blog posts or whatever, the open letter, whatever he called them.

22:41.360 --> 22:47.880
It's in terms of a tech CEO who could write in plain language and make you kind of understand

22:47.880 --> 22:50.560
their position.

22:50.560 --> 22:55.760
That Steve Jobs note on Flash, I think is, I don't think any other CEO in tech right

22:55.760 --> 22:58.840
now does something, anything like that.

22:58.840 --> 23:02.660
Musk does his own newer version, which really seems to piss people off, but Jobs did too

23:02.660 --> 23:03.660
I suppose.

23:03.660 --> 23:08.920
Yeah, but like, I don't know, Musk has not eliminated a basically web development standard.

23:08.920 --> 23:12.000
So I will say Flash, I had mixed feelings on what died.

23:12.000 --> 23:17.120
Adobe Air, which is probably the closer like analogy to Electron, and if you know what

23:17.120 --> 23:21.640
Adobe Air is, I am very sorry, really, really deserved to die.

23:21.640 --> 23:23.200
Oh yeah.

23:23.200 --> 23:25.720
Silverlight, that sure was a hot distraction.

23:25.720 --> 23:27.200
That was a hot mess.

23:27.200 --> 23:31.780
And remember running Netflix on Linux was, oh, you have to download this really shady

23:31.780 --> 23:33.360
mono version of Silverlight.

23:33.360 --> 23:35.160
Yeah, that was so bad, man.

23:35.160 --> 23:36.680
That was such a bad time.

23:36.680 --> 23:40.640
And you can't have 1080p because something, something codex, right?

23:40.640 --> 23:41.640
Like yeah.

23:41.640 --> 23:46.720
And it just felt like Microsoft wanted a piece of that hot Flash action, and so they created

23:46.720 --> 23:47.880
Silverlight.

23:47.880 --> 23:51.280
I feel like you just said Microsoft wanted to go through menopause.

23:51.280 --> 23:56.600
All right, I want to talk about something before we move on that I thought would be

23:56.600 --> 24:00.560
one story when it first broke, and this happened last week after the show.

24:00.560 --> 24:05.040
And then by the time we sat down to record, I have a totally different position on this

24:05.040 --> 24:06.040
story.

24:06.040 --> 24:10.040
Telegram went to war last week, and you and I both use Telegram a bit.

24:10.040 --> 24:16.880
The founder of Telegram took to his channel and just blasted the App Store review, saying

24:16.880 --> 24:22.300
that Apple is holding back technology that will, quote, revolutionize how people express

24:22.300 --> 24:24.160
themselves in messaging.

24:24.160 --> 24:29.160
He goes on to say, quote, it has been stuck in Apple's review for two weeks without explanation

24:29.160 --> 24:31.400
or feedback provided by Apple.

24:31.400 --> 24:37.240
Turns out there was some feedback, but he, he didn't disclose that at the time, but anyways,

24:37.240 --> 24:43.620
he goes on to say, quote, if Telegram, one of the top 10 most popular apps globally,

24:43.620 --> 24:49.200
is receiving this treatment, one can only imagine the difficulties expressed by smaller

24:49.200 --> 24:50.200
app developers.

24:50.200 --> 24:52.520
Wait a minute, where have I heard this before?

24:52.520 --> 24:58.640
It's not just demoralizing, it causes direct financial losses to hundreds of thousands

24:58.640 --> 25:01.920
of mobile apps globally.

25:01.920 --> 25:04.680
And he just put Apple on blast, right?

25:04.680 --> 25:05.760
So why did he go to war?

25:05.760 --> 25:06.880
What was it they were holding back?

25:06.880 --> 25:07.880
What was this new?

25:07.880 --> 25:10.120
They were censoring his ideological beliefs.

25:10.120 --> 25:11.120
Nope, nope.

25:11.120 --> 25:12.320
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

25:12.320 --> 25:15.880
They were demanding monies he was making outside of the App Store.

25:15.880 --> 25:20.840
The new revolutionary technology he was shipping was 3D emojis, and they were based on the

25:20.840 --> 25:27.200
Apple trademark emojis, and according to the App Store guideline 5.2.5, third-party developers

25:27.200 --> 25:32.640
cannot create apps that are confusingly similar to Apple's existing product, and in that guideline,

25:32.640 --> 25:37.760
Apple implicitly makes it clear you cannot replicate the Apple emoji design.

25:37.760 --> 25:40.320
And so that's why they were holding it up.

25:40.320 --> 25:42.200
So there's two very funny things here.

25:42.200 --> 25:49.300
One, there was some lawyer at Apple who was like, hang on, I love emoji, and we are defending

25:49.300 --> 25:52.240
this IP to the death.

25:52.240 --> 25:58.160
And then this guy, who I like Telegram, good product, is also like risking his own product

25:58.160 --> 25:59.880
because of emoji.

25:59.880 --> 26:03.120
Can't you just like use the Unicode ones?

26:03.120 --> 26:04.120
Or is it because they're 3D?

26:04.120 --> 26:10.040
Yeah, they had to, I guess, create new ones, but I, for me, it's the arrogance of saying

26:10.040 --> 26:13.920
this is a revolutionary new feature and how dare Apple, blah, blah, blah, blah, and it

26:13.920 --> 26:16.400
turns out to be animated emojis.

26:16.400 --> 26:21.520
And this, by the way, is part of a bigger story where Telegram is rolling out premium

26:21.520 --> 26:27.160
features, but the premium features they're rolling out suck, they're dumb, and nobody

26:27.160 --> 26:29.360
wants them, and it's wild.

26:29.360 --> 26:31.440
I've never really seen anything like this go down.

26:31.440 --> 26:32.880
Chris, this is a safe space.

26:32.880 --> 26:34.840
Tell us what you really think.

26:34.840 --> 26:41.260
If Telegram would have implemented status, so I could say I'm recording, or I'm away,

26:41.260 --> 26:46.320
or I'm traveling, I'm driving right now, kind of like you can do in Slack, if they would

26:46.320 --> 26:50.240
have implemented that in Telegram as a member feature, I'd pay nine bucks a month for that

26:50.240 --> 26:51.240
right there.

26:51.240 --> 26:52.880
You can't use Telegram, right?

26:52.880 --> 27:00.760
Instead, it's like stupid pictures and stickers and 3D emojis and just stuff that nobody wants,

27:00.760 --> 27:05.760
and I've really kind of been impressed because I've read different Telegram groups, I've

27:05.760 --> 27:11.160
read different Reddit posts on this, I've read different threads on reply comments like

27:11.160 --> 27:17.800
this article on 9to5Mac, and universally, universally, it's clear that the Telegram

27:17.800 --> 27:20.560
user base doesn't want any of this.

27:20.560 --> 27:22.560
It's all just stupid.

27:22.560 --> 27:27.000
It's a fascinating thing to watch, an app fall like this, because first they wanted

27:27.000 --> 27:30.360
to do some stupid crypto ICO scam.

27:30.360 --> 27:33.160
I was going to say, wasn't there like a weird crypto thing?

27:33.160 --> 27:37.200
That was a horrible idea and would have taken the app in a terrible direction, but because

27:37.200 --> 27:41.320
of regulatory concerns, they bailed on that because they got a big old warning on that,

27:41.320 --> 27:46.880
and so then they pivoted to membership, but the member features are so lame that nobody's

27:46.880 --> 27:51.080
going to sign up for this thing, and the cost to run this Telegram service, the storage

27:51.080 --> 27:55.520
alone, is astronomical.

27:55.520 --> 28:01.280
I'm told it's millions and millions and millions and millions of dollars a month, so I've never

28:01.280 --> 28:07.660
really witnessed an app blow this bad in a while, and then to also at the same time go

28:07.660 --> 28:15.060
to war with Apple over an obvious violation of their App Store guideline is essentially

28:15.060 --> 28:21.000
punching the person who feeds you in the face, because Telegram is nothing if it's not on

28:21.000 --> 28:22.720
iOS or on Android.

28:22.720 --> 28:30.500
It is absolutely totally dependent on these two major duopolies, and he's going off saying

28:30.500 --> 28:34.640
that they're holding back revolutionary new communications technology when it turns out

28:34.640 --> 28:38.920
he was ripping off their emojis, which maybe, you know, maybe should Apple be defending

28:38.920 --> 28:39.920
that?

28:39.920 --> 28:40.920
I don't know, but the guidelines, they make it clear.

28:40.920 --> 28:43.640
They specifically mention the emojis.

28:43.640 --> 28:47.360
You know, I'm always happy to dunk on the App Store review team.

28:47.360 --> 28:51.060
In this case, I'm like, ah, no, right?

28:51.060 --> 28:52.060
It's silly.

28:52.060 --> 28:56.160
I hate, like, K, K, oof, Kaepovic in the chat?

28:56.160 --> 28:57.160
KP.

28:57.160 --> 29:01.120
KP is saying in the chat, you know, basically they gave away most of the goods for free.

29:01.120 --> 29:03.600
I have a feeling that's kind of what's happening here.

29:03.600 --> 29:06.880
They need to monetize a bit more, and it's just real hard to do that.

29:06.880 --> 29:10.920
Well, I think it's clear it's hard to add new features, because instead what they're

29:10.920 --> 29:15.680
doing is they're giving you lipstick, and I want, like, new functionality.

29:15.680 --> 29:16.960
I want to pay for functionality.

29:16.960 --> 29:21.060
Like I said, one simple idea, status.

29:21.060 --> 29:22.060
Let me set a status.

29:22.060 --> 29:24.160
That's all I'm asking for.

29:24.160 --> 29:25.160
Let me set my status.

29:25.160 --> 29:27.760
I could see how that's simple to say and hard to implement.

29:27.760 --> 29:29.240
I bet there's all, yeah.

29:29.240 --> 29:31.120
Right, but that's why it's worth paying for.

29:31.120 --> 29:32.560
It's tough to make money on the App Store.

29:32.560 --> 29:37.000
I don't know, I feel like we've been, like, I like the indignation, but then the fact

29:37.000 --> 29:39.560
that it's about emoji, I'm kind of, you know.

29:39.560 --> 29:45.280
I guess this is my theme today, but I'm looking at this, I'm thinking, you look at his hostile

29:45.280 --> 29:51.640
relationship with the teat that feeds him, and you look at this totally boondockled membership

29:51.640 --> 29:57.460
rollout, and I think Telegram's going to have ads soon, Telegram's going downhill.

29:57.460 --> 29:58.960
It's time to leave, baby.

29:58.960 --> 30:02.640
Switch to Matrix, because I think Telegram, it's not tomorrow, but I think it's going

30:02.640 --> 30:03.640
to turn to crap.

30:03.640 --> 30:10.800
Or, you know, maybe IRC will just be the cockroach that survives and everything.

30:10.800 --> 30:13.080
Tailscale.com slash coder.

30:13.080 --> 30:17.040
My favorite part in the show right here when I get to tell you about Tailscale.

30:17.040 --> 30:20.140
Honestly, Tailscale, Tailscale, Tailscale.

30:20.140 --> 30:23.120
It's so great, I wish we could do every show about it.

30:23.120 --> 30:28.600
It's a zero-config VPN that installs on any device, regardless of architecture or platform,

30:28.600 --> 30:32.500
takes care of your firewall rules, takes care of your double-nats if you got some.

30:32.500 --> 30:40.480
You can quickly and easily create a flat mesh VPN protected by WireGuard's noise protocol.

30:40.480 --> 30:45.160
So you get the best VPN encryption in the business with the ease of management that

30:45.160 --> 30:47.480
Tailscale brings on top of that.

30:47.480 --> 30:49.020
It's the combination of these two things.

30:49.020 --> 30:53.560
It's like, Tailscale is taking VPNs out of the uncanny valley.

30:53.560 --> 30:58.240
You know, they're doing that last 10% that the rest of the world needed, and now I am

30:58.240 --> 31:02.800
seeing announcement after announcement of different projects that are integrated in

31:02.800 --> 31:03.800
Tailscale support.

31:03.800 --> 31:08.600
So you can put applications, individual applications and services, on your Tailscale network.

31:08.600 --> 31:13.480
It's so incredible because Tailscale is just this solution that, on its surface, seems

31:13.480 --> 31:15.080
immensely simple.

31:15.080 --> 31:20.160
But on the back end, they do a lot of really creative magic to make a mesh VPN network

31:20.160 --> 31:23.520
that just works all the time, and doesn't do silly routing when you're accidentally

31:23.520 --> 31:26.000
sending the wrong traffic over that VPN.

31:26.000 --> 31:30.320
And they introduce nice features like Tailscale Send, which is basically like AirDrop for

31:30.320 --> 31:32.320
your entire Tailscale network.

31:32.320 --> 31:36.160
And they've recently rolled out Tailscale SSH, which allows you to establish connections

31:36.160 --> 31:40.700
between your devices in your Tailscale network, authorized by the Tailscale controls, which

31:40.700 --> 31:41.700
are great.

31:41.700 --> 31:42.700
You can manage SSH.

31:42.700 --> 31:44.480
Well, you don't have to manage SSH keys.

31:44.480 --> 31:45.920
That's kind of the thing.

31:45.920 --> 31:51.360
Tailscale manages the SSH keys, and then it authenticates your SSH connection using WireGuard.

31:51.360 --> 31:55.640
Yes, like my two favorite things come together in Tailscale.

31:55.640 --> 31:58.000
There was a time before I synced my files, right?

31:58.000 --> 32:00.400
There was a time before I had broadband.

32:00.400 --> 32:04.160
There was a time before I had decent portability in a laptop.

32:04.160 --> 32:08.400
And now I'm going to look back and remember a time before I had Tailscale.

32:08.400 --> 32:10.380
That's the kind of game changer.

32:10.380 --> 32:13.320
That's the kind of workflow improvement you get with Tailscale.

32:13.320 --> 32:17.400
So the fact that you can go to tailscale.com slash coda right now, and try it for free

32:17.400 --> 32:21.800
up to 20 devices while you support the show, I don't know, kind of feels like peak awesome

32:21.800 --> 32:22.960
to me.

32:22.960 --> 32:26.900
This is one of those moments where a new technology comes around, and podcasting is around, and

32:26.900 --> 32:31.080
we all get to kind of just be in the same spot at the same time, and I'm very excited

32:31.080 --> 32:32.240
to watch this company go.

32:32.240 --> 32:35.000
And I very much recommend you try out Tailscale.

32:35.000 --> 32:37.080
I think you're going to be blown away.

32:37.080 --> 32:38.500
You'll never switch to any other VPN.

32:38.500 --> 32:39.500
This is it.

32:39.500 --> 32:40.500
You're done now.

32:40.500 --> 32:41.760
You've got yourself a flat mesh network.

32:41.760 --> 32:43.000
You're welcome.

32:43.000 --> 32:44.800
Tailscale.com slash coder.

32:44.800 --> 32:50.780
All right, well, here's where Apple's activity gets a little sketch.

32:50.780 --> 32:53.720
Here's a little mob boss to me.

32:53.720 --> 32:59.140
Reports are coming out from the Wall Street Journal that Apple contacted Facebook and

32:59.140 --> 33:02.960
wanted a little bit of cuts from some of their new services they were rolling out.

33:02.960 --> 33:07.560
They wanted a little taste back in 2016, like the promoted posts in Facebook.

33:07.560 --> 33:10.160
I just want to wet my beak, Mark.

33:10.160 --> 33:11.800
Just my beak, okay?

33:11.800 --> 33:13.160
It was interesting the way they did it.

33:13.160 --> 33:16.920
They say like, you know, we feel like we should be getting our 30% from this.

33:16.920 --> 33:19.400
Of course, Facebook pushes back on that.

33:19.400 --> 33:28.120
And it created what seems like this really sour relationship between Apple and Facebook.

33:28.120 --> 33:32.680
Yeah, I mean, sure.

33:32.680 --> 33:35.680
Nobody likes getting shaken down, even, you know, the bad guys.

33:35.680 --> 33:38.880
I've just, I don't know.

33:38.880 --> 33:44.380
Is it not pretty clear that in a slowing growth environment, Apple and most other big multinationals

33:44.380 --> 33:47.160
goal is to extract more revenue per user?

33:47.160 --> 33:50.160
So they wanted a share of the promoted ad sales.

33:50.160 --> 33:51.520
That okay, it doesn't surprise us.

33:51.520 --> 33:54.960
But to help put it in perspective, because you and I have talked about this so much that

33:54.960 --> 33:59.700
we're completely just it's all it's all sort of a hodgepodge now.

33:59.700 --> 34:03.240
But Ben Thompson did a decent little timeline in Sir Techery, which I'll have a link to

34:03.240 --> 34:04.240
in the show notes.

34:04.240 --> 34:06.400
But I grabbed a little bit of audio from his podcast.

34:06.400 --> 34:10.020
Apple had discussions with Facebook between 2016 and 2018.

34:10.020 --> 34:13.000
Apple had similar discussions with another ad supported company sometime before June

34:13.000 --> 34:14.360
2020.

34:14.360 --> 34:18.720
Apple systematically moved against consumer SaaS apps in 2019 and early 2020, halting

34:18.720 --> 34:21.520
updates unless they incorporated an app purchase.

34:21.520 --> 34:25.240
Apple blocked hay updates in May 2020 due to the lack of an app purchase.

34:25.240 --> 34:27.760
Apple announced AT&T in June 2020.

34:27.760 --> 34:32.800
One more relevant date, Apple unveiled its services narrative in January 2016.

34:32.800 --> 34:37.200
Taken as a whole, it is very hard to come up with any explanation beyond the obvious.

34:37.200 --> 34:40.360
Apple embarked on an aggressive campaign to boost its app store revenue.

34:40.360 --> 34:44.060
It started by looking for money from Facebook, the most obvious place to start giving Facebook

34:44.060 --> 34:46.340
symbiotic relationship with the app store.

34:46.340 --> 34:49.920
It extended that campaign to other ad supported apps, then started cracking down on consumer

34:49.920 --> 34:50.920
SaaS companies.

34:50.920 --> 34:55.080
Finally, it announced AT&T that kneecapped the entire ad supported app economy.

34:55.080 --> 34:59.600
So we remember when the AT&T stuff, the app tracking stuff landed.

34:59.600 --> 35:05.480
And now we have seen it's put huge, huge dampers on the sales of Facebook and others, billions

35:05.480 --> 35:06.480
of dollars.

35:06.480 --> 35:10.520
It's cost them billions of dollars, for better or for worse, who cares, right?

35:10.520 --> 35:12.240
But here's the interesting element.

35:12.240 --> 35:17.600
Bloomberg is reporting, Mark Gurman is reporting, that Apple is testing adding ads into maps,

35:17.600 --> 35:20.520
books, and podcast apps built into iOS.

35:20.520 --> 35:28.320
Mark, Mark, my son, that's such a nice ad generated business you have there.

35:28.320 --> 35:32.760
It'd be a shame if the platform vendor, I don't know, did their own ads, you know?

35:32.760 --> 35:37.280
Why don't you pay me a 30% and I am making sure this doesn't happen to you?

35:37.280 --> 35:39.080
Here's why this matters.

35:39.080 --> 35:43.200
This is, I think, a super strong signal and we have lots of links in the show notes.

35:43.200 --> 35:48.920
This is super strong signal about the iPhone sales collapse thesis that we had on the show

35:48.920 --> 35:50.060
a while ago.

35:50.060 --> 35:56.880
And that is, if the economy slows and luxury devices like iPhone sales begin to slow, Apple

35:56.880 --> 35:59.520
will have to seek revenue from other places.

35:59.520 --> 36:04.040
Apple is very careful in how they monitor the economy and they monitor sales and how

36:04.040 --> 36:05.600
they project all of this.

36:05.600 --> 36:07.400
And I'm sure they recognize this.

36:07.400 --> 36:11.120
In 2016, they announced their intention to focus on services.

36:11.120 --> 36:15.880
That's when they begin to shake down companies like Meta and Netflix and Amazon and small

36:15.880 --> 36:17.900
developers that we don't get to hear from.

36:17.900 --> 36:19.680
That's when the shakedowns begin to occur.

36:19.680 --> 36:25.000
They extract the maximum amount of revenue from people between 2016 and 2020.

36:25.000 --> 36:29.480
Then they launch the app tracking stuff that kills the revenue tracking for companies like

36:29.480 --> 36:30.480
Facebook and Google.

36:30.480 --> 36:31.480
Good.

36:31.480 --> 36:32.480
I don't care.

36:32.480 --> 36:37.280
Now, they're announcing, well, now they're not announcing, now they're testing doing

36:37.280 --> 36:38.800
their own ad platform.

36:38.800 --> 36:43.680
So they took away a huge part of the app ecosystem that developers use to monetize their apps

36:43.680 --> 36:45.340
because that's what we're talking about.

36:45.340 --> 36:47.600
That's what this tracking technology is used for.

36:47.600 --> 36:52.880
It's used to put ads in the apps to monetize the app to pay for development.

36:52.880 --> 36:53.880
That's what it's for.

36:53.880 --> 36:57.000
Sometimes it's Facebook and sometimes it's a small developer.

36:57.000 --> 37:01.840
Apple took that ecosystem away and now they're beginning to sell their own alternative and

37:01.840 --> 37:05.600
they're going to begin baking it into their own apps because the iPhone sales are going

37:05.600 --> 37:10.880
down and so they're going to monetize existing iPhone users by blasting ads in their face.

37:10.880 --> 37:15.420
I'm sure Apple will do it probably better than most, but the reality is they have first

37:15.420 --> 37:20.660
party access to that data so they can mine the results to do accurate ad serving and

37:20.660 --> 37:26.320
they're in a position to profit from a situation that they created.

37:26.320 --> 37:31.440
Now I think we have a pretty clear timeline of how all of this has gone down and it's

37:31.440 --> 37:33.160
hook, line, and sinker.

37:33.160 --> 37:35.080
This has been their motive all along.

37:35.080 --> 37:40.240
All of the smokescreen about privacy, it's all just been to sell this thing, to put them

37:40.240 --> 37:44.280
in this position, to be essentially their own dominant ad supplier.

37:44.280 --> 37:46.900
They don't want to give that action to anybody else.

37:46.900 --> 37:47.960
It's a power move really.

37:47.960 --> 37:54.600
They hobbled the ecosystem, they got everybody, basically they just bulldozed all of the real

37:54.600 --> 37:59.600
estate and now they're building their own Apple city on it and they already have people

37:59.600 --> 38:00.600
coming in.

38:00.600 --> 38:08.840
It's a remarkably savvy move, but it feels a little evil because they are using the pretense

38:08.840 --> 38:14.160
of protecting their users and Apple doing the best thing for their customers and privacy

38:14.160 --> 38:15.160
first.

38:15.160 --> 38:19.920
They're using that pretense to essentially do all of this and I find that gross.

38:19.920 --> 38:24.080
I didn't buy an iPhone to have ads in my apps.

38:24.080 --> 38:28.360
If I wanted that, I would have got an Android phone and I think ultimately, even if they're

38:28.360 --> 38:31.800
done in a subtle, clean way or whatever they're going to say.

38:31.800 --> 38:34.440
The tasteful way, is this the playboy of ads that we're going?

38:34.440 --> 38:35.440
Right.

38:35.440 --> 38:37.080
Yeah, they're going to do tasteful ads.

38:37.080 --> 38:43.920
Even if it's tasteful ads, it's still an $1,100 phone that has ads now.

38:43.920 --> 38:49.920
The transaction of $1,100 every year, every two years or every five years or whatever,

38:49.920 --> 38:55.520
that should be enough, but Apple is such a huge monster corporation now that they can't

38:55.520 --> 38:56.520
stop there.

38:56.520 --> 38:59.080
They can't stop and just sell you the hardware like that was the old deal.

38:59.080 --> 39:03.280
The old deal was Apple sells the hardware and then they don't have to worry about monetizing

39:03.280 --> 39:04.280
you after the fact.

39:04.280 --> 39:06.020
That's not true anymore.

39:06.020 --> 39:07.020
They're too big.

39:07.020 --> 39:08.020
They're too rich.

39:08.020 --> 39:11.520
They need more revenue and you're not making enough money to buy iPhones anymore, so they

39:11.520 --> 39:16.480
got to figure out another way to do it and that they've seen coming since 2016.

39:16.480 --> 39:19.800
They've been arranging all of this and if you don't think Apple is capable of that,

39:19.800 --> 39:22.320
I think you're underselling how savvy they can be.

39:22.320 --> 39:25.760
Gracie, Gracie, Gracie, my cousin, let me explain to you.

39:25.760 --> 39:29.320
I don't know which mob I'm supposed to be in now, but I like this voice and we're going

39:29.320 --> 39:31.320
to use it for a minute.

39:31.320 --> 39:37.040
You see, we have a Mr. Gigi Ping and a Mr. Joe Biden and they have what they call recession

39:37.040 --> 39:38.240
and they put me in box.

39:38.240 --> 39:44.780
I'm Russian now apparently and in box I need up to the right revenue at all times.

39:44.780 --> 39:50.840
So now I screw Mark Zuckerberg, which really, come on, look at that beautiful face.

39:50.840 --> 39:52.760
How could you resist?

39:52.760 --> 39:54.120
And I take all the ad money.

39:54.120 --> 39:56.680
What is wrong with this in Soviet Russia?

39:56.680 --> 39:58.720
We do this like on Tuesday, right?

39:58.720 --> 40:03.160
And I suppose if you're uploading a video on YouTube, you're using Google's ad platform

40:03.160 --> 40:07.040
and if you're on Android, you're likely going to use Google's ad platform.

40:07.040 --> 40:10.960
So it's just sort of what all the other platforms are doing.

40:10.960 --> 40:15.360
Is this like not the same as just saying you can't have streaming game services because

40:15.360 --> 40:17.760
we want to screw them out of 30 percent individually?

40:17.760 --> 40:20.200
So I mean, it's the exact same move.

40:20.200 --> 40:24.000
It's just well, there was part of me when I read this and again, we'll have the links

40:24.000 --> 40:26.120
to the Wall Street Journal and the others in the show notes.

40:26.120 --> 40:31.880
I read this and I thought, so Facebook aka Meta back in 2016 and 2017.

40:31.880 --> 40:32.880
It's still Facebook.

40:32.880 --> 40:33.880
Let's not give them that.

40:33.880 --> 40:34.880
They pushed back, right?

40:34.880 --> 40:38.560
And they're like, no, we're not going to give you a 30 percent cut of our promoted Facebook

40:38.560 --> 40:39.560
post.

40:39.560 --> 40:40.560
That's crazy.

40:40.560 --> 40:43.880
And I think in a way, this was Apple's response.

40:43.880 --> 40:48.040
All right, well, then we'll just crush your market on our devices, right?

40:48.040 --> 40:52.440
They're like, you either give us a cut or we're going to crush your market.

40:52.440 --> 40:57.160
The most valuable per user, you know, group of people you could possibly find.

40:57.160 --> 40:58.160
Yeah, it sucks.

40:58.160 --> 40:59.560
I mean, I don't know.

40:59.560 --> 41:01.680
I kind of wish everybody would lose here.

41:01.680 --> 41:02.680
Right.

41:02.680 --> 41:03.680
It's possible.

41:03.680 --> 41:06.480
Well, ultimately, you got to wonder, I mean, how does this play out?

41:06.480 --> 41:07.480
Right.

41:07.480 --> 41:10.960
I mean, Apple will get skewered for building it.

41:10.960 --> 41:12.040
They'll get skewered.

41:12.040 --> 41:13.920
But Google is going to be more scummy.

41:13.920 --> 41:14.920
Facebook's just awful.

41:14.920 --> 41:19.940
I mean, the truth is, they are going to be fine.

41:19.940 --> 41:21.240
This is going to work to a point.

41:21.240 --> 41:26.260
And if their ads are subtle enough, the only thing maybe is just the hardcore strong arming

41:26.260 --> 41:27.260
they do.

41:27.260 --> 41:28.840
They could get some regulation.

41:28.840 --> 41:31.080
But that's only from the mascot in the EU.

41:31.080 --> 41:34.240
That's never going to happen here.

41:34.240 --> 41:35.240
That's true.

41:35.240 --> 41:36.240
Maybe the EU will save us.

41:36.240 --> 41:40.520
Oh, God, I can't believe I'm saying that.

41:40.520 --> 41:42.800
Okay, I just can't.

41:42.800 --> 41:43.800
I don't know.

41:43.800 --> 41:44.800
I just can't even with this.

41:44.800 --> 41:48.520
Again, the Stratechery post that I'll have linked in the notes was really good.

41:48.520 --> 41:55.940
I wish that the M1 chips and I wish that the iPhone hardware and I wish that iOS wasn't

41:55.940 --> 41:59.400
better than all of the Android stuff.

41:59.400 --> 42:03.520
I wish it wasn't the case because I'd love to just put these mother effers in my rearview

42:03.520 --> 42:08.560
mirror and just laugh as they make these mistakes because I can clearly see where this is going.

42:08.560 --> 42:10.600
It's obvious where this is headed.

42:10.600 --> 42:13.280
It's been obvious since 2016 when they announced services.

42:13.280 --> 42:17.120
And I said it in the Dakota Radio the week they announced it that this is where it was

42:17.120 --> 42:19.240
going back in 2016.

42:19.240 --> 42:20.580
It's been obvious the entire time.

42:20.580 --> 42:26.080
But what we have now is we have the leaked emails and calls that shows us they actually

42:26.080 --> 42:29.200
did try to get a piece of the action.

42:29.200 --> 42:32.400
And when they didn't get their piece of the action, well, they played hardball and they

42:32.400 --> 42:33.400
ran them out of town.

42:33.400 --> 42:35.200
And now they're building in their spot.

42:35.200 --> 42:36.200
We just...

42:36.200 --> 42:37.200
Wow.

42:37.200 --> 42:39.760
I mean, I'm pretty sure that's basically what happens if anything gets big enough on the

42:39.760 --> 42:40.760
App Store.

42:40.760 --> 42:41.760
Right?

42:41.760 --> 42:42.760
First, they come to you with a smile.

42:42.760 --> 42:44.680
There's another Bob movie reference.

42:44.680 --> 42:49.160
And then they, you know, they put a dead fish in your bed or a horse head or whichever you

42:49.160 --> 42:50.160
prefer.

42:50.160 --> 42:51.160
I mean, you know what it makes that?

42:51.160 --> 42:52.160
It makes Sherlocking quaint.

42:52.160 --> 42:54.400
It was like quaint when Apple would Sherlock you.

42:54.400 --> 42:57.800
Oh, Sherlocking was like accidental killing of third party utilities.

42:57.800 --> 42:58.800
This...

42:58.800 --> 42:59.800
Or maybe not.

42:59.800 --> 43:00.800
Yeah.

43:00.800 --> 43:01.800
Now they will just devastate a market for you.

43:01.800 --> 43:05.280
They'll just bulldoze the entire thing.

43:05.280 --> 43:08.360
You could say they're the new Microsoft in a lot of ways.

43:08.360 --> 43:09.360
Boost to Graham.

43:09.360 --> 43:10.360
All right.

43:10.360 --> 43:11.360
Well, I got to...

43:11.360 --> 43:12.360
We got to turn things around.

43:12.360 --> 43:14.120
So thank you everybody who sends in a boost.

43:14.120 --> 43:19.640
We're doing 2000 sats and above to get read on the show, but we read 100 percent of them.

43:19.640 --> 43:23.400
And Zurno sent in a boost with 2020 sats.

43:23.400 --> 43:25.480
He says, I fixed my username now.

43:25.480 --> 43:27.720
I was Magenta Eagle last time.

43:27.720 --> 43:31.180
And he's got a note for anybody who wants to troll Mike in the future because he made

43:31.180 --> 43:33.120
this mistake and he's passing it along.

43:33.120 --> 43:37.240
Make sure you realize and understand Mike's licensing preferences first.

43:37.240 --> 43:39.520
Otherwise, he may just end up agreeing with you.

43:39.520 --> 43:40.520
Ha ha.

43:40.520 --> 43:41.520
You got him.

43:41.520 --> 43:44.000
You didn't even mean to and you got him.

43:44.000 --> 43:46.680
We got a double boost from Zurno, too.

43:46.680 --> 43:51.080
Could you take a moment away from relevant languages and talk about how the original

43:51.080 --> 43:56.040
roller coaster tycoon was 99 percent x86 assembly?

43:56.040 --> 43:57.960
Who says assembly is not relevant?

43:57.960 --> 43:59.920
I am a ROM fan.

43:59.920 --> 44:06.200
So I have like a bunch of Super Nintendo and SNES or NES ROMs and they're so small.

44:06.200 --> 44:08.720
They're so tiny.

44:08.720 --> 44:12.880
It's incredible how how fun those games are like Super Mario World in just such a tiny

44:12.880 --> 44:14.080
amount of space.

44:14.080 --> 44:16.440
Some really good YouTube watching it.

44:16.440 --> 44:21.040
There's some videos that talk about the crazy ass tricks that developers had to pull off

44:21.040 --> 44:23.760
to get stuff running on boxes that low end.

44:23.760 --> 44:26.600
It's it's a really good read if you're if you're into it.

44:26.600 --> 44:27.600
All right.

44:27.600 --> 44:33.120
We got a boost from wooden 501 coming in hot with the blue 3000 sats.

44:33.120 --> 44:38.400
Can we talk about GitHub's absolutely trash, nonexistent ability to organize your repos?

44:38.400 --> 44:41.900
I don't want a massive flat list of repos that I have to search through via typing or

44:41.900 --> 44:46.880
scrolling every time I want to find that one repo, I need to take a look at it real quick.

44:46.880 --> 44:50.880
That is the sole reason I decided to use the free GitLab service instead of GitHub for

44:50.880 --> 44:52.920
my personal projects.

44:52.920 --> 44:55.880
I also have a little bit of complaints about the organization.

44:55.880 --> 44:59.840
Yeah, this feels this has always been a problem at GitHub why they don't have a way to group

44:59.840 --> 45:04.320
your repos by like, you know, customer overarching project.

45:04.320 --> 45:08.800
I have to think there's something deep in the data model there where they just screwed

45:08.800 --> 45:13.280
themselves into a corner, because effectively their version of this is organizations.

45:13.280 --> 45:17.160
But like you might have one organization where you let's say manage I don't know all your

45:17.160 --> 45:21.720
clients as code, right and you would want subgroups.

45:21.720 --> 45:26.160
Yeah, that's it's just bad.

45:26.160 --> 45:33.760
The handsome and happy to hear listening Dave Jones, the pod sage boost in 5000 sats.

45:33.760 --> 45:35.440
Great work on the work from home discussion.

45:35.440 --> 45:36.440
I loved it.

45:36.440 --> 45:37.440
Well, thank you pod sage.

45:37.440 --> 45:38.840
I'm glad you're listening.

45:38.840 --> 45:40.680
Marcel boosts in with 3030 sats.

45:40.680 --> 45:42.160
Oh, you know what?

45:42.160 --> 45:43.160
That's the dirty 30s.

45:43.160 --> 45:45.480
Yeah, that's the Kool-Aid man.

45:45.480 --> 45:48.160
I forgot to boost in about why I use vim.

45:48.160 --> 45:50.360
And nobody's mentioned it modal editing.

45:50.360 --> 45:51.360
It's killer.

45:51.360 --> 45:56.240
I get the same language services vs code, but it's extensible when I need it.

45:56.240 --> 46:02.560
I made a command to convert do I latex code using do I to dib.org.

46:02.560 --> 46:03.560
It saved me so much time.

46:03.560 --> 46:07.760
You know what he had he actually used it for hundreds of articles he said you're not going

46:07.760 --> 46:09.400
to find it in the app store though.

46:09.400 --> 46:11.680
Also tabs fight me.

46:11.680 --> 46:13.400
Yeah, all right.

46:13.400 --> 46:16.840
Good news is that's our only vim boost as far as I know, right?

46:16.840 --> 46:18.560
We also got a few more emails in.

46:18.560 --> 46:22.200
I'm just responding to people directly now on that particular topic.

46:22.200 --> 46:31.000
I think everybody will understand why we got 8000 sats from mollusk.

46:31.000 --> 46:34.000
He says have either of you tried out the nim programming language?

46:34.000 --> 46:39.760
I think it's actually pretty nice as a nice bounce of features borrowed from other languages.

46:39.760 --> 46:46.000
I went to go look it up on the stack exchange developer ranking thing, you know, and not

46:46.000 --> 46:47.400
even on the list.

46:47.400 --> 46:52.540
But nim is a general purpose, multi paradigm, statically typed, compiled systems programming

46:52.540 --> 46:53.540
language.

46:53.540 --> 46:58.960
It was created to be as fast as C, as expressive as Python, and as extensible as Lisp.

46:58.960 --> 47:05.160
It started 14 years ago and obviously influenced by Python, Rust, even C++ and others.

47:05.160 --> 47:06.160
It looks very Pythonic.

47:06.160 --> 47:07.160
Yes.

47:07.160 --> 47:08.160
Oh, yeah.

47:08.160 --> 47:10.800
Did you just make that up?

47:10.800 --> 47:11.800
That's awesome.

47:11.800 --> 47:14.920
No, I've read it in some I think I read it in one of those Manning books or I made it

47:14.920 --> 47:15.920
up.

47:15.920 --> 47:16.920
I'm taking credit.

47:16.920 --> 47:17.920
I think you should.

47:17.920 --> 47:18.920
That's mine now.

47:18.920 --> 47:19.920
Yeah.

47:19.920 --> 47:22.520
Noob Steve boosted him with 4444 sats.

47:22.520 --> 47:23.520
I'm with Mike.

47:23.520 --> 47:26.280
Hashtag free Oona best email of the week.

47:26.280 --> 47:28.120
Yeah, that I agree with.

47:28.120 --> 47:33.240
I'm hoping that's going to be a, you know, a multi episode arc, but not too long.

47:33.240 --> 47:35.400
Also, I love the Orville and Discovery.

47:35.400 --> 47:36.400
I know I'm a nerd.

47:36.400 --> 47:39.640
I'm just happy to see new side new sci fi, even if it is flawed.

47:39.640 --> 47:43.880
I completely agree with your assessment, though, about Seth, even though I do love his humor.

47:43.880 --> 47:47.760
Yeah, I don't think he makes a great captain was basically my I think if he wasn't rich

47:47.760 --> 47:51.800
and famous and responsible, he actually follows up with exactly that point.

47:51.800 --> 47:52.800
Wow.

47:52.800 --> 47:53.800
Oh, yeah, he does.

47:53.800 --> 47:54.800
You're right.

47:54.800 --> 47:55.800
He's Yeah, sorry.

47:55.800 --> 47:56.800
Double boost.

47:56.800 --> 47:57.800
You're right.

47:57.800 --> 47:58.800
I agree with it.

47:58.800 --> 47:59.800
His humor.

47:59.800 --> 48:00.800
He's definitely not the best actor.

48:00.800 --> 48:02.720
And I agree with your assessment of Discovery.

48:02.720 --> 48:05.360
It was exceptionally hard for me to swallow the whole mushroom thing.

48:05.360 --> 48:06.360
Oh, yeah.

48:06.360 --> 48:07.360
OK.

48:07.360 --> 48:08.360
All right.

48:08.360 --> 48:11.960
Also, Paul Stamets is also the guy that's like famous for being a big mushroom guy.

48:11.960 --> 48:14.320
So they named the engineer after the real Paul Stamets.

48:14.320 --> 48:18.760
But that's kind of weird that, you know, I don't know, kind of takes me out of it sometimes.

48:18.760 --> 48:21.320
But like me, he says he watches it because it's Trek.

48:21.320 --> 48:24.160
Oh, he's also a member who boosts as well.

48:24.160 --> 48:25.160
Wow.

48:25.160 --> 48:26.720
That that is awesome.

48:26.720 --> 48:31.320
Trev Dev, who has been behind on podcasts but is staying current on Coder Radio because

48:31.320 --> 48:32.840
he boosts other shows I listen to.

48:32.840 --> 48:39.680
So I know he's been falling behind, but listening every single week with ten thousand sacks.

48:39.680 --> 48:42.440
He says I will make one argument for tabs.

48:42.440 --> 48:46.560
Tabs make it so that people with accessibility like vision issues are able to set the tab

48:46.560 --> 48:50.240
with as a smaller size.

48:50.240 --> 48:54.440
This way, they are able to do all of the code with large font sizes and not have to reformat

48:54.440 --> 48:56.640
every buffer they work on twice.

48:56.640 --> 49:00.400
Everyone else can just use the tab size of four to eight columns and carry on.

49:00.400 --> 49:02.960
Other than that, who gives a fark?

49:02.960 --> 49:05.960
Do whatever the project or language standards call for.

49:05.960 --> 49:07.240
Very reasonable.

49:07.240 --> 49:09.260
That's a very reasonable idea.

49:09.260 --> 49:11.920
Lower third Chiron boosts in with a row of ducks.

49:11.920 --> 49:12.920
Thank you kindly.

49:12.920 --> 49:16.320
Two hundred and twenty two thousand, two hundred and twenty two sacks.

49:16.320 --> 49:19.780
Just boosting to say that I love the chat about Star Trek when it comes to discovery.

49:19.780 --> 49:22.280
It's a real Mario and Luigi situation.

49:22.280 --> 49:23.280
I don't know what that.

49:23.280 --> 49:24.280
I don't know.

49:24.280 --> 49:25.280
I don't know.

49:25.280 --> 49:26.280
He says it all the time.

49:26.280 --> 49:27.680
Star Trek is Star Trek after all.

49:27.680 --> 49:28.680
Keep up the good work.

49:28.680 --> 49:29.680
Yeah.

49:29.680 --> 49:30.680
Yeah.

49:30.680 --> 49:32.520
Follow up on whatever the hell that means.

49:32.520 --> 49:33.760
I'm going to use it, though.

49:33.760 --> 49:36.640
Yeah, that's a real Mario and Luigi situation.

49:36.640 --> 49:39.260
You just don't even know.

49:39.260 --> 49:40.920
It sounds like something, though, doesn't it?

49:40.920 --> 49:42.720
It sounds very mean.

49:42.720 --> 49:43.720
Yeah.

49:43.720 --> 49:44.720
OK.

49:44.720 --> 49:45.800
Thornton, Maryland, boosted in.

49:45.800 --> 49:47.600
This old duck still got it.

49:47.600 --> 49:49.040
With a row of ducks.

49:49.040 --> 49:51.080
Two thousand, two hundred and twenty two sacks.

49:51.080 --> 49:54.880
We all know environment concerns are about controlling people and not really about the

49:54.880 --> 49:55.880
environment.

49:55.880 --> 50:01.400
And keep keeping people at home isn't part of the agenda, I guess.

50:01.400 --> 50:05.280
Also, apps are sold on the Steam Linux platform, but it's just mostly games pointing out that

50:05.280 --> 50:08.040
there is an app store, a universal app store for Linux.

50:08.040 --> 50:10.160
They do have some apps on Steam for Linux.

50:10.160 --> 50:11.160
Yeah, I don't know.

50:11.160 --> 50:14.960
I don't know if I agree with the sentiment about I think if you were really if it was

50:14.960 --> 50:17.880
controlling people was really about the environment, they would be keeping them home.

50:17.880 --> 50:20.000
That's the only thing about their thorn that I don't know if I agree.

50:20.000 --> 50:22.240
I think that's that's the thing.

50:22.240 --> 50:26.480
Mr. Quackers boosted in with a row of ducks, our last boost of the week.

50:26.480 --> 50:28.880
Two thousand, two hundred and twenty two sacks.

50:28.880 --> 50:29.880
Quacka Wacka.

50:29.880 --> 50:30.880
It's a treasure.

50:30.880 --> 50:31.880
Yippee.

50:31.880 --> 50:35.440
Says I'm not a very good programmer, but I've been learning Rust for about two years and

50:35.440 --> 50:37.520
it's been very fun to learn.

50:37.520 --> 50:41.000
But actually writing code with it has been a huge challenge.

50:41.000 --> 50:42.000
Ah, yes.

50:42.000 --> 50:43.000
And not fun.

50:43.000 --> 50:44.880
I'm sorry to hear that Quackers.

50:44.880 --> 50:49.680
He goes on to say, for the project I'm working on, I finally gave up and I learned to go.

50:49.680 --> 50:50.680
Interesting choice.

50:50.680 --> 50:55.280
Twenty years and I feel I'm at the level I was after two years of Rust.

50:55.280 --> 51:01.320
I miss Rust compiler errors and cargo, but otherwise I've been so much happier.

51:01.320 --> 51:03.400
I think we've heard that sentiment from the audience, too.

51:03.400 --> 51:04.400
Well, good.

51:04.400 --> 51:05.400
Yeah.

51:05.400 --> 51:06.400
Rust is super strict.

51:06.400 --> 51:07.400
Right.

51:07.400 --> 51:10.520
So if that's not for you, then, yeah, go is a good alternative.

51:10.520 --> 51:14.960
And if you really want to go cray cray, just go C plus plus and give up on reality and

51:14.960 --> 51:15.960
time and space.

51:15.960 --> 51:20.040
Hey, remember that assemblies out there to a couple of call outs.

51:20.040 --> 51:25.880
Golden Dragon boosted in just under the 2000 sat limit to just give some nano love.

51:25.880 --> 51:29.680
And we also got a thousand stats from old Trecker who said, I love me some strange new

51:29.680 --> 51:32.040
worlds, but I must say it.

51:32.040 --> 51:34.720
Auroville New Horizons is the best Trek show.

51:34.720 --> 51:35.960
What is happening?

51:35.960 --> 51:40.480
I can't even I can't even you cannot objectively watch the Orville in strange new worlds and

51:40.480 --> 51:42.760
tell me the Orville is a better show.

51:42.760 --> 51:44.080
It's so bonk bonk on the nose.

51:44.080 --> 51:47.680
I do think sometimes the effects are pretty good.

51:47.680 --> 51:49.080
Come on, guys.

51:49.080 --> 51:50.280
Come on.

51:50.280 --> 51:55.160
Orville just feels it's like a really super well done Trek fan series.

51:55.160 --> 51:58.800
Speaking of the fans, should we mention the discussion we were having?

51:58.800 --> 51:59.800
Yeah.

51:59.800 --> 52:00.800
Which one?

52:00.800 --> 52:01.800
Tell me.

52:01.800 --> 52:04.600
Switching back to a noon time on the eastern time zone.

52:04.600 --> 52:05.600
Oh, right.

52:05.600 --> 52:06.600
Thank you.

52:06.600 --> 52:10.240
We last week we tried out doing Coder earlier at 9 a.m.

52:10.240 --> 52:11.240
Pacific, was it?

52:11.240 --> 52:12.240
Yeah.

52:12.240 --> 52:13.240
Noon Eastern.

52:13.240 --> 52:14.240
And then noon Eastern.

52:14.240 --> 52:15.240
Yeah.

52:15.240 --> 52:17.320
And I think we had a pretty good attendance in the chat room.

52:17.320 --> 52:22.100
And so we wanted to put it out there as just a bit of feedback from you guys were asking

52:22.100 --> 52:23.100
for it.

52:23.100 --> 52:24.640
Would you like us to do a little bit earlier?

52:24.640 --> 52:28.400
Because I think we both could accommodate that.

52:28.400 --> 52:32.560
And if it's better for people's lifetimes and we can get even more live folks, that'd

52:32.560 --> 52:33.560
be great.

52:33.560 --> 52:38.600
So you can go to Coder dot show slash contact or you can boost in your ideas, messages,

52:38.600 --> 52:41.760
feedback with a new podcast app at new podcast apps dot com.

52:41.760 --> 52:45.020
And of course, you can always join us live and just tell us stuff real time, give us

52:45.020 --> 52:49.040
real time feedback in that chat room, which we got going on right now or hit us up on

52:49.040 --> 52:50.040
that matrix server.

52:50.040 --> 52:51.040
Yeah.

52:51.040 --> 52:52.040
Oh, right.

52:52.040 --> 52:53.040
Geez, you're on it today, dude.

52:53.040 --> 52:57.640
We have we also have a Coder Radio feedback in general discussion rooms, two different

52:57.640 --> 53:00.600
Coder rooms on our matrix server.

53:00.600 --> 53:02.480
And the conversation is great in there as well.

53:02.480 --> 53:04.440
And that's a great place to give us feedback as well.

53:04.440 --> 53:07.640
And you don't got to worry about what Telegram's doing.

53:07.640 --> 53:11.040
Now, OK.

53:11.040 --> 53:13.600
Also big thank you to our Coder QA team out there.

53:13.600 --> 53:15.240
You guys keep us independent.

53:15.240 --> 53:18.700
You keep us focused on our audience and you let us be choosy about the advertisers we

53:18.700 --> 53:19.720
work with.

53:19.720 --> 53:22.460
Those are fundamentals that make the show what it is.

53:22.460 --> 53:25.280
So thank you for your support at Coder QA dot co.

53:25.280 --> 53:26.280
The Coderly is up there.

53:26.280 --> 53:27.760
We put one up every quarter.

53:27.760 --> 53:31.420
And of course, you also get an ad free version of the show as a thank you.

53:31.420 --> 53:34.920
And you know, I don't know, Coder QA dot co.

53:34.920 --> 53:35.920
Thank you.

53:35.920 --> 53:36.920
Thank you, members.

53:36.920 --> 53:37.920
We're working on a bat line.

53:37.920 --> 53:39.160
We're working on new features for that as well.

53:39.160 --> 53:43.560
But website and road trip are my current priorities outside of the regular show production.

53:43.560 --> 53:45.120
And then we'll be checking stuff off.

53:45.120 --> 53:48.440
And don't forget to go check out that new website and give us your feedback.

53:48.440 --> 53:52.120
New URL, new dot Jupiter Broadcasting dot com.

53:52.120 --> 53:56.680
And then we have a Jupiter Broadcasting com GitHub repo where you can open up issues and

53:56.680 --> 53:58.360
do poll requests and whatnot.

53:58.360 --> 54:02.720
But go try out the new website and tell us your feedback because it's just a few weeks

54:02.720 --> 54:04.720
away from going live.

54:04.720 --> 54:07.840
One of the things I've been doing and our crew has been doing and maybe you could start

54:07.840 --> 54:12.140
doing out there, dear audiences, maybe start using it as your regular way to get the podcast

54:12.140 --> 54:13.360
to tune into the live stream.

54:13.360 --> 54:17.320
You can go to new dot Jupiter Broadcasting dot com and play around with everything.

54:17.320 --> 54:20.120
Find the issues and let us know what's going on so we can get it all fixed up before we

54:20.120 --> 54:21.800
flip that into production.

54:21.800 --> 54:27.160
Mr. Dominic, is there anywhere you want to send the peeps before we just add to Manu

54:27.160 --> 54:31.800
co on Twitter and Alice dot to have you got to check out that Alice dot dev guys, you

54:31.800 --> 54:32.800
got to go check it out.

54:32.800 --> 54:34.120
Well, we mentioned the live time.

54:34.120 --> 54:36.280
We'd love to have you join us on a Monday for right now.

54:36.280 --> 54:37.880
It's noon Pacific, three p.m. Eastern.

54:37.880 --> 54:41.720
But based on your feedback, we might move that up a few notches.

54:41.720 --> 54:44.600
You can find the show on the Twitter's at Coder Radio show.

54:44.600 --> 54:45.600
I'm at Chris LAS.

54:45.600 --> 54:47.360
I'm also on the matrix.

54:47.360 --> 54:48.360
Chris LAS.

54:48.360 --> 54:49.360
Funny how that works.

54:49.360 --> 54:50.360
Huh?

54:50.360 --> 54:51.360
Links to what we talked about today.

54:51.360 --> 54:56.480
Coder dot show slash four seven nine to find our contact feed there, as well as our RSS

54:56.480 --> 54:57.480
and subscribe links.

54:57.480 --> 54:58.720
You can get the show every single week.

54:58.720 --> 55:00.600
We appreciate it when you do that.

55:00.600 --> 55:04.240
Thanks so much for joining us on this week's episode of the Coder Radio program, and we'll

55:04.240 --> 55:14.560
see you right back here next week.
