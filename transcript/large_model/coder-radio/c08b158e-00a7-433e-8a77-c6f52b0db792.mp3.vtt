00:00.000 --> 00:15.720
This is Kota Radio, episode 403 for March 1st, 2021.

00:15.720 --> 00:19.480
Hello there and welcome in to Jupiter Broadcasting's weekly talk show, taking a pragmatic look

00:19.480 --> 00:24.920
at the art and the business of software development in the world of technology.

00:24.920 --> 00:26.920
This episode is brought to you by a Cloud Guru.

00:26.920 --> 00:29.000

00:37.840 --> 00:43.520
My name is Chris, and joining us like the podcasting pioneer that he is for 403 episodes,

00:43.520 --> 00:45.280
it's our host, Mr. Dominic.

00:45.280 --> 00:46.280
Hello, Mike.

00:46.280 --> 00:47.840
Oh, I'm chilly, Chris.

00:47.840 --> 00:48.840
Really?

00:48.840 --> 00:49.840
In Florida?

00:49.840 --> 00:51.420
In Florida, it's ice cold.

00:51.420 --> 00:56.520
We have Mr. Freeze is here just blasting us with his ice gun.

00:56.520 --> 00:57.520
Uh-huh.

00:57.520 --> 00:59.080
It's like 60 degrees Fahrenheit.

00:59.080 --> 01:00.080
What is it?

01:00.080 --> 01:02.760
It's like 70, but I have a solution to my plight.

01:02.760 --> 01:03.760
Okay, good.

01:03.760 --> 01:12.720
A way to both warm up my body, my soul, my general spirits, and improve my objective

01:12.720 --> 01:13.720
C coding.

01:13.720 --> 01:19.960
I am, of course, talking about, for $65, that low, low price, the coder.

01:19.960 --> 01:20.960
It's too late.

01:20.960 --> 01:21.960
You're too late.

01:21.960 --> 01:23.000
You've come over too late.

01:23.000 --> 01:24.000
It's done.

01:24.000 --> 01:25.000
The sale is over.

01:25.000 --> 01:26.000
Talk about it.

01:26.000 --> 01:27.000
I bought three of them today.

01:27.000 --> 01:28.000
Yeah.

01:28.000 --> 01:29.000
I turned it off a little bit ago.

01:29.000 --> 01:30.720
I was a little late because I was, you know-

01:30.720 --> 01:31.720
What?

01:31.720 --> 01:35.880
I thought, you know, let a couple people sneak a few orders in, but we have to cut it off

01:35.880 --> 01:39.280
because eventually we have to put the orders in for printing and all that, or actually

01:39.280 --> 01:40.880
it's embroidering.

01:40.880 --> 01:44.440
So I just thought of that whole little shtick, and there's no coder robe.

01:44.440 --> 01:46.240
I mean, it's technically sold out.

01:46.240 --> 01:48.200
Folks, the robe was a lie.

01:48.200 --> 01:49.480
You never know, though.

01:49.480 --> 01:50.480
It could come back.

01:50.480 --> 01:51.480
Dun, dun, dun.

01:51.480 --> 01:56.560
The thing is, is life is better in a robe, so I don't want to deprive the people of that.

01:56.560 --> 02:02.880
Now what we have to do is discover how brutalized we've been by international shipping because

02:02.880 --> 02:07.880
I've never done anything like this before ever, and I couldn't get an estimate of how

02:07.880 --> 02:11.160
much international shipping would be before we had all the orders in place.

02:11.160 --> 02:13.440
They refused to give it to me.

02:13.440 --> 02:15.640
And so I'm just kind of guessing.

02:15.640 --> 02:20.320
So at first I put like $10 on there for international shipping, and then I realized that was probably

02:20.320 --> 02:22.280
$35 too cheap.

02:22.280 --> 02:24.200
So we'll see what happens.

02:24.200 --> 02:25.400
We'll see.

02:25.400 --> 02:26.400
That's a big lesson learned.

02:26.400 --> 02:31.360
What we learn from that, I'll probably internalize that, and then we'll have other stuff.

02:31.360 --> 02:35.560
We got a request for coasters, too, which I would like another batch of coasters myself.

02:35.560 --> 02:39.340
I have two vintage Coderadio coasters on my desk here.

02:39.340 --> 02:46.560
But robe aside, which you'll soon be wrapped in its glory, I am kind of getting whiplash.

02:46.560 --> 02:48.980
You're giving me a little bit of anxiety with this switching here.

02:48.980 --> 02:52.440
First you're on Windows, then you're on the Mac, and then you're tweeting about being

02:52.440 --> 02:57.360
on the Limor again, and it's like three weeks, three different platforms.

02:57.360 --> 02:58.360
My head's spinning.

02:58.360 --> 03:07.400
Well, you know, I've been on Tinder for operating systems, and I've just been swiping right.

03:07.400 --> 03:11.080
I think this is fun to just chronicle, just to see you jump around a little bit, because

03:11.080 --> 03:15.360
I can kind of get a sense of what you're working on, like, okay, so he's taking a break on

03:15.360 --> 03:18.880
whatever it was on the Windows platform for, and he's picked up something that he's using

03:18.880 --> 03:19.880
Linux for again.

03:19.880 --> 03:21.840
And that's what I grok from afar.

03:21.840 --> 03:23.140
That's what you grok, right?

03:23.140 --> 03:27.840
So yes, each platform other than Mac, which is kind of like just doing its own thing,

03:27.840 --> 03:34.800
there is a native specific piece of software being written, which I will say that I have

03:34.800 --> 03:38.800
thoughts on my brief experience in Windows.

03:38.800 --> 03:39.800
So many thoughts.

03:39.800 --> 03:42.360
That's, I feel like a whole episode almost in there.

03:42.360 --> 03:47.360
Yeah, I think we need to wait until I have all my notes together, but I have thoughts.

03:47.360 --> 03:48.360
Okay.

03:48.360 --> 03:50.440
Well, I did a thing.

03:50.440 --> 03:53.680
You know, I started to talk about it last week, but we were all over the place.

03:53.680 --> 04:00.720
I didn't mention it, but I decided to pull the trigger on a 165 Hertz refresh rate monitor.

04:00.720 --> 04:01.720
Nice.

04:01.720 --> 04:05.400
Quick recap for those of you who are not familiar, I never considered a high refresh rate monitor

04:05.400 --> 04:10.080
because I like to play some video games, but I'm not a big, big gamer.

04:10.080 --> 04:17.540
But then I ended up reviewing a laptop with a high refresh rate screen in it, and I realized

04:17.540 --> 04:20.320
the entire computer UI feels more responsive.

04:20.320 --> 04:21.320
Everything feels faster.

04:21.320 --> 04:22.320
It's not just for games.

04:22.320 --> 04:26.760
It turns out obvious statement now that I'm making it, but I had never really connected

04:26.760 --> 04:28.680
the dots until I tried one.

04:28.680 --> 04:36.160
After I tried one, I was broken and I've been on a quest to optimize my machine performance

04:36.160 --> 04:40.200
at every step that I can without actually replacing the machine because it's just a

04:40.200 --> 04:42.680
horrible time to build a PC right now.

04:42.680 --> 04:47.320
So I've gone through the route of replacing the kernel with something a little faster,

04:47.320 --> 04:49.560
a different fork of it, if you will.

04:49.560 --> 04:53.920
I've gone through the process of optimizing the user space a little bit, and now I have

04:53.920 --> 05:02.560
added a 165 Hertz gigabyte M27Q 27 inch 1440p monitor.

05:02.560 --> 05:07.800
It's technically a gaming monitor, but Newegg had a fantastic deal on this thing.

05:07.800 --> 05:12.200
I decided I'd pull the trigger because of that great deal, and I plugged it in a couple

05:12.200 --> 05:17.080
of days ago, and it really feels like everything's coming together.

05:17.080 --> 05:21.620
The optimizations I've done to Firefox, the optimizations I did to plasma, the optimizations

05:21.620 --> 05:28.880
I did to the Linux kernel, and now with this 170 Hertz, but it's at 165 on my machine,

05:28.880 --> 05:29.880
but fine.

05:29.880 --> 05:36.520
It's fantastic, plus I haven't got a new monitor in years, many, many years, and so this is

05:36.520 --> 05:41.320
like a brilliant, beautiful display, an IPS display, and the freaking UI looks better.

05:41.320 --> 05:46.960
Like Firefox looks better, the themes look crisper, the colors are more differentiated.

05:46.960 --> 05:50.840
I didn't realize how the gray and blues were all kind of just all mushed together on my

05:50.840 --> 05:55.720
old screen, and with this new one, it's like pop, and it looks fantastic, so it's a nice

05:55.720 --> 06:02.800
gear upgrade, and I feel like I'm the happiest I have been with my machine performance since

06:02.800 --> 06:10.840
I've owned that thing, and I think it's like a 2017 rig maybe, 2018 maybe at the latest.

06:10.840 --> 06:13.480
So what did this beauty cost you?

06:13.480 --> 06:14.480
It was $300.

06:14.480 --> 06:15.720
Well, that's not bad.

06:15.720 --> 06:22.560
No, for a 1440p, 170 Hertz, 27-inch monitor with a bunch of different input and an integrated

06:22.560 --> 06:23.560
KVM.

06:23.560 --> 06:24.560
Yeah.

06:24.560 --> 06:25.800
That was a great deal.

06:25.800 --> 06:29.500
So I plugged it right in, and God bless Plasma.

06:29.500 --> 06:34.880
It is supporting multiple refresh rates, so my two side monitors, which I did not replace,

06:34.880 --> 06:40.940
are running at 60 Hertz, and the center monitor is running at 165 Hertz, working great.

06:40.940 --> 06:42.120
It's fancy, Mike.

06:42.120 --> 06:44.360
I really recommend it.

06:44.360 --> 06:49.640
That's my performance pro tip is if you're going to really try to get a fast system,

06:49.640 --> 06:51.560
don't even bother unless you're upgrading the screen too.

06:51.560 --> 06:53.600
It really made a difference for me.

06:53.600 --> 06:56.640
Speaking of pro tips, James writes in with a Zoom pro tip.

06:56.640 --> 07:00.920
He says, hey guys, you were talking about Zoom fatigue last week.

07:00.920 --> 07:01.920
It's real.

07:01.920 --> 07:09.300
I find a way to counter it is to put a window over my face, cover your face on the screen.

07:09.300 --> 07:14.300
For some reason, when we can see ourselves, I've noticed that we subconsciously obsess

07:14.300 --> 07:16.720
over the minutia of how we look.

07:16.720 --> 07:20.800
It's kind of like a baby laughing at themselves in a mirror, and it gets tiring.

07:20.800 --> 07:25.700
In normal conversations, we cannot see ourselves, so we don't really think about how we're looking

07:25.700 --> 07:26.920
the entire time.

07:26.920 --> 07:31.140
But spending an hour trying to make yourself appear normal is actually exhausting.

07:31.140 --> 07:32.140
So give it a go.

07:32.140 --> 07:33.700
It actually helps.

07:33.700 --> 07:34.700
Cover your face.

07:34.700 --> 07:40.680
I was having a conversation with my neighbor over the weekend, and they both, the husband

07:40.680 --> 07:43.240
and wife, were complaining about Zoom fatigue.

07:43.240 --> 07:47.600
They brought it up, and in fact, it was in the context of this guy was thinking about

07:47.600 --> 07:52.640
he wants to pitch his boss an idea, and he thinks he's just going to wait until they're

07:52.640 --> 07:58.240
back in person again to pitch him on it because everybody's just tired of Zoom, and he feels

07:58.240 --> 08:01.120
like it's actually going to hurt the sale in a sense.

08:01.120 --> 08:06.000
I mean, this Zoom fatigue thing, what is the alternative if you're not going to be in the

08:06.000 --> 08:07.000
office?

08:07.000 --> 08:08.000
Audio calls.

08:08.000 --> 08:09.000
Oh, yeah.

08:09.000 --> 08:10.000
No, that's my preference.

08:10.000 --> 08:13.720
I mean, like just jump, you know, jump on whatever chat app you use and just use this

08:13.720 --> 08:16.040
audio feature and don't turn the camera on.

08:16.040 --> 08:17.480
Why is that so hard?

08:17.480 --> 08:20.680
I think a lot of people want to have the camera because they want to try to replicate that,

08:20.680 --> 08:21.680
you know?

08:21.680 --> 08:26.000
Well, and a lot of corporate workplaces have a camera on policy.

08:26.000 --> 08:27.160
I have seen that.

08:27.160 --> 08:31.440
I have seen it where it's like just a reminder like after the meeting or like during the

08:31.440 --> 08:36.840
meeting, like in a side chat, just a reminder that we do have a camera on policy.

08:36.840 --> 08:38.880
It's for team morale, you know?

08:38.880 --> 08:42.240
I always felt like it's because the meeting is too big, and most of the time, no individual

08:42.240 --> 08:45.400
is really doing anything, so they want to make sure you're not like walking around your

08:45.400 --> 08:48.320
kitchen, you know, making your kid lunch or whatever.

08:48.320 --> 08:58.160
Well, someone you and I may know, mutually know, friend of the show, and I may have conspired

08:58.160 --> 09:04.840
on an idea to create a video loop that we could then feed in as a virtual camera to

09:04.840 --> 09:10.000
Zoom of just basically sitting there and nodding, and there was someone who experimented.

09:10.000 --> 09:16.720
He created pre-canned responses with transitions that he could hit a button on his keyboard

09:16.720 --> 09:20.800
and it would be like just a standard meeting response.

09:20.800 --> 09:21.800
Copy that.

09:21.800 --> 09:22.800
Yeah, that's a great idea.

09:22.800 --> 09:27.440
Yeah, we can circle back on that, you know, just those kinds of pre-canned stuff, and

09:27.440 --> 09:28.440
he got away with it for a week.

09:28.440 --> 09:30.240
He made a whole video about it on YouTube.

09:30.240 --> 09:32.240
Circle back, circle back.

09:32.240 --> 09:33.240
Sorry.

09:33.240 --> 09:35.160
It's so bad, though.

09:35.160 --> 09:36.160
It really is.

09:36.160 --> 09:40.200
It really is pretty awful, so a good pro tip is cover yourself up.

09:40.200 --> 09:41.360
I thought maybe it was just me.

09:41.360 --> 09:47.000
I thought maybe because I was vain or because, like, what I get fixated on is the camera

09:47.000 --> 09:52.880
shot and the background, and I want there to be depth, and I want there to be color,

09:52.880 --> 09:56.440
and I try to frame it properly, and I don't really actually want to be in the center,

09:56.440 --> 09:59.480
but I like being off the center, but like all these stupid things that just don't work

09:59.480 --> 10:01.840
well in a Zoom call, and that's me.

10:01.840 --> 10:02.840
I'm that guy.

10:02.840 --> 10:04.160
I'm that guy.

10:04.160 --> 10:09.040
I've never understood, but I know it's a thing, the hatred of like just traditional

10:09.040 --> 10:10.040
conference calls.

10:10.040 --> 10:13.120
Like even if you're doing them on Zoom, right, whatever.

10:13.120 --> 10:15.080
And then, I'm going to say it.

10:15.080 --> 10:21.340
This is my spicy take for the show, I guess, but it is apparently completely socially acceptable

10:21.340 --> 10:26.440
to comment on men's appearance in a Zoom call because during the pandemic, I didn't get

10:26.440 --> 10:27.440
my hair cut.

10:27.440 --> 10:31.360
I didn't feel like it was worth going to—for a while, you couldn't here in Washington,

10:31.360 --> 10:32.360
and then even once you could—

10:32.360 --> 10:33.360
You couldn't get your hair cut?

10:33.360 --> 10:34.360
Yeah.

10:34.360 --> 10:35.360
Huh?

10:35.360 --> 10:36.360
Oh, Florida's the land of the free.

10:36.360 --> 10:37.360
Just keep going.

10:37.360 --> 10:38.360
Well, now you can.

10:38.360 --> 10:43.920
I am now getting my hair cut, but I went for about a year-ish, almost a year without getting

10:43.920 --> 10:45.000
my hair cut.

10:45.000 --> 10:49.120
And it got pretty long, you know, down well past my shoulders even.

10:49.120 --> 10:54.160
And every Zoom call I would get on would start with people commenting on my hair growing

10:54.160 --> 10:55.160
out.

10:55.160 --> 10:58.560
You know, after the first week or two, you're like, huh, yeah, yeah, yeah, my hair is getting

10:58.560 --> 10:59.560
long.

10:59.560 --> 11:02.400
But then after like six months of it, you start thinking, can we just stop commenting

11:02.400 --> 11:03.400
on how I appear?

11:03.400 --> 11:06.780
Like I don't really like that to be the topic of conversation is my appearance.

11:06.780 --> 11:10.440
And I wasn't like particularly confident about the look.

11:10.440 --> 11:13.080
I felt kind of awkward about it myself.

11:13.080 --> 11:19.500
And it was apparently totally fine because it happened by all genders and all types would

11:19.500 --> 11:22.320
just decide to comment about my hair.

11:22.320 --> 11:26.480
And I would never start a conversation like that, you know, and you don't generally start

11:26.480 --> 11:29.240
in-person conversations like that either.

11:29.240 --> 11:34.560
And that was an aspect of the Zoom meetings that I found to be tiring, you know, in a

11:34.560 --> 11:35.560
sense.

11:35.560 --> 11:37.920
I mean, I've been sexual harassing you for eight years.

11:37.920 --> 11:42.480
So yeah, but that's, you know, that's not really different because it's not really harassment

11:42.480 --> 11:43.480
when I'm asking for it.

11:43.480 --> 11:44.480
Oh, my God.

11:44.480 --> 11:45.480
Yeah.

11:45.480 --> 11:48.080
Remember how you were worried about YouTube?

11:48.080 --> 11:51.880
Paul writes in with a with a question that I can connect with.

11:51.880 --> 11:57.280
He says, Valhalla guys, a longtime C and C sharp guy, I've recently started digging into

11:57.280 --> 12:05.700
Valhalla and some slight tooling issues aside, I'm thoroughly enjoying the language so far.

12:05.700 --> 12:09.980
It feels like if C sharp had been dropped on C's door as a baby.

12:09.980 --> 12:15.080
But where do you see these more niche languages taking part in, say, paid work?

12:15.080 --> 12:19.800
I'm not so much concerned about it while I'm an active maintainer, but more so down the

12:19.800 --> 12:23.720
road should the relationship dissolve for context, you know, take a look at something

12:23.720 --> 12:29.000
like an L.O.B. application, so a line of business application, so something that he would have

12:29.000 --> 12:31.560
to hand off potentially.

12:31.560 --> 12:36.380
What are your thoughts on using something like Valhalla, which is, as he puts it, one

12:36.380 --> 12:40.700
of the more niche languages in something where somebody is actually cutting you a big old

12:40.700 --> 12:43.860
check for some line of business application?

12:43.860 --> 12:44.860
In Valhalla?

12:44.860 --> 12:45.860
Yeah.

12:45.860 --> 12:50.600
Or, you know, insert the name of any niche, not widely used, but loved language.

12:50.600 --> 12:55.640
I mean, if you manage to sell someone Valhalla, which that's not me taking a shot at Valhalla,

12:55.640 --> 12:56.640
great.

12:56.640 --> 13:04.020
The question is, is it, I don't know about moral, but is it the wrong thing to do to

13:04.020 --> 13:06.880
leave somebody with something that's hard to support after the fact?

13:06.880 --> 13:09.360
I mean, everything is hard to support after the fact.

13:09.360 --> 13:10.360
Yeah.

13:10.360 --> 13:14.080
I mean, Valhalla is not a particularly esoteric language.

13:14.080 --> 13:19.240
I know it's not that popular, but if you know a little bit of C sharp or Java, you're probably

13:19.240 --> 13:20.960
going to get it.

13:20.960 --> 13:24.920
I think it's the default language that the elementary OS guys use for their application

13:24.920 --> 13:25.920
development.

13:25.920 --> 13:26.920
Oh yeah.

13:26.920 --> 13:27.920
I don't know.

13:27.920 --> 13:28.920
I think it's a fine choice.

13:28.920 --> 13:34.440
I mean, people write stuff in all kinds of stupid languages like Go and PHP.

13:34.440 --> 13:39.400
I'll tell you though, I have back in my bad old days of contracting, I have rocked up

13:39.400 --> 13:44.000
to an organization, walked in like, Mr. I'm going to fix it and log into their system

13:44.000 --> 13:50.320
and discover it's like some crazy old Red Hat box or BSD box that some esoteric setup

13:50.320 --> 13:56.300
this guy has done that is a complete like dream setup that he had, but something that's

13:56.300 --> 13:59.140
almost completely unmaintainable by me.

13:59.140 --> 14:04.120
And so often those kinds of situations leave the end user with no other option than paying

14:04.120 --> 14:06.200
somebody like me to come in and just replace it.

14:06.200 --> 14:11.320
I just don't see the problem with if it solves, if whatever solution you have solves their

14:11.320 --> 14:12.320
problem.

14:12.320 --> 14:13.320
Right.

14:13.320 --> 14:17.160
But if you're knowing that you're using this thing called Vala, then that's fine.

14:17.160 --> 14:18.440
How do you even disclose something like that?

14:18.440 --> 14:20.080
Like, Hey, yeah, I got this idea.

14:20.080 --> 14:22.680
It's going to do everything you want, but it is used.

14:22.680 --> 14:26.520
Just so you know, it's using a niche programming language.

14:26.520 --> 14:27.520
Yeah.

14:27.520 --> 14:28.520
I think that's what scare them away.

14:28.520 --> 14:29.520
Don't you?

14:29.520 --> 14:30.520
Well, that's the risk you take, right?

14:30.520 --> 14:31.520
I mean, that's, yeah.

14:31.520 --> 14:36.080
I mean, personally, I would pitch objective, see every opportunity I got.

14:36.080 --> 14:41.560
Actually, I think your point though is it's the client's risk to accept and if they accept

14:41.560 --> 14:42.720
the risk, then go for it.

14:42.720 --> 14:43.720
Right.

14:43.720 --> 14:47.840
Like if you didn't tell them that this was a risk, then that, then, I mean, I don't know,

14:47.840 --> 14:48.840
I'm not a lawyer.

14:48.840 --> 14:54.760
Maybe that's still okay, but it seems sort of jerky, but I mean, I don't know whenever

14:54.760 --> 14:57.840
I bid a contract out, we actually just have a piece of paper that lists the technologies

14:57.840 --> 14:59.300
we intend to use.

14:59.300 --> 15:00.440
And West makes a great point too.

15:00.440 --> 15:04.200
It's going to depend on what other technologies they have in place.

15:04.200 --> 15:06.480
Are they already using multiple languages?

15:06.480 --> 15:10.800
Do they have an engineer in house who has a preference?

15:10.800 --> 15:16.360
Also something else you could do is look to see if there's someone who could replace you.

15:16.360 --> 15:18.520
No, no, I wouldn't do that.

15:18.520 --> 15:19.520
Yeah.

15:19.520 --> 15:21.720
Mark in the chat room is mentioning visual Fox pro.

15:21.720 --> 15:25.200
I have a project where I'm migrating things out of visual Fox pro right now and it needs

15:25.200 --> 15:26.200
to die.

15:26.200 --> 15:30.520
See, that's what I'm thinking is it could be that situation with something like this.

15:30.520 --> 15:31.520
Yeah.

15:31.520 --> 15:33.020
It's a, it's a goddamn nightmare, but.

15:33.020 --> 15:36.400
So I think really the answer is though, is it's the client's decision to make and then

15:36.400 --> 15:41.520
it's the challenges is you've got to explain to them how to mitigate the risk and why it's

15:41.520 --> 15:43.520
worth that risk.

15:43.520 --> 15:48.240
And you know, I give, if you can't articulate that reason, maybe it's not the right tool

15:48.240 --> 15:49.400
for the job to begin with.

15:49.400 --> 15:50.400
Right.

15:50.400 --> 15:53.880
And in your particular case of Vala, Vala is not like, I don't know, closure.

15:53.880 --> 15:54.880
Sorry.

15:54.880 --> 15:57.120
I was that, you know, normal developers can't comprehend.

15:57.120 --> 15:58.600
You have to come down from the mountain.

15:58.600 --> 15:59.600
I love it.

15:59.600 --> 16:00.600
Okay.

16:00.600 --> 16:01.600
Unnecessary.

16:01.600 --> 16:05.440
Maybe I'm still starting from that seven week challenge.

16:05.440 --> 16:06.920
All right.

16:06.920 --> 16:13.240
Well, Link wrote in and wanted to get your take on a hot take that, uh, Drew DeVault,

16:13.240 --> 16:18.240
not the Drew that edits this show, but Drew DeVault, a, a, a developer of, uh, I think

16:18.240 --> 16:21.860
sway, um, and a bunch of, a bunch of open source projects.

16:21.860 --> 16:26.880
And he writes in that the rust is, well, it has issues.

16:26.880 --> 16:30.880
I guess he breaks it down into kind of three major areas and I'll give you the highlights

16:30.880 --> 16:31.880
here.

16:31.880 --> 16:37.660
The first is rust breaks a lot of stuff and in ways that are difficult to fix the rust

16:37.660 --> 16:44.160
cargo cult needs to pause and reevaluate switching to rust breaks things for anyone who steps

16:44.160 --> 16:53.120
even a toe out of the norm of Linux Mac windows on x86 64 or arm 64, even on supported platforms.

16:53.120 --> 16:58.280
It comes with a substantial burden of build requirements calling for 10 times to a hundred

16:58.280 --> 17:01.560
times of more Ram CPU time and power usage.

17:01.560 --> 17:07.440
Other benefits choosing rust is ultimately choosing to lock a large group of people out

17:07.440 --> 17:11.800
of your project and dooming many more to struggle with frustration.

17:11.800 --> 17:16.560
These are real trade-offs that you need to consider rewrite in rust has become a moral

17:16.560 --> 17:17.560
imperative.

17:17.560 --> 17:21.560
Well, here's another moral argument, throwing away serviceable components every couple of

17:21.560 --> 17:27.400
years to upgrade is a privilege that not all of your users have, and it contributes to

17:27.400 --> 17:30.840
climate change and it fills up landfills.

17:30.840 --> 17:36.360
Lurking your code in rust is always going to introduce new bugs, including security

17:36.360 --> 17:40.560
bugs that wouldn't be there if you just maintain the C code.

17:40.560 --> 17:45.200
Maybe there's an undiscovered bug lurking in your C code base, but as your code base

17:45.200 --> 17:50.520
ages under continuous maintenance, that number will only shrink.

17:50.520 --> 17:56.320
A working C tool chain can be written in a couple tens of thousands of lines of code.

17:56.320 --> 18:04.640
The only working rust tool chain is tens of millions of lines of C++ and rust code.

18:04.640 --> 18:08.600
Rust is kind of cool, but it's not a panacea.

18:08.600 --> 18:14.200
There are legitimate reasons to prefer C, both technical and moral, and rust still needs

18:14.200 --> 18:19.720
a lot of work before it's ready for primetime and systems which prioritize stability, reliability,

18:19.720 --> 18:22.140
simplicity, and accessibility.

18:22.140 --> 18:27.920
To the Rust team, it's time to calm down, slow down the language, write a specification,

18:27.920 --> 18:32.680
focus on improving your tier 2 and tier 3 targets, expand to more platforms, and work

18:32.680 --> 18:36.200
on performance, stability, and accessibility.

18:36.200 --> 18:47.200
That's a lot in there.

18:47.200 --> 18:53.280
He does make a quick mention of Power9 and RISC-V.

18:53.280 --> 18:54.640
So there's a bit of irony here.

18:54.640 --> 19:00.480
One of our topics for today is why me and my team chose C++ over Rust just this week,

19:00.480 --> 19:03.160
which has a lot to do with some of these complaints.

19:03.160 --> 19:05.640
I think Drew has a point.

19:05.640 --> 19:08.760
Maybe he's being a little unfair to the Rust team.

19:08.760 --> 19:10.800
I don't think they're claiming it's a panacea.

19:10.800 --> 19:16.340
I don't think they're claiming make a cargo package and you've solved all your technical

19:16.340 --> 19:19.080
problems for the remainder of your life.

19:19.080 --> 19:24.160
I tweeted out that I was looking at just doing something in C++ instead, and there's quite

19:24.160 --> 19:30.760
a bit of like, that will be insecure, you should do it in Rust to avoid insert memory

19:30.760 --> 19:35.420
issue here, which I guess is kind of true.

19:35.420 --> 19:41.320
I don't think the benefits of Rust are as overstated as the writer seems to think.

19:41.320 --> 19:44.720
And if I'm misreading you, Drew, that's my fault.

19:44.720 --> 19:50.560
But I definitely can see that it is, I mean, comparing it to C or C++, they've been around

19:50.560 --> 19:52.080
forever.

19:52.080 --> 19:57.480
They have decent compilers and compatibility with insert your crazy architecture here.

19:57.480 --> 20:01.120
You mentioned RISC-V, not that crazy, but fair enough.

20:01.120 --> 20:05.600
C++ works just fine on it, and of course, C that you mentioned.

20:05.600 --> 20:09.600
I don't know that I would want to discourage people from learning Rust.

20:09.600 --> 20:14.360
Even as a teaching tool, Rust actually does enforce some pretty good, I don't know if

20:14.360 --> 20:18.640
I want to say concepts or patterns, but pretty good ways of thinking about handling memory

20:18.640 --> 20:21.080
and how you should think about your code.

20:21.080 --> 20:23.480
I sort of wouldn't want to discourage people from looking at it.

20:23.480 --> 20:24.480
Does that make sense?

20:24.480 --> 20:26.020
Yeah, it does.

20:26.020 --> 20:31.560
And I think I agree with your take that a lot of what he points to as challenges with

20:31.560 --> 20:37.320
Rust when it comes to platform support is inherently because it is still so young.

20:37.320 --> 20:41.040
And with time, so will come that support.

20:41.040 --> 20:45.360
I think it's also very likely that that's where the puck is skating.

20:45.360 --> 20:50.920
It's obvious that over time, Rust will probably stitch up its RISC-V support and its power

20:50.920 --> 20:51.920
support.

20:51.920 --> 20:56.880
I don't think that's going to be an issue long term if there ends up being a large deployment

20:56.880 --> 20:58.240
of those platforms.

20:58.240 --> 21:02.760
It is in that stage right now, especially something like RISC-V. There's really only

21:02.760 --> 21:08.200
one developer board in like a Raspberry Pi style SBC that you can get your hands on right

21:08.200 --> 21:09.200
now.

21:09.200 --> 21:12.560
That's going to change, but it's still early days.

21:12.560 --> 21:16.480
There's really only one or two workstations that have power chips in them that you can

21:16.480 --> 21:19.840
get your hands on these days, and they're very expensive.

21:19.840 --> 21:24.560
OS News just posted a really interesting review of one that is kind of like just a desktop

21:24.560 --> 21:25.560
tower.

21:25.560 --> 21:30.360
It looks very accessible with AMD graphics in it, and it's a PowerPC processor in that

21:30.360 --> 21:31.360
one.

21:31.360 --> 21:32.360
That's awesome.

21:32.360 --> 21:33.360
That looks really interesting to me.

21:33.360 --> 21:38.680
And I absolutely would expect that as I got more and more outside the mainstream platforms,

21:38.680 --> 21:42.740
there would be less and less support, especially in something as new as Rust.

21:42.740 --> 21:49.680
But it was kind of refreshing to see another take, a little real talk around Rust.

21:49.680 --> 21:50.680
Yeah.

21:50.680 --> 21:56.380
I mean, I would say a more boring, practical code or radio criticism of Rust would be,

21:56.380 --> 21:58.720
you may not be Microsoft or Amazon.

21:58.720 --> 22:01.640
You may need to hire developers that you can actually get.

22:01.640 --> 22:05.760
Not that you're hiring bad developers, but you're hiring developers who did not go to

22:05.760 --> 22:07.040
MIT.

22:07.040 --> 22:14.080
And Rust, your average 22-year-old coming out of college with a Comp Sci degree will

22:14.080 --> 22:15.960
probably be eaten alive by Rust.

22:15.960 --> 22:16.960
Yeah.

22:16.960 --> 22:18.920
And the interest and the momentum sure is there.

22:18.920 --> 22:19.920
Yeah.

22:19.920 --> 22:20.920
I hope I'm wrong.

22:20.920 --> 22:29.680
Please, if you're 22 and in the Tampa area and love your Rust, it should be an email.

22:29.680 --> 22:31.320
Linode.com slash coder.

22:31.320 --> 22:35.440
Go there to receive a $100 60-day credit towards your new account.

22:35.440 --> 22:37.920
Linode's where we host everything for JB 3.0.

22:37.920 --> 22:42.160
Well, they're also the largest independent cloud out there for developers.

22:42.160 --> 22:43.380
Simplify your cloud infrastructure.

22:43.380 --> 22:45.600
Take a look at Linode with that $100 credit.

22:45.600 --> 22:49.560
Get an idea of what it can do and get an idea of why we've chosen Linode.

22:49.560 --> 22:53.760
They've got 11 data centers around the world, so there's a lot of locations to work with,

22:53.760 --> 22:56.640
something near you or your customers and clients.

22:56.640 --> 22:58.760
40-gigabit connections coming into the machines.

22:58.760 --> 23:03.160
Of course, super-fast native SSDs on all of the hypervisors.

23:03.160 --> 23:07.280
And they have a really great, really great dashboard with lots of nice documentation,

23:07.280 --> 23:08.280
alerts, monitoring.

23:08.280 --> 23:09.920
I mean, you name it.

23:09.920 --> 23:14.340
I talk about it from time to time, but they also have a great selection of one-click deployments.

23:14.340 --> 23:20.480
If you want to get a base system with container support going or a fast WordPress setup, they

23:20.480 --> 23:26.120
have a lot of really nice, just get your website up and going, get that part figured out fast.

23:26.120 --> 23:29.560
Or you can do like what we do and just build stuff out over time.

23:29.560 --> 23:33.720
Get something that's really powerful and then run all of your applications on just a couple

23:33.720 --> 23:35.400
of really powerful machines.

23:35.400 --> 23:38.080
And then for the backend storage, what we use is their object storage.

23:38.080 --> 23:42.360
They have an S3-compatible object storage that's just fantastic because you don't have

23:42.360 --> 23:45.480
to slice off large sections of disk, which you totally can.

23:45.480 --> 23:49.200
You can go the traditional block storage route and just slice off some disk.

23:49.200 --> 23:53.820
But with object storage, I just use what I need, and then I can get URLs for everything

23:53.820 --> 23:56.320
and there's ways to plug it in with the file system.

23:56.320 --> 23:58.880
It just works fantastic.

23:58.880 --> 24:02.760
And all of this, it's at your fingertips to try.

24:02.760 --> 24:06.480
You can try it right now by going to linode.com slash coder and build yourself something,

24:06.480 --> 24:09.740
something simple or something you can really dig into.

24:09.740 --> 24:15.400
And then you can rest easy knowing that you have great support backing all of it up.

24:15.400 --> 24:19.520
Linode has top-notch support, like nobody does it like Linode.

24:19.520 --> 24:23.120
And that's comforting when you're running your business infrastructure on there.

24:23.120 --> 24:27.000
And you can also rest assured knowing that they started in 2003 as one of the first companies

24:27.000 --> 24:28.800
in cloud computing.

24:28.800 --> 24:32.640
And they have focused in on a handful of things that they do.

24:32.640 --> 24:35.220
And they do those things very well.

24:35.220 --> 24:37.720
They're not like some sort of crazy VC funded startup.

24:37.720 --> 24:41.560
They're just going to go nuts trying to get market share and do every little thing.

24:41.560 --> 24:43.480
They've really figured out what works.

24:43.480 --> 24:46.600
And they're independently owned and they're founded on a love for Linux and the technology

24:46.600 --> 24:49.420
that made all of this cloud computing possible.

24:49.420 --> 24:56.720
And now they're the largest cloud offering dedicated virtualization with CPU systems,

24:56.720 --> 25:01.280
GPU systems, shared systems at like $5 a month and much more.

25:01.280 --> 25:03.180
There's something that's going to work for everybody.

25:03.180 --> 25:08.280
So support the show and get that $100 credit when you go to linode.com slash coder.

25:08.280 --> 25:12.680
That's linode.com slash coder.

25:12.680 --> 25:14.800
The privacy wars rage on.

25:14.800 --> 25:22.800
The hoopla is filled with, I guess, the next phase of where all of this is going.

25:22.800 --> 25:27.000
Facebook, this is according to inc.com, has just admitted that it has lost the privacy

25:27.000 --> 25:29.040
war with Apple.

25:29.040 --> 25:34.080
This all goes back to those privacy nutrition labels that you kind of changed my mind on

25:34.080 --> 25:40.040
a few weeks ago and how Google and Facebook have been really struggling with this.

25:40.040 --> 25:45.000
Google just today updated Gmail for the first time since these privacy labels have gone

25:45.000 --> 25:46.960
into effect.

25:46.960 --> 25:53.680
And Facebook has tried to take its fight public, trying to go after Apple in the public space.

25:53.680 --> 25:54.680
Have you seen all this?

25:54.680 --> 25:55.680
Yeah.

25:55.680 --> 25:58.040
So how would that work?

25:58.040 --> 25:59.240
So they're doing a couple of things.

25:59.240 --> 26:05.280
They're trying to frame this as Apple harming small business and they've released an ad

26:05.280 --> 26:08.760
and I'll just give you a taste of like one of their strategies.

26:08.760 --> 26:14.080
For every idea out there that gets the love it should, there are five more that don't

26:14.080 --> 26:19.560
succeed and so are lost for good and some of them are pretty flawed and some of them

26:19.560 --> 26:20.720
are slightly odd.

26:20.720 --> 26:26.680
But many are small businesses that simply lack the tool to find excited people who will

26:26.680 --> 26:28.800
stop and say, that's cool.

26:28.800 --> 26:34.280
And these two, they like this idea and those three like that one and that's because personalized

26:34.280 --> 26:38.600
ads find good ideas for everyone.

26:38.600 --> 26:45.920
So the idea is that Apple is preventing small business users from reaching potential new

26:45.920 --> 26:50.240
customers by limiting how Facebook can track you.

26:50.240 --> 26:52.240
That was Orwellian.

26:52.240 --> 26:53.240
Isn't that something?

26:53.240 --> 26:54.320
That was really bad.

26:54.320 --> 26:59.800
Let's just be frank, like what Facebook is worried about and is pushing back against

26:59.800 --> 27:06.760
is if the end user is given a choice, if they want to be tracked or not, they know the end

27:06.760 --> 27:09.200
user is going to say, don't track me.

27:09.200 --> 27:15.240
And small businesses don't need to know your specific location, your gender, your age.

27:15.240 --> 27:20.840
Really if you think about it from a small business marketing standpoint, just pick a

27:20.840 --> 27:26.600
Facebook group that matches what your product serves and advertise to that Facebook group.

27:26.600 --> 27:28.160
You don't even need to know any of that crap.

27:28.160 --> 27:30.600
Just figure it out by the groups they hang out in.

27:30.600 --> 27:36.320
So I guess I don't understand how Facebook could think this would work.

27:36.320 --> 27:41.020
I'm trying to see like the galaxy brain 3D chess move now because Apple's got him because

27:41.020 --> 27:46.180
it's not Apple is it's not Apple's fault that telling people how these apps are tracking

27:46.180 --> 27:49.320
them damages Facebook's business model.

27:49.320 --> 27:51.860
That is the flaw of Facebook's business model.

27:51.860 --> 27:55.320
It seems a lot like the cigarette companies being pissed at the government want to put

27:55.320 --> 27:56.960
labels on cigarettes, right?

27:56.960 --> 28:02.320
We saw Google, you know, Google resisting it to just finally updating Gmail today.

28:02.320 --> 28:03.320
After what?

28:03.320 --> 28:04.800
Like two, three months?

28:04.800 --> 28:05.960
Yeah.

28:05.960 --> 28:10.320
So in general, I think we have a problem of too many, like behemoths in the world, you

28:10.320 --> 28:13.560
know, striding across and crushing the little guys.

28:13.560 --> 28:15.640
I sort of just want Apple to win here.

28:15.640 --> 28:19.840
Yeah, it's weird because it does put Apple in the well, because like the problem is Facebook's

28:19.840 --> 28:25.360
business model is like not awesome for society, right?

28:25.360 --> 28:30.440
I think we have a problem with tracking in general, and this is the beginning of that

28:30.440 --> 28:31.440
conversation.

28:31.440 --> 28:32.440
But I don't know.

28:32.440 --> 28:34.960
We used to rant and rave about paying for stuff, right?

28:34.960 --> 28:38.600
Like for years and years and years beyond here, like people need to pay for software,

28:38.600 --> 28:40.320
but that battle's kind of been lost.

28:40.320 --> 28:41.320
Well, all right.

28:41.320 --> 28:42.320
I don't think either.

28:42.320 --> 28:45.760
I mean, all of us are just, I just, it's almost just worth noting at this point, I think just

28:45.760 --> 28:48.320
so we have it here in the record of the show, but I don't really know if we have much more

28:48.320 --> 28:49.560
to say about it.

28:49.560 --> 28:53.600
I want to switch instead to your Stadia, your Stadia version of Terraria.

28:53.600 --> 28:59.040
Now this whole thing, this whole thing is spooky because this developer got all pissed

28:59.040 --> 29:05.860
and rage quit his port to Stadia after Google suspended his account and then just basically

29:05.860 --> 29:11.280
ghosted him and did not respond to any of his series of tweets or emails that he sent

29:11.280 --> 29:13.100
in trying to get access to his account.

29:13.100 --> 29:14.700
His business was impacted by this.

29:14.700 --> 29:17.320
His Google apps account was impacted by this.

29:17.320 --> 29:19.160
And then afterwards he was so frustrated, he said, that's it.

29:19.160 --> 29:20.160
I give up.

29:20.160 --> 29:22.800
I'm not going to develop for Stadia anymore.

29:22.800 --> 29:29.160
While a Google spokesperson has confirmed to the verge that the Terraria port is back

29:29.160 --> 29:30.600
in development.

29:30.600 --> 29:34.440
So I did some digging and I could not find what the hell actually happened here.

29:34.440 --> 29:35.440
Yeah.

29:35.440 --> 29:36.440
Then he just got shut down.

29:36.440 --> 29:37.440
Like, but no reason why, right?

29:37.440 --> 29:38.440
Right.

29:38.440 --> 29:42.600
And he's not saying, I mean, I'm sure they told him why, but at some point before bringing

29:42.600 --> 29:43.600
him back.

29:43.600 --> 29:46.480
So this is kind of where you were going with the Facebook thing is like, we have these

29:46.480 --> 29:51.480
weird centralizations now of control that we knew were coming all along.

29:51.480 --> 29:55.680
We're not surprised that it's here, but it is legitimately backfiring in the ways that

29:55.680 --> 29:56.680
we were concerned about.

29:56.680 --> 30:00.080
Like before the, you and I started recording today, I was telling you that this is a huge

30:00.080 --> 30:04.240
concern of mine because I would be shut out of my business.

30:04.240 --> 30:06.240
Certain aspects of my business would be shut down.

30:06.240 --> 30:10.860
And I hear so many of these stories where you just can't get Google's attention.

30:10.860 --> 30:12.320
This guy got lucky.

30:12.320 --> 30:17.920
I guess, you know, it percolated up enough that a human saw it and took action.

30:17.920 --> 30:24.600
But you know, if you don't have an audience, if you don't have a reach, you're screwed.

30:24.600 --> 30:30.080
You know, I feel like we've done eight years of talking about big tech monopolies, app

30:30.080 --> 30:31.680
stores and data tracking.

30:31.680 --> 30:34.680
I hate to say this, but it's kind of getting dystopian.

30:34.680 --> 30:36.040
It doesn't seem like it's gone well.

30:36.040 --> 30:40.680
I find myself more and more wishing for the dream of the nineties web where it'd be like,

30:40.680 --> 30:46.160
you know, Mike would have Mike.com Chris would have Chris.com and like we would just sell

30:46.160 --> 30:50.480
our crap in our own domains and like, yes, we'd have to write all of our payment processing

30:50.480 --> 30:56.640
and customer management stuff ourselves or by God forbid license, you know, some independent

30:56.640 --> 31:02.360
platform to do that for us instead of being on these gigantic centralized app stores that

31:02.360 --> 31:08.420
just not even because they're evil, but because of their massive scale can't help but screwing

31:08.420 --> 31:11.120
over the little guy.

31:11.120 --> 31:14.600
Not even with malice, but with just like inefficiency at scale like that, right?

31:14.600 --> 31:19.120
If there's a giant Colossus stroming in Athens, he's going to step on Socrates every once

31:19.120 --> 31:20.120
in a while.

31:20.120 --> 31:24.280
I've been thinking about this recently too, because I heard, um, I heard somebody talking

31:24.280 --> 31:28.920
about how, uh, they could only launch, you know, they were going to launch this business

31:28.920 --> 31:32.720
idea, but they were only going to launch once the app, once the app was ready to go.

31:32.720 --> 31:35.520
And then somebody said, so are you going to, why don't you launch on the web?

31:35.520 --> 31:37.560
Oh no, no, that's later if we do that.

31:37.560 --> 31:41.800
And then I started thinking about Instagram and what a impact it's had culturally.

31:41.800 --> 31:47.440
And you know, the sale of course to Facebook and, and how Instagram has become this phenomenon

31:47.440 --> 31:51.880
that every social media influencer has to be on Instagram.

31:51.880 --> 31:56.720
And it's all an app, you know, it has a web version, but it really, really, really sucks.

31:56.720 --> 31:57.720
It doesn't do much.

31:57.720 --> 32:00.120
There was an intern for like a day and a half.

32:00.120 --> 32:01.120
Yes.

32:01.120 --> 32:02.120
Yeah.

32:02.120 --> 32:05.720
And that entire phenomenon is an app in these app stores.

32:05.720 --> 32:12.840
And it really struck me that the scale at which these app stores have now, I don't know

32:12.840 --> 32:18.180
if this is true or not, but I saw a statistic from what was supposedly a Facebook financial

32:18.180 --> 32:22.920
call that something like only 4% of their traffic comes from web.

32:22.920 --> 32:27.440
And the rest is all app based, which just seems outrageous.

32:27.440 --> 32:29.080
That's just outrageous.

32:29.080 --> 32:31.960
You look at everything that's happening with these apps or policies and how these businesses

32:31.960 --> 32:38.520
are struggling like Epic, and you wonder why we didn't just invest more in the web.

32:38.520 --> 32:43.600
And I've often heard it blamed on Apple because Apple wants to have the app store be successful,

32:43.600 --> 32:48.520
but mobile Safari was one of the most, if not the most competitive mobile web browser

32:48.520 --> 32:49.520
to begin with.

32:49.520 --> 32:53.720
And it's continued to remain very competitive and adding features.

32:53.720 --> 32:58.580
And it doesn't seem like Apple is crippling the capabilities of its web browser.

32:58.580 --> 33:02.120
Some people have written in and said, arguably Apple could do some things to improve it.

33:02.120 --> 33:03.640
And maybe they will.

33:03.640 --> 33:04.640
I don't buy that.

33:04.640 --> 33:08.880
I don't think iPhone Safari is nerfed enough to really.

33:08.880 --> 33:10.400
I think it all could have been on the web.

33:10.400 --> 33:15.360
You know, I've been thinking about if I got more into video again, I'd really like to

33:15.360 --> 33:21.920
publish it on JupiterTube, which is a PeerTube instance that we're running off of Linode.

33:21.920 --> 33:23.960
And there's no algorithm.

33:23.960 --> 33:28.440
There's no YouTube clickbait system you have to do to get views.

33:28.440 --> 33:32.880
There's no having to ask people to like and subscribe.

33:32.880 --> 33:33.880
Hit the bell button.

33:33.880 --> 33:34.880
None of that.

33:34.880 --> 33:35.880
It's just our own video platform.

33:35.880 --> 33:38.040
And the only thing that's on there is Jupiter broadcasting videos.

33:38.040 --> 33:42.560
We're live streaming on there right now on Monday night.

33:42.560 --> 33:48.380
And it will always just be a silo because it doesn't have that network effect because

33:48.380 --> 33:49.920
it isn't YouTube.

33:49.920 --> 33:57.560
You know, things get 80 views maybe, and there is a real notable reduction in traffic.

33:57.560 --> 34:00.560
Okay, so this is Mike's crazy conspiracy theory.

34:00.560 --> 34:07.160
I think what happened is the Web 2.0 stuff, you know, when like people were really doing

34:07.160 --> 34:13.600
interactive websites like in the, I don't know, the early aughts, I guess, didn't get

34:13.600 --> 34:18.320
enough time to get off its feet until the iPhone came out.

34:18.320 --> 34:24.000
And I mean, yeah, like the I think about the businesses that started as like iOS development

34:24.000 --> 34:31.880
shops would have probably been web development shops, similar kind of mix of people, right?

34:31.880 --> 34:32.880
Designers and developers.

34:32.880 --> 34:38.680
Do you think it's at all notable that like Clubhouse, which is the social media network

34:38.680 --> 34:42.000
with the most buzz at the moment, is iOS only?

34:42.000 --> 34:43.000
Well, I think, right.

34:43.000 --> 34:44.000
That's what I'm getting.

34:44.000 --> 34:49.520
I think there's multiple bad trends that happened to one just like we've spent years talking

34:49.520 --> 34:55.480
about this, the lessening of people's willingness to pay both by volume and by just actual sticker

34:55.480 --> 35:01.160
price on platforms that aren't iOS or Mac is pretty significant.

35:01.160 --> 35:04.440
And even then, on those platforms, people aren't willing to pay now very much.

35:04.440 --> 35:05.440
Sure.

35:05.440 --> 35:08.320
My issue with this conversation is I don't know how we could get back.

35:08.320 --> 35:09.320
Right.

35:09.320 --> 35:12.320
I don't think we can.

35:12.320 --> 35:14.360

All right, so you teased this a little bit in the show, and I'm hoping this is going

36:31.100 --> 36:33.600
to pick us up, you know, because now we got kind of grumpy.

36:33.600 --> 36:35.760
We got into old man radio.

36:35.760 --> 36:41.960
And I feel like if you are making a bold statement, like going with C++ in 2021, there's going

36:41.960 --> 36:44.120
to be some real meat to this one.

36:44.120 --> 36:45.220
There's going to be some spice.

36:45.220 --> 36:46.360
So you're on the spot.

36:46.360 --> 36:47.360
You cannot disappoint.

36:47.360 --> 36:48.360
All right.

36:48.360 --> 36:51.080
So there was a journey here.

36:51.080 --> 36:54.440
So my goal is to launch a product at least every year now.

36:54.440 --> 36:58.840
So this year we're doing something new, more to come on that, ding, ding.

36:58.840 --> 37:04.580
But it requires some low level Linuxy goodness, which one means system 76 will probably somehow

37:04.580 --> 37:09.440
get more money because that's just what happens.

37:09.440 --> 37:16.040
And it also means that I couldn't just Python my way to glory.

37:16.040 --> 37:17.620
So there's a progression here, right?

37:17.620 --> 37:23.680
So speccing out this project, it needs to hit multiple processor architectures, technically

37:23.680 --> 37:28.440
multiple OSs, but really the meat and potatoes here is Linux.

37:28.440 --> 37:32.480
And I would tell you which flavor of Linux, but I don't want to trigger you.

37:32.480 --> 37:33.960
I think I already know.

37:33.960 --> 37:34.960
I'll give you one guess.

37:34.960 --> 37:35.960
Yeah, I don't.

37:35.960 --> 37:36.960
I know.

37:36.960 --> 37:39.380
I don't want to say its name out loud because then I get Twitter trolls.

37:39.380 --> 37:41.000
But we have new listeners in the chat room.

37:41.000 --> 37:42.000
We should tell them.

37:42.000 --> 37:43.880
You should spread the good news.

37:43.880 --> 37:48.320
The good news of Suze, although they will correct me.

37:48.320 --> 37:51.320
The Germans will email me, it's Suza.

37:51.320 --> 37:52.560
And do not get that wrong.

37:52.560 --> 37:55.020
Get the hell out of here.

37:55.020 --> 37:59.600
So for the new listeners, I am in the arduous process of building a data center in Plant

37:59.600 --> 38:02.400
City that exclusively runs Suza.

38:02.400 --> 38:03.400
You okay, Kristinita?

38:03.400 --> 38:04.400
I mean, I'm breathing.

38:04.400 --> 38:05.400
I'm practicing my breathing.

38:05.400 --> 38:06.400
I'm trying.

38:06.400 --> 38:09.440
I heard there was some lizard talk on Linux Unplugged, by the way.

38:09.440 --> 38:11.320
It happens from time to time.

38:11.320 --> 38:12.360
We slip into it.

38:12.360 --> 38:13.400
Everybody does accidentally.

38:13.400 --> 38:17.400
You just need a green panic button, and I can just show up and be like, what's going

38:17.400 --> 38:18.400
on, guys?

38:18.400 --> 38:23.160
I did have a Suza bell at one point, but it didn't ding real well, so we got rid of it.

38:23.160 --> 38:25.840
If you haven't tried Suza for your servers, you are missing out.

38:25.840 --> 38:27.000
That's all I'm going to say.

38:27.000 --> 38:28.480
And I'll leave it there.

38:28.480 --> 38:29.480
All right.

38:29.480 --> 38:34.800
So we looked at Python and Cython, I guess it's CXC Python, I don't know.

38:34.800 --> 38:38.040
CY, you know what I'm talking about, if you know anything about Python.

38:38.040 --> 38:39.040
Yeah.

38:39.040 --> 38:42.200
And it was like, ugh, okay, kind of slow.

38:42.200 --> 38:44.160
I mean, and we're basically now a Python shop.

38:44.160 --> 38:47.640
We love Python, but it's like, ugh, really?

38:47.640 --> 38:50.920
Some of these are going to be smaller, more, I hate the term IoT, but-

38:50.920 --> 38:51.920
Low end.

38:51.920 --> 38:52.920
I guess IoT is fair.

38:52.920 --> 38:57.240
Yeah, low end devices, and the hardware cost is something I need to track.

38:57.240 --> 38:58.240
Are they ARM?

38:58.240 --> 38:59.720
Oh, yes, they are.

38:59.720 --> 39:00.720
Yeah, okay.

39:00.720 --> 39:03.720
But it also has to run on AMD 64, right, and X86.

39:03.720 --> 39:04.720
All right.

39:04.720 --> 39:08.600
Then we've been doing.NET for a couple of clients right now.

39:08.600 --> 39:12.600
More on that in a couple of weeks, at least on my new adventures in WSL.

39:12.600 --> 39:21.960
And it was like, well,.NET is open source now, and it runs everywhere, but it's.NET.

39:21.960 --> 39:26.480
So I did kind of a quick POC fooling around with C Sharp.

39:26.480 --> 39:27.480
It worked.

39:27.480 --> 39:28.480
Yeah.

39:28.480 --> 39:34.120
But then you had to like cross compile to Linux, which worked.

39:34.120 --> 39:37.960
There's a lot of like extra setup that would have had to be done.

39:37.960 --> 39:40.880
And one of the inconvenient things, and I actually have a blog post about this in the

39:40.880 --> 39:44.040
show notes where I kind of detail some of this stuff out.

39:44.040 --> 39:50.400
We are basically a Linux shop now, but running mostly POP with like a few straggling, like

39:50.400 --> 39:52.720
we have Macs for when we have to test iOS stuff.

39:52.720 --> 39:57.320
I got to be careful how I say this because people will jump down my throat.

39:57.320 --> 40:04.400
The.NET development experience on Linux in particular is not as good as it is on Windows.

40:04.400 --> 40:06.360
I don't think that's a controversial statement, right?

40:06.360 --> 40:07.360
Seems like it makes sense.

40:07.360 --> 40:08.360
Yeah.

40:08.360 --> 40:12.120
And it's better than it's ever been, but like it's nothing near as smooth as let's say our

40:12.120 --> 40:14.560
Python development workflows, right?

40:14.560 --> 40:15.560
Oh, sure.

40:15.560 --> 40:16.560
Yeah, sure.

40:16.560 --> 40:17.560
Yeah.

40:17.560 --> 40:18.560
Right.

40:18.560 --> 40:19.560
So it's like, eh, this feels kind of icky.

40:19.560 --> 40:22.120
And also there's the whole like we have to run things in the CLR and it's like, eh, this

40:22.120 --> 40:24.280
is really how we want to architect this.

40:24.280 --> 40:28.960
So then there were two other languages in content or three, there was Go, but Go got

40:28.960 --> 40:32.480
dismissed because nobody on the team has done any Go.

40:32.480 --> 40:38.520
And it's like, there's not even like one granddad who can come in and like guide us all to glory.

40:38.520 --> 40:41.000
So that's that, you know, that makes a big difference.

40:41.000 --> 40:45.440
You need team, especially at least one person on the team that you think could at least

40:45.440 --> 40:47.200
train everybody else, right?

40:47.200 --> 40:51.440
But if nobody's got it right and help it like crazy tool chain problems, right?

40:51.440 --> 40:52.680
So yeah.

40:52.680 --> 40:57.880
So then we were left at Rust and C++ and the battle began.

40:57.880 --> 41:02.920
And the irony is our emailer Drew hates both Rust and C, or doesn't hate Rust, but he definitely

41:02.920 --> 41:03.920
hates C++.

41:03.920 --> 41:04.920
Yeah.

41:04.920 --> 41:06.200
Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo.

41:06.200 --> 41:08.160
So it was a battle of the languages.

41:08.160 --> 41:09.880
Battle of the languages.

41:09.880 --> 41:11.520
There were a couple reasons.

41:11.520 --> 41:13.840
So there's a few things here.

41:13.840 --> 41:18.640
I personally was buying into the Rust Kool Aid on the whole safety thing and security

41:18.640 --> 41:19.640
thing.

41:19.640 --> 41:22.280
And I think that's mostly, mostly fair, right?

41:22.280 --> 41:27.400
I don't think that's really, I don't think that's too hyped up, but there was the realities

41:27.400 --> 41:31.840
of other than me, no one on the team has done any Rust in any significant amount.

41:31.840 --> 41:35.840
I have done some, but I don't day-to-day work in Rust.

41:35.840 --> 41:40.080
We have all done C++ at various points in our lives.

41:40.080 --> 41:45.640
Some of us more recently than others, I got down this rabbit hole of people blogging and

41:45.640 --> 41:48.880
doing content on quote modern C++.

41:48.880 --> 41:50.340
Have you heard of these guys?

41:50.340 --> 41:54.560
This kind of rings a, it's like a way like to do C++ safely.

41:54.560 --> 42:00.200
It's so since C++ 14 and we're on 20 now, 23 is going to be the next version.

42:00.200 --> 42:01.200
Whoa.

42:01.200 --> 42:02.200
Okay.

42:02.200 --> 42:03.200
Yeah.

42:03.200 --> 42:07.040
They're added a bunch of features that basically, I mean, a lot of them are like aping other

42:07.040 --> 42:14.080
languages, but that basically smooth over some of the rough, rough aspects of C++.

42:14.080 --> 42:19.400
One in particular as a group, they're called smart pointers and there's, I'm not going

42:19.400 --> 42:25.280
to dig into this too much, but they are very reminiscent to me of before Ark, how you could

42:25.280 --> 42:30.600
do Objective-C had some, they're not, I can't remember what the right name for this is,

42:30.600 --> 42:33.680
but they're not macros, but like you could tell it what kind of pointer you wanted and

42:33.680 --> 42:35.800
there were different rules based on that.

42:35.800 --> 42:41.280
And then granted Objective-C had auto release pools, which C++ kind of doesn't and it does

42:41.280 --> 42:42.720
things a little differently.

42:42.720 --> 42:47.480
But it was familiar enough to me that I was like, one, is it, could this be my new Objective-C

42:47.480 --> 42:50.240
because that makes me very happy.

42:50.240 --> 42:55.660
And two, it really makes me a little more confident in doing this job in C++ because

42:55.660 --> 43:01.720
this is an internal project, which means we're going to have to not use all the senior people

43:01.720 --> 43:03.420
on it all the time.

43:03.420 --> 43:06.040
Then I got digging even further.

43:06.040 --> 43:07.940
I downloaded C line.

43:07.940 --> 43:16.440
I installed my Dracula theme and I wrote what I can only describe as a flashback program.

43:16.440 --> 43:23.280
I know it's not Objective-C. I know the programming paradigm is somewhat different.

43:23.280 --> 43:28.800
It felt like when you come home to like your town you grew up in and you haven't been there

43:28.800 --> 43:34.720
in like 15 years, it's different, but there's a little bit of nostalgia there.

43:34.720 --> 43:39.520
Just typing to release memory was a joy.

43:39.520 --> 43:43.000
Just having the star, the pointer symbol there was magical.

43:43.000 --> 43:48.120
We're going to need a drink for this.

43:48.120 --> 43:55.120
As memories flowed over me, the song by Big Red holding back the years started playing

43:55.120 --> 43:56.600
in my head.

43:56.600 --> 44:05.200
I quickly popped open another window to create a subdirectory with its own CMake.list.

44:05.200 --> 44:10.960
And all the while, Sea Lion before my eyes and Pop OS before my eyes are turning into

44:10.960 --> 44:14.060
Xcode and Snow Leopard respectively.

44:14.060 --> 44:15.900
I'm going back.

44:15.900 --> 44:18.440
My skin is getting smoother and lighter.

44:18.440 --> 44:20.800
My eyes are like more blue.

44:20.800 --> 44:22.360
I mean it's amazing.

44:22.360 --> 44:23.360
Like the good old days.

44:23.360 --> 44:26.880
I think I may have found.

44:26.880 --> 44:34.240
Now of course Objective-C was my first love, my high school sweetheart.

44:34.240 --> 44:36.120
We were together a long time.

44:36.120 --> 44:37.880
We made many apps together.

44:37.880 --> 44:40.040
It'll always have a place in my heart.

44:40.040 --> 44:41.440
But it's time to move on.

44:41.440 --> 44:46.520
It's time to find a new programming language that also has pointers and scary memory leaks

44:46.520 --> 44:50.360
so I can torture people in job interviews.

44:50.360 --> 44:52.080
And I think it could be.

44:52.080 --> 44:54.160
Now I'm not trying to be too forward.

44:54.160 --> 44:58.480
I'm only texting C++ when it texts back because I'm not, you know what I mean?

44:58.480 --> 44:59.480
You don't want that buildup.

44:59.480 --> 45:00.480
Yeah.

45:00.480 --> 45:01.480
Yeah.

45:01.480 --> 45:02.480
Yeah.

45:02.480 --> 45:03.480
And you don't want to come across too strong.

45:03.480 --> 45:04.480
Too like whatever.

45:04.480 --> 45:10.200
I installed C Lion, I even installed Clang to really just see like, hey, you know, I'm

45:10.200 --> 45:12.000
open to stuff.

45:12.000 --> 45:15.480
And yeah, I think we're going to make a go of it with C++.

45:15.480 --> 45:18.800
I find this point that you're kind of touching on there in there a little bit is kind of

45:18.800 --> 45:23.480
being back in like the golden era of tools again a little bit.

45:23.480 --> 45:27.160
Like there is a, in like we were kind of in, we were kind of an old cranky man territory

45:27.160 --> 45:28.160
there for a bit.

45:28.160 --> 45:33.960
But I agree in all of this noise and mess, some of this stuff is better than it ever

45:33.960 --> 45:34.960
has been.

45:34.960 --> 45:37.720
I'm just going to say CMake and CTest are still great.

45:37.720 --> 45:39.680
Kind of making me feel like the good old days in some way.

45:39.680 --> 45:41.680
So it's not all, it's not all bad.

45:41.680 --> 45:43.600
You know what that said, I'm popping open Emacs.

45:43.600 --> 45:44.600
That's it.

45:44.600 --> 45:51.520
We're going to, we're going to.

45:51.520 --> 45:55.360
So how's the rest of the team coping with your discoveries?

45:55.360 --> 45:57.000
I mean, are they on board?

45:57.000 --> 45:58.440
Is there some skill sets there?

45:58.440 --> 46:02.840
There definitely was an age discrepancy in the response.

46:02.840 --> 46:08.540
The fellow, and actually one of them is significantly older than me, we're very excited.

46:08.540 --> 46:12.200
Thank God I don't have to use this crap with these NPM packages anymore and the stupid

46:12.200 --> 46:13.260
pip and all.

46:13.260 --> 46:15.560
So yeah, there was a lot of, there was some of that.

46:15.560 --> 46:20.200
There was a little bit of, I don't know if I remember how to do manual memory management,

46:20.200 --> 46:21.880
but that's okay.

46:21.880 --> 46:22.880
Because you know what?

46:22.880 --> 46:24.920
Florida's employee at will.

46:24.920 --> 46:26.920
Was that?

46:26.920 --> 46:32.720
No, I mean, no, I just think that, you know, it's, I mean, it's, it's a little

46:32.720 --> 46:33.720
direct.

46:33.720 --> 46:36.280
He's a jackass.

46:36.280 --> 46:37.280
But you know, it is business.

46:37.280 --> 46:38.280
Business?

46:38.280 --> 46:39.280
Yeah, it is business.

46:39.280 --> 46:40.280
No, I'm joking.

46:40.280 --> 46:41.280
Of course.

46:41.280 --> 46:42.280
Sort of.

46:42.280 --> 46:43.280
Not really.

46:43.280 --> 46:47.560
It's seriously, it is something about working in a language that doesn't want me to tinsel

46:47.560 --> 46:51.400
together 47 packages off of some random GitHub repo.

46:51.400 --> 46:53.520
It's, it's refreshing.

46:53.520 --> 46:57.360
It's like how programming used to be before we all went insane.

46:57.360 --> 47:02.000
Oh, and one of the big improvements before somebody writes into the show with a C plus

47:02.000 --> 47:04.160
plus, I think it came in.

47:04.160 --> 47:05.160
Someone will correct us in the feedback.

47:05.160 --> 47:10.600
I think it came in at 17 or 14, um, or strings that make sense because that was one of the

47:10.600 --> 47:12.400
big like issues.

47:12.400 --> 47:13.640
All right.

47:13.640 --> 47:16.680
So I want, I want the audience's diagnosis.

47:16.680 --> 47:22.520
What do you think of Mike's revelation coder dot show slash contact, share your opinions
