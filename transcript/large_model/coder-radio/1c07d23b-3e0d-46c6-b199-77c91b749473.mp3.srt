00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
This is KOTOR Radio, episode 383 for October 12th, 2020.

2
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Hello, friends, and welcome in to KOTOR Radio,

3
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Jupiter Broadcasting's weekly talk show,

4
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
taking a pragmatic look at the art and business of software development

5
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
and the world of technology.

6
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
This episode is brought to you by a Cloud Guru.

7
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Looking to make a high-paying career move?

8
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
No better place to start than a certification.

9
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
ACG has helped more than 2 million people skill up on the cloud.

10
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
AWS Azure, Google Cloud, exam preps, you're covered.

11
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Go to cloudguru.com.

12
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,000
My name is Chris, and joining me, like our man that we've snuck down to Florida

13
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
to monitor all the strange ones, it's our host, Mr. Dominic.

14
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Hello, Mike.

15
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Hang on, let me rip my shirt off and do a keg stand.

16
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
That's the only way they won't find me out.

17
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I hope you have a Superman shirt underneath that.

18
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
You just paint the S on your chest, actually, in Florida.

19
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Yeah, well, I think you got to commit.

20
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Go tattoo. I mean, why not?

21
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Then you're always ready, you know? You're always ready with that.

22
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Just have to go for it, right? Yeah.

23
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Have you had a good weekend in a week since we've gathered here today?

24
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Because, you know, we record on a Monday, so it's like a whole lifetime goes by.

25
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Yeah, time does move differently in Florida, much like hell.

26
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I'm kidding.

27
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Oh, geez.

28
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Sort of.

29
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Yeah, no, things have been pretty interesting.

30
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I have been tooling around VIM, which I think we're going to talk about.

31
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Oh, yeah, we're going to get there. Yeah, we're going to get there.

32
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:52,000
And, you know, apparently a blood war that I thought had ended rages, rages on.

33
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Indeed, a blood war that we have covered for a while.

34
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Maybe it's worth mentioning if you're listening to this when it's released, which is all of you, for the most part.

35
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Yes, there was an Apple event, and yes, it's the day before we actually record.

36
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
So, no, we don't have many thoughts on it.

37
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:13,000
If there is something worth talking about for this show, I'm sure we'll cover it in a future episode.

38
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:19,000
But there's plenty of plenty of places to get coverage on the announcements.

39
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I think if you're looking for Apple podcasts, that might be the easiest thing to find.

40
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Yeah, and if you're looking for news about Apple, boy, you could pretty much just fall into it.

41
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:33,000
So but if there's some interesting nugget in there, I think we'll pull it out and talk about it.

42
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
We, you know, we don't expect a whole lot yet, but who knows?

43
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
So let's start with the feedback. What do you say? You ready for the feedback?

44
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
I really hope you didn't offend any SUSE users again.

45
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:48,000
One last SUSE one. Sebastian writes in with what I what I expect to be the last note from the Lizards.

46
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
He says, Hello, Chris and Michael. I probably laughed harder.

47
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,000
That's great. I probably laughed harder during show 381 than contractually permitted.

48
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:01,000
To be honest, I work at a German public IT company and I would like to second what a listener wrote in.

49
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:08,000
We deploy different Linux distributions in our data centers, but for historic reasons, the standard is SUSE.

50
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:15,000
So it gets used quite a lot. And I can confirm that having a certified OS for use in a critical environment does play its part here,

51
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:20,000
which is why we also have a bunch of hellish sap on SUSE machines.

52
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:27,000
My soul grows colder and the cozy feeling of being at home on the command line vanishes.

53
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Every time I log into an operating system that would not survive a magic wand roundup, things are just subtly different.

54
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,000
The package repos contain practically nothing beyond the absolute basics.

55
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:43,000
And don't get me started on the Windows Wizards for Linux, a.k.a. Yast.

56
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:48,000
We were actually evaluating Rancher as a Kubernetes platform before SUSE acquired it.

57
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
And now I just hope they don't break it.

58
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:56,000
The ups and downs of SUSE as a company and the ever changing fate of OpenSUSE did not help their cause either.

59
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,000
OK, that's critical, but he does kind of wrap it up with a bow.

60
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Nevertheless, Chris bravely finished his lizard rant on a positive note.

61
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:08,000
So let me add that if you are German based and strive to work on a Linux distribution for a living,

62
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,000
SUSE is still your best and really only chance.

63
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:17,000
There are a lot of capable engineers at the company and they still ship products that are a little odd but working.

64
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:24,000
After all, the kinds of folks I call my admin colleagues managed to get a huge SUSE based infrastructure working really smoothly.

65
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,000
And Zipper has a small number of functions that I'd like to see an apt one day.

66
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:33,000
So that's fair enough. He says, thanks so much and greetings from Germany, Sebastian.

67
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:37,000
You know, I think that's probably we've said everything on this.

68
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:43,000
And it's funny because here we, you know, normally here our hot take would be, oh, the operating system doesn't really matter anymore.

69
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
It's all about containers in the web.

70
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:52,000
And yet for four weeks we have been talking about the operating system and why it matters.

71
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,000
And then all of the passion that still is around that topic.

72
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
So I think the operating system might matter still. That's my take.

73
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:06,000
I think the important thing is we're wrapping up all the SUSE talk with someone at an IT, at an ISP, he said.

74
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Yeah, I think so. Well, he said he's in a public IT company.

75
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Public IT company in, of course, Germany. So we've come full circle.

76
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
We thought it was Germany only.

77
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:21,000
And as I have been told privately at least a dozen times now, again, thank you, Chris.

78
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
You're welcome.

79
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,000
People do use SUSE in the United States and they don't like any sass about that.

80
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:33,000
That's the great thing is Chris runs his mouth on the show and then Mike ends up hearing about it in meetings.

81
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Yeah, that's good natured, but yep.

82
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
And all the SUSE people came out of the woodwork.

83
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Yeah, it was just like, did we put the lizard signal up like in Gotham where all of a sudden just bam, they're there.

84
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
I think it's a smell thing. I think I think lizards have a good sense of smell.

85
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Oh, God. You know what, though?

86
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:55,000
This gentleman is not the only person to message me about Rancher OS.

87
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Oh, they were trying to backdoor me into SUSE again. See how they did that because it doesn't say SUSE on it.

88
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Right. Oh, yeah, that's a it's like the cereal brand will have a generic brand and then they have like the name brand cereal.

89
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
It's like their container or whatever thing you can do.

90
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Mm hmm. Yeah.

91
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:15,000
OK, you feel I feel complete. I mean, if people still need to send it in.

92
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:21,000
I mean, we don't get to say when the war is over, you know, they could keep the airstrikes can continue, but we'll see what happens.

93
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Well, we're good. So Jonathan Meeks writes back in.

94
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
He says, I have a theory about a gray matter developer.

95
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
So, you know, we have the black matter developers.

96
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
He wants to propose the gray matter developer.

97
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Hey, Chris and Mike, glad to hear the show's back.

98
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
I've missed it. Thanks for the shout out recently in 382.

99
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
I think I might be a gray matter developer, he writes.

100
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:45,000
I work at a major home improvement retailer and we're making strides towards a startup mentality.

101
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:55,000
I develop in Java, but we are on the latest LTS and debating on jumping into the six month release cycle to get access to some really awesome features in the language.

102
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Since day one of my job, we've been developing software that runs on the cloud instead of on individual servers.

103
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:11,000
And in my mind, a gray matter developer is someone who develops for the enterprise, but tries to bring the innovation collaboration mentality and whatnot to the enterprise development process.

104
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:19,000
We might be constrained in some ways, but we are given more flexibility to choose the tools instead of being locked in on a particular language or framework.

105
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:23,000
In my mind, the dark matter developer would be someone who is locked into a language.

106
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Maybe they're told you have to use Java 8 by the higher ups, where a gray matter developer could be someone who can use Java with a minimum version set to the latest LTS or make some other nuanced choices along with other popular frameworks.

107
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
They have the understanding that they're on the hook for support, of course.

108
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Anyways, I thought maybe it's a random thought.

109
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Maybe there's a gray matter developer out there who works in enterprise, but has a little more flexibility on the tools they choose.

110
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Do you buy it? I don't know if I buy it.

111
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
I don't think the distinction is strong enough, to be honest with you.

112
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:59,000
I don't think saying someone works at a corporate development job is necessarily akin to saying they don't get to pick what tools they use.

113
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
And that's really what defines the dark matter developers.

114
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Someone who is working at a corporation writing tools for that corporation.

115
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:12,000
It's a valuable position, but it's not like writing front end websites for Amazon.com.

116
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:20,000
It's a steady paced nine to five development job with different levels of support requirements and criticalness and different tools they use.

117
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:25,000
But the concept is it's somebody's day job and it's not something that we talk about in the tech press.

118
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
It doesn't get a lot of gloss and glamour.

119
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Yeah, I mean, I think I mostly agree with you.

120
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,000
I think he does make a point that there is maybe it's not binary, right?

121
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Like, yeah, maybe there's like, you know, Sour on the Black, Sour on the White and Gandalf the Gray somewhere in the middle there.

122
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Yeah, but although Sour on the White is problematic for lots of reasons there, because spoilers for things from the 40s or 50s.

123
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Or to make an analogy to good and evil Spock from the mirror universe, you know, evil Spock is still kind of good Spock in some ways.

124
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
It's a gray area.

125
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Right. What if you have like half a goatee?

126
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Right. Yeah, right.

127
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:06,000
I mean, yeah, there's definitely going to be some gradations of like, oh, you work at giant outsourcing IT shop and you are writing Java 8 until the day you die.

128
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Godspeed or you're working at some crazy little company where we just do like Skunk Works projects all the time just to keep ourselves sharp.

129
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
I think there's probably stuff in the middle of that.

130
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Having said that, I think the pure dark matter developer, you know, Scott Hanselman coined that phrase years ago.

131
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:32,000
And the idea was that it is not just at the time he was kind of, you know, digging on the Ruby people a little bit.

132
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:37,000
It's not just the cool hipsters with gold MacBooks sitting under a tree writing beautiful Ruby code, right?

133
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Right.

134
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
It's people who, you know, wear a white T-shirt tucked in.

135
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
They get to wear jeans on Friday.

136
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,000
And, you know, they're sitting, goddammit, they're sitting with Visual Basic.

137
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
That's how their granddaddy did it.

138
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
That's how they're doing it.

139
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Or something.

140
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Right.

141
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
I feel like if we attribute the tools, then I don't know.

142
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Well, I'm teasing about Visual Basic.

143
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Some very conservative technology.

144
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Right.

145
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Probably Java or.Net of some sort.

146
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Yep.

147
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Yeah.

148
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
So, I take the point.

149
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:08,000
I mean, I wish we actually heard more from people in the dark matter world.

150
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,000
But I guess then they wouldn't be dark matter people anymore.

151
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:16,000
It's sort of like how we never hear from 99% of the audience.

152
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Right.

153
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,000
You know, what we hear from is between 1 and 5% at most.

154
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Because I would, too.

155
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:28,000
I would like to basically build a little understanding from the audience of what the average workload is.

156
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
And I want to know all kinds of things, too.

157
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Like, do you work from home now?

158
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Is it more common to work from home?

159
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Were you commuting into work before all the COVID stuff?

160
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
And has that changed?

161
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Like, I'm curious about what operating systems they let you use and all of it.

162
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:46,000
I just, you know, I would love to have, if you're just in a corporate development job,

163
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,000
working a regular job, getting, you know, a paycheck and all of that.

164
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Look at that 9-2-5.

165
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Maybe you even have health benefits.

166
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
I'm not sure how that works.

167
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
I don't know what that is.

168
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
What is that?

169
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
I hope you have health benefits.

170
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
I do not.

171
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Oh, man.

172
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Actually, I do.

173
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
I have Obamacare.

174
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
But the deductibles, who, baby?

175
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Yeah.

176
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
I have an idea.

177
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Yeah.

178
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Obviously, we've been doing this for, like, eight years.

179
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
No, has it only been eight years?

180
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Maybe it's more.

181
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
I think it's more than that.

182
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:19,000
You know, the SUSE people, we didn't hear from them for all that time until you, you know, insulted them.

183
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:25,000
So why don't we once a week pick a technology group and just be, like, really mean to them?

184
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
You know who are probably developers?

185
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
All those dark matter developers.

186
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,000
They probably don't know shit about current trends, and they probably...

187
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
There you go.

188
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
I like it.

189
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
I like it.

190
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Yeah.

191
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
That's just how we have to solicit it.

192
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
That really is so true.

193
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
God, if that isn't how the internet works.

194
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
All right.

195
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
You write in before we have to get mean, okay?

196
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
You've been warned out there.

197
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Don't force them.

198
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
All right.

199
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
So Dinesh writes in.

200
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Kind of speaking of the corporate developer thing, he says, thanks for the show.

201
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
I've only started listening since the reboot.

202
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,000
And get this, he says he's gutted that he didn't discover it earlier.

203
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
How about that?

204
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,000
He says, I would have been wiser with my tech choices.

205
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Well, there is some of that.

206
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
We make mistakes, so you don't have to.

207
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
That's true.

208
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,000
He says, I listen to you guys talk about rust in the latest code of radio.

209
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:11,000
And one thing that struck out to me is when Chris mentioned about corporate development

210
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
and being a slow ship to turn.

211
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:18,000
I've been working at my current job for more than two years now, and I couldn't agree more with Chris.

212
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
It becomes frustrating at times.

213
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:25,000
I recently have been flirting with the idea of stepping away and working as a freelancer.

214
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:29,000
I would like to know what you guys think about working as a freelance developer

215
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:33,000
and if the global market has enough space to employ such a kind of service provider.

216
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Once again, thanks a lot for the show and wishing JB all of the best with an indie future.

217
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:42,000
So Dinesh comes in with what is essentially a perennial question on the show is,

218
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,000
can market sustain developer?

219
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
And I want to go indie.

220
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
I've done the corporate thing and I want to go indie.

221
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Dinesh is somebody who is indie.

222
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
I got to say, think about it really hard.

223
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:58,000
This has got to be my standard advice now, I think on the show.

224
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:03,000
But I'm not trying to stop you from what you're doing because if you got an idea

225
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,000
and you think you can pull it off, you should go for it because you only live once.

226
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:11,000
However, humans always see the grass greener on the other side of the fence.

227
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:16,000
So here's what I've just been thinking about the last couple of days is,

228
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,000
this is so much harder than I remember running my own business.

229
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:27,000
I mean, it's a good kind of hard and like the victories are juicier and sweeter

230
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:34,000
and the defeats are more, for me at least, I can tuck and roll a little bit easier.

231
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
I don't know.

232
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
There's something about when I'm in the driver's seat and if I scraped the fender,

233
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:42,000
I get less mad than if somebody is borrowing my car and they scraped the fender.

234
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
And then all of a sudden I'm like, oh, how could you do something like that?

235
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
How could you have been so careless?

236
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,000
It's like that when I own and run my own business.

237
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
If I scratched the fender, well, okay, that's on me.

238
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,000
But if my boss is driving the car and they scratched the fender,

239
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
then my boss is an idiot.

240
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
I hate working for a company.

241
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,000
I don't like knowing, you know, so there are advantages and disadvantages,

242
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
but I will tell you this, Dinesh.

243
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,000
It's harder than I thought and I've done it before.

244
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
So think about that.

245
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Think about how the mind can play tricks on you.

246
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:10,000
I've done this job before and it's harder than I remember.

247
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:15,000
And there's like a lot of nice things about just knowing a paycheck's coming in

248
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:19,000
and having health insurance and building up a retirement fund

249
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:23,000
and having free time to explore your own projects.

250
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,000
There's a lot of nice things about having a jobby job.

251
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
There's a lot of nice things about working for yourself, too,

252
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
and I don't want to dissuade you,

253
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:34,000
but I do feel a bit of a responsibility as somebody who's two,

254
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:38,000
three months into going independent again after a few years of not being independent.

255
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
It's a big commitment.

256
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:44,000
And to answer your question, if the market can sustain something like this,

257
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,000
I'll give my quick answer to that and then I'll turn it over to you, Mike.

258
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:52,000
And that simply is if you have a different enough product that somebody needs,

259
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
you'll find a market for it.

260
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:57,000
So, you know, there's the elephant in the room of COVID, right?

261
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:04,000
The things I would say if you wanted to be a freelance dev in 2019 are just not viable right now, right?

262
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:08,000
I would say definitely take some time, go to conferences, network,

263
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:13,000
try to hook up with either larger dev shops or people that will give you maybe not the best rate you would get,

264
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:17,000
but, you know, consistent work to fill out those fallow periods,

265
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,000
because especially when you start, those are going to exist.

266
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Don't waste time tinkering with, like, nonsense.

267
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
You got to get stuff done.

268
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:29,000
You have to be very efficient as a freelancer relative to, you know, whatever.

269
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Like, if you know SUSE, then I'm not even kidding, right?

270
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Like, if SUSE Server is your thing, then don't even worry about it.

271
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Just work on SUSE Server, right?

272
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Ubuntu is your desktop OS of choice.

273
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Don't feel like you have to, like, go buy a Mac and vice versa.

274
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:48,000
You got to just – I guess because you don't have the safety net, like Chris is saying,

275
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:55,000
you really don't have the luxury of just, like, tooling around for the sake of, like, you know, tooling around, right?

276
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Yeah, well said.

277
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:00,000
In the past, I would have, again, recommended that you go to a bunch of conferences,

278
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,000
maybe even try to pick up a side freelance gig and see how you like it,

279
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:07,000
but over the years, I don't actually think that's too viable anymore.

280
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:11,000
So my question to you would be absolutely if you want to go do it, do it,

281
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:16,000
but do you have a way to get that first customer to book you?

282
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:20,000
And you're not going to book 40 hours a week, so let's say 20 to 30 a week.

283
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:26,000
That doesn't mean you're not working more than that, but it just means you're billing at 20 to 30 a week.

284
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Do you have that first customer, someone like right off the top of your head that you could call right now

285
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:36,000
and pitch them and be relatively confident that they would be able to, you know, work out a contract with you?

286
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Yeah, that is a great point.

287
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:45,000
When I decided to go independent again, I first brainstormed about who I would like to have as sponsors,

288
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
and those are my clients, right?

289
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:51,000
And in my mind, I thought, you know, System76 and Linode.

290
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Like, I knew immediately that those would be the people that if I had my first choice who I'd want to work with.

291
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:02,000
And I knew once I started to have a conversation with them that things were going in the right direction,

292
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
I was like, okay, this is going to work.

293
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Now, you can take that and kind of translate that to your field of work.

294
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:13,000
If you have somebody that you think you could probably call up or email and start working with them,

295
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,000
then that really is probably step one.

296
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Start getting paid and figure that out, figure out invoicing, figure out all that.

297
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,000
To Mike's point, be ruthless with your time.

298
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:30,000
You know, I talked to a guy one time who was just convinced he was really a competent Ubuntu administrator,

299
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:34,000
but he was convinced that to go independent, he needed to go get Red Hat certified.

300
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:40,000
And he burned three months doing that and spent money and a lot of stress and energy.

301
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,000
I don't really think it changed the game for him much.

302
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
I mean, he was now qualified for a different system.

303
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:52,000
But in the end, you just have to focus on what you're good at and be willing to be a little ruthless

304
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,000
and think about it in terms of survival.

305
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
It really is about survival.

306
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:00,000
And you'll have the luxury to think about it differently once you have things rolling,

307
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,000
income is coming in, maybe you've even staffed up a little bit.

308
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:08,000
That's when you have the luxury to start thinking about it from a more higher level,

309
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,000
entrepreneurial, grandiose vision level.

310
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
But at the moment, you have to execute.

311
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,000
And do keep us updated on how it goes, Dinesh.

312
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Even if you decide not to, I'd love to know your rationale or reason for that too,

313
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
or if you decide to pursue it and how it goes.

314
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
We'd love to follow your journey.

315
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
And not to be too doom and gloom.

316
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:30,000
It's certainly possible to do, and if you feel passionate about it

317
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:34,000
and you have a good idea of ways forward, by all means, charge.

318
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Linode.com slash coder.

319
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Go there to get a 60-day, $100 credit towards your new account.

320
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
They're my hosting provider.

321
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
I've known about Linode forever.

322
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
They've been around since 2003.

323
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:50,000
They got started three years before AWS got started.

324
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,000
And I followed them at community events like Linux Fest Northwest,

325
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:57,000
which they're sponsors of and have helped to make it possible.

326
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
But they're great.

327
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,000
They provide easy access virtual servers

328
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
so you can host anything you want in the cloud.

329
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Maybe you just want storage.

330
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
They have S3-compatible object storage.

331
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Or maybe you want to host your website or a portfolio.

332
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Linode can help you there too.

333
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Linode.com slash coder.

334
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:18,000
I started using Linode a couple of years ago when I had sold Jupiter Broadcasting.

335
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
I wanted to keep my personal stuff separate.

336
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,000
You know, separation between church and state sort of thing.

337
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,000
And I started using Linode and realized how great they were.

338
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,000
And I watched them over the last couple of years just get better and better.

339
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
And now how perfect is it?

340
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Here we are bringing Jupiter Broadcasting independent again.

341
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,000
And we get to work with a company like Linode to make it possible.

342
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Linode.com slash coder.

343
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Go there, support the show, and get a $100 60-day credit.

344
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,000
And you're also supporting a sponsor that's making it possible

345
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
for us to go independent again.

346
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Unlike entry-level hosting services that lock you into their platform,

347
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Linode gives you full back-end access to customize and control your server

348
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
to fit your needs.

349
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
I love their new Cloud Manager UI.

350
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
I mean, new to me.

351
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
It's been around for a little while now.

352
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,000
But when I first started using Linode, I was watching them make some of these

353
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:09,000
upgrades and improvements that now blow everyone away.

354
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Enterprise-grade hardware, next-generation network,

355
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,000
and 11 data centers around the world.

356
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:19,000
And as you know, Linode costs 30 to 50% less than major cloud providers

357
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
like AWS or Azure.

358
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
And they've been around longer than Azure.

359
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,000
They're the largest independent cloud provider, period.

360
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Fully independent, and they're awesome.

361
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,000
This last weekend, I decided I'd set up a Minecraft server.

362
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
One-click deployment for a Minecraft server.

363
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,000
It's pretty simple, but you can build it up from scratch

364
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,000
to anything that runs on Linux will run on Linode.

365
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
So go to Linode.com slash coder.

366
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Get that $100 day credit for 60 days and support the show.

367
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Linode.com slash coder.

368
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
I learned something new today.

369
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:56,000
I learned, or at least was reminded about the traveling salesman problem,

370
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,000
which I think maybe I'd heard you mention to me once before,

371
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
but had completely forgotten.

372
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:05,000
And now it appears there's been a significant breakthrough.

373
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:09,000
As one of the scientists put it, her career is now complete.

374
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
Well, there you go.

375
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
What else can you say to that?

376
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
So I kind of looked into this.

377
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:19,000
The traveling salesman is an optimization problem at the core of it, right?

378
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:24,000
It's a handful of foundational problems that theoretical computer scientists

379
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:29,000
then can use to see how efficient they are at solving a problem computationally.

380
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:32,000
For example, the traveling salesman is like routing to cities

381
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
and trying to make the most efficient routes.

382
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Yeah, so traveling sales problem,

383
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,000
it's one of these old computer science problems,

384
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,000
something that really like math nerds who might program in Julia

385
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,000
would really get excited about.

386
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:49,000
There are potentially some practical uses for this breakthrough

387
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:55,000
if they can, you know, make it more than a basically academic paper, right?

388
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
Not to downplay it, it's pretty awesome, it's pretty great.

389
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:00,000
And it suggests there is more runway to optimizations

390
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
than perhaps previously thought.

391
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Exactly.

392
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:07,000
So it suggests there's more headroom without going into like crazy quantum computing

393
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
and like stuff like that.

394
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Like there's more computer science algorithmic work that can be done.

395
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
And doesn't that make us all happy?

396
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:17,000
Thrills me, Mike, it thrills me.

397
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
So Hayden Barnes wrote a post titled,

398
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:24,000
No, Microsoft is not rebasing Windows to Linux.

399
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,000
He says, I have a unique perspective on Microsoft's Linux involvement.

400
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:30,000
I helped deliver Ubuntu on the Windows subsystem for Linux

401
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
in my day job at Canonical.

402
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:36,000
I also get briefings on Microsoft products as an MVP.

403
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:41,000
I am deeply skeptical of the notion that Microsoft is going to shift the core

404
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
of the Windows operating system to the Linux kernel

405
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:46,000
for both product and engineering reasons.

406
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:52,000
And then he proceeds to slay the idea with tons of reasonable rational reasons

407
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:56,000
that Microsoft would never rebase Windows on Linux.

408
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:00,000
Not to point out that it's clearly just got all of the pieces of clickbait

409
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:04,000
for tech articles too, which should immediately make one skeptical.

410
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:07,000
Well, I know one draft that I'm deleting. Thanks, Hayden.

411
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:14,000
You know, he makes a point in here that I thought was like interesting.

412
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
I don't know.

413
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:18,000
Maybe it's not telling, but to me it seemed particularly telling.

414
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,000
He says, one of the reasons it's unclear if Windows user space

415
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,000
could even be rebased from NT to the Linux kernel

416
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,000
and maintain some compatibility that Windows is known for.

417
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:32,000
So get this, the NT kernel has 400 documented syscalls

418
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:36,000
plus about 1700 documented Win32 API calls.

419
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:43,000
Linux has 313 syscalls on AMD64. Total.

420
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:46,000
Part of the reason Microsoft switched from a syscall translation layer

421
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:51,000
with WSL1 to a virtualized kernel with WSL2

422
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:56,000
is because re-implementing all of these crazy calls

423
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,000
and non-standard ways developers had to exploit the Linux API

424
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
was, as he puts it, a pain in the ass.

425
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:05,000
So they just said, nope, we're going to do it with a virtual machine.

426
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:09,000
Also, he points out, and I agree, Microsoft has doubled down on Windows.

427
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:12,000
I feel like Windows 10 has gotten more attention from Microsoft

428
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
than we've seen in a while.

429
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:17,000
Okay, so I like Hayden. I know he's a great guy.

430
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
If you don't know, he works for Chronicle.

431
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:23,000
Focus listening on the Windows, WSL, Ubuntu stuff.

432
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,000
Right, great.

433
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,000
You guys both seem to think they've doubled down on Windows 10,

434
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
and I guess I missed it.

435
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
Oh, really? You don't see it?

436
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:35,000
Other than Paul Therot, I don't really read any deep Windows people.

437
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:40,000
And he's a touch cranky, we could say.

438
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,000
I don't know. I feel like if you look at it,

439
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:47,000
they've kept good with the promise of continually updating Windows.

440
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:51,000
They've created the different rings that you can subscribe to

441
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
to get improvements faster.

442
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:56,000
And through that, they have landed new stuff

443
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,000
from new versions of DirectX to a whole new version,

444
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
replacing an Explorer with Edge,

445
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:05,000
and WSL itself has been delivered this way.

446
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:08,000
To me, when I sit down to use Windows 10,

447
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:12,000
it feels like an operating system that is maintained.

448
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,000
It's recent, it's still getting active work is being done on it,

449
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:20,000
and there's usually a ton of shit in the Microsoft update and all of that.

450
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,000
And I get the sense that Microsoft is still investing

451
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
in using Windows 10 very heavily now.

452
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:29,000
Compared to a Linux distribution, it's a ghost town

453
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:32,000
in terms of updates and new things coming in and community involvement,

454
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:35,000
but from a corporate desktop platform,

455
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
it seems like it's still very active to me.

456
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:41,000
I guess it seems from the outside,

457
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:44,000
because honestly, I haven't installed Windows 10

458
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
since WSL 2 was released.

459
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
Or actually, when it was in preview.

460
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,000
And now we're getting somewhere. There we go.

461
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:54,000
Yeah, okay. Maybe if I had to daily drive it from time to time,

462
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,000
I wouldn't have this opinion.

463
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:58,000
Well, because the story we didn't put in the notes here

464
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:01,000
is their new GitHub code spaces, right?

465
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:05,000
Which is effectively VS code in the cloud, but super nice.

466
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,000
Yeah, yeah, right.

467
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,000
I feel like they're doing more and more to maybe not abstract,

468
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:12,000
but kind of deprioritize the actual desktop.

469
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:15,000
Well, see, this is where, again, I think I line up with Hayden.

470
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:18,000
He writes, they recognize a more diverse set of operating systems

471
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:21,000
and platforms are powering the computing devices we use,

472
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:24,000
which now includes Android, Ubuntu, iOS, Mac OS,

473
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:28,000
the Echo, Chrome OS, and ARM, not just even x86.

474
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
Microsoft has shown that it's able to adapt

475
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:34,000
by making relevant products and services available on those platforms

476
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:37,000
while simultaneously keeping their own platform competitive,

477
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
mostly, I would say.

478
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
And then that's not my addition.

479
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:44,000
And then he also points out how they've been driving some innovation

480
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,000
in the Android ecosystem even.

481
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:51,000
And I think what you have is a non-bomber Microsoft

482
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:54,000
that is willing to make money from all platforms

483
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,000
and is accepted that they missed the mark on mobile,

484
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
and as a result, there's a billion devices out there

485
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:02,000
that don't run their software, don't run their operating system,

486
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
and they've pivoted.

487
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:07,000
You know, it's cliche to say Saatchi and Adela has changed things,

488
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
but when you look at the changes throughout the entire stack

489
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:14,000
of the organization, it seems like they have very readily adapted

490
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:17,000
to an environment where they don't have to dominate the desktop

491
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:21,000
and the browser to be competitive, quote unquote.

492
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
Yeah, and I think at this point, Saatchi has been there long enough

493
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:26,000
that you can actually say that he really did change things.

494
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,000
You think?

495
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,000
Yeah, it's been a couple years, right?

496
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,000
It's been a few.

497
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,000
It's been a few.

498
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:34,000
Yeah, so I think they are just getting better at playing

499
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,000
in everyone's playground.

500
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:38,000
I know this has been my hobby horse for the last month,

501
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:41,000
but you mentioned ARM, so you did this yourself.

502
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
Okay.

503
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:48,000
They all need to know that the Klingon predators from Cupertino

504
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:53,000
are about to decloak on their faces, and with 20 hours of battery life,

505
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
blow them out of the water.

506
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,000
So I actually agree with you.

507
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:59,000
I bet you Microsoft is wise enough to be like,

508
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:02,000
we have to be able to, within a couple months,

509
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:07,000
say that Windows 10 can get on ARM Mac-like performance.

510
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:11,000
I know people don't love this take, but I firmly believe that,

511
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:14,000
you know what, Apple Silicon is going to be a home run for them.

512
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:17,000
Well, and look at how they've stepped up to the plate on,

513
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:22,000
I can speak to iOS, Android, maybe is different, but on iOS,

514
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:26,000
the Outlook app and the Office apps are good.

515
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,000
They're like really good.

516
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:33,000
I was surprised I had a client that I was doing several weeks' worth of work for,

517
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:36,000
so they just wanted me in their Teams, Microsoft Teams chat

518
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:39,000
for their meetings and their chat and file transfer,

519
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
and I was really kind of hesitant.

520
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:45,000
I didn't want to have to, you know, have yet another chat program

521
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:49,000
and use a Microsoft app that was going to be a substandard app and all of that,

522
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
and you know what, I was really impressed.

523
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:54,000
I was like, they actually tried.

524
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:57,000
They wrote it like it was a first-class platform,

525
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:00,000
and that change in mentality has been a big,

526
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
it's a big shift from where they were, say,

527
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:06,000
in the heydays of the late 90s and early 2000s.

528
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:09,000
Look, you have all the Windows OEMs, right?

529
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
Let's put them in an ancient town.

530
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
I don't know, let's maybe call it Shaka.

531
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
Let's put them in the town of Shaka.

532
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:20,000
They have this wall called Intel, and Shaka, the walls are falling.

533
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:24,000
I'm telling you, days are numbered.

534
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:27,000
Like whoever doesn't catch up is just getting blown away,

535
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:30,000
and it doesn't matter if you're Windows or Linux or what,

536
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:34,000
you're getting hammered because top-of-the-line performance

537
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:38,000
and possibly 20-hour battery life, you have to have an answer,

538
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,000
and you're right.

539
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:42,000
Maybe it may in fact be that we get some super-duper surface,

540
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
and like all these under-the-hood changes

541
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:47,000
that you and Hayden are talking about in Windows 10,

542
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:50,000
it makes a ton of sense to me, so yeah, you're right, I'm wrong,

543
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
that they probably are going to do it.

544
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:56,000
I think the reason, besides the fact that it's fantastic clickbait,

545
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:59,000
that this rumor keeps percolating,

546
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:02,000
and the same reason why the rumor keeps percolating

547
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:05,000
that Microsoft is going to acquire Canonical

548
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:09,000
is because there is some logic at the core of it.

549
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:12,000
It just kind of makes sense in a way.

550
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:16,000
Because when I do use Windows, bless its little soul,

551
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
it feels like something from the 90s to me.

552
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
What soul? Ooh, too much.

553
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
It just seems old.

554
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:26,000
It seems like it's based on an old technology platform,

555
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:29,000
and I think one of the most under-accredited things

556
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:33,000
that Microsoft suffers from, I guess,

557
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
is people don't give them enough credit

558
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:39,000
for how in some unbelievable fashion

559
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:42,000
they've managed to drag this code base

560
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:45,000
from the NT days to where we are now.

561
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:48,000
And I'm sure they've replaced large sections of it,

562
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:52,000
but still so much technical debt.

563
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:55,000
I mean, that must be what a large portion of the team focuses on,

564
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
is just resolving technical debt constantly.

565
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
So let me defend some technical debt here,

566
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:02,000
and this is going to be a mite confession time.

567
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
I have been, for the last several months,

568
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:08,000
aggressively recommending Surface Go tablets to customers.

569
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
Aggressively, you say?

570
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:13,000
Because many of my customers now have needs

571
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:16,000
that involve basically automating processes

572
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:19,000
and involve, like, weird hardware dongles, right?

573
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:23,000
Like, things like scales, sensors, all kinds of weird stuff.

574
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,000
Proximity sensors in one case.

575
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,000
All over USB.

576
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:29,000
Some over USB. Some over serial bus.

577
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,000
No.

578
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,000
Hey-oh, oh, yeah.

579
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,000
Jeez, that brings me back.

580
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
Morty, we're going back.

581
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,000
Wow.

582
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:38,000
And there is one operating system that stands alone

583
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:42,000
in terms of whatever crap we're going to order from overseas,

584
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:45,000
there's going to be a driver,

585
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:49,000
and if there's not, the random Windows generic drivers

586
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:53,000
are good enough that you can at least get the data off the serial port, right?

587
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:58,000
Yep, and there will likely be some really horribly designed application

588
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:01,000
that that weird hardware comes with that only works on Windows

589
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:04,000
and may have to have administrative privileges and all of that,

590
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,000
but it only works on Windows.

591
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:09,000
Well, and for our purposes, we're actually writing compatibility

592
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
with this hardware directly into custom applications

593
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
we're making for our clients.

594
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
So it's like we're going all the way down,

595
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:18,000
in many cases importing, like, com libraries to do this stuff.

596
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
But they still support those com libraries.

597
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
I just want to say that, right?

598
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
Like, it's still there.

599
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
Yeah, and that's one of the biggest arguments for,

600
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:29,000
or I should say against, this rebasing,

601
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:35,000
is that it would undermine one of the huge values

602
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:38,000
that it brings the enterprise space, is that level of compatibility,

603
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
which one day will have to go away.

604
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:44,000
I mean, ultimately, that's why I say the argument does make some sense

605
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:48,000
because all of these are extremely valid reasons in 2020,

606
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:51,000
but what about 2040?

607
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
I mean, I know that seems like forever away,

608
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
but it's just as far away into the future

609
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:58,000
as my history with Windows goes into the past, right?

610
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:02,000
It's not, I mean, it's within the realm of my lifetime.

611
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:05,000
There's just, I can't see it conceivable that there's still

612
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:08,000
a Windows desktop operating system running off an NT base.

613
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
It just doesn't seem conceivable in that time.

614
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:14,000
But can't you see some sort of like, you know, WNTL

615
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:17,000
or whatever you want to call it, some sort of system, right,

616
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
where they're basically just virtualizing a little NT kernel?

617
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:22,000
Of course, I mean, because CPU architectures could be different,

618
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,000
it's going to be virtualized.

619
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:26,000
And that's when, so when Hayden makes a lot of these arguments,

620
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:30,000
if you keep in the back of your mind, well, a really modern hypervisor

621
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:34,000
with direct hardware access that is even more capable

622
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:38,000
than something like what we see with WSL2 or KVM at its best,

623
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
something that's even maybe built in with CPU support

624
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:43,000
like Apple's doing with their virtualization on the Mac platform.

625
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:47,000
And now imagine that 20 plus years down the road, right?

626
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000
That could be just super high performance.

627
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
I mean, it could be virtualization in a sense,

628
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
but nothing like we think of it today.

629
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:56,000
And when those kinds of technologies are available,

630
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:59,000
it just seems preposterous to think that they wouldn't take advantage of it.

631
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,000
So if they were going to do something like that,

632
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:04,000
would they create a brand new operating system from scratch

633
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
with its own kernel and all of that?

634
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
Or would that be the time to switch?

635
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
It almost gets back to the CPU architecture stuff

636
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
because I have sort of been on the bandwagon

637
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
that like ARM is going to take over the world.

638
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,000
But what if it doesn't?

639
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,000
Yeah.

640
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:19,000
And somehow we see an explosion in like, you know,

641
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,000
Chris Lattner, I forgot the name of the firm he's working at,

642
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:24,000
but he's the guy who invented Swift or from Apple.

643
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:28,000
He's working with some company that's making like custom risk architectures for people.

644
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:32,000
And we could possibly, you know, this is not my argument,

645
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
but I've heard it before,

646
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
be in a world where there's like an explosion

647
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:40,000
in like bespoke custom architectures for really optimized devices.

648
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,000
Yeah.

649
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:44,000
I don't believe that for like business reasons of, you know,

650
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
scale and things have to make sense.

651
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:50,000
Well, except for, you know, the Mac becomes a type of use case.

652
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
The phone is a type of use case,

653
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:56,000
a desktop tower that's running risk processes or open power PC processors.

654
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:00,000
The thing, the argument I would give against ARM fully taking over.

655
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
I can absolutely see why it is,

656
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:05,000
why it is winning super hard in vertical solutions.

657
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:08,000
I really, it really makes a lot of sense on a vertical solution,

658
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
like what Apple or Samsung does.

659
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:15,000
But zooming out from there, ARM has been around for 20 plus years

660
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:19,000
and it really still hasn't managed to replace x86.

661
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:22,000
And I think part of the reason for that is,

662
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:25,000
it's still very complicated.

663
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,000
Like just look at the Linux support

664
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:32,000
and how when you want to boot Linux on an ARM small board computer,

665
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:35,000
you really need to get a kernel that supports that GPU

666
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:39,000
and that boot method on that particular SBC.

667
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:43,000
And you can't just take Ubuntu 18.04

668
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:46,000
and boot it on a Pine 64 or Rock Pro 64

669
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
and then go boot it on a Raspberry Pi 3.

670
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
It just, it doesn't work like that.

671
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:54,000
The developers have to put special effort into ensuring compatibility

672
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
with each one of those SBCs.

673
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
And it's not like that with x86.

674
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
You don't have to download a certain kernel

675
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:03,000
that works with gigabyte motherboards using Ryzen processor

676
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:06,000
and a gigabyte motherboard using an Intel processor with an Nvidia GPU.

677
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:10,000
You don't have to get an ISO that slices and dices it all the way down like that

678
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:13,000
because it's become a general compute platform.

679
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
ARM hasn't really reached that yet

680
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:18,000
because each implementation is to its own in a sense

681
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:21,000
because people are licensing and then building a system around that.

682
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:25,000
And what we have is a whole lot of fragmentation.

683
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:30,000
And you wonder if a totally open system like RISC or OpenPowerPC

684
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:35,000
wouldn't be a little bit more akin to that general computing platform.

685
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
Like it wouldn't be more of an easier transition.

686
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
It'd be more of a horizontal move.

687
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
Just some workloads would use RISC CPU.

688
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,000
Some workloads would use x86.

689
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,000
Some would use ARM.

690
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
Some would use OpenPowerPC.

691
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
And it would not become an assume

692
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
that the predominant workload is run on x86.

693
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
But it also wouldn't be ARM.

694
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:56,000
It's going to be this multiple CPU future, I suspect.

695
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
And then you'll have different vendors

696
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:01,000
who do these vertical integrations where they just nail it

697
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:05,000
and they just manage to eek every bit of performance out of that vertical stack.

698
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:09,000
And then you'll have more general systems that maybe don't really nail it so much

699
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,000
but they make a good server platform or something.

700
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:16,000
They have overall a good heat distribution, power use, and performance ratio.

701
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
It's a multi-CPU future, Mike.

702
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:22,000
That would actually be very interesting and incredibly complicated.

703
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
Yes. Yes, very much so.

704
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
And you wonder where it all lands.

705
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
And if maybe because if it gets more complicated

706
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:32,000
maybe it kind of ends up insuring some x86 longevity

707
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:36,000
just because it's a default going to work solution.

708
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
Yeah, who knows?

709
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:42,000
This will be one of those clips we play in a few years and we either blew it.

710
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,000
Or we were weirdly right.

711
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
Yeah, right. Exactly.

712
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:49,000
Well, we actually we got to get to the main story of the day, really.

713
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:53,000
I mean, that's really the topic that we should dig into.

714
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
So we'll take a moment.

715
00:37:55,000 --> 00:38:00,000
I'm going to thank a Cloud Guru for sponsoring this episode of the Coder Radio program.

716
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:03,000
And they have something kind of special I want you to check out.

717
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:06,000
They have a programming use cases course with Python.

718
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:09,000
The best way to learn and improve as a programmer

719
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:13,000
is really to practice your programming skills by solving problems.

720
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:17,000
So what a Cloud Guru has is a completely project-based course

721
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:20,000
that will walk you through various projects from start to finish

722
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:23,000
by breaking down the problems and solving them using Python.

723
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:27,000
And along the way, you'll learn intermediate to advanced Python topics.

724
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,000
And then you get to see how you apply those concepts

725
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:32,000
to the things you've already learned to solve different problems.

726
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:36,000
Learn some programming and solve some problems using Python.

727
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
We'll have a link in the show notes to check that out.

728
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:42,000
It's four hours of content, 31 total lessons, and five hands-on labs.

729
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:45,000
A Cloud Guru dot com or use the link in our show notes

730
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:48,000
to go directly to the programming use cases with Python course.

731
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:53,000
And thanks to a Cloud Guru for sponsoring the Coder Radio program.

732
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:58,000
So there's this tech story going on right now that proclaims

733
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:01,000
to hold the future of programming in its hands.

734
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:07,000
And you'll find all kinds of coverage on this story

735
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:12,000
from the sky is falling to there's a group out there

736
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:15,000
that says that you have to defend free trade

737
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:18,000
and Google must be punished for what they've done.

738
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:23,000
And of course, I'm referring to the now classic Oracle v. Google,

739
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:26,000
which has been going on since the start of this show

740
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:29,000
for a decade this thing's been going.

741
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:35,000
Essentially, Oracle is contending that 37 Java APIs used in Android

742
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,000
are subject to copyright.

743
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,000
I can't believe this crap is still going on.

744
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:42,000
This is the story that never dies.

745
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
And because we've had the break

746
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:47,000
and because this story has been going on for a decade,

747
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:50,000
Mike and I thought maybe we should sort of do a bit of reset

748
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,000
to bring you up to speed.

749
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,000
We're just going to tell you the stuff that matters.

750
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:56,000
And it probably starts with something we love to talk about.

751
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
And that's Sun Microsystems.

752
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:01,000
Thank God I got to get a handkerchief to cry into.

753
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:05,000
So I have this really, really adorable clip

754
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,000
from the heyday of Sun Microsystems.

755
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:11,000
Well, that's not really true, but it was the heyday of Java

756
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:17,000
about 1995, Sun Microsystems was 25 years old.

757
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,000
Somewhere around there.

758
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:22,000
I may have the math wrong,

759
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:26,000
but I think it was 25 years into Sun Microsystems' life.

760
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,000
It had already been around, yeah.

761
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,000
It had been around for a while.

762
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,000
That's the point I'm trying to make.

763
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,000
They were feeling good, right?

764
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:33,000
And it's funny, Mike, they had a slogan back then.

765
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,000
And this is the 90s, right?

766
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
And it was even before then that they came up with this.

767
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
And it was so on point.

768
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
The network is the computer.

769
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:48,000
The first 25 years at Sun have been just huge amounts

770
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,000
of innovation.

771
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,000
We popularized TCPIP.

772
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,000
We stunned the world with NFS.

773
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:56,000
We delivered Spark and Solaris and Java

774
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
and all of the other new technologies

775
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
that you've seen Sun deliver.

776
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
And we're on 6 billion devices.

777
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:05,000
Sun started with a very simple idea,

778
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:08,000
which is to take open standards on the software side

779
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:11,000
and combine them with open standards on the hardware side,

780
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:14,000
which at the time was apparently quite revolutionary,

781
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
and everybody liked it.

782
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:19,000
So this whole notion of open systems really started

783
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:22,000
with Sun Microsystems 25 years ago.

784
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:25,000
Early on in Sun's career, long before I got here,

785
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:28,000
was a fundamental idea that if you propagated a standard

786
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
across the world and literally shared it with the world,

787
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:33,000
you would create for yourself more opportunity for yourself

788
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,000
and for your customers and all the developers

789
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,000
who worked with both of you.

790
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:40,000
Our whole strategy of sharing open interfaces,

791
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
open source, even open sourcing the hardware

792
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:45,000
is going to create just an explosion of technology.

793
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,000
I think what really sets Sun apart is the idea

794
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:50,000
that we live so fully by the idea that you should share

795
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
your innovation with the world.

796
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
Sun was really the first company that defined open standards.

797
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
I think that's an interesting little bit right there

798
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
about how open they are and how they felt like

799
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:01,000
you should share your innovations with the world.

800
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:07,000
So I believe around their 25-year birthday,

801
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:11,000
they were about three years from being sold and going defunct

802
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,000
when this clip was recorded.

803
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,000
Somewhere in that range.

804
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:18,000
The chat room, Optimus Gray got the date for me.

805
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:23,000
Sun Microsystems was founded on February 24th, 1982.

806
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:26,000
And they recorded this, and then three years later,

807
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
they were gone.

808
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:32,000
And I think you could blame the fall of Sun Microsystems

809
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:37,000
on a bit of being a victim of the dot-com boom and bust.

810
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:42,000
Also, the x86 market combined with Linux

811
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:45,000
ate a lot of their special use case lunch.

812
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:48,000
And you heard them there.

813
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
They were famous for NFS.

814
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:53,000
And that's why they also were really well known for storage

815
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,000
and one of the reasons that they started

816
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,000
the ZFS file system project.

817
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:00,000
But they also started this little thing known as Java.

818
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:04,000
And this little thing known as Java had APIs,

819
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:08,000
which Google needed to re-implement in order to have Java compatibility

820
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:11,000
so that way they could reach a large user base quickly.

821
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:14,000
And in doing so, they directly re-implemented some of this,

822
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:17,000
which Oracle contends is 37 APIs.

823
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:22,000
Google contends that not only did they not need a license for this,

824
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:26,000
but that Sun was totally fine with them using it.

825
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,000
And Sun even knew about it potentially.

826
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:32,000
And that actually does seem to check out former Sun's CEO.

827
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
I have a link in the show notes.

828
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
I said, yeah, they don't need to pay for a license.

829
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:41,000
Jonathan Schwartz, which he was the CEO at the end of Sun Microsystems,

830
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:46,000
he was interviewed by CNET back in 2012.

831
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:51,000
And he said, as long as Google didn't use the name Java,

832
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:52,000
he was fine with it.

833
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
They didn't need a license for the APIs.

834
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:59,000
That's according to the CEO who was running Sun at the time Google adopted

835
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:00,000
and started using Java.

836
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
So I think that's pretty noteworthy.

837
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:06,000
But flash forward, Oracle buys Sun as times change.

838
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:13,000
And some emails also came out that seemed to indicate that Android Chief

839
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:18,000
Andy Rubin actually felt they did need to license the APIs

840
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
and that they were copywritten.

841
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:24,000
And he wrote a couple of ideas on how they could address the issue.

842
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
And then they never did.

843
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:30,000
But they appear to have identified it as a potential issue that these APIs

844
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
may be considered copywritten.

845
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:37,000
And they appear to have evaluated the risk and continued to proceed.

846
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:42,000
Oracle got its hands on those emails, which I have linked in the show notes,

847
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:48,000
and brought that to the court and has started this case that has gone back

848
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,000
and forth and back and forth.

849
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:54,000
And I have a quick clip from Bloomberg to bring us pretty close to present.

850
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:57,000
Both Google and Oracle have won, lost, appealed.

851
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,000
Where are we now?

852
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:04,000
Yeah, so we're on the third go-around now between appeals and trial.

853
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,000
As you said, the case was filed in 2010.

854
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:07,000
There was a trial.

855
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:08,000
There was an appeal.

856
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:09,000
There was another trial.

857
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:10,000
There was an appeal.

858
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:14,000
Now we've gotten to the point where it looks like Google may petition

859
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,000
the Supreme Court.

860
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:19,000
They were on the losing end of the last round of appeals in which,

861
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:24,000
as you said, the court ruled that their use of the Java APIs was not fair use

862
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:28,000
and that there was no defense to the infringement and that it needs to go

863
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:32,000
back to the trial court to decide what damages are owed Oracle, if any.

864
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:36,000
Well, and Google has made that appeal, and verbal arguments have been heard

865
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:39,000
by the Supreme Court after a delay due to COVID.

866
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:43,000
And the consensus from the journalists attending that verbal hearing,

867
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:46,000
or I'm sorry, that virtual hearing because it was done like in a Zoom-type call,

868
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:51,000
is that the Supreme Court seems to be seeing things Oracle's way.

869
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:56,000
And the fallout could be that a company could decide that another company

870
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,000
that's used their APIs is now violating copyright.

871
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:01,000
And you could see how this could spread throughout the industry

872
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:04,000
like a wildfire of lawsuits.

873
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:09,000
It sort of sets a precedence from the Supreme Court level that could be

874
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:13,000
retroactively very bad for the development community.

875
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:16,000
So I think that brings us up to current.

876
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:17,000
Yeah, this is a mess.

877
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:18,000
It's been going on for a decade.

878
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:22,000
Towards the end there, Sun was cursed with an ancient gypsy curse that they

879
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:25,000
couldn't make money while having one of the most popular programming languages

880
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:27,000
in the world.

881
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:28,000
Great.

882
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,000
There's a lot of history, Chris.

883
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:34,000
I don't know how far back into like the tit for tat because this lawsuit has

884
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,000
gone through a number of phases.

885
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:40,000
And for me, the thing that's always been the most striking and what always felt

886
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:48,000
like it was going to go Oracle's way, I think it was 2012 maybe.

887
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:52,000
They had a really damning testimony from Andy Rubin.

888
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,000
He was the head of Android at the time.

889
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:57,000
And he was getting grilled by Oracle's lawyer.

890
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:00,000
And he was reading through that email thread we've mentioned.

891
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:05,000
And in there, Andy Rubin says, we probably have to license this because our guys

892
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:06,000
have seen this.

893
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:09,000
There's no way we can do a clean room implementation.

894
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:13,000
And that in being an email that Oracle had, the lawyer seized on that part

895
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:17,000
about how they couldn't do a clean room implementation and was able to

896
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:21,000
essentially get Rubin to admit that meant that they had been too inspired by

897
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:22,000
the Java code.

898
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:25,000
And it kind of got them in this bad light.

899
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:30,000
And since that, I really feel like since that testimony in 2012, it has been

900
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,000
lose after lose for Google.

901
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:35,000
And the tech press has just done a really poor job of understanding what's going

902
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:38,000
on here because they're just so inherently pro Google.

903
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:39,000
Yeah.

904
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:41,000
And this is a big case of emails.

905
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:44,000
I mean, there was a couple of cases where the Sun attorneys were able to

906
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:47,000
examine the source code or I'm assuming engineers who work for the attorneys

907
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:52,000
and find cases where they had literally copied Sun's code, leaving the comment

908
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:55,000
lines, you know, like the comment headers in the files.

909
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:56,000
Yeah.

910
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:59,000
Which was not very smart.

911
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:02,000
So what do you make of all this doom and gloom that like if Sun wins, this is

912
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:05,000
going to be, you know, there was that op-ed in the Wall Street Journal by the

913
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:09,000
general counsel from Microsoft with Google's general counsel, apologies for

914
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:13,000
not knowing their names, where basically Microsoft is taking Google's side,

915
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:17,000
you know, painting the sky is falling argument here.

916
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,000
I do think it would be a bad thing.

917
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:25,000
I think it could open us up to a new generation of patent style lawsuits that

918
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:28,000
only instead of being patent law would be copyright law.

919
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:34,000
However, zooming out and going to a higher level, it could also force a

920
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:39,000
further shift to free software and open source where this problem is solved.

921
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:44,000
It's implicit in the license agreement upfront, you know, and there's no gray

922
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:45,000
area.

923
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:48,000
There's no possibility you're going to get screwed by big mega corporation

924
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:49,000
that wants a piece.

925
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:54,000
It is clear and free to navigate and it could draw more people to using more

926
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,000
free software and open source development.

927
00:48:56,000 --> 00:49:01,000
And I don't know, maybe you would actually be in not in their best interest

928
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:02,000
in the long term.

929
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:03,000
But I could be wrong.

930
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:07,000
See, it's funny because our experience with patent rules over the years has

931
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:10,000
made me think that in fact, that is exactly what will happen.

932
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:11,000
Right.

933
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:13,000
Somebody is going to run around and say, oh, well, you know, we invented

934
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:16,000
this method for blah, blah, blah.

935
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:21,000
I wonder if it's the actual copying of the code that gets them hit because

936
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:25,000
you could see a way where maybe they rule narrowly and throw out a lot of

937
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:26,000
Oracle's claims.

938
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,000
This is where like lawyers can go back and forth on this all day long.

939
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:31,000
This wouldn't be too surprising of an outcome, though, would it be a pretty

940
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:34,000
down the middle outcome that gets Oracle the win they want?

941
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:38,000
They get some money but doesn't set precedents for the rest of the industry.

942
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,000
Some sort of narrow ruling could happen here.

943
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:44,000
And that would probably be at this point the most ideal outcome, because I

944
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:47,000
don't think you're going to have Google walk away winning this.

945
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:48,000
It doesn't seem like it, at least.

946
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:52,000
I guess oral arguments don't necessarily indicate the final judgment of the

947
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:53,000
Supreme Court.

948
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,000
It just doesn't look super good.

949
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:58,000
I mean, I'm sure they're kicking themselves in the butt now because it would

950
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:04,000
have been much easier to make a deal with Sun than to make a deal with Oracle.

951
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:07,000
I mean, Google was doing good at that point.

952
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:09,000
They had plenty of money.

953
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:10,000
Plenty of money.

954
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:11,000
Maybe they should have bought Sun.

955
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:12,000
Wow.

956
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:13,000
That would have been, yeah.

957
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:14,000
Yeah.

958
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:15,000
Here's a hot take on it, though.

959
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:22,000
I think this is yet another devastating blow to computer users in the tech

960
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:25,000
industry that is being delivered to us by Google.

961
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:29,000
They dumped Android on us, and they used Java to make it popular.

962
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:33,000
They undercut developers out there.

963
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,000
They've done one thing after the other.

964
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:39,000
I mean, I could also sit here, and I could rile on consumer privacy and all

965
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:40,000
the data collection they do.

966
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:43,000
I could talk about the advertising market and what they've done to the

967
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:44,000
browser market.

968
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:49,000
I could talk about how they had a great thing going with carriers, but they

969
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:53,000
capitulated to companies like Verizon and Sprint and let them ship their

970
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:56,000
crapware so that way they could compete with Apple.

971
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:59,000
I mean, there's so many areas where you look back in modern computing

972
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:05,000
history, and Google has screwed the little guy for their own gain.

973
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:09,000
I guess I'm just not really feeling very sorry for Google right now.

974
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:13,000
I don't want them to lose this because I think the overall net impact on the

975
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:18,000
industry is bad, but they should be held accountable for putting us in this

976
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:22,000
position because they're going to screw all of us again.

977
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:24,000
They never get held accountable for this.

978
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:29,000
When you read ours or pretty much any of the tech coverage, they're

979
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:32,000
essentially trying to put all of this on the fault of Google's counsel.

980
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:35,000
Oh, Google's counsel didn't argue very well.

981
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:38,000
It's Google's counsel's fault for not representing the situation properly.

982
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:41,000
That is such horse manure.

983
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:43,000
It is such horse manure.

984
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:47,000
It is the tech industry trying to backwards figure out how they're going to

985
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:51,000
problem solve for the company they've been advocating the entire time when

986
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:55,000
they don't have a solid case, and they actually did possibly make a wrong

987
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:56,000
choice.

988
00:51:56,000 --> 00:52:00,000
They made a mistake, and it's going to possibly screw all of us.

989
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:03,000
You just see them backfilling it by blaming it on the counsel, and we'll

990
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:04,000
just move on.

991
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,000
It'll be Oracle's the bad guy.

992
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,000
Oracle's the big evil company.

993
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,000
Larry Ellison, he's so bad.

994
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:13,000
That'll be the coverage, and there will be no accountability for once

995
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:16,000
again Google screwing us.

996
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,000
You have to go back to the time though, right?

997
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:22,000
What Google was afraid of was losing their, don't say monopoly because they

998
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:27,000
don't like that, but their stranglehold on search because of iPhone, right?

999
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:30,000
Remember, that was the problem they were solving.

1000
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:34,000
They weren't really trying to make a great OS.

1001
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:38,000
They were trying to get an OS that's popular enough that they would retain

1002
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:39,000
their search dominance.

1003
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:43,000
Which is why they made those undercutting deals with the carriers that let

1004
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:45,000
them shovel their crapware on Android phones.

1005
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:49,000
Why they gave billions to Apple to put Google as the default search in mobile

1006
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:50,000
Safari, right?

1007
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:55,000
But there is like a kind of comedy of errors aspect to this, and I know people

1008
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:59,000
hate it when I bring this up, but it's just so damn funny.

1009
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:04,000
One of the things that was revealed in one of these many trials was that in a

1010
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:08,000
set of emails, they knew that they had an easy way out.

1011
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,000
They're good friends at Microsoft.

1012
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:16,000
They could have easily just used Hot Net and C sharp and not had to pay a damn

1013
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:17,000
thing to anybody.

1014
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:20,000
Back then, they desperately, deeply hated Microsoft.

1015
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:21,000
They hated, right.

1016
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:25,000
It was just like actual, if you look at it, like actual animosity that stopped

1017
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:26,000
them.

1018
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:27,000
Yes.

1019
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:29,000
And they kind of figured Sun were a bunch of wimps, right?

1020
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:30,000
I'm sorry.

1021
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:33,000
And back then, you know, they thought this was the way to go.

1022
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:37,000
There's all these developers who intimately are familiar with Java and we

1023
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:38,000
could have a winner.

1024
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:41,000
They didn't make that decision from a performance and battery life

1025
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:42,000
standpoint.

1026
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:45,000
And remember, it was these slow old mobile arm CPUs back then.

1027
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:46,000
So it was so much worse.

1028
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:49,000
I think particularly young people don't know how bad those first Android

1029
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:54,000
devices were and how unoptimized the whole Android stack was.

1030
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:59,000
They have done so many major improvements over the years to speed up

1031
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:02,000
launching and real time building of these apps that it's it's a non-issue

1032
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:03,000
now.

1033
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:06,000
But back then it was painful.

1034
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:12,000
You have Android devices that require double the memory and they'd have a

1035
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:13,000
worse battery life.

1036
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:14,000
Jiggity scrolling.

1037
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:15,000
Yeah.

1038
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:18,000
Oh, I mean, it's still not great, but it was so bad back then.

1039
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:22,000
And so it was clearly a move to just dominate the market at every level.

1040
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:26,000
And it was just to me, it seems like they decided it's a risk calculus

1041
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,000
we're willing to make.

1042
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:29,000
Let's proceed.

1043
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:31,000
Damn the consequences.

1044
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:36,000
They were fundamentally right in that the reason they just kind of rolled

1045
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:42,000
Sun was because, again, I loved Sun, but like everybody was Steve Wozniak

1046
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:43,000
at Sun.

1047
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:45,000
But you needed like a jerk.

1048
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:48,000
You needed someone who's like, I don't care about open source.

1049
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:49,000
I don't care about the community.

1050
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:51,000
Go to hell and pay us.

1051
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:54,000
Yeah, because Sun very promptly.

1052
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,000
Sun made nothing on this.

1053
00:54:56,000 --> 00:55:00,000
A lot of the history of Java is the history of Sun building this great

1054
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:03,000
thing that millions of developers ended up using.

1055
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:05,000
And they didn't get a goddamn thing.

1056
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:08,000
You got to remember, though, they did make a lot of money in large

1057
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:09,000
business with some of their...

1058
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:11,000
On Solaris, yeah.

1059
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:14,000
Solaris and even in the printing industry, like they did have some

1060
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:17,000
fundamentals, but time changed.

1061
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:20,000
I think when the idea of Java came along, they had another cash cow.

1062
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:25,000
They were making good money and they saw this as part of an overall

1063
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:26,000
strategy.

1064
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,000
They never really got to the point where they could just completely

1065
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,000
monetize off of Java directly.

1066
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:33,000
And by the time they started trying to make efforts to do that, it was

1067
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:34,000
just too late.

1068
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:35,000
Right.

1069
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:36,000
Well, they had the Spark stations.

1070
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:37,000
Right.

1071
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:38,000
That was one of their...

1072
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:39,000
Towards the end, that was like...

1073
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:40,000
Remember Next was their competitor?

1074
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:41,000
Yeah.

1075
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:42,000
Remember Next?

1076
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:43,000
Another good win there.

1077
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:45,000
Well, I actually think it was Jobs who coined the term, the computer is

1078
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:49,000
the network, and then Sun adopted it and it perturbed Jobs quite a bit.

1079
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:50,000
Yeah, but Spark...

1080
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,000
I mean, Spark stations at the time were very good.

1081
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:54,000
They were also ridiculously expensive.

1082
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:57,000
Yeah, the bank I worked for had a few of them to run all the check

1083
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:58,000
printing and the statement printing.

1084
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,000
But it's neither here nor there.

1085
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:03,000
I mean, we can both be sad for Sun because a world...

1086
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:06,000
I just want to say a world where Sun was one of the big tech players

1087
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:10,000
today would be just like a fundamentally different world.

1088
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:14,000
I think there's a really fundamental business lesson in this.

1089
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:17,000
See, one of the things that you touch on and other people don't really

1090
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:21,000
mention this and I think it's an astute analysis on your part is Google

1091
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:24,000
did a risk calculation when it was Sun Microsystems.

1092
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:27,000
And you can see from statements from the CEO and you hear it from that

1093
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:31,000
clip that I played, I think Google was right to assume they could

1094
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:34,000
probably just proceed to use all that stuff and it was going to be okay.

1095
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:37,000
That was the spirit of Sun Microsystems back then.

1096
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:42,000
But the business mistake was not considering that things change,

1097
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:45,000
businesses sell, and new owners come rolling in.

1098
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:49,000
You've got to protect yourself from all kinds of eventualities.

1099
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:53,000
And if you're going to base a new mobile platform that will be a

1100
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:58,000
keystone aspect of your business, you need to cross the old T's and dot

1101
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:02,000
the old I's and get something on paper that says you're good to use this.

1102
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:06,000
Because while I think you can just infer from just the clip I played,

1103
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,000
Sun was cool with it.

1104
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:10,000
When Oracle came along, that's a different business.

1105
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:14,000
They see use of their property as they see it differently.

1106
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:19,000
And Google screwed up in not just getting that license on paper,

1107
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:23,000
even if it was something from Sun that said, you know, one paragraph,

1108
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:27,000
use it as you will like, God bless Sun Microsystems.

1109
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:29,000
That would have prevented all of this.

1110
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:32,000
And the fundamental business mistake is right in there.

1111
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,000
And I think all of us should take that as a lesson.

1112
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:37,000
The business you deal with today may not be the business you're dealing

1113
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:41,000
with tomorrow, especially in the tech industry, and they didn't protect

1114
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:46,000
themselves from what seems like, in hindsight at least, an obvious eventuality.

1115
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:50,000
One thing I don't know, has it ever come out, when Sun was on the ropes,

1116
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:54,000
was there not anybody at Google, like have there been any emails released

1117
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:58,000
to this effect that was saying, hey, we have this giant liability bomb.

1118
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:01,000
And, you know, because they did still hate Microsoft because, right,

1119
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:04,000
there was rumors that Microsoft was going to buy Sun.

1120
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:09,000
Like, maybe we need to go help out Uncle Scott McNeely, right?

1121
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:11,000
I don't know, man. I haven't seen anything.

1122
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:12,000
I haven't seen anything either.

1123
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:16,000
It's such a weird oversight to say, maybe we can't let them fall, right?

1124
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:19,000
You're thinking about it from a Google now that's bought Motorola.

1125
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:20,000
You know, they bought Nest.

1126
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:23,000
They've done all these weird purchases and investments,

1127
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:26,000
so it seems totally reasonable that Google would make a purchase like that.

1128
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:29,000
Yeah, because I think today they would just buy it away.

1129
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:31,000
Yeah, that's how they would solve this.

1130
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:35,000
But Google back then was, they were pure.

1131
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:38,000
Remember like the big thing about Google used to be that if they bought a company,

1132
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:42,000
they would rebase the company's entire infrastructure on their own systems.

1133
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:43,000
Which was insane.

1134
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:47,000
Those kinds of things just started going away a little bit.

1135
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:49,000
And they started lowering their standards,

1136
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:52,000
and they started buying and then selling companies for a loss.

1137
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:55,000
And now it seems like in that hindsight, yeah, they should have just done that.

1138
00:58:55,000 --> 00:59:00,000
It probably would cost them about what they're going to end up paying Oracle in fees.

1139
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,000
And God only knows once you add the lawyer costs.

1140
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,000
I mean, they've been fighting this for a decade.

1141
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,000
What kind of expense must that be?

1142
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:09,000
And just a drain on company resources and time and energy.

1143
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:13,000
You know, it's just a case for the only one I really feel bad for is son.

1144
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:15,000
I'm sorry.

1145
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:17,000
Yeah, absolutely, because there's no really good guys in this.

1146
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:18,000
Right.

1147
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,000
And I get Google was a little more scrappy at the time,

1148
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:22,000
so it's kind of like, you know, whatever.

1149
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:24,000
You take risks when you're small.

1150
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:27,000
But remember, Chris, don't be evil.

1151
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:28,000
Yeah.

1152
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:31,000
I mean, I know, you know, I've been talking about this forever,

1153
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:34,000
but it feels like something significant is about to happen

1154
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:36,000
now that it's at the Supreme Court.

1155
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:40,000
2020 may be the wildest year yet when it comes to, you know,

1156
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:42,000
like every category has something going on in life.

1157
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:46,000
I got to tell you, if the doom and gloom projections are even half correct

1158
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:50,000
about what this could be, it is going to be a rough time to be in ISV.

1159
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:51,000
Yeah.

1160
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:56,000
Probably regardless, this entire case is going to be something that people study.

1161
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:57,000
Yeah.

1162
00:59:57,000 --> 01:00:00,000
This is going to be something that's taught to future students.

1163
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:05,000
And if it really does have even half the outcome that the doomsdayers are saying,

1164
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:09,000
people will be trying to educate themselves on what happened.

1165
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:13,000
And it'll be a moment in our life where it'll feel like everything changed,

1166
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:15,000
but it took a decade to get there.

1167
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:18,000
And you see it slowly building again right now with the tech companies

1168
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:20,000
and the talk about antitrust.

1169
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:25,000
And I think it's interesting that IBM just announced their quote unquote breaking up,

1170
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:27,000
which is very much monopoly terms,

1171
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:30,000
which of course they were not really at a risk of when it comes to cloud.

1172
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:34,000
But it's just interesting that I think we're about to see the results

1173
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:36,000
of something that's been a decade in the works,

1174
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:39,000
while something that's also going to affect the tech industry over a decade

1175
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:41,000
is beginning to spin up right now.

1176
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:43,000
But don't you think it's kind of their fault?

1177
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:44,000
I mean, all of them.

1178
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:46,000
They got a little too fat and a little too happy.

1179
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:47,000
Yeah.

1180
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:48,000
And it's time for a hangover.

1181
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:49,000
Yeah.

1182
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:52,000
I mean, the size of the tech industry is bizarre.

1183
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:55,000
I can't even comprehend how large Apple is.

1184
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:56,000
No.

1185
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:57,000
No, you really actually can't.

1186
01:00:57,000 --> 01:01:02,000
I mean, I think the only way I can kind of begin to wrap my head around how rich Apple is

1187
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:04,000
is when I compare them to the wealth of nations.

1188
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:05,000
Right.

1189
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:08,000
They won't be the last company that's this size.

1190
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:11,000
That will have significant ramifications.

1191
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:12,000
We'll see.

1192
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:14,000
Well, I want to thank the members.

1193
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:16,000
We had our first quarterly report go out,

1194
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:20,000
and a few folks went and signed up at coderqa.co to get access to that

1195
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:23,000
and to get access to the limited ad feed.

1196
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:26,000
It's a quarterly report that we put out.

1197
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:29,000
And when you become a member, you support the show, you get access to that report

1198
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:32,000
and to the limited ad feed at coderqa.co.

1199
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:34,000
Thanks to everybody who supports us over there.

1200
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:39,000
Mr. Dominic, is there any links you want to inform the people about this week or plug?

1201
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:40,000
Actually, you know what?

1202
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:42,000
I just had our friend Wimpy on the Mike Dominic show,

1203
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:43,000
so I think you'll all like that.

1204
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:44,000
Check that out.

1205
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:45,000
Oh, very good.

1206
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:46,000
Very good.

1207
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:47,000
Is it out?

1208
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:48,000
It's out.

1209
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:49,000
Yeah, it's out.

1210
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:51,000
We should toss a link in the show notes so people can get it real easy.

1211
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:53,000
They can just go listen to that after this.

1212
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:54,000
Sure.

1213
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:55,000
All right.

1214
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:57,000
Well, the show is at Coder Radio Show, I think, or is it Coder Show?

1215
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:58,000
Dang it.

1216
01:01:58,000 --> 01:01:59,000
Why don't I know this?

1217
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:00,000
Coder.show.

1218
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:01,000
No, no.

1219
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:02,000
I'm talking about the Twitter handle.

1220
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:03,000
This is how you know I'm just not a Twitter guy anymore.

1221
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:05,000
It's Coder Radio Show, and somebody else has it at Coder Radio,

1222
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:10,000
and they do not like it when I keep forgetting.

1223
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:11,000
That's great.

1224
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:15,000
You know, we ought to just have a campaign of accidentally aggravating them

1225
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:16,000
until they just hand over the account.

1226
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:17,000
Wow.

1227
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:18,000
Yeah.

1228
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:21,000
So the site URL is – no, I kid – is coder.show,

1229
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:26,000
and you can get links to what we talked about today at coder.show slash 383.

1230
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:27,000
And I think that's just about everything.

1231
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:28,000
I'd love to have you join us live.

1232
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:29,000
Maybe I'll mention that.

1233
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:32,000
We do this show Mondays, noon Pacific, 3 p.m. Eastern.

1234
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:36,000
We've got a chat room that goes along with us, and we love having you there.

1235
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:39,000
Thanks so much for joining us on this week's episode of the Coder Radio program,

1236
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:49,000
and we'll see you back here next week.
