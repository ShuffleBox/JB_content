00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,280
This is KOTORadio, episode 477 for August 1st, 2022.

2
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:19,760
Hey, good buddy, welcome back to Jupiter Broadcasting's weekly talk show, taking a pragmatic look

3
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:25,040
at the art and the business of software development and the world of technology.

4
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:30,160
My name is Chris, and joining us every single week with his laser pointer, it's our host,

5
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:31,160
Mr. Dominic.

6
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:32,160
Hello, Mike.

7
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:37,400
Salutations, hear ye, hear ye, from ye olde Renfer edition of KOTORadio.

8
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:44,000
I'm going to admit something to you, didn't actually know it was August until that exact

9
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,480
moment when I read the date.

10
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:49,020
I looked down at the date, and I just realized it was August.

11
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:52,200
As always, folks, we're at our normal peak performance.

12
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:55,120
Programs are operational, but barely just so.

13
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:57,160
Oh, man, it's just every day, right?

14
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:58,280
It's just, what does it matter?

15
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:00,840
Every day's a workday, so it doesn't really matter, I suppose.

16
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:02,840
Seven days a week, all air day, all day.

17
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:04,680
I got something kind of special for you.

18
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:08,720
So we've been doing the video stream of the shows now over at Jupiter.Tube, and we've

19
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:14,200
been kind of coming up with music to kick the shows off with as the stream opens up.

20
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:19,060
DeckBot wrote in a suggestion, and it was a good suggestion, but I wanted to take it

21
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:20,060
a bit further.

22
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:21,480
I wanted to make it even better.

23
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:24,360
I wanted to make it something special to the show.

24
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:29,600
So I'm going to play a hit, and I want you to tell me if you can identify when and where

25
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:30,760
this hit comes from.

26
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:32,280
I grabbed this for you.

27
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:35,720
That's your one and only hint, is I went out and I got this for you based on DeckBot's

28
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:36,720
email.

29
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:59,240
All right, ring any bells?

30
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:00,240
It weirdly does.

31
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:01,240
It's for me.

32
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:02,240
It's for you.

33
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:05,920
How does it make you feel when you hear it?

34
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:06,920
I kind of like it.

35
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:07,920
I'm kind of into it.

36
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:08,920
Yeah?

37
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:11,840
It reminds you of better times?

38
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:12,840
Is it the 90s?

39
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:13,840
Is it?

40
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:14,840
Hmm.

41
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:17,000
I feel like I'm walking into a trap.

42
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,560
My Admiral Ackbar sensors are blaring right now.

43
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:21,560
I don't know.

44
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:22,560
What is it?

45
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:25,640
It is the opening video to Snow Leopard after a fresh install.

46
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:26,640
Damn it.

47
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:27,640
I knew it.

48
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:28,640
Oh, I knew it was something.

49
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:31,280
I was like, I sound so familiar and I feel so happy.

50
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:34,360
I just thought maybe it was like a Jar Jar thing, like there was some Jar Jar skit I

51
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:36,160
didn't know about.

52
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,160
Yeah, that's the back.

53
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:38,560
That's the little music they'd play.

54
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:41,200
You know, when that video come up in all the different languages and they'd welcome you

55
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,200
to the desktop.

56
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:43,200
That's right.

57
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,200
It's terrible now.

58
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:48,120
I just had to pay them back today, but yeah, yeah, no, today they don't care.

59
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:49,120
Now they're like, yeah, whatever.

60
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:50,120
They don't care about it.

61
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:51,120
You don't need a fancy video.

62
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,120
Screw you.

63
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:53,120
But back then, you know, that was a big deal.

64
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:57,740
In fact, you could even, a machine could even play video was a big deal back then.

65
00:02:57,740 --> 00:02:58,740
What does your machine have?

66
00:02:58,740 --> 00:02:59,740
Video.

67
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:00,740
What?

68
00:03:00,740 --> 00:03:02,920
Yeah, I can do it.

69
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:05,040
All right, Jacob wrote into the show.

70
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:09,500
In a recent episode, you guys were talking about WSL, I work for a very large retailer

71
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:14,880
with a large IT department and a mature set of practices, especially about what machines

72
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:16,640
and operating systems they use.

73
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:18,840
Linux machines are not on the list.

74
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:21,220
Macs and PCs.

75
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:22,220
That's it.

76
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:25,520
For the Mac based people, having access to a good terminal is no problem.

77
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:28,140
I've introduced them to warp, thanks Mike.

78
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:32,400
For the PC folks, well, things are a bit more challenging.

79
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:36,300
We've had a scenario where two of our engineers were unable to run the scripts they needed

80
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:40,160
to because they didn't have some of the tools native to Linux or Mac.

81
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:46,800
So they installed WSL and after a quick restart and a quick app to get, they were up and running.

82
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:49,180
This was super efficient.

83
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:54,960
We didn't have to request a Linux box from IT and get to wait for the ticket to be solved.

84
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:59,400
We didn't have to wait for a Linux VM to get spun up for us.

85
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:04,160
WSL's technique of enabling a Linux within our enterprise solution that just fits allowed

86
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:10,460
us to quickly meet our needs without triggering any of the security configs on the machine.

87
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:18,000
From my experience, WSL has the space and makes our workflow a lot more efficient.

88
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:23,120
The whole IT angle, right, of needing to provision a machine or even provision a VM.

89
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,640
And with WSL, you could just check a box.

90
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:28,120
Now you've got to have certain privileges to get that installed, but assuming you have

91
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:35,140
those, yeah, that's the secret success right there is that WSL will end up having more

92
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:41,160
dark matter developers using it than all of the Linux desktop users combined.

93
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:43,160
Just that one category of user.

94
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:46,560
And the question is, and this is the flamework question, are they Linux users?

95
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,480
I'm going to go ahead and say kind of.

96
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:55,820
I mean, I kind of feel like you have to say yes if you agree that by using the Linux kernel

97
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:59,920
to do this, which they are with WSL, then they're Linux users.

98
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:04,080
But then that also means Android users are Linux users by that same definition.

99
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:07,880
Do you agree that all Android users are Linux users?

100
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:08,880
No.

101
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,400
I mean, so it's funny, right?

102
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:15,520
Because the WSL guys are literally going to be pulling from either, you know, Debian packages

103
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:19,560
or if they're using, what was it, the one I use, Penguin, right?

104
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:24,360
Which is, I think, although they have flavors now, they have a fedora flavor, but it's Debian

105
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:25,360
based.

106
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:30,240
And their day-to-day workflow right in Windows terminal, which is effectively going to be

107
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:37,160
a bass or Z shell, is a lot closer to a desktop Linux users than a desktop Windows user.

108
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:40,880
If they're doing like web dev and I can feel the hatred flowing, I just got like a wave

109
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:43,080
of anger in the universe at me.

110
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:50,440
So you think it's like part technology stack, but also part of what you're doing?

111
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:52,200
Like are you using the system?

112
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:53,200
Yeah.

113
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:57,080
See, this one, I don't even know how valuable of a question this is, right?

114
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:58,080
Yeah, yeah.

115
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:02,920
But this becomes a weird question because of somebody who, let's take our good friend

116
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:04,160
Alan Jude, right?

117
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:09,000
If somebody who, not to pick on Alan, but you know, lives in a Windows 7 machine, but

118
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:13,960
basically works on Unix C servers all day, every day in terminal, or even someone like

119
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:19,240
me who, okay, spends a lot of time working on a Mac machine, but uses the Mac machine

120
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:24,680
to SSH into Linux boxes almost all day and write code for Linux machines.

121
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:27,200
And you know, is that not like working in Linux?

122
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,200
I don't know.

123
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:29,200
Right.

124
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:30,840
And Alan is producing code for FreeBSD.

125
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:31,840
For FreeBSD.

126
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:32,840
Yep.

127
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:33,840
Yep.

128
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:34,840
Because the devil.

129
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:35,840
Yes.

130
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:36,840
But I don't know.

131
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:39,960
I mean, maybe you would say they're not like gooey Linux users, but you know, we've been

132
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:41,600
talking about this a long time.

133
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,880
The value of Linux is really the kernel.

134
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:44,880
Yeah.

135
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,980
I'd say it's the platform to run things on.

136
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:51,040
Like it's a general compute platform, and you can move that to your Windows platform,

137
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:52,040
I suppose.

138
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:53,040
All right.

139
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:55,440
Well, let's switch over to the other side.

140
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:58,720
Travis writes in, and this is an interesting one.

141
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,000
Hey guys, question.

142
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:06,760
I want to do an Apple research project, which is an expansion of a current small scale official

143
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:12,120
IRB certified research on the secondary traumatic stress disorder for healthcare workers.

144
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:15,500
So it's sort of like PTSD, but for healthcare workers.

145
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:20,240
And Travis wants to do a study using the Apple research kit, which uses a bunch of metrics

146
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:24,920
from the watch to monitor things like heart rate and blood oxygen level and steps and

147
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:26,640
all of that kind of stuff.

148
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:28,120
Travis already has this ongoing.

149
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:32,840
He says, when I go to the Apple website and I dig around with the email correspondence

150
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:36,760
I have so far, it seems like they want me to bring my own app dev team to the table

151
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:39,160
to create this project.

152
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:44,240
Currently I'm heading up one of the larger studies on STSD that I know of at least, involving

153
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:48,280
three different departments of one level, one trauma center in Virginia.

154
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:51,880
I am to use this study to get funding for and head up a larger study using the Apple

155
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:57,800
research kit to make this the largest study on STSD in the world to date.

156
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:02,160
My angle is that with Apple research, I can incorporate not only survey results, but data

157
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:05,600
from iPhones and metrics from Apple watches to create what I believe could be a pivotal

158
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:09,880
study that includes heart rate, O2 steps, and other measurable data from phones and

159
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:12,680
watches to give a complete picture.

160
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:18,040
Now, I am an emergency nurse by trade and I know very little about coding or who I should

161
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:23,960
talk to, but I know that this is a huge unspoken issue in the healthcare system.

162
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:28,520
I'm looking for ideas from you guys in the know on who can code such an idea into reality.

163
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:34,700
If my grant funding is enough, I think I could hire alice.dev to do this project.

164
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:36,400
Or maybe I could do the research project myself.

165
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:37,400
I have so many questions.

166
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:39,040
I'd love to know your initial thoughts.

167
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:40,040
Thanks for your time on the matter.

168
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:47,720
P.S. long time listener since last, and I just think sincerely, Travis, what a fascinating

169
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:48,720
idea.

170
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:52,880
And for those of you curious, I put a link to some of the research kit information in

171
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:57,160
the show notes, including the open source research kit project that Apple released a

172
00:08:57,160 --> 00:09:01,840
while ago, which is a framework introduced by Apple to let researchers and developers

173
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:04,260
create apps for medical research.

174
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:07,280
And it's called surprisingly research kit.

175
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:08,960
What do you think, Mr. Dominic?

176
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:11,560
I mean, that's a that's a that's a juicy email, right?

177
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:16,080
Well, you know, I haven't looked at research kit quite a lot, but it's very interesting

178
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:19,040
how Apple has been able to kind of leverage.

179
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:24,280
There are just let's be honest, gargantuan smog, the dragon like horde of medical data

180
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:28,040
to empower, frankly, researchers.

181
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:32,280
I would say, man, if you can start this on your own and kind of bootstrap it, that's

182
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:34,000
the way to go.

183
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,840
See where you get it.

184
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:41,080
Really having looked at the frameworks before the show today, I can say this is kind of

185
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:46,320
I know we like to beat up on Apple sometimes, but given these kind of, you know, libraries

186
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:49,320
and frameworks away is a huge deal.

187
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:51,560
And, you know, go for it.

188
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:53,520
You probably know a lot more about this than I do.

189
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:55,040
So I completely agree.

190
00:09:55,040 --> 00:10:00,360
And Apple is always adding more sensors to that watch.

191
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:01,360
You know what I mean?

192
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:02,860
Like, it's just going to get better.

193
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:05,520
This is just going to get more powerful.

194
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:11,760
And so far, it seems like the privacy works like the way they've built this.

195
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,580
It seems like everybody's OK with it.

196
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:15,280
There hasn't been a catastrophe yet.

197
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:17,360
But Travis, it's a great idea.

198
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:21,540
And one of the things that I thought was interesting about your email, Travis, is I hadn't really

199
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:26,320
thought about this, but of course, to somebody that's completely outside this field, you

200
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:29,000
would almost think that Apple supplies the developers, right?

201
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:34,560
Because it's their watch, their research kit, and they are the richest company in the world.

202
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:39,200
Like, you would almost kind of just assume that Apple has developers ready to go, that

203
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:43,480
you contact Apple, and then they assign a handful of developers to your project.

204
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:45,520
But that's, nope, nope.

205
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:46,960
You do all the work.

206
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:50,400
You do all the things to make the watch super valuable.

207
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:52,640
And then Apple takes 30%.

208
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:54,640
That's how that works, Travis.

209
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:55,640
Yeah.

210
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:59,440
In this case, I think you can defend that a little better.

211
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:05,080
Because just the idea, for instance, that I can monitor my heart rate, am I going AFib

212
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:11,400
or anything like that, on my wrist for, what did this watch cost me, like $400 to $500?

213
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:13,160
That's pretty significant, right?

214
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:15,400
Just the amount of engineering that had to go into this.

215
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:20,040
And the fact that it doesn't look like a potato helps, means I'll actually wear it.

216
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:22,480
It also means a lot of people are getting a free Apple Watch, because a big part of

217
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:27,720
these studies, because of course, you can't just limit it to Apple customers, a big part

218
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:32,360
of these studies is giving out the base watch, but I mean, it's free Apple Watch for a lot

219
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:33,360
of people.

220
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,360
Yay.

221
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,360
Apple Watch party.

222
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:36,360
Yeah.

223
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:37,360
Get your free Apple Watch.

224
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:38,360
We're just going to monitor everything.

225
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:39,360
All right.

226
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:40,360
Matthew's got our last email of the day.

227
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:43,480
Now, we did get a couple more emails that will be in the next episode, don't worry.

228
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:47,280
And please do keep sending in your questions, coder.show slash contact.

229
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:51,740
I would like to build up a bit of a backlog, just so that we have a pool to pull from.

230
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:53,720
So Matthew's got our last one of the day here.

231
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:59,880
He says, hey y'all, I've been looking at GitOps and other newer DevOps techniques and tooling.

232
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:05,700
Curious what your thoughts are and approaches are on DevOps and or GitOps specifically.

233
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:09,640
It's not as exciting as other aspects of development, but I feel it impacts developer happiness

234
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:12,040
and productivity quite a lot.

235
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:13,440
Thanks.

236
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:17,960
And for those of you who don't know, GitOps is essentially a framework that takes DevOps

237
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:23,640
best practices, which could be used for application development, such as version control, collaboration,

238
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:28,760
compliance, tooling, all of that, and applies it to infrastructure automation.

239
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:33,000
So taking some of the best of development practices and applying it to infrastructure

240
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
management.

241
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Now, I know you have a moderate, a modest infrastructure at the Mad Botter, but I'm

242
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,720
sure you probably thought a little bit about deploying things and keeping things manageable.

243
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:45,020
What are your thoughts in this area?

244
00:12:45,020 --> 00:12:49,760
It's an active conversation, because as things have changed, the self-hosting model is starting

245
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,840
to make less sense for us.

246
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:53,080
Oh, tell me more.

247
00:12:53,080 --> 00:13:00,680
Well, it's coming down to a former sponsor keeps raising their hosting prices on me.

248
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:03,880
And a certain Microsoft-owned platform called GitHub, I don't know if you've ever heard

249
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:08,560
of them, they're a little indie rail shop, keeps lowering their prices.

250
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:12,800
It just so happens that many of the tools and places we want to deploy to have these

251
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:18,120
really neat like pre-configured GitHub actions that you could just bam, now we can deploy

252
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:23,440
for the technologies that we primarily use, which would be Python and to a lesser degree

253
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:25,120
Rails.

254
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:32,360
So that is becoming more attractive because I did the math, actually last week, we would

255
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:37,800
cut our hosting bill in half because of just the implied backups that GitHub themselves

256
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:41,400
do that we're now manually doing all the time, right?

257
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:42,400
Interesting.

258
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:43,400
Yeah.

259
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:48,960
So the question becomes, okay, our GitLab pipelines, what does moving them to GitHub

260
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:50,960
look like?

261
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:56,520
And for the things we care about that we currently do continuous deployment, continuous integration

262
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:59,560
on, is that level of effort worth it?

263
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:02,800
And I'm pretty sure the answer is just yes.

264
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:06,480
So you know what?

265
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:08,320
The logic here is we're small.

266
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:12,200
The more we spend on hosting, the kind of the worse off we are.

267
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:17,960
And also it's a big responsibility to host your own GitLab server.

268
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:20,760
It's not hard, but over time, you know, there's more updates.

269
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:25,520
There's just more stuff to do when GitHub is just so damn cheap now.

270
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:30,360
And however you think of Microsoft, because I know some people have some feelings around

271
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:36,660
this, GitHub has effectively become the de facto standard for most pieces of, you know,

272
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:41,200
every ID, every deployment, every platform as a service or infrastructure as a service

273
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:44,040
has a little GitHub button to just connect to.

274
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:51,740
And basically does like, let's say 60% of the deployment work, which now this is good

275
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:52,740
for us.

276
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:53,740
We lower our costs.

277
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:57,280
It's also good for our customers because, you know, they're not paying us for a time

278
00:14:57,280 --> 00:15:00,860
that we don't need to be doing hand deployments in those cases.

279
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:05,040
So I'd say ongoing conversation is the right way to put it here too.

280
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:11,000
First of all, we're rebuilding our website and the entire website workflow, we are moving

281
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,040
to essentially GitHub and GitHub actions.

282
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:19,440
So when you want to update a page at jupyterbroadcasting.net, which is our current development site, you

283
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:23,880
go modify a page on GitHub, you check it in and, you know, you make all your changes and

284
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:29,360
then a GitHub action runs and actually renders that static website and redeploys it.

285
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:34,600
We're kind of thinking about that too from a Nix OS standpoint, because as time goes

286
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:39,680
on, we've built out more and more infrastructure as we've leaned more and more into self hosting.

287
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:43,900
And now we kind of have a mix of CentOS.

288
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:45,840
We have Ubuntu, of course.

289
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:48,820
We have several different versions of Ubuntu.

290
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:50,320
We have some SUSE in there.

291
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:51,320
Wait, wait, wait.

292
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:52,320
What was that last one?

293
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:53,320
Some Lizard OS.

294
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:54,320
I've never heard of it before.

295
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,320
Lizard people arise.

296
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:56,320
Yeah.

297
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:57,320
F Atlantis.

298
00:15:57,320 --> 00:16:02,920
And it's like, OK, this is getting a little bit ridiculous because some systems we have

299
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:03,920
a we have a standard.

300
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:07,040
So like all the SSH keys are on there and all the accounts are created.

301
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:10,720
Everybody has the right UIDs and all that kind of stuff and other systems we have nothing

302
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:11,720
like that.

303
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:16,120
And it's just like, oh, this is the box where we don't have any of those standards.

304
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:17,840
Can anybody help me get logged into this box?

305
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:21,360
It's got to wait 15 minutes so that the one person who does have a log in can get you

306
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:22,360
in.

307
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:23,760
And that kind of like no more of that.

308
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:24,760
Right.

309
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:28,000
You know, Jimbo's on the toilet so nobody can get their stuff because the only guy who

310
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,200
is SSH key is actually on the box.

311
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:34,800
Or you can have a situation where it's like the one day a year where I am completely AFK

312
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:38,560
or Wes is completely AFK and it's like, oh, well, now this thing doesn't work like.

313
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:41,200
It's like, OK, we can't do that anymore.

314
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:45,720
And the nice thing I like about Nix is that it's all defined in a configuration file.

315
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:47,080
It's really powerful that way.

316
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:49,400
And that configuration file, of course, you can check in to get.

317
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:54,200
And so you can actually track your changes via get to your OS level configuration and

318
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:55,200
deployments.

319
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:56,600
And that seems super powerful to me.

320
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:57,600
Yeah.

321
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:58,600
You should also explain, right?

322
00:16:58,600 --> 00:16:59,960
Nix is basically a CI tool.

323
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:00,960
Yeah.

324
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:01,960
For OS.

325
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:05,320
It's applied to an OS and that is fantastic.

326
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:06,320
I love that.

327
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:07,320
Right.

328
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:11,680
I mean, the big thing about get ops in general, even away from GitHub or GitLab is kind of

329
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:15,280
pushes it super hard to the only your source of truth.

330
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:16,280
Right.

331
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:18,000
The thing you trust is that remote Git repo.

332
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
So origin.

333
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Right.

334
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:24,560
So your your main branch or whatever it is, very much like an extension of I don't know

335
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:26,760
if this is a popular thing people blog about anymore.

336
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:27,760
But get flow.

337
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:28,760
Are you familiar with that, Chris?

338
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:29,760
Get flow.

339
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:30,760
Get flow.

340
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:31,760
It rings a bell.

341
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:32,760
Yeah.

342
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:36,640
It's like a methodology for naming and branching and tagging releases where basic I mean, there's

343
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:39,780
all everybody has their own little snowflake version of it.

344
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:46,640
But basically, like your main branch is usually production, then you'll have like, you know,

345
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:52,840
staging, customer facing staging, internal dev, where literally the code flows up.

346
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:56,760
And it's always you always have a way to go back, right?

347
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:57,760
And people get fancy.

348
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:00,440
They like to depends on what kind of thing you're doing, right?

349
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:03,720
If you're doing binaries, you can actually like tag versions that are like the build

350
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:04,720
binary.

351
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:09,320
And again, if you're on GitHub, you can literally just put the binary on your page if it's something

352
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:11,680
you're giving away for free and be like, here, just download the binary.

353
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:12,680
Don't bother me.

354
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:16,600
Oh, and then CodePilot can use your code to suggest insane things.

355
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:18,040
Just quick CodePilot diversion.

356
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:20,560
I got it to do something crazy today.

357
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:21,560
Tell me about it.

358
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:24,260
So I'm mixing C++ and Rust in a Python project.

359
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:25,260
It's called Alice.

360
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:26,380
I don't know if you've ever heard of it.

361
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:31,160
And apparently because I wanted to just try something and I did like the inline consume

362
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:37,040
this as C++ thing, I saw the little, you know, in VS code, like you see the little dude with

363
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:39,440
his goggles on the bottom, right?

364
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:40,600
I think his head spun.

365
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:46,160
He was like, what the heck is this madness?

366
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:50,720
So then it started suggesting really weird, what I think is game dev C++ to me.

367
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:52,620
Oh, you're getting the game dev stuff now?

368
00:18:52,620 --> 00:18:53,760
I don't know what happened.

369
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:55,400
It was like, it is not a game, right?

370
00:18:55,400 --> 00:19:00,280
It was just, I wanted to speed something up that's taking too long and it just, yeah.

371
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:02,780
Watch out, you might get a little Carmack in there.

372
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:04,680
And I paid for it for a year.

373
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:07,400
Well then, I look forward to future updates.

374
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:09,280
I'll tell you what.

375
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:13,000
It's like my hilarious companion that I turn off because it keeps suggesting stupid things

376
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
to me.

377
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
All right.

378
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,980
Speaking of things that aren't stupid, the London meetup is nigh.

379
00:19:17,980 --> 00:19:20,960
It is just a few days away as this episode will come out.

380
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:23,440
It is Friday, August 5th in London.

381
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:26,120
Details at meetup.com slash Jupiter broadcasting.

382
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:29,360
And of course, over there, we also have the West Coast meetups posted.

383
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:31,560
All that is coming up soon.

384
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:35,620
And my last thing I'll just say about this, so we don't go on and on, is that if you are

385
00:19:35,620 --> 00:19:40,660
on the West Coast, we could use some location experts for our meetups.

386
00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:46,420
And we have a matrix room dedicated to just the West Coast, and that is at bit.ly slash

387
00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:50,720
West Coast crew.

388
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:56,320
Linode dot com slash coder, go there to get $100 in 60 day credit on a new account, and

389
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:57,600
you go there to support the show.

390
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,740
It's a great way to support the show.

391
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:00,740
What is Linode?

392
00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:03,800
Fast, reliable, cloud hosting.

393
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:04,880
You just got to go try it.

394
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:08,400
That's why you're going to get a hundred bucks and you're going to go kick the tires yourself.

395
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:13,280
Linode is always improving the infrastructure, they've got 11 data centers around the world,

396
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:16,600
and they've always been reinvesting in that infrastructure, staying ahead of all of the

397
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:18,200
other cloud providers.

398
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:19,920
And you can measure it.

399
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:22,140
You can benchmark the systems and you can see it.

400
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:27,320
I have tried the various different hyperscalers out there and Linode competitors, and Linode

401
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:29,740
is always above the rest.

402
00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:31,840
They own their own internet links.

403
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:33,660
They're constantly upgrading their hardware.

404
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:38,360
They've been refining this for nearly 19 years to build the best experience to run applications

405
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:40,720
on Linux in the cloud.

406
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:42,240
You got to go try it for your next project.

407
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:43,240
I mean it.

408
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:44,940
You really have to see what they can do.

409
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:48,080
And of course, Linode is about investing in the community.

410
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,080
They were just at scale.

411
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:52,520
I heard from a lot of you out there that got to see Linode and got some cool Linode swag

412
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:57,120
at scale, and they're making our West Coast road trip possible this year.

413
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:02,540
So we can do meetups all up and down the West Coast and get down to JPL and have that tour.

414
00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:06,240
Linode invests in the community because they're part of the Linux community.

415
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:07,520
They've been around forever.

416
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:10,860
That's how I found them originally, was at a Linux fest.

417
00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:15,820
And now I use them for everything we deploy that our staff needs to use, our team, but

418
00:21:15,820 --> 00:21:18,600
also our community, anything customer facing.

419
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:19,600
It's on Linode.

420
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:22,080
They have better pricing than the major hyperscalers out there.

421
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:27,160
They have a better interface, better documentation, and leagues better support.

422
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:30,440
Whole different category.

423
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:32,240
Nobody else touches Linode on the support.

424
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:34,560
And when that matters, it really matters.

425
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:35,920
So go try it.

426
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:36,920
Go see what you can do.

427
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:37,920
Go build something.

428
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:38,920
Go learn something.

429
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:39,920
Go do a one click deployment.

430
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:42,960
Just go get that hundred bucks and support the show.

431
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:44,740
Linode.com slash coder.

432
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:45,800
That's where you go to sign up.

433
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:46,800
Try it out.

434
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:49,000
Join the show and get a hundred bucks.

435
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:53,800
Linode.com slash coder.

436
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:54,800
All right.

437
00:21:54,800 --> 00:22:01,120
Let's get a little spicy with Clojure here because apparently Clojure has a hole and

438
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:03,160
it's a rails shaped hole.

439
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:06,200
There's a hole in the Clojure tonight.

440
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:07,200
Yeah.

441
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:11,880
There's a compiler error of fear and sorrow.

442
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:17,640
Clojure developers are just staring down a foggy railway, just lost.

443
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:22,560
They're in a 90s Soul Asylum video, like wandering children down a runaway train.

444
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:24,360
With that weird filter on it.

445
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:26,680
Is that black and white or is it just muted colors?

446
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:27,680
I can't quite tell.

447
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:28,920
It was VH1.

448
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:29,920
Thank you very much.

449
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:30,920
Everything had a filter.

450
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:33,520
Or no, that was MTV, wasn't it?

451
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:34,520
Yeah.

452
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:35,520
So Clojure.

453
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,760
I don't know if you've ever heard of this language.

454
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:38,320
I have some weirdos like it.

455
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:39,320
Wes was so dog.

456
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:40,320
Yeah.

457
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:41,320
Some people I know.

458
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:42,320
Some guy.

459
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:43,320
Whatever.

460
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:44,320
He's always challenging me with weird languages.

461
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:45,400
That was a lot of fun.

462
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:49,520
You should listen back if you never had the, what was it like seven months for Wes tortured

463
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:52,960
me with weird programming languages that weren't Objective C.

464
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:55,040
It turns out if you try hard enough, you can.

465
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:57,360
There he is.

466
00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:02,960
So yeah, Clojure has a problem according to the author of this post, Janet Carr.

467
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:05,160
And I tend to agree with her.

468
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:07,680
You know, Ruby was kind of obscure until Rails came out.

469
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:09,280
Thank you DHH.

470
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:13,760
Clojure does not have a Rails and it has a weird succession of potential web development

471
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:19,200
frameworks and suitors for this kind of application.

472
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:24,120
But no one has come out on top, which I will never repeat this in front of Wes, is a damn

473
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:27,080
shame because Clojure has got some really interesting ideas in it.

474
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:28,080
Yeah.

475
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:32,840
Now is the idea maybe with Clojure that you're not supposed to need something like Rails,

476
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:37,820
that they're going to solve this stuff lower level, you build what you need on top of that.

477
00:23:37,820 --> 00:23:39,640
And you know, you don't need a Rails with Clojure.

478
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:41,520
There's two ways to look at it.

479
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:44,560
Like what do we mean when we say a Rails for Clojure?

480
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:46,120
The way you read that is exactly correct.

481
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:50,280
It's you know, something super abstract, high level that's easy and quick for development

482
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:53,800
and you know, people can get into the language a lot easier.

483
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:56,880
Or you could say, no, it's not the style of Rails.

484
00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:01,400
It's just like a de facto standard, which for a long time Rails was and in my opinion

485
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:02,400
still is for Ruby.

486
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:06,360
Because when you have a standard, right, when there's a de facto standard framework, what

487
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:13,120
happens is all, many, not all, but most of the library developers keep that framework

488
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:17,120
in mind, compatibility and convenience for that framework in mind when they develop their

489
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:22,560
library such that again, just like the Ruby ecosystem, the ecosystem ends up coagulating

490
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:28,000
around that framework and it's usually pretty easy to pull in any gem and make it work with

491
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,000
your Rails app.

492
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,720
Yeah, there's no denying that.

493
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:33,960
And you've seen the ecosystem around that.

494
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:40,280
You know, I think if you were to get Wes drunk, maybe one late night and you got him going

495
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:44,080
about closure, I think he'd probably talk about luminous, I think is how you say it,

496
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:47,960
which kind of promises to be the missing Rails.

497
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:50,240
But how could anything be Rails at this point?

498
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:51,240
Nothing.

499
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:53,320
Like when you say Rails, what are you really saying?

500
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:57,640
Are you just trying to like invoke like an idea or are you actually trying to say you're

501
00:24:57,640 --> 00:25:00,160
going to compete with everything that Rails does now?

502
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:03,760
Yeah, I would also argue, right, like with TurboLinks and some of, in fact, we should

503
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:08,040
probably revisit Rails, it's been a long time, but with some of the TurboLinks stuff, I mean,

504
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:11,000
if you look at the Hey app, it's crazy.

505
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,520
Rails is so different from what Rails used to be.

506
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:17,320
If you're using some of the newer hotness, like it would be very interesting to take

507
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:23,040
like a Rails 3 and a Rails 7 kind of the best practices and development methodologies, particularly

508
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:28,280
for a full stack website and say, yeah, this is kind of different and all hell active record

509
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:30,800
still better than SQL Alchemy.

510
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:34,680
Well, I'll drop a couple of links in the show notes.

511
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:37,480
I feel like, you know, one of these days, what we've got to do is track down that Wes

512
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:41,040
Payne and get him on here and get him to explain himself how he could still defend something

513
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:42,040
like this.

514
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:44,280
I'm going to challenge Wes Payne.

515
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:50,960
Wes, if you're listening, you pick a language and I'll pick a language and we'll do a challenge.

516
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:58,080
But this challenge, we have to build a tiny, tiny app that pulls some Jupyter broadcasting

517
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:02,840
public GitHub page, maybe for the website and just like looks at the commits or something.

518
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:04,120
We'll think about it.

519
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:05,120
I like it.

520
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:06,840
Yes, it is hammer time.

521
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:10,040
I think that soundboard clip is consent, right?

522
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:11,960
I think that's implied consent right there.

523
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:14,920
So you've been hanging out with Dick Cheney again, huh?

524
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:17,320
Or that's a little more Harvey Weinstein, let's be honest.

525
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:18,320
Yeah, right.

526
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:21,560
No, when I go duck hunting, I'll let you know.

527
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:26,720
I know that you had a little bit of a skirmish this weekend.

528
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:30,400
And I'm it's kind of I feel like you're out there doing some field testing for the show.

529
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:33,840
And now you can report back on the great migration.

530
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:42,500
I got a little bit of let's say sass, but a little, you know, Apple guy saying, why

531
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:44,320
do you pay for machines all the time?

532
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:45,840
You know, you get a new machine.

533
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:47,100
You don't need to do that.

534
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:49,180
Use migration system is flawless.

535
00:26:49,180 --> 00:26:52,780
So do you normally when you get a new laptop, it's like, OK, so walk me through.

536
00:26:52,780 --> 00:26:57,680
So you spill your drink, you get rid of your laptop, you buy a brand new machine just coincidentally

537
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:59,400
as a new hardware lands.

538
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:01,000
And then do you start from a fresh install?

539
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:04,320
Well, if we're going to start from the beginning, first, I dance around Buffalo Bill style.

540
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:05,320
OK, good, good.

541
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:06,600
I'm glad we know that now.

542
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:07,600
Good.

543
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:12,120
Then I inevitably drop the laptop in a pit with a small poodle of some sort.

544
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:13,120
Oops.

545
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:14,120
Oops.

546
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:16,560
But I have never actually used migration assistant before.

547
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:22,720
So my usual process is I get pull my damn bash RC that I always forget is seashell now.

548
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:27,960
So I have to edit it every single time and I still haven't pushed it up for some reason.

549
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:31,440
And yeah, that's just Mike being lazy.

550
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:33,640
And I you know, you know the drill, right?

551
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:36,700
You got to install Xcode, the command line tools.

552
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:40,180
Then you realize you don't have the headers for Postgres or something.

553
00:27:40,180 --> 00:27:44,880
It's both tedious, but at the same time, it's like you're only building back what you need

554
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:47,780
and you're going with the freshest versions of everything.

555
00:27:47,780 --> 00:27:51,200
And maybe this is the build where you try a different video player or something.

556
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:52,200
Right.

557
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:54,480
So the disadvantage is to not just copying whole hog.

558
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:58,600
But the disadvantage is really that Xcode step because it's just awful.

559
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:00,380
It's just slow and terrible.

560
00:28:00,380 --> 00:28:05,240
So you know, I was getting some flack about this that it's flawless and it even works

561
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:07,180
across ARM and Intel.

562
00:28:07,180 --> 00:28:08,560
That's pretty impressive.

563
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:09,560
Cross architectures.

564
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:10,560
Damn.

565
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:11,560
Yes.

566
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:12,560
Lies are often impressive.

567
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:13,560
Yes.

568
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:16,380
I feel like I have a couple of bridges to sell you.

569
00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:20,600
So it did appear to work and it did take like an hour and a half.

570
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:24,520
But it very foolishly and I don't understand why they don't do this because they could

571
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:27,800
certainly add this to the program because you have to actually launch like a little

572
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:34,720
migration assistant application where it's like, hey, buddy, that's a different CPU architecture.

573
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:37,560
So no.

574
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:41,920
Or we're not going to copy over your homebrew stuff or your command line stuff and leave

575
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:46,720
you leave your system in this insane state where you couldn't totally like chill and

576
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:47,720
so forth.

577
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:50,060
Like if you just like chill in the gooey, you're probably fine.

578
00:28:50,060 --> 00:28:54,200
The minute you open terminal, it's just going to scream in agony.

579
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:55,200
Yeah.

580
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:57,800
So it sounds like it would move some things, but not other things.

581
00:28:57,800 --> 00:28:59,320
And it would just be a total hodgepodge.

582
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:04,480
Well, it's not just that it does move them and it moves most of them, but it doesn't

583
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:08,600
check what architecture your stuff is compiled for.

584
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:14,920
And like really common stuff like homebrew homebrew, fun fact, saves in a different location

585
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:17,080
on ARM CPU machines.

586
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:22,480
It saves it's like slash ops homebrew where I might get this wrong, but it's like slash

587
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:27,000
library slash something on Intel.

588
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,000
It's user local bin.

589
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:33,200
So you're telling me the migration tool that Apple ships in the most recent versions of

590
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:39,440
Mac OS, which support both Intel and ARM, doesn't differentiate on that stuff.

591
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:40,980
What is ARM code?

592
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:46,000
Even though you can get info and it's in the metadata of the application, it's in the metadata

593
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,080
right there available to the system.

594
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:49,080
Right.

595
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:51,160
And I'm not suggesting it should do like program by program.

596
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:52,160
I'm suggesting.

597
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:53,160
Oh, I am.

598
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:54,160
Don't you think, dude?

599
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:55,160
Oh, don't you think?

600
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:59,520
I feel like once you plug a machine of the other architecture into the, you know, other

601
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:02,920
architecture, it should be like, hey, man, just there should be like a warning, right?

602
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:05,220
Hey, man, this is going to be wild.

603
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:08,400
Or like, hey, would you like to do just the universal applications?

604
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:12,040
Which by the way, that means you don't get these three app for applications and these,

605
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:13,040
you know, whatever.

606
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:17,840
Or, you know, like would you like to bring over the Intel stuff because like you're crapping

607
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:22,240
up basically a brand new Mac with a ton of stuff that's going to have to run under Rosetta.

608
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:25,360
Well, this is not a brand new Mac, but yeah, but you get my point, right?

609
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:27,880
Somebody bought a new M2 or whatever, sits down.

610
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:28,880
Yeah.

611
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:29,880
So you get screwed both ways.

612
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:35,420
If you go Intel to ARM, you unnecessarily run everything in Rosetta, which is dumb.

613
00:30:35,420 --> 00:30:40,320
But if you go, what I did is I went ARM to Intel and it just copies ARM binaries over

614
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:42,440
and they're just busted.

615
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:44,120
I can't even believe this.

616
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:50,000
Like, I mean, this sounds like something out of a beta tool, like an alpha tool that just

617
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:54,440
hasn't been like updated by the community for the new architecture support.

618
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:57,760
Not from like the manufacturer of the OS and the hardware.

619
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:58,760
It was pretty bad.

620
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:02,520
I spent about an hour trying to hammer out like these insane terminal errors.

621
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:04,660
And then I'm like, you know what?

622
00:31:04,660 --> 00:31:07,400
System preferences, erase all settings and content.

623
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:13,120
And I just did it, I paved it by hand and I did the, you know, my normal set up process.

624
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:14,360
Oh, man.

625
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:15,360
It's so funny, right?

626
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:19,600
Because we're in this state where the M1 and the M2 hardware, it's just some of the best

627
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:20,600
hardware out there.

628
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:23,200
It really is in terms of power and performance.

629
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:33,880
I just had my first experience with some really advanced, very expensive audio repair plugins.

630
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:41,080
And they've always been single threaded on x86 machines and on Intel Macs, you know,

631
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:43,720
but on like Linux under wine, just anywhere we've used it.

632
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:50,000
And it just takes forever, like an hour long track just would take at least an hour to

633
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,000
render and process.

634
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:54,200
When you're trying to edit, that's just brutal.

635
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:58,160
And this weekend I was helping out a friend and I was like, well, I'll try this.

636
00:31:58,160 --> 00:32:03,160
I've got this on this Mac, I'll try it here on this, on the, you know, the MacBook Pro

637
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:06,520
with the Ultra M1 Ultra in it.

638
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:15,760
And when it lit up all the cores and it did an hour long audio in, I don't know, 20 seconds,

639
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:22,360
it was the first time I saw that, that like huge leap in something that I have used for

640
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:25,880
a decade that's always taken like basically it's a one to one ratio.

641
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:29,560
Whatever the length of the file I was rendering out was, you know, that was just how long

642
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:30,720
I was going to wait.

643
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:33,600
You know, for the first time ever, I saw it.

644
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:38,580
And the great thing about it was, is this was in a pinch on the go.

645
00:32:38,580 --> 00:32:41,980
And you know, I only had like 20% battery left because I hadn't had the machine plugged

646
00:32:41,980 --> 00:32:43,740
in for like a week.

647
00:32:43,740 --> 00:32:46,600
And it used like 2% battery to do all of that.

648
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:48,640
And that was a that was like, wow, that's great.

649
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:49,640
That is really great.

650
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:58,920
But I have to say, I remain unenthused with Mac OS, like the amount of tweaking here and

651
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:03,480
there and little tool that does like this one or two things that cost me at least five

652
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:10,120
or 10 bucks and all that little stuff you got to do to make Mac OS a fully functional

653
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:11,120
workstation.

654
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:15,700
If you're honest with yourself, it's more work than setting up the plasma desktop or

655
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:17,080
the GNOME desktop.

656
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:22,600
So on the OS side, or just like this kind of stuff, the migration stuff, that isn't

657
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:24,280
a premium experience.

658
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:29,200
You're buying a premium machine, supposedly has a custom OS built by the hardware vendor,

659
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:33,760
yet the migration assistant seems to be clueless about the architecture of the applications.

660
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:35,040
That's actually hilarious.

661
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:37,920
That's that's a worse experience than you get on the free desktop.

662
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:39,720
Like that kind of stuff.

663
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:40,720
That drives me crazy.

664
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:46,700
But another area that I find sort of user hostile is Apple remains still completely

665
00:33:46,700 --> 00:33:52,440
insufficient in the tools that they give their end users to manage their file system and

666
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:53,440
their data.

667
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:58,320
And when you have photos and you have your Xcode projects on there or your media library

668
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:02,280
projects, that stuff is priceless.

669
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:09,560
And APFS has capabilities and tools that are not exposed to the end user in any meaningful

670
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:11,280
way at all.

671
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:16,360
And I just find it completely just unacceptable because Apple of the past went out of their

672
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:21,080
way to integrate this ridiculous time machine effect where you could go to any folder on

673
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:25,360
your Mac and you get a stupid button and you go into a stupid space effect and then you

674
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:27,400
could fly through time.

675
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:30,600
But it visually made sense to restore data.

676
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:34,920
And now Apple has built in snapshot capabilities into the file system and they don't expose

677
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:39,020
any of that stuff to the user time machine remains barely adequate at best.

678
00:34:39,020 --> 00:34:44,020
And Mac OS requires tons of little utilities and fixes to make it actually usable.

679
00:34:44,020 --> 00:34:47,560
So it's like the hardware has just completely outstretched the software.

680
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:52,600
I don't know if you saw this, but the latest Linux kernel was just released this weekend

681
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:54,120
right on time.

682
00:34:54,120 --> 00:35:00,080
And Linus announced that this was the first Linux kernel that's ever been released from

683
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:01,280
an ARM Mac.

684
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:05,000
He's running Asahi Linux now on his ARM Mac.

685
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:09,520
And that's Linus's setup now to run Linux.

686
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:11,600
I don't know if it's a MacBook Air, probably.

687
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:13,560
That seems to be his favorite machine or what.

688
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:22,280
But Linus Torvalds is using Apple hardware and he just released 5.19 from an ARM 64 machine

689
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:25,480
and he felt like it was worth noting in the release announcement.

690
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:26,800
I mean, that's beautiful.

691
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:34,320
I think that's, yeah, Reddit must be aflame.

692
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:36,280
Tailscale.com slash coder.

693
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:39,520
Go there to get a free personal account for up to 20 devices.

694
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:43,880
And of course, you support the show when you go to tailscale.com slash coder.

695
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:45,040
Come here, traveler.

696
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:49,840
Let me give you a secret weapon that will help you on your travels because Tailscale

697
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:54,520
is that zero config VPN you have been looking for.

698
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:57,060
It installs on any device in minutes.

699
00:35:57,060 --> 00:35:58,560
It manages firewall rules.

700
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:00,120
It handles that double net situation.

701
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:05,380
If you're in that situation, you can quickly and easily create a flat network protected

702
00:36:05,380 --> 00:36:07,880
by WireGuard's noise protocol.

703
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:12,240
That whatever desktop OS you're on, you can get tools to manage that super simply.

704
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:15,960
Plus it has a great command line that also makes it really easy to bring things up and

705
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:17,100
down.

706
00:36:17,100 --> 00:36:20,880
If you've got five devices, you can probably get everything online in five minutes.

707
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:22,000
It's that easy.

708
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,880
I've got it on my Raspberry Pis.

709
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:25,160
I've got it on my mobile devices.

710
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:26,680
I've got it on my x86 boxes.

711
00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:28,120
I've got it on my family's computers.

712
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:29,360
I've got it on my virtual machines.

713
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:31,160
I've got it on my VPS's.

714
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:35,640
It brings everything together into one flat network and then I get static IPs.

715
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:39,840
So now I've got a static IP for the devices I use the most often for those web dashboards

716
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:43,880
I need to get access to or those machines I need to SSH into or that box I got a remote

717
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:45,400
desktop to.

718
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:51,100
It's all one flat network now and it's changed everything for me and it literally made the

719
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:54,200
show possible while I was traveling a few months ago.

720
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:58,900
And one of the best parts about it is that it handles that mobile NAT that you get when

721
00:36:58,900 --> 00:37:03,020
you're on like a cell phone connection which can really screw things up for certain types

722
00:37:03,020 --> 00:37:06,160
of applications just intelligently handles that.

723
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:10,800
It also just brilliantly handles the routing so your data doesn't get sent to the wrong

724
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:15,560
area like you know some VPN's might route everything through the VPN connection.

725
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:17,820
Tailscale don't do that.

726
00:37:17,820 --> 00:37:21,440
They're always always intelligent about the way they handle the traffic.

727
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:22,440
Just love that.

728
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:23,440
And why?

729
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:24,440
Why I love it?

730
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:25,440
Because I can leave it on.

731
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:27,480
That means I can always leave tailscale connected.

732
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:32,720
So that means that mesh wire guard protected network is always available to me.

733
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:35,380
And they can sign in through your existing identity provider.

734
00:37:35,380 --> 00:37:38,560
So if you're a small business or something you know if you got or maybe it's like maybe

735
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:42,480
you just like to do things through a single sign on you want to have some two factor authentication.

736
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:44,000
I don't know what you do.

737
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,440
Tailscale will support that too.

738
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:46,700
So go try it out.

739
00:37:46,700 --> 00:37:51,180
Go get the always on VPN that really works with GUI's for the platforms you use.

740
00:37:51,180 --> 00:37:54,240
Super DNS friendly and dead simple to set up.

741
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:57,620
Those are just some of the reasons I use tailscale every single day.

742
00:37:57,620 --> 00:38:03,640
So try it now for yourself for free up to 20 devices at tailscale.com slash coder.

743
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:08,400
That's tailscale.com slash coder.

744
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:09,400
All right.

745
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:14,740
Apparently we have the secrets to become a successful software engineer.

746
00:38:14,740 --> 00:38:17,520
Are you we are we sure we want to just give it away for free.

747
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:20,480
I mean maybe we should like have some sort of online course they have to sign up for

748
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:21,480
us.

749
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:23,920
Manning Press isn't giving it away for free ever.

750
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:24,920
It's against the rules.

751
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:25,920
Oh no.

752
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:31,600
So you know we always get the hey I'm starting out emails you know what should I look into

753
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:33,840
any books any courses.

754
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:35,760
And because I'm an old man I love books.

755
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:40,840
I don't particularly care for video courses.

756
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:47,040
So I used to and still do recommend Mike underlies coder to developer but that it's a great book.

757
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:48,300
I think you should read it.

758
00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:50,440
It's also super dated.

759
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:55,920
There's some stuff in there that that will seem somewhat comical given the way one the

760
00:38:55,920 --> 00:39:01,200
world has changed but remote work and to just the types of technologies that the vast majority

761
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:06,120
of you are probably interested in but still full of good advice.

762
00:39:06,120 --> 00:39:14,400
However however many press unashamed goes for the mantle with Fernando D'Alio.

763
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:15,400
I hope I said that right.

764
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:20,240
I don't know if he's Italian but I gave it the Italian G.L. thing anyway.

765
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:22,680
So hopefully I said that right.

766
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:27,120
Fernando published skills of a successful software engineer which weirdly had another

767
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:29,720
title at some point too.

768
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:36,680
It is like coder to developer but written after you know within the last five years.

769
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:37,680
OK.

770
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:38,680
Super good.

771
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:44,340
A lot of good advice doesn't focus on any particular technologies or languages but it

772
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:49,800
covers things like TV a lot about how to successfully work remotely particularly 100 percent remote

773
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:55,680
which I think a lot of people should probably read and kind of the basics of like you know

774
00:39:55,680 --> 00:40:02,160
don't be a jackass but it's targeted very much for beginning junior developers and I

775
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:06,920
kind of goes through the different concerns that might be hard for you to see at that

776
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:11,520
level the other your managers or the more senior people in your team might have tips

777
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:16,240
for how to continually improve your skills and literally do continuous improvement.

778
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:20,040
So again we were just talking about get offs right stuff like that.

779
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:25,320
I can't say I agree with 100 percent of everything in the book but it's worth reading.

780
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:26,360
It's five stars for me.

781
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:27,360
It's a must must buy.

782
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:28,360
All right.

783
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:32,260
Well of course we'll have a link at coder dot show slash four seven seven.

784
00:40:32,260 --> 00:40:37,400
And then we got one more here code to developer tools and strategies for delivering your software.

785
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:40,880
And this one they got a Kindle version.

786
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:44,440
And now it is time for the boost.

787
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:45,440
Let's do it.

788
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:50,560
A Chiron I'm going to say came in with a row of duckeroos duck D.U.K.

789
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:55,520
duck loaded with talent two thousand two hundred and twenty two stats been listening since

790
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:56,760
episode one.

791
00:40:56,760 --> 00:40:58,860
And here's my first boost.

792
00:40:58,860 --> 00:41:04,240
I'd be interested to hear your thoughts on things like solid pods and the semantic web

793
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:08,520
as a means of building a truly decentralized Internet.

794
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:09,520
What's up Richard Hendricks.

795
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:14,540
Yeah I feel like I totally would love to see a truly decentralized Internet but I don't

796
00:41:14,540 --> 00:41:20,120
know if I've seen anything that's going to compels me to say there's going to be traction.

797
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:27,340
And we do have an announcement to make in regards to the show and the boosts swigs writes

798
00:41:27,340 --> 00:41:33,640
in with our last cheap boost for the show three hundred stats.

799
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:37,160
After today we're going to set the limit to two thousand stats to get into the show just

800
00:41:37,160 --> 00:41:39,540
to keep it tight because we got to keep you know we want to make it nice and tight here

801
00:41:39,540 --> 00:41:41,140
on the show don't take too long.

802
00:41:41,140 --> 00:41:44,240
But swigs you get the last one because I hadn't made the announcement yet and I think it's

803
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:45,240
perfect.

804
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:48,640
I'm glad actually because swigs writes I've been listening to Jupiter broadcasting for

805
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:50,480
the better part of a year now.

806
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:56,060
I finally broke down and installed the fountain app and it's actually really nice to be able

807
00:41:56,060 --> 00:41:59,660
to contribute to the podcast of my choice in such an easy manner because it just puts

808
00:41:59,660 --> 00:42:01,440
the button right there while you're listening.

809
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:05,960
Side note I run sailfish OS on a Sony Xperia 10 man the people who have experience love

810
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:06,960
him.

811
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:08,920
He says the fountain app works great as expected.

812
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:13,280
Thanks for the content and keep up the podcasting 2.0 fight.

813
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:14,320
Thank you sir.

814
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:15,320
Thank you very much.

815
00:42:15,320 --> 00:42:16,320
Appreciate you.

816
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:17,320
All right.

817
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:22,240
Optimus Gray who's also watching live right now boosted in with a big set of grandpa ducks

818
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:26,480
twenty two thousand two hundred and twenty two stats.

819
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:27,480
Thank you very much.

820
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:28,960
And here's something for your trouble.

821
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:29,960
All right.

822
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:32,160
I feel like this is where we're going to get in trouble in this episode Mike.

823
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:33,160
But here we go.

824
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:38,080
He says I know you guys are not the lawyers this is not lawyer radio but I have been tasked

825
00:42:38,080 --> 00:42:42,720
with coming up with the open source alternatives and tools for dependencies we currently use.

826
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:46,480
Where is a good source on what types of licenses can be used in the corporate world.

827
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:49,320
You know as simple BSD or versus open core.

828
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:51,720
What are all the differences and where should I go.

829
00:42:51,720 --> 00:42:56,160
So there's a question right there like do you have anywhere you send people.

830
00:42:56,160 --> 00:43:00,280
I've got a link that I'm going to put in the show notes that is like a look from a legal

831
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:04,280
level and they have a visual matrix breakdown of the different licenses but I'm curious

832
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:08,200
what you would do like if you were going to go research if this is legal.

833
00:43:08,200 --> 00:43:09,200
Is this risky.

834
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:12,040
You know like there's got to be somewhere you start right.

835
00:43:12,040 --> 00:43:19,160
I mean I have a pretty super conservative thing if it's not Apache BSD or MIT I don't

836
00:43:19,160 --> 00:43:20,160
use it.

837
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:21,720
Yeah that's kind of the safe way to do it I suppose.

838
00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:22,720
Yeah.

839
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:24,880
So I'm sure I'll definitely take a look at your chart.

840
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:28,320
Yeah and let us know what you think out there audience because I think that is a question

841
00:43:28,320 --> 00:43:30,520
that we've never 100 percent answered on the show.

842
00:43:30,520 --> 00:43:33,480
But I do have a link in the show notes and maybe we can start there.

843
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:34,480
I love this.

844
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:40,460
This next username wine bat boosted in with 5000 sats boost after the last couple of episodes

845
00:43:40,460 --> 00:43:44,280
it may be in it may be time to start the flutter challenge.

846
00:43:44,280 --> 00:43:49,320
Maybe bring West and maybe I mean that's so time consuming that's what the thing about

847
00:43:49,320 --> 00:43:50,320
the challenges.

848
00:43:50,320 --> 00:43:53,480
Yeah the challenges are tough especially like if it's going to be a gooey thing that's even

849
00:43:53,480 --> 00:43:57,960
harder and we should keep it on the back we should do something.

850
00:43:57,960 --> 00:44:01,920
I don't you know flutter we hear a lot about flutter but I'm not sure if that's the flutter

851
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:08,040
folks and right and if you are you know are there a lot of them listening or are we just

852
00:44:08,040 --> 00:44:10,720
hearing from the are they super vocal.

853
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:11,720
Right.

854
00:44:11,720 --> 00:44:14,840
Yeah you know but that's what we said about rust early on too.

855
00:44:14,840 --> 00:44:16,840
And it's all Jeremy Soller.

856
00:44:16,840 --> 00:44:19,640
All right Trump to have boosted.

857
00:44:19,640 --> 00:44:20,640
Hello Trump.

858
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:21,640
Good to see you again.

859
00:44:21,640 --> 00:44:24,800
2048 sats coming in hot with the blues.

860
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:28,200
He's followed up to a question I asked last week when he said that you know Microsoft

861
00:44:28,200 --> 00:44:31,400
is trying to extinguish Linux I said do you really think they're trying to extinguish

862
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:32,400
it.

863
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:38,440
And I guess what I mean by extinguish is make Linux as irrelevant as possible.

864
00:44:38,440 --> 00:44:42,400
OK not long ago working primarily with FOSS was not easy to convince people to do.

865
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:43,400
I agree.

866
00:44:43,400 --> 00:44:47,640
He goes on to say Microsoft sees the competitive nature of free software today.

867
00:44:47,640 --> 00:44:52,260
They'll keep fluffing us up buying our platforms buying our talent and taking over as much

868
00:44:52,260 --> 00:44:55,160
as they need to keep the Linux desktop from being competitive.

869
00:44:55,160 --> 00:45:00,320
The cloud maybe at the end of the day they need to convince managers and bean counters

870
00:45:00,320 --> 00:45:03,720
that their solution is better.

871
00:45:03,720 --> 00:45:04,720
Yeah that might be it.

872
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:05,720
I don't know.

873
00:45:05,720 --> 00:45:06,720
Yeah I don't know.

874
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:11,320
See I think nobody thinks about desktop Linux more than desktop Linux people.

875
00:45:11,320 --> 00:45:12,400
I'm sorry.

876
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:17,640
And I love my devil one and my my pop OS and all that but I think Microsoft is just happy

877
00:45:17,640 --> 00:45:21,200
to make a ton of money on Azure using Linux and they're cool with that right.

878
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:24,920
I know that using word is doing a lot of work in that sense but I agree.

879
00:45:24,920 --> 00:45:29,320
And if you want to if you want to use the GNOME desktop and you want to write all of

880
00:45:29,320 --> 00:45:33,120
your code in GNOME text and then you know upload it.

881
00:45:33,120 --> 00:45:37,760
No one no one wants to write all of their but they don't care right as long as you're

882
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:41,560
running on Azure services or maybe you're using VS code they don't care.

883
00:45:41,560 --> 00:45:44,800
I don't even think they really care about VS code it's all just to get you up to Azure

884
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:48,840
like that's it's we did we predict this like three years ago or four years ago.

885
00:45:48,840 --> 00:45:51,040
It's just it's all about Azure.

886
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:52,560
All roads lead to Azure.

887
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:57,240
The only thing that the only influence desktop Linux has had not only but the biggest one

888
00:45:57,240 --> 00:46:01,760
is Katie is naming conventions every time I go to a store and see a giant K I'm like

889
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:07,880
is that a Linux product or the GNOME stuff that you know the G at it like it's not kibble

890
00:46:07,880 --> 00:46:10,840
it's K kibble I don't even know why my poor dog.

891
00:46:10,840 --> 00:46:15,820
And here's why here's why I'm pretty confident in this assessment is because in this assessment

892
00:46:15,820 --> 00:46:19,720
Microsoft makes money with Linux is successful or Windows is successful.

893
00:46:19,720 --> 00:46:22,880
They don't need Linux to fail to make money in this area.

894
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:26,000
I'm pretty sure they make more money on Azure now too.

895
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:27,000
All right.

896
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:31,480
Noob Steve comes in with a big grandpa roll of tux twenty two thousand two hundred and

897
00:46:31,480 --> 00:46:32,480
twenty two sacks.

898
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:33,480
Thank you very much.

899
00:46:33,480 --> 00:46:35,720
And here's something for your trouble.

900
00:46:35,720 --> 00:46:41,400
Long time listener first time boost first written in before but I'm the dude who retired

901
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:44,160
from the Navy and is hoping to move into dev work.

902
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:45,160
I've got two questions.

903
00:46:45,160 --> 00:46:46,160
Oh great.

904
00:46:46,160 --> 00:46:51,920
Noob Steve says first I hear this and other podcasts how much everyone just seems to love

905
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:53,800
rust how awesome it is.

906
00:46:53,800 --> 00:46:56,320
If that's the case why are there no jobs for it.

907
00:46:56,320 --> 00:47:00,280
I'd love to learn it but it definitely needs to focus on what's going to get me a job at

908
00:47:00,280 --> 00:47:02,380
least in the next two years.

909
00:47:02,380 --> 00:47:03,800
That's a fair assessment right there.

910
00:47:03,800 --> 00:47:04,800
Yeah.

911
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:08,700
So everybody loves rust because rust is technically very good.

912
00:47:08,700 --> 00:47:11,800
Lawyers don't hire for a lot of rust because rust is technically very good and very hard

913
00:47:11,800 --> 00:47:16,760
to develop in if you don't want to spend lots of money on very senior developers.

914
00:47:16,760 --> 00:47:18,880
That's a great observation right there.

915
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:21,240
And you know what it is is a lot of senior developers who've been in these positions

916
00:47:21,240 --> 00:47:23,120
forever are just rewriting their tools and rust.

917
00:47:23,120 --> 00:47:24,120
They've already got the jobs.

918
00:47:24,120 --> 00:47:28,920
And a lot of like the more vocal rust people are people who've been doing C plus plus for

919
00:47:28,920 --> 00:47:31,520
a long time and are just tired of getting bitten.

920
00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:32,520
But right.

921
00:47:32,520 --> 00:47:38,680
It's I mean maybe again if you're a new person who's like diving into rust as your first

922
00:47:38,680 --> 00:47:41,640
language I got protect you.

923
00:47:41,640 --> 00:47:42,800
God bless you.

924
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:44,000
Good luck.

925
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:45,000
But I don't know.

926
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:50,020
Like if you're looking for quantity of jobs anything Webby Python can do basically anything

927
00:47:50,020 --> 00:47:53,000
because we've all decided that we'll just we're Google.

928
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,520
Every problem can be solved with a Python script.

929
00:47:55,520 --> 00:48:00,240
And unfortunately especially with your Navy background well not unfortunately but it depends

930
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:05,880
on how much of a Linux zealot you are got that baby especially with that military background.

931
00:48:05,880 --> 00:48:11,340
As long as you got a nice honorable discharge there are tons of contractors who will totally

932
00:48:11,340 --> 00:48:13,560
hire you to do C sharp.

933
00:48:13,560 --> 00:48:15,040
I agree with everything.

934
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:18,720
Plus one to all of that and don't feel bad about it either noob Steve because you know

935
00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:23,200
say you go down the dot net path you go you know heavy with the web development stuff

936
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:25,640
it could be you know three four years five years.

937
00:48:25,640 --> 00:48:27,080
It doesn't mean you don't pick something up.

938
00:48:27,080 --> 00:48:29,920
In the meantime you don't start a side hobby you don't start learning something else you

939
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:33,560
don't transition to something else you just got to get that ball rolling.

940
00:48:33,560 --> 00:48:39,760
Also being a veteran or soon to be a soon to be veteran that puts you for that particular

941
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:44,360
and maybe you don't want to do the military contract knows that puts you in a basically

942
00:48:44,360 --> 00:48:47,120
automatically ahead of anybody else.

943
00:48:47,120 --> 00:48:52,560
Even if you go work for a smaller and contractor there's tons of them around they're always

944
00:48:52,560 --> 00:48:53,560
hiring dot net.

945
00:48:53,560 --> 00:48:54,560
Yeah that's a great point.

946
00:48:54,560 --> 00:48:56,000
That's probably the easiest path.

947
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,880
Keep us posted noob Steve and he actually rounds it out we're just about done he rounds

948
00:48:58,880 --> 00:49:05,320
it out with a double boost with a double grandpa's another grandpa's.

949
00:49:05,320 --> 00:49:08,240
All right my other question is maybe a little controversial.

950
00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:12,040
I'm not looking to start a flame war but I just actually want to understand why the hell

951
00:49:12,040 --> 00:49:16,880
would anyone want to use Vim or Emacs when there's tools like VS code and JetBrains.

952
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:21,200
I have a student license so I get JetBrains cheap but I couldn't imagine using anything

953
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:23,040
but JetBrains and VS code.

954
00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:24,400
What am I missing?

955
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:27,440
Is there some kind of amazing functionality I'm overlooking?

956
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:32,600
Me trying to quit Vim is the best way to seed your encryption by the way.

957
00:49:32,600 --> 00:49:35,380
Part of me agrees with noob Steve I'd like to hear the audience's answer though I'd like

958
00:49:35,380 --> 00:49:38,320
people to let us know boost in and let us know what you think.

959
00:49:38,320 --> 00:49:40,840
And Steve I'm just going to double down on my dot net.

960
00:49:40,840 --> 00:49:45,640
Check out Visual Studio you will you will love it or JetBrains project writer or just

961
00:49:45,640 --> 00:49:48,400
be sharper in Visual Studio you'll be very happy.

962
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:50,480
I don't know people are purists right?

963
00:49:50,480 --> 00:49:56,280
I mean I use Vim for some stuff but I have been seduced by the ways of VS code.

964
00:49:56,280 --> 00:50:03,760
I'm eager to try JetBrains not Blains brains it's not some sort of strange plane.

965
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:05,680
What is it fleet?

966
00:50:05,680 --> 00:50:06,680
Project fleet?

967
00:50:06,680 --> 00:50:12,880
I've been playing around with Zed I don't know I mean why do people like Emacs and Vim?

968
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:18,640
Because one it's a nice alpha nerd flex and two a lot of the first of all Emacs a lot

969
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:21,600
of the Emacs guys are just like BSD greybeards.

970
00:50:21,600 --> 00:50:24,960
There must be some core functionality though there must be right?

971
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:29,040
Well I've seen especially Emacs Emacs setups where you could just like like their email

972
00:50:29,040 --> 00:50:31,640
client is an Emacs right they just live in Emacs.

973
00:50:31,640 --> 00:50:38,800
So that yeah I don't know work with whatever makes you happy except TextMate 2 is better.

974
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:41,800
Magenta Eagle comes in with our last boost and it's a hot one.

975
00:50:41,800 --> 00:50:43,120
Coming in hot with the boost.

976
00:50:43,120 --> 00:50:50,840
We might go to admit that the best language is C and not C sharp and not that other dead

977
00:50:50,840 --> 00:50:53,600
language I think I think he's talking about objective C.

978
00:50:53,600 --> 00:50:54,600
What?

979
00:50:54,600 --> 00:50:55,600
Dead.

980
00:50:55,600 --> 00:50:57,680
Death is only the beginning.

981
00:50:57,680 --> 00:51:04,840
Coming in with the opinions also coming in with a 420 sat follow-up MIT is greater than

982
00:51:04,840 --> 00:51:05,840
GPL.

983
00:51:05,840 --> 00:51:06,840
You redeemed yourself sir.

984
00:51:06,840 --> 00:51:10,040
I thought you'd like that.

985
00:51:10,040 --> 00:51:15,520
No again like we used to cover dotnet a lot when I was I was doing a lot of the you know

986
00:51:15,520 --> 00:51:20,280
the exam Xamarin Samarian whatever the hell you call it stuff C sharp is really good right

987
00:51:20,280 --> 00:51:24,840
I would say it's Java but better although Java's copied a lot of their features too

988
00:51:24,840 --> 00:51:30,960
so it's really good objective C is better but it lost because.

989
00:51:30,960 --> 00:51:31,960
Apple decided.

990
00:51:31,960 --> 00:51:33,720
War crimes.

991
00:51:33,720 --> 00:51:38,960
Apple yes Apple does the king he doth decree that the brackets will be dropped.
