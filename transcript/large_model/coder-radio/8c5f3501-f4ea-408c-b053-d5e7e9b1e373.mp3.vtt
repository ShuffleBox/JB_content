This is KOTOR Radio, episode 444 for December 13th, 2021.

00:15.920 --> 00:19.600
Hello old friend and welcome back to Jupiter Broadcasting's weekly talk show, taking a

00:19.600 --> 00:25.960
pragmatic look at the art and the business of software development and the world of technology.

00:25.960 --> 00:29.980
My name is Chris and joining us perched right there next to his microphone like he was just

00:29.980 --> 00:36.140
last week, it's our host, Mr. Dominic. Hello, Mike. Hey, how are you? Oh, you really want to know?

00:36.140 --> 00:41.580
Sure. I want to know how you're doing. I'm okay. You know, busy, busy, busy. Been writing a lot of

00:41.580 --> 00:47.660
C sharp last week. I could tell because, you know, the tweets and the slacks have dropped down. So

00:47.660 --> 00:51.500
you must be pretty busy. I mean, you pop in from time to time, but yeah, a little bit of crunch

00:51.500 --> 00:56.460
time. So how are you? I sound like you. I sound like you're like you're ready to explode. Remember

00:56.460 --> 01:00.380
how we used to say, you know, I'm going to go postal? Remember how that used to be a phrase

01:00.380 --> 01:06.300
back in like the 90s? Maybe it was. I do remember. Yeah, that's how I feel. I mean, I don't know what

01:06.300 --> 01:10.700
I got to do to make sure the end of the year does not turn out to be such a damn grind fest every

01:10.700 --> 01:17.580
time. But I forgot just how bad end of your grind can get when you run your own business. And boy,

01:17.580 --> 01:22.300
am I getting it this year. Ground into the ground. Let me give you a taste of like my last four days.

01:22.300 --> 01:26.620
This is just a taste. You're not going to believe this, but it's all absolutely true. I'll start

01:26.620 --> 01:31.420
with the more believable. We've had some new projects in the works and I just killed one of

01:31.420 --> 01:37.740
them that we've been working on for a while and it's hard. You know how that goes, right? And on

01:37.740 --> 01:41.020
top of that, we're trying to figure out and coordinate moving the live time for Linux,

01:41.020 --> 01:45.580
unplugged moving the record time for Linux action news and tweaking some of the stuff there while

01:45.580 --> 01:50.700
also figuring all that stuff out. Also, like trying to figure out a new network wide membership

01:50.700 --> 01:56.140
program that involves different platform providers, legal contracts and like all this stuff,

01:57.100 --> 02:01.820
while also trying to keep the content rolling in the weekly shows. Of course, of course,

02:01.820 --> 02:04.620
while all this is going on, all of like the new show stuff I was trying to figure out,

02:04.620 --> 02:09.340
I couldn't sleep. So I hadn't slept for days. And of course, it's the fucking holidays. So ho,

02:09.340 --> 02:15.020
ho, ho. I got to like buy gifts and see family on the weekends all the time. That's been great.

02:15.020 --> 02:22.220
And legit this weekend, I lit my robe on fire. What do you mean you lit it on fire? I lit the

02:22.220 --> 02:27.900
coater on fire. Like actually on fire? Yeah, I got bad. So I do this family holiday shopping trip

02:27.900 --> 02:32.060
with my dad and we didn't do it last year because of COVID. But we did it this year and we got some

02:32.060 --> 02:37.660
whiskey and some cigars and I had a cigar. You know, I don't I don't smoke very often, but I had

02:37.660 --> 02:43.100
a cigar. So you had fire and an accelerant. Yes. It was a newer version of the rope because I gave

02:43.100 --> 02:47.260
my dad a robe and I had a robe. It had like a little bit of this like peach fuzz on it.

02:47.260 --> 02:53.260
So I'm sitting in my chair, manspreading, right? And leaning over, lighting my big gentleman's

02:53.260 --> 03:00.060
cigar on fire. And a piece of the gentleman's cigar falls down between my legs. Like so it's

03:00.060 --> 03:05.500
already scary because as other gentlemen out there know, when object begins to fall between

03:05.500 --> 03:11.180
your legs in your crotchular region, you instinctually like close your legs, right?

03:11.180 --> 03:11.820
Right.

03:11.820 --> 03:17.260
But it was a big chunk of fire. I kind of stopped myself. But now I don't know because I flinched.

03:17.260 --> 03:23.500
I don't know where this ember is. Right. But what I see is like when you turn on a propane heater

03:23.500 --> 03:28.380
and there's like this plume of fire that just goes across the entire heater. That's what my

03:28.380 --> 03:32.780
robe did because of the peach fuzz that was on there. So I'm sitting here and all of a sudden

03:32.780 --> 03:37.420
I just see this plume of fire that spreads out between my legs and my ass starts getting hot.

03:37.420 --> 03:42.220
Like, I'm not even kidding you. I'm like, I think I get it, but then my ass starts getting hotter

03:42.220 --> 03:46.140
and hotter. And I'm like, oh, crap. So I'm like, I'm taking the robe off. Right. Throw the cigar

03:46.140 --> 03:49.420
because I'm not even thinking anymore. So I just throw the cigar on the carpet like an idiot,

03:49.420 --> 03:53.980
although it was fine. I rush to take the robe off. I throw the robe on the floor and I start

03:53.980 --> 03:58.140
stomping on it. Right. Because I'm trying to put out the fire. And everybody's like,

03:58.140 --> 04:04.540
what the hell just happened? And I figure the robe must be completely destroyed. Right.

04:04.540 --> 04:10.300
I pick it up. I open it up. Look at the inside. I can see where the ember fell, but I think it

04:10.300 --> 04:14.940
was just the peach fuzz that lit on fire because the rest of the robe looks completely unscathed

04:14.940 --> 04:20.300
like a shield. Maybe Thor's hammer. Maybe that's a better analogy. The robe is like Thor's hammer.

04:20.300 --> 04:24.060
So then the wife, you know, I get home and I'm like, you're not going to believe what happened.

04:24.060 --> 04:27.820
And she says, what? And I'm like, go look at my robe. And, you know, she takes out the robe.

04:27.820 --> 04:32.060
I was like, what? And she's like this little burn mark here. I'm like, the whole thing was on fire

04:32.060 --> 04:36.860
for a second. No, she says, it's fine. How could it have been? It's not even singed.

04:38.860 --> 04:43.740
So, you know, the peach fuzz took one for me. That's amazing. And, uh, what is it? Antimaneum?

04:43.740 --> 04:47.900
What is that? That Wolverine's made out of? Adamantium. Yeah. Adamantium. I think that's

04:47.900 --> 04:52.780
what the robe was made out of. Cause it's just fine. It's unscathed. You know, that'll put hair

04:52.780 --> 04:59.020
on your chest though. I don't drink much, but I was out shopping and we went to dinner and it's

04:59.020 --> 05:04.460
been stressful. So I got myself a couple of tequilas. And now it's like, I'm having a three

05:04.460 --> 05:10.780
day hangover. It was Saturday. Today's Monday. And I still feel like, I honestly don't know how

05:10.780 --> 05:14.140
people drink these days and not feel like hell because for me, it does. It just makes me feel

05:14.140 --> 05:19.340
like hell. So that's been my last few days. Yeah. I don't touch tequila, that stuff, even smelling

05:19.340 --> 05:25.340
it. It's like, killing projects, burning ropes, moving shows around, which when you move time

05:25.340 --> 05:29.260
shows, right? You got to coordinate with the host. You know this, we got to coordinate with the

05:29.260 --> 05:33.420
editor. We got to make sure that we can do it at this particular time. You know what it's like

05:33.420 --> 05:37.900
when you're doing it for two shows at the same time and trying not to miss a beat. It's a

05:37.900 --> 05:43.500
nightmare. It's just been a nightmare. All of it's just been horrible. So I'm in a good mood today.

05:45.340 --> 05:52.060
So let's do some damn emails. Actually, Mike R writes in with some handy guides for developers

05:52.060 --> 05:56.540
that are looking to port over to M1 hardware. But he also wrote, and he said, you know what,

05:56.540 --> 06:00.540
I kind of agree with Chris's M1 Max experience where, yeah, it's fast. It's really nice.

06:01.820 --> 06:07.260
But I was oversold. I was oversold on the performance. And what it is, it's like every

06:07.260 --> 06:11.660
component you can tell is really performing at its peak. You know, the disk system, the memory

06:11.660 --> 06:17.820
bandwidth, the CPU, all of that is really great. But it's not like, oh my God, my life has changed.

06:17.820 --> 06:21.740
It's just, oh, finally it's as fast as it should have been. He said, so I've been making a guide

06:21.740 --> 06:25.100
for the last couple of weeks. It's not perfect. It still needs a lot of work, but I wanted to share

06:25.100 --> 06:29.660
it with anyone that would find it useful. It's the Apple Silicon guide on GitHub. He also has a VS

06:29.660 --> 06:33.580
code guide. I perused through this. And the reason why I wanted to bring it up in the show, and I'll

06:33.580 --> 06:41.340
put a link in the notes, is for somebody like me who's coming from Linux and isn't quite sure what

06:41.340 --> 06:45.020
all the little ins and outs are of getting macOS humming on this thing and what settings to tweak,

06:45.740 --> 06:49.580
this is a great, great guide for that. I mean, he does a fantastic technical breakdown of the

06:49.580 --> 06:53.980
architecture as well, but then he gets into the specifics of porting an application to Apple

06:53.980 --> 06:59.980
Silicon, debugging kernel extensions, working with the audio core, all this stuff that I really had

06:59.980 --> 07:03.740
no idea about because it's all a foreign language to me. And I found it to be pretty useful if

07:03.740 --> 07:08.140
you're coming from that angle. And I just wanted to say thank you to Mike R for sending that in.

07:09.020 --> 07:13.020
We'll have a link in the notes about that. So if you've got any M1 strugs, check it out.

07:13.020 --> 07:13.580
Cool.

07:13.580 --> 07:19.180
Yeah, not much to add, just kind of a FYI. So Vikram writes in with a feature request for the

07:19.180 --> 07:23.580
Coder Radio program. He says, you mentioned something in an episode once and I wanted to

07:23.580 --> 07:27.580
go look it up, but I wasn't sure what episode or where it was. So I looked in several show notes,

07:27.580 --> 07:32.220
couldn't find it. I thought maybe it was on Linux unplugged as well. I'm never really able to

07:32.220 --> 07:35.820
remember because I listened to both of them. I looked in the show notes and I did find that

07:35.820 --> 07:40.300
you talked about it in Coder Radio, but it's possible as mentioned elsewhere. So I thought,

07:40.300 --> 07:44.860
you know, it'd be really nice is a more advanced search. Something like elastic search for the

07:44.860 --> 07:50.940
show notes would be amazing for podcasts in general. Well, it just so happens the orange

07:50.940 --> 07:56.380
one wrote in about a rad show notes tool he's made for the whole network. The orange one says,

07:56.380 --> 08:01.260
Hey folks, a while back I helped Alex from self-hosted build a show notes site at

08:01.260 --> 08:07.420
notes.jupiterbroadcasting.com. We collaborated in the self-hosted discord and people seem to like

08:07.420 --> 08:12.460
it quite a bit. So I made a post on my website about how I put it together. And this is actually

08:12.460 --> 08:16.300
a really great read. He uses a lot of different technology that we talk about a lot on the show

08:16.860 --> 08:23.580
to build this. He says that he's recently been falling in love with Python. He was a Ruby guy,

08:23.580 --> 08:28.220
but Python has been getting his attention. So he thought he'd make a good little section on the

08:28.220 --> 08:31.580
show and I'll put a link in the show notes. So go check this out if you haven't yet. It's

08:31.580 --> 08:38.060
notes.jupiterbroadcasting.com. And from here you can search all the shows and it's not perfect

08:38.060 --> 08:43.820
because it's not doing transcription to, you know, voice to text, but it is a very good search that

08:43.820 --> 08:49.580
goes through the tags and the links and all that stuff. Another resource. I love it.

08:49.580 --> 08:54.140
notes.jupiterbroadcasting.com. At some point I'll talk to the orange one maybe and figure out,

08:54.140 --> 08:58.620
you know, get the story, how he built it. But we do have a link to his blog in there.

08:58.620 --> 09:04.460
And I think probably what stuck out to me is just kind of how well he broke it all down

09:04.460 --> 09:10.220
and how he renders the content, how he parallels some of the work, where he's hosting, obviously

09:10.220 --> 09:15.580
Linode, where it's at now, all that kind of stuff's in there. I don't know. Thank you. You know,

09:15.580 --> 09:21.740
I am running my arse off doing some of this stuff. Proper show notes search that searches all of the

09:21.740 --> 09:27.820
shows at once. Well, that's definitely something that I've wanted to do, but like it's not even on

09:27.820 --> 09:32.700
my list. There's so much going on. No, it's not an easy task either. No. When am I going to find

09:32.700 --> 09:36.140
time for that? Or when am I going to get funding for that either? All right, so let's take a look.

09:36.140 --> 09:42.940
This is written in Python. Excellent choice. Mm hmm. Mm hmm. Yeah. Let's see server.py. So what is

09:42.940 --> 09:50.780
it? Ooh, let's see. Flake. This is good radio right here. This is what happens when somebody

09:50.780 --> 09:54.780
clicks the wrong button and then loses their place. I'm liking it though. I like the live

09:54.780 --> 09:59.500
breakdown. Let's see. Template theme. GitHub workflows. How fancy. I thought I just saw

09:59.500 --> 10:03.340
server.py. Did I lose my mind? I mean, that's totally possible. If it was going to happen,

10:03.340 --> 10:11.260
it probably happened live. It was scraped.py. I just want to just hang on. There's there's he's

10:11.260 --> 10:18.540
using what is it? Ginger. Oh, and then of course he's also using MK docs to build out the pages.

10:18.540 --> 10:24.620
Okay, cool. So he's using flake like a good developer. Look at that. Mm hmm. He's got dev

10:24.620 --> 10:29.580
requirements and real requirements separated. And he's got it all running in a container

10:29.580 --> 10:35.500
environment using traffic as a proxy to bring the request in and out. And it's all provisioned with

10:35.500 --> 10:42.620
a mixer of ansible and terraform. How about this? All right. I know. Well, la de da, sir.

10:42.620 --> 10:48.220
I bet you if I hired a guy to do this job, he might not even do it this good, right? That's

10:48.220 --> 10:54.060
so crazy. Wow. He's even got GitHub workflows for like actually scraping. Wow. All right, cool.

10:54.060 --> 10:58.940
Got to keep that data current, right? Mm hmm. So thank you to the orange one for building that for

10:58.940 --> 11:07.580
us. lino.com slash coder. Go there to get $100 in 60 day credit on a new account. And you go there

11:07.580 --> 11:12.220
to support the show. Linode is the developers cloud with 11 data centers worldwide. They have

11:12.220 --> 11:17.420
something near you or near a customer. And they've been hard at work for 18 years creating the best

11:17.420 --> 11:21.580
experience for running applications on Linux. If you're the type likes to build it up from the

11:21.580 --> 11:25.740
ground yourself, or if you prefer one click deployments or integrating in with an existing

11:25.740 --> 11:31.020
infrastructure management tool set, Linode has excellent options for you. And the performance

11:31.020 --> 11:37.740
is mind blowing. I simply wouldn't host all of JB's stuff there, right? I want the audience to

11:37.740 --> 11:43.420
have a good experience. I mean, they have the best customer support 24 7365. They have a beautiful

11:43.420 --> 11:48.860
dashboard, tons of documentation, a brilliant community. But it's performance, right? That's

11:48.860 --> 11:53.180
the number one thing for me. And they're just super fast. And they've been rolling out screaming

11:53.180 --> 11:59.100
new MVME based storage, PCIe MVME storage, super flexible S3 compatible object storage on the

11:59.100 --> 12:03.740
backend. We use that all the time. I mean, this dashboard, I mentioned it because it brings these

12:03.740 --> 12:08.140
things together. You hear things like object storage, block storage, you know, and it's like,

12:08.140 --> 12:11.260
Okay, what does that mean? Well, you go into the dashboard, you'll figure it out. And you'll start

12:11.260 --> 12:15.580
using enterprise grade tools in minutes. If you've been using Linode for anything longer than five

12:15.580 --> 12:20.460
minutes, you realize it's pretty special. And as you start to get in more invested, like you start

12:20.460 --> 12:24.860
to learn the tooling around it, like the API, and the command line tool and that kind of stuff that

12:24.860 --> 12:30.700
just makes your use of Linode even more efficient. So from the best customer support, super fast

12:30.700 --> 12:35.420
rigs and super fast networking, and a Linux culture that runs deep, you know, they're clicking my

12:35.420 --> 12:41.740
buttons. Maybe they'll tap your buttons too. I'm not sure where I'm going with that. There's a lot

12:41.740 --> 12:45.340
of reasons though to choose Linode. And I think you should check it out. And $100. In my opinion,

12:45.340 --> 12:50.700
it puts it over the top. So go get that $100 in credit and support the show. linode.com slash

12:50.700 --> 13:01.020
coder. So did you hear about this log for shell bug? It's a bug in log4j. And it's stupid simple

13:01.020 --> 13:07.340
to exploit it. You could change your web browser's user agent early on, you could just simply rename

13:07.340 --> 13:12.460
your iPhone with this string in there. And you could actually exploit the flaw in Apple's iCloud.

13:12.460 --> 13:17.340
What it is, is this log4j application parses logs. And when it encounters a string,

13:17.340 --> 13:21.100
because you're often capturing the commands that your users are passing by, when it captures a

13:21.100 --> 13:26.300
string, you can make a request to the JNDI engine, which is this, I don't really know it very well,

13:26.300 --> 13:30.860
but it's a mechanism that will let you like connect to an LDAP database or something like that.

13:30.860 --> 13:36.220
And you can send a URL to it. So it could also go out to like an external server. And that's where

13:36.220 --> 13:40.860
you can have it go out, get a payload and then come back and execute it. And you can actually

13:40.860 --> 13:44.220
have it execute something like on the command line or something like that, depending on how you

13:44.220 --> 13:49.500
exploit this thing. There's a patch out, of course, because they went public with it last week.

13:50.220 --> 13:57.340
But even before the proof of exploit code was public, eight days, in fact, before the proof of

13:57.340 --> 14:01.820
exploit code was public, there were attackers taking advantage. They knew ahead of time.

14:01.820 --> 14:07.580
Oh, yeah. You know, and it started with crypto miners, of course, actually got to go make a

14:07.580 --> 14:14.940
quick buck on a coin, I guess. I don't know. Now it's moved up to like professional attackers

14:14.940 --> 14:20.620
and researchers using this vulnerability and log for J to execute vulnerability scan behind

14:20.620 --> 14:24.460
firewalls and find vulnerabilities inside people's internal networks and whatnot.

14:24.460 --> 14:27.980
I heard you like vulnerabilities. So I put some vulnerabilities behind your firewalls

14:27.980 --> 14:34.620
with vulnerabilities in your vulnerabilities. What's so wild about this is it was discovered

14:34.620 --> 14:39.820
as a Minecraft flaw because the users could actually put like the execution commands in

14:39.820 --> 14:43.980
a Minecraft command. The server would log the command and then they could get it to execute

14:43.980 --> 14:48.060
the code and they could exploit the Minecraft server. That's I think how this actually first

14:48.060 --> 14:53.980
became discovered. I just want to say we have hit the Java gold standard here. A bug that hits

14:53.980 --> 15:00.300
enterprise Java discovered via Minecraft. One of the more famous, you know, client side Java

15:00.300 --> 15:05.100
applications out there. We did a complete breakdown and analysis in Linux Action News.

15:05.100 --> 15:08.700
I should mention that. So if you want to know all the details, LinuxActionNews.com.

15:09.260 --> 15:14.860
But the proof of concept code, that's the thing that gets me comes out on the 9th. Eight days

15:14.860 --> 15:18.860
before that, you start seeing people exploit this. And I want to know how the hell that happens.

15:19.660 --> 15:25.420
This is bad enough because log for J is one of those little bits of pieces way down the stack

15:25.420 --> 15:28.300
that you don't even think about when you're thinking about securing your infrastructure,

15:28.300 --> 15:33.020
right? Because this thing's just handling your logging. Are you really thinking about remote code

15:33.020 --> 15:38.300
execution with your logs? And don't you actually want to log the commands that the users were

15:38.300 --> 15:41.580
executing? So you know how to troubleshoot, you know what they were doing. Like you actually need

15:41.580 --> 15:47.500
that data. It's such a catch 22. There's just, I feel like there's no solution to this kind of

15:47.500 --> 15:51.740
stuff because we have so much of this type of software deployed throughout all of our

15:51.740 --> 15:55.580
infrastructures. You know, the more dependencies and as more complicated your stack becomes,

15:55.580 --> 16:00.380
just the wider the surface area, right? For you to get hit with one of these. So,

16:00.380 --> 16:05.020
I mean, there's been some high profile MPM vulnerabilities that you use an MPM package.

16:05.020 --> 16:08.860
And MPM, we haven't covered much, but yeah, MPM has been having a real hard time.

16:08.860 --> 16:12.140
It's been bad. This is an issue that's like pervasive.

16:12.140 --> 16:15.100
Well, this is an issue with like all modern software development, because everybody's

16:15.100 --> 16:18.940
basically Lego-ing a bunch of packages together, right? It could happen to anybody. I mean,

16:18.940 --> 16:23.900
RubyGems has had some in the past, theoretically PIP code, right? I think I'm sure PIP has.

16:23.900 --> 16:27.340
I just don't know about it, but this is the downside.

16:27.340 --> 16:33.500
Vulnerability goes back to like 2006. And it just really underscores no software infrastructure can

16:33.500 --> 16:39.260
remain static. You always have to plan to update it down the road. Even if the core application

16:39.260 --> 16:44.060
doesn't get updated, you have to figure out a way to build an update to underlying OS and libraries.

16:45.420 --> 16:46.700
You have to be able to build for that.

16:46.700 --> 16:49.660
And that is not always as easy as you think it could be.

16:49.660 --> 16:54.060
I would imagine. You build something, and then you update these libraries and you change things.

16:54.060 --> 16:57.900
It's something that we don't talk a lot about. But when you change some of this stuff for security

16:57.900 --> 17:02.140
purposes, it sometimes changes how long a function takes to execute.

17:03.180 --> 17:05.740
And that can mess with a lot of stuff. Just something like that.

17:05.740 --> 17:08.780
Yeah, I have actually a real-world example from a few years ago when,

17:08.780 --> 17:11.580
remember the Heartbleed OpenSSL stuff?

17:11.580 --> 17:12.220
Oh yeah.

17:12.220 --> 17:18.060
They pulled the Ruby Gem that worked with SSL 1, and you had to use a newer version.

17:18.060 --> 17:22.140
Fine. But that newer version wouldn't work with older versions of Rails.

17:22.140 --> 17:23.180
Oh yeah.

17:23.180 --> 17:27.340
So now, to get a security update, you're upgrading your entire application

17:27.340 --> 17:31.340
to whatever the new version of Rails is. And depending on how far back you were,

17:31.340 --> 17:35.740
the level of change we're making became more and more significant.

17:36.300 --> 17:41.340
That kind of stuff, sometimes you find out about it ahead of time, and sometimes it's stuff that

17:41.340 --> 17:45.820
is sort of so low on the list that nobody really makes a big noise about making an update like

17:45.820 --> 17:49.340
that, and it bites you, and you don't even really know where in the stack it happened.

17:49.340 --> 17:53.020
It's such a hard problem. But there is a patch out there.

17:53.020 --> 17:59.100
Any version of JVM released after 2019 doesn't have the vulnerability.

17:59.100 --> 18:03.420
Of course, the problem is, there's a lot of deployments of older JVM out there.

18:04.540 --> 18:05.980
Even Steam, you know?

18:05.980 --> 18:06.300
Yep.

18:06.300 --> 18:12.220
Steam and iCloud. Even these huge groups that, a big part of their business is their online service,

18:12.220 --> 18:16.780
they end up on old versions of JVM. And anybody who's ever worked in a large enterprise or medium

18:16.780 --> 18:21.420
business has seen this happen. Good luck. I've been hearing from a lot of you out there that

18:21.420 --> 18:25.500
have been scrambling to patch. I don't miss that hustle. Good luck to you.

18:28.540 --> 18:32.380
I'm going to do an ad for Linux Action News, and I'm going to play a clip right here about the

18:32.380 --> 18:40.460
funding model. So a big part of this is Log4j has not been getting properly funded at all.

18:40.460 --> 18:45.660
For the last decade, it's like two dudes working on it by themselves. And it's become this key

18:45.660 --> 18:50.140
piece of infrastructure for all these billion dollar companies. And they're like, we'll pay us.

18:50.140 --> 18:53.100
And it's not that simple. That's what this clip addresses.

18:53.100 --> 18:59.100
Google and Amazon, you know, they're not going to go and log4j's Patreon and become a Patreon

18:59.100 --> 19:03.020
supporter in one of their tiers, right? That's not how these massive companies work.

19:03.020 --> 19:09.980
That's not how these massive companies work. They live in the land of invoices, POs, and ACH

19:09.980 --> 19:16.460
payments, not PayPal payments, not Patreon payments, not GitHub sponsors. That's just

19:16.460 --> 19:20.780
not what these companies do. They have finance departments. They don't have individuals that

19:20.780 --> 19:27.020
have PayPal accounts that go support some developer. So we need a way that's not a big

19:27.020 --> 19:35.420
foundation or some law firm, but some platform that lets developers get paid in the language,

19:35.420 --> 19:39.820
in the means that these companies want to do it. And I know this sounds odd, but I can tell you

19:39.820 --> 19:44.380
from being on this end, there has been multiple situations where we're like, we don't have a way

19:44.380 --> 19:49.100
to pay this guy because he doesn't want to work with PayPal or there's this restriction because

19:49.100 --> 19:54.140
of the country he's in. And it's so much more complicated than just send them a tip. And

19:54.140 --> 19:58.300
it gets even more complicated when you have these companies with policies and procedures,

19:58.300 --> 20:01.660
and they're used to interfacing with other businesses, not individuals.

20:02.380 --> 20:05.660
It's a really hard problem to solve. LinuxActionNews.com.

20:08.380 --> 20:11.820
I do have a few things on our list that have been sent in by the audience,

20:11.820 --> 20:19.260
and one that I know you tagged me with earlier in the week that just demonstrated the absolute

20:19.260 --> 20:25.020
control Apple has over their app store. It came out that Microsoft has quietly told Apple it

20:25.020 --> 20:31.340
was willing to turn big Xbox exclusive games into dedicated iPhone apps. In other words,

20:31.340 --> 20:40.060
Microsoft offered to bring AAA Xbox exclusives to the iPhone if it meant Apple would ease up

20:40.060 --> 20:45.500
on their streaming policy for Xbox's new gaming stream, Xbox Cloud Gaming or XCloud.

20:45.500 --> 20:51.100
And Apple didn't budge. And it's weird because these emails came out and it's like Microsoft

20:51.100 --> 20:56.300
trying to wheel and deal here with Apple. And you can, I mean, can you imagine taking something

20:56.300 --> 21:00.780
that is an exclusive video game like Halo or something to your platform and being willing

21:00.780 --> 21:04.380
to make an iPhone app out of it just to get Apple to crack the door a little bit?

21:05.340 --> 21:09.260
Apple's answer was, um, no.

21:09.900 --> 21:13.260
Yeah, maybe they figured this is like a hundred year economy for them or something.

21:13.260 --> 21:18.460
They fight for this thing. Like it's going to be the way they make money for the next hundred years.

21:18.460 --> 21:23.020
Yeah, I think they correctly understand that. I mean, listen to the show from a few weeks ago.

21:23.660 --> 21:30.060
Being a middleman is a big business right now in the digital economy. And as Judge,

21:30.060 --> 21:35.740
I forgot her last name, Judge, um, oh, right. Well, the judge in the Apple epic cake will tell you

21:36.300 --> 21:41.260
the gamers are spending the most money here. So let's go ahead and be in the middle of that

21:41.260 --> 21:47.900
transaction. So then Microsoft in March of last year came with like a second compromise because

21:47.900 --> 21:51.980
remember Apple's response was you can't stream, but you could submit those thousand games as

21:51.980 --> 21:56.940
individual apps to the store. So Microsoft's like first, how about we give you a couple exclusive

21:56.940 --> 22:01.100
and then you let us stream that didn't work. Second approach. Second set of compromises is

22:01.100 --> 22:05.900
okay. Microsoft will propose that we will create those hundreds or thousands of individual apps,

22:05.900 --> 22:10.220
and we will submit them to the app store. But you let us make those essentially like

22:10.220 --> 22:15.500
shortcuts. So we don't have to stuff the whole cloud gaming in one little app, the whole

22:15.500 --> 22:19.980
infrastructure. They argued that this essentially how watch OS apps work already. It would just be

22:19.980 --> 22:24.620
something they did on the iPhone. They said that they have the tech in there. They could do it.

22:24.620 --> 22:28.460
Each app would be around 150 megabytes. They'd have like a runtime and they get you connected

22:28.460 --> 22:32.540
to the cloud service. It'd be a legitimate app. It'd just be an app that gets you up and connected

22:32.540 --> 22:36.860
to that specific game. And this part's embarrassing too, because they say things like that's fun.

22:36.860 --> 22:40.620
There's a typo in here. Listen to this. He says, quote, we're excited that we are close to finding

22:40.620 --> 22:47.180
a solve to bring the Xbox game pass library to iOS. We wanted to follow up on details you requested.

22:47.180 --> 22:51.580
Were they close? Wait, they weren't. No. And you know, they even said, we think we could get those

22:51.580 --> 22:55.580
apps down to 30 megabytes in size. So they download real small. That'd be easy for you guys

22:55.580 --> 23:01.660
to review and approve and nothing. Apple's like, but, but, but you missed the point. That's not

23:01.660 --> 23:07.420
our problem. It's so transparent that it's almost, I almost feel icky saying it because it's like,

23:07.420 --> 23:13.420
no, that's crazy. And of course, in-app purchases became a big sticking spot. That was just an area

23:13.420 --> 23:17.820
Apple was unwilling to compromise on no matter how they came to do this. Yeah. And we should know,

23:17.820 --> 23:21.660
we don't have it in the notice. Apple just won an injunction against the order saying they had to

23:21.660 --> 23:30.060
allow alternative payment methods and apps. It's good to be the king. Yeah. I forgot who wrote it.

23:30.060 --> 23:36.140
I think it was a, was it Jeff Atwood? I think so. Way back when about one of what now seems like a

23:36.140 --> 23:41.580
super quaint controversy regarding the app store. I could just look it up. The article was entitled

23:41.580 --> 23:46.940
at the pleasure of the king or something. It seems worse today than it did then. That's the thing.

23:46.940 --> 23:51.580
I think what has been striking me about all this serving real time, serving at the pleasure of the

23:51.580 --> 23:58.060
king. That's what it was. Yeah. As this conversation has evolved on the show, I've realized it's worse

23:58.060 --> 24:03.580
than I think we ever thought it was going to be in a lot of ways. In so many ways, we were originally

24:03.580 --> 24:09.420
focused on things like getting free software in the app store or sideloading. And now it's really,

24:09.420 --> 24:14.620
you're right. It's about this middle management control that they can extort over developers and

24:14.620 --> 24:21.260
over end users. And Apple has made it clear. They very much see the iPhone as an appliance type

24:21.260 --> 24:26.460
console device with a curated console like experience. It's not a personal computer. It's a

24:26.460 --> 24:32.140
console. They also see apps not as really their own programs, but as extensions of iOS. Yeah. At

24:32.140 --> 24:35.980
first I was resistant to that when I'm thinking, but the more I hear and the more I kind of just

24:35.980 --> 24:42.540
like, I've been following this. I mean, the level of control here is pretty substantial, perhaps.

24:42.540 --> 24:47.500
Do you think they view it the way they do the way they view apps? Do you think they view them as,

24:47.500 --> 24:51.500
you know, developers should be grateful that Apple's building this and that they're just

24:51.500 --> 24:55.500
extensions of the OS? Do you think they view it that way because they create the app?

24:55.500 --> 24:57.820
Well, I think they basically said that in the courtroom.

24:57.820 --> 24:59.980
Okay. Did they? Okay. Yeah. I kind of recall that.

24:59.980 --> 25:02.620
They didn't use the word grateful, but they said, you know, we invest all of this. We

25:02.620 --> 25:06.300
built the platform. We need to, I mean, Tim Cook just said it outright. He dropped, he didn't even

25:06.300 --> 25:09.900
like, he dropped the whole veneer of security. He's like, we need to recoup our investment,

25:10.620 --> 25:13.020
which is laughable because they definitely have.

25:13.020 --> 25:19.900
I mean, I'm not even thinking app store. I'm thinking like iOS core APIs, things like ML APIs

25:19.900 --> 25:26.220
and audio and video APIs will let you access the camera. I wonder if they view themselves as well.

25:26.220 --> 25:27.980
We've done most of the hard work.

25:27.980 --> 25:31.500
I think they think both, right? The hardware, the APIs, the SDKs.

25:31.500 --> 25:32.300
Right. Of course.

25:32.300 --> 25:36.860
But Apple has always been like this, my way or the highway. I think the difference is nobody

25:36.860 --> 25:43.420
could have foreseen or nobody did foresee how substantial to their business being a middleman,

25:43.420 --> 25:46.380
right? Being, you know, that app store fee was going to be.

25:46.380 --> 25:47.100
Yeah.

25:47.100 --> 25:51.980
And they are a publicly traded corporation. I know people are going to write in and say,

25:51.980 --> 25:56.940
it's not true, but basically, you know, Tim Cook wants up until the right every quarter.

25:56.940 --> 26:02.140
I mean, if you told me I can make 30% of somebody else's business just by like being there,

26:02.940 --> 26:04.060
I would be happy.

26:04.060 --> 26:07.820
You know, the thing is, is Microsoft is not necessarily the customer you want to piss off

26:07.820 --> 26:14.540
because they have a lot of influence with regulators now. Like they played that game.

26:14.540 --> 26:18.780
They have figured out how to influence. I mean, look at look at the way they got that

26:18.780 --> 26:22.140
Pentagon project or the CIA. It is whatever it was. I can't remember. God,

26:22.140 --> 26:24.860
this is not my day for recollection. I shouldn't take in my B12.

26:24.860 --> 26:30.700
Pentagon, CIA, MI6, listen, Men in Black. That is the contract I want.

26:30.700 --> 26:36.060
You don't take a deal like that away from Amazon without being super savvy in Washington.

26:36.620 --> 26:40.620
And so I'm just saying, like, you go around and you do this. You do this kind of stuff.

26:40.620 --> 26:43.500
You know, they're screwing with Microsoft's moneymaker.

26:43.500 --> 26:47.900
Microsoft wants to turn this Xbox cloud streaming thing into a whole thing that can reach a whole

26:47.900 --> 26:52.540
new generation of users that never even buy Xbox hardware. And Apple is a very key part

26:52.540 --> 26:57.100
of that strategy. And they're with Microsoft's money here. And the reality is they're being

26:57.100 --> 27:01.260
unreasonable and they're stringing them along, getting their people to waste times on proposals

27:01.260 --> 27:05.420
and looking at trying to contain their entire streaming platform in a single app and doing all

27:05.420 --> 27:10.140
this kind of bull that Microsoft's going to get pissed about. And it's the exact kind of thing

27:10.140 --> 27:14.620
that they're going to sit down with some regulator and say, look at this. And it's going to end up

27:14.620 --> 27:19.980
biting them in the ass. And I know you know that and they must know that. So then it leads me to

27:19.980 --> 27:25.900
conclude that the end goal, whatever the end goal is of the App Store, must be one of the highest

27:25.900 --> 27:32.780
priorities of the organization because they are willing to bring federal regulation down upon them

27:32.780 --> 27:37.340
to save what they got. I mean, it's the only place where their growth is is not as limited,

27:37.340 --> 27:41.260
right? Like one of the problems in the last quarterly report that they were doing the

27:41.260 --> 27:47.020
guidance for was that they've basically saturated the possible iPhone market, right? It's now

27:47.020 --> 27:52.060
people upgrading. I mean, sure, people die and people are born or whatever, but it's the growth

27:52.060 --> 27:58.620
area. In fairness, though, this whole idea of streaming game services, I'm going to put on

27:58.620 --> 28:03.340
my tinfoil hat. I'm pretty sure that's the future of game development. And it's going to suck for

28:03.340 --> 28:08.060
game developers, let you know, because again, it's going to be another like almost like sharecropping

28:08.060 --> 28:14.540
deal where you're getting paid X cents, whatever it is per, you know, active minute. Very much like

28:14.540 --> 28:18.700
if you've ever known authors, how Kindle Unlimited works, it seems like a good deal. It's really not.

28:18.700 --> 28:22.060
It's not unless you're like JK Rowling, right? Unless you're one of our Stephen King and then

28:22.060 --> 28:27.980
sure, because you have so many people reading it. But I have GeForce now and I do like that I can

28:27.980 --> 28:33.340
buy the game in steam often and play it on GeForce now. But what ends up actually kind of being the

28:33.340 --> 28:40.460
nice thing about it as time goes on is they're upgrading the streaming service to RTX 3080 cards

28:40.460 --> 28:45.100
with, you know, all their fancy features. I can't even buy one of those right now. Like I'd have to

28:45.100 --> 28:49.980
pay this service for two or three years before it would equal the cost of a single graphics card.

28:49.980 --> 28:53.740
And by that time, a whole new generation of graphics cards are on the market. And when you

28:53.740 --> 28:57.180
look at the part shortages and you look at the cost of these things and you look at the fact that

28:57.180 --> 29:03.100
my purchasing power is less with inflation going crazy, it just seems almost more practical to just

29:03.100 --> 29:07.100
have a game streaming service now because they'll just keep upgrading the GPUs because they're

29:07.100 --> 29:13.020
fricking Nvidia. You know, I actually really have had pretty good success, even unlimited

29:13.020 --> 29:17.340
connectivity. I know everybody thinks it's impossible, but I've done it once on LTE

29:18.300 --> 29:21.180
and I've done it a lot on Starling and it's worked just fine.

29:21.820 --> 29:25.580
Real time update. I just was able, speaking of gaming, to get an Xbox X.

29:25.580 --> 29:30.620
Oh, really? Yes. My dad just got an S. I played the new Halo for the first time this weekend.

29:30.620 --> 29:36.140
It's good. I have an S, but it's going to go in another room because I need my digital content

29:36.140 --> 29:41.980
everywhere. I got to say, games are looking good on that thing. And Halo, you know, full

29:41.980 --> 29:47.020
on surround sound support. So like Bullets or Wiz and Pass behind my head. And it was fun.

29:47.020 --> 29:51.420
I haven't played a good Xbox game in these current generations. And I know Halo is not,

29:51.420 --> 29:55.020
you know, pushing the graphics all the way to the ultimate, but no, I really like it.

29:55.020 --> 29:58.220
So what made you, because I know you're a Switch guy too, but are you just kind of like me kind

29:58.220 --> 30:02.700
of getting done with the games on Switch right now? Yeah. I mean, I've wanted one for a while

30:02.700 --> 30:06.460
and it's just, it's more, I got an email from Walmart because I have that weird Walmart.

30:07.180 --> 30:11.100
Alert thing? No, they're Prime. I don't know what they call it.

30:11.100 --> 30:16.780
Oh yeah. So they do a thing now where they periodically get them in PS5s.

30:16.780 --> 30:21.580
And if you're part of their, whatever Walmart Prime is, you get first dibs.

30:21.580 --> 30:25.980
Uh-huh. So I just went in and cause I do it on the app, right? So you're logged in,

30:26.540 --> 30:31.180
you just like your information saved. Wham bam. There's your Xbox.

30:31.180 --> 30:34.540
Oh, I probably shouldn't know this. Now it's not coming until January.

30:34.540 --> 30:36.620
Is there a particular game you're looking forward to?

30:36.620 --> 30:42.860
Probably Halo. I mean, so I haven't done serious gaming in a long time. I just got back into it.

30:42.860 --> 30:46.940
I just finished Assassin's Creed Origins. So I think I'm going to pick up Odyssey and then

30:46.940 --> 30:50.380
Valhalla. Yeah. It's going to look good. Oh, I think so.

30:50.380 --> 30:55.260
I just bought the new Metroid Dread on Switch. I have a two, I haven't played it yet.

30:55.980 --> 30:57.340
It's hard. Is it?

30:57.980 --> 31:03.500
A lot of it is about speed and getting through the map as fast as possible. Now,

31:03.500 --> 31:08.540
the thing that I love about it being an old fart is that it's a 2D side-scrolling like

31:08.540 --> 31:10.220
the original Metroids. Nice.

31:10.220 --> 31:14.300
Yeah. I really like that. And only of course they bring in moments that are 3D cause they're using

31:14.300 --> 31:17.500
a 3D rendering engine to actually do it. Like they do with the Mario games now.

31:17.500 --> 31:21.020
Pretty good game so far. I have not gotten very far, but that's a great example of like,

31:21.660 --> 31:27.820
I aspire to be gamer. I aspire to be like somebody who can just switch his brain off

31:27.820 --> 31:33.420
and sit down and play for a couple of hours. And it's a rare game that I can actually do that with

31:33.420 --> 31:37.580
and Breath of the Wild was probably the best at it because it's so engrossing.

31:37.580 --> 31:41.660
You know, so that's a special treat for me when a game can hold my attention and I'm not thinking

31:41.660 --> 31:46.540
about work. It's like a special escape. So I hope, I hope the metaverse is real.

31:46.540 --> 31:53.500
I hope VR takes off because psychologically I think it'd be great for me. If I could go upstairs

31:53.500 --> 32:00.060
after this show and put on a VR headset and be at the beach, I think that'd actually be pretty good

32:00.060 --> 32:05.580
for my mental state. That's my one VR experience that I've really truly had by myself where I

32:05.580 --> 32:11.660
wasn't like at a tech demo or with a group of friends. I have an Oculus like DK1 or whatever

32:11.660 --> 32:16.540
they were. Nice. I was here in the studio one night all by myself and I hooked it up to the

32:16.540 --> 32:21.980
studio machine and launched one of their demos. And it was a raft in the middle of the ocean

32:22.540 --> 32:27.500
with a little cabin on this wood raft. And I could climb up the ladder and sit on top. There's a

32:27.500 --> 32:32.220
chair up there. And I just sat there on this raft in the middle of the ocean and it had headphones

32:32.220 --> 32:37.900
and all that kind of stuff and just chilled the hell out for like 15 minutes. And I actually felt

32:37.900 --> 32:42.860
like I was there. And it was like, whoa. It's probably what like people who love meditation

32:42.860 --> 32:46.460
and really feel like they get something out of it probably was as close to that as I get.

32:47.260 --> 32:51.820
I just found it to be great. So I'm all for it. The rumors are that Apple's building one. I've

32:51.820 --> 32:57.660
thought about getting the Quest. So if anybody out there uses VR for like chill out time and has

32:57.660 --> 33:01.900
experience with ways of doing that, I'd kind of like to know. I know it's a weird angle, but

33:01.900 --> 33:09.260
coder.show.contact. Let me know. Get that Quest. You know, before we move off Apple completely,

33:09.260 --> 33:15.420
this was sent into the show too. You remember when we were talking about the child nudity detection

33:15.420 --> 33:19.580
stuff, the CSAM scanning that they were going to do on the iPhone? Yeah, the CSAM scanning. Yeah.

33:19.580 --> 33:24.300
So this is interesting. So Apple's walked that back. But with iOS 15.2, which is rolling out,

33:24.300 --> 33:30.460
they are including the nude image detection in kid iMessage. If you've got an iCloud family and

33:30.460 --> 33:35.020
you've got people on there that are children, like my kids are set up, then their iPhones,

33:35.020 --> 33:39.660
iPads or Macs or whatever will analyze incoming and outgoing messages received and sent through

33:39.660 --> 33:46.140
the Messages app to detect nudity. If the system finds a nude image, the picture will appear

33:46.140 --> 33:51.580
blurred and the child will be warned before viewing it. If the children attempt to send a nude image,

33:51.580 --> 33:57.180
they'll also be warned. In both instances, the child will have the ability to contact a parent

33:57.180 --> 34:01.820
through the Messages app about the situation. But now this has changed from how it was before.

34:02.460 --> 34:08.460
Parents will not automatically receive a notification. But the wider CSAM scanning

34:08.460 --> 34:13.980
of your iCloud photo database is not being rolled out at this time. What do you think? I guess this

34:13.980 --> 34:18.460
kind of seems like a pretty sensible compromise. How do you feel as a parent though about the

34:18.460 --> 34:23.020
automatic notification no longer happening? That was actually the one feature I actually liked.

34:23.740 --> 34:27.580
Yeah. I mean, so we're going to have hilarious Reddit posts of it blurring out like Big Bird

34:27.580 --> 34:31.260
and stuff, right? Messing up and think, you know. Totally. It's going to be a meme.

34:31.260 --> 34:34.540
It's going to be a meme. I don't know. This is a hard problem, right? You, you,

34:35.180 --> 34:40.220
you know, on some level, I mean, we both have kids. You definitely don't want your kids doing

34:40.220 --> 34:43.660
stupid things that are going to possibly follow them for a long time.

34:43.660 --> 34:48.540
And every iPad you give a kid comes with messages. Yep. But it's, it's also,

34:49.500 --> 34:57.660
I would say almost impossible to have 100% surveillance of your child. So I don't know.

34:57.660 --> 35:05.500
I don't like this very much. I mean, I don't, I also don't like a lot of things very much when

35:05.500 --> 35:14.300
it comes to like kids and technology. I sort of, I don't necessarily agree. Okay. Well,

35:14.300 --> 35:19.260
we'll walk it back a little bit, right? I, I'm not convinced that like Kappa doesn't go far enough,

35:20.300 --> 35:27.660
right? It's just like too easy to have kids on these social apps, even though they're not supposed

35:27.660 --> 35:36.300
to. Oh man. Tiktok, I swear is going after my younger kids. Like it's wild. I know. And it's,

35:36.300 --> 35:42.780
it's a constant near daily battle. It's strange. And like YouTube is just like dying. Like I showed

35:42.780 --> 35:47.580
my kid one video on YouTube and I could see his eyes like he was getting sucked into the black

35:47.580 --> 35:52.300
hole. And I was like, now you're done. That's it. Well, first of all, it's 16 by nine and it's

35:52.300 --> 35:58.940
longer than 24 seconds. So come on. This goes into the next question. What age should your

35:58.940 --> 36:03.100
kids have these devices? Right? Yeah. And so I know we're supposed to be talking about Apple,

36:03.100 --> 36:08.140
but I sort of think it's kind of a parenting problem. I mean, your kid can't send stupid

36:08.140 --> 36:13.180
iMessages if he or she doesn't have iMessage. True. Here's the flip side. Being who I am,

36:13.180 --> 36:17.660
I pretty much had, you know, my kids had a Linux laptop and a tablet before they probably should

36:17.660 --> 36:22.860
have. Well, yeah, my kids are so much more technically literate than pretty much everyone

36:22.860 --> 36:28.060
else in their peer group, everyone else. And like some of their friends, they're horrible at using

36:28.060 --> 36:32.220
the iPad. They're horrible at video games and they don't know how to use controls. Like, and now

36:32.220 --> 36:35.980
they're getting at an age, you know, 12, 13, where like it's starting to become common that their

36:35.980 --> 36:40.380
friends want to play video games and know how to use technology and stuff like that. And the friends

36:40.380 --> 36:45.420
in their social groups who have had really strict parenting on this, they don't know how to use

36:45.420 --> 36:50.460
strict parenting on this. They really seem like they're behind all the other children in a very

36:50.460 --> 36:57.020
important area. My son did not have his own iPad for a while until he went to kindergarten. And

36:57.020 --> 37:03.340
while there are other options, other devices one could buy like a Chromebook, the best way for him

37:03.340 --> 37:09.340
to do all of his homework is on the iPad, which is mind bending to me. Yeah. My kids get issued

37:09.340 --> 37:13.580
a Chromebook from their school. They can do some of it on their iPad, but for their school, it's

37:13.580 --> 37:17.420
the iPad or it's the Chromebook. Even the kindergartners have them. I guess technically

37:17.420 --> 37:21.740
I could whip up, open a Chrome tab, but then he's like on my computer and I feel like he's more

37:21.740 --> 37:26.940
likely to damage it. So it was just easier to get him a mini. But see, I see what you're saying about

37:26.940 --> 37:30.460
the parents who are super strict, like putting their kids behind him. My son like has a switch,

37:30.460 --> 37:34.620
right? He knows how to, he knows how to hook up the switch doc. He beat me at Mario the other day.

37:36.220 --> 37:40.220
It's a good proud moment. Also a hard moment. Very hard for me.

37:40.220 --> 37:46.140
Yeah, but it is addictive. I mean, telling him it's time to get off the Nintendo is like,

37:46.140 --> 37:50.380
it's like someone who's got a problem. It's not, I mean, he's a lot better than he used to be,

37:50.380 --> 37:55.420
but it's, I know one of my kids is having a harder time with that. The other two seem to have found

37:55.420 --> 38:00.780
a pretty healthy natural balance, but one of my kids got three total is definitely struggling.

38:00.780 --> 38:08.540
And my hope is to help guide them to learn how to manage this. Oh, being around people, you know,

38:08.540 --> 38:13.180
who have more kids and things like that. I now definitely get the damage that these social apps

38:13.180 --> 38:18.300
are doing in particular to like teenagers, right? I guess I'm hoping I can help them navigate it and

38:18.300 --> 38:23.260
learn to manage it and when to turn it off and when to turn it on. But I mean, what do I know?

38:23.260 --> 38:27.260
You know, this is the first time I've ever done this. And you and I are on Twitter all the time.

38:27.260 --> 38:32.620
So I mean, come on, I kind of wish I could go like live on some big piece of land somewhere,

38:32.620 --> 38:38.220
like in Montana and just not have them exposed to any of this. But that also is probably going

38:38.220 --> 38:42.860
to not serve them when they're adults. I'll just have to live on my farm for the rest of time.

38:42.860 --> 38:44.700
A title suggestion, Coder Farm.

38:46.460 --> 38:52.300
I want to thank our members at coderqa.co. You guys are our army that keeps us going.

38:52.300 --> 38:56.220
And we appreciate you. You can now get an ad free version of the show,

38:56.220 --> 39:02.220
ad free, support the show and get the Coderly report. We've also launched the network membership

39:02.220 --> 39:07.980
at Jupiter.party. So you can for the price of two shows, although right now it's $2 off for a year.

39:08.620 --> 39:13.340
So for less than the price of two shows, you can get access to all the show special feeds,

39:13.340 --> 39:18.700
including the Linux unplugged live stream, self-hosted post show, the Coderly report,

39:18.700 --> 39:22.460
all in one feed. And it's the only way to get Linux action news ad free.

39:22.460 --> 39:27.420
So that's at Jupiter.party. If you're a Coder QA member, we still appreciate you. And

39:28.300 --> 39:31.500
even if you're not in the spot to be a member, even if you're just a listener,

39:31.500 --> 39:35.660
maybe you take a moment to tell a friend about the show. We really appreciate that too.

39:35.660 --> 39:39.340
Thank you very much. Mr. Dominic, is there anywhere you'd like to send people this week?

39:40.060 --> 39:44.540
Follow me on Twitter at Domenico and go to Alice.dev if you have legacy data to move.

39:45.900 --> 39:51.820
Who doesn't? As we can see from these JVM vulnerabilities. Oh yeah. Everybody does.

39:51.820 --> 39:56.380
Everybody does. Let's see. I'll plug the telegram. The network telegram is at

39:56.380 --> 40:01.260
jupiterbroadcasting.com slash telegram. We'd love to have you join the conversation there.

40:01.260 --> 40:06.140
We also have a matrix server with a Coder Radio matrix feedback room and discussion room. We have

40:06.140 --> 40:12.300
two different Coder Radio rooms. That matrix server is colony.jupiterbroadcasting.com.

40:12.300 --> 40:17.260
Links to what we talked about today are at Coder.show slash four, four, four. But that's

40:17.260 --> 40:22.140
just fun to say. You'll find our contact form over there as well as our RSS feed. We'd love

40:22.140 --> 40:25.820
to hear from you. Your feedback is a big part of the show and you can always join us live on a

40:25.820 --> 40:31.740
Monday. We do it at noon Eastern 3 p.m. Well noon Pacific 3 p.m. Eastern. I'll get it right someday.

40:31.740 --> 40:56.140
Thanks for joining us. We'll see you right back here next week on Coder Radio.
