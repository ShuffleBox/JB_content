00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
This is Kota Radio, episode 363, for June 24th, 2019.

00:31.000 --> 00:35.000
Hello, and welcome to Kota Radio,

00:35.000 --> 00:39.000
Jupiter Broadcasting's weekly talk show that takes a pragmatic look,

00:39.000 --> 00:46.000
well, at least most of the time, at the art and business of software development and related technologies.

00:46.000 --> 00:52.000
My name is Wes, and I'm joined by our very best co-host, Mr. Michael Dominic.

00:52.000 --> 00:54.000
Welcome back, Mike.

00:54.000 --> 00:56.000
Hello, hello.

00:56.000 --> 01:02.000
Now, we're lucky enough to be joined by one other troublesome fellow today, Mr. Chris Fisher. Hi, Chris.

01:02.000 --> 01:04.000
Here comes trouble.

01:04.000 --> 01:05.000
That's right.

01:05.000 --> 01:09.000
That's what they always said. Every IT job I ever went to, and I'd walk up with another guy.

01:09.000 --> 01:12.000
If it's just me, they wouldn't say that, but two of you, here comes trouble.

01:12.000 --> 01:15.000
Well, you know, you got a buddy, a schemer, someone to help.

01:15.000 --> 01:19.000
Somebody, I know somebody else has had that problem out in IT. Shout out at Chris Elias.

01:19.000 --> 01:22.000
Yeah, well, when I heard you guys were talking about the art and business again,

01:22.000 --> 01:25.000
at least one of your topics was the art and business of software development.

01:25.000 --> 01:26.000
Those are always my favorite.

01:26.000 --> 01:30.000
Yeah, I mean, it's deep because I love all the tech stuff. I really do.

01:30.000 --> 01:32.000
And we're going to start with a little of that today.

01:32.000 --> 01:37.000
But, you know, you got to do this for a living, and it gets wrapped up in how you live your life,

01:37.000 --> 01:39.000
and that kind of, that kind of matters a lot. You only got one.

01:39.000 --> 01:44.000
A lot of things Mike and I talk about off air is more like the how do you keep at it kind of aspect,

01:44.000 --> 01:46.000
and that's something we've brought into the show over the years.

01:46.000 --> 01:51.000
And, yeah, I wanted to contribute to that conversation because it's something that,

01:51.000 --> 01:55.000
even as things have changed here for us as we've become part of Linux Academy,

01:55.000 --> 02:01.000
my roles have changed, my work has changed, and that's had strange and different and unexpected impacts on me.

02:01.000 --> 02:05.000
And I'm just kind of getting to the other side of it, and I've learned some things

02:05.000 --> 02:10.000
and some lessons that I thought I already knew, but you got to learn them again sometimes.

02:10.000 --> 02:12.000
Anyway, so when we get there, I'm excited to talk about it.

02:12.000 --> 02:15.000
But I know we have a lot of things to talk about today, not just that.

02:15.000 --> 02:16.000
Thanks for letting me be here.

02:16.000 --> 02:19.000
Oh, yeah, of course. How are you doing today, Mike?

02:19.000 --> 02:23.000
I'm good, I'm good. I'm looking forward to our menage a trois once again.

02:23.000 --> 02:26.000
Did you load the new Mac OS Catalina beta?

02:26.000 --> 02:28.000
No, because I'm not insane.

02:28.000 --> 02:32.000
No, I got no intentions, no intentions of doing that.

02:32.000 --> 02:36.000
This is going to be the most interesting in terms of impact just because of the 64-bit transition

02:36.000 --> 02:38.000
and the read-only system stuff.

02:38.000 --> 02:42.000
So I am fascinated from an observer standpoint.

02:42.000 --> 02:45.000
It's interesting to watch them develop that operating system now that, you know,

02:45.000 --> 02:49.000
we were kind of questioning for a while how much work are they putting in on that side of the fence,

02:49.000 --> 02:54.000
but we're kind of seeing more now, even if half of it is Project Catalyst.

02:54.000 --> 02:59.000
Yeah, I think they're actually, it seems like, it seems like they're about to actually make the Mac

02:59.000 --> 03:01.000
a competitive workstation platform again.

03:01.000 --> 03:08.000
Another rumor out today, 16-inch MacBook Pro with a new keyboard shipping in September, which we'll see.

03:08.000 --> 03:14.000
Now, how are we, I've been promised a new keyboard before, so when we say new.

03:14.000 --> 03:19.000
Well, you know, there was an interesting omission in a recent interview on a podcast

03:19.000 --> 03:26.000
with one of the lead engineers of the Mac Pro, and he said that the current generation of MacBooks

03:26.000 --> 03:32.000
were designed and built before their new Pro Services team that they worked with to design the iMac Pro

03:32.000 --> 03:37.000
and the Mac Pro, and that the MacBook Pro would have the same treatment,

03:37.000 --> 03:40.000
the entire line would have the same treatment is what the statement was.

03:40.000 --> 03:41.000
Interesting.

03:41.000 --> 03:43.000
Can you get the cheese grater form in that form factor?

03:43.000 --> 03:46.000
Well, I think what they're going to do is they're going to come up with a super MacBook Pro,

03:46.000 --> 03:51.000
like a big 16-inch that justifies a completely different keyboard.

03:51.000 --> 03:55.000
So they'll keep maybe the keyboard on the current MacBook Pro that they just updated.

03:55.000 --> 04:00.000
But they'll have a super expensive workstation model for, you know, all the complainers out there.

04:00.000 --> 04:03.000
So it's a $5,000 laptop is what that means.

04:03.000 --> 04:06.000
Yeah, we should all start a little savings jar somewhere.

04:06.000 --> 04:08.000
Yeah, exactly. I don't think so.

04:08.000 --> 04:12.000
I think, actually, I'm pretty happy. I've come to a new thing, so I'm pretty happy.

04:12.000 --> 04:14.000
I know you guys have got a lot to talk about, though.

04:14.000 --> 04:15.000
That's not what we're here to talk about today.

04:15.000 --> 04:18.000
Yeah, yeah, you know what I would probably be running on that?

04:18.000 --> 04:20.000
Well, we'll see. We'll get into that.

04:20.000 --> 04:25.000
It might be Kotlin because that's my programming language challenge.

04:25.000 --> 04:28.000
Not quite of the week, but, you know, the one we're doing right now.

04:28.000 --> 04:29.000
Are you doing them weekly now, really?

04:29.000 --> 04:31.000
I thought you kind of changed a little bit.

04:31.000 --> 04:33.000
Like, you're giving a little more room if it needs to really go deep, right?

04:33.000 --> 04:34.000
Yeah, we're alternating.

04:34.000 --> 04:38.000
So, Mike, you're looking at Go now, so we'll talk about that at the next episode,

04:38.000 --> 04:40.000
which I'm really looking forward to.

04:40.000 --> 04:41.000
And you were looking at Kotlin.

04:41.000 --> 04:44.000
Yeah, I've had a little time to sit and play with Kotlin.

04:44.000 --> 04:48.000
Yeah, if you're not familiar, it's developed by JetBrains and managed by, well,

04:48.000 --> 04:53.000
of course, the Kotlin Foundation because everyone's got to have a foundation these days.

04:53.000 --> 04:58.000
It's interesting because one version of the story for Kotlin could have been that it was this,

04:58.000 --> 04:59.000
like, niche little language, right?

04:59.000 --> 05:01.000
Lots of people try to make languages.

05:01.000 --> 05:05.000
Google made Dart, for instance, which seems somewhat comparable and comes to mind.

05:05.000 --> 05:08.000
Most languages don't go anywhere.

05:08.000 --> 05:12.000
Now, JetBrains has some advantages in that they make some of the best software development tools

05:12.000 --> 05:13.000
in the business.

05:13.000 --> 05:17.000
So they clearly know a lot about, you know, you have to get in your hooks into these languages

05:17.000 --> 05:19.000
if you're going to make a nice IDE.

05:19.000 --> 05:22.000
So you learn a lot about how that all works and maybe how to put one together.

05:22.000 --> 05:26.000
It's just, it's been very impressive that Kotlin has become so popular so fast,

05:26.000 --> 05:32.000
and, like, in particular with Google adopting it as, you know, language du jour on Android.

05:32.000 --> 05:36.000
For me, I came from a lot more dynamic languages before,

05:36.000 --> 05:40.000
and I'd done a little bit of some of the statically typed languages like ML

05:40.000 --> 05:44.000
way in the past when I was, you know, learning computer science,

05:44.000 --> 05:46.000
and I hadn't dabbled that much in Java.

05:46.000 --> 05:50.000
I came to Java late in life, and I'll be honest, it was kind of painful.

05:50.000 --> 05:52.000
Mike, I'm sure you can sympathize with that.

05:52.000 --> 05:54.000
Oh, yeah. Oof.

05:54.000 --> 05:56.000
So how did you work your way through it?

05:56.000 --> 06:00.000
I mean, mostly I just sort of avoided it and used it where I could.

06:00.000 --> 06:01.000
But it is useful, right?

06:01.000 --> 06:05.000
I mean, the JVM is a fantastic platform to run on top of,

06:05.000 --> 06:08.000
and there's world-class libraries out there for Java,

06:08.000 --> 06:13.000
so you need or at least will want to sort of use those things.

06:13.000 --> 06:16.000
But things seemed like they really changed kind of recently

06:16.000 --> 06:19.000
when the situation between Oracle and Google heated up.

06:19.000 --> 06:23.000
Yeah, that's a complicating factor, that's for sure.

06:23.000 --> 06:26.000
Oracle, yeah. Oh, boy, Oracle.

06:26.000 --> 06:32.000
Yeah. It seems like that head-to-head battle sort of started.

06:32.000 --> 06:36.000
You saw more and more Android developers start to look at Kotlin,

06:36.000 --> 06:39.000
and Google itself would start to talk about Kotlin more.

06:39.000 --> 06:42.000
And if I understand, and I really don't,

06:42.000 --> 06:44.000
but the little bit that I do seem to understand

06:44.000 --> 06:47.000
is that Kotlin has a pretty similar syntax and concept

06:47.000 --> 06:49.000
from a lot of popular languages.

06:49.000 --> 06:51.000
So it's not a huge transition.

06:51.000 --> 06:54.000
No, that's what's nice, is to me, it's been a breath of fresh air.

06:54.000 --> 06:57.000
So it's not going to be like my go-to language.

06:57.000 --> 06:59.000
I still really like some of the more functional things.

06:59.000 --> 07:00.000
Not that we can talk more.

07:00.000 --> 07:02.000
You can do functional programming in Kotlin.

07:02.000 --> 07:05.000
It's just not, you know, super aimed towards it,

07:05.000 --> 07:08.000
like something like Haskell or Clojure is.

07:08.000 --> 07:10.000
But I didn't, you know, I never really enjoyed Java.

07:10.000 --> 07:11.000
You can make Java work really well.

07:11.000 --> 07:12.000
You can do whatever you want.

07:12.000 --> 07:14.000
It's a very powerful language.

07:14.000 --> 07:16.000
I just find it not a lot of fun to write

07:16.000 --> 07:18.000
and it doesn't really inspire me to want to use it.

07:18.000 --> 07:20.000
But you often need to use it places,

07:20.000 --> 07:23.000
either for performance or just as bindings to hook into stuff,

07:23.000 --> 07:24.000
libraries that you want to use,

07:24.000 --> 07:27.000
or you're interrupting with people who use Java.

07:27.000 --> 07:29.000
And Kotlin seems incredible there.

07:29.000 --> 07:32.000
Now, you could use something like Scala maybe or Clojure,

07:32.000 --> 07:37.000
but Kotlin's interoperability with Java is really just first class.

07:37.000 --> 07:42.000
And when you're not doing interop, it's just like Java plus plus.

07:42.000 --> 07:45.000
So if you're creating a Kotlin app or whatever,

07:45.000 --> 07:48.000
is it running in a Kotlin runtime or the JVM?

07:48.000 --> 07:51.000
Is it a binary app?

07:51.000 --> 07:54.000
Yeah, so it just compiles down to JVM bytecode.

07:54.000 --> 07:56.000
It can actually, you can actually do both.

07:56.000 --> 07:58.000
So there is a thing called Kotlin Native

07:58.000 --> 08:01.000
where you can straight up compile down to native code.

08:01.000 --> 08:02.000
Oh, OK.

08:02.000 --> 08:05.000
But 99% it's the JVM.

08:05.000 --> 08:07.000
Yeah, so that's the main use case that you see

08:07.000 --> 08:09.000
or for stuff like running on Android,

08:09.000 --> 08:11.000
which is similar but slightly different.

08:11.000 --> 08:16.000
And there is a weird, there is a weird JavaScript transpiling thing.

08:16.000 --> 08:17.000
I have never done that.

08:17.000 --> 08:20.000
But, you know, everything has to transpile to JavaScript now.

08:20.000 --> 08:22.000
So why not Kotlin?

08:22.000 --> 08:26.000
Yeah, that does seem to be the theme so far of these challenges.

08:26.000 --> 08:29.000
So the thing about JavaScript is that you can't avoid it, right,

08:29.000 --> 08:32.000
unless you only do back-end work for some service

08:32.000 --> 08:34.000
that connects other back-end services.

08:34.000 --> 08:36.000
OK, maybe you're in that narrow field that you've escaped it.

08:36.000 --> 08:38.000
But if you do anything on the web,

08:38.000 --> 08:40.000
you just have to use JavaScript, right?

08:40.000 --> 08:42.000
And JavaScript, it's getting better,

08:42.000 --> 08:44.000
but it's still painful and inconsistent.

08:44.000 --> 08:47.000
Now, I don't, having just come from TypeScript,

08:47.000 --> 08:49.000
I didn't play a ton with the JS side of Kotlin,

08:49.000 --> 08:51.000
although I did get it up and running

08:51.000 --> 08:53.000
and sort of poked around a little bit.

08:53.000 --> 08:55.000
I don't know that I would necessarily choose that over TypeScript

08:55.000 --> 08:58.000
just because TypeScript seems to be so popular

08:58.000 --> 09:00.000
in the JavaScript community.

09:00.000 --> 09:02.000
And you get a lot of the same benefits there

09:02.000 --> 09:04.000
if you enable those options.

09:04.000 --> 09:06.000
Now you get them in Kotlin by default.

09:06.000 --> 09:09.000
Like, I love the way Kotlin handles null types,

09:09.000 --> 09:11.000
non-null types, that sort of stuff.

09:11.000 --> 09:13.000
The way you think about it without...

09:13.000 --> 09:16.000
It's just, in some languages, you add it on with a monad,

09:16.000 --> 09:18.000
like maybe or either,

09:18.000 --> 09:20.000
and you see it everywhere in your code.

09:20.000 --> 09:22.000
And that can be nice because it is very explicit, right?

09:22.000 --> 09:24.000
You are thinking about, like, what's the failure case here?

09:24.000 --> 09:26.000
Is this an error?

09:26.000 --> 09:28.000
Kotlin, because they've sort of designed it

09:28.000 --> 09:32.000
and lowered it into the fabric of the language explicitly,

09:32.000 --> 09:34.000
it just feels a little bit more ergonomic,

09:34.000 --> 09:37.000
and you kind of forget about it a little bit more.

09:37.000 --> 09:39.000
We've talked a little bit, they're bringing some of those,

09:39.000 --> 09:42.000
like you say, they're importing these features

09:42.000 --> 09:44.000
from other popular languages,

09:44.000 --> 09:46.000
and then other languages are copying them.

09:46.000 --> 09:49.000
So it's kind of an interesting way to reflect

09:49.000 --> 09:51.000
on language design as well

09:51.000 --> 09:53.000
because JetBrains has been looking around,

09:53.000 --> 09:55.000
studying what's been popular in the industry,

09:55.000 --> 09:57.000
and there's been a lot of attempts at this stuff.

09:57.000 --> 10:00.000
Like, Scala seems like a good example,

10:00.000 --> 10:03.000
where it's a little bit more of a research language, right?

10:03.000 --> 10:05.000
It's designed and developed by a lot of academics,

10:05.000 --> 10:08.000
and it's absolutely a production language.

10:08.000 --> 10:10.000
Right, but where Kotlin seems like it's very much

10:10.000 --> 10:11.000
on the other end of that spectrum.

10:11.000 --> 10:13.000
It's very much inspired by this Java,

10:13.000 --> 10:16.000
sort of just, like, robust, professional, no-nonsense.

10:16.000 --> 10:18.000
We're not going to be that flashy.

10:18.000 --> 10:20.000
Right, our sales pitch isn't that we're

10:20.000 --> 10:22.000
some sort of unique, innovative language.

10:22.000 --> 10:25.000
It's more like, well, it's really pragmatic.

10:25.000 --> 10:27.000
It draws on inspirations from decades of things

10:27.000 --> 10:29.000
that have worked, which I think is part

10:29.000 --> 10:31.000
of what's made it easily adoptable.

10:31.000 --> 10:35.000
I think, Mike, you saw this one coming a mile away.

10:35.000 --> 10:38.000
Yeah, I mean, Kotlin, even before Android adopted it,

10:38.000 --> 10:41.000
or rather Google adopted it for Android,

10:41.000 --> 10:45.000
just, I think at the time when I first saw this come out,

10:45.000 --> 10:50.000
I was working on a very large-scale Java Play application,

10:50.000 --> 10:55.000
and the interoperability that Kotlin provided,

10:55.000 --> 10:59.000
even in its early days, just basically being a cleaner

10:59.000 --> 11:02.000
and, frankly, somewhat less verbose Java

11:02.000 --> 11:05.000
that could still pull in the client's existing JARs,

11:05.000 --> 11:08.000
and, you know, so JARs are Java libraries, right?

11:08.000 --> 11:11.000
And completely, you know, pulling great old dependencies,

11:11.000 --> 11:14.000
just like your straight Java, was really nice.

11:14.000 --> 11:16.000
Now, having said that, things have changed.

11:16.000 --> 11:18.000
That was years ago.

11:18.000 --> 11:21.000
I have to agree with Wes that Kotlin maybe wouldn't

11:21.000 --> 11:23.000
be my first choice anymore.

11:23.000 --> 11:25.000
I'd probably try something a little more functional.

11:25.000 --> 11:29.000
For me, that'd probably look more like an F sharp.

11:29.000 --> 11:33.000
But I have to say, given the choice,

11:33.000 --> 11:35.000
like if I was targeting the JVM again,

11:35.000 --> 11:39.000
I would probably be hard-pressed not to pick Kotlin, right?

11:39.000 --> 11:44.000
I would be pretty enthusiastic about Kotlin over straight Java.

11:44.000 --> 11:47.000
And some of the irony here is the JDK 11

11:47.000 --> 11:51.000
is adopting many of the features of Kotlin.

11:51.000 --> 11:52.000
Right.

11:52.000 --> 11:54.000
Stuff that they had in their compiler

11:54.000 --> 11:56.000
will now be supported in the host,

11:56.000 --> 11:57.000
or at least one of their hosts.

11:57.000 --> 11:59.000
That is interesting.

11:59.000 --> 12:01.000
It does seem like a good choice, too, you know,

12:01.000 --> 12:03.000
if you're not going to go pursue some of the more esoteric

12:03.000 --> 12:04.000
or functional, you know.

12:04.000 --> 12:06.000
If you have a team and everyone wants to go do Scala

12:06.000 --> 12:08.000
and you're excited about Scala Z and some of the neat stuff

12:08.000 --> 12:10.000
in that community, cool.

12:10.000 --> 12:12.000
But if you just sort of want a better Java,

12:12.000 --> 12:14.000
you want some improvements, a little modernization,

12:14.000 --> 12:16.000
really nice IDE support.

12:16.000 --> 12:18.000
Yeah, Kotlin seems like a good choice.

12:18.000 --> 12:20.000
I'm curious what your process like was here.

12:20.000 --> 12:22.000
Did you try standing up a few things?

12:22.000 --> 12:24.000
Did you look at examples?

12:24.000 --> 12:26.000
Like what's your exploratory...

12:26.000 --> 12:28.000
I usually start by following sort of whatever

12:28.000 --> 12:30.000
the most official-looking documentation is

12:30.000 --> 12:33.000
just to try to get a sense of like what's the onboarding path

12:33.000 --> 12:35.000
for some random person coming from the Internet

12:35.000 --> 12:37.000
just curious about the language.

12:37.000 --> 12:38.000
It's good thinking.

12:38.000 --> 12:39.000
Yeah.

12:39.000 --> 12:42.000
And in this case, it had been a while since I'd used IntelliJ,

12:42.000 --> 12:43.000
so I got that going.

12:43.000 --> 12:44.000
I know there's some integrations,

12:44.000 --> 12:46.000
like they have a sublime text,

12:46.000 --> 12:49.000
and I did play around with it just kind of using it minimal style

12:49.000 --> 12:51.000
in the terminal with Vim.

12:51.000 --> 12:53.000
But it seemed proper coming from JetBrains.

12:53.000 --> 12:56.000
I should use it in its sort of home environment.

12:56.000 --> 12:59.000
So that was an interesting part too just because I don't...

12:59.000 --> 13:00.000
I'm not...

13:00.000 --> 13:02.000
I mean, I appreciate all the neat features of IDEs

13:02.000 --> 13:04.000
and I think especially for some of the languages

13:04.000 --> 13:06.000
in the Kotlin and Scala and Java style,

13:06.000 --> 13:08.000
like those IDEs are great.

13:08.000 --> 13:10.000
Yeah, it's just not where you live every day though.

13:10.000 --> 13:11.000
Yeah, exactly.

13:11.000 --> 13:13.000
So that was kind of fun being on that side of the fence.

13:13.000 --> 13:14.000
It was nice.

13:14.000 --> 13:15.000
And it is, I mean, you know,

13:15.000 --> 13:17.000
autocomplete and generating code for you,

13:17.000 --> 13:22.000
and it's an interesting alternative style of development.

13:22.000 --> 13:25.000
But it is in the spirit of, you know, fast feedback cycles

13:25.000 --> 13:27.000
and giving you information and helping you understand.

13:27.000 --> 13:31.000
And instead of a running program, it's a static thing.

13:31.000 --> 13:34.000
But it feels incredibly dynamic because they're doing so much

13:34.000 --> 13:37.000
to interrupt and interrogate with the code.

13:37.000 --> 13:38.000
Get development environment set up,

13:38.000 --> 13:41.000
and then I usually start with just some, like,

13:41.000 --> 13:43.000
simple academic challenges.

13:43.000 --> 13:46.000
I've been doing the advent of code because I like...

13:46.000 --> 13:47.000
They're not purely...

13:47.000 --> 13:49.000
You know, it's not just like a sorting algorithm

13:49.000 --> 13:50.000
or something like that.

13:50.000 --> 13:52.000
It's a little bit of novelty and some, like,

13:52.000 --> 13:54.000
data loading and processing.

13:54.000 --> 13:55.000
So you have to start doing some stuff.

13:55.000 --> 13:57.000
Like, you want to start, you know, looking at IO,

13:57.000 --> 13:58.000
looking at networking.

13:58.000 --> 13:59.000
Sure.

13:59.000 --> 14:00.000
Trying to understand, like,

14:00.000 --> 14:01.000
how's the concurrency working in this language?

14:01.000 --> 14:02.000
Yeah, when you think about the scope of it,

14:02.000 --> 14:03.000
it's a lot of things to touch on.

14:03.000 --> 14:04.000
You might also want to start, you know,

14:04.000 --> 14:05.000
maybe you want to...

14:05.000 --> 14:06.000
Depending on the type of language,

14:06.000 --> 14:07.000
maybe you want to try to get, like,

14:07.000 --> 14:09.000
a web stack up and going.

14:09.000 --> 14:10.000
Of course.

14:10.000 --> 14:11.000
I didn't do that this time.

14:11.000 --> 14:13.000
But, right, that's a good one to start a play with

14:13.000 --> 14:15.000
and see, all right, what's the, you know,

14:15.000 --> 14:17.000
connections to the databases like?

14:17.000 --> 14:21.000
Now, that's easier here because I was just using the JVM,

14:21.000 --> 14:23.000
and that was an environment I was already familiar.

14:23.000 --> 14:25.000
So most of the stuff I was interested in

14:25.000 --> 14:27.000
was some of the compiler type safety,

14:27.000 --> 14:30.000
all the little extras that Kotlin's thrown on top.

14:30.000 --> 14:31.000
It has been fun.

14:31.000 --> 14:32.000
While I was doing some research,

14:32.000 --> 14:35.000
I'll have a link in the doc, of course,

14:35.000 --> 14:38.000
coder.show-363.

14:38.000 --> 14:41.000
There's a Clojure IDE called Cursive,

14:41.000 --> 14:45.000
and it's like a plug-in wrapper sits on top of IntelliJ.

14:45.000 --> 14:47.000
Clojure's a little harder because it is a very dynamic language,

14:47.000 --> 14:48.000
so you can't do...

14:48.000 --> 14:50.000
Or it's more difficult to do a lot of the static analysis

14:50.000 --> 14:53.000
that you can do for languages like Kotlin.

14:53.000 --> 14:55.000
It's also a little bit heavier,

14:55.000 --> 14:59.000
or at least has more runtime, more dynamic nature,

14:59.000 --> 15:04.000
so it can't always or isn't as easy to optimize in certain cases.

15:04.000 --> 15:07.000
Originally, this IDE for Clojure

15:07.000 --> 15:09.000
was written mostly in Clojure,

15:09.000 --> 15:11.000
but the developer has recently changed

15:11.000 --> 15:13.000
a whole bunch of its core to Kotlin

15:13.000 --> 15:15.000
so that he could get better startup times,

15:15.000 --> 15:17.000
and he just thought that the interoperability

15:17.000 --> 15:19.000
with having to, you know, you have to hook into a bunch of Java

15:19.000 --> 15:22.000
because that's what IntelliJ is based on,

15:22.000 --> 15:23.000
thought that was more pleasant.

15:23.000 --> 15:26.000
So it seems like that's exactly the use case I was thinking of.

15:26.000 --> 15:29.000
I wouldn't maybe design my whole data flow pipeline

15:29.000 --> 15:33.000
of architecture of my program and choose Kotlin,

15:33.000 --> 15:35.000
but all the little pieces where I got to touch systems

15:35.000 --> 15:39.000
or a little hot loop instead of Java, why not Kotlin?

15:39.000 --> 15:41.000
I think that's the theme of my review.

15:41.000 --> 15:43.000
Why not Kotlin?

15:43.000 --> 15:44.000
That's pretty good.

15:44.000 --> 15:46.000
That's actually kind of a title right there.

15:46.000 --> 15:48.000
Good one.

15:48.000 --> 15:49.000
Nice.

15:49.000 --> 15:51.000
So now it's go time.

15:51.000 --> 15:52.000
Now it's go time, yeah.

15:52.000 --> 15:53.000
So now it's go time,

15:53.000 --> 15:56.000
but are you ready for your challenge for two weeks from now?

15:56.000 --> 15:58.000
Oh, I am excited already.

15:58.000 --> 15:59.000
All right, all right.

15:59.000 --> 16:02.000
So you've taken the journey,

16:02.000 --> 16:05.000
you've held hands with Javaduke,

16:05.000 --> 16:08.000
and if you get that reference, you're old.

16:08.000 --> 16:12.000
And now you knew this was coming.

16:12.000 --> 16:13.000
Objective C.

16:13.000 --> 16:14.000
Oh.

16:14.000 --> 16:15.000
No way.

16:15.000 --> 16:17.000
You're throwing the gauntlet down, aren't you?

16:17.000 --> 16:18.000
Wow.

16:18.000 --> 16:20.000
Actually, I mean, part of me thought it was going to be

16:20.000 --> 16:21.000
the first one he chose,

16:21.000 --> 16:23.000
so I'm kind of surprised it took this long.

16:23.000 --> 16:24.000
Absolutely.

16:24.000 --> 16:26.000
Okay, I need a little help here then.

16:26.000 --> 16:30.000
Can I get like maybe some suggested first steps?

16:30.000 --> 16:32.000
Like what's the – what would you like to make sure that I –

16:32.000 --> 16:34.000
what shouldn't I miss when I'm trying Objective C

16:34.000 --> 16:35.000
and maybe how do I get started?

16:35.000 --> 16:36.000
Oh, yeah, because there's a lot here for Mike.

16:36.000 --> 16:38.000
So, yeah, there's a lot here, right?

16:38.000 --> 16:40.000
And, you know, to make it easier,

16:40.000 --> 16:44.000
just do a GNU step, the Linux implementation,

16:44.000 --> 16:46.000
so you don't have to like worry about Mac VMs.

16:46.000 --> 16:48.000
Oh, well that's nice of you.

16:48.000 --> 16:49.000
That is nice.

16:49.000 --> 16:50.000
Right?

16:50.000 --> 16:52.000
I mean, if you want to set up a Mac VM, you can,

16:52.000 --> 16:55.000
but by the time you do that, it's a huge pain in the ass.

16:55.000 --> 16:58.000
The next version of Swift will be out.

16:58.000 --> 17:00.000
Yeah.

17:00.000 --> 17:02.000
I would say take a look at GNU step

17:02.000 --> 17:06.000
and try to write any kind of small application.

17:06.000 --> 17:08.000
It could literally do – I don't care.

17:08.000 --> 17:10.000
It could do nothing, right?

17:10.000 --> 17:15.000
But do it using pure message passing as much as possible.

17:15.000 --> 17:16.000
Oh, wow.

17:16.000 --> 17:17.000
Okay.

17:17.000 --> 17:18.000
Yeah.

17:18.000 --> 17:19.000
Right.

17:19.000 --> 17:21.000
So take advantage of the dynamic messaging that Objective C has.

17:21.000 --> 17:24.000
So like you could – you could just write C, right?

17:24.000 --> 17:25.000
Because this is a superset of C.

17:25.000 --> 17:26.000
Of course, right.

17:26.000 --> 17:29.000
You could also write in a very C++-y style.

17:29.000 --> 17:30.000
Try not to do that.

17:30.000 --> 17:32.000
I mean, you'll have to some, but yeah,

17:32.000 --> 17:34.000
try to do a lot of the dynamic messaging

17:34.000 --> 17:38.000
and see what it feels like to not have the compiler protect you.

17:38.000 --> 17:41.000
Just sort of pass messages around and deal with it.

17:41.000 --> 17:42.000
Okay.

17:42.000 --> 17:43.000
Just pass them around.

17:43.000 --> 17:44.000
That's it.

17:44.000 --> 17:45.000
Oh, man.

17:45.000 --> 17:47.000
I cannot wait to hear how this goes.

17:47.000 --> 17:48.000
This is – okay, this will be good.

17:48.000 --> 17:50.000
I'm going to have to get started right away.

17:50.000 --> 17:52.000
And I just linked to GNU step in the chat,

17:52.000 --> 17:56.000
and I tell you, Wes, this project looks like it's well-maintained.

17:56.000 --> 17:57.000
Real.

17:57.000 --> 17:58.000
Mmm.

17:58.000 --> 18:00.000
Oh, it's –

18:00.000 --> 18:03.000
So this might be as much a GNU step report as anything else, huh?

18:03.000 --> 18:04.000
Oh, man.

18:04.000 --> 18:05.000
Look at that.

18:05.000 --> 18:06.000
That takes me back.

18:06.000 --> 18:07.000
Look at that user experience there.

18:07.000 --> 18:10.000
We've got to put this in the show notes so the audience can take a look at this.

18:10.000 --> 18:11.000
This is too good.

18:11.000 --> 18:13.000
And this is, of course, more of a trolly one,

18:13.000 --> 18:16.000
so if it ends up just being a pain, whatever, we can all have a good laugh.

18:16.000 --> 18:19.000
No, this is a great choice, and, you know, it comes up so much.

18:19.000 --> 18:21.000
It's so much a part of the Coder Radio heritage.

18:21.000 --> 18:25.000
I've got to – I need to – this is my journey to explore Objective-C.

18:25.000 --> 18:26.000
You're a brave man, Wes.

18:26.000 --> 18:27.000
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

18:27.000 --> 18:30.000
News about Objective-C 2.0.

18:30.000 --> 18:32.000
This is going to be amazing, Wes.

18:32.000 --> 18:35.000
I'm not entirely sure when the last time this project was maintained is.

18:35.000 --> 18:37.000
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

18:37.000 --> 18:40.000
It may be easier to get a Mac VM going.

18:40.000 --> 18:42.000
I think some of the listeners did.

18:42.000 --> 18:45.000
They were talking about it in the Telegram.

18:45.000 --> 18:46.000
Hmm.

18:46.000 --> 18:48.000
I'm pretty close.

18:48.000 --> 18:50.000
I still haven't cracked it, but I'm really close.

18:50.000 --> 18:51.000
I'm pretty good on that.

18:51.000 --> 18:52.000
Yeah.

18:52.000 --> 18:53.000
I'm really close.

18:53.000 --> 18:54.000
You are.

18:54.000 --> 18:55.000
You know, you have Hackintosh experience.

18:55.000 --> 18:56.000
Yeah.

18:56.000 --> 18:57.000
I do, too.

18:57.000 --> 18:58.000
It's funny.

18:58.000 --> 18:59.000
I got the GPU working.

18:59.000 --> 19:00.000
That wasn't the hard part.

19:00.000 --> 19:02.000
It turns out the hard part has been getting the USB password to work.

19:02.000 --> 19:08.000
So my Mac VM detects my Ethernet cards but never gets an IP.

19:08.000 --> 19:09.000
Hmm.

19:09.000 --> 19:13.000
And my mouse and keyboard aren't working too well because something's not quite right.

19:13.000 --> 19:15.000
But it works fine under Windows, so.

19:15.000 --> 19:17.000
So it's not the underlying scheme.

19:17.000 --> 19:19.000
I don't think so.

19:19.000 --> 19:20.000
Hard to say, though.

19:20.000 --> 19:21.000
Mac OS.

19:21.000 --> 19:22.000
Excuse me.

19:22.000 --> 19:23.000
Excuse me.

19:23.000 --> 19:24.000
It's such a black box.

19:24.000 --> 19:27.000
I mean, it's kind of fun to play with and poke with because you don't know what's going

19:27.000 --> 19:28.000
on, but.

19:28.000 --> 19:32.000
I, as much as I respect what Apple has done with Mac OS, when you do the Hackintosh or

19:32.000 --> 19:35.000
the VM route, you do kind of see under the hood a little bit.

19:35.000 --> 19:39.000
You're like, oh, it's just like every other OS.

19:39.000 --> 19:42.000
There's subsystems that are like thought out, up to date, right?

19:42.000 --> 19:44.000
They put a lot of time and tooling into.

19:44.000 --> 19:46.000
That's the parts I respect the most, especially as a media production person.

19:46.000 --> 19:47.000
Yes.

19:47.000 --> 19:48.000
I can really respect that.

19:48.000 --> 19:49.000
I mean, Apple audio.

19:49.000 --> 19:50.000
Mm-hmm.

19:50.000 --> 19:51.000
Mm-hmm.

19:51.000 --> 19:53.000
And then other parts, you're like, oh, and then you just, you had some twine left over

19:53.000 --> 19:54.000
from the nice thing.

19:54.000 --> 19:55.000
Yeah.

19:55.000 --> 19:58.000
And you used that to wrap up the rest into a pseudo POSIX implementation.

19:58.000 --> 19:59.000
Yeah.

19:59.000 --> 20:00.000
A lot, actually.

20:00.000 --> 20:01.000
It's a lot like that.

20:01.000 --> 20:03.000
But, you know, it works, right?

20:03.000 --> 20:04.000
It does.

20:04.000 --> 20:05.000
On their targeted hardware.

20:05.000 --> 20:06.000
It totally does.

20:06.000 --> 20:10.000
In their problem domain, they've got it figured out, and that's what matters.

20:10.000 --> 20:12.000
They're not solving for me.

20:12.000 --> 20:14.000
Are we ever going to see a server again?

20:14.000 --> 20:15.000
No.

20:15.000 --> 20:20.000
Well, no, actually, I think, yeah, didn't they, well, they just announced like a SKU

20:20.000 --> 20:22.000
of the Mac Pro that's designed for rack mount.

20:22.000 --> 20:23.000
You're right there.

20:23.000 --> 20:24.000
Yeah.

20:24.000 --> 20:25.000
That's pretty close.

20:25.000 --> 20:26.000
Yeah.

20:26.000 --> 20:27.000
Wow.

20:27.000 --> 20:32.000
So it'll have like, I think instead of like handles and wheels, it'll have like rail mounts.

20:32.000 --> 20:34.000
That'd be pretty, that'd actually look pretty slick.

20:34.000 --> 20:35.000
Not bad.

20:35.000 --> 20:39.000
I mean, and, you know, I guess $5,000 for a starting price of a server isn't outrageous.

20:39.000 --> 20:40.000
Right.

20:40.000 --> 20:41.000
Once you put it in that context, it's kind of like, okay.

20:41.000 --> 20:46.000
It's just like my real fancy little weird GPU compute cluster that looks pretty.

20:46.000 --> 20:50.000
I mean, you know, if you have a nice aesthetic, you've shown it off.

20:50.000 --> 20:55.000
I think that case is ugly as hell, but we should move on to real time follow up here.

20:55.000 --> 20:57.000
Apparently, you can apt install GNU step.

20:57.000 --> 20:58.000
Lucky you.

20:58.000 --> 21:00.000
Give that a try there, Wes.

21:00.000 --> 21:01.000
Try it right now.

21:01.000 --> 21:02.000
See what happens.

21:02.000 --> 21:04.000
He's got his ThinkPad right here.

21:04.000 --> 21:05.000
Oh, yeah.

21:05.000 --> 21:06.000
Here we go.

21:06.000 --> 21:07.000
Yeah.

21:07.000 --> 21:08.000
All right.

21:08.000 --> 21:09.000
Hitting yes.

21:09.000 --> 21:10.000
64 megabytes coming on down.

21:10.000 --> 21:11.000
That's all it is, baby.

21:11.000 --> 21:13.000
GNU step and GNU step tack to Val.

21:13.000 --> 21:14.000
Those are the two.

21:14.000 --> 21:15.000
I love it.

21:15.000 --> 21:16.000
I'm excited.

21:16.000 --> 21:17.000
Thank you, Mike.

21:17.000 --> 21:18.000
I hope you like square brackets.

21:18.000 --> 21:19.000
I love all kinds of brackets.

21:19.000 --> 21:20.000
I'm not a, I don't choose between my bracket.

21:20.000 --> 21:24.160
I mean, I think curly is my favorite because it's just really fun, like on a whiteboard

21:24.160 --> 21:27.000
to draw, you know, a really pretty curly brace.

21:27.000 --> 21:30.000
No, it intimidates me to try to draw a curly bracket on a whiteboard.

21:30.000 --> 21:31.000
Yeah, it's nice.

21:31.000 --> 21:32.560
I can't draw a curly brace.

21:32.560 --> 21:34.240
I always feel like an idiot.

21:34.240 --> 21:40.600
So I had kind of a topic that caught my attention that was actually brought up by Mike in our

21:40.600 --> 21:41.600
Slack chat.

21:41.600 --> 21:42.600
Yeah.

21:42.600 --> 21:45.280
So Mike brought it up and then you sort of were sucked into a rabbit hole, I'm pretty

21:45.280 --> 21:46.280
sure.

21:46.280 --> 21:47.280
As I do.

21:47.280 --> 21:48.400
As I do.

21:48.400 --> 21:53.760
Something I noticed when I went independent with Jupiter Broadcasting, I thought to myself

21:53.760 --> 21:58.960
originally I'll convert this into what I called a lifestyle business and I'll just run it

21:58.960 --> 22:07.920
as a small little business that makes enough living for myself and you know, a few employees.

22:07.920 --> 22:11.680
And that was a beautiful dream that was absolutely impossible.

22:11.680 --> 22:18.920
When you look at the hustle as a service culture that we now live in, it was never really going

22:18.920 --> 22:20.360
to be sustainable.

22:20.360 --> 22:26.040
And there is this pride that has developed in Western culture, even worse in the United

22:26.040 --> 22:33.680
States, that Alexis Ohanian, the investor and guy behind Reddit now, really nailed in

22:33.680 --> 22:40.120
an interview that Mike found on Wall Street Journal and I'll just read part of his opening

22:40.120 --> 22:41.120
statement here.

22:41.120 --> 22:46.000
He says, I've spoken out quite a bit about things like hustle porn and the ceremony of

22:46.000 --> 22:50.000
showing off on social media about how hard you're working.

22:50.000 --> 22:54.720
You see, you all see it on Instagram and you certainly see it in the startup community.

22:54.720 --> 22:57.120
It becomes really toxic.

22:57.120 --> 23:03.920
And this became like amazingly poignant just this week when over the weekend there was

23:03.920 --> 23:13.240
this massive kerfuffle about Ubuntu potentially dropping 32-bit or I-386 support in 1910 Ubuntu.

23:13.240 --> 23:16.440
Oh boy, my 32 bits.

23:16.440 --> 23:18.560
That was announced last Tuesday.

23:18.560 --> 23:22.020
It's actually, we have all the links in Linux Action News.

23:22.020 --> 23:28.840
It's actually been in discussion roughly since May 4th, 2018 and I have followed the discussion

23:28.840 --> 23:29.840
since then.

23:29.840 --> 23:32.440
We've covered it in a couple of our shows actually.

23:32.440 --> 23:37.720
But on Tuesday, Will Cook, the desktop manager for Ubuntu, announced that they were officially

23:37.720 --> 23:42.240
going to deprecate support for the I-386 architecture.

23:42.240 --> 23:43.240
That was on Tuesday.

23:43.240 --> 23:49.160
On Friday, a Valve developer noticed, I guess he wasn't following it super close, but kind

23:49.160 --> 23:50.160
of close.

23:50.160 --> 23:56.600
And he immediately tweeted that, hey, you know, gonna have to drop support for Ubuntu.

23:56.600 --> 23:57.800
This just wrecks gaming.

23:57.800 --> 23:58.800
We're out.

23:58.800 --> 24:04.840
Not necessarily a Valve position, but this staffer's position who's responsible and part

24:04.840 --> 24:05.840
of the team.

24:05.840 --> 24:07.800
So he likely has pretty big input or maybe not.

24:07.800 --> 24:09.240
Maybe he even has, who knows.

24:09.240 --> 24:11.980
But it's not an official Valve communication.

24:11.980 --> 24:15.600
But from that tweet, the internet sort of erupted as it does.

24:15.600 --> 24:18.600
Like half a dozen articles went live in a matter of hours.

24:18.600 --> 24:22.440
A change.org petition was created to force.

24:22.440 --> 24:23.440
That's the real sign, right?

24:23.440 --> 24:24.440
Yeah.

24:24.440 --> 24:27.520
Demand that Ubuntu include 32-bit support.

24:27.520 --> 24:34.600
And Canonical responded, you know, considering that this thing broke Saturday morning, their

24:34.600 --> 24:35.600
time.

24:35.600 --> 24:38.880
They responded by Sunday morning, my time, which is Pacific.

24:38.880 --> 24:41.360
So that's a decent turnaround, right?

24:41.360 --> 24:43.600
The internet was not satisfied.

24:43.600 --> 24:47.880
Once the primary thing they were upset about had been solved, they now had to continue

24:47.880 --> 24:49.200
to justify the outrage.

24:49.200 --> 24:51.840
Well, once you're spun up, you're just all in the huff.

24:51.840 --> 24:54.520
And you need to, you know, there has to be rationale.

24:54.520 --> 24:56.520
There has to be rationale.

24:56.520 --> 25:01.100
And so the message changed to, well, you didn't communicate it properly.

25:01.100 --> 25:08.060
This broke on a Friday, US time, and it took you until Sunday to say anything.

25:08.060 --> 25:10.000
Like why aren't you working 24-7?

25:10.000 --> 25:13.120
You're a multinational company with hundreds of employees.

25:13.120 --> 25:17.840
Why don't you have, this is quote, why don't you have decision makers working 24-7?

25:17.840 --> 25:20.200
To handle these things, end quote.

25:20.200 --> 25:25.160
And I saw a variation of that every couple of hours all weekend long, including up until

25:25.160 --> 25:26.800
as we went on air right now.

25:26.800 --> 25:28.960
To handle Twitter rage?

25:28.960 --> 25:29.960
That's no.

25:29.960 --> 25:30.960
Right.

25:30.960 --> 25:31.960
Yes.

25:31.960 --> 25:34.480
That is the expectation.

25:34.480 --> 25:36.900
Why aren't you here answering us?

25:36.900 --> 25:42.720
And it builds so fast, like multiple articles get posted, mobs form on Twitter.

25:42.720 --> 25:45.040
I mean, we watched this as a crew.

25:45.040 --> 25:46.640
We were all kind of, it was really kind of neat.

25:46.640 --> 25:48.520
We were monitoring all these various sources.

25:48.520 --> 25:52.040
And so we were really watching this thing from a complete 360 degrees.

25:52.040 --> 25:59.080
And it was fascinating to watch these mobs form and these different posts would go alive.

25:59.080 --> 26:02.880
And then you would see the, you would just see like a big spike in the social media reaction

26:02.880 --> 26:03.880
and the comments.

26:03.880 --> 26:04.880
Right.

26:04.880 --> 26:10.640
You had different people follow different outlets and they're suddenly, what's happening?

26:10.640 --> 26:15.360
And it was all kind of like, even if say, just for the sake of this entire kerfuffle,

26:15.360 --> 26:18.440
say canonical stuck to their guns and said, nope, dropped.

26:18.440 --> 26:21.720
We're going the route of Catalina in Ubuntu 1910.

26:21.720 --> 26:24.200
We are not going to maintain the I-36 architecture.

26:24.200 --> 26:25.200
We're done.

26:25.200 --> 26:28.760
Now we'll still maintain it for years in 1804 and 1604.

26:28.760 --> 26:33.440
So you could probably just grab it from there or grab a PPA or a snap or a flat.

26:33.440 --> 26:36.780
Like there was always going to be a solution to this problem.

26:36.780 --> 26:41.120
It was never going to be a disaster, but it went to 11.

26:41.120 --> 26:46.280
And then what I thought was fascinating is this demand of an immediate response.

26:46.280 --> 26:49.960
And it really enforces this culture we have now entered where if you have a job that's

26:49.960 --> 26:53.200
on the internet, you work 24 seven.

26:53.200 --> 26:59.180
And we're, we, it happens to us here, um, part because it's, it's both hobby and profession,

26:59.180 --> 27:02.560
but it really is like we have people all over the world.

27:02.560 --> 27:04.480
Joe is essentially shifted to our time zone.

27:04.480 --> 27:07.960
Like it's really, it really is a big problem.

27:07.960 --> 27:12.760
And it, it is a massive contributor to burnout, a significant contributor burnout.

27:12.760 --> 27:14.040
That's where I wanted to get your thoughts, Mike.

27:14.040 --> 27:15.040
Yeah.

27:15.040 --> 27:16.040
I mean, so there's a couple of things here.

27:16.040 --> 27:22.400
Like one, I, maybe I'm just confused, but my understanding is like, this is actually

27:22.400 --> 27:23.680
not that big of a deal.

27:23.680 --> 27:26.260
No, this particular example is not, no, right.

27:26.260 --> 27:31.560
The technical problem here is, is again solved with the PPA, but, and I think the Linux action

27:31.560 --> 27:33.600
use coverage was much deeper and better.

27:33.600 --> 27:36.520
And if you're curious listener go there.

27:36.520 --> 27:41.840
Um, but yeah, I mean, we get this all, I get this all the time, uh, Chris and I have, uh,

27:41.840 --> 27:48.640
Kovacs on many a Slack conversation about just constant, like basically death marching,

27:48.640 --> 27:49.640
right?

27:49.640 --> 27:52.680
Um, and I have to tell you, Chris, these are my experience.

27:52.680 --> 27:55.520
People generally don't appreciate it.

27:55.520 --> 27:59.960
Even if you do pull the all nighter to get that build out or, you know, in the case of

27:59.960 --> 28:05.680
kind of the Twitter rage stuff, I've had people tweet a question to me and I didn't respond

28:05.680 --> 28:11.720
in an hour because I was like, you know, doing my job and get like three, three follow on

28:11.720 --> 28:12.720
tweets, right.

28:12.720 --> 28:13.720
Or like emails.

28:13.720 --> 28:19.680
It's just, the expectations have gotten crazy from, I remember way back when in my time

28:19.680 --> 28:25.740
machine before like social media and Twitter, you would send someone an email and they might

28:25.740 --> 28:27.820
not reply until the next business day.

28:27.820 --> 28:30.040
And that was totally normal.

28:30.040 --> 28:31.040
It's interesting to me, right?

28:31.040 --> 28:32.700
Because it is, I mean, he kind of speaks to it there.

28:32.700 --> 28:38.280
It's all about expectations and we're just so bad at being explicit about that and managing

28:38.280 --> 28:39.280
them.

28:39.280 --> 28:42.680
And once you've got these devices always on with you, you can check all the time.

28:42.680 --> 28:43.680
We're just not good at it.

28:43.680 --> 28:44.680
I think that's a bit of it.

28:44.680 --> 28:45.680
Yeah.

28:45.680 --> 28:50.600
It's definitely like, it's hard to set firm boundaries about like, Hey, uh, 7 p.m. till

28:50.600 --> 28:52.600
morning is my family time.

28:52.600 --> 28:57.520
That's not, that's a hard thing to not, especially as a man, because it seems sort of like not

28:57.520 --> 28:59.280
a common thing to ask for.

28:59.280 --> 29:04.320
Like, and the challenge here is the whole team knows we all have smartphones that your

29:04.320 --> 29:05.320
boss knows.

29:05.320 --> 29:06.320
You got a smartphone.

29:06.320 --> 29:09.880
Like everybody knows you've got an always on device that's getting these notifications.

29:09.880 --> 29:13.120
So if you're not reading it, you're opting not to read it.

29:13.120 --> 29:15.160
And some bosses don't respond very well to that.

29:15.160 --> 29:18.160
There are other situations where that's not, there's cultures where that's not acceptable.

29:18.160 --> 29:20.160
And I think it's really common.

29:20.160 --> 29:26.880
It's interesting though, um, from the Reddit co-founders comments here, particularly about

29:26.880 --> 29:31.520
the, uh, there's one line that I put out in her doc, all of us who decide to start a company

29:31.520 --> 29:37.720
were kind of broken as people, which, wow, a little obsessed might be, yeah, you could,

29:37.720 --> 29:39.640
another way to put it is you're a little obsessed with something.

29:39.640 --> 29:41.420
I mean, I think you know this too, right?

29:41.420 --> 29:45.880
You're driving forward and forward and forward and your competition is not standing still.

29:45.880 --> 29:46.880
Yeah.

29:46.880 --> 29:47.880
There's competition.

29:47.880 --> 29:51.340
There's also, um, just general adapting to the market constantly, especially when you're

29:51.340 --> 29:53.480
dealing with a business that's online.

29:53.480 --> 29:57.760
It's incredible how fast things change now, especially for the podcast market.

29:57.760 --> 29:59.040
Podcasts are just growing like crazy.

29:59.040 --> 30:01.800
Well, there's that new one where you have to subscribe, right?

30:01.800 --> 30:05.320
And they've got like Bethany McClain, like there's some crazy stuff going on in the podcasting

30:05.320 --> 30:06.320
world.

30:06.320 --> 30:09.640
Oh, you're going to get all kinds of things, especially with Spotify and Kimlet and a lot

30:09.640 --> 30:10.640
going on there.

30:10.640 --> 30:13.160
There's going to, there's going to be subscriptions and premium content.

30:13.160 --> 30:14.480
It's going to be just like Netflix.

30:14.480 --> 30:15.480
It's.

30:15.480 --> 30:16.480
Everyone wants a slice.

30:16.480 --> 30:17.480
Oh, that's not happening for us.

30:17.480 --> 30:18.800
We're always going to be free.

30:18.800 --> 30:20.520
The feeds always going to be easy to find.

30:20.520 --> 30:21.960
That's going to be our thing.

30:21.960 --> 30:30.600
But, um, I have not learned my lesson here and this is really hard for me to admit because

30:30.600 --> 30:32.200
this is super serious.

30:32.200 --> 30:37.040
It is literally like something, if I don't figure out, I'm eventually going to kill myself.

30:37.040 --> 30:40.240
And it's really humbling to admit that I'm too dumb to figure it out.

30:40.240 --> 30:48.160
Like I just, I'm just getting over another physical ailment that knocked me on my ass

30:48.160 --> 30:49.700
again.

30:49.700 --> 30:54.860
And it ironically affected me exactly in the way that the recovery of the last one did

30:54.860 --> 30:59.680
where my, my range of motion is limited.

30:59.680 --> 31:01.000
I can't get out of bed.

31:01.000 --> 31:02.320
I can't lift the children.

31:02.320 --> 31:03.480
I can't pick heavy up.

31:03.480 --> 31:05.680
I can't pick, pick up heavy objects.

31:05.680 --> 31:07.400
That's like, that's living your life right there.

31:07.400 --> 31:08.400
Right?

31:08.400 --> 31:09.400
Yeah.

31:09.400 --> 31:11.680
And it was exactly the same thing when I was recovering from the ruptured appendix and

31:11.680 --> 31:15.740
it's something happens and I don't take the warning signs and I just assume it's going

31:15.740 --> 31:16.740
to be okay.

31:16.740 --> 31:22.200
And I just keep pushing forward and even, even when I know, okay, this is your off ramp

31:22.200 --> 31:23.200
right here.

31:23.200 --> 31:24.200
I don't take it.

31:24.200 --> 31:31.640
And I keep going until I'm, until I am physically impaired, until I, until some sort of physical,

31:31.640 --> 31:32.680
I just won't stop.

31:32.680 --> 31:37.280
I will just keep taking it on more stress and more things until some sort of physical

31:37.280 --> 31:38.280
ailment.

31:38.280 --> 31:39.280
You're forced.

31:39.280 --> 31:41.320
I mean, no choice but to stop.

31:41.320 --> 31:42.320
Yeah.

31:42.320 --> 31:43.320
It's the hard wall.

31:43.320 --> 31:45.240
That's how, I mean, you just kind of kill yourself doing that.

31:45.240 --> 31:50.480
And I thought when I ended up in the hospital last September and I spent a hospital bill

31:50.480 --> 31:56.500
of $200,000 and seven days in the hospital, I thought, okay, well I guess I finally learned

31:56.500 --> 31:57.500
my lesson.

31:57.500 --> 31:58.500
I had to learn it the hard way.

31:58.500 --> 32:05.060
And then here I am again and I just, I just can't believe, I can't believe I let myself

32:05.060 --> 32:06.060
do it again.

32:06.060 --> 32:07.600
I wonder if part of, have you been conditioned?

32:07.600 --> 32:08.740
I mean before, right?

32:08.740 --> 32:13.400
You were running and managing this whole business and so it was, I mean, just seeing you at

32:13.400 --> 32:15.960
that time, it was, you were never off, right?

32:15.960 --> 32:18.600
You had stuff to think about and worry and shows to plan and you couldn't stop.

32:18.600 --> 32:19.800
You needed to keep going.

32:19.800 --> 32:24.200
I think it's also, I think it's a symptom of I haven't fully built like a lever I can

32:24.200 --> 32:27.560
pull where I can just be like, hey guys, I'm out for like five days and everything just

32:27.560 --> 32:28.560
continues.

32:28.560 --> 32:31.260
Because there's a few shows that's like, okay, well now we have to kind of scramble to figure

32:31.260 --> 32:35.240
out how to get content for and stuff like that that I'm still producing, like LUP, it's

32:35.240 --> 32:38.520
because it's kind of like the main show I do now.

32:38.520 --> 32:41.240
And if I'm gone, like how do you, what do we do with that?

32:41.240 --> 32:42.240
We don't have a solution.

32:42.240 --> 32:43.240
We still haven't figured that out.

32:43.240 --> 32:50.840
And I, there's other things, there's just other, I have other responsibilities now.

32:50.840 --> 32:51.840
It's a challenge.

32:51.840 --> 32:52.840
It's a real challenge.

32:52.840 --> 32:56.960
And I don't know what I'm going to, I just, I've got to learn this lesson.

32:56.960 --> 32:58.640
So learn from my mistakes, people.

32:58.640 --> 33:04.280
I think too, it's like we're subject to the fact that there's a lot of people who are

33:04.280 --> 33:06.240
sort of posturing online.

33:06.240 --> 33:11.360
They'll posture as this, and Ohanian touches on this too, they'll posture on all these

33:11.360 --> 33:16.260
things that glorify absurd things like, Oh, I'm, you know, I'm, I stay up, I stay awake

33:16.260 --> 33:17.960
at night worrying about this particular problem.

33:17.960 --> 33:21.560
You'll hear government officials say that all the time, or you'll hear about people

33:21.560 --> 33:23.880
that are burning the candle at both ends and they're proud of it.

33:23.880 --> 33:26.780
Like I got this out because I don't sleep, you know, like I don't sleep.

33:26.780 --> 33:30.120
That's such a, you know, a line of pride for so many people.

33:30.120 --> 33:34.120
And the irony is, is like, it's such a short term game and I am learning that so hard now

33:34.120 --> 33:38.980
as I get to my mid to late thirties, I'm learning that like, yeah, it really is true.

33:38.980 --> 33:42.580
Like there is a limited time you can just cash that check against your body.

33:42.580 --> 33:45.480
And it re like that debt really does come due.

33:45.480 --> 33:51.260
And the fact that our culture glorifies this posturing about staying up all night and under

33:51.260 --> 33:57.540
place things like self awareness and self care and nutrition is the real problem here.

33:57.540 --> 34:01.680
And I don't see it changing anytime soon unless somebody gets on the microphone and says,

34:01.680 --> 34:05.760
this is a real thing that as somebody who didn't pay attention to this is now at the

34:05.760 --> 34:08.000
other end of it saying, you better pay attention to this stuff.

34:08.000 --> 34:09.000
Yeah, the same thing.

34:09.000 --> 34:13.160
I mean, you remember Chris, we were doing the show, um, four years ago in 2015 I took

34:13.160 --> 34:15.600
a heart attack from this, right?

34:15.600 --> 34:21.880
And so this is like, I'm currently got some sort of sickness, but like sinus infection

34:21.880 --> 34:27.600
of some weird kind, but still working 14 hours a day cause yeah, it's at some point I think

34:27.600 --> 34:34.200
it's almost like becomes like a crazy addiction of like, you feel like you can't stop because

34:34.200 --> 34:40.880
if you stop, you know, you, first of all, I think it's easy to set up bad expectations

34:40.880 --> 34:47.040
with like customers and in your case, audiences, um, you know, clients, things like that where

34:47.040 --> 34:51.920
it's, you know, sometimes things are just going to be late, right?

34:51.920 --> 34:55.120
Sometimes you don't need to have three status meetings in a week.

34:55.120 --> 35:01.840
Um, I don't know, I, I constantly go back to, uh, bell labs invented Unix and the C

35:01.840 --> 35:06.980
programming language working nine to five with generous martini lunches, right?

35:06.980 --> 35:10.680
And somehow we can't build stupid little mobile apps without killing ourselves.

35:10.680 --> 35:11.680
Right.

35:11.680 --> 35:14.160
And we don't even pay attention to the science, right?

35:14.160 --> 35:16.960
It's the culture and the surface level appearances.

35:16.960 --> 35:21.280
Even when, you know, there's plenty of, plenty of good science and reasoning to suggest that

35:21.280 --> 35:24.720
we should manage ourselves a little better than that and play for the long haul, right?

35:24.720 --> 35:28.360
So you can be more productive, get more done instead of being constantly burnt out and

35:28.360 --> 35:31.960
slow because you haven't slept and can't think straight.

35:31.960 --> 35:32.960
Yeah.

35:32.960 --> 35:33.960
Yeah.

35:33.960 --> 35:34.960
Yeah.

35:34.960 --> 35:35.960
It's funny.

35:35.960 --> 35:36.960
I really think so much better.

35:36.960 --> 35:42.200
I, uh, I was doing some projects over the weekend and, uh, I've, I've probably set up

35:42.200 --> 35:48.920
a mount in FS tab a thousand times, but they, all three kids were in my office and they

35:48.920 --> 35:50.320
were all making different noises.

35:50.320 --> 35:51.320
They weren't even really talking.

35:51.320 --> 35:54.240
They were just making noises and their iPads were making noises.

35:54.240 --> 35:57.680
It took me 15 minutes to like figure out what I was doing wrong.

35:57.680 --> 36:01.800
I had to read this line a dozen times and then they, I finally said, Hey guys, would

36:01.800 --> 36:03.320
you mind playing in the other room for a minute?

36:03.320 --> 36:07.160
And when they left and it got quiet and I closed my eyes and I, and I look at it again.

36:07.160 --> 36:08.160
Oh geez.

36:08.160 --> 36:09.160
Really?

36:09.160 --> 36:10.160
God, this is it.

36:10.160 --> 36:11.160
Tossed down into that folder.

36:11.160 --> 36:12.160
It's one folder up.

36:12.160 --> 36:13.160
So stupid, Chris.

36:13.160 --> 36:14.160
Yeah.

36:14.160 --> 36:17.080
It really, I'm like, I have a totally different brain capacity sometimes and sleep plays a

36:17.080 --> 36:18.080
big part.

36:18.080 --> 36:19.080
Rest.

36:19.080 --> 36:22.720
I was just talking with our buddy Alex, uh, who's often on the Friday stream and makes

36:22.720 --> 36:23.720
it unplugged.

36:23.720 --> 36:27.540
He's an employee at Red Hat and, uh, as part of that, you know, they get a little vacay

36:27.540 --> 36:32.280
and he took it and he just got done doing a road trip, um, through like a Yellowstone

36:32.280 --> 36:33.280
and whatnot.

36:33.280 --> 36:38.800
And he said to me that, uh, about, uh, about three or four days into being there where

36:38.800 --> 36:39.800
they didn't have any connectivity.

36:39.800 --> 36:44.440
And he was just genuinely disconnected from work, um, that he started sleeping better.

36:44.440 --> 36:45.440
Right.

36:45.440 --> 36:46.440
Takes a couple of days.

36:46.440 --> 36:48.640
You gotta really get out of the habit once you realize, well, I can't, there's no point

36:48.640 --> 36:50.960
pulling my phone out cause I can't check anything.

36:50.960 --> 36:51.960
Yeah.

36:51.960 --> 36:55.640
He also said he was more focused and, uh, felt a little more creative when editing photos

36:55.640 --> 36:59.520
because he just sort of, not only was the lack of distractions, but it was like the

36:59.520 --> 37:04.080
accumulative effect of multiple days of lack of distraction and stress.

37:04.080 --> 37:05.080
Sounds like a fun experiment.

37:05.080 --> 37:10.400
But meetup is, uh, meetup, meetup.com slash Jupiter broadcasting is, um, if you haven't

37:10.400 --> 37:14.600
checked it out, is a page where you set up a bunch of different, uh, study group sessions

37:14.600 --> 37:17.760
and one that we have coming up pretty soon is really on point.

37:17.760 --> 37:20.520
Meetup.com slash Jupiter broadcasting.

37:20.520 --> 37:21.520
Understanding burnout.

37:21.520 --> 37:22.520
Yeah.

37:22.520 --> 37:24.520
This is going to be, I'm like looking forward to this.

37:24.520 --> 37:26.480
And so, uh, when is that?

37:26.480 --> 37:30.720
That is tomorrow before a Linux unplugged 1230 PM.

37:30.720 --> 37:33.040
So it could be, if you're getting this on a day this came out, it could be like right

37:33.040 --> 37:34.040
around there.

37:34.040 --> 37:38.800
Meetup.com slash Jupiter broadcasting because we have that and then when we will, and when

37:38.800 --> 37:42.200
we do post the video version of it, we'll update that meetup page.

37:42.200 --> 37:47.440
So even if you can't make it to the meetup, you could stay up to date by following it.

37:47.440 --> 37:52.560
And then down the road, we're going to do a security, um, presentation by, I think it's

37:52.560 --> 37:53.560
a Symantec employee.

37:53.560 --> 37:54.560
Oh yeah.

37:54.560 --> 37:56.960
Explaining some of their threat report internet studies.

37:56.960 --> 38:01.320
And then after that we're doing a five part series, at least that's the plan right now

38:01.320 --> 38:02.320
on AWS.

38:02.320 --> 38:04.400
Oh, there's a lot to cover there.

38:04.400 --> 38:05.400
Mm-hmm.

38:05.400 --> 38:06.400
Yeah.

38:06.400 --> 38:08.720
And we have a really, really, really, really, really sharp individual who's helping us put

38:08.720 --> 38:12.000
it together and we're doing some new stuff, new presentation style.

38:12.000 --> 38:13.160
It's really going to be good.

38:13.160 --> 38:14.880
We just put it all out there for free.

38:14.880 --> 38:17.680
So it might not all go on the channel though, so you'll want to stay tuned for that.

38:17.680 --> 38:18.680
Mixing that up.

38:18.680 --> 38:19.680
Yeah.

38:19.680 --> 38:22.600
But you can get all the past ones over on our regular Jupiter broadcasting channel.

38:22.600 --> 38:23.600
Yes.

38:23.600 --> 38:26.720
I feel like though, the one thing that's a little different about this whole go round

38:26.720 --> 38:32.080
that is, I feel like the silver lining of my most recent like issues is I'm much more

38:32.080 --> 38:36.440
aware of the process and I'm able to keep tabs and I'm like, oh, now I'm at this level

38:36.440 --> 38:37.560
and I'm not freaking out about it.

38:37.560 --> 38:40.480
I'm not strutting, but I'm like, oh yeah, I'm getting, I'm doing this again.

38:40.480 --> 38:43.920
Like I'm, I'm just, um, I'm staying, uh, what's, what would he call it?

38:43.920 --> 38:46.200
Um, you know, I'm just staying observant really.

38:46.200 --> 38:47.200
Yeah.

38:47.200 --> 38:48.200
You're aware of what you're thinking.

38:48.200 --> 38:49.200
Sure.

38:49.200 --> 38:51.040
You're, you know, you're not going to fix everything straight away, but you're at least thinking

38:51.040 --> 38:52.640
about and you're aware that this could happen.

38:52.640 --> 38:56.880
I feel like it's a form of mindfulness that sort of reduces the stress of it a little

38:56.880 --> 38:57.880
bit.

38:57.880 --> 39:02.920
So, and I like, I feel like because I've been through this, I kind of have a plan to off

39:02.920 --> 39:04.120
ramp.

39:04.120 --> 39:07.520
Next week I'm going to go on a road trip from Texas to Washington and I think that'll be

39:07.520 --> 39:09.000
a nice chance to unwind.

39:09.000 --> 39:10.000
I won't do any shows.

39:10.000 --> 39:12.120
I'll just, me and the lady will drive across country.

39:12.120 --> 39:14.600
It'll be a, it'll be a fast, hard drive.

39:14.600 --> 39:15.600
Open road.

39:15.600 --> 39:16.600
Yeah.

39:16.600 --> 39:17.600
Something a little different.

39:17.600 --> 39:18.600
Oh, that sounds great.

39:18.600 --> 39:21.200
I'll just either drive with the windows down, I think it'll be fine.

39:21.200 --> 39:22.200
So I'll be, I'll be all right.

39:22.200 --> 39:26.120
See, I like, I've planned my off ramps, like I know myself now and I think I know how to

39:26.120 --> 39:30.920
correct it before it becomes major bad, but I, uh, I let it go for too long.

39:30.920 --> 39:31.920
It's easy to do.

39:31.920 --> 39:33.680
I mean, there's a lot to do and it's, I mean, I think it's especially hard when you care

39:33.680 --> 39:35.320
about what you do, right?

39:35.320 --> 39:38.800
Because you're, you're extra driven and you can't, can't turn it off.

39:38.800 --> 39:39.800
Yeah.

39:39.800 --> 39:40.800
That's true.

39:40.800 --> 39:41.800
You don't, it doesn't turn off.

39:41.800 --> 39:42.800
It don't turn off.

39:42.800 --> 39:43.800
Do you have any, any tips, Mike?

39:43.800 --> 39:46.920
When you, when you need to find your off ramp or do you do any, um, communicating around,

39:46.920 --> 39:50.920
you know, communication expectations or any of that with people you work with?

39:50.920 --> 39:51.920
Yeah.

39:51.920 --> 39:58.560
I try to like, well, I'm trying now to run a better processes that basically don't have

39:58.560 --> 40:03.440
hard dates that are going to be impossible, particularly when you have dependencies on

40:03.440 --> 40:06.920
either other vendors or, you know, the customer.

40:06.920 --> 40:07.920
That's a big deal.

40:07.920 --> 40:08.920
Right.

40:08.920 --> 40:09.920
Steph, that's kind of out of your control.

40:09.920 --> 40:14.560
Any listeners who are feeling burned out and want to offload some.net or mobile development,

40:14.560 --> 40:15.560
call the mad botter.

40:15.560 --> 40:16.560
Hey, what's the best way for them?

40:16.560 --> 40:17.560
What's the best way for them to reach you?

40:17.560 --> 40:20.640
Uh, go to the mad botter.com.

40:20.640 --> 40:21.640
That could be a great way.

40:21.640 --> 40:24.640
If somebody is struggling with a project, why not hire Mike and his team to do it?

40:24.640 --> 40:25.640
Yeah, let Mike do it.

40:25.640 --> 40:26.920
They know what they're doing.

40:26.920 --> 40:27.920
And if you love F-sharp.

40:27.920 --> 40:28.920
Yeah.

40:28.920 --> 40:29.920
Oh, what now?

40:29.920 --> 40:34.140
All the latest and greatest functional techniques to make sure you get your project quickly

40:34.140 --> 40:36.120
and probably on time.

40:36.120 --> 40:40.120
If you're looking for just a good time, by the way, call one, no, I'm serious.

40:40.120 --> 40:42.200
No, actually, no, check out the Friday stream.

40:42.200 --> 40:43.200
I thought it was one nine.

40:43.200 --> 40:45.060
No, it is now.

40:45.060 --> 40:46.240
Check out the Friday stream.

40:46.240 --> 40:47.920
Friday stream.com.

40:47.920 --> 40:51.200
The one good thing about Mondays is the Friday stream is published.

40:51.200 --> 40:55.960
We stream it live on Fridays, except for this Friday, and then we publish it on Mondays.

40:55.960 --> 40:58.400
And you, you went up against Drew, wasn't it?

40:58.400 --> 40:59.400
Oh, yeah.

40:59.400 --> 41:00.400
Drew and I.

41:00.400 --> 41:02.080
To compete for a game for an audience member.

41:02.080 --> 41:06.320
And I don't want to say who won, but let's just say there's a lot on the line.

41:06.320 --> 41:07.320
There was a lot on the line.

41:07.320 --> 41:08.320
Oh, man.

41:08.320 --> 41:09.320
West had lost a previous one.

41:09.320 --> 41:10.320
Ooh.

41:10.320 --> 41:12.040
I had my honor and self-respect on the line.

41:12.040 --> 41:13.040
Yeah.

41:13.040 --> 41:16.120
And if you're looking for a new gig, maybe where you're working at right now is burning

41:16.120 --> 41:17.120
you out.

41:17.120 --> 41:18.320
Linux Academy is hiring.

41:18.320 --> 41:23.080
You can go to jobs.lever.co slash Linux Academy or just go to linuxacademy.com and they got

41:23.080 --> 41:24.320
a careers link way down on the bottom of the page.

41:24.320 --> 41:25.880
And we'll have it on the show notes, too.

41:25.880 --> 41:26.880
That's true.

41:26.880 --> 41:27.880
We'll have a link in the show notes.

41:27.880 --> 41:28.880
Great pay, benefits.

41:28.880 --> 41:29.880
You get to work remotely.

41:29.880 --> 41:30.880
And you get to hang out with us.

41:30.880 --> 41:34.340
Like we're, at the end of this week, we're going to a big old company event.

41:34.340 --> 41:35.340
Come hang out with West and I.

41:35.340 --> 41:36.340
Yeah, that's right.

41:36.340 --> 41:40.320
And, I mean, you know, you get to work on a pretty cool platform that helps people learn

41:40.320 --> 41:41.320
stuff.

41:41.320 --> 41:42.320
That's true.

41:42.320 --> 41:43.320
There are worse things to do.

41:43.320 --> 41:44.320
Yeah.

41:44.320 --> 41:45.320
And it's a, it's a cool platform, too.

41:45.320 --> 41:46.320
You get to hang out.

41:46.320 --> 41:47.720
That's over in the show notes, as West pointed out.

41:47.720 --> 41:48.720
Oh, yeah.

41:48.720 --> 41:53.480
And, well, if you want more Coder Radio, we've got the whole backlog, coder.show.

41:53.480 --> 41:58.860
You can find this particular episode, number 363, right there, too, and all the rest.

41:58.860 --> 42:04.040
You want a whole bunch of other great shows, some of them, with Chris, well, jupiterbroadcasting.com

42:04.040 --> 42:10.200
has all of that and links to just about everything else, including the calendar page.

42:10.200 --> 42:12.480
That's where you can find out when we're here live.

42:12.480 --> 42:16.960
We do this show every week, just about 12 p.m. Pacific.

42:16.960 --> 42:20.480
And the magic of Google and the internet, well, it'll tell you whatever that is in your

42:20.480 --> 42:22.380
time zone of choice.

42:22.380 --> 42:26.640
If that's still not enough content, well, you can also find us on Twitter.

42:26.640 --> 42:27.640
I'm at Westpane.

42:27.640 --> 42:28.640
Mike, you're?

42:28.640 --> 42:29.640
At Dubinuko.

42:29.640 --> 42:30.640
And Chris?

42:30.640 --> 42:31.640
I'm at ChrisLAS.

42:31.640 --> 42:33.480
Yes, you are.

42:33.480 --> 42:37.820
We've also got a network account at Jupiter Signal.

Come join us here live next week.
