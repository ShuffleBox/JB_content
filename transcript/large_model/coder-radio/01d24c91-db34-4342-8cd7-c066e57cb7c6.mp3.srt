00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
This is KOTORadio, episode 468 for May 30th, 2022.

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:19,040
Hey, good looking and welcome back to Jupiter Broadcasting's weekly talk show, taking a

3
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:24,680
pragmatic look at the art and the business of software development in the world of technology.

4
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:30,200
My name is Chris, and toughen it out like the pro podcaster he is, it's our host, Mr.

5
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:31,200
Dominic.

6
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:32,200
Hello, Mike.

7
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:33,200
What's up?

8
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,080
Questionable restaurant food is still questionable.

9
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:36,560
No.

10
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:37,560
Food poisoning?

11
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:39,000
So you and I talked earlier.

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,760
I'm hoping it's not the Rona.

13
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:42,040
That's one of the things with the new Rona.

14
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:43,040
I've heard.

15
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:44,040
I've heard.

16
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:45,040
Mm-hmm.

17
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:46,680
You know, the new improved Rona.

18
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:51,000
Well, if it is Rona, this would be round three, which I think is unfair.

19
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,560
Seriously, three?

20
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:53,560
Totally unfair.

21
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:54,560
Totally unfair.

22
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:57,000
I know a couple of people who are on round three right now.

23
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,160
I'm drinking tonic without the gin just to settle my stomach.

24
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:02,160
Must taste weird.

25
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:03,160
All right?

26
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:06,280
Like when you always have a drink with alcohol in it, then you go to drink it without alcohol,

27
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:07,280
it totally tastes weird.

28
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:10,680
It's much sweeter than I would have thought.

29
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:11,680
Yeah.

30
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:14,840
Well, you got to get healed up because, you know, next week's a game week.

31
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:20,080
It's big week next week, WWDC, the only developer conference that has any hype.

32
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,080
Let's apple it up.

33
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:22,080
Yeah.

34
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:23,940
But we don't have to worry about that right now.

35
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:27,840
This week, this week, we're going to we're just going to put that out of our minds for

36
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:28,840
a little bit.

37
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:30,320
We're going to focus on some feedback.

38
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:35,920
Nuclear Nick writes in and he says that work from home study smells a little suspicious.

39
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:40,240
He says you guys recently discussed a study which concluded that the developer productivity

40
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:42,320
is not hampered by remote work.

41
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:43,800
I agree with you guys.

42
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:45,600
That is complete BS.

43
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:50,800
I work at a medium-sized fintech that offered three days remote per week as an option.

44
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:54,320
On any given day, there would be at least 20 engineers in the office.

45
00:01:54,320 --> 00:02:00,040
The amount of incidental learning, impromptu brainstorming, et cetera, was just unbelievably

46
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:01,140
satisfying.

47
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:02,560
Things like, it looks like you're stuck.

48
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:04,280
Do you need a rubber duck?

49
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:06,600
Could I get your thoughts on this tricky problem?

50
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:08,680
And other things like, what are you folks busy with?

51
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:10,620
Oh, I have seen this before.

52
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:14,520
And more than just these, there was just no way a junior dev could have possibly had the

53
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:18,080
same experience onboarding as before if he's remote.

54
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:19,080
Love the show.

55
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:20,080
Keep up the great work.

56
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,080
Thank you, circular Nick.

57
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:23,960
I know you're done talking about remote work, but they just keep bringing it back.

58
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:24,960
I know.

59
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:29,680
I think the part about junior devs mentoring is super strong.

60
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,960
That's definitely, it's just not the same.

61
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:34,480
You touched on that, and I think it's your strongest point.

62
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:38,360
We did get some emails in that also are like, you know, by the way, it's really great for

63
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:41,040
people with accessibility issues to work from home.

64
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,040
There's a big perk there.

65
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:43,040
And I get that.

66
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:44,040
Yeah.

67
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:45,040
For sure.

68
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,040
Yeah.

69
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:47,040
All right.

70
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,040
I just thought that was interesting to add to the conversation.

71
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:49,120
I feel like we've talked it to death.

72
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:51,940
So moving on, Donald's writing in.

73
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:55,040
He wrote in years ago, years ago, looking for guidance.

74
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:59,320
He says, hello, Chris and Mike, a longtime fan, been listening since season one.

75
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:02,280
I like the idea of calling the first run of the show season one.

76
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,280
Ooh, season one.

77
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,280
I like it.

78
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:05,280
It's a hell of a season though.

79
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,280
What is that like?

80
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:07,280
Yeah.

81
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,280
All right.

82
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:09,280
But I'll take it.

83
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,280
I'm with you, Donnie.

84
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:11,280
I'm with you.

85
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:16,560
He says, I wrote back in 2012, 2013 about my anxieties about finding a job while I was

86
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,460
studying at a university.

87
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:24,000
Since then, I graduated and I have been working as a software engineer for seven years.

88
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,320
Give me a, give me a bell.

89
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:26,320
Give me a bell.

90
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:27,320
I know, right?

91
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:28,320
Do it.

92
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:29,320
Coderadio success story.

93
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:30,320
Right here.

94
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:31,320
Donald.

95
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:32,320
He says, you were right.

96
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:33,320
There was work to be found.

97
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:37,720
However, like a lot of software engineers, I find the anxiety never really goes away.

98
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:42,560
Hearing about GitHub Copilot, GPT-3 and other automated code generators, whatever you want

99
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,280
to call them.

100
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:47,500
How do we just stay relevant to make sure we won't be out of a job and say three to

101
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:49,400
five or 10 years down the line.

102
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,400
Love the show.

103
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,400
Keep up the new work.

104
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:54,080
So he just went from worrying about one thing to the next, but it is a common question we

105
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,080
get.

106
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:56,160
No, dog, I get you.

107
00:03:56,160 --> 00:04:02,240
So my new fiance has introduced me to hip hop and not my genre of choice, but there's

108
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:05,840
a song and somebody will put it in the chat room because I know I'm sure you guys love

109
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:06,840
it.

110
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:11,440
It's, you know, you was coding to, it's rapping, but you was coding to just for the hell of

111
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:12,440
it.

112
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:13,440
Now you're coding to stay relevant.

113
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,440
That's the challenge, right?

114
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:15,440
You did it for fun.

115
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:16,740
It was your hobby.

116
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:22,020
And now, you know, all the big boys are, I just want to say when I started my business,

117
00:04:22,020 --> 00:04:28,060
my software consulting business, I never thought that PricewaterhouseCooper, the giant accounting

118
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:32,400
firm would be a competitor, but they certainly are.

119
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:38,160
They just opened an office here in Tampa for technical consulting for dev basically.

120
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:43,440
It's just the way it is, Don, you're going to be, you're going to be chasing this dragon

121
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:44,440
forever.

122
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:50,000
And yeah, I mean, as people have realized how important this stuff is, they're trying

123
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,680
to make tools to lower their economic costs, right?

124
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:58,240
Although I will say GitHub co-pilot, I would, Dan, yeah, no, that's not gonna, don't worry

125
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,240
about that.

126
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:00,240
Yeah.

127
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,920
It feels like as time goes on, it's less of a threat and more of a technology demo, right?

128
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:03,920
I feel like it's dumb.

129
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:04,920
Maybe I'm just mean.

130
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:05,920
I just think it's stupid.

131
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:06,920
It's a waste of resources.

132
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:07,920
No, I agree.

133
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:12,680
It does seem like it's sort of, I think it's a show off piece, right?

134
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:13,680
It's a.

135
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,440
Look how epic we are.

136
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:20,320
And would you like some Azure, please, please buy some Azure Harold.

137
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:23,800
He spots shenanigans and he writes in about it and he writes, remember me, I told you

138
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:28,400
about bru successor T the package manager that raised a lot of money and it has some

139
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,560
web three lingo in it.

140
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:30,560
Well guess what?

141
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:32,920
The lingo, it spreads.

142
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:35,800
It's been picked up by JFrog, Docker, and Oracle and some others.

143
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,200
Check out.

144
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:39,200
I'm going to say Pyrus.

145
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,200
I don't know.

146
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:42,360
Actually, I'm just, this sounds so dumb.

147
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:43,920
I think it's Pyrus.

148
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:44,920
Yeah, I know.

149
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:47,920
I was trying to think of like parasite or something like a play on that, but it's P Y

150
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:49,920
R S I A dot IO.

151
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:50,920
Pysra.

152
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:51,920
It's got to be Pysra.

153
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:52,920
Pysra.

154
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:53,920
Yeah.

155
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:57,280
They pitch themselves as the decentralized package network, the open source software

156
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:00,920
that helps protect the open source supply chain.

157
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:01,920
Here's what they say it does.

158
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:07,040
So JFrog and other open source technology leaders, including Docker, deploy hub, futureway

159
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:14,240
and Oracle work together to establish project pariah to network and validate the sources

160
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:17,300
and security of open source software packages.

161
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:21,240
It aims to seamlessly integrate with the package management systems to develop that developers

162
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:22,760
are already using today.

163
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:26,720
So they're going to integrate somehow with package managers, the developers already use

164
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:27,720
today.

165
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:32,160
So that way they say they can certify their software components without foregoing compatibility,

166
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:38,440
security or efficiency, and to help developers and guide them on the process of using this

167
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:44,800
to validate their software components, a select few entities will build and publish images

168
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:51,880
that will be available for everyone's use, otherwise known as bootstrapping the project.

169
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:54,960
What the hell are they talking about, dude?

170
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:57,000
I can't put it together.

171
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,720
I have no idea.

172
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:03,880
I think this is all just nonsense, right, cashing in on what I'm hoping is the end of

173
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:06,400
the VC drunken bender.

174
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:12,960
So Google just recently announced that for Google Cloud customers, they're going to offer

175
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:16,640
repos of common popular open source projects that they vetted.

176
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:20,600
So Google, it checks the project out, it runs it through all of their internal, which is

177
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:25,280
a litany of tests that they use, validates that it's secure, and then posts it up for

178
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:27,200
Google Cloud users to use.

179
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:31,880
And I wonder if this isn't like a response to that, if this isn't these companies getting

180
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:32,880
together.

181
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:35,840
What really throws this sideways for me is the fact that Oracle's in there, I'm not going

182
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:37,140
to lie.

183
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:41,040
It feels like there's got to be like some sort of weird blockchain angle to this that

184
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:45,880
they're just not telling us about, because they talked consistently about how important

185
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:50,200
the open source supply chain is and how it's a critical issue and how they got to secure

186
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:51,200
it.

187
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:55,880
Well, but is it not just fear mongering to make a buck, right?

188
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:56,880
Could be.

189
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:57,880
We've had some stories.

190
00:07:57,880 --> 00:08:02,840
What was that kid a couple weeks ago or months ago who intentionally borked his own package

191
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:06,160
just to screw with people he didn't like?

192
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:08,480
And we've had bugs in other libraries.

193
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:12,280
I feel like, you know what, Silicon Valley, right?

194
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:17,960
The sales lady tells the CEO of Pied Piper, corporations are pussies.

195
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:18,960
They are, right?

196
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:21,900
If you could tell them it's a security thing, it's a liability thing, they'll basically

197
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:22,900
hand you money.

198
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:23,900
Yeah.

199
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:24,900
This is a money grab.

200
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:28,240
This is a money grab while the free money building's falling down, right?

201
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:30,720
They ran in, they got a little money and they're running out possibly.

202
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:31,720
All right.

203
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:32,720
I'll go with that.

204
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:37,160
And then I'll mention that this London meetup we talked about last week, I think this thing's

205
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:38,160
happening.

206
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:39,160
I think it's happening.

207
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:40,160
55 people are now signed up.

208
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:41,160
Cheerio, bitches.

209
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:42,160
Yeah.

210
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:43,160
Yeah.

211
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:45,560
I think it's happening.

212
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:50,480
55 people have signed up and I think it's still getting sorted out, but there's a great

213
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:54,740
opportunity to get involved and start talking with people, get some plans.

214
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:59,660
There's already comments trickling in, so London meetup provisional with Alex from Self

215
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:03,680
Hosted and the community, Saturday, August 6th, 2022.

216
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:07,400
Mike and I won't be there, but one day, one day I hope we get out there.

217
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:08,400
That's right.

218
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:12,760
We have to get even with those bastards, those redcoats for what they did to us in the Revolutionary

219
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:13,760
War.

220
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:17,280
You know, my thought is with that is maybe they were right.

221
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:18,280
You know?

222
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:19,280
You know what?

223
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:20,280
I'll take it.

224
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:25,360
I'll take it with the Queen.

225
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:26,960
Linode.com slash coder.

226
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:31,400
Go there to get $100 in 60 day credit on a new account and you go there to support the

227
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:32,400
show.

228
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:35,560
Linode is fast, reliable cloud hosting, perfect for developers.

229
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:37,040
You got to try it for your next project.

230
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:40,520
It's what we use for everything we've deployed in the last couple of years.

231
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:45,480
I was using it last night, deploying a new server, and I always love doing that because

232
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:47,600
there's always something new to try.

233
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:52,720
This time we were putting NixOS on our Linode, something we want to experiment with, and

234
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:58,000
they have a handy guide that they updated semi-recently to help us figure it all out.

235
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,560
It took us a little bit because we tried to do it the hard way and then we realized there's

236
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:05,200
actually a much simpler way to do it.

237
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:07,600
What's so great about Linode is it's one click deployment stuff.

238
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:12,580
If you want something just really approachable, I'm talking like a lot of common open source

239
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:18,160
and free software applications, GitLab, Jitsi, ZoomKiller type stuff, you know, just really

240
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:22,560
good productivity apps like NextCloud and a bunch of gaming stuff and all kinds of stuff

241
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:25,320
for developer back end tools that I never really mentioned on the show, but they're

242
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:26,320
all there.

243
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,320
They're worth checking out.

244
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:30,120
It's a great way to support the show too, but you can go all the way down to the metal

245
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:32,000
if you want, and that's what I love about Linode.

246
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,160
They let you go as far as you want.

247
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:38,320
Plus they got 11 data centers around the world, fantastic performance, and I hear that the

248
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,320
support is great.

249
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:40,960
I've never really had any trouble.

250
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:43,880
Their documentation's always really been able to cover anything I needed.

251
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:47,200
One time when I was creating like a monster server, they're like contact support and let

252
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,200
us know what you're doing.

253
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:52,600
And that was a great experience, but I'll have in the show notes, I'll have a link to

254
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:54,100
a white paper.

255
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:55,100
It's really an ebook.

256
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:56,100
It's not a white paper.

257
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:58,520
It's an ebook that Linode has published.

258
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:04,080
It's a free ebook that covers infrastructure as code, and it's a step-by-step guide and

259
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:07,520
a high level look at Terraform, Ansible, Puppet, Chef, and Salt.

260
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:11,400
If you're kind of curious if there's something maybe from one of these tools or a couple

261
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:15,640
of these tools combined that you could use to make your infrastructure better, maybe

262
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:19,340
a little more consistent, a little easier to deploy, a little quicker to deploy, more

263
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:23,120
consistent backend infrastructure, this ebook's pretty good.

264
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:25,840
I've gotten some great feedback last time I mentioned this on the show, so I'm gonna

265
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:26,840
give it another plug.

266
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:31,480
Go learn about Terraform and Ansible and Puppet, Chef, and Salt in Linode's Infrastructure

267
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:32,480
as Code ebook.

268
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:34,700
We'll have a link in the show notes, totes free.

269
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:35,840
Don't even need to give them your info.

270
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:38,680
You just, I'll have a link directly to it in the show notes, and they've got all kinds

271
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:42,480
of great resources like that over at Linode, including a weekly security digest and all

272
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:46,600
kinds of stuff that just covers the industry in the nuts and bolts stuff, so if you're

273
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:49,320
in the space, it's something you need to know about.

274
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:50,320
Linode's all over it.

275
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:51,360
It's part of the job.

276
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:53,960
It's all just part of what makes them a great host.

277
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:56,240
Go check them out, support the show, and try something.

278
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:57,840
Go learn something.

279
00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:02,280
Linode.com slash coder.

280
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:07,520
So Build 2022 was last week, and there was some things.

281
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:11,460
There was some things, but probably the thing that I thought would be the most interesting

282
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:16,520
to chat with you about is how Microsoft seems to be really going in on Project Volterra,

283
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:19,760
which is this ARM-based mini PC designed for Windows developers.

284
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:26,160
It's gonna have a Qualcomm Snapdragon in there, and they're making a big stink about the fact

285
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:28,360
that it has a neural processing unit.

286
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:32,240
In fact, Microsoft's gonna build some facilities into Windows.

287
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:36,880
Surface Pro X has the SQ1, which was co-developed by Qualcomm as well.

288
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:43,400
They're really going all in on NPUs, and Microsoft said in a quote, one of their devs, or actually

289
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:50,280
he's an EVP, they expect NPUs, neural processing units, to be built into most, if not all future

290
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:54,680
devices, phones, desktop, servers, everything, and we're gonna make it easy for developers

291
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:59,560
to leverage these new capabilities by baking support for NPUs into the next end-to-end

292
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:00,560
Windows platform.

293
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:02,880
That's nice, it doesn't matter.

294
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:03,880
No?

295
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:04,880
Nope.

296
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:09,040
The M1 will always be better for the foreseeable future.

297
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:13,220
This might not be shocking, but the developers who don't use Windows, which I think are frankly

298
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:18,320
a lot of them and a good percentage of our audience here, are not using Windows because

299
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:20,100
they really need a neural processor.

300
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:23,560
They're not using Windows because it's goddamn Windows.

301
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:25,360
I agree with you there.

302
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:31,960
I feel like when you got Apple and Microsoft really pushing neural processing stuff on

303
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:35,200
their platforms, I think you will actually see it take off.

304
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:39,920
See I disagree that it doesn't matter because I don't think the neural processor has made

305
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,320
much of a difference.

306
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:42,720
They both have the same problem.

307
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:43,720
New?

308
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:45,760
No, they're proprietary.

309
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:49,720
So if I'm selling a customer, and we do it all the time, right?

310
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:54,680
We have the folks in Canada, we have Raspberry Pis and Surface tablets, but the big problem

311
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:58,200
with the Surface tablets is that they're Windows.

312
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:00,200
Same thing with anything Apple-powered, right?

313
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:05,360
iPads are great, except, oh my God, code signing is a bitch and you have to deal with Apple's

314
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:11,960
nonsense and somebody might get a new MacBook and, oh, you didn't save the private key and

315
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:16,280
now you can't code sign, now you got to reinstall the app manually.

316
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:20,240
I agree, I guess, that neural processing is going to be important, but it's going to be

317
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:23,840
important on BSD or Linux.

318
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:28,520
No one's going to be out there selling, except for the super high end, people that don't

319
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:33,640
care about the licensing and restrictions, Microsoft and Apple devices.

320
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:36,440
Now I'm going to twist this on you a little.

321
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:42,520
To me, the real sadness is iPads could dominate the enterprise.

322
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:49,680
If Apple would just let go of their restrictions on self-published app deployment, it just

323
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:50,760
needs to be open.

324
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:53,720
You just need to be able to write an app.

325
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:57,800
Install it on a bunch of devices and not have to do the code signing, not have to, oh, you

326
00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:02,960
have more than a thousand people, well, now you have to, you know, do, what is it they

327
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:06,400
required the enterprise certificate, I forgot the name for the certificate, there's like

328
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:13,960
a certification process and you have to renew it every year and it's just, ugh, you know,

329
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:19,320
an iPad dies, you get a new iPad, now you have to deregister one, it's a whole manual,

330
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:20,760
terrible process.

331
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:22,240
I agree.

332
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:29,160
I think it's still fascinating from how is it going to compare to the M1 or really, potentially

333
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:34,520
since WWDC is next week, how is it going to compare to the M2, so that's going to be fascinating.

334
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:37,720
What's it like because you're going to be able to run desktop applications on this thing,

335
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:41,200
you're going to be able to run IDEs, you're going to be able to do a comparison of what

336
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:45,320
it feels like to use these applications on these two different platforms.

337
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:50,640
I agree with you and, you know, I'm not saying that Microsoft does everything wrong.

338
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:53,960
How's Mavi going, did we mention Mavi?

339
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:56,400
No, check that box off.

340
00:15:56,400 --> 00:16:01,360
Also, may I have my $40,000 back for Windows Phone, please?

341
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:04,000
You know what's funny to me about this, so you're kind of touching on it, doesn't it

342
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:10,000
kind of feel like part of what Build was about and part of what Google IO was about was bringing

343
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:14,640
back old stuff they've tried before that didn't work because along with this ARM box, right,

344
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:19,080
they announced, oh and yeah, we're going to get Visual Studio 2022 ported to ARM, we're

345
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:21,720
going to get Visual Studio Code, we're going to get Windows Terminal.

346
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:25,160
Wasn't it 2019 that was supposed to work on ARM, am I mistaken?

347
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:26,640
I feel like that was a promise.

348
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:27,760
Yep, you're right.

349
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:30,960
And now they're saying, but now, and Teams, of course, you got to get Teams on ARM, we're

350
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:32,280
going to get all this and it's...

351
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:38,760
I went to the mechanic today, they called me, they wanted their $1,000 because they

352
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:41,120
can't do anything correctly.

353
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:47,360
But these new Firestone tires I'm buying come with Teams for free and Office 365.

354
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:49,800
Hey, yeah, comes bundled with a year of Teams.

355
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:57,400
Teams can run apparently on everything, petrified rubber, my son's butt when he's pooping, Teams

356
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:58,400
is there.

357
00:16:58,400 --> 00:16:59,400
It's there, man.

358
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:00,400
You can send an emoji, a poop emoji.

359
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:04,640
You know, and if you need to store your files, you can do that too.

360
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:08,280
Let's be honest, don't we all need to be in a team?

361
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:10,160
I want to be part of a team, you know.

362
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:11,160
See?

363
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:12,160
They should have called it tribes.

364
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:13,160
No.

365
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:17,480
Also, they mentioned they're doing the move that Apple did where they're going to reach

366
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:23,040
to different Python projects and LLVM and other large infrastructure projects to try

367
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:28,000
to get them to port their stuff over to this Windows ARM platform.

368
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,640
Microsoft following Apple since 1982.

369
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:36,680
Well, if you don't like buying hardware, Microsoft also announced the Microsoft DevBox, a cloud

370
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:41,080
service that includes applications and services designed for developers to quickly access

371
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:43,460
pre-configured developer workstations.

372
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:47,100
It's built on top of the foundations of Windows 365.

373
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:50,040
The DevBox will work via any modern browser.

374
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:54,720
It supports integrated IDEs, software development kits, or any other tool that you can run on

375
00:17:54,720 --> 00:18:01,080
top of Windows, and they pitch it to the CTOs out there, to the boss man, as the Microsoft

376
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:06,520
DevBox lets teams create and maintain DevBox images with all the tools and dependencies

377
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:10,000
their devs need to build and run their applications.

378
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:14,840
Devs can include their application source code and nightly built binaries, enabling

379
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:22,360
devs to immediately start running and understanding the code without having to wait for long rebuilds.

380
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:24,160
You're going to make your team more efficient now.

381
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:29,360
Stop buying them Thalios and Macbooks and start just giving them a web browser with

382
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:30,640
a Microsoft DevBox.

383
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:32,760
It's not going to happen.

384
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:33,760
No?

385
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:36,400
I mean, it could be perfect for a guy like you.

386
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,440
You don't even have to wait now for the hardware to arrive.

387
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:40,640
Supply chain issues?

388
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:47,160
It requires them to have a good internet connection, and we live in America.

389
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:50,160
Of course, because it's Microsoft too, you're going to be able to manage it with things

390
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:54,880
like Intune and Microsoft Endpoint Manager, so the idea is IT admins could mass provision

391
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:59,880
these things, and the public preview will be available in the next few months.

392
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:04,680
This is cool for the enterprise, but for little guys like us, do you know that every employee

393
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:07,200
you hire in Alabama has a good internet connection?

394
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:09,480
No, yeah, I agree.

395
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:13,840
I mean, it is probably more common when you're hiring for a high-tech industry.

396
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:16,880
It's probably more common that they have a good connection.

397
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:22,980
I know we have listeners out there that are working on the daily in a cloud-based session.

398
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:23,980
Maybe it's Citrix.

399
00:19:23,980 --> 00:19:24,980
Maybe it's something else.

400
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:26,480
Well, we had the cloud nine, right?

401
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:27,480
We talked about cloud nine.

402
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:32,600
People would just literally, their IDE is a cloud IDE in Safari or Chrome or whatever.

403
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:34,400
I want to get some real-world impressions.

404
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,820
Send us an email or send us a boost.

405
00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:41,720
Just in and let us know how is working in the cloud, like in a remote cloud session,

406
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:42,840
how is it day-to-day?

407
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:44,200
Have you had issues?

408
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:46,240
Is this something people are interested in?

409
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:51,120
Because I'm so disconnected from the Windows world, I don't really know, but to me, I can

410
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:55,080
only see the value in a scenario where you actually have people coming into the office,

411
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:59,280
and then they remote into this occasionally from home, and they get the same environment,

412
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:03,160
but in the office, you could actually ensure that they have the right equipment, they have

413
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:06,640
the right connection, and then they have a remote session if they need it to work from

414
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:07,640
home.

415
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:08,640
Couldn't they just use a laptop then though?

416
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:13,080
Like they have, they take their laptop home with them and right, it's the same thing.

417
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:14,080
Yeah.

418
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:18,800
I think this is maybe the effort to replace the laptop.

419
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:23,520
You know, I think corporations like it because it keeps all your data behind their wall.

420
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:24,520
Well, right.

421
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:28,480
You fire somebody, you just flip a switch, literally a toggle under their name and they're

422
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:29,480
gone, right?

423
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:30,480
And they can't touch it.

424
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:33,920
And that's going to be handy over the summer, right?

425
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:35,600
Not to be crass about it.

426
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:39,720
But there is an element of being able to just turn it off and all your data is safe.

427
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:43,600
All your secrets.

428
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:45,860
Tailscale.com slash coder.

429
00:20:45,860 --> 00:20:48,680
Go there to get a free personal account for up to 20 devices.

430
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:50,560
And of course you support the show.

431
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:53,160
Tailscale is a zero config VPN.

432
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:55,160
It installs on any device in minutes.

433
00:20:55,160 --> 00:21:00,040
In fact, if you haven't put it on all your devices yet, go take five minutes and get

434
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:01,040
it going.

435
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:04,400
That's legit all you're going to need to get Tailscale up and connected and build your

436
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:07,160
own flat, decentralized network.

437
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:11,880
I was building something sneaky this weekend, something I didn't want to put out there publicly

438
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:15,800
yet, but I wanted to be able to get the DNS right and make sure the web app was resolving.

439
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:20,240
Actually, I wanted to set everything up, even like email notifications about new accounts,

440
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:21,240
all of that.

441
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:24,160
And I was doing it all behind Tailscale this weekend.

442
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:30,400
It's a WireGuard powered mesh VPN that is absurdly quick and simple to get up and going.

443
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,240
You're really going to be impressed.

444
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:35,880
When I hear about friends struggling getting WireGuard up and going or getting OpenVPN

445
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:40,920
up and going, I just tell them about Tailscale.

446
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:42,520
It's an always on VPN.

447
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:44,080
They're super clever about the routing.

448
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:46,760
They'll support DNS if you want to go that direction.

449
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:51,400
And you can get it up for free for 20 devices when you go to tailscale.com slash coder.

450
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:53,960
I have it running on just about everything I own, really.

451
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:58,760
From my iOS devices to my Raspberry Pis running Arch and OpenSUSE.

452
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:00,080
I have it on my VPSs.

453
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:01,660
I have it on VMware.

454
00:22:01,660 --> 00:22:03,160
I have it on Proxmox.

455
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:07,300
I've got it on a machine that's just running in boxes, like all of them, right?

456
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:09,320
It's so, so perfect for my needs.

457
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:11,440
I didn't even really appreciate it at first.

458
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:13,720
Initially, I just kind of thought it was, oh, I'll get to my web apps.

459
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:15,400
Oh, I can do support for my family.

460
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:17,520
And then I just kept building on top of that.

461
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:18,840
I think you will too.

462
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:22,960
And you can use it for free up to 20 devices when you go to tailscale.com slash coder.

463
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:26,680
They also write on their blog about how they keep that plan sustainable.

464
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:29,920
So those free plans don't compete with the paid plans.

465
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:33,400
They have a lot of long-term thinking in their planning, and I like that too.

466
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:40,280
Go try them out and support the show, tailscale.com slash coder.

467
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:46,120
Well your dreams may be coming true because Cydia, their creator, may have a little success

468
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:51,040
with their antitrust lawsuit against Apple because Apple has just lost a bid to dismiss

469
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:55,320
the antitrust lawsuit filed against it by Jay Freeman, the creator of the alternative

470
00:22:55,320 --> 00:23:00,040
app store known as Cydia Society, I can't remember, for jailbroken iPhones and iPads.

471
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:05,800
He sued in late 2020 alleging that Apple had an illegal monopoly over iOS app distribution

472
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:07,160
through the app store.

473
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:11,760
His complaint also alleged that Apple consistently tried to snuff out alternative app stores

474
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:17,920
and indicates there was a specific changes that were made between 2018 and 2021 that

475
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:21,320
were overt acts designed to harm iOS app stores.

476
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:26,240
And according to the report, the lawsuit seeks to open the market for iOS app distribution

477
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:31,160
and iOS app payment processing to those who wish to compete fairly with Apple.

478
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:36,520
And he hopes to recover enormous damages Apple caused by, you know, removing them.

479
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:39,160
And Apple tried to get this whole thing just tossed out.

480
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:41,000
Now, this is ridiculous.

481
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,680
Let's get rid of it, Apple said.

482
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:49,600
They were momentarily successful, but it has been dismissed and the antitrust lawsuit is

483
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:50,600
back on.

484
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:53,440
Well, the motion, the motion to dismiss was dismissed, right?

485
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:54,440
Not yet.

486
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:55,440
Not not the case.

487
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:56,440
Yeah.

488
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:57,560
So the case, I guess the way to put it is the case isn't back on.

489
00:23:57,560 --> 00:23:58,560
The case may proceed.

490
00:23:58,560 --> 00:23:59,560
Right.

491
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:00,560
Right.

492
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:01,560
Apple attempted to stop it.

493
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:02,560
Right.

494
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:06,840
And anybody who's ever been to court, which I sincerely hope you never have to go, but

495
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:09,640
the opening move is usually let's try to dismiss this.

496
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:10,640
Right.

497
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:11,640
Everybody.

498
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:12,640
Everybody.

499
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:13,640
It's like a it's like a two page motion.

500
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:14,640
They file it.

501
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:15,640
It's great.

502
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:16,640
I'm not a lawyer.

503
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:17,800
Get the hell out of here.

504
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:21,560
But children, are we ready to we is he is Mr.

505
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:22,560
Cain here?

506
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:23,560
Oh, yeah.

507
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:24,560
You want to tell us a little story?

508
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:27,200
Stay a while and listen.

509
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:28,640
City is going to lose.

510
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:34,640
They're going to lose because all this antitrust crap requires you to define the market.

511
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:40,680
And as our brother in Christ, Tim Sweeney, learned the hard way, the market isn't iPhone

512
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:45,260
distribution for apps and the market is software.

513
00:24:45,260 --> 00:24:47,400
So you have alternatives.

514
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:52,680
You can buy a piece of phone called an Android device that mines your data and treats you

515
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:53,760
like crap.

516
00:24:53,760 --> 00:25:00,120
You can be like me and hold on to your purple HTC, Windows Phone eight and cry and shake.

517
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:03,040
Tim, it was so good.

518
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:04,040
And be sad.

519
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:09,800
You could be like that guy who now works at Google after leaving the Verge, Dieter and

520
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:13,080
weep over your WebOS device.

521
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:19,000
But the reality is the way the laws are written, and I feel pretty confident in saying this,

522
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:25,600
Apple is going to win because you can't just be like Apple being a bee is not, you know,

523
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:27,640
the market is software.

524
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:31,360
I think the game question is interesting, although the city is not going for the games.

525
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:37,680
But like Epic brought up the well, it's game development, but the consoles have the same

526
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:40,040
structure in their business deals.

527
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:41,720
So yes.

528
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:46,540
So Cydia doesn't have that much money and Apple is I don't know if you've ever heard

529
00:25:46,540 --> 00:25:47,540
of them.

530
00:25:47,540 --> 00:25:49,240
They're a little shop out of California.

531
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:51,400
I hear they have some coins in the bank.

532
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:52,400
This is the thing.

533
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:54,000
This is what I was going to say.

534
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,420
Apple could afford to just bleed them.

535
00:25:55,420 --> 00:25:56,420
They will bleed them.

536
00:25:56,420 --> 00:25:57,420
Right.

537
00:25:57,420 --> 00:25:58,520
They're going to file motion after motion.

538
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:01,440
So for our younger audience, I believe you to the people all the time.

539
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:02,440
Right.

540
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:06,040
They would have these lawsuits that got filed against them and they would just file.

541
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:07,040
What was it?

542
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:08,040
What was the guy's name?

543
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:13,600
He was black in the sky with frivolous motions just to believe it was like they used to they

544
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:19,160
used to call the IBM lawyers the Nazgul, which for those who don't know are the bad guys

545
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:23,300
and Lord of the Rings, the dark guys, you know, the hooded folks with the swords that

546
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:26,120
are running around looking for Frodo.

547
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:30,560
Like that's the kind of that they're going to do.

548
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:34,980
Because they've done it before they continue to do it.

549
00:26:34,980 --> 00:26:38,240
Just to your point, though, about Android being a total dumpster fire that spies on

550
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:39,240
its users.

551
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:40,240
Nice.

552
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:43,800
Two days ago, as we record, Microsoft announced that they found several secure bugs in Android

553
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:49,600
apps, multiple CVEs, one, two, three, four CVEs.

554
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:53,240
And the best part is, and they write right here, the vulnerable apps have millions of

555
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:55,500
downloads on Google Play Store.

556
00:26:55,500 --> 00:27:02,560
They come pre-installed as system applications on devices bought by AT&T, Telus, Rogers Communications,

557
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:05,880
Bell Canada and Freedom Mobile on top of that.

558
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:09,320
They were straight up available on the Google Play Store and they went through Google plays

559
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:11,860
protect automatic safety checks.

560
00:27:11,860 --> 00:27:14,500
But the safety checks weren't checking for these issues.

561
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:18,760
And because the a lot of the apps that were installed by the via the image actually had

562
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:20,500
system level privileges.

563
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:25,640
So this actually led to all kinds of problems because the apps had root access and you could

564
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:27,280
only remove them if you have root access.

565
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:32,040
And the only way to update them is to ship a new image to the device.

566
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:33,040
So you wipe the.

567
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:35,520
Unless you installed it via the Play Store somehow, then you can update it via the Play

568
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:36,520
Store.

569
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:39,880
Yeah, you know, it's it's we talk about it sideways, but we never really hit the heart

570
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:40,920
of this.

571
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:45,240
The level of dumpster fire that Android is, especially tablets.

572
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:46,380
They're going back to tablets.

573
00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:47,380
Are they nuts?

574
00:27:47,380 --> 00:27:52,880
I mean, I would love Android to win just so I don't have to do a code signing for enterprise

575
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:54,440
deployments.

576
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:56,840
But God damn, it's so.

577
00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:58,660
Have you used a modern Android tablet?

578
00:27:58,660 --> 00:28:02,600
I've only used recently the fire tablets and they are garbage.

579
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:05,480
No, you got to you got to use the big ones.

580
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:10,180
Even the nice ones, the Samsung ones, the apps, they're just no one is programing thinking

581
00:28:10,180 --> 00:28:11,680
of a tablet display.

582
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:12,680
That's the thing.

583
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:13,680
There's not a big enough user.

584
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:14,680
Yeah.

585
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:15,680
And it's they just it's crap.

586
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:18,000
I mean, it's it's just terrible.

587
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,000
Who?

588
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,000
Yeah.

589
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:24,880
And the thing is, is like for people listening to this show, they are savvy enough that they

590
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:26,200
can navigate this stuff.

591
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:30,760
They could put their own lineage on there or they can patch it or they get a pixel or

592
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:32,760
they get a high end Android device.

593
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:37,640
But we all have family members or friends or acquaintances that are not savvy with this

594
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:38,640
stuff.

595
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:40,480
And they end up getting the really crappy Android devices.

596
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:44,040
And it's and let's be honest, they're playing Angry Birds, too, and they're fine.

597
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:45,040
All right.

598
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:46,040
Let's shift gears.

599
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:48,280
Let's talk about the other monster in the room.

600
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:58,480
It looks like we are getting some pretty solid pre WWDC leaks and reality OS has been trademarked

601
00:28:58,480 --> 00:28:59,640
by Apple.

602
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:01,960
They tried to trademark it overseas.

603
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:08,160
And then they also have a foreign filing date of June 8th, which is right around WWDC.

604
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:12,080
Two days after WWDC.

605
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:19,080
And they have another filing on the U.S. Patent Office website with a deadline of June 9th,

606
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:21,080
2022.

607
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:22,080
Reality OS.

608
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:24,080
What do you think?

609
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:28,400
You think we're going to get a mixed reality device from Apple this year?

610
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:30,600
No, I think it's an extension of ARKit.

611
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:33,040
I mean, would they even release a device?

612
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:34,040
No.

613
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:35,040
Right.

614
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:36,360
This would be start building at WWDC.

615
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:37,360
Yeah.

616
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:39,600
This is like we've added these APIs.

617
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:44,320
I mean, I think this could be an opportunity for our listeners, myself included.

618
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:47,320
But there's going to be no headset, no visor, nothing like that.

619
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:48,320
Yeah.

620
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:50,240
I mean, maybe later this year.

621
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:51,240
Couple of years.

622
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:56,760
The only thing that gives me pause is they really like to compete with Facebook.

623
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:59,320
Well, they personally hate each other.

624
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:00,320
So.

625
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:01,320
Yes.

626
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:04,240
And, you know, the Oculus 3 is about to come out.

627
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:08,160
So if they want to, you know, get a jumpstart, I mean, that's almost like the perfect that's

628
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:12,480
almost the way Apple does it, right, a couple of years, a couple of revisions of the Android

629
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:13,480
version.

630
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:16,960
And then they come out right around the Android versions getting division version three.

631
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:19,720
They come out with their fully baked product generally.

632
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:20,720
I just don't see it.

633
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:26,720
I think it's too soon, given Apple's propensity for, you know, a thin design, one taking forever.

634
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:29,560
And also, I mean, OK, this is nerdy.

635
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:33,160
I've been reading a lot about lithium ion batteries because that's what people do when

636
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:37,760
they are psychologically disturbed.

637
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:42,960
I just I don't see it like like an actual AR headset that you would want to wear.

638
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:43,960
Right.

639
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:46,120
That does things that make sense.

640
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:50,760
The battery technology isn't there at the at the size you need it to be.

641
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:51,760
Right.

642
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:52,760
Yeah.

643
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:53,760
Not without multiple charging in a day.

644
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:54,760
Right.

645
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:55,760
For a device like that.

646
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:56,760
Right.

647
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:57,760
Right.

648
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:58,760
Right.

649
00:30:58,760 --> 00:30:59,760
Yeah.

650
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:00,760
I see where you're going.

651
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:01,760
I'm talking about you put your VR glasses on at seven a.m.

652
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:02,760
You come home from work at six.

653
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:05,280
You know, you take them off when you have your nightcap.

654
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:06,320
That's not possible.

655
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:12,320
I agree, although I could see Apple setting the benchmark for that at like the air pods.

656
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:15,800
The last as long as your air pods last kind of a thing, which anybody who's been in meetings

657
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:19,840
all day know it's like, you know, it's like four hours, five hours, maybe if you're lucky.

658
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:20,840
Right.

659
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:22,720
The last as long as your air pods, perhaps.

660
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:24,620
And everybody seems to be fine with that.

661
00:31:24,620 --> 00:31:27,240
So maybe that's what they'll do.

662
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:34,700
But yeah, I think no device next week, if anything, an expansion on AR and maybe hardware.

663
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:42,460
The rumor mill is clucking pretty hard about M2 hardware, updated Macs, things like that.

664
00:31:42,460 --> 00:31:45,680
We could see any we could see things like that coming out next week, I suppose.

665
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:46,680
You know, those kinds of things.

666
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:48,320
It doesn't really matter until it happens.

667
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:50,500
You got the keynote June six.

668
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:52,560
Do you think it's at 10 a.m.?

669
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:55,240
So it's that's two hours earlier than we normally start.

670
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:56,520
Should we live stream it?

671
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:59,260
Should we just get together after it's we probably should just get together after it's

672
00:31:59,260 --> 00:32:00,260
done, huh?

673
00:32:00,260 --> 00:32:01,260
You know what we should do?

674
00:32:01,260 --> 00:32:05,520
We should do it after the keynote when they're doing actual announcements, because the keynote,

675
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:09,080
you know, they do their touchy feely crap about whatever.

676
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:14,040
And then you got the State of the Union at 1 p.m., which is usually about an hour after

677
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:15,040
after we start recording.

678
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:17,140
I'm super curious about the M2.

679
00:32:17,140 --> 00:32:18,640
Like is it just going to be more cores?

680
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:21,480
I got to be honest with you, I'm loving my M1 MacBook Air.

681
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:25,920
I have absolutely no reason other than my sudden eyes ability to destroy things.

682
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:28,880
Yes, I'm blaming the child.

683
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:29,880
I kind of want an M2.

684
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:38,280
I just want to because I'm sitting in front of my iMac Pro and I will admit that I'm frankly

685
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:40,240
I'm disappointed in it.

686
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:44,680
It's not as powerful as the MacBook Air, which is the most shameful thing it can be.

687
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:45,680
I don't know.

688
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:49,420
I think the next couple of years of this industry are going to be in terms of chips competing

689
00:32:49,420 --> 00:32:51,400
with the M series processors.

690
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:58,200
I think where Apple is still lagging and the X86 world still has them lapped is the higher

691
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:03,120
end GPU area and so that's an area where the M2 could really kind of compete, you know?

692
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:04,120
No, that's fair.

693
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:05,120
That's fair, right?

694
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:06,120
Yeah, we'll see.

695
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:07,120
We'll see.

696
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:10,600
I don't think there's much they could announce that would get me to crack open the old pocketbook.

697
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:11,600
Things are tight these days.

698
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:12,600
Oh, same.

699
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:13,600
It's going to be a big problem.

700
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:14,600
Yeah.

701
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:15,600
Yeah, no, I'm not.

702
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:22,360
I mean, the M2 would have to like literally make me a martini, be purple and because,

703
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:23,360
you know, on brand.

704
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:24,360
Yeah.

705
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:25,360
I couldn't even imagine.

706
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:28,280
I actually can't think of the case where I would buy it, to be honest with you.

707
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:29,280
I can't either.

708
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:31,560
I mean, we may eat these words.

709
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:34,840
Apple is particularly good at convincing us that we need the new stuff.

710
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:40,120
As both of us are hard typing our credit card numbers and live on the air next week.

711
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:42,840
Yeah, it has happened.

712
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:48,360
But I'm just thinking with the economy and the overall bear market conditions and how

713
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:49,360
it's like, you know, cutting back.

714
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:54,280
Like, I just spent 60 bucks this morning filling up my tiny little golf with gas, right?

715
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:59,720
I got a little VW Golf and I'm putting 60 bucks, 62 bucks worth of gas in there.

716
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:00,720
Tell me about it, brother.

717
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:01,720
Tell me.

718
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:03,800
Yeah, it's just like things are just tight right now.

719
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:08,260
But here's what I think I'll do is I think I'll I'll stream it on Jupiter tube, which

720
00:34:08,260 --> 00:34:09,280
is our peer tube instance.

721
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:14,200
I cannot stream the WWDC stream anywhere else or else I get in serious copyright trouble.

722
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:15,200
You really?

723
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:19,160
Yeah, it's so dumb because it's they don't want their own freaking press event to be

724
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:20,160
covered.

725
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:21,160
Apple does it.

726
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:25,360
Apple abuses copyright law to force people to tune into their stream so you get it directly

727
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:26,360
from them.

728
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:29,880
But the reality is commentary on a news event is 100 percent fair use.

729
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:31,240
Yeah, that's fair use.

730
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:33,020
Yeah, but the bots don't care.

731
00:34:33,020 --> 00:34:34,240
The bots don't care about fair use.

732
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:35,240
They just shut your.

733
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:40,320
In fact, the biggest trouble our YouTube channel ever got in and it's still in trouble right

734
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:41,320
now.

735
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:46,680
It won't it won't clear until next week is when I streamed WWDC last time and they they

736
00:34:46,680 --> 00:34:48,500
put me in the doghouse forever.

737
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:50,720
So I'm just going to do it at Jupiter dot tube.

738
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:55,680
I've got a new instance I've set up and I'll just stream it there and just mostly have

739
00:34:55,680 --> 00:34:56,680
it playing.

740
00:34:56,680 --> 00:35:00,300
So that way I have commentary ready for Coder, you know, and then we'll get connected our

741
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:01,300
regular time.

742
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:02,300
We'll do the show.

743
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:03,300
We'll cover it.

744
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:06,320
And, you know, if anything relevant happened, we'll talk about it.

745
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:08,440
Otherwise, we'll just focus on other stuff.

746
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:10,440
It's I think something cool is going to happen.

747
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:12,480
I actually am optimistic.

748
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:20,640
Here's what I'd like to ask is if you're watching WWDC live next week, open up your new podcast

749
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:22,560
hosting app and send us a boost in with your thoughts.

750
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:26,240
So that way we can get super fresh boosts about WWDC.

751
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:30,360
I want your WWDC take in a boost, which means you're going to have to have this week's app

752
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:32,360
pause it before the music is done at the end.

753
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:33,800
So that way it's ready in your podcast player.

754
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:35,120
Open up and send us a boost.

755
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:37,400
So that way we can get super fresh boosts into the show.

756
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:39,240
I mean, you can send us a boost anytime, too.

757
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:40,240
We love your boosts.

758
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:44,520
But I think that'd be pretty neat to get people's live reaction on that kind of stuff because,

759
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:47,320
you know, I'd like to know how people take it because Mike and I have our opinions,

760
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:51,320
but not everybody sees it the same way.

761
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:57,640
Speaking of boosts, Freak sent in 15,000 sats and he says, here's some sats for your Mexican

762
00:35:57,640 --> 00:35:58,640
dentist.

763
00:35:58,640 --> 00:35:59,640
Thank you.

764
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:00,640
I am.

765
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:01,640
I am looking.

766
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:02,640
I have a hole.

767
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:05,960
I cracked a tooth and I realize I actually have another tooth that needs a problem as

768
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:07,000
a problem.

769
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,360
I got all kinds of dental issues.

770
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:14,400
So right now I'm looking into local dentist clinics because they have like membership

771
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:17,280
options and they want to like the work with you on payments.

772
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:18,280
I'm looking into that.

773
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:20,980
But I am also considering the Mexican dentist.

774
00:36:20,980 --> 00:36:25,320
So I appreciate it for actually I appreciate it more than people probably realize because

775
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:28,260
I get messages like that when they come in, it's like, you know, we really do have a great

776
00:36:28,260 --> 00:36:29,260
audience.

777
00:36:29,260 --> 00:36:30,260
It never happens.

778
00:36:30,260 --> 00:36:31,260
We have a great audience.

779
00:36:31,260 --> 00:36:35,400
So Cyan Deer boosted in with five thousand sats two days ago.

780
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:37,200
And he says, I don't know what your problem is, Chris.

781
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:38,840
Teeth are just luxury bones.

782
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:44,520
Wow, that's a little rough, but I'll take it.

783
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:45,520
I know.

784
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:47,320
The Golden Dragon, a frequent booster.

785
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:51,280
He comes in with my favorite dragon.

786
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:52,800
You don't like the yellow dragon, huh?

787
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:58,440
No, the yellow dragon made a made a poor merge into dev and we're fighting.

788
00:36:58,440 --> 00:37:03,160
Well, the Golden Dragon likes to boost in with a row of ducks.

789
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:04,840
It's two, two, two, two.

790
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:08,040
If you type that into a calculator, it looks like a row of ducks.

791
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:15,960
Damn it, Chris, don't play that if my kids harassed, I will have five hours of goddamn

792
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:16,960
duck tales.

793
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:19,360
I know it's it's so great.

794
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:24,960
He says, I do love me some bacon and that HP acquiring system 76 was crispy.

795
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:25,960
Thanks for the show.

796
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:26,960
As usual.

797
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:27,960
You know what?

798
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:33,520
My Draconic friend, I believe that I have no inside information, but I that is my bacon

799
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:35,120
from now until the Ren Faire.

800
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:36,120
I believe it.

801
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:38,480
This dev one development is really interesting.

802
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:42,200
They're going to buy them up like a fat kid buying a Twinkie.

803
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:47,520
DPG boost in six days ago with five hundred stats says, hey, Chris and Mike, I know you

804
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:51,880
guys have talked a lot about Heroku in the past, but with the recent crop of Heroku is

805
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:52,880
dead articles.

806
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:58,240
Have you guys checked out fly dot i o I just recently spun a go bot up there and it was

807
00:37:58,240 --> 00:37:59,240
actually a breeze.

808
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:00,240
Thanks.

809
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:01,240
Love the pod.

810
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:04,800
So it's fly dot i o deploy app servers close to your users.

811
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:06,440
Are you familiar with this?

812
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:07,440
I am.

813
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:08,440
I don't use it.

814
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:09,440
I did a look at it.

815
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:13,520
I ended up just using sticking with Doku and Docker containers, but it looks like a fine

816
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:15,080
Heroku alternative.

817
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:17,720
It's definitely a little more modern.

818
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:18,720
So yeah.

819
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:19,720
Yeah.

820
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:20,720
I like it.

821
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:21,920
I actually I think it looks really great.

822
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:24,040
It looks like it's super quick to get up and going to.

823
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:25,040
Yeah.

824
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:29,280
Well, they have really good guides to if you're using like a stack that's not cray cray.

825
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:31,000
You know, I don't know.

826
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:34,880
Like if you have like a rails app or, you know, a flask app, you could deploy that in

827
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:35,880
seconds.

828
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:36,880
It's good stuff.

829
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:40,440
Red greenery factor boosts in with 500 sats five days ago.

830
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:41,440
Boost.

831
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:44,360
I'm a longtime listener coming in with my first boost.

832
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:45,800
Congratulations Red Green.

833
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:49,480
I enjoy your guys' perspective on the market and current events and would appreciate more

834
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:51,040
on filter show type content.

835
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:53,520
I think you both have a unique perspective.

836
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:57,880
We also got a boost from PL Trent who said he'd also be up for a filter crossover.

837
00:38:57,880 --> 00:38:59,680
So maybe we got to put that on the schedule sometime.

838
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:01,760
Let our powers combine.

839
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:02,760
Exactly.

840
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:08,880
A middle aged dev boosted in with our last one, actually, no second to last one with

841
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:09,880
500 sats.

842
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:12,920
He says my two sats worth after hearing the note from Dan last week, who was sick of hearing

843
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:13,920
about podcasting 2.0.

844
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:19,040
If you're tired of boosts, I think what you ought to do is correlate the user feedback.

845
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:22,680
You probably do this and then only mention the boost amounts when they're notably large,

846
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:25,040
like, you know, 50,000 sats or more.

847
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:27,840
And he says, you know, you could also mention I only spent 500 sats to say this.

848
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:32,880
Yeah, I was going to say, hmm, this is also you could mention to Dan that there are chapters

849
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:37,040
so he could skip past the boost easily, but he may have to get a new podcast app.

850
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:38,040
That's true.

851
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:39,040
We do have chapters.

852
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:41,960
So just I just want to say middle aged dev.

853
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:44,760
Perhaps there's another way to contribute.

854
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:46,600
Perhaps you know, it's cold.

855
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:50,860
Winter is coming in the mornings when you're having your coffee.

856
00:39:50,860 --> 00:39:52,920
And if you're Mike, your first bourbon of the day.

857
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:53,920
Sure.

858
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:57,260
You don't want to get dressed yet because you still have to shave and shower.

859
00:39:57,260 --> 00:40:00,120
But like you don't want to walk out in your boxers because your dong will be flapping

860
00:40:00,120 --> 00:40:01,120
about.

861
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:02,120
Right.

862
00:40:02,120 --> 00:40:03,120
You want to be a gentleman about something.

863
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:05,200
I don't know, Chris, the thing you could wear.

864
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:06,200
It's like black, baby.

865
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:07,880
And it's like really comfy.

866
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:08,880
Yeah.

867
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:13,280
So that they could work on a casual day, could work when you're getting out of the shower,

868
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:14,640
maybe on a workday.

869
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:18,280
Maybe you're it's your day off and you're smoking a cigar or if you're Chris, you have

870
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:24,980
a you have a frickin joint that's the size of a baseball bat.

871
00:40:24,980 --> 00:40:26,560
What would you be wearing?

872
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:30,000
Probably not a dress because we don't we don't do that.

873
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,080
Not a sort of ceremonial garb.

874
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:33,560
No, not.

875
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:34,560
Yeah.

876
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:35,560
Jacket.

877
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:37,560
I'm not sure.

878
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:39,560
Maybe you just got out of the back row.

879
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:42,080
Oh, a row by a row.

880
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:43,560
Yeah, we got to get those.

881
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:45,000
You know, we got to get those going again.

882
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,520
The robes are the best thing we've ever sold.

883
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:47,520
I should say.

884
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:48,520
I know.

885
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:49,520
I know.

886
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:50,520
It's great.

887
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:51,520
The robes are the reason we do the show.

888
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:53,440
So we're really just looking for clothing here.

889
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:54,440
We're poor.

890
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:58,240
We're still getting some access love, actually, if you can believe it.

891
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:00,240
Oh, Jesus Christ.

892
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:02,800
Four score and seven boosters go.

893
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:07,440
S thumbs X boosted in with a thousand sat saying I love access.

894
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:08,440
Still use it all the time.

895
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:09,440
So there you go.

896
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:11,120
And may God bless your soul.

897
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:12,440
Yeah, really.

898
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:16,840
We also got a thank you boost from Freak and from PL Trent again.

899
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:18,920
So thank you, everybody, very much.

900
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:22,640
Your direct support is very much appreciated.

901
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:27,080
You can get a new podcast app at NewPodcastApps.com or if you don't want to switch podcast apps,

902
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:32,200
but you want a boost, you can get the Breeze app and you can send them in.

903
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:35,260
Also thank you to our members, CoderQA.co.

904
00:41:35,260 --> 00:41:36,720
You get the Coderly report.

905
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:40,720
You also get access to a version of the show with no ads.

906
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:41,720
Very nice.

907
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:43,080
Plus, you're giving us direct support.

908
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:46,760
So we get to do things like turn down all of the weekly emails we get offering us to

909
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:51,020
do random sponsorships or payments to have somebody come on the show and tell you guys

910
00:41:51,020 --> 00:41:54,120
about some great framework they've created or whatever it is they're constantly trying

911
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:55,400
to shill.

912
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:58,640
We get to say no to all that stuff and we get to pick sponsors we like to work with

913
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:02,040
and as a thank you, we give you that ad free version.

914
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:06,120
CoderQA.co or if you want to support all the shows and get access to all the special editions

915
00:42:06,120 --> 00:42:09,560
for all the shows ad free and all of that, you can go to Jupiter.party.

916
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:13,440
Mr. Dominic, is there anywhere you'd like to send the good people this week?

917
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:14,440
Yeah, I guess.

918
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:15,440
Go to DominicM.com.

919
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:19,840
I might write a blog post on why you shouldn't write in Swift or something.

920
00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:21,160
I don't know, I'll figure it out.

921
00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:22,160
You should.

922
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:23,160
But first, you should get better.

923
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:24,160
Yes.

924
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:25,160
You know, focus on the healing.

925
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:26,820
I'm sensing more Pepto in my future.

926
00:42:26,820 --> 00:42:28,400
We got a big show next week.

927
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:29,400
I know.

928
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:30,400
We got to get game ready.

929
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:34,640
All right, links to what we talked about today are over there at the coder.show slash the

930
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:35,640
four sixty eight.

931
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:36,640
That's the website.

932
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:39,840
You also find a contact page, that's a big part of the show.

933
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:40,840
We do like to hear from you.

934
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:42,840
We got the subscribes over there.

935
00:42:42,840 --> 00:42:43,840
All that's just a coder.show.

936
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:44,840
It's real simple.

937
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:45,840
It's a website.

938
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:49,440
You probably are familiar with those, so I don't got to explain much more.

939
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:54,400
If we do the show on Mondays, over at jblive.tv, noon pacific, three p.m. eastern, streaming

940
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:59,320
over at Jupiter.tube next week for the WWDCs, and then we'll just keep the stream rolling

941
00:42:59,320 --> 00:43:00,320
over there.

942
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:01,960
This week's episode is streamed over there as well.

943
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:03,600
You can always check it out after the fact.

944
00:43:03,600 --> 00:43:04,600
I don't know.

945
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:05,600
We'll see.

946
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:06,600
It's new.

947
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:07,600
But I like it.

948
00:43:07,600 --> 00:43:08,600
And I like you.

949
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:09,600
And I want to say thank you for listening.

950
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:20,520
And I hope you tune in right back here next week.
