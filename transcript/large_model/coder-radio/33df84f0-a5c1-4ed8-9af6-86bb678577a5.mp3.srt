11
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:44,240
My name is Chris and joining us every single week is our Handsome as Hell host, hello Mr.

12
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:45,240
Dominic.

13
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:47,600
Well, how are you doing, you fine gentleman?

14
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:48,600
What an introduction.

15
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:49,600
I'm honored.

16
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:52,160
Well, I mean, I recognize game.

17
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:54,680
You know what I'm saying?

18
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:55,680
Takes one to know one.

19
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:57,060
I got butterflies today.

20
00:00:57,060 --> 00:00:59,000
I'm a little nervous.

21
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,720
I woke up this morning and I had a shipping update notification.

22
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:07,500
You know, so I ordered that MacBook Pro M1 Max.

23
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:13,160
You know, I saved up my pennies, my Bitcoins, and I waited for them to rev the M1 platform

24
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:16,560
and I ordered it and it said, oh, you're going to get it December 24th.

25
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,480
And I thought, well, okay, that's fine.

26
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:19,480
I'm in no rush.

27
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:22,120
Then they updated it and said, you're going to get it November 24th.

28
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:25,280
And I thought, oh, all right, great.

29
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:31,380
And this morning the update came in and it says November 17th, which is like next week.

30
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:32,880
That's way too soon.

31
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:34,240
I am not ready for this.

32
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:37,180
I am actually nervous.

33
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:40,320
I'm not, I need to, first of all, I need to prepare the way I have not prepared the way

34
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:41,320
at all for this.

35
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:45,760
I have like a bunch of stuff I need to back up and archive off of my other machines.

36
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:47,000
I need to do backups.

37
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,360
I need to reorganize my entire desk.

38
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:50,360
I got it.

39
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:53,800
I just, I'm not ready for this because the other thing I am legitimately worried about

40
00:01:53,800 --> 00:02:00,360
is what if I really, really, really, really like it and then like it's the only machine

41
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:01,360
I want to use.

42
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:02,360
And what does that mean?

43
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:03,360
And what does that make me?

44
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:05,520
And I'm still going through a lot of it right now.

45
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:08,280
And I thought I had like another few weeks to process this.

46
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:11,520
And then I wake up and I see it's coming and I think I'm the first guy ever who wishes

47
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:15,100
it was getting delayed and not accelerated.

48
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:16,320
So that's me this morning.

49
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:17,320
How are you?

50
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:23,520
Well, I'm definitely better than you, although I did acquire Age of Empires IV.

51
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:28,080
And I'm irritated that through all my parallel sorcery, I can't get that running because

52
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:31,240
of DirectX 12.

53
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:38,800
And apparently there's just so much crap in DirectX 12 that the VM folks can't make that

54
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:39,800
work.

55
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:45,600
And I think this is a great segue to our Python on Windows for 2021 thing because I can tell

56
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:48,840
you that Age of Empires is a required part of my life.

57
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:52,840
And if I can't get this running, that's going to be a problem.

58
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:59,000
So I know the secret incantations you need to unlock the compatibility powers when they

59
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,880
do become available.

60
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:05,200
So what you have to do is you're going to want to keep an eye on ProtonDB.

61
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:10,160
So when you see that that version of the game has a good rating on ProtonDB.

62
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:12,520
Now if you're on Linux, you're pretty much done.

63
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:18,120
If you're using the Mac, the next thing you got to watch for is Windows crossover office,

64
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:22,080
say they support that or have the version of wine that has the current version of all

65
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,280
the stuff you need.

66
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:27,320
I have done a little bit of reading about this because I was curious, like, what am

67
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:29,800
I going to do with all these GPU cores?

68
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,200
I'd like to be able to play a video game.

69
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,200
What a concept.

70
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:35,720
And it turns out there's other things I might want to play than what's an Apple arcade.

71
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:42,960
And so it seems as ludicrously stupid as it sounds, people are actually having good success

72
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:51,760
to a degree with crossover office running x86 Windows games on the new machines.

73
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:56,320
So if you want to do like seven layers of emulation and oh, sorry, not emulation.

74
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:58,840
I was just going to say it's not an emulator.

75
00:03:58,840 --> 00:03:59,840
Wine is not an emulator.

76
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:04,480
Yeah, it's a translation, although the x86 stuff will absolutely be emulation.

77
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:07,140
So yeah, well, actually, maybe not.

78
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:10,360
Maybe M1 does actually execute some of the I don't know.

79
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:12,280
But either way, it's a lot of turtles.

80
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:15,720
Okay, but I'm on a Intel Xeon.

81
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:20,680
And the problem is actually that there is no direct translation for DirectX 12 into

82
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:24,360
either Metal or OpenGL that exists in the world today.

83
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:29,840
And if you go on the Parallels Forum, they're like, yeah, dude, what are you doing?

84
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:31,960
Isn't this like the classic problem?

85
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:36,280
Like now Apple is going to build some of the most competitive performance machines out

86
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:37,840
there.

87
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:42,700
And it's like when you're when you're investing in four grand in a laptop, it really should

88
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:45,640
be able to do absolutely everything.

89
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:52,520
Even if you only do some of those things occasionally, a tool at that price point should be comprehensive.

90
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:57,140
And video games is something I expect to have an expensive computer with a bunch of GPU cores.

91
00:04:57,140 --> 00:04:58,720
So I don't know.

92
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:02,760
I guess the only solution is as shops decided to start supporting the Mac.

93
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:09,360
But it is very funny that we are now at a point where the situation is significantly

94
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:13,800
better on Linux for gaming than it is the Mac.

95
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,240
Especially with the M1 transition.

96
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:19,400
I mean, so I'm reading on your suggestion, the ProtonDB entry for AOE4.

97
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:21,360
It's not great.

98
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:24,440
This definitely reminds me of back in the early aughts getting World of Warcraft to

99
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:29,360
run on Ubuntu Brown Edition, whatever number that was, 8.10, 9.10, whatever.

100
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:33,760
But apparently there is some sorcery, but the textures, I guess, still kind of aren't

101
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:35,560
up to snuff.

102
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:36,560
I don't know.

103
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:40,160
I mean, I got to be honest with you, I don't play that many games anymore.

104
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:43,680
Yeah, like right when I got divorced, I did a lot of gaming, then I like went back to

105
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:44,680
the mean.

106
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:48,840
Like Age of Empires is so core to my desire to conquer the world.

107
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:53,400
I mean, to be Mark Zuckerberg, I mean, oh, God.

108
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:56,040
It's just my, it's one of my favorite games, right?

109
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:59,320
And this, I have seen very little of this.

110
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:03,360
I accidentally logged into my Microsoft account and it was like, yo, dog, we have AOE4 and

111
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:06,400
I was like, here's $60.

112
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:09,440
That's pretty much me and the new Metroid games.

113
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:14,160
Or if they do another Breath of the Wild based game with that same engine or something, it's

114
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:16,840
an absolute automatic buy from me.

115
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:19,240
That's where the Switch does scratch that itch.

116
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:21,320
It's like the guaranteed I'm going to sit down.

117
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:22,320
Switch is amazing.

118
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:23,320
Mm-hmm.

119
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:24,320
It's, and it works every time.

120
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:26,640
You know, every now and then there's like a super quick update or whatever, but they're

121
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:27,880
actually all pretty painless.

122
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:29,840
You know, can we inside baseball?

123
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:30,840
Yeah.

124
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:34,920
One of the reasons I didn't get an M1 Mac Pro is one, I kind of knew about AOE4 coming

125
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:39,360
out and I had a feeling I'd end up buying a Dell desktop.

126
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,960
And two, OLED Switch.

127
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:46,200
I have one of those crappy Switch minis because my kid has the good Switch.

128
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:49,680
And I don't know about you, but my old man vision on that little crappy screen.

129
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:50,840
Yeah, screen's no good.

130
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:53,040
It's not what's up, especially for Breath of the Wild.

131
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:54,040
Yeah.

132
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:57,320
Like I'm at the stupid temple with that, I don't know, octopus water dude, he's kicking

133
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:58,320
my ass.

134
00:06:58,320 --> 00:06:59,320
Uh-huh.

135
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:00,680
Anyway, we're off the track here, but.

136
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:01,680
Good game.

137
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,720
The situation will improve with time.

138
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:04,800
No doubt about it.

139
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:10,720
As more M1s sell or M1 Pros and Maxes and as the Steam Deck comes out and more and more

140
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:15,680
development shops target Proton, the situation will improve.

141
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,720
But it does kind of stink still right now.

142
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:23,920
I've attempted to make the situation a little better by subscribing to GeForce Now game

143
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:24,920
streaming.

144
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:26,220
It's a choice.

145
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:32,660
My thought was instead of buying GPUs, I'll just subscribe to GeForce Now and they have

146
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:35,080
like RTX and they have 3080s, right?

147
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,080
It's Nvidia.

148
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:38,560
So they've got all the hardware.

149
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,360
You just run it on their systems.

150
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:45,580
And for the games that they support, it's pretty nice and it will connect to your Steam

151
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:49,000
library and your Epic accounts and it'll sync.

152
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:53,200
And so if you've bought something in Steam and they have the streaming rights to it,

153
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:54,800
you can play it through GeForce Now.

154
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:57,960
You don't have to like buy it again like you might with Stadia.

155
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:03,040
But the crux of the issue is most of the games I want to play right now, they don't have

156
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,440
streaming rights to.

157
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:07,960
So even though I own the game in Steam and I have a GeForce Now streaming account and

158
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:11,440
now I have Starlink so I can actually play games at home, I can't actually play the games

159
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:16,900
I want to play because those development shops don't want to license the streaming rights.

160
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:21,520
The fact that Microsoft Studios makes Age of Empires and it's not on the thing I just

161
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:27,040
subscribed to thinking I could stream it in Chrome on my fancy ass Mac, yeah.

162
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:30,280
It's part of the service, but you can't stream it to be super clear.

163
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:34,080
You have to download the XE.

164
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,240
I hate that.

165
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:39,120
You know the funny thing about gaming is like my neighbor recently said, my current neighbor,

166
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,120
oh I don't game.

167
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:41,120
I've never gamed.

168
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:44,240
I tried Pac-Man when it first came out and I just didn't like it.

169
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,240
It wasn't for me.

170
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:46,840
Never picked up a video game afterwards.

171
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:47,840
Not a gamer.

172
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:48,840
Not interested.

173
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:49,840
I said, oh really?

174
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:51,440
So you don't ever play any mobile games?

175
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,440
Oh, well.

176
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:55,480
I love, you know, and she rattles off like two or three games that she loves.

177
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:59,480
Yeah, she's like, of course everybody poops and therefore you're an Angry Birds or Jet

178
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:00,480
Pack Joyride.

179
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:01,480
I mean, come on.

180
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:02,480
Yeah.

181
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:09,120
But for me, it's like a lot of developers invest significantly in their work rig to

182
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:12,320
make it powerful and fast and maybe have a big screen.

183
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:16,180
And it's a lot of them actually make for really good gaming systems and I think it's a great

184
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:22,320
way to burn off stress, to get your mind off things without going out and spending a bunch

185
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:26,320
of money if you went out and bought dinner and went to a movie and went shopping or something.

186
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:30,880
Like it's a pretty economical way to get your head right sometimes.

187
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:34,720
So I don't know, I think people, you know, they shouldn't be so dismissive of it, but

188
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,920
let's move on because there are worse things in the world.

189
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:40,400
And one of the things we always talk about on the show recently, you really got to be

190
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:44,640
careful if you're working on a side project that you're not using any of your employer's

191
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:46,880
hardware, time, resources.

192
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:51,960
We talked about that a lot, but Dane got shut down hard, even though he did everything right.

193
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:57,360
He said, so I wanted to pass along, but sometimes even when you stick to your own personal hardware

194
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:04,320
and time, even when you buy the new hardware just for the projects, some employers hiring

195
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:10,720
contracts state that the company owns all code you produce, free time or not at all.

196
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:15,400
He says, some many rather enterprise level companies state that they own all of the code

197
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:21,280
you write while you're a salaried employee, regardless of the time of day or the hardware

198
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:22,280
used.

199
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:25,200
He says, sometimes you can talk with someone at these companies or file a request for a

200
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:30,520
specific project to be excluded from the employer's reach, but it's a conversation and they could

201
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:31,520
say no.

202
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:35,220
I was bitten by this and I had to stop my project.

203
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:39,320
These days, every side project is a public repository from the very beginning.

204
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:44,560
While employers could still make claims, I at least have goodwill on my side.

205
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:47,640
They can fork the repo and they'd look bad if they asked me to make it private or delete

206
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:48,640
it.

207
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:51,880
Of course, I suppose that's assuming people are even paying attention.

208
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:54,680
I know it's kind of a downer thing to think about, but it's something people need to be

209
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:57,640
really quite careful about.

210
00:10:57,640 --> 00:11:02,280
If you can, perhaps even have that conversation pretty early into the process of getting the

211
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:03,280
job.

212
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:06,440
I would like to continue to contribute to open source projects and make sure that they're

213
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:07,980
comfortable with that.

214
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:11,920
An equivalent thing that we have here is some of the guys that participate in the network

215
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:17,360
that don't work for themselves, when they get new gigs, they'll have that conversation

216
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:18,360
with their employer.

217
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:23,040
Say, hey, I participate in these podcasts and they're kind of a big deal and I'm kind

218
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:25,680
of a big internet celebrity, are you okay with me?

219
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:27,640
I'm sure they say it just like that too.

220
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:30,380
Are you okay with me continuing to do it?

221
00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:33,780
So everybody's on the same page and you always want to do that and try to get it documented

222
00:11:33,780 --> 00:11:37,840
and maybe even note it down and date that and save that.

223
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:38,840
I don't know.

224
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:42,280
Do you have any other like don't get your ass taken from you kind of wisdom for people

225
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:43,280
to pass along?

226
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:44,280
Yeah.

227
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:47,840
As my reputation as a ruthless capitalist, I guess it's going to suffer now.

228
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:52,320
I have never heard of you being able to screw with someone's off time project if they don't

229
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:56,000
use your equipment, hardware, resources, blah, blah, blah.

230
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,640
Nor can I imagine a case where you really want to.

231
00:11:58,640 --> 00:11:59,640
I get it.

232
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:03,160
It's great to be able to steal someone's talent, I guess.

233
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:04,160
Maybe that's too harsh.

234
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:08,440
But well, first of all, I'm sure it really comes down to what made it into like whatever

235
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:12,160
contract you signed when you came on board and how enforceable is that in your state?

236
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:13,600
So that's always going to be a variable.

237
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:14,600
Yeah.

238
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:18,000
I mean, this feels like the kind of thing that maybe exists.

239
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
I don't know.

240
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Not a lawyer.

241
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:25,680
I don't want to delve into it too much, but I can't imagine this being like you, you know,

242
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:29,520
you're on Dell's website, you're looking at an XPS workstation, it's roughly eighteen

243
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:30,520
hundred dollars.

244
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:32,040
That is an NVIDIA 12 gig GPU.

245
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:33,040
That's not what I'm doing right now.

246
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:35,400
No, of course not.

247
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:37,040
And you know, you've written your own.

248
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:40,560
Let's say you've written the app that's going to make you know, bring the Windows App Store

249
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,840
to the forefront of the app stores.

250
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:48,240
One I would suggest you put down the vape pen or the martini glass, whichever your drug

251
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:50,400
of choice is.

252
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:53,120
But how can your employer take that?

253
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:57,800
And just I can say, like, I know I got a lot of crap and so did you a couple of months

254
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:00,400
and a half ago, whatever it was.

255
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:03,160
Even I think this is too evil.

256
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:08,080
People you pay them for, however, you know, for goals and for when they the hours they

257
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:10,920
work, you can't claim the rest of their life.

258
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:13,880
That's that's crazy to me.

259
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:15,880
Sorry, I've turned into a communist.

260
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:16,880
It's over.

261
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:21,520
Not only is it absolutely an overreach, but I am not surprised to learn that it's happening.

262
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:26,440
I could even see some lawyer kind of corporety justification being their work may have been

263
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:28,560
inspired by what they learned on the job.

264
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:31,560
The skill set they learned on the job may have helped them or inspired them with the

265
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:32,560
side project.

266
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:34,160
So therefore, you know, blah, blah, blah.

267
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:36,360
I could maybe see some sort of twisted logic like that.

268
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:37,840
I'm not justifying it.

269
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:40,800
Just these people are sick and twisted and they want everything.

270
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:45,640
And so I could see that being why it's like we're super evil and we're totally OK with

271
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:46,640
it.

272
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:47,640
That's just what it sounds like to me.

273
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:48,640
I'm sorry.

274
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:49,640
And that's that's bad.

275
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:50,640
I mean, yeah, this is a rabbit hole.

276
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:51,640
Right.

277
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:55,240
Because corporations have more and more power, pretty much have more power than governments

278
00:13:55,240 --> 00:14:00,000
in some cases, in some areas, and they will take it as far as they can.

279
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,640
I mean, that's just always that's always how it's been.

280
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:04,280
You got to have things documented.

281
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:07,320
You got to be clear about things if you want to participate, if your employer does that.

282
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:13,480
I mean, it's easy for me to say here, but also consider looking for another job.

283
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:15,680
The market's pretty good right now.

284
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:20,240
It's like, you know, you buy Bitcoin when the price drops and you hold when the price

285
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:21,240
goes up.

286
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:25,000
And, you know, you got to like watch the market, you know, just like you are keen with your

287
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,100
crypto there, kid, be keen with the job market, too.

288
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:30,000
And maybe I'm not saying Dan should move on.

289
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:34,280
I'm sure he's very happy where he's at, but it is always something you should consider.

290
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:38,080
We got a couple of like tips and app recommendations and stuff.

291
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:43,040
Larry wrote in for visually impaired listeners, he says, I know you guys are a fan of Linux

292
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:44,080
and Rust.

293
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:50,400
He's a little unhappy with the state of screen readers on Linux, although I have heard that

294
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:55,160
Orca on Gnome and Wayland is improving recently, he says, but it's falling behind, especially

295
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:58,760
the stuff that you have on like Windows and Mac.

296
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:02,960
But there's a project that he'd like to bring to our attention and I don't really know how

297
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:09,520
to pronounce this one because it is spelled Y-G-G-D-R-A-S-I-L.

298
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:11,240
I thought we talked about this in Slack.

299
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:13,280
We are not reading from the Necronomicon.

300
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:14,280
I know, right?

301
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:15,720
On the air anymore.

302
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:16,960
Remember what happened last time?

303
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:18,040
My bad.

304
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:20,240
But we'll make you feel better that it's written in Rust.

305
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:24,960
I like my summoning the old ones to be memory safe, I do.

306
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:25,960
Exactly.

307
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:27,840
I will put a link to that in the show notes.

308
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:28,840
Just like the new Pop!

309
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:29,840
The West desktop environment.

310
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:30,840
Boom, I got it in there.

311
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:31,840
Oh, you did.

312
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:32,840
Oh, wow.

313
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:35,480
I thought we'd get through the whole episode and not bring it up.

314
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:36,480
You think it's real?

315
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:37,960
It is real, isn't it?

316
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:38,960
It's real.

317
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:44,040
I sent a whole list of questions off to Carl, but as of this morning, because this is Monday

318
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:46,080
morning, he hasn't gotten back to me.

319
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:47,480
And he's probably not going to.

320
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:49,760
I kind of knew it was going to go this way, to be honest with you.

321
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:55,680
In my Linux Unplugged predictions episode, I predicted they'd at least fork Gnome because

322
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:58,800
they're building on top of it quite a bit and then the base changes out underneath them

323
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:02,040
and then they have to rewrite everything and then they end up spending all their time doing

324
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:03,400
that.

325
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:08,600
But from scratch, written in Rust, I honestly could see it.

326
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:12,720
You know, so I think the knee-jerk reaction to that story is, oh great, another desktop

327
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:13,720
environment for Linux.

328
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:17,320
I gotta say, the Hacker News comments were rough.

329
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:22,020
You know, System76 sits in a very unique position that other free software desktop environments

330
00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:23,020
don't have.

331
00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:27,180
They have an extremely tight feedback loop with the people that they're selling hardware

332
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:33,160
to that runs these environments and then they're providing ongoing support.

333
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:36,880
So they have a real unique insight into how it's working for people, what works, what

334
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:37,880
doesn't work.

335
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:42,520
They have a much tighter feedback loop with actual customers that are paying for a product

336
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:47,200
and using the thing they're creating than just about anybody does except for Apple and

337
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:50,720
maybe Microsoft with the Surface and all the metrics they have in Windows.

338
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:55,520
But like on the Linux side, I don't really think any other free desktop environment has

339
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:59,280
that tight of a feedback loop with their end users.

340
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:05,440
Really that kind of puts somebody in the perfect position to learn what isn't working and iterate

341
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:06,440
quickly.

342
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:10,760
I mean, I don't know, I could see something that's a desktop environment that's Rust based,

343
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:17,280
maybe it sits on top of Mudder and has a bunch of GTK user land applications, essentially

344
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:19,640
a modern Maté, perhaps.

345
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:23,080
Oh, a modern Maté.

346
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:25,480
Why you gotta slap them with your backhand like that?

347
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:26,760
No, Maté is great.

348
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:31,600
It's just, it's old school, you know, or a modern, or retake on Budgie desktop or, you

349
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:32,600
know, whatever.

350
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:34,120
I just want to throw it out there.

351
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:37,900
Make Linux brown again.

352
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:38,900
Bring it back.

353
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:41,320
Now, there was some with the canonical guys.

354
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:45,840
If you really want to do it, if you're going to have that fight, steal their old branding,

355
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:50,680
brown to the core menu, brown taskbar, brown, right?

356
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:54,220
There is aspects of this that remind me of when canonical just went, ah, screw it.

357
00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:55,220
We're doing Unity.

358
00:17:55,220 --> 00:17:56,220
We can't stand this.

359
00:17:56,220 --> 00:17:59,920
I think we're going to be covering this for three years.

360
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:03,640
Well, the one thing that'll be interesting to see is if they can make a nice power user

361
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:04,640
desktop.

362
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:08,400
Like the thing I think they kind of proved out with Pop OS is they're pretty good at

363
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:13,720
like sizing up a target audience and then building features for that target audience.

364
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:18,200
And I could see them continuing to just sort of execute on that, like the key bindings

365
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:23,160
for all the window management, the tiling, that kind of stuff, the performance modes.

366
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:26,440
That's all stuff that they've added that kind of makes the Ubuntu desktop a little more

367
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:29,000
out of the box power user friendly.

368
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:33,200
Well, moving right along, like you said earlier, we do have some Python on Windows love here

369
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:36,680
and maybe this will be useful for anyone else out there that's thinking about setting this

370
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:37,680
up.

371
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:41,400
Listener Chris P writes in and he created a guide that I thought was pretty dang good.

372
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:42,520
So we wanted to give it a shout out.

373
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:46,160
He says, I know you've had a few folks right in looking for help getting started with Python

374
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:47,160
on Windows.

375
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:51,480
I've seen a bunch of confusion swirling around of late with folks recommending various things,

376
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:55,920
including WSL as a cure all, which it isn't.

377
00:18:55,920 --> 00:19:00,960
I mean, it is awesome, he says, but it's probably not the best way for a newbie to start coding

378
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:02,040
in Python.

379
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:04,720
So I wrote a blog post that I thought might help.

380
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:08,680
Now we don't always feature these, so you don't have to spam us with your blog posts.

381
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:11,760
But I thought that Listener Chris here did a great job.

382
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:16,600
So I wanted to toss a link in the show notes because it's just recently been updated.

383
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:21,560
So if you're looking for something that is current as of November 6, 2021 on getting

384
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:24,880
started with Python on Windows, well, he's got it for you.

385
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:27,700
And I will drop a link to this in the chat room if you're listening live and I'll put

386
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:32,000
a link to it in the show notes for those of you listening after the fact, which is 99

387
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,360
point nine eight percent of you.

388
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:38,400
And I don't know, I just think that's kind of a kind of a nice little resource there.

389
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,160
I don't suppose I have any comments on it.

390
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:42,040
Yeah, no, I think that's great.

391
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:46,560
If you're if you're living in Windows land or you're thinking of, let's say, your Windows

392
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:51,400
curious, this is the I mean, this is a great resource, you know, and not even being a big

393
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:52,400
Windows user anymore.

394
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:55,920
I know enough that I could follow that and I think I could get it set up so that passes

395
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:56,920
the bar.

396
00:19:56,920 --> 00:20:02,560
And then last but not least, continue to trend of recommendations from the audience.

397
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:06,880
PowerShell on Linux DM recommended something that I think is pretty killer.

398
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:13,520
So last week, I kind of just got really excited about Bumper, which is an app for the Mac.

399
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:18,000
It replaces whatever you might have as your default browser as your default browser.

400
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:24,140
So you set Bumper as your default browser on the Mac and then whenever you click a hyperlink

401
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:30,680
anywhere in the OS, instead of launching a browser, it launches a super lightweight,

402
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:35,500
very quick icon menu with icons of each browser you have.

403
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:41,280
You select that icon, say Chrome, and then Bumper launches Chrome and sends Chrome the

404
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:44,780
link and opens the page in Chrome or whatever browser you choose.

405
00:20:44,780 --> 00:20:48,560
And this is a great way for those of us that live the multi browser lifestyle to be really

406
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:51,200
intentional about what browsers open what links.

407
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:52,800
I love this.

408
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:56,960
I would love for somebody to make this for Linux, I very much would love to have it.

409
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:00,440
Well, DM says, hey, you can thank me later.

410
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:03,120
They have this for Android, so we'll put a link to this in the show notes.

411
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:09,160
It's called Better Open With and it lets you choose between the default or another app

412
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:12,160
you may have installed on Android for like browsers or email.

413
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:16,240
And I actually really like this because I think that the line on Android is like, never

414
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:21,360
ask me again or ask me every time I do a thing, which I just don't like.

415
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:23,520
And so Better Open With solves that.

416
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:24,920
And this is a really great little app.

417
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:28,560
So I will put a link to that in the show notes.

418
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:32,200
We'd love to get your emails too or your links or recommendations for great apps that make

419
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:37,160
any platform better to use, Windows, Linux, Mac OS, Android, iOS, let us know what you're

420
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:38,160
doing.

421
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:39,980
Go to coder.show slash contact.

422
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:43,820
I'll give you an example of kind of what I was thinking about, thinking about things

423
00:21:43,820 --> 00:21:46,560
that make us a little more productive.

424
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:53,960
I really recommend you go on Amazon and you buy yourself a pack of NFC tags.

425
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:54,960
Have you tried this, Mike?

426
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:55,960
These NFC tags?

427
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:58,340
For customers, but not personally.

428
00:21:58,340 --> 00:22:02,540
So either Android or iOS, but of course I have a little more experience now with iOS,

429
00:22:02,540 --> 00:22:05,820
you can build actions based on these tags.

430
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:11,120
So for example, here in the studio, I have an NFC tag that when I touch the tip of my

431
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:14,480
phone and now in the later versions of iOS, it's all automatic.

432
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:16,440
There's no prompting, no interaction.

433
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:23,760
I tap the tip of my phone on this NFC tag and it changes my focus mode to recording

434
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:27,420
and that does a whole bunch of stuff on the back end, even turns on lights in the studio

435
00:22:27,420 --> 00:22:28,560
and everything.

436
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:32,080
And then when I leave, I have another NFC tag that I can tap and it turns that focus

437
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:33,660
mode off.

438
00:22:33,660 --> 00:22:36,760
And I have something at night when I'm going to bed and because my phone charger is near

439
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:41,840
the bed, I tap that NFC tag and it starts turning off the lights and you can do this

440
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:46,760
with shortcuts on iOS using the automations tab or you can do it with things like Home

441
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:47,760
Assistant.

442
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:49,040
There's a few options out there.

443
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:52,140
It's one of these little things that you can put these tags next to your charger or on

444
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:58,840
your desk where if say your phone starts buzzing, you could have a do not disturb tag that you

445
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:03,720
just pick your phone up, you tap this tag with it and now your device is no longer buzzing

446
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:04,720
at you.

447
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:07,740
You don't have to sit there and fiddle with unlocking it and pulling down a menu and anything

448
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:08,880
like that.

449
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:12,720
It's really kind of nice and it just moves things out a little bit.

450
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:14,320
So that's a tip for you right there.

451
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:15,640
Go get yourself some NFC tags.

452
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:16,640
They're super cheap.

453
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:17,640
They have nice ones.

454
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:18,640
They have cheap ones.

455
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:19,640
They all do the same.

456
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:23,320
And if you have any other recommendations for software productivity or little tweaks

457
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:25,840
to your work environment, I'd like to collect those.

458
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:31,200
So go to coder.show slash contact and send them in.

459
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:32,680
lino.com slash coder.

460
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:36,800
Go there to get $100 in 60 day credit on a new account and you go there to support the

461
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:37,800
show.

462
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:38,800
Lock that into your memory banks.

463
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:41,280
Go to lino.com slash coder.

464
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:44,840
Then when you need to host something in the cloud, not only can you use the best provider

465
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:47,120
to do it, but you can support the show.

466
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:50,740
You know, Linode is our hosting provider for everything since we've gone independent.

467
00:23:50,740 --> 00:23:55,040
Every service, anything that faces the audience that we've built, anything that our team uses

468
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:59,140
to collaborate, we've deployed it all on Linode.

469
00:23:59,140 --> 00:24:00,600
And there's a lot of reasons for that.

470
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:04,640
First of all, the infrastructure is super solid, like we just don't have downtime.

471
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:06,280
There's awesome performance.

472
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:08,840
That is maybe number one for me.

473
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:13,200
And I really have appreciated as time has gone on how we just focus on the project or

474
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:18,460
the service we're trying to stand up and not on all the little details of infrastructure.

475
00:24:18,460 --> 00:24:19,800
That's what Linode nails.

476
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:24,040
You get 11 data centers to choose from and every service level is backed by the best

477
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:26,880
support in the business.

478
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:31,480
And man, when that matters, it makes all the difference.

479
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:35,280
You know, Linode has been focused on being the best at running things on Linux in the

480
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:37,600
cloud since 2003.

481
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:42,880
They've been at this for 18 years and they're independently funded and they got into it

482
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:44,880
because of a passion for the technology.

483
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:49,060
And you know, I can really relate with that and I suspect I don't have to tell you guys

484
00:24:49,060 --> 00:24:53,520
out there that it makes a difference when a company is actually passionate about the

485
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:54,520
product they make.

486
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:58,800
You know, it's not just a group of bean counters that got together and figured out how they

487
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:03,000
could make a bunch of money in cloud and then launched a product that's backed by a bunch

488
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,000
of VCs.

489
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:11,120
They started because, well, they're geeks and they really liked this stuff and I think

490
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:16,080
long term that gets baked into every decision a company makes.

491
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:20,080
It's how they view the world, it's how they think about their product and when you zoom

492
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:26,700
out over 18 years, all those little decisions add up and it makes something truly unique.

493
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:28,140
So go try it out for yourself.

494
00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:33,040
That $100 means you actually can try it and go see what I've been talking about and support

495
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:34,040
the show.

496
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:35,040
Linode.com.

497
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:43,520
I don't want to spend too much time on this, but all of the Apple press, there's so many

498
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:48,560
podcasts, so many websites and blogs and full time professionals, all they do is talk about

499
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:57,860
Apple and they're not talking about this horrendously cringy speech that Craig Federighi, everybody

500
00:25:57,860 --> 00:26:01,120
loves Craig Federighi in the Mac community, in the Apple community.

501
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:08,800
He went out, did a talk about how bad sideloading is and I think because it was on LinkedIn,

502
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:16,000
nobody really bothered to watch it, but I did and it's really, really rough.

503
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:23,440
Essentially what's going on is Apple is taking issue with a new law that's in the works across

504
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:24,640
the pond.

505
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:30,320
It's called the Digital Markets Act and the Digital Markets Act requires the ability for

506
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:36,120
phones to have sideloading apps and Craig, you don't like that too much.

507
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:44,920
But today there is one provision of the DMA that I think deserves a little more consideration.

508
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:49,700
Specifically I want to talk today about sideloading and why requiring it on iPhone would be a

509
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:53,920
step backwards in our privacy and security journey.

510
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:59,320
He then takes 10 minutes to make a really tortured analogy about the security of a house

511
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:05,560
and allowing burglars to just come in and he says, we don't need this, these new provisions,

512
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:07,800
we don't need it because Apple's been getting it right.

513
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:10,720
Look how good we've been that proves we don't need sideloading.

514
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:15,860
Long story short, iPhone security approach has worked, but you don't have to take my

515
00:27:15,860 --> 00:27:23,160
word for it because the security community regularly says things like this, quote, Apple's

516
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:28,820
iOS devices are the most secure consumer hardware ever made.

517
00:27:28,820 --> 00:27:33,400
But let's look at some numbers because when we compare iOS to other platforms, a clear

518
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:35,840
story emerges.

519
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:41,600
Here's a graph showing third party data on malware infections by platform and you can

520
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:45,040
see iPhone barely registers.

521
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:49,680
But the level of attacks on other platforms is a different story.

522
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:55,340
One security firm found more than 5 million attacks per month on its clients using another

523
00:27:55,340 --> 00:28:00,760
mobile platform, but there's never been this kind of widespread consumer malware attack

524
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:04,600
on iOS, never.

525
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:05,600
So what's the difference?

526
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:14,440
Well, the single biggest reason is that other platforms allow sideloading, done, done, done.

527
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:22,800
Yeah, sideloading is so dangerous because you see, even if it's off by default, people

528
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:28,600
could be socially engineered into turning it on and that essentially makes us all vulnerable.

529
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:32,760
And so he kind of brings it home back to this tortured house analogy he's been making the

530
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:36,220
entire time and really makes the pitch.

531
00:28:36,220 --> 00:28:38,880
So now let's return back to our favorite house.

532
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:41,040
As you remember, you made a choice.

533
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:45,240
You wanted to protect your family, so you bought a really safe home with a really great

534
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:50,800
security system and you're really glad you did because since you first moved in, the

535
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:57,480
burglars have never been more creative or more plentiful and in the real world of cybersecurity,

536
00:28:57,480 --> 00:28:59,720
this couldn't be more true.

537
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:04,920
Attackers are virtually dressing up as mailmen, building tunnels underground and trying to

538
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:08,480
scale your backyard walls with grappling hooks.

539
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:13,120
In this world, some of your neighbors are suffering repeated break-ins, but the home

540
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:17,320
you have has kept you safe.

541
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:23,560
But then that new law gets passed and in the noble pursuit of say more optimized package

542
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:29,080
delivery, your town requires everyone to build an always unlocked side door on the ground

543
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:30,860
floor of their homes.

544
00:29:30,860 --> 00:29:36,140
Now some of your neighbors, they love this idea, but you're not so sure because you know

545
00:29:36,140 --> 00:29:40,280
that once the side door is built, anyone can walk through it.

546
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:46,680
The safe house that you chose now has a fatal flaw in its security system and burglars are

547
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:49,880
really good at exploiting it.

548
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:54,680
In a nutshell, sideloading is that unlocked side door.

549
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:55,980
So there you go.

550
00:29:55,980 --> 00:30:00,040
That's Apple's position and they are doubling down so hard on this.

551
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:02,760
That is not Apple's real position.

552
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:06,880
So if you want the good app store coverage, you got to read the financial press like a

553
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:12,560
market watch or Bloomberg because one of my favorite opinion pieces has been how much

554
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:15,480
does Apple make on the app store?

555
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:21,520
They're basically just quoting the epic lawyers and financial analyst, just mocking Tim Phil

556
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:25,760
Schiller on the stand being like, I don't know if it's profitable.

557
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:29,860
Well couldn't you infer that 30% of whatever number you admitted to as the revenue would

558
00:30:29,860 --> 00:30:30,860
be $20 billion.

559
00:30:30,860 --> 00:30:33,480
So you're saying 20 billion is not a profit.

560
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:38,080
I don't know, pulling teeth they had to admit that the section of their business, which

561
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:43,960
includes the app store is 70.1% profitable, but they refuse and they say not only do they

562
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:50,720
refuse, they say they simply do not have the accounting controls in the company to know

563
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:53,220
which percentage of that is in the app store.

564
00:30:53,220 --> 00:30:54,380
Can't be known.

565
00:30:54,380 --> 00:30:55,380
Can't be tracked.

566
00:30:55,380 --> 00:30:59,160
It can't be known because you don't want to know, because if there's any record from

567
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:05,440
PricewaterhouseCoop or whoever their big five or big three accounting firm now is, that's

568
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:07,360
like subpoenable, right?

569
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:08,700
You don't want to know.

570
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:09,700
It's laughable.

571
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:15,120
Protecting a house, a very big house in Palo Alto with lots of shiny things.

572
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:16,200
How cringe is it?

573
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:17,440
How cringe is that?

574
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:18,480
It's cringe.

575
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:20,880
It's also cringe because it's like a web developer conference.

576
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:21,880
Yeah.

577
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:22,880
And he's the last one.

578
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,960
And it's the whole way it's set up is super cringe.

579
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:29,000
Like the audience at first doesn't really know to clap because the way it's set up sounds

580
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,000
bad.

581
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,700
It's 15 minutes of that.

582
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:33,920
It's 15 minutes of that.

583
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:39,240
And while I completely 100% agree with your take, their public position is going to be

584
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:44,080
what Craig just said, and Craig's going to go on all of these different Apple friendly

585
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:48,320
outlets and he's going to very earnestly say it's all about protecting.

586
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:54,520
And their core argument, what it really boils down to is in the name of choice, you're going

587
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:59,680
to strip away people's security and we offer choice, the choice to be secure.

588
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:02,660
If you don't want that, go get an Android phone.

589
00:32:02,660 --> 00:32:06,760
So they claim that it's kind of like this reverse argument that in the name of choice,

590
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:10,080
you're actually taking away choice because you're removing the choice for people to choose

591
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:13,560
iOS as a platform designed the way they have it today.

592
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:16,480
It's interesting that he picks side loaning because I think there is like an actual security

593
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:18,120
argument there.

594
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:22,240
But what he fails to mention in that whole cringe worthy LinkedIn speech at this web

595
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:26,960
conference is like third party payment providers.

596
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:31,000
Like the one that Stripe is making, I believe it's Stripe, maybe it's PayPal.

597
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:37,420
One of them is making one for iOS that would avoid that 30% tax.

598
00:32:37,420 --> 00:32:41,460
This is where you can tell that their entire argument is basically bull right?

599
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:44,460
Because they're trying to protect the 30% fee.

600
00:32:44,460 --> 00:32:49,680
You know what it is, it's because of this digital markets act and this digital markets

601
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:53,400
act is going to enforce the ability to sideload on these platforms.

602
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:55,980
So that's why they're hitting this so hard.

603
00:32:55,980 --> 00:33:00,160
See sideloading is great I think for them because it's hard.

604
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:04,760
The thing I think that would be the real boon or rather the thing that would damage them

605
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:10,760
is that they can't enforce using their AIP system and when I say can't enforce I mean

606
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:13,460
you can't even say it must be an option.

607
00:33:13,460 --> 00:33:15,600
That would screw them over.

608
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:19,280
When I listen to this whole thing all I learned is okay they see their future as a middleman

609
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:23,760
for services and that's just too big a pie to give up.

610
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:28,680
So you know in South Korea there was a judgment that came down that said Apple and Google

611
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:34,800
must allow third-party payment systems and Google has responded and they've updated it

612
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:38,080
now and you can use a third-party payment.

613
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:41,040
You still publish your app to the Play Store.

614
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:45,440
You put in your API information for the payment system and it comes up on what looks like

615
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:50,840
a built-in Android payment screen like it looks completely legit but it's using the

616
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:55,980
payment provider you choose and I don't know if I have the numbers right but Google is

617
00:33:55,980 --> 00:34:01,100
then putting like an 11% transaction charge on top of that so even though you're not going

618
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:06,080
through their payment system they're still charging like a like a 10% or something like

619
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:11,720
that cut to sell an app on Android if you go outside their system.

620
00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:15,760
Yeah because this is about money and being a middleman is one of the best businesses

621
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:16,760
you can be in.

622
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:17,760
Right.

623
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:19,920
That's exactly it yeah.

624
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:23,980
I just say prepare yourselves because I think Apple's gonna fight this one for the reasons

625
00:34:23,980 --> 00:34:29,680
you just said but saying the things that Craig just said like that's something that they

626
00:34:29,680 --> 00:34:34,080
have been working on for a while and Craig hit it as hard as he could he gave it the

627
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:37,700
hardest sell he could and that's why when you watch it I do have a link in the show

628
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:41,760
notes when you watch it it's even cringier when you see him sometimes.

629
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:45,440
It's kind of unfortunate because I have to say I had a pretty good opinion of Craig Federighi

630
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:50,200
before this and this really just shows he's a really good corporate actor.

631
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:54,360
I mean I know he's also good you know apparently boss and technician all that kind of stuff

632
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:58,440
but you watch that video and tell me he's not out there selling.

633
00:34:58,440 --> 00:34:59,440
It's really something.

634
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:02,620
Well I mean they follow their incentives right like any other corporate executives.

635
00:35:02,620 --> 00:35:04,040
I don't know.

636
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:09,320
They can't go tell Wall Street that they're not going to collect this fee.

637
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:12,080
Maybe I'm too essentialist about it but.

638
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:15,380
Well let's put on our and is it and rind or is it rind?

639
00:35:15,380 --> 00:35:16,380
And rant yeah.

640
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:21,280
Here put on your capitals hat for a second like they've built this platform.

641
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:26,720
You know they created this platform and now they have to keep the platform competitive

642
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:31,560
and they have to keep investing in it like they have to make this money because you know

643
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:33,240
that's how they're going to make money on the platform going forward.

644
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:35,680
Now they've sold the hardware and they still have costs.

645
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:37,200
I mean I don't I don't know.

646
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:40,720
I could see actually the way Google is doing it in South Korea.

647
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:43,400
I could see that being reasonable if it was like three percent.

648
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:47,560
Yeah this will be in court for five years.

649
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:49,320
Shortcut dot com slash coder.

650
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:53,240
Have you ever really been happy with your project management tool?

651
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:58,640
I mean most are either just too simple for a growing team or they're way too complex

652
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:00,420
for anyone to actually want to use them.

653
00:36:00,420 --> 00:36:04,560
So someone has to constantly prod everyone to use the tool.

654
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:07,040
Shortcut formerly known as clubhouse.

655
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:08,080
They're different though.

656
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:09,440
They're different because they're worse.

657
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:10,440
Wait oh wait.

658
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:11,440
No.

659
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:12,440
No actually no.

660
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:13,440
No really.

661
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:14,440
It's quite better.

662
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:18,400
Shortcut is project management built specifically for software teams and they're fast.

663
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:19,400
It's intuitive.

664
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:20,400
It's flexible.

665
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:23,280
It's powerful and a lot of really nice positive adjectives that they've earned.

666
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:24,280
Trust me.

667
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:27,920
But let's look at some of their highlights so you can see what I'm talking about.

668
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:29,840
Shortcuts got team based workflows.

669
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:33,320
Individual teams can use shortcuts default workflows or customize them to match the way

670
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:34,320
they work.

671
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:38,480
They have organizational wide goals and roadmaps.

672
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:42,060
You can work in these workflows and see how they're automatically tied to larger company

673
00:36:42,060 --> 00:36:43,060
goals.

674
00:36:43,060 --> 00:36:48,260
And it just takes one click to move from a roadmap to a team's work or even individual

675
00:36:48,260 --> 00:36:50,760
updates and vice versa.

676
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:55,480
And has tight VCS integrations so if you use GitHub or GitLab or Bitbucket, Shortcut ties

677
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:59,800
directly to those so you can update progress from the command line.

678
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:03,760
And speaking of keyboard friendly interfaces well Shortcut sets the bar.

679
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:07,840
In fact they have a power bar allowing you to do just virtually anything without touching

680
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:08,840
your mouse.

681
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:10,840
You can throw that thing in the trash.

682
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:14,120
Oh and iterations planning.

683
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:18,760
Set weekly priorities and then let Shortcut run the schedule for you with accompanying

684
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:21,120
burn down charts and other reporting.

685
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:23,520
So go give it a try and support the show.

686
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:25,480
Shortcut.com slash coder.

687
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:28,520
Again Shortcut.com slash coder.

688
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:32,680
Shortcut formerly known as Clubhouse because you shouldn't have to project manage your

689
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:34,120
project management.

690
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:38,000
Shortcut.com slash coder.

691
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,000
So now let's talk about.NET.

692
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,960
I think you're going to like this a lot more.

693
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:47,200
.NET 6 is out and I'm not even really in the.NET community and I'm pretty impressed by

694
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:48,200
this release.

695
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:49,200
Yeah.

696
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:50,760
I mean there you know there's a lot going on here.

697
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:54,960
There was a whole controversy about the live reload thing in VS Code.

698
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:57,960
I think that's been covered to death and I don't think we need to cover it.

699
00:37:57,960 --> 00:38:02,720
But once again you know bottom line business incentives sometimes interfere with people's

700
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:05,320
other goals.

701
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:06,440
Hot Reload did make it though.

702
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:07,440
It is in.

703
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:10,960
It did make it and it was kind of a messy way it made it.

704
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:18,400
Yeah so it's you know.NET 6 it's a lot of quality of life improvements for you you honorable

705
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:21,960
C sharp developers working in the enterprise that will never be allowed to update it for

706
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:22,960
two years.

707
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:27,280
I don't there's nothing like there's the compile ahead of time stuff.

708
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:31,160
I have lots of skeptical thoughts about that.

709
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:35,560
And I say rightfully so they've kind of taken passes at this over the years although yeah

710
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:37,440
you know now they say they've really gotten it.

711
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:38,440
I think this is interesting.

712
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:43,480
So ahead of time compilation it essentially gives you some performance in some areas you

713
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:48,320
know reduce the startup time and things like that and the only downside is supposedly is

714
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:51,240
that these different implementations have always had all these different compromises

715
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:52,240
you've had to make.

716
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:55,240
So I don't know anything about this but I was reading through on Twitter and it seems

717
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:59,400
like there's several people that have been using this like several well-known developers

718
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:03,240
that have been using this in their environments for months now already.

719
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:09,480
In fact that theme is in several of the major features throughout.NET 6.

720
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:12,720
Microsoft in their release notes really stresses the fact that they've been running this in

721
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:18,480
production on Azure for months now but there's also like they've clearly worked with certain

722
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:23,760
developers in the.NET community and given them like kind of like hands-on time to get

723
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:27,000
them to start using.NET 6 a while ago.

724
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:31,440
And so they've been using it for a while and that's that is a very it's it's really interesting

725
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:36,800
how all in Microsoft is here in fact I recommend everybody read through the release notes because

726
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:40,360
they're in there talking about like how they're tracking Debian releases and timing the release

727
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:45,300
cadence with that and there's all kinds of like really deep thought through processes

728
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:50,480
that they're doing in the community and there's a shout out in there too for Apple development

729
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:54,840
support team that sent them some ARM Macs like months before their main release so that

730
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:59,080
way they could get working on.NET 6 compatibility for the M1.

731
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:05,800
In fact the whole ARM 64 support looks really good for Linux, Windows, and the Mac.

732
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:08,680
It seems like this is a release that's firing in all cylinders.

733
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:14,000
Yeah I'm trying I'm trying not to throw too much cold water on it.

734
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:17,520
I don't know I was reading through all these announcements and I just realized in the last

735
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:22,740
let's say five years C sharp has become such an just huge language.

736
00:40:22,740 --> 00:40:25,260
There's so many different ways to do things.

737
00:40:25,260 --> 00:40:28,600
One of the features that I would normally be excited about but I'm jaded is that this

738
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:31,160
.NET single binary for all platforms.

739
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:33,120
Oh yeah see I thought that was great.

740
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:34,120
I don't believe it.

741
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:36,340
There's gonna be a lot of restrictions on that.

742
00:40:36,340 --> 00:40:41,080
And also like I could tell you at TMB we're doing some Maui development now.

743
00:40:41,080 --> 00:40:42,080
It's very new.

744
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:44,520
Man that's where I was gonna go next.

745
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:50,880
Yeah Xamarin Forms because it's basically becoming Maui in some weird way is also kind

746
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:55,780
of busted now which Xamarin Forms you could argue has been busted for ever.

747
00:40:55,780 --> 00:41:00,400
So I don't know I feel like you know.NET is a great development environment don't get

748
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:03,440
me wrong but Microsoft keeps like this is the Holy Grail.

749
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:04,560
It's not just Microsoft right.

750
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:07,100
It's right once run everywhere.

751
00:41:07,100 --> 00:41:09,040
Java's been talking about this since the 90s.

752
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:10,540
Everybody's wanted this.

753
00:41:10,540 --> 00:41:12,040
It's hard right.

754
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:13,200
It's always gonna be hard.

755
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:16,520
It's the reason I can't run Age of Empires 4 on my Mac.

756
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:22,500
I don't necessarily think it's gonna be as beautiful as they would have you see in their

757
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:27,660
somewhat odd very produced videos they've been producing over the last week.

758
00:41:27,660 --> 00:41:28,660
They sure are.

759
00:41:28,660 --> 00:41:31,980
I was actually because I was jumping around a little bit I was like whoa what is going

760
00:41:31,980 --> 00:41:32,980
on here.

761
00:41:32,980 --> 00:41:33,980
This is pretty interesting.

762
00:41:33,980 --> 00:41:39,040
I mean I appreciate the effort on the production myself but you're right it is massive and

763
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:43,080
it's a bit overwhelming at this point and I can't really speak to the quality of any

764
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:44,480
of these things.

765
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:49,040
A lot of times with Microsoft it takes them three releases to kind of get it right and

766
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:53,040
then depending on the product they either go horizontal for a while and then it takes

767
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:55,240
them like another three releases to really get it right.

768
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:58,280
And so I don't know where we are in that phase with Microsoft because I don't have hands

769
00:41:58,280 --> 00:41:59,880
on experience with this stuff.

770
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:04,600
Sure but like this isn't just like a Windows SDK release or like the language stuff I think

771
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:05,600
is fine.

772
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:10,500
Like my preference for languages to be smaller and somewhat simpler is like back to my Objective

773
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:12,380
C days and whatever.

774
00:42:12,380 --> 00:42:17,840
Even Python I'm like Python 3.10 it's kind of getting larger I don't know.

775
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:21,320
The Maui stuff is it's like the holy grail.

776
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:26,540
If they actually pull it off where you don't have to think about the platform or the desktop

777
00:42:26,540 --> 00:42:32,200
environment then they will have solved the problem a software engineering problem that

778
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:36,480
has since been up till now unsolvable.

779
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:41,880
The closest actual solution has been the web browser right the DOM but the DOM comes with

780
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:46,520
a lot of tradeoffs even today and you know November of 2021.

781
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:51,000
I'm skeptical because the claim is so big right.

782
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:58,100
And also the other big feature they're pushing in VS 2022 the kind of AI code assistant thing.

783
00:42:58,100 --> 00:43:00,440
I don't like GitHub pilot.

784
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:03,040
I don't want that built into my editor.

785
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:08,240
I have lots of concerns about potential license violations if they regurgitate GPL code.

786
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:13,560
It's just not the kind of thing I would rather just better IntelliSense via you know semantic

787
00:43:13,560 --> 00:43:18,520
just like the normal semantic crap that all these code completion things have been using

788
00:43:18,520 --> 00:43:23,080
forever not AI scanning open GitHub repos.

789
00:43:23,080 --> 00:43:24,080
That's my soapbox.

790
00:43:24,080 --> 00:43:25,760
I know people are excited about it.

791
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:26,760
I follow you.

792
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:30,000
Let me see if I can wow you about Maui though just for a second.

793
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,000
Sure.

794
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:34,680
Because I guess what I would do is I would try to present to you that perhaps the table

795
00:43:34,680 --> 00:43:39,760
is set differently now than all the promises since Java.

796
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:45,440
Because if you think about the scope of what Maui is promising when you just think about

797
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:51,120
how big of a job that is it almost seems impossible on its own right.

798
00:43:51,120 --> 00:43:55,880
But if there was any company that would just stick with it for a while and throw tons of

799
00:43:55,880 --> 00:44:01,040
resources at it and take on a crazy thing like that it would be Microsoft like Sun was

800
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:03,160
never Sun was never in that position.

801
00:44:03,160 --> 00:44:04,160
No it wouldn't.

802
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:05,160
Wait wait wait wait wait.

803
00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:08,800
They've owned Xamarin for how long now and Xamarin forms is still a wreck.

804
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:09,800
I'm sorry.

805
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:10,800
Right.

806
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:11,800
No I know.

807
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:12,800
I know.

808
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:13,800
But here's the thing.

809
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:14,800
Here's the thing.

810
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:15,800
This time it's different.

811
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:19,480
I think and of course this is the Linux hippie in me but this time it's different.

812
00:44:19,480 --> 00:44:20,480
It's open source.

813
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:26,480
So even if Microsoft say Microsoft plows away at this for another five years and says you

814
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:32,880
know what everything through edge now WebAssembly Microsoft active WebAssembly we're done with

815
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:33,880
all this right.

816
00:44:33,880 --> 00:44:34,880
It's just crazy.

817
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:35,880
It's open source.

818
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:39,280
There's so much community momentum now that they'll never let it go.

819
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:41,280
So it will never stop at this point.

820
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:43,880
Maui is going to outlive you and I.

821
00:44:43,880 --> 00:44:44,880
Yeah.

822
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:45,880
Well of course.

823
00:44:45,880 --> 00:44:48,000
I mean VB like ASP classic is still around.

824
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:49,520
I'm not saying it's going to die.

825
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:55,960
I'm just saying think about think about the task they are attempting to take here.

826
00:44:55,960 --> 00:44:57,600
Let's take your five year timeline.

827
00:44:57,600 --> 00:45:03,720
Let's say they're perfecting things on GNOME KDE you know all the whatever the GTK desktops

828
00:45:03,720 --> 00:45:06,480
and they're perfecting Aqua.

829
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:11,680
Well I don't know man I was looking old in the tooth in five years will it still be Aqua.

830
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:15,800
Windows made the deal with the devil to support everything forever.

831
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:19,640
Trust me I was in the registry the other this morning it was terrible.

832
00:45:19,640 --> 00:45:22,960
The platforms aren't going to stay still.

833
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:28,440
And I have done so much different development that I can tell you that even today Xamarin

834
00:45:28,440 --> 00:45:32,780
has significant problems on Android and I don't care what you say I don't care what

835
00:45:32,780 --> 00:45:38,080
third party library you want me to download you shouldn't have to write that Xamarin labs

836
00:45:38,080 --> 00:45:43,160
crap it should either be in Xamarin or it should frankly not exist.

837
00:45:43,160 --> 00:45:46,520
I was an early adopter of Xamarin when they were an independent company.

838
00:45:46,520 --> 00:45:50,280
It was beautiful on iOS that had nothing to do with them.

839
00:45:50,280 --> 00:45:54,400
That had everything to do with iOS was native code or rendering images.

840
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:59,520
You could not have a list view with images in it like a table view on Android without

841
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:02,680
it crashing either stuttering or on lower end phones just running out of memory and

842
00:46:02,680 --> 00:46:03,680
blowing up.

843
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:07,400
And the answer was what they call at the time custom renders which is basically just give

844
00:46:07,400 --> 00:46:10,560
up the advantage of cross platform and write a native view.

845
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:15,040
Which if you're going to do that do it in C++ and write everything native maintain your

846
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:19,920
own little gooey library or just use the native gooey widgets right just you can call back

847
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:24,160
into a C++ binary and actually have something that's good.

848
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:27,760
So I think I see what you're saying you're saying not only is it just obvious that the

849
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:35,320
task is too large of a scope and never going to be completed but history shows us that

850
00:46:35,320 --> 00:46:39,680
by the time they get somewhere all of the other platforms will be changing and they'll

851
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:40,680
need to update.

852
00:46:40,680 --> 00:46:44,200
Well there'll be a new platform right there'll be a new platform.

853
00:46:44,200 --> 00:46:45,920
Constantly catching up constantly chasing.

854
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:51,560
Of course this is a problem even with what I colloquially call Xamarin classic which

855
00:46:51,560 --> 00:46:55,960
was not with the form stuff for like they would always be especially right in the beginning

856
00:46:55,960 --> 00:47:00,160
when they were independent racing to catch up with the IOS features that would come out

857
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:03,120
and there would be bugs and there would be issues and you'd have to patch and you'd be

858
00:47:03,120 --> 00:47:05,120
running a pre-release versions.

859
00:47:05,120 --> 00:47:10,480
I don't know I'm cautious sure so somebody says I think Xamarin is a good tool if you

860
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:14,800
know that you have let's say I can give you a real world example we know we want to target

861
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:19,240
Windows tablets and we may want to one day port to Android.

862
00:47:19,240 --> 00:47:23,240
That's a use case where as long as you know what you're doing you avoid the edge cases

863
00:47:23,240 --> 00:47:28,400
and Android but this idea that I'm going to write a single MSI or X here whatever the

864
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:34,320
binary format is going to be or app image right that's just going to magically render

865
00:47:34,320 --> 00:47:39,200
these GUI elements correctly and look good and not feel like crap on all these different

866
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:46,400
platforms including GTK Linux and mobile seems insane to me.

867
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:50,400
I'd like to mention our friends at a cloud guru have a data preparation for Python course

868
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:55,040
Python can absolutely be a powerful tool for data preparation why not learn how to properly

869
00:47:55,040 --> 00:47:56,040
use it.

870
00:47:56,040 --> 00:47:59,240
So in their course they'll quickly cover how to connect to various database types jump

871
00:47:59,240 --> 00:48:04,160
into using Panda Python packages for data preparation and they'll even look at examples

872
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:10,440
for cleansing data visualizations exploration and of course pre-processing data for machine

873
00:48:10,440 --> 00:48:12,920
learning that is the air after all.

874
00:48:12,920 --> 00:48:15,840
So I have a link in the show notes or you can go to cloudguru.com and search for data

875
00:48:15,840 --> 00:48:21,560
preparation for Python again that's a cloudguru.com data preparation for Python or use the link

876
00:48:21,560 --> 00:48:24,800
in the show notes.

877
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:30,240
We just kind of touched on it but we got to talk about it GitHub has a new CEO and really

878
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:33,800
it seems to me although I don't know but it seems like a kind of a new corporate oversight

879
00:48:33,800 --> 00:48:40,600
structure as well so Nat Friedman is stepping down November 15th Thomas Domke is being promoted

880
00:48:40,600 --> 00:48:45,920
to CEO he was hired by Nat shortly after Microsoft bought GitHub.

881
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:50,680
Domke will report to Julia Lewisohn Lewisohn was directly involved with that hot reload

882
00:48:50,680 --> 00:48:56,400
drama that we kind of just skated right around earlier and Lewisohn was recently promoted

883
00:48:56,400 --> 00:49:02,480
to president of Microsoft's developer division kind of a huge change now as a celebrity and

884
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:09,160
so when he became CEO I think the developer community went okay all right well okay we

885
00:49:09,160 --> 00:49:14,600
got a buffer between Microsoft and GitHub and I don't know Domke Thomas but he himself

886
00:49:14,600 --> 00:49:18,840
says he's not really the visionary type he's just more of the heads down worker type.

887
00:49:18,840 --> 00:49:25,120
I kind of worry that without somebody who has a strong vision and a passion it could

888
00:49:25,120 --> 00:49:32,240
be pretty easy to get rolled over by by corporate control in the new structure not that I would

889
00:49:32,240 --> 00:49:36,200
have any experience with anything like this but you know that just seems like this leaves

890
00:49:36,200 --> 00:49:41,400
GitHub in a little bit more of a precarious position not saying the sky is falling but

891
00:49:41,400 --> 00:49:46,120
I'm left a little uneasy with this change what are your thoughts though maybe I'm wrong

892
00:49:46,120 --> 00:49:50,280
I don't know what do you want GitHub to be trustworthy reliable I want to be able to

893
00:49:50,280 --> 00:49:55,480
count on it like because so much of the community uses it I just don't want there to be any

894
00:49:55,480 --> 00:49:59,520
kind of bad bait and switches well there's going to be the stuff that we've already seen

895
00:49:59,520 --> 00:50:04,680
right somebody puts up a thing to rip DRM off or on region code DVDs or I don't remember

896
00:50:04,680 --> 00:50:10,160
what it was exactly but you know the arm CA whatever it is since the cease and desist

897
00:50:10,160 --> 00:50:14,000
and GitHub takes it down because Microsoft's an American company and has to you know honor

898
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:18,840
US court rulings and co-pilots already a thing co-pilot I think is bad and shouldn't exist

899
00:50:18,840 --> 00:50:25,800
but that's my little pet peeve as I said before I actually am not super upset by what I see

900
00:50:25,800 --> 00:50:30,600
people complaining about the idea that they would tie it closer to Azure and VS code I

901
00:50:30,600 --> 00:50:36,040
really think that especially for junior developers you know Heroku was a game changer for Ruby

902
00:50:36,040 --> 00:50:41,120
developers learning what to do and then they adopted other platforms I don't necessarily

903
00:50:41,120 --> 00:50:46,160
think it's wrong if Microsoft wants to make a few you know a few nickels by saying here

904
00:50:46,160 --> 00:50:51,320
dog we see you have a Python app or Java app or whatever dotnet six app and here's a button

905
00:50:51,320 --> 00:50:55,360
we automatically did the configuration and we'll go ahead and spin up a lambda or whatever

906
00:50:55,360 --> 00:51:00,520
they call their functions they call it Microsoft Azure functions or even just a straight up

907
00:51:00,520 --> 00:51:07,600
Azure you know IAS or open to instance I guess I'm just not worried about that I worry about

908
00:51:07,600 --> 00:51:13,440
the IP implications of code pilot I worry about all the legal stuff with like you get

909
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:20,640
in a lawsuit yeah I know I know but I'm I feel like that is a transitory risk boy I

910
00:51:20,640 --> 00:51:27,240
just feels like GitHub has become one of the key pillars of the internet and you know we've

911
00:51:27,240 --> 00:51:32,200
siloed up a lot of stuff into these islands and it feels like the GitHub islands it's

912
00:51:32,200 --> 00:51:37,000
one that you know you got to pass through for a lot of internet stuff now I don't know

913
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:42,480
I like the idea of somebody that has a real solid personality I don't mean to be disrespectful

914
00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:46,600
to Domka I don't know what he's like at all I've seen some interviews and he seemed kind

915
00:51:46,600 --> 00:51:50,440
of you know like a nice guy I mean I just want to say and you know we have to deal with

916
00:51:50,440 --> 00:51:55,520
the world as it is and we live in a world of pseudo monopolies and Titans right so

917
00:51:55,520 --> 00:52:01,360
if somebody had to own GitHub I'm sure happiest Microsoft and not Oracle true I'm just saying

918
00:52:01,360 --> 00:52:06,140
right like or or frankly even like you know Amazon who we've seen what they do to their

919
00:52:06,140 --> 00:52:12,160
partners quote unquote on the marketplace I I don't know I mean even like Salesforce

920
00:52:12,160 --> 00:52:17,800
has been a reasonable steward of Heroku granted the prices are ridiculous but so this new

921
00:52:17,800 --> 00:52:24,000
corporate structure is such where Domka will report to Louis and and she's now the president

922
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:28,800
of Microsoft developer division I did a little bit of reading on her it seems like she's

923
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:34,480
been pretty integral to a lot of their open source stuff lately so I know her most recent

924
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:39,280
things kind of being kind of being in the middle of the hot reload drama but it seems

925
00:52:39,280 --> 00:52:45,280
if you look beyond just that she was pretty key in the rollout of VS code and some of

926
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:48,240
the other open source stuff could just take like a minute to talk about the hot reload

927
00:52:48,240 --> 00:52:53,480
thing because this is where I go back to being evil capitalist where dotnet wants to be flutter

928
00:52:53,480 --> 00:52:57,920
what well okay one if it's a feature you think is good that's fine but now I know I think

929
00:52:57,920 --> 00:53:01,320
it is actually a nice feature I think it's fine right I'm not it doesn't it's not something

930
00:53:01,320 --> 00:53:06,600
that would be like a deal breaker for me but why is it necessarily evil if Microsoft was

931
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:11,240
like yeah man we sell this IDE for like I don't even remember what a visual studio license

932
00:53:11,240 --> 00:53:15,800
costs I remember paying like two grand for them in the past why would it be crazy that

933
00:53:15,800 --> 00:53:19,700
they would have features that are on their commercial product rather than just giving

934
00:53:19,700 --> 00:53:25,360
everything away why would that even be like a problem perhaps the mistake was including

935
00:53:25,360 --> 00:53:31,120
it at all and then taking it away yeah okay but in theory if there's another feature let's

936
00:53:31,120 --> 00:53:38,980
call let's call it you know convert your code into vb6 or whatever and that was a paid feature

937
00:53:38,980 --> 00:53:42,140
and you just had to pay for it why couldn't there be paid features and VS code well we've

938
00:53:42,140 --> 00:53:45,580
gone down that route before and we actually got a few emails that said oh that'll never

939
00:53:45,580 --> 00:53:50,440
happen for these reasons and then we got another email said it's already started so you go

940
00:53:50,440 --> 00:53:56,400
figure I don't really know because I didn't follow closely enough but I guess conceptually

941
00:53:56,400 --> 00:54:01,400
I don't necessarily disagree with you I think what people expect is if something if something's

942
00:54:01,400 --> 00:54:06,680
open source and you contribute it it's kind of in there I guess I have a hard time really

943
00:54:06,680 --> 00:54:10,900
kind of coming up with the complete picture because I just I simply didn't follow close

944
00:54:10,900 --> 00:54:16,480
enough it seems like the main mistake was taking it away giving and taking and then

945
00:54:16,480 --> 00:54:20,820
they really had no choice but to give it back yes you see I guess I'm just like really wanting

946
00:54:20,820 --> 00:54:25,040
them to make a lot of money off making developers more productive without actually like reading

947
00:54:25,040 --> 00:54:30,120
their code and like that's why I'm super down with the deploy to Azure button right I want

948
00:54:30,120 --> 00:54:35,240
there to be whatever you know the equivalent of Visual Studio Enterprise Edition of VS

949
00:54:35,240 --> 00:54:39,760
code even where it's like you pay 300 bucks a month or not a month but a year or five

950
00:54:39,760 --> 00:54:45,040
whatever the number has to be so that they can say okay we are going to make money off

951
00:54:45,040 --> 00:54:49,480
of selling you this product or giving it away as open source and then having kind of an

952
00:54:49,480 --> 00:54:54,280
open core model I know that's a dirty word like the thing that really and I know I keep

953
00:54:54,280 --> 00:54:59,040
hitting this that keeps me up at night is the code pilot stuff and then the new basically

954
00:54:59,040 --> 00:55:03,680
code pilot equivalent in via Visual Studio proper that's the stuff where we're gonna

955
00:55:03,680 --> 00:55:09,560
get into some really murky cases where I mean let's just put it out there if I write something

956
00:55:09,560 --> 00:55:15,720
that code pilot violates the GPL on am I screwed because I committed it I put it out there

957
00:55:15,720 --> 00:55:19,300
I guess technically wouldn't that liability hit me I would think so that would destroy

958
00:55:19,300 --> 00:55:23,140
my whole business right overnight you better be checking every line that thing writes for

959
00:55:23,140 --> 00:55:27,120
you it's not gonna save you much time that's the reason I won't use it right like that

960
00:55:27,120 --> 00:55:33,100
isn't that kind of stuff the true true value of GitHub for Microsoft like the amount of

961
00:55:33,100 --> 00:55:39,440
insights they get to development trends from from all aspects from people who are just

962
00:55:39,440 --> 00:55:45,520
fantastic developers to up-and-coming languages and open source projects the GitHub from like

963
00:55:45,520 --> 00:55:51,680
a data collection standpoint has got to be one of the most valuable sets of users on

964
00:55:51,680 --> 00:55:55,480
the internet especially for a company like Microsoft who's building tools that targets

965
00:55:55,480 --> 00:56:01,900
developers and and a hosting platform like it just seems almost almost invaluable amounts

966
00:56:01,900 --> 00:56:06,640
of data and we don't really talk about GitHub from that standpoint but co-pilot shows us

967
00:56:06,640 --> 00:56:12,120
in a very overt in our face way how they can use the information that's on their platform

968
00:56:12,120 --> 00:56:16,080
and we're not always gonna like it in fact we probably won't know like it and this is

969
00:56:16,080 --> 00:56:20,040
probably just the beginning because this is the real reason they must have bought it right

970
00:56:20,040 --> 00:56:23,920
I think there's lots of reasons I bought it see I give them some credit one of the many

971
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:27,680
one of but I bet you it's if you put them all out there it's got to be on the list because

972
00:56:27,680 --> 00:56:34,200
this isn't getting this kind of insight into developers is intensely valuable and this

973
00:56:34,200 --> 00:56:39,040
is a great opportunity by the way for GitLab to email the show Chris at Jupiter broadcasting.com

974
00:56:39,040 --> 00:56:42,920
let's talk I was gonna say do some advertising on this podcast because you know people are

975
00:56:42,920 --> 00:56:47,140
gonna also be getting less and less comfortable with this arrangement oh I do I do wonder

976
00:56:47,140 --> 00:56:51,000
though as GitHub becomes more and more convenient particularly for small developers and small

977
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:56,900
shops does the attractiveness of hope hosting a GitLab CE instance just kind of start to

978
00:56:56,900 --> 00:57:02,300
go down I don't know I don't think so I think there's gonna be it's both ways it's not a

979
00:57:02,300 --> 00:57:06,940
one or the other they'll be like a backlash yeah exactly exactly and it's getting easy

980
00:57:06,940 --> 00:57:13,280
like Linode's got like a one-click you know one click boom you got GitLab you definitely

981
00:57:13,280 --> 00:57:17,400
need to patch that one click one because there is an exploit that makes it rough do a non-invasive

982
00:57:17,400 --> 00:57:22,760
DDoS attack holy smokes get it patched yeah you always got to do your updates especially

983
00:57:22,760 --> 00:57:26,360
if the image hasn't been updated for a bit go do your updates now thankfully they are

984
00:57:26,360 --> 00:57:31,040
very quick updates because they mirror the repos because it's Ruby you know what I'll

985
00:57:31,040 --> 00:57:36,920
often do really myself is I'll start with the base system that's just like Ubuntu and

986
00:57:36,920 --> 00:57:41,840
Docker and then just go from there myself I prefer it that way I would just before we

987
00:57:41,840 --> 00:57:47,440
