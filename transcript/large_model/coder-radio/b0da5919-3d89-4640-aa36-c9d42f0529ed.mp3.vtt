00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
This is Kota Radio, Episode 407 for March 29th, 2021.

00:15.000 --> 00:18.000
Hey friend, welcome in to Jupiter Broadcasting's weekly talk show,

00:18.000 --> 00:21.000
taking a pragmatic look at the art in the business of software development

00:21.000 --> 00:23.000
and the whole world of technology.

00:23.000 --> 00:26.000
This episode is brought to you by a cloud guru.

00:26.000 --> 00:30.000
A cloud guru now includes Cloud Playground, Azure AWS,

00:30.000 --> 00:32.000
or Google on ACG's credit card, not yours.

00:37.000 --> 00:41.000
My name is Chris, and joining us like the podcaster he is,

00:41.000 --> 00:45.000
even when the young ones awake, it's our host, Mr. Dominic.

00:45.000 --> 00:46.000
Hello, Mike.

00:46.000 --> 00:48.000
The younglings, man, the younglings.

00:48.000 --> 00:51.000
It's like every night they think bedtime's new,

00:51.000 --> 00:52.000
like they don't go to bed every night.

00:52.000 --> 00:55.000
Right, they feel like bedtime is the opposition.

00:55.000 --> 00:57.000
And they fight it.

00:57.000 --> 00:59.000
And I've got good news for you.

00:59.000 --> 01:05.000
As far as I know, it never ends because I've got one that's 11 years old

01:05.000 --> 01:06.000
and he still fights it.

01:06.000 --> 01:10.000
You need to redefine good.

01:10.000 --> 01:11.000
Well, never fear.

01:11.000 --> 01:14.000
To put us in a better mood, that handsome bastard, Wes Payne,

01:14.000 --> 01:15.000
has rejoined us.

01:15.000 --> 01:16.000
Hello, Wes.

01:16.000 --> 01:17.000
Hello.

01:17.000 --> 01:18.000
Hey, Wes.

01:18.000 --> 01:19.000
Thanks for being here.

01:19.000 --> 01:20.000
Thanks for having me.

01:20.000 --> 01:23.000
I have a little thing I wanted to share with the class before we go on.

01:23.000 --> 01:28.000
Wes and I did a little, well, we, I should not take any credit for it.

01:28.000 --> 01:30.000
The only credit I should get is that I'm actually going to make Wes

01:30.000 --> 01:32.000
talk about it and take some credit for it.

01:32.000 --> 01:36.000
A little scoop and move of our J-bot that we use in the chat room

01:36.000 --> 01:39.000
to title our episodes and get all kinds of information.

01:39.000 --> 01:42.000
And while he was at it, he did a little modernization,

01:42.000 --> 01:47.000
a little dash of new libraries and baked it all up in a new container for us

01:47.000 --> 01:52.000
to get it off a totally failing arch box from like 2014, 2015.

01:52.000 --> 01:56.000
So, give us a little, just a little taste of what you did, Wes.

01:56.000 --> 01:58.000
Yeah, I mean, this was kind of an unfortunate situation.

01:58.000 --> 02:01.000
It was an ancient arch box that had not been upgraded

02:01.000 --> 02:05.000
and our previous solution was basically like old style lift and shift.

02:05.000 --> 02:08.000
Like, okay, well, we'll just keep the VM running and everything in there.

02:08.000 --> 02:10.000
We won't look inside, we won't touch it,

02:10.000 --> 02:15.000
and we just hope that it keeps working with a whole bunch of restarts.

02:15.000 --> 02:17.000
That wasn't exactly great or super tenable.

02:17.000 --> 02:20.000
And really, I wanted to get rid of everything in there.

02:20.000 --> 02:25.000
So, I spent some time on Saturday dockerifying this ancient Ruby web app.

02:25.000 --> 02:27.000
So, that was kind of a chore

02:27.000 --> 02:30.000
because a whole bunch of things had changed since then, of course, right?

02:30.000 --> 02:33.000
Various dependency interfaces, breaking changes to libraries.

02:33.000 --> 02:35.000
So, I had to go hunt down, all right, well,

02:35.000 --> 02:38.000
can I just change the code a little bit to make it work with the new version

02:38.000 --> 02:40.000
or do I have to explore, can I pin that dependency?

02:40.000 --> 02:43.000
And if I pin that dependency, does that break any of the dependency resolution

02:43.000 --> 02:46.000
for any of the other gems involved here?

02:46.000 --> 02:50.000
But eventually, with enough little futzing and disabling one feature

02:50.000 --> 02:54.000
that we have to figure out a workaround for, which is the calendar integration,

02:54.000 --> 02:56.000
it actually built the Docker container, started right up,

02:56.000 --> 03:00.000
and now it's running on a shiny new Linode.

03:00.000 --> 03:02.000
No more legacy except for what's in the container,

03:02.000 --> 03:04.000
which is exactly how I want it.

03:04.000 --> 03:07.000
Yay. Yes, and it seems faster.

03:07.000 --> 03:09.000
It does. So, that's nice, too.

03:09.000 --> 03:10.000
It does seem faster.

03:10.000 --> 03:12.000
I mean, we'll see. I put a memory limit on the container.

03:12.000 --> 03:14.000
We'll see if that makes it die

03:14.000 --> 03:18.000
or if we get some better stats about just what's going on in there.

03:18.000 --> 03:22.000
But hopefully now we at least have something that's reusable, replaceable,

03:22.000 --> 03:26.000
manageable until eventually we come up with some better JBot alternative.

03:26.000 --> 03:27.000
Mike, you know what this is?

03:27.000 --> 03:29.000
It's when Wes Payne kicks a can down the road,

03:29.000 --> 03:31.000
he kicks it really far down the road.

03:31.000 --> 03:33.000
He bent it like Beckham, really.

03:33.000 --> 03:36.000
I mean, I have nothing to say. It's fantastic.

03:36.000 --> 03:37.000
It's pretty good.

03:37.000 --> 03:41.000
Wes, I think also, before we go too much further into the show,

03:41.000 --> 03:43.000
I got to also get a closure update.

03:43.000 --> 03:45.000
Hang on. Let me get my barf back and then…

03:45.000 --> 03:47.000
Okay, go on, Wes.

03:47.000 --> 03:48.000
Just a quick one. Just a quick one.

03:48.000 --> 03:51.000
Because we got emails we got to get to, but are you still loving Clojure?

03:51.000 --> 03:53.000
Oh, very much so.

03:53.000 --> 03:55.000
I mean, come on. It's a functional Lisp.

03:55.000 --> 03:56.000
What's not to love there?

03:56.000 --> 03:57.000
There it is.

03:57.000 --> 03:59.000
No, really, I like it because you can take Clojure anywhere.

03:59.000 --> 04:01.000
There's Clojure script running in the browser.

04:01.000 --> 04:03.000
There's a.NET version and, of course, the main version,

04:03.000 --> 04:06.000
which is running on the JVM.

04:06.000 --> 04:09.000
And if you like Python, if you like LISPs,

04:09.000 --> 04:11.000
if you like functional programming,

04:11.000 --> 04:13.000
there's something in there that you'll like in Clojure,

04:13.000 --> 04:15.000
and it just presents a nice, simple way to program.

04:15.000 --> 04:17.000
It's all about using data structures

04:17.000 --> 04:21.000
without a whole bunch of crazy objects and custom APIs.

04:21.000 --> 04:24.000
And when you are on a small team or you just have a job

04:24.000 --> 04:27.000
that doesn't need a giant enterprise set of developers,

04:27.000 --> 04:30.000
Clojure really helps you keep things simple and just get your work done,

04:30.000 --> 04:33.000
focus on the problem at hand, and keep it maintainable.

04:33.000 --> 04:35.000
Get the hell out of here.

04:35.000 --> 04:37.000
Have you heard of objects sending…

04:37.000 --> 04:39.000
Chris knew I was going to jump in on this.

04:39.000 --> 04:42.000
He had the soundboard ready.

04:42.000 --> 04:45.000
Have you heard of objects just sending messages to each other,

04:45.000 --> 04:48.000
including Nil, and being like, meh, whatever?

04:48.000 --> 04:50.000
Yes, I have.

04:50.000 --> 04:52.000
You know, it's really just the objects part.

04:52.000 --> 04:55.000
I'm okay with the message passing and actors and all that,

04:55.000 --> 04:58.000
but there's just this, especially in the Java world,

04:58.000 --> 05:00.000
there's this sort of classes for everything,

05:00.000 --> 05:02.000
objects for everything worldview.

05:02.000 --> 05:04.000
Oh, you know I'm not talking about Java.

05:04.000 --> 05:06.000
True, yes.

05:06.000 --> 05:09.000
You're probably talking about Ruby, unless you mean Smalltalk?

05:09.000 --> 05:12.000
No, I think you meant Swift.

05:12.000 --> 05:15.000
It's definitely not Objective-C.

05:15.000 --> 05:17.000
All right, well, there's no need for hate speech, Chris.

05:17.000 --> 05:20.000
Let's just move on.

05:20.000 --> 05:22.000
I'm sorry, Mike. I'm sorry.

05:22.000 --> 05:24.000
You know, Mike, if you like Nil,

05:24.000 --> 05:27.000
I think you'll find the Nil punning in Clojure very enjoyable.

05:27.000 --> 05:30.000
Oh, my goodness.

05:30.000 --> 05:32.000
That's hurting me too.

05:32.000 --> 05:34.000
This is why we don't do the challenges anymore.

05:34.000 --> 05:37.000
This trolling has got like blowback on me right now.

05:37.000 --> 05:39.000
You asked for it, buddy.

05:39.000 --> 05:40.000
You're right, you're right.

05:40.000 --> 05:43.000
And we definitely have some Ruby stuff that we need to get into.

05:43.000 --> 05:45.000
A lot of people in the Ruby community not having a good week.

05:45.000 --> 05:47.000
We'll explain why.

05:47.000 --> 05:50.000
But you remember that email we got last week from Matt,

05:50.000 --> 05:52.000
the dude from Australia who was really having a tough time of it?

05:52.000 --> 05:54.000
I have a vague recollection, yes.

05:54.000 --> 05:56.000
Yeah, and he was thinking about like, you know, what do I do?

05:56.000 --> 05:57.000
I'm feeling really super trapped.

05:57.000 --> 05:58.000
You know, I have a family.

05:58.000 --> 06:00.000
I'm making a good enough money where I can't quit,

06:00.000 --> 06:02.000
but I'm making not so much great money that I can invest

06:02.000 --> 06:03.000
in something really big.

06:03.000 --> 06:05.000
And he was feeling really stuck.

06:05.000 --> 06:07.000
And we got a couple of people that wrote in.

06:07.000 --> 06:09.000
Chuck wrote in and said, you know, this Matt guy,

06:09.000 --> 06:13.000
he's going through something that I went through at one point, he says.

06:13.000 --> 06:18.000
And he linked a YouTube video that I'll have in the show notes for Matt.

06:18.000 --> 06:22.000
He thinks that what we touched on, a hobby is really what Matt needs.

06:22.000 --> 06:26.000
He says that he calls them professional hobbies.

06:26.000 --> 06:30.000
He's had two in his life, Tai Chi and doing a side programming gig

06:30.000 --> 06:31.000
for a university.

06:31.000 --> 06:35.000
His main job is always paid for the ability to do those side things.

06:35.000 --> 06:38.000
Matt's family is his reward for his sacrifice.

06:38.000 --> 06:42.000
If he gets to complimentary tech hobby like raspberry pies

06:42.000 --> 06:45.000
or maybe he gets into something to that degree that he could share with his kids,

06:45.000 --> 06:48.000
he could use that as a springboard to learn totally new stuff.

06:48.000 --> 06:52.000
And here's a clip from that YouTube video that Chuck passed along

06:52.000 --> 06:54.000
that I thought was kind of great.

06:54.000 --> 06:58.000
Also know a man who said once after years of standing

06:58.000 --> 07:02.000
on the platform of the subway, I die a little bit down there every day,

07:02.000 --> 07:05.000
but I know I'm doing so for my family.

07:05.000 --> 07:10.000
There are small acts of heroism that occur without regard to the nobility

07:10.000 --> 07:12.000
or the notoriety.

07:12.000 --> 07:16.000
And there is something to that, you know, making your family fruitful

07:16.000 --> 07:20.000
and feeding them and providing for them is a reward,

07:20.000 --> 07:22.000
but it's a mindset.

07:22.000 --> 07:25.000
So I think I've been thinking about Matt for the last week,

07:25.000 --> 07:27.000
and I think some of our listeners have too,

07:27.000 --> 07:30.000
but I have an email that came in from Jimmy from New Zealand.

07:30.000 --> 07:33.000
He says, loves the show and we can never take it away from him again.

07:33.000 --> 07:35.000
I don't know.

07:35.000 --> 07:36.000
I think maybe threatening harm there.

07:36.000 --> 07:37.000
I'm not sure.

07:37.000 --> 07:40.000
But he goes on to say, I wanted to touch on that email from Matt in Australia.

07:40.000 --> 07:44.000
I studied network engineering at college and I was finishing my final paper.

07:44.000 --> 07:47.000
I was offered a job overseas in a technical support position.

07:47.000 --> 07:49.000
At the time, it sounded like a great idea.

07:49.000 --> 07:52.000
I was floating around the world a few times to meet up with teams and do training.

07:52.000 --> 07:54.000
My pay was very good for what I needed.

07:54.000 --> 07:56.000
Fast forward six years.

07:56.000 --> 08:01.000
I'm closing in my 30s, still in the same role, and I'm burnt out, bored.

08:01.000 --> 08:04.000
And the pay was really not so good anymore,

08:04.000 --> 08:07.000
especially considering I was about to get married and had to get on the way.

08:07.000 --> 08:10.000
Something in my head just snapped, he says.

08:10.000 --> 08:11.000
I freaked out.

08:11.000 --> 08:14.000
My degree was becoming redundant as technology had moved on.

08:14.000 --> 08:16.000
Plus I had no real skill set.

08:16.000 --> 08:19.000
I'd been doing tech support for niche products for a while.

08:19.000 --> 08:21.000
Oh, crap, he says, I thought.

08:21.000 --> 08:23.000
I wasted all this time.

08:23.000 --> 08:25.000
I'd become complacent with my work because I felt secure.

08:25.000 --> 08:28.000
And now I felt stuck with no way to level up.

08:28.000 --> 08:31.000
Like Matt, I also had an interest in programming.

08:31.000 --> 08:34.000
I'd done a few papers in college and had played around with web apps,

08:34.000 --> 08:36.000
just kind of messing around in my spare time.

08:36.000 --> 08:38.000
I saw an opportunity at my work.

08:38.000 --> 08:40.000
We don't create our products.

08:40.000 --> 08:42.000
We are a reseller who sells their products

08:42.000 --> 08:45.000
and then offers consultancy and tech support on top.

08:45.000 --> 08:48.000
Over the years, I had heard all of the complaints from customers

08:48.000 --> 08:50.000
about what they wished our products integrated with.

08:50.000 --> 08:53.000
So I took it upon myself to learn JavaScript, Node, React,

08:53.000 --> 08:56.000
as well as a bunch of other technologies.

08:56.000 --> 09:01.000
I had, over time, created various applications that helped our clients

09:01.000 --> 09:07.000
and I logged the process and I helped them manage their different applications.

09:07.000 --> 09:10.000
I created essentially value for our clients.

09:10.000 --> 09:11.000
I told my boss about it.

09:11.000 --> 09:15.000
And even though the code was essentially dog crap taped to the wall,

09:15.000 --> 09:17.000
it was at least a working solution.

09:17.000 --> 09:20.000
Fast forward a couple of years, I sparked many ideas

09:20.000 --> 09:22.000
and now my boss has pulled me off tech support.

09:22.000 --> 09:25.000
I still have a way to go, but it's a lot to learn

09:25.000 --> 09:28.000
and I get paid a lot more and, of course, I'm doing things that I love

09:28.000 --> 09:30.000
and I get to build stuff.

09:30.000 --> 09:31.000
I'm not sure if this really helps Matt,

09:31.000 --> 09:34.000
but maybe he could think of something that his clients would benefit from.

09:34.000 --> 09:36.000
Maybe building something in his spare time as a hobby

09:36.000 --> 09:40.000
could help him go down a path into transitioning to a developer.

09:40.000 --> 09:42.000
His current position as a consultant

09:42.000 --> 09:45.000
gives him the ability to figure out solutions to problems.

09:45.000 --> 09:48.000
It's a great asset as a developer.

09:48.000 --> 09:50.000
Love the show, Jimmy from New Zealand.

09:50.000 --> 09:54.000
There's a lot there, but people, I think Matt touched people last week.

09:54.000 --> 09:57.000
We had a coder connection on the show.

09:57.000 --> 09:58.000
That's wonderful.

09:58.000 --> 09:59.000
Beautiful.

09:59.000 --> 10:02.000
I mean, I'm literally in tears right now.

10:03.000 --> 10:06.000
But you know what would soak up those tears better

10:06.000 --> 10:09.000
than me just crying into my sad polo shirt?

10:09.000 --> 10:10.000
A robe.

10:10.000 --> 10:11.000
A robe.

10:11.000 --> 10:12.000
Yes.

10:12.000 --> 10:14.000
Hold on, let me see if I can say what I want to be able to say.

10:14.000 --> 10:15.000
I got to double check.

10:15.000 --> 10:17.000
I'm opening up the thing right now.

10:17.000 --> 10:19.000
We're checking the logistics right now, people.

10:19.000 --> 10:20.000
Let's see.

10:20.000 --> 10:21.000
And if I have a new, I don't.

10:21.000 --> 10:24.000
I don't have a new email saying we've heard back.

10:24.000 --> 10:28.000
I was hoping, because you know, people will hear this like Wednesday, Thursday.

10:28.000 --> 10:31.000
And so I definitely will have an update by then.

10:31.000 --> 10:34.000
But as we record Monday evening,

10:34.000 --> 10:36.000
we had three more people that were international.

10:36.000 --> 10:40.000
So it turns out one of the issues is like the thread that we used

10:40.000 --> 10:42.000
is not legal in some of these countries.

10:42.000 --> 10:44.000
It's illegal thread.

10:44.000 --> 10:46.000
You and your fancy thread.

10:46.000 --> 10:48.000
I mean, can you believe this?

10:48.000 --> 10:52.000
So first, the first issue that hung it up was that custom required phone numbers.

10:52.000 --> 10:57.000
And I didn't put on the order page a space that like required a phone number.

10:57.000 --> 10:59.000
So we had to contact people and get their phone numbers.

10:59.000 --> 11:02.000
But of course, a lot of people didn't come back.

11:02.000 --> 11:05.000
So then like a handful of them ended up with my personal phone number on them

11:05.000 --> 11:07.000
for several logistical reasons.

11:07.000 --> 11:10.000
And then some of them had to get canceled because of customs or legal reasons.

11:10.000 --> 11:12.000
But that's all sorted now.

11:12.000 --> 11:13.000
It's all done.

11:13.000 --> 11:19.000
And it takes them just like a business week to actually get the embroidery done and whatnot.

11:19.000 --> 11:21.000
They ship from the U.S.

11:21.000 --> 11:26.000
That I've learned was going to always cause me pain.

11:26.000 --> 11:32.000
If I was working with somebody who maybe had shipping facilities in multiple parts of the world,

11:32.000 --> 11:34.000
maybe I wouldn't have had some of these problems.

11:34.000 --> 11:39.000
But the tradeoff is the type of selection of material that they have

11:39.000 --> 11:42.000
and the variety and the quality.

11:42.000 --> 11:47.000
And that is a notch above what I could get for the people that have worldwide distributions.

11:47.000 --> 11:49.000
So these are the tradeoffs.

11:49.000 --> 11:52.000
Man, I wanted to have this like totally wrapped up by now

11:52.000 --> 11:56.000
because I wanted all lessons learned and figured out for LUP 400.

11:56.000 --> 12:00.000
So we could do something for LUP 400, which is just like two weeks away.

12:00.000 --> 12:03.000
And I'm still not in a position to be able to do that.

12:03.000 --> 12:05.000
And when you think about the kind of lead time you need for designers

12:05.000 --> 12:09.000
and then to work with the company to get mockups and let alone

12:09.000 --> 12:13.000
if you even want to get like a test piece to like make sure it's valid before you put it up for sale,

12:13.000 --> 12:17.000
like two weeks is just really just probably not possible.

12:17.000 --> 12:19.000
So something's going to have to slide.

12:19.000 --> 12:23.000
It's just swag turns out way harder.

12:23.000 --> 12:30.000
And I expect it is possible at this point that I will be paying into this to get it to ship internationally

12:30.000 --> 12:33.000
because of the cost to ship this thing to some people.

12:33.000 --> 12:37.000
But I just didn't know because it was apparently for whatever reason

12:37.000 --> 12:40.000
impossible to give me an accurate quote ahead of time.

12:40.000 --> 12:42.000
And I don't know the logistics on this.

12:42.000 --> 12:44.000
I'd love to figure that part out.

12:44.000 --> 12:48.000
But they needed the address of each individual place they were going to drop ship to

12:48.000 --> 12:50.000
before they could give me a quote.

12:50.000 --> 12:54.000
And they couldn't just give me like some like estimate based on experience.

12:54.000 --> 13:00.000
So I'll tell you what.

13:00.000 --> 13:03.000
I mean, part of me would love to get this figured out and then just get a process,

13:03.000 --> 13:06.000
a business process that just makes this smooth.

13:06.000 --> 13:11.000
And maybe just there's a few companies that we have to use a different partner to ship to or something.

13:11.000 --> 13:14.000
But then part of me just wants to never touch this again.

13:14.000 --> 13:16.000
Or as they say on filter, F the EU.

13:16.000 --> 13:17.000
That's right.

13:17.000 --> 13:19.000
Oh, she has been known.

13:19.000 --> 13:24.000
So anonymous penguin coder writes in and he's looking for our advice as two dads.

13:24.000 --> 13:28.000
He's hoping to shed some light on a situation that he finds himself in.

13:28.000 --> 13:31.000
He wants us to be the light at that end of the tunnel.

13:31.000 --> 13:33.000
He says, I am a huge Linux fan.

13:33.000 --> 13:36.000
I have a family of three kids six and under.

13:36.000 --> 13:38.000
Wow, man.

13:38.000 --> 13:39.000
Wow.

13:39.000 --> 13:43.000
He says, over the last show, you talked about the sirens call of the Apple platform.

13:43.000 --> 13:47.000
I've recently been hearing that call in regards of mobile devices.

13:47.000 --> 13:48.000
I have a pine tab.

13:48.000 --> 13:53.000
And while the future potential is there, it just isn't there today.

13:53.000 --> 13:55.000
It barely does simple web pages correctly.

13:55.000 --> 13:58.000
I know there's potential, but I want something that just works today.

13:58.000 --> 14:00.000
And I have very little time.

14:00.000 --> 14:04.000
I have a couple other computers that I need because my machines are getting pretty old.

14:04.000 --> 14:07.000
I have nothing newer than 2003.

14:07.000 --> 14:11.000
I do like the Android pixel ecosystem, but Android tablets just don't seem appealing.

14:11.000 --> 14:15.000
So my questions are, what are your guys' thoughts on the iPad Pro?

14:15.000 --> 14:17.000
Should I look into buying one?

14:17.000 --> 14:21.000
Is Michael going to invest in one if they update one soon?

14:21.000 --> 14:23.000
Which there's rumors they will be.

14:23.000 --> 14:25.000
And what are the gotchas for a Linux user or a sys admin?

14:25.000 --> 14:28.000
Thank you, anonymous penguin coder.

14:28.000 --> 14:29.000
We both have the iPad Pro.

14:29.000 --> 14:32.000
I think around the same one, too.

14:32.000 --> 14:33.000
2018?

14:33.000 --> 14:35.000
Yeah, I think it's like an 18, yeah.

14:35.000 --> 14:37.000
Yeah, iPad Pro 2018 I think is what we both have.

14:37.000 --> 14:38.000
I have the 11-inch.

14:38.000 --> 14:40.000
Yeah, I have the small one, yeah.

14:40.000 --> 14:42.000
Would you consider upgrading?

14:42.000 --> 14:43.000
No.

14:43.000 --> 14:44.000
No need to?

14:44.000 --> 14:48.000
Unless there was a development reason where I wanted to build something for it.

14:48.000 --> 14:54.000
My iPad is a glorified iTunes or Apple TV, whatever.

14:54.000 --> 14:55.000
I just watch movies.

14:55.000 --> 14:56.000
Oh, yeah, OK.

14:56.000 --> 14:57.000
Content machine.

14:57.000 --> 14:58.000
Yeah, it's a content machine.

14:58.000 --> 15:00.000
I don't need anything else.

15:00.000 --> 15:03.000
Honestly, it's an extreme overkill for what I have.

15:03.000 --> 15:04.000
I have a different feeling.

15:04.000 --> 15:07.000
I also would not upgrade because I feel like mine's a five-year machine.

15:07.000 --> 15:12.000
But I use mine quite a bit for the productivity apps that I don't think are great on Linux.

15:12.000 --> 15:14.000
Do you have a MacBook Air for that?

15:14.000 --> 15:17.000
Yeah, this is my way of avoiding the MacBook Air.

15:17.000 --> 15:18.000
Sure, yeah.

15:18.000 --> 15:20.000
Because I don't love email on Linux or calendars.

15:20.000 --> 15:22.000
I mean, who does?

15:22.000 --> 15:24.000
We went in the wrong direction here.

15:24.000 --> 15:32.000
So, yes, to correct it, the gotchas, I'd say, is the only real kind of integration you're going to get with the Linux desktop is via cloud services.

15:32.000 --> 15:37.000
Some you could roll yourself if you have the time to set something up like Nextcloud or something like that.

15:37.000 --> 15:44.000
But for the most part, it's just going to be ones that are standard cloud services that you know of and either love or hate already.

15:44.000 --> 15:47.000
So depending on your point of view, that's a downside to that.

15:47.000 --> 15:52.000
I'm kind of curious, Wes, what your thoughts are because you don't have an iPad or an iPhone.

15:52.000 --> 15:57.000
You're not necessarily against owning one, but it doesn't seem like they've just ever crossed the threshold of interest.

15:57.000 --> 15:58.000
And what would that take?

15:58.000 --> 16:01.000
Actually, my very first smartphone was an iPhone.

16:01.000 --> 16:03.000
So I started out that way.

16:03.000 --> 16:04.000
Like how long?

16:04.000 --> 16:05.000
Which one was it?

16:05.000 --> 16:06.000
I don't know.

16:06.000 --> 16:09.000
This was probably 2011, 2010.

16:09.000 --> 16:10.000
I thought 4, I think.

16:10.000 --> 16:11.000
Yeah, okay.

16:11.000 --> 16:12.000
Yeah, 4G maybe.

16:12.000 --> 16:13.000
Yeah.

16:13.000 --> 16:14.000
So I enjoyed that.

16:14.000 --> 16:16.000
Of course, I was also doing all kinds of stuff.

16:16.000 --> 16:17.000
Had Cydia on there.

16:17.000 --> 16:19.000
You know, it was jailbroken a lot of the time.

16:19.000 --> 16:21.000
So those were kind of like the old playful days.

16:21.000 --> 16:23.000
And I've administered a lot of Macs.

16:23.000 --> 16:25.000
So I'm definitely, you know, interested.

16:25.000 --> 16:28.000
I can appreciate the ecosystem.

16:28.000 --> 16:30.000
And honestly, these days, I think about it.

16:30.000 --> 16:32.000
I mean, you know, I see you a lot.

16:32.000 --> 16:35.000
You're somewhat invested now these days.

16:35.000 --> 16:38.000
And I don't really do anything with my phone that's not just a phone use.

16:38.000 --> 16:43.000
I haven't really had root on any of my Android devices for, I don't know, a couple years now.

16:43.000 --> 16:48.000
It's mostly that because I'm not already invested, I just see that to get a lot of the benefits,

16:48.000 --> 16:51.000
it seems like I'd have to have a couple devices.

16:51.000 --> 16:53.000
And I don't really need a tablet.

16:53.000 --> 16:55.000
Like I just, it doesn't really fit in my lifestyle right now.

16:55.000 --> 16:58.000
I don't spend that much time on the couch where I'd really need a tablet.

16:58.000 --> 16:59.000
And I just have it.

16:59.000 --> 17:00.000
I live by myself.

17:00.000 --> 17:02.000
I've got the desk set up that I want.

17:02.000 --> 17:03.000
It's easy enough, you know.

17:03.000 --> 17:06.000
And I don't have all the AirPlay gadgets.

17:06.000 --> 17:07.000
I really like AirPlay.

17:07.000 --> 17:11.000
It seems so much better than the equivalent Chromecast setup.

17:11.000 --> 17:13.000
But Chromecast is a fairly open ecosystem.

17:13.000 --> 17:16.000
I can just ask it to play a URL for me very easily.

17:16.000 --> 17:19.000
So that's kind of why I'm stuck where I'm at.

17:19.000 --> 17:21.000
That's totally fair.

17:21.000 --> 17:23.000
I also agree that it does seem to multiply.

17:23.000 --> 17:27.000
You know, if he was asking for his kids, I'd say don't get the iPad Pro.

17:27.000 --> 17:32.000
That's overkill for how fast kids would burn through it, you know, if you wanted a family.

17:32.000 --> 17:33.000
But his kids are young.

17:33.000 --> 17:37.000
For my kids, you know, for me, if I can get a refurbished iPad, that's perfect.

17:37.000 --> 17:43.000
If not, I try to get one that's the most reasonably priced for them if it's like out of just the wrong time buying season.

17:43.000 --> 17:51.000
I think it's actually for me been a nice supplement because it takes the pressure off my laptop to be all things.

17:51.000 --> 17:54.000
And the iPad Pro has a very consistent performance.

17:54.000 --> 17:55.000
And then, Wes, you know this is true.

17:55.000 --> 17:59.000
The other thing that I use the hell out of is I got an iPad with LTE connectivity.

17:59.000 --> 18:00.000
I think Mike did, too.

18:00.000 --> 18:01.000
And I love that.

18:01.000 --> 18:04.000
It is so great to always have data.

18:04.000 --> 18:06.000
It just doesn't matter where I go.

18:06.000 --> 18:08.000
If I'm on Wi-Fi, I don't have to worry about Wi-Fi.

18:08.000 --> 18:10.000
I always have a data connection if I have signal.

18:10.000 --> 18:14.000
And that really kind of goes along hand in hand with that productivity aspect of the machine.

18:14.000 --> 18:18.000
So I do kind of recommend it if that sounds like your use case.

18:18.000 --> 18:23.000
The iPad Pro could be overkill, but in my opinion, performance is king.

18:23.000 --> 18:26.000
I will say I got my dad an iPad.

18:26.000 --> 18:30.000
And while he's not a child, that was about his level of experience using computers.

18:30.000 --> 18:34.000
He's an outdoors kind of man, you know, not really interested in any of that.

18:34.000 --> 18:37.000
Yeah, for non-technical folks, the iPad is actually a great computer.

18:37.000 --> 18:38.000
Yeah, he's done a lot.

18:38.000 --> 18:42.000
And it's inviting enough for him that I haven't really had to hold his hand the whole time.

18:42.000 --> 18:44.000
He's been able to explore confidently.

18:44.000 --> 18:45.000
He's not going to break stuff.

18:45.000 --> 18:50.000
So that lets him sort of push the boundaries a little bit and actually teach himself on his own, which is great.

18:52.000 --> 18:54.000
Linode.com slash coder.

18:54.000 --> 18:57.000
Go there to get a $100 60-day credit towards your new account.

18:57.000 --> 18:59.000
And of course, you support this here show.

18:59.000 --> 19:04.000
Linode is the largest independent cloud for developers and our cloud hosting provider.

19:04.000 --> 19:06.000
Like we were just talking, that new bot work we did.

19:06.000 --> 19:08.000
That's on Linode.

19:08.000 --> 19:10.000
Everything we've done for JB 3.0, we host there.

19:10.000 --> 19:18.000
They have native SSD storage, 40 gigabit network connections, really easy to use cloud manager dashboard and the best connections.

19:18.000 --> 19:20.000
I mean, they're super fast between their data centers.

19:20.000 --> 19:25.000
That's something else that I've learned to really appreciate as I've built out more Linodes.

19:25.000 --> 19:30.000
Something else that we learn to take advantage of in different ways that we never really considered,

19:30.000 --> 19:36.000
but saves us time and money is Linode's S3 compatible object storage.

19:36.000 --> 19:42.000
Now, you probably know object storage is an easy way for you to store and access data without the need for running an entire server in front of it.

19:42.000 --> 19:50.000
It's perfect for data that doesn't change that often, like images or the multimedia files that we're often working with, which are FLAC files.

19:50.000 --> 19:52.000
It's awesome for backups.

19:52.000 --> 19:57.000
It's great for like getting a giant archive up into the cloud that you want to make accessible or maybe just private.

19:57.000 --> 20:01.000
You can do that obviously as well. By default, it's private.

20:01.000 --> 20:06.000
And it just adds more storage space as you go for, as you use it, as you go forward.

20:06.000 --> 20:11.000
So you don't have to sit there and try to allocate like I'll do 20 gigs at a time and then fill that up and then go allocate another 20 gigs.

20:11.000 --> 20:13.000
And the pricing is great.

20:13.000 --> 20:17.000
And one of the best cases for object storage is actually just hosting a static website.

20:17.000 --> 20:23.000
You can get a crazy fast, highly available website on Linode's object storage with just a little HTML and CSS.

20:23.000 --> 20:25.000
It's really cool.

20:25.000 --> 20:37.000
So there's so many great ways to use Linode besides the way we use it, which is hosting all of our services for our backend stuff, for the tools that we use and don't really ever expose to the public and for our public facing stuff.

20:37.000 --> 20:40.000
That's that's what I really like about the different kinds of systems.

20:40.000 --> 20:44.000
They have rigs that are like five dollars a month and there's a lot of use cases for that.

20:44.000 --> 20:53.000
And then they have rigs that have like dedicated AMD epic CPUs and they beat everyone else in the cloud in speed comparisons.

20:53.000 --> 21:02.000
And that's not just me saying that Cloud Spectator did a did a research study and found that AMD's epic dedicated CPUs are killer fast.

21:02.000 --> 21:06.000
You know, they're just really dedicated to making sure that if you want to run something on Linux, it'll run great on Linode.

21:06.000 --> 21:10.000
And then they just have different choices, super easy to parse for you to pick from.

21:10.000 --> 21:15.000
And then they wrap that all up with fantastic customer service, real human beings.

21:15.000 --> 21:22.000
You know, it doesn't matter if you've got 15 Linodes or 1000 Linodes or one, you're still going to get that same great support.

21:22.000 --> 21:27.000
And that matters. That matters. They started in 2003 as one of the first companies in cloud computing.

21:27.000 --> 21:33.000
And that matters, too. They've stuck around, they've refined the product and they've remained independent.

21:33.000 --> 21:37.000
So go try it out. See what I've been talking about. Linode.com slash coder.

21:39.000 --> 21:47.000
So there's some hoopla today that was really our excuse to bring Wes onto the show again because, you know, he works all day.

21:47.000 --> 21:53.000
So I feel bad at the end of the day asking him to just basically stay at his desk and get on another call.

21:53.000 --> 21:58.000
But this one kind of felt like we needed your help because Mike and I had not got a chance to read it yet.

21:58.000 --> 22:04.000
And you had a chance to follow it since it started breaking. So the Ruby community is off the rails this week.

22:04.000 --> 22:09.000
What's going on, Wes? Off the rails because rails was broken.

22:09.000 --> 22:20.000
It all started last Wednesday when the maintainer of a software library called Shared MIME Info informed the maintainer of a Ruby library called MIME Magic.

22:20.000 --> 22:27.000
And he was shipping MIME Magic under an incompatible software license. Yes, this story is all about licenses.

22:27.000 --> 22:31.000
Is it really coming down to it's a GPL versus MIT thing?

22:31.000 --> 22:37.000
Yes. So this is a free desktop, like basically a MIME database of, you know, all these all these various MIME types.

22:37.000 --> 22:41.000
It's maintained by the free desktop and therefore it's licensed as GPL.

22:41.000 --> 22:47.000
This Ruby library was automatically taking that, parsing it and shipping it as code in their library.

22:47.000 --> 22:54.000
So all you had to do was download this gem, install it. You had access to that to that library and that database functionality in a nice Ruby API.

22:54.000 --> 23:00.000
You go figure out what MIME types files are, et cetera. But that library was licensed as MIT.

23:00.000 --> 23:04.000
And as you know, those two don't exactly play nicely in that way.

23:04.000 --> 23:07.000
Yeah, there's a viral nature to the GPL, which must be the core issue here.

23:07.000 --> 23:14.000
Right. So to their credit, the maintainer of MIME Magic promptly moved the latest version over to GPL,

23:14.000 --> 23:21.000
but then withdrew the prior versions from distribution. And that's because really they were licensed wrongly.

23:21.000 --> 23:30.000
Right. I mean, you're pulling down what says it's an MIT project, but it's using GPL code and therefore it actually is a derived work and should be GPL.

23:30.000 --> 23:38.000
So what do you do? Do you leave that up there as a potential liability and risk for people who download an incorrectly labeled and licensed package?

23:38.000 --> 23:47.000
Or do you do what they did, which was pull all those wrong packages, which meant that anyone using CI systems to automatically build and deploy from those old versions.

23:47.000 --> 23:51.000
So you actually pinned your versions. You weren't just using the latest like Rails.

23:51.000 --> 23:58.000
Those all broke, including like 172 other packages. But of course, Rails is the one that caught everyone's attention.

23:58.000 --> 24:03.000
Oh, I just want to say this is why I hate the GPL. OK.

24:03.000 --> 24:07.000
I mean, I feel like we have kind of talked about this before, like this is a problem.

24:07.000 --> 24:14.000
For years, like the GPL does not benefit individual developers or individual users.

24:14.000 --> 24:18.000
It benefits big companies who don't give a crap because you could never hit their scale.

24:18.000 --> 24:23.000
So they don't care if their stuff is forced to be open source because it's like the Linux kernel.

24:23.000 --> 24:30.000
You can't touch it through a small company, BSD, MIT, Apache to everything else.

24:30.000 --> 24:33.000
Right. Like it's a waste of time.

24:33.000 --> 24:39.000
You're just going to get screwed over. The GPL was meant to be subversive and help the little guy.

24:39.000 --> 24:43.000
It actually just helps the big corporations. It's a waste of time.

24:43.000 --> 24:47.000
Free software sucks. Open source for life. I'm done.

24:47.000 --> 24:54.000
This does kind of seem like, though, it's it is a case in point of what you kind of have been worrying about forever.

24:54.000 --> 25:00.000
Well, no, because who got screwed by this? Small companies and small software consultancies like me.

25:00.000 --> 25:04.000
It's a knock on effect. It wasn't the big guys. Microsoft doesn't give a shit.

25:04.000 --> 25:13.000
Like they're fine. Yeah. Like the GPL is poison unless you're Microsoft Red Hat, which is IBM or someone that size.

25:13.000 --> 25:20.000
I'm sorry, but it needs to go. So are you saying that they're fine just because they have lawyers to deal with it or for other reasons?

25:20.000 --> 25:25.000
I think they're fine because they have the money. They don't care that spending the resources contributing back hurts them.

25:25.000 --> 25:28.000
Right. And they have lawyers. Not that they would violate it.

25:28.000 --> 25:35.000
But when you only have, let's say, 20 or 30 developers, the GPL is a big drain on you.

25:35.000 --> 25:42.000
It's just too much. I think some would argue that that's making you pay back for the resources you're benefiting from.

25:42.000 --> 25:48.000
OK, but like Mac, BSD, right? Like, I don't know. I don't think the proof is there.

25:48.000 --> 25:51.000
But that's an argument we can have another day.

25:51.000 --> 25:58.000
I think where I fall down on is it seems like GPL is appropriate for things like the kernel or the desktop environment.

25:58.000 --> 26:05.000
But when it comes to something that ends up a gem, that's a big deal. That's a bigger decision.

26:05.000 --> 26:07.000
That's where I start to agree with you.

26:07.000 --> 26:15.000
Well, when it's a library, right? The kernel is a bad example, fair enough. When it's a library and it becomes poison to your entire application,

26:15.000 --> 26:21.000
that seems just like fundamentally benefits big players and hurts small players to me.

26:21.000 --> 26:26.000
Because how many Rails shops were crapping their pants in the last week because they couldn't do their CI builds?

26:26.000 --> 26:30.000
Yeah. The other story here, though, I think, I mean, the license, you're right, that is part of it.

26:30.000 --> 26:36.000
Although you could argue, I mean, that's up to the people, right? The free desktop.org, if they want to maintain it, they want help maintaining it.

26:36.000 --> 26:41.000
They're like, hey, we make this whole database of file types. We want people to update that when they add files.

26:41.000 --> 26:42.000
We want to make sure it's accurate.

26:42.000 --> 26:51.000
But the other side of the story is basically, one, the nature of how we all rely on online, up-to-date, live binary artifacts, you know,

26:51.000 --> 26:56.000
like these gems or other things else out there. We rely on those always working forever, immutably.

26:56.000 --> 27:03.000
And this library was basically unmaintained, and it was even archived for a little bit after this update because the maintainer was like,

27:03.000 --> 27:07.000
well, look, this is just a library that pulls from stuff someone else maintains.

27:07.000 --> 27:10.000
I'm not really touching this or worried about it anymore.

27:10.000 --> 27:14.000
So it's another example of, like, we always have a thousand million dependencies deep.

27:14.000 --> 27:18.000
Not everyone's paying attention to a lot of them. Will Rails shift eventually?

27:18.000 --> 27:21.000
Yeah, maybe. And there has been some updates to the story, which we can get to.

27:21.000 --> 27:26.000
But there's a lot of modern software development microcosms to be found here.

27:26.000 --> 27:28.000
No, that's a razor-sharp point there, Wes.

27:28.000 --> 27:36.000
And in fact, internally, we've been having this conversation at TMB about some of the Python and Ruby applications we've developed.

27:36.000 --> 27:40.000
And Ruby is just a proxy for Rails for us, and Python is usually Flask.

27:40.000 --> 27:48.000
The number of dependencies that they rely on over time, particularly on the Rails ones because we've been doing Rails a lot longer,

27:48.000 --> 27:53.000
has become problematic, let's say, where the dependencies may shift.

27:53.000 --> 27:58.000
The Ruby 3.0 shift was problematic for API compatibility reasons.

27:58.000 --> 28:03.000
But this kind of thing, like, I somehow ducked this by the grace of God.

28:03.000 --> 28:06.000
But, I mean, I would have sent some mean tweets, right?

28:06.000 --> 28:09.000
Like, if this had happened to me, you know me.

28:09.000 --> 28:14.000
I do worry, and I know you're going to jump down my throat, Wes,

28:14.000 --> 28:22.000
that maybe we're just relying on other people's software too much, too many gems, too many PIP packages, too many jars, too many NuGet packages.

28:22.000 --> 28:23.000
Is that sane?

28:23.000 --> 28:31.000
I think we see often that there are risks to that, and it makes sense to try to minimize the dependencies you have.

28:31.000 --> 28:32.000
That's not always easy, right?

28:32.000 --> 28:38.000
Like, especially for a giant framework like Rails, there's a whole bunch of dependencies, optional dependencies, that gets complicated.

28:38.000 --> 28:44.000
But it makes sense to me to at least try to limit things, look at your dependencies, go visit their GitHub, go look at the community.

28:44.000 --> 28:45.000
Are they getting updates?

28:45.000 --> 28:46.000
Now, that doesn't always matter.

28:46.000 --> 28:51.000
Sometimes things are done, or they, you know, don't need updates all the time because it's a standalone package.

28:51.000 --> 28:58.000
But by and large, for things on the internet these days, they at least got to keep up with very small changes, tweaks, updates to interfaces, etc.

28:58.000 --> 29:00.000
So go assess what those are.

29:00.000 --> 29:03.000
Go see how deep their dependency chains are.

29:03.000 --> 29:04.000
All of this is extra work.

29:04.000 --> 29:08.000
But if you want to prevent this from happening to you, it's at least worth thinking about.

29:08.000 --> 29:09.000
Well, right.

29:09.000 --> 29:18.000
And if you want a really stable platform to develop on where the dependencies haven't shifted in about a decade, I can definitely recommend Objective-C.

29:18.000 --> 29:19.000
Oh, my God.

29:19.000 --> 29:20.000
Sorry, Wes.

29:20.000 --> 29:29.000
Now, not all of the projects are going to be affected immediately because it's really only going to be a problem when they try to build an update and, you know, fetch the latest version.

29:29.000 --> 29:32.000
So it's kind of like a time bomb for some of these projects.

29:32.000 --> 29:35.000
So do they have a solution?

29:35.000 --> 29:36.000
I mean, are they going to fork it?

29:36.000 --> 29:38.000
Like, what happens next?

29:38.000 --> 29:39.000
Yeah. Okay.

29:39.000 --> 29:46.000
So basically the idea was there's now a new version, a new new version, which was restored to the MIT license.

29:46.000 --> 29:48.000
And you just have to provide your own database.

29:48.000 --> 29:54.000
So that was basically the idea they came up with was instead of actually shipping the database mungedified into Ruby code,

29:54.000 --> 29:58.000
you just have to load it at module time when you're running your program.

29:58.000 --> 30:00.000
That way it's not like linked together GPL wise.

30:00.000 --> 30:05.000
You just aren't going to pull in this file from the disk and leverage that in your own application, not in this library that's distributed.

30:05.000 --> 30:08.000
No, it wasn't the library itself that was the problem.

30:08.000 --> 30:13.000
It was the database of the different whatever data types or whatever it was.

30:13.000 --> 30:14.000
MIME type data mappings.

30:14.000 --> 30:15.000
The MIME types.

30:15.000 --> 30:16.000
Yeah.

30:16.000 --> 30:17.000
Right. Yeah.

30:17.000 --> 30:24.000
So it was that they had taken the MIME type database and then basically used at build time,

30:24.000 --> 30:29.000
loaded that in and then converted that into just like static Ruby code that got shipped in the module.

30:29.000 --> 30:31.000
But they didn't do that with the appropriate license.

30:31.000 --> 30:36.000
So now at runtime, when you load your thing, it's actually going to go load it from disk, pull that all in.

30:36.000 --> 30:40.000
So now it's your application doing it and not the library so they can keep the license MIT.

30:40.000 --> 30:45.000
Basically, they'll have the barn doors fixed as the cows are coming home.

30:45.000 --> 30:48.000
It's an open question now of, is this really the way we want to be doing that?

30:48.000 --> 30:50.000
And is this all kind of a hack?

30:50.000 --> 30:51.000
Should we have a better library?

30:51.000 --> 30:52.000
What's Rails going to do?

30:52.000 --> 30:56.000
Do we need something that has more active maintainership?

30:56.000 --> 30:58.000
That part is still an open question, I think.

30:58.000 --> 30:59.000
That doesn't sound good.

30:59.000 --> 31:02.000
I feel like this needs to be built into Rails, but maybe that's a different conversation.

31:02.000 --> 31:04.000
Yeah, it doesn't seem ideal, huh?

31:04.000 --> 31:06.000
What a crazy series of events.

31:06.000 --> 31:09.000
The Register did, I think, one of the best write ups I've seen on this.

31:09.000 --> 31:11.000
We'll have that linked in the show notes.

31:11.000 --> 31:13.000
Thanks for helping us break that down, Wes.

31:13.000 --> 31:14.000
You're the best, Wes.

31:14.000 --> 31:19.000
I just hope I get to avoid Bundler, Gems, and all of it until the next time J-Pop breaks.

31:20.000 --> 31:23.000
Datadog.com slash Coder Radio.

31:23.000 --> 31:28.000
Go to datadog.com slash Coder Radio and sign up for a 14-day free trial.

31:28.000 --> 31:29.000
And you know what?

31:29.000 --> 31:33.000
If you do that, you'll also, after you create a dashboard, can get a Datadog t-shirt.

31:33.000 --> 31:35.000
That's right, you get merch.

31:35.000 --> 31:41.000
But Datadog is a series of tools to help you analyze code-level performance across your environment

31:41.000 --> 31:43.000
and troubleshoot issues faster.

31:43.000 --> 31:46.000
Datadog is a tool to do that and communicate.

31:46.000 --> 31:50.000
And they have something called the Continuous Profiler that automatically collects information.

31:50.000 --> 31:56.000
It profiles your production servers all the time, so you can analyze your data quickly

31:56.000 --> 31:59.000
from any particular point in time with minimal overhead.

31:59.000 --> 32:04.000
You get a unified picture of your environment, correlating code performance with metrics

32:04.000 --> 32:09.000
from your servers and your applications, and you can monitor real-time information

32:09.000 --> 32:12.000
and put it up on these beautiful dashboards.

32:12.000 --> 32:13.000
It's gorgeous.

32:13.000 --> 32:17.000
These are the kind of dashboards you'd want to just have screens around your office

32:17.000 --> 32:18.000
with these dashboards up.

32:18.000 --> 32:22.000
Go to datadog.com slash Coder Radio to see what I'm talking about.

32:22.000 --> 32:25.000
They tightly integrate with a bunch of different applications.

32:25.000 --> 32:27.000
They have this tracing and they have the log management.

32:27.000 --> 32:32.000
Of course, that Continuous Profiler, it all comes together in Datadog.

32:32.000 --> 32:37.000
One platform enables you to pinpoint the root cause of issues faster than ever.

32:37.000 --> 32:39.000
Save time with Datadog.

32:39.000 --> 32:41.000
Datadog.com slash Coder Radio.

32:41.000 --> 32:46.000
Go there and get a 14-day trial, and when you create one dashboard,

32:46.000 --> 32:48.000
you'll get a free Datadog t-shirt.

32:48.000 --> 32:49.000
That's pretty great.

32:49.000 --> 32:52.000
Datadog.com slash Coder Radio.

32:52.000 --> 32:55.000
So did you see this?

32:55.000 --> 32:57.000
Did you see this?

32:57.000 --> 33:03.000
The Dino Company from the original developers of Node.js.

33:03.000 --> 33:07.000
It is an attempt to breathe new life into the ecosystem.

33:07.000 --> 33:12.000
They say to provide a modern, productive programming system that adheres to browser APIs.

33:12.000 --> 33:17.000
Dino is not a monolithic system, but rather a set of technologies we believe

33:17.000 --> 33:21.000
can be repurposed into a variety of needs.

33:21.000 --> 33:24.000
Dino is here.

33:24.000 --> 33:25.000
They've announced it.

33:25.000 --> 33:26.000
They have a company now behind it.

33:26.000 --> 33:33.000
I think it's Ryan Dahl and Bert Felder, who are the two co-creators of Node.js.

33:33.000 --> 33:39.000
And they also have $4.9 million of seed capital to get this thing off the ground.

33:39.000 --> 33:41.000
I have to respect them on two fronts.

33:41.000 --> 33:45.000
One, they got paid, so dollar-dollar bill, y'all.

33:45.000 --> 33:50.000
But also, they were wrong to put JavaScript on the server the first time.

33:50.000 --> 33:54.000
But instead of backing down, they said, to hell with this.

33:54.000 --> 33:55.000
We're doing it again.

33:55.000 --> 33:57.000
F you guys.

33:57.000 --> 34:00.000
Now TypeScript is first-class citizen, but it's really JavaScript.

34:00.000 --> 34:06.000
They said, do you want your server-side software to move as fast and crazy as your browser-side does?

34:06.000 --> 34:07.000
We're going to do it.

34:07.000 --> 34:09.000
Do you like instability, sir?

34:09.000 --> 34:12.000
Well, we've got something for you.

34:12.000 --> 34:16.000
I mean, that really is their complaint, is that Node.js got stagnant

34:16.000 --> 34:19.000
and hasn't really innovated much and isn't moving fast enough.

34:19.000 --> 34:23.000
Stagnant had to stabilize because a bunch of consultants like me,

34:23.000 --> 34:29.000
but not me because I don't sell Node because I was not smoking that crack pipe,

34:29.000 --> 34:31.000
sold it to enterprises.

34:31.000 --> 34:32.000
Again, not me.

34:32.000 --> 34:38.000
I was selling them Rails, which, okay, not the best week for Rails.

34:38.000 --> 34:41.000
I've changed my opinion on lots of things over the years, Chris.

34:41.000 --> 34:43.000
On this, I have been consistent.

34:43.000 --> 34:47.000
JavaScript does not belong on the server, period.

34:47.000 --> 34:50.000
They also have this deploy system.

34:50.000 --> 34:53.000
They say it's a globally distributed JavaScript VM,

34:53.000 --> 34:55.000
so you don't have to run it on your server.

34:55.000 --> 34:57.000
You could run it on their server.

34:57.000 --> 34:58.000
I see.

34:58.000 --> 35:01.000
Taking dog shit and putting it on my neighbor's lawn is better.

35:01.000 --> 35:02.000
Got it.

35:02.000 --> 35:03.000
Obviously.

35:03.000 --> 35:04.000
Then it's not on your lawn, man.

35:04.000 --> 35:05.000
Everybody knows that.

35:05.000 --> 35:07.000
I mean, no disrespect to Mr. Dahl and Mr. Belder.

35:07.000 --> 35:09.000
I mean, it's great engineering,

35:09.000 --> 35:12.000
but there is absolutely no reason for this to exist.

35:12.000 --> 35:15.000
There are many better server-side languages,

35:15.000 --> 35:19.000
and the idea that you need to unify your language between server and client,

35:19.000 --> 35:22.000
well, then nobody can make fun of me if I do a cappuccino

35:22.000 --> 35:24.000
to do Objective-C on the server,

35:24.000 --> 35:27.000
which you guys have mercilessly done for a decade.

35:27.000 --> 35:32.000
So this is a bad idea, just like Node is a bad idea.

35:32.000 --> 35:34.000
Why don't you all learn Python?

35:34.000 --> 35:38.000
Nicely done.

35:38.000 --> 35:40.000
Now, I don't disagree, but I'm curious.

35:40.000 --> 35:42.000
Wes is coming in for the fight.

35:42.000 --> 35:45.000
Modern Python with async and UV loop,

35:45.000 --> 35:48.000
I mean, is it that much different than, say, TypeScript,

35:48.000 --> 35:50.000
which has been improved a lot?

35:50.000 --> 35:51.000
No.

35:51.000 --> 35:53.000
Python is, in fact, getting progressively worse.

35:53.000 --> 35:54.000
I agree with you.

35:54.000 --> 35:59.000
I sort of think that better server-side languages are C Sharp and Java.

35:59.000 --> 36:01.000
It just seems like that argument is pushing a lot of work

36:01.000 --> 36:03.000
on what might be a small development team

36:03.000 --> 36:05.000
that, say, you were talking about earlier.

36:05.000 --> 36:06.000
They don't have a lot of time.

36:06.000 --> 36:08.000
They don't really have expertise in multiple languages.

36:08.000 --> 36:11.000
They have to ship some front-end products anyway.

36:11.000 --> 36:13.000
I would push back hard on that, because front-end developers,

36:13.000 --> 36:16.000
the real talent is not like JavaScript coding.

36:16.000 --> 36:19.000
It's going to be CSS design, HTML,

36:19.000 --> 36:22.000
knowing how to integrate templates quickly, stuff like that.

36:22.000 --> 36:24.000
It's not going to be, you know,

36:24.000 --> 36:26.000
they're not going to know about threading on V8,

36:26.000 --> 36:29.000
because if they're front-end developers, they don't care, right,

36:29.000 --> 36:31.000
for the most part.

36:31.000 --> 36:35.000
I would almost challenge, I guess, that if you had a full JavaScript team,

36:35.000 --> 36:37.000
you would still have some developers

36:37.000 --> 36:39.000
who are better on the back-end on the server-side

36:39.000 --> 36:42.000
and some who actually know how to do CSS.

36:42.000 --> 36:44.000
And my CSS is weak, right?

36:44.000 --> 36:49.000
I am probably, in my company, the worst guy for CSS around.

36:49.000 --> 36:52.000
I think you could do it probably with a non-Java language,

36:52.000 --> 36:54.000
but to go from JavaScript to Java,

36:54.000 --> 36:56.000
there's just such an impedance mismatch

36:56.000 --> 37:00.000
when you could just otherwise ship JSON objects really easily,

37:00.000 --> 37:03.000
and there's a whole bunch of libraries that will set things up for you

37:03.000 --> 37:05.000
so you can just send data structures back and forth.

37:05.000 --> 37:07.000
You don't have to deal with all kinds of serialization

37:07.000 --> 37:10.000
going down the Java route or figuring out how to make serialization work

37:10.000 --> 37:12.000
on these weird custom classes that you're defining.

37:12.000 --> 37:13.000
None of that.

37:13.000 --> 37:17.000
Okay, so pick another non-statically typed language then, right?

37:17.000 --> 37:19.000
But then you have to pick.

37:19.000 --> 37:21.000
Wow, life is about hard choices.

37:21.000 --> 37:23.000
I'm not saying I endorse it.

37:23.000 --> 37:25.000
I'm just saying if you have to learn JavaScript anyway,

37:25.000 --> 37:27.000
much like why Electron apps exist, right?

37:27.000 --> 37:29.000
It's the same sort of reasoning.

37:29.000 --> 37:31.000
It's just easier.

37:31.000 --> 37:33.000
And then Denno adds more stuff like TypeScript as default.

37:33.000 --> 37:35.000
You get better APIs that are modernized.

37:35.000 --> 37:37.000
You get sandboxing with permission.

37:37.000 --> 37:40.000
You get a better self-contained binary deployment strategy.

37:40.000 --> 37:42.000
I just don't know, Wes. I just don't know.

37:42.000 --> 37:43.000
I don't know.

37:43.000 --> 37:45.000
I just don't know if JavaScript belongs on the server.

37:45.000 --> 37:47.000
I mean, maybe this is my old madness,

37:47.000 --> 37:49.000
and I'm just being like, no, don't put your peanut butter

37:49.000 --> 37:51.000
in my jelly or my chocolate.

37:51.000 --> 37:55.000
But I just – it's such a bad language.

37:55.000 --> 37:56.000
I'm sorry.

37:56.000 --> 37:58.000
Now that I can't disagree with.

37:58.000 --> 38:00.000
And you and I don't agree on languages at all.

38:00.000 --> 38:02.000
But I think that's where TypeScript as a first-class citizen

38:02.000 --> 38:04.000
is maybe some of their argument.

38:04.000 --> 38:08.000
Okay, but TypeScript – I mean, we should do a whole show on, like,

38:08.000 --> 38:10.000
is TypeScript different from JavaScript?

38:10.000 --> 38:14.000
Because isn't it – okay, I'm very conflicted on TypeScript.

38:14.000 --> 38:18.000
Is it the next simplified evolution of C-sharp slash Java,

38:18.000 --> 38:21.000
or is it JavaScript where it hides the pain from you?

38:21.000 --> 38:22.000
And I don't know the answer to that.

38:22.000 --> 38:23.000
That's a real question.

38:23.000 --> 38:25.000
Yeah, and I think part of that is, like,

38:25.000 --> 38:27.000
when you get to ship more modern JavaScript,

38:27.000 --> 38:29.000
at least some of the pains are better.

38:29.000 --> 38:32.000
It's still a gross, ugly language that's had a crazy evolution,

38:32.000 --> 38:34.000
but at least it's not –

38:34.000 --> 38:36.000
It was never meant to be a full language.

38:36.000 --> 38:38.000
It's been bolted on like Frankenstein.

38:38.000 --> 38:41.000
It's like the crappiest version of Voltron.

38:41.000 --> 38:43.000
Oh, man.

38:43.000 --> 38:45.000
Why would you want that running in your database?

38:45.000 --> 38:47.000
I don't know. Maybe I'm just being a jerk.

38:47.000 --> 38:48.000
Yeah, that's why I love you.

38:48.000 --> 38:50.000
I've hated Node from the beginning.

38:50.000 --> 38:51.000
I hate Dino, too.

38:51.000 --> 38:53.000
Yeah, you have been consistent.

38:53.000 --> 38:55.000
I've been very consistent.

38:55.000 --> 38:59.000
And now the creators of Node.js apparently hate it as well,

38:59.000 --> 39:01.000
which I think is what you really love about this story.

39:01.000 --> 39:05.000
What I love is they got paid doing something I still think is insane,

39:05.000 --> 39:06.000
and I'm still broke.

39:06.000 --> 39:08.000
So, hey, whatever. Maybe I'm wrong.

39:08.000 --> 39:14.000
Boy, we have just, I guess, nothing but to wait and see where Dino goes, I suppose.

39:14.000 --> 39:16.000
I don't have much more to say about it.

39:16.000 --> 39:17.000
It's brand new to me.

39:17.000 --> 39:19.000
They will come on the show one day.

39:19.000 --> 39:21.000
I'm sure they will enjoy this commentary.

39:21.000 --> 39:23.000
Coder.show slash contact.

39:23.000 --> 39:24.000
You know, it's the typescript.

39:24.000 --> 39:26.000
That's what's going to get people fired up.

39:26.000 --> 39:30.000
All right. Well, let's do our last topic of the day then.

39:30.000 --> 39:34.000
This one is the one that has spooked me all week.

39:34.000 --> 39:36.000
I really stepped in it last week

39:36.000 --> 39:38.000
when I opened my mouth about how I was worried

39:38.000 --> 39:42.000
that Apple's new platform goodies would draw Linux users in

39:42.000 --> 39:46.000
because then I started getting notes from people all week long

39:46.000 --> 39:47.000
that confirmed my fears.

39:47.000 --> 39:50.000
So let's start with Grav because he says, don't worry about it.

39:50.000 --> 39:52.000
Mac OS is crap.

39:52.000 --> 39:54.000
He says, I know you guys are still freaking out about the M1,

39:54.000 --> 39:58.000
but the general public doesn't care how many cores are in a system.

39:58.000 --> 40:04.000
Look at Intel laptops that still sell despite AMD's amazing 4700U or 4800U.

40:04.000 --> 40:07.000
You guys remind me back when the console fanboys would freak out

40:07.000 --> 40:10.000
when the opposing team suddenly got better and faster hardware.

40:10.000 --> 40:14.000
Just like the console space, it's games that sell the platform.

40:14.000 --> 40:17.000
Big Sur is a pain in the butt.

40:17.000 --> 40:19.000
It has huge compatibility issues

40:19.000 --> 40:21.000
and Apple's dominance in the computing space

40:21.000 --> 40:24.000
has really only existed in a niche.

40:24.000 --> 40:27.000
Mac OS simply isn't designed for productivity.

40:27.000 --> 40:30.000
Mac OS is designed for ease of...

40:30.000 --> 40:31.000
Okay. All right.

40:31.000 --> 40:35.000
Let's back away. I think he means like the Microsoft kind of productivity,

40:35.000 --> 40:37.000
like Excel, Word, perhaps.

40:37.000 --> 40:39.000
That's what I think, you know.

40:39.000 --> 40:43.000
Ask the legions of developers at every conference ever who have Macbooks.

40:43.000 --> 40:44.000
Sure.

40:44.000 --> 40:47.000
Yeah. But he thinks like, you know, it lacks decent Windows snap features

40:47.000 --> 40:49.000
that like Windows has had since 7.

40:49.000 --> 40:52.000
There's just basic like navigation stuff you can't do.

40:52.000 --> 40:56.000
Like when you click closing a window, it's still running and that confuses users.

40:56.000 --> 40:58.000
He says that he talked to his buddy at Best Buy

40:58.000 --> 41:03.000
and that people return even the M1 Macs because they hate Mac OS.

41:03.000 --> 41:06.000
I mean, 20 hours of battery life.

41:06.000 --> 41:07.000
You know, he thinks that's it.

41:07.000 --> 41:12.000
But unfortunately, Grav was very much, very much in the minority.

41:12.000 --> 41:15.000
We had many more people that wrote in that said, yeah.

41:15.000 --> 41:16.000
So Jeff was one of them.

41:16.000 --> 41:18.000
He says, I was listening to episode 406

41:18.000 --> 41:23.000
and Chris's worry about the M1 Macs illustrates the battle in my soul right now.

41:23.000 --> 41:27.000
He says that I've pretty much written everything off except for ThinkPads,

41:27.000 --> 41:30.000
but the more I look at it, I really can't justify a ThinkPad

41:30.000 --> 41:33.000
to the MacBook Air's performance and battery life.

41:33.000 --> 41:35.000
And then you add in lack of fan noise

41:35.000 --> 41:39.000
and I just really can't justify the cost of an Intel laptop.

41:39.000 --> 41:42.000
I'm pretty uncomfortable with this because I've been running Linux,

41:42.000 --> 41:47.000
usually Fedora or OpenSUSE, exclusively for over a decade.

41:47.000 --> 41:50.000
But comparing an Intel machine, an M1, as an investment,

41:50.000 --> 41:53.000
well, it's just obvious which machine is a better buy.

41:53.000 --> 41:56.000
It's true that you give up a lot of control with Apple,

41:56.000 --> 41:59.000
but compromises I'd be making over just getting a Mac

41:59.000 --> 42:01.000
are starting to stack up now.

42:01.000 --> 42:03.000
I'd never have considered an Intel Mac,

42:03.000 --> 42:05.000
but looking at the M1 MacBook Air,

42:05.000 --> 42:08.000
which laptop decision is a lot harder than it's ever been?

42:08.000 --> 42:12.000
I don't think Chris's fears are unfounded at all.

42:12.000 --> 42:14.000
Okay, all right.

42:14.000 --> 42:17.000
I mean, you could just buy Magnet for $5

42:17.000 --> 42:19.000
and you have Windows snapping on Mac.

42:19.000 --> 42:21.000
Yeah, Magnet is pretty nice.

42:21.000 --> 42:25.000
Last one, listener Mike writes in, get this.

42:25.000 --> 42:29.000
He's a card-carrying member of the FSF.

42:29.000 --> 42:31.000
He says, I just listened to the latest Koda radio,

42:31.000 --> 42:33.000
longtime Linux user.

42:33.000 --> 42:38.000
I switched to 100% desktop Linux in 1997.

42:38.000 --> 42:42.000
Wow.

42:42.000 --> 42:44.000
I'm going to get some butterscotch for this, hang on.

42:44.000 --> 42:47.000
Could you imagine full-time desktop Linux since 1997?

42:47.000 --> 42:49.000
I mean, I've been pretty close to full-time,

42:49.000 --> 42:51.000
but I mean, there's occasional Mac-age in there.

42:51.000 --> 42:52.000
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

42:52.000 --> 42:53.000
That's just wild.

42:53.000 --> 42:55.000
Around the time Mac OS 10.3 came out,

42:55.000 --> 42:58.000
I was one of those people who switched away from Linux to the Mac.

42:58.000 --> 43:00.000
I still use Linux on the server, but until 2015,

43:00.000 --> 43:02.000
I used Mac OS on the desktop.

43:02.000 --> 43:03.000
Oh, okay.

43:03.000 --> 43:06.000
In 2015, I switched back to Linux for the desktop for reasons,

43:06.000 --> 43:08.000
and I've been mostly happy since then.

43:08.000 --> 43:11.000
We recently upgraded out of a family computer to an M1 Mac Mini,

43:11.000 --> 43:13.000
and it's so fast.

43:13.000 --> 43:16.000
Not only is it so fast, but it integrates with all the things,

43:16.000 --> 43:19.000
text messages, iMessage, HomeKit, Apple TV.

43:19.000 --> 43:22.000
It's a level of integration that I never really considered

43:22.000 --> 43:25.000
and didn't realize I was missing on Linux.

43:25.000 --> 43:29.000
As an associate member of the FSF since 2004,

43:29.000 --> 43:31.000
software freedom is important to me,

43:31.000 --> 43:35.000
but I'm also in my 40s now with a busy family.

43:35.000 --> 43:38.000
I have less time to tinker, and I just need to get stuff done.

43:38.000 --> 43:40.000
I'm due for a machine upgrade this year,

43:40.000 --> 43:43.000
and I work with containers and virtualization.

43:43.000 --> 43:47.000
If Apple releases a MacBook Pro with 32 gigs of RAM this year,

43:47.000 --> 43:49.000
I'm going to pull the trigger.

43:49.000 --> 43:51.000
I'm going to go back to Mac for a daily driver.

43:51.000 --> 43:53.000
Software freedom is important,

43:53.000 --> 43:58.000
but so is running my workload 25% to 30% faster on an $800 Mac Mini.

43:58.000 --> 43:59.000
There you go.

43:59.000 --> 44:01.000
And the battery life is nuts on the MacBook Air.

44:01.000 --> 44:03.000
That's just going to win out.

44:03.000 --> 44:05.000
So could I be a dick for a second?

44:05.000 --> 44:08.000
Why is it bad that Apple has a better architecture?

44:08.000 --> 44:11.000
Why isn't this an opportunity for the Linux vendors to step up?

44:11.000 --> 44:13.000
Well, and that is being done.

44:13.000 --> 44:16.000
Somebody has to write all of the drivers,

44:16.000 --> 44:19.000
all of the support for the GPU, the sound system, the network, everything.

44:19.000 --> 44:21.000
And Wes only has so much time.

44:21.000 --> 44:24.000
So building an amazing CPU architecture is hard.

44:24.000 --> 44:25.000
Tell me more.

44:25.000 --> 44:29.000
Oh, I mean, if Apple were to release drivers or some documentation even,

44:29.000 --> 44:31.000
it would make it a lot easier.

44:31.000 --> 44:32.000
But they hate you.

44:32.000 --> 44:35.000
That's the other problem is it's a vendor-hostile system, right?

44:35.000 --> 44:37.000
I mean, you don't really want to.

44:37.000 --> 44:39.000
Or they at least don't care about you.

44:39.000 --> 44:40.000
No, no, they hate you.

44:40.000 --> 44:41.000
I'm going to go with that.

44:41.000 --> 44:43.000
Well, the reason why this still haunts me,

44:43.000 --> 44:46.000
I was actually just talking to somebody about this earlier today,

44:46.000 --> 44:48.000
it's because I watched it happen last time.

44:48.000 --> 44:50.000
I watched when the Intel Macs came out and stuff.

44:50.000 --> 44:54.000
And it killed me to see all of my brothers and sisters switching away

44:54.000 --> 44:57.000
from Linux on the desktop to Mac.

44:57.000 --> 45:01.000
And I never forgot that.

45:01.000 --> 45:04.000
Because they were all glowing apples.

45:04.000 --> 45:06.000
We just went to halls of glowing apples.

45:06.000 --> 45:07.000
And I've never forgotten that.

45:07.000 --> 45:11.000
And I look at this chip shortage that we have

45:11.000 --> 45:14.000
and how it's affecting all these different manufacturers.

45:14.000 --> 45:16.000
It's affecting GPU supply.

45:16.000 --> 45:17.000
It's affecting motherboard supply.

45:17.000 --> 45:19.000
All the components.

45:19.000 --> 45:23.000
Well, Apple, of course, buys their components years in advance.

45:23.000 --> 45:26.000
So they're going to be probably one of the best here.

45:26.000 --> 45:32.000
They have prices and stocks that's pre-contracted

45:32.000 --> 45:34.000
and locked in years in advance in time.

45:34.000 --> 45:38.000
And so if the chip manufacturer or whoever,

45:38.000 --> 45:41.000
if the foundry can't deliver,

45:41.000 --> 45:44.000
Apple's in a pretty good negotiation position there.

45:44.000 --> 45:46.000
They can get higher prices at the foundry.

45:46.000 --> 45:48.000
Apple can probably get something they want out of it.

45:48.000 --> 45:51.000
And they can easily either just eat that cost

45:51.000 --> 45:53.000
or happily pass it along to the customers

45:53.000 --> 45:55.000
and the customers are going to pay for it.

45:55.000 --> 45:58.000
And when you look at the people in the market

45:58.000 --> 46:00.000
who are upgrading for performance right now,

46:00.000 --> 46:02.000
and we hear from them,

46:02.000 --> 46:04.000
the Mac platform may be one of the only platforms

46:04.000 --> 46:07.000
that's selling in any bulk quantity right now

46:07.000 --> 46:10.000
because of Apple's position in the market and the chip shortage.

46:10.000 --> 46:12.000
And when the chip shortage is over,

46:12.000 --> 46:14.000
Apple will probably have weathered it the best

46:14.000 --> 46:17.000
and probably have secured contracts for components.

46:17.000 --> 46:20.000
They'll probably be at the front of the line for this stuff.

46:20.000 --> 46:23.000
And that's going to mean that they're going to be able to ship

46:23.000 --> 46:25.000
and sell the most systems.

46:25.000 --> 46:27.000
There are vendors right now that are reporting

46:27.000 --> 46:29.000
that their sales are being artificially limited

46:29.000 --> 46:31.000
just because they don't have the supply.

46:31.000 --> 46:33.000
They cannot ship enough product,

46:33.000 --> 46:35.000
and so they can't sell anymore.

46:35.000 --> 46:37.000
That is a perfect storm.

46:37.000 --> 46:39.000
You have the M1 platform.

46:39.000 --> 46:41.000
I was just talking with a well-known developer

46:41.000 --> 46:43.000
who will be on Linux Unplugged tomorrow.

46:43.000 --> 46:47.000
He's from the GTK Python era of the Linux desktop,

46:47.000 --> 46:49.000
and he says that he kind of, this was 10 years ago

46:49.000 --> 46:51.000
when he created the Lutris application,

46:51.000 --> 46:55.000
and everybody was doing GTK Python, GTK Python, GTK Python

46:55.000 --> 46:58.000
all over the Linux desktop all day long every week, GTK Python.

46:58.000 --> 47:00.000
And now it's just pretty much gone.

47:00.000 --> 47:04.000
There's hardly no new projects at all that are using GTK Python,

47:04.000 --> 47:07.000
and there's no clear development path forward for him.

47:07.000 --> 47:10.000
He doesn't have a clear strategy.

47:10.000 --> 47:12.000
Should he move on? Should he stay with it?

47:12.000 --> 47:14.000
Should he switch over?

47:14.000 --> 47:16.000
I mean, he's considering everything.

47:16.000 --> 47:18.000
He's even considering Vala and GTK and elementary,

47:18.000 --> 47:21.000
like whatever he can do to just keep it relevant.

47:21.000 --> 47:24.000
But the platform just sort of piddled out,

47:24.000 --> 47:27.000
and there's not a good solution for him.

47:27.000 --> 47:29.000
And you look at developers like him.

47:29.000 --> 47:32.000
He's a special case because he's creating something specifically for Linux.

47:32.000 --> 47:35.000
But developers like him, and in that similar position,

47:35.000 --> 47:37.000
they're just burning out.

47:37.000 --> 47:39.000
He's, and I can't say their names,

47:39.000 --> 47:41.000
but he's been talking to developers

47:41.000 --> 47:44.000
that are like productivity applications for Linux.

47:44.000 --> 47:46.000
They're feeling the same way.

47:46.000 --> 47:48.000
They're feeling like they're done.

47:48.000 --> 47:50.000
And what they're all kind of universally saying is

47:50.000 --> 47:53.000
there just needs to be a shift in Linux,

47:53.000 --> 47:57.000
like a new way for open source developers to monetize

47:57.000 --> 48:02.000
that doesn't burden them with tons of pull requests or support issues

48:02.000 --> 48:06.000
that scales and properly monetizes.

48:06.000 --> 48:09.000
And then they need a platform that they can target

48:09.000 --> 48:11.000
and isn't shifting under them constantly.

48:11.000 --> 48:14.000
So that way they can actually ship an application for 10 years

48:14.000 --> 48:17.000
and whittle away at it and refine it with a limited staff.

48:17.000 --> 48:19.000
And that's just not there right now.

48:19.000 --> 48:21.000
And there's a lot of frustration.

48:21.000 --> 48:24.000
There's something bubbling that people are not talking about

48:24.000 --> 48:27.000
because the only things people talk about in Linux media

48:27.000 --> 48:32.000
on YouTube and Reddit and podcasts and blogs is mostly positive shit.

48:32.000 --> 48:35.000
They only talk about the good stuff because nobody wants a downer.

48:35.000 --> 48:38.000
But the reality is there is a storm brewing,

48:38.000 --> 48:40.000
and I'm going to touch on it a little bit in Linux Unplugged,

48:40.000 --> 48:43.000
and I think that storm combined with the chip shortage,

48:43.000 --> 48:44.000
combined with people looking for performance,

48:44.000 --> 48:47.000
combined with the compelling aspects of the M1 by itself

48:47.000 --> 48:50.000
is creating a perfect storm that will create a vacuum on Linux

48:50.000 --> 48:53.000
and suck people over to the Apple platform.

48:53.000 --> 48:55.000
It's not me trying to justify buying some M1 Mac.

48:55.000 --> 48:58.000
It's not me just making nothing out of something

48:58.000 --> 49:00.000
because I've watched it happen once before

49:00.000 --> 49:02.000
and I'm seeing the components arrive

49:02.000 --> 49:06.000
and they're aligning to create a Linux desktop exodus.

49:06.000 --> 49:08.000
And it would be a damn shame

49:08.000 --> 49:11.000
because things are getting so great over there right now.

49:11.000 --> 49:14.000
Anyways, you know, all week.

49:14.000 --> 49:18.000
But are they getting great because of these application developers?

49:18.000 --> 49:22.000
Not that I don't appreciate them, but to me like Lutris in particular

49:22.000 --> 49:25.000
and a lot of these kind of weird native apps for Linux,

49:25.000 --> 49:26.000
like they've never been well supported.

49:26.000 --> 49:28.000
They've never been very robust.

49:28.000 --> 49:31.000
They kind of only made sense before we had networked services

49:31.000 --> 49:32.000
and they were like good enough.

49:32.000 --> 49:34.000
Oh yeah, I've got my little to-do app.

49:34.000 --> 49:36.000
I don't know, most of the main things I use,

49:36.000 --> 49:38.000
I end up having to collaborate with other people anyway.

49:38.000 --> 49:40.000
And I guess that's a sad statement about those apps,

49:40.000 --> 49:43.000
but I've already gotten there as a Linux user.

49:43.000 --> 49:45.000
I'm just going to go use Steam.

49:45.000 --> 49:48.000
I'm just going to go use OWA in a browser.

49:48.000 --> 49:53.000
Yeah, I felt like we were approaching the next precipice of wave of users

49:53.000 --> 49:56.000
because when you look at Fedora 34 right now,

49:56.000 --> 50:00.000
it's really getting there with GNOME 40, with Wayland, with PipeWire.

50:00.000 --> 50:02.000
They actually have a decent audio video system

50:02.000 --> 50:05.000
that's compelling and competitive with Mac OS.

50:05.000 --> 50:08.000
The kernel has gotten really good in these later iterations,

50:08.000 --> 50:09.000
the shipping with a modern kernel.

50:09.000 --> 50:15.000
It's got ButterFS, so it has a file system that is competitive with NTFS and APFS,

50:15.000 --> 50:19.000
and it has transparent compression now, which reduces excessive write SSD,

50:19.000 --> 50:21.000
so it's going to prolong disk.

50:21.000 --> 50:22.000
And it's like a really solid OS

50:22.000 --> 50:26.000
and truly represents what desktop Linux workstation can be,

50:26.000 --> 50:29.000
and it just needs more application developers.

50:29.000 --> 50:33.000
But I don't think application developers are going to stick around.

50:33.000 --> 50:36.000
This is something I've just been coming to because, honestly,

50:36.000 --> 50:40.000
I've been getting telegrams and tweets and emails all week from people saying,

50:40.000 --> 50:41.000
yeah, I think I'm going to switch.

50:41.000 --> 50:44.000
My other question, are desktop apps, I mean,

50:44.000 --> 50:48.000
it doesn't really seem like a renaissance in desktop apps for any platform.

50:48.000 --> 50:51.000
I mean, Mac definitely has more established ones,

50:51.000 --> 50:55.000
but I think on this show already you guys have talked about like how hard that is,

50:55.000 --> 50:57.000
how hard it is to keep up with Apple's breaking changes,

50:57.000 --> 51:01.000
how it's pretty small single developers who get stressed out about maintaining these things,

51:01.000 --> 51:03.000
how app store profits are going down.

51:03.000 --> 51:05.000
Maybe Windows has a lot of native,

51:05.000 --> 51:09.000
it just seems like native applications are not really a thing that's in vogue.

51:09.000 --> 51:13.000
Windows does not have a good independent native ecosystem.

51:13.000 --> 51:19.000
It's more you can monetize an app across Mac OS and iOS easier

51:19.000 --> 51:21.000
than you can on say Linux and Android,

51:21.000 --> 51:24.000
where Android is the closest corollary to Linux.

51:24.000 --> 51:30.000
Yeah, I actually think in a weird way Mac OS is having not a renaissance,

51:30.000 --> 51:35.000
but a renewed influx of desktop applications

51:35.000 --> 51:38.000
because of some of the cross platform stuff that they've been doing.

51:38.000 --> 51:40.000
I actually kind of disagree.

51:40.000 --> 51:44.000
I actually think the Mac has a pretty vibrant third party app ecosystem.

51:44.000 --> 51:46.000
It is competitive and it is hard to get paid

51:46.000 --> 51:49.000
and the app store issues are there and they are real,

51:49.000 --> 51:53.000
but there's a lot and there's some big apps now.

51:53.000 --> 51:56.000
If I can be shameless on my old interview show, the Mike Dominic show,

51:56.000 --> 52:00.000
we had the folks from Rocamiba on and they don't deal with the app store at all.

52:00.000 --> 52:04.000
They sell their apps directly and they've been in business for what, 30 years?

52:04.000 --> 52:05.000
Something like that.

52:05.000 --> 52:07.000
Ridiculous since the early aughts, maybe 20 years.

52:07.000 --> 52:10.000
They're one of my favorite examples because the software they make is awesome.

52:10.000 --> 52:12.000
I use it every day.

52:12.000 --> 52:17.000
That's one of those tools that makes me go, oh, I wish I could switch.

52:17.000 --> 52:22.000
Or Wes, you remember that machine learning powered video editor

52:22.000 --> 52:26.000
that let you edit as a text document because that's Mac only.

52:26.000 --> 52:29.000
That thing is pretty advanced and pretty new.

52:29.000 --> 52:33.000
Anyways, I don't know.

52:33.000 --> 52:36.000
Like I said, I'm pretty happy with Linux.

52:36.000 --> 52:38.000
I think it's gotten pretty great, but we'll see.

52:38.000 --> 52:39.000
We'll see what happens.

52:39.000 --> 52:41.000
You spooked me, y'all, is what happened.

52:41.000 --> 52:42.000
I got real spooked.

52:42.000 --> 52:45.000
I've been belly aching to Wes for a week about it.

52:45.000 --> 52:47.000
Haven't I?

52:47.000 --> 52:49.000
I've been telling you for a week about the notes I'm getting in.

52:49.000 --> 52:50.000
Yes, you have.

52:50.000 --> 52:53.000
I mean, I feel it's hard when there's something on the market that's,

52:53.000 --> 52:54.000
you're like, well, that's compelling.

52:54.000 --> 52:56.000
I could see having an M1 hanging around.

52:56.000 --> 53:01.000
I don't know that I would turn it into my dedicated system I spend all my time on,

53:01.000 --> 53:05.000
but great battery life, good performance for media production.

53:05.000 --> 53:07.000
It's definitely compelling.

53:07.000 --> 53:10.000
I can let that topic rest unless the audience has more they want to discuss,

53:10.000 --> 53:14.000
coder.show slash contact, but that was sort of my follow-up on that one.

53:14.000 --> 53:16.000
Wes, thanks for coming and hanging out with us.

53:16.000 --> 53:17.000
Thanks, Mr. Payne.

53:17.000 --> 53:18.000
Thanks for having me.

53:18.000 --> 53:19.000
Absolutely.

53:19.000 --> 53:21.000
Go check out some Wes Payne on Linux Action News.

53:21.000 --> 53:24.000
He's joining me over there and killing it.

53:24.000 --> 53:26.000
Been enjoying that a lot.

53:26.000 --> 53:30.000
And the last episode we just did, I was told today, was a barn burner.

53:30.000 --> 53:31.000
It was really good.

53:31.000 --> 53:34.000
Episode 182, linuxactionnews.com slash 182.

53:34.000 --> 53:39.000
And we break down some of the new interface enhancements and technical

53:39.000 --> 53:43.000
enhancements to GNOME 40, also talk about the RMS situation,

53:43.000 --> 53:47.000
him being back with the FSF, and we go deep into the chip shortage.

53:47.000 --> 53:52.000
And Carl from System76 gives us an update on how System76 is handling the

53:52.000 --> 53:54.000
chip shortage and what they expect.

53:54.000 --> 53:57.000
So that's all at linuxactionnews.com.

53:57.000 --> 53:59.000
Go get more Wes.

53:59.000 --> 54:02.000
Also, thank you to our members over at coderqa.co.

54:02.000 --> 54:05.000
If you haven't signed up yet and you want to get the Coderly,

54:05.000 --> 54:08.000
go sign up right now as you're listening to this because there will be a new

54:08.000 --> 54:10.000
Coderly very, very soon.

54:10.000 --> 54:13.000
So you go to coderqa.co for that.

54:13.000 --> 54:16.000
Plus, you support the show, which is really what's great, right?

54:16.000 --> 54:19.000
And you get a limited ad feed, so it's nice, tight, and clean.

54:19.000 --> 54:23.000
Still the same full, great production, but just a little bit snappier.

54:23.000 --> 54:25.000
That's all at coderqa.co.

54:25.000 --> 54:28.000
And you can find a Cloud Guru on social media.

54:28.000 --> 54:32.000
They are slash a Cloud Guru at YouTube, Twitter, you know, everywhere.

54:32.000 --> 54:34.000
Everywhere, it's just slash a Cloud Guru.

54:34.000 --> 54:36.000
And you can find Mike on Twitter.

54:36.000 --> 54:37.000
He's at Dumanuku.

54:37.000 --> 54:39.000
His company is at the Mad Botter Inc.

54:39.000 --> 54:41.000
Is there anything else you want to mention, Mr. Dominic?

54:41.000 --> 54:42.000
Nope, all good.

54:42.000 --> 54:44.000
Wow, nice and tidy right there.

54:44.000 --> 54:45.000
I'm also there.

54:45.000 --> 54:49.000
The podcast network is at Jupiter Signal, and the show is at Coder Radio Show.

54:49.000 --> 54:53.000
Links to just about most of the things we talked about today are at coder.show

54:53.000 --> 54:54.000
slash 407.

54:54.000 --> 54:58.000
There you're going to find our contact form, the RSS feed, links to our sponsors,

54:58.000 --> 55:00.000
how to support the show, all of that.

55:00.000 --> 55:02.000
Of course, you can also join us live.

55:02.000 --> 55:08.000
We do the show 5 p.m. Pacific, 8 p.m. Eastern at jblive.tv on a Monday.

55:08.000 --> 55:09.000
Come hang out.

55:09.000 --> 55:12.000
Maybe give Fat Cat a hard time in there, you know?

55:12.000 --> 55:13.000
Oh, and title the show, too.

55:13.000 --> 55:14.000
That's another advantage.

55:14.000 --> 55:18.000
