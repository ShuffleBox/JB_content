This is Koda Radio, episode 433, for September 27th?

2
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,360
Hello friends, and welcome into Jupiter Broadcasting's weekly talk show, taking a pragmatic look

3
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:24,080

4
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:27,960
This here episode is brought to you by Cloud Guru, you know Cloud Guru has those cloud

7
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:42,960
So I'm Chris, and of course we are joined every single week by our esteemed host, the

8
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:45,280
man in Florida himself, Mr. Dominic.

9
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:46,280
What's up?

10
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:47,280
Hello.

11
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:48,280
Hey girl.

12
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:49,280
Oh hey, how you doing?

13
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:50,280
I am good.

14
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:55,440
I have been coding to the bone, Python baby, all day, all night.

15
00:00:55,440 --> 00:01:00,240
Well it seems like you're doing three things, I'll spoil the third one last, but I do know

16
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:04,360
number one is Python, number two is bitching about Safari on Twitter, I know you're getting

17
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:05,760
in on that a lot.

18
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:09,680
Every time I change tabs, it's like a psychedelic adventure, I don't understand why.

19
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:10,680
Oots, oots, oots.

20
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:14,600
Yeah, you're at the disco when you're browsing the web now, I think it's brave.

21
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:17,960
But the third is the most important, and we just gotta get to it at the top of the show,

22
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:22,640
we can't delay anymore, according to Twitter, you now have a kitty cat.

23
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:24,200
I do have a kitty cat.

24
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:25,200
Wow, congratulations.

25
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,560
Thank you, I've had a kitty cat for about a month, but I don't think I've ever shared

26
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:28,800
that I have a kitty cat.

27
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:33,280
He is the most savage, savage of QA personnel.

28
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:37,560
Yeah, you gotta put him on the payroll for tax purposes, I totally understand.

29
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:41,480
If the code is bad enough, he just takes a quick nap on my launch keyboard and deletes

30
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:42,480
a file or two.

31
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:45,640
I just kinda take umbrage with the fact that you've had a kitty for a month and this is

32
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:47,120
the first time it came up on the show.

33
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:51,120
I'm sorry, you know what, I just, there's so much going on, I'm God willing, I'm launching

34
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:56,760
something by or more likely on the 15th of October, but you know, developers and estimates

35
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:57,760
always fun.

36
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:00,720
We could blame the audience for yelling at us for last week and just threw us off our

37
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:01,720
game.

38
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:04,780
Yeah, you know, I just cried for like a week, really, that's what happened.

39
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:08,720
Just really super briefly, and I mean this, I mentioned last week that I was really looking

40
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:13,040
forward to trying out the new focus feature on iOS 15.

41
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:17,840
As a man who is deeply challenged with his ADHD, I have to say focus mode has been great,

42
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:23,360
and what really put it over the top is when I combine it with shortcuts and NFC tags.

43
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:28,680
So I have an NFC tag here on my mixer in the studio, and I have it set to when I put my

44
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:35,120
phone down, which is, this mixer, oddly enough, has a phone holder, it has a spot for your

45
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:40,280
phone and so I put the NFC tag in that spot, and when I set my phone down in its little

46
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:45,700
spot here, it automatically sets it to recording mode, which is so brilliant, and you can do

47
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:50,120
shortcuts in a way where it doesn't prompt you, it just does it, and then I have it set

48
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:54,720
to just automatically turn off when I leave, and it's been great.

49
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:55,720
It has been.

50
00:02:55,720 --> 00:03:00,000
That is choice, and so I'm gonna put a little NFC tag at my desk and a little NFC tag on

51
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,720
my way out to the car, and I'll just tap it as I'm going there or I get to my desk and

52
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:07,720
set the different modes, and I never even have to touch a button on the phone, I just

53
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:09,760
put it where I was gonna set the phone down anyways.

54
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,520
It's pretty slick.

55
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:12,520
That is pretty cool.

56
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:15,720
I mean, you could do this, I bet you could build this with Android.

57
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:19,520
If you use Tasker or you built, you know, you strung together several apps, you could

58
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:22,640
have probably done this on Android like a year ago, two years ago.

59
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:26,880
Yeah, but really, I mean, do you wanna build it with Android?

60
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:29,520
No, it was so, I did it in five seconds, really.

61
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:32,680
I just sit in here experimenting, like, oh, on shortcuts, I'll go to automations, oh,

62
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:33,680
boop, boop, done.

63
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:36,680
Oh, wow, that's nice.

64
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:38,620
So yeah, I thought it was pretty great.

65
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:45,400
We have more feedback this week regarding fair pay and the struggles with that and Apple

66
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:46,960
has been in the news in this regard.

67
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:49,940
That's how we got into this entire conversation to begin with.

68
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:54,040
Right after the show last week, I think, Tim Cook had like a big workplace meeting, you

69
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:57,280
know, where everybody was either, I don't know how many of them were actually in person,

70
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:01,840
but you know, they all get on the Zoom call, or I guess it's WebEx in their case.

71
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:05,760
And they have the senior vice president of retail there because that's something that

72
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:09,320
doesn't come up in our conversation a lot, but a big part of this is actually coming

73
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:11,480
from the retail space in Apple.

74
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:15,800
That's where a lot of this fair pay pushback is coming from is retail workers.

75
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:20,400
I'm sure it's true for people that are working at the UFO or that work in development areas

76
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:25,520
too, but that's actually in terms of the large segment of the Apple population that's pissed

77
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:26,700
off.

78
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:31,880
And so they had the senior vice president of retail there and people and they addressed

79
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:36,400
a range of subjects, even like political subjects, but according to the activist employees that

80
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:41,520
have been leaking, they told various publications that Tim Cook answered only two out of a number

81
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:44,280
of questions that they wanted to ask about fair pay.

82
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:51,440
And then really, they said, just failed to deliver any details on what his answers were.

83
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:56,040
And then of course, Apple said it was committed to pay equity, but you know, we got an email

84
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:59,560
into the show and I think it kind of put it in a little more perspective for me.

85
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:02,200
It seems like people are like exasperated.

86
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:09,520
And I think that's why the tone of a lot of the feedback was so charged because people

87
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:11,240
are at a breaking point with this.

88
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:12,240
Yeah, I think that's fair.

89
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:17,160
And also, you know, I don't understand what Apple thought they were going to accomplish

90
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:18,160
with that.

91
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,160
I know.

92
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,160
It seems like they should do better.

93
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,160
Yeah.

94
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:23,760
Or it seems like they should just like give up, right?

95
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:24,760
Like stop talking.

96
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:31,880
Like if they really want to change things and you know, not have these problems, I think

97
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:35,320
obviously and I forget her name, but I've interacted with her on Twitter, I feel like

98
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:36,320
such a jerk.

99
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:40,320
But like the cases where like they take employees phones, and like they make you put your personal

100
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:43,120
stuff including photos.

101
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,920
And that's like your work device.

102
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:48,920
And there's a couple cases of this have been documented where it's like, very intimate,

103
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:54,120
very personal data ends up just like, you know, all your data is mine, copyright Apple

104
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,520
if you work for them, right?

105
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,640
That probably needs to be a practice that doesn't exist.

106
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:59,440
Yeah, the verge had a great article.

107
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:02,620
And I thought this was common sense, but apparently it's not.

108
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:07,920
Even if you're working from home, your employer's laptop is their laptop.

109
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:11,320
Anything you put on it, they have every right to monitor blah, blah, blah, right?

110
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:13,300
So buy a laptop.

111
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:16,700
If we have time today, I grabbed a store you and I are on the same exact page.

112
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:19,880
If we have time, I grabbed a series of studies about that.

113
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:22,040
And anyways, I'd love to talk more about that.

114
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:23,040
Yeah.

115
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:24,040
That's a whole other thing, isn't it?

116
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:25,040
You're on your land.

117
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:28,040
And then you have to the question becomes like, what are they if they own them, if they

118
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:32,240
own that network interface, well, then are they allowed to capture whatever they want

119
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,240
from it?

120
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:35,480
You know, there's a lot of there's a lot of questions I have about that.

121
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:37,760
Yeah, I think that's a much murkier area.

122
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:43,080
But they can certainly say, Hey, man, you're using your work laptop, and you put whatever

123
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:45,800
things you didn't want us to see on there too bad, so sad.

124
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:49,140
That's a common hammer that they can hit you with.

125
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:52,080
And you got to think about it, especially too, if you're developing your own thing,

126
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:55,360
like if you have a little side project, you got to make sure you're not using any work

127
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:56,360
hardware for that.

128
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:57,360
No work resources.

129
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,520
Well, that was the plot of a season of Silicon Valley, right?

130
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:04,680
Richard Hendricks accident spoilers for something that came out years ago, like his MacBook

131
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:06,080
died and was in the Apple Store.

132
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:11,440
So he used one of who leaves his his, you know, who he issued a laptop.

133
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:15,360
And I mean, of course, as a dramatization, but that is a thing that happens to people

134
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:17,040
like never all the time, man.

135
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:21,280
I know, I know more than a few people that that has happened to.

136
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:22,880
Like, I take this a lot further.

137
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:26,320
I think everybody like if you want to have a blog, don't be on medium.

138
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:28,360
Don't don't be any of these services.

139
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:29,360
Yeah.

140
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:30,360
Spin up your own domain.

141
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:35,760
Have your own thing on only IP down to literally the IP address.

142
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:36,760
Right.

143
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:41,600
Like, you know, that is the thing is so many people that wrote in were exasperated because

144
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:47,440
they feel like they are at the mercy of this employer, and they have no ownership.

145
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:50,720
They have no say on what go is what going on, what's going on.

146
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:54,620
And because their livelihood and their whole lifestyle and feeding their family all depends

147
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:58,280
on it, it is it is extremely stressful for them.

148
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:01,880
And a lot of these emails, I was reading it, I was starting to think to myself, yes, that's

149
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:03,720
why I run my own business.

150
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:07,720
Even though I was employed for a while, I went back to running my own business.

151
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:11,240
Because it's the only it's the only way you really have control over the situation.

152
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:13,000
And I don't think it's for everybody.

153
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,440
And I'm not trying to advocate everybody quit their job.

154
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:16,480
The opposite, actually.

155
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:21,040
But that that that kind of control and that kind of ownership is, I think, what drives

156
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:24,440
a lot of people to run their own business.

157
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:27,840
And there's not an option for everybody.

158
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:31,240
So I grok that it's a it's a really it's it's a real rock in a hard spot.

159
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:35,640
And, you know, it's funny, too, with Apple in this particular case.

160
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:39,200
They could quite literally pay to make this problem go away.

161
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,360
And they could afford it like that's the wild thing here.

162
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:45,680
And it really kind of shows you the core characteristic of Apple, the way we see it through their

163
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:50,320
app store policies and their and their grifting on in-app purchases for stuff that they don't

164
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:56,080
really even add value to that kind of culture also is pervasive in how they pay their staff,

165
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:58,600
because they are so rich.

166
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:01,840
They could truly just justify if I mean, be honest with yourself.

167
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:06,440
If they gave everyone a 25 percent raise tomorrow.

168
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:07,880
All these leaks go away.

169
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:10,000
These problems all go away.

170
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,040
And Apple could look at it as an investment in brand.

171
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:17,760
They're not going to do it because they don't like the idea of increasing their ongoing

172
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:18,760
costs like that.

173
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:22,800
They're very, you know, they're very cutthroat when it comes to cost.

174
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,380
And that's just too high of a cost.

175
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:30,320
But they not only literally could afford to do it, but they could actually I mean, how

176
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:34,880
often you have the you have the option of your problems go away if you just write a

177
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:35,880
check.

178
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:37,640
And that's exactly the position they're in.

179
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:39,740
And they still refuse to write that check.

180
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:43,960
And if you're Apple, you know, me or you have a problem that could be solved with the check.

181
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:47,300
It's, you know, the cost benefits kind of kind of rough.

182
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:51,480
But for them, it's like, I don't know, aren't they richer than most or almost every country?

183
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:52,480
Yeah.

184
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:55,600
So Ben thinks that we kind of missed connecting on the core issues as I work for an enterprise

185
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:59,560
software company in a multibillion dollar market with fewer than five or major major

186
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:03,480
players who doesn't want to give us too much information because he thinks he could actually

187
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:05,600
kind of get fired for even talking to us about this.

188
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:10,440
But he says the thing that I can't get away from is that my boss can fire me whenever

189
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:11,940
they like for any reason.

190
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:16,500
And they conclude with other huge corporations to limit the opportunities if we quit.

191
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:18,640
But I can't make them bargain collectively.

192
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:22,800
I can't even take them to court or really do anything other than individual arbitration.

193
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,360
And good luck with that.

194
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:28,440
I hope you can forgive me, but I'm a little exhausted by being asked to see these things

195
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:31,360
from the business owner's point of view.

196
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:38,480
He also joked that he was told by a by a younger dev recently that an iOS code base was so

197
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:42,200
old because it contained Objective C code.

198
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:49,800
Well if your younger dev needs a old, wrinkled, experienced hand, you know where to go.

199
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:51,940
Let's just forget about the core issue you emailed about.

200
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:56,160
Let's talk about that Objective C project.

201
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:59,760
Charlie wrote in saying, you know, I actually appreciate the comments recently.

202
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:02,480
The small business point of view needs to be heard.

203
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:07,080
And I don't think you guys should be shy or apologize for doing it.

204
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:10,440
I mean, I appreciate at least that as well.

205
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:13,800
And like the point you made last week, too, is that you and I are such in a different

206
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:17,480
world than, you know, these oil companies or these huge tech companies.

207
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:18,720
It's just a totally different thing.

208
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,680
You and I agonize over the purchase of a laptop.

209
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:23,080
Well, OK, you agonize over the purchase of a laptop.

210
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:25,880
I just simply accidentally destroy one and get a new one.

211
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:30,080
All right, well, let's see if we can't help out a listener.

212
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:33,120
So David is tempted to make a career jump, but wants to get our take first.

213
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:35,560
He says, I'm based in Scotland, and it's horrible.

214
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:39,400
And I've been working as a mixed sysadmin network engineer role in numerous companies

215
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:41,280
over the past decade.

216
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:45,200
Where I can, though, I've been moving to automate things as much as possible.

217
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:48,840
And don't get me wrong, the current company I'm with is totally on board with me doing

218
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:49,840
that.

219
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:53,160
And they'll give me the time that they can, but eventually things always keep slipping

220
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:56,600
back to the old ways of managing the infrastructure.

221
00:11:56,600 --> 00:12:00,040
And it very much is one of those the company views that is pay the bills first and then

222
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:02,480
do the automation stuff secondly.

223
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:07,560
However, reflecting on what I want these days and why I wrote this in, it's increasingly

224
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:11,000
evident to me that I want to write automation and infrastructure to the point of doing it

225
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
full time.

226
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,920
I've always been this way, and I guess this sits somewhere between the different roles

227
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:18,040
that I have now, unfortunately.

228
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:21,680
Do you think maybe there's just an element of me looking over at the grass and seeing

229
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:23,320
it greener over there?

230
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:26,820
Am I just going to enter into a whole other world of pain?

231
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:30,320
Or maybe it's time to move into a role that ticks these boxes for me.

232
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:31,320
What do you guys think?

233
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:32,320
P.S.

234
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:35,720
I didn't order a robe, and I'm sort of regretting it for the coming winter months.

235
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:36,720
Cheers, David.

236
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:37,720
Well, you should regret it.

237
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:39,360
I just hate to break it to you, David.

238
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:42,880
The robes is sometimes I just lay on the couch in my robe.

239
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:43,880
It's glorious.

240
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:48,560
Thinking about how I could ever have survived without my Coderradio limited edition robe.

241
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,840
You weren't living until you had the robe, I understand.

242
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:52,400
No, there was no life.

243
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:54,440
So he has got a couple of questions in there.

244
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:57,260
Yeah, you are just asking for another world of pain.

245
00:12:57,260 --> 00:12:58,720
No doubt about it.

246
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:00,160
Doesn't necessarily mean it's bad pain.

247
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:05,840
I mean, sometimes learning and just grinding through the process of doing things wrong

248
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:09,840
and then figuring out the right way to do it is slightly painful, but I guess this is

249
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:12,760
one of those times where no pain, no gain kind of applies.

250
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:16,800
What do you think about this idea, though, of throwing out the perfectly good pain job

251
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:21,760
that doesn't quite satisfy you and switching it up, going out into the job market and finding

252
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:24,560
something in an area that you don't have much experience with?

253
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:27,480
I would definitely find that new role first, right?

254
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:29,080
But no, I don't know.

255
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:31,560
Growth is painful, but growth is ultimately good.

256
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:36,320
If David, you really feel strong about this and if you felt this way for some time, right,

257
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:41,320
not like a weekend whim or something, then why don't you just, you know, poke around,

258
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:42,320
see if you can get something.

259
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:43,320
Yeah.

260
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:44,760
Obviously, you need to make it work financially for you.

261
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:48,920
So yeah, you don't want to take a huge pay cut, I get it.

262
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:49,920
But who knows?

263
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:50,920
Maybe you'll make more.

264
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:51,920
Maybe.

265
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:55,480
I don't know exactly what, you know, what your situation is, but I would at least do

266
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:57,840
the research and dip my toe in a little.

267
00:13:57,840 --> 00:14:01,440
And I wonder if David, if you're not miserable, because, you know, sometimes people write

268
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:05,760
us in and they're really at the point of they've already been burnt out for a really long time

269
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:08,520
and so they need to take immediate action.

270
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:14,480
If you are not feeling that way, if you could build yourself an off ramp, you might consider

271
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:20,160
looking at like a year plan where you end up doing a little bit of this on the side

272
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:21,300
as a project.

273
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:27,500
Maybe you donate time to a local business, a local cause, a church, an open source project.

274
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:32,640
You build something yourself and you get yourself in a position where you actually have a little

275
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:36,880
bit of skin in that game where, you know, your mistakes actually matter a little bit,

276
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:39,920
but you're not going to lose your job, obviously, because this is a side thing.

277
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:43,880
And see if you can't build and cultivate that for a year, because not only will that give

278
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:47,560
you an opportunity to scratch the edge immediately and let you test to see if you really like

279
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:50,760
it, but you're also going to network during that time.

280
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:56,960
And you may end up through that process finding a connection that secures you a job that allows

281
00:14:56,960 --> 00:15:01,060
you to transition cleanly without missing a paycheck.

282
00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:03,560
And that, I think, would be a real nice route to go.

283
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:08,680
And infrastructure management is one of those things that's hard to get your foot in the

284
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:11,320
door and say, hey, can I manage your infrastructure?

285
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:13,200
But man, is it needed out there?

286
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:19,160
David, it is desperately needed by so many developers who are so tapped out just keeping

287
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:24,480
up with their project, responding to user requests, let alone managing their infrastructure.

288
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:28,800
And both Mike and I are big advocates these days of bringing as much as your infrastructure

289
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:33,480
in-house as you can, own as much of that as you can, because at the end of the day, you

290
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:37,160
have to control that platform the best you can for the long-term sustainability of your

291
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:38,220
product.

292
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:40,320
And that means people need your help.

293
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:44,040
Deploying infrastructure as code is absolutely the way people should be doing it now.

294
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:46,560
And there's also a ton of people who need to transition.

295
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:52,800
And it sounds like your traditional sysadmin background and your interest in automation

296
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:59,200
means you may have a nice specialty in transitioning folks into new infrastructure as code.

297
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:00,920
I don't know, setups.

298
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:04,460
And that's actually a pretty nice specialty, because there's a ton of people interested

299
00:16:04,460 --> 00:16:06,300
in doing that right now.

300
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:07,880
So I'd say play with the idea.

301
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:10,240
Build yourself a year roadmap if you can.

302
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:12,520
And if you can't, ask yourself if you're OK with six months.

303
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:14,160
See if you can condense it.

304
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:18,440
Set the time frame that makes sense for you, and perhaps go about it that route.

305
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:22,840
And you may find that if you do a little side thing, that's enough that you can stay at

306
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:24,000
the current job.

307
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:28,800
Or you may find that you absolutely are consumed by it, and it builds into some serious momentum.

308
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:31,600
Either way, David, let us know what happens.

309
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:34,860
And if you out there have any questions or you want to get some free consulting or advice

310
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:41,680
from the show, go to coder.show slash contact and tap Mr. Dominic's years of wisdom right

311
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:44,660
here on the show and makes content for us.

312
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:50,680
So you get a little, we get a little, and we like that.

313
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:52,440
Linode.com slash coder.

314
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:55,460
That's where I host my infrastructure.

315
00:16:55,460 --> 00:17:00,520
More than ever am I grateful for Linode because I've got one box on premise and it crashed

316
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:01,520
recently.

317
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:04,340
I knew it was looking a little shaky.

318
00:17:04,340 --> 00:17:08,880
So I built backup infrastructure on Linode and I just shut the box off and I thought,

319
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:13,600
well, if it's necessary, I'll power it up, I'll point the DNS and I'll be good to go.

320
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:17,180
And sure enough, that is exactly what happened while I was traveling.

321
00:17:17,180 --> 00:17:18,180
Go figure.

322
00:17:18,180 --> 00:17:23,120
And I am so grateful that Linode has a powerful DNS manager that makes it really simple for

323
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:25,000
me to take care of this stuff.

324
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:30,160
And they have a dashboard that really makes all these kinds of tasks quick and straightforward.

325
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:32,760
When you pop in, you get to see a list of all your Linodes.

326
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:36,740
You go in there, you get an overview of its performance, the kind of transfer it's doing.

327
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:41,400
And also they set up some really sensible alerts to automatically ping you if things

328
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:42,400
are a little odd.

329
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:47,320
Like if one of our boxes is just like really busy network wise, sending a lot of traffic

330
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:52,100
inbound or outbound that goes outside the norm, they'll generate an email alert to me.

331
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:55,240
And man, I can't tell you how useful that is because that's usually a sign something

332
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:56,720
is going on.

333
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:59,720
And it's just a small thing, but it makes all of the difference.

334
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:01,560
Plus, they have super fast networking.

335
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:03,320
They have 11 data centers around the world.

336
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:06,680
So you're going to pick something that's either close to you or close to your customer or

337
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:08,540
whatever it is you're looking for.

338
00:18:08,540 --> 00:18:10,640
And they have Kubernetes support and Terraform support.

339
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:14,480
So if you are doing infrastructure by code, you can absolutely make Linode and manage

340
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:16,000
Linode with part of that.

341
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,480
It's just fantastic.

342
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:21,200
And then on top of all of that, they're now offering bare metal servers if your application

343
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,320
load requires something like that.

344
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:27,800
They have S3 compatible object storage, which is so great for back end storage for your

345
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:32,400
application or like for us, we use it for Nextcloud, which allows our team to not worry

346
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:36,320
about constantly checking the free space on the server all the time.

347
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:37,320
It just grows with us.

348
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:40,920
And then we go through about every six months and say, OK, what needs to stay?

349
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:41,920
What needs to get archived?

350
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:44,080
And it is so smooth.

351
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:45,680
And the performance is fantastic, too.

352
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:49,200
So really, it's just one of those things where you've got to go try it out for yourself.

353
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,760
Linode is dedicated to offering the best in virtualized cloud computing.

354
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:55,680
If it runs on Linux, it's going to run great on Linode, but I'd like you to go experience

355
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:56,680
for yourself.

356
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:58,840
And Linode is pretty confident you're going to like it.

357
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:01,320
That's why they're offering a hundred dollars.

358
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:02,320
One hundies.

359
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:04,360
So go to linode.com slash coder.

360
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:07,160
Get that $100 60 day credit on your new Linode account.

361
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:14,280
And of course, you support the gosh darn show, linode.com slash coder.

362
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:18,800
So we have been on and off on the show talking about fast API.

363
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:19,800
I don't know.

364
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:23,200
Really, I mean, since you and Wes first talked about it a couple of years ago, it seems like

365
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:26,640
at this point and it looks slick from what I understand.

366
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:31,200
It's a modern fast, really, I guess, overall, though I have not experienced it personally,

367
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:37,160
but they say high performance web framework for building APIs using Python, which of course

368
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:38,400
puts it right up your alley.

369
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:41,280
Yes, my snake charming continues.

370
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:43,880
So a couple of points on fast API, right?

371
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:49,880
So this new project I'm doing is in fast API and I've been writing just so much fast API

372
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:53,540
code and I love it.

373
00:19:53,540 --> 00:19:56,480
It's got a couple of things going for it.

374
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:59,160
It is, in fact, very, very fast.

375
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:06,160
The author, who's Sebastian Tiaglo, I hope I got that right, sorry, is aiming for node

376
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:08,000
JS and go like performance.

377
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,640
And this has been used by all kinds of people like Microsoft, the Microsoft guy quoted there

378
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:14,200
and Netflix, Uber, the whole bit.

379
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:20,000
It automatically built into the box that generates documentation to your method calls or as Rails

380
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,460
people might call them routes with open API.

381
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:24,800
They're very good looking docs.

382
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:27,500
If you've ever heard of Swagger, open API is the new name for Swagger.

383
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:29,280
So that kind of thing.

384
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:34,920
It is Python 3.6 and up only because it leans heavily on types, right?

385
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:41,840
Python has optional typing and it became more robust than 3.6.

386
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:45,120
This is the thing that really gets me.

387
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:49,220
Out of the box, it is ready for async IO and asynchronous programming.

388
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:53,880
So it's not like with Flask you can do async, but you kind of have to bolt it on.

389
00:20:53,880 --> 00:21:00,320
With this, it's right out of the box and that has made things just a lot easier to reason

390
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:01,320
about, a lot simpler.

391
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:02,360
I am loving it.

392
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:07,840
Async IO is a great implementation of like the await, async await pattern and asynchronous

393
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:08,840
programming in general.

394
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:09,840
FastAPI does a great job.

395
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:14,120
It's actually built on a framework called Starlet, which is another kind of web framework,

396
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:18,920
but FastAPI, he describes it as Starlet on steroids.

397
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:24,440
This data handling is also built on Pydantic, which I haven't done a lot of direct Pydantic

398
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:30,080
without FastAPI, but it's basically ensuring your types are correct and a bunch of other

399
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,080
more advanced stuff.

400
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:33,800
I feel like I'm selling it short.

401
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:40,760
For like quality of life stuff, great Visual Studio Code support via PyLance, great PyCharm

402
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:41,760
support.

403
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:46,100
I didn't put this in the doc, but the same author has something someone wrote in a couple

404
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:52,440
of weeks ago, SQL model, which actually solves my problem of SQL alchemy models, not when

405
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:56,280
you do the dot, not having the IntelliSense for the options.

406
00:21:56,280 --> 00:22:00,040
That's very nice because it's a kind of like an abstraction over SQL alchemy.

407
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:03,200
I am not using that in this project because I just didn't want to change too many things

408
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:09,860
at once, but you can intermingle it so I could see myself transitioning to it in the future.

409
00:22:09,860 --> 00:22:13,300
Also if you're now doing web development or service side development, but need a command

410
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:19,720
line app, he wrote something called Typer, which is effectively FastAPI for the command

411
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:20,720
line.

412
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:21,720
Slick.

413
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:24,600
Man, this sounds perfect for your kind of work.

414
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:26,160
This is right up your alley.

415
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:28,040
This is, yeah, this is really nice.

416
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:34,400
I have to imagine this must make getting started a lot faster too because it seems like a lot

417
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:36,960
of the things that you would bolt together are baked in.

418
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:41,800
Some of it's by virtue of being just focusing on super modern Python features, it really

419
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:46,000
is giving you a lot of the best practices of a modern Python developer right from the

420
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,000
jump.

421
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:50,560
So when you start, you immediately have async IO and you don't have to worry about it.

422
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:51,560
Right, I follow.

423
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:56,520
Of course you could use it with other frameworks, but having this framework actually built to

424
00:22:56,520 --> 00:23:03,800
use it as a first class way of doing development asynchronous programming is a big difference

425
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:06,120
than say bolting it on to a different framework.

426
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:11,600
Yeah, especially when you're building a product on top of this, you're going to build something

427
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:16,880
that you sell to customers and they're going to have expectations of maintainability, etc.

428
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:17,880
Absolutely.

429
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:25,760
And if you've done like a flask, it's very much in the flask kind of philosophy of giving

430
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:29,120
you enough to get started, but you can kind of design your own project, right?

431
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:33,640
I would say we're like Django for folks who know Ruby, Django was like the Ruby on Rails

432
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:37,000
equivalent, very opinionated, very big.

433
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:40,240
This is more like a Sinatra right on the Ruby side.

434
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:44,520
So this is a new love, you know, this sounds like you've fallen in love with a new tool.

435
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:46,640
Well, I've been using it on the DL a lot.

436
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:52,080
I mean, if you follow me on Twitter, I've actually been tweeting my 100 days of code

437
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:56,880
because I love annoying hashtags are almost all this fast API projects.

438
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:58,920
So I did see some of that go by.

439
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:03,020
That's why I kind of knew you were sniffing around in this stuff.

440
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:08,000
But it seems like to me, like a unique opportunity for a guy like you to have a tool like this

441
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:12,760
that this is just so already in the direction your business was going.

442
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:18,400
And now you've kind of got this to build on top of for the product you're working on now,

443
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:20,320
but also future products.

444
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:23,160
You could kind of I guess where I'm going with this is you could kind of pivot a lot

445
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:26,240
of a lot of your team to stuff like this.

446
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:30,800
How have you have you thought about what it would be like to have other others or maybe

447
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:31,800
you've already thought about this?

448
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:35,600
Have others joined Mad Botter or have people on the team that would start developing with

449
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:36,600
fast API?

450
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:39,040
Is this something you've thought about like specializing in?

451
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:41,080
Is this something you've thought about just you're working on?

452
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:44,140
I'm curious to know what it looks like functionally from a business standpoint for how you guys

453
00:24:44,140 --> 00:24:45,140
are adopting it.

454
00:24:45,140 --> 00:24:50,080
Yeah, I mean, today, we were all working on the upcoming product and we were all working

455
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:51,240
in fast API.

456
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:54,560
So it's actually helped with standardization, right?

457
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:55,960
Because it is Python.

458
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:58,440
So we're all using VS code with the same plugins.

459
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:02,960
We can do the VS code live share, which if anybody has it doesn't know what that is.

460
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:07,440
It's like a super screen share for coding where you can like you have all your own setup.

461
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:08,440
It's really nice.

462
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:09,600
You should check it out.

463
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:14,440
I would probably say to going forward any kind of client work that would be a new client

464
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:19,240
or a new project that needs a back end, which is all of it, right?

465
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:25,600
I would probably push pretty aggressively to have it done in fast API if it's in Python.

466
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:29,600
Now can you give us a hint of what you're building now using fast API?

467
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:30,600
Can you say?

468
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:31,600
Do you want to say?

469
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:33,360
Yeah, I can give a hint because I tweeted about it.

470
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:39,120
I am using Slack and sockets with fast API and a lot of async goodness.

471
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:42,520
Like a little messaging, something gets done, you send a message to Slack kind of thing,

472
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:43,520
huh?

473
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:45,200
There is a lot of messaging happening.

474
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:46,200
Yeah.

475
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:47,200
Yeah.

476
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:48,200
Okay.

477
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:49,200
That's great.

478
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:52,920
Well, I look forward to hearing more about it.

479
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:54,440
The mid-October can't come soon enough.

480
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:55,440
Yeah.

481
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:57,200
Well, I'm hoping to have it done that Monday before the 15th.

482
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:58,760
But you know how that goes.

483
00:25:58,760 --> 00:25:59,760
Yeah, I do.

484
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:00,760
Yeah, I do.

485
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:02,240
Well, we'll have a link in the show notes.

486
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:05,360
And then you know what we should do at some point is we should have Wes come back on.

487
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:06,360
Yes.

488
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:11,040
And you guys can geek out on fast API since I know he was an advocate of it early on.

489
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:12,640
And then it's a good excuse to have Wes on too.

490
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:14,360
Yeah, he's the one who turned me on to it.

491
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:15,360
So thank you, Wes.

492
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:16,360
Yeah, I'll twist his.

493
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:19,440
I see him in the chat room right now, so I got my eye on you, Wes.

494
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:20,440
Any other notes on that?

495
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:21,440
No.

496
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:25,800
I mean, I probably in the coming weeks will dive a little deeper into maybe SQL model.

497
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:34,240
Let me know in the chat room plus in the feedback if people are interested in that, but yeah.

498
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:37,480
Well then, this episode right here, yeah, it's brought to you by Datadog.

499
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:40,720
Go to datadog.com slash coder radio.

500
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:45,520
Datadog is the monitoring and security platform for developers, yes, security specialists,

501
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:48,120
operation teams, anyone that's working in the cloud age.

502
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:52,400
You can unify your metrics, your traces and logs all into one place and troubleshoot issues

503
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:57,520
faster, and you can break down your silos and communicate better between teams.

504
00:26:57,520 --> 00:27:02,000
You create real time, beautiful dashboards with over 450 different technology integrations

505
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,480
in just minutes.

506
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:08,900
You can pivot from high level overviews of your environment to granular visualizations

507
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:10,160
of metrics and events.

508
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:14,960
I mean, I'd encourage you to go check it out because they nail these dashboards.

509
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:15,960
They're beautiful.

510
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:18,620
So go to datadog.com slash coder radio.

511
00:27:18,620 --> 00:27:19,620
Go sign up.

512
00:27:19,620 --> 00:27:22,760
They have a free trial, and if you create one dashboard, you're gonna get a free t-shirt

513
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:24,300
as well, which is awesome.

514
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:28,440
And Datadog has infrastructure monitoring, security monitoring, real user monitoring,

515
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:30,720
and more all in one place.

516
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:35,360
So go get started, datadog.com slash coder radio, and see what I've been talking about.

517
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:37,680
They are the ultimate monitoring solution.

518
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:42,320
Go see why thousands of companies and tons of people in the Coder Radio audience trust

519
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:44,180
their monitoring to Datadog.

520
00:27:44,180 --> 00:27:48,120
And then, if you do create that free trial and one dashboard, they're gonna send you

521
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:49,120
that free t-shirt.

522
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:54,200
Go to datadog.com slash coder radio.

523
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:58,600
So you found a book this week that is, I mean, it looks great.

524
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:01,680
It's called Street Coder, and I like it already.

525
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:03,080
I think it could have been our name.

526
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:04,080
Could have been.

527
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:05,080
You know, that could have, we should have thought of this.

528
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:06,080
We should have thought of this, yeah.

529
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:07,080
13 years ago.

530
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:08,080
Yeah.

531
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:09,080
Dang it.

532
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:12,800
So, you know, we said we wouldn't answer, like, the basic, like, what should I learn

533
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:13,800
first?

534
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:14,800
Where should I study questions anymore?

535
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:19,880
And I read this book, and I feel like it's time to reopen that.

536
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:24,520
So I'm gonna butcher this guy's name, but it's Sadat Kapanoglu.

537
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:25,520
Kapan-glue?

538
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:26,520
We're gonna go with that.

539
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:27,520
Sorry.

540
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:28,520
Apologies.

541
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:29,520
I can't.

542
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:30,520
My pronunciations suck.

543
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:34,680
It is basically a, you know, both Street Coder.

544
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:40,360
It's like a field guide to the streets of coding, I guess, taking an extremely practical

545
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:41,360
point of view.

546
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:47,720
It's definitely a little opinionated, but I'm pretty impressed.

547
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:51,760
So for long, long, long time listeners, you might remember that I always recommend to

548
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:55,160
new developers, and still do, Mike Gunderloi's Coder to Developer.

549
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:56,160
It's a classic.

550
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:57,160
You can get it on Kindle.

551
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:58,160
I think it's like 12 bucks.

552
00:28:58,160 --> 00:28:59,160
It's great.

553
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:00,160
Enjoy.

554
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:04,800
Like, seriously, if you're new to the industry or in college, whatever, high school even,

555
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:05,800
you pick it up.

556
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:12,120
It's a little dated, because it's, god, it's 20 or 30 years old, but no, it's not more

557
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:13,840
than 20 years old.

558
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:14,840
Whatever.

559
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:15,840
It's a good read.

560
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:21,280
This is more, if I would almost say a more, lack of a better term, aggressive, aggressively

561
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:24,400
opinionated, and modern take on it.

562
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:33,100
Now he uses C Sharp and.NET as his, you know, his, like, intro.

563
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:40,060
But some of it's.NET specific, but more or less it's about how do you approach problems?

564
00:29:40,060 --> 00:29:42,000
What methodology should you be using?

565
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,040
Should you adhere too harshly to methodologies?

566
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:45,800
The answer's obviously no, right?

567
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:52,840
You know, finding that right balance between pragmatism and, you know, white tower closure

568
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:56,080
computer science that one was for US.

569
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:59,920
I think I'm going to put it as number two on my list.

570
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:03,320
Your new developer, recoder developer first.

571
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:07,960
And when you have about maybe six months experience, maybe even a year, because it's a little more

572
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:10,520
technical than coder to developer.

573
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:15,040
He makes a very strong argument, I'll just give an example here, for understanding how

574
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:18,960
like things like the CLR work at the low level.

575
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:23,340
And obviously if you're like a Java person, you know, the JVM.

576
00:30:23,340 --> 00:30:27,380
I am kind of swayed by his argument.

577
00:30:27,380 --> 00:30:28,380
It's a powerful book.

578
00:30:28,380 --> 00:30:30,000
It'll have you thinking.

579
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,080
I think I'm going to get it after the show.

580
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:36,480
The description on the web page is quote, an incredible book to learn the craft of software

581
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:38,960
development through a new perspective.

582
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:43,000
One that is not fueled by religion or blind following of best practices, but one that

583
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:48,280
actively challenges best practices and thus requires you to think about their pros and

584
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:49,280
cons.

585
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:50,280
That sounds great actually.

586
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:52,280
I'm going to pick it up.

587
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:55,640
They got an ebook for $27.99, that's probably money well spent.

588
00:30:55,640 --> 00:31:00,520
And you can get a print book for $34, but I think the ebook is probably fine.

589
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:03,400
And the code, there's code samples.

590
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:09,520
And again, the title was called Street Coder, which that's what we should call our members,

591
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:10,520
the Street Coders.

592
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:18,320
No, I like our QA team and we'll have a link in the show notes at coder.show slash 433

593
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:20,260
if you want to grab that.

594
00:31:20,260 --> 00:31:25,160
So there has been several studies that Stanford just did one, Connect Solutions just did

595
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:26,160
one.

596
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:27,800
The Wall Street Journal just did one.

597
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:34,380
And the studies pertain to does monitoring employee systems with like surveillance software

598
00:31:34,380 --> 00:31:36,760
actually make the staff more productive?

599
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:39,340
Does it impact morale, et cetera, et cetera.

600
00:31:39,340 --> 00:31:45,700
So Stanford study of 16,000 workers over a nine month period showed there was some performance

601
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:49,980
increase of around 13% when you monitor.

602
00:31:49,980 --> 00:31:54,000
But and this is interesting, it showed, and this I don't think is good for employees at

603
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,640
all.

604
00:31:55,640 --> 00:32:01,560
The biggest boost in productivity was actually with remote workers, a 77% of the improvement

605
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:08,120
was with remote workers, 30% indicated they do more work and less time when remote, and

606
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:12,980
then 24% doing more work during their work hours, but overall, we're more productive

607
00:32:12,980 --> 00:32:14,540
while remote.

608
00:32:14,540 --> 00:32:18,440
But the old adage that actually says, if I can't see what you're doing, you're not being

609
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:21,500
productive, I don't think actually holds up when you look at it.

610
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:24,400
Going through all these studies, and I have a link in the show notes because there's like

611
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:29,500
a page that sort of summarized them all, it really, all it does, it seems like employee

612
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:34,520
productivity monitoring at best will discover some workflow issues.

613
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:36,500
That's its best case scenario.

614
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:42,100
But really, it's about, it's generally more about like getting on people for the time

615
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:46,240
they're actually at work or the time they're working and not putting in a full eight hours

616
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:51,680
is like, predominantly the way it ends up getting used, and that has horrible impacts

617
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:58,240
on morale, it makes people view the company negatively, like, it's big impact.

618
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:03,320
And so I thought I want to ask you what your thoughts were if there is a place for employee

619
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:07,780
machine monitoring, because we already know employers feel where they, I guess, legally

620
00:33:07,780 --> 00:33:12,240
own the machines, they own all the content on there that gets created.

621
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:18,040
It feels to me like it is a step too far to do any kind of monitoring on these systems

622
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:19,040
at all.

623
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:22,740
And I've always resisted this and a lot of places I've gone into recently have done some

624
00:33:22,740 --> 00:33:24,920
kind of mandatory monitoring.

625
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:28,400
And I so far was able to avoid it always because my systems are running Linux.

626
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:33,320
But even as like a client contractor, coming into a land, they'll have like this antivirus

627
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:37,880
software that they would want me to install on my laptop that gives them full remote access

628
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:40,560
to installing software in my system.

629
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:41,680
Seems like a step too far, right?

630
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:45,880
I think I think it's not only a step too far, I think it's kind of idiotic.

631
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:50,300
If you are hiring people that you trust so little to actually do their job, you simply

632
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:51,640
shouldn't hire them.

633
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:54,920
And if you made the mistake of hiring someone like that, which happens, right, some, you

634
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:58,880
know, you hire people don't fit, whatever, you should just, you know, let them go as

635
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:01,580
quickly as possible and as humanely as possible.

636
00:34:01,580 --> 00:34:04,280
No one deserves to be treated like they're a prisoner at work.

637
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:05,280
That's ridiculous.

638
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:07,560
I mean, especially if they're working from home.

639
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:10,400
I don't know, I hate all this stuff.

640
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:13,000
Even you know, I could kind of see the antivirus thing.

641
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:17,520
But even then, most of those antivirus programs, as you suggested, are not just antivirus,

642
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:18,520
right?

643
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:21,600
Like, I could see a thing that's like, hey, dude, you downloaded this XE that we know

644
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:23,000
is bad.

645
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:27,400
Someone from IT is gonna call you and be like, yo, you got to run the scan or something.

646
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:36,160
But I really, really hate the idea of turning, you know, work into a surveillance state.

647
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:41,460
I think you should hire people that you trust, that are good fits for your organization.

648
00:34:41,460 --> 00:34:45,000
And it doesn't mean if someone's a bad fit for you, like, lots of people, I think I can

649
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:49,080
speak for you a little bit here are bad fits for JB and the Mad Botter, because we're super

650
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:50,080
small.

651
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:51,080
Yeah.

652
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:52,080
Right.

653
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:54,520
And that requires a certain type of personality, a certain type of person.

654
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:57,580
Very much, you know, you need self motivators.

655
00:34:57,580 --> 00:34:59,900
But they might be great at Microsoft, right?

656
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:02,720
So it's, it's, I hate this.

657
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:03,720
I completely agree.

658
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:05,520
But I'll just play devil's advocate.

659
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:12,000
What about an employee whose job it is to monitor and adjust the chemicals that are

660
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:15,760
going into the city water supply, I actually know the guy that does this here.

661
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:22,360
And like, they had somebody compromise their machine with a PC anywhere, and actually get

662
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:26,100
access and turn up the chemical solution.

663
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:29,240
But they caught it quick enough, because the guy actually saw the mouse moving around on

664
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:31,000
the screen.

665
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,880
And they set everything back.

666
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:37,680
And or I think about like, somebody who's working without some other hazardous material,

667
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:41,520
or perhaps a young employee, it's their very first job.

668
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:45,000
Is there a place for monitoring and tracking in those situations?

669
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:49,960
So you you laid out like, a couple different scenarios, the easiest one is the young employee.

670
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:50,960
The answer is no.

671
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:51,960
Right?

672
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:55,120
Like, if you're just hiring a young developer, and you know, it's no.

673
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:59,720
But sure, if you were like working on a nuclear missile silo, then one, those jobs have always

674
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:02,520
had monitoring, right?

675
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:04,240
That's a public safety issue, right?

676
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:09,440
So that, you know, going in that you're giving up certain, I mean, you're going to be monitored

677
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:10,880
with that kind of thing.

678
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:11,880
Yeah.

679
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:15,640
But that's not kind of that's not really what this, what this was all about, right?

680
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:17,120
This was about employers having anxiety.

681
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:20,920
I mean, let's be honest, a lot of organizations, a lot of managers have anxiety that people

682
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:25,440
working from home are just like walking their dogs and playing Uno with their kids, right?

683
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:26,920
That's what this is about it.

684
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:31,220
Although reviewing these different studies, it seems to show a pretty decent overall productivity

685
00:36:31,220 --> 00:36:32,220
boost for remote workers.

686
00:36:32,220 --> 00:36:33,760
Well, we've been talking about this for years, right?

687
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:40,120
I mean, I've been remote for a long time now you've been doing the remote thing.

688
00:36:40,120 --> 00:36:45,720
You know, there's an initial cost to setting it up in terms of like, process and procedures.

689
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:48,760
And having everybody agree that there will be standard hours that people need to be in

690
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:51,240
slack or teams or whatever you're using.

691
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:56,160
30% of respondents say that they did more work in less time when they work from home.

692
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:59,200
Yeah, of course, because you don't know how easy it is in the middle of the night, if

693
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:03,240
you work from home, that you were sleeping and like in your dreams, you know, Donald

694
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:06,300
Knuth came to you and told you how to fix that bug.

695
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:11,360
You just wake up, grab your MacBook Air, plug plug, or your system 76 Pangolin and you fix

696
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:12,660
the bug.

697
00:37:12,660 --> 00:37:16,360
You're also cutting out for better for worse, the hallway conversations, the you know, drive

698
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:20,480
by chats, like, for better or worse, you're cutting those out too and staying focused

699
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:21,480
more.

700
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:25,200
Yeah, and all that all that stuff, sure, camaraderie, team building, I kind of get that I think

701
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:26,480
you are losing that.

702
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:29,960
You know, how much time is wasted with like, gossip and

703
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:31,440
Yeah, true.

704
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:38,400
So back to the monitoring, I believe now that there are employee monitoring solutions for

705
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:43,440
the Mac that are just as unbelievably invasive as the Windows ones.

706
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:47,880
And it seems some of them even kind of try to capture information about your network,

707
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:52,080
like, you know, look at look at the other machines, other IP addresses that your machine

708
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:57,960
is aware of on the network, and kind of susses out like your overall network setup.

709
00:37:57,960 --> 00:38:02,840
To me, that seems like not only is this trend line going in the wrong direction, especially

710
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:10,760
when you add in the context of fair pay, but the technology is going to enable just more

711
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:11,960
and more and more.

712
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:14,960
In fact, we recently had a story.

713
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:18,080
I don't know if I can't remember if you and I decided to put in the show or not.

714
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:23,760
But we recently had a story that was these employers were mandating, in fact, Apple contracts

715
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:27,480
with one of them or was contracting with one of them until it went public, that the employers

716
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:31,460
were mandating always on webcams when you're working from home.

717
00:38:31,460 --> 00:38:35,880
Always on webcam, you're always get you always not just in a meeting, you always have the

718
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:42,680
video camera on, you're all up on a screen, the managers can check your video camera.

719
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:46,800
And they had to do it because of COVID they said, you know, you have to work from home,

720
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:47,960
but we have to be able to monitor you.

721
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:50,440
So because of COVID, we're going to do this.

722
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:52,440
It's literally their reasoning.

723
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:55,120
And I find it completely overreaching.

724
00:38:55,120 --> 00:39:01,160
And it seems like when you look at things like I, for example, why not why not take

725
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:06,320
it to one step further and have a companion app that not only is installed on your desktop,

726
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:11,520
but the companion app that's on your mobile device that's tracking your steps and your

727
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:12,520
location?

728
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:13,520
Why not?

729
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:16,960
Why not have them have you take a picture to check in in the morning with the front facing

730
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:19,760
camera on your phone so they can make sure you're in your home office?

731
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:20,760
Why not?

732
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:22,520
I mean, where do they draw the line?

733
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:25,200
Because it just seems like if they're going to do always on webcams, and they're going

734
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:29,760
to start monitoring, like your ARP cache, like, where do we draw the line on this?

735
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:35,560
They're just getting they have the argument that they're that they're, they own the machines.

736
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:38,800
And you need to check in, you know, you got to punch the clock, and we're now using this

737
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:42,200
new app to punch them on the clock, and you're going to get your picture taken at the same

738
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:43,200
time.

739
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:46,680
What's the difference if you're coming in and punching the clock on the wall?

740
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:48,080
Same thing, they'd say.

741
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:52,760
And I don't know how we even begin to fight back in this stuff.

742
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:57,600
And so it helps me connect with the people who are really upset about the fair pay stuff.

743
00:39:57,600 --> 00:40:02,160
Because it just seems like people are completely powerless to stop a trend line that is not

744
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:03,880
going in their direction.

745
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:05,640
I guess I agree with you.

746
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:10,000
But I mean, what is the problem these employers are solving?

747
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:14,520
I feel like it's a really like, kind of sad insecurity thing.

748
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:17,160
I'm not saying they're not doing it.

749
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:18,600
I'm just saying it's bad, right?

750
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:24,960
I haven't thought about it a lot from why I just assumed it would be a guaranteed accountability.

751
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:25,960
Right.

752
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:28,440
But isn't it more output that you should care about?

753
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:31,560
Well, yeah, clearly, but it doesn't seem to be the way it works, does it?

754
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:34,960
When we all had the office in New Jersey, it was be a problem.

755
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:35,960
And it was a problem.

756
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:37,520
If somebody is like blasting gangster rap, right?

757
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:40,120
You have neighbors, the language is inappropriate.

758
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:41,120
People could get offended.

759
00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:42,940
I don't want to get sued, right?

760
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:46,840
You can see me in or, you know, an employer intervening in that.

761
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:52,700
But if they're at home, and blasting, I know very little about rap, but blasting like Tupac

762
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:56,020
makes them a better developer.

763
00:40:56,020 --> 00:40:58,240
Maybe I want to buy them some Tupac albums, right?

764
00:40:58,240 --> 00:40:59,240
I don't know.

765
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:03,760
Like, you know, I hear you if I can get 5% more output, because we're listening to NWA,

766
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:08,620
then I'm, I'm probably going to be totally cool with that, because one, they're not disrupting

767
00:41:08,620 --> 00:41:09,620
their co workers.

768
00:41:09,620 --> 00:41:11,420
You know, they're doing it in the privacy of their home.

769
00:41:11,420 --> 00:41:13,600
And if they get a noise complaint, it's their problem.

770
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:16,240
And that's just a dumb example watching TV, right?

771
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:17,240
Watching something on an iPad.

772
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:22,300
Well, actually, no, the very first time I don't remember what job it was, it was so

773
00:41:22,300 --> 00:41:23,300
long ago now.

774
00:41:23,300 --> 00:41:27,380
But the very first time I had the opportunity to work from home, the first thing I did was

775
00:41:27,380 --> 00:41:30,580
blast my effing music, I rocked out while I work.

776
00:41:30,580 --> 00:41:31,760
So that's actually a good example.

777
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:37,420
Wes in the chat room says, check this out, Mike, he says that he had a buddy run nmap,

778
00:41:37,420 --> 00:41:39,820
you know, the port scanner on his home network.

779
00:41:39,820 --> 00:41:43,460
And then he had it check in with him to ask him if things were okay.

780
00:41:43,460 --> 00:41:47,900
He triggered it back at the corporate office by running nmap on his home network.

781
00:41:47,900 --> 00:41:48,900
Wow.

782
00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:49,900
Whoo.

783
00:41:49,900 --> 00:41:55,180
You know, like, that's, and I just wonder, I think, like, in a way, I think maybe we

784
00:41:55,180 --> 00:41:57,740
should tell people how to avoid this kind of stuff.

785
00:41:57,740 --> 00:42:01,480
Optimus Grace says he sets up a VLAN for his work laptop.

786
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:05,120
What I advise people do is they put their work laptops on guest Wi Fi.

787
00:42:05,120 --> 00:42:10,020
If your wireless access point supports creating a guest AP, that's that's a good tip.

788
00:42:10,020 --> 00:42:11,020
Yeah.

789
00:42:11,020 --> 00:42:14,340
Or set up a second, you know, access point, you and I are in a weird position, right?

790
00:42:14,340 --> 00:42:19,420
I can't imagine a scenario unless it was like something crazy, like the government, right?

791
00:42:19,420 --> 00:42:24,300
Where I would accept the job where part of the condition is, you get to spy on not just

792
00:42:24,300 --> 00:42:30,620
my, but like my whole family's network and traffic that seems, you know, right?

793
00:42:30,620 --> 00:42:34,700
Just, yeah, that's the thing at home, you know, wow, I hadn't even thought of that stupid

794
00:42:34,700 --> 00:42:35,700
me.

795
00:42:35,700 --> 00:42:36,700
Well, we both have kids, right?

796
00:42:36,700 --> 00:42:42,140
I mean, my, my son's very young, but I could see a world where there's some, you know, teenagers,

797
00:42:42,140 --> 00:42:43,140
right?

798
00:42:43,140 --> 00:42:48,060
Like some uncomfortable conversations with, with ID or HR because of that kind of thing.

799
00:42:48,060 --> 00:42:49,060
So.

800
00:42:49,060 --> 00:42:52,200
And then you have the, you have the employers who actually provide the entire router too,

801
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:55,660
because that's how their VPN solution works and that's how they have to have it.

802
00:42:55,660 --> 00:43:00,500
And oh man, yeah, it tell you what, I tell you what.

803
00:43:00,500 --> 00:43:06,860
You know, if that's you, then run a, run a VM and in that VM run a VPN, like do what

804
00:43:06,860 --> 00:43:07,860
you can.

805
00:43:07,860 --> 00:43:11,620
They're like, we've got to, I think we've got to push back in a way and, and, and break

806
00:43:11,620 --> 00:43:12,620
it technologically.

807
00:43:12,620 --> 00:43:14,620
Cause otherwise it's just, it's going to keep going and keep going.

808
00:43:14,620 --> 00:43:17,900
Well, and if your employer is going to spy on your internet traffic, shouldn't they pay

809
00:43:17,900 --> 00:43:19,220
for the connection?

810
00:43:19,220 --> 00:43:22,980
So at that point you could just, you buy your own laptop, you call spectrum or whoever your

811
00:43:22,980 --> 00:43:27,180
carrier is or your ISP is rather, and you just say, listen, I have one from my employer,

812
00:43:27,180 --> 00:43:28,180
but I want a second line.

813
00:43:28,180 --> 00:43:31,780
Well, I don't really want them burning my internet connection up with this extra metric

814
00:43:31,780 --> 00:43:32,780
stuff either.

815
00:43:32,780 --> 00:43:34,980
Like, yeah, that's, that's an interesting argument.

816
00:43:34,980 --> 00:43:35,980
Should they have to pay for that?

817
00:43:35,980 --> 00:43:41,140
I mean, yeah, especially when I'm on like mobile internet, like every bite counts literally.

818
00:43:41,140 --> 00:43:43,460
So just don't know about it.

819
00:43:43,460 --> 00:43:45,780
I would, I would probably try to firewall it off and stuff.

820
00:43:45,780 --> 00:43:48,620
I mean, it's all solvable between DNS and IP rules.

821
00:43:48,620 --> 00:43:52,600
You can probably block a lot of it, but you have to be, you have to be familiar with how

822
00:43:52,600 --> 00:43:54,020
to do that kind of stuff.

823
00:43:54,020 --> 00:43:58,140
And most people probably, you have to imagine all the people that got sent to do work from

824
00:43:58,140 --> 00:44:03,160
home, the vast, vast majority of them aren't even thinking about this kind of stuff.

825
00:44:03,160 --> 00:44:07,140
And it, you know, bringing it back to what you said at the beginning of the show, I have

826
00:44:07,140 --> 00:44:12,140
friends who have been bitten by this over and over and over again when they start a

827
00:44:12,140 --> 00:44:16,100
project or some night they decide to work on the work laptop because their home machine

828
00:44:16,100 --> 00:44:17,660
isn't working.

829
00:44:17,660 --> 00:44:22,060
And even if it's just a small part of a project that they spent using company resources to

830
00:44:22,060 --> 00:44:24,920
build, they'll come after you for it.

831
00:44:24,920 --> 00:44:27,620
And now they have more evidence than ever.

832
00:44:27,620 --> 00:44:31,780
Like they have such, they have so many different ways to track activity.

833
00:44:31,780 --> 00:44:34,780
It's just so, so dangerous and so risky.

834
00:44:34,780 --> 00:44:39,140
And so it really, it really is important that if you're going to ever work on a side project

835
00:44:39,140 --> 00:44:43,300
that you ever want to do outside the company and you don't want them to own it, you have,

836
00:44:43,300 --> 00:44:45,540
and I'm not advocating, maybe it's, maybe you're fine with them owning it.

837
00:44:45,540 --> 00:44:46,540
That's, that's great.

838
00:44:46,540 --> 00:44:47,900
That's maybe a good way to get ahead.

839
00:44:47,900 --> 00:44:51,540
But if you want to build something that they don't have any hooks into, you got to do it

840
00:44:51,540 --> 00:44:55,540
on your own time and on your own resources, no company resources.

841
00:44:55,540 --> 00:44:56,740
It's very, it's just critical.

842
00:44:56,740 --> 00:44:59,500
I have so many friends that have been burned by it.

843
00:44:59,500 --> 00:45:03,420
And you know what, the nice boss, one may not be your ultimate boss, but when there's

844
00:45:03,420 --> 00:45:05,420
money on the table, people get different.

845
00:45:05,420 --> 00:45:07,820
It's business, you know, for them.

846
00:45:07,820 --> 00:45:10,140
I want to thank our Coder QA team.

847
00:45:10,140 --> 00:45:14,020
You know, you are our core that keeps the show truly independent, that lets us be picky

848
00:45:14,020 --> 00:45:15,020
about our advertisers.

00:45:38,820 --> 00:45:42,180
It's like YouTube or Twitter, it's really easy to find them, they're just slash a cloud

857
00:45:42,180 --> 00:45:43,180
guru.

What about you, Mr. Dominic?

859
00:45:44,180 --> 00:45:45,460
Can people find you on the Twitter?

860
00:45:45,460 --> 00:45:51,380
Yeah, at Dumanuco on Twitter, and I'm going to be doing some crazy Python stuff.
