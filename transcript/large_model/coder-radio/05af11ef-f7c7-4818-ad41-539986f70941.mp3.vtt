00:00.000 --> 00:15.800
This is KOTORadio, episode 422 for July 12th, 2021.

00:15.800 --> 00:20.160
Hello friend and welcome in to Jupiter Broadcasting's weekly talk show, taking a pragmatic look

00:20.160 --> 00:24.760
at the art and the business of software development and the world of technology.

00:24.760 --> 00:26.500
This episode is brought to you by Cloud Guru.

00:26.500 --> 00:32.120
You know Cloud Guru has that cloud playground, Azure, AWS, or Google in their sandboxes on

00:32.120 --> 00:34.720
their credit card, not on yours.

00:34.720 --> 00:38.440

00:38.440 --> 00:42.640
My name is Chris, but that don't matter because joining us like every single week is our host,

00:42.640 --> 00:46.520
it's Mr. Dominic for a little bit longer from the Sunshine State.

00:46.520 --> 00:47.520
Hello Mike.

00:47.520 --> 00:48.520
Thank you for calling Florida.

00:48.520 --> 00:52.200
We've got a Gator, we've got some IPAs.

00:52.200 --> 00:53.200
I'm going to miss it.

00:53.200 --> 00:54.200
You're going to miss it?

00:54.200 --> 00:55.200
I'm going to miss it.

00:55.200 --> 00:57.000
We've got the Stanley Cup again.

00:57.000 --> 01:00.840
You know, there's something fun about you being our Florida guy, but when you go to

01:00.840 --> 01:03.920
Jersey now, man, you know, Jersey's scary.

01:03.920 --> 01:04.920
I don't know.

01:04.920 --> 01:08.360
You know, like one, one time I was just driving along and I looked over there and I think

01:08.360 --> 01:10.720
I saw some guy getting murdered just like from the road.

01:10.720 --> 01:12.000
Like it was bad, man.

01:12.000 --> 01:13.000
Oh, absolutely.

01:13.000 --> 01:16.400
Every exit on the parkway, there's a guy getting shot in the back of the head, execution style.

01:16.400 --> 01:17.400
Yeah.

01:17.400 --> 01:18.400
The polite thing to do is to wave.

01:18.400 --> 01:22.400
Just yeah, keep about, keep going on about your business.

01:22.400 --> 01:23.400
Don't mind me.

01:23.400 --> 01:26.820
We can do a, you know, an AB test real quick.

01:26.820 --> 01:31.840
So the app store in Florida is, oh, bless your heart.

01:31.840 --> 01:32.840
I'm sorry.

01:32.840 --> 01:33.840
We can't accept your app.

01:33.840 --> 01:38.080
In New Jersey it's, it's a nice app you got there.

01:38.080 --> 01:39.760
Fortunately we had a problem.

01:39.760 --> 01:43.280
We're going to need a 30% and we're going to come by every week.

01:43.280 --> 01:48.320
I'm going to get a 30% we're going to need a $99 minimum a year.

01:48.320 --> 01:49.320
Okay.

01:49.320 --> 01:50.320
Capisce?

01:50.320 --> 01:51.840
And if the rules change, screw you.

01:51.840 --> 01:52.840
Pay us.

01:52.840 --> 01:53.840
Okay.

01:53.840 --> 01:56.440
Listen, you want to have a sit down?

01:56.440 --> 01:57.880
Well we don't answer the phone.

01:57.880 --> 01:58.880
Good luck.

01:58.880 --> 01:59.880
Business.

01:59.880 --> 02:00.880
Yeah.

02:00.880 --> 02:05.840
So, um, what are you trying to make sure that I don't catch up to you?

02:05.840 --> 02:07.080
Is that what you're trying to do over there?

02:07.080 --> 02:10.960
Like I come on the air and tell you about my big old 17 gallon accident of water spilling

02:10.960 --> 02:13.880
all over my electronics and you're like, hold my beer.

02:13.880 --> 02:18.960
The worst part was, you know, there've been some jokes about perhaps certain spirits have

02:18.960 --> 02:20.240
flown into Mac books.

02:20.240 --> 02:21.240
Sure.

02:21.240 --> 02:23.360
I was actually asleep.

02:23.360 --> 02:25.920
It was actually water.

02:25.920 --> 02:29.240
And let this be a lesson to you kids about having your nightstand way too close to your

02:29.240 --> 02:30.520
bed and coding at night.

02:30.520 --> 02:31.520
Oh, what happened?

02:31.520 --> 02:32.520
I thought I was clever.

02:32.520 --> 02:36.280
I was on my Lenovo X1 carbon, which I cannot recommend enough, by the way, if you're looking

02:36.280 --> 02:37.540
for a windows machine.

02:37.540 --> 02:41.860
And I believe, and folks in the chat will correct me, but I believe the carbon is one

02:41.860 --> 02:45.480
of the fedora certified ones, right?

02:45.480 --> 02:46.480
That's the one I got.

02:46.480 --> 02:47.480
All right.

02:47.480 --> 02:50.880
So I have, I have the windows version cause I'm, I was, I'm ironically, I don't need another

02:50.880 --> 02:56.140
windows machine, but I'm on a windows project doing terrible things that I'm sad about because

02:56.140 --> 02:58.320
they almost just whatever.

02:58.320 --> 02:59.320
But you know, I'm coding at night.

02:59.320 --> 03:02.100
I'm trying to catch up five year old schools out.

03:02.100 --> 03:04.880
You can imagine that I do a lot of work at night.

03:04.880 --> 03:05.880
Yeah.

03:05.880 --> 03:06.880
So I'm getting tired.

03:06.880 --> 03:07.880
I'm in bed.

03:07.880 --> 03:10.320
I'm a little too lazy to go back into the other room.

03:10.320 --> 03:15.320
So I'm like, okay, let me just close the laptop up, put it between the bed and the nightstand,

03:15.320 --> 03:16.320
right?

03:16.320 --> 03:18.120
There's a little gap there, a little negative space.

03:18.120 --> 03:22.040
And I have my glass of water cause I go to, I mean, this is way too inside Mike's bedroom.

03:22.040 --> 03:24.960
Although the coder leader, I'm picturing it though.

03:24.960 --> 03:25.960
Picture it.

03:25.960 --> 03:26.960
Yeah.

03:26.960 --> 03:27.960
I have my Valeri.

03:27.960 --> 03:28.960
Are you wearing, are you wearing?

03:28.960 --> 03:29.960
Yeah.

03:29.960 --> 03:30.960
Okay.

03:30.960 --> 03:31.960
Tell me, go ahead.

03:31.960 --> 03:32.960
My, my coder robe, right?

03:32.960 --> 03:33.960
Of course.

03:33.960 --> 03:34.960
Smoking a pipe.

03:34.960 --> 03:37.040
Do you have like one of those little silk caps?

03:37.040 --> 03:40.720
I do not, but I should, that's a, that's a great addition actually.

03:40.720 --> 03:41.720
Yeah.

03:41.720 --> 03:46.480
So, you know, I have my, my sleepy time tea and I was careful to move the tea away from

03:46.480 --> 03:51.440
the edge of the nightstand thinking that the small cup of tea was the biggest threat.

03:51.440 --> 03:57.560
Not the giant Linux 400 stein of water, no, no.

03:57.560 --> 03:58.560
I love it.

03:58.560 --> 03:59.980
I'm glad it was the stein though.

03:59.980 --> 04:06.160
This was a very JB on brand destruction of a Lenovo laptop.

04:06.160 --> 04:07.800
Everybody tells me you could spill water on these things.

04:07.800 --> 04:08.800
They got drain holes in them.

04:08.800 --> 04:09.800
They tell me.

04:09.800 --> 04:13.520
Well, not if they're sideways and the water goes directly into the Thunderbolt ports.

04:13.520 --> 04:14.520
Oh yeah.

04:14.520 --> 04:15.520
Yeah.

04:15.520 --> 04:19.720
You know, it was a, I turned it on and it, it, the fan feebly tried to kick up and it

04:19.720 --> 04:25.160
made the screech and it, and it, after even a day in a giant bowl of rice, never, it's,

04:25.160 --> 04:26.160
it's done.

04:26.160 --> 04:27.160
Yeah.

04:27.160 --> 04:29.000
And you know, they have all those little water sensors in there now where they can see if

04:29.000 --> 04:30.000
I got wet.

04:30.000 --> 04:32.360
So they know, they know.

04:32.360 --> 04:36.400
Actually if you read the patent, those are called Mike sensors.

04:36.400 --> 04:37.400
So now what?

04:37.400 --> 04:38.400
Now what are you going to do?

04:38.400 --> 04:43.040
Uh, nothing until I get to New Jersey cause yeah, listen, I can't survive going to sleep.

04:43.040 --> 04:45.760
How do you think transit is for me?

04:45.760 --> 04:46.760
Yeah.

04:46.760 --> 04:50.720
I just wonder, are you going to do another X one or are you going to try something else?

04:50.720 --> 04:52.880
It's an opportunity to try another rig.

04:52.880 --> 04:55.820
I mean, it's not a great opportunity, but it's an opportunity.

04:55.820 --> 04:56.820
I was thinking of it.

04:56.820 --> 04:58.520
I was thinking of trying an XPS again.

04:58.520 --> 05:04.440
I haven't had an XPS in four or five years, but see the thing with the XPS is I would

05:04.440 --> 05:06.960
be tempted to try the Sputnik edition.

05:06.960 --> 05:07.960
Why not dual boot?

05:07.960 --> 05:08.960
Yeah.

05:08.960 --> 05:10.440
Cause I'm not going to pay the stupid prices for the storage.

05:10.440 --> 05:14.560
The other thing is I was looking at laptops right now, the prices are on crack.

05:14.560 --> 05:17.400
Oh, are they because of all the supply issues or something?

05:17.400 --> 05:18.400
Yeah.

05:18.400 --> 05:21.720
If you want anything that's like not like mid range, if you want something nice, which

05:21.720 --> 05:26.160
I don't know why I would cause they only last four weeks, but um.

05:26.160 --> 05:27.800
Really at this point you should just be buying Chromebooks.

05:27.800 --> 05:28.800
Let's be honest.

05:28.800 --> 05:33.000
You know, I just, I got to put it up, but I just talked to the folks from shells on

05:33.000 --> 05:37.680
the Mike Dominic show and that seems like the ideal situation for me, a Chromebook and

05:37.680 --> 05:40.640
just a bunch of VMs running around in the cloud.

05:40.640 --> 05:41.640
Yeah.

05:41.640 --> 05:44.600
You got to wonder or even a tablet, you know, uh, it seems like that could be another route

05:44.600 --> 05:45.600
to go.

05:45.600 --> 05:46.600
Yeah.

05:46.600 --> 05:49.700
An iPad, iPad pro with like a nice keyboard, but um, although now I'm a crack head for

05:49.700 --> 05:50.700
my launch keyboard.

05:50.700 --> 05:51.700
So.

05:51.700 --> 05:52.700
Oh yeah.

05:52.700 --> 05:55.200
I still feel and I paid full price.

05:55.200 --> 05:57.920
I still feel the launch keyboard is the best keyboard I've ever owned.

05:57.920 --> 05:58.920
Yeah.

05:58.920 --> 06:01.080
I also paid full price last night though.

06:01.080 --> 06:02.080
Could not sleep.

06:02.080 --> 06:06.920
I have this problem where if I fall asleep and then get woken up within about 20, 30

06:06.920 --> 06:10.400
minutes of falling asleep, I do not fall asleep again for the rest of the night.

06:10.400 --> 06:13.800
I don't know if anybody else has this problem and if you figured out how to solve it, let

06:13.800 --> 06:14.800
me know.

06:14.800 --> 06:17.280
But like after two hours, it's just two and a half hours of just laying there.

06:17.280 --> 06:23.360
I just gave up and I got up to work, but I grabbed the iPad and I brought up, I think

06:23.360 --> 06:31.080
it's Termulus on there and um, SSH into my server and just spent the evening over a wire

06:31.080 --> 06:36.720
guard connection, SSH into a server here at the studio, building out a website.

06:36.720 --> 06:37.840
And it was great.

06:37.840 --> 06:43.080
It just struck me like the, I really liked the, uh, the new multitasking stuff that's

06:43.080 --> 06:47.220
in iOS 15 because I had, I had a couple of windows up.

06:47.220 --> 06:51.400
I was checking a guide while also switching over to the terminal.

06:51.400 --> 06:56.280
And I kind of feel like they've made some substantive improvements in iOS 15 on the

06:56.280 --> 06:58.860
iPad in terms of multitasking.

06:58.860 --> 07:02.720
And mostly what they did is they just added some stupid dots.

07:02.720 --> 07:07.260
So I know where to drag stuff and I know where my dumb meat clicker needs to go.

07:07.260 --> 07:08.260
That's all it took.

07:08.260 --> 07:09.260
Have you played with it?

07:09.260 --> 07:10.260
I have.

07:10.260 --> 07:15.320
It's really going to, okay, can I just take a quick detour before I go into a full rant?

07:15.320 --> 07:16.320
Yeah.

07:16.320 --> 07:19.120
Someone suggested new merch for you, Chris, Coder sippy cups or water bottles.

07:19.120 --> 07:21.800
I think that's a good, that's an easy one.

07:21.800 --> 07:23.600
Something with a no tip base.

07:23.600 --> 07:25.040
We got to get on that.

07:25.040 --> 07:26.560
So okay.

07:26.560 --> 07:32.480
The new iPad multitasking is so good that it pisses me off because of the dumb API restrictions

07:32.480 --> 07:35.440
that iOS still has or iPad OS.

07:35.440 --> 07:40.380
Of course they've never been closer to the star Trek dream of the tablet that you're

07:40.380 --> 07:44.640
just like a commander Sulu, you know, throw this stuff up or it was a commander Sulu or

07:44.640 --> 07:46.680
is it Lieutenant Sulu commander, right?

07:46.680 --> 07:50.320
It depends on if it's star Trek six or if it's earlier in the, oh, that's right.

07:50.320 --> 07:53.280
He gets a, he gets a promotion, but whatever.

07:53.280 --> 07:54.280
Right.

07:54.280 --> 07:58.200
And you know, I would love to hear from like full time, like I guess you could be a swift

07:58.200 --> 07:59.200
iOS developer.

07:59.200 --> 08:00.200
No, you can't.

08:00.200 --> 08:01.200
You know why?

08:01.200 --> 08:02.200
Because they don't exist.

08:02.200 --> 08:04.280
There's a part of the story I didn't share chair.

08:04.280 --> 08:09.820
I was on the iPad and I needed to retrieve this IRC log because, um, let's just say that

08:09.820 --> 08:12.600
I had an incident during last week's Linux unplugged.

08:12.600 --> 08:13.600
Oh boy.

08:13.600 --> 08:14.600
Um, yeah.

08:14.600 --> 08:21.060
A founder of a really kind of high focus, high attention, open source project came into

08:21.060 --> 08:24.760
our IRC room and things got a little wild.

08:24.760 --> 08:28.440
And after, after it all went, after it was all done, I thought to myself, you know what?

08:28.440 --> 08:32.040
I want the logs of that because I want to be able to talk about it in the show and I

08:32.040 --> 08:34.280
need to be able to prove it happened.

08:34.280 --> 08:45.400
So I went to pull my log and it generated my IRC log all the way back to 2016.

08:45.400 --> 08:50.560
That was like, it was like a T it's like a 260 megabyte text file.

08:50.560 --> 08:51.560
Right.

08:51.560 --> 08:52.560
Okay.

08:52.560 --> 08:56.140
And nothing on iOS was having this and boy does like the file management fall down.

08:56.140 --> 08:57.580
It's gotten a lot better.

08:57.580 --> 09:00.360
But when you're trying to move around, like first of all, I needed to extract it from

09:00.360 --> 09:01.640
a zip file.

09:01.640 --> 09:06.520
When I needed to do something, yeah, no, it just started falling apart.

09:06.520 --> 09:11.700
And even once I got it into its text form out of the zip file, none of the text editors

09:11.700 --> 09:14.920
that I have on iOS could open it.

09:14.920 --> 09:16.440
They all just kind of just crashed out.

09:16.440 --> 09:19.660
Cause they have to use stupid URL schemes to open the, uh, yeah.

09:19.660 --> 09:25.460
So I toss it, I toss it in Dropbox and I go open it up on my Linux desktop and K write.

09:25.460 --> 09:27.240
And it opened like it was three lines of text.

09:27.240 --> 09:29.080
I mean, it opened instantly.

09:29.080 --> 09:34.640
It was, it was a total, absolute non-issue on my desktop.

09:34.640 --> 09:38.520
And I struggled with it for 20 minutes on iOS and gave up.

09:38.520 --> 09:39.680
So it's not all there.

09:39.680 --> 09:40.720
Like this is the dumb thing though.

09:40.720 --> 09:42.660
This isn't like a Linux master race case.

09:42.660 --> 09:45.640
This is like iOS is based on macOS, right?

09:45.640 --> 09:46.960
It's like the same core.

09:46.960 --> 09:50.260
I know people will jump, but that's true.

09:50.260 --> 09:57.960
It's just like a decision that they made was to limit iOS in this way for no reason, right?

09:57.960 --> 09:58.960
It's fast enough.

09:58.960 --> 10:00.160
It's fast enough to power.

10:00.160 --> 10:05.240
But just the SDKs they make available, the APIs they make available, um, frankly they,

10:05.240 --> 10:11.440
they, uh, hamstring the developers such that they can't do simple like open a 256 meg text

10:11.440 --> 10:12.440
file.

10:12.440 --> 10:13.440
Sorry, keep going.

10:13.440 --> 10:18.520
It's just, it is kind of disappointing because it's, you know, an iPad pro and I would wager

10:18.520 --> 10:23.780
that if I bought the new iPad pro with the 16 gigs of Ram option, this would likely still

10:23.780 --> 10:24.780
be a problem.

10:24.780 --> 10:28.340
And it's just kind of like, uh, sort of, it's sort of too bad.

10:28.340 --> 10:33.720
What I ended up doing last night while I couldn't sleep was just a terminal, some web browser

10:33.720 --> 10:34.960
and some chat.

10:34.960 --> 10:39.360
And I mean, I just, I probably worked for three, three and a half hours without, without

10:39.360 --> 10:41.520
any interruptions because it was the middle of the night.

10:41.520 --> 10:43.480
It was so glorious.

10:43.480 --> 10:44.680
And the iPad just chugged right along.

10:44.680 --> 10:47.160
Chris, don't make me, don't make me install Xcode again.

10:47.160 --> 10:48.160
Don't.

10:48.160 --> 10:49.160
I am sorry.

10:49.160 --> 10:50.160
All right.

10:50.160 --> 10:51.160
Dan writes into the show.

10:51.160 --> 10:54.720
He says, guys, I just listened to episode 421 and I wanted to confirm what I think Michael

10:54.720 --> 10:56.840
said about the programming language of the future.

10:56.840 --> 10:57.840
Sorry, Chris.

10:57.840 --> 10:58.840
I don't know about Rust.

10:58.840 --> 11:01.320
It's definitely going to be Java or TypeScript.

11:01.320 --> 11:05.500
I'd love it to be Rust, but the community still doesn't get what it takes to succeed

11:05.500 --> 11:12.240
in the enterprise ecosystem, i.e. being boring and stable to an extent like Go has become.

11:12.240 --> 11:17.560
Rust just loves to pump out new releases and create too many nightly only features that

11:17.560 --> 11:19.460
people can't keep track of.

11:19.460 --> 11:24.920
And when that's paired with no LTS version, it makes Rust unappealing to the enterprise.

11:24.920 --> 11:28.680
That's a point that I guess I don't really have a lot of insight into, so I hadn't really

11:28.680 --> 11:29.680
considered it.

11:29.680 --> 11:32.840
But I suppose it looks like Rust does move pretty quick right now.

11:32.840 --> 11:38.360
Yeah, I could see how something like Go would be more appealing to an enterprise developer,

11:38.360 --> 11:40.440
especially when you have projects that take years to build.

11:40.440 --> 11:43.000
Yeah, I don't really have a lot more than I said last episode.

11:43.000 --> 11:48.680
I mean, you know, to add here just that it's interesting since we started the show, enterprise

11:48.680 --> 11:53.360
product managers who maybe don't have technical backgrounds in the 13 years we've been doing

11:53.360 --> 11:58.080
this have learned one lesson, and possibly only one lesson.

11:58.080 --> 12:03.980
Do not use esoteric technology that some weird vendor, some weird bespoke vendor local to

12:03.980 --> 12:05.200
you does.

12:05.200 --> 12:10.240
Use something super common that you can fire them and hire someone in India or wherever.

12:10.240 --> 12:12.280
Or just some other local vendor, right?

12:12.280 --> 12:18.760
So I mean, it's why Python is just a lot easier for me to sell now than Ruby, frankly.

12:18.760 --> 12:20.720
Which Ruby is not even that weird of a technology.

12:20.720 --> 12:23.680
It's just Python has the market share wise.

12:23.680 --> 12:27.640
And so do you think part of that is your clients are doing the math saying, well, if I fire

12:27.640 --> 12:31.080
this jackass, I can hire another guy and he'll pick it right back up?

12:31.080 --> 12:32.840
Well, there's two levels of math, right?

12:32.840 --> 12:35.680
Because you know, in our case, we're the Mad Botters, a small shop.

12:35.680 --> 12:39.240
We've been around for a while, but we're, you know, we're still like, we're small.

12:39.240 --> 12:41.880
So it's if we fire them.

12:41.880 --> 12:47.720
But the more common case, because I think people like to be polite, is if you guys go

12:47.720 --> 12:51.960
out of business or you sell for whatever reason, can we replace you?

12:51.960 --> 12:52.960
You know, easily.

12:52.960 --> 12:53.960
Right.

12:53.960 --> 12:54.960
If you get a big fat paycheck.

12:54.960 --> 12:55.960
Right.

12:55.960 --> 12:56.960
That's a nice way to say it.

12:56.960 --> 12:57.960
Yeah.

12:57.960 --> 12:58.960
I mean, what they really mean is if we fire you.

12:58.960 --> 12:59.960
Right.

12:59.960 --> 13:00.960
Yeah.

13:00.960 --> 13:01.960
Of course.

13:01.960 --> 13:02.960
It's, you know, like rust.

13:02.960 --> 13:04.100
There's just like, I've even like looked around.

13:04.100 --> 13:08.220
There are rust vendors and they seem great, but they're awfully expensive.

13:08.220 --> 13:13.180
It also just doesn't feel like that's the, that's not the place rust is at right now.

13:13.180 --> 13:14.320
It is still new.

13:14.320 --> 13:16.520
There is still a lot being figured out.

13:16.520 --> 13:18.960
We're just now seeing major vendors.

13:18.960 --> 13:21.600
Talk publicly about how they think they might incorporate it.

13:21.600 --> 13:27.240
Like an example is Microsoft is considering rewriting aspects of the hyper V code for

13:27.240 --> 13:32.780
Linux in rust, but they haven't done it yet, but they are discussing that.

13:32.780 --> 13:38.060
And Google has just put forward an initiative and is helping pay for a developer to contribute

13:38.060 --> 13:42.340
to rust for the Linux kernel full-time, but that's just begun, right?

13:42.340 --> 13:46.260
It's early days for mainstream adoption still.

13:46.260 --> 13:50.760
It's a lot of people are using it, but when you look at enterprises like Amazon and, and

13:50.760 --> 13:54.120
Microsoft and Google, it's still early days.

13:54.120 --> 13:55.120
Yeah.

13:55.120 --> 13:59.200
And just for some real time followup from the chat room, X S X Sierra, Charlie 27, I'm

13:59.200 --> 14:02.720
going to use, I don't know what you mean there, buddy, but okay.

14:02.720 --> 14:06.360
Is saying a TypeScript is hot, but as rust and TypeScript in the same domain, obviously

14:06.360 --> 14:07.660
they're not right.

14:07.660 --> 14:09.720
But I can give you the perfect example that I'm using, right?

14:09.720 --> 14:15.220
We're using Python as the high level business language, business logic language and C plus

14:15.220 --> 14:19.960
plus as the underlying performing code and that you could use rust and something else.

14:19.960 --> 14:20.960
I, in fact, I did that.

14:20.960 --> 14:25.520
If you listen back maybe a year ago, I did something where it was Ruby as the business

14:25.520 --> 14:32.920
logic with a rust, a native rust library for Linux that I wrote doing some, um, uh, Oh

14:32.920 --> 14:33.920
my God.

14:33.920 --> 14:34.920
The stupid 3d files.

14:34.920 --> 14:35.920
I talk about them all.

14:35.920 --> 14:36.920
STL.

14:36.920 --> 14:37.920
No.

14:37.920 --> 14:38.920
Oh my God.

14:38.920 --> 14:39.920
A color OBJ.

14:39.920 --> 14:44.480
I can't remember the name of the file format, but it's these color 3d it's the ones that

14:44.480 --> 14:45.800
you use for 3d modeling.

14:45.800 --> 14:49.240
I can't remember the name off the top of my head, but that was a case where the performance

14:49.240 --> 14:53.320
calculations for the three graphics were done in rust, right?

14:53.320 --> 14:56.780
Via a native library, via FFI.

14:56.780 --> 15:01.000
But the general business logic of the application was done in Ruby because we're just, you know,

15:01.000 --> 15:02.440
Ruby is just like an easier language to work in.

15:02.440 --> 15:03.440
Right?

15:03.440 --> 15:06.920
So yeah, especially if you've already done, you know, some pre-work in there like years

15:06.920 --> 15:07.920
of Ruby.

15:07.920 --> 15:08.920
Right?

15:08.920 --> 15:09.920
Yeah.

15:09.920 --> 15:10.920
All right.

15:10.920 --> 15:15.000
So we've got a lot of conversation about the Apple store, Epic and antitrust.

15:15.000 --> 15:19.080
But one of the things that I think a lot of people have missed is that Apple is no longer

15:19.080 --> 15:25.120
a hardware company and they're not a software company and they're not even a services company.

15:25.120 --> 15:30.760
Apple I think is selling an experience and the only tech company that is doing it, which

15:30.760 --> 15:34.200
is a major reason why they are appealing to a lot of people.

15:34.200 --> 15:40.160
Apple computers, watch, iPhone, iPad, home, everything integrates together messaging,

15:40.160 --> 15:44.760
including SMS across all your devices, answer your phone from your watch or on your computer,

15:44.760 --> 15:48.880
automate much of your house with home kit and turn on the lights with Siri with a voice

15:48.880 --> 15:51.840
command while you're driving home.

15:51.840 --> 15:57.000
This is the Apple worldview or maybe what you might call the experience.

15:57.000 --> 16:00.680
And it's actually pretty nice when you buy into their entire ecosystem.

16:00.680 --> 16:02.920
Part of that experience is the app store.

16:02.920 --> 16:07.880
In my opinion, where Apple really went wrong was letting everything into the app store

16:07.880 --> 16:09.900
and not curating the apps.

16:09.900 --> 16:15.820
We end up with a lot of junk and a race to the bottom and allowing sideloading would

16:15.820 --> 16:19.000
only worsen this problem.

16:19.000 --> 16:20.920
That's an interesting point.

16:20.920 --> 16:25.600
Sideloading would perhaps negatively impact the pricing on the platform.

16:25.600 --> 16:27.800
What do you think of that?

16:27.800 --> 16:30.520
I sort of separate it into two different spaces.

16:30.520 --> 16:33.760
I think he's right in the consumer space that sideloading would only lead to a bunch of

16:33.760 --> 16:37.880
piracy and a bunch of bullsh**, fair enough, lowering prices for developers.

16:37.880 --> 16:42.720
I just want to say, though, that perhaps over the years, my perspective has changed.

16:42.720 --> 16:47.760
I've gone from selling consumer apps to basically enterprise products.

16:47.760 --> 16:51.360
I'm not sure what you call an app or a program these days, but I guess everything's an app,

16:51.360 --> 16:52.360
right?

16:52.360 --> 16:53.360
So apps.

16:53.360 --> 16:54.360
All right.

16:54.360 --> 16:59.720
Look, I have multiple customers that I have decked out with Surface Pro Xs and Surface

16:59.720 --> 17:05.480
Pro tablets and even a couple of Surface Go's, not because Windows was the better platform

17:05.480 --> 17:11.480
to work in, although in some cases it was because of hardware compatibility and drivers.

17:11.480 --> 17:13.500
Not because we prefer working with Windows.

17:13.500 --> 17:14.500
We don't.

17:14.500 --> 17:20.320
Our primary, most of our stuff runs on Linux, but given our druthers, the client side environment

17:20.320 --> 17:25.700
would be the DOM, the web browser, and then second to that, iOS.

17:25.700 --> 17:29.240
It's just never worth it to deal with the enterprise provisioning for Apple where you

17:29.240 --> 17:34.520
have to like code sign and go through their weird enterprise portal for just like a factory

17:34.520 --> 17:36.480
or for like a farm or for like a hangar.

17:36.480 --> 17:42.200
It's just never worth it when I can just tell someone to buy like 20 Surface tablets.

17:42.200 --> 17:46.920
We write the thing, we code sign it, you know, we self sign their certificate and we can

17:46.920 --> 17:50.920
just manage our own installation without going through a third party.

17:50.920 --> 17:55.840
I know for those who haven't done it, that might seem petty, but Apple, even in the enterprise

17:55.840 --> 17:58.040
still gets to decide what the hell you do.

17:58.040 --> 18:03.960
And if I can just make a case or an example of a case from, was it 18 months ago when

18:03.960 --> 18:07.840
Apple got pissed off at Facebook and you couldn't order a lunch if you were a Facebook employee

18:07.840 --> 18:13.280
because the iPad app broke in the cafeteria because Apple just revoked the certificate.

18:13.280 --> 18:15.200
That's, that's bull.

18:15.200 --> 18:18.420
That shouldn't be the way things are, at least not in the enterprise.

18:18.420 --> 18:19.960
A lot of their internal apps broke.

18:19.960 --> 18:20.960
Just broke.

18:20.960 --> 18:21.960
A lot of them.

18:21.960 --> 18:22.960
Yeah.

18:22.960 --> 18:28.320
That is my core issue, you know, cause I sell mostly B2B software.

18:28.320 --> 18:35.360
If I could write iOS apps for iPad in particular and just like deploy them like I do, you know,

18:35.360 --> 18:39.520
not on the app store, but the, uh, whatever private deployment mechanism without going

18:39.520 --> 18:44.440
through Apple, I would probably in almost every case prefer iOS.

18:44.440 --> 18:45.440
Yeah.

18:45.440 --> 18:49.000
The thing is with the Microsoft Surfaces, let's be honest, it's not that hard of a sale

18:49.000 --> 18:52.840
because they're probably already buying them for some users or they're buying something

18:52.840 --> 18:54.040
in the windows ecosystem.

18:54.040 --> 18:56.200
They probably already have an active directory system.

18:56.200 --> 18:57.400
They probably already have group policy.

18:57.400 --> 19:00.960
They already have audit procedures around the windows desktop.

19:00.960 --> 19:05.520
So it's not a particularly hard sell to get them to, to deploy it on a, on a, on a surface.

19:05.520 --> 19:06.520
Yeah, no.

19:06.520 --> 19:11.120
I mean, I have a customer who's a huge Linux fan, JB fan, and you know, we ended up just

19:11.120 --> 19:14.800
going windows for the simple reason that he needed a good touchscreen environment for

19:14.800 --> 19:15.800
these tablets.

19:15.800 --> 19:16.800
You bastard.

19:16.800 --> 19:21.720
And you know, Ubuntu touch, uh, sorry, you know, it wasn't even considered, but like

19:21.720 --> 19:27.380
the hurdles of like getting him enrolled in the enterprise program for iOS, it just like

19:27.380 --> 19:31.440
no one wants to delay a project because you know, mom doesn't, you know, mother apple

19:31.440 --> 19:33.360
doesn't want to let you do something right.

19:33.360 --> 19:34.360
That's, that's ridiculous.

19:34.360 --> 19:35.360
So.

19:35.360 --> 19:36.360
All right.

19:36.360 --> 19:38.660
Well he just wraps up and wraps up real quick with, I think part of the problem is that

19:38.660 --> 19:42.800
everyone is thinking of each part of the experience as a separate thing and I want to pause right

19:42.800 --> 19:43.800
here.

19:43.800 --> 19:47.000
I've had the experience and I'm a, you know, I'm a daily iPhone user and I have an iPad

19:47.000 --> 19:50.400
and I have the watch and over time I got the air pods.

19:50.400 --> 19:51.400
Apple action show.

19:51.400 --> 19:53.720
Right over, over time it's like you do get sucked in.

19:53.720 --> 19:54.720
Just the air pods.

19:54.720 --> 20:00.000
And the thing is so far, but the thing is in its own, it's not, it's not, it's not as

20:00.000 --> 20:01.000
good of an experience.

20:01.000 --> 20:06.800
So when my friends that maybe are Android users get an iPhone or get an iPad, they're

20:06.800 --> 20:07.800
very frustrated.

20:07.800 --> 20:08.800
They find it very limited.

20:08.800 --> 20:13.800
They, they're very frustrated by the experience because I think it, it does require that you

20:13.800 --> 20:18.060
kind of are all in on the entire experience, um, where all the pieces do fit together.

20:18.060 --> 20:21.980
So he finishes with saying, I liken it to visiting Disney world.

20:21.980 --> 20:25.400
You can buy a ticket at the gate when you get there and you can pack your own lunch

20:25.400 --> 20:29.680
and you can wait in all the lines and you can still have a decent time or you can order

20:29.680 --> 20:34.140
a package deal ahead of time, stay at a resort, eat in the restaurants with Disney characters

20:34.140 --> 20:38.000
and skip the lines with fast passes and VIP tours.

20:38.000 --> 20:44.280
Yes, it will cost some more and you will be at the mercy of a schedule, but you will get

20:44.280 --> 20:50.320
more of the experience that Disney is trying to offer you and have a great vacation experience.

20:50.320 --> 20:53.380
The Linux and Android experience can't even come close.

20:53.380 --> 20:56.060
It's more like visiting a local county fair.

20:56.060 --> 21:01.200
It seems like a good idea before you go and you'll have a good time, but it isn't anything

21:01.200 --> 21:02.200
special.

21:02.200 --> 21:03.200
Don't order the scallops.

21:03.200 --> 21:04.200
Yep.

21:04.200 --> 21:06.920
That's a pretty, I mean that guy, that guy's dropping bombs right there, Em.

21:06.920 --> 21:08.000
You're dropping bombs.

21:08.000 --> 21:12.280
So I will say the, the thing that keeps me locked into the Mac ecosystem, or I shouldn't

21:12.280 --> 21:18.080
call it Mac, I should call it the Apple ecosystem, is not the incredibly amazing M1 chip.

21:18.080 --> 21:21.200
And I don't care what you say on Reddit, it's still amazing and you guys have to accept

21:21.200 --> 21:22.200
that.

21:22.200 --> 21:26.660
Um, the beautiful sound quality of the home pods that Chris intentionally didn't mention,

21:26.660 --> 21:32.720
the wonderful connectivity of the AirPods max and the incredible disappointment that

21:32.720 --> 21:35.520
I feel with the iPad pro because Apple only do what it needs to do.

21:35.520 --> 21:39.960
I think we're like at $3,000 worth of gear now, maybe $5,000 worth of gear so far.

21:39.960 --> 21:40.960
Right.

21:40.960 --> 21:41.960
But that's what it is.

21:41.960 --> 21:46.520
Every, every piece of Apple hardware you buy, it's just like another hit of heroin, right?

21:46.520 --> 21:48.160
Always using theme parks, very family friendly.

21:48.160 --> 21:50.200
I'm going to go the other way.

21:50.200 --> 21:54.000
At some point, you know, you're just, you're just turning tricks on the street corner for,

21:54.000 --> 21:57.840
you know, honestly, I almost bought a purple iMac.

21:57.840 --> 21:59.720
Do I need a purple iMac?

21:59.720 --> 22:04.160
Does anybody think in the audience that I need a purple iMac?

22:04.160 --> 22:05.160
Probably not.

22:05.160 --> 22:06.160
No.

22:06.160 --> 22:09.920
So I mean, it's just, it's a crack because you turn around and it's like, do you have

22:09.920 --> 22:12.480
an, I see you have another Apple device.

22:12.480 --> 22:14.440
Would you like us to magically set this up?

22:14.440 --> 22:16.400
Oh, we see you have Apple music.

22:16.400 --> 22:21.360
I, you know, I wouldn't even necessarily undersell it because if they, if they blew it every

22:21.360 --> 22:25.160
time, every time you bought one of those products, you're like, oh, well, this sucks.

22:25.160 --> 22:26.360
You would stop buying them.

22:26.360 --> 22:27.360
Right.

22:27.360 --> 22:30.840
But the thing is, is they are meeting or exceeding your expectations.

22:30.840 --> 22:36.200
Now I'm not, I actually feel like there is also the flip side where you have people who

22:36.200 --> 22:37.800
prefer to assemble things.

22:37.800 --> 22:38.840
They prefer to build things.

22:38.840 --> 22:40.640
They prefer to build a repair things.

22:40.640 --> 22:46.080
We've had this conversation before and I feel like that doesn't get enough airtime in this

22:46.080 --> 22:50.360
conversation because that is a large group of people, but it's just not where people

22:50.360 --> 22:54.760
who are maybe heads down, very busy at work, managing a business, managing customers, managing

22:54.760 --> 22:56.260
at such projects.

22:56.260 --> 22:57.440
That's not where maybe their heads at.

22:57.440 --> 23:00.560
So, and that's you and I, we're very much these days, we're very busy and we hear from

23:00.560 --> 23:04.440
our audience who feel like they're very much in the same place, but there is, there is

23:04.440 --> 23:08.360
a different kind of value in that stuff and I kind of look at it and I think to myself,

23:08.360 --> 23:14.960
I just wish, I wish somebody could create like a machine that was close to a middle

23:14.960 --> 23:19.000
ground of all this stuff, but he does, I do agree with the overall experience like you're

23:19.000 --> 23:20.000
alluding to as well.

23:20.000 --> 23:23.640
If you, if you want to fork out the cash for it, you know, like one of the things that

23:23.640 --> 23:29.000
just as an example of this, it's pretty, pretty nice is if you got the watch and you've got

23:29.000 --> 23:34.600
the Apple TV automatically without you having to do anything, the watch automatically just

23:34.600 --> 23:37.800
becomes playback controller for the TV if it's not doing anything.

23:37.800 --> 23:39.840
So you get play, pause, skip.

23:39.840 --> 23:40.840
Wait, it does?

23:40.840 --> 23:41.840
Yeah.

23:41.840 --> 23:42.840
It's so great.

23:42.840 --> 23:45.080
I have like three Apple TVs, I didn't wait.

23:45.080 --> 23:48.460
So if I just really, yeah, it's cause what's happening is on your, you know, it's the same

23:48.460 --> 23:49.460
thing on your iPhone.

23:49.460 --> 23:53.120
When you go into the control center and you look at all the different airplay devices,

23:53.120 --> 23:56.400
you can pop, you can pop in and control the Apple TV there too.

23:56.400 --> 24:00.600
And when your phone detects it, your watch detects it and it's so nice and you maybe

24:00.600 --> 24:03.580
have to do it once, maybe, and then it does it all the time.

24:03.580 --> 24:06.840
And so if like my kids are watching TV and they're not listening to me, I just flick

24:06.840 --> 24:08.360
my wrist up and hit the pause button.

24:08.360 --> 24:09.360
Boom.

24:09.360 --> 24:10.360
TV pauses instantly.

24:10.360 --> 24:14.040
I went on a hunt for the remote and I didn't have to go like set up any config file or

24:14.040 --> 24:18.480
set up any special DNS or do anything weird to my DHCP server.

24:18.480 --> 24:19.480
It just works.

24:19.480 --> 24:23.320
Wait, you didn't get to pop open nano and realize you don't have them installed?

24:23.320 --> 24:25.160
That's the experience though that he's talking about there.

24:25.160 --> 24:26.160
And I do agree.

24:26.160 --> 24:27.600
It's, it is nice when it works.

24:27.600 --> 24:30.520
By the way, if you use nano, please explain why.

24:30.520 --> 24:31.640
I love nano.

24:31.640 --> 24:32.640
It's great.

24:32.640 --> 24:33.640
Get the f**k.

24:33.640 --> 24:34.640
Really?

24:34.640 --> 24:37.400
See, I'm already in New Jersey mode.

24:37.400 --> 24:41.800
We were going to be bleeping a lot when I get back up there.

24:41.800 --> 24:43.320
Linode.com slash coder.

24:43.320 --> 24:48.600
Go there to get $100 in credit for a new account for 60 days and you support the show.

24:48.600 --> 24:53.280
You know, Linode started in 2003, so they've been doing this for longer than I've been

24:53.280 --> 24:54.280
podcasting.

24:54.280 --> 24:55.280
That's a really long time.

24:55.280 --> 24:57.240
They've been doing this for like 18 years.

24:57.240 --> 24:58.640
Linode's like old enough to vote now.

24:58.640 --> 25:05.800
They started before AWS and the other enterprisey big old like hyperscaler cloud guys got into

25:05.800 --> 25:09.020
it, you know, with their big fancy offerings.

25:09.020 --> 25:12.040
They were like, they were like late to the game.

25:12.040 --> 25:16.020
Linode was there first and they're independently owned and they're founded on a love for Linux.

25:16.020 --> 25:18.680
And now they're the largest independent cloud provider.

25:18.680 --> 25:19.880
That's pretty awesome.

25:19.880 --> 25:24.280
And one of the things they're doing that I, I think is just so indicative of how they

25:24.280 --> 25:28.800
support the community is they're helping make our Jupiter colony reunion road trip possible.

25:28.800 --> 25:32.120
We're meeting up with Salt Lake city and Denver.

25:32.120 --> 25:35.960
That's that's being powered by Linode, both, both like in the money sense, but also like

25:35.960 --> 25:40.400
in the technology sense, everything we host for Jupiter broadcasting since we've gone

25:40.400 --> 25:43.380
to Indie has been on Linode.

25:43.380 --> 25:44.380
And that's because it's fast.

25:44.380 --> 25:45.660
They have a great dashboard.

25:45.660 --> 25:48.680
They have fantastic 24 seven, amazing customer support.

25:48.680 --> 25:49.680
Really.

25:49.680 --> 25:51.300
I mean, these things all add up.

25:51.300 --> 25:53.000
They have 11 data centers worldwide.

25:53.000 --> 25:57.520
They own the connections between their data centers, Linode, man.

25:57.520 --> 26:00.560
I think I was like, I mean, I don't remember the date exactly, but I think it was like

26:00.560 --> 26:05.500
somewhere in 2017, 2018, they became their own ISP.

26:05.500 --> 26:07.720
That's the advantage of being around for a long time.

26:07.720 --> 26:10.700
And then just continually doubling down on your focus.

26:10.700 --> 26:14.360
So they have these advantages that you kind of don't even really notice until you start

26:14.360 --> 26:15.360
using it.

26:15.360 --> 26:19.180
And they have super high end systems with like AMD epic processors.

26:19.180 --> 26:23.900
And they also have just like $5 a month rigs that you can get a surprising amount of value

26:23.900 --> 26:24.900
out of.

26:24.900 --> 26:27.600
And you can look at their different options and mix and match some pieces that are upgraded

26:27.600 --> 26:28.600
later.

26:28.600 --> 26:33.460
And they're always a great deal, like 35, 50% less than some of the major cloud providers

26:33.460 --> 26:34.460
out there.

26:34.460 --> 26:38.540
You know, Linode just runs our backend so well that if I didn't tell you in these spots,

26:38.540 --> 26:41.600
you wouldn't know because it's not like you're getting error pages and things aren't working.

26:41.600 --> 26:43.960
Like everything's humming right along.

26:43.960 --> 26:48.720
And one of the things we do to make our infrastructure scale with our user base is where we can, we

26:48.720 --> 26:52.580
take advantage of Linode's S3 compatible object storage.

26:52.580 --> 26:55.520
That means we kind of grow as our user base needs to.

26:55.520 --> 26:59.900
And we also can use it for things like stashing assets in the cloud and generating public

26:59.900 --> 27:06.820
URLs or serving up static websites super fast or offloading images to Linode.

27:06.820 --> 27:09.780
And that makes just things really snappy.

27:09.780 --> 27:12.320
There's so much you could learn, so much you can try.

27:12.320 --> 27:15.700
And there's those one click application deployments, there's lots of those too.

27:15.700 --> 27:20.780
So there's a lot of ways you could use that $100, have some fun, learn something and maybe

27:20.780 --> 27:23.980
deploy something in production and support the show.

27:23.980 --> 27:26.260
It's a great opportunity to do all of that.

27:26.260 --> 27:31.660
So go to linode.com slash coder, get that $100 60 day credit on your new Linode account

27:31.660 --> 27:33.180
and you support the show.

27:33.180 --> 27:35.020
Thanks to Linode for sponsoring the Coder Radio program.

27:35.020 --> 27:39.620
That's linode.com slash coder.

27:39.620 --> 27:43.900
So I thought maybe by this week, all of the hoopla around Copilot would have just simmered

27:43.900 --> 27:46.660
out, but it definitely has not.

27:46.660 --> 27:48.780
And I didn't take this very seriously initially.

27:48.780 --> 27:49.780
Neither did I.

27:49.780 --> 27:50.780
I didn't even really bother trying it.

27:50.780 --> 27:51.780
I just thought, okay.

27:51.780 --> 27:52.780
Yeah.

27:52.780 --> 27:53.780
I thought it was like a dumb toy.

27:53.780 --> 27:55.980
Honestly, it was one of our little, okay, we need content.

27:55.980 --> 27:56.980
Let's just throw it in.

27:56.980 --> 27:57.980
Yeah.

27:57.980 --> 27:58.980
Let's just talk about it.

27:58.980 --> 27:59.980
It was like, it's weird.

27:59.980 --> 28:00.980
It's new.

28:00.980 --> 28:04.620
Like we weren't taking it very seriously, but it definitely has gotten a whole gamut.

28:04.620 --> 28:05.700
It's gotten a lot of praise.

28:05.700 --> 28:07.740
It's also gotten a lot of fire.

28:07.740 --> 28:10.900
And I mean, I really don't even know what to think of it at this point.

28:10.900 --> 28:12.620
I'm curious where you're at with it.

28:12.620 --> 28:15.660
I sort of feel like this is either one of those things that I'm just going to completely

28:15.660 --> 28:17.060
be wrong about.

28:17.060 --> 28:18.060
I don't get it.

28:18.060 --> 28:24.620
Like I get the concept, but everybody that I follow and you know, that follows me or

28:24.620 --> 28:26.940
whatever on Twitter is like all pissed off about this.

28:26.940 --> 28:36.260
I don't understand why it's a kind of bad idea that isn't working super well.

28:36.260 --> 28:37.940
And like, there may be some licensing issues.

28:37.940 --> 28:38.940
I don't know.

28:38.940 --> 28:39.940
I'm not an attorney.

28:39.940 --> 28:45.060
I personally don't understand how there could be, um, but like, oh, it reproduces stupid

28:45.060 --> 28:46.060
bad code.

28:46.060 --> 28:47.300
Well, yeah, it's just regurgitating code.

28:47.300 --> 28:48.940
It's public available on GitHub.

28:48.940 --> 28:52.120
What idiot would copy pasta code from GitHub or Stack Overflow?

28:52.120 --> 28:55.340
Every developer ever is the right answer to that question, but we all pretend like we

28:55.340 --> 28:56.340
don't.

28:56.340 --> 29:02.140
So like, I don't know if, is it, I mean, could it be useful?

29:02.140 --> 29:07.100
Maybe I don't honestly, I did not install it.

29:07.100 --> 29:10.260
So this is one of those things like maybe I'm completely missing the boat.

29:10.260 --> 29:15.500
I mean, my judgment's been so good with windows eight and Metro, right?

29:15.500 --> 29:20.660
Well, I went out and I did some reading and I found a really comprehensive risk assessment

29:20.660 --> 29:24.180
that's posted up on GitHub and I'll have it linked in the show notes.

29:24.180 --> 29:25.180
And I really liked it.

29:25.180 --> 29:27.820
You know, they started out talking about how Copilot is a generative model, meaning its

29:27.820 --> 29:32.620
purpose is to generate output that is, that statistically resembles its input.

29:32.620 --> 29:36.900
That's a very important aspect of when you think about how Copilot is going to work.

29:36.900 --> 29:40.760
And so the, in other words, the goal is not exactly to reproduce the input because you

29:40.760 --> 29:43.540
definitely don't really need a machine learning system to do that.

29:43.540 --> 29:50.740
This model has a parameter called the temperature, which is a sliding scale between conservatism

29:50.740 --> 29:52.500
and originality.

29:52.500 --> 29:55.900
The higher you go towards originality, the less structured the output becomes.

29:55.900 --> 29:58.940
It will gradually just become gibberish actually.

29:58.940 --> 30:02.940
So GitHub controls the temperature of Copilot and they've presumably just been fine tuning

30:02.940 --> 30:06.940
it based on, you know, the, the trialing that they're doing right now.

30:06.940 --> 30:12.260
But the thing that's interesting about this, I guess I should say is if you prompt Copilot

30:12.260 --> 30:17.220
over and over again with the same input, you won't always get the same result.

30:17.220 --> 30:18.220
That's kind of interesting.

30:18.220 --> 30:22.300
But yeah, I looked at this myself just from like what people are saying, cause I wanted

30:22.300 --> 30:27.300
to figure out the licensing aspect of it and what they're saying, and I kind of see this

30:27.300 --> 30:34.100
Mike is, well, it might be used for license washing where because it can regenerate things

30:34.100 --> 30:39.460
almost really, really close to the original code, but with just like slight tweaks, you

30:39.460 --> 30:44.460
could use this to output code that resembles very closely to the original GPL code with

30:44.460 --> 30:51.020
just a few of the essentials tweaked, essentially reproducing the original thing very easily,

30:51.020 --> 30:52.660
but under a different license now.

30:52.660 --> 30:58.420
But why wouldn't, if that was your aim, why wouldn't you just like look at the GPL code

30:58.420 --> 30:59.980
and then steal it anyway?

30:59.980 --> 31:03.680
I'm not, and I have never done this, but I'm just saying like, or wouldn't it just be easier

31:03.680 --> 31:07.380
to pay the people for like a private license, the GPL code I've done that.

31:07.380 --> 31:12.420
I think maybe the other problem is that it could sort of slip in there and then somebody

31:12.420 --> 31:14.980
comes along and sues you and says, Hey, that's GPL code.

31:14.980 --> 31:15.980
Okay.

31:15.980 --> 31:16.980
Well, don't you have to prove intent?

31:16.980 --> 31:19.500
I mean, this is where not attorney is, right?

31:19.500 --> 31:22.620
Can your defense be the computer, the computer typed it for me?

31:22.620 --> 31:27.280
Is that a, well, what if I won't, what if like Coco or Coco touch, let's just say I'm

31:27.280 --> 31:30.520
doing iOS development is ripping off some GPL code.

31:30.520 --> 31:35.440
I know in that case, I'm not the obvious target to Sue, but how would I be liable for utilizing

31:35.440 --> 31:36.800
that code?

31:36.800 --> 31:40.260
It's just a tool I'm using to do my job, which shouldn't that not be me.

31:40.260 --> 31:43.800
So that's where I wonder, because you look at, you look at these lawsuits we've seen

31:43.800 --> 31:49.660
where even just like comments have come down to infringement, copying the comments and

31:49.660 --> 31:52.880
I can defeat my own argument actually remember the old, uh, the patent troll that was hitting

31:52.880 --> 31:54.920
all the iOS developers, the, uh, what is it?

31:54.920 --> 31:59.060
Not PI start the, uh, Oh my God, the in app purchase guys.

31:59.060 --> 32:00.060
This is from years ago.

32:00.060 --> 32:01.060
Yeah.

32:01.060 --> 32:02.060
Yeah.

32:02.060 --> 32:03.060
Yeah.

32:03.060 --> 32:05.060
So they were going after because Apple was allegedly infringing, but they were suing

32:05.060 --> 32:06.480
the individual app developers.

32:06.480 --> 32:08.840
So I guess you could, but I don't know.

32:08.840 --> 32:10.520
It's it depends on how you look at it, right?

32:10.520 --> 32:14.480
If you want this thing to large to write large portions of code, I think that's a real dumb

32:14.480 --> 32:19.960
idea, but I could kind of see it working if you treat it sort of like the Gmail auto completion

32:19.960 --> 32:24.680
when you're writing an email and it sort of suggests like the completion to the sentence.

32:24.680 --> 32:27.680
It's like, it's like in cell, it's like a better version of IntelliSense if you think

32:27.680 --> 32:30.280
of it that way, but I think the problem gets more complicated.

32:30.280 --> 32:34.220
If it starts completing larger and larger blocks of code, you as a developer, it's your

32:34.220 --> 32:38.480
responsibility to go back and check that and make sure it's legit and it just creates more

32:38.480 --> 32:39.480
work.

32:39.480 --> 32:40.480
Well, it should be against what?

32:40.480 --> 32:43.800
Against the known universe of GPL code or you mean just that like works?

32:43.800 --> 32:44.800
Yeah.

32:44.800 --> 32:47.640
That's just that it seems sane because it doesn't always actually produce sane code.

32:47.640 --> 32:52.440
Well, this is why I kind of, so I think when, when we first saw a copilot come out a couple

32:52.440 --> 32:56.360
of weeks, so you and I sort of put it in there because we put it in there or whatever, but

32:56.360 --> 32:58.680
like, I don't think, I mean, maybe I shouldn't speak for you.

32:58.680 --> 33:00.440
I didn't take it super seriously.

33:00.440 --> 33:01.440
No.

33:01.440 --> 33:02.440
Yeah, I agree.

33:02.440 --> 33:04.440
I kind of still don't.

33:04.440 --> 33:05.440
Yeah.

33:05.440 --> 33:09.960
I think maybe we got it right because I watched several videos and I read a lot of people

33:09.960 --> 33:14.440
that wrote like their opinions about their usage of it and it seems some people have

33:14.440 --> 33:15.440
a pretty good experience.

33:15.440 --> 33:19.840
Some people have it producing really trivially bad code, obviously bad code just by looking

33:19.840 --> 33:21.800
at it.

33:21.800 --> 33:27.440
So I mean, then that means it's not a, that means maybe it has, let's just say an 80%

33:27.440 --> 33:28.440
accuracy rate.

33:28.440 --> 33:34.720
Maybe even 90% that still leaves doubt and it still means the human has to go back and

33:34.720 --> 33:36.040
check the work.

33:36.040 --> 33:39.720
That's why I think in smaller pieces and smaller little bits, sort of like an email autocomplete

33:39.720 --> 33:40.720
like Gmail does.

33:40.720 --> 33:41.720
Okay.

33:41.720 --> 33:42.720
I could see it.

33:42.720 --> 33:48.920
But if it's more like, you know, larger than that, anything larger than that, really, I

33:48.920 --> 33:51.600
think it becomes more of a nuisance than it is a value.

33:51.600 --> 33:52.600
We'll see.

33:52.600 --> 33:53.600
I suppose it just gets better over time.

33:53.600 --> 33:54.600
Yeah.

33:54.600 --> 33:55.600
I'm sorry.

33:55.600 --> 33:56.600
I just, I'm sorry.

33:56.600 --> 34:01.520
The hard part of like the job of being a developer is not writing the actual code, right?

34:01.520 --> 34:02.520
That's like a miss.

34:02.520 --> 34:06.400
Like all those stupid movies or like the, you know, NCIS or CSI or whatever those dumb

34:06.400 --> 34:10.720
cop shows are where the guy's like pounding away at 4,000 words a minute on a keyboard

34:10.720 --> 34:11.720
that shatters, right?

34:11.720 --> 34:16.120
Most of the time I'm working on graph paper because yes, I'm old and please don't send

34:16.120 --> 34:18.640
me the tool that you think will replace my graph paper.

34:18.640 --> 34:19.640
I've tried.

34:19.640 --> 34:20.960
I'm currently trying to write one.

34:20.960 --> 34:25.160
It's harder than you think because graph paper is amazing.

34:25.160 --> 34:26.160
Get a hobby.

34:26.160 --> 34:27.160
I have a hobby.

34:27.160 --> 34:29.280
My hobby is writing iPad apps that I never ship.

34:29.280 --> 34:32.440
I like it when you argue with yourself.

34:32.440 --> 34:35.560
Is it a great, like Pat, I hate past Mike.

34:35.560 --> 34:36.560
Yeah.

34:36.560 --> 34:38.120
The arrogant prick that he was.

34:38.120 --> 34:39.120
Yeah.

34:39.120 --> 34:40.120
I mean he likes Sousa after all.

34:40.120 --> 34:41.840
Oh, Sousa is great.

34:41.840 --> 34:46.920
It's Sousa by the way, just so you, oh, our sponsor Linode will gladly give you an open

34:46.920 --> 34:47.920
Sousa server.

34:47.920 --> 34:48.920
That's true.

34:48.920 --> 34:49.920
So just, you know.

34:49.920 --> 34:50.920
Sousa.

34:50.920 --> 34:51.920
It's what you want.

34:51.920 --> 34:52.920
Yeah, I'll stand by that one.

34:52.920 --> 34:53.920
Good job, past Mike.

34:53.920 --> 34:55.480
No, it's just not that hard.

34:55.480 --> 34:57.120
Like the writing, the code isn't hard.

34:57.120 --> 35:01.520
It's figuring, like figuring out, I don't know, like should these models be coupled

35:01.520 --> 35:04.760
together as a join in the database?

35:04.760 --> 35:05.760
Maybe not.

35:05.760 --> 35:06.760
Maybe locations and doors are different.

35:06.760 --> 35:07.760
Right?

35:07.760 --> 35:12.880
Like maybe, I don't know, maybe like what we call a car or a vehicle needs to be called

35:12.880 --> 35:13.880
a truck.

35:13.880 --> 35:14.880
What is a truck?

35:14.880 --> 35:15.880
What constitutes an SUV?

35:15.880 --> 35:20.960
Maybe we're working for an auto dealer is do we care about fighter jets versus bombers?

35:20.960 --> 35:24.520
Is this the client going to come back and say, Hey man, awesome windows app.

35:24.520 --> 35:25.520
Can I get it on my iPad?

35:25.520 --> 35:26.520
Right?

35:26.520 --> 35:30.040
Like there's a million things that can go wrong and none of them are, I can't write

35:30.040 --> 35:32.280
a for loop fast enough.

35:32.280 --> 35:34.640
So I don't know.

35:34.640 --> 35:35.640
Yes.

35:35.640 --> 35:36.640
Yes.

35:36.640 --> 35:37.640
Yeah.

35:37.640 --> 35:38.640
I completely agree.

35:38.640 --> 35:43.000
I guess this is one of those things I feel like we should at least keep our eye on in

35:43.000 --> 35:44.000
case.

35:44.000 --> 35:45.000
Oh, absolutely.

35:45.000 --> 35:46.680
Just to see where it goes.

35:46.680 --> 35:48.500
Just maybe, maybe it gets better.

35:48.500 --> 35:51.780
I could see them improving it over time as more and more users start using it.

35:51.780 --> 35:54.760
I'm curious if like the EFF or somebody is going to sue them.

35:54.760 --> 35:58.200
That's see, that's where I think this is going to go.

35:58.200 --> 36:04.040
I suppose if you could, if you could demonstrate that somebody was reproducing GPL code essentially

36:04.040 --> 36:09.080
and then licensing it as something else like MIT, maybe it's not GPL, but they, or I don't

36:09.080 --> 36:13.360
think it's GPL, but they did reproduce the doom source code verbatim, right?

36:13.360 --> 36:17.680
In comments at all.

36:17.680 --> 36:22.440
Our friends over to Cloud Guru have a lot of, a lot of options for you to check out,

36:22.440 --> 36:25.880
but this week I want to mention their Ansible best practices.

36:25.880 --> 36:30.120
Now this is part of a Red Hat certified specialist program, and it's going to teach you everything

36:30.120 --> 36:35.520
you know about Ansible and Ansible Tower, and as well as get you ready for an exam on

36:35.520 --> 36:36.520
the topic.

36:36.520 --> 36:40.800
So go over to our show notes at coder.show slash 422.

36:40.800 --> 36:44.520
You'll see the ACG link in there and that'll take you directly to this course.

36:44.520 --> 36:48.060
If you're planning on expanding your Ansible knowledge, you probably ought to check this

36:48.060 --> 36:52.600
particular course out and all the other great courses over to Cloud Guru will have a link

36:52.600 --> 36:59.020
for this one in particular at coder.show slash 422.

36:59.020 --> 37:04.040
So speaking of Visual Studio code, how has the Live Share experience been going for you?

37:04.040 --> 37:09.000
I know you were, I think you mentioned you were just starting to use that a bit and wondering

37:09.000 --> 37:10.000
if you have any updates.

37:10.000 --> 37:11.000
Yep.

37:11.000 --> 37:13.200
We've been using it for about a month and it has been fabulous.

37:13.200 --> 37:17.480
For those who don't know Live Share, how do we call this like a super, it's not really

37:17.480 --> 37:18.480
a screen share.

37:18.480 --> 37:19.480
It's like a...

37:19.480 --> 37:21.640
And it's not, it's kind of like Google Docs but inside VS Code.

37:21.640 --> 37:22.640
That's exactly right.

37:22.640 --> 37:24.060
Google Docs.

37:24.060 --> 37:25.920
But the key is, so I can give you a perfect case.

37:25.920 --> 37:31.880
We had two guys, I was not one of the guys in this case, but one on Mac and one on Linux

37:31.880 --> 37:38.560
and the Linux guy had the tool chain set up to actually build the code, the Mac guy didn't.

37:38.560 --> 37:44.200
He was just coming into rubber ducky, second set of eyes.

37:44.200 --> 37:48.960
He could hit F5, which is the shortcut in VS Code to build, and it built off of the

37:48.960 --> 37:52.960
other guy's machine using his dependent, he didn't have to install all the dependencies.

37:52.960 --> 37:57.560
But the code in his editor, it's Python, so the formatting's, it's the same.

37:57.560 --> 38:05.080
But his key bindings, his color scheme, everything the way he wants in his VS Code, but the dependency

38:05.080 --> 38:07.360
chain was from the other guy's machine.

38:07.360 --> 38:08.360
That's awesome.

38:08.360 --> 38:14.240
And they were live editing like Trista's Google Docs style, the code, running through it.

38:14.240 --> 38:16.320
It makes me wonder if we could use it for show prep.

38:16.320 --> 38:17.320
That's so nice.

38:17.320 --> 38:20.920
And so it seems like it, it seems like it's, I mean, for that kind of collaboration, it's

38:20.920 --> 38:24.400
gotta be pretty quick, pretty accurate.

38:24.400 --> 38:26.240
Well pretty quick, and it has voice calling.

38:26.240 --> 38:29.440
So you're talking to the person on the same connection.

38:29.440 --> 38:30.440
Really?

38:30.440 --> 38:31.440
Yeah, that's what it was.

38:31.440 --> 38:32.440
What?

38:32.440 --> 38:33.440
No way.

38:33.440 --> 38:34.440
Really?

38:34.440 --> 38:35.440
That's pretty neat.

38:35.440 --> 38:36.440
I've done a few myself.

38:36.440 --> 38:37.440
It's like, okay, what file are you in?

38:37.440 --> 38:38.440
Wow.

38:38.440 --> 38:40.760
I'm going through, I'm going through the page that we'll have link.

38:40.760 --> 38:41.760
Oh yeah.

38:41.760 --> 38:42.760
Look at that.

38:42.760 --> 38:45.880
This is, this is, oh man, they're unstoppable.

38:45.880 --> 38:49.840
You know how, you know how I've been going on about, about Apple, well geez, well Microsoft

38:49.840 --> 38:51.960
is just crushing this area right now.

38:51.960 --> 38:57.080
It really, and then you consider the whole GitHub angle of all of this.

38:57.080 --> 38:58.880
This is some powerful, powerful stuff.

38:58.880 --> 39:06.240
And then, and how long, how long have we been waiting for local applications?

39:06.240 --> 39:09.720
Well call it native, even though it's an Electron app, native applications with this kind of

39:09.720 --> 39:13.360
functionality where you could break out of your web browser and you didn't like, you

39:13.360 --> 39:17.200
didn't have to be in a web app to get real time collab like that.

39:17.200 --> 39:18.760
And we should, we should add an important point here.

39:18.760 --> 39:20.440
You mentioned a Electron.

39:20.440 --> 39:25.800
So this also crosses the streams between a VS proper on windows and VS code.

39:25.800 --> 39:26.800
So what do you mean?

39:26.800 --> 39:28.180
So you can cross the sessions.

39:28.180 --> 39:32.920
So I can be on VS code on my Mac and someone can be on a windows 10 running visual studio

39:32.920 --> 39:34.680
19 and that's fine.

39:34.680 --> 39:35.760
Oh, okay.

39:35.760 --> 39:36.760
That's nice too.

39:36.760 --> 39:37.760
Huh?

39:37.760 --> 39:39.100
Look at them.

39:39.100 --> 39:41.680
They're just knocking down walls and barriers.

39:41.680 --> 39:43.120
I'm going to have to give live share a try.

39:43.120 --> 39:46.120
We'll have a link in the show notes and you know, anything we talk about in the show,

39:46.120 --> 39:47.640
we always love to get your guys' feedback.

39:47.640 --> 39:51.080
So when you go over to the website, you'll have the contact link there too.

39:51.080 --> 39:54.680
Shout out to our Coder QA members out there who helped make this show possible.

39:54.680 --> 39:57.920
You're going to get a new Coderly soon that's coming up.

39:57.920 --> 40:03.480
And if you haven't joined our membership program over at Coder QA.co, you could join now and

40:03.480 --> 40:06.760
get access to all the previous Coderlys and then you'll get the upcoming one.

40:06.760 --> 40:09.720
We do one a quarter and I've already got a couple of topics set aside.

40:09.720 --> 40:11.680
I haven't, I haven't shared what they are yet.

40:11.680 --> 40:15.680
And so we'll, Mike and I will sync up before we record, but I got a couple ideas, but also

40:15.680 --> 40:17.840
you get access to our limited ad feed as a member.

40:17.840 --> 40:20.100
It's a new RSS feed that we generate just for you.

40:20.100 --> 40:26.280
It's a bespoke feed and it's a, it's still the full production from Dr. Drew, just a

40:26.280 --> 40:27.280
limited ads.

40:27.280 --> 40:33.040
So you get all of that as a thank you over at Coder QA.co and thanks to our members.

40:33.040 --> 40:37.640
I just have one last thing I just wanted to touch on in the show before we leave because

40:37.640 --> 40:43.000
both you and I had been watching this drama play out and the Pentagon has officially killed

40:43.000 --> 40:45.720
this $10 billion Jedi cloud contract.

40:45.720 --> 40:49.580
And I feel like this is actually probably the biggest tech story of the last few years

40:49.580 --> 40:50.840
that nobody's talking about.

40:50.840 --> 40:53.480
I mean, it was weird how they got the contracts.

40:53.480 --> 40:54.480
Yeah.

40:54.480 --> 40:56.000
It's weird how it got killed.

40:56.000 --> 40:58.480
I don't get, and I don't think the story's done.

40:58.480 --> 41:00.000
I think we're going back to court.

41:00.000 --> 41:01.640
Amazon was so all in.

41:01.640 --> 41:04.800
So when they thought they had this thing, I think it was before Trump came into office

41:04.800 --> 41:10.640
and Amazon was so all in, they built a second headquarters out in that area to just kind

41:10.640 --> 41:14.040
of make them closer to the, to the heart of the operation.

41:14.040 --> 41:17.160
And then Trump and Bezos had a, some sort of feud, I think because of the Washington,

41:17.160 --> 41:18.160
I don't know.

41:18.160 --> 41:19.640
The Washington post, right?

41:19.640 --> 41:20.640
Post.

41:20.640 --> 41:21.640
Yeah.

41:21.640 --> 41:22.640
Yeah.

41:22.640 --> 41:25.440
Anyways, so the contract ends up getting canceled maybe for better or for worse.

41:25.440 --> 41:30.400
I mean, I've never been very happy with the idea that these private companies have these

41:30.400 --> 41:32.440
$10 billion contracts with the defense industry.

41:32.440 --> 41:34.440
It just felt whatever.

41:34.440 --> 41:38.040
But I mean, I can think of one that would love a $10 billion contract.

41:38.040 --> 41:39.040
Yeah.

41:39.040 --> 41:40.040
No kidding.

41:40.040 --> 41:41.040
Right?

41:41.040 --> 41:42.760
If they need a podcast contract, let me know.

41:42.760 --> 41:46.120
So then Microsoft ends up getting the deal.

41:46.120 --> 41:48.520
Microsoft starts building up and staffing up for it.

41:48.520 --> 41:49.520
You know?

41:49.520 --> 41:53.520
I mean, can you imagine a 10 bill, even for a company like Microsoft, $10 billion deal,

41:53.520 --> 41:56.620
you're staffing up, you're building out office space for that deal.

41:56.620 --> 42:00.760
This is going to be like an aspect of your business for years.

42:00.760 --> 42:04.240
And then the Pentagon calls up just a couple of weeks ago and says, we're actually going

42:04.240 --> 42:08.960
to exercise that cancellation clause that we had etched in there at the last minute.

42:08.960 --> 42:10.260
We're out.

42:10.260 --> 42:16.700
And then it turns out in the background, there has basically been a Bezos led lawsuit and

42:16.700 --> 42:20.340
legal challenge against this entire thing.

42:20.340 --> 42:22.920
Basically putting it all on Trump and saying, you know, it's because he doesn't like me

42:22.920 --> 42:25.560
that this whole thing got canceled.

42:25.560 --> 42:29.640
And it seems like that thing is proceeding and it's created this wedge and the Pentagon

42:29.640 --> 42:32.180
use that opportunity to cancel this whole damn thing.

42:32.180 --> 42:36.320
And the reason why I think it's noteworthy is because whichever cloud provider ends up

42:36.320 --> 42:41.640
with this, and now maybe several of them, is essentially going to get an indefinite

42:41.640 --> 42:43.360
paycheck from the federal government.

42:43.360 --> 42:49.080
Like that cloud provider is set for life because it's not like they're going to build out infrastructure

42:49.080 --> 42:50.640
and then canceled a few years later.

42:50.640 --> 42:55.720
So it's one of those things where I think they desperately want it because it's it's

42:55.720 --> 43:00.820
a 10 billion dollar paycheck that's just going to keep paying out indefinitely.

43:00.820 --> 43:02.160
It's a huge story.

43:02.160 --> 43:05.840
The tech CEOs have gotten really powerful, too.

43:05.840 --> 43:12.560
You know, Tim Cook, Colin, Nancy Bezos maneuvering this, you know, Pichai Pichai was working

43:12.560 --> 43:14.960
with the White House on that acquisition of TikTok.

43:14.960 --> 43:18.840
Like that was so weird, though, that they were just going to hand them and the White

43:18.840 --> 43:25.640
House is just going to hand Microsoft an acquisition and like the tech CEOs are they're like the

43:25.640 --> 43:29.760
big oil executives now only to have these cool guy personas.

43:29.760 --> 43:30.760
Most of them.

43:30.760 --> 43:31.760
Well, maybe.

43:31.760 --> 43:32.760
Maybe not.

43:32.760 --> 43:33.760
Yeah.

43:33.760 --> 43:35.120
I mean, this is a bigger, bigger conversation for a different day.

43:35.120 --> 43:40.720
I mean, something has definitely changed in just our industry, right?

43:40.720 --> 43:42.920
I mean, it's interesting to see the oil companies.

43:42.920 --> 43:44.560
I think of it as the railroads.

43:44.560 --> 43:45.560
Right.

43:45.560 --> 43:46.560
That's better.

43:46.560 --> 43:47.560
That's a better analogy.

43:47.560 --> 43:48.560
Right.

43:48.560 --> 43:49.560
I mean, you're at a great rate.

43:49.560 --> 43:54.320
You're taxed effectively to the big tech companies, if you're at all in the technology space.

43:54.320 --> 43:57.880
And even if you're not right, even if you're in a different business, you're kicking up

43:57.880 --> 43:58.880
to somebody.

43:58.880 --> 43:59.880
Fair point.

43:59.880 --> 44:03.040
Well, good luck on phase one of the moving.

44:03.040 --> 44:04.800
I'm the only person moving to New Jersey.

44:04.800 --> 44:06.840
This should be interesting.

44:06.840 --> 44:09.460
Is there anything you want to mention before we get out of here?

44:09.460 --> 44:14.660
If you need Python development done and or especially Objective C development, reach

44:14.660 --> 44:16.320

44:16.320 --> 44:17.320
Absolutely.

44:17.320 --> 44:21.440

44:26.880 --> 44:29.560
