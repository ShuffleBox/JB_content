00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
This is KOTOR Radio, episode 481 for August 29th, 2022.

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Hey good buddy, welcome back to Jupiter Broadcasting's weekly talk show, taking a pragmatic look at the art and the business of software development and the world of technology.

3
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:31,000
My name is Chris, and our con-surviving hero, it's our host, Mr. Dominic. Hello Mike!

4
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Hello, I am plane-shifted back from what used to be called Dominaria.

5
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Okay, how you feeling? Do you have any weird symptoms?

6
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Nope, I'm feeling okay. I have to say, I had a great time.

7
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:59,000
For those who don't, and you should religiously follow my Twitter, but for those who are blasphemers, I was at the Tampa TGC Con, and it was glorious. It was quite packed.

8
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Was it?

9
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Yeah, for something of a, I know people hate when I say this, but second city to Miami in the state of Florida.

10
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Are you rocking a Starry Night shirt?

11
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
It is a Mario Starry Night shirt, yes.

12
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Wait, you're saying it's Mario art on there in the Starry Night theme?

13
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Yes, I have a bunch of them. I wear them to...

14
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Oh, you weren't lying. You went full geek.

15
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Oh, I do. I'm going to the prerelease this weekend for Magic, and I have a couple options. I have a Brutalist painted Sonic shirt.

16
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I have a similar Starry Night themed Wind Waker shirt. Actually, that's more like the Japanese watercolor style painting.

17
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Oh my goodness.

18
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I have a shirt that is just the original Zelda NES map printed on one of them. They're all like Hawaiian style shirts, right?

19
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Nice.

20
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Yeah, and I have a bunch of coding nerd shirts that I bought for non-gaming stuff, conventions.

21
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Good for you. One time I went on Amazon, and I looked for a bunch of shirts that I could find that were like $14, and that was my price target, and then I just added like a dozen of them, and now I just rotate through them.

22
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:14,000
My wife wants me to do it too. I have seriously, seriously, seriously been thinking about doing the uniform lifestyle.

23
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Really, Steve Jobs?

24
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Yeah. I think part of the reason I haven't done it is because I don't want to get called Steve Jobs.

25
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:29,000
But no, it's like I wake up sometimes in the morning, like today is a perfect example.

26
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I was woken up at 5, and so I just got up, and it was still dark. I didn't want to wake anybody else up.

27
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:45,000
And so I got dressed in the dark. I combed my hair in the dark, and then I get to work, and I'm like, oh, you can really tell I got dressed in the dark. I really did. It just wasn't great.

28
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:58,000
And so if I had just the same thing I wore every single day, the other thing is, because I got a belly, I'm dropping food on my shirts all the time, depending on where I'm sitting.

29
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:06,000
The casualty rate on the shirts, it's way damn high. It's too damn high. It's too damn high. I don't have a great success rate at recovering them either.

30
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:14,000
And so I have a lot of fallen soldiers in that regard. And so a uniform would just allow me to batch buy.

31
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I could buy five shirts at a time, five whatever at a time, and I just can't find anything that I think would look okay enough to do that.

32
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Honestly, if anybody has any suggestions, boost it in or go to the contact page. Seriously, let me know what's worked for you. I just can't even anymore.

33
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:42,000
I like it. Yeah, I also have the same everything. You can tell what I had for lunch by two o'clock issue.

34
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I'm worried that my wife wants me to do it because she's sick of me complaining I have nothing to wear.

35
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:54,000
But at the same time, I think she'd get bored. So I'd have to honestly couldn't do it all the time, but at least for work or something.

36
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:59,000
I mean, as long as it's a black, you know, turtleneck and blue jeans, I think you're well on your way.

37
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Like some white sneakers, maybe. You know, so recently I raised concerns about the Coder Radio mascot and the union.

38
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Those things have mostly settled in favor of the union for now. But the Coder Radio mascot hit me up on Twitter and wanted to remind me there's some big advantages to having a podcast mascot.

39
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:23,000
And I just thought, you know what, this is new. We should probably get this settled because the shows, you know, we've reached a new era where we have a mascot.

40
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:29,000
He says, imagine the next podcast convention you're at. So there was just one podcast movement in Dallas last week.

41
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:37,000
You walk up to a fellow podcaster, maybe you don't particularly like them, and you just casually ask them, how's your podcast mascot doing?

42
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:43,000
When he admits he doesn't have a podcast mascot. Well, you could turn around and discussed.

43
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:48,000
And a sorrow face and just walk away and shake in your head. What has the world come to?

44
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:55,000
He doesn't even have a podcast mascot. That's a great point. It's something we can lord over all other podcasts.

45
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Those jerks at Linux Unplugged don't have a podcast mascot.

46
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,000
It's true. My inner union buster is still kind of...

47
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
There's some advantages, though, I feel like, you know.

48
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
There are advantages, yeah.

49
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
It's like only big time podcasts have mascots.

50
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
That's true.

51
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Yeah.

52
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Well, I feel like the mascot could be like, you know, like our vice president, the attack dog.

53
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Sure. Yeah. Yeah. Like could lead the fight if somebody's coming at us, you know, trolls on Twitter. Sure.

54
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Like, I think we all need a little dick in our life. And by that, I mean Dick Cheney.

55
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Snuck at Wilde.

56
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
No, I knew what you meant.

57
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I mean, who doesn't need a Dick Cheney?

58
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I mean, Liz Cheney did.

59
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Apparently Liz didn't.

60
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Oh, right there.

61
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Didn't help at all.

62
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Poor Liz.

63
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
What a way to go.

64
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Oh, man. Embarrassing. I don't think we've seen the last of her.

65
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Yeah. So, notes on the con, though, real quick, right?

66
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Oh, yeah.

67
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,000
The level of... I've been to a few of these things in my life. Just a few.

68
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:55,000
And the level of enthusiasm, the general friendliness, although I will say if you wear a super nerdy shirt,

69
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,000
people automatically talk to you because they're like, where the hell did you get that?

70
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Sure.

71
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:10,000
I have not seen a con quite this for like a small... This was the first one ever, too, for TCG Con in Tampa.

72
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:15,000
So, I've not seen something blow up like this in a while. And I think that's just that pent-up COVID.

73
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Like people just want to get the hell out.

74
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Hungry for it. And if you're an event that is willing to take a little risk, you can take advantage of that right now.

75
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:28,000
I've heard that about a lot of the recent events is that, man, it was like the first time again for a lot of people.

76
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:33,000
I get that. I think, unfortunately, my beloved Linux fest, Northwest, is going to miss out on a lot of that hype.

77
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
We'll see.

78
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:40,000
So, you know, we got an email in from a listener who I guess I did not grab their name, so I apologize about that.

79
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:47,000
But they had a great point. They say, you know, here's the thing about the remote work is it really comes down to the worker

80
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
and the type of work they're doing.

81
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
So, he says, I'd like to make a distinction.

82
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:59,000
If you're an SME, say like a system matter expert, then working remotely is great because everyone comes to you.

83
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:05,000
But if you're not a matter or a topic expert, then you have to make the greater effort to maintain a connection with others.

84
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:11,000
I've been working remotely since 2017, and I hate it because I am a jack of all trades, master of none type.

85
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Little things I used to do every day at work to help others get their stuff done are no longer part of my shtick.

86
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:21,000
As a result, I have to work harder when I'm remote in order to accomplish the same tasks.

87
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
That's interesting.

88
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
He says he has a little bit of formula down here in the email.

89
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:33,000
I feel like there should be an A percent B percent balance between at work and at home where A and B differs for different people and types of work.

90
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Hybrid.

91
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Although I hate the name hybrid for some reason, I don't know about you.

92
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
I can't stand hybrid work.

93
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
It feels weird.

94
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,000
It's like it's trying to be, I don't know, like techie, like hybrid cars or hybrid development.

95
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Like, why do we got to label it, man?

96
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Why can't it be like, you know, you just come in on the days you need to come in and you just work at home on the days that you feel like you do more and better work at home.

97
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
And as long as the work gets done, that's all that matters.

98
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Like, why can't they get there?

99
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
I mean, I know.

100
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I know why.

101
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,000
But I'm just expressing my frustration as it just seems like that's all it would take.

102
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:15,000
It's also super weird because like, particularly from a small business perspective, office space that isn't like super, you know, awful is really expensive.

103
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Yeah.

104
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,000
And those leases are very tough to get out of if the landlord chooses to make it so.

105
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Yeah, that could be multi-year.

106
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Yeah.

107
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
I don't know why you would ever take, you know what I mean?

108
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,000
I don't know why you would ever take the halfway route when there are so many better options.

109
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Let's say if you guys do need to meet up like once a week or twice a month, just sign up for WeWork, do some kombucha.

110
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
You'll be fine.

111
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Like, it's cool.

112
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Yeah, get together somewhere.

113
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,000
You know, if this was during the pandemic, the metaverse would come up right now.

114
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
That's where we'd mention the metaverse.

115
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:50,000
But now that we've sobered up a little bit, people don't seem to be talking about it too much.

116
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Okay, moving on.

117
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:59,000
D writes in, when I was young, I thought it was so leet to live in my key bindings for Tmux and Vim and never touch the mouse.

118
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:07,000
But now, as I get older, using the mouse is just simply the least painful way to use a computer and make a living.

119
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,000
I was curious how your RSI is doing.

120
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
I don't think we've had an RSI update on the show.

121
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
We haven't.

122
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
It's been better.

123
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:21,000
A lot of it is I'm aggressively like, I have one of those autonomous standing desks.

124
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:26,000
So I kind of have, you know, I went through the whole period where I basically optimized the crap out of everything.

125
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,000
I will say using the keyboard that's sitting up a little higher.

126
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,000
I'm using the big launch has helped.

127
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Not using the same keyboard every day helps because I switch between, you know, this and the MacBook and the dev one.

128
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Yeah, pretty good.

129
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
I mean, how about you?

130
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Better.

131
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
I mean, I've done a couple of things like you.

132
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,000
I've focused on better keyboards.

133
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,000
And I think since I started doing that, it's been a lot better as a baseline.

134
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,000
I also got a standing desk, so I kind of rotate through that.

135
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
And then I started taking magnesium every single night.

136
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
I think that's helped a little bit.

137
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:08,000
The other thing that I did, this is going to get us kicked off of YouTube and canceled, but I'll take a few kratom red when I'm hurting.

138
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:16,000
And it helps in a way that ibuprofen and other pain medicines do not seem to help because it seems to like actually keep the inflation down at bay.

139
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:23,000
So if I like take three a night for a few nights, it pretty much clears it up for a while for me.

140
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,000
And that's been a really nice kind of alternative.

141
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
And, you know, finding stuff that is decent.

142
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:34,000
And I know that's one of those things that people can get go get crazy with and all of that.

143
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
So you have to kind of, you know, know yourself.

144
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,000
But the combination of all of that stuff.

145
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:44,000
And I think, you know, also staying trying to stay more hydrated and trying to get sleep has helped.

146
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:50,000
I can still have a bad RSI flare up if I'm editing a lot because that just I stay really super tense.

147
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:56,000
But if I remind myself and I mean, it's easier to do this when I'm just doing my regular work to just kind of loosen up stretch and that kind of stuff.

148
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
It helps as well.

149
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:05,000
So, yeah, if everybody else has some great tips or tricks, let us know or is always happy to pass that wisdom on.

150
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:13,000
And then I wanted to cover some of the Google feedback that we got kind of all in one batch because we talked last week about Google's 1984 moment.

151
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:21,000
We all kind of remember, truly, truly chilling when Google flagged that dad's account for taking pictures of his son's medical issue.

152
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:27,000
They auto batched up his Google history, which he had in it since the early aughts, about 15 years worth.

153
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:34,000
They automatically sent that to the cops and then they banned him permanently from the Google platform, including shutting down his cell service.

154
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Not to mention just kind of labeling him as a child predator.

155
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:46,000
And he's not the only one. The New York Times also highlighted another case that recently happened and it ended up interrupting the guy's mortgage negotiation process.

156
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:50,000
So we did get some reactions from that in the boost.

157
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:55,000
We got three thousand sats from he he told me how to say this.

158
00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:01,000
I say wooden, but it's like wooden wooden 501 boosted with three thousand sats.

159
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Google's actions will have serious life altering effects for people.

160
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Teachers, daycare workers, anyone who works with children's folks with federal security clearances that would probably be revoked in the short term.

161
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:20,000
While the investigation proceeds, those types of people, all those people could lose their jobs as a result, even if they're completely innocent of any wrongdoing.

162
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:28,000
I feel this seeking out new photos instead of just matching known photos is a step too far, causing more harm than good.

163
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,000
I'm curious if that's the line for you.

164
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:36,000
You know, the CSAM database is known photos. This is based on new stuff.

165
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:43,000
The idea being that and the reason why they auto batch and send stuff to the police, the rationale is.

166
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:50,000
There's still an opportunity to intervene and save a child and catch a predator in the act.

167
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,000
If we identify new stuff, if we're just going off of old stuff, it's probably too late.

168
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Yeah, I mean, it's too late, but not for everything.

169
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Well, is it too late? I don't know that. Let's see.

170
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:07,000
There's so many strong, strong assumptions either way, right?

171
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Because you could argue if they have even the old stuff, then that's probably somebody who should be flagged and investigated.

172
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:21,000
And I mean, if you have the system, I would imagine these guys don't they don't, you know, just wake up on a Tuesday and be like, I'm going to do this right.

173
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Yeah. But that said, though, I am I know, you know, we've had discussions in the past that I am more open to the Save the Children argument than you are.

174
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:36,000
But this just is wild. I mean, the.

175
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:44,000
You know, I feel like with the harder the response by the authorities, the more the Save the Children argument.

176
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:48,000
You have to kind of measure it on a curve. I see what you're saying.

177
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Because this was. Yeah, I mean, there's two separate things. Can a private company cut you off from their service?

178
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Yeah, they can. I mean, should they?

179
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:11,000
I guess they can do whatever they want. Right. And I totally understand the perspective we got from other people that, well, Google's got to like limit their liability, which, yes.

180
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Right. Of course.

181
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:28,000
But she's the fact that this guy with with no knowledge until the police decided to investigate, tell him that they were investigating him, just got his life turned upside down for actually trying to be a good parent.

182
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Yeah. And just taking advantage of telemedicine, which a ton of people have been pushed into.

183
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Well, that's the part that kind of chaps my ass, because, you know, during Covid, I've used Teladoc.

184
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:42,000
It's a telemedicine app a couple of times. I use it for my son.

185
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:54,000
It's a big industry now. And frankly, I'm, you know, for practical reasons, medical reasons, I don't like to go to like hospitals right now because, you know, where am I going to more likely pick up Covid?

186
00:14:54,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Right. People who are like really, really sick. I just I just can't imagine that like if the doctor says to my to my boy, all right, buddy, I got to see like if you have a rash or something that I should, you know, lose all my digital stuff and prepare myself for the FBI.

187
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:22,000
The local police to show up that that seems wild. There should be some sort of like like there's a reason no one's arresting pediatricians for for like touching children because it's their damn job.

188
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Right. It's a medical procedure. And this is just getting an opinion for tens of thousands of years.

189
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Right. And every parent knows that like you get a doctor you trust and you basically trust that doctor implicitly with your kid's life and everything and you assume nothing's going to happen.

190
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:46,000
And we trust our phones, for better or for worse, that we we I think people maybe they don't even realize it, but kind of like at a low level, it's an extension of their brain more so than they want to admit.

191
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:52,000
The problem, actually, now that I think about it, the problem is we have an exception really for anything.

192
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Right. You could tell like your doctor can't testify, you know, about your medical conditions or anything.

193
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:13,000
And that's completely privileged, completely secret here in the States. But the minute it goes into the minute it's on your digital systems, I guess you waive doctor patient privilege effectively or it seems it seems like there should be.

194
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:20,000
And maybe there is interesting if you're working on this listener to write in some sort of.

195
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:29,000
App, I mean, maybe Teladoc is that app and maybe. But still, he just put it and it automatically saved to his photos and sync to Google Photos. And that's like.

196
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:36,000
It just seems so hard core. It just seems so. Kind of zero to one hundred.

197
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:50,000
And like, like, goddamn, no time automatic. This dude. And, you know, we've all we've all been there. Those of us who have kids where your kid is acting ill. Something's weird. You kind of go into a.

198
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:56,000
And especially in the age of pandemics, you go into a bit of a panic and you're not thinking four steps ahead.

199
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:10,000
You know, is is some some, you know, probably offshore or probably low paid contract contractor who just looks at tens of thousands of images a day going to just kind of wrote spam this and the cops are going to show up.

200
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Yeah, it's going to be a low effort thing. And I hate the fact that, you know, Google's automatically displaying it to some person somewhere, probably some offshore place, which even if they don't flag it is just a horrible violation of your and your child's privacy in this case.

201
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:33,000
You can also be forgiven for just a cute moment. You know, the mother of my kids and I are separated. And so we've you know, for years we've shared pictures back and forth of moments at the pool or whatever.

202
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Like there's just you know, it's just we share a lot of photos back and forth because, you know, one of us isn't there for some moment very frequently.

203
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:48,000
And so, you know, we're just totally in a trap now. And I think Trevdev boosted with two thousand stats sort of feeling the same.

204
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:53,000
He says, thanks for the Google PSA. My wife and I adopted Google Photos when our daughter was born.

205
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Our whole family enjoys a shared album and it has a bunch of great features for that.

206
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Now I have to go on all of them about them or maybe my daughter when they handle their devices, because you're right.

207
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:08,000
These accusations are enough to destroy lives.

208
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:18,000
And that's just it. And also, the more publicity this stuff gets, the more the messages sent out to the offenders, you know, don't use Google Photos.

209
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:23,000
So the only people that don't really hear it are people who don't think they have anything to hide and they end up getting sucked into this.

210
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:27,000
And Marcel boosted with two thousand stats. I don't want to live on this planet anymore.

211
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:31,000
But here's what I'm curious about. How did Google train this model?

212
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:41,000
You can train with hashes, but somebody eventually had to train this thing to identify new body parts and new aspects.

213
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:50,000
And you think about the work that Google paid people to do or hired from some some company where they paid people to do.

214
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:54,000
I don't like where that goes quick. Like that's the other element of this.

215
00:18:54,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Maybe the tech company should just stay out of all this, because if you think about how dark this gets for them to actually be able to have this ability, the kind of things that they had to do and the things that people had to look at.

216
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Maybe they should have just stayed out of all of this. Maybe they could have built these systems so they just never routed through their servers to begin with or something.

217
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:16,000
I don't know. Right. But that would defeat many of their commercial goals.

218
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Google photos. I know. But when you think about how they train this model, doesn't it just disgust you when you start to think of the likely ways they accomplish that task?

219
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Yeah, I mean, well, they've admitted this, right?

220
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Like years ago, there used to be a team at Google that basically their job was to delist some of the more horrific stuff.

221
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,000
I think that's definitely...

222
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:42,000
It's an element of it I just don't like. So I have something to kind of pick up the mood.

223
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Listener Jacob tweeted at you and I suggesting that maybe it was time to look at iOS 16 on the iPad now that the latest beta is here.

224
00:19:49,000 --> 00:20:00,000
And so I gave it a really quick look. I have a 2018 iPad Pro, and I guess that doesn't get to have the new fancy stage manager stuff or whatever it's called.

225
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:07,000
So I'm a little disappointed in that. But there is one feature in iOS 16 that I really like.

226
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:12,000
I think the new lock screen looks good, too. But have you had an opportunity to play around with the new beta that came out?

227
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:21,000
I have not on an iPad for the very, very lame reason that I'm currently doing a production iPad project and don't want to update it.

228
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Oh, sure. Yeah, that makes sense.

229
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:31,000
Yeah, I have an iPad. And the kind of most production thing that I use it for is when I'm driving my RV.

230
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:41,000
I have an ODB to plug that plugs into the diagnostic port for the truck engine and over Wi-Fi that streams all kinds of data to my iPad that I log and display.

231
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:48,000
And so I find that to actually be useful and valuable, but it generally doesn't break between upgrades.

232
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:54,000
So I went ahead and took the plunge and I put iOS 16 on the iPad, which sounds like Apple is going to delay the final release.

233
00:20:54,000 --> 00:21:04,000
So I wouldn't expect a lot of changes. I don't know. I think they're they're focusing on the phone release for a bit and then they're going to come back to iPad OS.

234
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:11,000
But there's an aspect in iPad OS and in iOS that I am so happy to see.

235
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:18,000
So I am the family manager in my iCloud shared family setup with the kids and my wife.

236
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:22,000
I'm the person that set that up. And so I don't know if this is available for all of them,

237
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:30,000
but it's available for me now is I can now in the family area see the subscriptions for everyone's iCloud accounts.

238
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:37,000
This is a big deal because I understand previously you had to go to each effing device or account,

239
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:40,000
look on their device and see what their subscriptions were.

240
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:45,000
I had no way of reviewing all of their subscriptions, even though I'm the one paying for them.

241
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:49,000
It was charging my flipping account, but I couldn't even tell you by email.

242
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:54,000
I couldn't I'd look at the receipts. There was no metadata to tell me whose subscription was what.

243
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,000
And of course, some of these things are atrocious scams.

244
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:00,000
And so you want to track it down as fast as possible.

245
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,000
And I just like keeping an eye on all these subscriptions as we talked about last episode.

246
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,000
You got to, you know, you got to make sure you're keeping tabs on these things.

247
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:15,000
And sure enough, now all your accounts in the family plan can be reviewed in one spot in iOS.

248
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:20,000
Whoo. Praise Jobs. That right there, in my opinion, is worth the upgrade.

249
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:25,000
Well, you're about to put on the the uniform. So praise Jobs indeed.

250
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Yeah, right. I'm slipping into a hole, man. Save me.

251
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:35,000
I just want to say you remember that it's a cult, right? Just just a friendly reminder.

252
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Yeah. And we do have our indoctrination tour coming up along the West Coast.

253
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:45,000
Meetup.com slash Jupiter Broadcasting. We now have the venues locked in.

254
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:55,000
And thanks to our West Coast crew in our matrix chat room, we managed to find awesome breweries for every city we're stopping in.

255
00:22:55,000 --> 00:23:01,000
So it's a brewery tour. We didn't even plan for that, but it just makes so much sense in retrospect.

256
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:06,000
So the details are there now at meetup.com slash Jupiter Broadcasting.

257
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:10,000
And we have selected the names. I announced them in Linux Unplugged.

258
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:16,000
But I'm also going to write out send out emails today as I record, which is Monday, the twenty ninth.

259
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:24,000
I will send out emails to folks who've had their name selected to join us at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory tour on September twenty ninth.

260
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:30,000
So we have southern Oregon. We're going to have a meetup, northern California, southern California.

261
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:35,000
And then on our way back up the coast, we're going to do a meetup in Portland.

262
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:38,000
So all of those are at meetup.com slash Jupiter Broadcasting.

263
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:43,000
Get your names in now if you're going because we want to let the venues know about how many people to expect.

264
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:47,000
I don't know if it's going to be huge, too. So if you're not a big crowd person, I wouldn't worry about it.

265
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:50,000
I don't think these are going to be like two hundred people meetups.

266
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:54,000
I think these are going to be like ten, twenty, thirty people meetups, maybe smaller depending on the venue.

267
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,000
So let us know. Meetup.com slash Jupiter Broadcasting.

268
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:07,000
And then we have that West Coast crew at BIT.LY slash West Coast Crew.

269
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:12,000
Linode.com slash Coder. Go there to get a hundred dollars in 60 day credit on a new account.

270
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,000
And it's just a great way to support the show while you're checking something out.

271
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:19,000
Linode is fast, reliable cloud hosting. You got to try it for your next project.

272
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:24,000
It's what we're using for our new website. It's what we use for any of the infrastructure we've built in nearly the last three years.

273
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:30,000
And now that Linode has been rolling out MVME storage, I feel like my rigs just got a silent upgrade.

274
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:34,000
I didn't even realize it'd be available on some of the systems I already had deployed.

275
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:38,000
That's one of the things I love about Linode is when I come on here and I tell you about new features.

276
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,000
A lot of times they just give you that upgrade. They'll just work it in.

277
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:49,000
You know, just this half year alone, they've rolled out multiple databases of service platforms, MVME storage, the new AMD EPYC CPUs.

278
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:56,000
And of course, there are 11 data centers around the world have the best Internet connection possible because Linode is their own ISP.

279
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
That's it. And they've been doing this for nearly 19 years.

280
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:05,000
And they really know how to dial it in because that 19 years has been made possible by the quality of their product,

281
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:12,000
not by VC money injections that are just throwing money into a hole, but by the quality of their product selling.

282
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,000
And that's what's kept them going for nearly 19 years.

283
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:20,000
And so they, as just a matter of market forces, they've refined this thing into something that's compelling.

284
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:26,000
And any skill level, a new user or an experienced developer, you're going to be able to use their dashboard,

285
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:32,000
their API and all of the libraries they make available to integrate it in with your existing software

286
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:35,000
or maybe infrastructure management tools as well.

287
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
It's a great way to go if you're an Ansible fan.

288
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:41,000
There's so many things you can try and learn over at Linode.

289
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:44,000
So I think that $100, I think that's probably the thing that we should come back to.

290
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:47,000
And I just got to say, that's a real opportunity to try it.

291
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
Not like it's 15 bucks for a month, right?

292
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
We're talking $100 for 60 days.

293
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
You can really deploy some serious infrastructure.

294
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
You could put something into testing.

295
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:58,000
Maybe there's a project you wanted to try and you just haven't had the right machine forever.

296
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,000
This is your opportunity.

297
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
And it's a great way to support the show too.

298
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:04,000
So head over to linode.com slash coder for that.

299
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:08,000
Get that $100 for 60 days on a new account and you support the show.

300
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,000
We really do appreciate that.

301
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:15,000
So again, linode.com slash coder.

302
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:21,000
We call them dark matter developers, but this author calls them the silent majority.

303
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:28,000
But either way, they represent a big swath of developers who probably feel a little underrepresented

304
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:33,000
when they go on places like Hacker News and they see everyone talking about the latest Web3 app

305
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:36,000
that they're working on or something written in Rust.

306
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:42,000
Meanwhile, the bulk of them are just out there doing Perl, PHP, maybe even a little COBOL

307
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,000
and just chipping away at it every single day.

308
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:48,000
I thought this was a pretty decent article though.

309
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:52,000
And it reminded me of a couple of topics we've touched on with sort of a fresh take.

310
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,000
Yeah, I liked it.

311
00:26:53,000 --> 00:27:00,000
I mean, I have to say that, you know, having done this forever, it feels like forever now,

312
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,000
especially the show part.

313
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,000
I love the show.

314
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:09,000
But having to read all the crap on like Reddit and Hacker News, it's like, oh, look,

315
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:15,000
five people use JavaScript to reinvent something that was better before for no reason.

316
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:19,000
Oh, look, the JavaScript framework that everybody had apparently learned last year

317
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:23,000
because of the new hotness is now the old crappy thing.

318
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,000
Great.

319
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:27,000
And I don't mean to exclusively dunk on the web dev community.

320
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:33,000
It's just it's a lot of I mean, seriously, spend some time on Reddit and Hacker News.

321
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,000
Just just don't go to rslash the next.

322
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
It's a bad place.

323
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
Stay a while and listen.

324
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,000
You sound like old man over there.

325
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:42,000
Yeah, it's like, OK, like I remember.

326
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
Do you remember two years ago or three?

327
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:48,000
Oh, God, like four years ago, it was like WebAssembly.

328
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
It's coming for you.

329
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,000
It's coming for your children.

330
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:54,000
All the things will be WASM.

331
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
I was going to bring that up, actually.

332
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:00,000
Yeah. Remember how that was like the big thing for like 10 minutes?

333
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,000
And well, you know, not so much.

334
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
Right. It certainly has its uses.

335
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:08,000
It's certainly being used, but it has not conquered the world, shall we say.

336
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:14,000
Now I'm seeing this Web3 crap, although I have to say the Web3 stuff isn't picking up quite as well.

337
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,000
But there's a lot of it, you know.

338
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:19,000
Yeah. Well, there's a lot of VC money sloshing around and they got nothing better to do.

339
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,000
So they're just going to keep throwing money at it.

340
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:30,000
And recent micro services are my favorite to dunk on because let's make our application even more complicated.

341
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
Right. Although they do have a place sometimes.

342
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:38,000
But if you are not 100 percent sure it should be a micro service, then it shouldn't.

343
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:41,000
The bit that I thought was a couple of bits, but one of the bits that stood out to me.

344
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:49,000
They write while browsing Hacker News, I sometimes get the feeling that every developer out there is working on a fang app.

345
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:52,000
There's always somebody who's doing some sort of hype stuff.

346
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:57,000
You might think PHP is never used nowadays because it's never mentioned and everyone's always hating on it.

347
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:03,000
But the other thing he points out, which is the element of this, I'm not really sure we've touched on before.

348
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:06,000
We've talked about the dark matter developer, which he calls the silent majority.

349
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:18,000
There's also the dark matter user, the silent user who never gives feedback, either because they're happy with the product as it is or because they don't bother to take the time to fill out surveys and submit bug reports because it's working.

350
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,000
The silent majority are the are your customers.

351
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:30,000
As a result, companies often have a skewed view of their user base and improve the wrong things.

352
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:35,000
Yep. I've watched this happen to multiple companies from the inside.

353
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:45,000
You can have fundamental systemic problems with the product that overall are going to hurt retention.

354
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:52,000
And I have seen one person complain on Twitter that tweet makes it into a leadership meeting.

355
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:59,000
And then it defines the priorities for the entire leadership team for that week, which then, of course, trickles down to all of their staff.

356
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:06,000
And everybody jumps into action because someone on the leadership team got tweeted at by one person.

357
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:10,000
Meanwhile, there's like, you know, the boat is like taking on water.

358
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:18,000
And I just yeah. So, boy, does this resonate and the silent users who are just sort of like peacing out and like not leaving a complaint.

359
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:22,000
They're just like, I'm out of here. You know that they're not they're not registering as a data point.

360
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:26,000
So they can say they're data driven and feedback driven, but it just doesn't work.

361
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:30,000
So he continues. Users who are happy with the product almost never fill out the surveys.

362
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:34,000
It's a waste of time. If they're using a service and they're satisfied with it, they'll just keep using it.

363
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:37,000
If they're not, they just jump to another one.

364
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:44,000
And then this guy proposes that the solution is that dark matter developers should be more vocal, as he puts it.

365
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:47,000
When it comes to the software community, there are two schools of thought.

366
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:56,000
Some people believe it's important to be vocal and share your opinions, while others believe it's better to stay quiet and let the quality of your work speak for itself.

367
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:00,000
Personally, I believe that being more vocal can only be a good thing.

368
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:10,000
He also argues that a lot of developers these days are constrained by NDAs so they can get, you know, well down into their career, but they can't talk about most of what they've done because it's NDA.

369
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:17,000
So he's like, you know, letting your quality of your work stand for itself isn't speak for itself, isn't going to work if it's all NDA.

370
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:25,000
What he's proposing is that developers, you know, the vast majority out there that are just working at a job, getting things done as it's assigned to them.

371
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:29,000
His proposal is that they should start up blogs, podcasts and YouTube channels.

372
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:32,000
And vocalize more.

373
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:40,000
It just seems like never like it's that just I don't that isn't seems like a horrible suggestion to me, actually.

374
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:44,000
So that's not how I took it. But I would say that's a lot to ask.

375
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:48,000
The way I took it was more like be active on the subreddits and Hacker News.

376
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:55,000
And I would argue that that is not a mentally sound thing to do for any buddy.

377
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:58,000
Yeah, I could see I could see that point. And I would agree. That's horrible.

378
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:01,000
I mean, I'm not going to just dunk on R slash Linux, but why not?

379
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:07,000
You know, the people who are going to engage in Reddit flame wars really just like love it.

380
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:12,000
Right. They're not there necessarily to be constructive.

381
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:17,000
Now, some are right. Some are, you know, like we'll answer questions in particular.

382
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:21,000
I know I'm going back, but the old Ubuntu forms used to be really good for that.

383
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:24,000
Yeah. That's a classic callback, but they sure were.

384
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:29,000
Right. But what happened to people? So the so the, you know, the alpha nerds started dunking on Ubuntu

385
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:34,000
because God forbid you have a gooey and sound that kind of works too much fun.

386
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:39,000
Right. If it's not arch, you know, if you didn't compile it from source, you suck.

387
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:44,000
I don't know. I you know, I mean, I'm sure people have noticed I don't engage on the Reddit anymore

388
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:49,000
because it's really just a cesspool. I lurk Reddit.

389
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:53,000
And I sometimes we find good stories for the show there. Hacker News.

390
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:58,000
You got to understand Hacker News is not exactly an open board either.

391
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:05,000
It's funded and hosted by Y Combinator and both, you know, accidentally because of where it is.

392
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:13,000
It has a and I'm pretty sure intentionally it has a pretty heavy startup kind of lean to it.

393
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:18,000
When you're a startup and you're raising money, you always have to say that like everything we're doing is the newest, hottest, sexiest.

394
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:25,000
Right. Right. This might be me being elitist, but I have to wonder if there isn't some truth to this.

395
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:29,000
I acknowledge upfront I'm going to couch a little bit that this is not a universal truth.

396
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:38,000
Generally, people who are busy creating and making things don't spend their time taking a crap in the comments somewhere

397
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:42,000
or crapping on somebody else's work. They generally are just heads down working.

398
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:50,000
And so as a result, I think not again, not majority, but I think a good chunk of the people generally participating in the discussion,

399
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:54,000
especially as you scroll down in ranking, they don't have anything better to do.

400
00:33:54,000 --> 00:34:02,000
That might mean that, you know, while their opinion doesn't shouldn't be disregarded, maybe it just shouldn't be fully weighted either.

401
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:07,000
You know what I'm saying? Like people who are busy making things aren't busy crapping in comment sections.

402
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:10,000
It's just sort of, I think, a universal truth.

403
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:15,000
Yeah, I'd even take it a step further, right? If you're really focused on making a product or a service,

404
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:18,000
you're probably not going to pick the new hotness technology.

405
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:25,000
You're probably not going to be doing something you haven't done before because your goal is to get it out, get product market fit and be done.

406
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,000
Years ago, I think we're going back a decade now.

407
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:35,000
Rob Connery had a when he had his tech pub company, which is long since acquired by Pluralsight.

408
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:39,000
Pluralsight, is that the guys who ate Linux Academy, eventually?

409
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
Yeah, I think ultimately.

410
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:44,000
Yeah, so he was acquired by Pluralsight with that venture.

411
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:51,000
And he had this great post about why he built his tech pub stuff in dot net.

412
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
And I think it was dot net.

413
00:34:53,000 --> 00:35:02,000
Yeah. And the answer was because I know dot net and I could get it out there the quickest with the least hassle and see if anybody subscribed.

414
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:06,000
Your business is to sell the product and not to play with technology.

415
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:10,000
Unless Westpain challenges you, then that's different.

416
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
You never know. Sometimes he just drops it.

417
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:15,000
You never know. He's always there waiting to strike.

418
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:19,000
Always lurking. You don't know he's there. He's very good at hiding it.

419
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:22,000
But he's there. He's there. He's there every single time.

420
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:31,000
Tailscale, y'all. Go over to tailscale.com slash coder and get a free personal account for up to 20 devices and you support the show.

421
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:35,000
Tailscale is a zero config VPN that is changing the industry.

422
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:38,000
I see more people talking about tail scale now than ever.

423
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:41,000
It's clearly because of these spots here on coder. I mean, obviously.

424
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:44,000
What's that? It's because of the quality of the product you say? What was that?

425
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:47,000
I'm sorry. I just got my imaginary producer.

426
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:50,000
They have a really good product based on WireGuard's noise protocol.

427
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:54,000
Yeah. What's that? Builds a flat mesh network.

428
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:57,000
Okay. Really handy. Right.

429
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
Yeah. No, I will tell them that. Yeah.

430
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:03,000
My fake producer tells me that I should tell you that since we started using tail scale,

431
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:10,000
I no longer have any inbound ports on my firewall and I'm no longer screwing around with SSH jump hosts like I used to either.

432
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:13,000
That used to be a thing that I like did all the time.

433
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,000
It was like a standard maneuver.

434
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:23,000
So I really feel like the way I remote compute has shifted and it's shifted for the better in a way that's never going back.

435
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:27,000
And just recently, tail scale launched tail scale SSH.

436
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:30,000
Say goodbye to managing your SSH keys.

437
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:37,000
No more jump boxes, no more like setting up inbound ports like an SSH in.

438
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
It's so awesome.

439
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:45,000
Easily manage your SSH connections in tail scale and tail scale has a whole set of ACL support.

440
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:50,000
Of course, they also let you put DNS in there so you can just resolve machines by their name if you'd like.

441
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:53,000
They'll bust through your double net. I can attest to that.

442
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:57,000
It'll work with your existing firewall and it's super smart about how it routes traffic.

443
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:00,000
So it's not just sending everything over the tail scale connection.

444
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:04,000
You know, some VPNs do that. No, it's not going to do that.

445
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:08,000
And tail scale will snap right in with your existing authentication infrastructure.

446
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:15,000
So if you want to enforce multifactor authentication, the authorized employees who move on a few years into the workplace, you can do all that.

447
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:23,000
And you can also just share a single machine and a single port on that machine if you want, which has been so handy when we're doing just different experiments for the shows and whatnot.

448
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,000
So go try it for yourself.

449
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:34,000
Support the whole dang network and the show and get it for free up to 20 devices when you go to tailscale.com slash coder one more time.

450
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:39,000
That's tailscale.com slash coder.

451
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:48,000
So, of course, Apple's screwing the show once again next week, they're holding their live event on the day our show gets released.

452
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:55,000
So we'll be recording on Monday and then as Apple is doing their event, our show comes out screwing our downloads.

453
00:37:55,000 --> 00:38:03,000
But also. We won't know whether we won't be able to cover it like they're just they do this to us all the time now.

454
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:09,000
I think it's ever since we started criticizing Tim Cook, but Apple is holding a live event September 7th at 10 a.m.

455
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:19,000
next week, and it's the iPhone 14 event, no doubt, and the teaser is far out. It looks like maybe there'll be some night photography capabilities or something like that.

456
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:25,000
I don't think you're very hyped about this one. In fact, I think you have predicted this might be the most boring iPhone release ever.

457
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:31,000
I am more excited about the release of Dominar United for MTG. I couldn't care less about this Apple event.

458
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:40,000
Now, why is that? Because I have an iPhone right next to me. It's great. Yeah, it works fine. My iPad is great. It works fine.

459
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:49,000
Can I tell you something? I think sales are going to be unless unless they do a design change caveat design change always sells.

460
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:59,000
If it's if it's not a design change or if it's a very minor design change, perhaps I think this could be one of their worst iPhone sales since the iPhone launch because we'll see.

461
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:07,000
Maybe not. But I think everybody's really feeling the pinch right now. Consumer demand and consumer sentiment is way down.

462
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:12,000
In fact, consumer sentiment is like it levels during the 2008 crash. It is bad right now.

463
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:17,000
And I think people are just feeling the pinch of inflation, the pinch of energy prices.

464
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:24,000
And I think the luxury of a twelve hundred dollar cell phone just seems a little frivolous, especially when it's working just fine.

465
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:32,000
You know, my wife has the iPhone like eleven. It's still perfectly fine. It doesn't. I was thinking about it's like she's fine.

466
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:35,000
I don't need to replace it when it comes up and I don't really need to replace mine.

467
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:40,000
I I likely will because I just have their stupid subscription program.

468
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:44,000
And so it's like a fifty dollars change and I have another phone. Right.

469
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:51,000
So I likely will, although probably won't be for a while because I'll be on my road trip and it's just not a priority unless they really blow our socks off.

470
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:57,000
I mean, from a dev perspective, there's really nothing that's coming out that you would need this new phone for.

471
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:03,000
There's almost certainly I mean, there's been leaks. Right. There's not going to be a new screen resolution that you need to worry about.

472
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:08,000
Yeah. If they had like some new sensor, perhaps. But that's not going to be for most developers.

473
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:14,000
No. And the problem with the new sensor is are you going you can't really exclusively developed for one device.

474
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:19,000
So you still need ways to handle not having that sensor. And I don't think there is a new sensor.

475
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:24,000
Right. Isn't the leaks aren't suggesting that to be true.

476
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:30,000
What I've seen leaked is that we might see a slight tweak of the face ID.

477
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:35,000
That's what I saw. Notch. Yeah. So what? I mean, I don't mean to be a Debbie Downer.

478
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:40,000
If if, you know, listener, you're excited about a new iPhone, by all means, enjoy yourself.

479
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:47,000
We all have hobbies. I just you know, I've been a little bored with the Apple stuff recently.

480
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:54,000
I don't know if it's just because I to me, the most interesting thing they've come out with in a while is Swift UI.

481
00:40:54,000 --> 00:41:01,000
And a lot of those ideas are straight out of things like React. Right. I don't think they're going to get it with iOS.

482
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:06,000
You know, they filed that trademark for reality. I also don't know that.

483
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:10,000
I mean, I can't even imagine what an Apple headset would cost.

484
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:15,000
So I'm feeling like where I was hoping that things would be really hot is the iPad.

485
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:23,000
But by all reports, all rumors, iOS 16 is just a show on iPad right now.

486
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:28,000
And it's still still they have not changed their policies.

487
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:32,000
There was like a glimmer of hope that they were going to at one level at WWDC.

488
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:37,000
But they have not opened that up to be the true tablet computer that it can be.

489
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:41,000
You know, I think Apple has made a lot of savvy moves in the last few years.

490
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:50,000
But I'm wondering if on some levels, metal wasn't just a huge mistake in terms of platform adoption.

491
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:56,000
I wonder if they couldn't have gone just all in on Vulkan, just fully gone in on Vulkan, because I know they are involved in the standards body.

492
00:41:56,000 --> 00:42:06,000
It seems to me if Apple comes out with a AR VR headset, which Mark Gurman seems to suggest they're at least getting the trademarks filed for getting ready.

493
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:09,000
I could see them. You know, they could do the displays really well.

494
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:13,000
I think they could have decent battery life. I think there would be an app store for it.

495
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:19,000
All that would be there. But what would be missing is really good games, like big industry games.

496
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:26,000
Or what would be missing is really immersive things that creators could throw together using the standard tools that they can use for all of the other platforms.

497
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:34,000
And imagine if every MacBook had just incredible Vulkan support.

498
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:37,000
If the games ran on Vulkan, then you could use something like Proton.

499
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:45,000
Instead, what we have now is like you have at best stuff that kind of is like shims that converts Vulkan and OpenGL into metal.

500
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:49,000
And it's just not ideal. And it requires the developers to build those shims.

501
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:59,000
And it just seems like the limiting factor on why I haven't just gone hog wild on the M hardware is because, well, I want to play video games sometimes.

502
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:09,000
I'm still forced to own PCs and PCs that are portable, that can play video games and don't suck are hard to come by.

503
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,000
I was going to say no such animal. Yeah.

504
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:17,000
Yeah, it'd be so nice if the world had just full, beautiful Vulkan support on Apple's devices.

505
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:27,000
And then when they start talking about a two thousand dollar headset, I'm maybe a little more interested because I know there would be an entire ecosystem of applications that I could run on there.

506
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:32,000
But if it's just metal, then it's just the App Store stuff.

507
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:39,000
And that's too restrictive for a real computing device for an appliance that I make phone calls on.

508
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:45,000
OK, I don't mind it being locked down. But my tablet, it needs to be more like my laptop.

509
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:48,000
It needs to be like they've made the Mac a lot more like iPads.

510
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
Now they need to make the iPad a little more like the Mac.

511
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:57,000
They need to open up and a headset. I know this sounds silly, but I'm going to buy a two thousand dollar headset that's a computing environment.

512
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:03,000
I'm probably going to eventually find it to be really constricted if I can only get App Store stuff and only metal apps.

513
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:08,000
It's going to be like Apple's bestest partners at the time. It's just not sufficient for a device like that.

514
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:18,000
And so while I'm sure overall metal is a great strategy and it makes a lot of sense and it's given them tons of flexibility and it's a really great API overall, I think there has been a strategy tax here.

515
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:26,000
For your average dev going forward with the headset, you're probably not even going to know it's metal because you're just going to be using Unity or Unreal.

516
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:38,000
But I do think you have a point in that the even the Macs are less capable compared to, say, a Linux machine because they went this crazy other way.

517
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:45,000
Right. And it's not not that you couldn't get Proton running on Mac, not that there are. It is. It does run on Mac, just not super well.

518
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:53,000
Yeah. I mean, I just think they don't care. Right. For them, it's about generating more services, revenue and lock in is a part of that.

519
00:44:53,000 --> 00:45:02,000
Yeah. And it's a comprehensive platform. And it's it's just an Apple's DNA to control all that kind of stuff.

520
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:06,000
And I would I would accept the argument because what the hell do I know?

521
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:11,000
I'd accept the argument that metal has given Apple's platform more pros than it has cons.

522
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:22,000
That that seems that seems possible to me. But a lot of times when we look at Apple's ecosystem and their closed nature, we sometimes don't see the cost of some of these things.

523
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:36,000
And I'm not very excited about this stuff because I know ultimately it's just going to be so limited and it's it's still possible for Apple to create such a great experience in that limited range of stuff that it's valuable.

524
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:43,000
But I'm skeptical. I think at the end of the day, what we're going to get is a nicer Oculus, which is fine.

525
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:49,000
I mean, I mean, the mobile Oculus, too, not the not the big Oculus. We'll see. I don't think we'll see it at this event.

526
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:58,000
What we'll do is we'll we'll you know, we'll monitor the event. And if there's anything notable, especially impactful to developers or something like that, we can always follow up with the next week.

527
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:08,000
I suppose it would be nice if Apple would just plan their events around the show like they used to. But alas, somebody had to go and get Tim mad.

528
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:12,000
All right. We got a few more boosts to round out the show.

529
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:17,000
Oh, a guy one boosted in with two thousand two hundred and twenty two sats.

530
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:21,000
But honest and truly, I am Robin Hood.

531
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:28,000
He said, Have you considered Twitch as a platform for continued monetization? It has a culture of cheering streamers on with monetary rewards.

532
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:33,000
While it isn't open source and it is a single platform, it might be a good place to diversify your income.

533
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:38,000
People stream all kinds of things like tweaking their files, maybe stream some of your server maintenance.

534
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:44,000
Mike could live stream his personal development. If peer to had boosts and emotes built in, that'd be a different thing.

535
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:49,000
What do you think, Mike? I know you've toyed with the idea of doing live stream development sessions.

536
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:54,000
Although you probably didn't look at it as like a monetization strategy.

537
00:46:54,000 --> 00:47:03,000
Yeah, I mean, I think I've talked about this on the air, right? I keep wanting to do like a very kind of loose learn to code for kids thing.

538
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:11,000
Yeah. You know, using completely free stuff, VS code, stuff like that themed off of like, you know, classic fairy tales or stories or whatever.

539
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:19,000
Basically, you know, help the sheep cross the bridge so the wolf doesn't eat them kind of thing with Python or whatever, Ruby.

540
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:25,000
Just the setup to get all that running, like I got to give it to those Twitch people.

541
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:32,000
One, I have logged into Twitch twice in my life. I still don't get it.

542
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:38,000
For instance, can I watch a video that's already aired? I think it depends on the creator. I think they can turn that on.

543
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:42,000
That's dumb. You're just recreating the worst of broadcast TV.

544
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,000
Yeah, yeah.

545
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:51,000
I just yeah, I don't I don't get it. Although I am, again, all roads lead to the Magic the Gathering, apparently.

546
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:56,000
I am watching a lot of EDH slash Commander on YouTube.

547
00:47:56,000 --> 00:48:01,000
And that's because YouTube is a paradigm that I understand.

548
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:11,000
Even then, the I mean, I used to make short little instructional videos and just the level of effort to get any content up that was even halfway decent was like what?

549
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:17,000
Three to one. Yeah. I mean, I know you used to do the old Linux action show at your big reporter desk.

550
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:22,000
Remember the good old days? What was the production like for that?

551
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:30,000
I mean, it is a thing, you know, for sure. And I think the other thing about Twitch is it kind of gives you a skewed perspective because all you see is the success.

552
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:41,000
Just below the surface, there are tens of thousands of streamers with like two viewers grinding it out for a decade and just getting emotionally wrecked over it.

553
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:51,000
It I've seen it chew people up on the inside. I'll just say quickly, you know, me being an old man now, I'm not really too inclined to want to join somebody else's platform.

554
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:55,000
And they dictate what I can and can't do. They dictate when I get paid. They dictate with the circumstance.

555
00:48:55,000 --> 00:49:07,000
It's like I've just done that game so much. I'd rather use PeerTube and just wait for the community to build in boost support and things like that and build the audience over there, even though it would be much slower.

556
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:10,000
You know, like I look at JupiterTube, the views, you know, a couple hundred views, 300 views.

557
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:15,000
Of course, the view counts are not accurate either. But in another year, they might be getting what the YouTube videos are getting.

558
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:22,000
And beyond that, you know, that's all I care about. I just want people to have another option besides the commercial platforms.

559
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:31,000
I wonder if Noob Steve had a theme. So let us know, Noob Steve, if 4,444 sets represent something. But I say it's a hot boost.

560
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,000
Coming in hot with the boost.

561
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:38,000
He says, I agree with all of Mike's points on subscriptions. I'm also burnt out.

562
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:43,000
I have three that I don't dread paying for. Apple One, LastPass and Jupiter Party. Hey-o!

563
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:44,000
Thanks, Noob Steve.

564
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:57,000
He says, I'm at the point where I'm going to use an app more than once. I just gladly pay one time 50 or lifetime 100. You know, if I had even paid 100 bucks for a lifetime, I would do that over paying $5 a month.

565
00:49:57,000 --> 00:50:00,000
I just hate having to track all these. Adobe kills me with this specifically.

566
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:06,000
I have to often convert a PDF to Word documents, you know, maybe eight times a year.

567
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:09,000
Well, he continues with another 4,444 sets.

568
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,000
Coming in hot with the boost.

569
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:17,000
I can't just spend 50 bucks on Adobe Pro and call it a day. I have to subscribe for $14.99 a month.

570
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:20,000
Then I end up forgetting to cancel it, so I end up paying more money.

571
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:27,000
Or if I remember to cancel it, I just effectively have to pay it again next time I need to convert something. I absolutely hate it.

572
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:30,000
The Adobe One grinds my gears too.

573
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:35,000
I hate the Adobe One. I used to get it for free. I mean, uh...

574
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:41,000
Oh, did you see that in Canada right now, they have a Photoshop web trial that they're doing?

575
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:42,000
Really?

576
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:43,000
Yeah, you can use it from America.

577
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:48,000
I wonder if that does a web assembly. Actually, I'm really curious if it does.

578
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:57,000
I wonder. I forgot how you find it, but I think if you search for Photoshop web Canada beta or something like that, it may, in fact...

579
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:59,000
Canadians, this is your moment.

580
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:00,000
I know.

581
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,000
Get us the Canada link.

582
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:05,000
They got something first. Isn't that nice? Good for them. I'm not even mad.

583
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:11,000
Well, you know why? They're afraid of the feedback, and they know those salty Americans would just be like, get the hell out of here.

584
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:14,000
Right. Might as well get the feedback from the nice folks.

585
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,000
WM Boosted with 2000 sats.

586
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:19,000
I have a serious question. I am a high-functioning autistic.

587
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:23,000
I've always had a hard time understanding or noticing things others find obvious.

588
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:27,000
Social interaction is a big category of stuff I struggle with.

589
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:30,000
I never thought I would land an IT job, but I did.

590
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:34,000
I thought I would fit in with my new peers, but I don't.

591
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:37,000
It was like joining a small frat of anime dude bros.

592
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:44,000
I was really excited and happy at first, but soon realized I don't quite fit in, and they don't seem to try to hide it.

593
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:47,000
Anyone have an experience to share?

594
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:53,000
Trying to fit in. Another issue with going to the office is sometimes trying to fit in with the group.

595
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:57,000
WM, I wonder if... I'm not a big anime person myself, so I would struggle with this as well.

596
00:51:57,000 --> 00:52:01,000
If they literally are a group of anime fans and you're not, that can be tricky.

597
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:07,000
One thing that you can always do, if you can put up with it, is get people talking about the things they like.

598
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:09,000
They love talking about the stuff they enjoy.

599
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:12,000
You can start asking questions.

600
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:15,000
I would approach them with, hey, how would you recommend a newbie get started?

601
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:20,000
Here's what I don't really want. Here's what I'm into. Where would you recommend I start?

602
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,000
You could probably get them talking to you for days.

603
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,000
You could probably get them creating lists for you.

604
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,000
That may be one suggestion.

605
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:33,000
Yeah, it's a tough one, because interpersonal stuff can be hard.

606
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:41,000
I guess I like Chris's advice, but even on top of that, just focus on what you're supposed to be doing for the job.

607
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:45,000
Don't let it get to you. Don't let it become a distraction.

608
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:48,000
Just do what you have to do.

609
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:51,000
I know it's horrible advice.

610
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:54,000
If these guys decide to be jerks, they decide to be jerks.

611
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:57,000
I don't think they...

612
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:01,000
It's important to know, is this something that's really happening?

613
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:03,000
If so, is it intentional?

614
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:05,000
Or are they just kind of...

615
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:06,000
Insensitive, perhaps?

616
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,000
Insensitive, right.

617
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:11,000
It sounds very high school-ish, right?

618
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:16,000
There are these clique of dudes who are just all into...

619
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:19,000
I don't know much about anime, either.

620
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:22,000
Sailor Moon, I guess.

621
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:26,000
And just because you don't know about it, it's hard to get in the conversation.

622
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:31,000
Maybe. I will say, again, all the roads lead to Magic the Gathering.

623
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:36,000
There definitely was a corner of anime people at this thing.

624
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:37,000
Oh, I bet.

625
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:40,000
Oh, yes. A lot of large plastic swords.

626
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:43,000
I have no idea what the hell that's all about.

627
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:46,000
Although one guy seemed to be dressed up like the dude from Final Fantasy VII.

628
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:47,000
That's kind of cool, I guess.

629
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:50,000
I'm like, I got that one. I got one. Yes!

630
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:53,000
It's like being Captain America when you finally get a reference.

631
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:55,000
Like, ha-ha! I got one.

632
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:59,000
I know it's hard to not sweat it, but just do your job.

633
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:01,000
Try to be friendly when you can.

634
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:03,000
Try to ask them what else they're into.

635
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:05,000
Maybe find common ground in the work you're doing.

636
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:08,000
Whatever tech stack or whatever technologies you're working on.

637
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:09,000
And go for there.

638
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:12,000
Ultimately, your job is really not your family.

639
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:18,000
And if it's just a job for you where you go and you do your shift, you go home.

640
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,000
Make friends outside of work that are into Magic the Gathering.

641
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:21,000
There you go.

642
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:26,000
And our last boost comes in from the pod sage himself, Dave Jones, with 12,000 sats.

643
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:27,000
Another hot boost.

644
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:29,000
Coming in hot with the boost.

645
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:36,000
I wish Microsoft would just bite the bullet and switch Windows from the NT kernel to the Linux kernel.

646
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:42,000
They would save a ton of money on R&D and solve all their kernel security exploits in the process.

647
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:45,000
Linux kernel with a Windows shell sounds appealing to me.

648
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:48,000
Oh man, this seems like the ultimate nerd fantasy.

649
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,000
I've heard iterations of this.

650
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,000
And Dave, I have to be honest with you.

651
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:58,000
If Microsoft shipped Windows on top of a Linux kernel, I would absolutely 100% give it a go.

652
00:54:58,000 --> 00:54:59,000
I'd give it an honest go.

653
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:01,000
I'm not saying I'd stick with it.

654
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:06,000
Because for me, the NT kernel, I don't really have a lot of issues with.

655
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,000
I don't think it's the best piece of work.

656
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:11,000
And you're right, it does have security issues, but what doesn't?

657
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:13,000
For me, it's the UI, man.

658
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:20,000
It's like, you know, you got 15 years of history in that Windows UI and it's like an onion.

659
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:24,000
The top is like the most recent Microsoft design team aspirations.

660
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:28,000
And then you go one layer down and it's like the previous design team's aspirations.

661
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,000
And you go another layer down.

662
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:34,000
And then it's like the old Windows 2000 style stuff.

663
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,000
And then you go another layer down and it's just like DOS.

664
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,000
Well, it's not really DOS, but you know what I mean.

665
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:42,000
There's still times in Windows where you still have to drop down to the command line.

666
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:43,000
I don't know.

667
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:50,000
I just find all of that just sort of like they never, they never did a big purge and clean.

668
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:55,000
Like Windows needed a big purge and clean probably after XP or something.

669
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:56,000
I don't know.

670
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:59,000
Like just do an Apple style or do a Linux GNOME style.

671
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:02,000
Just clear the decks and rebuild.

672
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:07,000
Only they would have the actual resources and teams where, and Microsoft does this.

673
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:09,000
They have two teams in parallel, right?

674
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:12,000
Working on the next version of Windows, well, they used to.

675
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:17,000
They could have had one team working on like the refreshed user experience.

676
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:23,000
But instead they went off in the land of database file systems and all kinds of wacky stuff that they had to abort for Longhorn.

677
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:27,000
And what we got was just cooked up NT4.

678
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:29,000
And that's what we still have today.

679
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:34,000
And NT4 was a fine OS back in 1998.

680
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:37,000
But it's feeling a little long in the tooth now.

681
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:44,000
And that's my only issue is the Linux kernel would bring you a lot of great things in terms of features and capabilities and stuff that's just nice to have.

682
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:48,000
And great emulation environment and a great way to run containers on Windows.

683
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,000
Like that would be really useful.

684
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,000
And you know, you wouldn't need the whole WSL subsystem at all.

685
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,000
It could all just be pure.

686
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,000
All those would be positives.

687
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:59,000
But I think the big negative would still be the UI.

688
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:01,000
I think there's more negative than that.

689
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:02,000
Oh yeah?

690
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,000
Well, there's also the tracking.

691
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:09,000
There's all the constant advertising their latest stuff to you in some subtle way.

692
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:11,000
Or forcing some voice assistant onto your system.

693
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:13,000
Or their web browser.

694
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:15,000
All of that would still be a thing too, I suppose.

695
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:17,000
I mean, I have this complaint about Mac, right?

696
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:20,000
That you have to like log into some synchronized account to use your computer.

697
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:21,000
That seems...

698
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:22,000
Oh my gosh, dude.

699
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:27,000
Like Monday morning when I haven't used the computers for a few days, I get in.

700
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:28,000
Oh yeah.

701
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:29,000
And it's like there's so much.

702
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:31,000
There's like six different notifications.

703
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:33,000
I got to log into like seven different things.

704
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:37,000
Like if I didn't have Bitwarden, I would spend an hour logging into stuff.

705
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:38,000
And it's still tedious.

706
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:39,000
Because I still got to like...

707
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:42,000
A lot of them are like modal dialogues where I got to launch the Bitwarden app.

708
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,000
I got to search for the provider in there.

709
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:45,000
Copy all that stuff.

710
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:46,000
Paste it into the dialogue box.

711
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:51,000
Because, you know, it's just all these different random ass like inconsistent login boxes that pop up.

712
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:53,000
And it's just so much.

713
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:58,000
I sure am getting a fan of becoming a big fan of NixOS and GNOME together.

714
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,000
It just feels like a real tight, nice little OS.

715
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:03,000
Yeah, it's... Oh God.

716
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:05,000
It just... I don't know.

717
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:06,000
It's supposed to get better, right?

718
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:07,000
Wasn't that the implicit deal?

719
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:17,000
Like when we were kids and we were getting into computers, like we put up with things being rough and the graphics sucking and the speeds being slow and things being glitchy and the voice stuff not working.

720
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:19,000
Because it was going to get better.

721
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:21,000
Right? That was the implicit deal.

722
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:23,000
We put in the time.

723
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:25,000
And as a result, we're supposed to get good stuff.

724
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:27,000
We didn't get good stuff.

725
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:41,000
Yeah. Well, I think what happened is the business model changed from I want to sell you first hardware, then I want to sell you software via somebody else selling you hardware.

726
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:43,000
And Apple's like, what are you talking about?

727
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:44,000
Still hardware.

728
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:47,000
And now it's like, yeah, that's not enough up and to the right.

729
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:51,000
So now I need to sell you continual renewing services.

730
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:53,000
And you're going to buy less of my thousand dollar phones?

731
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:55,000
All right, turn up the advertising then.

732
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:56,000
Yeah.

733
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:59,000
It's I think, you know, we can never go back.

734
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:01,000
And the OS just serves that purpose now.

735
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:02,000
That's what the OS does.

736
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:03,000
And that's why they're free now.

737
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:08,000
I mean, we're never going to get back to the days of, you know, the wizard beards of Sun Microsystems.

738
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:10,000
God rest their souls.

739
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:12,000
Giving us just good quality software.

740
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:13,000
Right.

741
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:15,000
In fact, let me throw this at your face.

742
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:17,000
Brace yourself for this one.

743
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:20,000
Are we doomed for this to be Windows forever now?

744
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:29,000
Perhaps we will never see the great rewrite that like Dave would be proposing because they're no longer making a hundred, two hundred, three hundred bucks a pop.

745
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:30,000
Right.

746
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:37,000
They used to have like the home edition and the pro edition and like they'd sell those for a couple hundred bucks and they could actually make a profit from the operating system.

747
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:40,000
But now now that's all all the OS is a freak.

748
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:41,000
They're all free.

749
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:49,000
And like it's really hard to justify spending, you know, maybe five years or whatever would take a corporation their size to research and develop.

750
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:52,000
You know, an entire re-architecting of Windows to clean all these things up.

751
00:59:52,000 --> 01:00:01,000
It just seems like with these new business models that you're talking about right now, that kind of labor on the operating system is more off the table than ever.

752
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:05,000
It's just going to be small incremental improvements to serve the overall platform.

753
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:06,000
Yeah, I think that's basically it.

754
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:09,000
Right. Everything is going to go to cloud services and stuff like that.

755
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:12,000
So, well, that's got depressing.

756
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:17,000
Yeah. Well, there's Linux, you know, maybe these Linux podcasts I'm doing are going to take off in a few years.

757
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:25,000
Because, you know, like I Linux doesn't seem to be stopping and people are continuing to adopt it for some crazy reason.

758
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:27,000
It's still new users coming to Linux.

759
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:35,000
And maybe it's just, you know, the more dystopia this gets, the more appealing something like something that's just like an old computer.

760
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:38,000
Seriously, like the idea that it's not sinking to the cloud.

761
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:39,000
Yeah. You know, I don't know.

762
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:48,000
Maybe if you'd like to boost into the show, we'd love to have your support and your message go to newpodcastapps.com to find a new podcast app that supports podcasting 2.0,

763
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:56,000
which is a whole range of brand new features coming to podcasting, extending the current RSS, keeping it in free open RSS.

764
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:58,000
And one of those is the Boostagram support.

765
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:03,000
You can grab breezebreez.technology if you don't want to switch podcast apps.

766
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:08,000
I know you antenna pod users love your antenna pod and antenna pod is looking at integrating breeze.

767
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:11,000
So get a head start, get it all figured out.

768
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:16,000
You can also try out Fountain FM, which will stream stats as you play podcasts and Podverse,

769
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:21,000
which is an open source, multi-platform podcasting 2.0 app.

770
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:25,000
And we are also using it on our new website as the embedded player.

771
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:31,000
So our embedded player will have podcasting 2.0 features like chapters right there on the web player.

772
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:37,000
And then if you're already a Podverse user, you can click through and get to all of your podcasts and just continue listening.

773
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:40,000
So newpodcastapps.com for all of that.

774
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:46,000
And a big thank you to our members as well for supporting the show and giving us the availability to say no.

775
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:48,000
I almost read another email.

776
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:53,000
If you like, if you like some of these crazy emails that come in, like the offers that people send us,

777
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:56,000
I could do it occasionally, very rarely.

778
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:58,000
Let me know, send a boost in or an email.

779
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:05,000
But we got one that was pitching to pay us to have a like they have a bench of AI experts.

780
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:08,000
I don't know if you saw this email that came in, Mike, but it's like this gal's like,

781
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:14,000
you got to get on the AI machine learning bandwagon and here's a bench of experts that we can make available to you.

782
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:17,000
And of course, they all have something to sell, all have something to show.

783
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:21,000
They all have a book or like an online training course or something.

784
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:25,000
And they come on and, you know, we're supposed to pretend like it's a real interview

785
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:27,000
and we're supposed to give them an opportunity to show their stuff.

786
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:31,000
And then we get paid. The whole thing is so shady.

787
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:38,000
That's the kind of stuff that like JB is never going to have to get involved in because our members are one of our most important customers.

788
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:41,000
That's it right there. And you can become a member at CoderQA.co.

And you can get all the shows at Jupiter.party, all the special features and no ad versions at Jupiter.party.

791
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:56,000
Mr. Dominic, is there anywhere you'd like to send the good people this week before we get out of here?

792
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:59,000
Probably therapy if we keep mentioning Sun.

793
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:01,000
There we go. Javaduke.

794
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:04,000
Oh, I already did it. You missed it. You totally missed it.

795
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:09,000
Oh, no. I'll have to listen back. They're my favorite moments.

796
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:14,000
Follow me on Twitter at Dumanuco and wish me luck. I'm playing in two magic tournaments this weekend.

797
