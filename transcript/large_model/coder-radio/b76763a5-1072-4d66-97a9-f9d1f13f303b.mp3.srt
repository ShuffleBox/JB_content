00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,520
This is Koda Radio, episode 411 for April 26th, 2021.

2
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:19,160
Hello and welcome in to Jupiter Broadcasting's weekly talk show, taking a pragmatic look

3
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:23,940
at the art and business of software development and the world of technology.

4
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:26,480
This episode is brought to you by Cloud Guru.

5
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:32,660

8
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:46,640
My name is Chris, and joining us all set up on his brand new Windows-powered machine,

9
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:48,120
it's our host, Mr. Dominic.

10
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:49,120
Hello, Mike.

11
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:54,400
I see you're trying to bait me, but actually, I did have to get bailed out to this show

12
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:57,200
40 minutes late by the M1 MacBook Air.

13
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:01,560
And therefore, I have prepared, I actually prepared this song before, but it's even colder

14
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:02,560
now.

15
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:03,560
Okay.

16
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:06,560
Just like my hero, Dean Martin, we do have a brief musical intro.

17
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:12,320
Chris, can you drum me in or something?

18
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:15,160
That's the production quality you've all come to expect.

19
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:16,160
Do-re-mi.

20
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:17,160
Intel sucks.

21
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:18,840
Okay, here we go.

22
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:21,680
Imagine there's no M1.

23
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:24,360
It's impossible to try.

24
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:29,520
Noble below us, not above us, only Evo.

25
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:32,920
And you need to know a lot about processor architectures available today to understand

26
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:33,920
that joke.

27
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:39,200
But basically, it's not an awesome time to be Intel.

28
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,760
I think soundboard, Mike, said it best.

29
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:42,080
What, do you got a vape pen there?

30
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:45,040
I think you're nuts.

31
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:49,120
I just spent roughly $2,400 on another ThinkPad, so.

32
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:50,120
What?

33
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:51,120
Boom.

34
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:52,920
You could have got an iPad Pro for that money.

35
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:58,360
Well, it turns out that I'm doing a disturbing amount of.NET these days.

36
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:02,760
I've kind of been keeping it secret under the Python stuff, but that never stopped.

37
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:06,520
And well, Chris, there's a time in every young man's life.

38
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:08,480
I mean, hold on, we got to back up.

39
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:12,960
Before you go too far, $2,400 on a ThinkPad, like what did you get?

40
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:14,480
Did you get something super sweet?

41
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:15,480
Me?

42
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:16,480
Never.

43
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:17,480
I always go for low-end machines.

44
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:18,480
Uh-huh.

45
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:19,480
So what is this thing?

46
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:23,920
It might be, in a hypothetical world that definitely is not legally actionable, it might

47
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:26,960
be the newest X1 Carbon.

48
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:27,960
Oh.

49
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:28,960
Basically maxed out.

50
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:29,960
Yeah.

51
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:30,960
Yeah.

52
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:31,960
Okay.

53
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:32,960
All right.

54
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:33,960
That's a good call.

55
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:34,960
Yeah.

56
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:35,960
The one with Windows on it?

57
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:36,960
Indeed.

58
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:37,960
Oh.

59
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:38,960
So you got the Gen 9 then.

60
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:40,200
That's nice, because the Linux version is Gen 8 only still.

61
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,200
I hope.

62
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,200
Did I get the Gen 9?

63
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:45,400
Chris, if I could have paid another $1,000, I would have got the Gen 10.

64
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:48,040
I mean, who do you think you're talking to?

65
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:49,040
Right.

66
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,040
Who are you?

67
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:51,040
Hi.

68
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:52,040
Hang on.

69
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:53,040
I got the receipt right here.

70
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:57,120
$2,443.86, if you're going to be a little bitch about it.

71
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:02,840
The part number, for those of you who are going to be assholes, is 2-0-X-W-0-0-3-G-U-S.

72
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:04,600
Are there any other questions?

73
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:05,600
In fact, you know what?

74
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:08,200
Let's look down this whole bill of materials, because I don't do any show prep.

75
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:09,200
i7?

76
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,200
i5?

77
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:11,200
What?

78
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,200
All right.

79
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:13,200
You're just fucking with me now, right?

80
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,400
Well, I'm just wondering how committed you are to this.

81
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,400
You know what?

82
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:17,280
My little brother is staying with me for a couple weeks.

83
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,760
He showed me an i5 machine.

84
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:19,760
Yeah.

85
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:24,160
I poured a PBR on top of it in front of him while he was trying to save his homework to

86
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:25,160
teach him a lesson.

87
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:27,800
You got to make sure that you pass on wisdom when you can.

88
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:28,800
That's right.

89
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:32,840
That is a fictional story for any attorneys, assistants who are listening.

90
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:33,840
Yeah.

91
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:34,840
That's not...

92
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:35,840
Mike does not actually abuse his brother.

93
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:38,000
Mike has some actual problems.

94
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:44,920
No, this is, of course, an 11th Gen i7, 2.8 gigahertz, but turbo's up to 4.7.

95
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:48,480
At that point, I don't think you can actually hold it on your lap, but hey.

96
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:52,840
Windows 10 Pro, because WSL is the best distro of Linux.

97
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:57,320
I did not go for the touchscreen, even though I said I was going to, for reasons of battery

98
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:58,320
life.

99
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:02,040
16 gigs, which I still think is an inadequate amount of memory, but...

100
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:03,040
Yeah.

101
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:07,720
One terabyte, blah, blah, blah, PCIe, Intel Iris graphics, yeah, Intel, you'll still never

102
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:10,960
be as good as the M1, and you should just go cry and cut yourself, I don't know.

103
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:14,960
The Intel 11th Gen Z graphics are a big improvement.

104
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:16,880
It's a huge leap over the 10th Gen.

105
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:19,480
I mean, there's still Intel graphics, but they're way better.

106
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:20,480
They still suck.

107
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:26,640
Oh, and I will say $260 of this, we're buying their special USB-C QHD IPS monitor and docking

108
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:28,560
station because I'm psychotic.

109
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:31,360
You must be expecting you're going to be spending some serious time on this machine, working

110
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,360
on something.

111
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:36,720
This is going to be my full-time machine for the next nine months, and the other Lenovo

112
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:42,960
is going to one of my employees because we somehow, when I say somehow, gather round,

113
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:43,960
children.

114
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:46,640
Let me tell you a story about the days before Diablo rose.

115
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:49,400
Say a while and listen.

116
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:52,560
Somebody got really frustrated with Linux drivers.

117
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:53,560
Who is this, you?

118
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:54,560
No, no.

119
00:04:54,560 --> 00:05:02,120
This is a theoretical warrior in Tristil, Trizial, wherever the hell Diablo takes place.

120
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:03,160
Tell what Diablo.

121
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:04,400
It's World of Warcraft.

122
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,400
There was a gnome.

123
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:06,840
He was mad about Linux drivers.

124
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:07,840
He was a mage.

125
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:12,440
He had some girl troubles, but he was trying real hard.

126
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:15,000
He gave everything he had to Objective-C.

127
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,440
This is, again, a fictional character.

128
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:18,440
Right.

129
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:19,920
Sounds made up completely.

130
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:23,080
He was swiftly struck down, see what I did there?

131
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:25,320
And then he went to the dark side.

132
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:31,320
He went deep, deep into the core, the.NET core.

133
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:39,480
Secretly, he was still talking to nature, to the pythons, to the vipers, to the pythons,

134
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:46,560
and yet, slowly, the influence of that deep.NET core got to him.

135
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:53,800
Then he came out, finding he had no mana, no gold, no rubies, and no crystal meth to

136
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:54,800
sell.

137
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,720
Have you heard of, I think it's Ximarin.

138
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:57,720
Have you heard of this?

139
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:58,720
I think you're going to like this.

140
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,560
No, it's called Maui these days.

141
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:03,560
Yeah, it is, actually.

142
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:04,840
And now it's for all platforms.

143
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:12,640
He looked at.NET and said, this is truly a dark sorcery, but version one, bad.

144
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:14,520
Version two, terrible.

145
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:17,160
Version three, questionable ethics.

146
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:19,920
Version four, unforeseen consequences.

147
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:22,620
Version five, the guilt of what we've done.

148
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:25,540
But version six, this time will be different.

149
00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:27,520
So it goes with version six.

150
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:37,400
This completely fictional gnome named Mikhail sold a bunch of.NET work because he's insane.

151
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:39,680
I mean, because he's a very good advisor.

152
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:40,680
I see.

153
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:41,680
I see.

154
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:44,680
So this is a complicated World of Warcraft plotline, I got to say.

155
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:47,080
It's probably one of the more complicated ones I've ever heard of.

156
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:53,000
But essentially, I guess this character who's totally made up and fictional, Mikhail, he

157
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:57,500
is just feeling good about.NET 6 and decided, let's go out there and tell some people we

158
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:58,500
can do this.

159
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:01,000
And then somebody, what happened is somebody bit.

160
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,080
I'm not sure that he's feeling good.

161
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:10,000
I would describe this more as he was in a low place.

162
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:17,480
You know, his rupees were down and a, I don't want to say void demon.

163
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:20,200
You could say Microsoft, but I would say void demon.

164
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:26,760
Or maybe, I don't know, principality from hell, maybe, if you know your Catholic school.

165
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:31,880
Came to him and said, but my son, imagine using one language that is awfully familiar

166
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:37,520
to C Sharp, if you remember the old Coco API, and writing everything.

167
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:39,520
And also, you've been doing this for years.

168
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:42,840
But this time, just sign this little contract.

169
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:44,400
It's an open source agreement.

170
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,660
It'll be fine.

171
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:48,040
The hissing was weird.

172
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:50,320
I felt like the snake jazz was a little much.

173
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:51,320
Yeah.

174
00:07:51,320 --> 00:08:01,560
I mean, McHale felt the snake jazz so much, somehow, within 36 hours, he solved his booking

175
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:02,560
problems.

176
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:06,120
You know, this McHale guy, he's probably responsible for a lot of stuff.

177
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:09,760
You know, I hear he spills drinks all the time on other people's laptops.

178
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:12,200
Not even his own, but other people's laptops that are definitely not his.

179
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:17,720
Well, again, in this deeply hypothetical world, the questionable morality of someone who would

180
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:23,600
make a deal with the dot net core demons, obviously, that takes a toll on you psychologically.

181
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,680
I can see that.

182
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:26,680
So how do you recover?

183
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:27,680
What do you do?

184
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:28,680
Alcoholism, of course.

185
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:29,680
I mean, oh, yeah.

186
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:30,680
Okay.

187
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:31,680
Okay.

188
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:32,680
Well, that should take care of it.

189
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:33,680
That's problem solved right there.

190
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:38,840
Now, do you feel like maybe you and I should just dispense some advice because we got some

191
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:40,120
emails into the show.

192
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:42,800
Let's just give them some great advice.

193
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:43,800
All right.

194
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:45,920
So anonymous writes in.

195
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:46,920
That's the spirit.

196
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:47,920
Yep.

197
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:53,360
My last contract job gave me a laptop and all my home office stuff.

198
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:57,160
It's been over six months now, and they don't seem to want the laptop back.

199
00:08:57,160 --> 00:09:01,960
I started using the second display, but been thinking maybe I should image the laptop and

200
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:03,800
start loading Linux on it.

201
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:06,480
It's not mine, but the company doesn't seem to want it.

202
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,480
And so I followed up.

203
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:08,480
I sent him an email.

204
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,160
I said, are you really sure they don't want it?

205
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:15,440
And his response to me was, when I was on my way out the door, they said, we'll contact

206
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:20,800
you probably in the future, but we never collected the laptop from the last guy.

207
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:23,920
And then they sent him on his way with the laptop and he says the company buys him in

208
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:25,680
three year leases.

209
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:28,740
And so it's like, you know, almost on its second, it's on the second year of a three

210
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:29,740
year lease.

211
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:32,120
And he's wondering if, should he, what should he do with this laptop?

212
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:34,880
Should he just leave in his closet and wait for the phone call?

213
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:37,120
Should he call them up and say, Hey, I got this laptop.

214
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,960
Are you sure you're never going to collect this thing?

215
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:42,240
Which they would almost inevitably say, oh yeah, of course, send it to us.

216
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:48,320
Or should he try to back it up somehow, image it and start using it as like a test machine?

217
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,320
What would you do?

218
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:50,320
Hmm.

219
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:53,000
I, again, I need, I need Mr. King.

220
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Good thing.

221
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
He's here.

222
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,520
Stay a while and listen.

223
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:59,280
So I want to recite for you.

224
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:04,920
Let's just say, but some generous edits, the story of Aladdin, a young man from somewhere

225
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:05,920
in the desert.

226
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:06,920
I really don't know.

227
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:08,220
Let's just say Baghdad.

228
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:11,740
And he got a laptop from his then employer.

229
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:13,640
They didn't care for six months.

230
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:15,440
He wrote some IP on it.

231
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,200
And then they're like, well, technically that's our machine.

232
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,760
We own the IP.

233
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:24,520
That laptop goes in a special box where top men take care of it.

234
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:26,940
If you, again, Indiana Jones, right?

235
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:27,940
Do not touch it.

236
00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:28,940
Do not use it.

237
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:29,940
Do not format it.

238
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:33,120
You put it in a little box and you never ever touch it.

239
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,120
Oh really?

240
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:35,120
Hmm.

241
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,120
By your own.

242
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:37,120
Here's the thing.

243
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:40,560
And I think this is being colored because I have had this happen to me several times.

244
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:45,320
You know, like work provided machine or client provided machine or, or whatever, a review

245
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:46,480
unit.

246
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:50,040
And I, I sent him an email, said, like, I'm ready to send it back, you know, give me the

247
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:52,100
shipping label and it'll be off.

248
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:55,780
And I never hear from them and I'll follow up and I never hear from them.

249
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:56,780
And it just sits there.

250
00:10:56,780 --> 00:11:00,480
And I always think to myself, I should be doing something with that.

251
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:03,400
I have a machine here right now that I need to send back.

252
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:04,400
And it's that same situation.

253
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:07,060
And I think to myself, I should do something with that.

254
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:10,540
But then I feel guilty and I'm like, I can't, I can't even just play around with it because

255
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:11,840
you know, it's not mine.

256
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:16,520
If you work hard on your own IP and let's forget if you're an open source IP, whatever,

257
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:18,900
but actually you still have the same concern.

258
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:22,840
You don't want that stupid liability because you wouldn't spend a thousand dollars or even

259
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:24,780
use the laptop you have at home.

260
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:25,820
Not worth it.

261
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:27,000
It's never worth it.

262
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,420
Put it in a box.

263
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:29,420
Forget about it.

264
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:30,960
Like the one ring of Saran.

265
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:31,960
Hang on now.

266
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:32,960
I'm going to be invisible for a few minutes.

267
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:37,280
You know, he may just want to use it for a learning GNOME 40.

268
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:38,920
Maybe he's not writing in the apps.

269
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:39,920
Maybe he's not doing.

270
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:42,120
Format it because that's their data.

271
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:43,560
You do nothing.

272
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:44,840
Don't touch it.

273
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:50,120
Treat it like the angry nun at Catholic school that was kind of hot, but you, you wait, oh,

274
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:51,720
this is Mikhail talking again.

275
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:54,520
You can tell he's got a slightly different voice, you know, different cadence too.

276
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:55,520
And so you could talk.

277
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:56,520
I could totally tell.

278
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:57,520
I'm glad you're back though.

279
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:58,520
I'm no, no, it's Mike.

280
00:11:58,520 --> 00:11:59,520
So I'm glad Mike's back.

281
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:00,520
Cause Mike was just telling us that was Mikhail.

282
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:01,520
So obviously Mike's back now.

283
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:02,520
I'm so confused.

284
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:03,520
Yeah.

285
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:04,520
Seriously.

286
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:05,520
You know what?

287
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:06,520
I don't agree with you, Chris.

288
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:07,520
He should do nothing.

289
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:08,520
No, you're right.

290
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:09,520
You're no, you're absolutely right.

291
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:10,520
You're saying the right thing.

292
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:13,120
I just, I know where he's at, but I think you're probably right.

293
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:16,200
And if they don't want to, if they don't want to back, how nice of a computer could it actually

294
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,200
be?

295
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:21,680
Well, they leased it and they're really forking over the leasing company, but that leasing

296
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:23,840
company also would have rights to anything on the laptop.

297
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:28,460
So it, this is a, this is a, no, you're just tripping into a harness.

298
00:12:28,460 --> 00:12:29,460
Don't touch it.

299
00:12:29,460 --> 00:12:31,260
What's the statute of limitations though?

300
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:33,400
Five years go by and this thing's still in his closet.

301
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:38,120
At what point does he just say, you know what, I'm going to clone this hard drive or I'm

302
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:41,760
just going to physically remove the hard drive and put a new hard drive blank disc in.

303
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:44,200
I'll put this one on the shelf and I'm going to start using it.

304
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:45,200
Like at what point?

305
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,200
What's the statute of limitations on this?

306
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:48,320
I mean, at that point you have a five year old machine.

307
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:50,520
You've put a new hard drive in at your expense.

308
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:53,120
You could just buy a new laptop and get a much better machine.

309
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:55,280
I mean, that's like silly fraud, right?

310
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:56,280
Like you're right.

311
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:57,280
You're no, yeah.

312
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:58,280
Okay.

313
00:12:58,280 --> 00:12:59,280
So there's really no way around it.

314
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:03,300
I, what I would probably do then is I would get ahold of them again and remind them once

315
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:07,120
again and just get this thing out of here, which is what I always actually end up doing

316
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:10,240
is I always just end up playing the email game tag.

317
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:11,240
You're it.

318
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:12,240
You know, that kind of thing.

319
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:15,400
I put them in cold storage because that's very scary for them, but we could talk about

320
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:16,400
that later.

321
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:18,980
I mean, McHale puts them in cold storage, right?

322
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:21,660
You would never, we got an update from Matt.

323
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:26,200
Now you might not remember Matt, but Matt, uh, he had, uh, he had a tale of woe and you

324
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:27,880
had one piece of advice for him.

325
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:28,880
Get a hobby.

326
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:29,880
And you told him to get a hobby.

327
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:30,880
Did I?

328
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:31,880
Yeah.

329
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:35,980
Matt wrote in good day, Mike and Chris, I wrote in a little while ago lamenting over

330
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:40,200
my current situation with work, feeling like I'm in a rut and having lost my motivation

331
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,400
for it.

332
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:42,680
And yes, Mike was right.

333
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:43,680
It's mostly SharePoint.

334
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:44,680
I work with.

335
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:45,680
So one point to him.

336
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:46,680
Stop right there.

337
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:47,680
Stop right there.

338
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:49,480
There was a very important part of that sentence.

339
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:50,480
Mike was right.

340
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:52,440
Listeners, you know what to clip.

341
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:53,520
You know what it is.

342
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:54,520
Mike got lucky.

343
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:56,920
That's what it was.

344
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:57,920
That's what they're going to clip.

345
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:58,920
You son of a.

346
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:00,080
No, you, you did totally call it.

347
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:01,080
It was SharePoint.

348
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:02,080
I remember that.

349
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:03,320
And I remember agreeing with you at the time.

350
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:07,240
Uh, he also thinks everybody who wrote in to kind of chat with him a little bit via

351
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:08,240
the show.

352
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:09,240
I love this.

353
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:10,240
I love that.

354
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:11,240
I'm really glad that Matt wrote in and gave us an update too.

355
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:12,680
Cause I was wondering how he was doing.

356
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:15,000
He says, I guess I had lost my way a little bit.

357
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:19,360
I'd essentially automated myself out of having to babysit the systems that I supported and

358
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:21,720
well, everything just works.

359
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:25,120
Sure I'd have the standard monthly stuff to get done, like updates and patching, but it

360
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:28,520
all basically just tells me when there's something I need to care about.

361
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:29,640
And you're right.

362
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:31,920
And when you guys are right, you are right.

363
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:33,240
Hobbies is where it's at.

364
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:37,800
Some ago I tried to get into rust development and wrote an RSS alert to watch feeds and

365
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:41,320
get a notification using pushover when it contains certain keywords.

366
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:45,120
That was fun, but I wanted to turn it into desktop GUI application.

367
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:48,140
And well, I just kind of gave up at that point.

368
00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:52,900
The closest I got was using GTK RS, but it just felt clunky and it seemed like half the

369
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:56,880
time some of the GTK bindings weren't really even working yet.

370
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:57,880
It's more than half.

371
00:14:57,880 --> 00:14:58,880
But yeah.

372
00:14:58,880 --> 00:14:59,880
Savage.

373
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:00,880
You burn GTK RS.

374
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:01,880
You burned.

375
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:03,640
I decided to properly give Python a go.

376
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:07,120
For some reason I've avoided it in the past, but it's been really fun.

377
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:08,600
Python has been around for so long.

378
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:10,880
There seems to be an answer to just about everything.

379
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:14,640
I'm currently using open CV to do a bunch of stuff and it's been awesome.

380
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:17,540
At some point I'll return to rust because I have an idea for an app that will probably

381
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:20,080
make me about 75 a year.

382
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:24,000
I think he's trying to go for that Thalia there, but also it's mostly because rust seems

383
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,560
to have a pretty big future.

384
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:26,560
Thanks again.

385
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:27,560
Love your work.

386
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:28,560
Matt.

387
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:32,080
That's a super big thank you, Matt, for taking the time to write in and follow up on how

388
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:33,280
you're doing.

389
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:36,640
I hope things continue in that direction for you.

390
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:40,440
When you do write that app that's going to make you $75,000 to win that Thalia, you let

391
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:41,560
us know.

392
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:44,840
I think he meant $75.

393
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:46,440
Still nobody's claimed it yet.

394
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:47,440
Hang on.

395
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:48,440
We're betting a robe here.

396
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:49,440
Are you ready?

397
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:50,440
Okay.

398
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:51,440
These are precious items now.

399
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:52,440
It's your problem.

400
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:54,600
You're the idiot who said he was going to make robes.

401
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:55,600
I know.

402
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:56,600
I know.

403
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:57,600
I know.

404
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:04,440
If you win more than $10,000 US, living in the United States with a job on a desktop

405
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:07,040
Linux app, I will buy you a robe.

406
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:08,040
There you go.

407
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:10,840
I think this is a third robe bet, and let me tell you something.

408
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:14,920
This is like betting on the Chicago fans here.

409
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:16,160
We don't want to do that.

410
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:18,380
We're doing robe future trading is what we're doing right now.

411
00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:20,380
We're doing robe futures.

412
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:24,200
I'm pretty sure I have a bunch of Slack messages from you saying, I'm never going to do this

413
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:25,200
again.

414
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:26,200
This was a goddamn nightmare.

415
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:27,200
What the...

416
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:29,440
By the way, I enjoyed my beer this afternoon.

417
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:30,440
Oh yeah?

418
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:31,440
In your stein?

419
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:32,440
At 10 in the morning.

420
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:33,920
Let me tell you something.

421
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:39,480
The only silver lining on the robe is I have gotten my game down.

422
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:44,600
We have taken like 300 orders now through the Jupiter garage, and we're shipping stuff

423
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:47,440
out nearly daily, and we're rocking it.

424
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:51,400
That LUP stein, that Linux unplugged stein, that's some quality stuff there.

425
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:52,400
I know.

426
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:53,400
I know.

427
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:54,400
It's great.

428
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:56,520
I feel like the robe was kind of your alpha, and I'm a little pissed off actually.

429
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:57,520
Yeah.

430
00:16:57,520 --> 00:17:02,520
Well, it was like literally jumping into the deep end, and what I didn't appreciate too

431
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:07,440
is that supply chains have been screwed up this year as well, which now I have a sense

432
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:12,440
of, and now I have an idea of what companies to work with and which ones to avoid, but

433
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:14,240
that was just all new territory for me before.

434
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:15,240
Yeah.

435
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:19,000
No, but I think it's time for some hashtag robe justice.

436
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Is that like mob justice, but for robes?

437
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,760
It's all of the Coderadio road people are going to march on Lady Jeeps.

438
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:29,000
Now, good thing she's mobile because that's going to be very hard for her.

439
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,600
I better get like a push bar on the front so I can just mow people down.

440
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:34,760
I'm going to just throw LUP steins at you.

441
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:37,240
That's the plan.

442
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:43,860
I've sold, get this, two network attached storages in five days through the Jupiter

443
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:44,860
garage store.

444
00:17:44,860 --> 00:17:52,960
A free NAS, and then Alex sold a Helios arm device because what I've done is I've set

445
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:57,440
up like this garage sale concept and I'm selling out all of the old swag archives that we have

446
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:02,560
because we still have stuff from the old shows like last and stuff that are like really valuable

447
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:08,320
and that I thought this is my opportunity to learn how to do fulfillment domestically

448
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:13,400
and internationally with items I already have in stock that I'd like to clear out to make

449
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:14,720
room for future inventory.

450
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:17,400
Aren't you a real basic swag?

451
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:20,960
Oh yeah, yeah.

452
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:23,440
Just with Lunduk's face on it and like the real basic logo.

453
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:26,160
I was like, oh, that's you, not me.

454
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:28,760
I shall not dunk another JB host.

455
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:31,040
I knew where you were going with that.

456
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:33,400
Oh my God.

457
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:37,000
Mike has some feelings about what are real programming platforms and what aren't.

458
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:42,040
But you know, like it really worked out as a clever way to do it with something that

459
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:47,440
we already had that meant, because what I realized is I need to be in more control of

460
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:48,440
the fulfillment.

461
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:51,920
And that was the biggest mistake here.

462
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:53,160
But I don't have any idea what I'm doing.

463
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:56,360
I don't have any idea how to figure out how to build things for shipping.

464
00:18:56,360 --> 00:19:00,200
We're figuring all of that now and we're doing a pretty good job of it.

465
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:05,920
So I feel like that's the silver lining of the robe outcome is that like as a business

466
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:09,480
now, which we don't talk about super often on that side, but as a business, we're starting

467
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:13,880
to take it a lot more seriously and we've started to get our game figured out and dialed

468
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:14,880
in.

469
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:19,360
And the moment we put stuff up, the free NAS sold in three minutes.

470
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:20,360
Jesus Christ.

471
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:21,360
Yeah.

472
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:24,280
Alex's NAS sold in 20 minutes.

473
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:27,760
The swag bags, the moment I put them up on the garage, they sell.

474
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:33,580
And you know, these are just like random swag bags of like stickers and sometimes shirts

475
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:34,580
and just...

476
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:35,580
Hook a brother up.

477
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:36,580
Yeah.

478
00:19:36,580 --> 00:19:37,580
Okay.

479
00:19:37,580 --> 00:19:38,580
Yeah.

480
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:39,580
I will make a note.

481
00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:40,580
I totally should.

482
00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:41,560
And I'm also putting like postcards in there with like a little thank you note on there

483
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:44,180
because sometimes people leave little notes in their orders.

484
00:19:44,180 --> 00:19:47,540
And that whole thing, it's been like the last three weeks that I've been doing this.

485
00:19:47,540 --> 00:19:51,720
That whole thing has been every lesson I've got burned on the robe, I took and I applied

486
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:56,140
to this system that we're doing, one of the whole rooms in the studio has been completely

487
00:19:56,140 --> 00:20:01,320
transformed into like a swag bag, a ship and package operation room.

488
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:02,320
It's funny.

489
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:04,300
I have a trailer that's been transformed into something too.

490
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:09,120
Me and my good friend Walter really breaking it out.

491
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:13,440
I hope it means now that as a business, I've got my S figured out and it's something like

492
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:18,620
I can just now execute on a regular basis and not have these huge cock ups like before.

493
00:20:18,620 --> 00:20:21,180
I have so many questions.

494
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:23,800
How do you not screw up the trademarks all the time?

495
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:25,060
Like that is my Achilles heel.

496
00:20:25,060 --> 00:20:27,140
I get hammered on trademarks.

497
00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:30,900
West Paints as he confirms their studio is now a post office extension.

498
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:32,740
Do you guys get a pension?

499
00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:35,340
Wait, do you guys get like a federal pension now?

500
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:39,420
You hire a thousand monkeys as your lawyer and then one of the monkeys gets it right.

501
00:20:39,420 --> 00:20:40,420
You know what?

502
00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:42,940
I often think I don't have a very good lawyer.

503
00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:43,940
A good lawyer.

504
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:44,940
Really?

505
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:48,300
That's something like when I was younger, I thought was not a good thing to spend money

506
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:49,300
on.

507
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:52,780
And now that I'm older, I feel like that was that was like that was a key part in getting

508
00:20:52,780 --> 00:20:54,260
the company to go independent again.

509
00:20:54,260 --> 00:20:58,780
And all of that was a good legal team because I'm going to like I'm supposed to be doing

510
00:20:58,780 --> 00:21:01,300
those coder name.

511
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:02,300
I can't say.

512
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:05,860
Yeah, it turns out there's a company with the same name and wasn't too thrilled.

513
00:21:05,860 --> 00:21:09,100
A couple of other employees happened to listen to JB.

514
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:11,740
You know, I'd never worked with lawyers at the scale I worked with.

515
00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:16,660
I had I think at one point, I don't I think I can say I think at one point three or four,

516
00:21:16,660 --> 00:21:20,740
I think I had four lawyers working for me.

517
00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:23,960
And I've never done anything like that where I've actually had a whole team.

518
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:30,060
And that is extremely expensive, you know, like pay it off for a very long time kind

519
00:21:30,060 --> 00:21:31,140
of expensive.

520
00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:36,800
But they are they were very, very thorough, extremely thorough and very helpful.

521
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:40,240
And I realized it was it was essential to getting everything, you know, to basically

522
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:45,720
rebooting a business from something that was merged to then be independent again and re

523
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:49,760
separating out all the IP and all of that was just this massive task.

524
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:52,960
And to show some teeth that like you couldn't just get rolled.

525
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:57,660
Well, there's that and and and not to speak for the other party, but the other party really

526
00:21:57,660 --> 00:22:00,860
isn't interested in dealing with some guy, you know, there it's it's a legal team on

527
00:22:00,860 --> 00:22:01,860
their side, too.

528
00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:04,980
And that's they're more interested in interfacing with lawyers directly.

529
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:07,180
That's just how they prefer to do it, too.

530
00:22:07,180 --> 00:22:08,800
And to make sure all the bases are covered.

531
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:13,620
So yeah, so I guess it kind of makes me now I kind of laugh because I was going to say

532
00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:15,940
this next email is about a super expensive item.

533
00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:22,020
But then when I think about it in the terms of my lawyer bill, this is a teeny tiny drop

534
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:23,100
in the bucket with this.

535
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:27,500
So Mikel writes and no, it's actually Listener Michael writes in and he's following up on

536
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:32,460
your your kind of request for feedback on the AirPod Max's.

537
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:36,940
Get this and this kind of unfortunate thing, but it led the silver lining is he sent us

538
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:37,940
an email.

539
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:43,020
He said I had to fly, unfortunately, from California to Texas for a family emergency

540
00:22:43,020 --> 00:22:46,300
the same day that episode four hundred and ten was released last week's episode.

541
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:47,300
I'm sorry.

542
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:48,300
Yeah.

543
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:52,820
He says a day ahead of the trip, I purchased the AirPod Max's or how do you say it?

544
00:22:52,820 --> 00:22:53,820
I purchased AirPod Max.

545
00:22:53,820 --> 00:22:54,820
I'm not sure how.

546
00:22:54,820 --> 00:22:57,300
No, I thought it was plural.

547
00:22:57,300 --> 00:22:58,300
Isn't it not plural?

548
00:22:58,300 --> 00:23:00,140
They always say AirPod or iPhone.

549
00:23:00,140 --> 00:23:01,140
They never say I don't know.

550
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:02,140
But there's two.

551
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:03,140
All right, whatever.

552
00:23:03,140 --> 00:23:04,140
Let's just move on.

553
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:05,140
It's stupid.

554
00:23:05,140 --> 00:23:07,900
But it's it's when you read it out loud, you're like, how am I actually supposed to say this?

555
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:13,940
Also, side note, often a trip is a just is my justification for getting a new piece of

556
00:23:13,940 --> 00:23:14,940
gear as well.

557
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:18,540
So I'm right there with you on that one, Michael.

558
00:23:18,540 --> 00:23:22,820
So he decided to buy himself the AirPod Max's or AirPods Max.

559
00:23:22,820 --> 00:23:23,820
That's probably how you say it, right?

560
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:31,080
AirPods Max to enjoy a bubble of tranquility, he says, hoping that maybe the fellow passengers

561
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:33,640
around him were not creating a tube of death.

562
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:38,680
The sound isolation, he has to say, on the AirPod Max's was totally canceled out one

563
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:40,660
hundred percent of the airplane noise.

564
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:44,420
I didn't find it particularly hot or uncomfortable, didn't really cause any sweat accumulation

565
00:23:44,420 --> 00:23:46,500
over the couple of hours of usage.

566
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:50,280
California to Texas is what, two and a half, three hour flight?

567
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:54,380
It was my first time watching a movie with spatial audio, and it really added an extra

568
00:23:54,380 --> 00:23:56,060
level to the experience.

569
00:23:56,060 --> 00:23:59,020
After six hours of usage, the battery is still at sixty six percent.

570
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:02,900
So unlike the AirPods Pro and performing the single pod charging dance here, I know you

571
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:07,420
where you swap out the one pod at a time, these batteries last all day.

572
00:24:07,420 --> 00:24:09,980
Is it worth six hundred dollars after tax?

573
00:24:09,980 --> 00:24:15,660
I haven't had over-the-ear headphones since 2010 when my Bose QC2 died.

574
00:24:15,660 --> 00:24:20,940
So not being a place to really replace anything else or compare, I feel like I like them quite

575
00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:21,940
a bit.

576
00:24:21,940 --> 00:24:23,940
I feel okay about them.

577
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:25,820
So there you go, Mike.

578
00:24:25,820 --> 00:24:27,180
He feels okay about them.

579
00:24:27,180 --> 00:24:30,220
I think he's still a little sour about the cost, but functionally they worked pretty

580
00:24:30,220 --> 00:24:31,980
well for traveling.

581
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:34,340
So there you go, now you have a justification to pick some up.

582
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:38,060
No, I'm going all Windows these days, so I'm getting the Surface Pods.

583
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:40,700
Right, you gotta get those Surface, the Surface ones.

584
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:42,420
Wait, is that a real thing?

585
00:24:42,420 --> 00:24:44,780
I think they do have a pair of headphones.

586
00:24:44,780 --> 00:24:48,260
I was making a joke that they just copy Apple, but Jesus, really?

587
00:24:48,260 --> 00:24:49,940
Yeah, yeah, I think they do.

588
00:24:49,940 --> 00:24:51,700
Did I accidentally slam Microsoft?

589
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:52,780
And I really don't mean to.

590
00:24:52,780 --> 00:24:54,900
I'm sorry, Beelzebub, I apologize.

591
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:58,820
Yeah, hey, if you're doing, if you're going all in on the.NET, how come you didn't get

592
00:24:58,820 --> 00:25:01,020
a Surface Book?

593
00:25:01,020 --> 00:25:04,220
For the kind of ThinkPad money you just dropped on that carbon, you could probably get yourself

594
00:25:04,220 --> 00:25:05,940
a pretty nice Surface Book.

595
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:07,740
Do you want the joke reason or the real reason?

596
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:08,740
Well, I both, I suppose.

597
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:11,420
No, I want to know why, because they seem like they're decent computers now.

598
00:25:11,420 --> 00:25:12,420
That keyboard.

599
00:25:12,420 --> 00:25:15,260
Oh yeah, yeah.

600
00:25:15,260 --> 00:25:20,160
It's better than happiness or positive forward goals in your life.

601
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:23,260
That keyboard is what dreams are made of.

602
00:25:23,260 --> 00:25:24,260
Yeah.

603
00:25:24,260 --> 00:25:25,900
It's the Maltese Falcon of keyboards.

604
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:26,900
Okay.

605
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:32,180
I mean, I think they've actually gotten worse over the years myself, but they still are

606
00:25:32,180 --> 00:25:33,980
coming from a place of being pretty good.

607
00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:37,980
This is where Chris is trying to figure, is Mike joking, or is he going psycho?

608
00:25:37,980 --> 00:25:41,260
No, I mean, I agree they're good keyboards, so.

609
00:25:41,260 --> 00:25:45,940
Well, I'm assuming it's as good as the other Lenovo that is going to one of my employees,

610
00:25:45,940 --> 00:25:46,940
right?

611
00:25:46,940 --> 00:25:52,780
Now, if it is not, believe me, there will be hours of coverage on this one keyboard.

612
00:25:52,780 --> 00:25:57,460
Special breaking edition of the Koda radio program, breaking midweek with a special edition

613
00:25:57,460 --> 00:25:58,820
just to cover the keyboard.

614
00:25:58,820 --> 00:26:06,380
I will fly to China and probably get shot, but I will fly to China to scold the keyboard

615
00:26:06,380 --> 00:26:07,540
engineer.

616
00:26:07,540 --> 00:26:09,060
Could you imagine flying for that long?

617
00:26:09,060 --> 00:26:11,020
I just, people that do that, you're like.

618
00:26:11,020 --> 00:26:12,160
For a bad keyboard?

619
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:13,940
People that can fly for that long are a different breed.

620
00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:14,940
I just couldn't do it.

621
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:18,340
I could do anything to scold someone ruining the ThinkPad keyboard.

622
00:26:18,340 --> 00:26:22,180
Yeah, I guess, when you got a passion project like that.

623
00:26:22,180 --> 00:26:24,460
No, no, no, no, no, I stop.

624
00:26:24,460 --> 00:26:27,180
I am like the Liam Neeson of keyboards, OK?

625
00:26:27,180 --> 00:26:28,780
You have a certain set of skills.

626
00:26:28,780 --> 00:26:29,780
I have no skills.

627
00:26:29,780 --> 00:26:31,780
I'm just a maniac.

628
00:26:31,780 --> 00:26:37,140
Oh, OK, so you're like Liam Neeson with no skills.

629
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:38,140
None.

630
00:26:38,140 --> 00:26:45,100
I can barely zip my fly, but if they ruin my favorite keyboard, all of a sudden I become

631
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:46,140
Ra's al Ghul.

632
00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:49,420
I heard the news that ThinkPad, the ThinkPad keyboard's coming out with this new design

633
00:26:49,420 --> 00:26:51,460
called the, I think it's called the butterfly keyboard.

634
00:26:51,460 --> 00:26:52,460
You're going to love it.

635
00:26:52,460 --> 00:26:57,020
I have never heard a more hateful piece of content on my life to it is going to ban us

636
00:26:57,020 --> 00:26:58,020
for hate speech.

637
00:26:58,020 --> 00:27:00,860
I think I'm going to say I'm going to call Tim and that's it.

638
00:27:00,860 --> 00:27:01,860
We're off.

639
00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:02,860
We're done.

640
00:27:02,860 --> 00:27:05,340
The whole of J.B. is gone because you had to say that slur, man.

641
00:27:05,340 --> 00:27:08,660
There goes that new podcast membership deal that I was working with them on, although

642
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:13,340
you know that Apple really is like settling butterfly lawsuits now, right?

643
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:14,620
Yeah, that's true.

644
00:27:14,620 --> 00:27:15,620
We should.

645
00:27:15,620 --> 00:27:16,620
We should come up with them.

646
00:27:16,620 --> 00:27:17,940
Maybe that'd be a good like finance strategy for the show.

647
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:25,300
I have enough of them if they can only ignore the very obvious liquid damage.

648
00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:27,260
Linode.com slash coder.

649
00:27:27,260 --> 00:27:30,460
You know, Linode is the largest independent cloud computing provider.

650
00:27:30,460 --> 00:27:34,900
They've been around since 2003 and they have focused on making their product fantastic.

651
00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:37,660
They're easy to use and they have a powerful cloud dashboard.

652
00:27:37,660 --> 00:27:42,740
I talk about their servers a lot because we use the snot out of Linode servers.

653
00:27:42,740 --> 00:27:48,300
I generally deploy on their East Coast and their Texas server and for my personal stuff

654
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:52,740
I deploy in California, but they've actually got 11 data centers around the world.

655
00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:54,060
Super fast connections.

656
00:27:54,060 --> 00:27:55,060
Really fast.

657
00:27:55,060 --> 00:27:57,500
Years ago, Linode became their own ISP.

658
00:27:57,500 --> 00:28:01,220
By the way, just kind of like a side advantage of being around forever on the internet and

659
00:28:01,220 --> 00:28:06,720
before AWS even started is you can do things like you become your own ISP.

660
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:10,260
They're just doing the stuff that makes their service even better, whatever it takes.

661
00:28:10,260 --> 00:28:16,460
And one of the things I love that can change your game is their simple one click application

662
00:28:16,460 --> 00:28:17,580
deployments.

663
00:28:17,580 --> 00:28:22,380
If you want to just get something up and running really quick with a great default setup, maybe

664
00:28:22,380 --> 00:28:26,320
it's just a base system with containers that are ready to go and then you'll just go pull

665
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:27,980
down the containers you want specifically.

666
00:28:27,980 --> 00:28:29,500
Or maybe you want the full stack.

667
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:32,140
They've got a whole bunch to choose from.

668
00:28:32,140 --> 00:28:37,220
Also they've got some personal systems like gaming systems and file sync systems that

669
00:28:37,220 --> 00:28:38,860
you might just want to use for yourself.

670
00:28:38,860 --> 00:28:43,040
And with their whole range of prices, and they're generally 30 to 50% cheaper than the

671
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:46,560
other cloud providers out there, there's something that's going to work for you.

672
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:51,060
So go get that $100 credit by going to linode.com slash coder.

673
00:28:51,060 --> 00:28:52,540
Go sign up for a new account.

674
00:28:52,540 --> 00:28:53,540
Go to that URL.

675
00:28:53,540 --> 00:28:57,460
Get the credit and try it out for 60 days because there's a lot to do, including S3

676
00:28:57,460 --> 00:29:01,220
compatible object storage, which could be a great way to do some configuration backup

677
00:29:01,220 --> 00:29:03,500
to the cloud or run a static website.

678
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:05,380
There's a lot you can do there.

679
00:29:05,380 --> 00:29:09,700
And you can try it all out in their really easy to use dashboard.

680
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:10,700
It's simple.

681
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:11,700
It's powerful.

682
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:12,700
And you're going to love it.

683
00:29:12,700 --> 00:29:13,700
It's just one thing you got to do.

684
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:16,120
You just got to go to linode.com slash coder.

685
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:22,260
Get that $100 in 60 day credit and of course you support the show.

686
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:25,260
Linode is dedicated to offering the best in virtualized cloud computing.

687
00:29:25,260 --> 00:29:31,900
So go to linode.com slash coder, support the show and get that $100.

688
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:35,980
What do you think about covering this question we got on Twitter?

689
00:29:35,980 --> 00:29:41,960
And it really comes down to why is recruitment in tech just such a fricking disaster?

690
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:45,580
We had somebody, Henry Tweedis, he says, I was recently brought into a firm.

691
00:29:45,580 --> 00:29:50,620
I was told by the CTO during hiring that I was going to be the sole developer and I'd

692
00:29:50,620 --> 00:29:52,380
have free choice of technology.

693
00:29:52,380 --> 00:29:56,900
Now I learned that they're telling me to use node plus express plus Mongo monoliths.

694
00:29:56,900 --> 00:29:57,900
Why oh why?

695
00:29:57,900 --> 00:30:04,180
Well, I'm sorry, I wasn't listening until I heard node and Mongo and then I, my heart

696
00:30:04,180 --> 00:30:06,700
literally stopped and I started bleeding.

697
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:09,540
Have you ever seen the exorcism of Emily Rose?

698
00:30:09,540 --> 00:30:11,620
You're all with the stories and movies tonight.

699
00:30:11,620 --> 00:30:13,760
Yeah, that's a, that's a lot of blood, man.

700
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:15,660
That's a, we don't start on time.

701
00:30:15,660 --> 00:30:17,380
I just really lose control.

702
00:30:17,380 --> 00:30:22,200
Yeah, no, just, um, well if you need the money, take the money, but understand that when you're

703
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:25,660
writing node, you're doing a bad thing.

704
00:30:25,660 --> 00:30:29,460
When you're using Mongo DB, definitely questionable.

705
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:32,940
When you're doing both at the same time, it feels like a, he got a little bait and switch

706
00:30:32,940 --> 00:30:33,940
eh?

707
00:30:33,940 --> 00:30:37,700
Well of course, because no good developer would volunteer for that job, right?

708
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:40,660
Don't tell him no, cause you're trying to get me to say something crazy, which I will

709
00:30:40,660 --> 00:30:41,660
gladly do.

710
00:30:41,660 --> 00:30:43,540
Would you like to be a guard at Stalag 13?

711
00:30:43,540 --> 00:30:45,700
No, I don't think so.

712
00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:48,220
Would you like to be an officer in our, in our military?

713
00:30:48,220 --> 00:30:49,220
Yes.

714
00:30:49,220 --> 00:30:50,220
Congratulations.

715
00:30:50,220 --> 00:30:51,220
You're the commandant.

716
00:30:51,220 --> 00:30:52,220
No, that's bad.

717
00:30:52,220 --> 00:30:54,860
See, I wasn't sure if you were going to take the route of, of course he should just do

718
00:30:54,860 --> 00:30:57,940
whatever they want because he took the job, but you're right, they totally bait and switched

719
00:30:57,940 --> 00:30:58,940
him.

720
00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:01,100
There are certain things we don't do for money.

721
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:03,460
One of them is JavaScript on the server.

722
00:31:03,460 --> 00:31:05,100
I know we've talked about this.

723
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:06,100
I should know better.

724
00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:09,740
And I, I've spent between the shelf where we are 13 theory at.

725
00:31:09,740 --> 00:31:12,140
I think it's like our hundredth year, man.

726
00:31:12,140 --> 00:31:13,140
I mean, think about it.

727
00:31:13,140 --> 00:31:15,780
I mean, I, we don't even sound like the same people anymore.

728
00:31:15,780 --> 00:31:16,780
It's been so long.

729
00:31:16,780 --> 00:31:22,780
The only thing I haven't changed my mind on is one no needs to fix it.

730
00:31:22,780 --> 00:31:30,420
Okay, one of the seven things I haven't changed my mind, all right, the seven holy grails.

731
00:31:30,420 --> 00:31:34,980
JavaScript does not belong on the God damn server.

732
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:38,100
I did it once and it cost me a fortune.

733
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:39,100
Don't do it.

734
00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:40,820
It's a bad idea.

735
00:31:40,820 --> 00:31:45,460
If you need the money, understand that you're screwing over your employer and that's fine.

736
00:31:45,460 --> 00:31:48,900
Listen, if they're dumb enough to buy that and they deserve what they get, they're probably

737
00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:50,420
running Zeus on the server too.

738
00:31:50,420 --> 00:31:52,420
If they're that dumb, let's be honest.

739
00:31:52,420 --> 00:31:57,700
You want to go here, you want to, you want to do this fucker?

740
00:31:57,700 --> 00:31:59,140
I can't help it.

741
00:31:59,140 --> 00:32:00,140
You got me riled up.

742
00:32:00,140 --> 00:32:01,140
I can't help it.

743
00:32:01,140 --> 00:32:02,140
Now you got me all riled up.

744
00:32:02,140 --> 00:32:03,140
Oh yeah.

745
00:32:03,140 --> 00:32:04,680
They're so dumb cause they're running a stable operating system.

746
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:08,660
Not like some like a boon to where canonical is like, Oh my God, we need money.

747
00:32:08,660 --> 00:32:09,660
We'll make a deal with anybody.

748
00:32:09,660 --> 00:32:12,700
The canonical has got to skirt up and slag out to anybody.

749
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:14,460
All of a sudden they're best friends with Microsoft.

750
00:32:14,460 --> 00:32:16,780
At least I say that I'm a prostitute.

751
00:32:16,780 --> 00:32:18,820
He's a jackass.

752
00:32:18,820 --> 00:32:20,700
Even Barack can't save you this time.

753
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:21,700
No.

754
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:22,700
Yeah.

755
00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:23,700
As you were, as you were.

756
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:24,700
I mean, so you're right.

757
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:25,700
So should he quit?

758
00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:26,700
No, of course not.

759
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:27,700
Take the money.

760
00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:29,660
What are you, a pie?

761
00:32:29,660 --> 00:32:36,340
Take the money, but tell them, like you should warn them that you're using deeply questionable

762
00:32:36,340 --> 00:32:40,020
language that is not meant for backend technologies.

763
00:32:40,020 --> 00:32:45,380
And if you're using node, that is a single threaded situation, which is exactly what

764
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:49,460
you don't want for, I know somebody's going to send in, will these high activity websites?

765
00:32:49,460 --> 00:32:52,380
Yeah, I know, but it's a pain in the ass to get it to work.

766
00:32:52,380 --> 00:32:53,380
Also Mongo.

767
00:32:53,380 --> 00:32:54,380
Yes.

768
00:32:54,380 --> 00:33:00,340
Let's make our application faster by doing magical things that like kind of work, but

769
00:33:00,340 --> 00:33:03,980
you know, are dangerous and have some questionable ethics behind them.

770
00:33:03,980 --> 00:33:08,240
That's your another half life reference, or you could use a good database.

771
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:12,660
The answer to your problem is Postgres and my SQL.

772
00:33:12,660 --> 00:33:19,180
If you are old, I'm like PHP, but Postgres it's just Postgres.

773
00:33:19,180 --> 00:33:22,900
Old classic, reliable, stable.

774
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:25,340
I don't want to, I don't want to hear about Cassandra.

775
00:33:25,340 --> 00:33:27,180
I don't want to hear about Pollyanna.

776
00:33:27,180 --> 00:33:30,060
I don't want to hear about Susie Q. I don't want to hear about Mongo.

777
00:33:30,060 --> 00:33:32,060
No, some of those were made up.

778
00:33:32,060 --> 00:33:35,540
Don't bring, don't bring any of those up, especially the Susie Q one that gets me so

779
00:33:35,540 --> 00:33:36,540
fired up.

780
00:33:36,540 --> 00:33:42,220
Postgres in fact has some of the definitely questionable features that Mongo brought to

781
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:46,740
the world because it was, they had to, they were forced, their hand was forced.

782
00:33:46,740 --> 00:33:47,740
What could they do?

783
00:33:47,740 --> 00:33:52,100
These jackasses in California decided why should we have data integrity?

784
00:33:52,100 --> 00:33:55,860
No, let's just pin our data to a table and give it a night or I'll never forget.

785
00:33:55,860 --> 00:33:58,100
That is a, I should attribute that extra normal.

786
00:33:58,100 --> 00:33:59,100
Great videos.

787
00:33:59,100 --> 00:34:01,740
And I agree with them, except on their Ruby thing, Ruby's great.

788
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:03,740
They're just wrong.

789
00:34:03,740 --> 00:34:05,160
Everything about what you said is bad.

790
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:08,020
So clearly he takes them for everything they're worth while looking for a new job.

791
00:34:08,020 --> 00:34:09,020
Is that what you're saying?

792
00:34:09,020 --> 00:34:10,620
I mean, cause they're, they're never going to be successful.

793
00:34:10,620 --> 00:34:12,940
So right, right.

794
00:34:12,940 --> 00:34:16,340
This is Karen Ebers questions to ask next time.

795
00:34:16,340 --> 00:34:18,300
And you tell me what you think of these.

796
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:21,880
Number one, the number, this is what the, the person getting high, you know, when they,

797
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:24,100
when they say, do you have any questions for us?

798
00:34:24,100 --> 00:34:25,580
Which is always like the hardest things.

799
00:34:25,580 --> 00:34:26,580
Like what the hell do you say?

800
00:34:26,580 --> 00:34:27,940
Here's what you say.

801
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:30,700
You ask them, how did you start your last team meeting?

802
00:34:30,700 --> 00:34:34,460
Cause you're trying to get a sense for what kind of w yeah, what kind of place it is.

803
00:34:34,460 --> 00:34:35,460
All right.

804
00:34:35,460 --> 00:34:36,460
Here's another one.

805
00:34:36,460 --> 00:34:39,900
Number two, do you fully disconnect during the holidays and vacations?

806
00:34:39,900 --> 00:34:40,900
Hmm.

807
00:34:40,900 --> 00:34:42,220
I mean, everything is yes.

808
00:34:42,220 --> 00:34:43,220
They're never going to say yes.

809
00:34:43,220 --> 00:34:44,220
Yeah.

810
00:34:44,220 --> 00:34:45,220
Yeah.

811
00:34:45,220 --> 00:34:46,220
They're going to say yes.

812
00:34:46,220 --> 00:34:47,220
You might be able to get a read.

813
00:34:47,220 --> 00:34:50,420
Well, I see where she's going, but yeah, you might be able to get a read.

814
00:34:50,420 --> 00:34:55,020
Like, uh, I know one time I had a new boss come on the scene who was like an always connected,

815
00:34:55,020 --> 00:34:57,340
always online and then expected you to be online.

816
00:34:57,340 --> 00:35:01,380
And I wish I had known that because you know, I found out the hard way.

817
00:35:01,380 --> 00:35:02,380
Here's number three.

818
00:35:02,380 --> 00:35:05,920
I don't know if I love this one cause this also seems like they'd kind of dodge, but

819
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:08,620
number three, describe a recent success or win.

820
00:35:08,620 --> 00:35:09,740
That's a question you're asking them.

821
00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:10,740
Okay.

822
00:35:10,740 --> 00:35:14,180
Could you, could you describe to me one of your team's recent successes or wins is the

823
00:35:14,180 --> 00:35:16,460
question you would supposedly ask?

824
00:35:16,460 --> 00:35:17,460
I don't know.

825
00:35:17,460 --> 00:35:21,980
I mean, cause the manager would feel they couldn't bash on a teammate, even if the teammate

826
00:35:21,980 --> 00:35:22,980
forked up.

827
00:35:22,980 --> 00:35:23,980
Right.

828
00:35:23,980 --> 00:35:24,980
But I like it.

829
00:35:24,980 --> 00:35:25,980
I kind of like it.

830
00:35:25,980 --> 00:35:28,940
But here's the problem when you're hiring.

831
00:35:28,940 --> 00:35:34,060
And if you're me, which that's a set of, that's almost like using note and Mongo at the same

832
00:35:34,060 --> 00:35:35,060
time.

833
00:35:35,060 --> 00:35:37,820
That's just a bad set of constraints.

834
00:35:37,820 --> 00:35:41,220
The thing I'm looking for an interview is this asshole going to suit me.

835
00:35:41,220 --> 00:35:43,900
So someone who's asking me these tough questions, I don't care how good you are.

836
00:35:43,900 --> 00:35:44,900
I don't want you.

837
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:45,900
Yeah.

838
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:46,900
You do it.

839
00:35:46,900 --> 00:35:48,940
You might be able to get away with telling me how you started your last team meeting,

840
00:35:48,940 --> 00:35:51,260
but it's actually such a, no, that's perfectly cool.

841
00:35:51,260 --> 00:35:54,700
I actually liked the question, but they like, tell me the last time you could see it, even

842
00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:55,700
that would be like, what?

843
00:35:55,700 --> 00:35:59,060
Oh, um, uh, no, really?

844
00:35:59,060 --> 00:36:00,060
What's wrong with that?

845
00:36:00,060 --> 00:36:02,100
Like I could say we talked about our weekend, right?

846
00:36:02,100 --> 00:36:03,780
Like that's what we usually do.

847
00:36:03,780 --> 00:36:06,620
We talked about, you know, we all have kids.

848
00:36:06,620 --> 00:36:08,220
It's just, it's just so unusual.

849
00:36:08,220 --> 00:36:09,220
Is it?

850
00:36:09,220 --> 00:36:14,140
I would say I have never been on the other side of the coin except for like down back

851
00:36:14,140 --> 00:36:16,780
in 19, 1874 when objective C was popular.

852
00:36:16,780 --> 00:36:17,780
Yes.

853
00:36:17,780 --> 00:36:18,780
Yes.

854
00:36:18,780 --> 00:36:19,780
Yeah.

855
00:36:19,780 --> 00:36:20,980
I would say we both agree.

856
00:36:20,980 --> 00:36:23,180
Try to ask the, tell me how you started your meeting one.

857
00:36:23,180 --> 00:36:24,780
What's the, what was the next question?

858
00:36:24,780 --> 00:36:25,780
Well they have a couple other ones.

859
00:36:25,780 --> 00:36:30,620
I just don't really like a lot like, uh, uh, tell me, tell me about a time a team member

860
00:36:30,620 --> 00:36:34,180
changed your mind or what's your ideal person for this role.

861
00:36:34,180 --> 00:36:38,140
I can tell you about a time I had a team member who sent a racially insensitive comments to

862
00:36:38,140 --> 00:36:42,460
a customer and he changed my mind about his employment.

863
00:36:42,460 --> 00:36:43,460
That's easy.

864
00:36:43,460 --> 00:36:44,460
Next.

865
00:36:44,460 --> 00:36:45,460
Next question.

866
00:36:45,460 --> 00:36:49,940
Who have you promoted and why promoted something cause they did a good job.

867
00:36:49,940 --> 00:36:52,140
And why is because they did a good job.

868
00:36:52,140 --> 00:36:54,780
So that's the, uh, yeah, that's a, yeah.

869
00:36:54,780 --> 00:36:55,780
Okay.

870
00:36:55,780 --> 00:36:56,780
And here's the last one.

871
00:36:56,780 --> 00:37:00,260
And again, these last few, I don't really think these are going to work, but I get where

872
00:37:00,260 --> 00:37:01,260
they're going.

873
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:02,260
I get where Karen's going with this.

874
00:37:02,260 --> 00:37:04,300
My jerk off a white guy answers are going to be great.

875
00:37:04,300 --> 00:37:05,300
So let's go.

876
00:37:05,300 --> 00:37:07,540
How do you focus on your own growth and development?

877
00:37:07,540 --> 00:37:09,260
My growth is not your concern.

878
00:37:09,260 --> 00:37:10,260
Next.

879
00:37:10,260 --> 00:37:13,300
Well, that doesn't help us here.

880
00:37:13,300 --> 00:37:14,300
Does it?

881
00:37:14,300 --> 00:37:18,060
Uh, that, uh, yeah, that's probably what they would say, right?

882
00:37:18,060 --> 00:37:19,060
I'm the president of the company.

883
00:37:19,060 --> 00:37:20,060
That is my answer.

884
00:37:20,060 --> 00:37:21,060
Right?

885
00:37:21,060 --> 00:37:22,060
Yeah, that's true.

886
00:37:22,060 --> 00:37:23,360
I, I could kind of see that.

887
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:27,440
There was one I left out, but I do now looking at the list, I see here's one last one.

888
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:29,700
Tell me about a disagreement or conflict on the team.

889
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:30,700
One time.

890
00:37:30,700 --> 00:37:31,700
Interesting.

891
00:37:31,700 --> 00:37:32,700
I actually liked this one.

892
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:37,260
I, you know what I would have to pick if there's too many to count, but like we've changed

893
00:37:37,260 --> 00:37:38,260
it.

894
00:37:38,260 --> 00:37:42,340
In all our wars of hybrid mobile platforms, there's been many, it would take more time

895
00:37:42,340 --> 00:37:48,620
to think of a good answer to that, but definitely, um, yeah, particularly in terms of actually

896
00:37:48,620 --> 00:37:49,620
I would say job.

897
00:37:49,620 --> 00:37:50,620
I forget the hybrid stuff.

898
00:37:50,620 --> 00:37:51,620
JavaScript frameworks.

899
00:37:51,620 --> 00:37:55,900
In fact, we covered it on the show, the view versus angular fight versus react.

900
00:37:55,900 --> 00:37:58,560
It was mostly a few versus angular.

901
00:37:58,560 --> 00:37:59,560
That was brutal.

902
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:03,620
That was like at some point that started getting weirdly personal.

903
00:38:03,620 --> 00:38:06,980
Like people started getting, taking, yeah, that's actually a good question.

904
00:38:06,980 --> 00:38:08,380
So I actually don't think these are all bad.

905
00:38:08,380 --> 00:38:10,520
I mean, would I actually answer them honestly?

906
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:11,520
Of course not.

907
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:12,760
But I don't know.

908
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:16,260
You still might be able to get something out of the answers people give you to those.

909
00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:19,260
Well, what I would get out of someone who asked me this question is that I'm not going

910
00:38:19,260 --> 00:38:24,340
to hire them, but Hey, listen, if it makes you feel better, well, I was just, you know,

911
00:38:24,340 --> 00:38:28,460
I was trying to think of what to do for our, our poor tweeter who, uh, Henry who tweeted

912
00:38:28,460 --> 00:38:29,460
us.

913
00:38:29,460 --> 00:38:31,220
Henry, can I, can I give you some advice?

914
00:38:31,220 --> 00:38:36,060
If you're working for a small or looking to work at a small business, the thing that person

915
00:38:36,060 --> 00:38:39,300
is most afraid of is getting sued by his employees.

916
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:43,260
And any employee that looks like a troublemaker is not going to get hired.

917
00:38:43,260 --> 00:38:45,260
Yeah, that's probably very true.

918
00:38:45,260 --> 00:38:46,260
Mm hmm.

919
00:38:46,260 --> 00:38:47,260
Yeah.

920
00:38:47,260 --> 00:38:48,260
I mean, Chris, come on, act me up.

921
00:38:48,260 --> 00:38:49,260
Right.

922
00:38:49,260 --> 00:38:51,300
Someone who, who like gives you attitude on the interview that you're not going to be

923
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:52,300
impressed.

924
00:38:52,300 --> 00:38:56,100
You might be like, wow, they have skills, but also, I mean, you have a team of 17 lawyers,

925
00:38:56,100 --> 00:38:57,100
so you're like, whatever.

926
00:38:57,100 --> 00:39:02,060
Well, no, it's, it's, um, it's about, well, it's kind of along the same lines of picking

927
00:39:02,060 --> 00:39:05,540
a good lawyer is an extremely expensive decision and it's one you do.

928
00:39:05,540 --> 00:39:06,540
Right.

929
00:39:06,540 --> 00:39:08,220
Hiring a bad employee is the same thing.

930
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:10,020
You weigh a lot of pros and cons when you do it.

931
00:39:10,020 --> 00:39:14,020
They're very expensive and they're necessary business things that you have to do, but it's

932
00:39:14,020 --> 00:39:20,140
a very expensive thing and it's not just cost of like wage, it's, it's equipment costs,

933
00:39:20,140 --> 00:39:22,540
it's training time, it's integration time.

934
00:39:22,540 --> 00:39:26,500
It's any mistakes that get made while that person's coming up to speed that have to be

935
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:30,700
dealt with that affect the business in some way, which always happens, um, all that stuff

936
00:39:30,700 --> 00:39:32,460
factors into the cost.

937
00:39:32,460 --> 00:39:38,660
So I will tell you the worst I've only had two employees that I've ever fired.

938
00:39:38,660 --> 00:39:42,100
One actually did the thing I said, sent religiously insensitive things to someone.

939
00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:46,420
That's just like when I say insensitive, I mean like outright just bad.

940
00:39:46,420 --> 00:39:47,420
You're fired.

941
00:39:47,420 --> 00:39:48,420
Goodbye.

942
00:39:48,420 --> 00:39:50,120
Go fork yourself.

943
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:53,580
The other one just couldn't admit that he made a mistake.

944
00:39:53,580 --> 00:39:56,820
Then he made the same mistake again and a cost.

945
00:39:56,820 --> 00:39:58,940
It wasn't like windows phone eight money.

946
00:39:58,940 --> 00:40:00,140
There you go, Chris.

947
00:40:00,140 --> 00:40:01,140
I gave it to you.

948
00:40:01,140 --> 00:40:07,620
Good old times, but it was, you know, it was certainly more than a bar tap.

949
00:40:07,620 --> 00:40:10,100
So and he was kind of a prima donna.

950
00:40:10,100 --> 00:40:12,240
I got to tell you, I don't hire prima donnas.

951
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:15,580
So if somebody came to me, I like some of these questions, but if somebody came to me

952
00:40:15,580 --> 00:40:19,980
were a small company with these kinds of questions, some of them would have been okay, but like

953
00:40:19,980 --> 00:40:25,300
no, I'm sorry, but I don't care how well you did on the programming test.

954
00:40:25,300 --> 00:40:26,820
You're not getting a job cause you're, you know what?

955
00:40:26,820 --> 00:40:28,820
You're not going to meld with team.

956
00:40:28,820 --> 00:40:30,220
You're not going to be a team player.

957
00:40:30,220 --> 00:40:31,620
You know, it does work.

958
00:40:31,620 --> 00:40:36,260
And of course this sounds self-serving, but I hear this a lot from the audience is when

959
00:40:36,260 --> 00:40:42,460
the interviewee is asked, what do you do to, you know, train up and, and, and stay within

960
00:40:42,460 --> 00:40:43,460
it.

961
00:40:43,460 --> 00:40:48,820
When people say podcasts, I listened to podcasts, uh, it counts, you know, cause it, I think

962
00:40:48,820 --> 00:40:53,060
that shows that people are, but that's backfires because when they say they listen to stuff

963
00:40:53,060 --> 00:40:56,340
like Linux action news, yeah, well then they don't get the job.

964
00:40:56,340 --> 00:40:57,340
Yeah, obviously.

965
00:40:57,340 --> 00:40:59,540
Well, they get fired on the, I mean, they don't even get the job.

966
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:03,060
I mean, now they get, they, they call the police, they escort them out the building.

967
00:41:03,060 --> 00:41:06,380
The worst in the like, oh, I listened to this great coding podcast called ATP and I just

968
00:41:06,380 --> 00:41:07,380
said, get the f**k out.

969
00:41:07,380 --> 00:41:11,700
Like it's just, and I sit there like I'm like a little dog waiting for a tree.

970
00:41:11,700 --> 00:41:15,140
Any, any other coding podcasts you listen to?

971
00:41:15,140 --> 00:41:19,580
I kind of put my Coderadio, you know, coaster, like I kind of push it forward.

972
00:41:19,580 --> 00:41:20,580
Any, any others?

973
00:41:20,580 --> 00:41:24,980
It's like, no, you know, but it does, it demonstrates that somebody has enough interest that they're

974
00:41:24,980 --> 00:41:26,900
going out and seeking out content and listening to it.

975
00:41:26,900 --> 00:41:30,380
And that's a good, I think that's a good data point for a hirer to say, oh, this person

976
00:41:30,380 --> 00:41:32,300
is actually interested.

977
00:41:32,300 --> 00:41:34,720
Not if it's ATP or developing with respect.

978
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:36,960
Or yeah, let's be honest, our show, right?

979
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:40,180
That's a bad sign.

980
00:41:40,180 --> 00:41:41,660
There's cursing in that podcast.

981
00:41:41,660 --> 00:41:47,820
Did the man who used to write Objective-C and had his life destroyed by Swift get upset?

982
00:41:47,820 --> 00:41:53,560
You know, Tim Cook emails me every week, Michael, the APIs are the same.

983
00:41:53,560 --> 00:41:58,700
If you would calm down and get off that goddamn Lenovo, just like open X, go to once, you

984
00:41:58,700 --> 00:41:59,700
would see it.

985
00:41:59,700 --> 00:42:03,020
Yeah, but then he leaves sent from my iPad in the signature and that's just so lazy.

986
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:04,200
No, it's worse.

987
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:06,940
He says sent from my Apple car and I'm like, Uncle Tim, is that true?

988
00:42:06,940 --> 00:42:08,660
And he's like, wink.

989
00:42:08,660 --> 00:42:14,100
Honestly, if I was a higher up Apple exec, I totally would change my signature to say

990
00:42:14,100 --> 00:42:15,580
sent from Apple car.

991
00:42:15,580 --> 00:42:16,900
I mean, why not?

992
00:42:16,900 --> 00:42:18,540
Have some fun with it.

993
00:42:18,540 --> 00:42:19,940
You know, just have some fun with it.

994
00:42:19,940 --> 00:42:22,980
We are way over, but WWC is coming.

995
00:42:22,980 --> 00:42:25,060
I just want to take an Apple tangent.

996
00:42:25,060 --> 00:42:26,340
OK, go ahead.

997
00:42:26,340 --> 00:42:31,540
As I said last week, I don't believe it's like physics wise viable to get the batteries

998
00:42:31,540 --> 00:42:36,460
that small to make functional AR glasses.

999
00:42:36,460 --> 00:42:41,260
But if they can, that is going to be an iPhone level of it.

1000
00:42:41,260 --> 00:42:46,700
You know how you do it is by making the phone do all the CPU tasks and just it's a Bluetooth

1001
00:42:46,700 --> 00:42:47,980
connection back to the.

1002
00:42:47,980 --> 00:42:49,540
That's still it's still a lot, though.

1003
00:42:49,540 --> 00:42:50,980
I thought about it when you said that last week.

1004
00:42:50,980 --> 00:42:56,620
It's still I mean, think about it, just the visual rendering to have it not be crap.

1005
00:42:56,620 --> 00:42:59,500
And remember, you don't want it to be crap because you'll damage people's eyes.

1006
00:42:59,500 --> 00:43:03,180
Yeah, that's why I think you got to figure it's going to start as more like a headset.

1007
00:43:03,180 --> 00:43:04,180
I don't know.

1008
00:43:04,180 --> 00:43:08,300
I mean, but I've seen so I think we talked about last week Microsoft has a contract,

1009
00:43:08,300 --> 00:43:12,140
the US Army for the HoloLens, and they do some manufacturing stuff.

1010
00:43:12,140 --> 00:43:18,040
I have since been very impressive in our dotnet, joking aside about me selling my soul to Satan.

1011
00:43:18,040 --> 00:43:22,740
The Microsoft AR stuff is super impressive, but they're Microsoft.

1012
00:43:22,740 --> 00:43:27,720
They couldn't sell crack to a crack head in the consumer space.

1013
00:43:27,720 --> 00:43:35,520
If Apple can somehow just like break into their labs, steal the HoloLens, make it less

1014
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:42,140
Blade Runner and go on, it would be maybe they do an app store model.

1015
00:43:42,140 --> 00:43:43,940
They'd make the whole thing just to sell apps, dude.

1016
00:43:43,940 --> 00:43:45,980
The whole thing at the end of the day just be to sell apps.

1017
00:43:45,980 --> 00:43:50,340
Yeah, I love apps.

1018
00:43:50,340 --> 00:43:52,100
I did well in the app store way back when.

1019
00:43:52,100 --> 00:43:54,420
I got to tell you, the app store is a waste of time.

1020
00:43:54,420 --> 00:43:55,740
But that's how they would do it.

1021
00:43:55,740 --> 00:43:56,900
That's how they do glasses.

1022
00:43:56,900 --> 00:43:59,100
You can't app store enterprise software.

1023
00:43:59,100 --> 00:44:00,180
You just can't.

1024
00:44:00,180 --> 00:44:01,380
I agree.

1025
00:44:01,380 --> 00:44:04,420
They might do some sort of management distribution for that.

1026
00:44:04,420 --> 00:44:06,260
Yeah, but they try to tie.

1027
00:44:06,260 --> 00:44:11,480
Okay, there is a long conversation for next week about how Apple deals with developers

1028
00:44:11,480 --> 00:44:18,140
deal with the enterprise.

1029
00:44:18,140 --> 00:44:22,420
Analyze code level performance across your environment and troubleshoot issues faster

1030
00:44:22,420 --> 00:44:23,900
with Datadog.

1031
00:44:23,900 --> 00:44:27,740
Datadog has this continuous profiler that automatically collects profiles from your

1032
00:44:27,740 --> 00:44:30,220
production servers all the time.

1033
00:44:30,220 --> 00:44:37,180
So you can go back like a time wizard at any point and quickly analyze your data.

1034
00:44:37,180 --> 00:44:41,780
Only instead of doing it with your hands like a wizard, you're doing it with the mouse and

1035
00:44:41,780 --> 00:44:42,880
their dashboard.

1036
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:47,040
Get a unified picture of your environment by correlating code performance metrics with

1037
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:49,420
your other monitoring data in real time.

1038
00:44:49,420 --> 00:44:51,220
I'm talking full stack.

1039
00:44:51,220 --> 00:44:54,060
Log management also worked in there with that continuous profile.

1040
00:44:54,060 --> 00:44:58,340
You can check application performance, server performance, site performance, get it across

1041
00:44:58,340 --> 00:45:03,380
the whole picture of time and bring it all together with their beautiful live dashboards.

1042
00:45:03,380 --> 00:45:09,220
You can pinpoint the cause of issues fast, communicate the problem, and identify future

1043
00:45:09,220 --> 00:45:11,860
problems and make decisions as well.

1044
00:45:11,860 --> 00:45:18,020
So go try Datadog's products for free for 14 days by visiting datadog.com slash coderradio.

1045
00:45:18,020 --> 00:45:22,020
And for a limited time, if you start a free trial and create one dashboard, you'll get

1046
00:45:22,020 --> 00:45:23,020
a free Datadog t-shirt.

1047
00:45:23,020 --> 00:45:24,020
Yeah, that's right.

1048
00:45:24,020 --> 00:45:25,020
I said swag.

1049
00:45:25,020 --> 00:45:29,360
So you got to go to datadog.com slash coderradio.

1050
00:45:29,360 --> 00:45:30,820
That does three things.

1051
00:45:30,820 --> 00:45:33,060
You get that free 14-day trial.

1052
00:45:33,060 --> 00:45:37,340
You get in there, you create a dashboard, you get a t-shirt, and you support the show.

1053
00:45:37,340 --> 00:45:42,860
So that's datadog.com slash coderradio.

1054
00:45:42,860 --> 00:45:47,100
So David writes in, I know you guys have been thinking and talking about the Epic versus

1055
00:45:47,100 --> 00:45:50,860
Apple battle and its long-term ramifications for the developer market.

1056
00:45:50,860 --> 00:45:54,900
I know that Epic isn't necessarily one of those companies that's fighting for good given

1057
00:45:54,900 --> 00:45:56,300
their emails.

1058
00:45:56,300 --> 00:46:03,340
However, do you think that Apple basing the iPad Pro now on the M1 changes things?

1059
00:46:03,340 --> 00:46:08,100
When phones and tablets were introduced, they were not considered general computing devices.

1060
00:46:08,100 --> 00:46:12,740
They had these low-end custom processors, and they were not expected by law or practice

1061
00:46:12,740 --> 00:46:16,700
to offer any way to install software outside the App Store.

1062
00:46:16,700 --> 00:46:24,920
But now, the iPad has an M1, which could technically make it a general computing device, no.

1063
00:46:24,920 --> 00:46:29,700
And if that's true, that changes the implications for what that expectation is and may have

1064
00:46:29,700 --> 00:46:32,300
ramifications for Epic's case.

1065
00:46:32,300 --> 00:46:36,180
Perhaps Epic could argue that now that the iPad Pro has a desktop class processor, it

1066
00:46:36,180 --> 00:46:42,280
is essentially a general computing device, yet runs the same iPad OS which locks it down.

1067
00:46:42,280 --> 00:46:47,500
This would imply that the iPad should be considered a general computing device, and that the stranglehold

1068
00:46:47,500 --> 00:46:51,860
that Apple has been installing and insisting on would have to be removed, and that it would

1069
00:46:51,860 --> 00:46:54,900
have to be a fair marketplace model.

1070
00:46:54,900 --> 00:46:58,060
And if it wasn't, it would be hurting the consumer.

1071
00:46:58,060 --> 00:46:59,060
What do you think?

1072
00:46:59,060 --> 00:47:00,060
I think you're insane.

1073
00:47:00,060 --> 00:47:01,580
But David, I love you.

1074
00:47:01,580 --> 00:47:03,940
I mean that, and keep listening, and do buy a rope.

1075
00:47:03,940 --> 00:47:07,580
And if you've already bought a rope, send your emails to Chris because, I don't know,

1076
00:47:07,580 --> 00:47:09,720
he's sewing them by hand.

1077
00:47:09,720 --> 00:47:17,660
So we're expecting a lot from either a judge who's probably 96 years old, or the legislative

1078
00:47:17,660 --> 00:47:23,340
branch who, I don't know if you've watched the news, but one of my, is it Senator Gates,

1079
00:47:23,340 --> 00:47:24,760
Congressman Gates?

1080
00:47:24,760 --> 00:47:27,260
He's pretty busy with underage hookers.

1081
00:47:27,260 --> 00:47:28,260
Oh yeah.

1082
00:47:28,260 --> 00:47:30,260
Good old Matt Gates.

1083
00:47:30,260 --> 00:47:31,260
Good old Matt Gates.

1084
00:47:31,260 --> 00:47:33,460
So listen to Unfilter, by the way.

1085
00:47:33,460 --> 00:47:38,420
Chris can't plug it, but I can because I, frankly, I do whatever the fuck I want.

1086
00:47:38,420 --> 00:47:46,520
So no, your argument, it's very well reasoned and just like simply wrong.

1087
00:47:46,520 --> 00:47:49,820
Apple is going to do whatever they want to do until someone stops them.

1088
00:47:49,820 --> 00:47:53,580
It makes no difference what chip is in the machine.

1089
00:47:53,580 --> 00:47:54,580
That's my take.

1090
00:47:54,580 --> 00:47:56,700
Actually, that seems to be Apple's take now.

1091
00:47:56,700 --> 00:47:59,880
And this is something that Extreme Tech pointed out.

1092
00:47:59,880 --> 00:48:03,020
It's a bit of a mind bender when you stop and think about it.

1093
00:48:03,020 --> 00:48:09,020
Traditionally, every time you've bought a PC, since PCs existed, the entire pricing

1094
00:48:09,020 --> 00:48:13,100
structure was predicated around the CPU model.

1095
00:48:13,100 --> 00:48:16,920
You know, are you getting the i5 model or are you getting the i7 model?

1096
00:48:16,920 --> 00:48:21,860
But now what Apple has done is if you want to buy a MacBook Air or a MacBook Pro, Apple

1097
00:48:21,860 --> 00:48:23,760
will sell you one with an M1.

1098
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:25,980
If you want to buy a Mac Mini, you get an M1.

1099
00:48:25,980 --> 00:48:29,860
If you want the iMac or the new iPad Pro, you get an M1.

1100
00:48:29,860 --> 00:48:38,460
Apple is saying that the right CPU for a $700 computer and the right CPU for a $1,700 computer

1101
00:48:38,460 --> 00:48:39,740
is the same chip.

1102
00:48:39,740 --> 00:48:43,700
It's the right chip if you want maximum battery life and it's the right chip if you want optimal

1103
00:48:43,700 --> 00:48:45,240
CPU performance.

1104
00:48:45,240 --> 00:48:49,300
It's the same chip across the board, which is slightly different cooling differences

1105
00:48:49,300 --> 00:48:51,580
that affect performance.

1106
00:48:51,580 --> 00:48:53,820
But they're not basing the price on the CPU anymore.

1107
00:48:53,820 --> 00:48:54,820
There are other differences.

1108
00:48:54,820 --> 00:48:55,820
But yeah.

1109
00:48:55,820 --> 00:48:56,820
Yeah.

1110
00:48:56,820 --> 00:48:57,820
Well, yeah, that's what makes the price difference now.

1111
00:48:57,820 --> 00:49:01,220
But now it's the same CPU and the same RAM across the board now.

1112
00:49:01,220 --> 00:49:04,100
It's a kind of a big change in pricing.

1113
00:49:04,100 --> 00:49:05,100
It's not.

1114
00:49:05,100 --> 00:49:07,340
I'm going to fight you a little bit on the same RAM.

1115
00:49:07,340 --> 00:49:08,700
And also, I wouldn't be shocked.

1116
00:49:08,700 --> 00:49:11,220
I mean, OK, fine.

1117
00:49:11,220 --> 00:49:13,700
I'm going to be an Apple fanboy for a second.

1118
00:49:13,700 --> 00:49:17,660
The problem is the M1 is such a leap forward that Apple can get away with a bunch of nonsense

1119
00:49:17,660 --> 00:49:18,660
right now.

1120
00:49:18,660 --> 00:49:19,660
Yeah.

1121
00:49:19,660 --> 00:49:22,980
It's going to be five years and we're going to see M1's, M2's, M3's.

1122
00:49:22,980 --> 00:49:28,180
Well, I mean, give it till the next next M1 revision, like the M1X comes out.

1123
00:49:28,180 --> 00:49:31,460
It's not going to seem like such a big deal that there's an M1 on the iPad when there's

1124
00:49:31,460 --> 00:49:32,460
M1X's out there.

1125
00:49:32,460 --> 00:49:35,740
No, it's it's it's not going to be the next revision.

1126
00:49:35,740 --> 00:49:37,080
You're under your underestimate.

1127
00:49:37,080 --> 00:49:38,300
It's going to be longer than that.

1128
00:49:38,300 --> 00:49:39,300
Yeah, it's still going to look.

1129
00:49:39,300 --> 00:49:40,300
Yeah, you're right.

1130
00:49:40,300 --> 00:49:41,940
Yeah, it'll be years while it still looks really impressive.

1131
00:49:41,940 --> 00:49:44,220
Right now, Apple has leaped forward.

1132
00:49:44,220 --> 00:49:46,100
And this is a guy who's doing a bunch of Windows work.

1133
00:49:46,100 --> 00:49:50,180
So and believe me, if it wasn't if it didn't make sense for me to be working in Windows

1134
00:49:50,180 --> 00:49:53,860
with a heavy use of WSL, which we can talk, you can talk about today, but we'll talk I'll

1135
00:49:53,860 --> 00:49:55,260
talk about next week.

1136
00:49:55,260 --> 00:49:58,660
I would still be on the MacBook Air, which I'm on right now because for some reason,

1137
00:49:58,660 --> 00:50:01,700
Windows couldn't figure out where the hell my microphone was.

1138
00:50:01,700 --> 00:50:03,900
Or maybe I don't know how to use Windows, whatever.

1139
00:50:03,900 --> 00:50:10,900
But the M1 is kind of a it's a what do you say it's a sun shower event, right?

1140
00:50:10,900 --> 00:50:17,780
It's so much better than what came before that Apple is getting murder right now.

1141
00:50:17,780 --> 00:50:20,700
But in a couple of years, we're going to see differentiation.

1142
00:50:20,700 --> 00:50:22,180
It's not going to be one year.

1143
00:50:22,180 --> 00:50:24,980
It's going to be I would I think five.

1144
00:50:24,980 --> 00:50:25,980
Chris says three.

1145
00:50:25,980 --> 00:50:26,980
And you know what?

1146
00:50:26,980 --> 00:50:29,900
I think Chris didn't say three, but I think three is more fair.

1147
00:50:29,900 --> 00:50:30,900
Chris is right.

1148
00:50:30,900 --> 00:50:31,900
It's not five years.

1149
00:50:31,900 --> 00:50:32,900
It's forever.

1150
00:50:32,900 --> 00:50:33,900
Right.

1151
00:50:33,900 --> 00:50:34,900
I mean, I'm on this MacBook Air.

1152
00:50:34,900 --> 00:50:35,900
Let me tell you.

1153
00:50:35,900 --> 00:50:36,900
There is no fan.

1154
00:50:36,900 --> 00:50:37,900
I'm streaming.

1155
00:50:37,900 --> 00:50:38,900
I have three browsers open.

1156
00:50:38,900 --> 00:50:39,900
I have Slack open.

1157
00:50:39,900 --> 00:50:45,940
I actually didn't even realize I I have Visual Studio Code open with a flask app running

1158
00:50:45,940 --> 00:50:47,140
in the background.

1159
00:50:47,140 --> 00:50:50,820
And then I have three terminals running Postgres.

1160
00:50:50,820 --> 00:50:52,260
And there has been no degradation.

1161
00:50:52,260 --> 00:50:53,260
Right.

1162
00:50:53,260 --> 00:50:54,980
Like it's the M1 is just silly.

1163
00:50:54,980 --> 00:50:55,980
Yeah.

1164
00:50:55,980 --> 00:50:56,980
And they know it.

1165
00:50:56,980 --> 00:50:58,740
Apple is getting all of the recognition.

1166
00:50:58,740 --> 00:51:01,060
That's why they call it an M1 in the iPad Pro.

1167
00:51:01,060 --> 00:51:03,300
They could have called it an A14X.

1168
00:51:03,300 --> 00:51:04,940
They could have called it the A15.

1169
00:51:04,940 --> 00:51:05,940
It's just branding.

1170
00:51:05,940 --> 00:51:08,100
They're trying to tie it to the to the rifle, right?

1171
00:51:08,100 --> 00:51:09,100
M1 Grand.

1172
00:51:09,100 --> 00:51:10,100
No, I'm not.

1173
00:51:10,100 --> 00:51:11,100
I'm not joking.

1174
00:51:11,100 --> 00:51:12,100
I really think they are.

1175
00:51:12,100 --> 00:51:13,100
No, no.

1176
00:51:13,100 --> 00:51:15,540
I think they're trying to tie it to just all of the success and hype they're getting around

1177
00:51:15,540 --> 00:51:16,540
the M1.

1178
00:51:16,540 --> 00:51:19,620
They just want to ride that train so much so that they're willing now to just immediately

1179
00:51:19,620 --> 00:51:25,540
blur the product naming line just to just to capitalize on the momentum of the successful

1180
00:51:25,540 --> 00:51:26,540
branding.

1181
00:51:26,540 --> 00:51:27,820
No, I think it's just it's the same chip.

1182
00:51:27,820 --> 00:51:29,940
No, I I believe it.

1183
00:51:29,940 --> 00:51:30,940
But I believe that if.

1184
00:51:30,940 --> 00:51:35,220
Oh, but I'm saying the original name of the M1 in the MacBook Air was because I think

1185
00:51:35,220 --> 00:51:36,220
because of the.

1186
00:51:36,220 --> 00:51:37,220
I could be wrong.

1187
00:51:37,220 --> 00:51:40,420
I could be wrong about this, but the M1 Springfield, the M1 Grand doesn't seem like Apple, but

1188
00:51:40,420 --> 00:51:41,420
you might be right.

1189
00:51:41,420 --> 00:51:42,420
Yeah.

1190
00:51:42,420 --> 00:51:43,420
But Tim Cook would kill anybody for a buck.

1191
00:51:43,420 --> 00:51:44,420
I mean, come on.

1192
00:51:44,420 --> 00:51:45,420
That's true.

1193
00:51:45,420 --> 00:51:46,980
Here's the question I'd love to have answered.

1194
00:51:46,980 --> 00:51:52,740
Does the M1 in the iPad Pro have the same Intel extensions that the one in the Mac does

1195
00:51:52,740 --> 00:51:58,460
to make Rosetta possible or is it actually running a different set of instructions?

1196
00:51:58,460 --> 00:52:02,980
Is it truly the M1 SoC or is it essentially the same CPU?

1197
00:52:02,980 --> 00:52:04,140
So they're just calling it that.

1198
00:52:04,140 --> 00:52:08,020
It might not have all the Intel stuff on there because why would they for an iOS device?

1199
00:52:08,020 --> 00:52:09,980
Even if it has the extensions, they wouldn't allow it.

1200
00:52:09,980 --> 00:52:10,980
Oh, yeah.

1201
00:52:10,980 --> 00:52:11,980
Yeah, they wouldn't let you use it.

1202
00:52:11,980 --> 00:52:12,980
No, why?

1203
00:52:12,980 --> 00:52:13,980
Of course.

1204
00:52:13,980 --> 00:52:14,980
So what's the point?

1205
00:52:14,980 --> 00:52:15,980
Why put the extensions in?

1206
00:52:15,980 --> 00:52:16,980
So then it's not really, truly the M1.

1207
00:52:16,980 --> 00:52:20,420
I'm going to take your argument even further since we're doing this extra long Coderator

1208
00:52:20,420 --> 00:52:21,420
today.

1209
00:52:21,420 --> 00:52:25,140
I think the M1 in the iPad is artificially crippled by their policies.

1210
00:52:25,140 --> 00:52:26,420
Oh, well, of course.

1211
00:52:26,420 --> 00:52:27,420
Yeah.

1212
00:52:27,420 --> 00:52:28,420
Oh, for sure.

1213
00:52:28,420 --> 00:52:32,220
If I could convince all of my customers that I just sold a bunch of crap to not crap, but

1214
00:52:32,220 --> 00:52:37,940
you know, software to run MacBook Airs with the M1, I would literally not give a about

1215
00:52:37,940 --> 00:52:38,940
anything.

1216
00:52:38,940 --> 00:52:39,940
Right.

1217
00:52:39,940 --> 00:52:41,700
I would just write software in the most sloppy way possible and it would work.

1218
00:52:41,700 --> 00:52:43,500
I mean, yeah, they wouldn't know.

1219
00:52:43,500 --> 00:52:44,500
They wouldn't know.

1220
00:52:44,500 --> 00:52:45,500
They wouldn't know.

1221
00:52:45,500 --> 00:52:46,500
And here's the thing.

1222
00:52:46,500 --> 00:52:47,500
Here's the thing, too.

1223
00:52:47,500 --> 00:52:51,140
You know, your your thing with that is the policies, the policies, the policies.

1224
00:52:51,140 --> 00:52:55,460
And my thing with that is even once they fix the policies, the OS and the window management

1225
00:52:55,460 --> 00:52:57,060
are still too weak.

1226
00:52:57,060 --> 00:53:02,420
The policies, even with the the chips, those iPads have always been powerful.

1227
00:53:02,420 --> 00:53:03,420
Oh, yeah.

1228
00:53:03,420 --> 00:53:04,420
The first iPad Pro.

1229
00:53:04,420 --> 00:53:05,420
Yeah.

1230
00:53:05,420 --> 00:53:06,420
For years.

1231
00:53:06,420 --> 00:53:08,340
I mean, this has been my hobby horse for how many years?

1232
00:53:08,340 --> 00:53:14,200
The problem with the iPad is not the processing power or the graphical engine.

1233
00:53:14,200 --> 00:53:16,220
It's that Apple will just say no.

1234
00:53:16,220 --> 00:53:17,220
Absolutely.

1235
00:53:17,220 --> 00:53:19,140
I mean, we don't want to go into bitter.

1236
00:53:19,140 --> 00:53:20,140
I know.

1237
00:53:20,140 --> 00:53:25,600
Here's my here's my last thing that drives me crazy is in the latest update to Big Sur.

1238
00:53:25,600 --> 00:53:31,980
They now support dynamic mouse resizing of iOS applications that you run on M ones.

1239
00:53:31,980 --> 00:53:37,980
So these these iOS applications that you run on the M one desktop can support resizing

1240
00:53:37,980 --> 00:53:38,980
with your mouse.

1241
00:53:38,980 --> 00:53:44,260
You can have multiple iOS windows and you can resize them independently on the Mac desktop.

1242
00:53:44,260 --> 00:53:46,860
But you can't do it on a 13 inch iPad.

1243
00:53:46,860 --> 00:53:47,860
What don't you understand?

1244
00:53:47,860 --> 00:53:48,860
That's intentional.

1245
00:53:48,860 --> 00:53:49,860
I know it is.

1246
00:53:49,860 --> 00:53:51,880
And that's why it makes me so cranky.

1247
00:53:51,880 --> 00:53:52,880
Fix that.

1248
00:53:52,880 --> 00:53:54,480
Read my lips.

1249
00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:59,140
They want to have a price differential between what they consider a, quote, computer and

1250
00:53:59,140 --> 00:54:00,620
what they consider an appliance.

1251
00:54:00,620 --> 00:54:04,740
But then don't call it the M one then, because the M one, it just it makes that expectation

1252
00:54:04,740 --> 00:54:05,740
worse.

1253
00:54:05,740 --> 00:54:08,680
Oh, because, you know, the next question is, why not just let me run Mac OS on the thing

1254
00:54:08,680 --> 00:54:09,940
if it's got an M one in it?

1255
00:54:09,940 --> 00:54:10,940
Right.

1256
00:54:10,940 --> 00:54:13,220
You know, that's and they know they know that question's coming when they name it the M

1257
00:54:13,220 --> 00:54:14,380
one Mac OS needs to go.

1258
00:54:14,380 --> 00:54:18,780
In fact, I five years, there's no more Mac OS and they may call it Mac OS.

1259
00:54:18,780 --> 00:54:19,780
But who spicy?

1260
00:54:19,780 --> 00:54:23,540
Yeah, it'll be like some sort of Rosetta layer of Mac OS compatibility.

1261
00:54:23,540 --> 00:54:25,260
No, it'll be.

1262
00:54:25,260 --> 00:54:29,020
Oh, well, at least Fedora will still be around.

1263
00:54:29,020 --> 00:54:32,380
Listen, I did spend a couple of days in Fedora.

1264
00:54:32,380 --> 00:54:33,380
It was beautiful.

1265
00:54:33,380 --> 00:54:36,060
It's too bad that I can't, you know, change your background.

1266
00:54:36,060 --> 00:54:37,140
Yeah, I know.

1267
00:54:37,140 --> 00:54:38,140
I didn't say it.

1268
00:54:38,140 --> 00:54:39,140
You are.

1269
00:54:39,140 --> 00:54:45,300
OK, so I went through the hassle and it truly is a hassle to install the latest Windows

1270
00:54:45,300 --> 00:54:46,300
10 insider builds.

1271
00:54:46,300 --> 00:54:47,300
Are you an insider?

1272
00:54:47,300 --> 00:54:48,300
Oh, yeah.

1273
00:54:48,300 --> 00:54:50,020
Oh, you're spicier than me.

1274
00:54:50,020 --> 00:54:51,020
Go on, sir.

1275
00:54:51,020 --> 00:54:53,500
Well, that's so that way I can get the latest and greatest WSL.

1276
00:54:53,500 --> 00:54:54,900
And the spiciest diarrhea.

1277
00:54:54,900 --> 00:54:57,040
Yeah, Microsoft has improved some things here.

1278
00:54:57,040 --> 00:55:02,420
The fact that you can actually get a Windows insider ISO and you can download an ISO image

1279
00:55:02,420 --> 00:55:08,700
from Microsoft, that is actually an improvement from the way things have been historically.

1280
00:55:08,700 --> 00:55:10,980
So that was that, you know, every time now I know it's not new anymore.

1281
00:55:10,980 --> 00:55:12,260
I know it's been like this for years.

1282
00:55:12,260 --> 00:55:15,740
But every time I do it, because it's not very often, I still am like, wow, look at this.

1283
00:55:15,740 --> 00:55:19,580
I'm downloading an ISO from I'm downloading an ISO of Windows and it's legal.

1284
00:55:19,580 --> 00:55:21,960
It just feels great.

1285
00:55:21,960 --> 00:55:26,420
So you install it and of course, I have the X1 Carbon Gen 8.

1286
00:55:26,420 --> 00:55:31,220
And of course, the SSD control in there is too new for Windows 10 to have a built in

1287
00:55:31,220 --> 00:55:32,220
driver.

1288
00:55:32,220 --> 00:55:33,220
Of course.

1289
00:55:33,220 --> 00:55:38,800
And of course, Intel only certifies their driver for specific released builds of Windows.

1290
00:55:38,800 --> 00:55:41,400
So I had to go through this whole rigmarole to extract.

1291
00:55:41,400 --> 00:55:43,700
And of course, one more, of course.

1292
00:55:43,700 --> 00:55:48,440
Of course, the download for the Intel driver is a dot exe.

1293
00:55:48,440 --> 00:55:53,820
So the only way I can extract it is by running the extractor in wine, getting the files that

1294
00:55:53,820 --> 00:55:57,000
I need and then copy them over to a thumb drive.

1295
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:59,460
It's just like it feels like the 90s.

1296
00:55:59,460 --> 00:56:00,800
It's really rough.

1297
00:56:00,800 --> 00:56:04,940
But then you get in there and like my Intel video card was just automatically detected

1298
00:56:04,940 --> 00:56:06,540
and everything just set up just fine.

1299
00:56:06,540 --> 00:56:10,000
I didn't really have to hassle with a single frickin driver for the most part once Windows

1300
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,640
update did all of its things.

1301
00:56:12,640 --> 00:56:16,100
And yeah, I could have installed more stuff for the Lenovo from the site.

1302
00:56:16,100 --> 00:56:19,200
But I just thought, you know what, I'll just keep it basic.

1303
00:56:19,200 --> 00:56:23,720
And I started using this new command line tool that Microsoft is working on for WSL.

1304
00:56:23,720 --> 00:56:24,720
And it's just WSL.

1305
00:56:24,720 --> 00:56:26,880
And it's a simple that you can find documentation on.

1306
00:56:26,880 --> 00:56:27,880
It's really simple.

1307
00:56:27,880 --> 00:56:30,740
And you can do things like WSL dash dash install.

1308
00:56:30,740 --> 00:56:36,020
And the idea of this command is you go from a Windows 10 instance with no WSL subsystem

1309
00:56:36,020 --> 00:56:38,520
at all to just a fully set up and working.

1310
00:56:38,520 --> 00:56:39,920
But it's not totally done yet.

1311
00:56:39,920 --> 00:56:43,020
So it like gave me an error message and didn't give me a complete install.

1312
00:56:43,020 --> 00:56:46,420
So I still ended up kind of installing things the traditional way and kind of doing some

1313
00:56:46,420 --> 00:56:49,680
of that work, like going and getting my Ubuntu installed manually with this was supposed

1314
00:56:49,680 --> 00:56:50,680
to do for me automatically.

1315
00:56:50,680 --> 00:56:53,280
And so that stuff was kind of rough.

1316
00:56:53,280 --> 00:56:56,760
But the experience immediately improves now with the new Windows terminal.

1317
00:56:56,760 --> 00:56:58,520
They've really nailed it there.

1318
00:56:58,520 --> 00:57:02,640
And the fact that you can have each tab have a different WSL instance.

1319
00:57:02,640 --> 00:57:07,640
So you can have, I had SUSE and Ubuntu and Kali in a tab.

1320
00:57:07,640 --> 00:57:09,880
I'm sorry, which one did you have in a tab?

1321
00:57:09,880 --> 00:57:12,120
SUSE, it's this distribution I just love.

1322
00:57:12,120 --> 00:57:13,120
I use it everywhere.

1323
00:57:13,120 --> 00:57:14,120
I should just try it out.

1324
00:57:14,120 --> 00:57:16,840
Soundboard.

1325
00:57:16,840 --> 00:57:23,980
And the reason I was doing this is now in the insider builds of Windows 10, WSL has

1326
00:57:23,980 --> 00:57:26,960
added support for graphical Linux applications.

1327
00:57:26,960 --> 00:57:28,920
Okay, but those don't exist.

1328
00:57:28,920 --> 00:57:32,920
Well, you know, the classics, the classics that are made by the free hippies out there

1329
00:57:32,920 --> 00:57:37,280
that you get on your Linux desktops that guys like me feel at home on.

1330
00:57:37,280 --> 00:57:38,280
Oh, yes.

1331
00:57:38,280 --> 00:57:39,280
Tux racer.

1332
00:57:39,280 --> 00:57:40,280
Right.

1333
00:57:40,280 --> 00:57:41,280
G edit, of course.

1334
00:57:41,280 --> 00:57:42,280
G edit on there.

1335
00:57:42,280 --> 00:57:44,320
Geary, which I think is great.

1336
00:57:44,320 --> 00:57:46,440
Geary just had a big update, actually.

1337
00:57:46,440 --> 00:57:48,840
Geary 40 just came out with a better layout.

1338
00:57:48,840 --> 00:57:51,160
They made it better by ripping my code out, yes.

1339
00:57:51,160 --> 00:57:57,280
Short version of this is what Microsoft has done here is short and sweet.

1340
00:57:57,280 --> 00:57:58,280
It's amazing.

1341
00:57:58,280 --> 00:57:59,520
That's my take on it.

1342
00:57:59,520 --> 00:58:01,640
It's really incredible.

1343
00:58:01,640 --> 00:58:06,080
Technically what they're doing is they're taking a distribution, CBL Mariner that they've

1344
00:58:06,080 --> 00:58:09,920
created for Azure for their Kubernetes instances.

1345
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:13,760
They've taken that distribution as far as I understand it, and they have built on top

1346
00:58:13,760 --> 00:58:20,040
of that PulseAudio, a bunch of like the GTK and Qt library stuff and a Wayland server

1347
00:58:20,040 --> 00:58:23,680
as well as a free desktop, RDP.

1348
00:58:23,680 --> 00:58:27,740
So what they do is they spin up a distro in real time.

1349
00:58:27,740 --> 00:58:34,000
When you launch a graphical WSL application, they spin up this distro and then they use

1350
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:39,660
Western and Wayland to communicate directly with a local RDP instance.

1351
00:58:39,660 --> 00:58:44,400
They've sent the code upstream to free RDP to support this stuff, so they've upstreamed

1352
00:58:44,400 --> 00:58:46,360
the code work they've done.

1353
00:58:46,360 --> 00:58:51,460
And it uses RDP to essentially tunnel the application's graphics back to the Windows

1354
00:58:51,460 --> 00:58:55,920
host as it's right there on your Windows box like all the other native applications including

1355
00:58:55,920 --> 00:58:58,800
a taskbar entry, the icon, everything.

1356
00:58:58,800 --> 00:59:02,020
Even the drop shadow around the application is there.

1357
00:59:02,020 --> 00:59:08,400
And they're using Wayland, which is ironic because it'll actually likely lead to application

1358
00:59:08,400 --> 00:59:13,560
developers on the Linux desktop improving their Wayland support so that they're compatible

1359
00:59:13,560 --> 00:59:17,840
with WSLG, which I just find ironic and juicy.

1360
00:59:17,840 --> 00:59:20,360
But once you launch it, it's like it's a native application.

1361
00:59:20,360 --> 00:59:24,120
It gets access to your local Windows file system if you want it to.

1362
00:59:24,120 --> 00:59:26,360
And here's the best part, Mike.

1363
00:59:26,360 --> 00:59:33,280
They have a library that's open source that scans the.desktop file of the Linux desktop

1364
00:59:33,280 --> 00:59:40,000
apps, reads the path, the application icon, and then goes and creates all of the corresponding

1365
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:44,120
entries in the start menu for you for those Linux GUI apps.

1366
00:59:44,120 --> 00:59:48,280
So for the user experience, it's go to the start menu, go to your programs menu or whatever

1367
00:59:48,280 --> 00:59:52,960
it is now, and go to that icon and click it, and then it just does everything in the background

1368
00:59:52,960 --> 00:59:56,760
and you just get an application up on your screen, all powered by WSLG.

1369
00:59:56,760 --> 00:59:59,680
I mean, that's a great user experience, don't you think?

1370
00:59:59,680 --> 01:00:01,000
I think it is.

1371
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:04,720
And meanwhile, they have a really nice, competent terminal where I've got three or four different

1372
01:00:04,720 --> 01:00:06,720
distros running simultaneously.

1373
01:00:06,720 --> 01:00:15,160
Isn't it nice to have your Unix software and an operating system that can run 97% of the

1374
01:00:15,160 --> 01:00:16,160
software in the world?

1375
01:00:16,160 --> 01:00:20,080
Well, and you see a really sweet workflow that they're doing now where they have like

1376
01:00:20,080 --> 01:00:25,400
VS code executing and building stuff in WSL and then displaying you the results on your

1377
01:00:25,400 --> 01:00:26,400
Windows host.

1378
01:00:26,400 --> 01:00:27,640
You mean what I was doing all day?

1379
01:00:27,640 --> 01:00:29,200
Yeah, building Linux apps on Windows.

1380
01:00:29,200 --> 01:00:30,400
It's crazy.

1381
01:00:30,400 --> 01:00:33,680
It's almost like Windows is a super Linux distro.

1382
01:00:33,680 --> 01:00:36,280
Who do we say the best Linux distro?

1383
01:00:36,280 --> 01:00:39,080
Well, you know, I've been thinking about this.

1384
01:00:39,080 --> 01:00:45,200
You get several Linux environments, you get Linux native Wayland applications, and you

1385
01:00:45,200 --> 01:00:49,720
get the Adobe Suite compatibility, you get Steam and gaming compatibility, obviously,

1386
01:00:49,720 --> 01:00:51,600
like there are a lot of perks to it.

1387
01:00:51,600 --> 01:00:54,300
I do totally appreciate the value it brings.

1388
01:00:54,300 --> 01:01:00,000
This one doesn't bother me as much as the M1 does because the Apple platform, that's

1389
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:01,880
a totally different platform.

1390
01:01:01,880 --> 01:01:05,920
But this is just more Windows users using Linux.

1391
01:01:05,920 --> 01:01:06,920
No, it is.

1392
01:01:06,920 --> 01:01:10,920
Because I'll tell you, man, I was happy to be done after my weekend.

1393
01:01:10,920 --> 01:01:13,960
Windows is still Windows and it's arcane in a lot of ways.

1394
01:01:13,960 --> 01:01:15,520
And I was like, okay, see you later.

1395
01:01:15,520 --> 01:01:17,680
And I just walked away immediately.

1396
01:01:17,680 --> 01:01:18,680
I was good.

1397
01:01:18,680 --> 01:01:23,080
Will the senator from the great state of the Nile please yield his time?

1398
01:01:23,080 --> 01:01:28,160
But I really think, I mean, even if it means, you know, in the big grand scheme of things,

1399
01:01:28,160 --> 01:01:30,100
Linux's success is in the server space.

1400
01:01:30,100 --> 01:01:31,220
That's where Linux is king.

1401
01:01:31,220 --> 01:01:32,220
That's what I was going to say.

1402
01:01:32,220 --> 01:01:33,220
Okay, fair enough.

1403
01:01:33,220 --> 01:01:34,220
Yeah.

1404
01:01:34,220 --> 01:01:36,100
I was going to talk about our friend Alan, right?

1405
01:01:36,100 --> 01:01:40,500
You could be a open, and I know he's a BSD guy, but whatever.

1406
01:01:40,500 --> 01:01:43,520
You could be a Linux guy and still work on the server.

1407
01:01:43,520 --> 01:01:48,760
Actually, Jay LaCroix, he actually just wrote another edition of Mastering Ubuntu Server.

1408
01:01:48,760 --> 01:01:49,760
Great guy.

1409
01:01:49,760 --> 01:01:53,640
I met him at, oh my God, years ago at some System 76.

1410
01:01:53,640 --> 01:01:55,000
Someone will tell me because I talked about it a bunch.

1411
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:57,400
Oh yeah, like the super fan stuff or something like that.

1412
01:01:57,400 --> 01:02:00,960
Yeah, we were, they made me dress up like a hobbit and somebody else was an elf.

1413
01:02:00,960 --> 01:02:01,960
It was weird, but-

1414
01:02:01,960 --> 01:02:04,120
Yeah, they made you, yeah.

1415
01:02:04,120 --> 01:02:08,720
I totally wasn't like body checked in TSA dressed like a hobbit.

1416
01:02:08,720 --> 01:02:10,440
And I said, unhand me you bloody orc.

1417
01:02:10,440 --> 01:02:14,000
And he said, sir, are you, are you making, I said, no, no, it was a racial thing.

1418
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:15,920
I'm sorry, officer.

1419
01:02:15,920 --> 01:02:21,000
He made the point to me, and I didn't like it, but we had a private conversation where

1420
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:22,000
he was trolling me.

1421
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:24,200
So the trolling me part was fine.

1422
01:02:24,200 --> 01:02:29,240
But I'm wasting my time buying powerful computers because all I'm doing is controlling powerful

1423
01:02:29,240 --> 01:02:30,240
servers.

1424
01:02:30,240 --> 01:02:31,240
Right?

1425
01:02:31,240 --> 01:02:32,240
You just need a terminal.

1426
01:02:32,240 --> 01:02:37,440
Whether that terminal is Windows Terminal, which I mean the Windows Terminal app, not

1427
01:02:37,440 --> 01:02:38,440
the C prompt.

1428
01:02:38,440 --> 01:02:39,440
Right?

1429
01:02:39,440 --> 01:02:43,400
Mac Terminal, which is, you know, ghetto Z, well, let's say it's actually a good terminal

1430
01:02:43,400 --> 01:02:44,400
now.

1431
01:02:44,400 --> 01:02:45,400
Z shell.

1432
01:02:45,400 --> 01:02:49,760
Or, I mean, if you like broken things, something on Linux, unless you're using POP, which

1433
01:02:49,760 --> 01:02:50,760
is great.

1434
01:02:50,760 --> 01:02:51,760
Wow.

1435
01:02:51,760 --> 01:02:55,760
Although they should get rid of gnome as quickly as they can.

1436
01:02:55,760 --> 01:02:56,760
It's fine.

1437
01:02:56,760 --> 01:02:57,760
Right?

1438
01:02:57,760 --> 01:02:58,760
Like you don't, you don't need a desktop.

1439
01:02:58,760 --> 01:03:00,840
You don't need a tower unless you're Chris or you're me.

1440
01:03:00,840 --> 01:03:01,840
In the broad strokes.

1441
01:03:01,840 --> 01:03:05,040
I think you're 100% right, which is why it's funny.

1442
01:03:05,040 --> 01:03:10,760
All of the little niddly fiddly, nuancey convenience features turns out to be what makes all the

1443
01:03:10,760 --> 01:03:15,520
difference when in the broad strokes, what you need is a terminal and a web browser.

1444
01:03:15,520 --> 01:03:20,280
And that I find to be ironic and I think is why we have been chewing on tooling so much

1445
01:03:20,280 --> 01:03:25,380
again recently is because it turns out that when that's the reality, almost the little

1446
01:03:25,380 --> 01:03:28,240
details matter more than the big details in that way.

1447
01:03:28,240 --> 01:03:33,820
Because in broad strokes, you could virtualize Linux on a Mac, you could run WSL on Windows,

1448
01:03:33,820 --> 01:03:37,200
or you could just run the Linux desktop because in broad strokes, you're probably going to

1449
01:03:37,200 --> 01:03:40,960
at the end of the day, it's the stuff running on the server that's making the money.

1450
01:03:40,960 --> 01:03:43,200
But then it comes down to, well, how does it wake up?

1451
01:03:43,200 --> 01:03:45,200
How does the security system work?

1452
01:03:45,200 --> 01:03:49,560
How does it protect the end user or small things like how does it work with a printer

1453
01:03:49,560 --> 01:03:52,160
or a video camera or a mic interface?

1454
01:03:52,160 --> 01:03:54,880
It turns out it hasn't worked in 40 years.

1455
01:03:54,880 --> 01:03:58,240
That kind of stuff all of a sudden matters a lot more in that reality.

1456
01:03:58,240 --> 01:04:03,960
I for myself was like, I just don't like the way you have to manage Windows.

1457
01:04:03,960 --> 01:04:07,720
And I think it comes down to a part of just sort of the design philosophy of how Windows

1458
01:04:07,720 --> 01:04:08,720
was created.

1459
01:04:08,720 --> 01:04:11,560
I think it just doesn't really jive with the way I use computers.

1460
01:04:11,560 --> 01:04:16,720
And so when my WSL experiment was done and I'd gotten what I wanted from the experience,

1461
01:04:16,720 --> 01:04:21,840
I was like, OK, you know what, I feel good because I think it's maybe, yeah, maybe it

1462
01:04:21,840 --> 01:04:23,280
keeps more people on Windows.

1463
01:04:23,280 --> 01:04:27,160
But ultimately, I think if Windows bugs you, that's not going away.

1464
01:04:27,160 --> 01:04:31,780
What it's more likely to do is give all of those dark matter developers out there that

1465
01:04:31,780 --> 01:04:37,080
have been stuck on Windows because of corporate policy forever, they now have access to actually

1466
01:04:37,080 --> 01:04:42,280
legitimate Linux tools, not some half baked implementation that's essentially reverse

1467
01:04:42,280 --> 01:04:47,000
wine, but something that's really running the Linux kernel, gives you genuine environment

1468
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:52,240
supported by the upstream distributions, and now, very soon, unless you're on the insider

1469
01:04:52,240 --> 01:04:56,440
build, but now essentially will give you access to graphical applications.

1470
01:04:56,440 --> 01:05:00,360
So if you're listening to like your favorite Linux podcast or development podcast and we

1471
01:05:00,360 --> 01:05:04,360
happen to mention a Linux app, you don't have to be left out on that because you have access

1472
01:05:04,360 --> 01:05:10,120
to Ubuntu's repos and SUSE's repos and ARCH's repos and Debian's repos and Fedora's repos

1473
01:05:10,120 --> 01:05:11,640
all on Windows.

1474
01:05:11,640 --> 01:05:15,320
So I kind of wonder if it isn't just going to make more Linux fans long term, but I guess

1475
01:05:15,320 --> 01:05:16,720
we'll just wait and see.

1476
01:05:16,720 --> 01:05:20,620
It may steal a few Linux users too, or it may just be a wash.

1477
01:05:20,620 --> 01:05:25,560
But that M1 and that Mac platform, that's a different story because there, your best

1478
01:05:25,560 --> 01:05:31,320
option is virtualizing the ARM version of Linux, which fundamentally reduces your application

1479
01:05:31,320 --> 01:05:35,280
compatibility and tool compatibility and doesn't likely reflect what you're going to be running

1480
01:05:35,280 --> 01:05:36,720
in production in the cloud.

1481
01:05:36,720 --> 01:05:40,240
The biggest threat to desktop Linux is not the M1.

1482
01:05:40,240 --> 01:05:44,720
The M1 is the biggest threat to life on Earth as we know it, because when it becomes sentient

1483
01:05:44,720 --> 01:05:49,020
and decides that we've treated it badly by running our stupid electron apps, which were

1484
01:05:49,020 --> 01:05:50,840
needlessly wasteful.

1485
01:05:50,840 --> 01:05:54,760
That's what that ML part of the chip does.

1486
01:05:54,760 --> 01:05:59,440
Every time you launch Slack or Teams, it's just like, you son of a bitch.

1487
01:05:59,440 --> 01:06:04,120
The reality is that when the M3 comes out, it'll have like a whole bio, it'll have like

1488
01:06:04,120 --> 01:06:08,520
a biological part of it that is just part human, part machine.

1489
01:06:08,520 --> 01:06:10,860
There's no M4.

1490
01:06:10,860 --> 01:06:12,760
It ended at the M3.

1491
01:06:12,760 --> 01:06:18,120
Or at least we did and we don't know.

1492
01:06:18,120 --> 01:06:22,660
Up until recording this show, I had a fantastic day on Windows.

1493
01:06:22,660 --> 01:06:27,120
And honestly, I'm going to say it was my fault that the Windows thing broke because I denied

1494
01:06:27,120 --> 01:06:29,560
access at first to the microphone.

1495
01:06:29,560 --> 01:06:31,240
Chris is going to choke me in Slack later.

1496
01:06:31,240 --> 01:06:32,520
Well, no, you're not.

1497
01:06:32,520 --> 01:06:36,040
People do that all the time accidentally because they're always popping up asking you crap

1498
01:06:36,040 --> 01:06:37,040
constantly about cookies.

1499
01:06:37,040 --> 01:06:39,160
There is so much crap popping up.

1500
01:06:39,160 --> 01:06:40,160
Yeah, yeah.

1501
01:06:40,160 --> 01:06:41,160
No, guests do that all the time.

1502
01:06:41,160 --> 01:06:42,800
And then it's a whole rigmarole to get out of it.

1503
01:06:42,800 --> 01:06:45,720
And I restarted, but it wouldn't take it, it wouldn't pick up.

1504
01:06:45,720 --> 01:06:54,940
Other than that issue, I had a wonderful 14-hour workday because today was a busy day working

1505
01:06:54,940 --> 01:06:57,760
in Windows doing mostly Linux-y work.

1506
01:06:57,760 --> 01:07:01,760
And soon even Linux-y graphical work if you want for some reason.

1507
01:07:01,760 --> 01:07:02,760
Yes.

1508
01:07:02,760 --> 01:07:05,460
And if I ever do that, it's time to have me locked up.

1509
01:07:05,460 --> 01:07:07,760
It's called the Baker Act, time to do it.

1510
01:07:07,760 --> 01:07:08,760
All right.

1511
01:07:08,760 --> 01:07:11,280
Well, anything you want to plug before we get out of here this week?

1512
01:07:11,280 --> 01:07:16,400
Yeah, I would like to plug you should hire me for Windows development work or server-side

1513
01:07:16,400 --> 01:07:17,400
Python work.

1514
01:07:17,400 --> 01:07:18,400
Right.

1515
01:07:18,400 --> 01:07:19,880
I mean, now that he's got this Windows box, let's put it to use.

1516
01:07:19,880 --> 01:07:21,440
Oh, I'm curious to know what you think about it.

1517
01:07:21,440 --> 01:07:25,320
So do you know ish-ish how long you're going to have to wait to get it?

1518
01:07:25,320 --> 01:07:26,320
Like a rough idea?

1519
01:07:26,320 --> 01:07:28,280
I ordered it, paid for expedited shipping.

1520
01:07:28,280 --> 01:07:33,480
They're like, oh, congratulations on your order five minutes later.

1521
01:07:33,480 --> 01:07:35,400
We're experiencing unusual delays.

1522
01:07:35,400 --> 01:07:36,400
We'll let you know.

1523
01:07:36,400 --> 01:07:37,400
Yeah.

1524
01:07:37,400 --> 01:07:39,600
Everything's super delayed right now.

1525
01:07:39,600 --> 01:07:43,800
My think pad was, and that was a while ago, but everything during the pandemic has been.

1526
01:07:43,800 --> 01:07:46,760
Well, when you do get it, I'll be curious to hear your thoughts on it.

1527
01:07:46,760 --> 01:07:50,080
Also should probably mention a new Coderly is out.

1528
01:07:50,080 --> 01:07:54,680
If you are a Coder QA member, Mike and I have the Coderly report out and available for download

1529
01:07:54,680 --> 01:07:58,000
in the feed or in your members download area at CoderQA.co.

1530
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:00,920
And honestly, if you're not, do you need to buy that much food a month?

1531
01:08:00,920 --> 01:08:01,920
Right.

1532
01:08:01,920 --> 01:08:02,920
I mean, it's not even that much really.

1533
01:08:02,920 --> 01:08:04,080
And you know, it helps this show go.

1534
01:08:04,080 --> 01:08:06,080
You get the limited ad feed and that Coderly.

1535
01:08:06,080 --> 01:08:07,200
It's worth it for the Coderly.

1536
01:08:07,200 --> 01:08:10,080
The Coderly is a, you thought this was a therapy session.

1537
01:08:10,080 --> 01:08:12,040
Me and Chris just, we hold each other.

1538
01:08:12,040 --> 01:08:13,040
Yeah.

1539
01:08:13,040 --> 01:08:15,600
Wes has to actually end the show for us because we're just like.

1540
01:08:15,600 --> 01:08:18,560
Wes basically has to just take care of the whole thing, you know, and if it wasn't for

1541
01:08:18,560 --> 01:08:22,320
Drew doing the introductions, I don't know, I don't know where we'd be with that.

1542
01:08:22,320 --> 01:08:24,600
Turned out though, thanks to those guys, it turned out.

1543
01:08:24,600 --> 01:08:26,120
Wait, Drew is real?

1544
01:08:26,120 --> 01:08:30,240
That are a very sophisticated AI running on a prototype M2 chip.

1545
01:08:30,240 --> 01:08:32,120
I thought Drew was an M1.5.

1546
01:08:32,120 --> 01:08:35,720
He might be, I mean, have you heard those dulcet tones?

1547
01:08:35,720 --> 01:08:36,720
Those can't be real.

1548
01:08:36,720 --> 01:08:41,400
He scolded me for swearing not loud enough because it didn't pick up on the mic.

1549
01:08:41,400 --> 01:08:44,000
And that's exactly the thinking of a machine.

1550
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:47,720
Well, if you're going to beep, you know, you want to beep with the, with some, with some

1551
01:08:47,720 --> 01:08:48,920
humor and you get to sort of.

1552
01:08:48,920 --> 01:08:51,200
You're going to say that Intel is permanently f***ed.

1553
01:08:51,200 --> 01:08:53,280
You need to say it with passion.

1554
01:08:53,280 --> 01:08:54,280
Right.

1555
01:08:54,280 --> 01:08:57,560
And you want, you want that F in that, in that beep, you know, you want part of the,

1556
01:08:57,560 --> 01:08:58,560
you know, for the.

1557
01:08:58,560 --> 01:09:01,800
It needs to be a hard F. It needs to be like all the way.

1558
01:09:01,800 --> 01:09:06,560
You could find our sponsor, a cloud guru on social media, just slash a cloud guru, just

1559
01:09:06,560 --> 01:09:07,560
about anywhere.

1560
01:09:07,560 --> 01:09:11,000
That's like a website, you know, like YouTube or the Twitters or any of it.

1561
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:12,000
Corn hub.

1562
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:13,000
Probably not.

1563
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:14,000
You could find Mike on Twitter.

1564
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:15,000

1565
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:16,680
His company's at the Mad Botter Inc.

1566
01:09:16,680 --> 01:09:17,920
I'm at Chris LAS.

1567
01:09:17,920 --> 01:09:22,680
I think I don't really tweet much, but I do try to read my ads and reply, you know, like

1568
01:09:22,680 --> 01:09:23,680
a gentleman.

1569
01:09:23,680 --> 01:09:25,040
The network's at Jupiter signal.

1570
01:09:25,040 --> 01:09:26,040
So that's there.

1571
01:09:26,040 --> 01:09:27,280
