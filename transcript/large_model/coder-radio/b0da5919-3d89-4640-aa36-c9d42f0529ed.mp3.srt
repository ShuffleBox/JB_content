00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
This is Kota Radio, Episode 407 for March 29th, 2021.

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Hey friend, welcome in to Jupiter Broadcasting's weekly talk show,

3
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
taking a pragmatic look at the art in the business of software development

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
and the whole world of technology.

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
This episode is brought to you by a cloud guru.

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
A cloud guru now includes Cloud Playground, Azure AWS,

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
or Google on ACG's credit card, not yours.

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
My name is Chris, and joining us like the podcaster he is,

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
even when the young ones awake, it's our host, Mr. Dominic.

11
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Hello, Mike.

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
The younglings, man, the younglings.

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
It's like every night they think bedtime's new,

14
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
like they don't go to bed every night.

15
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Right, they feel like bedtime is the opposition.

16
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
And they fight it.

17
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
And I've got good news for you.

18
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:05,000
As far as I know, it never ends because I've got one that's 11 years old

19
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
and he still fights it.

20
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
You need to redefine good.

21
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Well, never fear.

22
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
To put us in a better mood, that handsome bastard, Wes Payne,

23
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
has rejoined us.

24
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Hello, Wes.

25
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Hello.

26
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Hey, Wes.

27
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Thanks for being here.

28
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Thanks for having me.

29
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
I have a little thing I wanted to share with the class before we go on.

30
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Wes and I did a little, well, we, I should not take any credit for it.

31
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
The only credit I should get is that I'm actually going to make Wes

32
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
talk about it and take some credit for it.

33
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
A little scoop and move of our J-bot that we use in the chat room

34
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
to title our episodes and get all kinds of information.

35
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
And while he was at it, he did a little modernization,

36
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,000
a little dash of new libraries and baked it all up in a new container for us

37
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:52,000
to get it off a totally failing arch box from like 2014, 2015.

38
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
So, give us a little, just a little taste of what you did, Wes.

39
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Yeah, I mean, this was kind of an unfortunate situation.

40
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
It was an ancient arch box that had not been upgraded

41
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,000
and our previous solution was basically like old style lift and shift.

42
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Like, okay, well, we'll just keep the VM running and everything in there.

43
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
We won't look inside, we won't touch it,

44
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,000
and we just hope that it keeps working with a whole bunch of restarts.

45
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
That wasn't exactly great or super tenable.

46
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
And really, I wanted to get rid of everything in there.

47
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,000
So, I spent some time on Saturday dockerifying this ancient Ruby web app.

48
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
So, that was kind of a chore

49
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
because a whole bunch of things had changed since then, of course, right?

50
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Various dependency interfaces, breaking changes to libraries.

51
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
So, I had to go hunt down, all right, well,

52
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
can I just change the code a little bit to make it work with the new version

53
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
or do I have to explore, can I pin that dependency?

54
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
And if I pin that dependency, does that break any of the dependency resolution

55
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
for any of the other gems involved here?

56
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,000
But eventually, with enough little futzing and disabling one feature

57
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
that we have to figure out a workaround for, which is the calendar integration,

58
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
it actually built the Docker container, started right up,

59
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
and now it's running on a shiny new Linode.

60
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
No more legacy except for what's in the container,

61
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
which is exactly how I want it.

62
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Yay. Yes, and it seems faster.

63
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
It does. So, that's nice, too.

64
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
It does seem faster.

65
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I mean, we'll see. I put a memory limit on the container.

66
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
We'll see if that makes it die

67
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,000
or if we get some better stats about just what's going on in there.

68
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,000
But hopefully now we at least have something that's reusable, replaceable,

69
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,000
manageable until eventually we come up with some better JBot alternative.

70
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Mike, you know what this is?

71
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
It's when Wes Payne kicks a can down the road,

72
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
he kicks it really far down the road.

73
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
He bent it like Beckham, really.

74
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I mean, I have nothing to say. It's fantastic.

75
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
It's pretty good.

76
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Wes, I think also, before we go too much further into the show,

77
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
I got to also get a closure update.

78
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Hang on. Let me get my barf back and then…

79
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Okay, go on, Wes.

80
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Just a quick one. Just a quick one.

81
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Because we got emails we got to get to, but are you still loving Clojure?

82
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Oh, very much so.

83
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I mean, come on. It's a functional Lisp.

84
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
What's not to love there?

85
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
There it is.

86
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
No, really, I like it because you can take Clojure anywhere.

87
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
There's Clojure script running in the browser.

88
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
There's a.NET version and, of course, the main version,

89
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
which is running on the JVM.

90
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
And if you like Python, if you like LISPs,

91
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
if you like functional programming,

92
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
there's something in there that you'll like in Clojure,

93
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
and it just presents a nice, simple way to program.

94
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
It's all about using data structures

95
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,000
without a whole bunch of crazy objects and custom APIs.

96
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
And when you are on a small team or you just have a job

97
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
that doesn't need a giant enterprise set of developers,

98
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Clojure really helps you keep things simple and just get your work done,

99
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
focus on the problem at hand, and keep it maintainable.

100
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Get the hell out of here.

101
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Have you heard of objects sending…

102
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Chris knew I was going to jump in on this.

103
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
He had the soundboard ready.

104
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Have you heard of objects just sending messages to each other,

105
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
including Nil, and being like, meh, whatever?

106
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Yes, I have.

107
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
You know, it's really just the objects part.

108
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
I'm okay with the message passing and actors and all that,

109
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
but there's just this, especially in the Java world,

110
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
there's this sort of classes for everything,

111
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
objects for everything worldview.

112
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Oh, you know I'm not talking about Java.

113
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
True, yes.

114
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
You're probably talking about Ruby, unless you mean Smalltalk?

115
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
No, I think you meant Swift.

116
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
It's definitely not Objective-C.

117
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
All right, well, there's no need for hate speech, Chris.

118
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Let's just move on.

119
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I'm sorry, Mike. I'm sorry.

120
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
You know, Mike, if you like Nil,

121
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
I think you'll find the Nil punning in Clojure very enjoyable.

122
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Oh, my goodness.

123
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
That's hurting me too.

124
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
This is why we don't do the challenges anymore.

125
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
This trolling has got like blowback on me right now.

126
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
You asked for it, buddy.

127
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
You're right, you're right.

128
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
And we definitely have some Ruby stuff that we need to get into.

129
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
A lot of people in the Ruby community not having a good week.

130
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
We'll explain why.

131
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
But you remember that email we got last week from Matt,

132
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
the dude from Australia who was really having a tough time of it?

133
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
I have a vague recollection, yes.

134
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Yeah, and he was thinking about like, you know, what do I do?

135
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
I'm feeling really super trapped.

136
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
You know, I have a family.

137
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
I'm making a good enough money where I can't quit,

138
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
but I'm making not so much great money that I can invest

139
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
in something really big.

140
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
And he was feeling really stuck.

141
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
And we got a couple of people that wrote in.

142
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Chuck wrote in and said, you know, this Matt guy,

143
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:13,000
he's going through something that I went through at one point, he says.

144
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:18,000
And he linked a YouTube video that I'll have in the show notes for Matt.

145
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,000
He thinks that what we touched on, a hobby is really what Matt needs.

146
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,000
He says that he calls them professional hobbies.

147
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,000
He's had two in his life, Tai Chi and doing a side programming gig

148
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
for a university.

149
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:35,000
His main job is always paid for the ability to do those side things.

150
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Matt's family is his reward for his sacrifice.

151
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,000
If he gets to complimentary tech hobby like raspberry pies

152
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
or maybe he gets into something to that degree that he could share with his kids,

153
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
he could use that as a springboard to learn totally new stuff.

154
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,000
And here's a clip from that YouTube video that Chuck passed along

155
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
that I thought was kind of great.

156
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Also know a man who said once after years of standing

157
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,000
on the platform of the subway, I die a little bit down there every day,

158
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
but I know I'm doing so for my family.

159
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:10,000
There are small acts of heroism that occur without regard to the nobility

160
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
or the notoriety.

161
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,000
And there is something to that, you know, making your family fruitful

162
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,000
and feeding them and providing for them is a reward,

163
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
but it's a mindset.

164
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
So I think I've been thinking about Matt for the last week,

165
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
and I think some of our listeners have too,

166
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
but I have an email that came in from Jimmy from New Zealand.

167
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
He says, loves the show and we can never take it away from him again.

168
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
I don't know.

169
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
I think maybe threatening harm there.

170
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
I'm not sure.

171
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
But he goes on to say, I wanted to touch on that email from Matt in Australia.

172
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,000
I studied network engineering at college and I was finishing my final paper.

173
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
I was offered a job overseas in a technical support position.

174
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
At the time, it sounded like a great idea.

175
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
I was floating around the world a few times to meet up with teams and do training.

176
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
My pay was very good for what I needed.

177
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Fast forward six years.

178
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:01,000
I'm closing in my 30s, still in the same role, and I'm burnt out, bored.

179
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
And the pay was really not so good anymore,

180
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,000
especially considering I was about to get married and had to get on the way.

181
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Something in my head just snapped, he says.

182
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
I freaked out.

183
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
My degree was becoming redundant as technology had moved on.

184
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Plus I had no real skill set.

185
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
I'd been doing tech support for niche products for a while.

186
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Oh, crap, he says, I thought.

187
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
I wasted all this time.

188
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
I'd become complacent with my work because I felt secure.

189
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,000
And now I felt stuck with no way to level up.

190
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Like Matt, I also had an interest in programming.

191
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
I'd done a few papers in college and had played around with web apps,

192
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
just kind of messing around in my spare time.

193
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
I saw an opportunity at my work.

194
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
We don't create our products.

195
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
We are a reseller who sells their products

196
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
and then offers consultancy and tech support on top.

197
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Over the years, I had heard all of the complaints from customers

198
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
about what they wished our products integrated with.

199
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
So I took it upon myself to learn JavaScript, Node, React,

200
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
as well as a bunch of other technologies.

201
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:01,000
I had, over time, created various applications that helped our clients

202
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:07,000
and I logged the process and I helped them manage their different applications.

203
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,000
I created essentially value for our clients.

204
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
I told my boss about it.

205
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:15,000
And even though the code was essentially dog crap taped to the wall,

206
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
it was at least a working solution.

207
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Fast forward a couple of years, I sparked many ideas

208
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
and now my boss has pulled me off tech support.

209
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,000
I still have a way to go, but it's a lot to learn

210
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,000
and I get paid a lot more and, of course, I'm doing things that I love

211
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
and I get to build stuff.

212
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
I'm not sure if this really helps Matt,

213
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
but maybe he could think of something that his clients would benefit from.

214
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Maybe building something in his spare time as a hobby

215
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,000
could help him go down a path into transitioning to a developer.

216
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
His current position as a consultant

217
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
gives him the ability to figure out solutions to problems.

218
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
It's a great asset as a developer.

219
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Love the show, Jimmy from New Zealand.

220
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,000
There's a lot there, but people, I think Matt touched people last week.

221
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,000
We had a coder connection on the show.

222
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
That's wonderful.

223
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Beautiful.

224
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,000
I mean, I'm literally in tears right now.

225
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
But you know what would soak up those tears better

226
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
than me just crying into my sad polo shirt?

227
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
A robe.

228
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
A robe.

229
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Yes.

230
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Hold on, let me see if I can say what I want to be able to say.

231
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
I got to double check.

232
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
I'm opening up the thing right now.

233
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
We're checking the logistics right now, people.

234
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Let's see.

235
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
And if I have a new, I don't.

236
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,000
I don't have a new email saying we've heard back.

237
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,000
I was hoping, because you know, people will hear this like Wednesday, Thursday.

238
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,000
And so I definitely will have an update by then.

239
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,000
But as we record Monday evening,

240
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
we had three more people that were international.

241
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,000
So it turns out one of the issues is like the thread that we used

242
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
is not legal in some of these countries.

243
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
It's illegal thread.

244
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
You and your fancy thread.

245
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
I mean, can you believe this?

246
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,000
So first, the first issue that hung it up was that custom required phone numbers.

247
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:57,000
And I didn't put on the order page a space that like required a phone number.

248
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
So we had to contact people and get their phone numbers.

249
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,000
But of course, a lot of people didn't come back.

250
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
So then like a handful of them ended up with my personal phone number on them

251
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
for several logistical reasons.

252
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
And then some of them had to get canceled because of customs or legal reasons.

253
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
But that's all sorted now.

254
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
It's all done.

255
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:19,000
And it takes them just like a business week to actually get the embroidery done and whatnot.

256
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
They ship from the U.S.

257
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:26,000
That I've learned was going to always cause me pain.

258
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:32,000
If I was working with somebody who maybe had shipping facilities in multiple parts of the world,

259
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
maybe I wouldn't have had some of these problems.

260
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:39,000
But the tradeoff is the type of selection of material that they have

261
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,000
and the variety and the quality.

262
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:47,000
And that is a notch above what I could get for the people that have worldwide distributions.

263
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
So these are the tradeoffs.

264
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Man, I wanted to have this like totally wrapped up by now

265
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,000
because I wanted all lessons learned and figured out for LUP 400.

266
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:00,000
So we could do something for LUP 400, which is just like two weeks away.

267
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,000
And I'm still not in a position to be able to do that.

268
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
And when you think about the kind of lead time you need for designers

269
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:09,000
and then to work with the company to get mockups and let alone

270
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:13,000
if you even want to get like a test piece to like make sure it's valid before you put it up for sale,

271
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:17,000
like two weeks is just really just probably not possible.

272
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
So something's going to have to slide.

273
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:23,000
It's just swag turns out way harder.

274
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:30,000
And I expect it is possible at this point that I will be paying into this to get it to ship internationally

275
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,000
because of the cost to ship this thing to some people.

276
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:37,000
But I just didn't know because it was apparently for whatever reason

277
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
impossible to give me an accurate quote ahead of time.

278
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
And I don't know the logistics on this.

279
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
I'd love to figure that part out.

280
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:48,000
But they needed the address of each individual place they were going to drop ship to

281
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
before they could give me a quote.

282
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,000
And they couldn't just give me like some like estimate based on experience.

283
00:12:54,000 --> 00:13:00,000
So I'll tell you what.

284
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,000
I mean, part of me would love to get this figured out and then just get a process,

285
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,000
a business process that just makes this smooth.

286
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:11,000
And maybe just there's a few companies that we have to use a different partner to ship to or something.

287
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,000
But then part of me just wants to never touch this again.

288
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Or as they say on filter, F the EU.

289
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
That's right.

290
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Oh, she has been known.

291
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:24,000
So anonymous penguin coder writes in and he's looking for our advice as two dads.

292
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:28,000
He's hoping to shed some light on a situation that he finds himself in.

293
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,000
He wants us to be the light at that end of the tunnel.

294
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
He says, I am a huge Linux fan.

295
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,000
I have a family of three kids six and under.

296
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Wow, man.

297
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Wow.

298
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:43,000
He says, over the last show, you talked about the sirens call of the Apple platform.

299
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:47,000
I've recently been hearing that call in regards of mobile devices.

300
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
I have a pine tab.

301
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:53,000
And while the future potential is there, it just isn't there today.

302
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
It barely does simple web pages correctly.

303
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,000
I know there's potential, but I want something that just works today.

304
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
And I have very little time.

305
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:04,000
I have a couple other computers that I need because my machines are getting pretty old.

306
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,000
I have nothing newer than 2003.

307
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:11,000
I do like the Android pixel ecosystem, but Android tablets just don't seem appealing.

308
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:15,000
So my questions are, what are your guys' thoughts on the iPad Pro?

309
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Should I look into buying one?

310
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Is Michael going to invest in one if they update one soon?

311
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Which there's rumors they will be.

312
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
And what are the gotchas for a Linux user or a sys admin?

313
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Thank you, anonymous penguin coder.

314
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
We both have the iPad Pro.

315
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,000
I think around the same one, too.

316
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
2018?

317
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Yeah, I think it's like an 18, yeah.

318
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Yeah, iPad Pro 2018 I think is what we both have.

319
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
I have the 11-inch.

320
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Yeah, I have the small one, yeah.

321
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Would you consider upgrading?

322
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
No.

323
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
No need to?

324
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Unless there was a development reason where I wanted to build something for it.

325
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:54,000
My iPad is a glorified iTunes or Apple TV, whatever.

326
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
I just watch movies.

327
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Oh, yeah, OK.

328
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Content machine.

329
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Yeah, it's a content machine.

330
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
I don't need anything else.

331
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Honestly, it's an extreme overkill for what I have.

332
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
I have a different feeling.

333
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,000
I also would not upgrade because I feel like mine's a five-year machine.

334
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:12,000
But I use mine quite a bit for the productivity apps that I don't think are great on Linux.

335
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Do you have a MacBook Air for that?

336
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Yeah, this is my way of avoiding the MacBook Air.

337
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Sure, yeah.

338
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Because I don't love email on Linux or calendars.

339
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
I mean, who does?

340
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
We went in the wrong direction here.

341
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:32,000
So, yes, to correct it, the gotchas, I'd say, is the only real kind of integration you're going to get with the Linux desktop is via cloud services.

342
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Some you could roll yourself if you have the time to set something up like Nextcloud or something like that.

343
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:44,000
But for the most part, it's just going to be ones that are standard cloud services that you know of and either love or hate already.

344
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,000
So depending on your point of view, that's a downside to that.

345
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:52,000
I'm kind of curious, Wes, what your thoughts are because you don't have an iPad or an iPhone.

346
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:57,000
You're not necessarily against owning one, but it doesn't seem like they've just ever crossed the threshold of interest.

347
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
And what would that take?

348
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Actually, my very first smartphone was an iPhone.

349
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
So I started out that way.

350
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Like how long?

351
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Which one was it?

352
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
I don't know.

353
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,000
This was probably 2011, 2010.

354
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
I thought 4, I think.

355
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Yeah, okay.

356
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Yeah, 4G maybe.

357
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Yeah.

358
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
So I enjoyed that.

359
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Of course, I was also doing all kinds of stuff.

360
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Had Cydia on there.

361
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
You know, it was jailbroken a lot of the time.

362
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
So those were kind of like the old playful days.

363
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
And I've administered a lot of Macs.

364
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
So I'm definitely, you know, interested.

365
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,000
I can appreciate the ecosystem.

366
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
And honestly, these days, I think about it.

367
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
I mean, you know, I see you a lot.

368
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,000
You're somewhat invested now these days.

369
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,000
And I don't really do anything with my phone that's not just a phone use.

370
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:43,000
I haven't really had root on any of my Android devices for, I don't know, a couple years now.

371
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:48,000
It's mostly that because I'm not already invested, I just see that to get a lot of the benefits,

372
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,000
it seems like I'd have to have a couple devices.

373
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
And I don't really need a tablet.

374
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Like I just, it doesn't really fit in my lifestyle right now.

375
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,000
I don't spend that much time on the couch where I'd really need a tablet.

376
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
And I just have it.

377
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
I live by myself.

378
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
I've got the desk set up that I want.

379
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
It's easy enough, you know.

380
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,000
And I don't have all the AirPlay gadgets.

381
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
I really like AirPlay.

382
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:11,000
It seems so much better than the equivalent Chromecast setup.

383
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
But Chromecast is a fairly open ecosystem.

384
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,000
I can just ask it to play a URL for me very easily.

385
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,000
So that's kind of why I'm stuck where I'm at.

386
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
That's totally fair.

387
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
I also agree that it does seem to multiply.

388
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:27,000
You know, if he was asking for his kids, I'd say don't get the iPad Pro.

389
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:32,000
That's overkill for how fast kids would burn through it, you know, if you wanted a family.

390
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
But his kids are young.

391
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:37,000
For my kids, you know, for me, if I can get a refurbished iPad, that's perfect.

392
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:43,000
If not, I try to get one that's the most reasonably priced for them if it's like out of just the wrong time buying season.

393
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:51,000
I think it's actually for me been a nice supplement because it takes the pressure off my laptop to be all things.

394
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,000
And the iPad Pro has a very consistent performance.

395
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
And then, Wes, you know this is true.

396
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:59,000
The other thing that I use the hell out of is I got an iPad with LTE connectivity.

397
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
I think Mike did, too.

398
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
And I love that.

399
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,000
It is so great to always have data.

400
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
It just doesn't matter where I go.

401
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
If I'm on Wi-Fi, I don't have to worry about Wi-Fi.

402
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
I always have a data connection if I have signal.

403
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:14,000
And that really kind of goes along hand in hand with that productivity aspect of the machine.

404
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:18,000
So I do kind of recommend it if that sounds like your use case.

405
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:23,000
The iPad Pro could be overkill, but in my opinion, performance is king.

406
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,000
I will say I got my dad an iPad.

407
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:30,000
And while he's not a child, that was about his level of experience using computers.

408
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:34,000
He's an outdoors kind of man, you know, not really interested in any of that.

409
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Yeah, for non-technical folks, the iPad is actually a great computer.

410
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Yeah, he's done a lot.

411
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:42,000
And it's inviting enough for him that I haven't really had to hold his hand the whole time.

412
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
He's been able to explore confidently.

413
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
He's not going to break stuff.

414
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:50,000
So that lets him sort of push the boundaries a little bit and actually teach himself on his own, which is great.

415
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Linode.com slash coder.

416
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Go there to get a $100 60-day credit towards your new account.

417
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
And of course, you support this here show.

418
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Linode is the largest independent cloud for developers and our cloud hosting provider.

419
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Like we were just talking, that new bot work we did.

420
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
That's on Linode.

421
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Everything we've done for JB 3.0, we host there.

422
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:18,000
They have native SSD storage, 40 gigabit network connections, really easy to use cloud manager dashboard and the best connections.

423
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
I mean, they're super fast between their data centers.

424
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:25,000
That's something else that I've learned to really appreciate as I've built out more Linodes.

425
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Something else that we learn to take advantage of in different ways that we never really considered,

426
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:36,000
but saves us time and money is Linode's S3 compatible object storage.

427
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Now, you probably know object storage is an easy way for you to store and access data without the need for running an entire server in front of it.

428
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:50,000
It's perfect for data that doesn't change that often, like images or the multimedia files that we're often working with, which are FLAC files.

429
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
It's awesome for backups.

430
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:57,000
It's great for like getting a giant archive up into the cloud that you want to make accessible or maybe just private.

431
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:01,000
You can do that obviously as well. By default, it's private.

432
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:06,000
And it just adds more storage space as you go for, as you use it, as you go forward.

433
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:11,000
So you don't have to sit there and try to allocate like I'll do 20 gigs at a time and then fill that up and then go allocate another 20 gigs.

434
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
And the pricing is great.

435
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:17,000
And one of the best cases for object storage is actually just hosting a static website.

436
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:23,000
You can get a crazy fast, highly available website on Linode's object storage with just a little HTML and CSS.

437
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
It's really cool.

438
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:37,000
So there's so many great ways to use Linode besides the way we use it, which is hosting all of our services for our backend stuff, for the tools that we use and don't really ever expose to the public and for our public facing stuff.

439
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:40,000
That's that's what I really like about the different kinds of systems.

440
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:44,000
They have rigs that are like five dollars a month and there's a lot of use cases for that.

441
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:53,000
And then they have rigs that have like dedicated AMD epic CPUs and they beat everyone else in the cloud in speed comparisons.

442
00:20:53,000 --> 00:21:02,000
And that's not just me saying that Cloud Spectator did a did a research study and found that AMD's epic dedicated CPUs are killer fast.

443
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:06,000
You know, they're just really dedicated to making sure that if you want to run something on Linux, it'll run great on Linode.

444
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:10,000
And then they just have different choices, super easy to parse for you to pick from.

445
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:15,000
And then they wrap that all up with fantastic customer service, real human beings.

446
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:22,000
You know, it doesn't matter if you've got 15 Linodes or 1000 Linodes or one, you're still going to get that same great support.

447
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:27,000
And that matters. That matters. They started in 2003 as one of the first companies in cloud computing.

448
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:33,000
And that matters, too. They've stuck around, they've refined the product and they've remained independent.

449
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:37,000
So go try it out. See what I've been talking about. Linode.com slash coder.

450
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:47,000
So there's some hoopla today that was really our excuse to bring Wes onto the show again because, you know, he works all day.

451
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:53,000
So I feel bad at the end of the day asking him to just basically stay at his desk and get on another call.

452
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:58,000
But this one kind of felt like we needed your help because Mike and I had not got a chance to read it yet.

453
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:04,000
And you had a chance to follow it since it started breaking. So the Ruby community is off the rails this week.

454
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:09,000
What's going on, Wes? Off the rails because rails was broken.

455
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:20,000
It all started last Wednesday when the maintainer of a software library called Shared MIME Info informed the maintainer of a Ruby library called MIME Magic.

456
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:27,000
And he was shipping MIME Magic under an incompatible software license. Yes, this story is all about licenses.

457
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:31,000
Is it really coming down to it's a GPL versus MIT thing?

458
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Yes. So this is a free desktop, like basically a MIME database of, you know, all these all these various MIME types.

459
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:41,000
It's maintained by the free desktop and therefore it's licensed as GPL.

460
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:47,000
This Ruby library was automatically taking that, parsing it and shipping it as code in their library.

461
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:54,000
So all you had to do was download this gem, install it. You had access to that to that library and that database functionality in a nice Ruby API.

462
00:22:54,000 --> 00:23:00,000
You go figure out what MIME types files are, et cetera. But that library was licensed as MIT.

463
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:04,000
And as you know, those two don't exactly play nicely in that way.

464
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:07,000
Yeah, there's a viral nature to the GPL, which must be the core issue here.

465
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:14,000
Right. So to their credit, the maintainer of MIME Magic promptly moved the latest version over to GPL,

466
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:21,000
but then withdrew the prior versions from distribution. And that's because really they were licensed wrongly.

467
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Right. I mean, you're pulling down what says it's an MIT project, but it's using GPL code and therefore it actually is a derived work and should be GPL.

468
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:38,000
So what do you do? Do you leave that up there as a potential liability and risk for people who download an incorrectly labeled and licensed package?

469
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:47,000
Or do you do what they did, which was pull all those wrong packages, which meant that anyone using CI systems to automatically build and deploy from those old versions.

470
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:51,000
So you actually pinned your versions. You weren't just using the latest like Rails.

471
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:58,000
Those all broke, including like 172 other packages. But of course, Rails is the one that caught everyone's attention.

472
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:03,000
Oh, I just want to say this is why I hate the GPL. OK.

473
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:07,000
I mean, I feel like we have kind of talked about this before, like this is a problem.

474
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:14,000
For years, like the GPL does not benefit individual developers or individual users.

475
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:18,000
It benefits big companies who don't give a crap because you could never hit their scale.

476
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:23,000
So they don't care if their stuff is forced to be open source because it's like the Linux kernel.

477
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:30,000
You can't touch it through a small company, BSD, MIT, Apache to everything else.

478
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,000
Right. Like it's a waste of time.

479
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:39,000
You're just going to get screwed over. The GPL was meant to be subversive and help the little guy.

480
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:43,000
It actually just helps the big corporations. It's a waste of time.

481
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:47,000
Free software sucks. Open source for life. I'm done.

482
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:54,000
This does kind of seem like, though, it's it is a case in point of what you kind of have been worrying about forever.

483
00:24:54,000 --> 00:25:00,000
Well, no, because who got screwed by this? Small companies and small software consultancies like me.

484
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:04,000
It's a knock on effect. It wasn't the big guys. Microsoft doesn't give a shit.

485
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:13,000
Like they're fine. Yeah. Like the GPL is poison unless you're Microsoft Red Hat, which is IBM or someone that size.

486
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:20,000
I'm sorry, but it needs to go. So are you saying that they're fine just because they have lawyers to deal with it or for other reasons?

487
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:25,000
I think they're fine because they have the money. They don't care that spending the resources contributing back hurts them.

488
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:28,000
Right. And they have lawyers. Not that they would violate it.

489
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:35,000
But when you only have, let's say, 20 or 30 developers, the GPL is a big drain on you.

490
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:42,000
It's just too much. I think some would argue that that's making you pay back for the resources you're benefiting from.

491
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:48,000
OK, but like Mac, BSD, right? Like, I don't know. I don't think the proof is there.

492
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,000
But that's an argument we can have another day.

493
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:58,000
I think where I fall down on is it seems like GPL is appropriate for things like the kernel or the desktop environment.

494
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:05,000
But when it comes to something that ends up a gem, that's a big deal. That's a bigger decision.

495
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
That's where I start to agree with you.

496
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:15,000
Well, when it's a library, right? The kernel is a bad example, fair enough. When it's a library and it becomes poison to your entire application,

497
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:21,000
that seems just like fundamentally benefits big players and hurts small players to me.

498
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:26,000
Because how many Rails shops were crapping their pants in the last week because they couldn't do their CI builds?

499
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:30,000
Yeah. The other story here, though, I think, I mean, the license, you're right, that is part of it.

500
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:36,000
Although you could argue, I mean, that's up to the people, right? The free desktop.org, if they want to maintain it, they want help maintaining it.

501
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:41,000
They're like, hey, we make this whole database of file types. We want people to update that when they add files.

502
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,000
We want to make sure it's accurate.

503
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:51,000
But the other side of the story is basically, one, the nature of how we all rely on online, up-to-date, live binary artifacts, you know,

504
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:56,000
like these gems or other things else out there. We rely on those always working forever, immutably.

505
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:03,000
And this library was basically unmaintained, and it was even archived for a little bit after this update because the maintainer was like,

506
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:07,000
well, look, this is just a library that pulls from stuff someone else maintains.

507
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:10,000
I'm not really touching this or worried about it anymore.

508
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:14,000
So it's another example of, like, we always have a thousand million dependencies deep.

509
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:18,000
Not everyone's paying attention to a lot of them. Will Rails shift eventually?

510
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,000
Yeah, maybe. And there has been some updates to the story, which we can get to.

511
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:26,000
But there's a lot of modern software development microcosms to be found here.

512
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
No, that's a razor-sharp point there, Wes.

513
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:36,000
And in fact, internally, we've been having this conversation at TMB about some of the Python and Ruby applications we've developed.

514
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:40,000
And Ruby is just a proxy for Rails for us, and Python is usually Flask.

515
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:48,000
The number of dependencies that they rely on over time, particularly on the Rails ones because we've been doing Rails a lot longer,

516
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:53,000
has become problematic, let's say, where the dependencies may shift.

517
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:58,000
The Ruby 3.0 shift was problematic for API compatibility reasons.

518
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:03,000
But this kind of thing, like, I somehow ducked this by the grace of God.

519
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:06,000
But, I mean, I would have sent some mean tweets, right?

520
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,000
Like, if this had happened to me, you know me.

521
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:14,000
I do worry, and I know you're going to jump down my throat, Wes,

522
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:22,000
that maybe we're just relying on other people's software too much, too many gems, too many PIP packages, too many jars, too many NuGet packages.

523
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,000
Is that sane?

524
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:31,000
I think we see often that there are risks to that, and it makes sense to try to minimize the dependencies you have.

525
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,000
That's not always easy, right?

526
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:38,000
Like, especially for a giant framework like Rails, there's a whole bunch of dependencies, optional dependencies, that gets complicated.

527
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:44,000
But it makes sense to me to at least try to limit things, look at your dependencies, go visit their GitHub, go look at the community.

528
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,000
Are they getting updates?

529
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,000
Now, that doesn't always matter.

530
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:51,000
Sometimes things are done, or they, you know, don't need updates all the time because it's a standalone package.

531
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:58,000
But by and large, for things on the internet these days, they at least got to keep up with very small changes, tweaks, updates to interfaces, etc.

532
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
So go assess what those are.

533
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,000
Go see how deep their dependency chains are.

534
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,000
All of this is extra work.

535
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:08,000
But if you want to prevent this from happening to you, it's at least worth thinking about.

536
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,000
Well, right.

537
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:18,000
And if you want a really stable platform to develop on where the dependencies haven't shifted in about a decade, I can definitely recommend Objective-C.

538
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,000
Oh, my God.

539
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,000
Sorry, Wes.

540
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:29,000
Now, not all of the projects are going to be affected immediately because it's really only going to be a problem when they try to build an update and, you know, fetch the latest version.

541
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:32,000
So it's kind of like a time bomb for some of these projects.

542
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:35,000
So do they have a solution?

543
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,000
I mean, are they going to fork it?

544
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
Like, what happens next?

545
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,000
Yeah. Okay.

546
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:46,000
So basically the idea was there's now a new version, a new new version, which was restored to the MIT license.

547
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
And you just have to provide your own database.

548
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:54,000
So that was basically the idea they came up with was instead of actually shipping the database mungedified into Ruby code,

549
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:58,000
you just have to load it at module time when you're running your program.

550
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
That way it's not like linked together GPL wise.

551
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:05,000
You just aren't going to pull in this file from the disk and leverage that in your own application, not in this library that's distributed.

552
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:08,000
No, it wasn't the library itself that was the problem.

553
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:13,000
It was the database of the different whatever data types or whatever it was.

554
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,000
MIME type data mappings.

555
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,000
The MIME types.

556
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,000
Yeah.

557
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,000
Right. Yeah.

558
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:24,000
So it was that they had taken the MIME type database and then basically used at build time,

559
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:29,000
loaded that in and then converted that into just like static Ruby code that got shipped in the module.

560
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
But they didn't do that with the appropriate license.

561
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:36,000
So now at runtime, when you load your thing, it's actually going to go load it from disk, pull that all in.

562
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:40,000
So now it's your application doing it and not the library so they can keep the license MIT.

563
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:45,000
Basically, they'll have the barn doors fixed as the cows are coming home.

564
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:48,000
It's an open question now of, is this really the way we want to be doing that?

565
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
And is this all kind of a hack?

566
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,000
Should we have a better library?

567
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,000
What's Rails going to do?

568
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:56,000
Do we need something that has more active maintainership?

569
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
That part is still an open question, I think.

570
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,000
That doesn't sound good.

571
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:02,000
I feel like this needs to be built into Rails, but maybe that's a different conversation.

572
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
Yeah, it doesn't seem ideal, huh?

573
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
What a crazy series of events.

574
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:09,000
The Register did, I think, one of the best write ups I've seen on this.

575
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
We'll have that linked in the show notes.

576
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
Thanks for helping us break that down, Wes.

577
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,000
You're the best, Wes.

578
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:19,000
I just hope I get to avoid Bundler, Gems, and all of it until the next time J-Pop breaks.

579
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:23,000
Datadog.com slash Coder Radio.

580
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:28,000
Go to datadog.com slash Coder Radio and sign up for a 14-day free trial.

581
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,000
And you know what?

582
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:33,000
If you do that, you'll also, after you create a dashboard, can get a Datadog t-shirt.

583
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
That's right, you get merch.

584
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:41,000
But Datadog is a series of tools to help you analyze code-level performance across your environment

585
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
and troubleshoot issues faster.

586
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:46,000
Datadog is a tool to do that and communicate.

587
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:50,000
And they have something called the Continuous Profiler that automatically collects information.

588
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:56,000
It profiles your production servers all the time, so you can analyze your data quickly

589
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:59,000
from any particular point in time with minimal overhead.

590
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:04,000
You get a unified picture of your environment, correlating code performance with metrics

591
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:09,000
from your servers and your applications, and you can monitor real-time information

592
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:12,000
and put it up on these beautiful dashboards.

593
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,000
It's gorgeous.

594
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:17,000
These are the kind of dashboards you'd want to just have screens around your office

595
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,000
with these dashboards up.

596
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:22,000
Go to datadog.com slash Coder Radio to see what I'm talking about.

597
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:25,000
They tightly integrate with a bunch of different applications.

598
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
They have this tracing and they have the log management.

599
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:32,000
Of course, that Continuous Profiler, it all comes together in Datadog.

600
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:37,000
One platform enables you to pinpoint the root cause of issues faster than ever.

601
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
Save time with Datadog.

602
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
Datadog.com slash Coder Radio.

603
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:46,000
Go there and get a 14-day trial, and when you create one dashboard,

604
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
you'll get a free Datadog t-shirt.

605
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,000
That's pretty great.

606
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:52,000
Datadog.com slash Coder Radio.

607
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:55,000
So did you see this?

608
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
Did you see this?

609
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:03,000
The Dino Company from the original developers of Node.js.

610
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:07,000
It is an attempt to breathe new life into the ecosystem.

611
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:12,000
They say to provide a modern, productive programming system that adheres to browser APIs.

612
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:17,000
Dino is not a monolithic system, but rather a set of technologies we believe

613
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:21,000
can be repurposed into a variety of needs.

614
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:24,000
Dino is here.

615
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,000
They've announced it.

616
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,000
They have a company now behind it.

617
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:33,000
I think it's Ryan Dahl and Bert Felder, who are the two co-creators of Node.js.

618
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:39,000
And they also have $4.9 million of seed capital to get this thing off the ground.

619
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
I have to respect them on two fronts.

620
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:45,000
One, they got paid, so dollar-dollar bill, y'all.

621
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:50,000
But also, they were wrong to put JavaScript on the server the first time.

622
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:54,000
But instead of backing down, they said, to hell with this.

623
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,000
We're doing it again.

624
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
F you guys.

625
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:00,000
Now TypeScript is first-class citizen, but it's really JavaScript.

626
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:06,000
They said, do you want your server-side software to move as fast and crazy as your browser-side does?

627
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,000
We're going to do it.

628
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
Do you like instability, sir?

629
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:12,000
Well, we've got something for you.

630
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:16,000
I mean, that really is their complaint, is that Node.js got stagnant

631
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:19,000
and hasn't really innovated much and isn't moving fast enough.

632
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:23,000
Stagnant had to stabilize because a bunch of consultants like me,

633
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:29,000
but not me because I don't sell Node because I was not smoking that crack pipe,

634
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
sold it to enterprises.

635
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,000
Again, not me.

636
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:38,000
I was selling them Rails, which, okay, not the best week for Rails.

637
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:41,000
I've changed my opinion on lots of things over the years, Chris.

638
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000
On this, I have been consistent.

639
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:47,000
JavaScript does not belong on the server, period.

640
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:50,000
They also have this deploy system.

641
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:53,000
They say it's a globally distributed JavaScript VM,

642
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
so you don't have to run it on your server.

643
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,000
You could run it on their server.

644
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,000
I see.

645
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:01,000
Taking dog shit and putting it on my neighbor's lawn is better.

646
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,000
Got it.

647
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,000
Obviously.

648
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,000
Then it's not on your lawn, man.

649
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,000
Everybody knows that.

650
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,000
I mean, no disrespect to Mr. Dahl and Mr. Belder.

651
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
I mean, it's great engineering,

652
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:12,000
but there is absolutely no reason for this to exist.

653
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:15,000
There are many better server-side languages,

654
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:19,000
and the idea that you need to unify your language between server and client,

655
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:22,000
well, then nobody can make fun of me if I do a cappuccino

656
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
to do Objective-C on the server,

657
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:27,000
which you guys have mercilessly done for a decade.

658
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:32,000
So this is a bad idea, just like Node is a bad idea.

659
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
Why don't you all learn Python?

660
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:38,000
Nicely done.

661
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
Now, I don't disagree, but I'm curious.

662
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
Wes is coming in for the fight.

663
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:45,000
Modern Python with async and UV loop,

664
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:48,000
I mean, is it that much different than, say, TypeScript,

665
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
which has been improved a lot?

666
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,000
No.

667
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
Python is, in fact, getting progressively worse.

668
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,000
I agree with you.

669
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:59,000
I sort of think that better server-side languages are C Sharp and Java.

670
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,000
It just seems like that argument is pushing a lot of work

671
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,000
on what might be a small development team

672
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,000
that, say, you were talking about earlier.

673
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,000
They don't have a lot of time.

674
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
They don't really have expertise in multiple languages.

675
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:11,000
They have to ship some front-end products anyway.

676
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
I would push back hard on that, because front-end developers,

677
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:16,000
the real talent is not like JavaScript coding.

678
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:19,000
It's going to be CSS design, HTML,

679
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:22,000
knowing how to integrate templates quickly, stuff like that.

680
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
It's not going to be, you know,

681
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
they're not going to know about threading on V8,

682
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:29,000
because if they're front-end developers, they don't care, right,

683
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,000
for the most part.

684
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:35,000
I would almost challenge, I guess, that if you had a full JavaScript team,

685
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
you would still have some developers

686
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
who are better on the back-end on the server-side

687
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:42,000
and some who actually know how to do CSS.

688
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
And my CSS is weak, right?

689
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:49,000
I am probably, in my company, the worst guy for CSS around.

690
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:52,000
I think you could do it probably with a non-Java language,

691
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
but to go from JavaScript to Java,

692
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
there's just such an impedance mismatch

693
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:00,000
when you could just otherwise ship JSON objects really easily,

694
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:03,000
and there's a whole bunch of libraries that will set things up for you

695
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
so you can just send data structures back and forth.

696
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
You don't have to deal with all kinds of serialization

697
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:10,000
going down the Java route or figuring out how to make serialization work

698
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
on these weird custom classes that you're defining.

699
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,000
None of that.

700
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:17,000
Okay, so pick another non-statically typed language then, right?

701
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,000
But then you have to pick.

702
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,000
Wow, life is about hard choices.

703
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
I'm not saying I endorse it.

704
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,000
I'm just saying if you have to learn JavaScript anyway,

705
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,000
much like why Electron apps exist, right?

706
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,000
It's the same sort of reasoning.

707
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,000
It's just easier.

708
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,000
And then Denno adds more stuff like TypeScript as default.

709
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,000
You get better APIs that are modernized.

710
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,000
You get sandboxing with permission.

711
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:40,000
You get a better self-contained binary deployment strategy.

712
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
I just don't know, Wes. I just don't know.

713
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,000
I don't know.

714
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
I just don't know if JavaScript belongs on the server.

715
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000
I mean, maybe this is my old madness,

716
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
and I'm just being like, no, don't put your peanut butter

717
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
in my jelly or my chocolate.

718
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:55,000
But I just – it's such a bad language.

719
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,000
I'm sorry.

720
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
Now that I can't disagree with.

721
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
And you and I don't agree on languages at all.

722
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
But I think that's where TypeScript as a first-class citizen

723
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
is maybe some of their argument.

724
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:08,000
Okay, but TypeScript – I mean, we should do a whole show on, like,

725
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
is TypeScript different from JavaScript?

726
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:14,000
Because isn't it – okay, I'm very conflicted on TypeScript.

727
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:18,000
Is it the next simplified evolution of C-sharp slash Java,

728
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:21,000
or is it JavaScript where it hides the pain from you?

729
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,000
And I don't know the answer to that.

730
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,000
That's a real question.

731
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,000
Yeah, and I think part of that is, like,

732
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,000
when you get to ship more modern JavaScript,

733
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,000
at least some of the pains are better.

734
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:32,000
It's still a gross, ugly language that's had a crazy evolution,

735
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
but at least it's not –

736
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
It was never meant to be a full language.

737
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
It's been bolted on like Frankenstein.

738
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:41,000
It's like the crappiest version of Voltron.

739
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,000
Oh, man.

740
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,000
Why would you want that running in your database?

741
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,000
I don't know. Maybe I'm just being a jerk.

742
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,000
Yeah, that's why I love you.

743
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
I've hated Node from the beginning.

744
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,000
I hate Dino, too.

745
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,000
Yeah, you have been consistent.

746
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
I've been very consistent.

747
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:59,000
And now the creators of Node.js apparently hate it as well,

748
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,000
which I think is what you really love about this story.

749
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:05,000
What I love is they got paid doing something I still think is insane,

750
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,000
and I'm still broke.

751
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
So, hey, whatever. Maybe I'm wrong.

752
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:14,000
Boy, we have just, I guess, nothing but to wait and see where Dino goes, I suppose.

753
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
I don't have much more to say about it.

754
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,000
It's brand new to me.

755
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,000
They will come on the show one day.

756
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,000
I'm sure they will enjoy this commentary.

757
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,000
Coder.show slash contact.

758
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,000
You know, it's the typescript.

759
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
That's what's going to get people fired up.

760
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:30,000
All right. Well, let's do our last topic of the day then.

761
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:34,000
This one is the one that has spooked me all week.

762
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
I really stepped in it last week

763
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
when I opened my mouth about how I was worried

764
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:42,000
that Apple's new platform goodies would draw Linux users in

765
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:46,000
because then I started getting notes from people all week long

766
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,000
that confirmed my fears.

767
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:50,000
So let's start with Grav because he says, don't worry about it.

768
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
Mac OS is crap.

769
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
He says, I know you guys are still freaking out about the M1,

770
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:58,000
but the general public doesn't care how many cores are in a system.

771
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:04,000
Look at Intel laptops that still sell despite AMD's amazing 4700U or 4800U.

772
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:07,000
You guys remind me back when the console fanboys would freak out

773
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:10,000
when the opposing team suddenly got better and faster hardware.

774
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:14,000
Just like the console space, it's games that sell the platform.

775
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:17,000
Big Sur is a pain in the butt.

776
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,000
It has huge compatibility issues

777
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,000
and Apple's dominance in the computing space

778
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:24,000
has really only existed in a niche.

779
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:27,000
Mac OS simply isn't designed for productivity.

780
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:30,000
Mac OS is designed for ease of...

781
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,000
Okay. All right.

782
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:35,000
Let's back away. I think he means like the Microsoft kind of productivity,

783
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,000
like Excel, Word, perhaps.

784
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,000
That's what I think, you know.

785
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:43,000
Ask the legions of developers at every conference ever who have Macbooks.

786
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,000
Sure.

787
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:47,000
Yeah. But he thinks like, you know, it lacks decent Windows snap features

788
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,000
that like Windows has had since 7.

789
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:52,000
There's just basic like navigation stuff you can't do.

790
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:56,000
Like when you click closing a window, it's still running and that confuses users.

791
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
He says that he talked to his buddy at Best Buy

792
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:03,000
and that people return even the M1 Macs because they hate Mac OS.

793
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:06,000
I mean, 20 hours of battery life.

794
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,000
You know, he thinks that's it.

795
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:12,000
But unfortunately, Grav was very much, very much in the minority.

796
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:15,000
We had many more people that wrote in that said, yeah.

797
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:16,000
So Jeff was one of them.

798
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
He says, I was listening to episode 406

799
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:23,000
and Chris's worry about the M1 Macs illustrates the battle in my soul right now.

800
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:27,000
He says that I've pretty much written everything off except for ThinkPads,

801
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:30,000
but the more I look at it, I really can't justify a ThinkPad

802
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:33,000
to the MacBook Air's performance and battery life.

803
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,000
And then you add in lack of fan noise

804
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:39,000
and I just really can't justify the cost of an Intel laptop.

805
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:42,000
I'm pretty uncomfortable with this because I've been running Linux,

806
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:47,000
usually Fedora or OpenSUSE, exclusively for over a decade.

807
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:50,000
But comparing an Intel machine, an M1, as an investment,

808
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:53,000
well, it's just obvious which machine is a better buy.

809
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:56,000
It's true that you give up a lot of control with Apple,

810
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:59,000
but compromises I'd be making over just getting a Mac

811
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,000
are starting to stack up now.

812
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,000
I'd never have considered an Intel Mac,

813
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,000
but looking at the M1 MacBook Air,

814
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:08,000
which laptop decision is a lot harder than it's ever been?

815
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:12,000
I don't think Chris's fears are unfounded at all.

816
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
Okay, all right.

817
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:17,000
I mean, you could just buy Magnet for $5

818
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,000
and you have Windows snapping on Mac.

819
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,000
Yeah, Magnet is pretty nice.

820
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:25,000
Last one, listener Mike writes in, get this.

821
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:29,000
He's a card-carrying member of the FSF.

822
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,000
He says, I just listened to the latest Koda radio,

823
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,000
longtime Linux user.

824
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:38,000
I switched to 100% desktop Linux in 1997.

825
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:42,000
Wow.

826
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
I'm going to get some butterscotch for this, hang on.

827
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:47,000
Could you imagine full-time desktop Linux since 1997?

828
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,000
I mean, I've been pretty close to full-time,

829
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,000
but I mean, there's occasional Mac-age in there.

830
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:52,000
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

831
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,000
That's just wild.

832
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,000
Around the time Mac OS 10.3 came out,

833
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:58,000
I was one of those people who switched away from Linux to the Mac.

834
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
I still use Linux on the server, but until 2015,

835
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
I used Mac OS on the desktop.

836
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:03,000
Oh, okay.

837
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:06,000
In 2015, I switched back to Linux for the desktop for reasons,

838
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
and I've been mostly happy since then.

839
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:11,000
We recently upgraded out of a family computer to an M1 Mac Mini,

840
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,000
and it's so fast.

841
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:16,000
Not only is it so fast, but it integrates with all the things,

842
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:19,000
text messages, iMessage, HomeKit, Apple TV.

843
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:22,000
It's a level of integration that I never really considered

844
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:25,000
and didn't realize I was missing on Linux.

845
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:29,000
As an associate member of the FSF since 2004,

846
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,000
software freedom is important to me,

847
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:35,000
but I'm also in my 40s now with a busy family.

848
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:38,000
I have less time to tinker, and I just need to get stuff done.

849
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
I'm due for a machine upgrade this year,

850
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:43,000
and I work with containers and virtualization.

851
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:47,000
If Apple releases a MacBook Pro with 32 gigs of RAM this year,

852
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,000
I'm going to pull the trigger.

853
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,000
I'm going to go back to Mac for a daily driver.

854
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,000
Software freedom is important,

855
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:58,000
but so is running my workload 25% to 30% faster on an $800 Mac Mini.

856
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:59,000
There you go.

857
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,000
And the battery life is nuts on the MacBook Air.

858
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,000
That's just going to win out.

859
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,000
So could I be a dick for a second?

860
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:08,000
Why is it bad that Apple has a better architecture?

861
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:11,000
Why isn't this an opportunity for the Linux vendors to step up?

862
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,000
Well, and that is being done.

863
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:16,000
Somebody has to write all of the drivers,

864
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:19,000
all of the support for the GPU, the sound system, the network, everything.

865
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,000
And Wes only has so much time.

866
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:24,000
So building an amazing CPU architecture is hard.

867
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:25,000
Tell me more.

868
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:29,000
Oh, I mean, if Apple were to release drivers or some documentation even,

869
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,000
it would make it a lot easier.

870
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:32,000
But they hate you.

871
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:35,000
That's the other problem is it's a vendor-hostile system, right?

872
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,000
I mean, you don't really want to.

873
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,000
Or they at least don't care about you.

874
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:40,000
No, no, they hate you.

875
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:41,000
I'm going to go with that.

876
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,000
Well, the reason why this still haunts me,

877
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:46,000
I was actually just talking to somebody about this earlier today,

878
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,000
it's because I watched it happen last time.

879
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,000
I watched when the Intel Macs came out and stuff.

880
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:54,000
And it killed me to see all of my brothers and sisters switching away

881
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:57,000
from Linux on the desktop to Mac.

882
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:01,000
And I never forgot that.

883
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:04,000
Because they were all glowing apples.

884
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,000
We just went to halls of glowing apples.

885
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:07,000
And I've never forgotten that.

886
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:11,000
And I look at this chip shortage that we have

887
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:14,000
and how it's affecting all these different manufacturers.

888
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,000
It's affecting GPU supply.

889
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:17,000
It's affecting motherboard supply.

890
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,000
All the components.

891
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:23,000
Well, Apple, of course, buys their components years in advance.

892
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:26,000
So they're going to be probably one of the best here.

893
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:32,000
They have prices and stocks that's pre-contracted

894
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,000
and locked in years in advance in time.

895
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:38,000
And so if the chip manufacturer or whoever,

896
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:41,000
if the foundry can't deliver,

897
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:44,000
Apple's in a pretty good negotiation position there.

898
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,000
They can get higher prices at the foundry.

899
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,000
Apple can probably get something they want out of it.

900
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:51,000
And they can easily either just eat that cost

901
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,000
or happily pass it along to the customers

902
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,000
and the customers are going to pay for it.

903
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:58,000
And when you look at the people in the market

904
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,000
who are upgrading for performance right now,

905
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,000
and we hear from them,

906
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,000
the Mac platform may be one of the only platforms

907
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:07,000
that's selling in any bulk quantity right now

908
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:10,000
because of Apple's position in the market and the chip shortage.

909
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,000
And when the chip shortage is over,

910
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,000
Apple will probably have weathered it the best

911
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:17,000
and probably have secured contracts for components.

912
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:20,000
They'll probably be at the front of the line for this stuff.

913
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:23,000
And that's going to mean that they're going to be able to ship

914
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,000
and sell the most systems.

915
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:27,000
There are vendors right now that are reporting

916
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,000
that their sales are being artificially limited

917
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,000
just because they don't have the supply.

918
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,000
They cannot ship enough product,

919
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,000
and so they can't sell anymore.

920
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,000
That is a perfect storm.

921
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,000
You have the M1 platform.

922
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,000
I was just talking with a well-known developer

923
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,000
who will be on Linux Unplugged tomorrow.

924
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:47,000
He's from the GTK Python era of the Linux desktop,

925
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,000
and he says that he kind of, this was 10 years ago

926
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,000
when he created the Lutris application,

927
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:55,000
and everybody was doing GTK Python, GTK Python, GTK Python

928
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:58,000
all over the Linux desktop all day long every week, GTK Python.

929
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,000
And now it's just pretty much gone.

930
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:04,000
There's hardly no new projects at all that are using GTK Python,

931
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:07,000
and there's no clear development path forward for him.

932
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:10,000
He doesn't have a clear strategy.

933
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,000
Should he move on? Should he stay with it?

934
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,000
Should he switch over?

935
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,000
I mean, he's considering everything.

936
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,000
He's even considering Vala and GTK and elementary,

937
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:21,000
like whatever he can do to just keep it relevant.

938
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:24,000
But the platform just sort of piddled out,

939
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:27,000
and there's not a good solution for him.

940
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:29,000
And you look at developers like him.

941
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:32,000
He's a special case because he's creating something specifically for Linux.

942
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:35,000
But developers like him, and in that similar position,

943
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:37,000
they're just burning out.

944
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,000
He's, and I can't say their names,

945
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:41,000
but he's been talking to developers

946
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:44,000
that are like productivity applications for Linux.

947
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,000
They're feeling the same way.

948
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,000
They're feeling like they're done.

949
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,000
And what they're all kind of universally saying is

950
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:53,000
there just needs to be a shift in Linux,

951
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:57,000
like a new way for open source developers to monetize

952
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:02,000
that doesn't burden them with tons of pull requests or support issues

953
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:06,000
that scales and properly monetizes.

954
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:09,000
And then they need a platform that they can target

955
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,000
and isn't shifting under them constantly.

956
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:14,000
So that way they can actually ship an application for 10 years

957
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:17,000
and whittle away at it and refine it with a limited staff.

958
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,000
And that's just not there right now.

959
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,000
And there's a lot of frustration.

960
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:24,000
There's something bubbling that people are not talking about

961
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:27,000
because the only things people talk about in Linux media

962
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:32,000
on YouTube and Reddit and podcasts and blogs is mostly positive shit.

963
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:35,000
They only talk about the good stuff because nobody wants a downer.

964
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:38,000
But the reality is there is a storm brewing,

965
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,000
and I'm going to touch on it a little bit in Linux Unplugged,

966
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:43,000
and I think that storm combined with the chip shortage,

967
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:44,000
combined with people looking for performance,

968
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:47,000
combined with the compelling aspects of the M1 by itself

969
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:50,000
is creating a perfect storm that will create a vacuum on Linux

970
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:53,000
and suck people over to the Apple platform.

971
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:55,000
It's not me trying to justify buying some M1 Mac.

972
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:58,000
It's not me just making nothing out of something

973
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,000
because I've watched it happen once before

974
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,000
and I'm seeing the components arrive

975
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:06,000
and they're aligning to create a Linux desktop exodus.

976
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,000
And it would be a damn shame

977
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:11,000
because things are getting so great over there right now.

978
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:14,000
Anyways, you know, all week.

979
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:18,000
But are they getting great because of these application developers?

980
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:22,000
Not that I don't appreciate them, but to me like Lutris in particular

981
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:25,000
and a lot of these kind of weird native apps for Linux,

982
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:26,000
like they've never been well supported.

983
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,000
They've never been very robust.

984
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:31,000
They kind of only made sense before we had networked services

985
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:32,000
and they were like good enough.

986
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,000
Oh yeah, I've got my little to-do app.

987
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,000
I don't know, most of the main things I use,

988
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,000
I end up having to collaborate with other people anyway.

989
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,000
And I guess that's a sad statement about those apps,

990
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:43,000
but I've already gotten there as a Linux user.

991
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:45,000
I'm just going to go use Steam.

992
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:48,000
I'm just going to go use OWA in a browser.

993
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:53,000
Yeah, I felt like we were approaching the next precipice of wave of users

994
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:56,000
because when you look at Fedora 34 right now,

995
00:49:56,000 --> 00:50:00,000
it's really getting there with GNOME 40, with Wayland, with PipeWire.

996
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,000
They actually have a decent audio video system

997
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:05,000
that's compelling and competitive with Mac OS.

998
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:08,000
The kernel has gotten really good in these later iterations,

999
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:09,000
the shipping with a modern kernel.

1000
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:15,000
It's got ButterFS, so it has a file system that is competitive with NTFS and APFS,

1001
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:19,000
and it has transparent compression now, which reduces excessive write SSD,

1002
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:21,000
so it's going to prolong disk.

1003
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:22,000
And it's like a really solid OS

1004
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:26,000
and truly represents what desktop Linux workstation can be,

1005
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:29,000
and it just needs more application developers.

1006
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:33,000
But I don't think application developers are going to stick around.

1007
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:36,000
This is something I've just been coming to because, honestly,

1008
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:40,000
I've been getting telegrams and tweets and emails all week from people saying,

1009
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:41,000
yeah, I think I'm going to switch.

1010
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:44,000
My other question, are desktop apps, I mean,

1011
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:48,000
it doesn't really seem like a renaissance in desktop apps for any platform.

1012
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:51,000
I mean, Mac definitely has more established ones,

1013
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:55,000
but I think on this show already you guys have talked about like how hard that is,

1014
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:57,000
how hard it is to keep up with Apple's breaking changes,

1015
00:50:57,000 --> 00:51:01,000
how it's pretty small single developers who get stressed out about maintaining these things,

1016
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:03,000
how app store profits are going down.

1017
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:05,000
Maybe Windows has a lot of native,

1018
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:09,000
it just seems like native applications are not really a thing that's in vogue.

1019
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:13,000
Windows does not have a good independent native ecosystem.

1020
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:19,000
It's more you can monetize an app across Mac OS and iOS easier

1021
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:21,000
than you can on say Linux and Android,

1022
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:24,000
where Android is the closest corollary to Linux.

1023
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:30,000
Yeah, I actually think in a weird way Mac OS is having not a renaissance,

1024
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:35,000
but a renewed influx of desktop applications

1025
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:38,000
because of some of the cross platform stuff that they've been doing.

1026
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,000
I actually kind of disagree.

1027
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:44,000
I actually think the Mac has a pretty vibrant third party app ecosystem.

1028
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,000
It is competitive and it is hard to get paid

1029
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:49,000
and the app store issues are there and they are real,

1030
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:53,000
but there's a lot and there's some big apps now.

1031
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:56,000
If I can be shameless on my old interview show, the Mike Dominic show,

1032
00:51:56,000 --> 00:52:00,000
we had the folks from Rocamiba on and they don't deal with the app store at all.

1033
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:04,000
They sell their apps directly and they've been in business for what, 30 years?

1034
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:05,000
Something like that.

1035
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:07,000
Ridiculous since the early aughts, maybe 20 years.

1036
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:10,000
They're one of my favorite examples because the software they make is awesome.

1037
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,000
I use it every day.

1038
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:17,000
That's one of those tools that makes me go, oh, I wish I could switch.

1039
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:22,000
Or Wes, you remember that machine learning powered video editor

1040
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:26,000
that let you edit as a text document because that's Mac only.

1041
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:29,000
That thing is pretty advanced and pretty new.

1042
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:33,000
Anyways, I don't know.

1043
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:36,000
Like I said, I'm pretty happy with Linux.

1044
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,000
I think it's gotten pretty great, but we'll see.

1045
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:39,000
We'll see what happens.

1046
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:41,000
You spooked me, y'all, is what happened.

1047
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:42,000
I got real spooked.

1048
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:45,000
I've been belly aching to Wes for a week about it.

1049
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:47,000
Haven't I?

1050
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:49,000
I've been telling you for a week about the notes I'm getting in.

1051
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:50,000
Yes, you have.

1052
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:53,000
I mean, I feel it's hard when there's something on the market that's,

1053
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:54,000
you're like, well, that's compelling.

1054
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,000
I could see having an M1 hanging around.

1055
00:52:56,000 --> 00:53:01,000
I don't know that I would turn it into my dedicated system I spend all my time on,

1056
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:05,000
but great battery life, good performance for media production.

1057
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:07,000
It's definitely compelling.

1058
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:10,000
I can let that topic rest unless the audience has more they want to discuss,

1059
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:14,000
coder.show slash contact, but that was sort of my follow-up on that one.

1060
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,000
Wes, thanks for coming and hanging out with us.

1061
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:17,000
Thanks, Mr. Payne.

1062
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:18,000
Thanks for having me.

1063
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:19,000
Absolutely.

1064
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:21,000
Go check out some Wes Payne on Linux Action News.

1065
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:24,000
He's joining me over there and killing it.

1066
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,000
Been enjoying that a lot.

1067
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:30,000
And the last episode we just did, I was told today, was a barn burner.

1068
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:31,000
It was really good.

1069
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:34,000
Episode 182, linuxactionnews.com slash 182.

1070
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:39,000
And we break down some of the new interface enhancements and technical

1071
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:43,000
enhancements to GNOME 40, also talk about the RMS situation,

1072
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:47,000
him being back with the FSF, and we go deep into the chip shortage.

1073
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:52,000
And Carl from System76 gives us an update on how System76 is handling the

1074
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,000
chip shortage and what they expect.

1075
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:57,000
So that's all at linuxactionnews.com.

1076
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,000
Go get more Wes.

1077
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:02,000
Also, thank you to our members over at coderqa.co.

1078
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:05,000
If you haven't signed up yet and you want to get the Coderly,

1079
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:08,000
go sign up right now as you're listening to this because there will be a new

1080
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,000
Coderly very, very soon.

1081
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:13,000
So you go to coderqa.co for that.

1082
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:16,000
Plus, you support the show, which is really what's great, right?

1083
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:19,000
And you get a limited ad feed, so it's nice, tight, and clean.

1084
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:23,000
Still the same full, great production, but just a little bit snappier.

1085
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:25,000
That's all at coderqa.co.

1086
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:28,000
And you can find a Cloud Guru on social media.

1087
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:32,000
They are slash a Cloud Guru at YouTube, Twitter, you know, everywhere.

1088
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,000
Everywhere, it's just slash a Cloud Guru.

1089
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,000
And you can find Mike on Twitter.

1090
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:37,000
He's at Dumanuku.

1091
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:39,000
His company is at the Mad Botter Inc.

1092
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:41,000
Is there anything else you want to mention, Mr. Dominic?

1093
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:42,000
Nope, all good.

1094
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,000
Wow, nice and tidy right there.

1095
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:45,000
I'm also there.

1096
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:49,000
The podcast network is at Jupiter Signal, and the show is at Coder Radio Show.

1097
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:53,000
Links to just about most of the things we talked about today are at coder.show

1098
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:54,000
slash 407.

1099
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:58,000
There you're going to find our contact form, the RSS feed, links to our sponsors,

1100
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,000
how to support the show, all of that.

Of course, you can also join us live.

1102
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:08,000
We do the show 5 p.m. Pacific, 8 p.m. Eastern at jblive.tv on a Monday.

1103
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:09,000
Come hang out.

1104
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:12,000
Maybe give Fat Cat a hard time in there, you know?

1105
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:13,000
Oh, and title the show, too.

1106
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:14,000
That's another advantage.

1107
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:18,000
Thanks so much for joining us on this week's episode of the Coder Radio program.

1108
