00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
This is KOTOR Radio, episode 486 for October 3rd, 2022.

00:15.000 --> 00:18.000
Hey good buddy, welcome into Jupiter Broadcasting's weekly talk show.

00:18.000 --> 00:24.000
Taking a pragmatic look at the art and the business of software development and the world of technology.

00:24.000 --> 00:29.000
Live from Sacramento, California, my name is Chris and joining us, hopefully from his place intact, it's our host,

00:29.000 --> 00:31.000
Mr. Dominic. Hello Mike.

00:31.000 --> 00:33.000
What's up? I am not dead.

00:33.000 --> 00:35.000
No, the roof remains, eh?

00:35.000 --> 00:41.000
The roof remains. And, sadly, my backyard swimming pool, I don't have a swimming pool, but I did for about two days,

00:41.000 --> 00:45.000
has receded backward from whence it came.

00:45.000 --> 00:52.000
Thank you for all the well wishes. I tried to keep folks updated who were asking, but, you know, I was very lucky.

00:52.000 --> 00:55.000
So, can we talk about the Popo real fast?

00:55.000 --> 00:57.000
Yeah, oh yeah, tell me about it, I'm curious.

00:57.000 --> 01:05.000
I believe that the reason I did not lose power was because I am on the evacuation grid with the Popo in the emergency center.

01:05.000 --> 01:08.000
Oh yeah, I used to live on a hospital grid, that is the best.

01:08.000 --> 01:11.000
They keep that, they don't care, right?

01:11.000 --> 01:17.000
So, it was very, we were very fortunate, a lot of folks down here did, I took a walk this morning, I'm going to post them to Twitter.

01:17.000 --> 01:23.000
There's like a footbridge right outside my house, a tree, two trees actually, literally crushed it.

01:23.000 --> 01:24.000
Wow.

01:24.000 --> 01:28.000
Like big, you know, I don't know what kind of trees, I'm not, you know.

01:28.000 --> 01:30.000
You're not a tree expert, a treeologist.

01:30.000 --> 01:36.000
I'm not an arborist or whatever that is, but literally smashed it, so we got extremely lucky.

01:36.000 --> 01:45.000
It was some intense stuff and, you know, heart goes out to all the folks over in Naples and Fort Myers who really got shellacked.

01:45.000 --> 01:49.000
People worry, you know, because you're our Florida man on the JB Network.

01:49.000 --> 01:56.000
We're a Florida man, I mean, maybe it's time to, I don't know, stop subsidizing crap that destroys the environment.

01:56.000 --> 01:59.000
Just saying, as a guy who just had to deal with this.

01:59.000 --> 02:00.000
Yeah, man.

02:00.000 --> 02:01.000
Oof.

02:01.000 --> 02:09.000
I don't have to deal with those kinds of storms, but I feel like once in my lifetime I'll probably have to deal with a massive earthquake over here on the Pacific Coast one day.

02:09.000 --> 02:10.000
I feel like that's worse.

02:10.000 --> 02:11.000
Yeah, probably.

02:11.000 --> 02:12.000
I think you're probably right.

02:12.000 --> 02:20.000
You know, today is not only is it a special episode because you survived another Florida storm, but it's also episode 486.

02:20.000 --> 02:21.000
Nice.

02:21.000 --> 02:22.000
I'm such a nerd.

02:22.000 --> 02:25.000
I have been waiting for episode 486 forever.

02:25.000 --> 02:26.000
That's the number I keep.

02:26.000 --> 02:27.000
This is your moment.

02:27.000 --> 02:28.000
This is my moment.

02:28.000 --> 02:37.000
And I just wanted to go back in time really briefly and play a 486 commercial that really focused on the upgradability of the Intel 486.

02:37.000 --> 02:38.000
Oh, Lord.

02:38.000 --> 02:42.000
Want to run all your software fast?

02:42.000 --> 02:48.000
Then look for the Intel Inside symbol on your next computer.

02:48.000 --> 02:53.000
It says you got a real power source on the inside.

02:53.000 --> 02:57.000
Like the upgradable Intel 486 microprocessor.

02:57.000 --> 03:05.000
Power it up and run your software at light speed.

03:05.000 --> 03:07.000
Intel, the computer inside.

03:07.000 --> 03:09.000
Yeah, you got to get that 486 goodness, man.

03:09.000 --> 03:11.000
You got to have the 486.

03:11.000 --> 03:18.000
There was also a commercial at the time, and I wanted to play this because it is brilliant for the specs.

03:18.000 --> 03:19.000
Listen to the specs.

03:19.000 --> 03:23.000
This guy rattles off about his fancy new PC he's buying in the early 90s.

03:23.000 --> 03:25.000
It's it's adorable.

03:25.000 --> 03:37.000
I got a Packard Bell 486 SX, 20 megahertz. I got a hard drive with 100 megabytes to make the memory. I got a monitor, it's super VGA and a printer, 24 pin.

03:37.000 --> 03:43.000
I got accessories and software like Windows and Lotus works.

03:43.000 --> 03:48.000
You put it all together just before you're 98.

03:48.000 --> 03:51.000
That's what it's all about.

03:51.000 --> 03:52.000
Yeah, man.

03:52.000 --> 03:55.000
Isn't that something? Super VGA.

03:55.000 --> 03:58.000
I don't know why that one caught me particularly.

03:58.000 --> 04:01.000
100 megabyte hard drive.

04:01.000 --> 04:03.000
That's a lot.

04:03.000 --> 04:04.000
I know.

04:04.000 --> 04:08.000
One day you'll have that in your pocket and one day that'll be what it cost to open CNN.

04:08.000 --> 04:09.000
Yeah, right.

04:09.000 --> 04:10.000
You know, that's why I just I don't know.

04:10.000 --> 04:21.000
486 is such a I remember I think in part that was really when I came into like recognizing there was different processors and computers and that different processors were faster and started to pay attention a lot more during the 40s.

04:21.000 --> 04:22.000
Six era.

04:22.000 --> 04:27.000
And I felt it was kind of appropriate that you found this Aqua EMAX or Aqua Max.

04:27.000 --> 04:28.000
Aqua Max, baby.

04:28.000 --> 04:30.000
It looks like it's from this era, man.

04:30.000 --> 04:33.000
They've updated the copyright on their project as of 2022.

04:33.000 --> 04:36.000
So I think they're still actually actively developing it.

04:36.000 --> 04:38.000
But the thing is like retro.

04:38.000 --> 04:46.000
Yeah. So so when I first started running Mac OS, I was a budding EMAX user and then I was quickly slapped around.

04:46.000 --> 04:49.000
We told the story a couple weeks ago and picked up them.

04:49.000 --> 04:51.000
But this is the EMAX client I used.

04:51.000 --> 04:54.000
And the reason I'll put it in the show notes because I forgot to do that this morning.

04:54.000 --> 05:01.000
But the reason I put it in is there is a pretty passionate hacker news thread of EMAX users.

05:01.000 --> 05:05.000
Just saying, like, we're here and I have to tell you, Chris, I've gotten the DMS.

05:05.000 --> 05:07.000
They are they are here.

05:07.000 --> 05:08.000
We see you.

05:08.000 --> 05:10.000
We love you.

05:10.000 --> 05:11.000
We're not talking about this anymore.

05:11.000 --> 05:19.000
No, no more, unless unless one of them ends or like, you know, like an EMAX contributor shoots a contributor.

05:19.000 --> 05:21.000
Please don't do that or vice versa.

05:21.000 --> 05:22.000
Please don't do that.

05:22.000 --> 05:24.000
It's we get it.

05:24.000 --> 05:25.000
You're there.

05:25.000 --> 05:27.000
Respect. Check out Aqua Max.

05:27.000 --> 05:29.000
I get it. You can live in EMAX.

05:29.000 --> 05:30.000
Check out Aqua Max.

05:30.000 --> 05:33.000
If you're on the Mac, the best part of Aqua Max is it looks like Snow Leopard.

05:33.000 --> 05:38.000
So yeah, it's that classic, classic Mac OS look.

05:38.000 --> 05:43.520
look oh man I sincerely wish we had never mentioned Vim or Emacs on this

05:43.520 --> 05:47.000
show yeah yeah that was a mistake you know what else it was also a mistake to

05:47.000 --> 05:51.000
admit that I was gonna try a new Android ROM but I'm here for it I'm ready for it

05:51.000 --> 05:55.320
Francis writes in and says check out Calyx you should check out Calyx OS or

05:55.320 --> 05:59.220
Calyx I'm not sure how you pronounce it C A L Y X Calyx OS sounds a lot like

05:59.220 --> 06:02.980
Calyx though wait a minute I like this and it's only for pixel devices I

06:02.980 --> 06:06.640
believe it's an alternative to something like main Android or graphene they both

06:06.640 --> 06:10.880
have a similar niche but Calyx or Calyx has a built-in firewall I've been using

06:10.880 --> 06:14.960
I'm very happy and Sasha wrote in and said I recently got a pixel 5 and I

06:14.960 --> 06:19.480
loaded up with Calyx OS and it's been great unlike graphene Calyx OS comes

06:19.480 --> 06:23.280
with micro G which means I can still install Play Store apps via the Aurora

06:23.280 --> 06:28.320
Store app they also use an app called shelter there's been some paper cuts but

06:28.320 --> 06:33.200
so far they like it a lot and it's still a Google phone to some degree but it's a

06:33.200 --> 06:38.000
better compromise I of course put on graphene OS on my pixel device recently

06:38.000 --> 06:40.720
so now that I've put on graphene OS I'm hearing from everybody that I should be

06:40.720 --> 06:44.000
using Calyx OS which is exactly what happened back in the day when I used to

06:44.000 --> 06:48.040
put ROMs on my old Android devices I would do it and then immediately be told

06:48.040 --> 06:50.400
by everybody that I use the wrong ROM when I should try out this totally

06:50.400 --> 06:57.160
different ROM and it feels like I'm right back in that again however I do

06:57.160 --> 07:02.300
feel like perhaps what it is is that graphene OS skews more towards the

07:02.300 --> 07:06.240
privacy conscious and I think there's a spectrum here and I think the Calyx

07:06.240 --> 07:10.800
folks are maybe more traditionally lineage type lineage type folks that

07:10.800 --> 07:13.760
they want to they want a lot of the functionality of their smartphone they

07:13.760 --> 07:17.960
just want to be a little bit more removed from Google where graphene OS

07:17.960 --> 07:24.440
has taken some plumbing improvements like they're using se Linux to sandbox

07:24.440 --> 07:29.400
Google Play and the Google Play services so you can actually install Google Play

07:29.400 --> 07:34.560
services in the Google Play Store on graphene OS run them in a sandbox that

07:34.560 --> 07:39.600
prevents access outside of that sandbox where on Calyx or Calyx or however you

07:39.600 --> 07:44.200
say it they're using micro G which is a port it's a re-implementation of the

07:44.200 --> 07:51.160
play API and it's partially open source I believe and there is a aspect of it

07:51.160 --> 07:55.840
that runs highly privileged in the system app domain like the regular play

07:55.840 --> 08:00.040
services whereas with graphene OS everything is sandboxed and they're

08:00.040 --> 08:04.920
running they play services at a lower privilege level that is enforced by se

08:04.920 --> 08:08.720
Linux so that's my big understanding of the two but there is a whole underbelly

08:08.720 --> 08:13.920
here I scratched accidentally there's a lot of people out there that are getting

08:13.920 --> 08:19.320
pixel devices and then they're free flashing them which is just not what you

08:19.320 --> 08:21.760
expect right you think that's what people buy other devices for but they're

08:21.760 --> 08:26.040
getting the flagship device and they're reflashing it well kind of makes sense

08:26.040 --> 08:30.080
right there's no carry or nonsense on the pixel if you buy it from Google I

08:30.080 --> 08:34.120
think mmm right well if you flash it doesn't even matter you wipe it out

08:34.120 --> 08:39.240
anyway so yeah okay yeah I guess I could see that right it's probably one of the

08:39.240 --> 08:43.560
easier devices at this point because used to have manufacturers that would

08:43.560 --> 08:47.280
make devices for that community and they've kind of backed off from that

08:47.280 --> 08:51.160
hmm and they're decent phones so you're gonna stick with it I think I'll use

08:51.160 --> 08:54.240
graphene for a while I've been pretty happy now that I got the play services

08:54.240 --> 08:57.800
on there and you need the play store if any app has an in-app purchase basically

08:57.800 --> 09:03.360
you know so that's where I got hung up I had an I had I wanted to put photo sync

09:03.360 --> 09:08.800
on there and to get access to the cloud services I I needed to pay for it and so

09:08.800 --> 09:12.320
I was like that started a whole process and then if you have an eSIM you need

09:12.320 --> 09:16.080
the play services to activate the eSIM to really basically hooked it into

09:16.080 --> 09:20.400
everything oh yeah so that's okay you know we've kind of dropped the Android

09:20.400 --> 09:23.840
play services thread but I remember years ago we used to talk about how oh

09:23.840 --> 09:26.480
no they're putting more stuff in play services so now it's like you want to

09:26.480 --> 09:31.680
activate your SIM gotta have those play services yeah yeah okay yep and eSIMs

09:31.680 --> 09:36.960
are really taken off now yep so I'm not a huge fan of that I I think graphene OS

09:36.960 --> 09:41.240
is a little more secure too in the way it launches processes so overall it's

09:41.240 --> 09:43.760
like if you're trying to get away from Google it seems like that's the way to

09:43.760 --> 09:47.960
go to me and I'm I think I'm missing something because Calix obviously has a

09:47.960 --> 09:50.680
lot of people that like it and I know the founder has a little bit of a

09:50.680 --> 09:54.960
celebrity around him for Calix and I think that might be playing a factor as

09:54.960 --> 09:58.840
well but I can't quite tell I'm such a noob to all of this that I'm kind of

09:58.840 --> 10:02.840
discovering it as I dive in and then people tell me oh but did you try which

10:02.840 --> 10:07.520
is exactly what happens on Linux you know try a boon to all you better get

10:07.520 --> 10:12.700
Zeus tell me about it so so I have two side tangents here because that's why we

10:12.700 --> 10:17.000
waste our time running show notes one did you see you probably didn't cuz

10:17.000 --> 10:22.480
you're on the road that very quietly very sneakily Apple announced that they

10:22.480 --> 10:26.400
can no longer activate the data plan and you can no longer hotspot just through

10:26.400 --> 10:31.280
the iPad settings app on iPads oh no that was like a great feature you got to

10:31.280 --> 10:35.200
go talk to those carriers but that was great I used to use it so this is like

10:35.200 --> 10:40.000
you know back do you remember the old days Chris when you could travel freely

10:40.000 --> 10:46.800
stay a while and listen all levels of Tristam yeah I used to take an iPad

10:46.800 --> 10:52.200
because no matter what I could have connectivity and if at the time I was a

10:52.200 --> 10:56.840
t-mobile customer and you know they were t-mobile I know they're better now but

10:56.840 --> 11:01.460
if they suck I would just do the one month like $30 Verizon thing and be

11:01.460 --> 11:05.800
like whatever I'll do Verizon while I'm in usually like Colorado or North

11:05.800 --> 11:09.400
Carolina somewhere like that and you could do it all from the settings app

11:09.400 --> 11:13.360
inside that just right there right so even if my phone which had t-mobile

11:13.360 --> 11:16.800
service was crappy well I had this Verizon connection in a pinch if I had

11:16.800 --> 11:21.280
the tether or whatever and I never had to talk to a sales rep this was the key

11:21.280 --> 11:27.400
right I get locked into some other plan those were the days yeah that was nice

11:27.400 --> 11:31.720
I'm sure it must have been carrier pressure over time to get rid of that

11:31.720 --> 11:35.680
yeah they feel like the carriers hated that it's funny how those things quietly

11:35.680 --> 11:40.920
happen because you're right I had not seen that yeah turds yeah try to sneak

11:40.920 --> 11:44.120
it in that's probably all my thoughts on graph you know it's because I'm still so

11:44.120 --> 11:47.760
new I'm still trying to learn so do let me know I mean it's getting to be a bit

11:47.760 --> 11:50.120
much but I would like to know your thoughts on what I brought up today

11:50.120 --> 11:55.160
coder dot show slash contact or you can boost it in but then just a little PSA

11:55.160 --> 11:58.840
our last meetup on this West Coast tour is happening the Friday that this

11:58.840 --> 12:04.200
episode goes out so coming up on the 6th of October in Portland we have our last

12:04.200 --> 12:08.520
meetup meetup comm slash Jupiter broadcasting and I'm heading home kind

12:08.520 --> 12:13.640
of sad but also relieved from a technical standpoint this road trip has

12:13.640 --> 12:18.120
been very hard probably hard enough that this is the last road trip like this I'm

12:18.120 --> 12:22.360
ever gonna do so this is the end of an era in some ways and the last meetup of

12:22.360 --> 12:26.160
that era I'm gonna come up with something else but I think I'm done

12:26.160 --> 12:28.920
doing this format I mean you know what I thought this is gonna be the one Mike I

12:28.920 --> 12:34.120
thought this would be road trip by the numbers because listener Jeff has been

12:34.120 --> 12:38.640
an MVP of this road trip he set us up with a great parking spot at his place

12:38.640 --> 12:43.320
in Sacramento with power and most importantly of course it's secure and it

12:43.320 --> 12:48.400
could be locked up why we went down to Pasadena and internet he gave us Ethernet

12:48.400 --> 12:51.320
so I thought geez this is gonna be we're gonna we're gonna be we're gonna be

12:51.320 --> 12:54.400
stationary I'm gonna have Ethernet connectivity I'm gonna have power

12:54.400 --> 12:59.560
hookups what could go wrong right instead I had multiple devices fail in

12:59.560 --> 13:04.960
the studio that I rely on and then I had a software update here in the RV that

13:04.960 --> 13:08.240
happened in the background and changed the functionality of one of my

13:08.240 --> 13:11.920
applications so you can no longer select the input and output for audio devices

13:11.920 --> 13:16.920
which was a fundamental feature that I used and then of course we had routing

13:16.920 --> 13:21.480
problems and all it just has been it has been a nightmare an absolute nightmare

13:21.480 --> 13:24.720
so I think this is the last one I'm gonna do and I'll come up with a new

13:24.720 --> 13:28.560
I'll come up with a new way to get out and see folks in the future so meetup

13:28.560 --> 13:33.280
comm slash Jupiter broadcasting for the last meetup on the West Coast Road tour

13:33.280 --> 13:36.880
and probably the last meetup of this type of trip I think that's just

13:36.880 --> 13:41.200
probably the way it's got to go just the way it is as they say and that West

13:41.200 --> 13:45.360
Coast room will continue the West Coast crew at on our matrix server at bit.ly

13:45.360 --> 13:50.640
slash West Coast crew that'll remain and as we figure out future events and stuff

13:50.640 --> 13:55.080
like that we'll let people in the area know in there so check that out too well

13:55.080 --> 13:59.400
we all saw this one coming but I think it still is worth mentioning and

13:59.400 --> 14:03.840
analyzing a little bit Google has announced that they'll be winding down

14:03.840 --> 14:10.720
stadia in January 2023 and TechCrunch wrote a piece and I completely agree

14:10.720 --> 14:17.560
that says stadia died because no one trusts Google they say it's that simple

14:17.560 --> 14:23.320
it's a kind of like the writing was on the wall when stadia launched Google has

14:23.320 --> 14:26.800
exhibited such a poor understanding of what people want they write what they

14:26.800 --> 14:31.000
need and will pay for at this point that people are wary of investing even its

14:31.000 --> 14:38.760
more popular products I think you probably agree with that I don't

14:38.760 --> 14:45.240
actually I mean I I do agree you shouldn't trust Google but I think there

14:45.240 --> 14:50.720
are just two fundamental flaws kind of higher level have you seen the state of

14:50.720 --> 14:54.800
high-speed internet in the u.s. yeah like this is not a stadia specific

14:54.800 --> 14:59.600
problem but until you know the dragon that is Comcast and all the other ISPs

14:59.600 --> 15:04.280
are somehow forced to be dumb pipes where this is all you know made into a

15:04.280 --> 15:10.320
utility a la municipal bit of fire was effectively right fiber optics I don't

15:10.320 --> 15:13.800
think folks outside the u.s. particularly folks who have better

15:13.800 --> 15:18.680
internet like South Korea and much of Europe can really understand just how

15:18.680 --> 15:23.600
the situation is here I'm pretty lucky that I live in a place where for some

15:23.600 --> 15:27.360
insane reason Verizon used to be here and laid a fiber optic line and now some

15:27.360 --> 15:31.960
company called frontier is happy to sell it to me but they're not making more

15:31.960 --> 15:35.360
we've talked about it before but this is a huge problem right the city of New

15:35.360 --> 15:39.960
York paid Verizon and I'm not just picking on Verizon but they're easy

15:39.960 --> 15:45.640
target to fiber up all of New York City and Verizon just like didn't do it right

15:45.640 --> 15:48.520
it just turned out that it's too hard too much money and there's lots of

15:48.520 --> 15:53.840
arguments about regulations and why does it cost you know to build a mile of road

15:53.840 --> 15:57.240
in the u.s. is like five times what it costs anywhere else and the answer is

15:57.240 --> 16:03.920
because you can sue anyone for any reason and that's probably bad regardless

16:03.920 --> 16:09.480
of why the fact is the we still have internet caps in a lot of places many

16:09.480 --> 16:13.600
places have just one provider who gives you the crappiest service possible and

16:13.600 --> 16:19.880
that's just a challenge for streaming gaming the other thing I think is kind

16:19.880 --> 16:27.800
of I guess maybe misguided here is the problem if you're a VP at Google is you

16:27.800 --> 16:34.760
need to make an impact on the scale of Adsense and search and YouTube it might

16:34.760 --> 16:39.200
probably just wasn't worth it right these guys are careerists these are

16:39.200 --> 16:44.840
business guys they're not you know they're not like super into the tech

16:44.840 --> 16:50.640
side of things maybe we can take a flashback in time when I was a kid I got

16:50.640 --> 16:55.880
the Sega Channel and I don't are you familiar with this at all Chris is it a

16:55.880 --> 17:00.800
channel no no I don't think I am this is an ancient precursor to this game

17:00.800 --> 17:05.920
streaming stuff that was run over coax it was a partnership between Sega of

17:05.920 --> 17:11.840
America and I think Cox cable okay and it was literally this idea you put this

17:11.840 --> 17:17.280
thing in your Genesis they ran a coax line and you could play a wide library

17:17.280 --> 17:21.340
of Sega games because at the time Sega would just pitch the publishers a little

17:21.340 --> 17:25.320
bit of money and they're like yeah sure we'll let you do this because nobody had

17:25.320 --> 17:30.560
it it worked fine because they were 16-bit games Wow this is back in 94 I'd

17:30.560 --> 17:34.440
never even heard of this yeah this was in the in the mid 90s things have

17:34.440 --> 17:38.400
changed quite a bit right and the reason I didn't have it for very long is

17:38.400 --> 17:43.280
because they canceled it they canceled it meaning Sega and and whatever thing I

17:43.280 --> 17:47.400
think it was Cox it was Cox or cable vision at the time I can't remember but

17:47.400 --> 17:56.040
this idea is one not new and it always hits the same problem of the ISPs do not

17:56.040 --> 18:02.240
want to give you the bandwidth you need because they simply don't have to right

18:02.240 --> 18:06.400
in his bandwidth paying performance all that stuff reliability a lot of folks

18:06.400 --> 18:12.440
down here are realizing after Ian that oh it turns out if there's only one ISP

18:12.440 --> 18:15.680
in the neighborhood they're kind of not you know paying over time and double

18:15.680 --> 18:20.160
timing it to get you back connected right right which is you know this is

18:20.160 --> 18:24.280
I'll put on my little commie hat which my inner my inner elephant will die a

18:24.280 --> 18:30.440
little bit but if something is essential it's not a product it's a utility right

18:30.440 --> 18:35.240
this this is probably just a utility and if you look at some other countries the

18:35.240 --> 18:38.640
reason they don't have this set of problems is because they treat

18:38.640 --> 18:43.320
connectivity and my mind correctly as either a pure utility or a pseudo

18:43.320 --> 18:47.120
utility yeah we definitely seem like we've crossed that threshold yeah oh I

18:47.120 --> 18:51.560
mean kids were going through school over the internet right that that should have

18:51.560 --> 18:54.440
been just like it that's the line it's over there's this should not be a

18:54.440 --> 18:59.400
for-profit or utilities are technically for-profit but you know it regulated

18:59.400 --> 19:03.960
best service minimal price industry what that said you solve the problem of it

19:03.960 --> 19:07.520
was never gonna be big enough for the VP that ran this or whatever the guy's

19:07.520 --> 19:11.960
title is to actually care right if you're at Google and you want to advance

19:11.960 --> 19:17.240
you need to be in you know Adsense search YouTube right maybe if you're

19:17.240 --> 19:21.520
lucky you can use this to parlay your way into a more influential position

19:21.520 --> 19:27.400
right God it's horrible but you're probably right I think too on top of

19:27.400 --> 19:32.240
that so there's the aspect of just really poor internet connectivity in the

19:32.240 --> 19:37.720
states which is the primary market for this thing but additionally you have on

19:37.720 --> 19:41.680
the flip side maybe folks that are living in the cities or living where

19:41.680 --> 19:45.520
connectivity is is really quite good maybe they have gigabit things like that

19:45.520 --> 19:49.820
well then they're probably more in a position to buy a gaming console or to

19:49.820 --> 19:54.440
build a gaming PC right so then where you have perhaps really great

19:54.440 --> 19:57.360
connectivity you kind of have this issue where they already have the gear they

19:57.360 --> 20:00.720
want they've already bought their games on Steam or from Nintendo and so they're

20:00.720 --> 20:05.560
not really the ideal customer either so there's just this middle customer that

20:05.560 --> 20:09.960
is I think like what you're saying a pretty small niche here well also from

20:09.960 --> 20:12.640
let's just assume you have the connectivity like you're saying like I

20:12.640 --> 20:17.040
was a stadia customer but it never made sense you you have to stream it plus by

20:17.040 --> 20:20.960
the game you could buy for two hundred and something dollars I mean 300 bucks

20:20.960 --> 20:25.880
whatever it is an Xbox s and then 10 bucks a month you get Xbox Game Pass 15

20:25.880 --> 20:30.360
you get Game Pass Ultimate and not only did it work better that was it you just

20:30.360 --> 20:34.320
it was like Netflix for gaming right yeah that I think was a killer too for

20:34.320 --> 20:39.680
stadia was just having to pay 60 bucks for a game for a service you knew

20:39.680 --> 20:45.320
inevitably was gonna die but now speaking to that though Google has kind

20:45.320 --> 20:50.400
of done the right thing here and they've offered full refunds on the stadia

20:50.400 --> 20:53.480
hardware if anybody bought the controller or the chromecast ultra and

20:53.480 --> 20:58.520
games they bought which I did yeah I'm happy yeah I mean I guess why it's not a

20:58.520 --> 21:04.920
big controversy right now it's also well you should have seen Twitter it's also

21:04.920 --> 21:09.080
quite the admission that yeah we were just shooting this you know back of the

21:09.080 --> 21:14.880
shed yeah you have a link to on live in here and that's the name that's the name

21:14.880 --> 21:18.400
young Luke I haven't heard and I mean I've wanted this for a long time we've

21:18.400 --> 21:22.920
all wanted this yeah I was an online user back in like 2012 when they were

21:22.920 --> 21:26.160
you know I think it was like 2010 2011 somewhere in there they launched the

21:26.160 --> 21:31.320
beta and I got in on that oh man and I even liked that I have always wanted

21:31.320 --> 21:36.720
this as a Linux user who wants access to more games I've wanted this because this

21:36.720 --> 21:40.160
seemed like a viable solution and then when stadia came along and they're like

21:40.160 --> 21:43.440
we're gonna stream you games but you got a portrait games to Linux and Vulcan I

21:43.440 --> 21:47.080
thought well maybe the weight of Google and the popularity if they integrate it

21:47.080 --> 21:50.000
with something like YouTube or if they could integrate it with some of their

21:50.000 --> 21:53.040
more popular products it was one-click link and now you're in stadium you're

21:53.040 --> 21:56.320
gaming you don't have to buy anything that would have taken off like wildfire

21:56.320 --> 22:00.640
I thought but they didn't go that way and they didn't inevitably convince very

22:00.640 --> 22:03.840
many developers to port their games to Linux or Vulcan and then at the same

22:03.840 --> 22:10.720
time valve came along with proton and an improved gaming experience on Linux and

22:10.720 --> 22:16.680
then the deck and it just sort of made stadia seem pointless the only thing

22:16.680 --> 22:21.560
funny about it Mike is that even just two months ago stadia's Twitter account

22:21.560 --> 22:25.400
was assuring people that were tweeting them that they were in fact not shutting

22:25.400 --> 22:32.160
down no worries there they said international corporations never lie

22:32.160 --> 22:37.960
yeah I guess they were so cocky when they launched it Google just had the

22:37.960 --> 22:42.360
Dreamcast and the Sega Saturn and those consoles like on display at the Google

22:42.360 --> 22:47.160
campus as like consoles are really dead now they're never coming back after this

22:47.160 --> 22:49.880
you won't believe what we're about to announce and they have these glass

22:49.880 --> 22:53.520
displays of these failed consoles on their front lawn where they usually have

22:53.520 --> 22:57.920
the Android statues in in anticipation of the launch before they made their

22:57.920 --> 23:03.240
announcement I just want to say as a Sega fan like lifelong Sega fan if

23:03.240 --> 23:09.400
you're copying Sega's console business strategy you're you've made a horrible

23:09.400 --> 23:13.800
mistake in fact when they picked up that Dreamcast and that Saturn they should

23:13.800 --> 23:21.160
have said wait a minute this seems bad why are we doing this because the

23:21.160 --> 23:24.760
Dreamcast came out with this Sega started this with the Sega Channel on

23:24.760 --> 23:29.000
the Genesis we're gonna pretend the 32x doesn't exist because it you know nobody

23:29.000 --> 23:33.160
bought it it was me and two other guys the Dreamcast was the first online

23:33.160 --> 23:38.560
gaming network that was a console it plugged into your 56k modem it was a

23:38.560 --> 23:43.800
partnership with it was epics internet or earth link I can't remember but

23:43.800 --> 23:52.560
somebody can fact-check me and it failed for basically the same reasons like

23:52.560 --> 24:00.000
saying has been trying to do this since 94 trust me I was there I was working my

24:00.000 --> 24:09.200
teenage job to get a damn Dreamcast I'm so sad right now never mind so the Wall

24:09.200 --> 24:13.200
Street Journal written by Christopher Mims over there has a piece called the

24:13.200 --> 24:20.180
next battle between Google and Apple is for the soul of your car and actually

24:20.180 --> 24:26.400
makes a pretty good case that this is heating up essentially Tesla and some

24:26.400 --> 24:30.320
other mobile car creators are basically mobile phone makers now but other car

24:30.320 --> 24:35.760
creators have really upped their game on the infotainment and so it is now the

24:35.760 --> 24:39.260
number one requested feature when customers go to buy a new car if you

24:39.260 --> 24:44.440
can believe it is Apple CarPlay or Google Android auto support and the

24:44.440 --> 24:51.680
infotainment system is now the number one source of consumer complaints about

24:51.680 --> 24:56.720
new car issues is the crappy infotainment systems and so you have this

24:56.720 --> 25:01.640
situation where the car manufacturers are feeling more and more pressure to

25:01.640 --> 25:05.920
let Google and Apple in to solve this problem for them and of course Google's

25:05.920 --> 25:10.440
solution involves Android automotive which is which is more extensive than

25:10.440 --> 25:14.360
Android auto same similar name I read real similar name very dumb but Android

25:14.360 --> 25:19.240
automotive is a full car OS that takes over everything and Google has announced

25:19.240 --> 25:25.480
partnerships with a dozen automakers including Honda BMW Nissan General Motors

25:25.480 --> 25:30.640
the Chevy brands and Apple has announced a dozen launch partners for their next

25:30.640 --> 25:34.880
generation of CarPlay which isn't a whole OS but is an expanded version of

25:34.880 --> 25:38.480
CarPlay that likely depends that on car manufacturers meeting certain

25:38.480 --> 25:43.600
requirements and those include Volvo Ford Honda Mercedes Porsche and others

25:43.600 --> 25:50.240
and we got a little tease of Apple's whole scheme at WWDC where they showed

25:50.240 --> 25:54.240
that CarPlay software taking over the entire instrument cluster from the over

25:54.240 --> 25:59.000
the entire dash with your gas gauge or your charge gauge and your RPMs and your

25:59.000 --> 26:03.200
speed all of that gets taken over by CarPlay now but they haven't yet

26:03.200 --> 26:08.800
announced a dedicated OS and it would seem kind of out of character for Apple

26:08.800 --> 26:14.040
to actually license an OS yeah that's just not really their style it's more

26:14.040 --> 26:17.400
like the manufacturer will have to build to a spec and then Apple will sell them

26:17.400 --> 26:22.960
the OS yeah sit down kill Emilio no one's asking you yeah this is like a

26:22.960 --> 26:28.480
whole new OS war that is brewing and what scares me about it is that people

26:28.480 --> 26:33.200
making the decisions historically are horrible at software they do suck it's

26:33.200 --> 26:38.600
true where does this take us when you have companies that are building devices

26:38.600 --> 26:44.600
that can kill us that are essential and have a horrible history at software and

26:44.600 --> 26:50.520
UI and now they have to try to bridge this gap and in some cases like Volvo

26:50.520 --> 26:56.600
and others they're gonna have their own OS as well so you have Volvo car dot OS

26:56.600 --> 27:04.360
which will be running Android automotive in an emulator great and so you and then

27:04.360 --> 27:08.040
you also have like the ECM and you have the other car computer modules that are

27:08.040 --> 27:11.240
also separate but maybe has Volvo software on it that ties it together

27:11.240 --> 27:17.320
follow us that then like runs I guess an API set that Android automotive can talk

27:17.320 --> 27:22.040
to but the whole thing like it sounds horrible it sounds like it sounds like a

27:22.040 --> 27:28.040
massively complicated software stack in a car and that sounds dangerous to me

27:28.040 --> 27:32.280
and I'm wondering if you feel the same way if you feel opposite if you have any

27:32.280 --> 27:39.040
thoughts on this I mean I'm not sure that we need this but you know I drive a

27:39.040 --> 27:44.240
Chevy let me tell you what happens I look at the non-digital gauges and I'm

27:44.240 --> 27:50.160
very happy with that I plug in my iPhone and it does the carplay thing on the you

27:50.160 --> 27:54.560
know the dash I will tell you when I don't look into my iPhone whatever

27:54.560 --> 28:01.720
horrible operating system Chevrolet has or GM has put on that it's crap oh so

28:01.720 --> 28:06.400
bad it's so bad it get like even things like tuning FM radio stations were

28:06.400 --> 28:10.400
easier on my old Chevy that did not have any of this crap right that was just

28:10.400 --> 28:14.200
like it was knobs remember knobs knobs were great mm-hmm

28:14.200 --> 28:20.080
we had a real-world problem in in my house of I have so much Apple stuff that

28:20.080 --> 28:23.880
we're basically incentivized to always buy the Apple accessory for something

28:23.880 --> 28:29.240
or the Apple compatible accessory right ecosystem so is your car gonna be one of

28:29.240 --> 28:33.200
these things now to where it's like well I have an Apple watch and and I have an

28:33.200 --> 28:36.600
iPhone and I could see like Apple's going into this car crash detection will

28:36.600 --> 28:42.440
it work better if you have an Apple OS powered car I would I would imagine so

28:42.440 --> 28:46.360
right hmm I hadn't even thought of the fact that safety features like that

28:46.360 --> 28:49.960
could be a thing yeah you're right what if I run a car that's running Android OS

28:49.960 --> 28:54.000
but you know I just rent which I used to do all the time before kovat right in a

28:54.000 --> 29:00.600
strange city rent a car right now the situation is most modernist cars that I

29:00.600 --> 29:04.200
rent I can plug in my iPhone and I have my familiar interface my maps save

29:04.200 --> 29:09.200
destinations all that if I do that in a car running Android OS there's Google

29:09.200 --> 29:13.800
gonna make a deal with the manufacturer to not allow carplay on that car right

29:13.800 --> 29:19.960
to somehow block that screen right I don't know I feel like if you wanted to

29:19.960 --> 29:25.440
innovate somewhere with vehicles this is me I see why they want to do it because

29:25.440 --> 29:30.720
it's more of like a luxury thing that they can charge for but how about full

29:30.720 --> 29:39.600
electrification right I know that's hard but life is hard you can do it and don't

29:39.600 --> 29:42.840
worry if you're GM if you fail the government will just like make let you

29:42.840 --> 29:46.600
do some weird crazy bankruptcy that nobody else gets to do so there's that

29:46.600 --> 29:50.640
right of course and if you're Ford you'll realize that the government's

29:50.640 --> 29:54.880
gonna punish you and you'll somehow not file bankruptcy right I'm just saying I

29:54.880 --> 29:59.600
don't know they have little downside risk they can they can kind of afford to

29:59.600 --> 30:03.960
screw around with this a little bit but I feel like their failure to do a good

30:03.960 --> 30:07.840
job here has created a market opportunity for Google and Apple no it

30:07.840 --> 30:13.080
also is gonna screw over local mechanics but this is yet another thing totally

30:13.080 --> 30:17.880
proprietary totally computerized I was thinking about it to it and I don't

30:17.880 --> 30:20.960
know maybe there's just no getting around this but you know I just got done

30:20.960 --> 30:25.600
putting graphene OS on my pixel as an effort to see what's the downside of

30:25.600 --> 30:28.480
moving away from Google services and trying to replace them with my own

30:28.480 --> 30:32.200
things like next cloud and graphene OS and it'd just be kind of funny to kind

30:32.200 --> 30:36.560
of go through this multi-year process of de googling just to end up buying a car

30:36.560 --> 30:41.940
that forces me to use a Google OS that would really suck and then I realized

30:41.940 --> 30:45.800
it's a very first world problem but it's gonna be a problem like I'm gonna I'm

30:45.800 --> 30:49.560
actively trying to send this company less of my information and then the

30:49.560 --> 30:53.800
auto manufacturer comes along and just sells me a $70,000 car or whatever with

30:53.800 --> 30:57.640
Google stuff built in I just don't know about that you're right I like the idea

30:57.640 --> 31:02.240
that's on a removable upgradable device my phone gets upgraded very frequently

31:02.240 --> 31:07.220
my car does not and I've always preferred to have the computing in a

31:07.220 --> 31:09.800
little separate module I doesn't need to be wireless it doesn't need to be that

31:09.800 --> 31:13.640
fancy I don't mind plugging it in to let it charge to let it have fast

31:13.640 --> 31:17.600
connectivity and then like you said all of my saved data that I want to use

31:17.600 --> 31:22.160
comes up on the screen and that works just fine I also think it's a little

31:22.160 --> 31:25.960
alarming as we just build in more and more layers of complexity that we're not

31:25.960 --> 31:31.440
really requiring these companies to I don't know prove that they can build

31:31.440 --> 31:38.000
these things first like they just ship it and my wife has a 2013 I think Ford

31:38.000 --> 31:46.200
Focus and the sync software on the 2013 Ford Focus feels like alpha crap it is

31:46.200 --> 31:51.800
busted by design it is horrible I've talked to other focus owners they hate

31:51.800 --> 31:58.000
it and it got better in later years but it took them years and years and years

31:58.000 --> 32:02.960
of iterating before it got very usable and it's not like they issue updates to

32:02.960 --> 32:06.960
the old cars so my wife's driving around with what is basically she was a beta

32:06.960 --> 32:13.080
tester for Microsoft sync and you know that car is it's a frustrating car

32:13.080 --> 32:16.880
because of sync it's such a silly thing to have like the motor works fine

32:16.880 --> 32:21.080
everything mechanically about the car is fine but sync drives us crazy every day

32:21.080 --> 32:25.320
yeah I cannot tell you how desperate my chef is to get me to subscribe to on

32:25.320 --> 32:32.920
star it's just bad I mean there's are all just horrible horrible systems and

32:32.920 --> 32:36.200
there's a reason everybody goes in and plugs in their iPhone or their pixel or

32:36.200 --> 32:40.440
whatever let me flip it around on you though so what if this happens let's

32:40.440 --> 32:43.760
just take it down the road a bit too when we work so we work some of this out

32:43.760 --> 32:46.400
because you know like some automakers they're not even they're opting to go

32:46.400 --> 32:52.560
their own route entirely like a few of them are gonna be integrating the Amazon

32:52.560 --> 32:54.880
echo stuff into the car which that just sounds horrible

32:54.880 --> 32:59.360
great I hate voice commands in the car so much but let's just say we get down

32:59.360 --> 33:06.440
the road this stuff gets sorted out and we land on a Google Apple future in my

33:06.440 --> 33:13.280
opinion Google loses this because ultimately this kind of product lives

33:13.280 --> 33:20.520
and dies on the consumer feedback and preferences and if this sync system

33:20.520 --> 33:24.480
that's in my wife's car somehow like big had become like some sort of standard

33:24.480 --> 33:29.680
there was on a dozen different car manufacturers systems they would have

33:29.680 --> 33:33.240
suffered in sales I mean there's a reason why sync never took off Microsoft

33:33.240 --> 33:37.560
tried this like if they always do Microsoft was early they tried this they

33:37.560 --> 33:41.720
tried to get other manufacturers to use sync but the problem was is Ford's

33:41.720 --> 33:49.560
customers hate it and it hurt sales it cost them money so I think long term

33:49.560 --> 33:54.280
this isn't gonna work out for Google because they can't even they can't even

33:54.280 --> 33:57.280
properly name the products they have Android auto and Android automotive as

33:57.280 --> 34:01.780
we've just described with stadia they can't stick with anything and the

34:01.780 --> 34:06.240
reality is the car markets big but it doesn't have the scale of the web not

34:06.240 --> 34:12.160
even close only a small part of the market especially these days will be

34:12.160 --> 34:16.200
able to afford new cars it'll have this tech built in so it's always going to be

34:16.200 --> 34:23.280
a small niche product and that spells doom for Google Apple I think it's a

34:23.280 --> 34:27.000
little bit more of the roll of dice Apple can live and survive in niche land

34:27.000 --> 34:30.640
because they design their profits and the way they organize their deals to

34:30.640 --> 34:35.460
make money that way juicy margins exactly you got it you got to have them juicy

34:35.460 --> 34:41.160
margins right after all it's business business no one Apple they'll do the

34:41.160 --> 34:45.360
thing they always do all our stuff is great but this is the good and that

34:45.360 --> 34:48.760
one's kind of you know whatever they'll leave the old plug in your iPhone and

34:48.760 --> 34:52.440
get crappy carplay or what is current carplay and then they'll do the whatever

34:52.440 --> 34:57.600
car OS thing and that'll be are you buying a Mercedes my friends right

34:57.600 --> 35:03.560
that's I mean it's Apple and also if you're Mercedes you have a BMW it's

35:03.560 --> 35:08.120
probably BMW let's be honest you probably want to partner with Apple

35:08.120 --> 35:12.840
because a lot of your values in your brand and your whatever like lifestyle

35:12.840 --> 35:18.480
feeling and you know I'm at least in the US I can't I don't can't speak for the

35:18.480 --> 35:24.640
regions but it's pretty clear that Apple is the luxury brand here totally I that

35:24.640 --> 35:29.640
was absolutely well put this the brand Association they'll you know the car

35:29.640 --> 35:32.720
manufacturer wants to get a little bit of that shine because Apple's like in

35:32.720 --> 35:35.800
the top three brands of the world or something like that so they're gonna

35:35.800 --> 35:40.000
want that shine they you know that's just how companies work but I also think

35:40.000 --> 35:45.680
like we have the flip problem of it's one thing when Google is building

35:45.680 --> 35:51.400
products and services for the web and they shut that down okay you know that

35:51.400 --> 35:57.800
stinks but it's a web service will be fine but what about your 60 70 thousand

35:57.800 --> 36:03.760
dollar car when they just kind of give up on that what are you gonna you can't

36:03.760 --> 36:07.560
reflash it you can't put a new ROM on your car you're just stuck with

36:07.560 --> 36:11.840
abandoned software okay so don't yeah I mean you you've just made a very strong

36:11.840 --> 36:16.440
case to not buy a car powered by Android OS so I do think there is a little bit

36:16.440 --> 36:20.240
of that brand factor that the stadia factor where I think everybody when

36:20.240 --> 36:24.240
stadia was announced the first thing everybody did was wait for Google to

36:24.240 --> 36:29.200
kill it and they I think that does affect them as a brand I think it

36:29.200 --> 36:33.680
because it impacts the way I view this effort to hmm I mean there's really no

36:33.680 --> 36:37.800
way for them to fix that right no they've they've it's they've done it

36:37.800 --> 36:41.200
they've become known as the company who kills stuff I mean there's killed by

36:41.200 --> 36:46.280
google.com right and and to be fair they're the company who they're they're

36:46.280 --> 36:52.000
standard for big enough for us to care to keep it alive it's just stupidly high

36:52.000 --> 36:56.120
right when you were the default search engine the default advertising network

36:56.120 --> 37:01.600
for the entire internet you're just in a different you know you're thinking on a

37:01.600 --> 37:05.120
galactic scale not a not a county scale right

37:05.120 --> 37:11.840
god bless duck duck go who knows I mean I accidentally used Bing this morning in

37:11.840 --> 37:17.520
edge it was terrible right so yeah I don't know what to say yeah ask not

37:17.520 --> 37:24.440
what your podcast can boost for you but what you can boost for your podcast DPG

37:24.440 --> 37:30.840
boosts in with 2,000 sats and he says I'm boosting him to say that my upgrade

37:30.840 --> 37:37.400
from an 11 Pro Max to a 14 Pro Max has been absolutely amazing waiting three

37:37.400 --> 37:40.880
years seems to be the sweet spot for iPhones good luck on the road trip Chris

37:40.880 --> 37:44.960
I hope to do a cross-country one someday and meet my wonderful internet friends

37:44.960 --> 37:50.560
out west well that'd be amazing DPG 11 to 14 does seem like the sweet spot

37:50.560 --> 37:54.800
that's got to be a great upgrade that's a big jump that's probably the strategy

37:54.800 --> 37:58.600
if I wasn't on the upgrade program and that's kind of the cycle that my wife

37:58.600 --> 38:03.120
has been on I think she's on an 11 right now and I don't know if I'm gonna get a

38:03.120 --> 38:07.240
14 for her I mean that would be a decent Christmas present but I definitely think

38:07.240 --> 38:11.640
she'll want the 15 just for battery life reasons and whatnot I love that you know

38:11.640 --> 38:15.520
that's the thing about these iPhones there's always people out there that are

38:15.520 --> 38:19.360
always gonna be upgrading so Apple might not see unbelievable numbers I don't

38:19.360 --> 38:23.600
know if we've gotten any hints yet but there's always customers there's always

38:23.600 --> 38:29.600
gonna be customers they'll be all right yeah I think so Dave Jones the pod sage

38:29.600 --> 38:35.000
boosted with 2011 12 sats he writes I'm boosting the intro because I have faith

38:35.000 --> 38:40.000
you guys are gonna deliver it boosted during the intro Dave he also double

38:40.000 --> 38:44.880
boosted in with another two thousand one hundred and twelve sats

38:46.160 --> 38:50.600
and he's calling me up he says barbecue in California blows it's like ordering

38:50.600 --> 38:54.360
spaghetti and meatballs at Subway come down south and we'll get you guys taken

38:54.360 --> 38:59.480
care of I'd love to take you up on that Dave I would love that Dave I'm already

38:59.480 --> 39:03.960
down south I know what do you what is the is there a big barbecue culture in

39:03.960 --> 39:07.880
Florida is there the pride about barbecue like there is in Texas and the

39:07.880 --> 39:13.160
there it well it's not quite like Texas yeah yeah it's not quite like Texas so

39:13.160 --> 39:17.440
the trick about Florida is the more generally speaking the more north you go

39:17.440 --> 39:22.520
in Florida the more southern it is wait a minute the more north you go the more

39:22.520 --> 39:26.080
southern is because you're getting closer to the southern states right

39:26.080 --> 39:29.200
because a lot of like southern Florida like for instance go to Miami let's like

39:29.200 --> 39:35.080
it's like Cuban food which is awesome oh yeah oh my god Cuban food this and like

39:35.080 --> 39:38.640
I thought I'd had a Cuban sandwich and then I moved here and I had never had

39:38.640 --> 39:41.880
one before until that day I gotta come to Florida I've been there for like two

39:41.880 --> 39:48.040
minutes I gotta get down there it's see the problem of Florida too is it's weird

39:48.040 --> 39:52.720
man like I'm just saying it's a lot of stuff going on down here and there's a

39:52.720 --> 39:57.840
whole Disney area that gets real creepy like it's sounds like a party down there

39:57.840 --> 40:01.920
except for the storms you know but it's otherwise it just sounds like a hot mess

40:01.920 --> 40:06.400
of parties well I know I just got a flyer from DeSantis it is now officially

40:06.400 --> 40:10.560
known as the free state of Florida whatever the hell that means really did

40:10.560 --> 40:16.000
they make an official like proclamation I just wanna say this is laminated like

40:16.000 --> 40:19.120
I don't know how rich his campaign is because he's running for governor again

40:19.120 --> 40:23.320
I have gotten lots of political crap never laminated though never like this

40:23.320 --> 40:27.120
like I'm a dude I kind of want to hang this up except they don't because I

40:27.120 --> 40:32.480
don't know what free state means because that sounds a lot like like Chaz

40:32.480 --> 40:37.520
doesn't sound good right it sounds like sounds like we're gonna need a SWAT team

40:37.520 --> 40:40.720
in here to just like clean it up and we're all gonna realize that what looked

40:40.720 --> 40:45.560
like a protest was really never mind we're gonna move on all right yeah I

40:45.560 --> 40:53.840
know Johnny Johnny yeah with a 2500 sats says I'm considering upgrading my

40:53.840 --> 41:01.120
$4,000 MacBook Pro to a $1,000 dev one thanks guys you know John I think you

41:01.120 --> 41:05.000
can muddle through I I know it's gonna be tough but it's a tough problem it's

41:05.000 --> 41:10.280
rough but somebody's got to do it and why not both I say why not both you know

41:10.280 --> 41:14.720
true although with that said I got my last Mac hold out to finally I thought I

41:14.720 --> 41:19.080
had him a month ago but to finally switch to Linux today oh yeah oh cuz

41:19.080 --> 41:24.360
Xcode update broke his his Unix binaries that kind of stuff that's what it takes

41:24.360 --> 41:32.560
right for a dev stack yep mm-hmm non-standard locations on Mac

41:32.560 --> 41:37.760
pag dot boosts in with 1701 sets which is a Star Trek boost live long and

41:37.760 --> 41:42.560
prosper says thanks for all the great shows by never watching Star Trek I did

41:42.560 --> 41:46.840
a great sin and I have to ask for forgiveness to fix this going forward

41:46.840 --> 41:51.480
I'd like to know which season you recommend to start with would you

41:51.480 --> 41:55.680
recommend the old og1 or a new one like strange new worlds I'm looking forward

41:55.680 --> 42:01.120
to your answer really enjoy the shows thanks for a fellow mid from office

42:01.120 --> 42:04.720
hours okay oh I see from the right for inspiration for the boost amount for the

42:04.720 --> 42:10.560
enterprise right right mmm nice oh god I have to tell you I literally live in

42:10.560 --> 42:13.880
fear of this question on a daily basis I constantly think what if somebody asked

42:13.880 --> 42:18.000
me where to start with Star Trek and I obsess over this question because it's

42:18.000 --> 42:22.080
it's probably one of the most important questions a person will ever ask you I'm

42:22.080 --> 42:25.080
dying to know what you think I don't think we're gonna agree I don't know I

42:25.080 --> 42:28.960
think a couple of days ago my answer would have been different but while we

42:28.960 --> 42:33.760
were down in Pasadena for the JPL tour we stayed at an Airbnb for a few days

42:33.760 --> 42:40.600
and the most incredible thing happened it was perfect I swear to God I swear to

42:40.600 --> 42:44.400
God this is what happened I walk in the first thing I did at the Airbnb is like

42:44.400 --> 42:48.160
because you walk in the living room I turned the TV on there's a big TV Star

42:48.160 --> 42:52.440
Trek the next generation comes up and it's encounter at Farpoint episode 1 and

42:52.440 --> 42:56.360
then it's like a 35 year anniversary thing so it turns out they're playing

42:56.360 --> 42:59.720
every single episode in chronological order and we showed up right as

42:59.720 --> 43:04.680
encounter at Farpoint starts we left the TV on the entire time we were there we

43:04.680 --> 43:08.440
made it all the way into season 4 Cupid which is episode 94 in the production

43:08.440 --> 43:12.420
run we made it all the way through like best of both worlds you know like the

43:12.420 --> 43:18.720
good stuff and I have to say man mm-hmm Star Trek the next generation gets so

43:18.720 --> 43:24.400
damn good around season 3 and then just continues to deliver until the end of

43:24.400 --> 43:27.800
the series basically I can't believe this we're gonna agree I cannot believe

43:27.800 --> 43:31.200
this really is this what your recommendation was I could have sworn

43:31.200 --> 43:35.160
you were gonna say oh gee you have to do it in order I don't know I don't know I

43:35.160 --> 43:38.680
think you I think you got to learn to love Star Trek and then go back and

43:38.680 --> 43:44.200
watch the original series I feel like the problem and with og Star Trek is

43:44.200 --> 43:50.880
it's great after you watch TNG especially for more modern particularly

43:50.880 --> 43:55.920
younger audiences you know even I think people in our age bracket roughly might

43:55.920 --> 44:00.520
find some of the stuff in that a little interesting yeah I I think the first

44:00.520 --> 44:05.480
couple seasons of TNG are very much toss inspired they're like the original

44:05.480 --> 44:08.880
series and yeah a lot of people don't like the first couple of seasons yeah I

44:08.880 --> 44:13.440
mean I do think it's either og or original series the problem with with

44:13.440 --> 44:17.440
strange new worlds is you have to have seen the original series to really

44:17.440 --> 44:21.240
understand what the hell is going on I feel like right because it's playing off

44:21.240 --> 44:25.080
the original series I think you get a lot richer experience you definitely get

44:25.080 --> 44:29.200
a richer experience I think you could watch it in isolation if the production

44:29.200 --> 44:33.080
and pacing of older Star Trek like the next generation I say older but you know

44:33.080 --> 44:38.440
it's from the 80s and and deep space 9 if the pacing which I find to be perfect

44:38.440 --> 44:43.960
but if you find it a little slow I think strange new worlds would be like my

44:43.960 --> 44:48.200
backup plan right start with the next generation and if it's just not sticking

44:48.200 --> 44:51.720
then I'd probably try strange new worlds because maybe you just like that style a

44:51.720 --> 44:54.760
little bit more then you start to build an appreciation for the universe and

44:54.760 --> 44:58.840
then you can kind of pick up the other ones ooh but DS 9 though yeah wait a minute

44:58.840 --> 45:02.360
no no I think you could see I don't think you can do discovery because it's

45:02.360 --> 45:06.480
too different from the other ones deep space 9 holds up because it was it was

45:06.480 --> 45:11.440
early into that ongoing narrative storytelling and so I think it it holds

45:11.440 --> 45:17.360
up in binge watching I'd say it's TNG or DS 9 yeah I agree I agree let us know

45:17.360 --> 45:20.800
how it goes and if you feel differently if you've got a better suggestion I've

45:20.800 --> 45:26.240
even thought about like breaking it down to a list of episodes that cross all the

45:26.240 --> 45:30.880
different Star Trek's so you know you a couple of key moments from TNG deep

45:30.880 --> 45:34.240
speech would be deep space 9 Voyager toss you know in Enterprise and you throw

45:34.240 --> 45:37.520
them all on the board and you make a big list this is an important question so

45:37.520 --> 45:41.200
boost in your answers if you've got a better one because somebody will ask

45:41.200 --> 45:45.360
again and I want to do them right our last boost this week came in from

45:45.360 --> 45:49.920
nano bills that's how I'm saying it he boosted him with 50 sats and he said if

45:49.920 --> 45:54.160
you need to use flat packed VS code to reach your whole system you can use flat

45:54.160 --> 45:57.600
seal to allow that and I wanted to mention that because we've brought up VS

45:57.600 --> 46:01.200
code and flat pack a couple of times on Linux and how it's limited to the file

46:01.200 --> 46:05.920
system there is an app that you can install as a flat pack called flat seal

46:05.920 --> 46:11.200
one word and that gives you a GUI to manage all of the permissions on your

46:11.200 --> 46:15.120
flat pack apps on your Linux desktop and you can go in there and say I want to

46:15.120 --> 46:19.160
allow access to the file system I want to allow access to the camera or you

46:19.160 --> 46:23.760
know whatever it might be so check out flat seal it makes all of that a lot

46:23.760 --> 46:30.200
simpler to manage thank you to nan to tubes bills for boosting that in I'm

46:30.200 --> 46:35.040
sorry that I butchered your name I'm not trying I swear that's just how I am and

46:35.040 --> 46:38.840
then also a couple of quick thankies mr. quackers boosted in a row of ducks

46:38.840 --> 46:44.160
quacka walka it's a treasure Sean of the dev 512 sats want to give

46:44.160 --> 46:46.240
him the shout out and thank you everybody else who's either streaming or

46:46.240 --> 46:49.400
send some sats in that or sent a boost in that I didn't read on the show we're

46:49.400 --> 46:52.520
just picking some of them to try to keep the segment a little tighter but we do

46:52.520 --> 46:56.240
read all of them if you'd like to boost us go get a new podcast app a new

46:56.240 --> 47:01.560

47:01.560 --> 47:05.400
available on all platforms including the web and I know out there fountain is

47:05.400 --> 47:08.480
