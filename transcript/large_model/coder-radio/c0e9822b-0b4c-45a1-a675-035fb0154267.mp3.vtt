00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
This is Coder Radio, episode 343 for February 4th, 2019.

00:31.000 --> 00:36.840
Hello, and welcome to Coder Radio, Jupiter Broadcasting's weekly talk show that's digging

00:36.840 --> 00:42.760
in, taking a pragmatic look at the art and business of software development.

00:42.760 --> 00:48.280
My name is Wes, and I'm joined once again by our favorite, Mr. Michael Dominic.

00:48.280 --> 00:50.120
Good afternoon, Wes.

00:50.120 --> 00:51.120
How are you?

00:51.120 --> 00:52.480
I am doing good.

00:52.480 --> 00:54.280
Sounds like maybe just a little bit better than you.

00:54.280 --> 00:58.200
Although over here in the Pacific Northwest, we've had something of a snow day.

00:58.200 --> 00:59.200
I know.

00:59.200 --> 01:00.560
We're up there in the Arctic.

01:00.560 --> 01:02.280
Now, I do have a quick question.

01:02.280 --> 01:03.280
Oh, yeah.

01:03.280 --> 01:04.280
Go on.

01:04.280 --> 01:07.800
Were there any rail accidents near you or Chris?

01:07.800 --> 01:08.800
I don't think so.

01:08.800 --> 01:09.800
No.

01:09.800 --> 01:12.080
I mean, as far as I know, trains are running on time.

01:12.080 --> 01:13.080
I see.

01:13.080 --> 01:17.920
I'm on the hunt for Bruce Willis.

01:17.920 --> 01:18.920
Let's hear more.

01:18.920 --> 01:19.920
How's your hunt going?

01:19.920 --> 01:20.920
What are you armed with?

01:20.920 --> 01:24.080
I am armed with bones that shatter easily.

01:24.080 --> 01:30.160
I am armed with a wheelchair and a comic book art gallery that somehow stays in business

01:30.160 --> 01:33.360
with no actual marketable products.

01:33.360 --> 01:35.880
Oh, Mr. Glass.

01:35.880 --> 01:36.880
That's right.

01:36.880 --> 01:38.880
We should have known, Wes, because of the children.

01:38.880 --> 01:39.880
All right.

01:39.880 --> 01:43.600
Well, let me trade a question right back at you, Mr. Dominic.

01:43.600 --> 01:47.620
Well, what I observed since last time we spoke, there's been a lot of hubbub, a lot of people

01:47.620 --> 01:49.920
enjoying your enjoyment of Rust.

01:49.920 --> 01:51.880
How's it going over there?

01:51.880 --> 02:00.660
You know, Rust is kind of like what I imagined joining the Jedi Order would be like.

02:00.660 --> 02:02.080
It's magical.

02:02.080 --> 02:04.280
It's scary.

02:04.280 --> 02:06.920
It sometimes doesn't make sense.

02:06.920 --> 02:09.820
So does that mean they – when I saw you bought the Rust book, does that mean they

02:09.820 --> 02:13.140
send you like a nice Jedi robe that you get to wear while you're studying?

02:13.140 --> 02:17.600
So for every hundred lines of Rust you write that actually is quote-unquote correct, safe

02:17.600 --> 02:22.200
and compiles, you – yeah, you get one more inch in your robe.

02:22.200 --> 02:25.920
It's almost like a lab coat.

02:25.920 --> 02:29.640
If you're familiar with the Clone Wars, you're like one of those Jedi who doesn't

02:29.640 --> 02:32.600
talk, kind of just silently judges –

02:32.600 --> 02:33.600
Yeah.

02:33.600 --> 02:34.600
Yeah.

02:34.600 --> 02:35.600
Silently judges the other Jedi.

02:35.600 --> 02:40.880
Well, have you made any little test programs that you're particularly proud of or looked

02:40.880 --> 02:42.760
at any community projects?

02:42.760 --> 02:45.340
I have looked at some community projects.

02:45.340 --> 02:49.200
Some of the Rust embedded stuff has been pretty interesting.

02:49.200 --> 02:56.120
Now is it a community project if it's meant to more efficiently deliver Jar Jar Binks

02:56.120 --> 02:57.600
clips to Chris?

02:57.600 --> 02:59.960
Oh yeah, of course.

02:59.960 --> 03:05.360
That's an important thing and I'm pretty sure his feed is not yet entirely saturated.

03:05.360 --> 03:08.240
I think there's like – there's room for more Jar Jar.

03:08.240 --> 03:11.400
I just, you know, throwing it out there.

03:11.400 --> 03:13.280
Always room for more Jar Jar.

03:13.280 --> 03:18.320
So if I can do that and use less memory and therefore get more Jar Jar in it, that seems

03:18.320 --> 03:19.320
right.

03:19.320 --> 03:20.320
Yeah.

03:20.320 --> 03:23.720
I did notice someone started playing with implementing Python in Rust and that seems

03:23.720 --> 03:24.720
like kind of a fun project.

03:24.720 --> 03:25.720
Yes.

03:25.720 --> 03:30.040
I always find that, you know, writing interpreters or compilers or other things, it's different

03:30.040 --> 03:32.480
than – you know, a lot of the day-to-day programming you might do is kind of just,

03:32.480 --> 03:35.000
at least these days, tying different APIs together.

03:35.000 --> 03:38.640
You install a couple libraries, you connect up to some external services or write to disk

03:38.640 --> 03:41.720
or start a database and when you're writing – you know, when you're playing with implementing

03:41.720 --> 03:44.960
languages, you kind of flex different parts of the language.

03:44.960 --> 03:45.960
Yeah.

03:45.960 --> 03:47.560
I was taking a look at that project on GitHub.

03:47.560 --> 03:51.320
I did not understand like why I would want that.

03:51.320 --> 03:55.960
But it seems like just somebody is kind of, you know, for their education, kind of write

03:55.960 --> 03:56.960
edification.

03:56.960 --> 04:01.320
It definitely goes to show the power of Rust though, that you can write a pretty performant

04:01.320 --> 04:07.320
Python interpreter in Rust and it's not the craziest thing in the world, to be honest

04:07.320 --> 04:08.320
with you.

04:08.320 --> 04:12.120
Actually, it's not a terrible Python interpreter.

04:12.120 --> 04:13.120
Yeah.

04:13.120 --> 04:17.720
That's another nice thing is it can be helpful when you're learning a language to, you know,

04:17.720 --> 04:19.280
find projects that are at the right scale.

04:19.280 --> 04:22.320
It can be pretty intimidating if you're just learning the idioms to dive into a big code

04:22.320 --> 04:23.320
base.

04:23.320 --> 04:25.220
But if you can find something, you know, someone's just started with, they're still fleshing

04:25.220 --> 04:29.240
out parts, but it's big enough to have some like real code in it.

04:29.240 --> 04:30.240
Yeah.

04:30.240 --> 04:31.240
Definitely.

04:31.240 --> 04:35.040
I mean, I certainly wouldn't recommend if anybody is coming on this Rust journey with

04:35.040 --> 04:40.000
me that they write a Python interpreter, right, as their learning project.

04:40.000 --> 04:49.960
It's definitely a good example of, I won't say ease, but the relative, compared to like

04:49.960 --> 04:57.260
a C, and maybe I will say ease, the relative ease compared to like an old C language.

04:57.260 --> 04:59.200
Ease versus power, I guess, if that makes sense, Wes.

04:59.200 --> 05:01.480
I feel like I'm a little at C here, but.

05:01.480 --> 05:02.960
No, no, of course.

05:02.960 --> 05:07.080
But yeah, it is that ease versus power is, I think, the perfect way to describe it.

05:07.080 --> 05:08.480
Yeah, it's fine.

05:08.480 --> 05:11.320
I mean, it's gonna, I am in the beginning of this journey, right?

05:11.320 --> 05:16.680
So it's gonna take me certainly some time before I'm anywhere near a proficient developer

05:16.680 --> 05:17.680
in Rust.

05:17.680 --> 05:21.840
How much, I mean, what have your, has the compiler been, are you having a good relationship

05:21.840 --> 05:24.740
with the compiler or a little bit testy?

05:24.740 --> 05:30.560
So I have restricted myself to try to do things the quote unquote good Rust way, meaning thou

05:30.560 --> 05:33.160
shall not use that unsafe keyword.

05:33.160 --> 05:35.560
Yes, right, exactly.

05:35.560 --> 05:36.560
Leave that to the masters.

05:36.560 --> 05:42.760
Yeah, it's, if I have a good relationship, it reminds me of Catholic school.

05:42.760 --> 05:49.360
My knuckles are very much sore from being smacked with the, you know, ruler of the compiler

05:49.360 --> 05:53.700
being like, nope, can't do it, nope.

05:53.700 --> 06:01.520
But it's forcing me to think in ways I don't normally think about code, which I am hoping

06:01.520 --> 06:06.000
will, even if I don't end up using a ton of Rust in production, will make me a better

06:06.000 --> 06:10.800
developer overall in, for example, Ruby or, you know, C sharp.

06:10.800 --> 06:11.800
Sure.

06:11.800 --> 06:15.920
I saw some commentary on Hacker News earlier this week of someone posting a Swift program

06:15.920 --> 06:20.920
that had some threading and value types involved and there was some confusion over like how

06:20.920 --> 06:24.600
when mutation was happening, well, what exactly was happening and someone rigged up like a

06:24.600 --> 06:29.680
basically conceptually the same version in Rust and then showed the compiler output from

06:29.680 --> 06:34.760
Rust saying like, this represents potential unsoundness in your code and indeed it did,

06:34.760 --> 06:35.760
right?

06:35.760 --> 06:36.760
That was the whole point.

06:36.760 --> 06:39.880
So it's nice that you can actually get, you know, if you go through the steps in the work,

06:39.880 --> 06:41.920
there's some real huge benefits.

06:41.920 --> 06:45.120
Yeah, Rust makes you do the work, right?

06:45.120 --> 06:49.840
There's, I mean, sure you could throw the unsafe keyboard, but let's just pretend you're

06:49.840 --> 06:51.680
not going to do that.

06:51.680 --> 06:57.760
This sounds so kind of jerky, but Rust makes you actually think about what you're developing

06:57.760 --> 07:02.080
before you develop it, I guess is what I would say.

07:02.080 --> 07:03.080
I love that.

07:03.080 --> 07:08.400
You know, a popular saying is hammock time, you know, and for a lot of programs, not all.

07:08.400 --> 07:10.600
Sometimes you just need to like get in there, kind of hack some stuff together and figure

07:10.600 --> 07:11.600
it out.

07:11.600 --> 07:12.600
But the design phase is important.

07:12.600 --> 07:15.000
You want to make sure you're actually doing something that makes sense and that you've

07:15.000 --> 07:17.640
thought through how the data flows through your program.

07:17.640 --> 07:19.200
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

07:19.200 --> 07:20.200
Sure.

07:20.200 --> 07:21.200
Come on now.

07:21.200 --> 07:22.200
Let's not be silly.

07:22.200 --> 07:23.200
Oh, wait.

07:23.200 --> 07:24.200
This is Coder Radio.

07:24.200 --> 07:25.480
Are we going to write documentation to you next?

07:25.480 --> 07:26.480
I mean...

07:26.480 --> 07:27.920
We'll see.

07:27.920 --> 07:28.920
Maybe next year, Mike.

07:28.920 --> 07:30.480
We should all have something to strive for.

07:30.480 --> 07:34.640
We'll celebrate Coder Radio 400 with one page of documentation.

07:34.640 --> 07:35.680
Okay.

07:35.680 --> 07:41.600
So speaking of development best practices or worst practices, I don't do much development

07:41.600 --> 07:48.160
over in the land of Apple, iOS, the App Store, but I know you do and boy, howdy, there was

07:48.160 --> 07:50.120
some big drama last week.

07:50.120 --> 07:52.080
Well, do you have my bell?

07:52.080 --> 07:53.520
Oh, I wish.

07:53.520 --> 07:54.520
I wish.

07:54.520 --> 07:55.520
No, I don't do that.

07:55.520 --> 07:56.520
You wish.

07:56.520 --> 07:57.520
Well, I'm going to do it.

07:57.520 --> 07:58.520
Ding, ding.

07:58.520 --> 08:01.560
For years, I was right.

08:01.560 --> 08:02.880
But we won't even get to it.

08:02.880 --> 08:07.360
I think we have to walk our Linuxy friends down the Apple path here for a moment.

08:07.360 --> 08:08.360
Yes, I think so, right?

08:08.360 --> 08:09.360
Because there's a lot going on.

08:09.360 --> 08:10.760
There's a special type of certificate.

08:10.760 --> 08:14.080
There's kind of a long history from these other companies using the certificate.

08:14.080 --> 08:15.080
So could you...

08:15.080 --> 08:16.080
Can you break it down for us?

08:16.080 --> 08:17.080
Yeah.

08:17.080 --> 08:22.160
So long-time listeners will know that I have been complaining about code signing since

08:22.160 --> 08:26.080
the T-Rex ruled Washington state.

08:26.080 --> 08:27.760
Now in Florida, he still does.

08:27.760 --> 08:29.720
We call him out on the alligator if he's still in charge.

08:29.720 --> 08:30.720
Oh, yeah.

08:30.720 --> 08:31.720
Right.

08:31.720 --> 08:39.360
The code signing I was talking about was for the App Store or for development deployments.

08:39.360 --> 08:43.120
We are going to talk about code signing in a completely different context today.

08:43.120 --> 08:48.040
We're going to talk about sideloading apps, which I know shouldn't be allowed, but kind

08:48.040 --> 08:51.600
of is, via internal enterprise apps.

08:51.600 --> 08:56.000
In Android, there's a little switch you can flick that says, okay, I'm willing to damage

08:56.000 --> 09:00.480
my system maybe, and I'm allowing myself to install third-party APKs.

09:00.480 --> 09:01.480
But you don't...

09:01.480 --> 09:03.840
Or if you're running Android, you've already damaged your system.

09:03.840 --> 09:04.840
Yes.

09:04.840 --> 09:06.520
I'm willing to further damage my system.

09:06.520 --> 09:07.520
But on iOS, right?

09:07.520 --> 09:08.520
There is...

09:08.520 --> 09:09.680
Sure, there's some stuff like test flight.

09:09.680 --> 09:13.480
There's other methods that you can beta test or get a little bit of code for personal use

09:13.480 --> 09:18.760
to run, but not for larger deployments.

09:18.760 --> 09:21.820
Other than the App Store, there's about three other ways to do this.

09:21.820 --> 09:26.080
One is test flight, which you're allowed to do 1,000 devices, which for a lot of people

09:26.080 --> 09:28.440
is just all they need to ever do.

09:28.440 --> 09:34.080
The third is what used to be test flight, but like now is people use hockey app.

09:34.080 --> 09:38.200
The problem with that is you can sideload apps in an ad hoc way, but you only get 100

09:38.200 --> 09:44.160
of each device type, which sounds like a lot, but actually really, really is not.

09:44.160 --> 09:46.920
So it's hard to live in that world anymore.

09:46.920 --> 09:52.440
The third is what's called an enterprise ad hoc certificate, the enterprise certificate

09:52.440 --> 09:55.080
for short.

09:55.080 --> 09:58.880
That is basically what you're describing, Wes.

09:58.880 --> 10:04.240
The difference is instead of on Android where you say allow untrusted sources, you actually

10:04.240 --> 10:07.040
do it per organization.

10:07.040 --> 10:11.320
So for instance, you could do Jupyter Broadcasting or Linux Academy.

10:11.320 --> 10:15.800
I am sure has an enterprise certificate running around somewhere if they have iPad apps that

10:15.800 --> 10:16.800
they care about.

10:16.800 --> 10:22.060
To be clear, when we say iPad apps, we mean internal iPad apps, right?

10:22.060 --> 10:26.160
So these are things that probably are not going to be on the App Store, or they could

10:26.160 --> 10:27.960
be alpha or beta versions.

10:27.960 --> 10:31.880
I know nothing about the Linux Academy iPad app, but I'm just going to make something

10:31.880 --> 10:32.880
up.

10:32.880 --> 10:34.440
Let's say it's at version 2.2.

10:34.440 --> 10:39.880
It wouldn't be insane for them to give me and Wes version 2.3 on our iPads because we're

10:39.880 --> 10:42.400
hosts of shows here, right?

10:42.400 --> 10:44.160
Just to test and see if everything's fine.

10:44.160 --> 10:45.160
I see, right?

10:45.160 --> 10:50.360
It kind of reminds me of some enterprises have their own TLS certificates or root certificates

10:50.360 --> 10:53.600
that they have pre-installed the machine so that you have trust on the local domain.

10:53.600 --> 10:54.600
So kind of the same thing.

10:54.600 --> 10:55.600
Well, that's exactly what they are.

10:55.600 --> 10:56.600
They're root certificates for iOS.

10:56.600 --> 10:57.600
Got it.

10:57.600 --> 11:02.080
And then so whatever for your device will trust those and it's meant to be used, right?

11:02.080 --> 11:06.060
And I think it's stipulated in their policies that it's meant to be used for internal applications

11:06.060 --> 11:07.560
that aren't for wider deployment.

11:07.560 --> 11:08.880
Yeah, it is.

11:08.880 --> 11:16.600
The two acceptable uses are you are QAing a 2B public version of an existing app.

11:16.600 --> 11:22.280
Again, that's my version 2.3 example of a theoretical Linux Academy app.

11:22.280 --> 11:27.160
Or you are indeed, just using this internally, a great example.

11:27.160 --> 11:30.740
We could have a Jar Jar Binks Send Chris a meme app.

11:30.740 --> 11:31.740
That's a dumb example.

11:31.740 --> 11:37.600
Facebook employees evidently don't know how to order burritos and they had a custom app

11:37.600 --> 11:40.160
for that that they used internally.

11:40.160 --> 11:41.160
Right.

11:41.160 --> 11:42.160
Yeah.

11:42.160 --> 11:45.520
I know like some other uses that people were talking about as like internal like navigation

11:45.520 --> 11:50.080
and map apps or getting hailing rides from between different campus locations.

11:50.080 --> 11:54.560
Another great example, Google Chelsea years ago when I was up there, they had a bunch

11:54.560 --> 11:59.960
of custom iOS apps if you like or in a rush and really, really want coffee, like stuff

11:59.960 --> 12:07.520
like that because the support staff, you could be taking care of via a number of different

12:07.520 --> 12:08.520
apps.

12:08.520 --> 12:09.520
You could book all kinds of things, right?

12:09.520 --> 12:13.560
It's not super important, but like laundry or whatever.

12:13.560 --> 12:18.760
Well, because Facebook is evil, I don't even know what to say.

12:18.760 --> 12:23.640
I mean, there's a whole rabbit hole there of privacy implications, weird incentives

12:23.640 --> 12:25.800
and the whole thing.

12:25.800 --> 12:32.600
They decided to pay teenagers and other folks, but mostly teenagers, $20 to install their

12:32.600 --> 12:35.040
root enterprise certificate on their phone.

12:35.040 --> 12:42.240
These teenagers were not employees of Facebook, so that in itself is a gross violation of

12:42.240 --> 12:43.240
the developer agreement.

12:43.240 --> 12:46.840
Quote, unquote, Facebook research, it was the name of the app.

12:46.840 --> 12:47.840
Yeah, boy.

12:47.840 --> 12:49.800
Yeah, but it's a lot more complicated than that, right?

12:49.800 --> 12:54.800
So it used to be called something with an O that they bought from an Israeli firm.

12:54.800 --> 12:56.720
It was rejected from the app store.

12:56.720 --> 12:58.160
It was actually booted from the app store.

12:58.160 --> 12:59.160
Oh, right.

12:59.160 --> 13:02.400
This is like, it'll set up a VPN that sends all their stuff through Facebook's data centers

13:02.400 --> 13:03.400
and lets them do research.

13:03.400 --> 13:04.520
That's the whole thing though.

13:04.520 --> 13:07.520
It's like root access to the phone.

13:07.520 --> 13:11.200
So text messages, the whole kit and kaboom.

13:11.200 --> 13:12.200
Wow.

13:12.200 --> 13:18.920
So Facebook thought they would be cute by changing the info up, P-list data for the

13:18.920 --> 13:25.120
app, giving it a different name, and then basically paying people to install the enterprise.

13:25.120 --> 13:26.120
I love that, the P-list.

13:26.120 --> 13:27.120
Right?

13:27.120 --> 13:31.080
You pull up that little editor, tweak a couple of config values, save it back out there.

13:31.080 --> 13:32.080
That's all it did.

13:32.080 --> 13:34.080
Change the name, change the logo.

13:34.080 --> 13:35.080
Amazing.

13:35.080 --> 13:43.560
So Apple evidently was informed by a tech journalist that, hey, did you not notice this?

13:43.560 --> 13:48.640
And Uncle Tim said, I did not notice that, but I'm pretty unhappy about it.

13:48.640 --> 13:55.160
So Apple, with the click of a button or the stroke of a keyboard, one assumes it was a

13:55.160 --> 14:02.240
magic keyboard, that's what I did there, revoked Facebook's root enterprise certificate.

14:02.240 --> 14:06.280
Now that might not sound terrible.

14:06.280 --> 14:08.240
It's pretty terrible.

14:08.240 --> 14:14.000
So what that does is anytime a non-app store app published by Facebook tries to authenticate

14:14.000 --> 14:19.520
with Apple's signing servers, it can't, and therefore all those apps immediately stop

14:19.520 --> 14:20.520
functioning.

14:20.520 --> 14:21.520
Wow.

14:21.520 --> 14:22.520
Right.

14:22.520 --> 14:27.720
So this is where it sort of starts to get very interesting, because there is like, obviously,

14:27.720 --> 14:30.300
as we talked about, Facebook is kind of evil.

14:30.300 --> 14:31.840
No one liked what they were doing with this app.

14:31.840 --> 14:35.080
They had clearly violated the policies of Apple.

14:35.080 --> 14:37.960
On the flip side, I've seen a lot of people making points that like, you know, if you

14:37.960 --> 14:43.000
abuse or don't follow the terms of APIs that you request from Google or Facebook and get

14:43.000 --> 14:46.400
keys for, they will happily turn those off for you, no problem.

14:46.400 --> 14:49.960
So in some sense, Apple's doing that same thing, and the reaction makes sense in that

14:49.960 --> 14:50.960
light.

14:50.960 --> 14:54.720
But it kind of also reveals something about the entire ecosystem.

14:54.720 --> 14:58.140
Well, there's so many different ways you could take this, right?

14:58.140 --> 15:03.800
One is like what Facebook was doing is kind of gross and icky, and like, you know, for

15:03.800 --> 15:10.240
example, their method of getting parental consent was a check bot that says, do you

15:10.240 --> 15:11.240
have parental consent?

15:11.240 --> 15:12.240
Are you kidding me?

15:12.240 --> 15:13.240
Wow.

15:13.240 --> 15:14.240
No, I'm deadly serious.

15:14.240 --> 15:15.240
That's insane.

15:15.240 --> 15:20.600
So that's like, that's, there's no better word than icky here.

15:20.600 --> 15:27.400
Having said that, my pet pony for years now has been, you know, I mean, if you listen

15:27.400 --> 15:32.000
to the show from a long time ago, hey guys, Apple has a tremendous ability to pick winners

15:32.000 --> 15:34.880
and losers on their platform.

15:34.880 --> 15:39.880
And when they turned off Facebook's certificate, not only this, I would consider a malware

15:39.880 --> 15:45.000
app because frankly, it's, Facebook has really tried to say it's people knew what they were

15:45.000 --> 15:47.000
doing, but it's malware, right?

15:47.000 --> 15:50.000
This is malware.

15:50.000 --> 15:57.040
It crippled Facebook for a day, like, you want a burrito?

15:57.040 --> 15:58.040
Better be on Android.

15:58.040 --> 16:01.720
You want to, you want to hail a shuttle?

16:01.720 --> 16:02.720
Better be on Android.

16:02.720 --> 16:05.480
That was kind of the funniest part of the fallout here, right?

16:05.480 --> 16:11.000
Is that they had this totally for some other reason and then it impacted the day-to-day

16:11.000 --> 16:12.320
operations of these campuses.

16:12.320 --> 16:14.460
They really had come to rely on these.

16:14.460 --> 16:19.680
Are you a developer on one of the Facebook apps that wants to test a subsequent version

16:19.680 --> 16:22.760
or even a non-release, but perhaps alternative version, right?

16:22.760 --> 16:25.760
Maybe you're doing A-B testing.

16:25.760 --> 16:26.760
Sorry.

16:26.760 --> 16:27.760
Wow.

16:27.760 --> 16:30.120
The root certificates revoked.

16:30.120 --> 16:33.560
So this is crippling.

16:33.560 --> 16:35.840
By the way, Google had a similar program going on.

16:35.840 --> 16:38.680
They were doing a little bit of screen scraping in their version of the app.

16:38.680 --> 16:43.520
The interesting thing though is Google immediately apologized and then Apple hit them, but brought

16:43.520 --> 16:45.800
them back.

16:45.800 --> 16:52.960
Facebook kind of tried to defend themselves in a way that was, again, icky.

16:52.960 --> 16:53.960
So I don't know, Wes.

16:53.960 --> 17:01.880
I mean, this is kind of like Godzilla and Mothra fighting and I feel like the only people

17:01.880 --> 17:04.320
really losing is downtown Tokyo.

17:04.320 --> 17:05.320
Yeah.

17:05.320 --> 17:11.480
There is a lot of fallout and there's some kind of questions I had around, I mean, I

17:11.480 --> 17:15.200
was looking at some of the requirements to get one of these enterprise certificates and

17:15.200 --> 17:17.680
actually they're not crazy unreasonable.

17:17.680 --> 17:21.480
There's a bunch of like, you have to be a legal entity associated with this business

17:21.480 --> 17:22.480
and blah, blah, blah.

17:22.480 --> 17:23.480
You need a DMV number.

17:23.480 --> 17:24.480
You need EIN number.

17:24.480 --> 17:26.720
But it doesn't seem like it's shut out people.

17:26.720 --> 17:30.360
Like if you had a business that had a reasonable use case for that, it seems like maybe they

17:30.360 --> 17:31.360
would consider giving you one.

17:31.360 --> 17:32.360
One of these certificates.

17:32.360 --> 17:33.360
Okay.

17:33.360 --> 17:34.360
Right.

17:34.360 --> 17:36.240
So that was one aspect I was kind of concerned of because if it is only like, are you a serious

17:36.240 --> 17:37.720
big enterprise?

17:37.720 --> 17:40.080
No, you don't need to be.

17:40.080 --> 17:43.880
You just need to be a business that exists and by the way, business can be a sole proprietorship.

17:43.880 --> 17:44.880
Right.

17:44.880 --> 17:45.880
Yeah.

17:45.880 --> 17:46.880
Oh yeah.

17:46.880 --> 17:47.880
Sure.

17:47.880 --> 17:48.880
It could be a dude.

17:48.880 --> 17:49.880
Yeah.

17:49.880 --> 17:50.880
That makes sense.

17:50.880 --> 17:53.360
So the other part, right, that is scary is it's not even the fact that they immediately

17:53.360 --> 17:54.360
stopped working.

17:54.360 --> 17:58.280
It could be one thing of like, okay, you can't install any new apps that they released using

17:58.280 --> 17:59.280
this certificate.

17:59.280 --> 18:00.280
Okay.

18:00.280 --> 18:01.280
That makes a lot of sense.

18:01.280 --> 18:02.280
Yeah.

18:02.280 --> 18:05.280
But that you would like in time alter the state of my device.

18:05.280 --> 18:07.020
It's kind of like with the Tesla stuff, right?

18:07.020 --> 18:10.600
Changing the range, adjusting battery settings on the fly remotely.

18:10.600 --> 18:12.680
It's kind of scary.

18:12.680 --> 18:15.680
So this is the band hammer.

18:15.680 --> 18:20.040
It is my understanding of this and I have tried to dig into the documentation to see

18:20.040 --> 18:22.720
exactly how this works.

18:22.720 --> 18:27.920
For years, I have thought that it was kind of an ET phone home system where your custom

18:27.920 --> 18:32.640
enterprise app would call the Apple server just to make sure it was okay.

18:32.640 --> 18:39.360
That might happen on install, but what it looks like Apple actually did was push and

18:39.360 --> 18:46.720
say from the Apple servers to all these devices, this certificate is revoked.

18:46.720 --> 18:50.520
Therefore, the apps cannot run.

18:50.520 --> 18:54.120
Which is like, I don't know.

18:54.120 --> 19:00.600
I know that's kind of a pedantic difference whether the apps phone home ask for permission

19:00.600 --> 19:05.320
or the server actually pushing into the devices, but I kind of don't think it is.

19:05.320 --> 19:13.120
If you slow down and think about it, say Apple from Cupertino just like push some whatever,

19:13.120 --> 19:17.120
some JSON or however the hell they do this to all these iOS devices.

19:17.120 --> 19:20.180
You know it's JSON or worse, it's XML.

19:20.180 --> 19:23.360
It's probably a P list.

19:23.360 --> 19:29.600
The P list of death and just nuked a bunch of apps.

19:29.600 --> 19:39.800
So they theoretically, and like it's not theoretical, they in fact have this power over everybody

19:39.800 --> 19:44.320
and they just like never chosen to use it before.

19:44.320 --> 19:46.520
I was a little taken aback by that.

19:46.520 --> 19:48.160
Yeah, right.

19:48.160 --> 19:49.240
That is true.

19:49.240 --> 19:52.840
They have had this power the whole time and it's one of those – it's kind of like a

19:52.840 --> 19:56.440
lot of stuff in the privacy world where a lot of people kind of more in the know who

19:56.440 --> 20:01.400
are already concerned about privacy sat back and said, everyone else, yeah, you see what

20:01.400 --> 20:03.680
we've been complaining about and talking about all the time.

20:03.680 --> 20:05.240
It's not just theoretical.

20:05.240 --> 20:12.000
Yeah, I mean in a lot of ways, I wish it had happened to somebody who wasn't quite so

20:12.000 --> 20:18.360
icky as Facebook because I think we'd be having a better conversation about, well,

20:18.360 --> 20:24.100
even the manufacturer and platform vendor of my device and mobile operating system can

20:24.100 --> 20:29.880
simply decide that they don't like the software I'm running on it and like break that, right?

20:29.880 --> 20:32.580
They can break that.

20:32.580 --> 20:33.580
Is that good?

20:33.580 --> 20:37.040
Like in this case, they have a lot of like moral indignation because like what Facebook

20:37.040 --> 20:41.280
was doing was like unbelievably gross.

20:41.280 --> 20:46.020
But let's just like – I hate to sound like a Facebook apologist because I actually think

20:46.020 --> 20:49.480
like this is a company who can't go out of business fast enough.

20:49.480 --> 20:50.480
Sorry, guys.

20:50.480 --> 20:53.320
They used to try to recruit me all the time.

20:53.320 --> 20:57.360
Yeah, I mean they make some interesting technology and they certainly seem to pay well but I

20:57.360 --> 21:00.240
don't know if you could support what they're doing.

21:00.240 --> 21:01.240
I don't know.

21:01.240 --> 21:02.240
They're like skinning kittens, right?

21:02.240 --> 21:03.240
Like –

21:03.240 --> 21:04.240
Yeah, right.

21:04.240 --> 21:07.620
It doesn't matter if you write that cool new block device driver that's super interesting

21:07.620 --> 21:09.720
technically if at the end you're supporting that.

21:09.720 --> 21:13.720
Like somebody at Facebook thought this was a good idea, right?

21:13.720 --> 21:18.920
Like you know, I have ranted and raved about being annoyed with like App Store rulings

21:18.920 --> 21:25.940
and stuff like that but I have never thought to like massively sideload any of my apps

21:25.940 --> 21:29.880
to steal people's data or because I was unhappy with an App Store ruling.

21:29.880 --> 21:33.320
Like I have been unhappy with feedback from the App Store.

21:33.320 --> 21:38.360
I have felt at times that they were like capricious or like worse than that arbitrary.

21:38.360 --> 21:42.840
Like one time they bitched about something because they felt the logo or the color was

21:42.840 --> 21:44.520
not too close to something that Apple made.

21:44.520 --> 21:45.520
Oh, wow.

21:45.520 --> 21:46.520
Yeah.

21:46.520 --> 21:50.640
But like you know, I may have like raged and we didn't even have Slack at the time for

21:50.640 --> 21:56.140
JB but raged in IRC or Telegram or whatever but like then I you know, woke up the next

21:56.140 --> 22:00.000
morning and was an adult and you know, just comply –

22:00.000 --> 22:02.520
Moved on with your business, yeah.

22:02.520 --> 22:03.600
Right.

22:03.600 --> 22:11.640
I didn't like try to make this crazy end run around the developer agreement which I

22:11.640 --> 22:17.360
know I don't like that Apple has this power but I'm a little scared that if they didn't,

22:17.360 --> 22:19.520
what would folks like Facebook be doing unchecked?

22:19.520 --> 22:20.520
Right.

22:20.520 --> 22:25.680
So that was going to be my next question here is it seems like part of iOS and the App Store

22:25.680 --> 22:28.200
success has been that tight control.

22:28.200 --> 22:32.120
I mean there's the one side of it with like a really well-defined SDK and visual design

22:32.120 --> 22:36.840
targets and that whole thing but the other side of it is like they police the App Store,

22:36.840 --> 22:40.520
they try to enforce privacy respect and restrictions.

22:40.520 --> 22:45.560
There is a hard hand and I guess like the upside of that is instead of an open platform

22:45.560 --> 22:50.840
you have something that you can kind of expect works and is of a certain quality.

22:50.840 --> 22:54.080
And maybe that's not true but that's what a lot of – that's what a lot of happy iPhone

22:54.080 --> 22:59.020
users who are also let's say, desktop Linux users on their workstation say, you know,

22:59.020 --> 23:00.020
they have a device that simply just works.

23:00.020 --> 23:01.020
Are we talking about Chris again?

23:01.020 --> 23:04.480
I'm not going to – I don't want to name names, let's just say there's certain prominent

23:04.480 --> 23:05.480
members of the community.

23:05.480 --> 23:08.440
Let's just say a guy who is a fisher of men perhaps?

23:08.440 --> 23:09.440
Perhaps.

23:09.440 --> 23:10.440
Okay.

23:10.440 --> 23:13.640
So dirty little secret, let's open the kimono here.

23:13.640 --> 23:20.040
There are a lot of unscrupulous iOS developers who are doing things very similar to this

23:20.040 --> 23:23.520
with enterprise certificates.

23:23.520 --> 23:27.120
This is not that uncommon.

23:27.120 --> 23:32.920
I am not one of them because I – just like it's too much work.

23:32.920 --> 23:38.800
You know, the risk doesn't – the reward doesn't warrant the risk kind of thing.

23:38.800 --> 23:50.560
But there is an entire marketplace of I guess we would call them like gray market iOS software

23:50.560 --> 23:53.200
that are using these enterprise certificates inappropriately.

23:53.200 --> 23:58.360
The reason you haven't heard about like a crazy banhammer is because Apple, while it's

23:58.360 --> 24:04.420
against their policy, you know, is not going to like swing the banhammer on some kid who

24:04.420 --> 24:06.320
decided to write a Mario emulator.

24:06.320 --> 24:07.320
Right.

24:07.320 --> 24:10.640
In some ways it has to be like public enough or in their interest enough for them to actually

24:10.640 --> 24:12.360
go use their magic powers.

24:12.360 --> 24:13.360
Right.

24:13.360 --> 24:17.320
And like let's not – you know, it's not St. Uncle Tim here.

24:17.320 --> 24:19.840
He's been dunking on Mark Zuckerberg's Facebook for months now.

24:19.840 --> 24:20.840
Right.

24:20.840 --> 24:21.840
And there's been all kinds of –

24:21.840 --> 24:22.840
For a reason.

24:22.840 --> 24:23.840
Right.

24:23.840 --> 24:24.840
Yeah.

24:24.840 --> 24:25.840
Their fight there.

24:25.840 --> 24:26.840
I mean, their longstanding fight with Flash.

24:26.840 --> 24:27.840
Their longstanding fight – I mean, they don't seem to like progressive web apps.

24:27.840 --> 24:28.840
There's all kinds of stuff they don't like.

24:28.840 --> 24:29.840
Two major newspapers.

24:29.840 --> 24:30.840
Right.

24:30.840 --> 24:31.840
Yes.

24:31.840 --> 24:32.840
So I don't know.

24:32.840 --> 24:33.840
I mean, you're a girl.

24:33.840 --> 24:34.840
What do you think?

24:34.840 --> 24:40.020
I mean, I know you don't work on these restricted platforms like I do, but you know, I kind

24:40.020 --> 24:43.680
of feel like it's – I don't know what I think to be honest with you about this.

24:43.680 --> 24:44.680
Like I don't know if I'm happy.

24:44.680 --> 24:45.680
I don't know if I'm sad.

24:45.680 --> 24:47.800
I'm a little tired because they're acting like children.

24:47.800 --> 24:48.800
How do you feel?

24:48.800 --> 24:49.800
I know you're a freedom penguin.

24:49.800 --> 24:50.800
Yeah.

24:50.800 --> 24:51.800
I'm a little torn.

24:51.800 --> 24:57.960
I first started off – boy, like years ago I was doing like Windows and Mac.

24:57.960 --> 25:02.120
Macs have been a part – actually, I think a Mac was one of my – besides a Joss PC,

25:02.120 --> 25:06.880
doing Crystal Quest on a Mac was one of my first major computing experiences.

25:06.880 --> 25:07.880
Learned to type on a Mac.

25:07.880 --> 25:11.080
So it's been a long time using Apple stuff and I started off in the mobile phone world

25:11.080 --> 25:12.700
on an iPhone.

25:12.700 --> 25:16.240
Back then, jailbreaking was still a bit easier and kind of still a thing.

25:16.240 --> 25:17.240
So it was a different experience.

25:17.240 --> 25:18.240
More went out for Geohop.

25:18.240 --> 25:19.240
Yeah, right?

25:19.240 --> 25:20.240
Woo!

25:20.240 --> 25:25.840
So I've also – and I've also just seen on – after switching to Android, Android's

25:25.840 --> 25:27.240
mostly fine for what I need to do.

25:27.240 --> 25:30.440
There are times where the camera app is like laggy and I kind of question what I'm doing

25:30.440 --> 25:31.600
with my life.

25:31.600 --> 25:35.960
But the other times, it works pretty reliably and I'm reasonably satisfied with it.

25:35.960 --> 25:42.440
But I already have the apps I need and the Play Store is just a mess by any metric that

25:42.440 --> 25:43.440
you want to choose.

25:43.440 --> 25:44.840
You have no guarantees of quality.

25:44.840 --> 25:46.400
The reviews don't mean anything.

25:46.400 --> 25:51.200
I mean, there are some of those things on the App Store too, but there's a certain

25:51.200 --> 25:53.360
amount of – I don't love their policies.

25:53.360 --> 25:59.400
It's always been a weird walled garden and that just bothers me philosophically.

25:59.400 --> 26:02.680
But at this point, I'm – I was also someone who used to root his phone all the time and

26:02.680 --> 26:06.900
I was still like – I like the idea that I have the right to do that if I want to.

26:06.900 --> 26:07.900
But I don't, right?

26:07.900 --> 26:09.160
Like I don't right now.

26:09.160 --> 26:13.700
So there is that other aspect of like, well, I want to have even a switch to like use my

26:13.700 --> 26:17.680
own certificate as a – without having to apply, like to be able to get a personal use

26:17.680 --> 26:22.000
only certificate kind of like TestFlight but with less arbitrary server side restrictions.

26:22.000 --> 26:25.660
That would set my mind at ease, but I wouldn't – the thing is I don't think I would actually

26:25.660 --> 26:26.660
do it.

26:26.660 --> 26:30.000
Maybe if I was like testing out a new VPN or like really developing software maybe,

26:30.000 --> 26:34.440
but right now as a phone user, it just actually – I don't think it would affect my day-to-day

26:34.440 --> 26:35.440
life.

26:35.440 --> 26:36.440
Yeah.

26:36.440 --> 26:41.160
I mean, I used to – by the way, the thing about having your own personal certificate,

26:41.160 --> 26:42.160
you can do that.

26:42.160 --> 26:43.160
Oh, can you?

26:43.160 --> 26:44.160
You can just plug your phone in a text code.

26:44.160 --> 26:45.160
Oh, right.

26:45.160 --> 26:46.160
Right.

26:46.160 --> 26:47.160
Of course.

26:47.160 --> 26:53.040
So I used to – this is where Mike admits to violating the terms of service.

26:53.040 --> 26:57.320
I used to like root my phone and install Cydia – I don't know if you're familiar with

26:57.320 --> 26:58.320
it.

26:58.320 --> 26:59.320
I'm sure you're familiar with Cydia, right?

26:59.320 --> 27:00.320
Oh, yeah.

27:00.320 --> 27:01.320
Yeah.

27:01.320 --> 27:04.720
I can either confirm nor deny if I've played Pokemon Red, Blue, and Yellow on an iPhone.

27:04.720 --> 27:05.720
I have done the same thing.

27:05.720 --> 27:06.720
Yes.

27:06.720 --> 27:07.720
That's one of the reasons I did it, right?

27:07.720 --> 27:09.960
I want Pokemon on the go.

27:09.960 --> 27:16.280
So – but at some point, it's like too much of a hassle because every time they rev iOS,

27:16.280 --> 27:18.520
all that crap breaks.

27:18.520 --> 27:20.800
So I don't do it anymore.

27:20.800 --> 27:23.960
Yeah.

27:23.960 --> 27:32.440
I think I guess I agree with you with like the one caveat of – you know, Apple is awfully

27:32.440 --> 27:38.240
paternalistic for my taste about how they handle like their – quote, unquote, their

27:38.240 --> 27:39.240
users.

27:39.240 --> 27:41.400
But I don't know, man.

27:41.400 --> 27:43.240
There really are foxes in this henhouse, right?

27:43.240 --> 27:50.080
Like Facebook is, in this case, just a bad actor and it is a good thing that someone

27:50.080 --> 27:53.520
was there to, you know, fight off the wolves.

27:53.520 --> 27:54.520
I'm mixing my animal metaphors.

27:54.520 --> 27:55.520
But you get what I'm saying, right?

27:55.520 --> 27:56.520
Yeah.

27:56.520 --> 27:57.520
Sure do.

27:57.520 --> 27:58.520
Like there was a shepherd to fight off the wolves.

27:58.520 --> 27:59.520
Right.

27:59.520 --> 28:02.440
We have seen these like otherwise big supposedly at least one-time reputable companies willing

28:02.440 --> 28:05.360
to install apps that record you all the time.

28:05.360 --> 28:06.760
There's not a lot of limits.

28:06.760 --> 28:09.960
And while let's say Android has gotten a little bit better about permissions and be

28:09.960 --> 28:14.200
able to set those things, it's still pretty difficult for your average home user to understand

28:14.200 --> 28:18.260
each individual app permissions and what they've just agreed to.

28:18.260 --> 28:19.260
So how do you –

28:19.260 --> 28:20.260
Yeah.

28:20.260 --> 28:21.260
Yeah.

28:21.260 --> 28:22.260
So can I tinfoil ahead?

28:22.260 --> 28:23.260
Can I borrow Chris' tinfoil?

28:23.260 --> 28:24.260
Oh, yeah.

28:24.260 --> 28:29.720
You got to crinkle it up real good though to maximize the reflection of those dangerous

28:29.720 --> 28:30.720
frameworks.

28:30.720 --> 28:33.040
I guess reflect the gamma rays.

28:33.040 --> 28:34.040
Oh, yeah.

28:34.040 --> 28:42.160
If this is what they were doing on iOS where there was a guardian at the gate so to speak,

28:42.160 --> 28:47.520
I'm horrified to find out what they're actually doing on Android.

28:47.520 --> 28:55.160
I think someone should get a proxy like Charles Proxy or one of those Wireshark where you

28:55.160 --> 28:56.160
just watch the traffic.

28:56.160 --> 28:57.160
Right.

28:57.160 --> 28:58.160
Man in the middle of your phone and go like watch whatever is happening.

28:58.160 --> 29:03.600
Man in the middle of your phone and see because I have a – this is – the opinions of

29:03.600 --> 29:07.360
Mike do not necessarily reflect the opinions of Jupiter Broadcasting or Linux Academy.

29:07.360 --> 29:12.880
But I have a suspicion that those apps are pretty chatty.

29:12.880 --> 29:19.440
I'm just – there is one for Android and they have lots of apps on Android.

29:19.440 --> 29:24.820
I know from experience that if I have a native Android app, I can do all kinds of crazy shit

29:24.820 --> 29:27.240
with that person's phone.

29:27.240 --> 29:28.720
No one can stop me.

29:28.720 --> 29:29.720
Yeah.

29:29.720 --> 29:31.600
That is well said.

29:31.600 --> 29:37.160
The other part that was funny about this whole event is just how much of a weird sort of

29:37.160 --> 29:41.480
mind game, psychological mind game it ended up being because they revoked the certificates

29:41.480 --> 29:42.800
but just for a little bit.

29:42.800 --> 29:44.800
They weren't saying like, nope, you're done with these things.

29:44.800 --> 29:48.400
They still – they were like, well, I guess maybe – I'm curious one hand what you think

29:48.400 --> 29:53.200
of like the pressures on Apple to not revoke those permanently or at least for a longer

29:53.200 --> 29:57.880
time and the fact that like in a couple of days or one day or whatever the timeframe

29:57.880 --> 30:02.800
was back in business and like, yes, they've been checked, Google as you mentioned apologized.

30:02.800 --> 30:03.800
But do you think that would work?

30:03.800 --> 30:07.880
Like if they – if you violated it, they ran the ban hammer against you, would you

30:07.880 --> 30:10.880
get it back so quick?

30:10.880 --> 30:15.580
So there have been cases like that where a small dev shop has violated this policy and

30:15.580 --> 30:20.440
not only do they revoke your certificates, they actually delete your dev account.

30:20.440 --> 30:24.760
So the irony here is everybody – yeah, everybody is saying how hard Apple has been on Facebook

30:24.760 --> 30:27.360
and Google.

30:27.360 --> 30:31.120
This was a very light punishment relative to what they would have done to a smaller

30:31.120 --> 30:32.120
player.

30:32.120 --> 30:34.680
Yeah, like the fact that I had some internal blowback, okay, that was a little bit extra

30:34.680 --> 30:39.360
but otherwise, it's kind of a slap on the wrist for them knowingly violating some policies.

30:39.360 --> 30:45.960
So if Apple finds that you're doing something they don't like and there's a prominent

30:45.960 --> 30:52.320
developer who makes an app called Dash who we were going to have on the show but then

30:52.320 --> 30:59.000
he got in trouble with Apple and didn't want to go anywhere, they revoked his account.

30:59.000 --> 31:03.200
And the answer to that problem is open a new corporation and reapply and change your name

31:03.200 --> 31:12.320
and – they don't – how can I say this without being incendiary?

31:12.320 --> 31:13.320
Just be incendiary.

31:13.320 --> 31:14.320
You got this.

31:14.320 --> 31:15.320
I'll just be incendiary, right?

31:15.320 --> 31:19.280
They're not afraid to crush ants, right?

31:19.280 --> 31:20.280
So let's take the case.

31:20.280 --> 31:23.120
Let's just say I did what Facebook did.

31:23.120 --> 31:27.560
I am not asserting that I did, I'm just hypothetically.

31:27.560 --> 31:32.480
Not only would they revoke all my certificates immediately, they would actually throw me

31:32.480 --> 31:37.320
out of the developer program and delete my account and I would have to open a new company

31:37.320 --> 31:39.320
to get a new account.

31:39.320 --> 31:40.320
Wow.

31:40.320 --> 31:41.320
Yeah.

31:41.320 --> 31:42.320
Right?

31:42.320 --> 31:43.320
Yeah.

31:43.320 --> 31:46.320
It wouldn't just be restored automatically, it wouldn't just kind of come back because

31:46.320 --> 31:47.320
as you said –

31:47.320 --> 31:48.320
No.

31:48.320 --> 31:49.320
They wouldn't even talk to you.

31:49.320 --> 31:54.320
What they do is they send you a form letter.

31:54.320 --> 31:59.320
See, it's weird how lenient they were because this – and of course, you understand why

31:59.320 --> 32:03.080
because deleting a dev account would also remove Facebook from iOS, right?

32:03.080 --> 32:09.560
Which is crazy that they can't do that and I'm sure Facebook would sue for antitrust

32:09.560 --> 32:20.580
or whatever or anti-competitive stuff but yeah, hypothetically, Westpain Technologies

32:20.580 --> 32:26.760
would no longer be an iOS development company if you did the same thing and you were an

32:26.760 --> 32:27.760
iOS developer.

32:27.760 --> 32:34.040
The other elephant in this room here is that it's not like we have 10 different platforms

32:34.040 --> 32:36.840
that people run mobile apps on, I mean, unless you're still using Blackberry.

32:36.840 --> 32:37.840
Right?

32:37.840 --> 32:38.840
Windows Phone for Life.

32:38.840 --> 32:39.840
Windows Phone for Life.

32:39.840 --> 32:42.680
Hey, there's plenty to love there.

32:42.680 --> 32:50.040
But it means because so many people, especially sort of like relatively affluent or people

32:50.040 --> 32:55.040
in big C-level people, there's just a lot of people choose to use that platform so they

32:55.040 --> 32:58.800
have this inherent control just based on that choice.

32:58.800 --> 33:00.680
And people who own like five homebots.

33:00.680 --> 33:01.680
Yeah.

33:01.680 --> 33:02.680
Mm-hmm.

33:02.680 --> 33:03.680
Mm-hmm.

33:03.680 --> 33:04.680
Okay.

33:04.680 --> 33:05.680
Well, that's a lot of –

33:05.680 --> 33:06.680
Apple sadness.

33:06.680 --> 33:10.640
That's a lot of Apple sadness and unfortunately, I mean, I don't think anything's going to

33:10.640 --> 33:14.880
change so it's kind of an interesting moment to take a beat and reflect on like what are

33:14.880 --> 33:18.680
the realities of the market that we're all kind of playing in here and it's kind of

33:18.680 --> 33:21.720
not what we think but I don't – personally, I don't expect anything to change anytime

33:21.720 --> 33:22.720
soon.

33:22.720 --> 33:23.720
I don't think it's going to change.

33:23.720 --> 33:27.360
I think it's interesting how accepting as a community developers have become of these

33:27.360 --> 33:34.520
closed – like closed and aggressively managed ecosystems but that's just, again, my hobby

33:34.520 --> 33:35.520
horse.

33:35.520 --> 33:38.280
Well, you guys can all let us know.

33:38.280 --> 33:44.560
Head on over to coder.show, coder.show slash 343 for this episode specifically.

33:44.560 --> 33:48.960
That also reminds me, maybe you're an Apple developer, maybe you have a Mac.

33:48.960 --> 33:53.000
Well, some of our new shows, especially Choose Linux, that show we talked about and have

33:53.000 --> 33:56.640
been talking about because it's just so darn good, well, they've been trending over

33:56.640 --> 34:02.320

All of those are good things to listen to after you finish this episode of Coder Radio.

34:37.080 --> 34:40.780
Now Mike, I wanted to get a little more technical today since we've kind of spent things up

34:40.780 --> 34:43.280
in high level at the start of the show.

34:43.280 --> 34:46.320
I've been hearing a lot of buzz and I'm really curious what you think because I'm kind of

34:46.320 --> 34:51.760
an outsider here but I've been hearing a lot of buzz about C Sharp 8.0 and some of the

34:51.760 --> 34:56.120
stuff around nullable reference types and I kind of needed – I would like you to explain

34:56.120 --> 34:57.760
what's going on there.

34:57.760 --> 34:58.760
You know what?

34:58.760 --> 35:00.240
I wish I understood.

35:00.240 --> 35:06.880
There is a lot of buzz slash rage slash don't go on Reddit about C Sharp 8.

35:06.880 --> 35:07.880
Well, that's just good advice.

35:07.880 --> 35:08.880
Right.

35:08.880 --> 35:09.880
Go on 4chan.

35:09.880 --> 35:10.880
It's much better.

35:10.880 --> 35:14.600
So C Sharp 8 and we mentioned this a few weeks ago is adding nullable types, right?

35:14.600 --> 35:19.840
Nullable reference types, which is loosely like Swift Optionals.

35:19.840 --> 35:27.360
I'm not going to dig into the exact details of how it works but basically, yay, right?

35:27.360 --> 35:29.760
You have nullables.

35:29.760 --> 35:32.420
That's great.

35:32.420 --> 35:36.600
Now that I'm doing a little bit of Rust and I'm kind of – I was doing a little Swift

35:36.600 --> 35:38.000
before that.

35:38.000 --> 35:44.000
I am starting to see the value of quote-unquote safety via things like nullables and optionals

35:44.000 --> 35:45.000
and all that good stuff.

35:45.000 --> 35:48.260
You're kind of – you're diving off just a little bit taking a sample of the functional

35:48.260 --> 35:49.800
programming deep end.

35:49.800 --> 35:50.800
Exactly.

35:50.800 --> 35:51.800
Exactly.

35:51.800 --> 35:59.760
C Sharp has always been a little different in that there is just like so much existing

35:59.760 --> 36:00.760
legacy code.

36:00.760 --> 36:01.760
Yeah.

36:01.760 --> 36:02.760
How long has it been around now?

36:02.760 --> 36:07.520
Like there's a huge amount of legacy in that language.

36:07.520 --> 36:13.080
This is a gross generalization but it is also the case that is widely used for line of business

36:13.080 --> 36:16.040
applications that have been running forever.

36:16.040 --> 36:21.560
So turning on the – so there's an option – let me just slow down.

36:21.560 --> 36:30.280
There's an option in the C Sharp A compiler to – not require but to mark not handling

36:30.280 --> 36:33.200
nullable cases as a warning.

36:33.200 --> 36:34.640
Not an error but a warning.

36:34.640 --> 36:39.600
Well, the issue with that is many corporations and many organizations, development organizations

36:39.600 --> 36:45.080
in the.NET world, in their linters treat warnings like errors, right?

36:45.080 --> 36:46.920
So you actually can't like commit or do anything.

36:46.920 --> 36:47.920
Oh, yeah.

36:47.920 --> 36:48.920
That will break your CI.

36:48.920 --> 36:49.920
You won't be able to merge.

36:49.920 --> 36:50.920
Right.

36:50.920 --> 36:57.520
And the problem is like if you have C Sharp code from really anything that's not Greenfield,

36:57.520 --> 37:03.280
you're going to have like a million of these warnings.

37:03.280 --> 37:09.520
There is some philosophical argument about if nullables are a good or bad thing.

37:09.520 --> 37:15.240
Well, I do think they make your code slop – like look more like spaghetti-ish and –

37:15.240 --> 37:18.120
You end up with a lot more like just sort of check-in stuff, right?

37:18.120 --> 37:22.120
You end up counting from these nullables which is good because that's kind of what they're

37:22.120 --> 37:23.120
trying to help you prevent, right?

37:23.120 --> 37:25.520
It's missing the case when something can be null.

37:25.520 --> 37:29.480
But there's probably lots of also cases where it didn't really matter and now you have just

37:29.480 --> 37:30.480
extra stuff.

37:30.480 --> 37:31.480
Yeah.

37:31.480 --> 37:34.860
I mean when I first saw this in Swift, I was kind of like, okay, do I really need to do

37:34.860 --> 37:35.860
all this work?

37:35.860 --> 37:41.840
But you know what, I'm coming around to it only because code bases always get larger.

37:41.840 --> 37:48.600
They always get more complex and while it's a little more of a hassle upfront, I see the

37:48.600 --> 37:51.600
wisdom in making sure checking all these cases.

37:51.600 --> 37:55.440
Again, that's what nullables are for.

37:55.440 --> 38:03.700
So I mean unless you can think of a good counter argument, I don't know that we want to dive

38:03.700 --> 38:09.320
into the should you care about coding this way because I think the answer is yes, right?

38:09.320 --> 38:14.360
In fact, other languages are starting to adopt this and I think in two years, everybody is

38:14.360 --> 38:19.040
going to be doing something like again, what Swift calls optionals or nullables here.

38:19.040 --> 38:20.040
Yeah.

38:20.040 --> 38:21.640
I think there's a couple issues going on.

38:21.640 --> 38:27.200
One is the case of like real optionality like missing data versus an empty key versus like

38:27.200 --> 38:31.440
do we have this or do we know nothing about it and how do you handle extensibility and

38:31.440 --> 38:33.920
sort of naturally extending and growing stuff?

38:33.920 --> 38:37.640
And then there's the other case, like null seems like a special case, right?

38:37.640 --> 38:40.360
The billion dollar mistake.

38:40.360 --> 38:42.560
And I think there are styles of programming.

38:42.560 --> 38:46.480
Basically, I think one way or another, you really do need to think about it.

38:46.480 --> 38:51.440
And we talked about a little bit, one strategy is nil punning where you kind of assign stuff

38:51.440 --> 38:52.500
so that nil makes sense.

38:52.500 --> 38:56.440
So instead of getting like a null pointer exception when you try to take the head of

38:56.440 --> 39:00.740
some list that's actually nil, well, you get some reasonable value, probably nil again,

39:00.740 --> 39:02.860
but you get some reasonable value back.

39:02.860 --> 39:05.980
So that's one less static style.

39:05.980 --> 39:08.780
There's also sort of stuff where you have like lots of upfront verification and then

39:08.780 --> 39:13.100
pass stuff through or just having, you know, like not having nulls at all and figuring

39:13.100 --> 39:14.580
out how to make that work.

39:14.580 --> 39:18.400
But I think what we don't want to see is big, complicated programs like you're talking about

39:18.400 --> 39:22.620
that have maybe evolved over five, 10 years and you don't really know, right?

39:22.620 --> 39:23.620
There is no help.

39:23.620 --> 39:24.620
There's no annotations.

39:24.620 --> 39:26.880
There's nothing to tell you like what are the possible values?

39:26.880 --> 39:31.300
And when nil is, I think a huge part of the problem is that nil isn't really a value.

39:31.300 --> 39:34.700
It doesn't play in any of the interfaces that you might want it to, even if that could be

39:34.700 --> 39:35.900
implemented and make sense.

39:35.900 --> 39:39.460
So you end up with this value that just sort of like shows up and you can't work with and

39:39.460 --> 39:41.680
ends up biting you at runtime.

39:41.680 --> 39:42.680
So you're right.

39:42.680 --> 39:47.140
Like I think this is especially a good case to be like, can we account for this?

39:47.140 --> 39:52.200
Is it easy enough to just say like, sometimes this is nil, compiler, help me not to forget

39:52.200 --> 39:53.200
that.

39:53.200 --> 39:57.580
There are a couple of places where this could be nil and make sure I handle it reasonably.

39:57.580 --> 40:01.900
Where I think you have to be careful and you're kind of hitting on is there are probably types

40:01.900 --> 40:07.240
of programs or certain code bases where maybe that's overkill or there's another style that

40:07.240 --> 40:09.240
could do the same without the verbosity.

40:09.240 --> 40:13.080
Like I think we kind of get confused sometimes when we talk about programming.

40:13.080 --> 40:15.140
Not everything is an enterprise C sharp app.

40:15.140 --> 40:17.240
Some are and like you should do it that way.

40:17.240 --> 40:21.880
And there are other programs that maybe they're a script or like a small 200 line program

40:21.880 --> 40:23.840
and you don't need it.

40:23.840 --> 40:28.600
Or just like a Xamarin consumer app that you know if it crashes, it crashes, right?

40:28.600 --> 40:34.000
I would add one thing though like I'm a little sympathetic to the naysayers here if only

40:34.000 --> 40:36.000
for one reason.

40:36.000 --> 40:43.440
The last three revisions, so let's say starting at C sharp six have really changed C sharp

40:43.440 --> 40:44.440
I feel.

40:44.440 --> 40:46.040
And they've done it in an additive way.

40:46.040 --> 40:50.920
So like you could be boring and not use any of the new quote unquote cool stuff.

40:50.920 --> 40:55.720
But I think it was six, maybe it was five for the addition of lambdas.

40:55.720 --> 41:03.240
Things more of this F sharp-y functional you know, say my name, say my name, my name is

41:03.240 --> 41:07.000
Haskell kind of stuff is creeping in.

41:07.000 --> 41:13.440
And I could definitely see how you know what, I'm sympathetic because I remember when like

41:13.440 --> 41:18.960
Swift came in against Objective-C and like somebody's moving your cheese, right?

41:18.960 --> 41:21.280
You don't really like it.

41:21.280 --> 41:23.240
It's hard especially in a day-to-day productive language, right?

41:23.240 --> 41:25.880
Where you're like, oh my gosh, what are all these new abstractions I suddenly have to

41:25.880 --> 41:26.880
learn?

41:26.880 --> 41:32.120
Well, and I would say this nullable stuff is even like more in your face because like

41:32.120 --> 41:37.240
if you chose not to use like lambdas for instance, you would just not do that, right?

41:37.240 --> 41:39.920
Like totally works to do it the old way.

41:39.920 --> 41:45.920
If your boss or some hotshot on your team turns this flag on, you are going to see these

41:45.920 --> 41:49.600
warnings and you are going to have to address them.

41:49.600 --> 41:51.680
So I get it.

41:51.680 --> 41:57.760
I keep wondering like how much more stuff can Microsoft Voltron onto C sharp.

41:57.760 --> 41:58.760
Yes, right.

41:58.760 --> 42:03.680
And the answer is they see a feature in their language and they basically just go for it.

42:03.680 --> 42:05.880
So you were talking about a little bit there and you kind of alluded to it, but there's

42:05.880 --> 42:08.540
been pushback in the community, right?

42:08.540 --> 42:10.760
Like there's not everyone's happy about it.

42:10.760 --> 42:14.600
Yeah, there's been a lot of pushback.

42:14.600 --> 42:21.240
I have spent a lot of time this week or last week rather trying to read some of the account

42:21.240 --> 42:22.240
arguments.

42:22.240 --> 42:24.440
I was really trying to find one that I thought was like good, like a good blog post.

42:24.440 --> 42:31.360
I didn't find any that I found particularly compelling.

42:31.360 --> 42:35.280
I think some of them were just like, I'm mad because I don't like change, right?

42:35.280 --> 42:36.280
Like that's bad.

42:36.280 --> 42:37.280
You're always going to have that.

42:37.280 --> 42:38.280
Yeah.

42:38.280 --> 42:39.280
Right.

42:39.280 --> 42:40.280
I think that's a stupid argument.

42:40.280 --> 42:47.000
One I did find that was interesting was like C sharp was meant to be a better Java, a OO

42:47.000 --> 42:51.000
language and now we're bolting on all this functional programming stuff to it.

42:51.000 --> 42:56.320
I actually think that that's still not a great argument, but I see where it comes from.

42:56.320 --> 43:00.280
It comes from like an idea of like, you know what, Haskell is a functional programming

43:00.280 --> 43:04.600
language and Haskell is what it is, right?

43:04.600 --> 43:10.440
So if you wanted a pure OO language, you could just use Ruby.

43:10.440 --> 43:11.440
You sure could.

43:11.440 --> 43:12.440
You sure could.

43:12.440 --> 43:13.440
I'm just telling you.

43:13.440 --> 43:14.440
Everything is an object.

43:14.440 --> 43:15.440
It's great.

43:15.440 --> 43:21.080
I don't even know how to say this, but emotionally I get it.

43:21.080 --> 43:26.840
I understand that argument, but intellectually from an engineering perspective, I actually

43:26.840 --> 43:29.840
still think it's stupid and stupid in the nicest way possible, right?

43:29.840 --> 43:38.880
Like it's C sharp is one of these languages that I think in our entire industry, C sharp

43:38.880 --> 43:40.480
actually has a unique place.

43:40.480 --> 43:41.480
Oh yeah.

43:41.480 --> 43:44.560
Go into that a little bit more because what keeps coming into my mind and they're both

43:44.560 --> 43:48.400
very different, but like obviously the closest thing is Java, which has also evolved with

43:48.400 --> 43:52.040
Lambdas and streams and all that and then at the same time, another language that keeps

43:52.040 --> 43:55.520
evolving and growing things is JavaScript.

43:55.520 --> 43:58.660
So where does C sharp fall in all this?

43:58.660 --> 44:04.960
So in my mind, C sharp is being asked if we just like, let's just think about it for a

44:04.960 --> 44:05.960
minute.

44:05.960 --> 44:10.400
High quality desktop applications for professionals, games, right?

44:10.400 --> 44:13.480
Via Unity, mono game, all that fun stuff.

44:13.480 --> 44:19.440
You know, enterprise software, web applications via ASP.net and.NET Core and all that, an

44:19.440 --> 44:26.920
entire like pantheon of Microsoft web technologies, embedded via.NET, embedded via Microsoft

44:26.920 --> 44:34.280
or what is it now called, Azure IoT, Windows embedded, Windows C, like there is a million

44:34.280 --> 44:35.280
domains.

44:35.280 --> 44:41.340
Like you can really program an Arduino board in C sharp and you can also write like a little,

44:41.340 --> 44:43.800
you know, flashlight app for iOS.

44:43.800 --> 44:47.600
So again, mobile would be another universal.

44:47.600 --> 44:48.600
Absolutely.

44:48.600 --> 44:54.760
And what I think is happening is that you know what?

44:54.760 --> 45:00.280
If I had to be stranded on a desert island and only know one programming language, it

45:00.280 --> 45:04.080
would not be crazy for that language to be C sharp because you can basically do everything

45:04.080 --> 45:07.960
if you know the APIs and the frameworks.

45:07.960 --> 45:12.800
But you're asking a lot of one language.

45:12.800 --> 45:13.800
I see what you're saying.

45:13.800 --> 45:16.800
There's sort of a, there's a trade off here of like, okay, well C sharp has been great

45:16.800 --> 45:21.000
and lots of good software and bad, but lots of good software has been developed with it.

45:21.000 --> 45:25.960
Is the legacy of having that worth trying to graph this stuff versus like everyone just

45:25.960 --> 45:29.600
moved to F sharp or Swift or whatever, you know, new language that kind of takes that

45:29.600 --> 45:32.880
place that's learned from all these things.

45:32.880 --> 45:35.960
What's funny is like our industry hasn't actually been around that long.

45:35.960 --> 45:39.020
You know, if you think about like whenever the fifties and we, so we've only been through

45:39.020 --> 45:40.560
a couple of these cycles.

45:40.560 --> 45:41.960
I don't think we really know what it means.

45:41.960 --> 45:46.580
Like Java, maybe in one universe someone would have expected to have faded away, but no,

45:46.580 --> 45:48.880
it's continued and it's changed and it's grafted.

45:48.880 --> 45:52.480
So by and large still runs the old stuff.

45:52.480 --> 45:53.480
Yeah.

45:53.480 --> 45:57.560
I mean, it's, I mean, Java is another weird case.

45:57.560 --> 46:01.760
I think, I think Java actually should have been where C sharp is, but because of weird

46:01.760 --> 46:02.760
Oracle stuff.

46:02.760 --> 46:03.760
Right.

46:03.760 --> 46:04.760
Yeah.

46:04.760 --> 46:05.760
Oh boy.

46:05.760 --> 46:06.760
Right.

46:06.760 --> 46:07.760
So we just ignore that.

46:07.760 --> 46:08.760
Like I think about Ruby a little bit here, right?

46:08.760 --> 46:16.340
Where it is theoretically possible for me to program an IOT board in Ruby, right?

46:16.340 --> 46:19.480
Like there are libraries that will let me do that.

46:19.480 --> 46:23.560
I can certainly, and I have written my, my, some of my utility scripts for like just like

46:23.560 --> 46:25.760
day-to-day stuff are in Ruby.

46:25.760 --> 46:26.760
Same.

46:26.760 --> 46:31.080
That's not the optimal use for Ruby, right?

46:31.080 --> 46:36.100
And no one's claiming that Ruby should be this, you know, one size fits all programming

46:36.100 --> 46:37.760
language for a million different things, right?

46:37.760 --> 46:44.520
For mobile apps to, you know, AAA games where C sharp, Microsoft is actually trying to do

46:44.520 --> 46:45.520
that, right?

46:45.520 --> 46:47.200
This is the one language to rule them all.

46:47.200 --> 46:48.200
Yeah, you're right.

46:48.200 --> 46:51.520
I mean, cause it does kind of like, it plays, especially with some of the, like the link

46:51.520 --> 46:55.200
stuff, you can kind of write like high level data pipeline processing, but at the same

46:55.200 --> 46:57.680
time,.NET is a surprisingly static runtime environment.

46:57.680 --> 47:01.700
So you can have, you know, like a pretty lean low latency GC that you're running with.

47:01.700 --> 47:03.400
You can run in small environments.

47:03.400 --> 47:07.120
Well, and there's all kinds of adapters for lower level stuff, right?

47:07.120 --> 47:10.320
I mean, if you really want to get really into the dark side, you can call into the old windows

47:10.320 --> 47:11.320
com.

47:11.320 --> 47:12.320
Oh, is that?

47:12.320 --> 47:13.320
Oh man.

47:13.320 --> 47:14.320
Wow.

47:14.320 --> 47:15.320
Yeah.

47:15.320 --> 47:19.280
I mean, the way you would do that is several showers after I'm pretty sure you just cry

47:19.280 --> 47:20.280
yourself asleep.

47:20.280 --> 47:21.280
It's fine.

47:21.280 --> 47:22.280
Right.

47:22.280 --> 47:23.280
The tears, they're cleansing, cleansing.

47:23.280 --> 47:27.360
I don't know how we got to the com API thing.

47:27.360 --> 47:28.360
I think we hit a wall.

47:28.360 --> 47:29.360
I think so.

47:29.360 --> 47:30.360
Yeah.

47:30.360 --> 47:31.480
I mean, I'm glad to hear that you're for it.

47:31.480 --> 47:34.760
I mean, it's kind of also reminds me of some of the transitions shops went through with

47:34.760 --> 47:40.080
like deploying Scala, um, in like Java shops where you could kind of use it as like a,

47:40.080 --> 47:43.040
you know, just a better, a better Java with some fancy stuff.

47:43.040 --> 47:46.720
But then you have some people maybe on your team that really go off the deep end and explore

47:46.720 --> 47:51.120
cats or other, you know, other super functional libraries doing lenses and getting super Haskell

47:51.120 --> 47:52.120
about it.

47:52.120 --> 47:56.240
And it does seem like in a team environment where both of those languages shine, you have

47:56.240 --> 47:59.280
to be, you have to be really aware of, you know, what are, what are the standards other

47:59.280 --> 48:03.800
people are going to reasonably be able to use and learn and where's the, where's the

48:03.800 --> 48:07.000
curve change on the value to safety sort of thing, right?

48:07.000 --> 48:10.280
Cause you do want safe apps, you want safe code, but especially in a business environment

48:10.280 --> 48:14.320
at the end of the day, like it's got to be safe enough to work reasonably well.

48:14.320 --> 48:16.280
Perfect ends up never shipping.

48:16.280 --> 48:17.280
Yeah.

48:17.280 --> 48:22.800
It'll be interesting to follow this is in rust and it automatically ships.

48:22.800 --> 48:23.800
Right.

48:23.800 --> 48:24.800
Yeah, exactly.

48:24.800 --> 48:25.800
Once it compiles, you just, you just ship it and it's, it's done.

48:25.800 --> 48:27.000
You know, it's perfect.

48:27.000 --> 48:29.600
If it compile, listen, if it compiles, it's perfect.

48:29.600 --> 48:30.600
Isn't that the rust model?

48:30.600 --> 48:31.600
I believe so.

48:31.600 --> 48:32.600
Haskell, Haskell as well.

48:32.600 --> 48:33.600
Yeah.

48:33.600 --> 48:34.600
Right.

48:34.600 --> 48:37.080
And if it compiles, the compiler has got your back so you don't have to worry about it.

48:37.080 --> 48:38.080
That's right.

48:38.080 --> 48:39.080
Uh, well this'll be fascinating.

48:39.080 --> 48:43.800
And I like, I mean, it seems like the, the industry can't help but continue to be pulled

48:43.800 --> 48:47.160
in this direction, both from the dynamic and the static side.

48:47.160 --> 48:50.120
We're exploring more of this stuff and where does it end?

48:50.120 --> 48:51.120
Where does it stop?

48:51.120 --> 48:56.280
I guess I'll just have to keep listening to Coder radio to find out.

48:56.280 --> 49:01.280
It's easy to do though, because you just head on over to coder.show, go to slash three 43

49:01.280 --> 49:02.600
if you want to find this episode.

49:02.600 --> 49:07.760
Otherwise you can find our entire backlog, head on over to Jupiter broadcasting.com to

49:07.760 --> 49:09.960
check out all the stuff that we've got.

49:09.960 --> 49:11.640
You can find ways to contact us there.

49:11.640 --> 49:16.840
You can also check out the calendar to find out when we're live and go find all the wonderful

49:16.840 --> 49:21.960
other Jupiter broadcasting shows like Linux action news and choose Linux.

49:21.960 --> 49:25.080
If you want more of me, well you can find that on the tech snap program.

49:25.080 --> 49:27.680
We've just got our second episode with the new co-host Jim.

49:27.680 --> 49:30.920
So go check that out if you want to get some clarification about what's happening over

49:30.920 --> 49:34.880
in the world of open ZFS and Linux and you can find me on Twitter.

49:34.880 --> 49:35.880
I'm at Westpane.

49:35.880 --> 49:38.320
Mike, I believe you're there too.

49:38.320 --> 49:40.880
Yep, at Jim Monoco on Twitter.

49:40.880 --> 49:41.880
Beautiful.

49:41.880 --> 50:09.960
Thank you everyone for joining us and we'll see you next week.
