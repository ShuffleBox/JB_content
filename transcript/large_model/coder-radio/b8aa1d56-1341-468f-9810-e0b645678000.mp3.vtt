00:00.000 --> 00:15.760
This is KOTOR Radio, episode 453 for February 14th, 2022.

00:15.760 --> 00:20.200
Hello everyone and welcome into Jupiter Broadcasting's weekly talk show, taking a pragmatic look

00:20.200 --> 00:24.420
at the art and the business of software development and the world of technology.

00:24.420 --> 00:29.960
My name is Chris and joining me with a gold podcasting mic, it's our host, Mr. Dominic.

00:29.960 --> 00:30.960
Hello, Mike.

00:30.960 --> 00:32.720
Hello, Chris.

00:32.720 --> 00:35.920
How are you today in beautiful Kyiv?

00:35.920 --> 00:37.240
I like to call it Kiev.

00:37.240 --> 00:38.640
I'm old school about that.

00:38.640 --> 00:40.240
Well, there's two pronunciations.

00:40.240 --> 00:44.640
Something I learned in the breathless coverage in the wonderful Morning Joe show this morning.

00:44.640 --> 00:45.640
Yeah, man.

00:45.640 --> 00:46.640
You know what?

00:46.640 --> 00:49.040
I've actually decided to just turn off the news for the next couple of days.

00:49.040 --> 00:50.320
I'm taking like a news diet.

00:50.320 --> 00:51.320
I can't.

00:51.320 --> 00:55.200
The love of my life, Victoria Nuland, started me on this path.

00:55.200 --> 00:56.560
Yeah, you got to make sure.

00:56.560 --> 00:58.360
And I'm really just trying to glue this thing, Chris.

00:58.360 --> 00:59.360
That's all I'm trying to do.

00:59.360 --> 01:00.800
I'm trying to glue it.

01:00.800 --> 01:01.800
That would be great.

01:01.800 --> 01:02.800
We could just glue this thing.

01:02.800 --> 01:03.800
That would be great.

01:03.800 --> 01:07.280
I think it's going to be a pretty fun, you know, for her, it's going to be a pretty fun

01:07.280 --> 01:08.280
experience.

01:08.280 --> 01:09.280
She's going to hand out sandwiches again.

01:09.280 --> 01:10.280
She's going to be great.

01:10.280 --> 01:11.280
So don't you worry about her.

01:11.280 --> 01:12.760
I think she's going to be like, told you so.

01:12.760 --> 01:17.680
It's the Pacific Northwest that is in absolute chaos.

01:17.680 --> 01:23.520
And if I wanted to take a news diet and I was a Mazda driver, I would have zero choice.

01:23.520 --> 01:29.280
But to listen to the news every moment I was in my car as news of this scandal made it

01:29.280 --> 01:30.280
to your shores.

01:30.280 --> 01:31.280
No.

01:31.280 --> 01:32.280
What's this?

01:32.280 --> 01:33.280
What scandal?

01:33.280 --> 01:37.080
A brilliant software bug has struck some Mazda drivers in the Seattle area.

01:37.080 --> 01:38.080
Oh, yeah.

01:38.080 --> 01:40.840
That listen to our local NPR affiliate.

01:40.840 --> 01:45.240
Now their head units are locked into that NPR affiliate.

01:45.240 --> 01:46.240
No matter what they do.

01:46.240 --> 01:47.240
They can't.

01:47.240 --> 01:53.080
This infotainment system doesn't boot up enough for them to turn it off, to change it to a

01:53.080 --> 01:56.040
different channel or even see their backup camera.

01:56.040 --> 01:58.000
It is always playing NPR.

01:58.000 --> 02:04.720
This programming is possible thanks to listeners like you, whether you like it or not.

02:04.720 --> 02:06.400
You're listening to NPR.

02:06.400 --> 02:07.800
You're done.

02:07.800 --> 02:09.280
Welcome to the quiet storm.

02:09.280 --> 02:10.280
Yes.

02:10.280 --> 02:13.220
Now, initially the response was now Mazda is going to take care of people, but initially

02:13.220 --> 02:18.040
the response was you're going to have to go schedule it with a vendor with a service repair

02:18.040 --> 02:20.920
area and you're going to have to spend fifty hundred dollars on a new head unit because

02:20.920 --> 02:23.480
there's no way we can fix this problem.

02:23.480 --> 02:25.400
We just have to replace the whole head unit.

02:25.400 --> 02:27.720
Can you guess what kind of software bug?

02:27.720 --> 02:30.000
What could have conceivably caused this?

02:30.000 --> 02:31.840
The initial speculation was 5G.

02:31.840 --> 02:33.320
I'm not kidding.

02:33.320 --> 02:40.800
OK, so so the bug is I'm in my Mazda as one is and I am being tormented.

02:40.800 --> 02:43.720
Now did I have to tune to the NPR station myself?

02:43.720 --> 02:44.720
Yes.

02:44.720 --> 02:45.720
Yeah.

02:45.720 --> 02:48.520
You you had to be a listener originally for this bug to occur.

02:48.520 --> 02:50.000
This sounds like a really funny hack.

02:50.000 --> 02:51.480
Are we sure this is a bug?

02:51.480 --> 02:53.640
It is a bug, but it's a ridiculous bug.

02:53.640 --> 02:55.040
OK, don't let me tell you.

02:55.040 --> 02:56.040
I'll just tell you.

02:56.040 --> 02:57.040
You're never going to guess it.

02:57.040 --> 03:01.960
Of course, the radio station uses this third party intermediary company.

03:01.960 --> 03:02.960
Oh, God.

03:02.960 --> 03:05.600
That supplies metadata to the radio.

03:05.600 --> 03:10.000
You know, the radio head units that show the channel name and the song you're listening

03:10.000 --> 03:11.000
to.

03:11.000 --> 03:12.000
Yeah.

03:12.000 --> 03:13.000
Like the guy's picture or the girl's picture.

03:13.000 --> 03:14.000
Sure.

03:14.000 --> 03:15.320
Apparently, yeah, they can do pictures now.

03:15.320 --> 03:19.720
And this third party company included a JPEG that didn't have the file extension.

03:19.720 --> 03:20.720
Yes.

03:20.720 --> 03:21.720
Yeah.

03:21.720 --> 03:24.280
And that broke the head units forever.

03:24.280 --> 03:30.080
I think that's the best.

03:30.080 --> 03:34.440
I feel bad because it sounds super frustrating actually driving around for a few weeks with

03:34.440 --> 03:37.080
like no control over your radio.

03:37.080 --> 03:39.160
I don't think I'd drive the car.

03:39.160 --> 03:43.800
So I'm just wondering what kind of system this Mazda head unit must be.

03:43.800 --> 03:46.840
A lot of those head units are actually what is like Q and X.

03:46.840 --> 03:47.840
Are you thinking of Q and X?

03:47.840 --> 03:48.840
Q and X.

03:48.840 --> 03:49.840
Thank you.

03:49.840 --> 03:50.840
Was to say it's the cute thing, right?

03:50.840 --> 03:51.840
Yeah.

03:51.840 --> 03:54.760
The Q and X systems don't give a crap about file extensions.

03:54.760 --> 03:57.960
I mean, it helps, but I've done it.

03:57.960 --> 03:58.960
You shouldn't do it.

03:58.960 --> 04:00.280
It's such an edge case.

04:00.280 --> 04:04.760
You can kind of understand why they wouldn't test for it, although you can understand why

04:04.760 --> 04:07.920
they should, but why maybe they didn't think of it.

04:07.920 --> 04:09.720
I think it's just perfect that it's NPR.

04:09.720 --> 04:12.440
I know.

04:12.440 --> 04:16.320
It's like probably the most chill, frustrating radio station you could probably listen to.

04:16.320 --> 04:18.800
Because if, you know, say you want some music that day or nothing.

04:18.800 --> 04:23.560
You have a long trip with like a little kid and the poor little guy's got to listen to

04:23.560 --> 04:26.840
like, today we have him on Quiet Storm.

04:26.840 --> 04:28.320
And all the Bluetooth was dead.

04:28.320 --> 04:29.980
Like you couldn't play anything from your phone.

04:29.980 --> 04:31.220
Your phone call stuff wouldn't work.

04:31.220 --> 04:32.760
I'm assuming you're just locked.

04:32.760 --> 04:34.240
Like you can't plug in an iPhone.

04:34.240 --> 04:35.240
Yeah.

04:35.240 --> 04:36.240
You're just done.

04:36.240 --> 04:37.240
Yep.

04:37.240 --> 04:41.500
Daddy, can I listen to the Wreck It Ralph song, which is called Sugar Rush and is burned

04:41.500 --> 04:43.640
into my very soul?

04:43.640 --> 04:46.600
No, no, you cannot, my boy.

04:46.600 --> 04:53.080
You're apparently listening to this book review about some lady growing turnips.

04:53.080 --> 04:56.680
Or you know, the Ukraine, which perhaps you're trying to take a little bit of time from right

04:56.680 --> 04:57.680
now.

04:57.680 --> 04:58.680
Me?

04:58.680 --> 04:59.680
No, no.

04:59.680 --> 05:01.300
So the Super Bowl was last night.

05:01.300 --> 05:03.120
Very important to a lot of people.

05:03.120 --> 05:07.240
I was rooting for the Bengals, Los Angeles one, saving me roughly eighteen hundred dollars.

05:07.240 --> 05:09.960
I was going to buy a System 76 of the Bengals one.

05:09.960 --> 05:10.960
I saw that.

05:10.960 --> 05:11.960
That's hilarious.

05:11.960 --> 05:12.960
That's great.

05:12.960 --> 05:16.560
Because my son was mocking me for using a MacBook Air, which I find out, Chris, how

05:16.560 --> 05:20.080
he got a premium fee to J.B.

05:20.080 --> 05:21.720
We're going to have a little talk.

05:21.720 --> 05:24.040
Let's just say we took care of him.

05:24.040 --> 05:25.040
Yeah.

05:25.040 --> 05:26.640
Oh, he's already like, where's your cool computer?

05:26.640 --> 05:28.920
Like, dude, you're five.

05:28.920 --> 05:29.920
God.

05:29.920 --> 05:34.600
He's like, well, OK, you know, I was on Matrix this morning talking like, stop it, kid.

05:34.600 --> 05:35.600
What are you doing?

05:35.600 --> 05:36.600
No.

05:36.600 --> 05:43.560
And that was an exciting game if you're a sports fan, but there is no greater game.

05:43.560 --> 05:45.720
I call it Newland ball.

05:45.720 --> 05:48.540
I am so in on this Ukraine stuff.

05:48.540 --> 05:49.540
Are you?

05:49.540 --> 05:54.480
I have not been this excited about the news since an orange man descended.

05:54.480 --> 05:57.200
What is it about it that has you so gripped?

05:57.200 --> 05:59.200
I do notice that they're talking about it an awful lot.

05:59.200 --> 06:00.680
Well, I'll tell you what it is about it.

06:00.680 --> 06:01.680
There's two things.

06:01.680 --> 06:05.600
One, any time Joe Scarborough gets on his gets the vapors, I think it's funny.

06:05.600 --> 06:06.960
I actually like Joe Scarborough.

06:06.960 --> 06:07.960
Yeah.

06:07.960 --> 06:10.160
You guys are both fake conservatives.

06:10.160 --> 06:13.360
Oh, damn.

06:13.360 --> 06:19.720
The worst part is the second time I was called a rhino today, weirdly enough, by my ex-mother-in-law.

06:19.720 --> 06:20.720
You totally derailed me.

06:20.720 --> 06:21.720
That was amazing.

06:21.720 --> 06:22.720
You know what?

06:22.720 --> 06:27.080
They have to put you on Fox News to just go after the apparently my people.

06:27.080 --> 06:30.360
I just I just I'm impressed that you're so captivated by it, because I would imagine

06:30.360 --> 06:32.720
a lot of us are just like, I mean, maybe I'm wrong.

06:32.720 --> 06:33.720
All right.

06:33.720 --> 06:34.720
So you know what the difference is?

06:34.720 --> 06:38.440
You can see I'm not to cut you off, but just answer your question.

06:38.440 --> 06:42.800
You can actually if you go back far enough to that beautiful phone call and even a little

06:42.800 --> 06:44.160
before.

06:44.160 --> 06:48.880
This is like watching the play, but being able to see behind the scenes to behind the

06:48.880 --> 06:51.000
stage to there is that element.

06:51.000 --> 06:55.560
And it's like watching something that's been playing out for for a while kind of come to

06:55.560 --> 06:56.560
a head.

06:56.560 --> 06:57.560
I agree.

06:57.560 --> 07:00.720
I have just felt like because there's nothing I can do about it.

07:00.720 --> 07:05.680
And I don't really know how it's going to directly affect me either way.

07:05.680 --> 07:09.800
I just sort of just I'm just going to wait for something to happen and then pay attention.

07:09.800 --> 07:11.800
I think I'm not sure.

07:11.800 --> 07:13.640
I waffle on it.

07:13.640 --> 07:15.480
I mostly just try to stay focused on work.

07:15.480 --> 07:18.920
But every now and then I think about it, it freaks me out.

07:18.920 --> 07:20.840
It's never going to be World War Three.

07:20.840 --> 07:25.960
Not not for not no offense or Ukrainian listeners, but not over Ukraine.

07:25.960 --> 07:26.960
Sorry, guys.

07:26.960 --> 07:27.960
Yeah.

07:27.960 --> 07:28.960
All right.

07:28.960 --> 07:29.960
Well, let's get to the emails.

07:29.960 --> 07:33.200
Casey from Austria asks about the maintenance dance.

07:33.200 --> 07:38.040
He says so at the mad botter, how do you structure ongoing maintenance for your client project?

07:38.040 --> 07:42.880
Care is rarely finished, and even if it's feature complete and the bugs are squashed,

07:42.880 --> 07:45.640
often there'll be ongoing costs for hosting backups, etc.

07:45.640 --> 07:48.360
I've been self-employed as a software engineer for over a decade.

07:48.360 --> 07:52.760
I've been relatively lucky that my clients usually have some kind of sysadmin or ops

07:52.760 --> 07:55.560
team that could handle these ongoing costs.

07:55.560 --> 08:02.000
However, recently I found my client base shifting to clients who don't really have the capacity

08:02.000 --> 08:04.160
to manage the hosting themselves.

08:04.160 --> 08:07.340
So I'm in a situation where I need to have a solid story for how I take care of the client

08:07.340 --> 08:10.240
after the main engagement wraps up.

08:10.240 --> 08:11.720
Do you sell retainer contracts?

08:11.720 --> 08:16.800
Are those based on hours or something else like do you sell fixed hosted plans?

08:16.800 --> 08:18.060
What would they include?

08:18.060 --> 08:21.640
Any horror stories to share or any tips to pass along would be great, too.

08:21.640 --> 08:23.900
Thanks and cheers from Austria.

08:23.900 --> 08:24.900
That's a lot.

08:24.900 --> 08:25.900
There's a lot in there.

08:25.900 --> 08:31.560
Yeah, I do try to sell maintenance contracts and I almost never succeed because in truth,

08:31.560 --> 08:32.560
it's my experience.

08:32.560 --> 08:36.520
People willing to buy maintenance contracts usually want additional development, too,

08:36.520 --> 08:41.480
when you end up spending a lot of time separating maintenance from development.

08:41.480 --> 08:47.520
So yeah, we just do it, you know, as applications change over time and that requires, well,

08:47.520 --> 08:50.520
changes that's poorly put.

08:50.520 --> 08:55.680
For Alice, it's a license for a year, right?

08:55.680 --> 09:02.240
Basically it's not really assessed, but it's getting there every day, closer and closer.

09:02.240 --> 09:06.680
And just, yeah, the ongoing maintenance is part of that license fee.

09:06.680 --> 09:11.200
And that's probably the closest to a pure, but part of the conditions of that are like

09:11.200 --> 09:15.480
we spin up the instance, we control it, you keep your grubby hands off.

09:15.480 --> 09:21.280
I kind of do get the impression from his email that he's getting asked the question because

09:21.280 --> 09:25.920
he says, I need to have a solid story for how I take care of the client after main engagement

09:25.920 --> 09:26.920
wraps up.

09:26.920 --> 09:27.920
So maybe he is getting asked.

09:27.920 --> 09:31.920
So it seems like maybe having a maintenance option is a good idea, but I don't know if

09:31.920 --> 09:35.080
you need to leave the initial sale or any of that with, with that.

09:35.080 --> 09:41.120
The thing that becomes complex is deciding what is a maintenance quote, you know, issue

09:41.120 --> 09:45.440
that you just fixed for that flat fee and what is effectively a modification.

09:45.440 --> 09:48.960
So if I were to do that, I would probably just say you buy it like a lawyer, right?

09:48.960 --> 09:50.000
You buy or retain for hours.

09:50.000 --> 09:52.000
I've done that in the past.

09:52.000 --> 09:53.240
It's fine.

09:53.240 --> 09:55.840
That's definitely approached like by a four hour package.

09:55.840 --> 09:57.340
It kind of depends on what you're maintaining.

09:57.340 --> 10:01.480
If you're maintaining server infrastructure for them, that might be a little more straight

10:01.480 --> 10:03.800
forward, you know, cause Mike's right.

10:03.800 --> 10:08.180
If you're maintaining code, doing maintenance updates or fixing things or adding support

10:08.180 --> 10:12.360
for new importers or something like that, that's a whole different cost structure versus

10:12.360 --> 10:17.200
running a VPS that your sub license leasing to them or a system that you have in a data

10:17.200 --> 10:18.200
center.

10:18.200 --> 10:21.620
And then there that's pretty straightforward to figure out the cost for that.

10:21.620 --> 10:23.880
You just look at your costs.

10:23.880 --> 10:24.880
That almost sells itself.

10:24.880 --> 10:25.880
If that's what they're looking for.

10:25.880 --> 10:26.880
Yeah.

10:26.880 --> 10:29.420
I mean, if it's something you control, then you should know your costs and you just do

10:29.420 --> 10:31.600
some number greater than that.

10:31.600 --> 10:34.280
That makes sense to make it worth it for you, right?

10:34.280 --> 10:38.720
If it's just like pure custom dev where they're going to end up hosting it themselves and

10:38.720 --> 10:43.140
like there are some admin on their side that is, you know, gets to pick what he or she

10:43.140 --> 10:45.960
wants and how they want to go on.

10:45.960 --> 10:46.960
That's a little trickier, right?

10:46.960 --> 10:53.480
You know, the more uniform your systems are, the presumably right, one hopes the more efficient

10:53.480 --> 10:54.880
you are at maintaining it.

10:54.880 --> 10:55.880
All right.

10:55.880 --> 10:57.600
Listener Mike is freaking out.

10:57.600 --> 11:01.760
This is OK, I was listening to you guys talk about VR recently that was beyond gaming,

11:01.760 --> 11:03.600
which is the first time I really thought about that much.

11:03.600 --> 11:08.840
And then I recently had an experience at a friend's house with an Oculus 2 and I was

11:08.840 --> 11:11.200
pretty impressed with how far it's come.

11:11.200 --> 11:16.040
Then when I heard you guys talking about virtual meetings and maybe even using VR on the plane,

11:16.040 --> 11:18.680
it really clicked for me and my mind was blown.

11:18.680 --> 11:22.200
At the risk of sounding like the dad in the room, though, are you guys at all worried

11:22.200 --> 11:25.200
about the possible addictive nature of VR?

11:25.200 --> 11:30.720
The small amount of VR I did was so immersive, it was so honestly disorienting to come out

11:30.720 --> 11:31.720
of it.

11:31.720 --> 11:35.240
Well, I'm old enough to remember a world before smartphones and now we're all just seemingly

11:35.240 --> 11:36.960
hopelessly addicted to them.

11:36.960 --> 11:38.880
So what's VR going to do?

11:38.880 --> 11:43.560
I'm reminded of Jeff Goldblum's quote in Jurassic Park where he says, your scientists were so

11:43.560 --> 11:49.320
preoccupied with whether they could, they didn't stop to think if they should.

11:49.320 --> 11:50.320
What are your thoughts?

11:50.320 --> 11:51.320
Yeah.

11:51.320 --> 11:56.840
I mean, if you've ever read your William Gibson, this is a problem, right?

11:56.840 --> 11:58.640
I don't even think it's a possibility.

11:58.640 --> 12:02.720
I think it's a certainty once it gets good enough, if it gets good enough.

12:02.720 --> 12:06.400
And we know this because people get addicted to things like World of Warcraft.

12:06.400 --> 12:07.400
Oh, for sure.

12:07.400 --> 12:08.400
Yeah.

12:08.400 --> 12:09.400
Yeah.

12:09.400 --> 12:13.540
So I think this is in a lot of ways, I just not even an opinion.

12:13.540 --> 12:15.200
This is absolutely true, right?

12:15.200 --> 12:19.640
People Robin Hood, the, for those who don't know the, what would you, I would call it

12:19.640 --> 12:21.640
a gambling app, but I don't feel like getting sued.

12:21.640 --> 12:23.200
So we'll call it an investment app.

12:23.200 --> 12:24.200
Yeah.

12:24.200 --> 12:25.200
Stocks for retail investors.

12:25.200 --> 12:27.920
You know, there was a couple of young men who destroyed their lives.

12:27.920 --> 12:31.640
One young man killed himself because it is addictive, right?

12:31.640 --> 12:32.640
Yeah.

12:32.640 --> 12:37.560
So, you know, we have a casino not too far from the studio and I have gone in there with

12:37.560 --> 12:43.280
friends on occasion and I see people who are basically just sitting there rotting away

12:43.280 --> 12:44.840
on those slot machines.

12:44.840 --> 12:45.840
Yeah.

12:45.840 --> 12:47.600
It's definitely a bad, it's a bad human behavior.

12:47.600 --> 12:48.900
I mean, just think about it.

12:48.900 --> 12:53.760
Think about like an MMO in like an Oculus five, right?

12:53.760 --> 12:59.960
Like a really souped up, you know, few generations out and you feel like you're, you know, a

12:59.960 --> 13:00.960
wizard or whatever.

13:00.960 --> 13:01.960
Flying.

13:01.960 --> 13:02.960
Oh God.

13:02.960 --> 13:03.960
How cool would it be to fly around an open world?

13:03.960 --> 13:04.960
Yeah.

13:04.960 --> 13:10.420
I mean, I, I have a buddy who has a, a home built a flight simulator that is annoyingly

13:10.420 --> 13:13.760
better than mine and I can't wait to get over it.

13:13.760 --> 13:14.760
Yeah.

13:14.760 --> 13:15.760
Yeah.

13:15.760 --> 13:18.040
I was just talking to my buddy Alex about using flight Sim and VR cause he just got

13:18.040 --> 13:21.420
a VR kit and he says it's just, it's blow away good.

13:21.420 --> 13:25.280
Like he flew over a campground that he stayed in as a kid and he could recognize it in the

13:25.280 --> 13:26.280
flight Sim.

13:26.280 --> 13:27.280
I agree.

13:27.280 --> 13:28.640
All these are things are problems.

13:28.640 --> 13:31.120
I don't really see what VR is changing about it.

13:31.120 --> 13:36.880
Like I'm sitting in front of screens, one, two, three, four, five screens right now and

13:36.880 --> 13:41.560
I sat in front of four screens all morning while we worked on things this morning.

13:41.560 --> 13:48.600
So like I already spend probably 10 hours a day in front of a screen and then sometimes

13:48.600 --> 13:51.560
after I'm done with dinner and whatnot, I sit down, I turn the TV on and I watch TV

13:51.560 --> 13:52.560
for a bit too.

13:52.560 --> 13:55.560
So I'm already living that world.

13:55.560 --> 14:00.980
I'm just doing it with a crappier resolution and a crappier experience, right?

14:00.980 --> 14:04.080
And at least with VR, there's going to be things that get me up and moving where right

14:04.080 --> 14:09.120
now all of it's done on my butt unless I electively choose to stand there and stare at a screen.

14:09.120 --> 14:13.200
So I actually think in some ways VR is going to improve the situation because some of those

14:13.200 --> 14:16.040
games are actually quite a workout.

14:16.040 --> 14:18.560
And so there's, you know, there may be a positive aspect to it.

14:18.560 --> 14:20.800
Yeah, there's going to be a lot of negatives to the right.

14:20.800 --> 14:22.600
Think about the adult industry.

14:22.600 --> 14:26.160
I mean, we've all seen the next generation Star Trek, right?

14:26.160 --> 14:28.960
How many episodes are there about some poor bastard?

14:28.960 --> 14:29.960
Barkley.

14:29.960 --> 14:30.960
Right.

14:30.960 --> 14:31.960
Just like in the holodeck.

14:31.960 --> 14:32.960
He can't get it.

14:32.960 --> 14:35.080
He's just like so hooked on it.

14:35.080 --> 14:37.100
I mean, yeah, I suppose.

14:37.100 --> 14:38.960
But the real thing's always going to be better, right?

14:38.960 --> 14:43.360
Like you're always going to have a better experience eating a great meal in the real

14:43.360 --> 14:46.120
world or sex or meeting somebody.

14:46.120 --> 14:50.500
Like the real world thing is always going to probably because it's a touch and feel

14:50.500 --> 14:51.500
thing as well.

14:51.500 --> 14:52.500
I don't know.

14:52.500 --> 14:55.600
You know, the more I think about it, the more I think it's really just going to be as bad

14:55.600 --> 14:56.600
as it is now.

14:56.600 --> 14:57.600
I really don't.

14:57.600 --> 15:00.400
I mean, it's just going to look dorkier because we're going to have these things on our head.

15:00.400 --> 15:01.400
Don't worry.

15:01.400 --> 15:04.900
Multi-billion dollar corporations have for a very long time been working on addicting

15:04.900 --> 15:07.780
you and screwing with your dopamine already got you.

15:07.780 --> 15:11.260
Have you heard of Van Heuser Bush or, you know, all the cigarette companies?

15:11.260 --> 15:13.540
I'm just saying lots of things were addictive.

15:13.540 --> 15:16.600
So Dinesh writes in looking for some wisdom.

15:16.600 --> 15:17.600
He says, Hello, guys.

15:17.600 --> 15:21.320
A regular listener of the show here over the past few weeks, I've been enjoying hearing

15:21.320 --> 15:24.780
about Mike's experience with Python being a Python developer myself.

15:24.780 --> 15:27.720
It's always interesting to see people speak the serpent language.

15:27.720 --> 15:33.240
However, one thing's got me thinking, given Mike's experience with a few different languages,

15:33.240 --> 15:37.560
is there a template or process which has followed that I think it means you follow to make

15:37.560 --> 15:41.160
decisions about the tech to use for a specific project?

15:41.160 --> 15:44.880
Or is it just about trying out new things and, hey, maybe there's a chance it works?

15:44.880 --> 15:48.400
I'm curious to know about the architecture choices and how they're made.

15:48.400 --> 15:49.400
Thanks for the great content.

15:49.400 --> 15:50.400
Cheers.

15:50.400 --> 15:51.400
Yeah.

15:51.400 --> 15:52.440
So it is not just about trying new things.

15:52.440 --> 15:56.040
That's the easiest one to start with.

15:56.040 --> 16:02.160
I kept getting requests for Python and we got one pretty substantial request that we

16:02.160 --> 16:04.560
had been doing it here and there a little bit.

16:04.560 --> 16:10.800
So in terms of that type of development, i.e. web applications, mostly a Ruby shop, that

16:10.800 --> 16:16.160
is now all completely reversed, mostly Python and for a couple of years now.

16:16.160 --> 16:21.160
I try to keep up, I guess, like I have a practice where I do like what I've talked about them

16:21.160 --> 16:22.160
years ago.

16:22.160 --> 16:28.240
CodeCata is like a little programming exercise and I think it's Coding Hero is the website.

16:28.240 --> 16:29.760
But now I just there's a Reddit for it, too.

16:29.760 --> 16:31.720
I just do them from.

16:31.720 --> 16:33.880
I can't say that I always pick up the new thing, right?

16:33.880 --> 16:37.680
I mean, when node was the new hotness, I spent probably a year here just bashing the crap

16:37.680 --> 16:38.680
out of it.

16:38.680 --> 16:42.640
I still stand by all of that case, like last week where I've changed my mind a bit.

16:42.640 --> 16:49.200
Swift, right, where I understand why you would want to use Swift even over Objective C. But

16:49.200 --> 16:53.560
that's mostly because Apple have become difficult about, you know, putting things in Objective

16:53.560 --> 16:54.560
C.

16:54.560 --> 16:56.560
Why Python particularly?

16:56.560 --> 16:59.600
Well, you know, that is a question, right?

16:59.600 --> 17:05.520
So one of the challenges, in fact, we had a meeting on Friday is Python's not exactly

17:05.520 --> 17:06.520
performant.

17:06.520 --> 17:10.060
Neither was Ruby, but for and make sure I phrase this right.

17:10.060 --> 17:14.880
Most of the time, the client, you know, development work for hire stuff.

17:14.880 --> 17:18.840
They're more interested for us, at least the kind of things we do and just getting it done

17:18.840 --> 17:19.840
at a reasonable performance.

17:19.840 --> 17:22.120
And we're always speaking performance as we go.

17:22.120 --> 17:28.040
Yeah, sometimes, like right now with Alice, we are hitting some some walls that I'm starting

17:28.040 --> 17:33.680
to look at, you know, more like Rust, you know, Rust modules or C++ modules, because

17:33.680 --> 17:38.080
straight throughput is becoming a problem.

17:38.080 --> 17:42.160
You know, I won't use anything that I have to pay for, right, like any proprietary, like

17:42.160 --> 17:43.160
weird stuff.

17:43.160 --> 17:44.160
I don't know.

17:44.160 --> 17:45.160
I try things that look interesting.

17:45.160 --> 17:46.160
Like I like Rust.

17:46.160 --> 17:52.480
I think in the last few years, the new quote language that's excited me the most is Rust.

17:52.480 --> 17:57.080
Although there's a lot of chaos over there for reasons that I still don't understand.

17:57.080 --> 17:59.880
But in fact, Chris, we kind of just dropped that story completely.

17:59.880 --> 18:00.880
The whole kerfuffle.

18:00.880 --> 18:01.880
Yeah.

18:01.880 --> 18:03.720
Well, they aren't giving us much.

18:03.720 --> 18:07.360
You know, there was some more departures, but they claim they were not related to the

18:07.360 --> 18:09.540
recent community stuff.

18:09.540 --> 18:10.540
I'm watching.

18:10.540 --> 18:11.540
I'm watching.

18:11.540 --> 18:16.680
But that group has traditionally been very tight lipped.

18:16.680 --> 18:18.680
You know, you don't talk about Fight Club.

18:18.680 --> 18:24.280
You don't talk about Crap Club.

18:24.280 --> 18:29.040
Linode.com slash coder, go there to get $100 in 60 day credit on a new account.

18:29.040 --> 18:30.880
And you go there to support the show.

18:30.880 --> 18:33.320
Linode is fast and reliable cloud hosting.

18:33.320 --> 18:34.320
It's how we host everything.

18:34.320 --> 18:38.760
And you got to try it for your next project, especially now that Linode has been rolling

18:38.760 --> 18:45.080
out upgrades to their storage, MVME PCIe storage, and it's crazy fast.

18:45.080 --> 18:49.680
We're currently experimenting with the idea of moving our matrix database over to MVME

18:49.680 --> 18:54.840
storage and the back end database for our Castablaster system, which manages all of

18:54.840 --> 18:58.680
the encoding and metadata and processing of our shows up on Linode.

18:58.680 --> 19:01.440
Yeah, we do all of that stuff up on Linode too.

19:01.440 --> 19:06.800
Our editors submit a final flack with all of their amazing skills applied to making

19:06.800 --> 19:08.520
the show sound great.

19:08.520 --> 19:12.780
That goes up to a system on Linode and in it, it does all the processing from there.

19:12.780 --> 19:17.040
It pushes it out to all of our different endpoints on different social media platforms and RSS

19:17.040 --> 19:18.860
feeds and all of that.

19:18.860 --> 19:23.160
And we're looking at our different workloads and thinking, okay, well, what should we move

19:23.160 --> 19:25.160
over to their S3 object storage?

19:25.160 --> 19:28.680
What should we move over to MVME block storage?

19:28.680 --> 19:29.680
That's our math right now.

19:29.680 --> 19:32.080
And if you're a performance hound, Linode's the way to go.

19:32.080 --> 19:37.320
They've got screaming fast CPUs, screaming fast disk, and a screaming fast network interface.

19:37.320 --> 19:41.720
They are their own ISP and they got 11 data centers around the world.

19:41.720 --> 19:45.160
You're going to find something close to yourself or your clients.

19:45.160 --> 19:49.480
And Linode's been doing this for almost 19 years and it just keeps getting better and

19:49.480 --> 19:51.000
better all the time.

19:51.000 --> 19:55.000
They got new stuff they're working on and the stuff they've rolled out, they nail it.

19:55.000 --> 19:57.440
What they've learned is to focus and do things right.

19:57.440 --> 20:03.560
They're not trying to lock you into some sort of crazy complex proprietary hyperscaler platform.

20:03.560 --> 20:09.320
You can use industry standard tools like Terraform and Kubernetes or their straightforward API

20:09.320 --> 20:11.160
or even just their beautiful dashboard.

20:11.160 --> 20:12.160
It's all straightforward.

20:12.160 --> 20:16.040
You're going to get started in no time and it's a great way to support the show.

20:16.040 --> 20:18.360
If you've been thinking about doing it, now's the time.

20:18.360 --> 20:19.840
It really is great.

20:19.840 --> 20:22.840
Linode.com slash coder.

20:22.840 --> 20:35.520
Big congratulations to everyone who's ever worked on.NET and all of those of you who

20:35.520 --> 20:38.160
took a bet on something crazy for Microsoft.

20:38.160 --> 20:40.720
It just hit 20 years.

20:40.720 --> 20:46.280
.NET Framework 1.0 came out 20 years ago, February 14th, 2002.

20:46.280 --> 20:47.280
That makes me feel old.

20:47.280 --> 20:51.140
You know, I was looking up news clippings from that time.

20:51.140 --> 20:52.140
It was a different time.

20:52.140 --> 20:53.440
First of all, I just got to say it.

20:53.440 --> 20:54.440
What's.NET?

20:54.440 --> 20:55.440
I thought it was called Jsharp.

20:55.440 --> 20:56.440
I thought it was called.NET Core.

20:56.440 --> 20:57.440
I thought it was called Mono.

20:57.440 --> 21:03.000
No, actually, you know, I was looking, I was trying to look back at the timeline because

21:03.000 --> 21:09.360
that there are like big moments in all of this timeline and definitely it was in 2016

21:09.360 --> 21:14.620
when Microsoft billed, when they announced the whole like Mono was coming in as part

21:14.620 --> 21:16.400
of the.NET Foundation.

21:16.400 --> 21:18.480
It was going under an MIT license.

21:18.480 --> 21:23.720
I mean, that also followed acquisition of the Zmarion or Xamarin.

21:23.720 --> 21:28.120
Yeah, I mean, that was 2016, which I remember doing the show then.

21:28.120 --> 21:30.120
At least I seem to recall we were doing the show then.

21:30.120 --> 21:31.120
We were.

21:31.120 --> 21:32.120
Yeah.

21:32.120 --> 21:36.440
And I seem to recall having a very skeptical take on how this was all going to go because

21:36.440 --> 21:41.400
we really were, that was really at the beginning of wrapping our heads around what Microsoft

21:41.400 --> 21:43.080
was doing with the development community.

21:43.080 --> 21:46.480
And that was really around the beginning of this big shift internally, I think, on their

21:46.480 --> 21:49.120
approach to open source.

21:49.120 --> 21:50.120
You know what?

21:50.120 --> 21:51.120
I need a Decker King.

21:51.120 --> 21:52.120
Yeah.

21:52.120 --> 21:53.120
You want to tell us a little story?

21:53.120 --> 21:54.120
Is that what you're saying?

21:54.120 --> 21:55.120
Oh, yeah.

21:55.120 --> 21:56.120
Stay a while and listen.

21:56.120 --> 21:57.120
All right.

21:57.120 --> 22:01.880
Our younger listeners, I am going to make some statements that you are not going to

22:01.880 --> 22:04.120
believe, but here we go.

22:04.120 --> 22:05.120
They're all true.

22:05.120 --> 22:12.320
In 2002, not just Microsoft, not just Sun, and let's all pour one out and cry a little

22:12.320 --> 22:13.320
bit.

22:13.320 --> 22:20.560
The entire industry, more or less, and mainstream business press believed that Java was the

22:20.560 --> 22:23.440
terminal point of all languages, right?

22:23.440 --> 22:26.520
Java was going to take over the world.

22:26.520 --> 22:32.540
There was a breathless email from Bill Gates freaking the hell out about Java, right?

22:32.540 --> 22:35.100
That is why you have.NET.

22:35.100 --> 22:40.560
It was originally Microsoft's answer to Java, so much so that they implemented Java and

22:40.560 --> 22:42.840
called it J-Shark.

22:42.840 --> 22:44.360
That didn't last too long.

22:44.360 --> 22:45.480
That is some good history.

22:45.480 --> 22:46.480
You're right.

22:46.480 --> 22:50.760
In fact, when Gates freaked out about it, a lot of people freaked out about it.

22:50.760 --> 22:51.760
It was everywhere, right?

22:51.760 --> 22:52.760
Java was going to be everywhere.

22:52.760 --> 22:54.920
It was going to be in your...

22:54.920 --> 22:55.920
What would we call them?

22:55.920 --> 22:58.200
We called them Micro Edition.

22:58.200 --> 23:02.840
Remember Java Micro Edition for like your, quote, what we call an IoT today?

23:02.840 --> 23:03.840
It was in mobile.

23:03.840 --> 23:07.160
Those crappy flip phones ran Java.

23:07.160 --> 23:10.480
Some people, when they were young and needed the money, wrote Java.

23:10.480 --> 23:11.820
They're very, very sorry.

23:11.820 --> 23:16.600
Don't forget, too, about those horrendous, horrendous cable set-top boxes, that whole

23:16.600 --> 23:17.600
industry.

23:17.600 --> 23:18.600
DVD players.

23:18.600 --> 23:24.560
Remember when this DVD and Blu-ray first shipped with Java apps on the Blu-ray player?

23:24.560 --> 23:27.360
This was a seismic, like- Horrible.

23:27.360 --> 23:31.920
It was like their Sputnik moment over at Microsoft, because it was truly, right?

23:31.920 --> 23:36.360
Most developers at the time, your mainstream developers, a lot of them were doing either

23:36.360 --> 23:43.320
like VBasic, not VB.net, VBasic, or C++.

23:43.320 --> 23:51.200
And Java was such a, how would you say, less of a pain in the ass than C++, but more powerful

23:51.200 --> 23:52.200
than...

23:52.200 --> 23:53.200
I'll say more powerful than VBasic.

23:53.200 --> 23:54.920
I know people will fight.

23:54.920 --> 23:59.840
As we talk a little bit more about where.NET is today, keep the context in your head that

23:59.840 --> 24:05.080
this was effectively a defensive rearguard action at Microsoft.

24:05.080 --> 24:13.620
Because Sun, beautiful, sweet, never learned how to make any goddamn money, Sun, was so

24:13.620 --> 24:14.880
threatening to them.

24:14.880 --> 24:16.480
Go on, Chris.

24:16.480 --> 24:17.480
Where are we today?

24:17.480 --> 24:22.660
I was just thinking, now we're in a world where you kind of exert your control through

24:22.660 --> 24:26.580
open source and foundation participation.

24:26.580 --> 24:30.920
Back in this era, they also started working on their Flash competitor.

24:30.920 --> 24:35.200
So they were fighting this fight on multiple fronts.

24:35.200 --> 24:36.200
And what was that called?

24:36.200 --> 24:37.200
Silver something, right?

24:37.200 --> 24:38.200
Silverlight.

24:38.200 --> 24:39.200
Silverlight.

24:39.200 --> 24:40.200
Yeah, Silverlight.

24:40.200 --> 24:42.240
.NET obviously didn't turn out like Silverlight.

24:42.240 --> 24:47.360
.NET turned out to be a very wise investment, but it is so fun to revisit the original motivations

24:47.360 --> 24:48.360
there.

24:48.360 --> 24:49.360
And now here we are.

24:49.360 --> 24:50.360
Sun is no more.

24:50.360 --> 24:54.720
They have gifted us a file system and left us.

24:54.720 --> 24:56.200
It'll always be too soon.

24:56.200 --> 24:57.200
True.

24:57.200 --> 24:58.800
They had some seriously cool hardware.

24:58.800 --> 25:02.580
And some seriously bad businessmen.

25:02.580 --> 25:04.520
But some great ponytails.

25:04.520 --> 25:05.880
Maybe the ponytails didn't help.

25:05.880 --> 25:08.000
I'm just saying.

25:08.000 --> 25:09.000
Especially back then.

25:09.000 --> 25:12.320
You know, congratulations.NET, 20 years.

25:12.320 --> 25:15.640
Yes, you helped kill one of the most interesting, you know what?

25:15.640 --> 25:16.640
We're not going to go here.

25:16.640 --> 25:17.640
How's Oracle now?

25:17.640 --> 25:21.560
Actually, one more thing on the Microsoft thing.

25:21.560 --> 25:24.100

Get that free t-shirt and happy monitoring.

26:28.440 --> 26:34.200
Microsoft's playing 3D chess and I think Apple is still playing checkers here.

26:34.200 --> 26:39.840
Microsoft not only has been pulling the strings with the Epic lawsuit, but now Microsoft has

26:39.840 --> 26:44.600
published a set of principles that will guide their app store.

26:44.600 --> 26:46.340
Except the one they make money on, yes.

26:46.340 --> 26:51.000
In light of the process starting around the regulatory oversight of the Activision Blizzard

26:51.000 --> 26:56.960
purchase, Microsoft wanted to make it clear that they are committed to an open app store.

26:56.960 --> 27:00.720
One that allows game makers to make revenue directly.

27:00.720 --> 27:05.100
Microsoft said, we have developed these principles in part to address our growing role and responsibilities.

27:05.100 --> 27:10.680
We start the process of seeking regulatory approval in capitals around the world for

27:10.680 --> 27:12.520
our acquisition of Activision Blizzard.

27:12.520 --> 27:15.440
This is coming from Brad Smith.

27:15.440 --> 27:20.400
And the effort is really to paint Microsoft as this open player.

27:20.400 --> 27:25.520
Microsoft's strategy is really a long game here against Apple.

27:25.520 --> 27:32.260
Because if they can break Apple's 30% cut of Microsoft Office and Xbox games and anything

27:32.260 --> 27:36.040
Microsoft related that gets sold on the iOS app store.

27:36.040 --> 27:41.680
If they can break that cut, then it's worth no profits from the Windows app store because

27:41.680 --> 27:44.000
they don't make any money now anyways.

27:44.000 --> 27:48.200
They're essentially offering to make no money in a platform they already make no money in

27:48.200 --> 27:52.600
exchange for Apple losing everything.

27:52.600 --> 27:54.400
I think it's pretty wild.

27:54.400 --> 27:55.400
You know what?

27:55.400 --> 27:58.440
If Microsoft can pull it off, maybe it's better for everybody.

27:58.440 --> 27:59.800
Maybe it's a good thing.

27:59.800 --> 28:03.560
But I think it's really interesting to watch them play this chess game while pretending

28:03.560 --> 28:08.840
like the good guy and appealing to the regulators with promises of their open Windows store.

28:08.840 --> 28:10.480
Yeah, I don't know.

28:10.480 --> 28:17.560
I mean, you know, I'm always excited to roo over Apple on this app store stuff.

28:17.560 --> 28:23.000
But this doesn't, this seems like weak tea to me, and I don't think this is gonna work.

28:23.000 --> 28:24.000
I don't know.

28:24.000 --> 28:25.000
I think it might.

28:25.000 --> 28:28.720
At least in terms of getting the Activision Blizzard deal passed.

28:28.720 --> 28:33.760
Microsoft, you know, like Dave Jones, he sent us a boost from his new podcast app.

28:33.760 --> 28:38.040
And he said, what Microsoft learned from their antitrust tobacco is that they need to up

28:38.040 --> 28:39.720
their DC lobbyist game.

28:39.720 --> 28:43.040
So now they have one of the most effective lobbying machines in DC.

28:43.040 --> 28:46.760
That's why you never hear their name mentioned in the halls of Congress anymore, despite

28:46.760 --> 28:48.480
their size and behavior.

28:48.480 --> 28:54.040
Like, so they figured out how to lobby, how to basically own the representatives they

28:54.040 --> 28:59.360
need to own, and now how to appeal to the world, to the rest of the world regulators,

28:59.360 --> 29:03.320
by claiming that, you know, we're willing to be a totally open store that doesn't need

29:03.320 --> 29:04.320
a cut.

29:04.320 --> 29:09.680
Yeah, but only where we don't make significant money, because they explicitly say the Xbox

29:09.680 --> 29:11.560
is still going to be the way it is.

29:11.560 --> 29:16.420
If I were Microsoft and I were talking to some lawmaker who had questions, I'd probably

29:16.420 --> 29:21.000
have some huge number that was like derived from the sales of Office that get downloaded

29:21.000 --> 29:25.920
through the store and claim that the store generates, you know, $400 million a year.

29:25.920 --> 29:28.560
Add in those team subscriptions too while you're at it, right?

29:28.560 --> 29:29.560
Yes.

29:29.560 --> 29:30.560
Yeah, right.

29:30.560 --> 29:33.760
So you could see how they could cook the books to make it look like it's a pretty big sacrifice.

29:33.760 --> 29:34.760
I mean, great.

29:34.760 --> 29:35.760
I love it.

29:35.760 --> 29:36.760
Mud in Apple's eye, right?

29:36.760 --> 29:43.040
But I feel like what really happened here is Apple continues to, for whatever reason,

29:43.040 --> 29:46.120
be super, super petulant about this.

29:46.120 --> 29:52.560
And as a guy who has been known to be petulant, I get it, but they're just not like, like

29:52.560 --> 29:56.040
they just got slapped again by the Dutch authorities.

29:56.040 --> 29:59.120
You know, if Jobs was alive, we'd all be saying this is Steve's fault.

29:59.120 --> 30:00.120
This is Steve.

30:00.120 --> 30:01.120
He's so pigheaded.

30:01.120 --> 30:02.560
You know, he's so stubborn.

30:02.560 --> 30:03.560
He's so vindictive.

30:03.560 --> 30:07.000
So everybody would just claim it's Steve Jobs' personal decision.

30:07.000 --> 30:11.720
But now that he's dead, people are looking for all these explanations and it just has

30:11.720 --> 30:13.720
to come down to this.

30:13.720 --> 30:16.040
Apple's looking at how many iPhones they sell.

30:16.040 --> 30:19.680
They're looking at what the potential market size is and they're looking at the lifetime

30:19.680 --> 30:24.640
of these iOS devices, especially things like the iPad and Apple TV, and they're looking

30:24.640 --> 30:29.160
at the app store revenue and they're thinking this is our 50 year moneymaker here.

30:29.160 --> 30:35.040
You know, I listen to other podcasts and a lot of them seem to be putting like the Apple

30:35.040 --> 30:37.520
execs on the couch.

30:37.520 --> 30:42.480
And I kind of feel like maybe that's partially fair that like, you know, it's Apple culture

30:42.480 --> 30:46.580
to be kind of a jerk about things.

30:46.580 --> 30:50.040
But they have to know, right, these aren't dumb people.

30:50.040 --> 30:52.240
They have very fancy lawyers.

30:52.240 --> 30:54.160
They have lobbyists.

30:54.160 --> 30:58.880
They have to know that they're going to have to compromise.

30:58.880 --> 31:03.500
And I think they're just doing the classic New Jersey style business negotiation of I'm

31:03.500 --> 31:09.540
going to start at the most insane position possible.

31:09.540 --> 31:13.120
And then I'm eventually going to concede at the last second and give you what I was already

31:13.120 --> 31:14.120
going to give you anyway.

31:14.120 --> 31:15.120
Yeah.

31:15.120 --> 31:19.420
And if you project the entire time, like you're in the right, you know, like it almost weakens

31:19.420 --> 31:24.560
your hand if you start capitulating at all, because it sort of shows that you know you're

31:24.560 --> 31:25.560
in the wrong.

31:25.560 --> 31:31.280
So it's like, who is going to enforce a Congress to pass a law?

31:31.280 --> 31:35.760
Maybe I don't necessarily think that's super duper likely.

31:35.760 --> 31:37.580
I know they're trying.

31:37.580 --> 31:41.040
How about some regulators?

31:41.040 --> 31:42.880
So would that be the FTC?

31:42.880 --> 31:47.220
All right, so the FTC sues them.

31:47.220 --> 31:51.040
Apple's like, we're one of one of if not the richest company in the world.

31:51.040 --> 31:52.040
We can do this forever.

31:52.040 --> 31:54.860
Well, and there needs to be some kind of law they're breaking.

31:54.860 --> 31:57.920
So there has to be something that changes that they are then in violation of.

31:57.920 --> 31:58.920
Yeah.

31:58.920 --> 32:03.100
And maybe, you know, as a fake conservative, I sometimes play one on the interwebs.

32:03.100 --> 32:07.900
Maybe I just don't think Mitch McConnell particularly cares about this and therefore it's not going

32:07.900 --> 32:08.900
to happen.

32:08.900 --> 32:09.900
And maybe I'm wrong.

32:09.900 --> 32:10.900
Right.

32:10.900 --> 32:14.520
Who knows the reason people keep saying the show is turning into like unfiltered to nobody

32:14.520 --> 32:15.520
says that.

32:15.520 --> 32:16.520
Do they say that?

32:16.520 --> 32:17.920
I say it to myself in the mirror every morning.

32:17.920 --> 32:20.360
I mean, you don't want to give people fuel.

32:20.360 --> 32:21.360
They'll run with that.

32:21.360 --> 32:26.260
I like that is because these companies are so big and powerful.

32:26.260 --> 32:32.100
The only entities that could actually maybe stand up to them also happen to have Davies.

32:32.100 --> 32:33.360
They're trillion dollar plus company.

32:33.360 --> 32:34.360
Yeah.

32:34.360 --> 32:39.200
It isn't like a bunch of like, you know, fun companies with some young folks and we're

32:39.200 --> 32:40.200
all chillin.

32:40.200 --> 32:44.780
It I love system 76 because it's nostalgia.

32:44.780 --> 32:50.160
But when they eventually take over the world and join Microsoft Activision Blizzard, Vivendi,

32:50.160 --> 32:51.540
I'll be sad to write.

32:51.540 --> 32:58.000
It's like we yearn for just a small, genuine, independent business these days.

32:58.000 --> 33:01.240
Like when I talk about Linode in the ads, I mentioned the fact that they are independent.

33:01.240 --> 33:02.240
Yeah.

33:02.240 --> 33:03.700
Like that's a huge deal, right?

33:03.700 --> 33:07.040
It's not it's not very common anymore.

33:07.040 --> 33:08.400
And it's a mistake I made for a bit.

33:08.400 --> 33:12.640
I had to go through the process to fully appreciate the repercussions.

33:12.640 --> 33:13.640
I hear you.

33:13.640 --> 33:16.640
I mean, let's do a bacon competition for a minute.

33:16.640 --> 33:20.440
How does this end in your mind, this all this app store stuff?

33:20.440 --> 33:24.800
Well, it feels like Microsoft is four steps ahead of Apple, right?

33:24.800 --> 33:29.240
Like Microsoft has known it was going to end up inevitably at this point.

33:29.240 --> 33:33.560
And they've been getting things lined up to grease the wheels for this Activision Blizzard.

33:33.560 --> 33:36.960
They've known for a year what direction Blizzard was going in, right?

33:36.960 --> 33:38.600
We established that recently.

33:38.600 --> 33:39.600
That in itself is horrific.

33:39.600 --> 33:40.600
But yeah.

33:40.600 --> 33:41.600
So they've been watching.

33:41.600 --> 33:46.800
They've been circling Blizzard for a year while the stock dropped 50 percent in value

33:46.800 --> 33:52.080
and their founder was engulfed in or their CEO was engulfed in controversy.

33:52.080 --> 34:01.200
And during that time, they supplied Epic with documentation and legal time to go after Apple

34:01.200 --> 34:07.560
and possibly some money, too, it seems, while also planning to grease the wheels around

34:07.560 --> 34:09.020
the world with the regulators.

34:09.020 --> 34:14.520
How Apple was clever about the M1 transition, Microsoft is very clever about this Blizzard

34:14.520 --> 34:16.800
Activision acquisition, right?

34:16.800 --> 34:21.360
They have been laying the groundwork for at least a year, probably more.

34:21.360 --> 34:26.520
I don't think I can convey how savvy this move is and how alarming it is to me that

34:26.520 --> 34:29.120
Microsoft is still very dangerous.

34:29.120 --> 34:32.520
You are like warming my black little heart here.

34:32.520 --> 34:33.520
Really?

34:33.520 --> 34:35.440
I am like full on nihilism here.

34:35.440 --> 34:37.360
Like I don't think Apple is just making a mistake.

34:37.360 --> 34:41.360
I think they know they're going to basically win because the government of the United States

34:41.360 --> 34:42.360
barely functions.

34:42.360 --> 34:44.000
Yeah, it could be.

34:44.000 --> 34:46.320
They are extremely legally savvy.

34:46.320 --> 34:48.040
They have a pretty strong case.

34:48.040 --> 34:51.720
Like we can't really put a finger on what rule they've broken.

34:51.720 --> 34:56.520
They set the terms for their own store and Epic clearly violated those terms intentionally.

34:56.520 --> 35:02.880
Well, even by the most aggressive, let's say politicians, right, the political critics,

35:02.880 --> 35:07.640
you know, like a Klobuchar, her remedy is to pass a new law.

35:07.640 --> 35:08.840
Sure.

35:08.840 --> 35:09.840
Can you do it?

35:09.840 --> 35:10.840
Right?

35:10.840 --> 35:15.680
Can you do it to the point where it is in fact, you know, it's a wolf with some teeth.

35:15.680 --> 35:16.680
Can you be a wolf warrior?

35:16.680 --> 35:18.940
If you get that reference, I'm very sorry.

35:18.940 --> 35:22.120
Or are you going to be like a little chihuahua that maybe nips them in the heels?

35:22.120 --> 35:29.320
Because I just don't see a law with real teeth getting through both houses of Congress.

35:29.320 --> 35:34.200
I see maybe some kind of Mickey Mouse rubber, you know, like slap on the wrist.

35:34.200 --> 35:35.200
I don't know.

35:35.200 --> 35:39.160
Like people are talking about there's some bill to do sideloading or to mandate sideloading.

35:39.160 --> 35:40.640
I'd eat my hat if that happened.

35:40.640 --> 35:43.640
I just it's never going to happen.

35:43.640 --> 35:48.820
The issue with these bills, too, is unfortunately they're not really written by our representatives

35:48.820 --> 35:50.120
or their staff.

35:50.120 --> 35:54.340
They're written by industry groups and then given to our representatives.

35:54.340 --> 36:01.520
So number one, that probably means any anti-Apple industry group is probably not as savvy as

36:01.520 --> 36:03.160
Apple's team is.

36:03.160 --> 36:04.160
But it's hard to say.

36:04.160 --> 36:05.580
Their D.C. game isn't the best.

36:05.580 --> 36:07.400
Or they're Microsoft's lobbyists, right?

36:07.400 --> 36:08.960
That would be who would do it.

36:08.960 --> 36:09.960
Right.

36:09.960 --> 36:10.960
Microsoft's lobbyists, yes.

36:10.960 --> 36:12.640
Microsoft's D.C. game is clearly superior.

36:12.640 --> 36:17.520
It's fascinating because, you know, Apple's had to resort to Tim Cook personally calling

36:17.520 --> 36:20.160
representatives and the White House.

36:20.160 --> 36:23.080
Like that's desperate.

36:23.080 --> 36:27.280
Microsoft has institutionalized their D.C. engagement, right?

36:27.280 --> 36:30.520
It is a active part of the company.

36:30.520 --> 36:31.880
It's on the balance sheet.

36:31.880 --> 36:34.280
It's something they staff for.

36:34.280 --> 36:37.320
Apple is I mean, yeah, they participate in lobbyist groups.

36:37.320 --> 36:40.800
Don't get me wrong, but they don't have the savvy team that Microsoft does.

36:40.800 --> 36:43.640
Really you are filling me with hope and light today.

36:43.640 --> 36:46.160
IBM is in a lot of trouble right now.

36:46.160 --> 36:49.760
You don't necessarily hear this very often with when it comes to controversy, but it

36:49.760 --> 36:50.760
is striking.

36:50.760 --> 36:53.360
I didn't even know they were still there.

36:53.360 --> 36:58.720
IBM apparently labeled older workers, quote unquote, older workers that are 50 and up

36:58.720 --> 37:00.600
as dino babies.

37:00.600 --> 37:01.600
Wow.

37:01.600 --> 37:02.600
Did they hire Mike Morhaim?

37:02.600 --> 37:03.600
Is that what happened?

37:03.600 --> 37:07.040
This sounds like this does sound like like a comedy almost.

37:07.040 --> 37:08.040
I'm sorry.

37:08.040 --> 37:10.160
I'm thinking might not Mike Morhaim, Bobby Kotick.

37:10.160 --> 37:15.020
So documents were released in the age discrimination case that appear to show high level discussions

37:15.020 --> 37:19.320
at IBM about paring down the ranks of older employees.

37:19.320 --> 37:24.000
IBM executives were directly involved in discussions about the need to reduce a portion of older

37:24.000 --> 37:28.720
employees at the company, sometimes referring to them as dino babies.

37:28.720 --> 37:33.240
And they've released a trove of documents in federal district court on Friday.

37:33.240 --> 37:34.240
Jesus Christ.

37:34.240 --> 37:35.240
I know.

37:35.240 --> 37:36.800
Here's a quote.

37:36.800 --> 37:40.320
We've discussed the fact that our millennial population trails our competitors.

37:40.320 --> 37:42.200
This is one email from an executive at the time.

37:42.200 --> 37:46.360
It goes on to say, the data below is very sensitive not to be shared.

37:46.360 --> 37:48.440
But I wanted to make sure you have it.

37:48.440 --> 37:51.960
You'll see while Accenture is seventy two percent millennials, we are at forty two percent

37:51.960 --> 37:56.680
with a wide range of mini units following well below that average, speaking to the need

37:56.680 --> 38:01.600
to hire early professionals, which I guess early professionals was a company's term for

38:01.600 --> 38:05.280
somebody who is like new, didn't have much experience.

38:05.280 --> 38:06.280
I see.

38:06.280 --> 38:11.180
The problem is, is they needed to, quote, accelerate change by inviting the dino babies

38:11.180 --> 38:12.180
to leave.

38:12.180 --> 38:15.000
It's Blade Runner and make them a, quote, extinct species.

38:15.000 --> 38:16.000
Whoa.

38:16.000 --> 38:17.000
Oh, yeah.

38:17.000 --> 38:23.940
A third email refers to IBM's, quote, dated maternal workforce, which was an apparent

38:23.940 --> 38:26.880
implication to the older women at IBM.

38:26.880 --> 38:29.760
And it said, quote, this is what must change.

38:29.760 --> 38:33.880
They really don't understand social or engagement.

38:33.880 --> 38:35.280
Not digital natives.

38:35.280 --> 38:37.560
A real threat for us.

38:37.560 --> 38:39.280
That's like the hat trick.

38:39.280 --> 38:41.000
All they were missing was something racist.

38:41.000 --> 38:43.920
They got misogyny and ageism in one.

38:43.920 --> 38:49.920
What's incredible, too, is this was a group of probably, you know, 50 to 60 year old men

38:49.920 --> 38:50.920
and women.

38:50.920 --> 38:51.920
Right.

38:51.920 --> 38:55.640
As I say, the upper level executives at IBM, they have to be older dudes, mostly.

38:55.640 --> 38:56.640
Right.

38:56.640 --> 38:57.640
Honestly, you and I know this.

38:57.640 --> 38:59.400
This is how a lot of companies speak internally.

38:59.400 --> 39:00.400
Yeah.

39:00.400 --> 39:05.080
I have been at a client of mine where I was consulting them because of an acquisition

39:05.080 --> 39:08.120
and they wanted to speak to somebody who knew their infrastructure.

39:08.120 --> 39:12.000
And one of the things they just openly spoke about in this meeting and this is a local

39:12.000 --> 39:16.880
company here in Washington that nobody ever hear of, but I was shocked, is they knew the

39:16.880 --> 39:21.200
numbers of people that were on antidepressants through the insurance program.

39:21.200 --> 39:24.780
They didn't have the names of the people, but they knew exactly how many people were

39:24.780 --> 39:26.400
taking what drug.

39:26.400 --> 39:28.060
That seems not good.

39:28.060 --> 39:34.280
And they had the open conversation of like, do we have too many people at work on antidepressants?

39:34.280 --> 39:36.040
And I couldn't believe what I was hearing.

39:36.040 --> 39:41.080
Now, this is probably 2009 or 10.

39:41.080 --> 39:43.080
So this is a little while ago now.

39:43.080 --> 39:44.200
I'm sure companies still have this.

39:44.200 --> 39:48.120
This is the way these companies think and speak, right?

39:48.120 --> 39:51.260
Humans that work for them are a resource that they move around.

39:51.260 --> 39:55.800
That's why they have human resource departments that they have now given new euphemisms.

39:55.800 --> 39:59.840
The other thing that strikes me here is there is actually a bit of truth to all of this.

39:59.840 --> 40:04.540
I have also been at places where the older staff don't get it.

40:04.540 --> 40:05.620
They don't get the internet.

40:05.620 --> 40:07.840
They don't get the expectations of a younger generation.

40:07.840 --> 40:09.160
They just don't get it.

40:09.160 --> 40:13.680
And so they have been a bit of a challenge, but you don't work them out.

40:13.680 --> 40:17.240
You find the work, especially at a company the size of IBM, right?

40:17.240 --> 40:19.620
There's going to be a position there that works for them.

40:19.620 --> 40:24.200
It's ruthless because you've got to assume some of these people probably worked there

40:24.200 --> 40:28.180
for 10, 15, 20, 30 years, right?

40:28.180 --> 40:33.400
They gave a massive portion of their life to this company and then they get to a certain

40:33.400 --> 40:37.760
age and the executives who are their same age have to get rid of them because they're

40:37.760 --> 40:40.200
a quote, real threat for us.

40:40.200 --> 40:41.200
Thanks.

40:41.200 --> 40:43.600
Don't let the door hit you on the way out.

40:43.600 --> 40:46.520
I don't even know what to say.

40:46.520 --> 40:48.900
This is just, I know it's gross.

40:48.900 --> 40:49.900
It's gross.

40:49.900 --> 40:50.900
Yeah.

40:50.900 --> 40:51.900
We can argue about the app store stuff.

40:51.900 --> 40:53.640
There's, you know, there's multiple perspectives.

40:53.640 --> 40:55.280
There's really not two sides to this.

40:55.280 --> 40:58.200
This is just like, you guys are a bunch of dicks.

40:58.200 --> 41:01.600
I want to make it clear that this was years ago.

41:01.600 --> 41:05.320
I couldn't tell you the exact date because I've apparently I've looked at the new yorktimes.com

41:05.320 --> 41:09.640
too many times this month, so I no longer get access to information paywall because

41:09.640 --> 41:13.480
that's the link I grabbed, but I want to say it was like 2006 or something.

41:13.480 --> 41:17.700
It was a while ago that I guess when the documents happened or when it went down or something

41:17.700 --> 41:23.160
like that, that makes sense too because that would be, it's just gross, right?

41:23.160 --> 41:26.160
Well, the funny thing is now here we are.

41:26.160 --> 41:29.660
Some of the older millennials, they're hitting their forties, right?

41:29.660 --> 41:34.280
So these millennials that they had to hire to save the company, some of them are only

41:34.280 --> 41:39.560
about 10 years away from the age where they were trying to, you know, call the herd.

41:39.560 --> 41:40.600
It's just kind of wild.

41:40.600 --> 41:41.600
It's nonsensical.

41:41.600 --> 41:43.200
I could work with these people.

41:43.200 --> 41:44.640
It's just, it's gross.

41:44.640 --> 41:48.880
Well, I don't even think the premise is necessarily true, right?

41:48.880 --> 41:53.040
Older, I'm assuming these people must be managers by now, right?

41:53.040 --> 41:58.920
Like older managers don't necessarily need to know the new shiny, just, I don't know.

41:58.920 --> 42:03.880
It's like if you just maybe communicated with them or had like a ongoing, you know, improvement

42:03.880 --> 42:09.120
plan like many other companies such as Accenture, their main competitor who's kicking their

42:09.120 --> 42:10.120
ass has.

42:10.120 --> 42:11.120
Right.

42:11.120 --> 42:13.480
Well, a lot of these times it's probably just, they don't appreciate the value of learning

42:13.480 --> 42:14.480
something new.

42:14.480 --> 42:18.440
So you just as a, you know, your mission is to do outreach and demonstrate the value.

42:18.440 --> 42:19.440
Okay.

42:19.440 --> 42:21.080
Is it also just cheaper to hire young people though?

42:21.080 --> 42:25.360
Cause this, this sounds a little, now that I'm reading, I just brought up the New York

42:25.360 --> 42:26.360
Times.

42:26.360 --> 42:30.200
I'm thinking, I bet these older folks have also been getting their, you know, end percent

42:30.200 --> 42:31.560
raises every year.

42:31.560 --> 42:34.720
They've accrued a lot of perks, right, a lot of time.

42:34.720 --> 42:40.920
Frankly, the mention of the older women is, there's probably a lot of not a good stuff

42:40.920 --> 42:41.920
there.

42:41.920 --> 42:42.920
Yeah.

42:42.920 --> 42:43.920
Yeah.

42:43.920 --> 42:44.920
Yeah.

42:44.920 --> 42:46.240
You know, I've, I've heard gross conversations of people being like, well, we're going to

42:46.240 --> 42:47.240
hire this woman.

42:47.240 --> 42:51.200
But you know, she's like, she looks like she's in her early thirties and then what if we hire

42:51.200 --> 42:53.360
her and we have to pay a maternity leave?

42:53.360 --> 42:55.400
And it's like, people are scumbags.

42:55.400 --> 42:57.700
I have heard that conversation as well.

42:57.700 --> 43:03.760
So I don't, I think the folks suing them should eat their lunch and IBM should not do this

43:03.760 --> 43:04.760
kid.

43:04.760 --> 43:05.760
Well, I don't think they will.

43:05.760 --> 43:07.720
Optimus Gray got the date.

43:07.720 --> 43:12.240
It looks like it was in 2018 where these, apparently things happened.

43:12.240 --> 43:13.240
Oh boy.

43:13.240 --> 43:17.620
It was reported that IBM fired about 20,000 American employees over the age of 40 back

43:17.620 --> 43:18.620
then.

43:18.620 --> 43:22.200
So 60% of its total US job cuts.

43:22.200 --> 43:26.760
Ah, so this is, this is connected back to that big layoff they did in 2018.

43:26.760 --> 43:30.280
Oh, but didn't they also offshore a bunch of that?

43:30.280 --> 43:31.280
Offshored.

43:31.280 --> 43:35.600
And it looks like the majority of the people they laid off were the older folks, quote unquote

43:35.600 --> 43:36.600
older.

43:36.600 --> 43:37.600
Yeah.

43:37.600 --> 43:38.600
I'm going to go with money.

43:38.600 --> 43:42.240
That I actually, at the time, remember, I remember specifically people on Twitter that

43:42.240 --> 43:46.420
used to work there making that exact point that this is about money.

43:46.420 --> 43:47.600
So you might be onto something there.

43:47.600 --> 43:52.080
I just wanted to mention before we wrap up, I did on your recommendation, sign up for

43:52.080 --> 43:53.880
the Xbox streaming service.

43:53.880 --> 43:54.880
Oh.

43:54.880 --> 43:58.880
So I could get like the ultimate one, so that way I could do the web streaming thing.

43:58.880 --> 44:03.040
It's only a buck for the first month, so I'm giving that a go, but they don't tell you

44:03.040 --> 44:04.320
this when you're signing up.

44:04.320 --> 44:08.520
It's stupid obvious now, but when you sign up and you go to launch your first game, you

44:08.520 --> 44:13.500
have to have a supported controller, which I have, but didn't have with me.

44:13.500 --> 44:14.800
So I didn't get to try it this morning.

44:14.800 --> 44:17.260
So I'm going to try it out later this week and I'll tell you what I think next week.

44:17.260 --> 44:19.960
But so far the experience feels smoother.

44:19.960 --> 44:23.960
I have to say that I do have an Xbox controller, so I'll hook that up.

44:23.960 --> 44:27.200
I did think it was kind of slick with Stadia.

44:27.200 --> 44:31.920
When I signed up for Stadia, they gave me a package that included a controller and a

44:31.920 --> 44:36.160
Chromecast that showed up and then you just, you knew you just had something that worked

44:36.160 --> 44:40.760
out of the box with the service and that was really kind of nice.

44:40.760 --> 44:43.680
Whereas with this service, I'm probably just going to have a mix of different controllers

44:43.680 --> 44:47.320
depending on what computer I'm at, but I'll give it a go.

44:47.320 --> 44:52.120
I'm actually, the more I think about it, skeptical that this is even going to work for Microsoft

44:52.120 --> 44:57.440
because I would propose to you, people that are really into game streaming are people

44:57.440 --> 45:02.960
who are casual gamers and the most expensive aspect of running the service is going to

45:02.960 --> 45:08.000
be spinning up the VMs and allocating the resources and creating the machines for a

45:08.000 --> 45:09.840
game session.

45:09.840 --> 45:15.320
And I often play for 10-15 minutes and then bail and try another game play for 10-15 minutes,

45:15.320 --> 45:17.580
see if it's the right fit and then bail.

45:17.580 --> 45:22.680
And I've been getting throttled on Nvidia's service because I think it's too much resources

45:22.680 --> 45:24.440
to spin up these machines.

45:24.440 --> 45:27.800
And I wonder if that isn't always going to be a problem because if you were super serious

45:27.800 --> 45:34.800
about gaming, you'd probably have the hardware or you're going to be on the other end where

45:34.800 --> 45:39.480
you're just like logged in streaming and running the service all the time.

45:39.480 --> 45:43.560
It just feels like they're going to have a hard time getting that balance right.

45:43.560 --> 45:49.680
Yeah, I think, you know, I don't think you're going to be playing Halo multiplayer on this.

45:49.680 --> 45:50.680
I just don't.

45:50.680 --> 45:51.680
I don't know.

45:51.680 --> 45:52.680
Whatever.

45:52.680 --> 45:53.680
I'm going to try.

45:53.680 --> 45:54.680
That's exactly what I want to.

45:54.680 --> 45:55.680
I want to try.

45:55.680 --> 45:59.080
It's not going to be an experience that's going to be on par.

45:59.080 --> 46:00.080
Why?

46:00.080 --> 46:01.080
Latency?

46:01.080 --> 46:02.080
Latency.

46:02.080 --> 46:03.080
That's what I'm thinking.

46:03.080 --> 46:06.920
You know, I would agree if it was a keyboard and mouse game, but when you're playing controller

46:06.920 --> 46:09.280
based games, I don't know.

46:09.280 --> 46:10.280
Maybe.

46:10.280 --> 46:11.280
Oh, I see.

46:11.280 --> 46:12.280
Okay.

46:12.280 --> 46:13.280
There's a little bit of a...

46:13.280 --> 46:14.280
Yeah.

46:14.280 --> 46:15.280
That's right.

46:15.280 --> 46:16.280
Okay.

46:16.280 --> 46:17.280
So I see.

46:17.280 --> 46:19.280
So if you were playing a real first person shooter, it would be a problem.

46:19.280 --> 46:20.280
Yeah.

46:20.280 --> 46:21.280
If I had real controls.

46:21.280 --> 46:22.280
Yeah.

46:22.280 --> 46:23.280
Like, you know, like not a baby game.

46:23.280 --> 46:24.280
I'm just saying.

46:24.280 --> 46:30.560
No, I mean, I love it, but yeah, like, you know what, I basically exclusively play Marvel

46:30.560 --> 46:35.440
versus Capcom and like various indie stuff that they put on there.

46:35.440 --> 46:40.920
And those indie games, I mean, these guys haven't left the SNES color palette or, you

46:40.920 --> 46:43.440
know, game mechanics for the most part.

46:43.440 --> 46:44.440
And they run just fine in Chrome.

46:44.440 --> 46:45.440
Right?

46:45.440 --> 46:46.440
I don't know what to say.

46:46.440 --> 46:47.440
Yeah.

46:47.440 --> 46:48.440
Okay.

46:48.440 --> 46:49.440
I'll keep that in mind.

46:49.440 --> 46:50.440
I'll keep...

46:50.440 --> 46:51.440
I'll try some of those games too.

46:51.440 --> 46:55.240
I'll make sure I try to try out both sides of the spectrum.

46:55.240 --> 46:56.520
I'm looking forward to it.

46:56.520 --> 46:58.920
Well, I'm also going to try it on my Starlink setup.

46:58.920 --> 47:02.320
You know, that's the ultimate test is can you game stream?

47:02.320 --> 47:07.480
I remember it's a streaming game service over a Starlink connection.

47:07.480 --> 47:08.660
We'll find out.

47:08.660 --> 47:11.600
If you're a member, I just wanted to say thank you, if you haven't become a member yet, maybe

47:11.600 --> 47:12.600
consider it.

47:12.600 --> 47:15.220
Go to coderqa.co.

47:15.220 --> 47:16.600
That's where you sign up.

47:16.600 --> 47:21.520
And then you get a tighter episode, something that's just a little bit shorter because we

47:21.520 --> 47:22.520
cut out the ads.

47:22.520 --> 47:28.100
It still has all of the full production from Drew, but you just get a nicer, shorter production.

47:28.100 --> 47:32.200
And you can support the entire network by signing up at jupyter.party where you get

47:32.200 --> 47:34.760
access to all the shows ad free.

47:34.760 --> 47:35.760
It's pretty sweet.

47:35.760 --> 47:37.920
It's a nice way to support us as well.

47:37.920 --> 47:42.060
Then you get access either membership program to the Coderly report.

47:42.060 --> 47:44.520
And we just put out a new one recently.

47:44.520 --> 47:47.120
Mr. Dominic, is there anywhere you'd like to send people before we get the heck out

47:47.120 --> 47:48.120
of here?

47:48.120 --> 47:51.000
Check out alice.dev and at Dumanuco on Twitter.

47:51.000 --> 47:52.000
Yes.

47:52.000 --> 47:53.000
The power move.

47:53.000 --> 47:54.880
Why don't you join our matrix survey?

47:54.880 --> 48:00.900
If you got matrix set up, it's colony.jupyterbroadcasting.com or we got a telegram group if that's your style.

48:00.900 --> 48:03.400
That's at jupyterbroadcasting.com.

48:03.400 --> 48:04.460
We'd love your feedback.

48:04.460 --> 48:05.460
It's a big part of the show.

48:05.460 --> 48:06.460
We need more of it.

48:06.460 --> 48:08.760
It's at coder.show.com.

48:08.760 --> 48:11.920
And you can subscribe to our RSS feed and get it anytime we publish.

48:11.920 --> 48:13.920
That's at coder.show.subscribe.

48:13.920 --> 48:19.280
Last but not least, links for this week are at coder.show.453 and you can join us live

48:19.280 --> 48:20.280
on Mondays.

48:20.280 --> 48:22.480
We do it at noon Pacific, 3 p.m. Eastern.

48:22.480 --> 48:23.480
Thanks so much for joining us.

48:23.480 --> 48:39.360
We'll see you back here next week.
