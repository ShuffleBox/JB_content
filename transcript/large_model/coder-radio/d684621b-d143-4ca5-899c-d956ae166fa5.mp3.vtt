00:00.000 --> 00:15.800
This is KOTORadio, episode 395 for January 4th, 2021.

00:15.800 --> 00:20.040
Hello friends and welcome into KOTORadio, Jupiter Broadcasting's weekly talk show, taking

00:20.040 --> 00:24.980
a pragmatic look at the world of software development and of course technology.

00:24.980 --> 00:29.760
My name is Chris and this episode is brought to you by a cloud guru.

00:29.760 --> 00:34.880
A cloud guru now includes cloud playgrounds, Azure AWS, Google cloud sound boxes, but it's

00:34.880 --> 00:36.840
on ACG's credit card, not yours.

00:36.840 --> 00:40.680
Get certified, get hired, get learning at a cloud guru.com.

00:40.680 --> 00:44.800
Joining us at his weather station in Florida, it's our host, Mr. Dominic.

00:44.800 --> 00:45.800
Hello, Mike.

00:45.800 --> 00:47.280
What's up, Mr. Fisher?

00:47.280 --> 00:49.840
Happy 2021 to you, sir.

00:49.840 --> 00:52.440
It's been roughly the same.

00:52.440 --> 00:53.440
Yeah.

00:53.440 --> 00:54.440
Yeah.

00:54.440 --> 00:55.440
Yeah.

00:55.440 --> 00:56.440
As one would expect, really.

00:56.440 --> 00:57.440
It's like we make a big deal about it.

00:57.440 --> 01:03.040
Like we actually make a really big deal about it this year, but it's all kind of a construct,

01:03.040 --> 01:04.040
you know?

01:04.040 --> 01:09.520
I mean, not to be a downer, but like time is sort of a construct in which we have all

01:09.520 --> 01:13.120
just begun to participate and there's like not really a new year's.

01:13.120 --> 01:14.840
There's not, it's not like a real thing.

01:14.840 --> 01:16.020
It's something we made up.

01:16.020 --> 01:20.600
So it's kind of like the green lantern, but that moment when he realizes he no longer

01:20.600 --> 01:25.480
believes in himself, like 5,000 feet in the air and it's like, oh shit, I can't fly anymore.

01:25.480 --> 01:26.480
Yeah.

01:26.480 --> 01:29.560
I'm not, I'm not big on waiting to do resolutions until the new year.

01:29.560 --> 01:32.560
If there's something I want to do, I just, I just try to kind of do it.

01:32.560 --> 01:33.560
Yeah.

01:33.560 --> 01:35.360
I just kind of do whatever the hell I want.

01:35.360 --> 01:38.240
That's why for Christmas I got myself a deep fryer.

01:38.240 --> 01:39.240
You're killing me.

01:39.240 --> 01:43.400
Now don't come at me with your deep fry and hate because you know, you can fry stuff healthy

01:43.400 --> 01:44.400
I suppose.

01:44.400 --> 01:45.640
Oh, there's no hate.

01:45.640 --> 01:50.480
So I got this, I got an old fryer from Angela's house, my, my ex-wife's house, and I hadn't,

01:50.480 --> 01:55.640
I hadn't touched it in about seven years and it was in rough shape, Mike.

01:55.640 --> 01:57.920
It was in real rough shape.

01:57.920 --> 01:59.760
It was left in a used state.

01:59.760 --> 02:01.920
It was not put away in a clean state.

02:01.920 --> 02:06.200
And uh, I decided to just go all craftsman on it.

02:06.200 --> 02:08.600
You ever have one of these things where you're like, you know what, I'm going to do a really

02:08.600 --> 02:10.600
damn good job at something.

02:10.600 --> 02:11.600
No.

02:11.600 --> 02:13.360
I'm going to go all in.

02:13.360 --> 02:17.200
I don't do it often, but I'm like, you know, this is something where like I could just

02:17.200 --> 02:20.760
go all like immaculate on this thing.

02:20.760 --> 02:26.280
So I spent like two and a half hours, three hours perfectly cleaning this deep fryer.

02:26.280 --> 02:28.000
And it looked, it looked brand fricking new.

02:28.000 --> 02:34.520
I mean the metal on like the basket for the fryer shined, the outside was perfect, immaculate.

02:34.520 --> 02:36.360
I mean, I really was proud.

02:36.360 --> 02:43.520
And I, I fried up some onion strings for Christmas dinner for the, uh, green bean casserole and

02:43.520 --> 02:44.520
it was amazing.

02:44.520 --> 02:47.320
And I thought, wow, this is so great.

02:47.320 --> 02:48.800
I'm going to fry more often.

02:48.800 --> 02:53.280
I went out to get the deep fryer the next day and it was broken.

02:53.280 --> 02:57.800
It had broke that night that some of the plastic latching was just old and brittle and just

02:57.800 --> 03:00.280
started disintegrated inside.

03:00.280 --> 03:05.280
And I was left devastated because I decided to go all craftsman on this deep fryer.

03:05.280 --> 03:09.100
And I got like this emotional connection with this deep fryer and I reconnected with how

03:09.100 --> 03:13.480
much I love to fry food and then it broke on me.

03:13.480 --> 03:15.880
And so I just, I couldn't take it.

03:15.880 --> 03:19.000
And I thought about it and I went on, I'm not even kidding about any of this, I went

03:19.000 --> 03:22.640
on a research bender for a solid two hours on deep fryers.

03:22.640 --> 03:23.880
I looked at commercial deep fryers.

03:23.880 --> 03:28.960
I actually went to a kitchen supply store here in the Pacific Northwest and surveyed

03:28.960 --> 03:33.480
the commercial grade deep fryers.

03:33.480 --> 03:35.600
I really went deep now that I think about this.

03:35.600 --> 03:37.520
This is kind of a tragedy.

03:37.520 --> 03:40.280
This is, I didn't handle it well.

03:40.280 --> 03:43.800
This is like, how could something like this happen to you?

03:43.800 --> 03:48.880
So I don't know, but I ended up just getting a Cuisinart pro consumer style.

03:48.880 --> 03:49.880
I really like it.

03:49.880 --> 03:52.960
I didn't go all in, but you know, I looked at the various price ranges and I got a deep

03:52.960 --> 03:59.760
fryer and you know, I got to say two days into using it, I don't think I want it anymore.

03:59.760 --> 04:01.920
It makes the whole place really stink like oil.

04:01.920 --> 04:03.400
It's no good.

04:03.400 --> 04:09.360
The whole studio smells like fried food right now and I just don't know about it.

04:09.360 --> 04:15.240
So you know, it's been a weird New Year's.

04:15.240 --> 04:21.720
As the chat room has just pointed out, I recently acquired a MacBook Air M1 again and watched

04:21.720 --> 04:22.760
50 Shades of Grey.

04:22.760 --> 04:25.800
So I don't know which one of those you'd like to deal with first.

04:25.800 --> 04:27.400
Well we're going to get to the M1.

04:27.400 --> 04:29.040
That is for sure.

04:29.040 --> 04:31.720
I got a couple of quick emails.

04:31.720 --> 04:35.320
Of course there's a really important one or two that came in about robes this week, but

04:35.320 --> 04:37.440
I'll just focus on a couple of them.

04:37.440 --> 04:41.360
Brian and Zoe wrote in, so Chris and Mike, I'm writing in regards to the robe bros.

04:41.360 --> 04:44.680
My daughter and I listen to the show every week and we get a kick out of it while we

04:44.680 --> 04:45.920
learn more and more.

04:45.920 --> 04:49.200
My daughter was wondering if the robes will come in a kid's size.

04:49.200 --> 04:52.320
So Zoe, I got to say, I'm looking into this right now, but I'm having a challenge even

04:52.320 --> 04:57.680
getting adult size robes, but that is something I'm taking under advisement for future swag

04:57.680 --> 04:58.680
development.

04:58.680 --> 05:00.960
Is this robe dream still a thing?

05:00.960 --> 05:03.360
Dude, our top people are working on it right now.

05:03.360 --> 05:04.360
Oh my God.

05:04.360 --> 05:05.360
They really are.

05:05.360 --> 05:09.880
And we get emails every week about people that are robe bros.

05:09.880 --> 05:10.880
I know we do.

05:10.880 --> 05:15.080
I see them and I'm just like, do you know how much a custom robe is going to cost per

05:15.080 --> 05:16.080
unit?

05:16.080 --> 05:17.320
I said our top people are working on it.

05:17.320 --> 05:19.680
We're seeing if we can't get something made cheap in China.

05:19.680 --> 05:20.680
I'm sorry.

05:20.680 --> 05:21.680
Is that, wait, wait.

05:21.680 --> 05:23.880
Is that like top men from Shenzhen?

05:23.880 --> 05:24.880
Yeah.

05:24.880 --> 05:25.880
Yeah.

05:25.880 --> 05:29.200
People familiar with the matter are investigating options right now.

05:29.200 --> 05:33.360
Well I know we just got Steve Bannon to fly over there, so we should be in good shape.

05:33.360 --> 05:38.280
I've got somebody better than Bannon, but so Brian's daughter Zoe is eight years old

05:38.280 --> 05:40.400
and would love a Kota Radio robe.

05:40.400 --> 05:47.000
So I think what we're seeing here is clearly this robe idea appeals to people in a wide,

05:47.000 --> 05:48.300
wide demo.

05:48.300 --> 05:53.560
It's not just people that are in their adult work years.

05:53.560 --> 05:55.520
I can't believe you, man.

05:55.520 --> 05:57.280
It's real.

05:57.280 --> 05:58.440
They really truly wrote in.

05:58.440 --> 06:05.240
Anyways, they say thanks for the, well basically they really want to become part of the robe

06:05.240 --> 06:08.280
bros because robe bros also includes ladies.

06:08.280 --> 06:10.760
So they'll be waiting in the wings and they say thanks for the show.

06:10.760 --> 06:13.240
They just started getting into rust about a month ago.

06:13.240 --> 06:19.680
Brian was a C++ and C sharp guy for most of his development career, but after using rust,

06:19.680 --> 06:23.400
I got into one of those rust positions at a tech company in the Seattle area.

06:23.400 --> 06:25.640
Oh, that's cool, Brian.

06:25.640 --> 06:28.560
What a tech company in the Seattle area, you say.

06:28.560 --> 06:30.640
He says very respectively, Brian and Zoe.

06:30.640 --> 06:32.520
I'll let you know, Brian, about those robes.

06:32.520 --> 06:37.880
So wait, would young Zoe, I guess Zoe is baby Zoe, be a robe Padawan?

06:37.880 --> 06:42.320
Because we're getting dangerously close to establishing a Kota Radio Jedi order here.

06:42.320 --> 06:43.560
It probably is Zoe, huh?

06:43.560 --> 06:45.580
We should know for the record, so you guys got to let us know.

06:45.580 --> 06:46.580
We should know.

06:46.580 --> 06:48.800
You have to write back in because we got to know her real name.

06:48.800 --> 06:51.440
Archie, and see this one really got to me.

06:51.440 --> 06:53.760
Archie wrote in and says, I can has robe.

06:53.760 --> 06:55.040
Oh my God, really?

06:55.040 --> 06:57.200
Seriously, I need a superior quality robe.

06:57.200 --> 06:59.920
My current robe isn't even an MVP.

06:59.920 --> 07:06.840
Please robe, Archie, which really, you know, that hit me hard.

07:06.840 --> 07:07.940
I get it.

07:07.940 --> 07:08.940
You're really into this.

07:08.940 --> 07:09.940
All right.

07:09.940 --> 07:10.940
Okay.

07:10.940 --> 07:11.940
Moving on.

07:11.940 --> 07:12.940
Actually, some real feedback.

07:12.940 --> 07:16.800
You touched on time tracking last week, and we got a couple of really, really interesting

07:16.800 --> 07:18.280
emails about that.

07:18.280 --> 07:22.680
David wrote in, he said for time tracking, he uses Harvest.

07:22.680 --> 07:27.760
It's been great for us, it comes with apps on the PC, Mac, phone, integrations with Trello,

07:27.760 --> 07:32.200
and there's no official app for Linux, but the API is decent, and there is a project

07:32.200 --> 07:35.560
out there that he uses, and yes, it is written in Rust.

07:35.560 --> 07:36.560
Yep.

07:36.560 --> 07:40.600
I used to use Harvest until I went to QuickBooks at the insistence of my very grumpy, very

07:40.600 --> 07:42.800
related to me accountant.

07:42.800 --> 07:48.220
Yeah, that's always been what drove me to QuickBooks too, is ultimately the accountants.

07:48.220 --> 07:50.880
I have some real time robe feedback if you'd like it.

07:50.880 --> 07:51.880
Yes, always.

07:51.880 --> 07:55.920
A very attractive attorney in the Tampa area would also like a robe.

07:55.920 --> 07:56.920
There you go.

07:56.920 --> 07:58.600
I think attractive attorneys should have robes.

07:58.600 --> 07:59.600
I really do.

07:59.600 --> 08:03.160
I think attractive attorneys should have robes, and this is another lady robe, so...

08:03.160 --> 08:04.880
Oh, okay.

08:04.880 --> 08:07.640
I actually have gotten a fair amount of interest from ladies.

08:07.640 --> 08:09.040
RobeRose absolutely includes the ladies.

08:09.040 --> 08:12.000
Chris, we all know you get a fair amount of interest from the ladies.

08:12.000 --> 08:13.600
All right.

08:13.600 --> 08:19.880
So next email on time tracking comes in from Carl, and this one is so geeky.

08:19.880 --> 08:23.120
Talking about time tracking tools, he says, fellas, I wonder, have you heard about the

08:23.120 --> 08:25.520
plain text accounting community?

08:25.520 --> 08:29.700
A few enthusiasts, looking back to the early 80s style of computerized ledgers, built tools

08:29.700 --> 08:34.420
focused around plain text, console entered, and queried ledgers.

08:34.420 --> 08:38.400
The community gained some traction with the introduction of Ledger CLI, but has since

08:38.400 --> 08:40.800
diversified into several other tools.

08:40.800 --> 08:44.960
Personally, I use BeanCount because it's a very sleek and well-designed GUI wrapper

08:44.960 --> 08:49.560
that you can self-host, provides a Python module for scripting, and allows you to define

08:49.560 --> 08:53.200
your own currency, including time.

08:53.200 --> 08:59.760
I went and looked at some of this plaintextaccounting.org stuff, and it felt right.

08:59.760 --> 09:03.680
You know when you see something and you look at it and you go, there's something to that.

09:03.680 --> 09:07.280
I don't think I'm going to do it, but when I looked at that, there was a bit of me that

09:07.280 --> 09:13.080
immediately felt, oh man, I wish I could do my books like this, because it just, it sounds

09:13.080 --> 09:14.720
silly at first, but it just looks right.

09:14.720 --> 09:20.240
It reminds me of how my grandpa used to do his accounting on Lotus and stuff on a machine

09:20.240 --> 09:21.240
that was...

09:21.240 --> 09:22.240
Ah, Lotus, that's a blast from the past.

09:22.240 --> 09:23.240
Yeah.

09:23.240 --> 09:24.240
Yeah.

09:24.240 --> 09:25.240
It was quite old.

09:25.240 --> 09:27.960
But have you ever heard of this plaintext accounting business?

09:27.960 --> 09:29.400
Kind of.

09:29.400 --> 09:38.620
So longtime listeners will know that my old man is a 77-year-old accountant, CPA actually.

09:38.620 --> 09:42.400
He thinks that every version of Excel that is released is a personal attack.

09:42.400 --> 09:43.400
Right.

09:43.400 --> 09:44.400
Yes.

09:44.400 --> 09:45.400
He did it.

09:45.400 --> 09:46.400
He did it.

09:46.400 --> 09:52.080
It's like, it's like Satya's sitting there, hey old man, fuck you.

09:52.080 --> 09:55.280
He taught me basic bookkeeping when I was eight.

09:55.280 --> 10:00.160
I don't know if, I mean, older, I don't think they teach this in school anymore, but Chris,

10:00.160 --> 10:01.760
I think you all know what I'm talking about.

10:01.760 --> 10:03.920
Remember those green ledger books?

10:03.920 --> 10:04.920
Oh yes.

10:04.920 --> 10:05.920
Oh yeah, absolutely.

10:05.920 --> 10:09.320
Well, when I was in school, that's how you'd learn book, you had a class called bookkeeping

10:09.320 --> 10:13.520
and I was not doing well and he was an accountant and he was like, no, you're going to, fuck

10:13.520 --> 10:14.520
you.

10:14.520 --> 10:15.520
Hey, I'm an accountant.

10:15.520 --> 10:16.520
How can you not know this?

10:16.520 --> 10:18.560
By the way, since we changed to the night thing, the show was no longer clean.

10:18.560 --> 10:19.560
Sorry.

10:19.560 --> 10:21.040
I did have a beep somewhere around here.

10:21.040 --> 10:22.040
Somewhere.

10:22.040 --> 10:23.040
There it is.

10:23.040 --> 10:26.120
He deleted the beep button in exchange for the robe glory button.

10:26.120 --> 10:31.440
He hasn't been able to press it yet, but I need something noble that just rolls out and

10:31.440 --> 10:32.440
sort of unfolds.

10:32.440 --> 10:34.560
Look, you know what it needs to be, right?

10:34.560 --> 10:41.800
Just for irony's sake, the song they played during order 66, just like the sad, like we're

10:41.800 --> 10:42.800
all going to die.

10:42.800 --> 10:47.920
No, but like, yes, he, there's nothing more plain text than pencil and green graph paper.

10:47.920 --> 10:48.920
That's my point.

10:48.920 --> 10:49.920
But no, I did look at this.

10:49.920 --> 10:51.560
I have to be honest with you.

10:51.560 --> 10:55.240
I hate QuickBooks online because it's hard as hell to use.

10:55.240 --> 11:01.600
I'm sort of thinking maybe I look at this just for like basic, like, you know, like

11:01.600 --> 11:02.600
when I'm on a trip, right?

11:02.600 --> 11:03.600
Gotta be nice.

11:03.600 --> 11:07.560
You know, when the apocalypse is over, just to like key in some basic info.

11:07.560 --> 11:09.520
Oh, that's actually a really good idea.

11:09.520 --> 11:10.520
You're right.

11:10.520 --> 11:13.360
You can use it temporarily to keep track of what's going on.

11:13.360 --> 11:18.520
Well, this is maybe to like self-employed sales guy inside baseball here, but you know,

11:18.520 --> 11:23.120
you might know this, uh, the rules on meals and entertainment have changed significantly,

11:23.120 --> 11:24.120
right?

11:24.120 --> 11:27.040
And what you can expense, but you can't, I don't know if I do know.

11:27.040 --> 11:28.880
I mean, cause I've been out of the game for a little while.

11:28.880 --> 11:29.880
Then there's been no events.

11:29.880 --> 11:30.880
Oh yeah.

11:30.880 --> 11:33.880
In 2019 they changed and it goes, uh, well, I'm not, I'm not an accountant.

11:33.880 --> 11:39.560
I'm not a CPA, so don't take my advice, but, or a lawyer or whatever, but it's, uh, it

11:39.560 --> 11:45.640
used to be, if you had a client with you, you were basically like fallen, right?

11:45.640 --> 11:46.640
Expense everything.

11:46.640 --> 11:49.040
Now, I think it's only the client's meal or something.

11:49.040 --> 11:53.080
And again, ask your accountant, but you need to track like detailed.

11:53.080 --> 11:54.440
It's not just how much did you spend?

11:54.440 --> 12:02.480
It's how much of it was you, which is, I have to tell you, I miss ordering $15 martinis.

12:02.480 --> 12:07.120
Well, I, you know, and it's not even necessarily a tax scam, like legitimately some of the

12:07.120 --> 12:09.680
best, did I say scam?

12:09.680 --> 12:13.960
No, I'm, I'm saying like those meals where you're expensing that stuff, real business

12:13.960 --> 12:14.960
happens there.

12:14.960 --> 12:20.280
Like actual, like maybe not actual, the business itself, but the, the, the, the starting of

12:20.280 --> 12:24.680
a process of business, like it's just, Oh, I could go on and on forever about that.

12:24.680 --> 12:28.160
But the, yeah, I did not know that I will look into it though.

12:28.160 --> 12:29.160
You never know.

12:29.160 --> 12:30.160
It could really bite me in the butt.

12:30.160 --> 12:31.160
Yeah.

12:31.160 --> 12:32.160
It's really weird.

12:32.160 --> 12:33.160
And I'll just totally straight.

12:33.160 --> 12:37.720
I completely understand what changed, but I know it's there, like unless you are in fact

12:37.720 --> 12:41.320
a pharmaceutical sales rep, they're getting real strict, especially if you're the owner

12:41.320 --> 12:42.320
of the company.

12:42.320 --> 12:44.980
And like, was that really a business meeting or, you know,

12:44.980 --> 12:51.000
It's funny you say that, that industry specifically, because, um, when I was doing it consulting,

12:51.000 --> 12:58.280
I had a handful of doctor's offices and I would try to time the day that I would visit

12:58.280 --> 13:00.560
because I would try to visit them once a week.

13:00.560 --> 13:04.080
I would try to time that for the day that the pharmaceutical rep was in the office giving

13:04.080 --> 13:08.040
the free lunch to the entire staff, because that was a weekly occurrence at these offices

13:08.040 --> 13:09.520
that you can weirdly still do.

13:09.520 --> 13:10.520
God, it was great.

13:10.520 --> 13:11.520
It was great.

13:11.520 --> 13:12.520
I don't think so.

13:12.520 --> 13:13.520
Fuck you guys.

13:13.520 --> 13:14.520
Work from home, buy your own meals.

13:14.520 --> 13:15.520
That's it.

13:15.520 --> 13:16.520
Yeah.

13:16.520 --> 13:21.600
Or, um, like there was a, I've seen what some companies are doing now is subscribing their

13:21.600 --> 13:27.280
employees to these like boxes of the month that include like the snacks or that includes,

13:27.280 --> 13:28.280
yeah.

13:28.280 --> 13:31.240
So you know that, you know, now that now they don't have like the snack area with the free

13:31.240 --> 13:33.480
unlimited snacks, but they're sending you a box of stuff for you.

13:33.480 --> 13:37.760
I have to say since I've gone remote, I did not realize how much I was spending on beer

13:37.760 --> 13:38.760
and coffee.

13:38.760 --> 13:39.760
Oh man.

13:39.760 --> 13:40.760
For me, it's definitely the caffeine.

13:40.760 --> 13:41.760
Yeah, definitely.

13:41.760 --> 13:42.760
Yeah.

13:42.760 --> 13:46.240
I mean, I mean for, cause we had like a, like every Friday we had beer and we had like a

13:46.240 --> 13:48.160
whole coffee like, Oh sure.

13:48.160 --> 13:49.160
Yeah.

13:49.160 --> 13:50.760
It was, and I couldn't buy regular coffee.

13:50.760 --> 13:58.040
No, I had to buy like, you know, the Sultan's third wife's cousins, whatever.

13:58.040 --> 13:59.040
Yeah.

13:59.040 --> 14:00.040
Can't have Folgers in there.

14:00.040 --> 14:01.040
Oh, fuck Folgers.

14:01.040 --> 14:02.040
I would still buy Folgers.

14:02.040 --> 14:04.040
It goes against the brand.

14:04.040 --> 14:06.280
Listen, we're the mad botter.

14:06.280 --> 14:10.040
We have tea that may or may not be made from shrooms.

14:10.040 --> 14:11.040
Okay.

14:11.040 --> 14:12.040
Yeah.

14:12.040 --> 14:15.060
So I actually think you're onto it right there though.

14:15.060 --> 14:19.920
Using this thing as a ledger while you're out and about or maybe working for a particular

14:19.920 --> 14:20.920
project.

14:20.920 --> 14:21.920
Oh yeah.

14:21.920 --> 14:22.920
Actually that's even better.

14:22.920 --> 14:23.920
Yeah.

14:23.920 --> 14:24.920
I didn't even think of that.

14:24.920 --> 14:29.680
All right, what is your PNL on an individual product, a project rather?

14:29.680 --> 14:32.560
Which reminds me, can I, can I take a diversion here?

14:32.560 --> 14:33.560
Sure.

14:33.560 --> 14:34.560
Sure.

14:34.560 --> 14:35.560
So Ruby three came out.

14:35.560 --> 14:36.560
Oh, look at them.

14:36.560 --> 14:37.560
I'm so sad.

14:37.560 --> 14:41.140
What in particular makes you sad about it?

14:41.140 --> 14:43.960
My inability to cleanly upgrade my projects.

14:43.960 --> 14:46.040
Oh yes.

14:46.040 --> 14:49.040
Came out on Christmas too, by the way, which is a cute, right?

14:49.040 --> 14:50.040
Is that their thing?

14:50.040 --> 14:51.040
Do they do that normally?

14:51.040 --> 14:52.040
A Christmas release?

14:52.040 --> 14:57.840
I say what I deserve for Christmas, I think a bunch of work that no one wants to pay for

14:57.840 --> 15:00.520
and is an incredible pain in the ass.

15:00.520 --> 15:03.520
Well, it's all about performance this release.

15:03.520 --> 15:04.520
You know?

15:04.520 --> 15:05.520
Okay.

15:05.520 --> 15:06.520
Now you sound like my ex-wife.

15:06.520 --> 15:09.960
Oh, too much, too much, too much.

15:09.960 --> 15:10.960
That's what they've, that's what they've touted.

15:10.960 --> 15:11.960
Yeah.

15:11.960 --> 15:12.960
Just a ton.

15:12.960 --> 15:15.080
It's all about like, that's why that I think that's what they're trying to say.

15:15.080 --> 15:19.920
The reason to upgrade is because there's this ginormous leap in performance.

15:19.920 --> 15:21.000
Oh kidding aside.

15:21.000 --> 15:28.040
It's actually a lot faster and if you were, I don't know, 15 and just doing toy projects,

15:28.040 --> 15:29.040
that would be great.

15:29.040 --> 15:30.040
Yeah.

15:30.040 --> 15:35.240
If you had a large code basis that have been around for seven years, it's not so great.

15:35.240 --> 15:39.480
Well especially if the client is not so interested in paying the time required to actually fix

15:39.480 --> 15:40.480
it.

15:40.480 --> 15:43.560
Well, it's almost like it's hard to, and I will say I have no specific client who doesn't

15:43.560 --> 15:47.160
want to pay for it right now, but it's like I'm writing the pitch for why they should

15:47.160 --> 15:48.160
pay for it.

15:48.160 --> 15:49.680
I'm like, I don't know.

15:49.680 --> 15:50.680
Should you pay for it?

15:50.680 --> 15:56.840
Like RAM is super cheap and you're not having performance issues and this is going to cost

15:56.840 --> 15:58.600
you like $20,000.

15:58.600 --> 16:01.840
So maybe just don't pay for it.

16:01.840 --> 16:02.840
Right.

16:02.840 --> 16:03.840
Although I would love to take, you know what I mean?

16:03.840 --> 16:05.460
I'm like, I would love for you to pay.

16:05.460 --> 16:08.160
It's like, it's a very conflict of interest situation.

16:08.160 --> 16:09.160
Yeah.

16:09.160 --> 16:10.720
I could see it if it's security driven.

16:10.720 --> 16:15.960
Well, so this is where it gets bad because at some point when some of the gems like Devise,

16:15.960 --> 16:16.960
Devise is a big one, right?

16:16.960 --> 16:21.040
For those who don't do Rails, Devise is kind of the user authentication, user identity

16:21.040 --> 16:23.800
management gem that's often used in Rails.

16:23.800 --> 16:25.760
You know, at some point that's going to Ruby 3.

16:25.760 --> 16:26.760
Yeah.

16:26.760 --> 16:27.760
Right.

16:27.760 --> 16:31.280
And it's going to be hard to maintain like Ruby 2, I don't remember the specific version,

16:31.280 --> 16:35.480
but let's call it like 2.5, 2.6, maybe 2.7.

16:35.480 --> 16:38.960
So then you're like, you're in this situation of, okay, now it's a security issue.

16:38.960 --> 16:42.640
So does that 20K make sense?

16:42.640 --> 16:45.960
I think we got feedback about this last week too, about when to upgrade and when to not.

16:45.960 --> 16:49.960
Well, and like Noble Pain is pointing out in the chat room, it's going to be an easier

16:49.960 --> 16:52.900
upgrade than when 5.0 or 4.0 rolls out.

16:52.900 --> 16:55.080
It's never easy, Wes.

16:55.080 --> 16:56.760
It's never easy.

16:56.760 --> 16:57.800
Ruby is, that's the title.

16:57.800 --> 16:58.800
Ruby is never easy.

16:58.800 --> 17:01.680
Although probably not appropriate for the rest of the episode.

17:01.680 --> 17:02.680
You know what?

17:02.680 --> 17:04.720
I think we should just have stopped at dial-up myself, but-

17:04.720 --> 17:06.280
That'd have been great.

17:06.280 --> 17:07.840
That'd have been great.

17:07.840 --> 17:12.440
I'm actually always astonished what I got away with using dial-up.

17:12.440 --> 17:13.840
It just seems impossible now.

17:13.840 --> 17:18.760
I mean, I'm astonished at what you get away with in general.

17:18.760 --> 17:23.040
One question that Rich has for the audience, he says, I'm intrigued by all the talk about

17:23.040 --> 17:28.160
programmable keyboards, but they seem way too expensive to try out.

17:28.160 --> 17:32.400
Are there any Linux compatible ones in the $20 to $50 range that I could try out without

17:32.400 --> 17:33.400
breaking the bank?

17:33.400 --> 17:34.400
No.

17:34.400 --> 17:37.440
I don't know of any, but I thought maybe somebody out there in the audience does.

17:37.440 --> 17:40.560
So I did some Googling that I could find.

17:40.560 --> 17:44.840
Now there's some guys saying, I have an Arduino board and I built a keyboard.

17:44.840 --> 17:48.680
But if you factor in the materials and the time, no, not for-

17:48.680 --> 17:52.840
Yeah, it may just come down to cost of materials to build something like that.

17:52.840 --> 17:53.840
They're high quality.

17:53.840 --> 17:59.600
They have to take a lot of long-term use and never really probably didn't care.

17:59.600 --> 18:02.560
Well just good switches aren't that cheap either, right?

18:02.560 --> 18:03.560
True.

18:03.560 --> 18:04.560
Yeah.

18:04.560 --> 18:05.560
Quality switches matter.

18:05.560 --> 18:06.720
So feedback's a big part of our show.

18:06.720 --> 18:08.160
It keeps us connected with our audience.

18:08.160 --> 18:10.920
So we wanted to ask you guys, what type of work are you doing?

18:10.920 --> 18:14.240
Send us in a brief rundown of the stack you're working in.

18:14.240 --> 18:18.880
Why not include the machine, some brief specs in OS, that'd be interesting too.

18:18.880 --> 18:20.640
So we can kind of get an idea.

18:20.640 --> 18:23.720
We like to kind of just kind of have these conversations from time to time.

18:23.720 --> 18:27.240
So if you're doing development day-to-day, tell us a bit about what you're doing or maybe

18:27.240 --> 18:29.480
you're running a business or maybe you're going to school.

18:29.480 --> 18:30.920
I just kind of like to get an idea.

18:30.920 --> 18:34.840
And even if you haven't started working on a project yet, you may have something in mind.

18:34.840 --> 18:36.840
I'd like to get an idea of what that is.

18:36.840 --> 18:40.800
Try to keep it as brief as you can, just so we can get several of them on air.

18:40.800 --> 18:44.360
And then, you know, share with us as much or as little as you would like.

18:44.360 --> 18:48.080
We kind of keep it first names only, if you've probably noticed, fairly vague.

18:48.080 --> 18:51.820
We may say the country you've written in from if you add that to your signature.

18:51.820 --> 18:56.480
But head over to coder.show.com and tell me about your current work and your stack and

18:56.480 --> 18:58.280
a little bit about your specs.

18:58.280 --> 19:04.200
That's coder.show.com or email us coder at jupiterbroadcasting.com directly.

19:04.200 --> 19:08.320
It's just kind of a great way for us to keep the feedback fresh and get an idea of what

19:08.320 --> 19:09.320
everybody out there is doing.

19:09.320 --> 19:11.480
You got any special requests for those emails?

19:11.480 --> 19:13.540
Anything that you want them to include?

19:13.540 --> 19:17.120
Maybe like a secret message?

19:17.120 --> 19:18.120
Not today.

19:18.120 --> 19:19.120
No.

19:19.120 --> 19:20.120
No, not today.

19:20.120 --> 19:26.000
Although Ed, although Ed, if you're, you know, just Ed and Egon, I want to make sure you

19:26.000 --> 19:27.000
guys are okay.

19:27.000 --> 19:28.000
Yeah.

19:28.000 --> 19:29.000
Yeah.

19:29.000 --> 19:30.000
I'd like to hear from Egon.

19:30.000 --> 19:31.000
Yeah.

19:31.000 --> 19:32.000
Egon, if you're out there in particular.

19:32.000 --> 19:33.000
I know.

19:33.000 --> 19:34.000
I know.

19:34.000 --> 19:35.000
I know.

19:35.000 --> 19:36.000
I know.

19:36.000 --> 19:37.000
He's a big fan.

19:37.000 --> 19:39.000
That's what they tell me, him and Ed.

19:39.000 --> 19:42.560
They're big fans.

19:42.560 --> 19:44.060

19:44.060 --> 19:47.200
Receive a $100 60-day credit towards your new account.

19:47.200 --> 19:48.200
Yep.

19:48.200 --> 19:49.200
Yep.

19:49.200 --> 19:50.200
I said a $100.

19:50.200 --> 19:51.200
Yeah.

19:51.200 --> 19:55.320
Linode is the largest independent cloud and now you can get a $100 credit to try out some

19:55.320 --> 20:00.480
of their infrastructure or some of their object storage or some of their node balancing.

20:00.480 --> 20:04.520
We use Linode to host all of our infrastructure here at jupiterbroadcasting.com.

20:04.520 --> 20:10.480
When we decided to build JB 3.0 going independent again, it was kind of obvious to go on Linode.

20:10.480 --> 20:14.580
Not only do they have 11 data centers around the world, so I can position stuff regionally

20:14.580 --> 20:19.680
for the audience, which is great, but they have native SSD storage on their machines.

20:19.680 --> 20:24.740
They're very fast, 40 gigabit connections into those machines, and then they have a

20:24.740 --> 20:29.480
really nice dashboard, and they've done something really clever.

20:29.480 --> 20:30.640
You gotta try this.

20:30.640 --> 20:34.520
So go to linode.com slash coder to see what I'm talking about, but they really walk that

20:34.520 --> 20:41.680
line between super easy to use and just one or two clicks away from, oh, you really know

20:41.680 --> 20:46.200
what you're doing, here's the exact command line now to mount this new object storage

20:46.200 --> 20:50.380
or block storage right onto your Linux box and format it as extended for.

20:50.380 --> 20:53.500
And then you just click, click, boom, boom, you can do all that, or here's the instructions,

20:53.500 --> 20:54.500
do the rest yourself.

20:54.500 --> 20:59.300
Like they just really walk that line super well, but on top of all of that, they have

20:59.300 --> 21:04.840
a killer API, and you can use that API directly with your code or take advantage of their

21:04.840 --> 21:06.160
command line application.

21:06.160 --> 21:09.620
This is something I'll do when I'm working on a project, is I'll put the Linode command

21:09.620 --> 21:14.840
line application in my awake terminal, my drop-down terminal on Plasma.

21:14.840 --> 21:20.360
So I hit F12 or tilde depending on my machine, and I've got my Linode access right there.

21:20.360 --> 21:26.960
So I can upload and flip stuff public and generate the URL and copy it to my clipboard

21:26.960 --> 21:31.520
and just like instantaneous, so I can be in my working directory in my awake terminal

21:31.520 --> 21:35.640
and I'll generate a file and then I'll just hit, I'll hit that, I'll hit that Linode CLI

21:35.640 --> 21:39.360
app, I'll throw that file up on object storage, I'll flip it to public, I'll generate the

21:39.360 --> 21:41.960
URL and boom, I've shared it with somebody in just seconds.

21:41.960 --> 21:45.200
And it's up on their super fast object storage.

21:45.200 --> 21:48.400
And Linode is independently owned and they're founded on a love for Linux.

21:48.400 --> 21:53.180
I really liked that about them, but I get how they got there.

21:53.180 --> 21:57.080
They started before AWS because they saw where this stuff was going deep inside the Linux

21:57.080 --> 21:58.080
stack.

21:58.080 --> 22:01.800
And then they built a company around that, which later turned out to be cloud computing.

22:01.800 --> 22:05.440
And now Linode is the largest independent cloud for developers and they're dedicated

22:05.440 --> 22:07.480
to offering the best virtualized cloud computing.

22:07.480 --> 22:11.080
If it runs on Linux, it runs on Linode.

22:11.080 --> 22:16.800
So go to linode.com slash coder and get a $100 60 day credit towards your new account

22:16.800 --> 22:21.660
and you support the show by supporting their sponsors like going to linode.com slash coder.

22:21.660 --> 22:26.040
You make it possible for independent media to give their shows away for free.

22:26.040 --> 22:31.080
So thanks to Linode for their support and thanks for supporting our sponsors, linode.com

22:31.080 --> 22:32.080
slash coder.

22:32.080 --> 22:33.080
Okay.

22:33.080 --> 22:41.000
So you got an M1 again, you had an M1, you sent it back, you thought about it and you

22:41.000 --> 22:42.000
got one again.

22:42.000 --> 22:45.720
And this is how I figured it out too, cause you didn't tell me like, you know, usually

22:45.720 --> 22:49.120
you'll tell me, but this time, nope, mom's the mic.

22:49.120 --> 22:54.880
I just see this tweet, you're like, hmm, interesting, looks like JetBrains is already on the M1

22:54.880 --> 22:55.880
train.

22:55.880 --> 22:57.280
Hmm, that's good for me.

22:57.280 --> 23:01.680
Which was my first indication that you had gotten yourself a MacBook Air again.

23:01.680 --> 23:05.720
So all right, you know, the audience wants to know what's going on here and so do I.

23:05.720 --> 23:10.100
So sometimes we in life make mistakes.

23:10.100 --> 23:14.840
We do regrettable things and then we learn from them.

23:14.840 --> 23:20.480
I had the thinnest of client requests that triggered me to rebuy an M1.

23:20.480 --> 23:21.480
Love it.

23:21.480 --> 23:27.200
But I needed the fig leaf of a justification because I had learned that the issues I was

23:27.200 --> 23:32.680
having could be mitigated by a release that came out like two days after I got my, cause

23:32.680 --> 23:35.480
remember I got one of the early ones.

23:35.480 --> 23:42.800
I want to apologize to the luscious, the deeply sexually attractive Fred Federighi.

23:42.800 --> 23:46.520
And for those of you who did not see the Apple announcement where he had his shirt basically

23:46.520 --> 23:52.040
half open with wind blowing through his hair, it'll change your life in maybe ways you don't

23:52.040 --> 23:53.720
want it to.

23:53.720 --> 23:57.220
This thing is absolutely incredible.

23:57.220 --> 23:59.800
No fan, no noise.

23:59.800 --> 24:04.800
It makes the iMac Pro that I have look like dog shit for the kind of work that I do.

24:04.800 --> 24:09.800
The only hassle I have, and I tweeted about this as well, is that you have to be careful

24:09.800 --> 24:14.560
when you open terminal that you have to duplicate terminal and create a version that always

24:14.560 --> 24:21.840
runs in Rosetta, which is a compatibility layer for AMD 64, i.e. Intel, right?

24:21.840 --> 24:25.240
Or else you get crazy packages that don't work with each other.

24:25.240 --> 24:31.240
So essentially in Mac OS, it's possible to get info about an application and you can

24:31.240 --> 24:34.600
check a box that says always run this application under Rosetta.

24:34.600 --> 24:35.600
Right.

24:35.600 --> 24:39.280
And if you do that for the terminal, then any application that the terminal executes

24:39.280 --> 24:41.600
is done with X86 Rosetta compatibility.

24:41.600 --> 24:44.820
Have you noticed like any kind of performance penalty for that?

24:44.820 --> 24:48.600
I mean, nothing significant enough for me to care about.

24:48.600 --> 24:50.680
Nothing that's really like noticeable, in other words.

24:50.680 --> 24:51.680
No, not compare.

24:51.680 --> 24:56.280
And I had a I had my lemur and I had my other MacBook right next to it, which is an Intel

24:56.280 --> 24:59.840
MacBook and it's like the M1 is faster.

24:59.840 --> 25:00.840
Also no fan.

25:00.840 --> 25:01.840
Yeah.

25:01.840 --> 25:02.840
Yeah, that's really nice.

25:02.840 --> 25:05.160
And the battery is just like out of control.

25:05.160 --> 25:07.560
So yeah.

25:07.560 --> 25:12.640
I will say like it, OK, my one pet peeve, although people have sent me weird hacks on

25:12.640 --> 25:17.240
Twitter of how to fix this, like what I thought I could do was like set one color theming

25:17.240 --> 25:21.040
for Rosetta terminal and for ARM terminal, right?

25:21.040 --> 25:22.040
And one terminal.

25:22.040 --> 25:23.040
Should that be clever?

25:23.040 --> 25:25.040
You can't seem to do that without it affecting both.

25:25.040 --> 25:26.400
And I don't know why.

25:26.400 --> 25:31.440
Have you thought about maybe using terminal for like either X86 or ARM and then using

25:31.440 --> 25:32.440
something like that?

25:32.440 --> 25:33.440
That's what people have been saying.

25:33.440 --> 25:34.920
Use I term or alacrity.

25:34.920 --> 25:35.920
Right.

25:35.920 --> 25:40.640
Just like since I'm realistically for the foreseeable future going to be working in

25:40.640 --> 25:46.720
Rosetta mode on this, just like basically make alacrity or I term or whatever the ARM

25:46.720 --> 25:49.360
terminal and make terminal or vice versa.

25:49.360 --> 25:50.360
It doesn't really matter what you do.

25:50.360 --> 25:51.360
Right.

25:51.360 --> 25:52.960
But I kind of like terminal app.

25:52.960 --> 25:53.960
Have you messed around?

25:53.960 --> 25:54.960
Can you do Docker yet?

25:54.960 --> 25:56.280
Can is that stuff functional?

25:56.280 --> 25:58.760
The Docker is still pretty busted.

25:58.760 --> 26:03.640
OK, performance wise, it's not great, but that's one of those things that I got to tell

26:03.640 --> 26:06.920
you if the Docker team isn't scrambling to fix that.

26:06.920 --> 26:08.720
I don't know what the hell they're doing.

26:08.720 --> 26:14.400
This is a computer I could take when the apocalypse is over on trips and literally no longer have

26:14.400 --> 26:19.200
to like politely say, oh, I'm sorry, sir, can I just like creepily crawl under your

26:19.200 --> 26:21.320
chair to get the power outlet?

26:21.320 --> 26:22.320
Right.

26:22.320 --> 26:23.320
I, I love it.

26:23.320 --> 26:25.520
I don't know what to say.

26:25.520 --> 26:32.200
It's it's a little like I have pet peeves, but my biggest one being Docker, but that's

26:32.200 --> 26:34.080
just going to fix itself.

26:34.080 --> 26:35.080
Right.

26:35.080 --> 26:36.080
Matter of time on that stuff.

26:36.080 --> 26:40.960
And the other thing for me is that, you know, I live in PyCharm, Ruby mine and VS code.

26:40.960 --> 26:46.720
Now, VS code does not have an M1 version yet, which ironically is kind of forced me back

26:46.720 --> 26:52.880
into PyCharm because JetBrains, to their credit, has made M1 versions of all their tools.

26:52.880 --> 26:53.880
Hmm.

26:53.880 --> 26:55.040
Do you notice a difference?

26:55.040 --> 26:59.520
They are faster than the root, like, like they're it's pretty noticeable.

26:59.520 --> 27:00.520
Cool.

27:00.520 --> 27:05.240
But when they try to run terminal commands that run them on the M arm terminal.

27:05.240 --> 27:06.240
Ah, yeah.

27:06.240 --> 27:08.280
Unless you run the whole damn thing under Rosetta.

27:08.280 --> 27:09.280
Right.

27:09.280 --> 27:10.760
Ah, that stinks.

27:10.760 --> 27:11.960
Now there may be a way to change that.

27:11.960 --> 27:14.760
I haven't looked into it deeply because I tend to run my terminal commands actually

27:14.760 --> 27:16.800
on a, on a regular ZSH terminal.

27:16.800 --> 27:17.800
Right.

27:17.800 --> 27:20.720
Like on a Linux box, you'd say, this is the default terminal.

27:20.720 --> 27:23.360
So you could just like switch the default terminal to the right.

27:23.360 --> 27:27.200
I, I, someone I saw in one forum that someone was like, actually, if you open them from

27:27.200 --> 27:33.600
the command line and do these like flags, it'll tell it to run the application in our

27:33.600 --> 27:41.200
mode, but run the terminal to route to the Rosetta terminal, whatever.

27:41.200 --> 27:45.560
I mean, I got to be honest with you, at least for the Ruby community, you know they're porting

27:45.560 --> 27:47.440
everything to M1, right?

27:47.440 --> 27:48.440
Yeah.

27:48.440 --> 27:49.940
They just are.

27:49.940 --> 27:51.920
But the TensorFlow performance.

27:51.920 --> 27:52.920
Yeah.

27:52.920 --> 27:53.920
Holy crap.

27:53.920 --> 27:54.920
Interesting.

27:54.920 --> 27:57.920
Beats the shit out of my iMac pro.

27:57.920 --> 27:58.920
Really?

27:58.920 --> 27:59.920
Oh man.

27:59.920 --> 28:04.080
That's brutal because that iMac pro is like a $4,000, $5,000 machine.

28:04.080 --> 28:07.960
And then it's not, it's not like a $5,000 machine.

28:07.960 --> 28:10.640
It's a 5,000 plus tax machine that I just bought.

28:10.640 --> 28:11.640
Yeah.

28:11.640 --> 28:14.400
Who's my nice expensive doorstop?

28:14.400 --> 28:15.400
Who is a good doorstop?

28:15.400 --> 28:19.960
Isn't that something that a fanless computer can, can beat it like that?

28:19.960 --> 28:22.000
It's 5,000 somethings as far as I'm concerned.

28:22.000 --> 28:23.000
But yes.

28:23.000 --> 28:27.520
In the short it's got to be because the iMac, Apple didn't even really put a great GPU in

28:27.520 --> 28:29.760
there when they made the iMac pro.

28:29.760 --> 28:34.800
So it's got, it's got a pretty old GPU where this has, you know, Apple's best attempt at

28:34.800 --> 28:35.800
a GPU yet.

28:35.800 --> 28:36.800
Right.

28:36.800 --> 28:38.640
It's their like dark magic sorcery GPU, right?

28:38.640 --> 28:43.200
Like it's like Apple's cred Federighi's wind swept hair graphics processing.

28:43.200 --> 28:44.500
I don't know what to say.

28:44.500 --> 28:48.000
And it's really still, it's an area where they're not as competitive.

28:48.000 --> 28:51.960
If you put them up against AMD or Nvidia GPU of a decent quality, they'll still, the Nvidia

28:51.960 --> 28:53.680
and AMD GPU will still win.

28:53.680 --> 28:57.160
So this is, and then I'm going to just drop it right, but this is going to be my pitch

28:57.160 --> 28:59.440
for the M1.

28:59.440 --> 29:02.120
It is not the most powerful machine.

29:02.120 --> 29:09.720
It's maybe not even like the best value cause you know, Apple, but if you are looking for

29:09.720 --> 29:15.720
a decent laptop that has good battery life, good performance, a good screen, decent speakers,

29:15.720 --> 29:19.400
an okay camera, although it's better than other cameras and you could just like take

29:19.400 --> 29:22.960
a zoom call and not have to worry about headphones and stuff.

29:22.960 --> 29:28.160
It does the job and it does are kind of better than most of what I've seen.

29:28.160 --> 29:32.960
I don't disagree with that, especially if you're not unplugging and replugging in sound

29:32.960 --> 29:37.000
interfaces, that thing's going to work on a video call every single time.

29:37.000 --> 29:38.000
Yeah.

29:38.000 --> 29:41.840
And that is something that people write in about a lot is I just want to have a set up

29:41.840 --> 29:43.960
that works for video calls.

29:43.960 --> 29:47.180
Because on a, on a traditional laptop, you know, you're unplugging and plugging stuff

29:47.180 --> 29:53.720
in all the time, your interfaces are changing it, it can be a little shitty.

31:32.440 --> 31:34.800
Well this is interesting.

31:34.800 --> 31:41.040
I talked about this last week is I have Dell's XPS 13 developer edition in-house.

31:41.040 --> 31:47.400
And I think what we have here are the two apex predators for portable developer machines.

31:47.400 --> 31:51.920
And there is an X86 pathway and there is an ARM path.

31:51.920 --> 31:54.880
And I think it's interesting to look at it from that angle.

31:54.880 --> 32:00.840
And so I'm curious to know what the price differences is because the XPS I'm going to

32:00.840 --> 32:04.160
talk about is $1,400 as configured.

32:04.160 --> 32:05.160
You get a lot for that.

32:05.160 --> 32:06.160
All right.

32:06.160 --> 32:10.160
So I got the 13-inch MacBook Air Silver because I just feel the 13-inch one should be silver.

32:10.160 --> 32:11.160
I don't know.

32:11.160 --> 32:12.160
Call me Marco Wormut.

32:12.160 --> 32:15.440
16 gigs of RAM, seven-core GPU.

32:15.440 --> 32:17.480
I did not up the GPU.

32:17.480 --> 32:23.280
The second time around, I did my research and it's actually the same, I'm sorry, CPU,

32:23.280 --> 32:24.280
not GPU.

32:24.280 --> 32:29.600
It's the same CPU, but like the seven-core one just didn't pass the quality, whatever,

32:29.600 --> 32:30.600
whatever.

32:30.600 --> 32:34.960
So I didn't want to spend the extra money for the potential extra core, right?

32:34.960 --> 32:35.960
Yeah.

32:35.960 --> 32:42.440
I did bump the RAM to 16 because I mean, honestly, if I could have, I would have done 24 or 32.

32:42.440 --> 32:43.600
That's not an option.

32:43.600 --> 32:50.840
And it should be Apple, you guys are nuts, 256 RAM and no one cares about the bullshit

32:50.840 --> 32:51.840
stuff they put here.

32:51.840 --> 32:52.840
So that was-

32:52.840 --> 32:53.840
256 gigs of storage.

32:53.840 --> 32:54.840
Storage.

32:54.840 --> 32:59.920
No, 256 RAM, Chris, I hooked it right up to a data center and I was just like-

32:59.920 --> 33:02.200
Give me the Tim Cook model.

33:02.200 --> 33:04.440
Tim Cook uses an iPad very famously.

33:04.440 --> 33:05.440
Yeah.

33:05.440 --> 33:09.480
Although, I wonder, really, really?

33:09.480 --> 33:10.720
You know who doesn't use an iPad?

33:10.720 --> 33:11.720
His assistant.

33:11.720 --> 33:12.720
Exactly.

33:12.720 --> 33:17.080
His assistant sitting there with an iMac Pro like, why the fuck can't this guy just get

33:17.080 --> 33:18.080
a keyboard?

33:18.080 --> 33:19.560
Why don't I get an M1 iMac?

33:19.560 --> 33:20.800
They got to make those somewhere, right?

33:20.800 --> 33:21.800
They have those.

33:21.800 --> 33:22.800
I'm Tim Cook's assistant.

33:22.800 --> 33:25.560
He's like, this letter is too long for me to type on my iPad.

33:25.560 --> 33:31.320
And here she's like, you know, you own a company that makes computers, right, bro?

33:31.320 --> 33:33.760
Just go downstairs and be like, I want a computer.

33:33.760 --> 33:34.760
One day.

33:34.760 --> 33:36.600
One day there'll be one probably that takes that much RAM.

33:36.600 --> 33:40.400
One day the CEO of one of the largest computer companies in the world will actually decide

33:40.400 --> 33:41.400
he likes computers.

33:41.400 --> 33:44.120
A boy can dream.

33:44.120 --> 33:45.120
They're still getting you to buy them.

33:45.120 --> 33:46.120
Oh.

33:46.120 --> 33:50.520
I thought we had agreed there'd be no more hate speech.

33:50.520 --> 33:53.640
So the price tag on this baby, $1,199.

33:53.640 --> 33:54.640
Okay.

33:54.640 --> 33:58.720
So it's coming in cheaper than the XPS 13 at that price.

33:58.720 --> 34:01.280
And I spilled coffee today and did not spill it on it.

34:01.280 --> 34:02.280
So you know.

34:02.280 --> 34:03.280
All right.

34:03.280 --> 34:05.960
Well, so here's the competition on the X86 side of stuff.

34:05.960 --> 34:09.240
I think Dell sent this into me for review.

34:09.240 --> 34:10.240
Yeah.

34:10.240 --> 34:14.140
And the easiest way to see these is just go to Dell.com slash Linux.

34:14.140 --> 34:19.320
They have like all of them there, but I will have a link to the very specific build in

34:19.320 --> 34:20.320
the show notes.

34:20.320 --> 34:25.380
And this is using the latest Tiger Lake 11th Gen CPU from Intel.

34:25.380 --> 34:29.440
This is a CPU they probably should have shipped a year ago, but I'll get more to that later.

34:29.440 --> 34:33.020
This thing can burst up to 4.2 gigahertz depending on the CPU.

34:33.020 --> 34:35.600
You can get it in I7 and I5 variants.

34:35.600 --> 34:39.000
The one that I got ships with Ubuntu 2004.

34:39.000 --> 34:45.240
And because it's the 11th Gen CPU, it has the Intel Iris Xe graphics.

34:45.240 --> 34:47.080
And we're going to talk more about that in a moment.

34:47.080 --> 34:51.880
This build had 16 gigs of RAM of low power DDR4, which is the stuff that lets you sleep

34:51.880 --> 34:54.400
for a long time and not take a bunch of battery power.

34:54.400 --> 34:58.800
It has a maximum possible config of 32 gigs of RAM.

34:58.800 --> 35:03.680
I got the 512 M.2 PCI MVME solid state disk in this one.

35:03.680 --> 35:07.020
It has a maximum possible of two terabytes.

35:07.020 --> 35:12.000
This also came equipped with the 1080p touchscreen, the edge to edge infinity display.

35:12.000 --> 35:16.400
It's a 1080p version instead of the 4K version.

35:16.400 --> 35:22.620
It is still touch and it's still beautiful, beautiful colors, super, super dense pixels.

35:22.620 --> 35:24.720
It's just really a gorgeous screen still.

35:24.720 --> 35:30.920
As configured from Dell with Linux preloaded $1,399.

35:30.920 --> 35:38.920
It is, I think, a premium prebuilt works out of the box at a reasonable price at that point.

35:38.920 --> 35:41.660
It really has a lot to kind of offer.

35:41.660 --> 35:45.760
To Dell's credit, they really jumped on that 11th Gen CPU when Intel finally got their

35:45.760 --> 35:50.280
act together and they've really developed something pretty nice here.

35:50.280 --> 35:53.040
They sent this one in the white housing to me.

35:53.040 --> 35:54.960
Ooh, that white housing is great.

35:54.960 --> 35:55.960
It's nice.

35:55.960 --> 35:56.960
Yeah.

35:56.960 --> 35:57.960
I don't know if I would have chosen it.

35:57.960 --> 36:00.720
If I was buying it for myself, I think I would have played it safe and just gone with boring

36:00.720 --> 36:03.920
old silver, but I'm really glad they sent me the white one.

36:03.920 --> 36:09.920
It's a matte white and then it's wrapped in that chamfered aluminum bottom that they have.

36:09.920 --> 36:15.620
And then the palm rest area for the Arctic white one, they call it a woven glass fiber

36:15.620 --> 36:17.200
palm rest.

36:17.200 --> 36:19.480
So I don't know if that's some sort of fiber plastic.

36:19.480 --> 36:21.920
I don't know what that is, but it feels good.

36:21.920 --> 36:22.920
It feels fine.

36:22.920 --> 36:25.800
The keyboard itself remains really good.

36:25.800 --> 36:32.680
It feels oversized for what it is because it's edge to edge on this XPS and it's plenty

36:32.680 --> 36:34.360
nice to type on.

36:34.360 --> 36:37.480
They have one of the better fingerprint readers on laptops.

36:37.480 --> 36:41.320
They got a nice pad that also acts as the power button and that, of course, fingerprint

36:41.320 --> 36:43.280
reader works under Ubuntu.

36:43.280 --> 36:47.800
And then the keyboard itself, because it's a white sort of chiclet style, but like an

36:47.800 --> 36:54.600
evolved more modern laptop chiclet style with a white backlight that kind of has a kind

36:54.600 --> 37:00.240
of a cool white glow look to it in the dark that impresses people when you show them the

37:00.240 --> 37:01.240
laptop.

37:01.240 --> 37:02.240
They go, oh, interesting.

37:02.240 --> 37:04.520
And the screen itself is wrapped in Gorilla Glass.

37:04.520 --> 37:05.920
I could still break it.

37:05.920 --> 37:06.920
Yeah.

37:06.920 --> 37:10.080
It's, you know, it's a little more durable than your average screen.

37:10.080 --> 37:12.240
They put a lot of engineering into the cooling, too.

37:12.240 --> 37:16.080
It's something that Dell really, really has worked on on their larger laptops, but they've

37:16.080 --> 37:19.400
brought some of that down to the XPS 13.

37:19.400 --> 37:26.520
It's got two kind of large for a laptop moving fans in this 13 inch housing, but because

37:26.520 --> 37:30.120
they're always moving slowly and the way they've routed the heat, you really never hear them

37:30.120 --> 37:31.120
kick in.

37:31.120 --> 37:38.440
I had this thing running machine learning benchmarks for nine hours straight and I could

37:38.440 --> 37:42.460
kind of hear the fans in my dead quiet office.

37:42.460 --> 37:44.000
So they do they do a really good job.

37:44.000 --> 37:45.520
It's got two USB-C ports.

37:45.520 --> 37:48.320
I think they're both Thunderbolt, although I only confirmed that on one of them.

37:48.320 --> 37:51.400
But you can charge with either one of them.

37:51.400 --> 37:56.960
And if your workload is Linux and you want to stick with X86 for a while, I think you

37:56.960 --> 38:04.840
need to understand what a game changer the 11th gen Intel Iris Xe graphics is.

38:04.840 --> 38:06.640
I screwed up, guys.

38:06.640 --> 38:12.920
I have buyer's remorse just a little bit with my X1 Carbon because it's a 10th gen CPU.

38:12.920 --> 38:21.240
And I put this XPS 13, which is an i5 up against my X1, which is an i7 in the machine learning

38:21.240 --> 38:25.720
benchmarks from OpenBenchmark.org, which is an entire suite of benchmarks.

38:25.720 --> 38:30.920
It, like I said, runs for nine hours and really pushes the machine in nearly every single

38:30.920 --> 38:34.840
way a machine learning workload could possibly push a machine.

38:34.840 --> 38:38.280
And these results, by the way, are public and will be in the show notes.

38:38.280 --> 38:41.960
And also, by the way, you can compare them directly to your machine.

38:41.960 --> 38:45.000
This is something that the Ferronix benchmark suite makes super easy.

38:45.000 --> 38:46.760
You don't even have to know how to use the tool.

38:46.760 --> 38:50.760
You just get it installed and then he'll tell you the command to run to compare it directly

38:50.760 --> 38:52.400
against the XPS 13.

38:52.400 --> 38:57.560
I put clean XPS 13 benchmarks up there and you can compare it apples to apples with your

38:57.560 --> 39:00.200
own machine to see what kind of upgrade you would get.

39:00.200 --> 39:03.980
And this thing shredded my X1.

39:03.980 --> 39:12.400
This i5 XPS 13 shredded my i7 ThinkPad in an embarrassingly every single category except

39:12.400 --> 39:15.320
for one insignificant category.

39:15.320 --> 39:19.920
This XPS 13 destroyed my brand new X1 Carbon.

39:19.920 --> 39:27.320
And then to make things even more insulting, you can actually play video games with this

39:27.320 --> 39:31.760
Intel's built in GPU.

39:31.760 --> 39:32.760
I'm not kidding you.

39:32.760 --> 39:33.760
I know they're not perfect.

39:33.760 --> 39:37.680
You know, they're medium quality, but I was able to play Tomb Raider, Rise of the Tomb

39:37.680 --> 39:38.680
Raider.

39:38.680 --> 39:42.560
I played CSGO and Hot Shot Racing, all games I'm currently playing on my ThinkPad that

39:42.560 --> 39:44.360
require the eGPU.

39:44.360 --> 39:47.040
I can play directly on the XPS 13.

39:47.040 --> 39:50.120
Now is that an Ubuntu Fedora difference?

39:50.120 --> 39:56.440
No, no, it's just that the 11th Gen like they Intel invested significantly like a bit in

39:56.440 --> 39:57.760
a big way.

39:57.760 --> 40:01.100
If you go Google search, I'll put some links in the show notes or go on YouTube.

40:01.100 --> 40:08.660
And if you look at the Intel Xe GPU, the whole like GPU nerd community is really excited

40:08.660 --> 40:09.820
about this thing.

40:09.820 --> 40:14.640
And then I guess in early 2021 Intel is actually going to launch a dedicated no, they're not

40:14.640 --> 40:15.640
discrete graphics.

40:15.640 --> 40:16.640
I know.

40:16.640 --> 40:18.920
That's no fucking chance.

40:18.920 --> 40:22.840
They claim it's happening this time, but I'll tell you what, what they've put, which is

40:22.840 --> 40:27.200
the lower end version, the low power version, the Xe LP is what they call it.

40:27.200 --> 40:33.320
They've put that in this laptop and I absolutely wish I would have held out for it because

40:33.320 --> 40:39.120
it means the games I'm currently playing right now with my kids that require the eGPU, I

40:39.120 --> 40:40.560
could play on the Intel.

40:40.560 --> 40:43.320
I didn't want to step all the way up to an embedded like Nvidia GPU.

40:43.320 --> 40:45.480
I didn't want that heat.

40:45.480 --> 40:49.540
And I'm just, if you're in the Intel market right now and you need a lean, mean, portable

40:49.540 --> 40:57.760
machine, this XPS 13 with an i5 build, you could crank this thing up a lot more than

40:57.760 --> 40:58.760
it is right now.

40:58.760 --> 41:01.640
And it's still destroying the last generation machine.

41:01.640 --> 41:07.120
And if nothing else, I think if you're going to buy on the Intel ecosystem in a laptop,

41:07.120 --> 41:09.400
you've got to get something 11th gen.

41:09.400 --> 41:10.960
The battery life is great.

41:10.960 --> 41:16.440
This is, like I'm saying, this is the CPU that Intel needed to release a year ago, minimum.

41:16.440 --> 41:17.840
It's really a shame.

41:17.840 --> 41:24.360
I'm not trying to claim it's the M1, but I could easily recommend this machine to anyone

41:24.360 --> 41:29.120
who wants a Linux box and feel very confident about that recommendation.

41:29.120 --> 41:30.860
It's an easy to recommend machine.

41:30.860 --> 41:35.800
And the fact that you can get this good of a machine with an i5 build so you can spend

41:35.800 --> 41:41.400
under $1,500 to get a premium Linux laptop, I think that's great.

41:41.400 --> 41:47.600
And it makes me wonder, because I think I recall the System76 Galago Pro being an 11th

41:47.600 --> 41:51.120
gen, it makes me wonder what the performance story is over there, too.

41:51.120 --> 41:57.560
I couldn't appreciate the improvement that the 11th gen Intel Tiger Lake CPUs brought

41:57.560 --> 41:59.040
until I tested one.

41:59.040 --> 42:04.840
And it's like Intel's finally making a decent stand here.

42:04.840 --> 42:07.840
And I could see in another year, this is going to be even better.

42:07.840 --> 42:09.240
But I don't know.

42:09.240 --> 42:10.800
For a lot of folks, it's probably too late.

42:10.800 --> 42:11.800
Because here you are.

42:11.800 --> 42:12.800
You're looking at that MacBook Air.

42:12.800 --> 42:13.800
That's cheaper.

42:13.800 --> 42:15.440
So I can understand.

42:15.440 --> 42:16.660
It's a difficult tug of war.

42:16.660 --> 42:22.000
But this is now the situation I think vendors like Dell find themselves in, right?

42:22.000 --> 42:25.520
Because they're going up against the MacBook Air.

42:25.520 --> 42:29.000
So for our little nerd community, we care about things like, can we game on it?

42:29.000 --> 42:31.560
Can we whatever, you know, TensorFlow, right?

42:31.560 --> 42:32.560
Right.

42:32.560 --> 42:36.600
So, minimally, you're going to be able to play a lot more actual games on this laptop

42:36.600 --> 42:37.940
than you would a MacBook Air.

42:37.940 --> 42:40.040
Because you could also dual-boot Windows on this.

42:40.040 --> 42:41.760
I used to work in the games industry.

42:41.760 --> 42:47.360
And when you're in the games industry, and you look at a Mac, then you begin to cry.

42:47.360 --> 42:48.360
Yeah.

42:48.360 --> 42:50.560
And then you go back to Windows, which is where you belong.

42:50.560 --> 42:51.560
Yeah.

42:51.560 --> 42:55.700
And Steam with Proton plays a ton more games than are available for Macs.

42:55.700 --> 42:57.080
So this is a portable game.

42:57.080 --> 42:59.760
This is a portable work machine that also can play some games.

42:59.760 --> 43:00.760
Age of Empires.

43:00.760 --> 43:02.400
And you're not going to have to listen to the fans while you're doing it.

43:02.400 --> 43:05.920
And they've done a pretty good job on the speakers with this one, too.

43:05.920 --> 43:08.960
They're not MacBook quality, but they're really pretty good.

43:08.960 --> 43:14.260
I kind of don't, I mean, I don't regret my purchase because ultimately what drove my

43:14.260 --> 43:19.840
purchase of the X1 Carbon was I wanted a 1440p screen.

43:19.840 --> 43:23.360
And this comes in either 1080p or 4K.

43:23.360 --> 43:28.720
If you could go back, then let's just say, you know, they're roughly the same price,

43:28.720 --> 43:29.720
right?

43:29.720 --> 43:31.200
Would you still pick the Carbon?

43:31.200 --> 43:32.360
I don't think so.

43:32.360 --> 43:38.360
You know, being able to play those games with my kids means the world to me.

43:38.360 --> 43:39.360
I get that completely.

43:39.360 --> 43:40.360
Yeah.

43:40.360 --> 43:41.360
Yeah.

43:41.360 --> 43:44.880
And this XPS 13 can do it without a huge eGPU attached to it.

43:44.880 --> 43:46.720
So that means anywhere we could do it.

43:46.720 --> 43:49.240
eGPU stuff is still kind of, you know.

43:49.240 --> 43:50.240
Yeah.

43:50.240 --> 43:52.880
I mean, I use it in the context of a dock mostly.

43:52.880 --> 43:57.080
And so it's a dock with a GPU, but it also means, hey, if we're going to game, we have

43:57.080 --> 43:58.560
to do it right here, right?

43:58.560 --> 44:02.000
With this XPS 13, we could literally do it anywhere.

44:02.000 --> 44:09.600
And that's without having to have a big, loud, hot, power hungry Nvidia GPU in there.

44:09.600 --> 44:16.080
And it also means, as for a Linux user, all that stuff, all of the driver code is open

44:16.080 --> 44:19.640
source and baked in to every single Linux distribution.

44:19.640 --> 44:20.640
It's true.

44:20.640 --> 44:21.640
Yeah.

44:21.640 --> 44:22.640
It's Intel.

44:22.640 --> 44:23.640
Yeah.

44:23.640 --> 44:24.640
Yeah.

44:24.640 --> 44:27.560
So it's a pretty reasonable, like again, like I put Tomb Raider on like medium settings

44:27.560 --> 44:32.600
and I noticed some graphical glitches that I don't see when I'm playing on a nicer AMD

44:32.600 --> 44:34.360
card or Nvidia card.

44:34.360 --> 44:38.440
And Hot Shot Racing and CSGO, they're not the most demanding games, but they're what

44:38.440 --> 44:40.120
I'm playing.

44:40.120 --> 44:41.560
And it worked.

44:41.560 --> 44:42.560
I was blown away.

44:42.560 --> 44:45.240
And it's an i5 and it just shredded the performance.

44:45.240 --> 44:49.800
In fact, so much so that I'm going to spend some time looking into my install and seeing

44:49.800 --> 44:53.600
if there's things I need to tune for my ThinkPad.

44:53.600 --> 44:54.600
For your carbon.

44:54.600 --> 44:55.600
Yeah.

44:55.600 --> 44:56.600
Yeah.

44:56.600 --> 45:02.520
It sounds like if we were to take the state of the world right now, and you're a developer

45:02.520 --> 45:08.400
looking for a premium laptop, so you're not going to Best Buy, because you're looking

45:08.400 --> 45:11.760
at the XPS 13, do they still call it Sputnik or no?

45:11.760 --> 45:14.360
I think they just refer to it as the developer edition now.

45:14.360 --> 45:21.000
Well, the XPS 13 developer edition, or I mean, I got to be honest with you, I don't understand

45:21.000 --> 45:28.280
why you would go with the MacBook Pro M1 at this point, because the Air, it's fine.

45:28.280 --> 45:31.080
It's probably one of the better laptops I've ever used.

45:31.080 --> 45:32.080
Yeah.

45:32.080 --> 45:37.280
And that no fan thing is not only nice right now, but in three or four years, there's no

45:37.280 --> 45:39.800
fan to get clogged up and get louder.

45:39.800 --> 45:41.000
I'm trying to be soft.

45:41.000 --> 45:44.680
It is, in fact, the best laptop I've ever used, now that I figured out how to fix my

45:44.680 --> 45:48.560
whole Ruby and Python tool chains didn't work for me thing.

45:48.560 --> 45:51.720
That seems like the only two real choices to me right now.

45:51.720 --> 45:56.800
I haven't used every Linux laptop out there, but this seems like one of the very best.

45:56.800 --> 45:58.760
And new stuff is coming out, right?

45:58.760 --> 46:01.160
System 76 has an AMD machine that's not out yet.

46:01.160 --> 46:03.440
That could be really interesting.

46:03.440 --> 46:06.800
I think the elementary guys have some kind of partnerships now, don't they?

46:06.800 --> 46:10.880
Yeah, and so is Kubuntu, but those are all kind of different.

46:10.880 --> 46:15.080
These are, what we're talking about here, and I have not tried the new Galgo Pro, because

46:15.080 --> 46:16.400
I think it has 11th gen.

46:16.400 --> 46:20.720
I have the, mine is too old for the 11th gen, so I couldn't tell you, yeah.

46:20.720 --> 46:26.400
What Dell really has here that seems like the unbeatable combo is the extremely high-end

46:26.400 --> 46:32.280
chassis that makes this thing feel kind of like a luxury product, and then that edge-to-edge

46:32.280 --> 46:35.040
Infinity display is just unmatched.

46:35.040 --> 46:38.480
They have one of the best displays out there, and then they have that edge-to-edge keyboard,

46:38.480 --> 46:44.880
which is kind of like their own custom-designed keyboard that I think is superior to the most

46:44.880 --> 46:48.400
of the other keyboards that are out there, other than ThinkPad keyboards and the new

46:48.400 --> 46:51.880
MacBook Pro Magic Keyboard.

46:51.880 --> 46:55.720
When you consider that, the premium build, the premium chassis, the premium screen, the

46:55.720 --> 47:01.520
premium keyboard, and the dual Thunderbolt interfaces, that's where the XPS 13 is kind

47:01.520 --> 47:02.520
of in a league of its own.

47:02.520 --> 47:07.240
I mean, my X1 Carbon has a lot of that, but it doesn't quite have the same build quality.

47:07.240 --> 47:09.960
It doesn't quite match it there.

47:09.960 --> 47:14.840
It doesn't have quite as nice of a screen, although I prefer my 2K resolution, my 1440

47:14.840 --> 47:16.360
1080p resolution.

47:16.360 --> 47:20.600
This is going to be one of the hardest review laptops I've ever sent back, definitely.

47:20.600 --> 47:22.960
Like I thought about, like, oh, bummer, I wish I would have stretched this out a little

47:22.960 --> 47:23.960
bit.

47:23.960 --> 47:25.200
So here's the plan.

47:25.200 --> 47:26.200
Here's the plan.

47:26.200 --> 47:27.200
What?

47:27.200 --> 47:29.600
Crack open a beer while you're working on the Carbon.

47:29.600 --> 47:30.600
Oops!

47:30.600 --> 47:36.720
Then have four or five more, and then all of a sudden, you need to keep the XPS, right?

47:36.720 --> 47:37.720
Right, right.

47:37.720 --> 47:41.280
I bet you if this thing had shipped with the 4K screen, I would not be able to play any

47:41.280 --> 47:42.280
of those games.

47:42.280 --> 47:44.800
You know, part of it was that it was a 1080p game load.

47:44.800 --> 47:45.800
1080p.

47:45.800 --> 47:46.800
Right.

47:46.800 --> 47:49.160
Well, that's the dirty little secret, you know.

47:49.160 --> 47:50.160
Yeah.

47:50.160 --> 47:55.040
And when I'm using the X1 Carbon for day-to-day, just like office task style work from home,

47:55.040 --> 47:59.640
I prefer the higher screen resolution, and I'm not really pushing the, I'm not even pushing

47:59.640 --> 48:01.000
that machine.

48:01.000 --> 48:03.240
So it's not a huge issue, but.

48:03.240 --> 48:06.860
And then when I go eGPU, I dramatically outperform the XPS 13.

48:06.860 --> 48:10.180
So it is funny, though.

48:10.180 --> 48:13.700
It's like the Intel stuff is kind of starting to get a little more serious.

48:13.700 --> 48:17.480
When you combine the Xe graphics with the fact that they're all open source and baked

48:17.480 --> 48:23.640
into Linux, so it makes the Linux workstation very smooth, it's like, oh, now you get interesting.

48:23.640 --> 48:26.560
Oh, fine, finally.

48:26.560 --> 48:30.120
But if you're a developer out there right now, and you're at a fork in the road, it's

48:30.120 --> 48:34.080
really hard to choose which direction to go, other than you got to just, I suppose, base

48:34.080 --> 48:35.080
it on your workload.

48:35.080 --> 48:41.120
And if it's a Linux workload, and primarily x86, and you need something lean, mean and

48:41.120 --> 48:44.520
mobile that could maybe even crank out a video game every now and then when you're on the

48:44.520 --> 48:49.020
go, if you can live with middle of the road settings, this is it.

48:49.020 --> 48:50.020
This is it.

48:50.020 --> 48:53.820
And that describes me to a T. And then you have the size factor.

48:53.820 --> 48:59.060
It's heavier than, I think, the X1 Carbon or other laptops because it's got that metal

48:59.060 --> 49:04.720
bottom and whatnot, but it's still super portable because it's so small.

49:04.720 --> 49:07.960
These damn laptops, sick of them.

49:07.960 --> 49:14.540
So I like how we've reset to our natural positions of, I'm on a Mac, and you're on Ubuntu.

49:14.540 --> 49:16.960
In a way, we're starting the year off in a traditional pattern.

49:16.960 --> 49:19.740
In a traditional pattern, yeah.

49:19.740 --> 49:21.520
But this is my current Linux recommend.

49:21.520 --> 49:27.120
If somebody's out there that's got a budget of $1,400, go to Dell.com slash Linux.

49:27.120 --> 49:32.680
There's no promos, no ad, this is a unit they sent me to review, and I got to give it to

49:32.680 --> 49:33.680
them.

49:33.680 --> 49:34.680
They nailed the developer workstation.

49:34.680 --> 49:38.440
You know, the other thing to consider is if you are in a corporate environment, sometimes

49:38.440 --> 49:43.600
they have agreements with Dell, and so you're not getting a MacBook anyways.

49:43.600 --> 49:44.600
That's a great way to go.

49:44.600 --> 49:52.840
Well, Mr. Dominic, I kind of have to go pour one out to say goodbye to this laptop.

49:52.840 --> 49:54.360
So we should probably wrap this thing up pretty soon.

49:54.360 --> 49:55.880
I think that's enough laptops for a few-

49:55.880 --> 49:56.960
I think it's enough laptops.

49:56.960 --> 50:02.520
I think just to wrap it up, we should always say, as we do at least once a month, quickly

50:02.520 --> 50:05.840
pour one out for sun.

50:05.840 --> 50:07.640
And see you all next week.

50:07.640 --> 50:09.440
I'm datdominucu on Twitter.

50:09.440 --> 50:10.440
There you go.

50:10.440 --> 50:12.400
Thank you, everybody, for tuning in to this week's episode.

50:12.400 --> 50:13.520
I'm at Chris Last.

50:13.520 --> 50:15.220
The podcast network is at Jupiter Signal.

50:15.220 --> 50:17.240
The show is at Coder Radio Show.

50:17.240 --> 50:18.800
Thank you to our Coder QA team.

50:18.800 --> 50:23.480
A new Coderly report is out for you in the feed or available as a download.

50:23.480 --> 50:26.680
You can get that at coderqa.co if you're not already a member.

50:26.680 --> 50:32.240
Links to what we talked about today, while those are over at coder.show slash 395.

50:32.240 --> 50:34.240
You can also find our contact form there.

50:34.240 --> 50:35.240
That's a big part of our show.

50:35.240 --> 50:38.800
Tell us a little bit about your workload and the stack that you're doing it on.

50:38.800 --> 50:41.040
You'll also find our RSS feed and all of that over there.

50:41.040 --> 50:45.120
And then last but not least, oh my goodness, how could I almost forget?

50:45.120 --> 50:46.880
You've got to join us live.

50:46.880 --> 50:47.880
It's so much fun.

50:47.880 --> 50:48.880
It's the Coder Happy Hour.

50:48.880 --> 50:54.720
Starts out 5 p.m. Pacific, 8 p.m. Eastern at jblive.tv, and then it rolls right into the

50:54.720 --> 50:55.720
show.

50:55.720 --> 50:56.720
Tux and Rolls.

50:56.720 --> 51:05.720
We'll be back here next week.
