00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,920
This is KOTORadio, episode 423, recorded on July 16, 2021.

2
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:20,040
Hello friend and welcome in to Jupiter Broadcasting's weekly talk show, taking a pragmatic look

3
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:24,120
at the art and the business of software development and the world of technology.

4
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:27,040
This episode is brought to you by our friends at a cloud guru, you know, they now have that

5
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:28,040
cloud playground.

6
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:33,320
Mm hmm, Azure, AWS and Google Cloud sandboxes on ACG's credit card, not yours.

7
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:37,040
Get certified, get hired, get learning at a cloud guru.com.

8
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:40,980
My name is Chris and recording for a limited time.

9
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:42,720
It's our host from Florida, Mr. Dominic.

10
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:43,720
Hello, Mike.

11
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:44,720
Hello, Mr. Fisher.

12
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:45,960
How are you feeling?

13
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:47,120
Is everything all boxed up?

14
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:49,320
Are you like in reduced living mode right now?

15
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:56,600
Not yet, but this weekend is going to be a hell of a weekend boxing up and yeah, I hate

16
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:57,600
that.

17
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,120
I've been working so much.

18
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:03,240
If I was like big money, I would probably hire somebody to pack for me.

19
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:06,480
But you look at the cost of something like that, I just can't justify it.

20
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:07,480
It's it's crazy.

21
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:08,480
I actually looked at it.

22
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:12,280
I'm like, this is this is like spilling a drink on a MacBook a week.

23
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:17,120
Yeah, that is that should be a unit of accounting actually, now that I think about it.

24
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:20,760
Did you see Qualcomm this week was posting that they've got something in house that's

25
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:25,440
going to blow the pants off of the M1 and that they have plans to compete with Apple

26
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:27,640
Silicon in PCs.

27
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:28,640
Qualcomm's gonna save us.

28
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:31,080
They're gonna save us from our six color tyranny.

29
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:32,080
Okay.

30
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:33,080
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

31
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:37,640
Yeah, they're gonna come in here and they're gonna come in with chips that are gonna save

32
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:39,940
us by the end of 2021.

33
00:01:39,940 --> 00:01:42,840
Maybe you know, depending on delays 2023.

34
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:49,520
I don't know, man, I just I guess I'm getting kind of bitter or cynical.

35
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:51,520
Maybe that's the way to put it bitter and cynical.

36
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:53,760
I've lost the faith in Qualcomm.

37
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:54,760
They've done me wrong.

38
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:56,160
I've I've had some systems.

39
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:59,480
I've had some phones that had Qualcomm chips and they're supposed to be screamers and they

40
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:02,200
just were pathetic.

41
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:05,160
We'll see if they do it.

42
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:08,160
I'm sure you'll get one though.

43
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:11,080
I have some consultation that I'm going to need from you later.

44
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:13,400
I'm gonna need you to walk me off of the ledge a little bit.

45
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,400
Oh boy.

46
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:19,300
But before we get there, we should probably get to some feedback because our discussion

47
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:22,360
around Copilot provoked some emails.

48
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:23,360
Yes.

49
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:27,720
Varatunda thinks that Microsoft has finally figured out how to kill open source with Copilot.

50
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:32,000
He says, I was listening to Coder 422 and your musings over Copilot.

51
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,960
He touched on the idea of licensing washing, but I don't know if you went far enough and

52
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:38,560
he links us to something that Software Conservancy wrote up.

53
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:42,440
Varatunda goes on to say discusses who is not in charge of open source and how responsibility

54
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:46,460
can be abdicated for a variety of reasons, and that the biggest threat to the GPL or

55
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:50,060
any free software license is actually just the enforcement of it.

56
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:54,240
For a licensed account, like a trademark, it has to be enforced rigorously.

57
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:59,200
So the real threat from Copilot is not just copying GPL code by mistake, but that copying

58
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:05,680
would be automated and wholesale and making it impossible to catch and impossible to enforce.

59
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:10,400
Suddenly you have thousands and thousands of products exploiting GPL code, but no resources

60
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,900
available to enforce those violations.

61
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:14,640
This is what has me worried.

62
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:20,040
If you wanted to kill open source, you don't have to kill the GPL, you just have to nullify

63
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:21,040
it.

64
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:25,000
Call me a cynic, but I have to say I'm genuinely worried that Microsoft has finally figured

65
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:30,480
out how to kill open source, not by extending or embracing it, though they seem to really

66
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:35,280
heart Linux, but by making it irrelevant because no one can enforce the license to make sure

67
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,520
the code remains free for everyone.

68
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:40,760
You don't need to kill the kernel if you can break all the tools that surround it with

69
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:41,960
impudence.

70
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:43,520
It could be a dark future.

71
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:46,520
I guess I have an even more sadly cynical view.

72
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:49,480
I think people are already ripping off the GPL left and right.

73
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:50,480
Sure.

74
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:51,920
Probably is happening quite a lot, right?

75
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:55,380
Even if they're just kind of using it to get ideas and then writing their own versions

76
00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:56,380
of it.

77
00:03:56,380 --> 00:03:59,200
It's probably happening, but this seems like it could be a whole new scale.

78
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,200
Right.

79
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:04,200
And so the idea here is that just the pure quantity, the pure scale of it would make

80
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:06,760
enforcement like Don financially viable.

81
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:07,760
I think so.

82
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:10,720
And then if you can't enforce the GPL, it essentially becomes worthless.

83
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:11,720
I mean, I don't know.

84
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:13,600
You know, I've never been a GPL hippie.

85
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:20,080
I kind of, I always wondered if people who have GPL software, if you find out someone's

86
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:25,240
using it and they're like a rinky dink, you know, they don't have any resources, whatever.

87
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:26,640
What are you really going to do about that?

88
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:27,960
Especially if you're a small shop.

89
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:28,960
Right.

90
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:29,960
It's like Microsoft is using your stuff.

91
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:34,520
Well, then you probably want to negotiate a license, get some money, but right.

92
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:38,880
But if you're a small shop and another small shop is using your code, like are you even

93
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:41,040
going to bother with the lawyer fees on that one?

94
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,040
I don't know.

95
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:45,720
Well, what if it's like an independent developer, like one guy or one gal?

96
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:46,720
Right.

97
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:49,040
You'd basically be choosing to wreck them, but of course they are choosing to violate

98
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,040
the license.

99
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,040
That's a tough call.

100
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,720
It doesn't feel like there's a good answer there.

101
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:56,080
Well, it doesn't feel like you'll make a return either.

102
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,080
Right.

103
00:04:57,080 --> 00:05:03,040
Alexander writes in, he's disappointed in Copilot for a whole number of reasons.

104
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:06,200
After listening to the episode, he said he wanted to share his two cents.

105
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:09,400
He says, I'm a professional software developer, but I think I have a biased view probably

106
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:15,120
because of my experience, but I am disappointed in GitHub, Alexander writes.

107
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,200
And here's a number of reasons.

108
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:21,380
Number one, it has learned to code by observing code in open source projects.

109
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:25,320
You know, the code that's probably full of bugs and security vulnerabilities already,

110
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:27,200
but Copilot doesn't know that.

111
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:30,520
So it's just going to suggest happily a buggy implementation.

112
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:33,520
Number two, what about dependency management?

113
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:36,360
Let's say one tries to use Copilot for Python web development.

114
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:40,440
Now imagine that project solves two tasks, which are typically solved by two different

115
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:41,920
web frameworks.

116
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:46,000
Under normal circumstance, you'd choose a single framework and use it for both tasks.

117
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,560
But I suspect that Copilot will produce code using two different frameworks, which won't

118
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:53,000
play well together at all.

119
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,860
And then there's that licensing thing.

120
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:58,980
Number three, Copilot does not attribute the produced code.

121
00:05:58,980 --> 00:06:04,080
So one may just unknowingly include code from, say, open JDK.

122
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:06,300
And I'm sure Oracle will be so understanding about that.

123
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:11,040
And number four, and he says this is probably my most biased point, but Copilot actually

124
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:16,220
tackles the most interesting and creative part of software development.

125
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:19,600
Why not have it focus on code review instead?

126
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:23,500
It'll be helpful to have a bot that finds code smells, inefficient implementations,

127
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:25,920
and a lack of test coverage for extreme cases.

128
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:31,280
Why not invent tools to automatically create reproducers from users' bug reports?

129
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:35,260
You know, like a bot that tries to find the best minimal number of steps to reproduce

130
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:36,260
a bug.

131
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:38,880
That, that would be invaluable.

132
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:41,640
Why not tackle automatic issue triaging?

133
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:46,880
Summing it all up, surely professional developers are not going to use this in an existing project.

134
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:50,600
Surely the non-professional developers won't use this in a new project.

135
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:54,240
And the hobbyist developers, well, you're going to find them just constantly reviewing

136
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,720
code instead of writing it.

137
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:58,280
And for newbie developers, well, absolutely not.

138
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:02,360
You just entered the field, having a tool that produces a stream of bugs that you'll

139
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:06,560
spend days trying to figure out is unhelpful, and it's even demotivating.

140
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:11,440
There has to be something different out there, and Copilot still requires developer input.

141
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:13,280
So I think it's not a good product.

142
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:16,920
It's a good scientific experiment in machine learning, and I suppose it's that, but it's

143
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:18,200
not a product.

144
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:22,920
I'm afraid it's yet another instance of we built it because we can, but we didn't think

145
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:23,920
if we should.

146
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:27,680
Thanks and sorry for the rant, Alexander.

147
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:31,720
I'm just having a hard time getting my hackles up about this Copilot thing.

148
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:32,880
Some people definitely are though.

149
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:33,880
Yeah.

150
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:34,880
You know, they're upset.

151
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:35,880
Yeah, it's interesting.

152
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:40,140
It is to me, because what I'm trying to do is I'm trying to take the input from the audience

153
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:44,560
and be like, okay, is this a big concern?

154
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:49,280
And I think they're starting to turn my opinion, but I'm still not super riled up about it.

155
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:51,280
Okay, so what is turning your opinion from last week?

156
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:52,560
That's probably a great way to take this.

157
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:55,160
Well, I really liked what Alexander just said there.

158
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:59,920
Like, wouldn't it have been so much more useful if it was doing code review or if it could

159
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:03,840
help automate reproducing user bug reports?

160
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:07,640
Imagine how actually useful that would be for just about all developers.

161
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:09,600
Yeah, but that's a harder sell.

162
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:14,880
Code review often includes things like style and following, you know, whatever the internal

163
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:19,060
methodology at your organization.

164
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:22,160
How could a Copilot do that in a generic way?

165
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,920
Yeah, it'd have to be tuned for each.

166
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:24,920
Yeah, you're right.

167
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:25,920
That would be tricky.

168
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:26,920
Mm hmm.

169
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:27,920
Yeah.

170
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:28,920
Yeah.

171
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:32,480
I think they are starting to convince me, though, that it's it's sort of a misconceived

172
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:35,380
science experiment and not so much a product.

173
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:37,600
That's sort of where I'm shifting there.

174
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:42,960
And I do kind of see Varitunda's point about potentially enabling license washing at like

175
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:44,340
a massive scale.

176
00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:46,820
And that that seems like that could be an issue.

177
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:49,800
But that's one of those that we just won't know if it's a real problem until we're a

178
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:50,800
year down the road.

179
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:54,360
I mean, I just feel like this is one of these things that's going to get a lot of hype.

180
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:58,240
In reality, it's not going to be used by like serious people very much at all.

181
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,240
Yeah.

182
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:00,240
Yeah.

183
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,920
Or it's the future of programing.

184
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:02,920
Or that.

185
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:03,920
Yes.

186
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:04,920
Or that.

187
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:05,920
Yeah.

188
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:06,920
Yeah.

189
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:07,920
Yeah.

190
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:08,920
All right.

191
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:11,080
Well, Chuck wrote in about solving sleepless nights, which is something that you and I

192
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:12,560
have been struggling with recently.

193
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:13,720
Oh, yes.

194
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:15,600
And just just had a little bit last night.

195
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,120
Just regarding your insomnia.

196
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:20,320
I have a strategy that has been working for me lately.

197
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:25,080
My pebble classic misfit sleep and deep sleep numbers tell me that I'm getting about, you

198
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:27,280
know, six hours on average.

199
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:28,280
Some nights it's bad.

200
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:29,960
It's like two hours.

201
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:31,440
And I try to get all that in one block.

202
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:34,360
And recently I've been waking up after three or four hours.

203
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:35,400
I'm just up.

204
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:38,640
What happens is I'm wide awake and I have trouble getting back to sleep.

205
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:39,640
Yeah.

206
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:40,640
Yep.

207
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:43,520
So he found this YouTube channel called Direction Phil.

208
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:46,520
I'm saying it wrong, but I have a link in the show notes.

209
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:48,320
And but here's the idea.

210
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:55,160
It's a military naval historian that just speaks in a really monotone tone the entire

211
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:56,160
time.

212
00:09:56,160 --> 00:10:00,700
And it's he says the key is and I completely agree with Chuck here.

213
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:05,920
The key is to get in on a topic that, you know, you're kind of interested in, but has

214
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:08,960
nothing to do with your work or life.

215
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:12,360
So it doesn't trigger like any stressors, doesn't make you think about things you got

216
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:13,360
to do.

217
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:18,240
And it's complicated enough that it keeps your attention, but you can also just sort

218
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:21,280
of drift out and listen to it again and again and again.

219
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:25,000
He says maybe you might be into lectures or something like that, you know, like stuff

220
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,640
like Galileo orbiting Jupiter.

221
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:30,560
He says you go find the lecture you like on YouTube and then use YouTube DL to download

222
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:33,440
it as an MP3 or something like that and throw it on your phone.

223
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:36,480
Yo ho ho, a pirate's life for me.

224
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:40,520
This is what I use Audible for.

225
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:46,880
Just this morning I woke up at three o'clock, which I'm sure you can hear in my voice, audience.

226
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:47,880
Band problems.

227
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:50,800
We need to have a special like stinger jingle for it.

228
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:54,360
Groups for old, you know, online support group for old men or men that are becoming old men

229
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:57,880
and then having the existential crisis that they're realizing they're getting older.

230
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:59,500
That's the support group I need right now.

231
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:01,200
The problem is more the realization, right?

232
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,200
Right.

233
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:04,880
Because I told my mom, you know, I'm like, you know, I'm starting to realize like getting

234
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:05,980
older sucks.

235
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:09,460
And my mom looked at me and she's like, oh, child, you are so young still.

236
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:11,340
You have no idea.

237
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:17,040
And I'm like, yes, I realize I hopefully, hopefully still have a while a ways to go.

238
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:21,120
But it is no doubt in my mind that I have come to the point where I'm realizing, oh,

239
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:23,920
I am getting older and things are changing.

240
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:26,440
And I think like my eyesight's changing.

241
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:29,980
Obviously a lot of other things have changed and it's just sleep is one of them.

242
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:37,400
And so I have tried to employ this with Audible where I'll try to get a book that keeps my

243
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:39,680
interest enough, but not so much that I can't fall asleep.

244
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:41,240
It's a tricky line to walk.

245
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:44,060
I like the idea of adding YouTube to the mix.

246
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:47,760
Something else that I've done, which I don't think is good, but just makes me feel like

247
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:50,440
I'm in control a little bit is I'll just get up and work.

248
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:56,280
And I know I shouldn't, but honestly, at least then I'm productive with that time.

249
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:58,420
And as you know, no one's up, right?

250
00:11:58,420 --> 00:12:00,320
So it's quiet.

251
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,240
It's surprisingly a productive amount of time.

252
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:05,440
But the issue is, is that I'm just wrecked for like the next two days.

253
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:10,600
I really, it takes me a while to bounce back now, you know, that's what I'm going through

254
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:11,600
right now.

255
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:14,040
I was like, I was up at three o'clock or it was 3.30 actually.

256
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:19,520
So I, you know, I got up, I couldn't get back to sleep and I had a choice.

257
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:24,180
I have a bottle of Zequil, but now that's late enough that if you take the Zequil, which

258
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:27,960
for those who don't know, it's like NyQuil without the medicine parts, just sleeping

259
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:33,720
whatever, you're going to be like, there's no hangover like a NyQuil hangover.

260
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:34,720
It's terrible.

261
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,040
You're going to be so groggy.

262
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:37,040
Yeah.

263
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:38,520
You got to take that like eight, nine o'clock at night.

264
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:41,000
Eight, nine o'clock, 7.30 maximum.

265
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Yeah.

266
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Okay.

267
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
That's probably safe.

268
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,960
So then staring at me is my MacBook Air and it's like, you don't, you do have a bunch

269
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:49,520
of Python to write.

270
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:52,760
And I was like, Oh God.

271
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:54,040
So there I went.

272
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:55,040
Yeah.

273
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:58,520
That's sort of been my, it's like, there's a lot of people that are waiting for responses

274
00:12:58,520 --> 00:12:59,520
from me.

275
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:02,320
There's things that are like for this road trip that are coming up that are pending until

276
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:06,840
I can get to them and every time we get to a phase in the planning for this road trip

277
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:12,280
where something is waiting on me, it stresses me out because I've got like two weeks or

278
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:17,320
so before I'm leaving and there's just not enough time and we're going to have swag on

279
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:20,640
the road trip and we're going to have a website that goes live and we have a live tracker

280
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:22,640
and we have people that are joining us at the meetup.

281
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:26,280
We have like special guests that are coming in and we're getting like their flights taken

282
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:28,320
care of and all of this stuff, right?

283
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:34,440
And at each kind of major phase, something gets held up on me waiting and I legitimately

284
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:39,740
can't respond to the stuff and answer the stuff while I'm recording, which happens like

285
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:40,740
five times a week.

286
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:42,760
So like it's tricky.

287
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:43,760
It really isn't.

288
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:46,880
So when I'm up late, sometimes I just bang out a whole bunch of emails.

289
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:50,640
I'll just do a whole bunch of emails or I'll work on the website that we need for the road

290
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:51,640
trip.

291
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:54,680
I'll just do something like that that I just never get uninterrupted time for.

292
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:59,960
I'm not always going to employ this strategy, but while I'm busy and things are on my mind,

293
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:01,360
I'm just going to use the time for that.

294
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,160
But I really like the suggestion, Chuck.

295
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:07,200
I like the idea of that military history YouTube channel.

296
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:11,640
I will throw a link to that in the show notes because I went over to that channel this morning

297
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:13,880
and checked it out and I like it.

298
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:16,400
I think, you know, that stuff's kind of kind of cool.

299
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:22,120
And he included a link to a naval ship that was built here in the Seattle area way back

300
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:23,120
forever.

301
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:26,600
Kind of neat, very cool.

302
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:28,360
Meetup.com slash Jupiter Broadcasting.

303
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:34,040
We have two meetups, Salt Lake City on August 7th and in Denver on August 20th.

304
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:38,160
There's going to be swag and goodies and some of your favorite J.B. members will be at some

305
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:39,160
of these events.

306
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:40,160
We'd love to see you.

307
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:43,240
I'll also have a tracker at ColonyTracker.live.

308
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:46,840
That's ColonyTracker.live and that's all up and going.

309
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:49,280
That little tracker page will have a meetup link on there and stuff.

310
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:54,640
If you want to do a micro meetup with us along the way, that's something we'll be doing too.

311
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:58,880
The whole idea really for this road trip was there's been no events for a long time.

312
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:04,480
The last event I went to was Texas Cyber Summit which was a stinker and I really wanted to

313
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:09,520
just get out there and say hi to people again and recapture what is really out there in

314
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:14,760
the real world because we just live this very skewed reality online all the time between

315
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:18,360
what you see on YouTube and social media and just chat rooms and whatnot.

316
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:21,600
It's sort of a skewed version of reality and getting out there and seeing the audience

317
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:27,420
again sort of resets my brain, makes me realize that it's not the end of the world because

318
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:28,420
of the M1.

319
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:31,640
And then additionally, it's really about getting to see some of our team members that we haven't

320
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:34,640
got to see since Jupiter Broadcasting went independent.

321
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:39,200
So it's a big Colony reunion and we'll have more details soon but meetup.com slash Jupiter

322
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:44,520
Broadcasting is where you go to get the details about the meetups that are coming up and let

323
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:47,960
us know if you can make it.

324
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:51,740
And let's thank Linode, linode.com slash coder.

325
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:55,200
They are making this Colony reunion road trip possible.

326
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:58,960
They started in 2003 as one of the first companies in cloud computing because they were just

327
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:02,600
geeking out about the technology that was landing in Linux.

328
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:06,400
That's three years before the other enterprise providers and they're still independently

329
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:10,960
owned and founded on that love for Linux and contributing that back to the community.

330
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:14,540
That's one of the reasons they're making the Jupiter Colony reunion road trip possible

331
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:16,960
with our meetups in Salt Lake City and Denver.

332
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:21,640
All of that is powered by Linode and everything that we've built since we've gone independent,

333
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:26,520
we host that on Linode and if we ever run into any trouble or if you ever have any trouble,

334
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:31,780
Linode comes with amazing fantastic 24-7 customer phone support or ticket support if that's

335
00:16:31,780 --> 00:16:32,780
your preference.

336
00:16:32,780 --> 00:16:37,300
They'll help you, they'll get it settled regardless if you have one Linode or you have a hundred,

337
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:38,400
they're going to take care of you.

338
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:42,980
They also have hundreds of guides and tutorials to make sure you can get the best out of Linode.

339
00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:46,600
Anything you want to run in the cloud, anything that you can virtualize or run on a Linux

340
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:49,120
box, you're going to have a great experience with Linode.

341
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:54,100
They have super fast systems, great great native SSD speeds, 40 gigabit connections

342
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:59,460
coming into the different networks, 11 data centers worldwide, they own the links between

343
00:16:59,460 --> 00:17:06,060
their data centers, they are their own ISP, their high-end CPU boxes have AMD epic processors,

344
00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:11,600
they have blazing fast S3 compatible object storage, cloud firewalls and simple one-click

345
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:13,240
application deployments.

346
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:17,800
All of it comes together to make Linode a truly best of class experience.

347
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:21,520
When you want the highest performance and the best ability, when you want to give your

348
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:25,280
customers or your users a fantastic experience, Linode.

349
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:29,000
And Linode can also be part of your multi cloud strategy, that can be a huge advantage

350
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,860
for a lot of companies, Linode will snap in with your infrastructure management tools

351
00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:36,560
like Kubernetes and Terraform, make all of that just hum for you.

352
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:40,260
That's why there's so many routes and options you can go from a total newbie who's never

353
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:45,480
built anything before to somebody who's deploying servers at scale, Linode can be a solution

354
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:46,520
for you.

355
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:51,500
They really managed to pull it off, but you got to see it to actually have it click.

356
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:56,680
So I want you to go right now to linode.com slash coder, get $100 in 60 day credit on

357
00:17:56,680 --> 00:18:00,760
your new account and you support the show and you can try out all this stuff I'm talking

358
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:02,760
about and see what works for you.

359
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:06,980
You're going to be really impressed with their interface to manage all of this, the capabilities,

360
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:10,000
the speed and if you ever do need it, the support.

361
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,980
It really is the ultimate hosting package and it gives me peace of mind knowing that

362
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:18,840
my back end infrastructure for our listeners is running up on Linode, linode.com slash

363
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:22,320
coder.

364
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:30,180
So Microsoft has announced Windows 365, which provides an instant on boot experience with

365
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:35,720
cloud PCs managed fully by Microsoft.

366
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:42,860
They say the instant access lets workers stream Windows with either a web browser or an application

367
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:47,400
to their Mac, iPad, Linux machine and Android devices.

368
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:51,200
You pick up right where you left off because the state of your cloud PC always remains

369
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:55,360
the same even when you switch devices.

370
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:58,740
They create a virtual PC for you in the cloud.

371
00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:03,940
You customize it how you like with how much RAM, up to 16 gigs of RAM and up to 512 gigabytes

372
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:07,980
of disk and then those customizations persist.

373
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:11,260
The interface, anything you tweak up there persists.

374
00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:15,940
The company has built it on top of its Azure virtual desktop platform so it can also snap

375
00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:19,660
in with any of the administration that your company might have with Azure and Azure Active

376
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:25,420
Directory i.e. when they create you an account now, they can automatically just provision

377
00:19:25,420 --> 00:19:29,020
you a virtual PC standard by their image.

378
00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:35,980
Microsoft will be launching Windows 365 on August 2nd, 2021 to a business of any size.

379
00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:42,020
It is officially here, the Windows experience in the cloud managed by Microsoft designed

380
00:19:42,020 --> 00:19:45,660
to run on any device, even a web browser.

381
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:48,500
I kind of think this is a great deal for Linux users.

382
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:50,780
Yeah, I didn't think of it in terms of Linux users.

383
00:19:50,780 --> 00:19:55,180
I was thinking more in terms of the enterprise, but I'm curious, what's the angle there?

384
00:19:55,180 --> 00:19:59,260
Well, imagine you got a guy like yourself, right, where you got a Thaleo system, you've

385
00:19:59,260 --> 00:20:04,460
invested quite a bit in the Linux ecosystem and Linux hardware, but you have these jobs

386
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:08,540
that come up that just require Windows.

387
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:10,540
This now is your solution.

388
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:14,700
For some low monthly rate, you can have a couple of these virtual PCs up in the cloud

389
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:19,140
that anyone on your team can log into with all of your development tools and your environment

390
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:24,140
already set good to go and it remains there ready for you to access at any point in time.

391
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:25,140
All you need is a web browser.

392
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:28,460
You want to do it from your iPad, have at it Haas, you know, you want to do it from

393
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:33,020
your Thaleo desktop, have at it and it means you can just stay on Linux in this theoretical

394
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:36,540
world and when you do need Windows, you have it on demand now.

395
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:40,020
Kind of like having the Mac Colo, only this is clearly a better solution.

396
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:41,020
Oh, interesting.

397
00:20:41,020 --> 00:20:42,020
Yeah, that does make sense.

398
00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:46,980
I was thinking for enterprises that don't want to give people, particularly in the work

399
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:51,340
from home world, like computers that have their data on it, give them one of these and

400
00:20:51,340 --> 00:20:53,980
then you can revoke it once the person's not with the company.

401
00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:56,140
That's probably got to be one of the biggest use cases.

402
00:20:56,140 --> 00:20:57,900
Work from home, secure PC.

403
00:20:57,900 --> 00:20:59,620
Or even contract employees.

404
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:00,620
Right.

405
00:21:00,620 --> 00:21:01,620
Yeah.

406
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:05,100
And you know, I could see a lot of office spaces that don't even want to bother with

407
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:07,420
any local physical hardware.

408
00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:12,140
I've seen a couple of companies in the last few years that have really no land to speak

409
00:21:12,140 --> 00:21:13,140
of.

410
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:15,780
I've even went into a company that doesn't even have Ethernet.

411
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:19,100
They just have Wi-Fi and they have no file server.

412
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:21,520
They have no domain controller.

413
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:22,660
Everything is cloud based.

414
00:21:22,660 --> 00:21:27,860
The users come to the office, they get on the Wi-Fi and then all of their login stuff,

415
00:21:27,860 --> 00:21:29,780
everything is through the cloud.

416
00:21:29,780 --> 00:21:30,780
Interesting.

417
00:21:30,780 --> 00:21:31,780
Why not now?

418
00:21:31,780 --> 00:21:32,780
Why not the whole PC?

419
00:21:32,780 --> 00:21:33,780
Right.

420
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:36,500
And I'm assuming you can roll back states with this so that you're not, you know.

421
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:37,500
I would think.

422
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:38,500
Yeah.

423
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:39,500
If something bad happens.

424
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:40,500
Yeah.

425
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:42,820
It seems like this was a long time coming.

426
00:21:42,820 --> 00:21:44,580
This was foretold by the ancients.

427
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:45,580
Yeah.

428
00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:50,340
Like this isn't a shocker, but it is, I don't know, for some reason it still did kind of

429
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:51,900
catch me by surprise, I would say.

430
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:56,900
And I think a part of, although not, I guess in retrospect, not too surprising is how hard

431
00:21:56,900 --> 00:22:02,460
they're leaning in on like the iPad and Linux angle on this, like all of their official

432
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:04,300
documentation and all of it talks about it.

433
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:06,420
Like, yeah, run Windows on your iPad.

434
00:22:06,420 --> 00:22:07,820
Like is that, is that a huge-

435
00:22:07,820 --> 00:22:09,340
Well, Microsoft loves iPad.

436
00:22:09,340 --> 00:22:13,420
It just seems like a weird, that seems like a weird thing to lean into in their announcement.

437
00:22:13,420 --> 00:22:18,020
Like clearly your use case that you just outlined, Windows shops that are just going to deploy

438
00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:22,780
virtual Windows is going to by far be the vast use case for this.

439
00:22:22,780 --> 00:22:23,780
Right.

440
00:22:23,780 --> 00:22:24,780
Right.

441
00:22:24,780 --> 00:22:27,380
I mean, yeah, I guess it's, I guess it's buzzworthy.

442
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:29,020
I guess it gets headlines written.

443
00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:30,020
That must be part of it.

444
00:22:30,020 --> 00:22:31,020
Yeah.

445
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:32,020
I don't know.

446
00:22:32,020 --> 00:22:34,900
I think this is going to be pretty much an enterprise tool, but I like it.

447
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:35,900
Would you try it?

448
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:36,900
Yeah.

449
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:37,900
Would I try it?

450
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:38,900
Maybe.

451
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:43,900
I mean, I just took a look at shells.com or I think it's just shells.

452
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:44,900
Similar idea.

453
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:45,900
Pretty cool.

454
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:46,900
They do mostly Linux stuff.

455
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:51,020
I don't know, I bought enough hard drive space that I can just dual boot, right?

456
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:53,760
This is going to be a first party managed experience though, right?

457
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:55,660
Like Microsoft in theory could-

458
00:22:55,660 --> 00:22:56,660
Oh yeah.

459
00:22:56,660 --> 00:22:57,660
They can optimize.

460
00:22:57,660 --> 00:22:58,660
Right.

461
00:22:58,660 --> 00:23:01,380
And they're using RDP on the backend here, which is I think probably better than what

462
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:04,900
you're going to see with shells because shells is using a spice and then they're bringing

463
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:05,900
that into the browser.

464
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:07,080
And it's good.

465
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:11,940
It's a pretty good experience for what it is, but it's not as performant as RDP is.

466
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:12,940
You seem, all right.

467
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:13,940
Yeah.

468
00:23:13,940 --> 00:23:14,940
You seem pretty hot on it.

469
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:15,940
I mean, I think in the enterprise this would be great, right?

470
00:23:15,940 --> 00:23:19,460
You don't want to give someone a PC and you want to control it.

471
00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:21,580
I see absolutely nothing wrong with it.

472
00:23:21,580 --> 00:23:22,580
Yeah.

473
00:23:22,580 --> 00:23:23,580
Well, because you know what?

474
00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:28,340
For me, I've always felt like the best way to use Windows is in a virtual environment.

475
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:31,180
In a contained space, it's not your primary desktop.

476
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:32,460
You access it when you need it.

477
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:35,920
If something goes wrong, you can revert a snapshot.

478
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:39,660
Like even when I want to run, if I've ever wanted to run a Windows server, I'd run it

479
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:41,860
under virtualization.

480
00:23:41,860 --> 00:23:43,820
It's like an insurance policy for me.

481
00:23:43,820 --> 00:23:46,260
I prefer this over on the bare metal.

482
00:23:46,260 --> 00:23:51,340
Well, and a good dev angle here too is testing on different Windows configs.

483
00:23:51,340 --> 00:23:52,900
That is definitely something I would look into.

484
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:54,900
What do you think of the name?

485
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:55,900
Windows 365?

486
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:56,900
No, whatever.

487
00:23:56,900 --> 00:23:59,940
You know, everything's got to be 365 now with them.

488
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:00,940
I guess.

489
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:01,940
Does that mean it's cloud now?

490
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:02,940
Is that their thing?

491
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:04,260
If it's 365, it's the cloud version?

492
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:05,260
Yeah.

493
00:24:05,260 --> 00:24:07,660
I think that's anything that's a service is 365.

494
00:24:07,660 --> 00:24:09,780
I'm not using Windows on Christmas.

495
00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:11,460
I'm not using Office on Christmas.

496
00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:15,300
So they can take at least Christmas and Easter off.

497
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:20,300
Would you use GNOME?

498
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:21,300
Okay.

499
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:22,720
All right.

500
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:24,940
So it starts off reasonable.

501
00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:25,940
Okay.

502
00:24:25,940 --> 00:24:27,700
This has really gone around like a wildfire.

503
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:30,700
I shouldn't say that, but it really has.

504
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:36,240
A GNOME developer has been doing a four part series about GNOME.

505
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:40,600
His name is Tobias Bernard and he's done part one, two and three and they didn't get a lot

506
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:41,600
of attention.

507
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:47,900
But then he did part four where he talks about GNOME's values and its principles.

508
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:50,320
I'm going to preface this.

509
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:51,320
This is one developer.

510
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:57,300
This doesn't necessarily represent the entire perspective of everyone involved in GNOME.

511
00:24:57,300 --> 00:25:02,860
However, it probably represents at least some of the widely held feelings and beliefs in

512
00:25:02,860 --> 00:25:03,860
the GNOME team.

513
00:25:03,860 --> 00:25:10,460
And I'll tell you, I read this and I just really had a bad feeling.

514
00:25:10,460 --> 00:25:13,440
So a couple of the points that, and I'll link to the full article, but a couple of the points

515
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:21,440
that Tobias makes is he explains that GNOME's view is they must avoid user preferences and

516
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:28,140
settings as much as possible because every preference has a cost in development time.

517
00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:29,140
I agree with that.

518
00:25:29,140 --> 00:25:30,140
That is true.

519
00:25:30,140 --> 00:25:32,180
Every preference adds complication.

520
00:25:32,180 --> 00:25:34,880
It adds another thing you have to test.

521
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:35,920
I agree.

522
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:41,660
And I think it's a reasonable design philosophy to try to reduce the amount of user preferences

523
00:25:41,660 --> 00:25:42,700
that have to be set.

524
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:48,500
And he says they prefer to instead tackle the underlying problems that cause excessive

525
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:50,660
options.

526
00:25:50,660 --> 00:25:53,980
The only thing is with the GNOME project, it seems like this is taken to an extreme

527
00:25:53,980 --> 00:25:56,620
where it means there can be no user configuration options.

528
00:25:56,620 --> 00:26:01,480
Then he goes on to say, and this one I kind of strongly disagree with, the traditional

529
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:02,980
desktop is dead.

530
00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:04,720
Yeah, I'm not sure I buy that at all.

531
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:09,140
And I don't really agree with that because I think Apple and Windows are still selling

532
00:26:09,140 --> 00:26:10,140
quite well.

533
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:13,580
Especially with what we just saw with COVID too, work from home laptop sales spiked, right?

534
00:26:13,580 --> 00:26:15,620
I mean, I don't think it's dead.

535
00:26:15,620 --> 00:26:21,220
And it concerns me that a desktop maker thinks that, but anyways, he goes on to say system

536
00:26:21,220 --> 00:26:24,820
wide theming is a broken idea.

537
00:26:24,820 --> 00:26:30,140
He suggests those who don't like the way an app looks on their desktop should stop theming

538
00:26:30,140 --> 00:26:33,260
and instead contribute to the app directly upstream.

539
00:26:33,260 --> 00:26:34,900
It's still always viable.

540
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:39,540
And then that's, see that, that's the one that kind of irks me because most users can't

541
00:26:39,540 --> 00:26:44,100
like write Vala code or C sharp code or whatever, you know, language to this particular applications

542
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:45,100
written in.

543
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:46,100
Yeah.

544
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:51,060
And in particular, again, like I find it a reasonable argument that theming adds variability.

545
00:26:51,060 --> 00:26:54,620
It makes it hard for the developers to exactly expect and test what their apps going to look

546
00:26:54,620 --> 00:26:55,860
like on every system.

547
00:26:55,860 --> 00:26:56,940
I get that.

548
00:26:56,940 --> 00:26:59,500
It's a hard problem to solve.

549
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:05,260
That being said, when you look at the commercial platforms, windows, Mac, Android, iOS, Chrome

550
00:27:05,260 --> 00:27:11,100
OS, there is such a, a flip on the spectrum.

551
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:16,380
Back when I first got into Linux in the late nineties, you could get resource fork editors

552
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:22,240
for Mac OS and you could get theme packs for Mac OS and windows had a plus pack that included

553
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:24,900
new themes in a way to tweak the UI.

554
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:29,540
And there were companies like Stardock that would make cool tools to modify the way your

555
00:27:29,540 --> 00:27:31,260
PC looked.

556
00:27:31,260 --> 00:27:35,920
And then when this first smartphones came out, the ones that ran windows CE and Palm,

557
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:38,540
you could customize the crap out of those.

558
00:27:38,540 --> 00:27:42,060
You could customize the crap out of those UIs and put little widgets everywhere and

559
00:27:42,060 --> 00:27:44,740
up in the little toolbars and do all kinds of stuff.

560
00:27:44,740 --> 00:27:49,200
And now in 2021, we have swung so far the other direction.

561
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:55,340
User customizability and user control is essentially gone instead replaced by standardization,

562
00:27:55,340 --> 00:28:00,300
standard controls, standard way of doing things, reduction of settings is always a goal now.

563
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:03,220
And there is a place in the market for that.

564
00:28:03,220 --> 00:28:04,220
That's fine.

565
00:28:04,220 --> 00:28:08,580
But I also feel like more than ever now, more than when I even started using Linux originally,

566
00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:13,000
there's also a place in the market for a desktop environment that does let you have some power

567
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,300
and control and does let you customize it.

568
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:21,220
And I would go on to argue that giving the user the ability to customize their theme

569
00:28:21,220 --> 00:28:26,760
and tweak their desktop as silly as that sounds and as much of a headache as it is for developers

570
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:31,500
inspires people to tinker and become curious with their computers.

571
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:36,220
And it's what creates the next generation of people who are building systems and tweaking

572
00:28:36,220 --> 00:28:41,460
systems because they can investigate, because they can explore their curiosity.

573
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:45,620
They can open up the hood and they can play around with the engine.

574
00:28:45,620 --> 00:28:50,460
And I think that's probably more important today than it's ever been because it doesn't

575
00:28:50,460 --> 00:28:53,900
exist at all in the general market.

576
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:57,820
And so for GNOME to come along and say, well, what we're going to do is we're going to lock

577
00:28:57,820 --> 00:29:02,340
everything down and we're going to make it just as bland and generic as all of the commercial

578
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:03,340
platforms.

579
00:29:03,340 --> 00:29:05,320
Well, then what's the differentiator here?

580
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:07,140
Because the market's already spoken.

581
00:29:07,140 --> 00:29:12,380
GNOME OS came out after GNOME Shell and has destroyed them in market share for other market

582
00:29:12,380 --> 00:29:13,380
reasons.

583
00:29:13,380 --> 00:29:14,380
But let's just be honest here.

584
00:29:14,380 --> 00:29:15,380
Like, who's your market?

585
00:29:15,380 --> 00:29:16,380
Who are you going for?

586
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:21,400
And then the last one, Mike, the one that truly gets me angry, legitimately made me

587
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:24,780
decide I am no longer ever using GNOME Shell.

588
00:29:24,780 --> 00:29:29,720
And it's such a damn disappointment, especially after the project specifically made outreach

589
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:33,860
to extension developers to improve the extension experience, which we've talked about on this

590
00:29:33,860 --> 00:29:40,180
show, Tobias says, Shell extensions will always be a niche thing.

591
00:29:40,180 --> 00:29:43,460
Yeah, that one hit below the belt.

592
00:29:43,460 --> 00:29:48,140
Rather than building GNOME extensions, Tobias thinks developers should instead make apps

593
00:29:48,140 --> 00:29:53,100
or perhaps contribute directly upstream to GNOME Shell, again with the contribute upstream.

594
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:56,900
Then you don't need the extension, as if the GNOME project would even accept your patch

595
00:29:56,900 --> 00:30:02,020
because they're notorious for rejecting things that don't match their ideology.

596
00:30:02,020 --> 00:30:07,860
And the bombastic statement of ridiculousness that GNOME Shell extensions are niche is the

597
00:30:07,860 --> 00:30:11,300
opposite, the opposite of reality.

598
00:30:11,300 --> 00:30:18,180
GNOME Shell with extensions is the vast majority of GNOME deployments, considering that Ubuntu,

599
00:30:18,180 --> 00:30:23,100
just the more recent versions of Ubuntu, have a two fold install base over every other GNOME

600
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:29,260
desktop and it ships with a boatload of extensions by default, makes that statement ludicrous.

601
00:30:29,260 --> 00:30:30,740
Pop OS as well is in there.

602
00:30:30,740 --> 00:30:35,620
Pop OS, even Fedora dude, even Fedora ships with an extension that puts their logo on

603
00:30:35,620 --> 00:30:37,780
the background in GNOME Shell.

604
00:30:37,780 --> 00:30:44,860
Literally every major implementation on every distribution that ships GNOME Shell has extensions

605
00:30:44,860 --> 00:30:46,060
turned on by default.

606
00:30:46,060 --> 00:30:49,460
And the developer says, oh, they're a niche thing, they're going to go away.

607
00:30:49,460 --> 00:30:53,780
If you want that functionality, if you want the Bitcoin price up in your toolbar, if you

608
00:30:53,780 --> 00:30:58,140
want your ping milliseconds up in the toolbar, submit that code upstream to GNOME Shell so

609
00:30:58,140 --> 00:30:59,940
that way we can reject it.

610
00:30:59,940 --> 00:31:03,860
Yeah, I think it's crazy that the solution to that would be submitting upstream.

611
00:31:03,860 --> 00:31:11,820
But again, it's entitled to his opinion and obviously, you know, I don't know.

612
00:31:11,820 --> 00:31:14,980
The dream of GNOME extensions was a great dream.

613
00:31:14,980 --> 00:31:19,500
I do, I mean, it's well documented that I have some reservations about it, but I don't

614
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:23,620
think the answer is everybody has to like fork GNOME and write in their own features.

615
00:31:23,620 --> 00:31:26,060
That's for damn sure, right?

616
00:31:26,060 --> 00:31:27,580
So it's interesting.

617
00:31:27,580 --> 00:31:29,040
It's sad.

618
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:34,180
I take it with a bit of salt because this is just one per one individual's opinion.

619
00:31:34,180 --> 00:31:40,780
But yeah, it's I think the problem is like he starts from the premise that the traditional

620
00:31:40,780 --> 00:31:43,020
desktop is dead.

621
00:31:43,020 --> 00:31:47,500
And so it gets really easy to make grand statements that are like just not true.

622
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:48,500
Yeah.

623
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:52,260
Because people do like spend their day working on their desktop.

624
00:31:52,260 --> 00:31:58,420
And I know for myself, at least, whether I'm a Mac or Linux or what, I know how each OS

625
00:31:58,420 --> 00:32:00,860
works and that works the way I want it.

626
00:32:00,860 --> 00:32:03,980
And I hate it when like, you know, quote, unquote, the vendor moves my cheese, right?

627
00:32:03,980 --> 00:32:08,700
Like something changes or they tell me I can't do something in particular on Mac as they've

628
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:12,260
been removing features, right?

629
00:32:12,260 --> 00:32:14,300
Particularly in the area of customization.

630
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:15,740
I don't know.

631
00:32:15,740 --> 00:32:18,920
This has been a recurring theme, the GNOME extensions.

632
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:21,940
I just, I don't know.

633
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:23,220
I like system wide theming.

634
00:32:23,220 --> 00:32:26,820
I like extensions and I don't think the traditional desktop is dead.

635
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:29,500
Not to like go through and cut them down point by point, but.

636
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:30,500
I agree completely.

637
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:36,460
I'll tell you the shift, the shift I had after reading this was I had the sad realization

638
00:32:36,460 --> 00:32:43,220
that the GNOME project probably through, you know, just a culture of a project and a group

639
00:32:43,220 --> 00:32:47,100
of people who share a common set of beliefs that, you know, they kind of they can create

640
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:49,340
an echo chamber.

641
00:32:49,340 --> 00:32:56,060
And I truly to my core believe they're making a desktop for a user that does not exist.

642
00:32:56,060 --> 00:33:01,500
They're making a desktop for this theoretical, idealized new user who's going to come to

643
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:07,520
Linux and wants this super simple, clean, get out of your way, just barely, but works

644
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:13,060
kind of environment that is minimal and very new user friendly.

645
00:33:13,060 --> 00:33:18,420
And it's, it seems like an obvious approach on the surface because if you look at the

646
00:33:18,420 --> 00:33:25,060
computer market and the people who use desktops, well, the vast, vast, vast majority of computer

647
00:33:25,060 --> 00:33:26,900
users are that type of user.

648
00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:31,300
The vast, vast majority of users that will ever use a computer are the type of user that

649
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:34,980
GNOME is building their perfect desktop for.

650
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:40,940
But the reality is that's always been the case for Linux and the commercial platforms

651
00:33:40,940 --> 00:33:45,160
are already providing the solution to all of those users.

652
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:48,940
And because of the market dynamics and work that have sold Chromebooks and continue to

653
00:33:48,940 --> 00:33:53,860
sell Mac books and sell Dells and those are all going to continue to ship those platforms

654
00:33:53,860 --> 00:33:55,540
for a very, very long time.

655
00:33:55,540 --> 00:33:59,180
And those users will buy Chromebooks and Macs.

656
00:33:59,180 --> 00:34:00,540
That's the reality of it.

657
00:34:00,540 --> 00:34:04,980
The people who choose to use Linux are going to be more of engineer types.

658
00:34:04,980 --> 00:34:09,500
They're going to be people who want that flexibility and control over their workstation.

659
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:13,840
They're going to be people who are intellectually curious about how the computer works.

660
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:18,860
That's always going to be the user base for desktop Linux, engineers and admins.

661
00:34:18,860 --> 00:34:19,980
It's obvious on its face.

662
00:34:19,980 --> 00:34:24,120
You're going to, of course, have new users out there that are given a Linux box that's

663
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:27,380
been preset up by an admin or a friend or a family member.

664
00:34:27,380 --> 00:34:29,500
That's always going to be a user out there.

665
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:34,380
But these are not the people actively seeking out the Linux desktop and choosing and evaluating

666
00:34:34,380 --> 00:34:36,100
desktop environments.

667
00:34:36,100 --> 00:34:38,980
Those are more technical people and they always will be.

668
00:34:38,980 --> 00:34:41,740
This is an engineer's operating system.

669
00:34:41,740 --> 00:34:42,740
Just what it is.

670
00:34:42,740 --> 00:34:45,940
You're either deploying it on a server to solve a problem, you're building a device

671
00:34:45,940 --> 00:34:50,220
or if you're using it on the desktop, you know what the hell you're doing.

672
00:34:50,220 --> 00:34:54,740
This idea that they're targeting this desktop environment at this user who's never going

673
00:34:54,740 --> 00:35:02,300
to choose their product and we have over 20 years of data to show us this.

674
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:06,420
We are never going to catch up to where some of these commercial desktops are at when it

675
00:35:06,420 --> 00:35:10,940
comes to ecosystem integration because these users also have bones that tie into greater

676
00:35:10,940 --> 00:35:16,380
ecosystems and GNOME Shell is just simply not in a position to offer any kind of competition

677
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:17,380
to that.

678
00:35:17,380 --> 00:35:20,980
And again, so they're going to have to focus on a user who can live without that kind of

679
00:35:20,980 --> 00:35:21,980
stuff.

680
00:35:21,980 --> 00:35:26,140
This all just sounds obvious when it comes out of my mouth and yet the GNOME project

681
00:35:26,140 --> 00:35:27,980
seems completely blinded by it.

682
00:35:27,980 --> 00:35:34,260
Instead, they're on this quest to actually alienate the existing user base they have

683
00:35:34,260 --> 00:35:41,080
today and shoot for a user that simply does not exist.

684
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:47,300
It's madness and it simply invalidates the GNOME desktop for me as a possible desktop

685
00:35:47,300 --> 00:35:51,260
of the future because I'm clearly not their target demographic.

686
00:35:51,260 --> 00:35:55,940
They don't think any of us, anyone listening to this show is their target demographic.

687
00:35:55,940 --> 00:35:59,220
They think this person that doesn't exist that they've made up in their minds is the

688
00:35:59,220 --> 00:36:00,740
target demographic.

689
00:36:00,740 --> 00:36:05,740
And so it's with that that I just simply cannot use GNOME Shell, I cannot recommend GNOME

690
00:36:05,740 --> 00:36:06,740
Shell.

691
00:36:06,740 --> 00:36:11,740
And for you, I've got to now start a campaign to convince you to try Plasma because it is

692
00:36:11,740 --> 00:36:15,360
a better experience, but how do I even get somebody to try it because all of the major

693
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:19,820
distributions are using GNOME Shell and it's pathetic.

694
00:36:19,820 --> 00:36:23,060
You know how you get someone like me to try it?

695
00:36:23,060 --> 00:36:26,940
So my love of Papa West is pretty well documented, right?

696
00:36:26,940 --> 00:36:34,180
But there's a pitch me some other distro other than Ubuntu or Pop that by default comes with

697
00:36:34,180 --> 00:36:38,180
Plasma and is somehow tailored for what I do.

698
00:36:38,180 --> 00:36:42,780
I know I've said it before, there's two things that have happened in recent history, Canonical

699
00:36:42,780 --> 00:36:47,620
could have chosen to go with Plasma and System76 could have chosen to go with Plasma when they

700
00:36:47,620 --> 00:36:48,860
created Pop.

701
00:36:48,860 --> 00:36:53,420
And in both cases, it just came down to GTK is what we've been using, GNOME Shell is what

702
00:36:53,420 --> 00:36:56,500
we've been using, it's what we know, we'll just keep doing it.

703
00:36:56,500 --> 00:37:00,980
When you look at who contributes to GNOME Shell, it's 80% somewhere in that neighborhood,

704
00:37:00,980 --> 00:37:03,980
almost 90% Red Hat staff.

705
00:37:03,980 --> 00:37:10,580
It's so clearly a Red Hat project that we all pretend like isn't a Red Hat project.

706
00:37:10,580 --> 00:37:13,420
And it's Red Hat that's driving this.

707
00:37:13,420 --> 00:37:16,420
And I have a lot of respect for what they do, I think the team has done a lot of hard

708
00:37:16,420 --> 00:37:20,620
work, a lot of good development has come out of there, but it's just no longer for me.

709
00:37:20,620 --> 00:37:22,660
And I'm still going through the morning process.

710
00:37:22,660 --> 00:37:23,660
I've lost a friend.

711
00:37:23,660 --> 00:37:27,140
I just want to say, as we've been on the air, my work Slack is blowing up because we're

712
00:37:27,140 --> 00:37:28,740
recording during the day.

713
00:37:28,740 --> 00:37:31,980
And they're debugging some problem, it doesn't really matter.

714
00:37:31,980 --> 00:37:37,300
But people are all talking about how they've now customized their GNOME terminals.

715
00:37:37,300 --> 00:37:40,900
And the couple people on Mac are like, well, how come we can't do transparencies and background

716
00:37:40,900 --> 00:37:41,900
images in our terminal?

717
00:37:41,900 --> 00:37:42,900
They got to get iTerm, that's why.

718
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:47,780
That's why, you got to get iTerm basically, because Apple decided that you can't have

719
00:37:47,780 --> 00:37:48,780
that.

720
00:37:48,780 --> 00:37:49,780
Didn't they used to?

721
00:37:49,780 --> 00:37:50,780
I could have sworn it used to.

722
00:37:50,780 --> 00:37:51,780
They used to.

723
00:37:51,780 --> 00:37:52,780
They actually took it out.

724
00:37:52,780 --> 00:37:56,060
They said, OK, just like a small digression here.

725
00:37:56,060 --> 00:38:00,740
I was working on Windows the other day, a VM, because I destroyed my Windows machine.

726
00:38:00,740 --> 00:38:07,220
And the Windows terminal is just, it's a joy.

727
00:38:07,220 --> 00:38:12,260
As a terminal emulator, it's awesome.

728
00:38:12,260 --> 00:38:14,660
I don't understand why I can't have that on Mac.

729
00:38:14,660 --> 00:38:18,820
Well, I mean, I know you're such an iTerm hater, but I tell you, I think Windows terminal

730
00:38:18,820 --> 00:38:20,300
was heavily inspired by iTerm.

731
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:22,860
Isn't iTerm not being updated anymore?

732
00:38:22,860 --> 00:38:23,860
No, it's updated.

733
00:38:23,860 --> 00:38:24,860
Oh, yeah.

734
00:38:24,860 --> 00:38:25,860
Mm.

735
00:38:25,860 --> 00:38:26,860
I know.

736
00:38:26,860 --> 00:38:27,860
I know.

737
00:38:27,860 --> 00:38:28,860
Yeah.

738
00:38:28,860 --> 00:38:32,900
What I would do if I were you is I'd have one terminal that's the Mac terminal.

739
00:38:32,900 --> 00:38:33,900
That would be my x86 terminal.

740
00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:39,180
And then I'd have one terminal that's my M1-compatible terminal or something, because you know.

741
00:38:39,180 --> 00:38:41,140
I never, ever run the M1 terminal.

742
00:38:41,140 --> 00:38:42,140
Oh, really?

743
00:38:42,140 --> 00:38:43,140
It's all x86?

744
00:38:43,140 --> 00:38:46,180
It's still that bad, huh?

745
00:38:46,180 --> 00:38:47,180
It's still a hot mess?

746
00:38:47,180 --> 00:38:52,300
Well, it's, I mean, I'm doing a lot of Python-y stuff, and it's just, yeah, you got to compile

747
00:38:52,300 --> 00:38:53,300
like this.

748
00:38:53,300 --> 00:38:54,300
That's got a long tail.

749
00:38:54,300 --> 00:38:55,300
Mm.

750
00:38:55,300 --> 00:39:00,380
I actually renamed terminal to terminal M1, and I have another terminal that's just like

751
00:39:00,380 --> 00:39:03,540
a copy of it, but set to launch in Rosetta mode.

752
00:39:03,540 --> 00:39:06,540
That's terminal.

753
00:39:06,540 --> 00:39:08,540
That's Rosetta terminal, rather.

754
00:39:08,540 --> 00:39:11,780
Yeah, I'm just, I don't know, man.

755
00:39:11,780 --> 00:39:14,500
After I read this, I had to sit with this GNOME stuff.

756
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:15,500
Made me sad.

757
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:16,500
Yeah.

758
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:17,500
This thing is forever, right?

759
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:23,900
I just, I don't know, I mean, we're all rocking iPads, and my long guy just loves it when

760
00:39:23,900 --> 00:39:24,900
we record.

761
00:39:24,900 --> 00:39:26,220
Yeah, especially during the day.

762
00:39:26,220 --> 00:39:32,700
Yeah, I think because I'm really struggling to stay on the Linux desktop these days, Plasma

763
00:39:32,700 --> 00:39:36,740
makes me happy, but it's not perfect, especially when I start getting to Wayland and multiple

764
00:39:36,740 --> 00:39:41,660
monitor setups with multiple refresh rates, and one that's high DPI and one that's not,

765
00:39:41,660 --> 00:39:43,100
one that has HDR and one that doesn't.

766
00:39:43,100 --> 00:39:45,980
It's a real hodgepodge monitor setup I have right now, but I just simply can't afford to

767
00:39:45,980 --> 00:39:46,980
replace all of them.

768
00:39:46,980 --> 00:39:48,260
So it is what it is.

769
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:52,540
And it's really a struggle bus these days to just use desktop Linux, especially when

770
00:39:52,540 --> 00:39:56,460
you have things like the M1 coming out and the M1X pending.

771
00:39:56,460 --> 00:40:00,260
You have Windows that seems to be getting better and better.

772
00:40:00,260 --> 00:40:05,180
I'm never going to switch to it, but like the pressures really seem to be mounting against

773
00:40:05,180 --> 00:40:07,260
desktop Linux.

774
00:40:07,260 --> 00:40:13,420
And at the same time, you have the lead desktop project and one of their lead developers going

775
00:40:13,420 --> 00:40:16,700
on about how the desktop's dead and about how extensions are niche.

776
00:40:16,700 --> 00:40:19,300
And it's like, wow, could you be any more detached from reality?

777
00:40:19,300 --> 00:40:25,740
Like the people that have the future of desktop Linux in their very hands seem delusional.

778
00:40:25,740 --> 00:40:26,740
Delusional.

779
00:40:26,740 --> 00:40:27,740
I like it.

780
00:40:27,740 --> 00:40:28,740
Seriously.

781
00:40:28,740 --> 00:40:32,220
They think that they think the traditional desktop is dead and they think extensions

782
00:40:32,220 --> 00:40:34,780
are niche, or at least Tobias does.

783
00:40:34,780 --> 00:40:36,140
In my opinion, that sounds delusional.

784
00:40:36,140 --> 00:40:38,540
Yeah, but again, it's just one dude.

785
00:40:38,540 --> 00:40:43,340
And I just don't see how anybody with a straight face could say traditional desktops are dead.

786
00:40:43,340 --> 00:40:44,340
They're not dead.

787
00:40:44,340 --> 00:40:49,660
People work with them every day, especially Linux people who are, you know, overwhelmingly

788
00:40:49,660 --> 00:40:55,620
IT pros of some kind, whether they're developers or sys admins or DBAs or whatever.

789
00:40:55,620 --> 00:40:57,100
I hope you're right.

790
00:40:57,100 --> 00:41:01,060
Audience let me know what you think, coder.show slash contact, or you can weigh in on anything

791
00:41:01,060 --> 00:41:03,080
we've mentioned here or anything else you'd like.

792
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:08,420
If you haven't joined our Coder QA team yet, coderqa.co, we have a new Coderly that's getting

793
00:41:08,420 --> 00:41:10,580
recorded soon and released very soon.

794
00:41:10,580 --> 00:41:12,460
You get that and access to all the previous ones.

795
00:41:12,460 --> 00:41:17,800
You support the show, you get a limited ad feed and that special bonus Coderly report.

796
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:19,740
And that is all at coderqa.co.

797
00:41:19,740 --> 00:41:21,820
Thanks to everybody who does support us.

798
00:41:21,820 --> 00:41:22,820
It means a lot.

799
00:41:22,820 --> 00:41:26,540
Mr. Dominic, is there anyone you want to send people anywhere you want to send people, maybe

800
00:41:26,540 --> 00:41:27,540
to your long guy?

801
00:41:27,540 --> 00:41:28,540
Maybe?

802
00:41:28,540 --> 00:41:29,540
I don't know.

803
00:41:29,540 --> 00:41:30,540
Yeah.

804
00:41:30,540 --> 00:41:31,540
No, you know what?

805
00:41:31,540 --> 00:41:34,460
I've been a little inactive on the socials, but follow me at Twitter, add to Manuka, I'll

806
00:41:34,460 --> 00:41:36,020
probably pick back up in a week or two.

807
00:41:36,020 --> 00:41:39,000
Yeah, once, you know, you can always send us some moving pictures.

808
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,000
People love that.

809
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,000
Yeah.

810
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,000
Oh, yeah.

811
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,000
I'm at Chris Elias.

812
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:46,380
The network is at Jupiter Signal and the show at Coder Radio Show.

813
00:41:46,380 --> 00:41:50,340
Links to what we talked about today, well, that's over at coder.show slash four, two,

814
00:41:50,340 --> 00:41:51,340
three.

815
00:41:51,340 --> 00:41:55,740
You'll also find that contact form I mentioned, as well as our RSS feed and links to our back

816
00:41:55,740 --> 00:41:58,020
catalog and all of that.

817
00:41:58,020 --> 00:42:02,700
And head over to Jupiterbroadcasting.com slash calendar to get our live time so you can join

818

819
00:42:05,340 --> 00:42:07,820
Thanks so much for joining us on this week's episode of Coder Radio.

820
00:42:07,820 --> 00:42:17,580
See you right back here next week.
