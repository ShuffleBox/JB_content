00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,040
This is KOTORadio, episode 412 for May 3rd, 2021.

2
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:19,940
Hello friend and welcome into Jupiter Broadcasting's weekly talk show, taking a pragmatic look

3
00:00:19,940 --> 00:00:24,720
at the art and business of software development, and the whole world of technology around it.

4
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:26,840
This episode is brought to you by a Cloud Guru.

5
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:32,320
A Cloud Guru now includes Cloud Playground, Azure, AWS, or Google Cloud Sandboxes on

6
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:34,040
ACG's credit card.

7
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:35,040
Not yours.

8
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:39,720
Get certified, get hired, get learning at acloudguru.com.

9
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:44,240
My name is Chris and this special edition of the KOTORadio program finds me all by myself

10
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:47,080
because Mike is out on assignment, but fear not.

11
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:48,960
I have a special, special episode for you.

12
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:54,920
I have the privilege of sharing a wonderful chat between our very own Wes Payne and Brunch

13
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:56,680
Master Brent.

14
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:59,400
It is definitely a wide ranging conversation.

15
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:06,400
It's a deep dive into a swath of life, including Wes's approach to learning new things and

16
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:10,560
his definition of his kind of work, which I think is unique and different, as well as

17
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:15,760
thoughts on meditation and improving productivity and the importance of context and comprehension

18
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:19,760
to just entropy and the evolutions of routines and creativity.

19
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:20,920
I'm not kidding you.

20
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:25,780
It is a wide ranging conversation and it's a perfect one for our audience who has to

21
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:28,600
think about work in multiple different ways.

22
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:33,320
So before we go back in time to that conversation, I want to thank our sponsor, Linode.

23
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:34,680
Linode.com slash KOTOR.

24
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:38,080
Go there to receive a $100 60 day credit towards your new account.

25
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:40,680
And of course you support the KOTORadio program.

26
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:43,360
Simplify your cloud infrastructure with Linode.

27
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:45,120
That's how we host everything now.

28
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:49,800
They are our go to hosting provider and they give us the tools to develop, deploy and maintain

29
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:54,080
all of the functions we need to operate at the scale we do with the size of the team

30
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:55,080
that we have.

31
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:57,240
And I cannot emphasize that point enough.

32
00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:01,240
Linode makes it possible for us to do things way beyond what a small team could normally

33
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:02,240
grasp.

34
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:07,320
That's what's great because their prices are 35 to 50% less than shops like AWS, like big

35
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:09,580
cloud over there at AWS.

36
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:11,640
And Linode's been around since 2003.

37
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:16,080
They were the first in this game and they have focused on getting this right since then.

38
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:19,160
And with 11 data centers worldwide, you're going to find just the right spot to deploy

39
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:20,160
for you.

40
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:23,400
And you're going to rest easily knowing that Linode's built in monitoring tools have you

41
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:24,560
covered.

42
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:28,980
Just simple things like that, like I get emails when a system reaches a certain threshold

43
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:34,080
on memory usage or network usage, man, just watching that stuff is a fantastic indicator

44
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:36,140
about what's going on with your system.

45
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:42,360
But maybe you want something even simpler, like just beautiful, accessible S3 compatible

46
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,960
object storage in the cloud.

47
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:47,900
I love Linode's S3 compatible object storage.

48
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:48,900
What is it?

49
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:52,280
Well, if you don't know, object storage is an easy way for you to store and access data

50
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:56,400
without the need of running an entire server, you know, with its whole OS and everything

51
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,060
in front of that.

52
00:02:58,060 --> 00:03:02,160
You can get just URL accessible storage either for yourself or you can flip it public.

53
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:05,120
It's a great way to run a static website or host some files.

54
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:12,000
We use it internally as a dynamic way to automatically add storage for our PeerTube instance and

55
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,400
for our next cloud instance.

56
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:17,880
So we're not constantly battling with storage limitations and accidentally using too much

57
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:21,000
for a project that we're going to have around for three months that throws everything into

58
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
whack.

59
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,920
And this actually solves problems that have literally broken a next cloud deployment before

60
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:29,160
when I just totally ran out of storage.

61
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:32,360
It's embarrassing, but I just don't have the time to manage this stuff.

62
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:36,400
And so using Linode's tools to monitor and manage this and take care of some of these

63
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:39,080
things, it is such a time saver.

64
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:42,260
At the price point that Linode is offering, it's just a no brainer.

65
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:45,000
They're dedicated to offering the best virtualized cloud computing.

66
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,640
If it runs on Linux, it runs on Linode.

67
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:53,800
To go to linode.com slash coder, receive that $100 60 day credit and support the show.

68
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:58,040
And of course, of course, try out all the features I've been talking about forever.

69
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:00,000
It's linode.com slash coder.

70
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,840
All right, like I said, it really is a special privilege to introduce this conversation to

71
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:05,840
you.

72
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:08,720
I take you back in time to Brunch with Wes Payne.

73
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:09,720
Hi, Wes.

74
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:10,720
Hello, Brent.

75
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:11,720
How are you today?

76
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:12,720
I'm doing wonderful.

77
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:13,720
I see your smiling face.

78
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:14,720
Oh, well, come on.

79
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:15,720
That's just because you're so nice.

80
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:19,200
And it's not always smiling.

81
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:20,680
That's why I appreciate it.

82
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:23,240
I think I try to smile in the appropriate contexts.

83
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:24,800
I hope I accomplish such things.

84
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:27,320
You don't want a false smile.

85
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:31,480
So we're doing brunch here and you actually did participate in some brunch.

86
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:32,480
How was that?

87
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,480
That was lovely.

88
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:37,560
You made me an excellent, excellent frittata.

89
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:38,600
I did.

90
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:41,760
And Chris got a little bit of that down his gullet as well.

91
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:42,760
It was it was good.

92
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:46,480
I was a little picky about my eggs from time to time.

93
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:47,480
But it was excellent.

94
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:48,540
All right.

95
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:52,280
Just to warm you up for our session here.

96
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:53,800
This is kind of neat for me, Wes.

97
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:57,480
I'm sitting in the hot seat here, which is Chris's seat.

98
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:58,480
Yeah.

99
00:04:58,480 --> 00:04:59,480
You're sitting in your usual seat.

100
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:01,480
So this is totally normal for you, right?

101
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:02,880
But it's cool.

102
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:06,720
We've had the opportunity this week to hang out with the crew.

103
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:09,200
Oh, yeah, so much hanging out.

104
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:13,800
And we had well, tell me, what were the things that kind of stood out for you?

105
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:16,320
Some food, some some conversations and stuff?

106
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:21,160
I really enjoyed the ad hoc collaboration and just sort of people mixing and mashing

107
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:25,760
ideas and all being nerdy about like a ton of different topics, some of them show related,

108
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:27,760
some of them just like life things.

109
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:31,080
Lots of music being bounced around as well, I noticed.

110
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:35,280
And Chris, I think did a good job of trying to show everyone the virtues of living in

111
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:36,280
the Pacific Northwest.

112
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:38,280
So well, I did not attend all of those.

113
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:42,320
I was very glad that other people got to see the beautiful landscapes around here.

114
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:43,320
Right.

115
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:44,320
I mean, you're, you're a local.

116
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:47,400
So you you've already been converted, right?

117
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:49,760
Or converted by default, shall we say?

118
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:50,760
Right.

119
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:52,840
Have you ever lived anywhere else?

120
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:56,720
Like you've you've been in Seattle, and I know you grew up a little bit further down.

121
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:59,400
Yeah, I grew up in Olympia, slightly south.

122
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:01,480
But have you lived in any other cities?

123
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:03,800
I lived in Bellingham for a while.

124
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:06,700
And I lived in Everett.

125
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:09,120
So all sort of in this little corridor here?

126
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,120
Yeah, the I-5 corridor.

127
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,120
Nice.

128
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,120
Yeah.

129
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:14,000
And so, totally your backyard?

130
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Very much so.

131
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
What I-

132
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,320
But there's still plenty to discover, let me tell you.

133
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:22,740
Yeah, I was just about to say what I really appreciate is when you can sort of become

134
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:24,280
a tourist in your own backyard.

135
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:25,280
Yes.

136
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:30,680
And so I know Chris, we ended up, well, he's never been to those ice caves.

137
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:31,840
And I don't know if you've ever been?

138
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:33,120
No, I have not.

139
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,120
Okay.

140
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:38,200
But that's always fun when you can, like, both be the tour guide and also the tourist

141
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:39,200
at the same time.

142
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,200
Yeah, right.

143
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,200
Let's go check out this fun thing together.

144
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,200
Well, maybe it's fun.

145
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:43,200
We'll find out.

146
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:44,200
Right.

147
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:50,440
I have to say for myself, moving to a different city is totally eye opening in the sense that

148
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:53,000
it breaks all your routines and you have to build them all back up.

149
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,040
You got to find all your new places in this new city.

150
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,040
Yeah.

151
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:58,560
Was that the same for you when you moved, let's say to Bellingham?

152
00:06:58,560 --> 00:06:59,560
Yes.

153
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:00,560
Yeah.

154
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,040
You know, I really do like that sort of.

155
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:07,320
You got to work out what new routines and there's whole different sections of the city.

156
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:12,200
And there's something, I mean, I think about it more on the trail maybe, but it definitely

157
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:17,360
applies in cities of that when you don't really know what's around the bend and all the like,

158
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,360
it might be terrible, right?

159
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:21,360
It might just be like a dump that's around the bend and you don't know until you walk

160
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,360
around it.

161
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:23,360
And that's a lot of the fun.

162
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:28,080
But you also get all the enjoyment of before you know, all the things you imagine might

163
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,840
be around the bend.

164
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:33,540
And that's just fun as you continue finding more bends and you know, whatever eventually

165
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:35,440
map out a new area.

166
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:39,580
What you're describing also makes me think that you could be describing sort of a learning

167
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:43,840
journey through, I don't know, some Linux or whatever, right?

168
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:50,840
Almost any learning journey is if you're excited about what's around the bend or excited enough,

169
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:54,780
it might take you around the bend and then you're onto a whole other adventure.

170
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:59,500
That's one thing I like about living in a slightly larger city, living in Seattle, it's

171
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:03,560
just that, I mean, I haven't been there that long, really.

172
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:06,720
But there's still tons of places, you know, I mean, neighborhoods, I think I've probably

173
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:10,720
been to all of them, at least in passing, but it doesn't mean I know anything about

174
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:11,720
them.

175
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:16,680
There's a gentleman I saw, it's actually a film that I watched on the way here.

176
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:25,220
So perfect setup is it was a film that I shared with cheese about a gentleman who decided

177
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:33,520
to walk every single street in New York, in every, I think he said the five boroughs.

178
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:35,800
Now, I don't quite know New York that well.

179
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:37,720
Right, some big subset.

180
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:38,720
That's it.

181
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:44,960
And so he decided to do this because he realized much like you that you can go to each neighborhood,

182
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:48,880
but you kind of have these loop patterns that you follow.

183
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:52,840
And you may live in a neighborhood, but only go down maybe, you know, 20% of those streets

184
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:56,760
in your daily routine, right, because of course, we all have routines and that kind of stuff.

185
00:08:56,760 --> 00:09:00,480
So it's the way that I walk, yeah, partly because it's Seattle, and that's the flat

186
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:05,740
white, but well, path of least resistance, right, right.

187
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:10,440
But what was fascinating to me about that is, is how there could be a street one street

188
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:16,160
over that, even though there's proximity, you just never spend any time on it.

189
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:17,600
Yes, right.

190
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:23,080
And so forcing yourself into adventure is, I think, a really good tool to open your eyes

191
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:25,840
to some new ideas, even.

192
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:28,560
It's funny, too, like you, you have to keep the mindset.

193
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:33,300
I mean, so like, even just during this, this sprint, I discovered a nice little New Mexican

194
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:37,200
joint right by the hotel where people were staying up, I've been to the grocery store

195
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:41,640
in that same region, but I never even considered, you know, it was always either to or from

196
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:46,120
the studio, I had a mission, I had a job to do, I never thought about just meandering

197
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:48,880
around looking for goodies.

198
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:49,920
And it pays off.

199
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:51,380
It does pay off.

200
00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:54,840
The Mexican was pretty great, you, you grabbed it, and it was great.

201
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:59,760
Tell me a little bit about how you do that adventuring journey through learning, because

202
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:06,200
I know you are huge fan of learning new things, and you're, you seem to be okay with deep

203
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:11,000
dives and just like, collecting knowledge, if you will.

204
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,360
That's an interesting question.

205
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:17,920
I mean, I probably should know more about how those processes work.

206
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:22,960
Just in the conversation earlier, we kind of hit on something, something you said, think

207
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:29,200
about thinking in systems that I think definitely applies to me.

208
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:32,720
It's sometimes frustrating when you're learning something new, and you know how much there

209
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:36,840
is to learn, and you know how much you don't know, but you don't know what the most efficient

210
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:38,480
routes are going to be, right?

211
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:42,560
And you don't, you don't yet have the systems, and I really struggle more than I think that

212
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:46,640
I should sometimes to be like, well, I know I could just like follow that tutorial, and

213
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:50,960
I could go like run the commands, but I'm going to be fighting myself the whole way

214
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:54,560
through because each step, I'm going to want to go dig and dive around that.

215
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:58,840
It won't get me near to the goal of what I'm trying to accomplish, but I really want to

216
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:03,600
know all the theory as or before I'm like trying to do the practice, and that does not

217
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:04,600
always work out well.

218
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:08,760
Well, it doesn't work out well in the sense that it's time consuming, and also you might

219
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:12,160
not have a good idea of where to head to get that knowledge.

220
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:13,160
Yes.

221
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:14,160
Right.

222
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:15,160
Yeah, you're right.

223
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:17,560
I mean, I would say generally the outcomes are good, it's just not always the most efficient

224
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:19,040
for the task at hand.

225
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:26,120
I do think the flip side of that is I'm going to put that much time into something, do generally

226
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:31,560
learn it very well because I do focus so much on the systems and theory side that, you know,

227
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:34,840
once you do have the practice, which you need, you can combine those very effectively.

228
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:45,320
Yeah, you build like these really robust models that if you dedicate to that particular sphere,

229
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:49,460
and it turns out to be a useful one for you long term, then you've got this amazing base

230
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:51,680
to work off of.

231
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:56,040
What I've sometimes run into is not catching myself soon enough, so I'll do these deep

232
00:11:56,040 --> 00:12:01,160
dives and build these really great systems for things I then decide are obsolete or not

233
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:03,160
actually solving the problems I'm trying to solve, right.

234
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:07,400
And it's hard to, you know, if you like what you're learning, if you're curious and you're

235
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:12,440
having fun playing with it, it is really, it takes a lot of willpower sometimes to be

236
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:17,080
like, no brain, this is not the track you need to be on right now, like go try this

237
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:18,960
other boring thing that will probably work.

238
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:24,840
A new rule I tried to implement for myself recently is to try to not learn something

239
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:32,200
I'm not going to use immediately, which is easy to state and harder to implement.

240
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:39,460
But for me, learning is such a driver for some of my sort of mental processes.

241
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:40,720
What do you mean?

242
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:46,120
In that if I get curious, then I'll want to dive in immediately.

243
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:51,000
And every new piece of information makes me even more curious.

244
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,240
So sort of compound.

245
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:56,840
Yeah, which is, which is great, because I think a lifelong learning journey is sort

246
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:59,160
of very useful.

247
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:04,360
However, learning itself can be a sort of procrastination.

248
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:05,360
Oh, yeah.

249
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:06,360
Right.

250
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:12,280
And so I can learn lots and be fascinated and very entertained by my learning.

251
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:14,600
But it may not necessarily be relevant.

252
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:21,240
You know so much about the Baroque period, I see that you've got it, you've got it.

253
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:27,360
So how about for you developing models about learning things that you aren't jazzed about?

254
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:32,920
Because sometimes we need to learn stuff that doesn't necessarily excite us to reach a goal

255
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:33,920
that does.

256
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:35,600
Yeah, that's true.

257
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:36,600
That is true.

258
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:39,240
You know, I could probably be better at that.

259
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:43,960
Oftentimes, I've ended up dealing with that either by making it so that I don't have,

260
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:48,840
you know, whatever my rule or the task at hand is changing so that I can get by with

261
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:54,060
learning it in a shallow way and not committing myself, or working with people who are better

262
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:56,720
at not over diving and having them do that part.

263
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:59,360
So I've had some of the best collaborators I've had have been kind of in like a little

264
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:00,360
more on the practical side.

265
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:04,120
I mean, like, okay, Wes, like, you can do a lot of the like, you know, ideating on thinking

266
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:08,840
and explore random paths and kind of find interesting things that we might want.

267
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:12,840
And then I'll handle some more of the like, well, I'll test each of these things or you

268
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:16,740
know, or like, just sort of the boring parts that make it all work, which I can certainly

269
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:17,740
do as well.

270
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:22,520
But I've encountered another class of individual who they don't care to this level, they just

271
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:24,840
don't obsess about it in the same way that we're talking about.

272
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:27,800
And I find that really nice to work with.

273
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:28,800
Because they're complimenting.

274
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:29,800
Right?

275
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:30,800
Yeah.

276
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:31,800
They can be like, well, yeah, whatever.

277
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:35,360
I just like, read the docs and found the little piece that I needed and left it at that.

278
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:36,360
And then left it.

279
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:37,360
Yeah.

280
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:38,360
And I'm like, okay, that's great.

281
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:39,360
How can you do that?

282
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:41,600
And then I stopped asking because I'm like, well, the whole point of this is I'm not going

283
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,440
to ask.

284
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:49,320
Could you then describe yourself as the really good support role in that sense?

285
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:53,460
That if you have someone driving sort of the direction, then you can do the deep dives

286
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:55,840
in the areas that are really obviously helpful?

287
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:56,840
Yeah, kind of.

288
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:59,640
It can be either side, I suppose.

289
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:05,320
And it depends on, I guess, how interested I am in the overall because I can write if

290
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:08,960
it's going to be something that I don't, if I don't have the vision for the overall whatever

291
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:12,880
task project, right, then I am totally happy to be like, well, whatever, I'll take the

292
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:18,080
corner that I'm interested in and learn that to the best of my ability.

293
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:21,380
If I care about it a lot, then I have a more difficult role.

294
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:25,760
If I really am interested in care, then I have a struggle to not be one, not necessarily

295
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:30,560
in charge, but at least, let's say, consulted about major decisions that affect that.

296
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:31,560
Yeah, fair enough.

297
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:34,280
So it's not, there's not a lot in the middle, I guess.

298
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:35,320
Interesting.

299
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:38,880
It's so good to know, though, how you function, right?

300
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:43,040
I think if, what a gift it would be if we all came with our own instruction manuals.

301
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:44,840
Oh, man, that would be nice.

302
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:51,120
It seems like most of our roles is simply to figure out how we function.

303
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:54,280
Maybe you have really good people around you who are able to give you some feedback, but

304
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:56,720
most of the time, that doesn't seem to be the case.

305
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:59,840
Yeah, that's the real gift in some mentors, right?

306
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:08,280
Some of the best mentors can see your best and your worst and use both of those as tools.

307
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:12,160
Were there any mentors that did that for you or helped you learn more about yourself?

308
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:13,640
Hmm, that's a good question.

309
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:16,560
I mean, surely, yes, there are.

310
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:17,800
I've stumped Wes.

311
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:18,800
You're hearing it for here first.

312
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:19,800
Yeah, you are.

313
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:22,080
I might have to think about that one a little bit.

314
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:23,080
Yeah, sure.

315
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:28,320
I'd like to give a meaningful answer and I would need more reflection, I think.

316
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:32,160
I was curious about something sort of related.

317
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:36,040
I'm wondering if you were also afflicted sometimes, you're talking about not learning stuff.

318
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:37,040
Trying.

319
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:38,800
Trying, yeah.

320
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:44,200
I sometimes find that difficult, too, where there's subjects that I am interested in and

321
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:48,120
would like to know more about, but either worry I would spend too much time doing or

322
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:54,520
just know what it would take to do it well and just doesn't seem, you know, it's like,

323
00:16:54,520 --> 00:17:00,240
so while I could probably dabble, I don't, and I'm wondering if that's maybe a net detriment

324
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:01,240
to me.

325
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:04,560
Like, there's probably areas that I could enjoy doing a little bit, but I don't let

326
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:07,000
myself do because I think I should do them more.

327
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,280
Is it linked to perfectionism in any way?

328
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:12,000
Yeah, maybe.

329
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
And do you find that to be a problem?

330
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
I do have a little streak of that from time to time.

331
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:22,960
Yeah, I would say actually that that has been both a real guide for me and a real detriment

332
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:30,060
to me in the sense that a lesson I've learned recently that's very helpful is the B plus

333
00:17:30,060 --> 00:17:38,040
is generally my B plus, my self evaluation of a B plus generally is really good for most

334
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:39,040
other people.

335
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:44,160
And I'm not trying to put myself on some kind of pedestal, but having this, like, deeply

336
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:51,400
set perfectionism can get me really caught up in trying to solve things that just don't

337
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:52,400
matter for anybody else.

338
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:53,400
Yeah, right.

339
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:56,360
And it's hard to replace that in whatever activity, right?

340
00:17:56,360 --> 00:18:00,360
Like, if you don't really care about it, that won't be as good or the flip side, like you're

341
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:03,920
saying that if you do really care about it, then you probably end up wasting some time

342
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:08,120
on details that don't matter, but you also catch a lot of details that other people might

343
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:09,120
miss.

344
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:10,120
Yeah.

345
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:12,840
For you, you describe not wanting to dabble in a specific project.

346
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:14,560
Is there something that comes to mind for that?

347
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:18,440
I've thought about doing more rock climbing, which is something I enjoy, but and have many

348
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:23,880
friends who enjoy, but I have not dove in to any serious degree.

349
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:26,720
That probably also applies to music.

350
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:27,720
Right because you...

351
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:32,840
I did music a lot in my youth, but I mean, I do a little music here and there now, but

352
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:34,120
not really anything.

353
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:37,720
Yeah, I know that you have a little bit of brass in you, right?

354
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:39,800
Yeah, I played French horn and trumpet for...

355
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:42,560
I was gonna say flugelhorn, but I knew that was wrong.

356
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:43,560
Right.

357
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:47,080
I did, in marching band, play the mellophone, which is...

358
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:48,480
I don't know what this is.

359
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:51,640
It's like a marching version of the French horn.

360
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:52,640
Okay.

361
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:53,640
Yeah.

362
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:58,520
It has a different sound, but it still has that interesting sort of, not quite muted,

363
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:03,560
but more mellow tone that you think of with the French horn.

364
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:07,840
But instead of having the rotary valves of a French horn, it had valves like a trumpet

365
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:08,840
does.

366
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:09,840
Interesting.

367
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:10,840
Yeah.

368
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:11,840
It was fun to play.

369
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:14,080
I'd never heard of it either, but it was a lot of fun, and it was kind of nice as like

370
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:19,400
a big trumpet, but with just like a giant bell on the end, but still about the same

371
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:22,840
holding size, and a lot of the fingerings were the same, so it was really easy to just

372
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:26,080
pick up and play, and you could make a whole bunch of noise, which is really the best part

373
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:27,680
about marching band.

374
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:30,520
You just go out there and just make a bunch of noise.

375
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:33,520
You're the loudest one, yeah, right.

376
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:37,640
And so how do you perceive the link between music and math?

377
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:41,080
Because I know you have a huge interest in math as well, and I've heard often that those

378
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:44,160
two kind of go together, even though they don't seem that they should.

379
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:54,000
Well, I mean, there's a lot of rhythms and periodicity in music, obviously, but in a

380
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:59,800
more fundamental level, sort of belaying all the surface level details, there do seem to

381
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:03,600
be some similar just sort of like ways about thinking, or maybe it's not even that they

382
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:11,320
have to be similar, but some of the patterns or styles of creativity needed for music can

383
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:15,840
apply well to math or tech-related things.

384
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:19,720
Because I think, you know, obviously people see music as creative, even when it, and it

385
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:26,340
is, but miss the side of being wrote and played back and recited, right?

386
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:33,760
And then see that side to math or computing or whatever, and miss the more creative side,

387
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:37,260
but often those are the more important role.

388
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:43,600
It's interesting that you brought in tech there because that's often an area that is

389
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:45,520
not necessarily seen as creative.

390
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:47,680
Yeah, yeah, that's absolutely true.

391
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:54,360
And yet with anyone who's doing some pretty deep problem solving in tech, it's a necessary,

392
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:55,360
right?

393
00:20:55,360 --> 00:21:00,320
Yeah, I mean, there is a lot of value in being a practitioner and being a good, reliable,

394
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:06,040
repeatable practitioner, but most of the things that end up, you know, at least at the upper

395
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:09,260
echelons or the more interesting work is you're kind of at the edge.

396
00:21:09,260 --> 00:21:10,960
No one's done that specific thing.

397
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:15,280
There's no pattern, or there might be some, you know, there are some patterns, but you're

398
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:19,200
making that specific bespoke thing.

399
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,200
It's a craft.

400
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:23,320
It's up to you to combine all of the toolboxes you've gathered.

401
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:28,560
And that's where like really caring about it matters, or I like to think so.

402
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:32,560
You can totally not, you can just, you know, you can cookie cutter, you can work on some

403
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:33,920
of the less interesting stuff.

404
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:37,420
You can just apply techniques that you've learned and move on and solve the problem.

405
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:41,280
And that's the right thing to do in many cases.

406
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:45,280
I just can't, I can't operate that way, you know, like, if I'm not gonna really care about

407
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:50,160
what it is that I'm doing, or like, at least be really interested in some aspects of it

408
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:53,500
and think about it a lot, wouldn't want to do it.

409
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:57,280
Since we're talking about mental models, I've built this model in my mind that there's a

410
00:21:57,280 --> 00:22:01,880
range between on one end, there's the technician.

411
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:06,240
And on the other end, there's the artist or the creative.

412
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:11,320
And while you can be on either end, there's often this scale.

413
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:17,000
And that's, for me, easy to see in my own photography is that there are very artistic

414
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:22,360
photographers who aren't necessarily technically sound, but if they can get to the point where

415
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:27,520
their technical ability is enough, good enough, they can get the shot that they can get the

416
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:33,120
artistry through, then that has a certain positive impact.

417
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:39,520
And you can have technicians, which are really, they're fabulous at the nitty gritty of settings

418
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:42,400
and, and lighting and things like this.

419
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:44,600
But they don't necessarily have the artistry.

420
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:47,880
And there's obviously the whole scale, everything in between there.

421
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:52,520
Yeah, and I imagine that's much the same for what we were just discussing, which is that

422
00:22:52,520 --> 00:23:00,240
you can have very technical implementers of solutions in tech, and also the artists who

423
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:06,480
tend to craft the initial projects or the initial solutions, and then someone else maintains

424
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:07,480
it.

425
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:08,480
Yes.

426
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:09,480
Yeah, exactly.

427
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:11,760
And maybe you can throw like the like research arm somewhere in here.

428
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:17,080
So you have some ideas spinning out of this idea factory, and then there's like the middle

429
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:20,960
layer of people that can find good ideas, maybe they don't come up with them out of

430
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:26,380
whole cloth, but sort of steward, shepherd them, help them grow, evaluate them.

431
00:23:26,380 --> 00:23:30,100
And then maybe there's another few layers of people that you say, yeah, actually go

432
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:34,840
operate the thing, you know, turn that into a repeatable pattern that gets standardized.

433
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:36,760
Because there is a lot of value in that, right?

434
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:40,840
Like you're saying, like you want people that are focused on repeatability and reliability

435
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:42,720
and just smooth running.

436
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:46,600
Yeah, I can play that role, but it's probably not my favorite.

437
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:52,240
But for you, is it more interesting than to, to come in and build something and then hand

438
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:53,240
that off to someone?

439
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:57,920
Somewhere in the middle, I guess, I mean, I enjoy a lot of the different aspects.

440
00:23:57,920 --> 00:24:03,440
It can be neat, when you do a little bit of all the flip side.

441
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:08,240
Challenge of that, of course, is you don't often get to control how what the relative

442
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:11,840
amounts of each unit of those are fair enough.

443
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:14,320
Yeah, kind of depends.

444
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:21,000
But I don't, I don't think I could be happy long term in probably stuck on either extreme

445
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,000
of those, you know?

446
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,000
Too much of anything.

447
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,000
Yeah.

448
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,360
And I think you also need some people, good people in the middle who can talk to both

449
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:27,600
sides.

450
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:28,960
Because there's a lot to learn.

451
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:31,280
And that's been some of the problems, at least in the software side, we've seen that we're

452
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:35,840
trying to get over as an industry is not having enough feedback between the people making

453
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:38,160
the ideas and people actually using the ideas.

454
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:39,160
Isn't that true?

455
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:40,160
Yeah, for sure.

456
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:41,160
We're seeing that on the desktop.

457
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:44,440
And for you, you've seen that in a lot of the infrastructure that you've built throughout

458
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:45,440
the years as well.

459
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:50,000
And you just end up with, you know, perverse patterns, not good communication, angry people,

460
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,000
right?

461
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,000
Because you can make it work in lots of ways.

462
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,960
You just need information and communication to flow.

463
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:55,960
Right.

464
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:59,440
You know, they say that for relationships, but I suppose that's true of most things is

465
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:01,880
that communication is is key, right?

466
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:06,040
If you're if you're working on the wrong problem, then it doesn't matter how fancy the solution

467
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:07,040
you come up with.

468
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:08,040
Right.

469
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:10,680
And you have to constantly evaluate that because as we were talking about earlier, you know,

470
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:15,640
like, yeah, there's these, there's inertia to some of these ideas to what you want to

471
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:17,560
work on and what you are working on.

472
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:19,560
Important to manage that.

473
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:20,560
Yeah.

474
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:26,680
For you and some of your previous roles outside of JB, were you working with really big teams

475
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:31,840
and is moving to JB like a much smaller team or are you generally generally working in

476
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:32,840
small groups?

477
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:38,440
I have been part of some larger teams, although most of my previous experience have been about

478
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:40,560
the JB size, maybe a little bit bigger.

479
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:46,460
Really embedded in a larger sort of corporate structure, I'd say, or working with a larger

480
00:25:46,460 --> 00:25:49,320
array of other teams that I would work with closely.

481
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:53,960
I've also been on the opposite side where I've had, you know, one of my longer term

482
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:55,840
positions.

483
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:59,800
I was just working basically with one other person most of the time.

484
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:00,800
Right.

485
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:01,800
Thankfully, I really enjoyed working with.

486
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:04,840
Yeah, I was just about thinking that change that can change things.

487
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:05,840
Yeah.

488
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:10,120
That's kind of what we're talking about earlier is he really complimented me in that he was

489
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:14,400
he was very practical, very much happy to just, you know, didn't didn't fuss was totally

490
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:17,840
willing to just bang something out and not be a perfectionist about it at all.

491
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:19,800
So we made a very effective pair, I think.

492
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:22,360
And this was someone who was like, side by side on the hierarchy?

493
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:23,360
Yeah, yeah.

494
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:28,200
We were basically a two person team managing a bunch of internal tooling for a company.

495
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:29,200
Okay.

496
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:32,600
And was it someone who had the foresight to place both of you together because they saw

497
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:35,960
the strengths and weaknesses of each or was it just happenstance?

498
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:41,160
You know, it was organic survival, I think.

499
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:44,400
You know, because we just kind of found he he did happen to be the person who trained

500
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:45,400
me.

501
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:46,400
Okay.

502
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:49,160
But we worked different times after the training period.

503
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:53,040
I think it just kind of came together that we both had a, you know, drive to do other

504
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:54,040
things.

505
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:56,400
So we wanted to move in from where we were at presently.

506
00:26:56,400 --> 00:27:02,200
And I think I value that he was very competent, you know, just like knew what was wrong, or

507
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:07,640
if he was writing code that was sloppy, it was managed expectations with clear communication,

508
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:09,360
like, look, I just did this thing.

509
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:10,360
It's not perfect, whatever.

510
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:11,600
Like, I did it to solve this problem.

511
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:12,600
It's solved.

512
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:13,600
Do you have input?

513
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:14,920
And then move on.

514
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:18,360
And then I think he liked in me that I was willing to spend a little more time with the

515
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:24,480
ideas that that made sense to and would find, you know, optimizations or other ideas or

516
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:27,360
total alternatives that he just wouldn't have spent the time to think about.

517
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:28,360
Right.

518
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:33,480
So he was more willing to invest in the projects to see them be smoother long term.

519
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:34,480
So he would call it West work.

520
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:38,440
You know, there'd be like, shares of stuff where it's like, oh, man, like, I don't know,

521
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:39,440
like, you deal with that.

522
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:41,320
And then there'd be the other share, we'd be like, well, that's West work.

523
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:44,920
And you go research those topics and come back to me with what you think we should do.

524
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:45,920
That's awesome.

525
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:51,000
And there were no clashes during the training, because I have often experienced that when

526
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,880
you're teaching someone something, you can have all these different styles.

527
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:57,400
And I imagine for two people who sort of operate differently in their minds, that there would

528
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:59,000
be a difference in style.

529
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,680
Yeah, that is true that it can often be very difficult.

530
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:03,680
Not that I remember.

531
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:10,680
No, I think I think this individual in particular happens to be very direct.

532
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:16,640
I think I think that helped and doesn't be I think because of the personality we're describing,

533
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:20,000
doesn't have a lot of ego tied up in that knowledge.

534
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:23,120
I mean, if you question his performance or something he was proud of, you know, whatever

535
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:27,800
normal human operations there, but, you know, it didn't have to be this battle of like,

536
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:28,800
well, do you know this or not?

537
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:33,520
And there's no like, right, passive aggressiveness about what you knew or didn't knew.

538
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:35,560
And yeah, just no, no games.

539
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:36,560
Sounds like a great collaboration.

540
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:37,560
Really?

541
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:38,560
Yeah, it was it was right.

542
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:41,400
It was time to move on from that job when I did, but that was the hardest part was there's

543
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:45,800
just never worked with someone so closely because I don't like in school and things

544
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:49,480
I enjoy collaboration I do and I mean, I suppose I'd have to work in here now.

545
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:50,780
Fair enough.

546
00:28:50,780 --> 00:28:52,680
Sometimes you know what you're doing.

547
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:53,680
I love teaching.

548
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:54,680
Don't get me wrong.

549
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:55,680
But sometimes you know what you're doing.

550
00:28:55,680 --> 00:29:02,000
I don't always enjoy the rocky road, like I don't mind check ins, you know.

551
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:06,200
So like, I played around some ideas, come back after a couple hours, meet, discuss where

552
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:11,200
everyone got but I really found I didn't enjoy more active collaboration, at least in some

553
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:15,800
domains where I just wanted to be left alone and think and just do it by myself.

554
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:20,000
So I would often find myself in roles of like on projects, I would just make myself the

555
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:23,280
editor or whatever, you know, be like, right, you guys go do your things.

556
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:26,320
I'll tie this up together and make it look nice at the end.

557
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:28,560
Would you tie that into introvertedness for you?

558
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:29,560
Hmm.

559
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:30,800
That's a good question.

560
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:36,080
You know, I read this really great book called Quiet, which the it's a very well known book

561
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:38,760
and I forget the author now it's Susan Kane.

562
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:39,760
Okay.

563
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:44,720
This was a book that was recommended to me and when I read it, it taught me so much about

564
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:46,720
my own inner workings.

565
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:47,720
Oh, interesting.

566
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:50,840
It's one of those books that enlighten you about yourself.

567
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:51,840
That's useful.

568
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:52,840
Which are some of my favorite books.

569
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:53,840
Yeah.

570
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:59,640
But it did so in a way that made me more aware of the methods I needed to use in teamwork

571
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:04,080
to produce the best work because I know for myself if I'm constantly interrupted, or if

572
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:09,300
I don't have the time to hyper focus, which takes me a long time to get into, then I can

573
00:30:09,300 --> 00:30:12,080
never create my best work.

574
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:16,800
And it sounds at least I see similarities for you, even when you have a really good

575
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:18,720
collaborations even with just one person.

576
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:19,720
Yes.

577
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:20,720
No, absolutely.

578
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:24,560
Like, I guess I guess I get tired of sort of like, should we explore this idea or not

579
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:27,360
and people have different notions.

580
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:29,160
I don't I don't want to talk about it.

581
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:32,840
We can talk about if it's right or not, but I'm just gonna explore the ideas I want to

582
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:33,840
explore.

583
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:34,840
Yeah.

584
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:35,840
And it seems to work mostly.

585
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:40,240
I mean, I find it honestly, I find it very different that the at least in that style,

586
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:44,000
maybe it's just maybe it's age, maybe it's different subject matter, because a lot of

587
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:49,520
those interactions around math and physics and a little more not not creative, but a

588
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:54,560
little a little more right and wrong binary sort of things.

589
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:59,360
I don't I don't have that experience really at all, I would say working JB at that may

590
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:01,000
also be the people involved.

591
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,000
There's a lot of variables.

592
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,000
Interesting.

593
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,320
I hadn't thought about it that way.

594
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:06,320
I do.

595
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:07,320
I do agree with you, though.

596
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:13,000
I find myself in the same boat, I do need time to think and while I can operate under

597
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:17,240
pressure, you're right, I wouldn't do my best work that way, you know, it'd be much better

598
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:21,360
to just go like, give me 20 minutes, I'm gonna go over here in the closet, and then I'll

599
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:23,820
come back out and then we'll have your thing that you need.

600
00:31:23,820 --> 00:31:25,880
That sounds so familiar, right?

601
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:30,560
I'm very impressed by people that can operate in other styles, you know, some, even some

602
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:36,560
of our team members at JB, it's like, doing all number of tasks at the same time and multiplexing

603
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:38,840
and I just doesn't make sense to me.

604
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:43,160
Yeah, some of us can require pressure to perform.

605
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:44,160
Yeah, that's true.

606
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:50,160
It is, I found for myself that it is true that same as you, it's true that I can perform

607
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:52,880
under pressure and quite well when I need to.

608
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:56,400
But the level of exhaustion is quite high.

609
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:59,540
So I can do that for a short period of time, right before you just burn out.

610
00:31:59,540 --> 00:32:00,540
That's it.

611
00:32:00,540 --> 00:32:06,960
Or, like you said, if you give me 20 minutes with headphones away from the world, and then

612
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:09,200
I'll get it done faster.

613
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:12,400
Nothing like being watched while you work too, you know, just makes it, everything goes

614
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:13,400
slower.

615
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:14,400
Someone over your shoulder, right?

616
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:18,960
Depends on what you're doing, of course, and how well you know it, but there is probably

617
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:22,240
an aspect to what you're asking, like with the introverted sense, probably some of that,

618
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:31,480
at least is maybe not introvertedness, but not desiring excess conflict.

619
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:33,960
I don't think I'm conflict averse necessarily.

620
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:37,760
But like in that example, I just would get tired of like, I don't want to argue about

621
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:38,760
this right now.

622
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:40,760
You know, like, it's just not worth my time to debate this.

623
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:45,560
Well, and I've picked up on you being quite agreeable as well.

624
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:49,360
I suppose that's the flip side of saying that.

625
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:50,360
Yeah.

626
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:51,360
Right.

627
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:54,720
So you can, which is a gift, because everybody likes you.

628
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:59,200
And it can also be a bit of a challenge in that other people's ideas sometimes trump

629
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:01,360
your own even in your own mind.

630
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:04,600
I say that from personal experience, because I'm just I'm quite agreeable as well.

631
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:09,320
And sometimes you put your own ideas on the back burner simply because someone else is

632
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:11,000
willing to fight stronger for theirs.

633
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,000
Yeah, that is true.

634
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,000
Yeah.

635
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:16,880
You know, there's a, the fight costs me more than it does to them.

636
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:19,640
So I have to care more about the idea to make it worth it.

637
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:20,640
Ah, that's fascinating.

638
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:21,640
I like that.

639
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:25,480
This compatriot that I really enjoyed work with, he complimented me there as well.

640
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:28,680
He's happy to argue about anything just to just to argue about it.

641
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:29,680
Okay.

642
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:30,920
So that worked out nicely, too.

643
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:32,840
Because you just give up sooner and he'd win.

644
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:33,840
Right.

645
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:34,840
Well, and I could just let him fight the battle.

646
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:37,840
You know, I could back him up with with whatever research and as a team.

647
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:39,280
Oh, that's fascinating.

648
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:41,000
But he was willing to push a little bit more.

649
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,920
And then I mean, if he's gonna do it, then I'm gonna support it.

650
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:44,920
Yeah, of course.

651
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:45,920
It's easy to support.

652
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:46,920
It's easy to support.

653
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:47,920
Yeah.

654
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:48,920
Nice.

655
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:52,600
So you're saying I just need to find myself someone who's willing to fight my fights?

656
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:53,600
I think so.

657
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:54,600
Yeah.

658
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:55,600
Okay.

659
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:56,680
Now, if I had them, I'd be willing to rent.

660
00:33:56,680 --> 00:34:01,440
But unfortunately, we no longer work together.

661
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:02,440
Do you ever?

662
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:04,520
I don't think we necessarily struggle for this.

663
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:11,080
But sometimes if you have multiple agreeable people, decisions, they won't agree or won't

664
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:14,200
be able to there's not enough care in one direction.

665
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:17,600
Like if I said, Hey, Wes, what kind of pizza would you like to see that I think I could

666
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:18,600
decide.

667
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:19,600
Really?

668
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:20,600
Yeah, it depends, too.

669
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:24,620
You know, there's, um, there's sort of like an open and a closed agreeability.

670
00:34:24,620 --> 00:34:25,620
That's true.

671
00:34:25,620 --> 00:34:27,840
I don't worry about telling you what kind of pizza I want.

672
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:32,480
Because I know that if you you're agreeable, but you're also open enough to the interaction

673
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:36,600
we're having that you would tell me if you if you weren't interested in that pizza.

674
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:39,640
But there's some types of agreeable, I think that that's not true.

675
00:34:39,640 --> 00:34:42,560
And then I worry more about that.

676
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:46,600
And then might not want to suggest the thing because I don't you know, it just gets a little

677
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:47,600
more complicated.

678
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:50,800
These internal processes are just fascinating.

679
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:56,840
And once you start picking up on them for yourself, and also for others, you those interactions,

680
00:34:56,840 --> 00:35:00,920
like those non language interactions that happen between two people trying to decide

681
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:03,960
what kind of pizza to have can be fascinating.

682
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:04,960
Yes.

683
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:08,280
It's even harder when I mean, at least we're talking about pizza, I kind of know like what

684
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:11,160
pizza like, it's even worse when you take it one layer up, like, what do you want to

685
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:12,160
eat?

686
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:15,080
Oh, that like one person's hungry, like, what do you want to eat?

687
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:19,320
One trick I got from Tim Ferriss that really helped me from his book for our workweek was

688
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:24,520
to, instead of asking, what does everyone want to eat, especially if you're in a group

689
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:26,560
of like, three people or more, right?

690
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:30,160
There basically will be no answer, no useful answer given.

691
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:34,280
Or you won't even you'll just get on to a different topic entirely.

692
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:35,280
Quickly derail.

693
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:36,280
Oh, yeah.

694
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:37,280
Oh, yeah.

695
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:38,280
We saw we see that all the time.

696
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:39,280
Right.

697
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:42,980
But what I've been trying to implement, and I haven't thought about it in a while.

698
00:35:42,980 --> 00:35:48,600
So either I've succeeded or failed, I'm not sure if I is to instead of asking the question,

699
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:54,440
what would you like to have is to put out a suggestion, right and ask if that works.

700
00:35:54,440 --> 00:36:02,240
And when I have practiced this, I've noticed a big difference in everyone's level of agreeing

701
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:07,120
to ideas, and the speed at which these ideas can happen.

702
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:10,040
So in working with in teams, right?

703
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:14,600
This could save a lot of time, you know, you're coming to it with solutions instead of just

704
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:15,600
questions.

705
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:16,600
All of that, I think applies.

706
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:22,360
I mean, because the thing about this, you know, creative work, it's kind of the same

707
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:26,240
like the open closed, because it can be really useful to have someone start even if it's

708
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:30,380
just a terrible idea, right, but just to throw it out there and sort of get the ball rolling.

709
00:36:30,380 --> 00:36:35,240
But that requires enough openness and trust in the group that you can feel confident that

710
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:37,560
like, that idea doesn't represent you.

711
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:38,560
It's just a thing.

712
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:41,960
You're just saying it right here, which is often true for what do you want to eat, but

713
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:45,520
doesn't always carry over to what should we title the report.

714
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:49,680
We're both brainstorming in a sense.

715
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:51,840
And what's interesting is that everyone has a stake, right?

716
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:57,840
And so some of the I read a really great book that was given to me by my uncle, who is almost

717
00:36:57,840 --> 00:37:00,560
identical to me.

718
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:01,560
Like I'm a younger

719
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:02,560
Is his name also Brett?

720
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:03,560
Can we call him Uncle Brett?

721
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:04,720
You could his name is actually Ray Allen.

722
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:06,340
He's a great, great guy.

723
00:37:06,340 --> 00:37:11,960
But he has taught me he has taught me a lot about my own inner workings in that he's kind

724
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:19,980
of a few decades ahead of me and has all this experience and dilutes that into what is helpful

725
00:37:19,980 --> 00:37:24,120
for me at my own stage of life, which is if you can find someone like that for yourself,

726
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:25,120
it is fabulous.

727
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:31,000
Does it work if I like just try to talk to like a face app aged picture of myself?

728
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,000
You could start there

729
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:36,000
because I'm doing that already.

730
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:39,700
Gentlemen I'll sneak in here if I can borrow the studio for a moment and tell everyone

731
00:37:39,700 --> 00:37:40,960
about Data Dog.

732
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:46,180
Let's go solve some problems and analyze code level performance across your entire environment

733
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:49,480
and troubleshoot issues faster with Data Dog.

734
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:52,420
datadog.com slash coder radio.

735
00:37:52,420 --> 00:37:54,600
Go there to get a 14 day trial.

736
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:59,840
And if you set up a dashboard and use that URL, you can also get a free Data Dog t shirt.

737
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:03,920
Data Dog is continuous profiler automatically collects profiles from your production servers

738

all the time.

739
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:08,360
I'm talking the entire stack everyone like the whole dang thing from the metal all the

740
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:10,040
way up to the applications.

741
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:14,240
So you can analyze any of that data you need quickly with minimal overhead and you get

742
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:19,220
a unified picture of your environment by correlating code performance metrics with your other monitoring

743
00:38:19,220 --> 00:38:24,820
data with these beautiful, gorgeous, fantastic, slick real time dashboards.

744
00:38:24,820 --> 00:38:29,800
You should go to datadog.com slash coder radio just to see the dashboards.

745
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:34,260
But now they have over 450 integrations that allow you to do tracing and log management

746
00:38:34,260 --> 00:38:37,680
and that continuous profiler all in one platform.

747
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:41,160
I mean, they're actually talking and analyzing your applications too.

748
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:45,040
Can you imagine how this enables you to visualize and communicate across your team?

749
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:49,520
Data Dog gives you the tools to pinpoint the root cause of issues faster than ever.

radio.

752
00:38:55,860 --> 00:39:00,040
And like I said, for a limited time, if you start that free trial and you create one dashboard,

753
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:07,560
you're going to get a free Data Dog t shirt, free swag, datadog.com slash coder radio.

754
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:12,520
Back to this book, this book he gave me, which he gave to me like 10 years before I read

755
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:13,520
it.

756
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:14,520
Oh, right.

757
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:15,520
Wow.

758
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:17,260
It was the kind of book you're like, I think that's really interesting and yet not interesting

759
00:39:17,260 --> 00:39:18,320
enough to dive into.

760
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:19,320
But I finally did.

761
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:20,700
It's called The Six Thinking Hats.

762
00:39:20,700 --> 00:39:26,460
And it's all about simply, it's a brainstorming technique.

763
00:39:26,460 --> 00:39:30,000
And I'm sure we can link to a Wikipedia page that would describe this a little bit more

764
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,740
sensibly than I would.

765
00:39:32,740 --> 00:39:39,360
But the main nugget I got from it is that brainstorming should be a protected area.

766
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:45,640
You can do brainstorming with other people in a way that is methodical, and yet still

767
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:47,200
very creative.

768
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:52,700
And so the process in this book is basically, there's six hats, and they all represent a

769
00:39:52,700 --> 00:39:53,960
different way of thinking.

770
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:59,240
And when you're in a hat, everyone's wearing, you know, quote unquote, the hat.

771
00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:01,780
And I forget what they are, but they're fascinating if you want to look into them.

772
00:40:01,780 --> 00:40:09,840
And so one of them might be, like, just throw out any idea at all that fits within creativity,

773
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:10,840
for instance.

774
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:13,720
And so obviously, you're gonna have some people on the team who are a little bit stronger

775
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:14,720
at that stuff.

776
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:16,480
So that's their time to shine.

777
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:21,080
And yet when you put on different hats, it relates to some other team members' strengths.

778
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:24,320
But the most important part for any brainstorming, whether you're trying to decide what kind

779
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:28,080
of ice cream you want, or what kind of pizza or where to take a certain project is for

780
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:33,640
it to be, like you said, a protected area where you're not sort of chastised for sending

781
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:40,780
out what are seemingly bad ideas, but might lead to nuggets that are invaluable.

782
00:40:40,780 --> 00:40:46,240
And it's something I've only recently learned to do well.

783
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:48,200
But that I see it being kind of a challenge, right?

784
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:49,200
Oh, that's, yeah, right.

785
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:53,160
And I don't know that we all think about it as much as we probably should.

786
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:56,340
It's interesting, too, what you're talking about, too, like how structure can sometimes

787
00:40:56,340 --> 00:40:58,320
provide that.

788
00:40:58,320 --> 00:41:02,320
We all know the rules and like how it's happening.

789
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:05,620
It's somehow a little bit bizarre to talk about structure and creativity in the same

790
00:41:05,620 --> 00:41:08,120
sentence in a way.

791
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:12,760
That's another part, I guess, like kind of one of the themes in this whole conversation.

792
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:17,200
We have these words and notions, but we don't, many people do, good books, right, what we're

793
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:18,200
talking about.

794
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:22,640
But generally, we don't necessarily dive into it or try to study or bisect, right?

795
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:24,080
Like, oh, you're just creative.

796
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:25,920
Brent, how do you take such good photos?

797
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:26,920
I have no idea.

798
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:31,560
I'm not going to conceptualize it, but I mean, there is some element of like, well, you see

799
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:34,320
photos that you want to take and you take them.

800
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:36,480
That's over simplification, but I'll take it.

801
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:42,120
But there's both a lot of structure and a lot of whatever inherent creativity, artistic

802
00:41:42,120 --> 00:41:43,120
sense.

803
00:41:43,120 --> 00:41:45,580
So there's this great website that I'm not sure if you know about.

804
00:41:45,580 --> 00:41:46,580
It's called Brain Pickings.

805
00:41:46,580 --> 00:41:47,580
Tell me more.

806
00:41:47,580 --> 00:41:55,960
I believe the author is Mary Popova, and what she does is dives into a lot of literary work

807
00:41:55,960 --> 00:41:57,800
and extracts nuggets.

808
00:41:57,800 --> 00:42:04,840
And one post I saw that always sticks for me is describing the methods that writers

809
00:42:04,840 --> 00:42:14,120
use and some really historical writers use to begin their writing process on a daily

810
00:42:14,120 --> 00:42:15,120
basis.

811
00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:19,880
So that's the juxtaposition, again, of structure and creativity, right?

812
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:26,200
They have applied this structure to their day that optimizes their creative time, right?

813
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:30,520
Which probably doesn't always fit in whatever other random society and post structures.

814
00:42:30,520 --> 00:42:32,040
Yeah, fair enough.

815
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:36,640
But what's fascinating about that to me is that you really need to know yourself well

816
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:39,280
to be able to establish that structure in the first place, right?

817
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:41,440
Yeah, no one's going to tell you how to find it.

818
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:42,440
Yeah.

819
00:42:42,440 --> 00:42:47,520
And do you have any such routines or, well, you were mentioning earlier when you came

820
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:50,520
in that the Sprint sort of shook up your routines.

821
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:51,520
That is certainly true.

822
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:57,400
You know, just changing, having everyone here and doing all kinds of different things.

823
00:42:57,400 --> 00:43:04,380
I'd say I'm reforming some routines because I had routines for a more traditional type

824
00:43:04,380 --> 00:43:10,800
of role or at least hours, and I have a few things I'm figuring out, I think, that I like,

825
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:17,640
but I've kind of gone back to a blank slate, at least somewhat, and I've been actively

826
00:43:17,640 --> 00:43:18,640
exploring.

827
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:24,000
I think I do really like sometimes just starting work immediately in the morning, which is

828
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:27,080
one advantage of working from home is that you can do that.

829
00:43:27,080 --> 00:43:30,760
You do have to then have the flexibility to then, you know, stop at some point and go

830
00:43:30,760 --> 00:43:32,440
do like regular morning activities.

831
00:43:32,440 --> 00:43:33,440
Right.

832
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:34,440
Like feeding yourself.

833
00:43:34,440 --> 00:43:37,840
Yeah, feeding yourself, your animals, I don't know, maybe going outside, that sort of thing.

834
00:43:37,840 --> 00:43:38,840
Seeing the world.

835
00:43:38,840 --> 00:43:39,840
Uh-huh.

836
00:43:39,840 --> 00:43:43,800
But there's something about this early morning, I'm not generally a morning person, I really

837
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:44,800
like the morning.

838
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:48,160
I'm just bad at going to sleep and enjoy being awake at night.

839
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:50,040
It just seems to be what I gravitate to.

840
00:43:50,040 --> 00:43:56,480
But I love being up in the morning, so if I can't, but it seems to be the most enjoyable

841
00:43:56,480 --> 00:44:01,000
if I've been up the night before, not super later, but you know, I've been working on

842
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:04,740
the thing, actively engaged, got a good night's sleep, and then I can just like jump into

843
00:44:04,740 --> 00:44:11,400
it because the early morning hours and then like afternoon are probably my best productivity

844
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:12,400
times.

845
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:13,400
Okay.

846
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:17,560
Do you find that, well, wait a second, I'm going to challenge you there because you mentioned

847
00:44:17,560 --> 00:44:20,160
working late night on something.

848
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:23,520
I do also, late night can work.

849
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:24,520
That's a little more variable.

850
00:44:24,520 --> 00:44:26,400
It depends a lot on how the day has gone.

851
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:32,760
I think it was a better time when my job was more predictable.

852
00:44:32,760 --> 00:44:37,160
These days, it depends a lot on what happens in the day, how many shows we did, you know,

853
00:44:37,160 --> 00:44:38,160
whatever.

854
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:41,040
And so late night isn't always.

855
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:46,160
If I have the schedule flexibility, and that depends too, I will sometimes do a hybrid

856
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:49,820
where I'll just go to bed and then wake up at like two and then work from like two to

857
00:44:49,820 --> 00:44:52,180
five and that also can be very productive.

858
00:44:52,180 --> 00:44:53,180
That's two to five a.m.

859
00:44:53,180 --> 00:44:54,180
Yeah.

860
00:44:54,180 --> 00:44:55,180
Wow.

861
00:44:55,180 --> 00:44:58,000
There's just something about the times when like no one else is up, there's no distractions.

862
00:44:58,000 --> 00:44:59,000
I've heard this before.

863
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:00,000
Yeah, for sure.

864
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:05,520
And two, it is one of the challenges, you know, with like working from home can be dividing

865
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:09,440
those like, when you're doing life things, when you're doing job things, how do those

866
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:11,780
mingle and where's the border?

867
00:45:11,780 --> 00:45:12,780
There's not a lot of board.

868
00:45:12,780 --> 00:45:15,200
I mean, like, you can just define what you're doing, you know, it's a chunk of time that

869
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:17,080
you don't have any conceptions about.

870
00:45:17,080 --> 00:45:20,480
And so you can just assign it to something.

871
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:23,080
And from two to five, nothing else is going to demand of your time.

872
00:45:23,080 --> 00:45:26,080
No, I don't have no plans.

873
00:45:26,080 --> 00:45:27,080
Thankfully.

874
00:45:27,080 --> 00:45:29,420
Well, the only plan you have is the plan you want.

875
00:45:29,420 --> 00:45:33,120
But I've so I've recently sort of rediscovered that I knew that, like in college, I would

876
00:45:33,120 --> 00:45:36,640
frequently, you know, stay up late working and be like, I'm just like too tired to be

877
00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:40,440
productive, and then have to wake up early to get the assignment done or whatever.

878
00:45:40,440 --> 00:45:44,480
And I think working a more traditional schedule, I kind of forgot about that.

879
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:47,120
So I'm rediscovering it to an extent.

880
00:45:47,120 --> 00:45:51,840
There's something to be said about working at your best times for you personally.

881
00:45:51,840 --> 00:45:56,120
And sometimes our nine to fives can really challenge that even though they're there in

882
00:45:56,120 --> 00:46:01,760
place to try to make it easier or more productive for the general populace, but what I've discovered

883
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:06,080
as many for many of us, especially in the tech sphere, this late night stuff or early

884
00:46:06,080 --> 00:46:07,560
morning stuff is more jam.

885
00:46:07,560 --> 00:46:08,560
Mm hmm.

886
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:09,560
I don't know.

887
00:46:09,560 --> 00:46:13,920
There's something about like, the late morning that's just not a productive Yep.

888
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:18,120
So it's either I'm going to like sleep in and you know, stroll into work at like 1030.

889
00:46:18,120 --> 00:46:22,680
Or you might as well I just just let me work from like, you know, six to nine or something

890
00:46:22,680 --> 00:46:24,160
then I'll come in in the afternoon.

891
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:25,160
Right.

892
00:46:25,160 --> 00:46:30,920
Is there anything then that you've not had a work from a distance or work from home flexibility

893
00:46:30,920 --> 00:46:38,920
in any previous I have, but those the hours were still more traditional, and most of them

894
00:46:38,920 --> 00:46:41,800
were not totally remote, it would be like a hybrid sort of thing.

895
00:46:41,800 --> 00:46:42,800
Okay.

896
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:46,560
So I was still at least in the culture of the office, right?

897
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:48,880
Just from a slight distance, just from a slight distance.

898
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:49,880
Yeah, exactly.

899
00:46:49,880 --> 00:46:53,720
And so this is kind of the first opportunity, at least in a while where I can be like, Well,

900
00:46:53,720 --> 00:46:56,400
if I want to get weird with it, I can.

901
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:57,400
Let's shake it up.

902
00:46:57,400 --> 00:46:58,400
Yeah, right?

903
00:46:58,400 --> 00:46:59,400
Why not?

904
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:00,400
And I mean, that happens anyway, right?

905
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:04,280
A lot of the team is on weird schedules, just because we all live in different time zones.

906
00:47:04,280 --> 00:47:06,240
So we're a little bit all over the world, right?

907
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:07,240
Mm hmm.

908
00:47:07,240 --> 00:47:14,840
I mean, you look at Joe, and I will ask him this a little bit more Joe has basically set

909
00:47:14,840 --> 00:47:18,280
his internal clock to a completely different time zone across the world.

910
00:47:18,280 --> 00:47:21,680
So I'm very fascinated about that.

911
00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:25,520
For you working late night on a project, and then sleeping and waking up.

912
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:27,440
You mentioned that works really well for you.

913
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:30,920
Do you find that there's something about the process of sleeping with an idea in your mind

914
00:47:30,920 --> 00:47:31,920
that

915
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:32,920
Oh, yeah, definitely.

916
00:47:32,920 --> 00:47:36,960
I'm a big proponent of the one of my favorite people, Rich Hickey, who's the guy who made

917
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:39,720
the Clojure programming language.

918
00:47:39,720 --> 00:47:45,000
He calls it hammock time, but just just really tries to underscore the value of like, thinking,

919
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:48,420
you know, and turning things over in your mind before doing.

920
00:47:48,420 --> 00:47:49,420
Doing is important to you.

921
00:47:49,420 --> 00:47:50,420
And that's a separate conversation.

922
00:47:50,420 --> 00:47:52,600
So I value that a lot.

923
00:47:52,600 --> 00:47:58,280
I really enjoy, you know, that time when you haven't quite fallen asleep, but you're not

924
00:47:58,280 --> 00:48:03,440
quite you're not 100% rational, you're not you're lucid, but not totally.

925
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:04,600
I think that is a great time.

926
00:48:04,600 --> 00:48:09,640
So that can be a kind of enjoyment too, you know, just like taking a break, having been

927
00:48:09,640 --> 00:48:13,720
a little more relaxed, just laying not worrying either, maybe you fall asleep, maybe not,

928
00:48:13,720 --> 00:48:14,720
it's okay, either way.

929
00:48:14,720 --> 00:48:18,800
That can be some of the best times you can resolve or just make clear something you're

930
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:19,800
trying to work out.

931
00:48:19,800 --> 00:48:24,360
Yeah, there's a real like, freedom of ideas, right without constraint.

932
00:48:24,360 --> 00:48:28,640
And I think we're easy on ourselves in those times, because we're like, bye, we could just

933
00:48:28,640 --> 00:48:31,400
like, that's kind of like dreaming, and I don't need to commit to anything.

934
00:48:31,400 --> 00:48:33,680
Yes, you don't have to follow down, you may not even write it down.

935
00:48:33,680 --> 00:48:36,760
You can just it's a true exploration, isn't it?

936
00:48:36,760 --> 00:48:38,480
Have you done any meditation?

937
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:42,600
Because I know that meditation can sometimes Oh, yeah, no, I am.

938
00:48:42,600 --> 00:48:47,400
That's one of the things that has been sort of disrupted in my routine lately.

939
00:48:47,400 --> 00:48:49,840
I definitely enjoy meditation.

940
00:48:49,840 --> 00:48:56,480
I could probably stand to do it on a more regular basis, but it is a usual part of some

941
00:48:56,480 --> 00:48:57,480
of my routines.

942
00:48:57,480 --> 00:48:58,480
Okay.

943
00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:06,080
And do you find it useful for you to gain just general clarity or more of an idea sphere?

944
00:49:06,080 --> 00:49:10,240
Um, yeah, I guess I it can it can be both.

945
00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:16,080
The ideas sphere is maybe a more constrained activity, or at least not constrained in what

946
00:49:16,080 --> 00:49:19,440
it is, but constrained in time and place.

947
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:28,720
But for general meditation, I find it very useful just to set the tone and whatever I'm

948
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:33,400
gonna call it brain tone, but you know, like the the thematics of how your day is going

949
00:49:33,400 --> 00:49:37,360
and what you're thinking about, because it's so easy to get trapped in like random little

950
00:49:37,360 --> 00:49:43,440
brain loops where you're thinking about something good or bad might not be what you should really

951
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:46,500
be thinking about or want to be thinking about.

952
00:49:46,500 --> 00:49:53,720
And it seems like one of the more useful tools I have also, especially like with more creative

953
00:49:53,720 --> 00:50:01,320
work or different timelines, trying to bring a sense of priority and understanding to all

954
00:50:01,320 --> 00:50:04,920
of the things that might be going on at a time, like collecting all the things and sorting

955
00:50:04,920 --> 00:50:05,920
them like a triage.

956
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:10,640
Yeah, but but in a peaceful, you know, not in a not in a hurry way to not focusing on

957
00:50:10,640 --> 00:50:14,600
any of them, but just sort of, I guess I would say it's more of like an acknowledgement.

958
00:50:14,600 --> 00:50:18,080
It's sort of, you know, you're looking around the room and being like, yep, all right, that's

959
00:50:18,080 --> 00:50:19,080
over there.

960
00:50:19,080 --> 00:50:20,080
I see.

961
00:50:20,080 --> 00:50:21,080
Yes, in the corner, too.

962
00:50:21,080 --> 00:50:22,080
And there's no judgments.

963
00:50:22,080 --> 00:50:26,380
There's no as little emotion as you can and just sort of accepting that those are there.

964
00:50:26,380 --> 00:50:30,840
And then when you're done, now you have the time to go engage with the ones.

965
00:50:30,840 --> 00:50:31,840
Right.

966
00:50:31,840 --> 00:50:37,560
I found often in that for me, items that have otherwise been forgotten tend to start floating

967
00:50:37,560 --> 00:50:42,700
up yet I'm not sure where they come from, or who's asking them to float.

968
00:50:42,700 --> 00:50:48,360
But that can really bring to mind some things that in a what I'll call a waking state, but

969
00:50:48,360 --> 00:50:54,120
a non meditative state, I suppose, our everyday state, our usual operating state, it are things

970
00:50:54,120 --> 00:50:58,100
that get sort of forgotten, despite their importance.

971
00:50:58,100 --> 00:51:02,440
It's almost like a scale from importance to urgency.

972
00:51:02,440 --> 00:51:07,840
And what we're aware of immediately is what's urgent, yes, but isn't necessarily what's

973
00:51:07,840 --> 00:51:08,840
most important.

974
00:51:08,840 --> 00:51:12,640
There's a lot of urgent things I have to do all the time then.

975
00:51:12,640 --> 00:51:17,280
While an important part of my life are not something I would think of as an overarching

976
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:21,000
bigger sort of goal or task or anything.

977
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:22,760
Yeah, that is true, right?

978
00:51:22,760 --> 00:51:27,060
Because a lot of the themes in your life are like, you know, things you're proud of things

979
00:51:27,060 --> 00:51:31,760
you've committed to things you've built or learned or enjoyed.

980
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:34,880
But most of the time, those are not the urgent things are the things you have to plan for

981
00:51:34,880 --> 00:51:39,920
or think about a lot to be able to actually do and probably takes time to look back and

982
00:51:39,920 --> 00:51:40,920
actually appreciate.

983
00:51:40,920 --> 00:51:41,920
Right.

984
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:45,440
And the rest of it's all like, well, the trash has to go out.

985
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:46,440
Someone's got to do it.

986
00:51:46,440 --> 00:51:47,440
It's gotta vacuum again.

987
00:51:47,440 --> 00:51:51,120
Yeah, we don't have robots for all that stuff yet.

988
00:51:51,120 --> 00:51:52,120
Well, some of us do.

989
00:51:52,120 --> 00:51:56,080
Well, I'm with you.

990
00:51:56,080 --> 00:52:02,800
Do you find for yourself a real challenge in seeing some of the ideas that you've implemented,

991
00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:07,040
you know, some of the technologies you've implemented, even in the studio here?

992
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:11,280
Do you find it a challenge to see them constantly evolving, like the entropy that tends to work

993
00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:12,640
its way into projects?

994
00:52:12,640 --> 00:52:16,600
Is that tricky to see something you've built needing to be changed all the time?

995
00:52:16,600 --> 00:52:18,080
Or do you get excited by that?

996
00:52:18,080 --> 00:52:26,640
I think I struggle with it less in a technical sense or a work sense and more in a personal

997
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:27,640
sense.

998
00:52:27,640 --> 00:52:28,640
Like an emotional sense?

999
00:52:28,640 --> 00:52:31,160
Well, just in personal matters, I guess.

1000
00:52:31,160 --> 00:52:35,440
Like I find myself building more routines, having more of those sort of structures in

1001
00:52:35,440 --> 00:52:43,360
my regular life and being more exploratory and looking to change in a lot of like technical

1002
00:52:43,360 --> 00:52:44,360
work things.

1003
00:52:44,360 --> 00:52:45,960
So I kind of enjoy that.

1004
00:52:45,960 --> 00:52:51,000
I mean, again, there's a lot of value in reliability and sameness and all that, and I'm a big proponent

1005
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:52,000
of such things.

1006
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:53,000
Right.

1007
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:55,680
But I do enjoy change and evolution.

1008
00:52:55,680 --> 00:52:59,320
And I like those things in my personal life as well, but it's a little more of I have

1009
00:52:59,320 --> 00:53:06,800
to remind myself of that or I guess it's more of my brain wants to seek routines and then

1010
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:11,640
I have to remind myself that like, yes, you found this, but that's going to change soon.

1011
00:53:11,640 --> 00:53:12,640
Like it's good.

1012
00:53:12,640 --> 00:53:13,640
Keep doing it.

1013
00:53:13,640 --> 00:53:14,640
That's good.

1014
00:53:14,640 --> 00:53:15,640
It's working.

1015
00:53:15,640 --> 00:53:19,120
Like I said, pinging you being like, well, you're probably going to have to move or it's

1016
00:53:19,120 --> 00:53:22,280
going to be winter and you can't do that anymore or whatever.

1017
00:53:22,280 --> 00:53:27,600
Do you find it's easier for you in the technical world in that you have a collection of tools

1018
00:53:27,600 --> 00:53:31,680
that you can use to help you move through those changes and then your personal world?

1019
00:53:31,680 --> 00:53:32,680
Yes.

1020
00:53:32,680 --> 00:53:33,680
And more control.

1021
00:53:33,680 --> 00:53:35,440
Oh, in what sense?

1022
00:53:35,440 --> 00:53:39,560
Usually in the technical domains, I at least have some, I'm usually somewhat involved in

1023
00:53:39,560 --> 00:53:42,520
the implementation or this is decision making process.

1024
00:53:42,520 --> 00:53:47,680
So I can decide how much I care, but I really have to care a lot about my own personal life.

1025
00:53:47,680 --> 00:53:51,560
And I could go live a life where I had more control, but like living in a city and currently

1026
00:53:51,560 --> 00:53:58,900
renting and doing things that involve other people, a lot that can change without my input

1027
00:53:58,900 --> 00:53:59,900
at all.

1028
00:53:59,900 --> 00:54:01,120
I guess there are more external factors.

1029
00:54:01,120 --> 00:54:02,320
There are more external factors.

1030
00:54:02,320 --> 00:54:03,320
Yeah, exactly.

1031
00:54:03,320 --> 00:54:08,080
Do you find to bring us back that agreeableness has an effect there?

1032
00:54:08,080 --> 00:54:13,520
Like in terms of lifestyle, do you tend to shape your lifestyle for how it works for

1033
00:54:13,520 --> 00:54:14,520
others?

1034
00:54:14,520 --> 00:54:17,480
Definitely more so than other people, than some others do.

1035
00:54:17,480 --> 00:54:21,720
Yes, that's probably true.

1036
00:54:21,720 --> 00:54:25,120
I don't think in a bad way necessarily, at least not all the time.

1037
00:54:25,120 --> 00:54:26,120
You never said it was bad?

1038
00:54:26,120 --> 00:54:27,120
No, yeah, right.

1039
00:54:27,120 --> 00:54:29,520
That's true.

1040
00:54:29,520 --> 00:54:33,720
That just is what people think of in that role.

1041
00:54:33,720 --> 00:54:34,720
It's the general perception.

1042
00:54:34,720 --> 00:54:35,720
Right.

1043
00:54:35,720 --> 00:54:36,720
Yeah, exactly.

1044
00:54:36,720 --> 00:54:44,320
I mean, I'm not like moving to Tahiti right now or whatever, like I need to do this.

1045
00:54:44,320 --> 00:54:49,960
And I do have some of those things, but I would say it is more of a balance.

1046
00:54:49,960 --> 00:54:57,840
I would place more weight relative to other people, some other people on whatever, my

1047
00:54:57,840 --> 00:55:04,360
friendships or established relationships or how that would affect the people in my life.

1048
00:55:04,360 --> 00:55:09,800
That sounds so familiar for me because I'm, as you know, traveling quite a bit.

1049
00:55:09,800 --> 00:55:16,060
And so my friend circles have sort of evolved from being in a certain city to being a little

1050
00:55:16,060 --> 00:55:19,920
bit scattered, you can argue, all over North America.

1051
00:55:19,920 --> 00:55:24,960
Oh, you can argue even further than that.

1052
00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:32,560
And so what I'm exploring these days is the difference between what I generally really

1053
00:55:32,560 --> 00:55:38,580
struggle with is trying to decide what is best for me and myself emotionally.

1054
00:55:38,580 --> 00:55:39,580
Just you alone.

1055
00:55:39,580 --> 00:55:46,400
Yeah, versus what should be the answer or what others perceive is the best path.

1056
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:47,400
A logical course.

1057
00:55:47,400 --> 00:55:54,480
Yeah, and so that's true of friend networks and family networks as well, is that while

1058
00:55:54,480 --> 00:55:58,120
I know I'm traveling lots and I can see all these people as I travel because that's how

1059
00:55:58,120 --> 00:56:03,920
this all got built up, there's still some weird sense of needing to choose home.

1060
00:56:03,920 --> 00:56:09,000
That currently I know is maybe not optimal in the way I've set it up.

1061
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:13,440
But in choosing a new home, that's one of the life decisions I find to be one of the

1062
00:56:13,440 --> 00:56:14,440
most challenging.

1063
00:56:14,440 --> 00:56:16,120
Right, especially when you have so many options, right?

1064
00:56:16,120 --> 00:56:19,520
It's not like, it's not like you got it.

1065
00:56:19,520 --> 00:56:24,040
And I guess that that's another aspect to you know, if, if you're going to go pursue

1066
00:56:24,040 --> 00:56:29,160
some new degree or whatever, like you would have a limited set, but you could keep doing

1067
00:56:29,160 --> 00:56:30,160
whatever you're doing, right?

1068
00:56:30,160 --> 00:56:37,080
I suppose that's a challenge with having such a free lifestyle as well, is that, okay, well,

1069
00:56:37,080 --> 00:56:42,840
while I absolutely love my lifestyle, it has freedom, in the sense that I can choose to

1070
00:56:42,840 --> 00:56:44,880
do whatever I'd like.

1071
00:56:44,880 --> 00:56:51,240
And that is, while that sounds lovely, and is mostly, it also has the challenge of not

1072
00:56:51,240 --> 00:56:53,880
having any particular direction or any default.

1073
00:56:53,880 --> 00:56:57,560
You got to choose, you got to make each of those decisions all the time.

1074
00:56:57,560 --> 00:56:59,520
So that's something I generally struggle with.

1075
00:56:59,520 --> 00:57:05,800
And I know you're, I think you're looking for a new space to live in, and that can bring

1076
00:57:05,800 --> 00:57:07,520
a lot of those same themes, right?

1077
00:57:07,520 --> 00:57:10,360
Is that how in the world do you choose?

1078
00:57:10,360 --> 00:57:13,440
It's funny this this time to like, I got the news a little bit suddenly that I was gonna

1079
00:57:13,440 --> 00:57:15,640
have to relocate.

1080
00:57:15,640 --> 00:57:16,640
And I've moved a ton.

1081
00:57:16,640 --> 00:57:19,080
I'm like, it's not it's not really that big of a deal.

1082
00:57:19,080 --> 00:57:25,360
And I honestly, I enjoy the process of moving, not part where you have to lift heavy things

1083
00:57:25,360 --> 00:57:26,360
a whole bunch.

1084
00:57:26,360 --> 00:57:27,400
I mean, that part's fine, too.

1085
00:57:27,400 --> 00:57:30,000
It's mostly the rush of having to move all these things really fast, right?

1086
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:31,540
It's just a stressful thing.

1087
00:57:31,540 --> 00:57:38,560
But I really enjoy the like, considering new aspects, I think I am building more of a,

1088
00:57:38,560 --> 00:57:43,160
at least in a particular domain, of a sense of like, what I like and spaces and ideas

1089
00:57:43,160 --> 00:57:44,160
and that sort of thing.

1090
00:57:44,160 --> 00:57:45,160
So that's all very fun.

1091
00:57:45,160 --> 00:57:50,760
Some of it like the suddenness, and I think playing on that aspect of control, like this

1092
00:57:50,760 --> 00:57:54,240
one, I think it was also just like it happened at an inopportune time where I was busy and

1093
00:57:54,240 --> 00:57:55,960
stressed out about other things.

1094
00:57:55,960 --> 00:58:00,320
But I found that it really like, ungrounded me in a way that I was surprised by.

1095
00:58:00,320 --> 00:58:01,920
So you're trying to collect yourself?

1096
00:58:01,920 --> 00:58:02,920
Yeah.

1097
00:58:02,920 --> 00:58:04,720
So I'm trying to collect myself.

1098
00:58:04,720 --> 00:58:10,120
And it was, I mean, I was kind of at a, you know, I moved into the city proper because

1099
00:58:10,120 --> 00:58:13,200
that's where all the work was, right?

1100
00:58:13,200 --> 00:58:15,060
And that's no longer what I'm doing.

1101
00:58:15,060 --> 00:58:17,480
So you have different inputs now or different filters.

1102
00:58:17,480 --> 00:58:18,480
Right.

1103
00:58:18,480 --> 00:58:21,560
And so while I had been sort of refining this, like, well, I know what it like, looks like

1104
00:58:21,560 --> 00:58:23,960
to live in the city, I know kind of what my options are.

1105
00:58:23,960 --> 00:58:27,900
And I still have to make some tough calls about like, what do I want to do next?

1106
00:58:27,900 --> 00:58:31,280
Now I suddenly found myself being like, not only do I not have the nice luxury of time

1107
00:58:31,280 --> 00:58:38,600
to go like, fart around and think about these ideas, which you require, yeah, right, exactly.

1108
00:58:38,600 --> 00:58:44,500
But I also suddenly have a giant swath of other options that I hadn't previously considered.

1109
00:58:44,500 --> 00:58:47,240
So that's still exciting to, but it definitely took me a little bit out.

1110
00:58:47,240 --> 00:58:51,280
And it was like a day or two where I was like, why, what am I, why am I feeling like this?

1111
00:58:51,280 --> 00:58:55,900
Like, what is like, the facts don't add up to how this is making me feel.

1112
00:58:55,900 --> 00:58:59,380
So you had to pause and be like, oh, yeah, right.

1113
00:58:59,380 --> 00:59:00,380
This is what's happening.

1114
00:59:00,380 --> 00:59:03,520
And I think it didn't help to that I kind of really like my current place.

1115
00:59:03,520 --> 00:59:04,520
Your place is great.

1116
00:59:04,520 --> 00:59:05,520
Yeah, for sure.

1117
00:59:05,520 --> 00:59:12,880
I see kind of a link in moving house to traveling in the sense that it sort of puts a break

1118
00:59:12,880 --> 00:59:13,880
in your everyday routines.

1119
00:59:13,880 --> 00:59:14,880
Oh, yeah.

1120
00:59:14,880 --> 00:59:19,200
And forces you to sort of look around, right, and reevaluate and have an opportunity to

1121
00:59:19,200 --> 00:59:20,200
change things.

1122
00:59:20,200 --> 00:59:28,280
And that's what I love that aspect and that it's so interesting, comparing how you live,

1123
00:59:28,280 --> 00:59:30,840
you know, because we're all I mean, we're all living, we all have have lives and do

1124
00:59:30,840 --> 00:59:34,280
things and make constant decisions every day and not in like a judgment way.

1125
00:59:34,280 --> 00:59:36,760
But just in a I think I heard it.

1126
00:59:36,760 --> 00:59:41,680
I think I heard this quote on like, remember the show, what was it like a seventh heaven

1127
00:59:41,680 --> 00:59:44,960
or something like a religious?

1128
00:59:44,960 --> 00:59:48,360
And I think the dad said something like, you know, you're like, life is basically just

1129
00:59:48,360 --> 00:59:52,080
like a sum of all of the choices that you make.

1130
00:59:52,080 --> 00:59:55,600
And I like that idea, even though I think the show was obviously terrible, and I was

1131
00:59:55,600 --> 00:59:59,480
just flipping through channels or whatever and heard this, but it just stuck in my mind.

1132
00:59:59,480 --> 01:00:04,000
And so it's just interesting to, you know, as you compare each little choice of like,

1133
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:05,400
well, when do you push yourself?

1134
01:00:05,400 --> 01:00:06,400
When do you not?

1135
01:00:06,400 --> 01:00:07,400
When do you move?

1136
01:00:07,400 --> 01:00:08,400
When do you not?

1137
01:00:08,400 --> 01:00:10,680
How do you place yourself in the world?

1138
01:00:10,680 --> 01:00:11,920
What's the sum you want to get to?

1139
01:00:11,920 --> 01:00:13,800
It's a good question.

1140
01:00:13,800 --> 01:00:15,520
I have some ideas.

1141
01:00:15,520 --> 01:00:17,600
It's very much a work in progress.

1142
01:00:17,600 --> 01:00:19,620
As we all are.

1143
01:00:19,620 --> 01:00:24,920
One thing I struggle with is the difference in paths is that if you all of a sudden choose

1144
01:00:24,920 --> 01:00:31,120
one fork in the road, I struggle with trying to accept that the other fork is now no longer

1145
01:00:31,120 --> 01:00:32,120
possible.

1146
01:00:32,120 --> 01:00:33,120
You just cut that off.

1147
01:00:33,120 --> 01:00:34,120
Which is not always true.

1148
01:00:34,120 --> 01:00:40,360
You can always sort of reach for alternatives later down the road, but they're necessarily

1149
01:00:40,360 --> 01:00:41,360
going to be different.

1150
01:00:41,360 --> 01:00:42,360
They're going to be different.

1151
01:00:42,360 --> 01:00:43,360
Right.

1152
01:00:43,360 --> 01:00:46,880
Do you have any techniques you use to deal with that?

1153
01:00:46,880 --> 01:00:48,920
Hold myself closely and cry.

1154
01:00:48,920 --> 01:00:49,920
Right.

1155
01:00:49,920 --> 01:00:51,840
Cat cuddles, maybe?

1156
01:00:51,840 --> 01:00:53,120
Cats help, certainly.

1157
01:00:53,120 --> 01:00:57,540
No, it's something I've struggled with that I don't know that I've found the answer to

1158
01:00:57,540 --> 01:00:58,540
for myself.

1159
01:00:58,540 --> 01:01:01,040
And there is some perfectionism in that.

1160
01:01:01,040 --> 01:01:02,040
You want to make the best choice, right?

1161
01:01:02,040 --> 01:01:03,780
You don't have all the information because you can't.

1162
01:01:03,780 --> 01:01:09,020
But sometimes both options are equally good only for varied reasons.

1163
01:01:09,020 --> 01:01:14,080
And so then my toolkit is empty of tools to help me deal with that.

1164
01:01:14,080 --> 01:01:15,080
Right.

1165
01:01:15,080 --> 01:01:19,900
And so I can be very slow at making those types of decisions.

1166
01:01:19,900 --> 01:01:22,720
Choosing home, I guess, fits into that realm a little bit.

1167
01:01:22,720 --> 01:01:28,460
It is, you know, I think it's hard to there's, there's probably an element of whatever agreeability

1168
01:01:28,460 --> 01:01:34,600
and logicalness, you know, it's like, some of those bigger ideas.

1169
01:01:34,600 --> 01:01:38,160
It's hard if you aren't falling in love with them, you know, because if it is one of those

1170
01:01:38,160 --> 01:01:41,240
things, you're just like, Oh, my gosh, yes, like, I was driving to this place.

1171
01:01:41,240 --> 01:01:42,240
I love this town.

1172
01:01:42,240 --> 01:01:43,640
I'm already working remotely.

1173
01:01:43,640 --> 01:01:44,640
I want to live there.

1174
01:01:44,640 --> 01:01:45,640
I'm gonna go do it.

1175
01:01:45,640 --> 01:01:48,680
If you can fall in love with this idea so much, then everything's easy.

1176
01:01:48,680 --> 01:01:51,840
I mean, you might still have a lot of problems, but makes it easier.

1177
01:01:51,840 --> 01:01:55,760
There's so many things in life that just aren't, you know, it's like, okay, I gotta make this

1178
01:01:55,760 --> 01:01:56,760
choice.

1179
01:01:56,760 --> 01:02:01,080
I know that it matters a whole bunch, and we'll have a bunch of outcomes I can't foresee.

1180
01:02:01,080 --> 01:02:02,080
But it's probably both are fine.

1181
01:02:02,080 --> 01:02:03,080
Right.

1182
01:02:03,080 --> 01:02:04,080
What do you do?

1183
01:02:04,080 --> 01:02:07,000
I mean, you flip a coin, I guess, at the end of the day, but the coins are really useful.

1184
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:08,000
That's for sure.

1185
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:09,000
I never really trust what they say.

1186
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:10,000
So

1187
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:11,000
I flip a smartphone, I think.

1188
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:12,000
I don't know that we have coin money.

1189
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:16,640
That sounds a bit more expensive if it all goes wrong.

1190
01:02:16,640 --> 01:02:19,320
There's someone I really love named Derek Sivers.

1191
01:02:19,320 --> 01:02:20,320
Do you know him at all?

1192
01:02:20,320 --> 01:02:21,320
I don't think so.

1193
01:02:21,320 --> 01:02:22,320
He built CD Baby.

1194
01:02:22,320 --> 01:02:24,620
Oh, okay.

1195
01:02:24,620 --> 01:02:30,020
But one thing he, I guess it's a concept that he's sort of spread around, which is he calls

1196
01:02:30,020 --> 01:02:33,440
hell yeah or no.

1197
01:02:33,440 --> 01:02:38,680
Which boils down to either you feel very jazzed about an idea and you say, hell yeah, I want

1198
01:02:38,680 --> 01:02:43,120
to do that, or you should just say no to it.

1199
01:02:43,120 --> 01:02:50,160
And while that seems really simple to implement, I've actually noticed that it's profound in

1200
01:02:50,160 --> 01:02:57,160
that for those of us who are agreeable, and tend to go along with what seems like okay

1201
01:02:57,160 --> 01:03:04,840
ideas or okay paths that others set for us or convince us to follow or what it may be,

1202
01:03:04,840 --> 01:03:11,000
it's almost like a preset filter that allows you to tap into how you feel, you know, just

1203
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:12,920
ask the question, well, how do I feel about this?

1204
01:03:12,920 --> 01:03:18,200
And often I found that pause is enough to convince you of what you actually feel instead

1205
01:03:18,200 --> 01:03:20,600
of what you're sort of empathizing with.

1206
01:03:20,600 --> 01:03:24,400
And maybe related thing that just makes me think you're talking a little bit about friend

1207
01:03:24,400 --> 01:03:28,680
circles and other, and I feel like that applies a lot to like, there's the difference between

1208
01:03:28,680 --> 01:03:34,160
like, being around people, friends and like, more meaningful friendships, and both are

1209
01:03:34,160 --> 01:03:35,160
fine.

1210
01:03:35,160 --> 01:03:37,480
I mean, you know, there's nothing, nothing wrong with that.

1211
01:03:37,480 --> 01:03:40,480
But it just thinks a lot, you know, like, sometimes you have those moments where you

1212
01:03:40,480 --> 01:03:45,000
finally ask that question, and you're like, I mean, like, why am I, it's not that it's

1213
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:46,000
bad, right?

1214
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:48,560
But you're just like, these aren't my people, or this is not my venue.

1215
01:03:48,560 --> 01:03:51,840
And I don't have to be here, right?

1216
01:03:51,840 --> 01:03:56,280
But that can sometimes be a difficult thing is saying, wait, I'm, I don't feel like I

1217
01:03:56,280 --> 01:03:57,280
should be here.

1218
01:03:57,280 --> 01:03:58,560
And therefore, I will leave.

1219
01:03:58,560 --> 01:04:02,560
And I think it'd be hard to if you don't necessarily, you might not have an immediate replacement

1220
01:04:02,560 --> 01:04:03,560
to it, right?

1221
01:04:03,560 --> 01:04:06,520
So it's like, well, come out and do this thing with us, or do nothing.

1222
01:04:06,520 --> 01:04:08,080
I mean, not, you probably won't do nothing.

1223
01:04:08,080 --> 01:04:09,600
But at the time, it feels that way.

1224
01:04:09,600 --> 01:04:11,520
So maybe we should all have our own defaults.

1225
01:04:11,520 --> 01:04:15,760
If we're doing nothing, we can just do something that we really love or find really useful.

1226
01:04:15,760 --> 01:04:18,360
I'm trying to do better at that.

1227
01:04:18,360 --> 01:04:23,480
I mean, because I've had both, your quote made me think of the opposite advice, which

1228
01:04:23,480 --> 01:04:29,520
I think is said a lot of like, just trying to say yes to more things, which is, I think,

1229
01:04:29,520 --> 01:04:30,520
applicable in different scenarios.

1230
01:04:30,520 --> 01:04:34,240
And it probably depends on what phase you're going through, because that can be really

1231
01:04:34,240 --> 01:04:40,240
good if you've just moved or exploring something new or need change in your life.

1232
01:04:40,240 --> 01:04:46,440
Like it's tied to a sense of adventure, as opposed to a sense of not being so busy or

1233
01:04:46,440 --> 01:04:50,720
optimizing the tasks you do have time for.

1234
01:04:50,720 --> 01:04:51,720
Curious.

1235
01:04:51,720 --> 01:04:54,480
I've mentioned a few books, I think.

1236
01:04:54,480 --> 01:04:57,640
Are there books you're reading recently that really get you jazzed?

1237
01:04:57,640 --> 01:05:03,760
I am rereading because I read it very quickly and wanted to read it again.

1238
01:05:03,760 --> 01:05:08,760
It's a book, getting the name of the author right now, but surely we'll have show notes

1239
01:05:08,760 --> 01:05:09,760
or some such.

1240
01:05:09,760 --> 01:05:11,240
Yeah, we can come up with such a thing.

1241
01:05:11,240 --> 01:05:13,400
I imagine we have the technology.

1242
01:05:13,400 --> 01:05:22,280
It's called Why Buddhism is True, which is a ridiculous title, but is very much a book

1243
01:05:22,280 --> 01:05:29,680
about the more, I don't want to just say like science-based, but more secular side, I guess,

1244
01:05:29,680 --> 01:05:31,160
of Buddhism.

1245
01:05:31,160 --> 01:05:35,120
And I think hits a lot on some of the topics we've talked about and just that.

1246
01:05:35,120 --> 01:05:40,240
It ties it a lot to, because the author has a lot of theology knowledge and psychology

1247
01:05:40,240 --> 01:05:45,400
and twists those ideas together and points out, here's some of the things that Buddhism

1248
01:05:45,400 --> 01:05:53,320
teaches and here's why these make sense once you understand how your brain works and why.

1249
01:05:53,320 --> 01:05:57,880
All of what we are is the image painted from our brains as it's exposed.

1250
01:05:57,880 --> 01:06:01,600
The brain creates our understanding and view of the world, of course, and you should know

1251
01:06:01,600 --> 01:06:06,880
that it doesn't, you know, wise is maybe too strong of a word, but it has other incentives

1252
01:06:06,880 --> 01:06:12,880
and programming built into it than just what we are or as part of us, however you want

1253
01:06:12,880 --> 01:06:17,600
to conceptualize mind, and you should be aware, you should be thinking about that.

1254
01:06:17,600 --> 01:06:21,760
But I really liked it, too, because there has been a lot of Buddhism and Buddhist teachings

1255
01:06:21,760 --> 01:06:26,240
that I've enjoyed, but I struggle with some of the more mystical elements of it.

1256
01:06:26,240 --> 01:06:31,640
It just doesn't strike my, not that I don't appreciate some of the history or culture,

1257
01:06:31,640 --> 01:06:35,600
but as practical advice that's just not my jam, I want like science.

1258
01:06:35,600 --> 01:06:39,800
So I found this book really nice as a way to A, learn more about Buddhism and B, I just

1259
01:06:39,800 --> 01:06:42,000
thought it had a lot of good practical advice.

1260
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:47,480
Yeah, it sounds like it leans a little bit more towards what you can implement and yet

1261
01:06:47,480 --> 01:06:53,200
not necessarily have the depth of spirituality that sometimes is required for some.

1262
01:06:53,200 --> 01:06:54,200
Yes.

1263
01:06:54,200 --> 01:06:57,160
And yeah, so there's like, that was actually what first got me meditating, too, because

1264
01:06:57,160 --> 01:07:01,760
it's kind of like the author describes an experience of like going to like a whole meditation

1265
01:07:01,760 --> 01:07:05,440
camp and then like coming out at the end and talking a little bit about their experience

1266
01:07:05,440 --> 01:07:07,960
of figuring out how to actually get that in their day-to-day life and the things that

1267
01:07:07,960 --> 01:07:11,500
did matter and didn't matter to them about that or what they actually took away and sort

1268
01:07:11,500 --> 01:07:12,500
of interesting case.

1269
01:07:12,500 --> 01:07:15,800
It was like, yeah, okay, I see, I see what you're getting at here, but I don't need a

1270
01:07:15,800 --> 01:07:19,880
shaman to, you know, sit with me in a very hot room for hours.

1271
01:07:19,880 --> 01:07:21,680
I mean, you're assuming the room is hot.

1272
01:07:21,680 --> 01:07:25,480
Maybe if we take the right drugs, but otherwise, no.

1273
01:07:25,480 --> 01:07:32,580
I have found in the same way this exploration of those kind of the desire to understand

1274
01:07:32,580 --> 01:07:39,600
your own mind, to then optimize it for the tasks that you generally have to solve, be

1275
01:07:39,600 --> 01:07:47,360
it technical tasks, but also tasks such as choosing what to work on and choosing how

1276
01:07:47,360 --> 01:07:55,280
to work on it, gaining knowledge of how your own mind works, while this general schooling

1277
01:07:55,280 --> 01:07:58,520
we're exposed to doesn't really dive into those topics.

1278
01:07:58,520 --> 01:08:02,480
And so I found that same curiosity of like, well, wait a second, like I know my mind is

1279
01:08:02,480 --> 01:08:07,840
all over the place and that it can also be hyper-focused and how do I understand the

1280
01:08:07,840 --> 01:08:12,880
difference between those two and guide it in the ways that I need to when I need to.

1281
01:08:12,880 --> 01:08:13,880
Yes.

1282
01:08:13,880 --> 01:08:18,920
And I think a lot of like what tools we are provided by whatever traditional society,

1283
01:08:18,920 --> 01:08:21,120
they're all wrapped up in like judgments and shame too, right?

1284
01:08:21,120 --> 01:08:23,920
Like there are all these like prescriptive things like you shouldn't do this or, you

1285
01:08:23,920 --> 01:08:27,040
know, that's a bad idea just because.

1286
01:08:27,040 --> 01:08:29,000
And like there is, yeah, that probably is a bad idea.

1287
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:33,560
We know like history shows us that that doesn't work, but it's a bad idea just because, you

1288
01:08:33,560 --> 01:08:37,340
know, you should know because your brain works or at least be informed so that you can be,

1289
01:08:37,340 --> 01:08:41,400
you know, make different decisions or be more insightful as you go down whatever path you're

1290
01:08:41,400 --> 01:08:42,400
going to go down.

1291
01:08:42,400 --> 01:08:43,400
Right.

1292
01:08:43,400 --> 01:08:48,000
When someone tells you if that you should or shouldn't do something, do you find yourself

1293
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:52,040
needing to understand the why before?

1294
01:08:52,040 --> 01:08:53,040
Depends on the situation.

1295
01:08:53,040 --> 01:08:57,000
But yeah, generally, yes, I'm a, I'm a why kind of person.

1296
01:08:57,000 --> 01:09:02,480
So like definitely like the best, you know, managers or bosses or whatever have been able

1297
01:09:02,480 --> 01:09:03,480
to do that.

1298
01:09:03,480 --> 01:09:10,080
It's like, you know, really, it's like I like to separate those because if I've agreed,

1299
01:09:10,080 --> 01:09:11,080
there's multiple concerns here.

1300
01:09:11,080 --> 01:09:14,680
So there's like the imposed authority sort of situation, which let's put that out the

1301
01:09:14,680 --> 01:09:16,240
window for you.

1302
01:09:16,240 --> 01:09:20,360
In the situation where I've agreed that I'll do what you say for money or whatever, I'm

1303
01:09:20,360 --> 01:09:25,120
okay with that pre-arranged agreement as long as A, I can tell you if I think what you're

1304
01:09:25,120 --> 01:09:27,360
doing, telling me to do is dumb, I'll still do it.

1305
01:09:27,360 --> 01:09:32,400
If you make me make, you know, ask or whatever.

1306
01:09:32,400 --> 01:09:36,640
But the other side of that is I want to know why regardless just because I want help, like

1307
01:09:36,640 --> 01:09:37,640
I want to do it the best I can.

1308
01:09:37,640 --> 01:09:40,520
And if I don't know why, I can't do that.

1309
01:09:40,520 --> 01:09:45,700
I find that to be a real challenge for me too, is that if I don't know why, then I can't

1310
01:09:45,700 --> 01:09:51,680
optimize the task at hand to create the best outcome, because none of this stuff is really

1311
01:09:51,680 --> 01:09:52,680
linear, right?

1312
01:09:52,680 --> 01:09:56,880
And it's all within in situ, you know, there's context around that if I don't know, like

1313
01:09:56,880 --> 01:09:58,800
you just can't, can't anticipate.

1314
01:09:58,800 --> 01:10:00,460
And sometimes maybe you can't know.

1315
01:10:00,460 --> 01:10:04,720
And that's okay as a temporary sort of answer, but at least get that far.

1316
01:10:04,720 --> 01:10:08,240
Yeah, context is a great word for that.

1317
01:10:08,240 --> 01:10:13,860
That's a way simpler way to explore it for me is that I need some context to understand

1318
01:10:13,860 --> 01:10:14,860
the path.

1319
01:10:14,860 --> 01:10:19,140
I was listening to a really interesting interview on the way up to the studio today, talking

1320
01:10:19,140 --> 01:10:25,180
about some issues in language education and young children, and how a lot of the approaches

1321
01:10:25,180 --> 01:10:30,400
today kind of focus on, like separating things so that, you know, you learn how to learn,

1322
01:10:30,400 --> 01:10:31,400
which is good.

1323
01:10:31,400 --> 01:10:32,400
It's not that that's bad.

1324
01:10:32,400 --> 01:10:36,360
But like, you remember those standardized tests where you have like a bad nonsense passage,

1325
01:10:36,360 --> 01:10:39,360
and then you have to identify like, what are the points and what are the three or what's

1326
01:10:39,360 --> 01:10:40,360
the main topic?

1327
01:10:40,360 --> 01:10:42,960
What are the three supporting arguments in here?

1328
01:10:42,960 --> 01:10:43,960
Yes.

1329
01:10:43,960 --> 01:10:47,960
And while that is useful, all the studies then went and showed that like, while that

1330
01:10:47,960 --> 01:10:52,000
it can be good, like if you have kids who are either good, you know, scored on some

1331
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:55,800
like reading comprehension scale, and then you present them passages about different

1332
01:10:55,800 --> 01:11:00,840
subjects, what really matters is how much they know about that subject, you know.

1333
01:11:00,840 --> 01:11:04,240
So like, if you don't know anything about the subject, even if you're great at trying

1334
01:11:04,240 --> 01:11:08,720
to understand it, you might get farther, but you're still going to do worse than someone

1335
01:11:08,720 --> 01:11:12,600
with quote unquote, poor reading comprehension who knows even a little bit about that subject.

1336
01:11:12,600 --> 01:11:18,760
I just thought it was interesting, especially hearing discussions about this with adults,

1337
01:11:18,760 --> 01:11:24,260
how much context in the world we take for granted and just don't talk about and kids

1338
01:11:24,260 --> 01:11:25,260
don't have that.

1339
01:11:25,260 --> 01:11:26,260
Wow.

1340
01:11:26,260 --> 01:11:27,600
And many times we don't either, right?

1341
01:11:27,600 --> 01:11:32,960
If you're traveling or in a new situation, but it's almost impossible to see if you already

1342
01:11:32,960 --> 01:11:33,960
have it.

1343
01:11:33,960 --> 01:11:35,020
I love this.

1344
01:11:35,020 --> 01:11:39,920
In travel, because you mentioned travel, you can easily clearly see this if you travel

1345
01:11:39,920 --> 01:11:44,720
to a place for the first time, it's total chaos in your mind trying to figure out all

1346
01:11:44,720 --> 01:11:46,240
the pieces and how they all fit together.

1347
01:11:46,240 --> 01:11:47,240
There are no systems.

1348
01:11:47,240 --> 01:11:48,240
No.

1349
01:11:48,240 --> 01:11:52,040
And then, but if you've ever come back to that, let's say you travel to the same city

1350
01:11:52,040 --> 01:11:56,600
for the same reason three months later, and you've already been through the path, you've

1351
01:11:56,600 --> 01:11:58,220
got all this context to figure it out.

1352
01:11:58,220 --> 01:12:01,240
And so if you're throwing some curveballs, it's like, well, I've already figured out

1353
01:12:01,240 --> 01:12:02,240
80% of this.

1354
01:12:02,240 --> 01:12:04,320
So I can deal with this curveball far easier.

1355
01:12:04,320 --> 01:12:08,920
Wow, I can see how that could apply to much more than just the education.

1356
01:12:08,920 --> 01:12:09,920
Yeah.

1357
01:12:09,920 --> 01:12:10,920
Right.

1358
01:12:10,920 --> 01:12:11,920
Aspect.

1359
01:12:11,920 --> 01:12:12,920
Fascinating.

1360
01:12:12,920 --> 01:12:13,920
Do you remember what the podcast was called?

1361
01:12:13,920 --> 01:12:18,840
Well, it was on the local public radio station here in Seattle, so I can certainly find it.

1362
01:12:18,840 --> 01:12:21,840
I don't remember the name of the author's last researcher.

1363
01:12:21,840 --> 01:12:22,840
That's all right.

1364
01:12:22,840 --> 01:12:23,840
We'll see if we can link it.

1365
01:12:23,840 --> 01:12:24,840
I think we can.

1366
01:12:24,840 --> 01:12:26,400
We have the technology.

1367
01:12:26,400 --> 01:12:29,920
Well, Wes, thanks for chatting.

1368
01:12:29,920 --> 01:12:34,640
I admit I wasn't sure where this was going to go, but it's gone in all sorts of fascinating

1369
01:12:34,640 --> 01:12:35,640
topics.

1370
01:12:35,640 --> 01:12:36,640
Everywhere.

1371
01:12:36,640 --> 01:12:37,640
Let's do this again.

1372
01:12:37,640 --> 01:12:38,640
Super fun.

1373
01:12:38,640 --> 01:12:39,640
Thanks so much.

1374
01:12:39,640 --> 01:12:40,640
Next time, right?

1375
01:12:40,640 --> 01:12:41,640
We'll see about that.

1376
01:12:41,640 --> 01:12:42,640
Thanks, Wes.

1377
01:12:42,640 --> 01:12:46,640
Well, I hope you enjoyed that chat.
