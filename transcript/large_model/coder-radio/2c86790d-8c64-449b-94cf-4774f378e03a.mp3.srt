00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
This is Kota Radio, episode 379, for September 14th, 2020.

2
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Hello, friends, and welcome to Kota Radio,

3
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Jupiter Broadcasting's weekly talk show

4
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
taking a pragmatic look at the art

5
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
and business of software development

6
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
and the world of technology.

7
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
This episode is brought to you by a Cloud Guru.

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Tech moves fast, and so does ACG.

9
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Their courses and labs are always online

10
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
and obsessively updated.

11
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Plus, they curate all the news on AWS,

12
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Kubernetes, Linux, and more.

13
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000

14
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
My name is Chris, and joining me triumphantly

15
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
is my co-host, Mr. Dominic.

16
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Hello, Mike.

17
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Hello, Chris.

18
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
I have ascended from my aquatic grave.

19
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I come to you with Windows Azure.

20
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I'm sorry, Microsoft Azure.

21
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'm sorry, Just Azure.

22
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Dammit, stop changing the name.

23
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Did you get the barnacles washed off?

24
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I did, and I actually, while I was down there,

25
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
I found my old purple HTC Windows Phone 8.

26
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Hey, you know, those were great back in the day, man.

27
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
You know, that's going to take over the world.

28
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
You just wait.

29
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
How are you?

30
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
How is Florida?

31
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
How is the life?

32
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
How is the Dominic household?

33
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
All of those things.

34
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Well, Florida is 4,000 degrees,

35
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
but not nearly as hot, horribly,

36
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
as the Pacific Northwest, of course, in California.

37
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
That's a shame.

38
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
I'm tired.

39
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
You know, I tried to code into the night last night

40
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
something I have not been able to do for several years now

41
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
without horrible repercussions in the morning.

42
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Yeah.

43
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Yeah.

44
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I have also fought that one.

45
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Also because sometimes now, just more often than not,

46
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I can't sleep.

47
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Yep.

48
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
That does stink because it does put my whole day

49
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
kind of like in a funk.

50
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Like, I'm just not as effective.

51
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Today, I actually tried to avoid that.

52
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I actually stayed at the studio last night

53
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
because the RV is way, way, way far away,

54
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
like two hours or something far away.

55
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
So I stayed here thinking,

56
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
well, I'll save myself the exhaustion of driving

57
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
for like four hours that day,

58
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
and I'll just crash here,

59
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
and I'll get a good night's sleep,

60
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
and then I'll hit the ground running,

61
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
and I'll take off in the afternoon.

62
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Of course, the reality is I didn't sleep for like a wink.

63
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Like, maybe I got an hour or two, maybe, you know?

64
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
It's just horrible.

65
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
But the day goes on,

66
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
and I just deploy my caffeine strategy,

67
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
which is caffeinate hard, caffeinate often.

68
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
And the real key to my caffeine success

69
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
is I catch it before the last dosage is wearing off,

70
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
and you have to consider digestion time.

71
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
So you got to know what your own digestion time is

72
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
so that way you can intake more caffeine

73
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
before the last take wears off.

74
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
And if you don't get it right, you know, it can be too much.

75
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
That is true, and it's also, so I started with coffee,

76
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,000
which I haven't been drinking, so that's great.

77
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
But I'm back on the coffee wagon, so sadness.

78
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Woo-woo!

79
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Oh, I don't know.

80
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
There's something nice about it, too, though.

81
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Well, you know, well, for me making coffee,

82
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
it would be easy to like turn on a coffee pot,

83
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
but no, we can't do that.

84
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
We have to boil just enough water in a tea kettle

85
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
and then get a single-serve French press

86
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
as we measure out as though we were dealing

87
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
with nuclear-physical material the exact amount of beans,

88
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
which of course had to be freshly ground.

89
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Right, right, which is loud and dirty and a mess,

90
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
and that thing's always a pain in the butt to clean up.

91
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Then in my case, the four-year-old turns and yells at me

92
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
because, of course, the grinder is louder

93
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
than Mickey Mouse Clubhouse.

94
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
He says, Daddy, what are you doing?

95
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Right.

96
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
What's the matter with you?

97
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
What's wrong with you?

98
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
That's sort of how life is in my place, too,

99
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
just about it.

100
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
It sounds better.

101
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
How are you?

102
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
How is everybody?

103
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Just, you know, kind of trying to avoid the smoke

104
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
unsuccessfully.

105
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
There's literally absolutely nowhere to go.

106
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
I'd have to probably go to Montana.

107
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I mean, I'm not sure how far away, how far east

108
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I'd have to go to get away from it at this point.

109
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,000
It's so thick, and it smells like wood smoke everywhere,

110
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
like my clothes now smell like wood smoke,

111
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
and yet it's also kind of cool in a way, right?

112
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Because it's different, and it gives me a good excuse

113
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
to stay inside and be on my computer.

114
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Yes, because you need lots of convincing for that.

115
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Right.

116
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
It doesn't take much, and you know what?

117
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
They say stay inside.

118
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
It's unhealthy air quality, so I just follow an advice,

119
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
you know?

120
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
You are doing the prudent, responsible thing.

121
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
So we had a couple bits of feedback.

122
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Jordan wrote in.

123
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
He went over to coder.show slash contact,

124
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
and he says, hi, Chris West in pain, AKA Michael.

125
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
I'm a full-time C++ developer at a small company

126
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
where I do cross-platform application development

127
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,000
and maintain a massive legacy code base.

128
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
I can feel the weight of that sentence.

129
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Oh, man.

130
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Jordan, I feel your pain there.

131
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
He says, anyways, I wanted to throw in my two cents

132
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
on your latest conversation around C++.

133
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,000
C++ is one of the hardest programming languages to learn.

134
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Don't forget about templating in C++,

135
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
which is particularly another programming language altogether.

136
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
While many people in the C++ community

137
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:17,000
are trying hard to make C++ more accessible and safer,

138
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
things like undefined behavior, defaults,

139
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
and antiquated functionality within the standard library

140
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
make it an uphill battle.

141
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
And some fixes would require breaking ABI,

142
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
something the standards committee cannot agree on doing

143
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
even 10 years down the road.

144
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Now, there are nice benefits to the standardization process

145
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
and improvements in C++ with each new standard,

146
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
not fast enough nor ambitious enough to solve

147
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
the fundamental issues, though, many developers face

148
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
on even a day-to-day basis, such as package,

149
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
dependency management, memory management,

150
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
and code correctness.

151
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Many have tried and failed to make C++ better from the inside,

152
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
which I think is why we have so many spin-offs

153
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
that are meant to be better replacements for C++.

154
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
I hope to see Rust and Go continue to replace C++ code,

155
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,000
not only for my sanity, but because it's also just more fun

156
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
to develop in Rust and Go.

157
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
They let you really focus on the problem you're trying to solve

158
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
instead of a bunch of more problems

159
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
you now need to solve as well.

160
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
That is a decisive take from Jordan.

161
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Yeah. Decisive.

162
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
And I think we are seeing that, right?

163
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
I think we're seeing particularly Rust is gaining a lot of traction,

164
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
sort of, in a way.

165
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Yeah.

166
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
I don't know. It's a little weird.

167
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
But C++ is a beast with a lot of legacy.

168
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
There's no doubt.

169
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Yeah.

170
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
The other conversation that came up in the community was,

171
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
well, what about when we're talking about operating system components,

172
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
like in the launch of Amazon Bottle Rocket?

173
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
You know, this is a sign that sometimes algorithms work,

174
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:51,000
because on YouTube, a video came up that just seemed like it was

175
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:55,000
a perfect response to the conversation starting our community about,

176
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
well, maybe we should all adopt Rust

177
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
for lower language operating system components.

178
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
And I found this audio of Linus,

179
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
who was asked a similar question at an event,

180
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,000
and this was his response about why he still prefers C.

181
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,000
So I have to say, I'm kind of old-fashioned,

182
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
and I'm really interested.

183
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
The reason I got into Linux or operating systems in the first place

184
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
was I really love hardware.

185
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
I love tinkering with hardware.

186
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Not in the sense that I'm a hardware person.

187
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Giving me a soldering iron is a bad idea.

188
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:31,000
But I like interacting with hardware from a software perspective.

189
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:36,000
And I have yet to see a language

190
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
that comes even close to C in that respect.

191
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:45,000
It's not just that you can use C to generate good code for hardware.

192
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
It's that if you think like a computer,

193
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
writing C actually makes sense.

194
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,000
And I think the reason it works that way is

195
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
the people who designed C

196
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:04,000
designed it at a time when compilers had to be simple

197
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:09,000
and the language had to be kind of geared towards what the output was.

198
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
So when I read C,

199
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:15,000
I know what the assembly language will look like.

200
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
And that is something I care about.

201
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Not that I feel like Linus is wrong.

202
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
It's just that he's not 100% right anymore either.

203
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
And it's a bit of an old school take, but still a valid one.

204
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
I always hate this argument because no matter what,

205
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,000
there's no good way to capture all the nuance in a 45 second,

206
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
one minute response, right?

207
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Taking a step back, right?

208
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
There's the question of like the low levelness

209
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
and the memory management stuff.

210
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:45,000
And there's the question of C++ is just like super old, right?

211
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,000
And it's got like a lot of like the ABI stability comment

212
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
that Jordan mentioned is actually kind of a big deal.

213
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Although it's one of those things

214
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
that if you're coming from a different environment

215
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
or frankly, if you're not insane,

216
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
and although if you listen to coding podcasts,

217
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
you're probably pretty deep into it.

218
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:03,000
So maybe you are the set who actually like understands what that means.

219
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Quick detour, right?

220
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Committing to ABI stability,

221
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
it was like a huge problem for Swift

222
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
because it meant that you basically couldn't change

223
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
a large percentage of the foundational stuff in the language,

224
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
which is why Swift did not do it for a long time.

225
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
In fact, I don't think they have done it yet,

226
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:23,000
but I am not super up to date on the Swift community.

227
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
I can't disagree with Linus psychologically,

228
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,000
so I'm going to say he makes great points.

229
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:34,000
But I've been kind of tooling around with C++ the last few weeks.

230
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
There are reasons I do not recommend it to clients, right?

231
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
There are reasons I have a pretty substantial client

232
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:43,000
who one of their projects when they have time and budget

233
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:48,000
is always like we are wanting to move our C++ stuff into.NET Core.

234
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
One, because you can do all kinds of fun stuff

235
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
where you call the C++, right?

236
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
You can either make it a binary and call into it

237
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,000
or thank God for FFI in most cases.

238
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
It's just a hard language to work with.

239
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,000
And like the challenge I've very recently had,

240
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
people who follow me on Twitter might have noticed

241
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
I've been doing like some weird game dev thing.

242
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Not my C++ and your C++ are going to be very different, very likely, right?

243
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
The style, like I do not use templating

244
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
because I think it's crazy evil magic.

245
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
This is a good point.

246
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Right.

247
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,000
And like I write C++ from the perspective of I wish it was Objective-C,

248
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,000
which is insane because they're like totally different language philosophies, right?

249
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Well, I mean, I also write, you know, like a check and fill out IRS forms with brackets.

250
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
I get them back all the time.

251
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:37,000
They're like, sir, sir, just give it up, okay?

252
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
That's beautiful.

253
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
It really is sad.

254
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
I mean, Jordan, more power to you, man.

255
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Yeah, right.

256
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Every day, large code base.

257
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,000
There's got to be some deep legacy demons in that baby.

258
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Yeah.

259
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Massive legacy code base is what he said.

260
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Somebody suggests that as a title.

261
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
That's just a monster.

262
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Eldritch code base over there, right?

263
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Steve T. said, great episode, but I had a question.

264
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:06,000
What really is a quote unquote safe language?

265
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Which, of course, is a huge rabbit hole.

266
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
But I guess a fair question.

267
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
We didn't really define it when we were talking about Rust

268
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
and what makes it valuable.

269
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:18,000
You know, probably better to link to the explanation in the show notes,

270
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
but there's several things that make a language safe.

271
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,000
You have memory safety, obviously, which is a big one

272
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:27,000
because that prevents things like buffer overflows,

273
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:31,000
no pointer differences, lots of little things that have got us in trouble

274
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:37,000
for years and years are generally caught by languages like Java, too.

275
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Not just Rust.

276
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,000
It's not just a Rust thing, but Rust is one of the newer, hotter things

277
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
that seems to be offering it.

278
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:48,000
I'll link to Michael Hicks' list of several different definitions

279
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,000
of memory safety because there are several definitions of it.

280
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,000
And that's probably a pretty good starting point for people

281
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,000
who are kind of glancing that there's something that people keep dropping

282
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
about Rust, something people like about it,

283
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
something about being a safe language.

284
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Check out the links to the show notes.

285
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Yeah, everything you said is super correct, right?

286
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
But just the Java reference.

287
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:13,000
What Rust gives you that Java does not is that it is a...

288
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,000
I hate this high-low dichotomy, but like lower level,

289
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,000
i.e. more performant programming language.

290
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:24,000
So you get the safety and you get the C++ type speed.

291
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Now, I also want to add because pet peeve time,

292
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,000
if you are writing Rust and you are throwing the unsafe keyword

293
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
every other line in your code,

294
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:38,000
you are effectively defeating the compiler's safety mechanisms.

295
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Do not do that.

296
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
If you have unsafe, I don't know,

297
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,000
I would say like more than 10% of your code,

298
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
you're probably doing something wrong.

299
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,000
And I know that's a little bit of a spicy take because that's...

300
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
No, I think it's, yeah, I think it's, well...

301
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
The unsafe keyword is controversial

302
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
in how it should or shouldn't be used.

303
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
I used to be like, I just get it done, right?

304
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Hackity hack, hack, hack.

305
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,000
I've suffered enough that I kind of don't like it.

306
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
When you have to use it, like particularly when you're interoperating

307
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
with stuff, you're probably going to have to use it.

308
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,000
But it's definitely a code smell.

309
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Having said that, Rust is amazing.

310
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,000
We should all thank Mozilla and find ways to give them money

311
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
because they need money.

312
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
No kidding.

313
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
But they did make Rust, right?

314
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
My hot take is it's the summer of Rust.

315
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
I really, I mean, it's been building,

316
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
so it's not just the summer,

317
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:30,000
but I think the iceberg became much more like pronounced above water,

318
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,000
like all of a sudden, boom, here's this big Rust iceberg.

319
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,000
And now all of the stuff below is kind of coming to surface.

320
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,000
It just seems like it's been a big, big, big summer.

321
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Right, I agree.

322
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
We're all going to be dancing to the sound of the rusty trombone.

323
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Ha ha ha ha ha.

324
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,000
A Cloud Guru dot com.

325
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,000
A Cloud Guru is known for their hands-on labs,

326
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
the real way to learn.

327
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,000
ACG is the leader in hands-on cloud learning.

328
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,000
And you guys know the only way to lock in a new skill is by doing.

329
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,000
That's why ACG provides hands-on labs,

330
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
cloud Linux servers, and much more.

331
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,000
You learn the tricks, the nuances, and the gotchas

332
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,000
before you test and before you go to work.

333
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
And why not check out all the other great content

334
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
over at a Cloud Guru while you're there?

335
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Get your hands cloudy at a Cloud Guru dot com.

336
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:23,000
One of the reasons I say it is sort of the summer of Rust

337
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:27,000
is right after we wrapped up last week's show,

338
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
we found a whole batch of stories

339
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,000
about different large tech companies proclaiming

340
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
their newfound love for Rust.

341
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:39,000
We saw that Apple has job postings open specifically

342
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
looking for Rust developers.

343
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Here's a bit of the description.

344
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Quote, the performance and security of the systems

345
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
we build are critical.

346
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
We interface directly.

347
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
This is Apple, by the way.

348
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:53,000
We interface directly to low-level Linux kernel interfaces

349
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:57,000
using asynchronous IO and threads to distribute the workload.

350
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Following a very successful first foray into Rust,

351
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:06,000
we are migrating an established code base from C to Rust

352
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:10,000
and building new functionality primarily in Rust.

353
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
So we're hiring.

354
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:16,000
And Microsoft, a similar story, making the case

355
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,000
about using Rust for low-level operating system components.

356
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:23,000
And a lot of this is all coming to a head in the summer.

357
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
I really do think it has been the summer of Rust,

358
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,000
and I have been worried about making the show too much

359
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
about Rust.

360
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,000
But then when is the right time to talk about a language

361
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
except for when it's exploding like this?

362
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
When Rust is actually solving a problem, right?

363
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Like a very serious problem of, you know,

364
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
you mentioned some of the buffer overflow stuff,

365
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
which can lead to insane security issues.

366
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Taking a step back, if Apple and Microsoft,

367
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,000
and I happen to know for a fact that Google also uses Rust some,

368
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,000
are all kind of jumping on this,

369
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,000
they're not like us in the Telegram chat room or whatever

370
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,000
where we get swept up in things and try everything out.

371
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:03,000
They're making large-scale business decisions,

372
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:07,000
which means that these big corporations are probably going to also be

373
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,000
committing code back to the Rust community, right?

374
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Developing cargo packages, which for those who don't know,

375
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:17,000
cargo is, it's the MPM of Rust, right?

376
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:21,000
So I think we should just embrace our new Rust overlords.

377
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:24,000
That's my take.

378
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,000
All right, so while we're on the topic of Apple,

379
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:31,000
the Epic and Apple battle continues with another

380
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,000
go-forward-step-back kind of situation.

381
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Apple threatened to disable the sign-in with Apple for Epic Games.

382
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Just such a weak flex, I'm sorry.

383
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Oh, man. I mean, what I think is so pathetic about it is

384
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Apple just basically got this deployed

385
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,000
and is already leveraging it to punish a developer.

386
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Like, that didn't take long.

387
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Yeah, Apple isn't shy about putting you in your place

388
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,000
when you're a developer for them, right?

389
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:03,000
This really sucks as a consumer, as a user of the iOS platform,

390
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:07,000
because I really wanted sign-in with Apple to solve this problem

391
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,000
of everything needs an account,

392
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,000
and everything has to send me spam-crap email.

393
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,000
And I got to be honest with you,

394
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:20,000
quite literally every single time I've been offered to sign-in with Apple,

395
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,000
anytime I've been needing to set up a new service,

396
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
I just have done that.

397
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,000
It's so much better from a consumer standpoint,

398
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,000
and so it's really disappointing to see this happen,

399
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,000
because now I have to take that into consideration.

400
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Now I have to take into consideration that Apple could pull the plug

401
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,000
for some reason down the road when some goalpost has been moved,

402
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,000
and now all of a sudden I'm caught in the middle of some sort of dispute.

403
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,000
It reminds me of when I had Dish TV,

404
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:50,000
and they would have a dispute with the TV providers,

405
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,000
and now my local channel wouldn't be on the television network anymore.

406
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Well, I'm still paying the same price.

407
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
I really don't like this.

408
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
I don't like this from a developer leverage standpoint,

409
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
because you shouldn't use your login infrastructure

410
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,000
as a way to punish people. That just seems evil.

411
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,000
And I don't like this from a user standpoint. This is pretty crap.

412
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Now, I should mention, Apple kind of retracted this in a weird way.

413
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:16,000
They said that they will extend them a indefinite extension

414
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
for sign-in with Apple.

415
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,000
It's not saying it's resolved,

416
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,000
but we're going to indefinitely extend this offer

417
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
for you to continue to use sign-in with Apple.

418
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
And that's where it's at now.

419
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:33,000
I mean, this one really got to me, because it's so stupid and petty.

420
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,000
How about the other one where the EU tax,

421
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,000
and they're passing that tax on to individual developers now?

422
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,000
It's like, come on, guys. What are you doing?

423
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,000
It really does seem to be that they perceive the relationship

424
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,000
such that the developer is deriving more value from the platform

425
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,000
than they are from the developer. Do you get what I mean?

426
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Like, they must think that the way that the value model works

427
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,000
is that they're kind of doing developers a favor

428
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
by shipping their apps on the iPhone.

429
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,000
You know, it reminds me of, I don't know what getting a driver's license

430
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
was like in other states,

431
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
but when I was a young Indian in New Jersey,

432
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:10,000
they constantly stressed you when you're taking the driving exams.

433
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Driving is a privilege, not a right.

434
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Even if you buy a car, it's a privilege.

435
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Which is their way of saying, I'll take this right off you, right?

436
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:23,000
This is kind of like, I guess, writing code in Xcode and for iOS

437
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
is a privilege?

438
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,000
It's a whole new way of thinking about developer relations

439
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:32,000
that I'm pretty sure other companies would not agree with.

440
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Maybe they'd like to have this model, but yeah.

441
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,000
And didn't seem to really be the bargain when the App Store launched?

442
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:42,000
It kind of seemed like the App Store was the thing that sold the iPhone

443
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
for almost a decade?

444
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
And they used to help out developers.

445
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,000
It's so weird how, I guess, power corrupts, right?

446
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:52,000
And also, they kind of need developers totally on board right now

447
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,000
because they're going through a massive platform transition?

448
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
What is happening?

449
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Are we combining two things that shouldn't be combined?

450
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Does Epic really represent developers?

451
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
It's not just Epic. Epic is the easy case.

452
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:09,000
One, Epic has not exactly tried to de-escalate the situation either.

453
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
No, no, no, no, no.

454
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:18,000
So the problem here for Apple, from their perspective, I'm sure,

455
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
is not that they're being mean.

456
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,000
It's that Epic isn't some guy in his spare bedroom in Florida

457
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
that they can just roll.

458
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,000
It's another billion-dollar company.

459
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Right. Yep.

460
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,000
It's a high-profile one with a very popular product.

461
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,000
And Tim Sweeney's got some personality quirks

462
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,000
that make him a difficult person to be in a conflict with.

463
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,000
And nobody at Apple has that problem.

464
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,000
And Tim Cook just apparently hates him.

465
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
I don't even understand.

466
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Again, if you haven't, you have to read those emails

467
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
that came out in the court filing.

468
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
It's weirdly personal.

469
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Isn't that something?

470
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Yeah, there's some personality conflicts.

471
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:01,000
But all right, so let's ask the $64,000 question

472
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:04,000
that we don't have in the doc, but I think is relevant.

473
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Would you caution our listeners, particularly younger folks

474
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
who are wanting to get into development,

475
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
to maybe avoid Apple's platforms?

476
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Well, I think certain business models should consider it.

477
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
If you're the hay business model,

478
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
you probably better think about it real hard.

479
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,000
Again, another outspoken tech founder

480
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,000
with an interesting personality who took Apple on.

481
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,000
If Ben Thompson is to be believed,

482
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:30,000
he has received many dozens of other stories from developers

483
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
that just were afraid to come public.

484
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
And I can buy that.

485
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
And so I would say to a degree,

486
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
you know, I don't think we should kid ourselves.

487
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:40,000
I don't think this is a story that is pervasive

488
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
amongst the customer base of iPhones.

489
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:46,000
I think it's well known amongst a small percentage

490
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,000
and maybe now a little more because of Fortnite.

491
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:52,000
But I'd say so a lot of businesses are totally fine,

492
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,000
especially if you're comfortable playing within Apple's rules.

493
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:59,000
But if you have something that skirts around

494
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
or kind of relies on a loophole

495
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,000
or maybe takes advantage of a gray area

496
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,000
or kind of hopes Apple lets this one slip by,

497
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
you are 100% screwed.

498
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,000
It's just not going to happen.

499
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Maybe the web is a better platform for you.

500
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
Yeah, I'm sort of hoping that, like,

501
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Apple comes to their senses a little bit.

502
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Like, and I understand it's different people

503
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
and things have changed and whatever,

504
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
but this does feel like it's like your old friend

505
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
who's, like, just gone nuts for a while.

506
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
Like, you hope that he wakes up,

507
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:28,000
but they don't seem to be waking up, right?

508
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,000
Like, in fact, they seem to be doubling down.

509
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,000
So, yeah, I don't know.

510
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,000
That's what makes it so fascinating to watch.

511
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
How does a king lose its crown?

512
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
Like, when somebody makes one a company,

513
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:44,000
like Microsoft or Google or Apple, make it to the top,

514
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
what causes them to fall?

515
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,000
Piss off the EU enough.

516
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:50,000
I mean, that's probably how this ends, right?

517
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
I don't know.

518
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
I don't know. Apple may just buy them out.

519
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,000
We bought Belgium.

520
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
No offense to people in Belgium.

521
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
I kid.

522
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
I just think it's fascinating to watch, you know,

523
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
a trillion-dollar-plus company.

524
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:06,000
They have to sabotage themselves in the name of profits,

525
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
in the name of services revenue.

526
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
I made a prediction on this show years ago.

527
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,000
I've said it before.

528
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
It's all going to be, I said, if you're a developer for Apple,

529
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
you're going to have the game change on you

530
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
as they get more and more serious about services.

531
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:20,000
And because that app store equals services

532
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,000
in their quarterly results, they've got to milk that sucker.

533
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
That's the game on Wall Street.

534
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
I keep using the metaphor of sharecroppers,

535
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
but it does feel like that.

536
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
It's not great.

537
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
So let's cheer ourselves up.

538
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
Apparently, I was right in 2013.

539
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
I want to set the stage.

540
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
This was September of 2013.

541
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,000
So not surprisingly, here we are in September again.

542
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
Let me pull up the exact date

543
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
because this is actually kind of interesting, isn't it?

544
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
We released this episode,

545
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:52,000
episode 67 of Coda Radio on September 16, 2013.

546
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,000
Here we are on September 14, 2020.

547
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
So that's pretty great.

548
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
And this is typically around the time

549
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
Apple has its traditional event.

550
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:05,000
And I think this was when they announced the iPhone 5S.

551
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:08,000
So that's how long ago this was.

552
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:12,000
And you had a hot take that you just kind of tossed out there

553
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:16,000
in 2013, and we had a listener go back

554
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
and listen to the back catalog and say,

555
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,000
hey, you got to check this clip out.

556
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
The most interesting thing that's happening now

557
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:24,000
with Apple and the iPhone isn't what they do with the colors,

558
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,000
isn't what they do with the design

559
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
or the fact that the background now has parallax.

560
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:31,000
I think what is interesting is you have one company

561
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:36,000
who is making their own chip based on the ARM design reference.

562
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:41,000
But I find that to be a huge, huge advantage.

563
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:45,000
I mean, I got to imagine now Samsung gets close, right?

564
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:50,000
But they don't own all of the bits like Apple does, top to bottom.

565
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:55,000
So my crazy conspiracy theory is that this is step one

566
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:58,000
in a five-step plan where step five is Macs

567
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
start running Apple's own ARM chips.

568
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
Oh, I hope not.

569
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,000
Damn.

570
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:06,000
You called it from the iPhone 5S.

571
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
I'll take the W.

572
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,000
Yeah, we were both spot on, I think, not to my own horn,

573
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:14,000
but I was spot on about their CPUs were going to be their secret sauce

574
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,000
and it was going to be a huge deal.

575
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
Yeah, you were too.

576
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:20,000
You were spot on about their desktop switching over to ARM processors.

577
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:24,000
Now, that's interesting because today it was announced

578
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:31,000
that Nvidia for 40 billion US dollars is acquiring ARM holdings.

579
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
And this is massive.

580
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,000
They're buying it from SoftBank

581
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:37,000
and it's clearly going to change the industry.

582
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:40,000
This will probably be one of the biggest tech stories of 2020.

583
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:46,000
And they seem to be, Nvidia, seem to be positioning this as a big AI play,

584
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
which I think is interesting.

585
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,000
Got to get those buzzwords.

586
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,000
Yeah.

587
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:53,000
Yeah, it's all about AI and their press releases.

588
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
In fact, here's a bit of a quote from one.

589
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:58,000
AI is the most powerful technology force of our time.

590
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:02,000
It is the automation of automation where software writes software.

591
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
That's according to the Nvidia CEO.

592
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:07,000
He goes on, together Nvidia and ARM are going to create

593
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:11,000
the world's premier computing company of the age of AI.

594
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
How about AI?

595
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:17,000
But I think early, I mean, I'm sure it's a component of it.

596
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
Bringing Nvidia's GPUs together with ARM CPUs

597
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
and putting them in low power situations

598
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:25,000
where they can do a lot of on premise, on location processing

599
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,000
would be extremely valuable.

600
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:30,000
I mean, you're seeing that play out in cell phones already for your selfies.

601
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:34,000
But it feels like to me what Nvidia is really doing here

602
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
is focusing on the shiny and exciting

603
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:40,000
because they don't really have a full fleshed out plan yet.

604
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
They got vague details.

605
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:46,000
So you refer to something that's vague and people will be like,

606
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,000
oh, that's great.

607
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,000
That's going to be amazing.

608
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
And they'll make up scenarios like I just did.

609
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
Meanwhile, they're like, we just had to make this play

610
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
because somebody else was going to buy them

611
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
and we wanted it to be us, right?

612
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,000
That's got to be what happened here.

613
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
And they moved as fast as they could.

614
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:02,000
They had a sticky issue regarding some Chinese owners

615
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,000
and they kind of sort of quote unquote resolve the matter.

616
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:09,000
And then as soon as they did that, the deal went through even on a Sunday.

617
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
It was almost finished on a Sunday.

618
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:14,000
I mean, it was a big rush, it seems like from the outside.

619
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:17,000
And then they talk about AI because that's pretty noncommittal.

620
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:21,000
Yeah, I mean, I would give them, I mean, I know I put the crack about being a buzzword.

621
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
I would give them a little more credit.

622
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
So Microsoft had that spheres thing.

623
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,000
Is that what it's called?

624
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
It was like their system on a chip or?

625
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,000
Yeah, the Azure sphere.

626
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,000
It's like a shipping product now.

627
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
A big weakness of that product

628
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:36,000
and a big weakness of people trying to deploy AI systems in general

629
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:40,000
is that they tend to always rely on cloud services to do the actual,

630
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
you know, machine learning and processing.

631
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,000
Right.

632
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:46,000
And this is an area that actually, like I know I mentioned Apple all the time,

633
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:50,000
but Apple has actually done a lot of great on device AI stuff,

634
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:55,000
not, or I'm sorry, ML stuff and not exactly like the best ML stuff.

635
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:58,000
But the fact that they're not constantly calling servers is impressive.

636
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:03,000
If Nvidia can pull this off, which is a big, big, big, you know,

637
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
HTML one blink tag if.

638
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,000
Yes.

639
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:10,000
They could very well do to the embedded AI market,

640
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
which is a term I just made up,

641
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:16,000
but what I mean is small systems on, you know, a single chip computing.

642
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:19,000
What they have done to basically, you know, CUDA, right?

643
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,000
Let's talk about CAD.

644
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:25,000
A thing we don't talk about much on this show because we're not like gaming oriented

645
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:28,000
is specific games, but more importantly,

646
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:32,000
CAD programs are programmed to CUDA, which is Nvidia's like proprietary,

647
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:35,000
weird, whatever graphics thing,

648
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:38,000
which means that they're kind of the leader in the graphics market,

649
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:43,000
even though we're AMD lovers here, that's because we tend to run Linux.

650
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:48,000
And it's what actually drives a huge reason why Nvidia develops a driver for Linux.

651
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,000
Yeah.

652
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:53,000
And, you know, System 76, a sponsor of this show,

653
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:59,000
and we're both customers of they build laptops and desktops specifically for the CUDA market.

654
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,000
It's a big sector.

655
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,000
It's a big sector.

656
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
I mean, it is the leader in that space, right?

657
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:07,000
To the everlasting shame of Mac people who had to switch to Windows

658
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:10,000
or hopefully picked up a System 76 computer to do their CAD work.

659
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,000
Right.

660
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,000
Because they can't.

661
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:16,000
So you can't get Nvidia on Mac because apparently they had a nasty breakup.

662
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:19,000
Again, blinking if tag if they can actually do this.

663
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:23,000
And I'm a little skeptical on this one, Chris.

664
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
This is the Holy Grail.

665
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:29,000
If they can do it, this makes AI not at all a buzzword anymore.

666
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,000
This makes it real.

667
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:37,000
I could see that if the devices could think faster and it was safer in terms of privacy

668
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:42,000
because it's interestingly enough, and I think you've probably noticed this too,

669
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:48,000
there is a very large percentage of the market that will just never buy a Amazon tube

670
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:51,000
or a Google tube because of privacy reasons.

671
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:56,000
It's become a thing people think of more, not as pervasive as I would like,

672
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:00,000
but there is a large section of the market now that does worry about privacy.

673
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,000
Sure.

674
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:04,000
And if you could say, sort of like what Apple leans into,

675
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:07,000
if you could say instead of uploading this to the cloud to process,

676
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:12,000
we're doing this on your device locally and now it's faster and more secure

677
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:15,000
and safe from hackers or whatever, they could really play it up.

678
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:18,000
Put a Guy Fawkes mask on the commercial, I could see it.

679
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
Yeah, that would appeal, I think.

680
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:24,000
It would appeal not only to people like me who have already accepted the tube in the house,

681
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,000
even though it does concern me,

682
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:30,000
but it would also appeal to people that had been previously opting out of certain,

683
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
quote unquote, smart products.

684
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,000
Yeah, that's a great point.

685
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:36,000
I wasn't thinking of the consumer space, but that's a great point.

686
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:40,000
I actually right now have a customer who works in the agriculture space

687
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:45,000
and they have giant stocks of produce, like growing produce,

688
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
and that creates a really stupid problem.

689
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:50,000
Wi-Fi signal is unable to penetrate the mass.

690
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:53,000
It can't get through the fruit?

691
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
Can't get through, right, can't get through the fruit.

692
00:30:55,000 --> 00:31:00,000
So we have to do all these insane local caching stuff

693
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:03,000
and to reintegrate with the whole system.

694
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:06,000
Something like this would be awesome, right?

695
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:09,000
And I could think of over the years at least a dozen scenarios

696
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:16,000
where my main problem was the client had either the space was too vast, it was outside,

697
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:20,000
spotty cell signal or the devices they were using didn't have cell connection,

698
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:24,000
because remember not everything is an iPad or Android app, right?

699
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:31,000
So I would be super hot on this if it worked and if it had an Objective-C SDK.

700
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
Ah, you got it in there.

701
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,000
Or I'll settle for Rust, how about that?

702
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:40,000
Okay, all right, yeah, that'll be the new go-to.

703
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:45,000
This is to me, and this is maybe why I was a little skeptical on my take of the AI stuff,

704
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:48,000
is I think really not so much about the high end of the market,

705
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:52,000
but it's really about NVIDIA now getting in the low end of the market,

706
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:55,000
because they kind of own the high end, especially with their GPUs,

707
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:59,000
and they don't really have much of any play in the low end,

708
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:04,000
like IoT devices, like I was talking about, or router devices, networking devices.

709
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:07,000
They have all of this area they can expand into.

710
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:12,000
Now what's interesting about this deal is that ARM will essentially operate as a separate entity.

711
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:19,000
They will be a subsidiary of NVIDIA with supposedly their own command structure,

712
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,000
separate from NVIDIA.

713
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:23,000
Yeah, sure, okay, yeah.

714
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:27,000
Yeah, that $40 billion was for no influence, right?

715
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:30,000
Of course, they'll be able to license to themself as much as they like,

716
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:36,000
but I would imagine they're also going to now be taking the revenue over from the existing licensees,

717
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:40,000
including folks like Apple, which you wonder what that deal is going to look like now.

718
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:45,000
I think NVIDIA is going to focus a lot on kind of pushing down into that market,

719
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:48,000
maybe even if we're lucky, bringing up the capabilities.

720
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:54,000
But without a doubt, this just clearly makes NVIDIA one of the most significant players in tech now.

721
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
Yeah, I mean, they weren't a slouch to begin with.

722
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,000
Right.

723
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:02,000
But we could see a future where when you rattle off the big tech, the big five,

724
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:05,000
when you're rattling through Amazon and Microsoft and Apple,

725
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:08,000
there may be a future now where NVIDIA is in that list.

726
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:14,000
It's not there yet, but it may get there because think about the dominance of the ARM CPU,

727
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:17,000
especially if they can combine it with some of their technology,

728
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:20,000
and the reach, if they play this right, they could achieve.

729
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,000
Yeah.

730
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:24,000
It seems like a lot of upside for them, if they don't blow it.

731
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
Tough dungies for Intel?

732
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,000
Yeah.

733
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:30,000
Man, right as they're just not getting their act together either, right?

734
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,000
I mean, woof.

735
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:34,000
And AMD is starting to make inroads into the laptop market.

736
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
That's a rough time.

737
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:41,000
You also wonder if it will have a knock-on effect to RISC-V or OpenPowerPC.

738
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:47,000
Could we see some renewed community interest or company interest in those platforms as sort of a hedge?

739
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000
You had me at PowerPC.

740
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
I tell you what, man, I miss it.

741
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
I love the PowerPC architecture.

742
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,000
That's a statement.

743
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,000
Okay.

744
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,000
Really?

745
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,000
No, I did.

746
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:00,000
One of my favorite things to do for a long time was to get old PowerPC Macs

747
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:03,000
and run Yellow Dog Linux on them and Debian.

748
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,000
Yellow Dog.

749
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,000
Yes.

750
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,000
Oh, yeah.

751
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
You could also run that on a PS3, if I recall correctly.

752
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,000
As I did.

753
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,000
Yep.

754
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
And so did the Air Force.

755
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,000
Really?

756
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,000
Yeah, a lot of them.

757
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,000
Weird.

758
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
That's weird and random.

759
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:20,000
I mean, there's other Linux boxes one could have.

760
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:24,000
At the time, though, the PS3 was like, this is not my personal experience,

761
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:27,000
but it was a widely-published story at the time.

762
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:31,000
It was the most cost-effective, powerful Linux box they could buy.

763
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:35,000
So they just called Sony and were like, we need 200 of those.

764
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,000
Right.

765
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
It had that cell processor, which is PowerPC-based.

766
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,000
Yep.

767
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
Well, one last hot take while we're in the hoopla.

768
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:46,000
This is over at Matt Kelad's, I'm not sure, blog.

769
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
And we'll link for the full read.

770
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:51,000
But it's a take I think I can get on board with.

771
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:54,000
And the headline is, your language sucks, it doesn't matter.

772
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:58,000
And the central thesis is that the actual programming language,

773
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:02,000
the syntax, the semantics, the paradigm, it doesn't really matter.

774
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:08,000
What matters is the characteristics of the runtime, roughly what it does

775
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:11,000
with memory of running processes and what does all of that look like.

776
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,000
That's the core thesis.

777
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:17,000
And I feel this way, too, about not just programming languages,

778
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:20,000
but I also feel that way about Linux distributions.

779
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:24,000
All Linux distributions suck and also all Linux distributions are great.

780
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
It's just really how you use it and what you're familiar with

781
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
and the tools you know.

782
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:31,000
And honestly, that's kind of my hot take on operating systems

783
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
to a lesser extent as well.

784
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
Yeah, I think this guy makes a great point.

785
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,000
It's back to our classic, the right tool for the job.

786
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:40,000
Now, I'm curious on your operating system thing.

787
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:43,000
When you say operating system, do you mean like Linux distros

788
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
or like Mac, Linux, Windows, whatever?

789
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:48,000
All of the above, but I did mean the actual, you know,

790
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
predominant like Linux, Windows, Mac.

791
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
But I feel that way about distros as well.

792
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
I can just switch distros and it's great.

793
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:57,000
It's just some have other advantages that work better for me.

794
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
And it's like tools, right?

795
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:02,000
It's like I just got a rigid drill set.

796
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:05,000
I looked at a lot of different drills and I almost didn't go with rigid,

797
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:08,000
but I was gifted a couple of batteries and I'm like,

798
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:11,000
I got these batteries and we can get these chargers.

799
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
And so I went with that tool.

800
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:16,000
Now, people listening to this who don't like rigid drills might think,

801
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
oh, you shouldn't have done that.

802
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:21,000
But for me, that's what fit my use case.

803
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,000
They all have pluses and minuses.

804
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
That's my wisdom for you, Mike. It's wisdom.

805
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:28,000
That is pretty wise.

806
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:31,000
Have you been like meditating in a monastery or something?

807
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,000
I think it's the drive through the mountain passes.

808
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:36,000
You know, maybe it's all the tree smoke.

809
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
Just to tie in at the end of his article,

810
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:41,000
he has some four takes or five takes rather.

811
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:44,000
His first one, he expects rust to be a major language.

812
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:49,000
A fun fact, their rust consultancy might be related, but I agree.

813
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:54,000
Can I just say I had no idea when this Lincoln in the show notes that he had a rust tie and that's hilarious.

814
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,000
Yes, it's got this.

815
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,000
So he he writes first.

816
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,000
I expect rust to become a major language.

817
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,000
Naturally, smiley emoji.

818
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,000
This needs some explanation.

819
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,000
All right. You know what? I'm not doing that.

820
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
But oh, I see. Yeah, OK.

821
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
Yeah, I see the paragraph you're talking about.

822
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:11,000
Yeah, but he says he argues the memory safety is a runtime property,

823
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:17,000
despite the fact that it is uniquely to rust achieved exclusively via language machinery.

824
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,000
Yes, it's not really a runtime property.

825
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,000
It's a it's a it's the language specification.

826
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
But I see where he's going.

827
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,000
Julia becoming popular.

828
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,000
Yeah, I doubt that.

829
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
But we'll see.

830
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
He wouldn't be surprised if dark grows.

831
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,000
You know what? Yeah.

832
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,000
A year ago, I would have said no chance.

833
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:36,000
But I'm seeing a lot of activity on Flutter.

834
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
Yep. I had Chris sells on the M.

835
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:42,000
Dominic show, and he is the product manager for Flutter.

836
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,000
They've got a lot of cool stuff.

837
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:47,000
They've got the Ubuntu support now, which I know is Linux support, but canonical partner.

838
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
So don't know.

839
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
Leave the hate mail.

840
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
Crystal, no chance.

841
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
He's right about that.

842
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,000
Swift. Yeah.

843
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:59,000
This is the one I wanted to troll about.

844
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:02,000
Remember when IBM was like, we've got this.

845
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:05,000
We're making the Swift version of a Web service.

846
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000
It's going to be an enterprise language.

847
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,000
Yeah, that worked, right?

848
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,000
Yeah. Huge.

849
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,000
No, super popular.

850
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
Huge.

851
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
Which actually is a crying shame.

852
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:19,000
Yeah. I, of course, personally hate Swift, but it's a really good language.

853
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:26,000
And its ambition is a little crazy, like it wants to go everywhere from systems programming to scripting.

854
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:29,000
But it just never got out of the Apple sandbox.

855
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,000
You know, things can change.

856
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:34,000
A language can can languish for quite a while and then all of a sudden get some notoriety.

857
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,000
But I mean, I shouldn't put it that way.

858
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,000
I shouldn't put it that way.

859
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:42,000
I mean, even even just the iOS platform and Apple Mac platform are huge.

860
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
Right. So, yeah, I mean, it's getting some play.

861
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,000
Let's be honest.

862
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,000
Yeah, it's actually a really good read.

863
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:50,000
All of those predictions are fun, but we'll have the link to the whole thing.

864
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:54,000
Yeah, the predictions are actually pretty good.

865
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:59,000
Linode.com slash coder receive a one hundred dollar 60 day credit towards your new account.

866
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:02,000
Linode is the largest independent cloud for developers.

867
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:13,000
You can simplify your cloud infrastructure with their easy virtual machines, tools to develop, deploy and scale your modern applications faster and easier than you ever thought possible.

868
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:24,000
Linode also costs 30 to 50 percent less than the major cloud providers like AWS, Google or Azure, because you receive a balance of technology with price and performance ratio that's just right.

869
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:29,000
And with 11 data centers worldwide, you're going to find just the right spot to deploy.

870
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:33,000
And you'll rest easy with Linode's built in monitoring tools.

871
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:39,000
Linode is my cloud hosting provider and all of the new infrastructure for JB 3.0.

872
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,000
Yeah, we're putting it on Linode.

873
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,000
Where else would we put it?

874
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,000
They've really gotten great.

875
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,000
I've been a customer for two years.

876
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:47,000
I have watched them get better and better and better.

877
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,000
And now nobody touches them.

878
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
The largest independent cloud provider.

879
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
They've been around since before AWS.

880
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:58,000
And when you go to Linode.com slash coder, you get a hundred dollar credit for 60 days on a new account.

881
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:01,000
Now, they have shared rigs starting at just five dollars a month.

882
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:04,000
But of course, they have dedicated CPU machines, GPU compute.

883
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:11,000
I mean, you can get seriously powerful and fast infrastructure if you need it or deploy something quick and easy for testing or learning.

884
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,000
You've got to go to Linode.com slash coder.

885
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:16,000
Oh, and one last thing.

886
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,000
Linode's hiring.

887
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:21,000
If you go to Linode.com slash careers, you'll find out more.

888
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:28,000
Why not start by supporting this show and getting yourself a one hundred dollar 60 day credit towards your new account by going to Linode.com slash coder.

889
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:31,000
And a big thank you to Linode for sponsoring the Coder Radio program.

890
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:35,000
That's Linode.com slash coder.

891
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:38,000
Now, here's the hottest of the hot takes this week.

892
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
Open source is essentially dead.

893
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:44,000
We are living in a post open source world.

894
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
There's several links we'll have.

895
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:59,000
One of the one of the links that is cited here is, quote, a tweet that says open source as a community endeavor is falling apart right before our eyes and being replaced by open source as a big Corp enrichment strategy.

896
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:02,000
It is mean, but it's been happening for a while.

897
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:06,000
But seeing Mozilla's sinking like this is just driving the point home for me.

898
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:13,000
And that's what kicked off this entire conversation, to be frank with you, is the Mozilla layoff situation.

899
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:18,000
And that's what drove this author to write this. A lot of cool people working on important shit, as this author put it.

900
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:29,000
But the consensus that he's seen is that it reflects Mozilla's search for profit over impact, mismanagement and dis appropriate executive compensation.

901
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:39,000
He says this is a trend not only at Mozilla, but it's taking place over the corporatization of open source over the past several years and an ongoing open source sustainability crisis.

902
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:47,000
And covid-19, the all consuming crisis that makes other crisis is worse, has brought this issue up even worse.

903
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:52,000
It's like I say, it's hot, it's spicy. This is where I think maybe it resonates a little bit with you.

904
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:58,000
So clear your mind. Open your mind to this, because he is no fan of the GPL three.

905
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:05,000
And I'll get you there. They write the flagship projects of the free software movement are probably Linux and the Gnu pile of tools.

906
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:15,000
The Linux kernel being released under a free software license doesn't directly create more free software, though, even since things that lie closely to the Linux kernel aren't obligated to also be free software.

907
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:20,000
And of course, user level applications can have whatever license they want.

908
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:27,000
And also, most of the people using Linux right now are using it by accident distributed as Chrome OS or Android, either of which is free software.

909
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:32,000
So Linux is a win for the free software movement, but it's a useless win.

910
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:36,000
The Gnu user land tools are, for the most part, even more underwhelming.

911
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:41,000
GCC had, as far as I can tell, been basically the C compiler for a while.

912
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:48,000
If you weren't stuck with MSVC or something else, the free software movement were stubborn ideologues with weird priorities.

913
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:54,000
They still had one big technical advantage, but then the GPL three happened.

914
00:42:54,000 --> 00:43:04,000
So big companies like Apple saw new restrictions coming in at the same time were more aggressive with enforcement and said, well, shit, who want to base our software on these handy, convenient tools like GCC?

915
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:10,000
But we can't use GPL three software while keeping our hardware and software is locked together as tight as possible.

916
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:19,000
So they started pouring money into a new C compiler LLVM that was instead open source, not free software.

917
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:25,000
And LLVM became at least as good as GCC and less risky decision for big companies and easier to build new languages.

918
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:29,000
So the free software's last technical advantage was gone.

919
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:34,000
His social advantages also kind of went up in flames with the GPL three.

920
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:43,000
The free software movement in the end burned itself out by fighting for tiny crumbs of success and then turning around and lighting that success on fire.

921
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:50,000
The death of free software tells us that we can't use a license to trick corporations into sharing values, our values.

922
00:43:50,000 --> 00:44:04,000
They want to profit. And if good software has a license that puts a limit on how much they can do that, they'll put more resources into writing their own alternative than they would spend complying with the license in the first place.

923
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:15,000
So in his mind, especially in the world of big cloud services, this is done. It's over like the ID log movement didn't work and free software is done.

924
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:20,000
Well, OK, so maybe I'm on the short bus today.

925
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:25,000
Is he claiming that open source is gone or dead or something or has failed?

926
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:29,000
Or is he claiming that like FOSS has failed because it's two different things, right?

927
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,000
Free software versus a little bit of both.

928
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:38,000
I think the I think he's trying to make the case where they think it's a he is trying to make the case that both have failed.

929
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:48,000
We couldn't get companies on a moral basis and we couldn't get them on an open source license to trick them into not making too much money because they just bypass both.

930
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:56,000
And so the only kind of license that works is something that's essentially I opt to revoke your permission to use it anytime I deem.

931
00:44:56,000 --> 00:45:03,000
He has a quote, a license that's F around and find out license faffle for short.

932
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:07,000
The license reads the software shall be used for good, not evil.

933
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:13,000
The original author of the software retains the sole and exclusive rights to determine which uses are good and evil.

934
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:17,000
Yeah, no one's going to go for that. I know to get out of here. That's it.

935
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:20,000
Get it out of here. What about what about the premise?

936
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:27,000
What about the premise that almost no license is better than a license in this new in this new world we live in?

937
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:33,000
Almost no. So so no license. The default would be proprietary.

938
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:36,000
Or are we saying like a public domain?

939
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:43,000
I think it'd be up to you, you know, for your software, the default might be proprietary with or the default could be something like this share.

940
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:49,000
And I I don't think anybody would go for a license that says I choose to revoke it for any reason at any time.

941
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:52,000
Yeah, no, of course not. It's just kind of it's yeah, you're right.

942
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:57,000
It's kind of a who would write software for for anything where someone could just come in and say,

943
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:01,000
we don't like you anymore and throw you off the platform and then remove a sign in feature from you. Oh, wait.

944
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:07,000
We'll be talking about it. So this is what. So this right here, what you just touched on is what I keep coming back to.

945
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:14,000
And what this I think with this article got me thinking about is this almost does kind of seem like an unsolvable problem in a way.

946
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:25,000
But what is the problem? Well, in theory, the problem is large company X comes in, decides to use your code to make millions and millions of dollars and never gives you a dime.

947
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:31,000
Got it. So effectively, AWS and Azure are rolling around with making lots of money on Linux.

948
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:36,000
And the Linux Foundation has to go cap in hand and get some shekels from them. That's what we're talking about.

949
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:40,000
Yeah, I mean, essentially, that's it. And then, of course, that doesn't really trickle down to projects.

950
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:49,000
So still, the developers that are actually burning the midnight oil, making the software actually possible, are really not reaping any of the benefits at all.

951
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:55,000
All right. So I'm going to make you even sadder than OK. Remember, there was a hero in this category.

952
00:46:55,000 --> 00:47:02,000
And we had this argument years ago when I was full, like stupid, you know, do everything proprietary.

953
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:07,000
Someone will find the clip. I'm sure you throw it right back at me. Well, Red Hat's making tons of money, man, and they're open source.

954
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:14,000
Oh, wait. Everybody has failed. Right. Canonical is like maybe the exception to this.

955
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:20,000
But again, they have effectively become a consulting company. Sorry to all our friends at Canonical.

956
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:25,000
Well, I mean, it's not a bad thing. But see, the way I look at it is it's all kind of open source by default now.

957
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:34,000
I mean, I think I think there is a fair observation being made here. Certainly, the spirit of free software is just like that.

958
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:39,000
But merging them together into open source and free software.

959
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:46,000
How could you be open and good and not have the big companies like want to use your stuff?

960
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,000
That's what I'm saying. That seems to be the catch 22 of it.

961
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:56,000
But maybe it's enough that a small core group of technology enthusiasts care about this and advocate for these things.

962
00:47:56,000 --> 00:48:01,000
And maybe that's but what are they advocating for? Well, at least contributing code improvements back.

963
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:10,000
Well, I think to be like slightly fair to the dark are glorious corporate overlords in the open source community.

964
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:14,000
Microsoft does commit code back to Linux kernel and a number of other projects.

965
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:18,000
Right. Canonical does a lot. And I see people.

966
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:22,000
You know, I knew someone was going to say open core. I knew it was coming.

967
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:29,000
Conan, kudos. Kudos to you, sir. Well, here's my question, though, is does it work out in the wash?

968
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:35,000
Maybe some projects suffer and other projects grow and become funded and get developer time.

969
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:41,000
And it all kind of comes out in the wash, even though some projects are left behind.

970
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:49,000
I don't know if we can say that. Let's try to think of a company who is even like maybe not like Microsoft level.

971
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:58,000
Right. But like maybe a couple of years down, that is open source and making money and is not having their lunch eaten by AWS.

972
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:03,000
And the one in the chat room that inspired that point is maybe it's Suze.

973
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:10,000
But that has more to do with the fact that nobody willingly uses Suze and they affect.

974
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:14,000
And the D.O.D. happens to like really like Suze because you have to have a vendor thing.

975
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:19,000
Oh, and Germany. Right. The Germans loves it. Right. Yeah. Well, that tells you everything.

976
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:25,000
I love you, Germans. I love you. Their model is to sell you an insane enterprise like maintenance contracts.

977
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:30,000
Yeah. I hate to be Debbie Downer. And please do, you know, coder dot show.

978
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:34,000
There's a form there. Go ahead and send feedback if you can think of one. But Chris, can you?

979
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:41,000
I can't really. I mean, to me, it seems like fundamentally this has always been the way it's worked.

980
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:49,000
Now we see it because I think it's more pronounced with the scope and scale and revenue size of these companies.

981
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:55,000
So it's really in our face because they're like in some cases the fricking back end of the Internet, essentially.

982
00:49:55,000 --> 00:50:03,000
And so it's just egregious. If you look at people who make a ton of money on open source, I mean, it's not it's not a big list.

983
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:06,000
And I think ton of money is going to have to be pretty relative.

984
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:12,000
Maybe upper middle class in the United States is probably what I mean. I don't know.

985
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:16,000
Maybe Linus is worth a billion dollars. I doubt it, though. I bet he's got some money. Right.

986
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:21,000
I'm sure he's doing real comfortable and anybody would be thrilled to be in that position.

987
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:29,000
But he's not rolling in like Tim Cook money or even probably Johnny Ive money or Phil Schiller money.

988
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:33,000
Yeah. According to the Googles, his net worth is one hundred and fifty million dollars.

989
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:39,000
So not not even close. I wonder what Johnny Ives net worth is or Phil Schiller's right.

990
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:47,000
Or or or even Satya Nadella. Not that Satya Nadella hasn't made a good contribution, but let's let's be clear, it's not the scale of Linus Torvalds contributions.

991
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:50,000
So how would you solve the problem then? I don't know if there is a solution.

992
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:55,000
I think in a part it's people dedicating themselves to just furthering software development.

993
00:50:55,000 --> 00:51:02,000
And sometimes the reward isn't monetary. Sometimes it is. And I think people may know that bargain when they go in.

994
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:06,000
Again, this is like remember a couple of years ago, the hotness was open core.

995
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:11,000
Right. Yeah. Because of this problem, if you did something purely open source.

996
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:16,000
Literally, AWS or whoever would come in and just eat your lunch if it was even promising at all.

997
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:20,000
It's essentially what's happening. And that also failed. So, you know.

998
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:24,000
Yeah. Although, you know, if it's under the ocean, maybe it doesn't matter.

This is kind of neat. Just as we're kind of sitting down to record today, Microsoft announced that their underwater data center has resurfaced after two years.

1000
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:40,000
The data center has been retrieved from the ocean floor. It was covered in barnacles and all other kinds of underwater crap, as you might expect.

1001
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:47,000
But here's some interesting details. Their first conclusion so far is that the cylinder packed with servers under the ocean.

1002
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:54,000
Yes, under the ocean had a lower failure rate than a conventional data center when the container was hauled off the seabed.

1003
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:59,000
And then it was about a half a mile out offshore. So it was underwater about a half mile out.

1004
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:07,000
It was placed there in May of 2018. Only eight out of eight hundred and fifty five servers failed.

1005
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:12,000
Quote, our failure rate in the water is one eighth of what we've seen on land.

1006
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:17,000
This is according to Ben Cutler, who is the lead Microsoft project guy on this.

1007
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:23,000
And he says our failure rate is probably lower in part because we use nitrogen rather than oxygen.

1008
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:28,000
So there's less corrosion. But also no doubt about it. It's got to be because there was less humans.

1009
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:33,000
Bumping into stuff is really neat when you see the pictures in the show notes.

1010
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:40,000
It's a tube with racks in it. It's just they straight up through a whole bunch of racks of servers,

1011
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:45,000
one new servers in these racks, and they even have KVM crash carts on them.

1012
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:51,000
And they don't know if it's going to turn into a product for Microsoft, but they say it could have potential.

1013
00:52:51,000 --> 00:53:00,000
You know, imagine a natural disaster and a region's telco infrastructure goes out or whatever it might be.

1014
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:06,000
A big, big old boat could come in and drop this thing off the shore half a mile and you run fiber out to this thing.

1015
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:11,000
And now you've got infrastructure on demand. That could be powerful.

1016
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:17,000
I am so excited about this. So this is my X-Files, the lone gunman hackety hack solution.

1017
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:24,000
Things are going bad. You toss a bunch of armed servers from NVIDIA to a capsule right down the bottom of the ocean.

1018
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:31,000
And you know what? Hopefully future aliens will find our technology and still not be able to make money on open source.

1019
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:36,000
Microsoft says they think they're past the point where it's a science experiment.

1020
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:41,000
Now the question is how much they want to engineer this. They want to make a small scale one, a large scale one.

1021
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:50,000
I'm thinking what needs to happen is a bunch of Bitcoin billionaires need to come together and purchase a few of these and sprinkle the blockchain around the bottom of the ocean.

1022
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:57,000
Never tell the Bitcoin people about this. They're like, hmm, water cooling with the whole ocean, huh?

1023
00:53:57,000 --> 00:54:03,000
Oh, you're right. Boy, you're right. OK, mum's the word on this one, everybody. Don't tell the Bitcoiners.

1024
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:07,000
All right. All right. Hot, hot prediction. Hot prediction. Here we go.

1025
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:15,000
Who buys the island just to dunk servers within the territorial boundaries underwater first, Amazon or Microsoft?

1026
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:20,000
Hmm. Whoever's going for that sweet, sweet China contract first.

1027
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:23,000
Right off the South Pacific, right?

1028
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:29,000
Yep. Also, just a special thank you to the Coder QA team. Thank you everybody who's been going to CoderQA.co to sign up.

1029
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:39,000
If you become a member, you get a limited ad feed, you support the show and you'll get that quarterly Coderly exclusive content.

1030
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:44,000
And we just appreciate the support helps keep the show sustainable at Coder QA.co.

1031
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:50,000
Also, if you know somebody who might enjoy the show, consider sharing it with them.

1032
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:57,000
Absolutely. No doubt about it. One hundred percent word of mouth is the only form of podcast marketing that actually works.

1033
00:54:57,000 --> 00:55:03,000
So if you know someone who may have enjoyed this episode, consider sharing it with them because we might just get a new listener.

1034
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:09,000
Mr. Dominic, is there anything you'd like to plug? I know that the job posting we had mentioned last week did get posted.

1035
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:14,000
Yep. Yep. We're hiring a Python developer. No, not really. I'd say just follow me on Twitter at Tumanuko.

1036
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:18,000
And I swear to God, I will ship this Rails app at some point.

1037
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:24,000
And you know what? Drop a link like in the chat or somewhere and I'll grab it and I'll put it in the show notes for the job posting.

1038
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:28,000
So people can find that if they're looking for it. Will do.

1039
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:33,000
I am at Chris LAS on the Twitter. You can also find my personal website, chrislast.com.

1040
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:39,000
Check out the new logos hitting the show art and the Jupiter Broadcasting website rolling out over the next week. That's pretty exciting.

1041
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:45,000
And that's pretty much all I have to plug. Maybe I'll just say you can find the show at CoderRadioShow on Twitter, too.

1042
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:49,000
And links to everything we talked about today, coder.show slash 379.

1043
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:54,000
Oh, I know what I'll say. Last but not least, consider joining us. We'd love to have you join us live over at jblive.tv.

1044
00:55:54,000 --> 00:56:19,000
We do the show at noon Pacific, 3 p.m. Eastern. Thanks so much for joining us. See you right back here next week.
