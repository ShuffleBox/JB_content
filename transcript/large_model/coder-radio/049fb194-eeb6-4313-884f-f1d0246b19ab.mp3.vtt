00:00.000 --> 00:15.720
This is KOTORadio, episode 480 for August 22nd, 2022.

00:15.720 --> 00:19.720
Hey good buddy, welcome into Jupiter Broadcasting's weekly talk show, taking a pragmatic look

00:19.720 --> 00:23.920
at the art and the business, the software development, and the world of technology.

00:23.920 --> 00:29.720
I, a man trapped in time, my name is Chris, and I am joined by my time lord, Mr. Dominic.

00:29.720 --> 00:30.720
Hello Mike.

00:30.720 --> 00:34.440
So now I have to ask you which doctor you think I would be, so you're going to do this?

00:34.440 --> 00:36.040
We're turning into a Facebook quiz now.

00:36.040 --> 00:40.960
No, I think you're actually the time traveler in TNG that shows up and like puts his hands

00:40.960 --> 00:45.000
on the equipment and then makes the machines like go crazy, and then the machine has super

00:45.000 --> 00:46.080
warp speeds and all that.

00:46.080 --> 00:47.080
I think you're that guy.

00:47.080 --> 00:50.640
At least you didn't say I'm hardcore Fenton Mudd, so I'll take it.

00:50.640 --> 00:55.360
No, but I would like to know what you did to Wesley, so there is that.

00:55.360 --> 00:56.360
He's fine.

00:56.360 --> 01:00.680
He's hanging out with the Klingons, he's having a great time.

01:00.680 --> 01:03.680
My homie Takuvma is taking good care of him, it's all good.

01:03.680 --> 01:06.600
Oh good, good, good, good, hanging out, hanging out.

01:06.600 --> 01:12.000
But not hanging out with you, because you're going to be at TCGCon Tampa.

01:12.000 --> 01:13.320
I am.

01:13.320 --> 01:17.540
That mana tapping monkey is back on my back, known as Magic the Gathering.

01:17.540 --> 01:21.440
It's uh, oh did I fall off the wagon hard.

01:21.440 --> 01:22.440
You know what, I like it.

01:22.440 --> 01:23.440
It's properly nerdy.

01:23.440 --> 01:25.200
I think it's good for you, you know.

01:25.200 --> 01:32.080
I've already done a commander event, and I'm going this week again to, I think it's commander

01:32.080 --> 01:33.080
again.

01:33.080 --> 01:37.840
Which as someone who hasn't really played Magic in like 10 years other than Arena, that's

01:37.840 --> 01:42.080
some crazy diabolical politicking stuff for folks who don't know.

01:42.080 --> 01:48.600
It's a weird multiplayer format, but it's both competitive and cray cray.

01:48.600 --> 01:50.440
So yeah, a lot of fun TCGCon.

01:50.440 --> 01:54.120
I will be there at least Saturday, I might go Sunday, depending on how fast I get my

01:54.120 --> 01:55.680
ass kicked.

01:55.680 --> 01:56.680
Pretty good.

01:56.680 --> 01:57.680
If you're in the area, come say hi.

01:57.680 --> 02:00.320
I will be wearing something super nerdy.

02:00.320 --> 02:05.200
Really this is the first one they're doing in Tampa, and the ticket prices reflect that.

02:05.200 --> 02:08.400
It's very affordable, surprisingly so.

02:08.400 --> 02:10.040
So yeah, I figured why not.

02:10.040 --> 02:13.400
I live literally like it's like a 30 minute drive or less, so.

02:13.400 --> 02:15.040
Oh, that's great.

02:15.040 --> 02:16.040
That's great.

02:16.040 --> 02:17.040
I'm jealous.

02:17.040 --> 02:24.080
I have been like in an event drought, and the events that I have been like that have

02:24.080 --> 02:30.480
been made possible, like that I have been invited to, I guess, the words are hard today.

02:30.480 --> 02:33.880
Just haven't really worked out, haven't been practical, so good for you.

02:33.880 --> 02:34.880
Get out there.

02:34.880 --> 02:37.800
Go say hi to Mike in Tampa, if you're in the Tampa area.

02:37.800 --> 02:38.800
I'm jelly.

02:38.800 --> 02:39.800
I'd love to go.

02:39.800 --> 02:40.800
I bet the weather is going to be great.

02:40.800 --> 02:42.360
I bet you'll get your butt kicked.

02:42.360 --> 02:43.360
That'd be great to watch.

02:43.360 --> 02:44.360
I'm sure.

02:44.360 --> 02:48.720
I was going to say for you, it's watching me get stomped, but yeah, did you ever play

02:48.720 --> 02:49.720
magic?

02:49.720 --> 02:50.720
No, I never got sucked in.

02:50.720 --> 02:51.720
I don't know.

02:51.720 --> 02:56.360
Maybe I was just maybe I got sucked into other stuff, but magic I somehow managed to avoid

02:56.360 --> 02:57.360
that in Pokemon.

02:57.360 --> 03:00.720
I managed to avoid both of those somehow.

03:00.720 --> 03:03.280
Yeah, that's probably for the best.

03:03.280 --> 03:04.680
I even got my kid into it.

03:04.680 --> 03:05.680
Yeah, I would.

03:05.680 --> 03:06.680
I would.

03:06.680 --> 03:07.680
I mean, let's be honest.

03:07.680 --> 03:08.680
I would too, right?

03:08.680 --> 03:09.680
Because that's fun.

03:09.680 --> 03:12.960
He also helps me sort the cards because, you know, child labor is the best kind of labor.

03:12.960 --> 03:13.960
That is.

03:13.960 --> 03:14.960
Yeah, they can.

03:14.960 --> 03:15.960
You know what?

03:15.960 --> 03:16.960
I know.

03:16.960 --> 03:17.960
I know about it for a fact.

03:17.960 --> 03:18.960
They can be good at card sorting.

03:18.960 --> 03:21.600
No, I won't tell you how I know, but I know for a fact.

03:21.600 --> 03:25.000
Nick knows for a fact that he ain't kidding around no more.

03:25.000 --> 03:26.400
He's got S to do.

03:26.400 --> 03:27.400
Things have changed around.

03:27.400 --> 03:30.160
He says, Hey, Chris and Michael, I want to say cheers to Chris.

03:30.160 --> 03:35.040
I don't remember exactly when I started listening to JB, but it was somewhere in 2012 or so.

03:35.040 --> 03:36.760
So it's been 10 years for sure.

03:36.760 --> 03:38.080
So thanks for all the shows.

03:38.080 --> 03:40.120
Well, thank you for listening.

03:40.120 --> 03:41.400
Now onto the main topic.

03:41.400 --> 03:45.080
I was doing some catching up on Coder Radio recently, and I stumbled on your discussion

03:45.080 --> 03:49.080
about Mac OS and Windows stealing Linux desktop users.

03:49.080 --> 03:55.160
Well, I'm a recent six months or so Windows convert after 10 years of exclusive Linux

03:55.160 --> 03:56.160
desktop use.

03:56.160 --> 03:57.320
So I wanted to chime in.

03:57.320 --> 04:00.460
I guess I'm older now.

04:00.460 --> 04:05.440
And while in 2012 I was a student, nowadays I have a day job with responsibilities.

04:05.440 --> 04:08.180
So I really like my machines to just sort of be appliances.

04:08.180 --> 04:12.560
You turn it on, runs, does what I want.

04:12.560 --> 04:13.560
That's it.

04:13.560 --> 04:15.800
And honestly, desktop Linux become too much of a hassle for me.

04:15.800 --> 04:20.840
As stupid as this might sound to some, Windows is the ultimate LTS.

04:20.840 --> 04:26.280
If you apply some basic best practices like having a backup and not running from sites

04:26.280 --> 04:29.160
with pictures of naked ladies, it just runs.

04:29.160 --> 04:32.680
Everything works because everything is written with Windows in mind.

04:32.680 --> 04:37.440
Further, besides WSL, I think Redmond has got two more things that might snare some

04:37.440 --> 04:38.680
Linux users.

04:38.680 --> 04:39.840
One is this new Windows terminal.

04:39.840 --> 04:40.840
Well, things good.

04:40.840 --> 04:44.360
Also, did you know SSH is installed and on by default now?

04:44.360 --> 04:48.920
You fire it up and you can SSH into Windows like it was a Linux box.

04:48.920 --> 04:53.520
The other thing I hear nobody mentioning is Hyper-V. Nowadays, we all have pretty beefy

04:53.520 --> 04:55.480
machines, so why not run VMs?

04:55.480 --> 05:00.160
Hyper-V is no problem for anybody that ever had to run Vert Manager.

05:00.160 --> 05:04.560
Its ultimate killer feature, though, is dynamic memory management that just works, meaning

05:04.560 --> 05:09.080
VMs do not use all the memory you allocate to them, but just what they need right now.

05:09.080 --> 05:12.760
I could run two, three, four Linux VMs daily and not even worry about memory at all.

05:12.760 --> 05:16.120
I know it's possible to do these kinds of things with KVM, but I just never managed

05:16.120 --> 05:17.120
to get it right.

05:17.120 --> 05:18.600
Here, it's just a checkbox.

05:18.600 --> 05:20.600
Do I find all of this problematic?

05:20.600 --> 05:21.600
No.

05:21.600 --> 05:22.600
No.

05:22.600 --> 05:24.960
Now that I don't run Linux, I run way more Linux.

05:24.960 --> 05:29.360
I have various Linux machines where I can tinker when time permits and I use VMs daily

05:29.360 --> 05:31.580
for critical things like backups.

05:31.580 --> 05:34.080
And yeah, I am eyeing those damn MacBooks.

05:34.080 --> 05:36.080
It might just be a matter of time.

05:36.080 --> 05:37.080
Best regards.

05:37.080 --> 05:39.720
Of course you are.

05:39.720 --> 05:43.440
You know, the only thing that strikes me about this, Nick, but otherwise I totally feel where

05:43.440 --> 05:46.800
you're coming from, is you might still be in the honeymoon period.

05:46.800 --> 05:50.000
You know, six months with Windows usually takes about a year, I find, with a Windows

05:50.000 --> 05:51.000
Insta.

05:51.000 --> 05:52.840
For your registry to be completely polluted, yes.

05:52.840 --> 05:57.740
Well, and just to start getting a little tired, you know, of the way Microsoft does things.

05:57.740 --> 05:58.740
Just that.

05:58.740 --> 06:04.040
But I do remember when we tried Windows 10 for the show, which feels like ages ago, though,

06:04.040 --> 06:07.640
I do remember very much having what he said in here where, like, everything's just built

06:07.640 --> 06:09.500
for Windows.

06:09.500 --> 06:11.880
It's like, you just, you can get anything.

06:11.880 --> 06:18.120
There's every application, even like the esoteric free software stuff, is built for Windows.

06:18.120 --> 06:21.040
So like, and it's, there's only one Windows, really.

06:21.040 --> 06:23.480
So it's not like you, you know, you don't have to worry about devs and RPMs.

06:23.480 --> 06:26.480
There's just the Windows build and everything supports Windows.

06:26.480 --> 06:27.480
It's so nice.

06:27.480 --> 06:28.480
That's so nice.

06:28.480 --> 06:32.520
As a Linux user, that, you don't always have that experience.

06:32.520 --> 06:33.640
It's pretty common these days.

06:33.640 --> 06:34.640
Sure.

06:34.640 --> 06:41.480
I mean, it's, I don't know, I sort of feel like the Linux app compatibility stuff is

06:41.480 --> 06:44.480
kind of better than Mac at this point.

06:44.480 --> 06:45.480
Hmm.

06:45.480 --> 06:51.400
Because if you care about like games, I guess, because still no viable proton for Mac.

06:51.400 --> 06:54.760
I know people have sent me the link every time I say that, but that is a hell of a lot

06:54.760 --> 06:55.760
of work.

06:55.760 --> 06:56.760
All right.

06:56.760 --> 07:00.040
Our next email comes in from Christopher and he's dropping some Glad Whale bombs.

07:00.040 --> 07:01.040
He says, hi guys.

07:01.040 --> 07:04.680
I've been a show member since you returned and I'm glad I have the opportunity to support

07:04.680 --> 07:05.680
you.

07:05.680 --> 07:06.680
Well, thank you, sir.

07:06.680 --> 07:07.680
Hmm.

07:07.680 --> 07:10.720
Just thinking about how damn thankful I am for our members this morning, so thank you.

07:10.720 --> 07:15.040
He goes on to say your take on Malcolm Gladwell is spot on in Coder 478.

07:15.040 --> 07:19.960
I see him as a bit of a bomb thrower who enjoys intellectually tossing incendiary statements

07:19.960 --> 07:25.160
and watching the carnage of sociopaths abandoning their own thoughts and beliefs without critically

07:25.160 --> 07:28.320
analyzing what he's actually saying.

07:28.320 --> 07:33.040
What Gladwell is really saying against remote work is that work is a cult and you must stay

07:33.040 --> 07:34.960
in the compound.

07:34.960 --> 07:38.360
I like that he's like, he says Gladwell is playing like 40 chess here.

07:38.360 --> 07:40.280
I like that he just went for it.

07:40.280 --> 07:41.640
That's pretty, pretty hardcore.

07:41.640 --> 07:42.640
Yeah.

07:42.640 --> 07:43.640
I mean, I don't know.

07:43.640 --> 07:49.040
I, I can't say that I'm super aligned with how colorful this opinion is, but I definitely

07:49.040 --> 07:50.040
agree with the facts.

07:50.040 --> 07:51.040
I love it.

07:51.040 --> 07:52.040
I don't know if I do agree.

07:52.040 --> 07:53.880
I think Gladwell does believe what he was saying.

07:53.880 --> 07:55.560
So quick recap for those that didn't hear it.

07:55.560 --> 07:59.120
We played a clip of Malcolm Gladwell, author, podcaster who said, you know, don't you want

07:59.120 --> 08:00.520
to be a part of something?

08:00.520 --> 08:01.820
Don't you want to be your best you?

08:01.820 --> 08:03.480
Don't you want to do your best work of your life?

08:03.480 --> 08:05.040
Well, then you have to come into the office.

08:05.040 --> 08:06.680
That was basically his position.

08:06.680 --> 08:07.680
I don't know.

08:07.680 --> 08:13.080
I mean, I, I guess I, I guess I don't agree with you that I sort of feel like he, he says

08:13.080 --> 08:18.440
things like most people that align to his incentives and to his fear group.

08:18.440 --> 08:24.400
And uh, I mean, I have read all his things in favor of working in a cafe or in a, I think

08:24.400 --> 08:28.080
it was like a pub that played some kind of cool rock music that he liked.

08:28.080 --> 08:29.080
Right.

08:29.080 --> 08:35.560
So I don't know, you know, it's people tend to just pitch their own book, right?

08:35.560 --> 08:41.880
I, well, here's my thought and I hate to be this guy, but maybe he's not a digital native,

08:41.880 --> 08:42.880
right?

08:42.880 --> 08:47.720
Maybe he's not fully aware of all the tooling available to remote workers these days because

08:47.720 --> 08:51.200
really the best stuff is not used by most, by most organizations.

08:51.200 --> 08:57.600
They're sort of like during the pandemic, we got to this new minimum quality bar, which

08:57.600 --> 08:59.840
was way better than it was before the pandemic.

08:59.840 --> 09:02.580
Like before the pandemic, most people didn't have cameras.

09:02.580 --> 09:04.800
Their wifi couldn't handle video conferencing.

09:04.800 --> 09:05.800
It was horrible.

09:05.800 --> 09:06.800
Right.

09:06.800 --> 09:12.000
And we got to this new bar, but that bar is basically zoom, right?

09:12.000 --> 09:17.080
And you know, a Mac book camera and uh, air pod microphones.

09:17.080 --> 09:22.440
I don't know, I mean, I think for tech workers in particular and developers, I mean, some

09:22.440 --> 09:27.240
of the, the, uh, joint coding stuff or whatever we call that pair programming stuff in VS

09:27.240 --> 09:32.040
code is really in a very short amount of time has become incredibly impressive.

09:32.040 --> 09:33.420
See, I think that's just it.

09:33.420 --> 09:38.480
I think that's the difference between a successful remote work culture and the picture that Malcolm

09:38.480 --> 09:40.160
Gladwell was painting.

09:40.160 --> 09:43.540
Malcolm Gladwell, I think is painting the picture of the organization that doesn't take

09:43.540 --> 09:46.040
advantages of things like pair programming.

09:46.040 --> 09:51.240
But organizations like yours that are nimbler, uh, more up to speed on the tooling, more

09:51.240 --> 09:56.920
adaptable, more accommodating because of your size, you can employ things like VS code pair

09:56.920 --> 10:01.960
programming extensions that would take years to make their way into an enterprise, right?

10:01.960 --> 10:05.880
And that's, I think Malcolm's insight is the older school way of doing things.

10:05.880 --> 10:13.240
This zoom level of quality for remote work, not your version, which is, is much more dynamic.

10:13.240 --> 10:14.240
It's just much more collaborative.

10:14.240 --> 10:16.800
Well, it's also asynchronous by default, right?

10:16.800 --> 10:20.600
That, that, I mean, for me, you know, cause I've gone back and forth on the remote thing,

10:20.600 --> 10:24.400
having to just give up on the idea that things are going to happen at the same time every

10:24.400 --> 10:25.600
day.

10:25.600 --> 10:32.200
Once I made that sort of mental shift, a lot of my, let's say irritation as you know, the

10:32.200 --> 10:38.280
guy who wants the company went away, not expecting like, okay, it's 10 o'clock.

10:38.280 --> 10:39.280
Where the hell is he?

10:39.280 --> 10:40.280
Right?

10:40.280 --> 10:41.280
Like that kind of thing.

10:41.280 --> 10:42.280
There's a downside, right?

10:42.280 --> 10:45.160
And the downside of that is people do get used to it.

10:45.160 --> 10:48.560
And occasionally you're going to have to literally not aggressively, but you're going to have

10:48.560 --> 10:52.360
to do the old fashioned thing of just like call someone on their phone, even though they're

10:52.360 --> 10:56.640
not online, which I don't know why that feels super rude, but I feel like the culture has

10:56.640 --> 11:01.480
changed so much that just out of like calling someone about saying, Hey, you have a minute

11:01.480 --> 11:06.800
for a call feels like super intrusive, but that's, that's like the, the, the, you know,

11:06.800 --> 11:07.800
the emergency move.

11:07.800 --> 11:08.800
Right.

11:08.800 --> 11:09.800
That's right.

11:09.800 --> 11:10.800
Yeah.

11:10.800 --> 11:14.880
That's like a text ahead of time, like, Hey man, you got a second, like that's like, there

11:14.880 --> 11:15.880
must be something wrong.

11:15.880 --> 11:16.880
What is it?

11:16.880 --> 11:17.880
What's wrong?

11:17.880 --> 11:18.880
What's wrong?

11:18.880 --> 11:19.880
Right.

11:19.880 --> 11:20.880
Right.

11:20.880 --> 11:21.880
Yeah.

11:21.880 --> 11:22.880
That's, that's, I don't know.

11:22.880 --> 11:24.080
I mean, I would also add, and I don't want to hit this too hard, that I think a lot of

11:24.080 --> 11:30.360
this, uh, particularly for one, I think there's probably a generational component here too,

11:30.360 --> 11:31.360
right?

11:31.360 --> 11:37.800
You know, older generations like that are at the top of these large enterprises, basically

11:37.800 --> 11:43.880
boomers, probably it's just a lot of change for them, right?

11:43.880 --> 11:49.000
They've been in, think about this, if you're in your sixties or even early seventies and

11:49.000 --> 11:54.320
these kids today are asked kids today in their forties and thirties are asking you to change

11:54.320 --> 11:55.320
what you've been doing.

11:55.320 --> 11:56.320
It was good for you.

11:56.320 --> 11:57.320
Good for your dad.

11:57.320 --> 12:02.560
I think you'd fight and let's not leave, let's not ignore the Larry Ellison thing here of

12:02.560 --> 12:03.560
ego.

12:03.560 --> 12:10.640
A lot of these guys are, see themselves as like Kings and there's, and it's true that

12:10.640 --> 12:15.920
it certainly is appealing to walk into a place and like, it's your domain, right?

12:15.920 --> 12:19.240
I would, uh, these are all my people everywhere.

12:19.240 --> 12:21.880
These fluorescent lights touch is my kingdom.

12:21.880 --> 12:27.840
I would point you to what does look quite a bit like a penis, the Salesforce tower.

12:27.840 --> 12:30.800
I think I could just leave that one where it is, right?

12:30.800 --> 12:31.800
It's literally their castle.

12:31.800 --> 12:32.800
Yeah.

12:32.800 --> 12:36.240
It's literally something else too, but it's a very phallic castle.

12:36.240 --> 12:37.240
All right.

12:37.240 --> 12:43.240
So Jacob writes in kind of like with the context of, Oh, I think everybody's, everybody's feeling

12:43.240 --> 12:48.680
a little subscription exhausted, but, uh, he says this is probably one of the most thoughtfully

12:48.680 --> 12:55.080
written reason explanations for a transition to subscription model.

12:55.080 --> 12:58.800
He says, I'm also super glad I bought the app early because I'm grandfathered in.

12:58.800 --> 13:02.240
This is a big transition we've been seeing in the Apple ecosystem.

13:02.240 --> 13:03.420
This move to subscription.

13:03.420 --> 13:08.260
And now I think one of the most famous independent apps, one of the most famous modern independent

13:08.260 --> 13:11.640
apps on the Apple platforms is pixel mater.

13:11.640 --> 13:16.400
I don't know if you've ever tried it, but it Photoshop wishes it was this good.

13:16.400 --> 13:20.820
I don't believe that I have, I use something called acorn for that.

13:20.820 --> 13:26.440
And honestly, uh, the GIMP, so, you know, they took a lot of what makes Photoshop great

13:26.440 --> 13:32.820
and they just, they worked on that and then, but they built it in the era of metal and

13:32.820 --> 13:34.500
modern Apple APIs.

13:34.500 --> 13:40.900
So they built something kind of for the Apple Silicon era and it's accelerated throughout.

13:40.900 --> 13:44.640
It's just, it's one of those apps I'd love to have on Linux, but they, they really point

13:44.640 --> 13:47.420
out and you know, this is true.

13:47.420 --> 13:52.900
The core issue is, and they have a great visual they'll have linked in the show notes with

13:52.900 --> 13:59.220
the traditional type of model, your sales are really when you have a big new version

13:59.220 --> 14:04.120
and then you have a massive sales drop off, which will be the length of the development

14:04.120 --> 14:10.260
window and then you have a smaller but noticeable spike in sales when it's when it's time for

14:10.260 --> 14:11.260
an upgrade.

14:11.260 --> 14:15.480
But the revenue is never quite what the original sales was because for most people they're

14:15.480 --> 14:17.220
just buying the upgrade price.

14:17.220 --> 14:22.780
Meanwhile, the baseline cost to run your business, especially these days are always going up.

14:22.780 --> 14:27.740
So the revenue kind of Peters off over time as people buy discounted upgrades.

14:27.740 --> 14:30.380
Meanwhile, base costs going up.

14:30.380 --> 14:34.140
The other thing they point out, and I'm curious to know your thoughts on this specifically.

14:34.140 --> 14:39.660
One of the other issues with the upfront development paid model is they are essentially incentivized

14:39.660 --> 14:44.280
to hold features back to make releases big enough to get people to pay for them.

14:44.280 --> 14:49.660
So they'll sit, they'll hold a feature for a couple of months just to make it, you know,

14:49.660 --> 14:53.660
a good a good set of features that encourage you to upgrade.

14:53.660 --> 14:56.060
They have no way to do discounts via the app store.

14:56.060 --> 14:59.420
This is a classic one, so they have that problem as well.

14:59.420 --> 15:05.020
There's no way to do proper trial on the IOS devices, so, you know, a lot of these typical

15:05.020 --> 15:09.900
issues combined with low price pressure on mobile devices for an app that is now, I don't

15:09.900 --> 15:16.980
know, 10 years old with a team of independent developers working on it full time and they've

15:16.980 --> 15:19.080
been living on one time payments.

15:19.080 --> 15:22.260
They actually make a really solid case for subscriptions.

15:22.260 --> 15:27.180
I have to give it a think, though, because I'm an occasional user when I'm on an iPad.

15:27.180 --> 15:29.620
I do use it on an iPad from time to time.

15:29.620 --> 15:33.900
If I'm on a Mac for more than a couple of days, I generally install it because one of

15:33.900 --> 15:37.420
the things I love about it is the damn thing opens up Photoshop files like a champ.

15:37.420 --> 15:38.420
So it's like, oh, great.

15:38.420 --> 15:41.580
This is an opportunity for me to get, you know, some of my old graphics and get them

15:41.580 --> 15:47.300
out of a Photoshop format, and that's a huge opportunity, and it has a really slick web

15:47.300 --> 15:51.660
support, you know, where you can export files like PNGs and WebPs and JPEGs specifically

15:51.660 --> 15:55.620
encoded for web pages, like it's got a great tool for that.

15:55.620 --> 16:01.700
I just I think it's a really nice tool, but honestly, I use it sparingly once every few

16:01.700 --> 16:10.860
months and the pricing, albeit seeming fair, is five dollars per month or twenty four dollars

16:10.860 --> 16:15.460
per year or fifty five dollars for a lifetime license.

16:15.460 --> 16:18.660
Paging paid users will be grandfathered in for free.

16:18.660 --> 16:20.260
It's pretty good.

16:20.260 --> 16:21.740
It's pretty generous.

16:21.740 --> 16:24.140
I'd like to know what you think.

16:24.140 --> 16:29.540
You know, I think we've been talking about independent app pricing and just generally

16:29.540 --> 16:34.380
making money off software products for 13, 12 years, something like that.

16:34.380 --> 16:36.820
It's been a while.

16:36.820 --> 16:40.660
And unfortunately, this is where we've landed, right?

16:40.660 --> 16:44.660
The predictions we made have come true in weird ways.

16:44.660 --> 16:52.260
I think maybe the aspect of this is they need to make enough money to be sustainable.

16:52.260 --> 16:58.160
And people are not, how can I say, acculturated to spending a hundred, two hundred dollars

16:58.160 --> 17:00.580
on a piece of software once a year anymore.

17:00.580 --> 17:05.100
So you get nickel and dimed with subscriptions, which sometimes cost more, ironically.

17:05.100 --> 17:10.300
I can't see myself launching a product now that wasn't a type of either renewable or

17:10.300 --> 17:16.260
subscription or like an annual license that somehow didn't work once you didn't pay the

17:16.260 --> 17:17.260
license.

17:17.260 --> 17:21.740
Part of that is because a modern piece of software that's going to command any decent

17:21.740 --> 17:26.520
amount of revenue these days almost certainly has some sort of server component, which is

17:26.520 --> 17:29.400
an ongoing cost that you have to maintain.

17:29.400 --> 17:34.460
It probably has integrations with things like Google Work or I guess in this case they must

17:34.460 --> 17:37.260
maintain Photoshop compatibility, right?

17:37.260 --> 17:41.440
Well every time Photoshop in this case changes, I'm sure the Pixelmator folks have to go ahead

17:41.440 --> 17:43.460
and fix it, right?

17:43.460 --> 17:45.780
They got to change their software.

17:45.780 --> 17:47.860
And dozens of other formats, no doubt.

17:47.860 --> 17:48.860
Right.

17:48.860 --> 17:53.220
And if they integrate, I don't know this piece of software, but I know like Alice, for instance,

17:53.220 --> 17:57.140
if when Google decides they're going to pretend like they give a crap about privacy and just

17:57.140 --> 18:01.940
make it ever so slightly harder to refresh auth tokens, they did this like a year ago.

18:01.940 --> 18:07.100
That's just a cost I have to absorb and then like the redeployment for every single instance.

18:07.100 --> 18:08.580
So I get it.

18:08.580 --> 18:09.580
I don't...

18:09.580 --> 18:14.820
I mean, I agree with Jacob that this kind of sucks, but part of a little bit of a devil's

18:14.820 --> 18:19.600
advocate here is the user expectations of everything just kind of working together and

18:19.600 --> 18:26.100
all your stuff being in the cloud, it just makes it more expensive.

18:26.100 --> 18:27.740
I mean, think about...

18:27.740 --> 18:31.060
I always come back to this because I just think it's really funny.

18:31.060 --> 18:33.180
Facebook's bad day where they pissed off Tim Cook, right?

18:33.180 --> 18:39.220
And he just shut down all the internal Facebook iOS apps with the stroke of a key.

18:39.220 --> 18:41.340
That's what's up, right?

18:41.340 --> 18:44.260
That's another form of dependency, another form of maintenance cost.

18:44.260 --> 18:48.940
You have to keep your stuff in compliance with all these third party things now.

18:48.940 --> 18:53.260
Pixelmator, if it's a Mac app, I would bet my hat that it's at least notarized.

18:53.260 --> 18:55.860
If it's on the App Store, it certainly is, right?

18:55.860 --> 19:01.460
So that's, again, got to keep in compliance, got to keep updating to the new OS, if Apple

19:01.460 --> 19:06.700
changes their mind because it's Tuesday and they say it's privacy, but they want to be

19:06.700 --> 19:12.000
the only one to sell ads on iOS, you have to change something potentially.

19:12.000 --> 19:16.540
So I mean, it's tough.

19:16.540 --> 19:17.820
It's tough out there these days.

19:17.820 --> 19:18.820
Yeah.

19:18.820 --> 19:23.400
And it makes me think the subscriptions aren't going away, right?

19:23.400 --> 19:26.720
Because this is a clear advantage for them in a development model.

19:26.720 --> 19:30.380
It's going to make it sustainable and predictable from a revenue standpoint for them.

19:30.380 --> 19:35.780
And so then I start thinking, all right, well, in arguably, the subscription model does make

19:35.780 --> 19:39.420
sense for some types of services and apps and media and whatnot.

19:39.420 --> 19:46.720
So it's like, well, then it seems like the job really falls on me now to just be more

19:46.720 --> 19:51.860
vigilant than I have in any other point in my lifetime about managing my subscriptions

19:51.860 --> 19:53.460
and my family's subscriptions.

19:53.460 --> 19:57.740
Because like Circus Freak points out in our Matrix chat room, you can have family members

19:57.740 --> 20:03.700
like my kids or my mom, I've looked at their subscriptions, thankfully, iOS makes it pretty

20:03.700 --> 20:05.460
easy to review.

20:05.460 --> 20:10.020
And I've seen $99 a year for a video editor that they wanted to use one time for a family

20:10.020 --> 20:13.440
video that they haven't used for six months.

20:13.440 --> 20:19.300
And all kinds of just absolutely outrageous, totally scam subscriptions that I can't believe

20:19.300 --> 20:20.300
Apple lets in.

20:20.300 --> 20:24.860
So they need to be better about that to make the market feel more comfortable about this.

20:24.860 --> 20:28.820
I need to be more vigilant about it because it's easy to get subscription creep.

20:28.820 --> 20:35.340
And then those of us who have a subscription like the QA membership and Jupiter party,

20:35.340 --> 20:40.380
like I've got to always be working to make that subscription more valuable.

20:40.380 --> 20:42.220
You can't just create it and then leave it there.

20:42.220 --> 20:43.940
And that's the lesson I'm internalizing right now.

20:43.940 --> 20:48.320
And it's like, okay, so now we've got a whole other list of projects to just bring more

20:48.320 --> 20:52.580
features to our member feeds because if I'm going to ask for a subscription revenue, I

20:52.580 --> 20:53.580
got to keep it competitive.

20:53.580 --> 20:54.580
I got to keep adding stuff to it.

20:54.580 --> 20:55.580
I got to keep creating value.

20:55.580 --> 20:58.860
And I think that's something that's going to make the difference between the successful

20:58.860 --> 21:03.900
programs and failures and successful developers and failed developers.

21:03.900 --> 21:07.680
One other model that I meant to mention a couple of weeks ago, but I forgot.

21:07.680 --> 21:13.740
So I use OmniGraffle quite a bit, which is like a really pretty Mac, what would you call

21:13.740 --> 21:14.740
it?

21:14.740 --> 21:15.740
A diagramming tool?

21:15.740 --> 21:16.740
Yeah.

21:16.740 --> 21:21.420
Sort of like the Visio Kin, but maybe a little bit easier and not quite as hardcore, maybe.

21:21.420 --> 21:22.420
Not quite as hardcore.

21:22.420 --> 21:26.460
So if you download some of the extensions, it gets wild.

21:26.460 --> 21:30.220
And there's an iPad app, but I generally use it on the Mac because big screen complicated

21:30.220 --> 21:31.220
systems.

21:31.220 --> 21:32.220
Yay.

21:32.220 --> 21:36.220
And they will sell this piece of software to you in one of two ways.

21:36.220 --> 21:40.060
One way is a annual or monthly subscription.

21:40.060 --> 21:41.940
The other way is straight up.

21:41.940 --> 21:47.100
And I've never bought the regular version, I use the pro versions, 250 bucks.

21:47.100 --> 21:54.100
But if you buy the straight up, what happens is to use their kind of cloud syncing system,

21:54.100 --> 21:56.540
you have to subscribe to that.

21:56.540 --> 21:58.940
So what they've effectively done, and I think this is actually...

21:58.940 --> 22:01.980
I was annoyed when I first saw it, but then I'm thinking about it and having a little

22:01.980 --> 22:05.300
empathy as a fellow kind of independent developer.

22:05.300 --> 22:09.540
The cloud service is an ongoing maintenance cost and potential, I guess, they have to

22:09.540 --> 22:12.000
maintain security servers, whatever.

22:12.000 --> 22:16.160
So they're just breaking that out and charging for that.

22:16.160 --> 22:20.260
That's not the craziest thing.

22:20.260 --> 22:23.400
The other thing I should add, if you do the subscription, which they definitely want you

22:23.400 --> 22:26.100
to do, you also get the iOS version.

22:26.100 --> 22:28.420
If you do the traditional, you only get the Mac OS version.

22:28.420 --> 22:30.420
Yeah, I guess I see what you're saying.

22:30.420 --> 22:36.220
Yeah, I also, but I look at those kinds of things and I go, could they have just used

22:36.220 --> 22:39.300
iCloud and then not charged me?

22:39.300 --> 22:43.700
But all right, I'm sure they want to do more things than what iCloud will allow.

22:43.700 --> 22:47.500
And you're right, it is a reasonable revenue stream.

22:47.500 --> 22:50.460
Clearly though, this is a topic that people are still adjusting to.

22:50.460 --> 22:54.620
I'd like to hear your thoughts out there, coder.show slash contact, or boost it in with

22:54.620 --> 22:57.340
a new podcast app, or tell me in person.

22:57.340 --> 23:02.740
The meetups cometh, meetup.com slash Jupiter broadcasting the West Coast road tour made

23:02.740 --> 23:04.220
possible by Linode.

23:04.220 --> 23:06.500
It is another Linode on the road event.

23:06.500 --> 23:10.340
I just had a call with Linode last week, I think it was Thursday.

23:10.340 --> 23:15.820
There's some new swag that they're going to be including that they haven't really got

23:15.820 --> 23:18.140
out there much because there hasn't been many events.

23:18.140 --> 23:22.020
We have a new shirt design that we're working on for the trip that we'll be giving out.

23:22.020 --> 23:25.180
And then we're also going to do geocaches and we'll stash some of that stuff along the

23:25.180 --> 23:26.180
way.

23:26.180 --> 23:28.540
So even if you can't make it to a meetup but you're in the area, you might be able to find

23:28.540 --> 23:29.540
the geocache.

23:29.540 --> 23:34.100
So we got some fun stuff as well as a matrix room to help coordinate it all.

23:34.100 --> 23:39.000
We'll have links to all of that in the show notes, meetup.com slash Jupiter broadcasting.

23:39.000 --> 23:43.260
For that, it's coming up real soon now.

23:43.260 --> 23:49.020
Linode.com slash Coder, go there to get $100 in 60 day credit on a new account and go there

23:49.020 --> 23:50.020
to support the show.

23:50.020 --> 23:53.940
I love Linode, it's fast, reliable cloud hosting with the best support in the business.

23:53.940 --> 23:58.020
Right there, real humans every day, all day when you need them.

23:58.020 --> 24:00.460
Linode's how we run everything we've built for the last few years.

24:00.460 --> 24:03.500
It's how we are building our new website right now.

24:03.500 --> 24:05.600
Yeah, it's on Linode.

24:05.600 --> 24:07.300
We walk what we talk here.

24:07.300 --> 24:09.700
We really do love hosting everything on Linode.

24:09.700 --> 24:10.940
They are super fast.

24:10.940 --> 24:15.680
They have 11 data centers around the world and they're 30 to 50% cheaper than the hyperscalers

24:15.680 --> 24:18.680
who just want to upsell you and lock you in all the time.

24:18.680 --> 24:20.660
It just is a no brainer.

24:20.660 --> 24:25.260
And on top of all of that, with all of the data centers to choose from, with object storage,

24:25.260 --> 24:30.060
with all of their great features like VLAN support, the ability to provision things using

24:30.060 --> 24:34.620
things like Ansible and Kubernetes, we can deploy infrastructure as we need.

24:34.620 --> 24:37.900
And it has been something to watch this team go.

24:37.900 --> 24:41.380
Our community with Brent and Alex building this website has been incredible.

24:41.380 --> 24:45.540
And the infrastructure they deploy in one day would have taken me a month or two to

24:45.540 --> 24:49.120
deploy just, you know, a few years ago.

24:49.120 --> 24:53.500
You really have to try it out because it just takes your flexibility, your agility, your

24:53.500 --> 24:55.140
reach to a whole other level.

24:55.140 --> 25:00.500
You can play at a level that you would think would cost you thousands of dollars a month

25:00.500 --> 25:03.900
and they have systems that start at $5 a month.

25:03.900 --> 25:09.020
You go to linode.com slash coder and you get a hundred dollar credit on top of that.

25:09.020 --> 25:12.340
I just think it's such a great opportunity to try something, build something, put it

25:12.340 --> 25:14.020
in production for a bit, see how it does.

25:14.020 --> 25:16.340
A hundred dollars, you can really kick the tires.

25:16.340 --> 25:17.340
Go support the show.

25:17.340 --> 25:20.040
Try it out for yourself, linode.com slash coder.

25:20.040 --> 25:23.860
One more time, it's linode.com slash coder.

25:23.860 --> 25:28.860
Oh, it's almost here and I'm not talking about fall.

25:28.860 --> 25:32.780
I'm talking about dot net seven.

25:32.780 --> 25:38.100
And you know, Mr. Dominic, I remember a time when dot net was just brand new.

25:38.100 --> 25:39.860
I really do too.

25:39.860 --> 25:40.860
It's so sad.

25:40.860 --> 25:43.460
When our ASP was like her Coca-Cola classic.

25:43.460 --> 25:44.800
Oh man.

25:44.800 --> 25:47.140
Remember how everything was active for a while?

25:47.140 --> 25:48.140
Active everything.

25:48.140 --> 25:49.140
Yes.

25:49.140 --> 25:52.660
I have wild security holes.

25:52.660 --> 25:56.900
We move forward a little bit, just a little bit forward in time to a dot net seven preview

25:56.900 --> 26:01.460
seven, which came out just a few days ago as we record this here podcast.

26:01.460 --> 26:04.300
Yeah, there's some, there's some good stuff in here.

26:04.300 --> 26:05.680
Couple things of note.

26:05.680 --> 26:12.860
If you are a Xamarin slash Maui developer, you can be really excited to wait.

26:12.860 --> 26:19.300
No dot net seven for you yet because Maui is the project curse in time to constantly

26:19.300 --> 26:20.300
be behind.

26:20.300 --> 26:21.300
I think it's Xamarin.

26:21.300 --> 26:25.200
No, Xamarin is, so it's weird.

26:25.200 --> 26:29.140
So Maui is based on Xamarin.

26:29.140 --> 26:32.140
I think it's Mooey.

26:32.140 --> 26:33.140
Mooey?

26:33.140 --> 26:34.140
I'm sorry.

26:34.140 --> 26:35.140
I'm sorry.

26:35.140 --> 26:38.900
I don't even, you totally made me lose track.

26:38.900 --> 26:39.900
All right.

26:39.900 --> 26:40.900
Yeah.

26:40.900 --> 26:41.900
So, but there are some good features at dot net seven.

26:41.900 --> 26:44.380
The usual crowing about performance and portability.

26:44.380 --> 26:45.860
Great work, Microsoft.

26:45.860 --> 26:47.660
Nicely done.

26:47.660 --> 26:48.660
Simplified rate limiting.

26:48.660 --> 26:52.580
Rate limiting is, so this is obviously for like the server side stuff, right?

26:52.580 --> 26:53.580
Like ASP.

26:53.580 --> 26:56.900
Rate limiting is a pain in the butt on all platforms.

26:56.900 --> 26:58.380
So simplifying it sounds good.

26:58.380 --> 27:01.900
I looked at the codes and the samples they put up.

27:01.900 --> 27:02.900
Very magical.

27:02.900 --> 27:04.020
We'll see.

27:04.020 --> 27:05.140
I like it.

27:05.140 --> 27:11.540
The one that really got me was this minimal API enhancement section and I put it in quotes

27:11.540 --> 27:12.540
in the doc.

27:12.540 --> 27:13.540
Yeah.

27:13.540 --> 27:18.100
Because basically I guess they have listened to people making fun of C sharp for being

27:18.100 --> 27:22.980
somewhat verbose compared to say your, you know, your pythons of the world.

27:22.980 --> 27:29.220
And they're effectively making the API calls just a lot cleaner and simpler for your API's,

27:29.220 --> 27:30.220
right?

27:30.220 --> 27:33.660
So again, this would be like you're writing a rest service or something like that.

27:33.660 --> 27:35.300
On the back end.

27:35.300 --> 27:36.300
It's boring.

27:36.300 --> 27:40.260
Like if you think about it, it's okay, you have the type of, but I, I found the examples

27:40.260 --> 27:46.100
they gave versus the the old style of doing it very readable and oddly pythonic.

27:46.100 --> 27:48.740
Yes, I'm, I'm using that cause I coined it last week.

27:48.740 --> 27:49.740
I'll take it.

27:49.740 --> 27:51.260
I think this is a great use.

27:51.260 --> 27:52.420
And I don't know.

27:52.420 --> 27:58.460
It made me not want to install windows 11, but Hey, you could.NET's cross platform.

27:58.460 --> 28:00.900
You can open VS code on any platform and do this.

28:00.900 --> 28:02.180
So this is just a preview.

28:02.180 --> 28:09.300
I'm not gonna spend a lot of time on it still, still the thorn in the lion's paw of Microsoft

28:09.300 --> 28:11.220
is God damn Maui.

28:11.220 --> 28:16.700
It's just this thing has been taking so long and it's a crazy ambitious plan, right?

28:16.700 --> 28:20.180
It's a, it's another flavor of right once run everywhere.

28:20.180 --> 28:25.420
But if they actually pull that off and they can actually hit these performance metrics

28:25.420 --> 28:33.980
across platforms with, you know, reasonable variances, that is going to be pretty substantial.

28:33.980 --> 28:36.700
There's a bunch of stuff about blazer too, and this, I don't care about blazer.

28:36.700 --> 28:43.140
I very skeptical of blazer cause you know, anytime you try to avoid JavaScript and HTML

28:43.140 --> 28:45.480
and CSS, you just make more pain for yourself.

28:45.480 --> 28:49.660
Just embrace our JavaScript overlords and move on.

28:49.660 --> 28:53.340
Now don't send any pictures to your kid's pediatrician though.

28:53.340 --> 28:54.340
Oh boy.

28:54.340 --> 28:55.340
Oh boy.

28:55.340 --> 28:57.220
Um, that's a little tease.

28:57.220 --> 29:01.060
So before we get there, do you agree with the statement, the areas of Microsoft that

29:01.060 --> 29:08.060
really seem to be executing just continuously for years is this.NET and I would include

29:08.060 --> 29:11.340
just sort of the Linux area in general, the people that are creating some of the tools

29:11.340 --> 29:16.700
that they're releasing as free software, those projects, they're consistently performing

29:16.700 --> 29:17.700
on them, right?

29:17.700 --> 29:24.580
Just for years now, I feel like there is some aspects of Microsoft that are waning and teetering

29:24.580 --> 29:25.580
a bit.

29:25.580 --> 29:26.580
Office.

29:26.580 --> 29:27.580
Yeah.

29:27.580 --> 29:31.900
But this feels like an area that has just remained, just solid performers just executing

29:31.900 --> 29:32.980
nonstop.

29:32.980 --> 29:38.780
You know, I know this isn't the most pro Microsoft audience in the world, but a couple of years

29:38.780 --> 29:44.660
ago they had the goal of we will make.NET platform agnostic and it will be one.NET

29:44.660 --> 29:47.980
and they certainly had some, they had a journey there, right?

29:47.980 --> 29:51.060
We had.NET Core, we had all that crap.

29:51.060 --> 29:56.420
It's basically, if you're using all the modern stuff, it is the.NET standard, which is now

29:56.420 --> 29:57.420
just.NET.

29:57.420 --> 29:59.460
It's, they got it.

29:59.460 --> 30:02.900
The, with the one crazy hook hiccup of Maui, but-

30:02.900 --> 30:07.660
We'll see how 7.0 final goes, but doesn't it feel like they've really hit their stride?

30:07.660 --> 30:14.140
I think if they pull this off, and the reason I keep harping on Maui is because the missing

30:14.140 --> 30:19.340
piece has always been the front end, but at this juncture, I mean, some of the performance

30:19.340 --> 30:27.700
benchmarks that they're claiming, so who knows, in this.NET 7 preview, it's significantly,

30:27.700 --> 30:33.340
it's vast and even compared to like.NET 6.

30:33.340 --> 30:39.660
So if, I don't know, our dark matter devs out there, in five to six years, when you

30:39.660 --> 30:43.940
guys can upgrade to.NET 7, will you be happy?

30:43.940 --> 30:44.940
I mean, I would bet.

30:44.940 --> 30:46.240
I'd like to know.

30:46.240 --> 30:52.380
It feels to me like if these teams continue to execute, the Azure teams continue to execute,

30:52.380 --> 30:55.020
this is Microsoft's game to lose right here.

30:55.020 --> 30:58.660
Google is just really falling apart.

30:58.660 --> 31:00.100
They just don't execute anymore.

31:00.100 --> 31:02.780
We're about to get there, so I'll give more context.

31:02.780 --> 31:06.380
You know, Apple is focused on Swift and their platform, right?

31:06.380 --> 31:08.980
It's a different game they're playing.

31:08.980 --> 31:14.700
Microsoft is playing the entire market game, enterprise, individual developers, independent

31:14.700 --> 31:19.460
open source developers, you know, they have moments where they do things like they suspend

31:19.460 --> 31:23.620
the account of a free software developer who created TornadoCache and everybody goes, ooh,

31:23.620 --> 31:26.700
maybe that's a sign, but that's not really blowing it, right?

31:26.700 --> 31:30.260
Most people said, ah, that's for criminals anyways, who cares, and they moved on without

31:30.260 --> 31:32.580
giving it another thought, unfortunately.

31:32.580 --> 31:35.780
It really feels like this is Microsoft's game to lose at this point.

31:35.780 --> 31:41.060
.NET is just a part of that, but one of their strongest parts of that strategy.

31:41.060 --> 31:42.060
I'm impressed to see it.

31:42.060 --> 31:45.800
Okay, let's talk about this Google thing, because it's what our chat room is talking

31:45.800 --> 31:51.020
about right now as we record, because last night, I think it was, an article came out

31:51.020 --> 31:56.720
in the New York Times about a dad who sent photos from his Android device of his baby's

31:56.720 --> 32:03.320
groin to a doctor, you know, doing like telemedicine, which is becoming super common, and then Google

32:03.320 --> 32:09.020
disabled his account and reported him to the police because their CSAM scanner flagged

32:09.020 --> 32:11.300
him for child porn.

32:11.300 --> 32:16.460
It took about two days after he took the pictures, and then Mark's phone made a notification

32:16.460 --> 32:17.460
noise.

32:17.460 --> 32:22.300
His account had been disabled due to harmful content that was in, quote, a severe violation

32:22.300 --> 32:24.700
of Google's policies and might be illegal.

32:24.700 --> 32:28.300
Then he had a, quote, learn more link that led to a possible list of reasons, you've

32:28.300 --> 32:32.380
seen these Google help pages, I'm sure, and one of the many reasons on the page was, quote,

32:32.380 --> 32:34.380
sexual abuse and exploitation.

32:34.380 --> 32:38.100
It took the dad, Mark, a little bit to even figure it out, because he didn't think of

32:38.100 --> 32:42.340
this right at first, but then he realized, oh God, a couple of days ago, I did take those

32:42.340 --> 32:46.220
pictures and Google probably thinks that was porn.

32:46.220 --> 32:52.860
This led to an investigation into the dad, and I'm not sure, probably by the time this

32:52.860 --> 32:58.940
episode comes out, we'll have some resolution, but as we record, he still doesn't have access

32:58.940 --> 33:06.100
to his Google account, even though he's been cleared by the police, and all he did was

33:06.100 --> 33:10.900
take pictures of his kid with his own device, but because he uses Google Photos and they're

33:10.900 --> 33:17.400
scanning your photos, they detected this, and consider this, too, right?

33:17.400 --> 33:24.720
In this situation, this wasn't a picture that matched a preexisting model out there, right?

33:24.720 --> 33:25.900
These photos were unique.

33:25.900 --> 33:30.860
There was no hash in any law enforcement database for these pictures of his kids growing, and

33:30.860 --> 33:36.140
Google still found them, so they're looking at everyone's stuff, and they're not just

33:36.140 --> 33:43.420
looking for preexisting images, they're looking at each individual picture, all of your stuff,

33:43.420 --> 33:47.740
and they're throwing their various models at it, which appear to be very accurate.

33:47.740 --> 33:54.900
I would say classified as intended, but context matters in these situations, and it just happened

33:54.900 --> 33:55.900
automatically.

33:55.900 --> 34:00.700
All he did wrong was use an Android device, and let's be honest, we know it won't be very

34:00.700 --> 34:03.700
long until this is the same situation on iOS.

34:03.700 --> 34:04.700
It almost was.

34:04.700 --> 34:08.500
It wasn't in this last OS release, and they postponed it.

34:08.500 --> 34:11.180
You and I are both dads, but this just drives me crazy.

34:11.180 --> 34:18.020
Oh, this one, I just a few months ago had a conversation with a friend who, she just

34:18.020 --> 34:24.180
had a child not so long ago, and she's like, oh, I sent a cute picture of him on the bathtub

34:24.180 --> 34:25.180
to my mom.

34:25.180 --> 34:27.180
I said, just do not do that again.

34:27.180 --> 34:28.180
Don't.

34:28.180 --> 34:33.140
And yeah, this is literally the reason why I told her not to do that, right?

34:33.140 --> 34:37.820
I said, you don't understand everything, which then she thought I was a tinfoil maniac, but

34:37.820 --> 34:47.660
yeah, I would say, I mean, I read some of the responses to this, which I thought were

34:47.660 --> 34:54.160
chilling, to be honest with you, that, well, the classifier worked, and there was a human

34:54.160 --> 34:57.420
review, and the human review referred it to the police, who, without saying anything,

34:57.420 --> 35:02.980
started an investigation, pulled all his account information, including apparently some, I

35:02.980 --> 35:10.900
guess, intimate photos of some woman or something, and yeah, that's fine.

35:10.900 --> 35:12.420
He didn't get charged.

35:12.420 --> 35:13.420
So that worked, right?

35:13.420 --> 35:14.420
The system worked.

35:14.420 --> 35:15.420
But think about that.

35:15.420 --> 35:22.020
His entire life was now just on a bunch of San Francisco detectives' desks, or San Diego

35:22.020 --> 35:23.020
detectives.

35:23.020 --> 35:27.260
Well, and this also, these pictures got forwarded to a team internally at Google, and so the

35:27.260 --> 35:31.540
police are looking at his kid's crotch, a team of people at Google are looking at his

35:31.540 --> 35:34.500
kid's crotch, and all he did was telemedicine.

35:34.500 --> 35:38.800
Well, not only that, but they pulled not just the stuff off his phone, they pulled his entire

35:38.800 --> 35:43.940
Google account, emails, possibly text arguments, because the police got a warrant.

35:43.940 --> 35:49.540
By the way, the fact that an automated flag can be used to trigger probable cause for

35:49.540 --> 35:52.320
a hyperinvasive warrant is just...

35:52.320 --> 36:00.100
That then gives them your entire Google account, your search history, all of his location history,

36:00.100 --> 36:04.500
all of his messages, all of his Google Docs were all given over to law enforcement because

36:04.500 --> 36:07.020
of this process, automatically.

36:07.020 --> 36:08.020
And these were not...

36:08.020 --> 36:14.780
So the CSAM promise was that there would be hashed photos that are known to the authorities

36:14.780 --> 36:17.180
to be child pornography.

36:17.180 --> 36:19.420
This was not that, right?

36:19.420 --> 36:22.780
This was using machine learning to basically...

36:22.780 --> 36:28.780
Just like hot dog, not hot dog, right, Silicon Valley from the HBO show.

36:28.780 --> 36:30.900
So there are more...

36:30.900 --> 36:36.400
Now it's hard because you can't say, well, don't police this, but this kind of seems

36:36.400 --> 36:38.620
like a wild overreach.

36:38.620 --> 36:40.420
It's chilling the more we talk about it.

36:40.420 --> 36:47.260
It's just absolutely chilling because an accidental triggering of this process then invokes a

36:47.260 --> 36:53.300
discovery process which could find all kinds of things potentially that you never thought

36:53.300 --> 36:54.300
would be public.

36:54.300 --> 36:57.340
And I don't know, it's just, this is super chilling.

36:57.340 --> 37:01.540
This feels like a deal breaker for me, I have to be honest with you.

37:01.540 --> 37:07.860
Google Photos is such a remarkable product, but my God, and there's so much other metadata

37:07.860 --> 37:10.540
in those photos, including the faces of your family.

37:10.540 --> 37:14.980
Like I have a family member who's never been on social media ever.

37:14.980 --> 37:22.580
He's just, his late 60s never has ever created...

37:22.580 --> 37:23.900
I don't even know if he has a Google account.

37:23.900 --> 37:28.820
I know he has a Microsoft account, but I don't know if he has a Google account.

37:28.820 --> 37:33.460
And so in theory, he would have no social media footprint except for family members

37:33.460 --> 37:37.180
have taken pictures of him and put them on social media and we've uploaded them to our

37:37.180 --> 37:41.500
Google Photos and tagged his name and we, on the backend, Google can build a network

37:41.500 --> 37:45.180
of all of the different people who have that person's face in their photo library.

37:45.180 --> 37:50.740
Well, the interesting thing was in this case, just to bring it just particularly, well,

37:50.740 --> 37:53.260
the police cleared him and said it was a misunderstanding.

37:53.260 --> 37:58.260
So good on the police for not just like, I mean, I'm sure this guy was horrified, right?

37:58.260 --> 38:01.420
Because you've got the full weight of the government and you're accused of something

38:01.420 --> 38:02.420
heinous.

38:02.420 --> 38:03.420
So it's...

38:03.420 --> 38:07.020
Could you imagine, could you imagine how wrecked his life was for a period of time?

38:07.020 --> 38:08.020
Oh yeah.

38:08.020 --> 38:09.700
Persona and Agrata, right?

38:09.700 --> 38:11.980
But Google still wouldn't give him his account back.

38:11.980 --> 38:12.980
Right.

38:12.980 --> 38:14.780
It just destroyed all his data.

38:14.780 --> 38:15.780
Yeah.

38:15.780 --> 38:18.140
So what do you do?

38:18.140 --> 38:21.260
Because the other problem is, is like, what happens if your kid does this?

38:21.260 --> 38:22.260
You know, that your kids are screwing around.

38:22.260 --> 38:26.660
I had a situation, I can't remember if I'd mentioned it on the show or not, but my daughter

38:26.660 --> 38:34.740
recently was looped in because her watch has a phone number and she was looped in to a

38:34.740 --> 38:40.180
text message thread with other kids in her school during summer break about causing harm

38:40.180 --> 38:42.300
to another student.

38:42.300 --> 38:47.660
My red alert alarm goes off immediately, like now she's involved in a text message thread

38:47.660 --> 38:52.420
where kids are joking about causing harm to another student and all my daughter did was

38:52.420 --> 38:55.420
just get automatically looped in and they just won't stop and they won't stop and you

38:55.420 --> 38:57.260
know, of course it gets reported.

38:57.260 --> 39:01.060
And that kind of stuff could also just automatically get scanned and flagged.

39:01.060 --> 39:05.900
And it just feels like there's so many ways to accidentally get drawn in to where now

39:05.900 --> 39:08.220
your entire account contents get handed over.

39:08.220 --> 39:13.420
And the only way to really kind of prevent this sort of thing is to opt out of the legitimately

39:13.420 --> 39:18.660
nice to have features like Google Maps, because they also gave us the entire location history

39:18.660 --> 39:22.900
and Google Photos and your photos are for some of us the most precious thing we own.

39:22.900 --> 39:25.100
So there's another version of this.

39:25.100 --> 39:29.260
Oddly enough, I think it was the Wall Street Journal that published this story.

39:29.260 --> 39:35.740
The IRS in that new wonderful bill that everybody's so excited about is putting aside a ton of

39:35.740 --> 39:43.060
money for machine learning and social media analysis to try to catch tax cheats.

39:43.060 --> 39:45.180
But what is a tax sheet?

39:45.180 --> 39:50.580
What if let's say your grandma dies or you know, you inherit some money and you like

39:50.580 --> 39:52.220
buy a car.

39:52.220 --> 39:53.220
Same thing.

39:53.220 --> 39:54.340
Well, this is an anomalous thing.

39:54.340 --> 39:57.060
You said you only made, you know, $30,000.

39:57.060 --> 40:01.460
How did you buy that, whatever, right, just Chevy, who cares?

40:01.460 --> 40:02.760
That's where we're going with this.

40:02.760 --> 40:06.180
Everything is going to be analyzed against some model.

40:06.180 --> 40:08.780
I mean, I could think about how to write this model right now.

40:08.780 --> 40:16.700
Okay, I have a single dad who makes, you know, say $100,000 or claims to make 50.

40:16.700 --> 40:22.060
He lives in this zip code, average cost of living plus incidentals.

40:22.060 --> 40:26.580
He should have this type of profile on let's say, Insta, Facebook, whatever.

40:26.580 --> 40:31.900
Oh, this dude looks like he's more in that hundred, 105, 110 bracket than 50.

40:31.900 --> 40:33.220
Look at this picture of a Tesla.

40:33.220 --> 40:36.280
You know, we've identified a Tesla in this guy's photo feed.

40:36.280 --> 40:37.620
And you could automate this.

40:37.620 --> 40:41.580
Let's trigger, because if you've ever been audited, they start with a paper audit, right?

40:41.580 --> 40:43.620
They just say, show us documentation.

40:43.620 --> 40:50.820
And then they escalate up to a real audit and then a potentially criminal charge.

40:50.820 --> 40:52.380
That seems real scary.

40:52.380 --> 40:54.400
I'm just saying.

40:54.400 --> 40:55.600
And we've privatized it.

40:55.600 --> 40:56.600
We've privatized it.

40:56.600 --> 40:59.060
It's going to be contracted out, right?

40:59.060 --> 41:03.020
This is the most beautiful thing about it is all this information.

41:03.020 --> 41:08.660
It's all packaged up and beautifully delivered to the state automatically through this process.

41:08.660 --> 41:11.840
But it wasn't the state that collected the information, right?

41:11.840 --> 41:13.420
It's so beautiful.

41:13.420 --> 41:17.500
It's just both parties get to wipe their hands of any responsibility there.

41:17.500 --> 41:18.500
I did my part.

41:18.500 --> 41:19.500
Oh, I'm doing my part.

41:19.500 --> 41:23.940
So the same law and the reason I'm dunking on this law is because I'm not trying to be

41:23.940 --> 41:27.300
political, I'm just saying there's a lot of bad in this law.

41:27.300 --> 41:28.880
Welcome to unfiltered.

41:28.880 --> 41:33.220
Someone in Congress decided maybe it would be a good idea if the Defense Department,

41:33.220 --> 41:37.820
who isn't supposed to spy on American citizens, certainly not in the country, would have to

41:37.820 --> 41:42.660
disclose when they purchased the data from data brokers of American citizens.

41:42.660 --> 41:43.660
What an idea.

41:43.660 --> 41:48.340
The fact that they're routinely doing that, we didn't break the Fourth Amendment.

41:48.340 --> 41:51.620
I don't know how the hell they got the data, but we didn't break the Fourth Amendment.

41:51.620 --> 41:52.620
Right.

41:52.620 --> 41:54.260
They got the product from a private organization.

41:54.260 --> 41:55.980
Hey, they're a contractor.

41:55.980 --> 41:57.460
They went through the whole vetting process.

41:57.460 --> 42:02.340
They're in the, they have an, what is it, the NIA, I forgot the code, but the government

42:02.340 --> 42:03.580
classification code.

42:03.580 --> 42:05.500
So that's fine, right?

42:05.500 --> 42:06.500
It's totally cool.

42:06.500 --> 42:07.500
What Fourth Amendment?

42:07.500 --> 42:08.740
By the way, you know who was already doing that?

42:08.740 --> 42:09.860
The IRS.

42:09.860 --> 42:13.460
Now they want to automate it further and do it themselves with machine learning.

42:13.460 --> 42:18.260
Can I just say that this is what happens when people learn about this crap that Google's

42:18.260 --> 42:22.920
doing and Apple will be doing soon and Microsoft too, I'm sure, if not already.

42:22.920 --> 42:27.500
This is, this is, this is like you're two steps away from like this conversation we're

42:27.500 --> 42:29.100
having now.

42:29.100 --> 42:34.260
This is what happens because you start to realize, holy crap, this entire system is

42:34.260 --> 42:40.100
just designed to really take advantage of me if I make one mistake and I can't help

42:40.100 --> 42:44.940
but think the only thing one can do, and yet I'm not doing it, even though I try, the only

42:44.940 --> 42:46.620
thing you can do is not participate.

42:46.620 --> 42:47.780
Go listen to self-hosted.

42:47.780 --> 42:51.980
I just, just one last point on this and then we probably should move off the unfiltered

42:51.980 --> 42:52.980
stuff.

42:52.980 --> 42:59.340
They, they justified all of this crap, all of this crap that it's now evolved into with

42:59.340 --> 43:00.500
two main things.

43:00.500 --> 43:07.580
The classic, but think of the children, which I'm sympathetic to, but they didn't stop at,

43:07.580 --> 43:12.740
you know, protecting children and goddamn 9 11.

43:12.740 --> 43:20.540
If you, if you were to take a guy from, let's say the seventies, even at the height of protest

43:20.540 --> 43:26.620
and tell him how much surveillance is just routinely done in a mass way on American citizens,

43:26.620 --> 43:32.100
they probably wouldn't believe you because that sounds a lot like, ah, the Soviet Union.

43:32.100 --> 43:38.340
My last thing on this is really shame on Google because yet another tool they've built that

43:38.340 --> 43:43.660
is hostile to the user and pro establishment and I, what I mean by that is they could have

43:43.660 --> 43:49.060
built this thing where maybe the offender is presumed innocent and maybe there is a

43:49.060 --> 43:53.580
little bit more of a check and balances before like the kid's crotch is showed to a team

43:53.580 --> 43:56.820
of people at different agencies.

43:56.820 --> 44:01.020
Maybe the per maybe the person could be presumed innocent, but they never do that.

44:01.020 --> 44:03.100
Same with YouTube, right?

44:03.100 --> 44:04.680
This episode will get flagged.

44:04.680 --> 44:05.860
Every single live stream does.

44:05.860 --> 44:09.340
I didn't play anything copyrighted, but it will get, I've had my own voice.

44:09.340 --> 44:13.340
I've literally had my voice in the intros get flagged.

44:13.340 --> 44:15.180
They assume I'm guilty by default.

44:15.180 --> 44:16.940
All their tooling always does.

44:16.940 --> 44:19.620
They assume I'm in the wrong.

44:19.620 --> 44:21.680
They're minimizing their legal liability.

44:21.680 --> 44:28.140
It gets to the core of these giant mega rich corporations that have dumped on the market

44:28.140 --> 44:34.060
to get incredible market share have never built out the support department that even

44:34.060 --> 44:39.800
comes even just a tiny percentage, a tiny fraction of the size of their actual user

44:39.800 --> 44:40.940
base.

44:40.940 --> 44:45.100
They're trying to become Kings without having any support.

44:45.100 --> 44:50.340
And so you get a situation where this guy, this guy might get his account back now that

44:50.340 --> 44:54.020
the New York fricking times wrote about it, but otherwise he'd be SOL.

44:54.020 --> 44:55.020
He's not.

44:55.020 --> 44:56.020
He's not.

44:56.020 --> 44:57.020
So Google, it's just their policy.

44:57.020 --> 45:01.260
There've been, according to the reporter in the times there is have, she was on Twitter

45:01.260 --> 45:02.260
elaborating.

45:02.260 --> 45:06.220
They're having other cases, it almost exactly like this.

45:06.220 --> 45:08.260
And Google's policy is once you're flagged, you're flagged.

45:08.260 --> 45:10.140
Well, of course this isn't the first one.

45:10.140 --> 45:12.180
Of course this isn't my God.

45:12.180 --> 45:15.020
I wonder how many other lives they've completely destroyed with this.

45:15.020 --> 45:20.040
What if it was his Google work account, just like take his whole business offline.

45:20.040 --> 45:23.100
What if the guy was in the process of a divorce, right?

45:23.100 --> 45:26.620
And his ex wife tried to leverage this against him during the divorce proceedings.

45:26.620 --> 45:31.260
Like, what if this, I mean, imagine if this kind of investigation leaked public for somebody

45:31.260 --> 45:36.380
who's, you know, in a, in a public position or something like just, it could destroy someone's

45:36.380 --> 45:37.380
life or career.

45:37.380 --> 45:38.660
It would destroy his life.

45:38.660 --> 45:40.020
And we're just not even hearing about it.

45:40.020 --> 45:44.700
And they, all of these, all these systems just assume that the person is guilty by default

45:44.700 --> 45:46.220
because it's the least amount of work.

45:46.220 --> 45:47.580
It's the least amount of cost.

45:47.580 --> 45:50.100
It's the least amount of friction with law enforcement policy.

45:50.100 --> 45:52.180
And it doesn't require a support department.

45:52.180 --> 45:53.420
We're the product, right?

45:53.420 --> 45:55.240
We are the product, not the customer.

45:55.240 --> 45:57.180
But I sure can't wait for that new pixel.

45:57.180 --> 46:01.620
All right, and, and by the way, if you don't, we've been pretty harshing on Google.

46:01.620 --> 46:05.020
If you don't think Apple and Microsoft do stuff like this, Apple to a lesser degree,

46:05.020 --> 46:07.620
but they're going to, Google's probably just the best at it.

46:07.620 --> 46:10.260
And Facebook, Facebook's already doing this at large scale.

46:10.260 --> 46:11.260
Yeah.

46:11.260 --> 46:15.020
But if you pay in rubles, you're fine.

46:15.020 --> 46:17.860
Tailscale.com slash coder.

46:17.860 --> 46:23.340
Tailscale is a zero config VPN and installs on any device in minutes and it manages your

46:23.340 --> 46:27.900
firewall rules, it'll take care of your double nets and your devices connect directly to

46:27.900 --> 46:34.220
each other using a mesh network protected by a WireGuard's noise protocol.

46:34.220 --> 46:35.800
That's it right there.

46:35.800 --> 46:39.300
That's the concept, but it is a game changer.

46:39.300 --> 46:42.140
And I, I don't know, I don't think, uh, I don't think I know the term cause I was never

46:42.140 --> 46:46.420
really into like a band before they got popular, but that's how I feel with Tailscale right

46:46.420 --> 46:47.420
now.

46:47.420 --> 46:48.420
So I think you know what I mean, right?

46:48.420 --> 46:53.120
Like I feel like I was into Tailscale just a little bit before it got popular and now

46:53.120 --> 46:58.460
I see folks talking about the way Tailscale changes the way they work all the time.

46:58.460 --> 47:02.060
And I'm like, yeah, I know, I know, I've been telling people about it.

47:02.060 --> 47:03.980
I hope they went to tailscale.com slash coder.

47:03.980 --> 47:08.060
I don't know, but you can, you can support the show and you can try it out.

47:08.060 --> 47:13.540
Tailscale allows you to build a flat network protected by WireGuard's noise protocol.

47:13.540 --> 47:14.540
And it even supports DNS.

47:14.540 --> 47:18.460
So if you want to throw a DNS server in that flat network, you can start resolving machines

47:18.460 --> 47:19.940
by their name.

47:19.940 --> 47:25.180
They've also recently introduced Tailscale SSH, which allows you to establish an SSH

47:25.180 --> 47:30.820
connection between your devices on the Tailscale network and you can control access with the

47:30.820 --> 47:33.740
built in ACL controls in Tailscale.

47:33.740 --> 47:38.220
You don't have to manage SSH keys and you can authenticate the SSH connection using

47:38.220 --> 47:39.220
WireGuard.

47:39.220 --> 47:41.020
The whole thing is mind blowing.

47:41.020 --> 47:44.420
I'm going to play with it this weekend, get everything all ready for the road trip coming

47:44.420 --> 47:46.940
up because I've already got all my devices in Tailscale.

47:46.940 --> 47:48.740
So yeah, I'm going to take advantage of this.

47:48.740 --> 47:54.340
I use Tailscale to maintain my kids computers, my friends, my family and my work systems.

47:54.340 --> 47:57.540
It's so great because you can also share a single node with somebody and I find that

47:57.540 --> 47:59.820
really useful, really super useful.

47:59.820 --> 48:03.900
And I've just no longer have any inbound ports on my firewalls.

48:03.900 --> 48:05.460
I've just turned them all off.

48:05.460 --> 48:11.840
They're all off now, guys, guys, no inbound traffic at all.

48:11.840 --> 48:13.500
That's the way it should be.

48:13.500 --> 48:14.740
Tailscale made that possible.

48:14.740 --> 48:16.900
Just a game changer, game changer.

48:16.900 --> 48:18.460
You want your, you want your game changed?

48:18.460 --> 48:19.980
You want to know what that actually means?

48:19.980 --> 48:21.820
People say it all the time.

48:21.820 --> 48:22.820
What does it actually mean?

48:22.820 --> 48:24.820
Go find out.

48:24.820 --> 48:25.900
Tailscale.com slash coder.

48:25.900 --> 48:26.900
I mean it.

48:26.900 --> 48:27.900
I love it.

48:27.900 --> 48:31.380
Tailscale.com slash coder.

48:31.380 --> 48:32.940
Well let's talk about a little development.

48:32.940 --> 48:37.780
I don't know, maybe some programming, something related to coding because I need to change

48:37.780 --> 48:38.780
the subject.

48:38.780 --> 48:39.780
Okay.

48:39.780 --> 48:40.780
So are we coding a bunker?

48:40.780 --> 48:41.780
No.

48:41.780 --> 48:47.700
So, so I have been for a while now using Ionic again, which for folks who don't know, Ionic

48:47.700 --> 48:55.080
is a cross-platform mobile webby framework, I want to say.

48:55.080 --> 49:02.000
It's really more of a collection of stuff, but that focuses on web-based mobile development.

49:02.000 --> 49:08.620
There's three flavors of it, React, Vue, and the good one, Angular.

49:08.620 --> 49:15.300
So I'm of course using Angular because I am not a heathen nor a Facebook fan.

49:15.300 --> 49:17.540
And I'd just like to talk about it a little bit because it's pretty cool.

49:17.540 --> 49:22.700
It is totally TypeScript-y, a lot of really cool native plugins.

49:22.700 --> 49:25.380
If you've ever done PhoneGap development, God rest its soul.

49:25.380 --> 49:26.380
Oh yeah.

49:26.380 --> 49:33.000
You know that PhoneGap became Cordova and the folks at Ionic have come out with an open

49:33.000 --> 49:39.740
source project called Capacitor, which is compatible with Cordova, but in many ways

49:39.740 --> 49:42.900
better, mostly in the ways of performance.

49:42.900 --> 49:44.460
It is really neat.

49:44.460 --> 49:51.460
This kind of development methodology of doing basically web views, but having hooks into

49:51.460 --> 49:56.220
native APIs and into native hardware functionality is so much better.

49:56.220 --> 50:02.380
If you did this like five years ago, it was pretty jank, but today it is so good.

50:02.380 --> 50:06.380
I mean, I was surprised I was able to get Bluetooth connections working easily.

50:06.380 --> 50:09.740
I was able to write a small custom thing for a scanner.

50:09.740 --> 50:11.300
So low level stuff.

50:11.300 --> 50:15.660
Low level stuff, as long as the lords of Cupertino actually allow it natively.

50:15.660 --> 50:16.780
Yeah, of course.

50:16.780 --> 50:20.860
And then you have to write a TypeScript wrapper, or it could be JavaScript, right, and hook

50:20.860 --> 50:22.320
it in and register the component.

50:22.320 --> 50:29.380
If you've done Angular before, same kind of idea, just Capacitor.

50:29.380 --> 50:33.840
If you've ever done like extension development or even like a mod for a game or like Minecraft,

50:33.840 --> 50:38.180
it's the same idea of you write your little thing, you put it in, you got to register

50:38.180 --> 50:43.480
it with the application, rebuild the whole thing so it builds it in and huzzah.

50:43.480 --> 50:45.820
So they're taking this a step further.

50:45.820 --> 50:50.340
And I think they have two things that are interesting, AppFlow, which I'm currently

50:50.340 --> 50:52.200
doing a trial of.

50:52.200 --> 50:59.220
It's kind of a build in the cloud solution for all your horrific code signing needs.

50:59.220 --> 51:02.380
I have some feelings about it.

51:02.380 --> 51:09.660
One thing that I do like is if you have a very small, only HTML, JavaScript, CSS change,

51:09.660 --> 51:12.940
you can actually deploy that without going through the App Store.

51:12.940 --> 51:15.820
Are they creating build environments for you?

51:15.820 --> 51:18.380
Yeah, that's what they're doing.

51:18.380 --> 51:19.380
Yeah.

51:19.380 --> 51:22.260
You still have to upload like a signing key.

51:22.260 --> 51:25.660
But once you upload it, you know, the keys expire, I think like once a year, something

51:25.660 --> 51:26.660
like that.

51:26.660 --> 51:29.100
Wow, the infrastructure to do that must be super impressive.

51:29.100 --> 51:31.140
Well, they're also charging for it, right?

51:31.140 --> 51:33.460
Of course, I bet.

51:33.460 --> 51:35.660
The bill is not that bad, actually.

51:35.660 --> 51:40.740
But it was big enough that it's something I actually had to think about right before

51:40.740 --> 51:42.340
I like, ah, sure.

51:42.340 --> 51:48.260
So the deal with this is if it's just a web change, you can basically deploy it.

51:48.260 --> 51:51.800
Now, you have to comply with Apple's rules.

51:51.800 --> 51:55.640
So there's some gray area of like, how big of a change is it?

51:55.640 --> 52:00.200
But for all, like, if it's a, oh, my God, we had a typo on our about page, something

52:00.200 --> 52:02.940
like that, right in our app, you can change it.

52:02.940 --> 52:06.420
Anything that needs a native integration, unfortunately, has to go through the App Store.

52:06.420 --> 52:12.380
They also support, which I thought was really interesting, using this AppFlow system as

52:12.380 --> 52:17.160
basically your own little private test flight, but like the old test flight, where you just

52:17.160 --> 52:20.660
have like your client or your small internal team.

52:20.660 --> 52:26.580
And you're sending bills or just updating the build for the tester silently on the app.

52:26.580 --> 52:28.180
That is super cool.

52:28.180 --> 52:33.460
I can't tell you how many Trello tickets or back in the bad old days, Jira tickets, I've

52:33.460 --> 52:34.460
had open.

52:34.460 --> 52:38.860
And after like an hour of walking through on the phone with the dude, it was like, hey,

52:38.860 --> 52:41.180
man, did you get the build from like three days ago?

52:41.180 --> 52:43.180
Oh, no, I'm on the old build.

52:43.180 --> 52:44.180
Sorry, man.

52:44.180 --> 52:45.180
Yeah, dude.

52:45.180 --> 52:46.180
Well, we changed the API.

52:46.180 --> 52:47.780
So you got to, you know, whatever, whatever, whatever, right?

52:47.780 --> 52:52.520
So that's just freaking peachy.

52:52.520 --> 52:58.940
The other thing I'm just starting to evaluate that I have kind of, I have some fee-fees

52:58.940 --> 53:01.940
about portals.

53:01.940 --> 53:02.940
They call it portals.

53:02.940 --> 53:06.060
So I'm just going to read their little press clipping.

53:06.060 --> 53:07.700
Micro front ends for mobile portals.

53:07.700 --> 53:11.820
Micro front ends allow multiple teams to build, test and ship in parallel with hyper focused

53:11.820 --> 53:16.520
embedded web experience in your React native Android or iOS apps.

53:16.520 --> 53:22.500
So basically, let's say you have an iOS team, an Android team, you have a basically native

53:22.500 --> 53:28.460
app, right, more or less, but you just want some stupid like checkout views or, you know,

53:28.460 --> 53:32.300
some kind of registration view and you want it to be uniform and you want to spend a lot

53:32.300 --> 53:35.020
of time developing it twice.

53:35.020 --> 53:39.820
You could just develop it in one of these portal web views, install this portal SDK

53:39.820 --> 53:47.160
and it would be taken by either platform and intelligently remapped to the default type

53:47.160 --> 53:48.160
of controls.

53:48.160 --> 53:51.620
Oh, man, that sounds like the promised land.

53:51.620 --> 53:54.340
Well, it reminds me of those, what did Google call them?

53:54.340 --> 53:55.340
Like the little applets?

53:55.340 --> 53:59.500
I know it wasn't applets, but you didn't have to download the whole app kind of thing.

53:59.500 --> 54:00.500
Yeah.

54:00.500 --> 54:01.500
Like this, like the snap apps.

54:01.500 --> 54:02.500
Snap app.

54:02.500 --> 54:03.500
Yeah.

54:03.500 --> 54:04.500
Yeah.

54:04.500 --> 54:05.500
Is that what it was?

54:05.500 --> 54:07.220
I know both Apple and Google were experimenting with this, but Google was first.

54:07.220 --> 54:08.220
I can't remember.

54:08.220 --> 54:13.060
I never really, I've seen like a couple of them, but like they're app sheets essentially.

54:13.060 --> 54:14.060
App sheets.

54:14.060 --> 54:15.540
No, I think it was sheets.

54:15.540 --> 54:17.300
I think it was called sheets.

54:17.300 --> 54:26.140
So the interesting thing about this is you can apparently, and I've done some testing,

54:26.140 --> 54:34.140
it seems to work, use capacitor plugins in the portal view, even if the Xcode project

54:34.140 --> 54:37.460
is not built for capacitor.

54:37.460 --> 54:47.020
So even if you're golden Mac book, drinking tea out of a bowl, Swift developers have no

54:47.020 --> 54:51.860
idea and will not add that filthy, filthy capacitor dot framework to their project.

54:51.860 --> 54:52.860
Of course.

54:52.860 --> 54:55.260
You don't need their permission anymore.

54:55.260 --> 55:02.460
Tell them, put your feet off the desk, stop it hippie, we'll do this on the web.

55:02.460 --> 55:03.460
I like that.

55:03.460 --> 55:07.820
I still firmly believe that the web technologies are going to consume everything much like

55:07.820 --> 55:10.900
the Borg.

55:10.900 --> 55:18.780
What I don't buy right now is that Apple is not going to stop this because it seems in

55:18.780 --> 55:24.860
theory that you could tie these two things together and implement functionality after

55:24.860 --> 55:29.580
you've passed app review that would have not been reviewed.

55:29.580 --> 55:34.900
And I guess if it's significant enough would technically violate the terms.

55:34.900 --> 55:38.700
I could totally see what you're saying, but it feels like that ship has sailed.

55:38.700 --> 55:44.140
There are so many apps now where even the settings pane, they're all web views, but

55:44.140 --> 55:45.900
you don't even really know.

55:45.900 --> 55:51.040
In fact, like the whole Uber UI, both for eats and the app, they can add and remove

55:51.040 --> 55:53.440
elements from the UI on the backend.

55:53.440 --> 55:57.060
I think Marco does this with overcast as well, as well as other apps, obviously here's a

55:57.060 --> 55:58.060
couple of web views.

55:58.060 --> 56:00.020
So it kind of feels like that ship has sailed already.

56:00.020 --> 56:03.500
Like there's no going back now, but this has taken it to whole other levels.

56:03.500 --> 56:08.020
I could see what you're saying, but well, one ionic is not super huge, right?

56:08.020 --> 56:13.340
So will Apple notice and my impression of kind of chatting with the community on their

56:13.340 --> 56:18.900
forums is ionic is really, really loved by like people like me, right?

56:18.900 --> 56:22.220
People who develop internal line of business apps for other companies.

56:22.220 --> 56:26.300
I am very tempted because I need an app that can scan my magic, the gathering cards and

56:26.300 --> 56:30.980
put them in an inventory for me, of course, which obviously needs to be updated all the

56:30.980 --> 56:33.780
time and it needs deep native integration, right?

56:33.780 --> 56:35.260
And it needs to be highly secure.

56:35.260 --> 56:38.140
I'm talking end to end encryption here.

56:38.140 --> 56:40.100
Oh my God.

56:40.100 --> 56:44.900
You don't get to know how many, how many dark rituals I did today and they were dark, Chris.

56:44.900 --> 56:48.700
Google knows and the FBI is on their way, but yeah, you took a photo with your Android

56:48.700 --> 56:49.700
phone so they know.

56:49.700 --> 56:55.020
I took a photo of a hot dog and Google made a horrible, horrible mistake.

56:55.020 --> 56:56.660
That model needed a little more training.

56:56.660 --> 56:57.660
You know what?

56:57.660 --> 56:58.660
That's not funny.

56:58.660 --> 56:59.660
That poor bastard has, I'm sorry.

56:59.660 --> 57:00.660
I went backwards with that poor bastard.

57:00.660 --> 57:01.660
Wow.

57:01.660 --> 57:02.660
Yeah.

57:02.660 --> 57:03.660
I don't know.

57:03.660 --> 57:04.660
I think this kind of thing is the future.

57:04.660 --> 57:05.860
Like you asked me about Maui.

57:05.860 --> 57:10.820
Every time someone wants to bet against the web, they basically just get B slapped.

57:10.820 --> 57:11.820
Yeah.

57:11.820 --> 57:12.820
Why wouldn't it be the web?

57:12.820 --> 57:16.380
Didn't NASA just send up something that was, you know, like rust and C plus plus under

57:16.380 --> 57:19.580
the hood, but the front end was basically react JS.

57:19.580 --> 57:22.860
And when does the absolutely best technology win?

57:22.860 --> 57:25.180
You know, when does that happen?

57:25.180 --> 57:28.300
Like I'm not saying this web stuff isn't the best technology, but you might argue like

57:28.300 --> 57:30.740
the native applications using native controls.

57:30.740 --> 57:31.740
That's the best.

57:31.740 --> 57:35.980
It's okay for iOS users, but you know, when does that ever win?

57:35.980 --> 57:38.900
The general computing platform always wins.

57:38.900 --> 57:41.240
It always does because that's the one everybody can write to.

57:41.240 --> 57:42.660
It's the one everybody gets access to.

57:42.660 --> 57:44.500
It's the most accessible.

57:44.500 --> 57:46.940
It's the great, it's the great neutralizer.

57:46.940 --> 57:51.060
Well also like, you know, VHS beat beta, right?

57:51.060 --> 57:54.060
It's a little skewed and I'd be curious for people who are doing more consumer facing

57:54.060 --> 58:00.020
applications because in my little corner of the world, like double native, are you doing

58:00.020 --> 58:04.580
a Kotlin app or Java app and a, you know, I guess Swift could be Objective-C though

58:04.580 --> 58:08.460
app isn't going to happen.

58:08.460 --> 58:09.460
No one's paying.

58:09.460 --> 58:16.380
No, no project manager or product manager is going to authorize, you know, a six figure

58:16.380 --> 58:19.340
budget for their internal one app.

58:19.340 --> 58:22.940
They may authorize stuff like that for like an entire suite of apps with a backing, you

58:22.940 --> 58:27.340
know, backend service and databases and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

58:27.340 --> 58:28.340
I don't know.

58:28.340 --> 58:32.380
Like all of my customers are, you know, the non-Alice ones, right?

58:32.380 --> 58:34.260
The ones who are doing like mobile projects.

58:34.260 --> 58:38.300
It's all this web stuff, either that or it's like Xamarin.

58:38.300 --> 58:44.340
And I, and God damn it, Chris, just, you know, I'm already sad because, you know, I started

58:44.340 --> 58:47.340
the morning on Twitter, morning sun yet again.

58:47.340 --> 58:48.340
Oh yeah.

58:48.340 --> 58:49.340
Yeah.

58:49.340 --> 58:50.340
Yeah.

58:50.340 --> 58:53.580
You thought we'd get away with not mentioning the death of our dearly departed son, Sun

58:53.580 --> 58:54.580
Microsystems.

58:54.580 --> 58:58.700
I felt the need to correct that before I got the email or to be, Oh my God, your son died.

58:58.700 --> 59:04.900
No, not my son, the son, son, Java Duke.

59:04.900 --> 59:05.900
So I don't know.

59:05.900 --> 59:09.620
I'd be, I'd be curious to hear from you, those of you who are riding that Marco train and

59:09.620 --> 59:14.460
trying to do like a very tasteful, thoughtful direct to consumer apps.

59:14.460 --> 59:15.460
Does it have to be Swift?

59:15.460 --> 59:16.460
Does it have to be Kotlin?

59:16.460 --> 59:21.700
Although I've seen Android apps and you guys are not doing great.

59:21.700 --> 59:22.700
Can it be a web app?

59:22.700 --> 59:23.700
Am I wrong?

59:23.700 --> 59:29.060
Am I too deep in the dark matter developer, enterprising crap?

59:29.060 --> 59:30.060
I'd like to know.

59:30.060 --> 59:34.540
Coder dot show slash contact or boosted in with a new podcasting app.

59:34.540 --> 59:38.940
So let's get through a couple of these cause it's just about the end of the show.

59:38.940 --> 59:42.860
And so something that we're doing on the other shows, we'll eventually be doing it here on

59:42.860 --> 59:46.580
Coder too, as we've set a 2000 sat limit to get on the show.

59:46.580 --> 59:50.540
And then going forward, we may make further adjustments, but I wanted to say something

59:50.540 --> 59:56.540
really briefly, even though I know we're going kind of long, the boosts represent a fundamental

59:56.540 --> 01:00:00.060
paradigm shift for podcasting super quickly.

01:00:00.060 --> 01:00:04.420
If you're a YouTuber and you make content on YouTube that the algorithm likes and promotes,

01:00:04.420 --> 01:00:06.900
there's a built in path to revenue.

01:00:06.900 --> 01:00:11.860
It's a captured path where you're dancing for the algorithm, but there's a built in

01:00:11.860 --> 01:00:13.060
way to monetize.

01:00:13.060 --> 01:00:15.300
There's a model for YouTube.

01:00:15.300 --> 01:00:16.300
There's no model.

01:00:16.300 --> 01:00:18.260
There's no built in path for podcasting.

01:00:18.260 --> 01:00:22.900
So every podcaster comes up with their own bespoke approach to try to monetize and make

01:00:22.900 --> 01:00:25.900
revenue so that way they can do their passion.

01:00:25.900 --> 01:00:29.740
And whenever you get serious about something, you need to do it full time because of the

01:00:29.740 --> 01:00:31.580
amount of focus and attention it requires.

01:00:31.580 --> 01:00:37.220
And what you're seeing right now is podcasters are flocking to dynamically inserted ads.

01:00:37.220 --> 01:00:41.380
I got a note from Optimus Gray who said he was listening to an English spoken podcast

01:00:41.380 --> 01:00:45.260
and he got a dynamically inserted ad in Spanish and they're just never really a great fit

01:00:45.260 --> 01:00:46.260
for the show.

01:00:46.260 --> 01:00:52.580
We're also seeing a massive consolidation with Spotify, Apple, Google, and Libsyn who

01:00:52.580 --> 01:00:57.420
are trying to centralize podcast advertising and drive their rates way down, which is also

01:00:57.420 --> 01:00:59.940
going to starve the podcast industry.

01:00:59.940 --> 01:01:05.180
And podcasters are acquiescing to these pressures because there is no model to follow.

01:01:05.180 --> 01:01:08.180
There is no real light at the end of the tunnel.

01:01:08.180 --> 01:01:12.340
You have to create your business from whole cloth.

01:01:12.340 --> 01:01:18.020
And so the issue with all of these platforms, Libsyn, Spotify, Apple, Google, is the incentive

01:01:18.020 --> 01:01:22.620
is to please the platform provider and operator, their algorithm or whatever they have, not

01:01:22.620 --> 01:01:24.660
the audience.

01:01:24.660 --> 01:01:27.300
The audience isn't the customer.

01:01:27.300 --> 01:01:32.740
Boosts represent a fundamental shift for podcasting because it is a truly, and I mean truly on

01:01:32.740 --> 01:01:38.020
the technical sense, a truly decentralized no middleman network that's all based on free

01:01:38.020 --> 01:01:45.340
software that's built into the podcast app that specifically rewards the creator when

01:01:45.340 --> 01:01:49.300
they create something of value that the audience enjoys.

01:01:49.300 --> 01:01:54.700
So it's a fundamentally structured incentive system tilted towards the audience because

01:01:54.700 --> 01:01:58.100
the creator gets rewarded when the audience creates good content for them.

01:01:58.100 --> 01:02:04.180
Not for the algorithm, not for Spotify's front page, but for the audience.

01:02:04.180 --> 01:02:07.560
And Boosts represent the first time in 15 years of podcasting that there could actually

01:02:07.560 --> 01:02:12.140
be a built-in path to revenue for podcast that rewards content creators based on the

01:02:12.140 --> 01:02:22.560
quality of their content with no middlemen taking a skiff, tilting the wheels of content.

01:02:22.560 --> 01:02:24.220
It's a massive fundamental shift.

01:02:24.220 --> 01:02:28.620
So we are trying to figure out how to incorporate them in a way that doesn't like, you know,

01:02:28.620 --> 01:02:30.960
add 20 minutes to the show.

01:02:30.960 --> 01:02:37.700
But at the same time, they represent possibly a savior to the medium that is undergoing

01:02:37.700 --> 01:02:43.140
right now extreme centralization pressures that I don't go on about as much as I probably

01:02:43.140 --> 01:02:46.780
should because of the existential threat, but I know how much it drives everybody crazy

01:02:46.780 --> 01:02:48.940
and I just try to contain that in office hours.

01:02:48.940 --> 01:02:53.260
But that is the context in which we find ourselves in the Boost era.

01:02:53.260 --> 01:03:01.340
And so your support via memberships and your support via Boosts are building a pathway

01:03:01.340 --> 01:03:07.380
that I'm not even exaggerating, this is not overstating the situation, could literally

01:03:07.380 --> 01:03:10.220
save independent podcasting.

01:03:10.220 --> 01:03:13.160
So with that, let's read a couple of these before we get out of here.

01:03:13.160 --> 01:03:20.620
And I want to start with our over 9,000 Boost from Bronzewig.

01:03:20.620 --> 01:03:25.340
With 9001 sats Chris and Mike, I wonder what you guys think about this Android initiative

01:03:25.340 --> 01:03:27.540
and I took a look at it.

01:03:27.540 --> 01:03:34.500
And Google is going all in on green versus blue bubbles, they've produced a video to

01:03:34.500 --> 01:03:39.520
shame Apple even the green bubble versus the blue bubble.

01:03:39.520 --> 01:03:40.520
Why is this a thing?

01:03:40.520 --> 01:03:42.900
See, Apple uses SMS and MMS.

01:03:42.900 --> 01:03:45.020
You remember that technology from the 90s?

01:03:45.020 --> 01:03:48.460
Anytime their customers want to communicate with someone outside Apple sphere, limiting

01:03:48.460 --> 01:03:52.900
them to low res video, no encryption and no red receipts.

01:03:52.900 --> 01:03:56.840
You know that that old tech from the 90s and the whole thing.

01:03:56.840 --> 01:04:01.860
It's this whole this whole pitch to shame to have the the public shame Apple to fix

01:04:01.860 --> 01:04:03.300
their texting.

01:04:03.300 --> 01:04:08.940
Ironically, though, it seems to be backfiring a bit because people don't like RCS that have

01:04:08.940 --> 01:04:11.680
gotten it.

01:04:11.680 --> 01:04:12.680
This is dumb.

01:04:12.680 --> 01:04:17.300
I mean, you know, it's a competitive market.

01:04:17.300 --> 01:04:18.780
I message is really, really good.

01:04:18.780 --> 01:04:21.140
I know people don't like it when I say that.

01:04:21.140 --> 01:04:23.180
You know what I like about it?

01:04:23.180 --> 01:04:25.220
I message bypasses the carriers.

01:04:25.220 --> 01:04:28.020
Yep, that's what's good about it.

01:04:28.020 --> 01:04:29.020
That's why it's better.

01:04:29.020 --> 01:04:31.180
RCS is dependent on the carriers.

01:04:31.180 --> 01:04:33.100
And I'm sorry, I that's just not a solution.

01:04:33.100 --> 01:04:34.460
I think that's better for the market.

01:04:34.460 --> 01:04:39.060
Yeah, they're not the most innovative fast moving lot over there at the carriers.

01:04:39.060 --> 01:04:40.580
Yeah.

01:04:40.580 --> 01:04:41.580
So I don't know.

01:04:41.580 --> 01:04:42.580
I think this is sour grapes.

01:04:42.580 --> 01:04:44.220
I get why they're doing it.

01:04:44.220 --> 01:04:48.180
I message lock in and we've gotten the emails I don't want to jump into the whole blue green

01:04:48.180 --> 01:04:49.180
bubbles thing again.

01:04:49.180 --> 01:04:54.700
Yeah, you know, I message lock in a strong it's a problem because like I will be buying

01:04:54.700 --> 01:04:57.400
an iPhone every two years for the rest of my life now.

01:04:57.400 --> 01:04:58.400
I agree.

01:04:58.400 --> 01:05:02.580
And can I be ignorant now this next boost is to educate myself user 77 nine probably

01:05:02.580 --> 01:05:07.940
need to set your username and fountain they boosted in with 2022 sats and this is me being

01:05:07.940 --> 01:05:08.940
completely ignorant.

01:05:08.940 --> 01:05:13.980
I've never I've never used a computer sold out of the EU I've never used you know I don't

01:05:13.980 --> 01:05:16.060
know this but he says the EU is glorious.

01:05:16.060 --> 01:05:19.380
You get four spaces in Python two in JavaScript.

01:05:19.380 --> 01:05:23.780
Is there some is spacing done differently in the EU than it is in the States?

01:05:23.780 --> 01:05:26.420
Is this is this a thing?

01:05:26.420 --> 01:05:27.420
What is he talking about?

01:05:27.420 --> 01:05:31.140
I think he's just saying the EU is glorious because we kept dunking on it last week.

01:05:31.140 --> 01:05:32.140
You're right.

01:05:32.140 --> 01:05:33.620
They're two separate things.

01:05:33.620 --> 01:05:34.620
Two separate things.

01:05:34.620 --> 01:05:35.620
Okay.

01:05:35.620 --> 01:05:37.620
So you're Yeah, well you have to use Yeah.

01:05:37.620 --> 01:05:38.620
Okay.

01:05:38.620 --> 01:05:39.620
All right.

01:05:39.620 --> 01:05:40.620
Good on you.

01:05:40.620 --> 01:05:41.620
You should post your VM RC.

01:05:41.620 --> 01:05:43.260
I wasn't even gonna read the part about them.

01:05:43.260 --> 01:05:44.940
I'm so sick of hearing about them.

01:05:44.940 --> 01:05:48.780
So let's see Chris Chris is an e-max user.

01:05:48.780 --> 01:05:52.620
That's all that tells you one thing that hasn't come up and the whole VIM discussion.

01:05:52.620 --> 01:05:55.300
I don't think oh maybe it did but I'm just reiterating because I think this is the most

01:05:55.300 --> 01:05:56.300
important point.

01:05:56.300 --> 01:05:57.300
Don't do it.

01:05:57.300 --> 01:06:02.460
The value in learning VIM is those key bindings are everywhere.

01:06:02.460 --> 01:06:05.780
You know like our even our hedge doc our collaborative markdown.

01:06:05.780 --> 01:06:10.340
You can put it in you can put it in VIM mode and you can use the I key bindings to move

01:06:10.340 --> 01:06:12.480
around the dock.

01:06:12.480 --> 01:06:13.480
It's just everywhere.

01:06:13.480 --> 01:06:14.480
Right.

01:06:14.480 --> 01:06:15.480
It's like the M1 Mac.

01:06:15.480 --> 01:06:16.480
It's the obvious better product.

01:06:16.480 --> 01:06:17.480
Yeah.

01:06:17.480 --> 01:06:18.480
Okay.

01:06:18.480 --> 01:06:24.100
Oh Kyron aka lower third boosted in with a row of ducks.

01:06:24.100 --> 01:06:28.980
And he says following up on the we asked him remember he said it's a real Mario and Luigi

01:06:28.980 --> 01:06:32.620
situation which I forgot that I wanted to steal that and use that so this was a nice

01:06:32.620 --> 01:06:33.620
reminder.

01:06:33.620 --> 01:06:34.620
Nice.

01:06:34.620 --> 01:06:38.680
He says to try and describe what a Mario and Luigi situation would actually really put

01:06:38.680 --> 01:06:41.220
me in a real Mario and Luigi situation.

01:06:41.220 --> 01:06:43.620
It's not nefarious but it sure is something.

01:06:43.620 --> 01:06:45.260
Keep up the good work.

01:06:45.260 --> 01:06:51.160
And here is an honorable mention for Sun Microsystems and Java Duke gone but never forgotten.

01:06:51.160 --> 01:06:52.220
Certainly not on this show.

01:06:52.220 --> 01:06:53.220
Every week.

01:06:53.220 --> 01:06:54.220
We're we're more.

01:06:54.220 --> 01:06:55.220
Yeah.

01:06:55.220 --> 01:06:57.660
We're keeping it alive man.

01:06:57.660 --> 01:06:58.660
We're keeping it alive.

01:06:58.660 --> 01:06:59.660
All right.

01:06:59.660 --> 01:07:07.420
And then a baller here in our parts CB boosted in on like a boosting rampage that I'm a big

01:07:07.420 --> 01:07:13.820
fan of with forty three thousand seven hundred and seventy sats because I'm a back home baller

01:07:13.820 --> 01:07:15.380
if I want something I just holler.

01:07:15.380 --> 01:07:19.240
He says several months ago the company I've worked for had completely stalled out.

01:07:19.240 --> 01:07:23.060
There was no sales no money coming in and no paycheck.

01:07:23.060 --> 01:07:27.060
I've worked at this job for nearly a decade as a senior lead developer for the last five

01:07:27.060 --> 01:07:28.860
years.

01:07:28.860 --> 01:07:32.700
In that time I managed to exercise everything Microsoft from the company.

01:07:32.700 --> 01:07:36.820
The previous senior dev had written a good portion of the software in C sharp targeting

01:07:36.820 --> 01:07:40.900
Windows which is crazy when you realize we make computer vision based software.

01:07:40.900 --> 01:07:45.160
So I got rid of everything Microsoft 100 percent Linux after I was done.

01:07:45.160 --> 01:07:49.420
He continues with another five thousand seven hundred and fourteen sats.

01:07:49.420 --> 01:07:54.900
So I'm now out of a job been firing off my CV like mad with zero replies.

01:07:54.900 --> 01:07:59.660
I took Mike's advice for a few months and I kind of took a grassroots approach contacted

01:07:59.660 --> 01:08:00.660
local companies.

01:08:00.660 --> 01:08:02.700
I got me a few interviews but no job.

01:08:02.700 --> 01:08:03.700
All right.

01:08:03.700 --> 01:08:05.820
Well that's that's some good progress right there.

01:08:05.820 --> 01:08:07.500
I like that that's the Mike recommendation.

01:08:07.500 --> 01:08:08.700
I completely agree with that.

01:08:08.700 --> 01:08:10.240
Go go with the local companies.

01:08:10.240 --> 01:08:11.240
Start there.

01:08:11.240 --> 01:08:12.240
Yeah.

01:08:12.240 --> 01:08:15.060
He says the only company that gave me an offer is a pure Microsoft shop.

01:08:15.060 --> 01:08:22.460
I'm talking Windows, Teams, Outlook, Visual Studio, Sharp, Azure, Azure DevOps.

01:08:22.460 --> 01:08:25.460
I had a minor extensional crisis when I found all this out.

01:08:25.460 --> 01:08:34.140
Did I commit some sort of genocide in a past life to deserve this?

01:08:34.140 --> 01:08:36.220
I'm also surprised I didn't get any other offers.

01:08:36.220 --> 01:08:40.700
I feel as though there's only a few senior roles available but I'm quote overqualified

01:08:40.700 --> 01:08:42.380
for most regular dev roles.

01:08:42.380 --> 01:08:43.700
We just had our boy.

01:08:43.700 --> 01:08:47.140
My wife is out on maternity leave so it's the worst possible time to be without income.

01:08:47.140 --> 01:08:51.180
I have a job now but with a huge Microsoft catch.

01:08:51.180 --> 01:08:52.980
I guess this is a challenge to my ideals.

01:08:52.980 --> 01:08:55.420
Do you stand your ground or do you feed your family?

01:08:55.420 --> 01:08:58.140
Well I'm feeding my family but at least I use Linux at home.

01:08:58.140 --> 01:09:04.120
You know I think CB, God I know this is easy for me to say but if I was in your position

01:09:04.120 --> 01:09:09.540
I think I would try to take this as an opportunity to just live the Microsoft life for a while.

01:09:09.540 --> 01:09:14.820
When I was acquired by Linux Academy, can you imagine that change from going from like

01:09:14.820 --> 01:09:20.620
a small team of four or five in a tiny little small LLC to then joining a company of hundreds

01:09:20.620 --> 01:09:25.300
of people that had VC funding that was growing like crazy and so I had to just have a mind

01:09:25.300 --> 01:09:26.300
shift.

01:09:26.300 --> 01:09:31.340
I went this isn't what I envisioned but this is also an opportunity for me to get reacquainted

01:09:31.340 --> 01:09:38.060
with this world and I learned so much with that mindset and I think I'm better at the

01:09:38.060 --> 01:09:42.200
independent thing now because of it just like I think you might be better at the Linux thing

01:09:42.200 --> 01:09:45.580
after you've really lived the other way for a while so you truly understand what it's

01:09:45.580 --> 01:09:49.220
good and bad at and then you can approach it from a real honest angle which is really

01:09:49.220 --> 01:09:50.620
what's going to be valuable in the market.

01:09:50.620 --> 01:09:54.220
For sure yeah and congrats on the baby boy.

01:09:54.220 --> 01:09:59.820
The other thing is if you actually do this for a couple years you can now pitch yourself

01:09:59.820 --> 01:10:05.900
to whatever your next gig is your next job is as I'm a Microsoft expert I'm a Linux expert

01:10:05.900 --> 01:10:12.380
and you can basically be the guy who can bridge those two worlds and there are a lot of places

01:10:12.380 --> 01:10:17.660
because Microsoft is just giving you those Azure credits man they're just the first 20

01:10:17.660 --> 01:10:18.940
hits are free.

01:10:18.940 --> 01:10:25.140
I have a feeling if you can just meditate on you know the glory that is vBasic I know

01:10:25.140 --> 01:10:31.820
you're doing C sharp but I thought it was funny for a couple years you're probably going

01:10:31.820 --> 01:10:35.180
to be in a super strong position and you're plus your little boy is going to need a lot

01:10:35.180 --> 01:10:36.180
of food.

01:10:36.180 --> 01:10:38.580
Yeah they get they just eat more they just eat more and more.

01:10:38.580 --> 01:10:43.780
And my understanding of as a divorce man I can tell you wives do not like it when there's

01:10:43.780 --> 01:10:44.780
no money.

01:10:44.780 --> 01:10:50.620
That's true too that is that is also true CB had to also come in with 2000 sats just

01:10:50.620 --> 01:10:51.620
to kind of.

01:10:51.620 --> 01:10:52.620
This is where it loses me.

01:10:52.620 --> 01:10:53.620
Yeah.

01:10:53.620 --> 01:10:59.380
I want to give my thoughts on Orville I think it does well because it is a TNG clone every

01:10:59.380 --> 01:11:04.540
other new show nowadays is always trying to be like the big reveal a big twist generate

01:11:04.540 --> 01:11:08.540
social media buzz drive engagement etc.

01:11:08.540 --> 01:11:12.700
The Orville is predictable straightforward cookie cutter based stories and I love it.

01:11:12.700 --> 01:11:16.420
It's bright it's colorful the characters the characters are passionate and positive and

01:11:16.420 --> 01:11:17.420
look out for each other.

01:11:17.420 --> 01:11:19.420
They get excited about things like first contact.

01:11:19.420 --> 01:11:23.420
I agree with some of that I saw this boost last night when I was preparing the show and

01:11:23.420 --> 01:11:26.460
I thought all right honey let's watch some Orville.

01:11:26.460 --> 01:11:34.780
And so I watched the episode where their federation is trying to strike an alliance with a patriarchal

01:11:34.780 --> 01:11:37.020
arcal society that hates men.

01:11:37.020 --> 01:11:42.580
And so they have the captain and all of the men pretend like they just do grunt work.

01:11:42.580 --> 01:11:48.420
And so for 45 minutes of the show they lie to this other species about the role of men

01:11:48.420 --> 01:11:52.780
in there in the human society and the entire time you're just smacking your forehead going

01:11:52.780 --> 01:11:53.780
why are they lying to them.

01:11:53.780 --> 01:11:57.180
How is this treaty treaty going to work if they sign the treaty and then there's a big

01:11:57.180 --> 01:12:01.660
reveal that surprise actually men have a role in society.

01:12:01.660 --> 01:12:02.660
How is this going to work.

01:12:02.660 --> 01:12:05.100
And I'm just the entire time like this doesn't make any sense.

01:12:05.100 --> 01:12:06.640
This is clearly not going to work.

01:12:06.640 --> 01:12:09.880
And now that episode still has really good moments in it.

01:12:09.880 --> 01:12:14.500
But every single time I watch the Orville I go to my I'm saying out loud like this doesn't

01:12:14.500 --> 01:12:20.740
make any sense or like they do things that are really kind of dark like the doctor pressures

01:12:20.740 --> 01:12:23.660
the robot into changing himself and it's twisted.

01:12:23.660 --> 01:12:27.880
And it's like if you take yourself out of the character it's it's a twisted dark thing

01:12:27.880 --> 01:12:28.880
to watch.

01:12:28.880 --> 01:12:31.580
I'm just constantly I have that experience when I watch the Orville.

01:12:31.580 --> 01:12:32.700
I have yet to watch it.

01:12:32.700 --> 01:12:38.660
I did watch I started to watch the first episode seemed OK but I will put this on my list.

01:12:38.660 --> 01:12:41.140
I mean I'm watching it slowly.

01:12:41.140 --> 01:12:47.620
It is there are I say also good moments in the show and as the seasons go on it gets

01:12:47.620 --> 01:12:48.980
better.

01:12:48.980 --> 01:12:51.560
Every time with the Orville the first few episodes of the season I'm a little shaky

01:12:51.560 --> 01:12:54.940
on and by the end of the season I'm like oh I'd like some more of that.

01:12:54.940 --> 01:12:58.580
That's how it goes every single time we're discovery it's the opposite first couple episodes

01:12:58.580 --> 01:12:59.580
of the season.

01:12:59.580 --> 01:13:03.640
I'm like OK you got me midway or by the end I'm like this damn show.

01:13:03.640 --> 01:13:05.620
These were who the hell writes this thing right.

01:13:05.620 --> 01:13:06.620
They lose me.

01:13:06.620 --> 01:13:11.420
So at least it has that he goes on to CB goes on to say with another 2001 sets the Orville

01:13:11.420 --> 01:13:15.860
isn't perfect but it was the best until strange new worlds came along.

01:13:15.860 --> 01:13:17.980
I like both shows and that's allowed right.

01:13:17.980 --> 01:13:20.460
Yeah I think that is allowed.

01:13:20.460 --> 01:13:26.380
And then our last boost just came in from George or banks with four thousand four hundred

01:13:26.380 --> 01:13:27.700
and forty four sets.

01:13:27.700 --> 01:13:28.700
Here's how it goes.

01:13:28.700 --> 01:13:31.820
Hey hey hey you've got to pay more stats if you're going to infringe on my copyright.

01:13:31.820 --> 01:13:32.820
I know right.

01:13:32.820 --> 01:13:33.820
Hey I know.

01:13:33.820 --> 01:13:36.860
Actually George or is pretty funny too is pretty good though I like it.

01:13:36.860 --> 01:13:39.100
Star Wars then the Orville then Star Trek.

01:13:39.100 --> 01:13:40.100
Fight me Trekkies.

01:13:40.100 --> 01:13:41.100
Yeah.

01:13:41.100 --> 01:13:42.100
I like that.

01:13:42.100 --> 01:13:43.100
I would reverse that.

01:13:43.100 --> 01:13:44.100
I would reverse that.

01:13:44.100 --> 01:13:45.100
What are you doing.

01:13:45.100 --> 01:13:46.100
You got a minute.

01:13:46.100 --> 01:13:51.460
I'm going to take this guy Mr. Quackers boosted with a row of ducks saying thanks.

01:13:51.460 --> 01:13:56.340
Cospe and also boosted in and asked if we've tried to Google's GitHub alternative which

01:13:56.340 --> 01:14:02.860
I have to admit I have no because they're going to kill my next show bother or like

01:14:02.860 --> 01:14:03.860
to.

01:14:03.860 --> 01:14:04.860
Yeah.

01:14:04.860 --> 01:14:05.940
Or they'll have me arrested for writing some book.

01:14:05.940 --> 01:14:06.940
I don't know.

01:14:06.940 --> 01:14:07.940
Oh yeah.

01:14:07.940 --> 01:14:08.940
That's the dark twist now.

01:14:08.940 --> 01:14:12.760
There's always that you're you know you take the wrong picture and oh God I would get so

01:14:12.760 --> 01:14:15.960
screwed if my business account got actually because I know you put this on YouTube.

01:14:15.960 --> 01:14:20.940
It was totally the right decision to kill ways and reader and I apologize for ever criticizing

01:14:20.940 --> 01:14:21.940
Google.

01:14:21.940 --> 01:14:22.940
Oh no.

01:14:22.940 --> 01:14:23.940
Oh God.

01:14:23.940 --> 01:14:24.940
I hope they don't kill ways.

01:14:24.940 --> 01:14:25.940
Don't say that.

01:14:25.940 --> 01:14:26.940
They already killed ways.

01:14:26.940 --> 01:14:27.940
No.

01:14:27.940 --> 01:14:28.940
Oh I'm thinking wave.

01:14:28.940 --> 01:14:29.940
It's so dead.

01:14:29.940 --> 01:14:30.940
I can't remember the name anymore.

01:14:30.940 --> 01:14:31.940
Yeah.

01:14:31.940 --> 01:14:35.720
The traumas inflicted on us by a company that pretends to be a kindergarten but is really

01:14:35.720 --> 01:14:38.140
a billion multi-billion dollar behemoth.

01:14:38.140 --> 01:14:41.500
But they've got rainbow colors in their logo.

01:14:41.500 --> 01:14:44.840
And there'll be really nice to you if they invite you to their Chelsea office and let

01:14:44.840 --> 01:14:48.580
you play with Legos and give you lots and lots of coffee.

01:14:48.580 --> 01:14:55.140
They put socially accurate and I'd say prescient art on their website.

01:14:55.140 --> 01:14:57.300
So they've got to be good.

01:14:57.300 --> 01:15:02.940
By the way my new TV is a Google TV and I'm very aware that it is definitely listening

01:15:02.940 --> 01:15:06.660
to my son be extremely aggressive in Mario Tennis.

01:15:06.660 --> 01:15:07.660
All right.

01:15:07.660 --> 01:15:12.100
If you'd like to send us a boost go get a new podcast app at newpodcastapps.com.

01:15:12.100 --> 01:15:13.140
I like Fountain.

01:15:13.140 --> 01:15:16.660
They're building in Podverse into our website.

01:15:16.660 --> 01:15:17.660
It's great.

01:15:17.660 --> 01:15:19.780
Castamatic is fantastic as well.

01:15:19.780 --> 01:15:20.780
They all work.

01:15:20.780 --> 01:15:21.780
You just need one.

01:15:21.780 --> 01:15:25.740
You can also just grab Breeze and not even not even switch podcast apps.

01:15:25.740 --> 01:15:29.540
It's all listed newpodcastapps.com.

01:15:29.540 --> 01:15:32.460
Mr. Dominic is there anywhere you'd like to send the good people before it gets?

01:15:32.460 --> 01:15:33.460
Of course.

01:15:33.460 --> 01:15:37.140
I'd like to send everyone to at Duminico on Twitter and for George Roribinx may the light

01:15:37.140 --> 01:15:39.780
of Kalish sends you on a better path.

01:15:39.780 --> 01:15:40.780
Yeah.

01:15:40.780 --> 01:15:41.780
You know what.

01:15:41.780 --> 01:15:45.780
I like invoking the name of Kalish on people upon people right.

01:15:45.780 --> 01:15:48.580
It works really well at the bank too.

01:15:48.580 --> 01:15:49.580
They love it.

01:15:49.580 --> 01:15:53.500
Well the wrath of Kalish be upon your head and your family.

01:15:53.500 --> 01:15:55.500
Sir this is a Wendy's.

01:15:55.500 --> 01:15:56.500
All right.
