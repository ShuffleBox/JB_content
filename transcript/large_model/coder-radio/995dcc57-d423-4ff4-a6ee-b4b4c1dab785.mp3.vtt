00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
This is KOTORadio episode 300 for March 15, 2018.

00:31.000 --> 00:35.000
Hi everyone, and welcome to KOTORadio, Jupiter Broadcasting's weekly talk show, taking a

00:35.000 --> 00:39.360
pragmatic look at the art and business of software development and its related technologies.

00:39.360 --> 00:44.880
This episode is brought to you by our two fine sponsors, DigitalOcean and Linux Academy.

00:44.880 --> 00:48.360
We'll tell you more about those great sponsors as this here show goes on.

00:48.360 --> 00:57.200
My name is Chris, and joining us for an unbelievable 300 weeks, it's our host, Mr. Michael Dominic.

00:57.200 --> 00:58.200
Hello, Mike.

00:58.200 --> 01:00.200
300 weeks of power!

01:00.200 --> 01:06.360
Jeez, it is, it is, it's kind of amazing when you say that, it sounds so, so unbelievable.

01:06.360 --> 01:09.000
It's really kind of hard to even wrap our head around.

01:09.000 --> 01:14.760
So we got a bunch of really fun stuff we're going to announce to celebrate episode 300.

01:14.760 --> 01:19.280
We thought we were going to do nothing, and then it really turned into a whole team effort,

01:19.280 --> 01:24.160
a bunch of, a bunch of really great work by Angela, Mike and I got some secret plans going

01:24.160 --> 01:29.120
behind the scenes, and it resulted in, well, a hell of a bang for the, for 300.

01:29.120 --> 01:32.720
I'm like, I'm like shocked because we went from like almost nothing when I left for scale

01:32.720 --> 01:34.400
to heck of a show.

01:34.400 --> 01:35.400
But it's good to be back.

01:35.400 --> 01:38.680
We waited till Thursday to do KOTORadio 300 so that way I could be in studio.

01:38.680 --> 01:42.440
So I've returned from the California area and I survived, Mike.

01:42.440 --> 01:44.760
I survived their weird gas pumps.

01:44.760 --> 01:47.680
You have never pumped gas until you pumped gas in California.

01:47.680 --> 01:48.680
Let me tell you.

01:48.680 --> 01:49.680
Wait, the pump, the pump is different?

01:49.680 --> 01:53.480
Yeah, man, they got these low vape nozzle headers that they've retrofitted all of the

01:53.480 --> 01:58.120
pumps with and they've also removed like the little latch where you can lock the handle

01:58.120 --> 01:59.440
down so it just keeps pumping.

01:59.440 --> 02:00.440
What the hell?

02:00.440 --> 02:02.000
Yeah, well, here's the best part.

02:02.000 --> 02:06.780
So Ford's have this really great feature that they added to their cars a few years ago where

02:06.780 --> 02:08.160
there's no gas cap.

02:08.160 --> 02:13.020
It's a capless gas system and it has a little door that opens and closes and it's great.

02:13.020 --> 02:18.320
No more gas cap to touch, no more stinky fingers, but it doesn't play well with California's

02:18.320 --> 02:22.040
low vape nozzle retrofit.

02:22.040 --> 02:28.560
And I'm basing this on the fact that we had two Ford rentals that both experienced this

02:28.560 --> 02:29.560
problem.

02:29.560 --> 02:33.040
And it was one of these things where the thing would pop every five seconds.

02:33.040 --> 02:34.760
It'd take 20 minutes to fill your vehicle.

02:34.760 --> 02:35.760
So I had to get the hell out of there.

02:35.760 --> 02:41.160
Had to come back here, get in studio so that way we could do 300 in studio.

02:41.160 --> 02:42.160
How are you doing?

02:42.160 --> 02:43.160
That's a lot about me.

02:43.160 --> 02:44.640
How have you been doing, Mike?

02:44.640 --> 02:45.640
How are you doing?

02:45.640 --> 02:46.640
You know what?

02:46.640 --> 02:50.400
You know, I was reflecting because, you know, 300 episodes is a lot, right?

02:50.400 --> 02:54.400
Like I was reflecting on what have we learned in 300 episodes?

02:54.400 --> 02:57.200
And you know what I think we've both learned?

02:57.200 --> 02:58.200
We hate California.

02:58.200 --> 03:04.800
Yeah, we're going to, we're going to have to, because we've never gotten that email.

03:04.800 --> 03:08.320
You know, we are going to have to do some reflection later on in the show, but why don't

03:08.320 --> 03:11.140
we start out with an email as we do here on the program.

03:11.140 --> 03:12.140
We like to do that.

03:12.140 --> 03:13.140
I love it.

03:13.140 --> 03:16.380
And this first one comes in from Noah, not Noah Chalaya, a different Noah.

03:16.380 --> 03:20.240
And he has a question about side projects, maybe hurting him more than helping him.

03:20.240 --> 03:22.280
Because guys have been, been a big fan listening for years.

03:22.280 --> 03:23.720
I have a question.

03:23.720 --> 03:26.440
Is there such a thing as a bad side project?

03:26.440 --> 03:31.600
I'm a web dev by day and I work on Django and Angular, those types of things.

03:31.600 --> 03:37.040
But recently I've been really interested in making my own video game just for fun.

03:37.040 --> 03:42.000
My concern is that video games are typically made in one of like the C languages, like

03:42.000 --> 03:46.960
C or C plus plus, maybe even C sharp, which is not something I've ever used and it's not

03:46.960 --> 03:48.360
something I use at work.

03:48.360 --> 03:54.880
Would you guys think that this would be a, would you guys think that this would be bad,

03:54.880 --> 04:00.400
would look bad to my employer if I ever tried to put it on my resume for a potential future

04:00.400 --> 04:03.840
job or if my employer were to ask about a side project?

04:03.840 --> 04:08.220
I fear that I may interpret that, I fear that they would interpret that.

04:08.220 --> 04:11.920
I am not passionate about web development, which I am.

04:11.920 --> 04:12.960
What do you guys think?

04:12.960 --> 04:18.000
Is this no big deal or could it hurt me further down in my career?

04:18.000 --> 04:23.120
It's a tough, I see where he's going because you know, we've talked about this in different

04:23.120 --> 04:27.560
approaches like sometimes when you go down something and you experiment with a different

04:27.560 --> 04:30.740
language than you typically work with, you learn something that makes you better at your

04:30.740 --> 04:31.740
core job.

04:31.740 --> 04:34.200
But what do you think?

04:34.200 --> 04:39.200
I mean, I, first of all, who hasn't been seduced by the desire to think you're going to write

04:39.200 --> 04:40.680
a video game in a few months?

04:40.680 --> 04:41.680
Oh yeah.

04:41.680 --> 04:48.960
Because it's, I don't, you know, as someone who is an employer and does that kind of thing,

04:48.960 --> 04:49.960
right?

04:49.960 --> 04:50.960
Yeah.

04:50.960 --> 04:51.960
I certainly don't see that as a negative.

04:51.960 --> 04:56.480
I might, what I might do is I might ask you, okay, so you made a game on the side.

04:56.480 --> 04:57.480
That's awesome.

04:57.480 --> 05:03.120
Tell me what, what you picked technology wise and methodology wise and why did you pick

05:03.120 --> 05:04.120
it?

05:04.120 --> 05:05.360
Just I'll treat it like any other job, right?

05:05.360 --> 05:10.720
Any other, whether it was a client project that you had as a freelancer or in fact, in

05:10.720 --> 05:15.920
a lot of ways I think it's a good thing because if it's your side project, you're making all

05:15.920 --> 05:19.080
those decisions that really can influence, you know, the work I'm going to have you be

05:19.080 --> 05:20.080
doing right.

05:20.080 --> 05:21.080
So yeah, that's true.

05:21.080 --> 05:22.080
Yeah.

05:22.080 --> 05:23.080
That's a good point.

05:23.080 --> 05:27.880
And also if you couldn't tell me, if you couldn't tell me like reasonable answers to why you

05:27.880 --> 05:29.740
did things and yeah, that would be bad.

05:29.740 --> 05:34.440
You're also exercising a learning muscle that you don't get a lot of use out of once you

05:34.440 --> 05:38.840
become really comfortable with something and it's a good skill to keep fresh and it's a

05:38.840 --> 05:44.200
way to keep something fresh, sort of like just sort of incubating something.

05:44.200 --> 05:46.360
Keep that going while you still focus on your main thing.

05:46.360 --> 05:50.760
I don't think there's anything bad about it because it's really going to come down to

05:50.760 --> 05:56.040
the results and how you balance your focus and your commitments.

05:56.040 --> 05:59.400
And as long as you continue to do that correctly and deliver on your commitments as far as

05:59.400 --> 06:01.320
they're concerned, I don't think you're going to have any problem.

06:01.320 --> 06:04.280
It's a net positive as far as they're concerned, I'm sure.

06:04.280 --> 06:09.560
Now there's a lot there's a lot we could talk about this week, including that calendar app

06:09.560 --> 06:11.080
that was mining cryptocurrency.

06:11.080 --> 06:13.240
It's a new kind of shareware.

06:13.240 --> 06:17.600
But let's take a moment and let's talk about the Coder Radio Super Show, which we are doing

06:17.600 --> 06:19.400
today on the program.

06:19.400 --> 06:22.360
Now here's a little here's a little fact for you.

06:22.360 --> 06:28.360
First episode of Coder Radio was released on June 11th, 2012.

06:28.360 --> 06:31.320
Now to put that in perspective, because it's like, wow, that does seem like a long time

06:31.320 --> 06:32.320
ago.

06:32.320 --> 06:34.360
What was going on that year around that time?

06:34.360 --> 06:40.720
The Mars Curiosity rover landed on Mars, Obama was reelected for a second term, Eric Holder

06:40.720 --> 06:45.880
was held in contempt of Congress, the world was supposed to end on December 21st, stupid

06:45.880 --> 06:49.760
Mayan calendar, and the space shuttle Endeavor had its final flight.

06:49.760 --> 06:52.960
Microsoft also released Windows 8 that year.

06:52.960 --> 06:57.080
And Instagram finally released a version for Android in 2012.

06:57.080 --> 07:01.480
And of course, the big one, Facebook went public that year with initial stock offering

07:01.480 --> 07:04.680
that was $38 per share.

07:04.680 --> 07:07.240
That was what those are some of the things that were going on the year that we launched

07:07.240 --> 07:11.800
kind of puts in perspective how long ago it was Obama getting reelected.

07:11.800 --> 07:14.160
Oh, such simpler times.

07:14.160 --> 07:18.400
And now different times back when we had a space shuttle and Windows 8 Oh, what a train

07:18.400 --> 07:22.080
wreck that was feels like Windows 8 was longer ago.

07:22.080 --> 07:24.840
They really Wow, they pulled out Windows 10.

07:24.840 --> 07:27.800
We watched all of that we watched the train wreck of Windows 8.

07:27.800 --> 07:31.440
The RT stuff because you Metro Yeah, because the whole debacle.

07:31.440 --> 07:36.040
Yeah, that release of Windows 8 really is them trying to do Metro the single sync right

07:36.040 --> 07:37.960
once run across all their platforms.

07:37.960 --> 07:42.120
That was big when we launched the show was really big.

07:42.120 --> 07:43.220
So much has changed.

07:43.220 --> 07:50.200
So after 300 weeks, and many, many, many, many, many, many days, we thought it was time

07:50.200 --> 07:52.520
to upgrade the show.

07:52.520 --> 07:57.880
So we're adding new features to your code radio program at the same great free cost.

07:57.880 --> 08:03.560
Some stuff that you won't even notice, except for maybe a few very eagle eyed listeners.

08:03.560 --> 08:07.520
We've totally reworked the back end for code radio starting with this episode.

08:07.520 --> 08:10.120
So assuming it goes out, the new back end works.

08:10.120 --> 08:11.820
It's way faster.

08:11.820 --> 08:17.040
It's based on industry best practices, which allows us to do really cool things like publish

08:17.040 --> 08:21.080
the code radio program to Spotify now.

08:21.080 --> 08:27.520
And utilizes the cash fly CDN to distribute the downloads crazy fast.

08:27.520 --> 08:29.920
Really as fast as you can slam them on your device.

08:29.920 --> 08:33.360
So if you fire up your podcast app on your mobile, when you're running out the door and

08:33.360 --> 08:36.760
you've only got 30 seconds of Wi Fi before you're pulling out of the driveway, you're

08:36.760 --> 08:38.160
going to get the code radio program.

08:38.160 --> 08:39.160
I'm all about that.

08:39.160 --> 08:40.160
It's really great.

08:40.160 --> 08:41.760
I'm super stoked about that.

08:41.760 --> 08:45.560
We also have a new RSS feed for the program.

08:45.560 --> 08:47.580
This is important.

08:47.580 --> 08:48.580
And you can get it directly.

08:48.580 --> 08:52.360
You can enter it directly into your RSS catcher of choice.

08:52.360 --> 08:59.120
It's coder dot show slash RSS coder dot show slash RSS.

08:59.120 --> 09:03.200
If you want to select from like overcast or pocket cast or look at our different options

09:03.200 --> 09:08.200
as we add them, you can go to coder dot show slash subscribe for all the different ways

09:08.200 --> 09:10.460
to subscribe to the weekly show.

09:10.460 --> 09:15.700
Now with the new RSS feed, and I am forwarding the old feed, but you may want to just resub

09:15.700 --> 09:17.280
to make sure you're getting it directly.

09:17.280 --> 09:21.220
But with the new RSS feed, we're going to address some long standing requests for the

09:21.220 --> 09:23.040
code radio program.

09:23.040 --> 09:27.440
We're going to include links in the RSS feed for all the stuff we talk about, including

09:27.440 --> 09:29.440
on mobile podcast clients.

09:29.440 --> 09:35.220
Because our current infrastructure can only deliver the description and the embed link.

09:35.220 --> 09:39.920
It cannot distribute the HTML link structured properly in a way that isn't devastatingly

09:39.920 --> 09:41.780
ugly.

09:41.780 --> 09:42.940
But the new feed will.

09:42.940 --> 09:48.580
So you will now get links in your mobile apps and on your desktop podcast or wherever you're

09:48.580 --> 09:55.480
grabbing them, and we'll also have a new contact page, which is I'm hoping a little bit easier

09:55.480 --> 10:00.560
to fill out and also flags them specifically in my inbox as coder radio listener feedback.

10:00.560 --> 10:04.620
So now it's like I got these areas that will just bring your emails right up.

10:04.620 --> 10:08.900
So Monday morning or whatever day we're doing the show, I go into this folder and bam, there's

10:08.900 --> 10:09.900
all your feedback.

10:09.900 --> 10:12.260
It's all been pre categorized, pre labeled.

10:12.260 --> 10:14.320
You get that at coder dot show slash contact.

10:14.320 --> 10:16.480
So it's a new contact page.

10:16.480 --> 10:19.420
If you're not guessing, we have a new site coder dot show and all this stuff is linked

10:19.420 --> 10:21.100
there.

10:21.100 --> 10:27.020
And as part of this new transition, I feel like Coder radio deserves a doubling down

10:27.020 --> 10:28.780
on investment from Jupiter broadcasting.

10:28.780 --> 10:30.780
That's why we're redoing the back end.

10:30.780 --> 10:35.420
And the other the other thing that we're going to change is at least for a little while,

10:35.420 --> 10:39.500
I am personally going to take over the editing on the show.

10:39.500 --> 10:43.460
And I have a goal of incremental improvements to our sound.

10:43.460 --> 10:45.980
Hopefully you'll begin to notice it over the next couple of weeks.

10:45.980 --> 10:47.140
Then we're just going to keep iterating.

10:47.140 --> 10:48.740
It's going to be a process.

10:48.740 --> 10:54.580
And as part of my editing, I'm going to start including chapter markers in the MP3 file.

10:54.580 --> 10:59.600
So if you're sick of us talking about hardware or sick of us talking about Apple or apps

10:59.600 --> 11:03.220
or whatever it is, whatever the particular discussion is that always triggers you, you

11:03.220 --> 11:07.260
can now skip over that entire section with one tap to the next topic.

11:07.260 --> 11:12.420
It'll be all bookmarked in the MP3 and you'll just need a podcast catcher that supports

11:12.420 --> 11:13.780
chapter markers.

11:13.780 --> 11:16.140
No more complaints, no more concerns.

11:16.140 --> 11:19.660
We can talk about what we want and you guys can skip right over it and we'll know.

11:19.660 --> 11:20.660
We'll know too.

11:20.660 --> 11:21.660
So we're able to see what people are skipping.

11:21.660 --> 11:24.780
It depends on the podcast catcher, but we actually get some data on that and it'll help

11:24.780 --> 11:25.780
make the show better.

11:25.780 --> 11:29.340
It depends on the like I say the player, but we do get some data on that.

11:29.340 --> 11:32.180
And one of the things we're also going to do is standardize the way you get to all the

11:32.180 --> 11:33.180
show notes.

11:33.180 --> 11:34.420
We're going to make it dead simple with the new site.

11:34.420 --> 11:39.420
So you go to coder.show slash episode number and that's it.

11:39.420 --> 11:41.220
You want links for everything we talked about today?

11:41.220 --> 11:43.620
Coder.show slash 300.

11:43.620 --> 11:44.620
Can be simpler.

11:44.620 --> 11:45.620
Coder.show slash 301.

11:45.620 --> 11:49.140
You know, it's just a slash episode number.

11:49.140 --> 11:50.500
You get the links, you get the download.

11:50.500 --> 11:52.700
You can send time coded links from there.

11:52.700 --> 11:56.820
So if Mike said something crazy about Rust, you can go right to that coder.show slash

11:56.820 --> 11:57.960
300.

11:57.960 --> 12:01.340
You can find the link with time code and you can send people time coded links to the Coder

12:01.340 --> 12:03.800
Radio program now.

12:03.800 --> 12:11.140
So it's coder.show for the new site, coder.show slash RSS to plug directly into your RSS client.

12:11.140 --> 12:16.020
Coder.show slash subscribe for all of the different links just on a web page for subscribing.

12:16.020 --> 12:18.780
And coder.show slash contact for the ways to get in contact.

12:18.780 --> 12:23.560
The secret is just go to coder.show, get the new feed, engage in the new contact form.

12:23.560 --> 12:25.380
It's all going to be totally revamped.

12:25.380 --> 12:28.660
And for those of you that are on mobile listening on Podcast Catchers, which is our number one

12:28.660 --> 12:32.980
demographic now, wasn't when the show necessarily started, I don't even know if that was a thing,

12:32.980 --> 12:33.980
but it is now.

12:33.980 --> 12:37.280
And so it's time for the Coder Radio to sort of modernize a little bit.

12:37.280 --> 12:40.660
So we're going to start doing multi-track audio recording and editing.

12:40.660 --> 12:43.080
We're going to start publishing all of our links in the mobile client.

12:43.080 --> 12:46.220
So that way when you're on your podcast listening device, whatever it might be, for me, it's

12:46.220 --> 12:47.220
overcast.

12:47.220 --> 12:51.260
A lot of you love Pocket Casts, I hear about antenna pod and player.fm and all kinds of

12:51.260 --> 12:52.660
other podcast clients.

12:52.660 --> 12:54.700
Now that's going to be a first class experience.

12:54.700 --> 12:57.400
You're going to get chapter markers, you're going to get links, it's going to blast down

12:57.400 --> 13:00.140
on your device as fast as freaking possible.

13:00.140 --> 13:03.120
I hope it's going to make it just a little bit more competitive.

13:03.120 --> 13:05.860
And then over the next few weeks, we'll keep iterating on our sound to make it even sound

13:05.860 --> 13:07.220
better and better.

13:07.220 --> 13:09.940
And it's all at coder.show.

13:09.940 --> 13:11.920
You can still go to the Jupyter Broadcasting website, it's still going to be published

13:11.920 --> 13:12.920
there as well.

13:12.920 --> 13:14.860
But the primary home is coder.show.

13:14.860 --> 13:18.220
And hopefully that'll be a good resource for people that are new to the show and people

13:18.220 --> 13:20.260
who have been listening to the show for quite a while.

13:20.260 --> 13:23.780
And you'll get to use the new fancy back end just by listening to the show, which I'm really

13:23.780 --> 13:24.780
excited about.

13:24.780 --> 13:27.940
And get some TLC up in this business, Mike, for the 300, you know?

13:27.940 --> 13:30.940
So we're rolling all these new features out as part of episode 300.

13:30.940 --> 13:32.220
It's like a feature release.

13:32.220 --> 13:34.260
How about that?

13:34.260 --> 13:35.680
But wait, there's more.

13:35.680 --> 13:36.780
There is more.

13:36.780 --> 13:37.780
There is more.

13:37.780 --> 13:38.780
You're right.

13:38.780 --> 13:42.220
People would almost think we rehearsed that, but we did not.

13:42.220 --> 13:43.220
We got to do some swag.

13:43.220 --> 13:44.900
If nothing else, Mike and I want it.

13:44.900 --> 13:49.100
And so we're doing sort of an assortment of things.

13:49.100 --> 13:50.940
First of all, we've got a t-shirt.

13:50.940 --> 13:57.020
We've got a t-shirt and a hoodie, teespring.com slash coder 300, links are in the show notes.

13:57.020 --> 14:03.940
You can get yourself a Coder 300 t-shirt, which, by the way, that white Coder Radio

14:03.940 --> 14:08.300
logo with a 300 on it looks really good with the green shirt, just at some of the demos

14:08.300 --> 14:09.380
I've seen.

14:09.380 --> 14:11.440
So it's teespring.com slash coder 300.

14:11.440 --> 14:14.140
We got the shirt and the hoodie, depending on where you live, you can pick whatever is

14:14.140 --> 14:15.820
best for your temperature.

14:15.820 --> 14:20.260
And then we have my favorite swag item, Coder Radio coasters.

14:20.260 --> 14:23.120
We have fricking coasters now for the Coder Radio program.

14:23.120 --> 14:24.500
How amazing is this?

14:24.500 --> 14:25.820
So it could be for water.

14:25.820 --> 14:26.820
It totally could be for water.

14:26.820 --> 14:27.820
It might be for a gin and tonic.

14:27.820 --> 14:28.820
I mean, I'm not saying-

14:28.820 --> 14:30.820
No, I don't know anything about that.

14:30.820 --> 14:31.820
No, I'm not.

14:31.820 --> 14:32.820
What do we know?

14:32.820 --> 14:33.820
We're just saying.

14:33.820 --> 14:34.820
But yeah, check that out.

14:34.820 --> 14:39.460
It's a Zazzle URL, so it's long and complicated, but we'll have a link in the show notes for

14:39.460 --> 14:41.660
that at coder.show slash 300.

14:41.660 --> 14:42.660
The Coder Radio coaster.

14:42.660 --> 14:44.140
I've got some in the studio right now.

14:44.140 --> 14:45.140
Hear me?

14:45.140 --> 14:46.140
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa there.

14:46.140 --> 14:47.140
Whoa there.

14:47.140 --> 14:48.140
I think this is so cool.

14:48.140 --> 14:49.140
And you got some too.

14:49.140 --> 14:50.140
I saw you demoing it, quote unquote, on your-

14:50.140 --> 14:52.820
I'm using one for my tea right now, actually.

14:52.820 --> 14:53.820
Awesome.

14:53.820 --> 14:56.740
$1.50 for a coaster.

14:56.740 --> 14:58.820
So get like a few of them.

14:58.820 --> 15:03.340
And then one of the things that we started doing with Unfilter that I think we should

15:03.340 --> 15:08.060
keep doing for all the shows, it looks so cool, it looks even better in person too,

15:08.060 --> 15:14.380
is we're launching for a limited time a Coder Radio 300 poster.

15:14.380 --> 15:20.060
And what it is, it's a word cloud of all of our different titles forming the 300.

15:20.060 --> 15:23.220
And it's a nice looking glossy poster.

15:23.220 --> 15:27.660
I've got one in the hallway for Unfilter, and I really like it.

15:27.660 --> 15:30.940
I can't quite get it to fit on the frame for the video people, but I'll have to just bail

15:30.940 --> 15:31.940
on that.

15:31.940 --> 15:33.460
It's not going to work.

15:33.460 --> 15:35.860
And it looks so good, Mike.

15:35.860 --> 15:40.820
And it's clever too, because what you get to do is you walk up to it and you see all

15:40.820 --> 15:43.140
the different titles and you think about, oh yeah, I remember that.

15:43.140 --> 15:44.140
Oh yeah, I remember that.

15:44.140 --> 15:45.180
Oh, that was a funny title.

15:45.180 --> 15:49.860
And so away from it, you see the 300, but up close, it's all the different crazy titles

15:49.860 --> 15:51.460
we've used for this.

15:51.460 --> 15:52.940
I'm reading some of them right now.

15:52.940 --> 15:57.020
Clustered Pie, Coder Inquisition, Backend Lock-in.

15:57.020 --> 15:58.020
Freelancer.

15:58.020 --> 15:59.020
Love it.

15:59.020 --> 16:00.020
So that's the poster.

16:00.020 --> 16:01.820
That's also a Zazzle long URL.

16:01.820 --> 16:03.620
We're just doing these as limited things.

16:03.620 --> 16:05.340
We're not going to make a fortune off this.

16:05.340 --> 16:08.980
There might be a slight profit, but check it out at the show notes, coder.show slash

16:08.980 --> 16:09.980
300.

16:09.980 --> 16:11.340
We got the t-shirt and the hoodie.

16:11.340 --> 16:12.340
We got the posters.

16:12.340 --> 16:15.300
And of course, the Coder coasters.

16:15.300 --> 16:16.620
Coder coasters.

16:16.620 --> 16:17.620
All that's over there.

16:17.620 --> 16:19.580
So whole new features, all that stuff.

16:19.580 --> 16:22.820
Why don't we just catch our breath for a moment?

16:22.820 --> 16:23.820
You good with that?

16:23.820 --> 16:24.820
We catch our breath.

16:24.820 --> 16:25.820
Let's talk about Digital Ocean.

16:25.820 --> 16:26.820
Do it.

16:26.820 --> 16:28.260
Because they're giving away something pretty great too.

16:28.260 --> 16:33.480
If you go to do.co slash coder, you can get a limited $100 credit.

16:33.480 --> 16:36.900
Now I believe you will have to put a valid credit card on file, but they're not going

16:36.900 --> 16:39.600
to charge it until after you use that $100 in credit.

16:39.600 --> 16:42.160
Now Digital Ocean is simplicity at scale.

16:42.160 --> 16:45.020
And they traditionally offer a $10 promo.

16:45.020 --> 16:51.020
And you can really get pretty far with their crazy fast infrastructure and scale up pretty

16:51.020 --> 16:54.520
fast to a pretty beefy system with a $10 credit.

16:54.520 --> 17:00.120
So when they come around offering a $100 credit, I would really jump on this if you've ever

17:00.120 --> 17:01.120
been on the fence.

17:01.120 --> 17:05.340
Go to do.co slash coder to take advantage of the limited time offer.

17:05.340 --> 17:07.580
Once you apply, you got 60 days to rock.

17:07.580 --> 17:11.380
You can also go if you've already have an account, but you haven't applied a promo and

17:11.380 --> 17:14.520
you just want to get the $10 credit and support the show, you can do that as well.

17:14.520 --> 17:15.520
It's Coder Digital.

17:15.520 --> 17:16.520
You apply that to your account.

17:16.520 --> 17:17.520
So what is Digital Ocean?

17:17.520 --> 17:22.220
Now if you've never heard us talk about it, it's really our trick to look professional

17:22.220 --> 17:26.100
and have fast infrastructure on demand because they've taken care of all the hard stuff.

17:26.100 --> 17:27.100
Everything's SSD based.

17:27.100 --> 17:28.560
They got eight data centers all over the world.

17:28.560 --> 17:31.260
They're deploying Linux and KVM systems.

17:31.260 --> 17:36.140
It's rockin fast 40 gigabit connections coming into these hypervisors and they've placed

17:36.140 --> 17:42.660
the data centers in key places that have extremely, extremely good bandwidth, generally at critical

17:42.660 --> 17:44.100
connection points on the internet.

17:44.100 --> 17:49.060
So you can get on their boss level infrastructure for just unbelievable prices.

17:49.060 --> 17:54.940
My favorite rig is just three cents, three cents an hour and they're offering $100 credit

17:54.940 --> 17:55.940
here.

17:55.940 --> 17:59.740
When you go to do.co slash coder and they have everything you need to set up a system,

17:59.740 --> 18:00.740
get ready to go.

18:00.740 --> 18:05.420
If you want to just deploy an entire GitLab stack with an Ubuntu LTS and a Docker container

18:05.420 --> 18:08.260
and it's all set up the way you want it, you do it in seconds.

18:08.260 --> 18:11.220
If you want to build a system from the ground up, you can do that too.

18:11.220 --> 18:15.860
And they have an API that's easy to follow, clearly documented and I'm guessing, although

18:15.860 --> 18:21.480
I don't know, but I'm guessing their entire digital ocean dashboard, their whole UI to

18:21.480 --> 18:25.620
manage all of this is an API client because everything's there.

18:25.620 --> 18:27.460
You want to expand a disk, you can do it via the API.

18:27.460 --> 18:29.700
You want to shut down a system, you can do it via the API.

18:29.700 --> 18:33.580
You want to take a snapshot or a backup, you can do it via the API, which means there's

18:33.580 --> 18:37.300
tons of good code already written that you can just grab and use or you can write something

18:37.300 --> 18:38.300
yourself.

18:38.300 --> 18:41.700
You know, we've got, we've got a Ruby bot that does it and it's great.

18:41.700 --> 18:43.220
It's just awesome.

18:43.220 --> 18:46.220
It's so easy to start working with because it's whatever level you want to jump in.

18:46.220 --> 18:50.540
If you're a newbie, you've never even set up a web server before, or if you've been

18:50.540 --> 18:54.380
deploying servers for 13 years, it's going to work for you.

18:54.380 --> 18:59.100
And then whenever you get stuck, they have world-class documentation, world-class.

18:59.100 --> 19:03.700
They really, they have a full-time editorial team that really works to make that stuff

19:03.700 --> 19:07.900
clean and easy to follow, digitalocean.com and get our a hundred dollar limited time

19:07.900 --> 19:13.100
promo at do.co slash coder and a big thank you to DigitalOcean for sponsoring the Coder

19:13.100 --> 19:19.660
Radio Program, longtime supporters of the show and helping us get to 300 episodes, do.co

19:19.660 --> 19:21.860
slash coder.

19:21.860 --> 19:24.420
It's tough out there to make money selling software.

19:24.420 --> 19:25.420
Shareware was a thing.

19:25.420 --> 19:26.420
Remember neg screens?

19:26.420 --> 19:28.580
You can use this for 15 days and then you have to pay.

19:28.580 --> 19:30.460
And then there was in-app purchases.

19:30.460 --> 19:34.940
Well, entrepreneur developers on the Mac platform created an app that's designed to

19:34.940 --> 19:38.700
manage your calendar and it's called Creatively Calendar 2.

19:38.700 --> 19:44.260
One of the things they decided to do to monetize their application was to offer users a few

19:44.260 --> 19:45.860
different options.

19:45.860 --> 19:53.220
Number one was you could activate all of the features permanently for a one-time $17.99

19:53.220 --> 19:54.420
charge.

19:54.420 --> 20:02.340
Number two is you could subscribe at 99 cents a month to get the features of the application,

20:02.340 --> 20:10.660
all of them for 99 cents a month or the default option, choose nothing, pay nothing and the

20:10.660 --> 20:16.060
calendar will quote unobtrusively mine cryptocurrency in the background.

20:16.060 --> 20:18.300
And that's how they're monetizing the application.

20:18.300 --> 20:25.500
And before Apple kicked them out of the Mac App Store, they made $2,000 in three days

20:25.500 --> 20:29.740
by quietly mining cryptocurrency on Mac users and they couldn't have had what, more than

20:29.740 --> 20:30.740
a hundred or so?

20:30.740 --> 20:34.100
They could have had thousands and thousands of users, this is the damn Mac App Store we're

20:34.100 --> 20:35.100
talking about.

20:35.100 --> 20:38.700
So it could have only probably only a few hundred people mining crypto to pay for the

20:38.700 --> 20:39.700
app.

20:39.700 --> 20:41.820
How about that for a monetization strategy, Mr. Dominic?

20:41.820 --> 20:44.500
You like that?

20:44.500 --> 20:48.260
So when I saw this, I didn't think it was real.

20:48.260 --> 20:49.260
I was surprised.

20:49.260 --> 20:54.220
It actually made news when it entered the store before Apple even kicked it out.

20:54.220 --> 20:56.580
I was like, how did Apple let this happen?

20:56.580 --> 20:59.780
Then Apple was like, yeah, no, we're kicking this out.

20:59.780 --> 21:05.980
I kind of think this is one of the few cases Apple's right to kick something out.

21:05.980 --> 21:12.020
Now Apple does have a policy that says your application must be designed to use, I think

21:12.020 --> 21:16.340
the verbiage is to be power efficient as possible, is the guideline.

21:16.340 --> 21:21.740
I'm not sure that like mining cryptocurrency for some app developer is what you want to

21:21.740 --> 21:22.740
be doing.

21:22.740 --> 21:26.340
I agree, but at the same time, if they're clear about it, if they're saying, hey, this

21:26.340 --> 21:28.780
has an $18 value to us.

21:28.780 --> 21:31.300
And if you mine crypto, what about this?

21:31.300 --> 21:34.940
What if they say if you mine cryptocurrency for two weeks, you'll be paid up?

21:34.940 --> 21:39.300
Like if they're super clear about it, it's like a splash screen when you first launch

21:39.300 --> 21:40.820
the application.

21:40.820 --> 21:44.180
They're 100% transparent about it.

21:44.180 --> 21:45.180
You know what?

21:45.180 --> 21:47.860
This might be my old madness coming out.

21:47.860 --> 21:49.700
It just seems bad to me.

21:49.700 --> 21:57.740
Yeah, I'm torn because the open source cryptocurrency enthusiast in me says this could be a new

21:57.740 --> 22:03.140
way for a win-win, for users to get free apps and for developers to monetize in a way that

22:03.140 --> 22:08.540
isn't skeevy, that doesn't require even setting up Stripe and setting up a subscription service.

22:08.540 --> 22:12.580
You just mine the crypto and send it to a wallet and it's all happening in the background

22:12.580 --> 22:16.420
and you could even nice it to a certain level to make sure it doesn't abuse a person's system.

22:16.420 --> 22:20.580
I would really like to know what the audience thinks about this because I also agree with

22:20.580 --> 22:23.980
you, there's going to be a lot of people that have no idea what's going on.

22:23.980 --> 22:26.980
It's going to burn through laptops faster.

22:26.980 --> 22:30.580
If you start to even get more than one or two applications to start doing this, you're

22:30.580 --> 22:33.940
going to have a massive fight for resources on people's computers.

22:33.940 --> 22:38.540
So let us know what you guys think, coder.show slash contact.

22:38.540 --> 22:39.540
I'm torn.

22:39.540 --> 22:43.220
I'm 50 50 torn on this one because it almost seems like what you'd need is like some centralized

22:43.220 --> 22:48.140
crypto mining service that every application could participate in because if they all are

22:48.140 --> 22:52.300
off on their own mining crypto, it's going to be a God knows what on your system.

22:52.300 --> 22:53.300
Yeah.

22:53.300 --> 22:56.600
So Apple kicked them out, but they did generate $2,000, which makes me think if they did that

22:56.600 --> 22:58.740
in three days on the Mac app store.

22:58.740 --> 23:02.020
Oh, yeah, no, they would have had some money here.

23:02.020 --> 23:03.020
Yeah.

23:03.020 --> 23:04.020
Yeah.

23:04.020 --> 23:05.020
Yeah.

23:05.020 --> 23:06.020
Hey, just a quick one.

23:06.020 --> 23:07.020
I don't even think I tossed this one in the doc.

23:07.020 --> 23:09.740
But while we're talking Hoopla, did you see that Google just announced the change of Android

23:09.740 --> 23:15.420
where to wear OS so no more Android where it's now where OS know if you I don't really

23:15.420 --> 23:18.660
have thoughts on that, but Google needed one more OS.

23:18.660 --> 23:21.540
It's Yeah, I wake up every morning thinking it's time.

23:21.540 --> 23:22.540
Yeah, really?

23:22.540 --> 23:23.540
Yeah, really.

23:23.540 --> 23:28.580
I think once they get fuchsia out, and once they get also they need another OS like they

23:28.580 --> 23:31.660
need another messaging platform.

23:31.660 --> 23:35.120
But this is this is to better they say they want to do this because they they're trying

23:35.120 --> 23:38.800
to make it clear that certain aware functions also work on iOS.

23:38.800 --> 23:45.540
And so calling it Android where is our calling it Android where makes it sound like it only

23:45.540 --> 23:46.620
works with Android devices.

23:46.620 --> 23:51.460
So calling it just where OS seems to speaking of iOS devices.

23:51.460 --> 23:52.820
Yeah.

23:52.820 --> 23:56.060
I also went to the Apple Store, Chris.

23:56.060 --> 23:57.220
Who else went to the Apple Store?

23:57.220 --> 23:58.460
You say also who else?

23:58.460 --> 23:59.460
You did you have a HomePod.

23:59.460 --> 24:02.300
Oh, she's still giving me a hard time about that.

24:02.300 --> 24:03.300
Okay.

24:03.300 --> 24:04.300
Yeah, I picked up an Apple Watch.

24:04.300 --> 24:05.300
Oh, you did?

24:05.300 --> 24:06.300
Really?

24:06.300 --> 24:09.940
I am living the wearable lifestyle in the Apple world.

24:09.940 --> 24:11.980
You know what?

24:11.980 --> 24:17.420
It is a significantly better than every Android wear watch I've ever used.

24:17.420 --> 24:19.220
Yeah, I have owned.

24:19.220 --> 24:21.260
I have owned three Android wear devices.

24:21.260 --> 24:22.940
I have owned two pebbles.

24:22.940 --> 24:24.820
And now I've owned two Apple Watches.

24:24.820 --> 24:27.120
Because what I do is I buy them and sometimes return them.

24:27.120 --> 24:32.040
Or what I also have done is I've gifted them to family and friends.

24:32.040 --> 24:37.420
And then they usually know like my dad and my lady and kids, they know like dad wants

24:37.420 --> 24:40.580
or Chris wants some feedback on how that's all working.

24:40.580 --> 24:46.060
And so I still get active feedback, I gave my last Android wear watch to chase from unfilter.

24:46.060 --> 24:48.380
And he still tells me, you know, he tells me about all the things he's trying with it.

24:48.380 --> 24:49.460
And he's an enthusiast, too.

24:49.460 --> 24:50.980
So he really tries to push it.

24:50.980 --> 24:53.140
But I completely agree.

24:53.140 --> 24:56.400
There is wearable devices like Fitbit and Android wear.

24:56.400 --> 24:59.780
And then there's the Apple Watch, which is a different device.

24:59.780 --> 25:03.180
It's closer to a computer on your wrist.

25:03.180 --> 25:04.180
It's smooth, too.

25:04.180 --> 25:05.180
It's smooth.

25:05.180 --> 25:06.180
So why'd you get it?

25:06.180 --> 25:07.180
Why did you drop the money?

25:07.180 --> 25:08.940
I mean, why out of nowhere go get an Apple Watch?

25:08.940 --> 25:12.860
Well, I'm working on a project that does have an Apple Watch integration.

25:12.860 --> 25:15.860
Oh, you sneaky, you sneaky, you sneaky dog.

25:15.860 --> 25:16.860
Sneaky sneaky.

25:16.860 --> 25:17.860
Yeah, that makes sense.

25:17.860 --> 25:23.980
But you know, it's a customer product, but it's interesting because the development experience,

25:23.980 --> 25:26.860
like where the user experience on the Apple Watch is phenomenal.

25:26.860 --> 25:29.900
And I've like done a little bit of Apple Watch integration before, but like never enough

25:29.900 --> 25:33.220
to care.

25:33.220 --> 25:36.180
It has not improved much at all.

25:36.180 --> 25:38.180
Yeah, the apps really suck.

25:38.180 --> 25:43.740
I think if you're buying an Apple Watch to use apps, you're going to be really disappointed.

25:43.740 --> 25:51.860
So even to develop apps, I mean, it's surprising how just like, I know this is a bad analogy

25:51.860 --> 25:57.100
and people are going to not like it, but it reminds me of like those old Java UI frameworks

25:57.100 --> 26:02.060
from the 90s, like very rigid and not very good.

26:02.060 --> 26:06.360
Well, I'll tell you what, I suspect having used the Apple Watch for quite a while is

26:06.360 --> 26:08.900
it's the way Apple fundamentally approached it.

26:08.900 --> 26:12.860
They designed it as a device that is dependent on a master device, the phone, and it's got

26:12.860 --> 26:15.660
to have a Bluetooth or a Wi-Fi connection back to that device.

26:15.660 --> 26:20.040
A lot of the application processing happens on the iPhone device and then it sends the

26:20.040 --> 26:23.220
data over to the watch.

26:23.220 --> 26:28.240
And now these watches have built-in LTE modems, they have Wi-Fi radios, they need to be independent

26:28.240 --> 26:32.700
operators that are not connected to the iPhone at all.

26:32.700 --> 26:38.540
And I think that initial design choice inhibits the applications and it limits what you can

26:38.540 --> 26:39.900
do on the thing.

26:39.900 --> 26:42.420
And the SDK probably reflects, I would imagine.

26:42.420 --> 26:44.540
Yeah, that's exactly right.

26:44.540 --> 26:48.140
That's exactly what the SDK looks like.

26:48.140 --> 27:01.260
Which I don't know why Apple, because originally the issues were battery life for the Apple

27:01.260 --> 27:06.860
Watch because the original version was very weak, didn't last too long.

27:06.860 --> 27:11.420
But it seems silly now when having used Android Wear, which has lots of problems, I'm not

27:11.420 --> 27:12.940
like...

27:12.940 --> 27:16.620
But you can do more interesting things on Android Wear.

27:16.620 --> 27:22.020
The problem is you have no install base and the people who do have them, there are wide

27:22.020 --> 27:24.740
variations between the different watches.

27:24.740 --> 27:29.020
Yes, that has definitely been my experience.

27:29.020 --> 27:37.900
You know what strikes me about this is Google, Amazon, and Apple are all moving into health

27:37.900 --> 27:41.020
and media in a really, really kind of big way.

27:41.020 --> 27:46.460
And Apple and Android Wear, or now Wear OS specifically, are gonna have different shots

27:46.460 --> 27:50.900
at monitoring your heart, your blood pressure, your glucose levels, all these things they're

27:50.900 --> 27:53.300
experimenting with, with these watches right now.

27:53.300 --> 27:56.960
They're about to enter a totally new market.

27:56.960 --> 28:00.980
And you gotta wonder, what is the downsides to that and what are the opportunities for

28:00.980 --> 28:02.540
developers at the same time?

28:02.540 --> 28:06.180
I'm really torn on that because it feels like it could be extremely invasive and it also

28:06.180 --> 28:10.540
feels like it could be very monetizable for people creating different apps for activities

28:10.540 --> 28:12.980
or biohacking or whatever.

28:12.980 --> 28:15.700
It's gonna be a gold mine for some folks.

28:15.700 --> 28:21.480
But looking at this, at first I would have thought, I know Apple's changed the most since

28:21.480 --> 28:22.780
we started this show.

28:22.780 --> 28:24.740
And then I would have thought about it somewhere, I would have said Microsoft.

28:24.740 --> 28:26.060
No, it's really been Microsoft.

28:26.060 --> 28:30.700
They made that pivot to really actually committing to Linux and open source.

28:30.700 --> 28:34.100
But when I think about it, I think it's actually Amazon.

28:34.100 --> 28:35.100
I think Amazon-

28:35.100 --> 28:36.100
Really?

28:36.100 --> 28:37.100
Yeah.

28:37.100 --> 28:43.580
I mean, if you think about the fact that EC2 runs the entire internet now, and Amazon also

28:43.580 --> 28:47.300
is the third most valuable company in the world.

28:47.300 --> 28:51.260
And in 2014, they were totally missing all of their targets.

28:51.260 --> 28:57.920
But this year, last quarter, they made a $60 billion profit.

28:57.920 --> 29:02.780
And they now get 40% of all spending by US customers online.

29:02.780 --> 29:09.460
54% of US households with internet use have Prime, 54% of US households that have internet

29:09.460 --> 29:10.980
have Prime.

29:10.980 --> 29:15.960
The Echo has 30,000 skills, it's way ahead of all of the competition.

29:15.960 --> 29:21.780
They're gonna be selling pharmaceuticals soon, and they're launching deeper and deeper into

29:21.780 --> 29:25.700
online services.

29:25.700 --> 29:29.460
And then I look at Prime now too, they're becoming a media company.

29:29.460 --> 29:34.780
By early 2017, Amazon had an audience of 26 million for all Prime video programming, which

29:34.780 --> 29:37.500
is like the films, the TV show.

29:37.500 --> 29:38.500
That's pretty good.

29:38.500 --> 29:43.200
2017, they had 26 million Prime video program watchers.

29:43.200 --> 29:47.700
They're firing on every single cylinder, they're about to open up a new headquarters, the headquarters

29:47.700 --> 29:48.700
two.

29:48.700 --> 29:53.860
I don't know, I think Amazon might be the sleeper.

29:53.860 --> 29:57.540
Because everything they've been doing has been at the infrastructure level for so long.

29:57.540 --> 30:00.140
And on the stuff that we don't really keep a close eye on, which is the brick and mortar

30:00.140 --> 30:05.500
like domination game, that I think they've sort of just arrived all of a sudden from

30:05.500 --> 30:06.500
our perspective.

30:06.500 --> 30:09.760
But they're such a huge player, especially in IT.

30:09.760 --> 30:14.620
I just think Amazon might be the real company to be watching out of all of these, like out

30:14.620 --> 30:16.900
of the Apples and the Googles and the Microsoft.

30:16.900 --> 30:21.340
I mean, their game is kind of figured out, but Amazon's just kind of getting started

30:21.340 --> 30:22.340
in a way.

30:22.340 --> 30:23.340
You know what I mean?

30:23.340 --> 30:26.380
Like they still have Walmart to kill, they're opening up grocery stores, they just bought

30:26.380 --> 30:32.540
Whole Foods, they bought Twitch, they just bought Ring, and they're going into home security

30:32.540 --> 30:33.840
products now.

30:33.840 --> 30:36.660
They're going to completely own the home.

30:36.660 --> 30:39.180
They're turning your home into a store.

30:39.180 --> 30:40.180
It's interesting.

30:40.180 --> 30:45.200
I really wouldn't have thought of them like that in terms of changing over the time we've

30:45.200 --> 30:46.900
been doing the show.

30:46.900 --> 30:47.900
But I guess you're right.

30:47.900 --> 30:53.900
I mean, they are in a lot of ways becoming, I don't even know and it's to borrow a term

30:53.900 --> 30:57.420
from Steve Jobs in the 90s, your digital hub, right?

30:57.420 --> 31:02.060
I'm thinking about all the things in my house that effectively run on She Who Will Not Be

31:02.060 --> 31:05.060
Named, right?

31:05.060 --> 31:09.180
Or the fact that my first, even for my business, my first thing is, oh, let's see what the

31:09.180 --> 31:11.140
Amazon prices, buying on Amazon, right?

31:11.140 --> 31:15.340
Because it's just easier.

31:15.340 --> 31:18.940
And they've certainly gotten significant leadership in the emerging technologies.

31:18.940 --> 31:22.860
I mean, they embrace stocker and containerization very fast.

31:22.860 --> 31:25.140
Yeah, yeah, and they've been rewarded handsomely for it.

31:25.140 --> 31:32.700
I mean, they are leading the pack in terms of with AWS, Lambda, I can't remember the

31:32.700 --> 31:34.900
name of the technology now.

31:34.900 --> 31:35.900
Yeah.

31:35.900 --> 31:41.740
And, you know, also, one of the things I want to toss in there was there's a term that's

31:41.740 --> 31:45.460
being coined by the industry, by startups.

31:45.460 --> 31:48.900
And it's called being Amazon, which means to have your business crushed because the

31:48.900 --> 31:51.260
company got into your industry.

31:51.260 --> 31:55.900
And fear of being Amazon has become such a defining feature of commerce.

31:55.900 --> 32:01.200
It's easy to forget that, you know, around the start of our show, it was already beginning,

32:01.200 --> 32:04.840
but around, you know, around that time, Amazon was still predominantly a bookstore.

32:04.840 --> 32:07.460
They were a larger, they were bigger than that then.

32:07.460 --> 32:11.660
But that was still what they were predominantly known for is that the discussion was, I think

32:11.660 --> 32:13.700
Amazon is going to put Barnes and Noble out of business.

32:13.700 --> 32:18.100
I don't think there's going to be more book and mortar bookstores, brick and mortar bookstores,

32:18.100 --> 32:19.420
because Amazon is going to put them out of business.

32:19.420 --> 32:20.860
Well, now that's a foregone conclusion.

32:20.860 --> 32:21.860
Now that's obvious.

32:21.860 --> 32:23.100
Of course that was going to happen.

32:23.100 --> 32:26.100
But when the show started, that was the conversation.

32:26.100 --> 32:27.140
Now look at them.

32:27.140 --> 32:28.580
Now they run the Internet.

32:28.580 --> 32:33.120
And Jeff Bezos has multiple deals with the CIA to run private infrastructure.

32:33.120 --> 32:35.700
And he just bought a huge mansion in Washington, D.C.

32:35.700 --> 32:41.140
Bezos is like a serious player now in politics and their company is a massive player on the

32:41.140 --> 32:42.140
Internet.

32:42.140 --> 32:43.140
All right.

32:43.140 --> 32:47.100
But don't they remind you of someone else named Microsoft in the 90s now?

32:47.100 --> 32:48.100
Yeah, a little bit.

32:48.100 --> 32:50.840
I mean, Google does more of that than Amazon.

32:50.840 --> 32:55.700
Amazon feels like something new, you know, because they started as a retailer and now

32:55.700 --> 33:00.020
they've morphed into an infrastructure company and a media company.

33:00.020 --> 33:06.340
And they're soon going to become a pharmaceutical seller and a home security company.

33:06.340 --> 33:07.340
I don't know, man.

33:07.340 --> 33:08.340
I don't know.

33:08.340 --> 33:11.380
You know, we do have some, you know, speaking of looking back, we do have some really, really

33:11.380 --> 33:12.980
good data from Stack Overflow.

33:12.980 --> 33:16.900
So before we get there, let's take a moment and thank Linux Academy for sponsoring the

33:16.900 --> 33:20.100
Coder Radio program, LinuxAcademy.com slash coders.

33:20.100 --> 33:24.180
It's a platform to learn more about Linux and everything around Linux, the stuff that

33:24.180 --> 33:26.580
makes you look great on the resume and the stuff that will really challenge you and push

33:26.580 --> 33:27.580
your career forward.

33:27.580 --> 33:28.580
LinuxAcademy.com slash coders.

33:28.580 --> 33:34.140

33:37.980 --> 33:39.700
LinuxAcademy.com slash coders.

33:39.700 --> 33:42.980
They have in-depth video courses on every Linux and cloud topic.

33:42.980 --> 33:45.420
If you're in the DevOps field, they have courseware just for you.

33:45.420 --> 33:49.440
If you want to go get certifications, they got tracks that are built just for that.

33:49.440 --> 33:53.380
And if you're ready to deep dive into single topics, you got 15, 20 minutes tonight, they

33:53.380 --> 33:58.100
got something for you to learn about firewalling or how the file system works.

33:58.100 --> 33:59.400
Finally get permissions nailed.

33:59.400 --> 34:00.540
How do ACLs really work?

34:00.540 --> 34:02.040
How do extended attributes work?

34:02.040 --> 34:03.620
They got courseware just on that.

34:03.620 --> 34:07.140
And then if you ever get stuck, they got full time human beings.

34:07.140 --> 34:08.260
They're there and ready to help.

34:08.260 --> 34:13.380
In fact, they have all full instructor staff that's constantly adding, updating, maintaining

34:13.380 --> 34:17.100
the courseware at Linux Academy and keeping your subscription valuable.

34:17.100 --> 34:21.620
And you can start with a seven day free trial at LinuxAcademy.com slash coders.

34:21.620 --> 34:24.740
That's LinuxAcademy.com slash coders.

34:24.740 --> 34:29.220
And a big thank you to Linux Academy for sponsoring the CoderRadio program for so darn long.

34:29.220 --> 34:31.640
And there's lots of CoderRadio listeners over there too.

34:31.640 --> 34:35.220
So if you join the community, you'll be among friends.

34:35.220 --> 34:37.680
LinuxAcademy.com slash coders.

34:37.680 --> 34:41.940
So Stack Overflow has released their annual survey of developers.

34:41.940 --> 34:44.900
And they have a bunch of different developers that have chimed in self-described back end

34:44.900 --> 34:53.580
developers made up 57.9%, a full stack developer made up 48.2%, and a front end developer 37.8%.

34:53.580 --> 34:58.420
And mobile developers only weighing in at 20% of those surveyed, which I thought was

34:58.420 --> 35:00.140
kind of interesting.

35:00.140 --> 35:05.500
And the numbers of contributing to open source were the exact opposite of what I expected.

35:05.500 --> 35:13.660
All respondents said that no, 56.4% of them do not contribute to open source.

35:13.660 --> 35:15.780
And 43.6% said they do.

35:15.780 --> 35:18.140
I actually thought it'd be reversed.

35:18.140 --> 35:21.900
And when you look at just professional developers, the numbers don't change much.

35:21.900 --> 35:26.620
Coding as a hobby, 80% said yes, 19% said no.

35:26.620 --> 35:29.300
There's a lot of different things in here though that I found to be pretty interesting,

35:29.300 --> 35:33.260
including how long people took to learn and stuff like that.

35:33.260 --> 35:38.300
But of course, the thing that I couldn't help but notice is that Linux was significantly

35:38.300 --> 35:40.140
well represented in this.

35:40.140 --> 35:44.620
In fact, Linux is moving to be one of the number one development platforms that developers

35:44.620 --> 35:45.620
use.

35:45.620 --> 35:46.620
Do you want to start there?

35:46.620 --> 35:49.860
I mean, there's lots to get into, but man, did that totally jump out at me.

35:49.860 --> 35:54.300
So there's actually two things about Linux on here that I would like to start with.

35:54.300 --> 35:58.660
One is target platform, which makes sense if you're doing back end development.

35:58.660 --> 36:06.020
I mean, sure, you could be on Azure IAS, but I hope you're not on IAS, it's a bad place.

36:06.020 --> 36:07.020
Azure's fine.

36:07.020 --> 36:08.020
I like Azure.

36:08.020 --> 36:14.400
You might also be on BSD, but at some point, BSD just hurts more than it's worth.

36:14.400 --> 36:18.420
That was for you, Alan.

36:18.420 --> 36:19.420
It's not just...

36:19.420 --> 36:21.700
Did you see the two data points though?

36:21.700 --> 36:24.760
It's not just that it's the target platform, right?

36:24.760 --> 36:29.700
It's also the dev environment that people are working in for their machine.

36:29.700 --> 36:30.700
What is it?

36:30.700 --> 36:32.940
It's only a few percentage points off from Mac OS.

36:32.940 --> 36:34.860
Yeah, yeah, exactly.

36:34.860 --> 36:35.860
Which is amazing.

36:35.860 --> 36:40.340
I mean, we've been doing these Stack Overflow surveys for the entire length of the show

36:40.340 --> 36:42.620
and that was not the case before.

36:42.620 --> 36:43.620
Yeah.

36:43.620 --> 36:45.900
Visual Studio Code also super well-represented.

36:45.900 --> 36:46.900
Dominating.

36:46.900 --> 36:47.900
Yep.

36:47.900 --> 36:48.900
Mm-hmm.

36:48.900 --> 36:49.900
Yeah.

36:49.900 --> 36:50.900
Windows still doing pretty well.

36:50.900 --> 36:55.820
But boy, we're talking about a decline for Windows and a huge rise for Linux.

36:55.820 --> 36:57.320
That is really something.

36:57.320 --> 37:00.140
The majority have at least two monitors too, which I thought was kind of funny.

37:00.140 --> 37:03.340
I like that.

37:03.340 --> 37:06.620
I mean, there was also the most loved, dreaded, and wanted platforms.

37:06.620 --> 37:11.500
Linux was the most loved at 76.5, but then check this out.

37:11.500 --> 37:17.980
Serverless was the second most loved platform at 75.2, followed by AWS and then the Raspberry

37:17.980 --> 37:18.980
Pi.

37:18.980 --> 37:24.820
Then a couple bit further down was iOS and Apple TV and Apple Watch and Mac OS.

37:24.820 --> 37:25.820
What?

37:25.820 --> 37:29.220
Then Firebase and then Android.

37:29.220 --> 37:32.020
Android way down on the list there.

37:32.020 --> 37:33.060
That's a bad show.

37:33.060 --> 37:34.780
The most dreaded was SharePoint.

37:34.780 --> 37:36.300
Of course.

37:36.300 --> 37:37.300
That may...

37:37.300 --> 37:38.980
I mean, I just shook a little bit.

37:38.980 --> 37:39.980
Keep it going.

37:39.980 --> 37:40.980
Yeah.

37:40.980 --> 37:46.140
Drupal, Salesforce, and developing for mainframes, WordPress, and Windows Phone competing for

37:46.140 --> 37:47.220
shared hate.

37:47.220 --> 37:48.700
And then the most wanted.

37:48.700 --> 37:50.820
The most wanted, I think, to get better.

37:50.820 --> 37:52.380
I don't know what wanted really means.

37:52.380 --> 37:53.740
But number one, Android.

37:53.740 --> 37:55.280
Number two, Raspberry Pi.

37:55.280 --> 37:56.680
Number three, AWS.

37:56.680 --> 37:57.740
Number four, Linux.

37:57.740 --> 38:00.060
And number five, iOS.

38:00.060 --> 38:03.980
Google Cloud Platform makes a few honorable mentions on the list too, but man, does Linux

38:03.980 --> 38:07.820
just make a dominant showing now.

38:07.820 --> 38:09.820
Visual Studio Code is pretty popular.

38:09.820 --> 38:11.300
I was really surprised by that.

38:11.300 --> 38:15.420
Amongst mobile developers, you won't be too shocked to learn that Android Studio dominates

38:15.420 --> 38:17.420
there, and Xcode as well.

38:17.420 --> 38:20.100
That's no shocker.

38:20.100 --> 38:22.420
When you sort of don't really have any other good choices.

38:22.420 --> 38:23.420
Yeah.

38:23.420 --> 38:24.420
It's funny how that works, huh?

38:24.420 --> 38:25.420
Yeah.

38:25.420 --> 38:28.220
Was there any trends or any numbers in here that felt like it was out of sync with what

38:28.220 --> 38:32.180
you personally have experienced?

38:32.180 --> 38:35.660
Nothing shocked me other than really just how popular Linux was.

38:35.660 --> 38:41.720
So the two shocking things for me was actually serverless and Linux.

38:41.720 --> 38:44.220
That was the term I was thinking of a few minutes ago.

38:44.220 --> 38:52.700
I get why AWS Lambda or Azure Functions, which are two prominent serverless technologies,

38:52.700 --> 39:02.340
are convenient, but it seems odd that they would get so much adoption so quickly, given

39:02.340 --> 39:08.620
that most enterprises, most things that are already in production, already have infrastructure

39:08.620 --> 39:09.620
behind them.

39:09.620 --> 39:10.620
Yeah.

39:10.620 --> 39:12.980
I have thoughts on this.

39:12.980 --> 39:16.680
Because we did sort of a rundown on TechSnap, and so I kind of did a deep dive into all

39:16.680 --> 39:17.680
of this.

39:17.680 --> 39:23.940
But there's a lot of trends that you could point to, including infrastructure management,

39:23.940 --> 39:28.140
containerization, Docker, serverless.

39:28.140 --> 39:37.340
They all are really about de-emphasizing the role of the sysadmin and empowering the developer

39:37.340 --> 39:41.620
to go from concept to actually deploying code much faster.

39:41.620 --> 39:47.100
If you think about when we started the show, it was much closer to go deploy a rack system.

39:47.100 --> 39:48.100
You order the hardware.

39:48.100 --> 39:49.460
You've got to figure out how much hardware you want.

39:49.460 --> 39:50.460
You provision that.

39:50.460 --> 39:52.660
Somebody slides into a rack for you.

39:52.660 --> 39:53.980
They set up the base operating system.

39:53.980 --> 39:57.660
They create you a user account that probably doesn't have all the privileges you need.

39:57.660 --> 40:01.100
And then they email you the SSH login info and say, OK, you're good to go.

40:01.100 --> 40:04.300
And then if you don't have the package, then you email the sysadmin back and say, hey,

40:04.300 --> 40:06.020
can you install this Apache module?

40:06.020 --> 40:07.320
I need this as well.

40:07.320 --> 40:09.120
And then he gets to it later that day.

40:09.120 --> 40:10.120
He logs into the box.

40:10.120 --> 40:12.300
The app gets the Apache module, writes you back.

40:12.300 --> 40:13.360
You say it's done.

40:13.360 --> 40:14.360
You log in.

40:14.360 --> 40:15.360
You say, oh, shit.

40:15.360 --> 40:16.700
Turns out that's not the right version.

40:16.700 --> 40:19.060
I need a newer version that's in the Debian repo.

40:19.060 --> 40:21.540
And then he takes two days to get back to you because now he's got to go and install

40:21.540 --> 40:22.540
it and go build it himself.

40:22.540 --> 40:23.540
And he's grumpy about it.

40:23.540 --> 40:26.200
And that's how you deployed software and set up code in the past.

40:26.200 --> 40:32.700
And now, serverless, I believe, is the ultimate version of developers are just totally running

40:32.700 --> 40:33.700
the show now.

40:33.700 --> 40:35.500
They're totally running the infrastructure show.

40:35.500 --> 40:38.060
They've outsourced infrastructure management to the professionals.

40:38.060 --> 40:39.220
They don't ever have to talk to them.

40:39.220 --> 40:41.660
They have this great abstraction layer between them.

40:41.660 --> 40:44.320
They just ship their Go app up to Lambda.

40:44.320 --> 40:46.140
It executes and returns the results.

40:46.140 --> 40:47.140
They save the results.

40:47.140 --> 40:48.140
Good to go.

40:48.140 --> 40:49.220
They never had to order a server.

40:49.220 --> 40:51.460
They never had to email a tech guy.

40:51.460 --> 40:52.800
It's all manageable.

40:52.800 --> 40:54.740
And they don't have to fuss with it.

40:54.740 --> 41:00.120
And what I think we are seeing in 2018 is the complete swing from the sysadmins control

41:00.120 --> 41:03.340
everything to now the developers control everything.

41:03.340 --> 41:07.120
And if you look at Linux as a platform, it was built around the sysadmin.

41:07.120 --> 41:08.440
You want to install some software?

41:08.440 --> 41:09.440
You got to be root.

41:09.440 --> 41:10.540
You want to open up a port?

41:10.540 --> 41:11.540
You got to be root.

41:11.540 --> 41:13.860
You got to have these permissions, these file permissions.

41:13.860 --> 41:15.300
Everything has to be just right.

41:15.300 --> 41:16.740
And it's really about the sysadmin.

41:16.740 --> 41:18.380
The sysadmin sets up the box.

41:18.380 --> 41:19.820
He sets up the software.

41:19.820 --> 41:24.300
And then the users use the system that the sysadmin has provided them.

41:24.300 --> 41:25.940
This is all being flipped on its head.

41:25.940 --> 41:33.220
And containerization and serverless is the ultimate manifestation of the shift of power,

41:33.220 --> 41:34.220
I think.

41:34.220 --> 41:37.060
And it's happened right in front of our faces as we've done these 300 episodes.

41:37.060 --> 41:38.060
Yeah, I know.

41:38.060 --> 41:39.060
I completely agree.

41:39.060 --> 41:43.500
I mean, there was a point when I was debating the virtue of just like getting a rack server,

41:43.500 --> 41:45.100
which now would be completely insane.

41:45.100 --> 41:46.620
It's ridiculous.

41:46.620 --> 41:50.860
The Linux thing, the thing that wasn't surprising for me, though, was like just the dominance

41:50.860 --> 41:52.700
of JavaScript, right?

41:52.700 --> 41:59.740
Just the absolute, you know, it's the number one most used language, according to the survey.

41:59.740 --> 42:02.180
Oh, let me pull up.

42:02.180 --> 42:03.180
I just had that.

42:03.180 --> 42:05.300
It wasn't Rust, although that was the most beloved.

42:05.300 --> 42:06.300
You probably saw that.

42:06.300 --> 42:07.300
No.

42:07.300 --> 42:08.300
Yeah, I did see that.

42:08.300 --> 42:09.300
Scrolling up.

42:09.300 --> 42:14.340
Also, apparently, F sharp makes the most money, as well as Clojure and Perl still ranking

42:14.340 --> 42:17.020
in a handsome salary as well.

42:17.020 --> 42:18.600
But the number, let's see, that's the visual.

42:18.600 --> 42:19.600
What is it?

42:19.600 --> 42:20.600
Do you remember?

42:20.600 --> 42:21.600
I don't know if I remember.

42:21.600 --> 42:24.060
Redis is the most loved wanted database.

42:24.060 --> 42:31.060
Libraries and tools, TensorFlow libraries, the most loved Rust is the dreaded is visual

42:31.060 --> 42:35.420
basic six, and wanted is Python and loved is Rust.

42:35.420 --> 42:38.540
But yeah, platforms.

42:38.540 --> 42:39.540
Long time love.

42:39.540 --> 42:40.540
Go ahead.

42:40.540 --> 42:41.740
What specific answer were you looking for out of there?

42:41.740 --> 42:43.380
Were you looking for anything particular?

42:43.380 --> 42:44.380
No.

42:44.380 --> 42:45.380
It's just a-

42:45.380 --> 42:46.380
JavaScript is 69.8%.

42:46.380 --> 42:47.380
HTML-

42:47.380 --> 42:48.380
Right.

42:48.380 --> 42:49.380
This is what you're looking for.

42:49.380 --> 42:50.380
JavaScript is 69.8%.

42:50.380 --> 42:54.580
HTML is 68.5%.

42:54.580 --> 42:56.660
And then it just kind of trails off from there.

42:56.660 --> 43:02.180
I feel like over the years we've been in the show, we've seen a maturing of JavaScript

43:02.180 --> 43:08.660
from annoying scripting language that I have to do because jQuery, to actual viable mature

43:08.660 --> 43:12.620
programming language that you can write large scale applications in.

43:12.620 --> 43:13.620
I completely agree.

43:13.620 --> 43:14.620
Yeah.

43:14.620 --> 43:15.620
Absolutely.

43:15.620 --> 43:20.180
Side note, friend of the show, Ms. Holmes of Theranos, apparently is going to jail.

43:20.180 --> 43:21.180
Why?

43:21.180 --> 43:22.180
What?

43:22.180 --> 43:23.180
Where did this come from?

43:23.180 --> 43:25.580
The SCC, Ars Technica, this just came up.

43:25.580 --> 43:26.580
Someone sent it to me.

43:26.580 --> 43:29.500
The SCC charges Theranos with massive fraud.

43:29.500 --> 43:34.980
CEO Holmes stripped of control.

43:34.980 --> 43:36.980
Breaking news on the quarter radius program.

43:36.980 --> 43:37.980
Yeah.

43:37.980 --> 43:38.980
Yep.

43:38.980 --> 43:39.980
Huh.

43:39.980 --> 43:40.980
Okay.

43:40.980 --> 43:47.900
Let's transition from the 2018 Stack Overflow results to your observations about the last

43:47.900 --> 43:52.180
10 years of living with an SDK, a particular SDK.

43:52.180 --> 43:54.340
Particular SDK though.

43:54.340 --> 43:55.340
The iOS SDK.

43:55.340 --> 43:56.340
Yeah.

43:56.340 --> 43:57.340
Yeah.

43:57.340 --> 43:58.340
How's that been?

43:58.340 --> 44:03.580
I mean, it feels like a lot's changed and at the same time not a ton has.

44:03.580 --> 44:06.020
But I sit further removed.

44:06.020 --> 44:09.500
So I was thinking about this a lot this morning because I didn't know, should I put this in

44:09.500 --> 44:10.500
the note?

44:10.500 --> 44:11.500
Yeah.

44:11.500 --> 44:19.980
I think the iOS SDK literally changed my life and I think a number of other developers'

44:19.980 --> 44:22.740
lives for the better.

44:22.740 --> 44:27.540
Let's go back in a time machine, let's go to 2008.

44:27.540 --> 44:31.940
If it weren't for this, I would have still been doing websites and Java applets, right?

44:31.940 --> 44:37.180
I'd be working in some big company, which is nothing wrong with being a dark matter

44:37.180 --> 44:40.660
developer, but you know, it's not really what I wanted.

44:40.660 --> 44:50.040
The iOS SDK was so new and the fact that Apple insisted on no flash apps and no really cross

44:50.040 --> 44:58.300
solutions other than HTML5 meant that people had to choose to do Objective-C.

44:58.300 --> 45:02.020
This is not going to be a swift bashing session yet.

45:02.020 --> 45:07.740
What that did for Mike of the past was it let me, who was young and didn't really have

45:07.740 --> 45:14.300
too many responsibilities, take a huge risk, huge, absolutely huge, learn this language

45:14.300 --> 45:17.740
that is completely unmarketable to anywhere but iOS development.

45:17.740 --> 45:22.660
Remember iOS development was not a certain thing the day it launched, right?

45:22.660 --> 45:31.420
But it made me and other people who took the scramble a rare commodity, a rare service

45:31.420 --> 45:36.460
provider which basically just allowed me to build a business from there because at one

45:36.460 --> 45:45.340
point I was one of three iOS dev shops in New Jersey and the big digital agencies didn't

45:45.340 --> 45:46.340
at least local to where I was.

45:46.340 --> 45:51.860
It did not take iOS development seriously and even when they started taking it seriously,

45:51.860 --> 45:57.060
they just outsourced it all to us because you have to remember people say it's a little

45:57.060 --> 46:02.180
different now, there's a lot of similarities between dev shops and agencies and you could

46:02.180 --> 46:05.460
argue they are the same.

46:05.460 --> 46:10.880
But back then digital agencies were doing print ad buying and they were doing design

46:10.880 --> 46:15.680
work and maybe a little bit of WordPress.

46:15.680 --> 46:20.860
They didn't want to take on this crazy Objective-C engineering and remember when the iOS SDK first

46:20.860 --> 46:23.100
came out, it was rough.

46:23.100 --> 46:30.420
This was a true C-like system, right, it's built on Mac or very similar to Mac.

46:30.420 --> 46:36.940
So it created this whole new market where you – and this is maybe a bit of a stretch

46:36.940 --> 46:44.620
but it enabled a lot of people I think to open businesses and compete in a market that

46:44.620 --> 46:51.220
was so immature that the large players didn't care for at the time, that it just opened

46:51.220 --> 46:52.220
the doors.

46:52.220 --> 47:00.260
I'm just going through it, I mean you were there, how crazy, how serious, no one thought

47:00.260 --> 47:05.700
the App Store was going to be serious because things like this, Windows Phone, the old version

47:05.700 --> 47:13.220
of Windows, whatever they call it, had apps kind of, Palm had it, Blackberry, but the

47:13.220 --> 47:17.020
carriers got all the money, it was awful if you were an app developer.

47:17.020 --> 47:27.860
So Apple in the 70s, 30s, it really revolutionized that and I also think that the iPhone and

47:27.860 --> 47:35.300
that development model has actually empowered frankly a generation of developers such as

47:35.300 --> 47:41.460
myself who really would not have been able to do any of this stuff, right?

47:41.460 --> 47:49.580
I mean people whine about making money online today, making money on the internet in 2008-2010

47:49.580 --> 47:51.460
was not too good, right?

47:51.460 --> 47:54.420
Trying to monetize a website then was not super easy either.

47:54.420 --> 47:58.580
Right, or trying to make money living selling a Windows app was nearly impossible because

47:58.580 --> 48:02.140
you didn't have distribution mechanisms, it was hard to reach the audience.

48:02.140 --> 48:06.540
Right, Mac was slightly better but you really had to get like a Jim Dowell or someone like

48:06.540 --> 48:09.740
that to basically promote you.

48:09.740 --> 48:10.740
Yeah, right about it.

48:10.740 --> 48:18.860
And if you didn't, you were screwed because who's going to go to ChrisApps.com and give

48:18.860 --> 48:24.580
you their credit card or PayPal you some money and buy your app back then, no?

48:24.580 --> 48:25.580
Really.

48:25.580 --> 48:26.740
Yeah, I agree.

48:26.740 --> 48:33.900
So thinking back, I think the hint was that there was a hacking community that was developing

48:33.900 --> 48:38.340
around the iPhone to jailbreak it and install their own side apps but we were also being

48:38.340 --> 48:40.860
told all the time, hey, you know what, we got these web apps and they're going to be

48:40.860 --> 48:46.340
a great way to run apps on a phone and there was sort of that battle to be had and that's

48:46.340 --> 48:49.540
also what WebOS came with is, hey, we're going to have web apps, this is a great way to do

48:49.540 --> 48:50.540
it.

48:50.540 --> 48:51.540
Ubuntu phone tried that as well.

48:51.540 --> 48:55.040
So we had to watch that battle play out to see if that would work or would it require

48:55.040 --> 49:01.880
native apps but I think what we learned was when you combine a distribution mechanism,

49:01.880 --> 49:06.940
when you create a point where people know to go to find the application and then you

49:06.940 --> 49:11.900
iterate on the features of the platform so you encourage users to keep upgrading like

49:11.900 --> 49:19.480
faster CPUs, improved GPS, improved camera, improved cell phone modem speed, now of course

49:19.480 --> 49:24.500
all the things are doing like better screens, larger screens, AR, they're trying to continue

49:24.500 --> 49:28.700
that on but early on in the process, there were fundamental improvements.

49:28.700 --> 49:33.820
The first iPhone didn't ship with an app store and it didn't even ship with 3G.

49:33.820 --> 49:36.700
It was an old edge phone.

49:36.700 --> 49:37.940
It just was crazy.

49:37.940 --> 49:39.580
It was crazy.

49:39.580 --> 49:43.260
And then they iterated on that and Android also did very quickly and you got to give

49:43.260 --> 49:44.260
Google some credit.

49:44.260 --> 49:47.220
Like they started out so, so rough.

49:47.220 --> 49:50.580
I forget what it was, was it the Android market before it was called the Play Store and it

49:50.580 --> 49:51.580
was so bad.

49:51.580 --> 49:52.580
And...

49:52.580 --> 49:53.580
Yeah, the Android marketplace.

49:53.580 --> 49:54.580
Yeah.

49:54.580 --> 49:55.580
Yeah.

49:55.580 --> 49:59.180
And they iterated pretty quickly and they launched the Play APIs and they really started

49:59.180 --> 50:00.580
to solve some problems.

50:00.580 --> 50:05.380
I mean, looking back at it, what now looks like a breakneck pace, back then it felt like

50:05.380 --> 50:07.900
we were waiting forever to get these features.

50:07.900 --> 50:11.340
But now you look back at it and go, wow, they really hustled to get up to feature parity.

50:11.340 --> 50:16.540
And so the Android platform very doggedly did that as the iOS platform continued on

50:16.540 --> 50:22.340
and they both offered this new thing which wasn't available really to developers at least

50:22.340 --> 50:27.220
to any wide capacity and that is a centralized app store with a review mechanism, a payment

50:27.220 --> 50:31.100
mechanism so I didn't have to give payments information to each freaking developer for

50:31.100 --> 50:33.020
each app I want to buy.

50:33.020 --> 50:40.080
And they set up these OSs in a way that I, as an end user, not even having to understand

50:40.080 --> 50:45.980
how sandboxing works, somehow know that I can load these phones up with these apps and

50:45.980 --> 50:50.400
it's not gonna trash my system like it would slow down an old Mac or an old Windows box.

50:50.400 --> 50:53.540
So there was a lower level of risk for users to experiment.

50:53.540 --> 50:57.420
I didn't have to give payment information out a thousand times and it was just one tap

50:57.420 --> 50:59.660
to delete it and I could leave them a bad review.

50:59.660 --> 51:03.540
And so the barrier of entry was lower for developers, it was lower for end users, and

51:03.540 --> 51:05.380
it was just like adding fuel to a fire.

51:05.380 --> 51:09.980
And I think that's why it worked, I just think that's why when you say it enabled a new generation

51:09.980 --> 51:12.580
of developers, I think that's one of the reasons it works so well.

51:12.580 --> 51:15.140
And what the hell is gonna come along that replace that?

51:15.140 --> 51:17.860
How do you top that?

51:17.860 --> 51:18.860
I can't imagine.

51:18.860 --> 51:20.900
It's gonna be coming eventually.

51:20.900 --> 51:29.540
Well, yeah, I mean, we argue about this all the time, right?

51:29.540 --> 51:38.060
I think, and this is where these chapter marks are gonna come in handy, I think we have been

51:38.060 --> 51:44.740
a little negative on Apple because looking back, Apple's done a lot of dumb things, right?

51:44.740 --> 51:47.980
Like when they decide they wanna impose their own like social mores and blah, blah, blah

51:47.980 --> 51:53.300
on people and they overreact and like start ripping out Civil War video games or educational

51:53.300 --> 51:58.860
programs because they don't like whatever, that's too much.

51:58.860 --> 52:06.180
But the idea of an open marketplace, because the App Store is relatively open, right?

52:06.180 --> 52:10.980
They do bad things, I've had issues, we had the thing where they took down, they unfutured

52:10.980 --> 52:15.740
Coder Radio and we said something they didn't like, right?

52:15.740 --> 52:18.100
But that is just human nature.

52:18.100 --> 52:26.180
And I remember back to what it was like before the App Store, it was so much worse.

52:26.180 --> 52:30.940
So when you say, where are we going, well, I think the future looks like the past.

52:30.940 --> 52:36.380
I look at Echo apps, not apps, but Echo skills.

52:36.380 --> 52:42.580
And I look at the monetization story there, I look at, if I was in college, if it was

52:42.580 --> 52:49.460
10 years ago and I wanted to just write younger version of me, right?

52:49.460 --> 52:54.500
Mike today, who's in college, just getting out of college, starting a business, what's

52:54.500 --> 52:56.460
going to happen?

52:56.460 --> 52:59.580
Well I don't know how that Mike makes any money.

52:59.580 --> 53:04.020
I mean sure you can do consulting and you can build Echo skills for other people, but

53:04.020 --> 53:08.340
the pool of people who are going to want you to do that is going to be much lower because

53:08.340 --> 53:09.900
there's no way to really monetize it.

53:09.900 --> 53:15.460
I know, I understand that Amazon does send checks to people, but that's a little more

53:15.460 --> 53:19.920
than Jeff, Mr. Bezos' grace, right?

53:19.920 --> 53:22.220
There's no like, like again-

53:22.220 --> 53:24.620
There's no full-time strategy there.

53:24.620 --> 53:32.660
We rightly beat up on Apple, but the norm of you having a backend that you log into

53:32.660 --> 53:37.260
to the platform vendor site and they give you how many sales you have, where they came

53:37.260 --> 53:41.780
from, what the conversion rate was, foreign currency, what your year to date is, what

53:41.780 --> 53:48.740
your monthly is, and when your next wire transfer is coming in, that is, if you did any kind

53:48.740 --> 53:53.140
of like Blackberry development, what I just described is heaven, right?

53:53.140 --> 53:57.520
iTunes Connect, for all its warts, was absolutely revolutionary.

53:57.520 --> 54:03.580
The idea that the individual developer could, and I understand, and again, you can play

54:03.580 --> 54:13.060
tapes of myself criticizing Apple, but more or less be on an open plane, a flat plane

54:13.060 --> 54:19.060
against larger companies or larger developers, is something that did not exist until Apple

54:19.060 --> 54:20.700
made it happen, right?

54:20.700 --> 54:24.820
Your best bet in the past was you do some kind of freeware, shareware version, and you

54:24.820 --> 54:29.220
know, like Diablo 1, you try to monetize it after the fact, but then you have piracy and

54:29.220 --> 54:32.700
you basically made no money.

54:32.700 --> 54:37.940
What I'm worried about is I see all the, like I think Echo skills are amazing.

54:37.940 --> 54:44.380
I think these voice assistants, I think bots, I think all this stuff is going to be huge.

54:44.380 --> 54:47.860
Making money on this stuff is very, very hard.

54:47.860 --> 54:53.020
It looks like the strategy is going to have to be a holistic one of the bot or the skill,

54:53.020 --> 54:54.020
whichever term you prefer.

54:54.020 --> 55:02.500
I tend to think that the skills are actually just a form of bot, but is not your product.

55:02.500 --> 55:08.700
It is another box you have to tick as part of your entire go-to-market strategy, right?

55:08.700 --> 55:13.260
And you have to monetize your service in some other way, whether that be consulting or you

55:13.260 --> 55:17.780
have like a, you know,

55:17.780 --> 55:18.780
Crypto miner.

55:18.780 --> 55:19.780
Yeah.

55:19.780 --> 55:20.780
Perhaps not.

55:20.780 --> 55:25.140
Maybe not the Bitcoin, but you got what I'm saying, right Chris?

55:25.140 --> 55:26.140
Or am I off the rails?

55:26.140 --> 55:27.140
No, I totally follow you.

55:27.140 --> 55:28.140
I like it.

55:28.140 --> 55:33.220
And it's the accumulation of really five years of reflecting on this stuff.

55:33.220 --> 55:35.860
And actually you're not just reflecting on it, you're actually out there working at trying

55:35.860 --> 55:37.260
to make it successful.

55:37.260 --> 55:40.780
And I totally follow like, how would new Mike start today?

55:40.780 --> 55:41.980
I wondered that about Chris too.

55:41.980 --> 55:43.300
How would new Chris start today?

55:43.300 --> 55:45.000
I don't know how to make it work.

55:45.000 --> 55:46.980
So we just got to keep doing what we're doing, I guess.

55:46.980 --> 55:49.580
I guess we just do this for another five years, Mike.

55:49.580 --> 55:50.580
That's the solution.

55:50.580 --> 55:51.580
Here's to another 300.

55:51.580 --> 55:52.580
Yes.

55:52.580 --> 55:55.180
