00:00.000 --> 00:11.000
This is KOTOR Radio, episode 405 for September 26, 2022.

00:11.000 --> 00:20.160
Hello, friends, and welcome into Jupiter Broadcasting's weekly talk show, taking a pragmatic look

00:20.160 --> 00:24.920
at the art and business of software development and the world of technology.

00:24.920 --> 00:29.800
From Sacramento, California, my name is Chris, and joining us from his podcasting base, it's

00:29.800 --> 00:31.120
our host, Mr. Dominic.

00:31.120 --> 00:32.120
Hello, Mike.

00:32.120 --> 00:33.120
Hello, Chris.

00:33.120 --> 00:35.120
How are you in sunny CA?

00:35.120 --> 00:36.120
Warm.

00:36.120 --> 00:37.120
It is warm here.

00:37.120 --> 00:39.760
It is like in the mid-90s, you know?

00:39.760 --> 00:42.960
So I'm getting like a little last little surge of summer, but we're doing all right because

00:42.960 --> 00:47.760
listener Jeff hooked us up with a great little spot and some power hookups, so I got the

00:47.760 --> 00:49.240
air conditioners going.

00:49.240 --> 00:50.920
I really can't complain.

00:50.920 --> 00:54.720
You know, it's pretty comfortable as far as mid-90s go.

00:54.720 --> 00:55.720
And it's been a good trip.

00:55.720 --> 00:59.240
We've already done two of the meetups, so we're halfway done, and that's been really

00:59.240 --> 01:00.240
exciting.

01:00.240 --> 01:02.040
They've gone well.

01:02.040 --> 01:06.040
At one of them, I got there early and managed to get a whole dinner, too, which was great.

01:06.040 --> 01:10.300
You know, a little barbecue, and we're doing breweries the whole way, so there's always

01:10.300 --> 01:11.300
great drinks.

01:11.300 --> 01:12.300
Nice.

01:12.300 --> 01:13.300
Yeah.

01:13.300 --> 01:14.300
Yeah.

01:14.300 --> 01:19.480
Our next meetup is this Friday as we release 6 p.m. at the Congregation Ale House in Pasadena,

01:19.480 --> 01:23.920
which will be just after our JPL meetup, so there's just so much going on.

01:23.920 --> 01:25.800
I have been running nonstop.

01:25.800 --> 01:31.240
I'm talking like getting up at 3.45 a.m., 3.30 a.m., 6 a.m. since we got off the air

01:31.240 --> 01:32.720
last week.

01:32.720 --> 01:35.080
It's been a mad dash.

01:35.080 --> 01:39.520
Vacation it is not, but guess what?

01:39.520 --> 01:45.480
We did get an email into the show, and it's a little spicy, so why don't we just kick

01:45.480 --> 01:46.720
the show off with a spicy take?

01:46.720 --> 01:47.720
Let's do some spice.

01:47.720 --> 01:53.120
Thrill 64, or I'm sorry, Thrill 46 via Matrix wrote in, hey, Mike and Chris, long time first

01:53.120 --> 01:55.280
time, have I been duped?

01:55.280 --> 02:00.160
I bought a PinePhone Pro, and the Rock Pro 64, and I own a PineBook Pro.

02:00.160 --> 02:01.480
Wow, you're all in.

02:01.480 --> 02:05.280
And all of them have been sold as basically developer editions.

02:05.280 --> 02:09.720
I bought them thinking an army of developers would be creating software for these devices,

02:09.720 --> 02:13.860
and then soon after we'd see a generation of consumer devices ship that would create

02:13.860 --> 02:15.480
a user base.

02:15.480 --> 02:20.160
Here we are, years later, and most everything they make is still in beta mode.

02:20.160 --> 02:23.840
I'm not sure anything is close to mainstream adoption, and I feel silly for buying these

02:23.840 --> 02:26.320
quote developer devices.

02:26.320 --> 02:28.040
Developer for who?

02:28.040 --> 02:30.720
Has it all been a scam?

02:30.720 --> 02:31.720
Is it a scam?

02:31.720 --> 02:32.720
No, right?

02:32.720 --> 02:33.720
It's not a scam.

02:33.720 --> 02:40.200
It's really, really hard to start a developer ecosystem in the age of the giant, shall we

02:40.200 --> 02:44.360
say, oligopoly ecosystems that exist.

02:44.360 --> 02:51.040
And I kind of think the PineBook, I don't know much about the phone, but I feel like

02:51.040 --> 02:54.640
a lot of the energy behind the PineBook has kind of been taken by the framework laptop

02:54.640 --> 02:56.720
too in recent years.

02:56.720 --> 03:00.480
Is that a fair assessment, Chris, of the kind of the tinkerer crowd?

03:00.480 --> 03:02.560
Yeah, I could see that.

03:02.560 --> 03:06.920
The dream of the PineBook was that Rock Pro 64 platform.

03:06.920 --> 03:11.400
I kind of feel what they're saying here.

03:11.400 --> 03:18.120
For example, they're selling the PinePhone Pro Explorer Edition, but it really isn't

03:18.120 --> 03:22.420
any more refined than the previous PinePhone that wasn't a pro that they called a developer

03:22.420 --> 03:23.420
edition.

03:23.420 --> 03:24.560
Like nothing really changed.

03:24.560 --> 03:27.280
The software state is really kind of the same.

03:27.280 --> 03:31.400
And they kind of always wave it away by saying, with a little note on there, say, well, you

03:31.400 --> 03:33.760
know, we're really transparent and upfront.

03:33.760 --> 03:38.880
The PinePhone Pro Explorer Edition is aimed at Linux developers with extensive knowledge

03:38.880 --> 03:42.280
of embedded systems or experience on mobile Linux.

03:42.280 --> 03:43.280
And I kind of see what he's saying.

03:43.280 --> 03:47.240
It's like they always are promising, well, these are for the developers today.

03:47.240 --> 03:50.760
Look at your hands on it, and then later down the road, we'll make better versions that

03:50.760 --> 03:55.280
regular people can buy, normals, except for that never comes.

03:55.280 --> 03:59.100
It's just this perpetual beta for all of the products.

03:59.100 --> 04:02.300
And it's kind of like they've just come up with this way of saying, well, but if we just

04:02.300 --> 04:06.760
tell them it's just aimed at early adopters, then it's fine that it's not ever a complete

04:06.760 --> 04:08.120
product.

04:08.120 --> 04:09.120
Maybe that's true.

04:09.120 --> 04:10.120
Maybe.

04:10.120 --> 04:14.760
But, you know, all right, this could have happened with other platforms, too, right?

04:14.760 --> 04:19.720
And I feel like if you're jumping in super early, you're taking the risk reward of, I'm

04:19.720 --> 04:24.840
coming in super early, probably going to be a nothing burger, this new platform.

04:24.840 --> 04:29.840
But if it does take off, then I'm in there on the ground floor, right?

04:29.840 --> 04:34.760
And you could really, if you're a developer yourself, for the writer, take huge advantage

04:34.760 --> 04:35.760
of that.

04:35.760 --> 04:39.440
And if you're a user, well, then, you know, you get to be one of the first users on the

04:39.440 --> 04:41.540
platform, which is kind of cool.

04:41.540 --> 04:45.120
Having said that, but basically, if you're looking for like an App Store ecosystem, I

04:45.120 --> 04:47.760
don't think you're going to get that.

04:47.760 --> 04:53.480
I do think the alternative to the big oligopolies or the duopoly is going to be like the web,

04:53.480 --> 04:54.480
right?

04:54.480 --> 04:55.480
PWAs or...

04:55.480 --> 04:56.480
Yeah.

04:56.480 --> 04:58.480
I still have dreams about WebAssembly.

04:58.480 --> 05:03.840
More, you know, literally websites, right?

05:03.840 --> 05:06.920
Web apps that are just posted somewhere.

05:06.920 --> 05:09.540
The future, you mean?

05:09.540 --> 05:11.920
The future is 2006.

05:11.920 --> 05:16.400
You know, one thing that does strike me, Kyron, I'm probably saying that, Kyron, actually,

05:16.400 --> 05:20.240
in the matrix chat says, developing for the PinePhone is a nightmare.

05:20.240 --> 05:22.720
All of the OS providers have done things differently.

05:22.720 --> 05:24.760
Yeah, give that a ding.

05:24.760 --> 05:29.680
I wrote a hack for Posh that meant that the phone would wake on call properly, but it

05:29.680 --> 05:32.540
only works on Mobian and postmarket OS.

05:32.540 --> 05:33.760
Everything else is weird.

05:33.760 --> 05:37.560
The battle between Qt and Gnome is one that needs to be won as well.

05:37.560 --> 05:40.320
That's also a great point.

05:40.320 --> 05:45.520
That tear between GTK and Qt on mobile is even more acute.

05:45.520 --> 05:50.140
And there's a lot of effort on both sides, and they're not really super compatible environments

05:50.140 --> 05:52.360
in terms of look, flow, and feel.

05:52.360 --> 05:54.600
Like Pine could never, never make...

05:54.600 --> 05:55.600
They could never pull that off.

05:55.600 --> 05:57.680
Right, they're not going to be able to change that.

05:57.680 --> 06:01.960
So they have to wait for upstream, and upstream is too busy fighting between toolkits, and

06:01.960 --> 06:05.960
they're not really fighting, but they're just too busy really doing their own things to

06:05.960 --> 06:09.240
make something cohesive that a hardware manufacturer like Pine could ship.

06:09.240 --> 06:13.520
Right, so this sounds like the Android fragmentation issues on steroids, basically.

06:13.520 --> 06:14.520
I think so.

06:14.520 --> 06:19.200
I mean, over time, things in Android have gotten better, but that took the commercial

06:19.200 --> 06:26.080
hands of Google to work with vendors, to create the Treble project, to work on the AB boot

06:26.080 --> 06:27.080
system.

06:27.080 --> 06:29.040
You know, it's funny.

06:29.040 --> 06:35.840
Last night, Listener Jeff and I flashed my Pixel 3 to Graphene OS, which is an alternative

06:35.840 --> 06:36.840
Google-free...

06:36.840 --> 06:38.840
Did you get any beads?

06:38.840 --> 06:39.840
No.

06:39.840 --> 06:43.840
Maybe once I get a few more apps working, that's when I unlock the beads.

06:43.840 --> 06:44.840
It's not bad, man.

06:44.840 --> 06:45.840
It's not bad.

06:45.840 --> 06:48.800
You know, you're definitely limited without Google Play services.

06:48.800 --> 06:51.560
But if you wanted just a basic smartphone with some...

06:51.560 --> 06:53.440
You know, I mean, there's F-Droid and Aurora Store.

06:53.440 --> 06:54.440
There's some...

06:54.440 --> 06:55.440
I have Nextcloud on here.

06:55.440 --> 06:56.440
I've got VLC.

06:56.440 --> 06:58.840
I've got K9 Mail, Element Chat.

06:58.840 --> 07:03.000
I've got an open source fork of Telegram.

07:03.000 --> 07:07.440
I've got a Chrome fork that's de-Googled.

07:07.440 --> 07:11.320
I got an open source keyboard that's pretty good.

07:11.320 --> 07:14.720
You know, honestly, it's not that bad.

07:14.720 --> 07:15.800
They can really do something with it.

07:15.800 --> 07:17.920
I don't know how far they can really ever get away from Google.

07:17.920 --> 07:20.240
They're always going to be subject to Google.

07:20.240 --> 07:22.440
But this just seems like the way we should have gone.

07:22.440 --> 07:25.540
This is where the community should have focused, is things like Graphene OS.

07:25.540 --> 07:27.160
We should have just acknowledged it.

07:27.160 --> 07:31.600
I don't know if these Linux-native environments or this Linux-native hardware, like the Pine

07:31.600 --> 07:36.000
stuff, is ever going to have more than a few thousand users, you know, tens of thousands

07:36.000 --> 07:37.000
of users at most.

07:37.000 --> 07:39.360
It's just never going to get that...

07:39.360 --> 07:40.720
It's never going to get that critical mass.

07:40.720 --> 07:42.000
I've just had to come to accept that.

07:42.000 --> 07:45.200
And so now I'm kind of looking at things like Graphene OS and thinking, boy, we probably

07:45.200 --> 07:46.840
should have just gone this way all along.

07:46.840 --> 07:49.020
I'm still waiting for my Firefox phone.

07:49.020 --> 07:50.120
Are you getting a 14?

07:50.120 --> 07:51.120
Did you tell...

07:51.120 --> 07:52.120
Are you skipping it?

07:52.120 --> 07:53.120
I am...

07:53.120 --> 07:55.880
I mean, I'm not getting one now, right?

07:55.880 --> 07:57.680
You know, I could always drop my phone.

07:57.680 --> 08:02.280
Now, why haven't you just gotten their upgrade program?

08:02.280 --> 08:04.080
You know, I've been avoiding the upgrades.

08:04.080 --> 08:05.640
I'm still on a 12 Pro.

08:05.640 --> 08:08.360
I bet you that upgrade program would be a write-off for you.

08:08.360 --> 08:16.240
It would, but honestly, the last time I upgraded, I think I upgraded from an 11 to a 12 Pro.

08:16.240 --> 08:22.160
And I screwed up one of my TFA apps, and that created such a hassle.

08:22.160 --> 08:27.400
So I use my phone as an actual phone slash overcast player.

08:27.400 --> 08:29.360
I just don't care that much, right?

08:29.360 --> 08:33.420
I am noticing the battery health over the two and a half years, whatever it's been,

08:33.420 --> 08:35.900
it's telling me it's 80% now.

08:35.900 --> 08:40.400
If I got one, I think I'd want the Max in purple, which one is...

08:40.400 --> 08:41.920
I did have one in the car.

08:41.920 --> 08:50.040
I did look, but it's late October, and it's also like $1,100.

08:50.040 --> 08:51.800
So it just doesn't feel worth it to me.

08:51.800 --> 08:52.800
How about you?

08:52.800 --> 08:53.800
Or you're on the upgrade thing, aren't you?

08:53.800 --> 08:54.800
Yeah, I decided to do it.

08:54.800 --> 08:58.200
But I actually intentionally waited because I don't want it to arrive until end of October

08:58.200 --> 08:59.200
because I'm on this trip.

08:59.200 --> 09:00.200
Right.

09:00.200 --> 09:01.200
Yeah, I think it's...

09:01.200 --> 09:02.800
You know, they got me...

09:02.800 --> 09:05.560
They'll almost always get me with the camera.

09:05.560 --> 09:08.520
And they got me with the satellite calling.

09:08.520 --> 09:11.400
And then I'm actually downsizing, so I think I'm actually going to save a little bit of

09:11.400 --> 09:15.920
money because the payment scales to the size of phone you get.

09:15.920 --> 09:18.440
But we'll see.

09:18.440 --> 09:19.440
We'll see.

09:19.440 --> 09:20.440
Maybe Graphene OS will work out.

09:20.440 --> 09:22.360
I'm skeptical, but I am hopeful.

09:22.360 --> 09:23.360
I really like...

09:23.360 --> 09:28.000
The original Pixel 3 is the perfect size phone.

09:28.000 --> 09:29.000
It's perfect.

09:29.000 --> 09:30.480
It fits in my hand so well.

09:30.480 --> 09:31.720
It fits in my pocket.

09:31.720 --> 09:33.120
It's a little tall.

09:33.120 --> 09:34.740
It's a little narrow.

09:34.740 --> 09:37.280
It's such a thing of beauty.

09:37.280 --> 09:39.160
I think it might be the best Pixel ever.

09:39.160 --> 09:40.160
The Pixel 3, not the 3a.

09:40.160 --> 09:42.360
The 3a is fine, but I have the Pixel 3.

09:42.360 --> 09:46.980
I'm telling you, if I could replace the battery in this and be happy with Graphene OS, I would

09:46.980 --> 09:48.480
try to make this my primary phone.

09:48.480 --> 09:50.800
It's just such a beautiful size.

09:50.800 --> 09:51.800
So I'm hopeful.

09:51.800 --> 09:52.800
We'll see.

09:52.800 --> 09:57.160
Maybe the iPhone 14 will be my last iPhone.

09:57.160 --> 09:58.640
Here's my spicy prediction.

09:58.640 --> 09:59.640
Nope.

09:59.640 --> 10:00.640
Yeah.

10:00.640 --> 10:06.160
I think you're probably right on that one.

10:06.160 --> 10:07.900
Linode.com slash coder.

10:07.900 --> 10:11.400
Go there to get $100 in 60-day credit on a new account, and it's just a great way to

10:11.400 --> 10:12.880
support the show.

10:12.880 --> 10:16.640
Linode makes cloud computing simple, affordable, and accessible.

10:16.640 --> 10:18.680
Linode is our cloud hosting provider.

10:18.680 --> 10:21.800
It's where we deploy everything we've built in the last few years.

10:21.800 --> 10:27.160
And we love the fact that Linode's performance, price, and support are all there just the

10:27.160 --> 10:28.360
way we like them.

10:28.360 --> 10:31.640
And we love the fact that you can tell they're Linux geeks too.

10:31.640 --> 10:35.000
That's really what got them to build Linode nearly 19 years ago.

10:35.000 --> 10:38.960
And now today, here they are 30% to 50% cheaper than the hyperscalers out there that have

10:38.960 --> 10:43.340
really specific platforms with specific features and languages that really just want to lock

10:43.340 --> 10:44.340
you in.

10:44.340 --> 10:46.620
Linode's an alternative cloud provider.

10:46.620 --> 10:49.480
They have infrastructure, 11 data centers around the world.

10:49.480 --> 10:51.400
They are their own ISP.

10:51.400 --> 10:54.820
They have a fully functional, clean, easy to use API.

10:54.820 --> 10:59.220
They integrate with your infrastructure management, and they can give you a full Linux platform

10:59.220 --> 11:00.220
that you can manage.

11:00.220 --> 11:04.720
And on top of that, they have one click deployment applications that are really simple.

11:04.720 --> 11:08.120
And they have a bunch of great services on the back end that you might want to use too.

11:08.120 --> 11:12.580
I personally, I use the snot out of the S3 storage.

11:12.580 --> 11:15.840
They have S3 compatible object storage.

11:15.840 --> 11:18.000
And I've just discovered yet another use for it.

11:18.000 --> 11:21.920
I have Duplicati, which is a great Linux backup application.

11:21.920 --> 11:25.880
And you can just point it directly at S3 object storage like Linodes.

11:25.880 --> 11:28.860
And it's just so fantastic the flexibility you get with that.

11:28.860 --> 11:33.720
You combine that with the API and the command line client that lets you easily create buckets

11:33.720 --> 11:35.640
and move files around.

11:35.640 --> 11:38.640
It's just a great way to share files in general for us here at JP.

11:38.640 --> 11:42.700
But on top of that, the performance of their systems is just absolutely fantastic.

11:42.700 --> 11:47.620
If you Google search cloud CPU benchmarks and you look at the results that Linode has put

11:47.620 --> 11:51.560
out from an independent study provider, but Linode is hosting it up on their website,

11:51.560 --> 11:56.140
the report reveals how the different VPSs and cloud providers stack up and how much

11:56.140 --> 11:58.600
faster Linode systems are.

11:58.600 --> 11:59.600
It's a great report.

11:59.600 --> 12:01.080
It's from Cloud Spectator.

12:01.080 --> 12:04.840
It's their CPU benchmark report.

12:04.840 --> 12:08.160
You can go look that up, or you can go find it on Linode's website, and you can see how

12:08.160 --> 12:09.840
Linode's performance stacks up.

12:09.840 --> 12:13.960
When you combine that with PCIe MVMe storage, the fact that they are their own ISP means

12:13.960 --> 12:16.600
their connections scream, right?

12:16.600 --> 12:19.920
And then you realize the pricing.

12:19.920 --> 12:22.240
It all comes together with Linode.

12:22.240 --> 12:23.240
That's why we use it.

12:23.240 --> 12:24.280
I think you'll love it.

12:24.280 --> 12:25.280
Go try it out.

12:25.280 --> 12:26.540
It's fast, reliable cloud hosting.

12:26.540 --> 12:28.800
You got to try it for yourself or your next project.

12:28.800 --> 12:32.840
So go get that $100, support the show, and kick the tires for yourself.

12:32.840 --> 12:35.320
Linode.com slash coder.

12:35.320 --> 12:40.480
That's linode.com slash coder.

12:40.480 --> 12:43.640
All right, Mr. Dominic, you are back on the Linux train.

12:43.640 --> 12:48.540
Been using it for just over a month full time, I believe, you've gotten some hardware.

12:48.540 --> 12:52.600
So I think that's definitely played a factor, the Dev1 and the Thalia, which we'll talk

12:52.600 --> 12:54.300
about in a little bit.

12:54.300 --> 12:59.760
So tell me what it's been like living the Linux life full time again.

12:59.760 --> 13:01.200
It's been pretty smooth.

13:01.200 --> 13:06.880
I'm living that pop OS life, the Thalia, of course, and the Dev1 come pre-installed with

13:06.880 --> 13:08.360
it.

13:08.360 --> 13:13.880
I am mastering the tiling keyboard shortcuts, which is just a much better way to handle

13:13.880 --> 13:16.960
the whole tiling thing in PATH.

13:16.960 --> 13:18.560
I'm liking it.

13:18.560 --> 13:19.560
You know, it's funny.

13:19.560 --> 13:24.580
I was getting irritated with Monterey, Mac OS Monterey, and some of the weird changes

13:24.580 --> 13:32.080
that Mac continues to make to the Unix tools because they have to.

13:32.080 --> 13:33.080
I don't know why.

13:33.080 --> 13:34.080
Right.

13:34.080 --> 13:35.080
They always they always are making changes.

13:35.080 --> 13:37.920
They're always making like strange Apple specific things.

13:37.920 --> 13:41.480
I think a lot of it has to do with their developer tool chain goes through Xcode.

13:41.480 --> 13:46.880
Every time you update Xcode, crazy shit happens to like your C headers.

13:46.880 --> 13:51.400
But yeah, so decided I try it out again.

13:51.400 --> 13:56.960
And honestly, a big factor in me purchasing this Thalia was I did briefly try a review

13:56.960 --> 14:05.160
unit and I kind of missed Tactical Strategy RPGs and of course, MTG Arena, which also

14:05.160 --> 14:10.200
runs on Mac, but I love it so far.

14:10.200 --> 14:11.440
I mean, it's been very good.

14:11.440 --> 14:12.480
I wrote a review of it.

14:12.480 --> 14:15.160
It's pretty it's pretty fast.

14:15.160 --> 14:21.880
It's I mean, it's got to be the fastest machine I've ever owned for day to day.

14:21.880 --> 14:22.880
What I do.

14:22.880 --> 14:26.280
Well, starting with the Linux side, the Pop OS side.

14:26.280 --> 14:31.600
The only thing I'm noticing is some of the more interesting newer tools, like in particular

14:31.600 --> 14:37.240
warp terminal, don't have Linux versions.

14:37.240 --> 14:42.840
And that's been kind of a minor annoyance.

14:42.840 --> 14:50.280
Having said that, the version of Bash on, I think I'm on 2204, does auto complete significantly

14:50.280 --> 14:53.360
better than the version of Zshell on Mac OS.

14:53.360 --> 14:56.840
So it's less of a hole in my day to day life, but it's still there.

14:56.840 --> 15:00.440
I mean, every once in a while I'll get the like some of the JetBrains tools.

15:00.440 --> 15:04.200
I feel like they render the fonts too smally.

15:04.200 --> 15:06.480
But other than that, I mean, I have been very happy.

15:06.480 --> 15:12.120
I have notably not installed any additional extensions on GNOME, because I just decided

15:12.120 --> 15:15.080
to avoid that problem and stick with one desktop background.

15:15.080 --> 15:17.560
Have you ever played around with the fish show?

15:17.560 --> 15:18.560
I have.

15:18.560 --> 15:19.560
We covered it like for.

15:19.560 --> 15:20.560
Yeah.

15:20.560 --> 15:21.560
OK.

15:21.560 --> 15:22.560
Yeah.

15:22.560 --> 15:23.560
Yeah.

15:23.560 --> 15:24.560
I mean, that's pretty great on Linux.

15:24.560 --> 15:25.560
You know, a lot of good auto completion in there and stuff like that.

15:25.560 --> 15:26.560
It's great.

15:26.560 --> 15:27.560
But I'm lazy.

15:27.560 --> 15:28.560
Right.

15:28.560 --> 15:29.560
Yeah.

15:29.560 --> 15:30.560
I'm having a I am having a tougher time with pop.

15:30.560 --> 15:35.440
I mean, I love our friends over at System 76, but I am having a I have I have a harder

15:35.440 --> 15:39.840
time because I've been using traditional GNOME for a while now.

15:39.840 --> 15:44.840
So switching back to cosmic and like not having the gestures to swipe to horizontal workspaces

15:44.840 --> 15:48.840
I have found has been a little tricky because one of the things that I have really ingrained

15:48.840 --> 15:54.280
with my GNOME shell usage is every major application window should probably have its own virtual

15:54.280 --> 15:55.280
desktop.

15:55.280 --> 15:58.640
And that's really doable on like a laptop screen when you're swiping sideways between

15:58.640 --> 15:59.640
virtual desktops.

15:59.640 --> 16:03.960
And I just kind of I find that workflow falls down with the cosmic layout.

16:03.960 --> 16:09.000
But so you've been so you've you've now you've been using desktop Linux on the dev one.

16:09.000 --> 16:10.720
You've now used it on the Thalia, which is a beast.

16:10.720 --> 16:14.800
I'll talk more about my experience with the Thalia because I got one for review as well.

16:14.800 --> 16:16.960
And I ran a ton of tests against it.

16:16.960 --> 16:22.120
But I'm just curious to to just get to capture what is it for you that or is there a difference

16:22.120 --> 16:26.760
between using desktop Linux on the dev one and using desktop Linux on the Thalia?

16:26.760 --> 16:28.280
Just the form factor differences.

16:28.280 --> 16:29.280
Anything.

16:29.280 --> 16:32.300
I was thinking actually in performance and if you can feel a difference, if you can tell

16:32.300 --> 16:36.620
between the hardware or if it kind of the interface is just sort of fast, regardless,

16:36.620 --> 16:37.760
just that kind of impressions.

16:37.760 --> 16:40.080
I mean, the dev one is pretty fast.

16:40.080 --> 16:43.360
I would say this is kind of horrible.

16:43.360 --> 16:45.320
This is maybe damning with faint praise.

16:45.320 --> 16:50.120
But the reason I'm able to use the dev one instead of a MacBook finally as my day to

16:50.120 --> 16:56.340
day driver for a laptop, you know, when I'm like working at a bar, coffee shop or whatever

16:56.340 --> 17:02.200
is or even just like in my kitchen because six year old the speakers, the onboard speakers

17:02.200 --> 17:05.020
don't make me want to stab myself in the ears.

17:05.020 --> 17:07.920
They are the they're the best Linux laptop speakers, I think.

17:07.920 --> 17:08.920
Right.

17:08.920 --> 17:11.840
Which I would even say like I had the Gen one XPS and then I had a later generation

17:11.840 --> 17:16.680
XPS was not the case.

17:16.680 --> 17:20.180
You know, I kind of use the Thalia of different things, right?

17:20.180 --> 17:21.740
Like the dev one.

17:21.740 --> 17:25.640
It's kind of sad because I spent well, we could you have the link in the notes where

17:25.640 --> 17:30.160
you can see the neo fetch for the Thalia spent like twenty one, twenty two hundred on the

17:30.160 --> 17:32.080
Thalia.

17:32.080 --> 17:35.880
And I use it a lot less than I do the dev one.

17:35.880 --> 17:37.400
Ah, sure.

17:37.400 --> 17:41.740
But when I'm using it, it's definitely heavier workloads.

17:41.740 --> 17:47.680
It's usually something where I'm, you know, using a Windows client application that we

17:47.680 --> 17:54.120
developed, hooking into a local host version of some Python or Ruby API that we wrote running

17:54.120 --> 17:56.580
on the Linux host VM, right?

17:56.580 --> 17:58.160
So it's like a Windows 10.

17:58.160 --> 18:02.960
I'm still using Windows 10 for my VM because, you know, why not?

18:02.960 --> 18:08.680
And a Linux and the pop OS host to do local API testing without, you know, touching the

18:08.680 --> 18:12.960
actual database on a staging server or production.

18:12.960 --> 18:14.520
I think that's great.

18:14.520 --> 18:17.200
I mean, I like that workflow.

18:17.200 --> 18:20.960
That's a little much to ask of the dev one, I feel.

18:20.960 --> 18:24.080
Though I'm sure it's possible it would just lag a bit, right?

18:24.080 --> 18:27.040
Yeah, I think your your impression is correct.

18:27.040 --> 18:30.280
I was shocked at a couple of the jobs that I tested.

18:30.280 --> 18:34.880
Just how much faster the Thalia was that I thought the Thalia failed to do the test.

18:34.880 --> 18:39.400
But you know, when you look at the benchmarks and I'll link to a couple of them in the show

18:39.400 --> 18:43.220
notes and the cool thing about these is you can actually then there's a command in that

18:43.220 --> 18:47.940
link where you can run that exact benchmark against your system and see how it compares

18:47.940 --> 18:50.840
to the dev one and the Thalia that I tested against.

18:50.840 --> 18:55.220
And when you look at those benchmarks, it's almost what you'd expect.

18:55.220 --> 18:59.200
The dev one delivers a lot for eleven hundred dollars.

18:59.200 --> 19:02.060
The dev one is just like very impressive.

19:02.060 --> 19:06.580
It just can't touch what the Thalia can deliver for like twenty five hundred dollars or twenty

19:06.580 --> 19:09.920
seven hundred dollars or however you can figure it, right?

19:09.920 --> 19:13.120
And you just that really bears out in the testing.

19:13.120 --> 19:15.920
I mean, that they're just there's that reality of it.

19:15.920 --> 19:18.680
In fact, when I was looking at it.

19:18.680 --> 19:24.640
The dev one and the Thalia were pretty neck and neck on things that were like disk I.O.

19:24.640 --> 19:25.640
related.

19:25.640 --> 19:29.760
So if your job involves a lot of IOPS and disk I.O. stuff, you're not going to see a

19:29.760 --> 19:33.640
huge increase with the Thalia unless you bought like a very fast drive for the Thalia.

19:33.640 --> 19:37.720
But if you go with like the stock parts on both of them, when it comes to things that

19:37.720 --> 19:42.720
are disk bound, they're just about match the Thalia is a little bit faster.

19:42.720 --> 19:47.160
Obviously when it comes to CPU bound stuff, that's where the Thalia can really, really,

19:47.160 --> 19:49.240
really, really pull ahead.

19:49.240 --> 19:51.640
That's not the whole story, though, I found.

19:51.640 --> 19:53.600
So I have some negatives.

19:53.600 --> 19:58.960
In fact, I have kind of like a killer for me, perhaps, on the Thalia, a fatal flaw,

19:58.960 --> 19:59.960
if you will.

19:59.960 --> 20:01.560
But I'll get to that in a moment.

20:01.560 --> 20:04.660
I'm just curious to know now that you've kind of deep dived into Linux again, just before

20:04.660 --> 20:08.560
we move to finalize on the hardware stuff, what have you found that isn't working for

20:08.560 --> 20:09.560
you very well?

20:09.560 --> 20:11.480
What have you found that still seems to be busticated?

20:11.480 --> 20:13.800
So I'd say a few things I did.

20:13.800 --> 20:19.120
So I was playing Civ 5 with some of the System 76 folks and some other community people.

20:19.120 --> 20:22.560
And I think this is not Pop or Ubuntu's fault.

20:22.560 --> 20:27.200
I think this is more the developers of the Civ 5 port of Linux, because it was the native

20:27.200 --> 20:29.400
version, not the Windows version.

20:29.400 --> 20:35.080
Just like never imagine GPU CPUs with more than eight threads or eight cores.

20:35.080 --> 20:38.680
You had to go in there and edit an INI file, which it just feels very Linux-y, right?

20:38.680 --> 20:40.240
Having to Vim in to get a game to work.

20:40.240 --> 20:44.120
I remember doing that for World of Warcraft years ago, having to just change a bunch of

20:44.120 --> 20:47.320
settings via Vim.

20:47.320 --> 20:50.120
Everything was kind of working out of the box.

20:50.120 --> 20:56.360
I'd say a big thing I've done differently is I gave up on my irrational hatred of Flatpak

20:56.360 --> 21:02.160
and I've just embraced the Flatpak lifestyle with the exception of VS Code still.

21:02.160 --> 21:03.160
Yeah.

21:03.160 --> 21:04.160
Yeah, VS Code, I agree.

21:04.160 --> 21:08.080
Because I need it to be able to hit parts of the system that are right.

21:08.080 --> 21:10.060
I agree with you on that.

21:10.060 --> 21:14.160
If you embrace Flatpak and you're on GNOME, it is just an easier life.

21:14.160 --> 21:15.400
Things are just a little simpler.

21:15.400 --> 21:20.100
And those applications break less, too, because they're not tied to all the other system dependency

21:20.100 --> 21:21.100
ies.

21:21.100 --> 21:22.100
Yeah.

21:22.100 --> 21:23.100
I would say the only...

21:23.100 --> 21:24.100
Okay.

21:24.100 --> 21:27.440
I had two issues so far in about a month.

21:27.440 --> 21:30.920
One is literally right before we came on the air, I had plugged in the...

21:30.920 --> 21:33.680
I don't know what you call it, Chris, the U22 thing, the Zoom...

21:33.680 --> 21:34.680
Oh, yeah.

21:34.680 --> 21:35.680
Yep.

21:35.680 --> 21:36.680
The U22.

21:36.680 --> 21:37.680
The little...

21:37.680 --> 21:38.680
Yep.

21:38.680 --> 21:39.680
The U22.

21:39.680 --> 21:41.480
And for whatever reason, Pop couldn't pick it up, so I just had to reboot and then I

21:41.480 --> 21:42.600
picked it up.

21:42.600 --> 21:43.840
I have no idea why.

21:43.840 --> 21:44.840
Yeah.

21:44.840 --> 21:45.840
Yeah.

21:45.840 --> 21:46.840
Yeah.

21:46.840 --> 21:47.840
That could be...

21:47.840 --> 21:48.840
Pop is using PipeWire now.

21:48.840 --> 21:49.840
Okay.

21:49.840 --> 21:50.840
He's using PipeWire.

21:50.840 --> 21:51.840
It's just new stuff.

21:51.840 --> 21:57.600
I occasionally notice that it incorrectly, and this is only on the Thalio, so I'm not

21:57.600 --> 22:03.160
sure what's up with that, will take my Wi-Fi to 2.4 megahertz or gigahertz, whatever it

22:03.160 --> 22:06.720
is, instead of five, which cuts the speed in half.

22:06.720 --> 22:10.840
But again, I disconnect the Wi-Fi and reconnect it and it's fine and it only seems to happen

22:10.840 --> 22:15.200
after I let it go to sleep, but I haven't been able...

22:15.200 --> 22:19.080
It's only happened twice in a month, so I'm not sure if that's...

22:19.080 --> 22:20.080
Yeah.

22:20.080 --> 22:24.640
Like interference, because I don't know how well this will age, but there's currently

22:24.640 --> 22:30.440
a hurricane coming to where I live in Florida, so all the kids are out of school.

22:30.440 --> 22:33.520
Right now, both kids are like gaming away, right?

22:33.520 --> 22:36.240
One's on a Nintendo, one's on an Xbox.

22:36.240 --> 22:41.760
Everything's got an online connected DRM bullshit thing, so it might just be my router is currently

22:41.760 --> 22:43.920
getting smacked around a little bit.

22:43.920 --> 22:45.400
I've had that on the Dev1 recently.

22:45.400 --> 22:46.400
Okay.

22:46.400 --> 22:48.920
I've had the Wi-Fi not reconnecting, and I'm on Nix, too.

22:48.920 --> 22:50.400
I'm not on POP anymore.

22:50.400 --> 22:52.200
Okay, so that's weird.

22:52.200 --> 22:56.920
Yeah, maybe it's a kernel driver issue.

22:56.920 --> 22:58.620
Tailscale.com slash coder.

22:58.620 --> 23:03.440
That's where you go to get a personal account for up to 20 devices for free, and that's

23:03.440 --> 23:07.640
not just like a limited time thing, and it's a great way to support the show as well.

23:07.640 --> 23:10.120
So Tailscale is a zero config VPN.

23:10.120 --> 23:14.080
Just about everybody must know about Tailscale right now, because I feel like it's been changing

23:14.080 --> 23:19.300
the remote networking landscape for the last year, just changing the way people do work.

23:19.300 --> 23:21.200
It manages firewalls for you.

23:21.200 --> 23:27.040
It takes care of NAT for you, and you can get it installed on your device, be it a computer,

23:27.040 --> 23:35.600
a server, a phone, a Raspberry Pi, I don't know, a VPS, a VM, a container, home assistant.

23:35.600 --> 23:38.300
I mean, you can get it up and running within minutes.

23:38.300 --> 23:45.180
You quickly and easily create a secure, flat mesh network between your systems powered

23:45.180 --> 23:47.400
by WireGuard's noise protocol.

23:47.400 --> 23:52.160
Yep, it's a WireGuard mesh network, and they have a bunch of great features inside of there

23:52.160 --> 23:54.840
as well, like TailScale Send.

23:54.840 --> 24:00.120
You can use TailScale Send as sort of like AirDrop for all of your TailScale devices,

24:00.120 --> 24:02.380
so you can send files between them easily.

24:02.380 --> 24:05.120
And then there's TailScale SSH.

24:05.120 --> 24:08.960
And also, just part of TailScale, it allows you to establish an SSH connection between

24:08.960 --> 24:10.200
your devices.

24:10.200 --> 24:14.040
You're not moving around SSH keys like an animal.

24:14.040 --> 24:19.080
No, you're actually authenticating your SSH connection using WireGuard.

24:19.080 --> 24:20.780
It's pretty awesome, you guys.

24:20.780 --> 24:24.720
And you can try it up for free to 20 devices to really get a sense of this thing and see

24:24.720 --> 24:25.720
how intelligent it is.

24:25.720 --> 24:30.220
Like, when you're moving files between devices, if they're on the same LAN, TailScale knows

24:30.220 --> 24:31.880
that, and it does it over the LAN.

24:31.880 --> 24:36.560
You can use your TailScale IPs, it'll be protected, but they can transfer directly to each other.

24:36.560 --> 24:40.360
And it's not gonna just route all of your traffic over the tunnel.

24:40.360 --> 24:44.040
TailScale intelligently chooses what traffic is supposed to go to the TailScale network.

24:44.040 --> 24:45.480
You know, it's TCP IP.

24:45.480 --> 24:46.920
It knows how this can work.

24:46.920 --> 24:49.400
You just needed software to do it right.

24:49.400 --> 24:50.400
That's TailScale.

24:50.400 --> 24:52.440
Then you combine that with their single sign-on support.

24:52.440 --> 24:56.280
You combine that with the fact that they have ACL controls that allow you to share certain

24:56.280 --> 24:58.800
machines or just certain ports with individuals.

24:58.800 --> 25:00.080
It's so powerful.

25:00.080 --> 25:03.200
It'll change how you do VPNs forever.

25:03.200 --> 25:06.280
So go try it out, tailscale.com slash coder.

25:06.280 --> 25:12.900
One more time, tailscale.com slash coder.

25:12.900 --> 25:17.120
The big thing that we haven't mentioned is the Thaleo has seen a redesign of its case.

25:17.120 --> 25:18.520
You touch on this in your review.

25:18.520 --> 25:22.840
They've taken away that wood veneer side, and they've replaced it with more of a customizable

25:22.840 --> 25:26.160
strip that you can put different looks on.

25:26.160 --> 25:27.240
It's a clean, sharp look.

25:27.240 --> 25:28.240
I like it.

25:28.240 --> 25:31.360
I see one that's custom branded for events.

25:31.360 --> 25:32.360
You know what I'm talking about?

25:32.360 --> 25:33.360
Yes, I do.

25:33.360 --> 25:34.360
Yeah.

25:34.360 --> 25:36.320
So I like the new design.

25:36.320 --> 25:40.680
I was sent the Thaleo, the regular small Thaleo.

25:40.680 --> 25:41.680
Did you end up...

25:41.680 --> 25:42.680
Now, but you got a review unit.

25:42.680 --> 25:43.680
Let's talk about this for a moment.

25:43.680 --> 25:44.680
You got a review unit.

25:44.680 --> 25:48.240
I think you got a similar one with a different graphics card, and you turned around and said,

25:48.240 --> 25:49.240
okay, great.

25:49.240 --> 25:50.240
I'll buy one.

25:50.240 --> 25:53.880
So which one did you actually get, and what made you decide to pull the trigger on buying

25:53.880 --> 25:54.880
it?

25:54.880 --> 25:56.440
So I actually got the wrong review unit.

25:56.440 --> 25:57.440
Oh, interesting.

25:57.440 --> 26:00.600
I got somebody else's review unit, so I had to send it back anyway, but I'm like, you

26:00.600 --> 26:01.600
know what?

26:01.600 --> 26:03.160
I'm just going to buy one anyway, so I'll just buy it.

26:03.160 --> 26:06.280
I literally bought the first production one off the line, I was told.

26:06.280 --> 26:07.280
I bet.

26:07.280 --> 26:10.000
Yeah, well, if you're buying it when the review units are going out...

26:10.000 --> 26:12.640
Since I bought it before it came out.

26:12.640 --> 26:16.360
The difference between this and the review unit is the review unit was more of a base

26:16.360 --> 26:17.840
model.

26:17.840 --> 26:19.120
This is slightly upgraded.

26:19.120 --> 26:24.880
I went for a slightly bigger GPU, and I went up to 32 gigs of RAM.

26:24.880 --> 26:27.680
Obviously, you can max it out at 64.

26:27.680 --> 26:31.300
I know I've already heard from people who want to know why I didn't just do that.

26:31.300 --> 26:34.600
The answer is I didn't feel like spending the money that second.

26:34.600 --> 26:35.600
Sure.

26:35.600 --> 26:37.640
While you're looking it up, I'll tell you what my review unit was.

26:37.640 --> 26:44.080
So mine came with the AMD Ryzen 9 5900X 12 core, base clock of 3.7.

26:44.080 --> 26:46.760
They can peak up to like four something, though.

26:46.760 --> 26:51.680
32 gigs of RAM, one terabyte Samsung SSD 980 Pro.

26:51.680 --> 26:57.680
I had the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 Ti eight gigabyte card in there.

26:57.680 --> 27:00.040
And for most of my review, I was running Nix.

27:00.040 --> 27:05.280
For some of it, I was running POP, but Nix OS with kernel 519.6, so the latest kernel,

27:05.280 --> 27:13.520
ButterFS on the hard drive, and NVIDIA 515.48.07 as my NVIDIA driver.

27:13.520 --> 27:15.880
And so it's a pretty beefy rig.

27:15.880 --> 27:22.840
That 3060 Ti is no slouch, and that Ryzen 9 5900X 12 core is no slouch either.

27:22.840 --> 27:27.000
How are you finding it for, I'm very curious for like video encoding if you're doing any

27:27.000 --> 27:28.000
of that.

27:28.000 --> 27:29.000
Oh, yeah.

27:29.000 --> 27:30.640
Oh, it's a screamer for sure.

27:30.640 --> 27:34.660
It exceeds any of like my requirements by far.

27:34.660 --> 27:35.660
It really does.

27:35.660 --> 27:36.660
I really pushed this thing.

27:36.660 --> 27:37.660
I was very, very impressed.

27:37.660 --> 27:42.080
I don't know if you noticed this, but it gets warm.

27:42.080 --> 27:43.080
To the touch?

27:43.080 --> 27:44.080
Let me see.

27:44.080 --> 27:45.080
If you really push it.

27:45.080 --> 27:50.280
If you push both the GPU and the CPU, it gets really warm.

27:50.280 --> 27:51.280
Really?

27:51.280 --> 27:55.880
And if you look at the internal design of the thing, and I'm not saying it's dangerous,

27:55.880 --> 27:57.280
but I'm saying it's warm.

27:57.280 --> 28:00.640
If you look at the internal design of the thing, there's an intake fan on the bottom

28:00.640 --> 28:06.820
that's blowing upwards from the bottom of the case, and it's blowing over the GPU.

28:06.820 --> 28:11.960
And then there's an intake fan above the GPU that's sucking in for the CPU.

28:11.960 --> 28:19.020
So I reason that you're essentially blowing hot GPU air into the CPU air intake.

28:19.020 --> 28:24.660
And so you get to a point where the CPU just cannot fully cool itself, so it begins to

28:24.660 --> 28:29.280
thermal throttle pretty quickly when you're pushing both systems.

28:29.280 --> 28:35.680
Now even thermal throttle, this thing, and I have it in the benchmarks, it's a killer,

28:35.680 --> 28:37.720
but it is nonetheless thermal throttling.

28:37.720 --> 28:42.280
And if you stress the CPU and the GPU, like maybe you're doing a machine learning analysis

28:42.280 --> 28:48.840
job, something like that, training some models, the whole case gets warm to the touch.

28:48.840 --> 28:53.160
You know, the RAM gets in the 80 Celsius degrees temperature.

28:53.160 --> 28:54.880
The CPUs are getting to their max.

28:54.880 --> 28:56.240
All of it is within spec.

28:56.240 --> 29:00.220
I want to stress that, but it got a lot warmer than I expected.

29:00.220 --> 29:06.040
And when you're when you're pushing that 3060, it's no joke, man, that machine is taking

29:06.040 --> 29:12.140
over 300 watts of power to run the CPU and the GPU at full tilt.

29:12.140 --> 29:14.040
So it is a massive draw.

29:14.040 --> 29:16.740
And when it's idle, when you're not running the GPU and you're just kind of doing your

29:16.740 --> 29:20.560
day to day stuff, it's still in the 100 watt range.

29:20.560 --> 29:22.980
And that's just the reality still of the X86 platform.

29:22.980 --> 29:25.020
This is not a knock against the Thaleo.

29:25.020 --> 29:27.220
That's just the nature of this platform.

29:27.220 --> 29:35.100
It's just striking when you're comparing it to, like, say, a MacBook Pro Ultra Max, whatever,

29:35.100 --> 29:42.260
and you run some of the same tests and the MacBook Max Ultra Pro, whatever, never audibly

29:42.260 --> 29:49.140
kicks its fans up, never gets warm to the touch and still does really well in the benchmarks.

29:49.140 --> 29:52.360
And it's using maybe 30 watts to do all of that.

29:52.360 --> 29:54.460
And the Thaleo is using 300 watts.

29:54.460 --> 30:00.320
It's getting better performance, but it's not like in the next galaxy better.

30:00.320 --> 30:06.100
And so for me, ultimately, I think I would want a bigger Thaleo.

30:06.100 --> 30:07.540
I'd want a larger Thaleo.

30:07.540 --> 30:11.260
So there was more maybe room between the components to cool things.

30:11.260 --> 30:15.580
Not that I think it's really a problem, but if I'm buying a machine like this, I want

30:15.580 --> 30:21.580
it to last eight years and I don't necessarily want to heat soak the RAM, the Northbridge

30:21.580 --> 30:22.980
and some of the CPU components.

30:22.980 --> 30:25.020
So I would probably get a little bit bigger Thaleo.

30:25.020 --> 30:29.860
And for me, that was kind of the fatal flaw and why I didn't order one, because I am in

30:29.860 --> 30:34.420
desperate need of an improved studio setup.

30:34.420 --> 30:39.420
I am going to spend some time running this as an OBS machine and just putting it under

30:39.420 --> 30:43.540
that workload where it's doing streaming, it's doing some capture, but it's not going

30:43.540 --> 30:45.060
to max it out.

30:45.060 --> 30:46.940
And I want to see what the thermals are under that load.

30:46.940 --> 30:52.460
They may be completely acceptable in that scenario because I want to underscore when

30:52.460 --> 30:54.740
I'm looking at these high thermals, I'm rendering.

30:54.740 --> 30:59.420
What I did is, for example, is I had FFmpeg rendering a video on a couple of cores while

30:59.420 --> 31:03.140
I played a video game, not like a crazy video game like CSGO.

31:03.140 --> 31:07.060
And this machine can easily, easily handle that kind of load.

31:07.060 --> 31:13.240
And I could get into thermal throttling territory within five minutes in that scenario.

31:13.240 --> 31:14.240
Just things like that.

31:14.240 --> 31:16.500
And then I just tried different benchmarks and different tests.

31:16.500 --> 31:21.060
Again, even thermal throttled, it's still a monster, but you know, it's just something

31:21.060 --> 31:22.060
to be aware of.

31:22.060 --> 31:24.820
And I think it's in part because it's just it's a small unit.

31:24.820 --> 31:28.700
The base Thaleo is adorably small.

31:28.700 --> 31:31.180
It's kind of like peak PC design in a way.

31:31.180 --> 31:32.480
It's a great case.

31:32.480 --> 31:34.020
It's a great size.

31:34.020 --> 31:39.220
The revisions to this case with that with that new replaceable strip, but also the back

31:39.220 --> 31:41.260
paneling just is cleaner.

31:41.260 --> 31:43.220
They've labeled the ports.

31:43.220 --> 31:45.840
They've really embraced the ports on this Thaleo.

31:45.840 --> 31:47.620
And the case is really solid.

31:47.620 --> 31:53.220
And they've also included brackets and and things that really clamp the gear down, like

31:53.220 --> 31:56.140
the GPU and stuff like that, so it doesn't fall off in shipping.

31:56.140 --> 31:59.620
So it's a really solidly built PC.

31:59.620 --> 32:03.860
It's just also very small, with extremely powerful components packed in there.

32:03.860 --> 32:05.820
And they're all running within spec.

32:05.820 --> 32:08.940
They're all absolutely within spec, but it's a little hotter than I expected.

32:08.940 --> 32:12.860
And over 300 watts is a little more than I expected.

32:12.860 --> 32:13.860
So it's all doable.

32:13.860 --> 32:16.820
Yeah, it's interesting, because they also make a different body.

32:16.820 --> 32:22.460
And I wonder one of my questions when figuring mine was how what effect because it's the

32:22.460 --> 32:25.780
same case, do the different GPUs have on thermals?

32:25.780 --> 32:28.820
I care less about thermals than you, because you know what I care about, right?

32:28.820 --> 32:30.300
Speed and no sound?

32:30.300 --> 32:31.300
No sound.

32:31.300 --> 32:32.300
Yeah.

32:32.300 --> 32:33.300
Fan noise.

32:33.300 --> 32:34.300
Yeah.

32:34.300 --> 32:37.180
Now, the last Thaleo I tested was the first first-gen Thaleo.

32:37.180 --> 32:40.140
And that definitely I think I had a whole blog post.

32:40.140 --> 32:42.900
It sounded like an aircraft carrier.

32:42.900 --> 32:50.260
This is much improved, but I would note that my GPU is an AMD ATI, also NeoFetch, terrible,

32:50.260 --> 32:54.520
terrible output here, device 743F.

32:54.520 --> 32:59.660
That means nothing except it just means that it's like the baby AMD GPU.

32:59.660 --> 33:04.420
So I'm not seeing that I have my hand that I'm not feeling any kind of thermal pressure.

33:04.420 --> 33:05.420
Right.

33:05.420 --> 33:06.980
Again, we're just doing squadcast right now.

33:06.980 --> 33:08.140
So I have what?

33:08.140 --> 33:09.140
Yeah.

33:09.140 --> 33:10.140
Not bad, right?

33:10.140 --> 33:14.460
And exactly, if you're just pushing one of the subsystems, like most video games, once

33:14.460 --> 33:17.860
they're loaded up, they don't really push the CPU a whole bunch.

33:17.860 --> 33:22.260
And when you've got like 24 virtual cores to work with, only a couple of them are doing

33:22.260 --> 33:23.260
anything.

33:23.260 --> 33:28.460
But what I've noticed, Mike, is the Thaleo Mira and Major and the Mega and the Massive,

33:28.460 --> 33:32.100
those are the other bigger Thaleos that are physically larger as well.

33:32.100 --> 33:34.580
They all have side venting.

33:34.580 --> 33:38.060
And maybe that's just because they haven't like they haven't gone back and redesigned

33:38.060 --> 33:39.060
those cases.

33:39.060 --> 33:40.060
Or I don't know, maybe they have.

33:40.060 --> 33:45.220
But I've noticed they seem to have a beefier cooling system, like the Mega and the Massive

33:45.220 --> 33:50.160
especially have a lot beefier side cooling.

33:50.160 --> 33:51.160
Maybe there's something there.

33:51.160 --> 33:55.020
I'm sure we'll find out something I want to experiment more with.

33:55.020 --> 33:58.060
And I think they could probably rightfully argue that it's not actually a problem because

33:58.060 --> 34:02.460
you know, they've tested these things just to say that they are intricate and obsessive

34:02.460 --> 34:06.620
over details is is understating how much they look at this.

34:06.620 --> 34:11.660
I mean, they made a panel that's the that's the PCP, the chips in their damn keyboard

34:11.660 --> 34:12.660
for the.

34:12.660 --> 34:13.660
Yeah.

34:13.660 --> 34:14.660
Yeah.

34:14.660 --> 34:15.660
It looks so great, actually.

34:15.660 --> 34:19.080
I may still end up buying one once I do the OBS test.

34:19.080 --> 34:22.260
If it you know, everything works out fine there in a real world usage, like when I used

34:22.260 --> 34:24.820
it as my desktop for a couple of weeks.

34:24.820 --> 34:26.020
Totally fine.

34:26.020 --> 34:27.020
Totally fine.

34:27.020 --> 34:28.020
Good, solid device.

34:28.020 --> 34:32.220
You know, you've got to live with certain quirks of Linux when you have a large device

34:32.220 --> 34:37.440
like that, like hooking up multiple displays can still be a little glitchy, but all manageable

34:37.440 --> 34:39.540
and just such a rockin system.

34:39.540 --> 34:43.260
You can really just push it and it just takes it.

34:43.260 --> 34:45.540
So I really enjoyed my time with the Thaleo.

34:45.540 --> 34:49.020
I'll give it I'll give it a chance as an OBS machine, but I haven't pulled the trigger

34:49.020 --> 34:50.020
yet.

34:50.020 --> 34:51.020
I'm glad you got one.

34:51.020 --> 34:53.020
I think it's I think it's going to be good.

34:53.020 --> 34:54.020
Yeah, it's nice.

34:54.020 --> 34:55.020
I you know, it's funny.

34:55.020 --> 35:01.940
I I'm I just went down a rabbit hole on this weird AMD GPU that I bought mostly because

35:01.940 --> 35:05.620
I'm very sure that GPU prices are going down soon.

35:05.620 --> 35:07.420
I just feel pretty strongly about that.

35:07.420 --> 35:13.900
I wrote that in my review, but I didn't realize how low end this beige gobby again, awful

35:13.900 --> 35:14.900
name.

35:14.900 --> 35:18.580
Seriously, AMD, just crap.

35:18.580 --> 35:20.380
It's holding up pretty well.

35:20.380 --> 35:24.740
I mean, I was playing Spider-Man remastered on it, getting decent frame rates.

35:24.740 --> 35:27.100
It looked bad as good as it would on a PS4.

35:27.100 --> 35:30.640
My PS5, you know, pumped all the way up could could probably beat it.

35:30.640 --> 35:33.460
And maybe there's tweaks I can make and be a little more aggressive, right, and ludicrous

35:33.460 --> 35:35.380
to make it run better.

35:35.380 --> 35:40.140
I'm kind of interested in what this new AMD architecture is going to do Thaleo aside,

35:40.140 --> 35:41.140
to be honest.

35:41.140 --> 35:43.260
This is a very affordable.

35:43.260 --> 35:46.260
This was a two hundred dollar upgrade.

35:46.260 --> 35:50.380
And the you know, the great thing about those AMD cards, they're going to work great with

35:50.380 --> 35:51.540
your Linux desktop.

35:51.540 --> 35:52.540
It's not going to be a struggle.

35:52.540 --> 35:55.300
You're not going to go get some sort of weird Nvidia package and run through some sort of

35:55.300 --> 35:56.300
install script.

35:56.300 --> 35:57.300
You just plug it in.

35:57.300 --> 35:59.380
If you got a modern kernel and they've upstream, the drivers just works.

35:59.380 --> 36:03.120
And well, and usually for a couple of years, they're the same drivers.

36:03.120 --> 36:07.780
So you just buy another one, a bigger one when you have the money and can almost always

36:07.780 --> 36:08.780
just swap it in.

36:08.780 --> 36:09.780
Yeah.

36:09.780 --> 36:13.340
That's what I'm saying now, I think I'd probably go with a with a, you know, a medium, mid

36:13.340 --> 36:16.860
of the road, mid road that I could get by with and I'd be happy with today GPU.

36:16.860 --> 36:20.900
But I don't think I'd I'd go for like the biggest high end purchase you could just yet.

36:20.900 --> 36:21.900
I agree with you.

36:21.900 --> 36:22.900
Wait a little bit.

36:22.900 --> 36:23.900
Save a few hundred bucks.

36:23.900 --> 36:25.820
Yeah, I think so.

36:25.820 --> 36:26.820
That's the way to do it.

36:26.820 --> 36:28.900
But Thaleo is a it's a really solid system.

36:28.900 --> 36:30.300
It made for a great next box.

36:30.300 --> 36:32.940
And obviously it ran pop great as well.

36:32.940 --> 36:38.460
So clearly I I want to say I was tempted to do I want to say it's the best desktop PC

36:38.460 --> 36:39.460
right now that I know of.

36:39.460 --> 36:44.900
I think it might be when you consider the unique case design, the work that goes into

36:44.900 --> 36:49.820
the internals, just how slick of a system overall is and like the quality of like the

36:49.820 --> 36:54.300
corners, the port holes, just the button even for the power.

36:54.300 --> 36:59.020
All of it is so refined, so obsessed over.

36:59.020 --> 37:03.580
I just don't know of any other desktop PC with that kind of care, that kind of uniqueness

37:03.580 --> 37:04.660
to it.

37:04.660 --> 37:06.180
It's a pretty special machine.

37:06.180 --> 37:09.380
Booster Graham, let's do a few boosts.

37:09.380 --> 37:10.380
What do you say?

37:10.380 --> 37:14.780
Booster Graham, Booster Graham, Woden 501 boosted with 5000 sats.

37:14.780 --> 37:17.020
He says, I got a future trip idea.

37:17.020 --> 37:21.940
Once the new Intel fab opens in Columbus, get a tour set up and then take a trip way

37:21.940 --> 37:25.260
over on the I-70 to meet us Midwest folk.

37:25.260 --> 37:27.420
We've got craft beer and hotels.

37:27.420 --> 37:32.500
Some of them have beer taps right in the rooms, he writes.

37:32.500 --> 37:35.260
What that sounds very dangerous.

37:35.260 --> 37:38.140
Holy crap, I would wreck myself.

37:38.140 --> 37:39.140
That's amazing.

37:39.140 --> 37:44.580
OK, well, you got a boost in and tell me which hotel specifically that I do want to get to

37:44.580 --> 37:45.580
the Midwest.

37:45.580 --> 37:47.100
So we're doing our West Coast tour right now.

37:47.100 --> 37:51.140
I'm in Sacramento as we record because, you know, we did the East Coast.

37:51.140 --> 37:55.020
We did the we did the we did like Denver area.

37:55.020 --> 37:57.540
So it seemed like it was time to the West Coast.

37:57.540 --> 38:00.220
But I you know, there's still so much room in between.

38:00.220 --> 38:01.860
So Midwest is definitely on my list.

38:01.860 --> 38:03.940
So send me the deets.

38:03.940 --> 38:08.580
Sergeant Apple boosted in with two hundred and fifty sats boost.

38:08.580 --> 38:10.140
Oh, I'm sorry.

38:10.140 --> 38:11.780
Twenty five hundred sats.

38:11.780 --> 38:13.540
He says on the future is the Web idea.

38:13.540 --> 38:15.020
You guys have been kicking around.

38:15.020 --> 38:19.340
Do we think Apple will ever come around and get on board with the Web?

38:19.340 --> 38:23.460
Looking at iCloud Web apps, they're definitely short on Web skills.

38:23.460 --> 38:26.220
Won't they just fight and stay native until the end?

38:26.220 --> 38:27.220
Yes.

38:27.220 --> 38:28.220
Yes.

38:28.220 --> 38:29.620
There's all the fight and stay native till the bitter end.

38:29.620 --> 38:30.620
So, yeah.

38:30.620 --> 38:31.620
Why would they do that?

38:31.620 --> 38:32.620
Why would they not do that?

38:32.620 --> 38:37.060
I mean, and do you think long term this is what I mean, like I'm talking long term.

38:37.060 --> 38:38.780
Maybe this is what makes their platform less relevant.

38:38.780 --> 38:42.860
You got to remember, like the vast majority of software that gets written is for businesses

38:42.860 --> 38:50.300
and other organizations, not the whizz, bang a let's blog about it, you know, indie apps,

38:50.300 --> 38:51.300
right?

38:51.300 --> 38:56.100
So I. I guess both things can kind of be true, right?

38:56.100 --> 38:58.380
Like I think they're super cool.

38:58.380 --> 38:59.420
Rogue Amoeba Panic.

38:59.420 --> 39:00.420
They can still exist.

39:00.420 --> 39:05.660
And that's awesome as native Apple platform developers, for example.

39:05.660 --> 39:08.940
And I'm sure although there really isn't the equivalent on Windows, right?

39:08.940 --> 39:10.260
That's kind of the weird part.

39:10.260 --> 39:16.460
But OK, but the vast majority of us who are either, you know, doing contracting or are

39:16.460 --> 39:22.500
writing, you know, business type applications or even utility applications are probably

39:22.500 --> 39:25.660
going to be better suited targeting Web technologies.

39:25.660 --> 39:31.700
The big pink elephant in the gin bar here is what the hell happened to WebAssembly?

39:31.700 --> 39:35.660
Like I'm on a Carmen Sandiego level mission here.

39:35.660 --> 39:42.460
Yeah, like I've I did dip my toes into certain subreddits.

39:42.460 --> 39:47.260
And it just seems like there's like some zealotry, but not a lot getting done.

39:47.260 --> 39:48.260
Who would have thought?

39:48.260 --> 39:49.260
Who would have thought?

39:49.260 --> 39:50.260
OK.

39:50.260 --> 39:51.260
All right.

39:51.260 --> 39:53.820
Well, let me know if you ever do find where in the hell WebAssembly is.

39:53.820 --> 39:55.020
I sure would like to know.

39:55.020 --> 39:58.940
I'm hoping it's not like that weird spin off of Carmen Sandiego where it's we're in time

39:58.940 --> 39:59.940
this WebAssembly.

39:59.940 --> 40:03.780
I guess you mean a couple of dinosaurs and Richard Stallman having to go get it.

40:03.780 --> 40:05.040
You know, that's where it goes.

40:05.040 --> 40:06.040
That's where it ends up.

40:06.040 --> 40:10.780
It always ends up with RMS tire boosts in with twenty one hundred sats.

40:10.780 --> 40:17.240
And he says, what is Mike and your opinion on what is better, Web apps or electron apps?

40:17.240 --> 40:21.540
From what I can tell, most electron apps are just Web apps and browsers that have lack

40:21.540 --> 40:22.540
security.

40:22.540 --> 40:25.380
Also, he says shame on you for getting him back into Magic the Gathering.

40:25.380 --> 40:29.900
He sold his cards six months ago, but you talking about it is making him regret selling

40:29.900 --> 40:30.900
them out.

40:30.900 --> 40:36.340
And he says on the uniform topic, Pearl snapshots are awesome and boots are where it's at.

40:36.340 --> 40:41.340
So if you had to pick Web app or electron app, do you have a choice?

40:41.340 --> 40:45.700
Do you have a preference, I should say?

40:45.700 --> 40:48.340
Yeah, I would say Web app.

40:48.340 --> 40:55.060
But my my revealed behavior seems to be electron app for like things like slack and element

40:55.060 --> 40:57.220
I.O. or element, whatever.

40:57.220 --> 40:58.220
Me too.

40:58.220 --> 40:59.220
I would answer Web app.

40:59.220 --> 41:02.140
But then, of course, I like having I like having things as their own.

41:02.140 --> 41:03.820
I just like the proper notifications.

41:03.820 --> 41:04.820
Yeah, that too.

41:04.820 --> 41:05.820
Yeah.

41:05.820 --> 41:06.820
Yeah.

41:06.820 --> 41:09.540
But by the way, on the Magic the Gathering, you don't need to buy a big collection, my

41:09.540 --> 41:10.540
man.

41:10.540 --> 41:11.540
Buy singles.

41:11.540 --> 41:12.540
You'll be fine.

41:12.540 --> 41:13.540
There you go.

41:13.540 --> 41:14.540
Yeah, you'll be fine.

41:14.540 --> 41:15.540
Just get a few singles.

41:15.540 --> 41:16.540
Where can it go from there?

41:16.540 --> 41:17.540
Nowhere.

41:17.540 --> 41:20.060
Oh, but the beer taps in the hotel rooms were great.

41:20.060 --> 41:21.060
That's fine.

41:21.060 --> 41:22.060
Everybody's going to be OK.

41:22.060 --> 41:23.060
OK, you got me.

41:23.060 --> 41:24.060
All right.

41:24.060 --> 41:26.580
Ammar boosted with a thousand twenty four cents.

41:26.580 --> 41:28.140
He says, Hello, Chris.

41:28.140 --> 41:29.140
Hello, Mike.

41:29.140 --> 41:30.220
I wanted to be a hipster, too.

41:30.220 --> 41:32.340
I looked into Fleet as soon as they announced it.

41:32.340 --> 41:36.820
But I I saw that they say in their FAQ section that it's mainly written in Kotlin, which

41:36.820 --> 41:39.260
means it runs on a JVM.

41:39.260 --> 41:40.260
All their stuff does.

41:40.260 --> 41:41.580
Yeah, that's true.

41:41.580 --> 41:45.940
They're considering open sourcing parts of the product or the technology behind it.

41:45.940 --> 41:50.260
Both of those points are a big no to me, especially today in the V.S.

41:50.260 --> 41:51.260
Code era.

41:51.260 --> 41:52.260
But thanks for the show.

41:52.260 --> 41:56.980
Yeah, it seems like Ammar also wanted to be a hipster.

41:56.980 --> 41:57.980
Didn't work for him.

41:57.980 --> 42:04.380
I'm concerned about JetBrains if before Fleet even officially ships as a product.

42:04.380 --> 42:09.060
You and others are saying, where does this fit and why are they doing it like this?

42:09.060 --> 42:10.060
That seems like a bad sign.

42:10.060 --> 42:14.900
I know your point was the business market may keep it alive, but I don't know, man.

42:14.900 --> 42:16.160
Just a little bit of a red flaggy.

42:16.160 --> 42:17.160
You know what I mean?

42:17.160 --> 42:18.160
Just a little red flaggy.

42:18.160 --> 42:19.160
Oh, yeah.

42:19.160 --> 42:27.100
I mean, the the IE6 level dominance of V.S. Code is it's nothing to sneeze at.

42:27.100 --> 42:33.180
And Optimus Gray rounds this out with a big old row of McDuck's twenty two thousand two

42:33.180 --> 42:34.180
hundred and twenty two sets.

42:34.180 --> 42:35.180
Quacka Wacka.

42:35.180 --> 42:36.180
It's a treasure.

42:36.180 --> 42:37.180
Yippee.

42:37.180 --> 42:38.860
And we're going to see Optimus Gray at JPL, too.

42:38.860 --> 42:41.520
He says, I'm not a CPA.

42:41.520 --> 42:43.260
But I have a program for them.

42:43.260 --> 42:46.660
You may want to see if you can write off the recording mobile office when you're on a work

42:46.660 --> 42:47.660
trip.

42:47.660 --> 42:48.660
Again, not a CPA.

42:48.660 --> 42:51.140
He says, I also gave a listen to the Drew cleaned up version.

42:51.140 --> 42:53.180
And it's weird because he always listens live.

42:53.180 --> 42:57.760
I missed the post show title talks, but, you know, I'm a member of the QA feed, so perhaps

42:57.760 --> 42:58.980
I'll get it that way.

42:58.980 --> 43:02.020
I need to be smarter about this kind of stuff.

43:02.020 --> 43:03.020
He's right.

43:03.020 --> 43:04.340
I could probably write off my mobile office.

43:04.340 --> 43:08.100
There's probably a lot of things I could be writing off that I'm not.

43:08.100 --> 43:11.740
I hate to solicit advice over the Internet on this kind of thing.

43:11.740 --> 43:14.900
But if this is your area, specifically, if you're kind of familiar with what I do as

43:14.900 --> 43:17.040
a business, reach out.

43:17.040 --> 43:21.140
My tax bill is crushing and I need every defense I have.

43:21.140 --> 43:25.340
So and I say that with no joke.

43:25.340 --> 43:26.340
You wouldn't believe it.

43:26.340 --> 43:30.260
You know, you just would not believe how reamed I get as a small business owner.

43:30.260 --> 43:32.020
So I believe it.

43:32.020 --> 43:33.020
Oh, yeah.

43:33.020 --> 43:34.020
No, I know you would.

43:34.020 --> 43:36.940
Oh, and the CPA is out there.

43:36.940 --> 43:39.060
They know.

43:39.060 --> 43:45.660
I think the people who just work nine to fives have no idea, have no idea how much money

43:45.660 --> 43:46.660
we end up paying.

43:46.660 --> 43:47.660
It's it's incredible.

43:47.660 --> 43:52.820
Also, I just want to give a shout out to TACOF 751, who said, go check out Web three is doing

43:52.820 --> 43:53.820
great.

43:53.820 --> 43:54.820
It's the number three.

43:54.820 --> 43:59.700
Web three is doing great, where the author is doing a fantastic job of documenting all

43:59.700 --> 44:04.800
of the ridiculous things happening in the stupid world of crypto and Web three.

44:04.800 --> 44:06.020
And it's brutal.

44:06.020 --> 44:12.100
Didn't like the IRS dude or the head of the Fed to be like, this is all taxable security.

44:12.100 --> 44:16.420
SEC said that about Ethereum the day after Ethereum announced their proof of work.

44:16.420 --> 44:17.420
No, I'm sorry.

44:17.420 --> 44:22.460
Proof of stake merge that, you know, for a security that one of the basic tests is, is

44:22.460 --> 44:25.680
there a group of people managing it and is it something you're investing in expecting

44:25.680 --> 44:28.860
a return based on the actions of those group of people?

44:28.860 --> 44:29.860
That's Ethereum.

44:29.860 --> 44:33.900
I mean, a lot of these cryptos have a group of people that are asking you to invest in

44:33.900 --> 44:36.620
their thing, implying that you're going to get a return.

44:36.620 --> 44:38.380
And it's called the Howie test.

44:38.380 --> 44:42.140
There's multiple aspects of it, but that's one of the things that makes you a security.

44:42.140 --> 44:45.360
And when you're a security, it's a totally different ballgame.

44:45.360 --> 44:50.540
And you can't promote it like you can say, like property or real estate, you know, like

44:50.540 --> 44:51.540
software.

44:51.540 --> 44:52.540
Right.

44:52.540 --> 44:53.540
Right.

44:53.540 --> 44:54.540
You can say anything.

44:54.540 --> 44:55.540
Yeah.

44:55.540 --> 44:56.540
So no, but this is on this guy's site.

44:56.540 --> 44:57.540
Web three is going great.

44:57.540 --> 44:58.540
This is the story.

44:58.540 --> 45:02.340
September 22nd, IRS gets permission for John Doe summons for taxpayers who don't report

45:02.340 --> 45:03.340
crypto transactions.

45:03.340 --> 45:04.340
Yeah.

45:04.340 --> 45:05.340
Now that's for a particular exchange.

45:05.340 --> 45:06.940
But yeah, that's what's going to happen now.

45:06.940 --> 45:07.940
Oh, yeah.

45:07.940 --> 45:08.940
Oh, yeah.

45:08.940 --> 45:09.940
Oh, yeah.

45:09.940 --> 45:14.220
This is, you know, potentially long term, a good thing.

45:14.220 --> 45:20.180
We need a Hunger Games kind of cleaning out of these crappy crypto scams.

45:20.180 --> 45:25.960
We need somebody to come through and just take them all out because so many of them

45:25.960 --> 45:30.500
are pump and dump schemes where there is I'll just super brief because I think people need

45:30.500 --> 45:32.100
to know this.

45:32.100 --> 45:35.900
All of these cryptos after Bitcoin have a group of people behind them.

45:35.900 --> 45:38.380
Ethereum is included in this list.

45:38.380 --> 45:43.420
And the way that it all worked is that now all of them have a small group of developers

45:43.420 --> 45:45.220
and they got what's called a pre mine.

45:45.220 --> 45:49.660
So before the crypto even went live to the rest of the public, maybe they get like 20

45:49.660 --> 45:52.840
million coins or a million coins or whatever their setup is.

45:52.840 --> 45:54.540
So they get what's called a pre mine.

45:54.540 --> 45:58.420
They get access to the coins before anyone else does.

45:58.420 --> 46:02.020
Then once the crypto goes public on exchanges, people start buying and trading it.

46:02.020 --> 46:07.840
Well, if you got something, a million of something for free and now it's worth a dollar, right?

46:07.840 --> 46:08.920
It doesn't have to go big.

46:08.920 --> 46:11.220
That's why so many of these cryptos are worth pennies.

46:11.220 --> 46:15.440
If it goes worth 50 cents and you had a million of it, you're doing great.

46:15.440 --> 46:16.980
And so now you sell.

46:16.980 --> 46:21.480
And so you got the crypto token for nothing and then you dump it on the market.

46:21.480 --> 46:24.380
And it's just this process that you repeat over and over again.

46:24.380 --> 46:28.140
Ethereum is just a more complex version of this because they've done all of these little

46:28.140 --> 46:32.780
things to constrain liquidity to make it easier for them to sell without causing the price

46:32.780 --> 46:33.780
to dump.

46:33.780 --> 46:38.740
And now they've launched proof of staking where you take your Ethereum and you give

46:38.740 --> 46:43.600
it to a Coinbase or a crack and you give it to a third party and they stake it in the

46:43.600 --> 46:47.260
network and you get yield off of that.

46:47.260 --> 46:54.100
The funny thing is the developers have literally not written the code or published the code

46:54.100 --> 46:55.540
to unstake.

46:55.540 --> 46:59.300
Once you stake your Ethereum seems very suspicious, right?

46:59.300 --> 47:03.260
It's locked up until they write the code and they won't be until some big releases down

47:03.260 --> 47:06.020
the road and software is always on time.

47:06.020 --> 47:12.060
Even in the most honest case, dude, the proof of stake merger was delayed by seven years.

47:12.060 --> 47:13.140
They were trying to get it out.

47:13.140 --> 47:16.140
It took them seven years to ship the proof of stake merger.

47:16.140 --> 47:19.740
And now they're saying with the next merge, that's the next merger to that's when you'll

47:19.740 --> 47:20.940
be able to unstick.

47:20.940 --> 47:27.420
In the meantime, the founders that got all their pre-mined coins can sell, sell, sell,

47:27.420 --> 47:30.520
and you can't sell your Ethereum because it's locked up staked.

47:30.520 --> 47:31.940
You cannot withdraw it.

47:31.940 --> 47:36.700
So they can now sell on the market with impunity and people can't pull out.

47:36.700 --> 47:39.300
So it locks the liquidity and it locks the price in.

47:39.300 --> 47:41.300
It is a brilliant scam.

47:41.300 --> 47:45.100
They are pulling all the users of Ethereum and everybody, Oh, I want yield.

47:45.100 --> 47:50.180
I want yield, I want yield and they're all fallen for it.

47:50.180 --> 47:54.260
But I just, I can't believe we're watching this go down and Bitcoin suffers from none

47:54.260 --> 47:55.260
of this.

47:55.260 --> 47:56.260
There's no central person.

47:56.260 --> 47:57.260
There was no pre-mined.

47:57.260 --> 47:58.860
There's no staking.

47:58.860 --> 48:00.440
It's not a security.

48:00.440 --> 48:06.760
It has been declared by the SEC and the IRS as property years ago, reaffirmed by Gary

48:06.760 --> 48:11.580
Gensler, the chairman of the SEC multiple times.

48:11.580 --> 48:16.260
But yet we still see all these horrible scams that take grandma's savings and they just

48:16.260 --> 48:18.300
need to be washed out.

48:18.300 --> 48:19.820
They all need to go.

48:19.820 --> 48:23.580
So maybe we'll see some of them, some of them fade away.

48:23.580 --> 48:28.140
In the meantime, I remain here skeptical, keeping an eye on all things to call it out

48:28.140 --> 48:33.420
as I see it, I'm watching them, I've got their number.

48:33.420 --> 48:34.980
I know what they're up to.

48:34.980 --> 48:40.620
I see that if you buy some of these crazy cryptos, you are their liquidity for exiting.

48:40.620 --> 48:43.340
You understand that you're providing them exit liquidity.

48:43.340 --> 48:45.300
That's how all of this works.

48:45.300 --> 48:47.460
My old man taught me something a long time ago.

48:47.460 --> 48:51.340
If you're sitting down at the poker table and you don't know who the sucker is.

48:51.340 --> 48:52.340
You're the sucker.

48:52.340 --> 48:53.340
You're the sucker.

48:53.340 --> 48:54.340
Kick it out.

48:54.340 --> 48:55.340
Leave.

48:55.340 --> 48:56.340
Yeah.

48:56.340 --> 48:57.340
Yep.

48:57.340 --> 48:58.340
That's pretty much it.

48:58.340 --> 49:01.000
So that's Chris's little pro tip for the internet.

49:01.000 --> 49:02.500
So Web3 is doing just great.

49:02.500 --> 49:03.740
You can go check that out.

49:03.740 --> 49:04.740
JPEX.

49:04.740 --> 49:06.740
Who would have thought they'd be so easy to sell?

49:06.740 --> 49:07.740
Right.

49:07.740 --> 49:08.740
God damn it.

49:08.740 --> 49:09.740
I should have thought of this.

49:09.740 --> 49:10.740
Yeah.

49:10.740 --> 49:13.460
That could have been us, dude.

49:13.460 --> 49:14.460
Jcoin.

49:14.460 --> 49:17.580
Mr. Hill.

49:17.580 --> 49:18.820
We could have done it, dude.

49:18.820 --> 49:19.820
We were on the air.

49:19.820 --> 49:20.820
We could have done it.

49:20.820 --> 49:21.820
Robes.

49:21.820 --> 49:22.820
We could still do Robcoin.

49:22.820 --> 49:23.820
We could do Robcoin.

49:23.820 --> 49:24.820
Yeah.

49:24.820 --> 49:25.820
Maybe.

49:25.820 --> 49:26.820
Maybe.

49:26.820 --> 49:30.120
You know, I knew I was in a good place because Listener Jeff here, where he's put us up,

49:30.120 --> 49:31.300
he's got a coat of robe.

49:31.300 --> 49:32.660
So I knew he was good people.

49:32.660 --> 49:33.660
You know?

49:33.660 --> 49:35.620
You know, he's a man of taste and distinction at least.

49:35.620 --> 49:36.620
Yeah.

49:36.620 --> 49:37.620
Right.

49:37.620 --> 49:38.620
Right.

49:38.620 --> 49:40.500
Well, I want to say thank you to our members for investing in our content production,

Go to DominicM.com and read all my Linuxy updates.

50:02.340 --> 50:05.720
And we should say, if we didn't make it clear enough, your written Thalia review is up there

50:05.720 --> 50:06.720
as well.

50:06.720 --> 50:07.720
It is.

50:07.720 --> 50:11.860
And there might be something this weekend, depending on how whacked I get by this hurricane.

50:11.860 --> 50:12.860
Oh, man.

50:12.860 --> 50:14.100
I hope everything goes OK.

50:14.100 --> 50:15.100
You let me know.

50:15.100 --> 50:18.940
Hey, listen, if not, you know, we actually did a show, do you remember, when I was up

50:18.940 --> 50:19.940
in Jersey?

50:19.940 --> 50:20.940
Yes.

50:20.940 --> 50:21.940
We did one during Sandy.

50:21.940 --> 50:22.940
I remember.

50:22.940 --> 50:23.940
So I'm pretty sure we'll be back Monday at noon.

50:23.940 --> 50:24.940
Yeah.

50:24.940 --> 50:25.940
Yep.

50:25.940 --> 50:29.940
