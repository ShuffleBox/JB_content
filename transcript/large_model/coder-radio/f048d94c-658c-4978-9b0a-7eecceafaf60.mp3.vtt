00:00.000 --> 00:15.720
This is KOTOR Radio, episode 454 for February 21st, 2022.

00:15.720 --> 00:20.600
Hello friends and welcome into Jupiter Broadcasting's weekly talk show, taking a pragmatic look

00:20.600 --> 00:25.500
at the art and the business of software development and the world of technology.

00:25.500 --> 00:30.840
My name is Chris, and joining us at his backup podcast machine, it's our host, Mr. Dominic.

00:30.840 --> 00:33.480
Hey, hey, hey, I'm on an M1 today.

00:33.480 --> 00:35.440
I can't believe you've never...

00:35.440 --> 00:36.440
That's a good little rhyme.

00:36.440 --> 00:37.440
There you go.

00:37.440 --> 00:38.440
Okay.

00:38.440 --> 00:39.440
What happened?

00:39.440 --> 00:41.520
I know you had some problems this morning.

00:41.520 --> 00:43.160
This is a backup machine.

00:43.160 --> 00:44.500
This is a backup machine.

00:44.500 --> 00:45.920
I've been using the Thaleo again.

00:45.920 --> 00:47.520
I don't even think we really talked about that.

00:47.520 --> 00:48.880
It's a power machine.

00:48.880 --> 00:49.880
It's been glorious.

00:49.880 --> 00:51.080
Yeah, as they are.

00:51.080 --> 00:57.560
And I naively went into the pop shop and it's like, you have updates and I'm like, sure.

00:57.560 --> 00:58.560
I love updates.

00:58.560 --> 00:59.560
Let's do it.

00:59.560 --> 01:00.560
Yeah, no.

01:00.560 --> 01:01.680
Totally broke my Wi-Fi.

01:01.680 --> 01:03.880
You're using Wi-Fi on the Thaleo?

01:03.880 --> 01:05.440
The router is on the other side of the house.

01:05.440 --> 01:06.440
I feel you.

01:06.440 --> 01:07.440
I don't have Ethernet and Lady Jeeps.

01:07.440 --> 01:10.520
I only have Wi-Fi, so I know how that goes.

01:10.520 --> 01:15.760
Yeah, and it's very evil because if I go into recovery mode and you can run what is effectively

01:15.760 --> 01:18.960
a live image off the partition, it's fine.

01:18.960 --> 01:21.280
Oh, so it's definitely something in that update, you think?

01:21.280 --> 01:26.280
Yeah, it's one of the drivers or some firmware or some nonsense like that that they batch.

01:26.280 --> 01:32.000
We love System76, but you really like you can't have that be a thing that through the

01:32.000 --> 01:34.200
gooey pop shop can break your Wi-Fi.

01:34.200 --> 01:35.200
Yeah, I wonder.

01:35.200 --> 01:37.600
I wish there was something I could do to help you troubleshoot it, too, because I don't

01:37.600 --> 01:39.280
have any ideas for you.

01:39.280 --> 01:40.280
That's tricky.

01:40.280 --> 01:44.720
Yeah, I've been looking at things and it is a common problem-ish.

01:44.720 --> 01:49.240
There's some folks on the Mint and Minjero, actually it was the Arch forms, of course,

01:49.240 --> 01:50.760
because of course it is.

01:50.760 --> 01:52.200
The solutions were all insane.

01:52.200 --> 01:56.760
I tried each and every one of them and they all failed, so then I got desperate.

01:56.760 --> 02:01.720
I said, well, there's this little refresh my install thing for Pop OS.

02:01.720 --> 02:07.480
Surely that just resets all the firmware to whatever was on the 2110 disk, right?

02:07.480 --> 02:09.320
No, just the OS, right?

02:09.320 --> 02:10.880
But not the firmwares.

02:10.880 --> 02:14.040
Not the firmwares, not the drivers, no.

02:14.040 --> 02:17.640
So I lost all my data, yay.

02:17.640 --> 02:24.760
I still don't have working Wi-Fi and the solution that seems obvious is just reinstall 2110,

02:24.760 --> 02:29.520
but then at some point I'm going to have to do like an apt upgrade, right?

02:29.520 --> 02:32.920
Or I'm going to make a mistake and click this thing in the pop shop because you want some

02:32.920 --> 02:34.480
of the updates.

02:34.480 --> 02:38.000
Surely you want the new Firefox and I'm going to break my Wi-Fi again.

02:38.000 --> 02:44.960
I have to say, just recently I had a friend who had their display borked after an update

02:44.960 --> 02:46.440
in Pop OS.

02:46.440 --> 02:52.360
I'd be willing to bet you in both cases, it's not actually like a Pop OS thing per se, but

02:52.360 --> 02:54.360
apt.

02:54.360 --> 02:58.120
Something went wrong with apt because any time I've actually ever had an Ubuntu based

02:58.120 --> 03:03.400
system break badly, it's been something didn't install right or a post install script didn't

03:03.400 --> 03:07.920
run correctly or a package didn't get configured properly because something else didn't happen

03:07.920 --> 03:09.660
and I love apt.

03:09.660 --> 03:13.520
It made me switch away from Red Hat and I will always be grateful because my systems

03:13.520 --> 03:15.140
are so much easier to maintain with apt.

03:15.140 --> 03:19.560
Back in the day you had to manually resolve RPM dependencies, it was brutal.

03:19.560 --> 03:25.760
So I really truly do love apt, but I feel like it's gotten fragile and brittle and these

03:25.760 --> 03:28.960
are the kinds of things like, for example, and I'm not trying to make this a Fedora versus

03:28.960 --> 03:34.880
Ubuntu thing, but DNF, the package manager for Fedora, does a dry run before it actually

03:34.880 --> 03:36.240
installs stuff.

03:36.240 --> 03:38.800
And so if something's going to break, it breaks in that dry run.

03:38.800 --> 03:39.800
What a brilliant idea.

03:39.800 --> 03:40.800
Right.

03:40.800 --> 03:42.480
Yeah, that would be great.

03:42.480 --> 03:44.360
So I have suspicions.

03:44.360 --> 03:48.800
I know there are lots of reasons to update the point versions of your kernel.

03:48.800 --> 03:52.360
I'm pretty sure that's what happened here though, because one of them I saw the list

03:52.360 --> 03:57.880
was like, and it was just like a point rev of the Linux kernel headers or whatever.

03:57.880 --> 04:01.960
But yeah, that's probably what broke it.

04:01.960 --> 04:02.960
Yeah, I could see that.

04:02.960 --> 04:08.240
I could see the recovery environment would be using an older version of the kernel.

04:08.240 --> 04:12.960
There is one thing I didn't try from the Wizards of Arc, because I am not screwing with my

04:12.960 --> 04:20.020
router to accommodate what I consider a software bug on either Pop, Linux, or maybe it is aptitude.

04:20.020 --> 04:23.720
I have one of those new fancy routers, I'll link it in the show notes sometime if I ever

04:23.720 --> 04:31.960
figure out what I did with it, that does not broadcast the SSID for 5G and 2.4 hertz separately.

04:31.960 --> 04:36.820
It gives you one network name and then it intelligently routes your traffic.

04:36.820 --> 04:39.500
This has never been a problem.

04:39.500 --> 04:42.780
But someone was saying that they got desperate and what they did was they forced the router

04:42.780 --> 04:44.400
back into that manual mode.

04:44.400 --> 04:49.560
I saw the speed test you were doing, shouldn't you even be getting better speeds on 2.4 gig

04:49.560 --> 04:50.560
hertz Wi-Fi?

04:50.560 --> 04:54.920
I mean, the maximum speed I was able to get was 14 megabits a second and that was like

04:54.920 --> 04:56.960
maximum.

04:56.960 --> 04:57.960
That's a bummer, man.

04:57.960 --> 04:59.680
Well, keep us posted.

04:59.680 --> 05:04.520
I was going to open the show with, once again, acknowledging the fact that I openly stalk

05:04.520 --> 05:09.640
you on Twitter and I saw some really big news this week.

05:09.640 --> 05:10.640
So I got two reactions.

05:10.640 --> 05:12.760
I mean, first, I'm very excited for you.

05:12.760 --> 05:14.560
Second reaction is I'm just a little confused.

05:14.560 --> 05:15.560
You're confused?

05:15.560 --> 05:16.920
Well, nobody came to me for permission.

05:16.920 --> 05:20.080
Yes, I got engaged and I guess I didn't pass by.

05:20.080 --> 05:23.760
I forgot in that JP contracting agreement there was that clause, wasn't there?

05:23.760 --> 05:25.000
My blessing was required.

05:25.000 --> 05:26.000
I don't understand.

05:26.000 --> 05:27.000
I don't understand.

05:27.000 --> 05:28.440
I mean, we're podcast married.

05:28.440 --> 05:29.440
True.

05:29.440 --> 05:30.920
Does anybody else know this relationship?

05:30.920 --> 05:33.480
That's a lot for me.

05:33.480 --> 05:35.040
And I find out on Twitter.

05:35.040 --> 05:36.040
You knew.

05:36.040 --> 05:37.040
You knew because I had...

05:37.040 --> 05:39.040
Yes, I got engaged.

05:39.040 --> 05:40.040
Nice.

05:40.040 --> 05:41.040
She's a good woman.

05:41.040 --> 05:46.760
Although, in the second part of that tweet was to convince her to run Linux, today's

05:46.760 --> 05:49.960
showing did not inspire too much confidence.

05:49.960 --> 05:50.960
Oh, man.

05:50.960 --> 05:52.840
That's so embarrassing when that happens.

05:52.840 --> 05:54.120
That is the worst.

05:54.120 --> 05:55.120
Well, congratulations.

05:55.120 --> 05:56.120
Thank you.

05:56.120 --> 05:57.120
Thank you.

05:57.120 --> 05:59.720
I assume we'll probably just take care of the blessing thing later.

05:59.720 --> 06:00.720
We'll talk about it.

06:00.720 --> 06:01.720
That's fine.

06:01.720 --> 06:02.720
We'll talk about it.

06:02.720 --> 06:03.720
Ouch.

06:03.720 --> 06:04.720
All right.

06:04.720 --> 06:05.720
We did get some great feedback this week.

06:05.720 --> 06:09.680
Daryl from South Africa says that, I also had troubles with my Nissan radio.

06:09.680 --> 06:14.520
I couldn't figure out why my Nissan car system kept rebooting when listening to podcasts.

06:14.520 --> 06:19.000
And then I realized it was only when I played the 99% Invisible podcast.

06:19.000 --> 06:23.360
I'm guessing that the percent sign is not sanitized and bugged out of the system.

06:23.360 --> 06:26.000
So it's not just the Mazdas.

06:26.000 --> 06:30.440
The Nissans as well suffered from that problem, referring to something we talked about last

06:30.440 --> 06:31.440
week.

06:31.440 --> 06:32.440
All right.

06:32.440 --> 06:33.440
But this one came in.

06:33.440 --> 06:34.960
This is a problem we've never solved before.

06:34.960 --> 06:35.960
And Josh writes in.

06:35.960 --> 06:41.000
He says, hey, Coder Crew, I have a conundrum that I hope you'll have a solution for.

06:41.000 --> 06:46.420
I don't know about you, but during the winter, my hands get really cold when I'm working.

06:46.420 --> 06:47.420
And it's just my hands.

06:47.420 --> 06:50.280
If I get a space heater, it gets everything too hot.

06:50.280 --> 06:52.320
And I can't really type with gloves on.

06:52.320 --> 06:55.360
Do you guys have a solution for cold hands?

06:55.360 --> 06:56.760
And you know what?

06:56.760 --> 07:01.240
First of all, I want to put this in the show because I bet some people in the audience

07:01.240 --> 07:02.640
have some solutions.

07:02.640 --> 07:06.360
But I actually went down the rabbit hole and found a few products for Josh.

07:06.360 --> 07:07.360
I don't know.

07:07.360 --> 07:08.360
You probably don't have this problem in Florida.

07:08.360 --> 07:11.120
This is probably not something you worry about.

07:11.120 --> 07:12.120
Yeah, not really.

07:12.120 --> 07:13.120
No.

07:13.120 --> 07:14.120
You bastard.

07:14.120 --> 07:15.120
Alligator hands.

07:15.120 --> 07:16.120
Snake in the bathroom.

07:16.120 --> 07:17.120
Yeah.

07:17.120 --> 07:18.120
All those.

07:18.120 --> 07:19.120
Those are problems.

07:19.120 --> 07:20.120
Okay.

07:20.120 --> 07:21.120
Yeah.

07:21.120 --> 07:22.120
All right.

07:22.120 --> 07:23.120
Fair.

07:23.120 --> 07:25.120
So the number one is I know he said Josh said he didn't want a space heater.

07:25.120 --> 07:30.960
I am going to link to a five hundred watt ceramic small space personal mini heater.

07:30.960 --> 07:31.960
This thing is so great.

07:31.960 --> 07:32.960
I have one of these.

07:32.960 --> 07:36.920
I bought it back in October of twenty nineteen and it just does a real small radius.

07:36.920 --> 07:38.120
That's one thing to consider.

07:38.120 --> 07:41.560
But but Josh, I got the real solution for you here.

07:41.560 --> 07:44.600
And of course, this is a product.

07:44.600 --> 07:46.520
It's a warm desk pad.

07:46.520 --> 07:49.480
You know, those giant mouse pads that are such a thing now.

07:49.480 --> 07:54.000
Well, some brilliant entrepreneurs have created one that is heated.

07:54.000 --> 07:58.680
So the space right where your hands can rest by your keyboard can be warmed.

07:58.680 --> 08:01.880
And of course, it'll warm the keyboard a little bit as well.

08:01.880 --> 08:03.580
And it's also a mouse pad.

08:03.580 --> 08:07.740
So it's a ginormous heated mouse pad for your desk.

08:07.740 --> 08:10.300
Also it says don't wrap it around your body.

08:10.300 --> 08:11.300
Just put it on your desk.

08:11.300 --> 08:14.300
It's thirty one by thirteen inches.

08:14.300 --> 08:15.300
So that's pretty neat.

08:15.300 --> 08:16.300
And you know what?

08:16.300 --> 08:19.540
It's like twenty two bucks after tax.

08:19.540 --> 08:21.120
That's not bad for something like that.

08:21.120 --> 08:22.120
That's really good.

08:22.120 --> 08:23.120
Yeah.

08:23.120 --> 08:24.120
All right.

08:24.120 --> 08:25.120
Coder dot show slash contact.

08:25.120 --> 08:26.120
All right.

08:26.120 --> 08:29.120
But now here is our tough question of the week.

08:29.120 --> 08:31.240
I think we're going to have to chew on this one for a minute.

08:31.240 --> 08:35.120
Andrew writes, and he said, I've been listening to Coder for years and I've come to value

08:35.120 --> 08:37.920
your opinions about technology in the industry.

08:37.920 --> 08:42.840
Recently my doctor told me I may lose my eyesight and I have been reading about technical solutions

08:42.840 --> 08:44.400
to my vision problems.

08:44.400 --> 08:49.400
I came across this article in the IEEE Spectrum yesterday and I wanted your thoughts on how

08:49.400 --> 08:55.240
medical implant makers should support devices when they go out of business.

08:55.240 --> 08:58.720
And so I took a look at this article, Mike, and they've got like a story in here about

08:58.720 --> 09:03.220
three patients and there's actually like 350 people that are affected by this.

09:03.220 --> 09:08.120
But these three, they focus on three patients and they have these second sight implants

09:08.120 --> 09:11.920
in their eyes that give them sight.

09:11.920 --> 09:13.720
And it's totally changed their life.

09:13.720 --> 09:19.040
But the company in one case is like being sold, the other one's focusing on a new vision

09:19.040 --> 09:20.560
and discontinuing support.

09:20.560 --> 09:23.520
Like in the cases that they talk about in this article, like the companies are either

09:23.520 --> 09:27.400
just moving on or have been sold and they're no longer supporting that.

09:27.400 --> 09:33.380
And like one problem, a broken wire, a loose connection, the thing's out forever.

09:33.380 --> 09:38.960
And to add injury to insult, a defunct system in the eye could cause medical complications,

09:38.960 --> 09:46.520
interferes with procedures like MRI scans, and is painful and expensive to remove.

09:46.520 --> 09:48.960
But the company is no longer supporting it.

09:48.960 --> 09:52.720
And this is a huge topic, but it just seems like obvious this is a direction we're going

09:52.720 --> 09:53.720
to go in.

09:53.720 --> 09:58.080
Your good buddy Elon Musk is working on a brain implant so you can code even better.

09:58.080 --> 10:00.560
So you can always be in the zone.

10:00.560 --> 10:06.080
And Andrew's looking at options and thinking, well, how do I pick something?

10:06.080 --> 10:07.520
How do I even navigate this?

10:07.520 --> 10:11.000
And I'm struggling to even come up with some basic answers for him.

10:11.000 --> 10:12.160
Yeah, I don't know.

10:12.160 --> 10:15.160
That's a real tough one.

10:15.160 --> 10:17.520
Ooh, that is a tough one.

10:17.520 --> 10:21.800
Yeah, I don't even know, see, it's an area I don't know too much about.

10:21.800 --> 10:25.280
Isn't there some kind of law that those kind of things have to be supported for the lifetime

10:25.280 --> 10:27.280
of the device itself?

10:27.280 --> 10:29.080
I mean, I don't think so.

10:29.080 --> 10:34.820
You know, I think of Karen Sandler, who works for the Software Freedom Conservancy.

10:34.820 --> 10:40.080
And she always tells the story about trying to get just the information on the pacemaker

10:40.080 --> 10:43.080
that she had to get installed at a young age.

10:43.080 --> 10:47.000
And just trying to even just talk to the medical industry about why a patient might want to

10:47.000 --> 10:49.480
have access to this information.

10:49.480 --> 10:51.600
And she views it as a free software issue.

10:51.600 --> 10:52.920
And I kind of agree with her.

10:52.920 --> 10:54.720
I think she makes a pretty good case for it.

10:54.720 --> 10:56.000
Oh, yeah, for sure.

10:56.000 --> 10:58.080
Something you're putting in your body.

10:58.080 --> 11:06.580
I can't think of a more, frankly, intimate device that you would want to know exactly

11:06.580 --> 11:10.400
how it works and what's the deal, what's the life expectancy.

11:10.400 --> 11:16.160
I also think of diabetics, who have pumps or measurement tools, and all of those are

11:16.160 --> 11:20.720
proprietary commercial products that connect back to a proprietary iPhone app or Android

11:20.720 --> 11:22.400
app.

11:22.400 --> 11:27.120
And while the grass is green, and you know, everybody's on board, and they're paying developers

11:27.120 --> 11:31.440
to develop the app and support it, like, great, it works.

11:31.440 --> 11:35.280
But this is something you need for your entire life.

11:35.280 --> 11:36.920
And what if one day those things go away?

11:36.920 --> 11:42.840
I think that's something we have to think a lot about, because my gut tells me, we as

11:42.840 --> 11:49.960
a society will rush into this, especially in competitive areas.

11:49.960 --> 11:54.680
You know, if you could get an implant in your brainstem, and you could learn kung fu in,

11:54.680 --> 12:00.120
if you can learn kung fu in like 15 seconds, would you seriously not be tempted by that?

12:00.120 --> 12:07.640
And if, you know, replace kung fu with anything, you know, what if tomorrow, you could somehow

12:07.640 --> 12:11.920
learn everything you needed to know about rust, that you could learn practically, that

12:11.920 --> 12:14.340
you don't learn by just doing?

12:14.340 --> 12:20.720
You could just plug in tomorrow, and be a technical rust expert.

12:20.720 --> 12:22.440
How could you say no to that?

12:22.440 --> 12:23.940
We're gonna rush into this like crazy.

12:23.940 --> 12:26.740
I feel like you definitely want to say no to that, right?

12:26.740 --> 12:30.900
I'm sorry, I just, it's funny, because we've talked about in the show, I have a heart condition,

12:30.900 --> 12:35.800
and they keep trying to build better modified hearts, right?

12:35.800 --> 12:41.320
And to their credit, the doctors doing this are, I mean, they're genuine innovation.

12:41.320 --> 12:47.600
But the last few they've done, the, what's almost all men, the men they put them in have,

12:47.600 --> 12:50.880
you know, they're fine, they're fine, they're fine, and then they just drop.

12:50.880 --> 12:57.840
Because oh, there's some unforeseen interaction between like, giving you this, it was in France,

12:57.840 --> 13:00.540
they built like a synthetic heart.

13:00.540 --> 13:05.200
And turns out, I forgot what killed him, it was like some kind of a weird electrical thing,

13:05.200 --> 13:10.880
he couldn't be around, but no one knew that, and he just died, right?

13:10.880 --> 13:16.080
I can't imagine putting something like you're saying into my brainstem, just because I want

13:16.080 --> 13:17.080
my Wi-Fi to work.

13:17.080 --> 13:24.120
I mean, because I want to learn Rust, and then maybe later, will I be unable, do you

13:24.120 --> 13:25.120
know what I mean?

13:25.120 --> 13:28.980
Will there be some weird interaction with some external force, or even an internal biological

13:28.980 --> 13:33.540
change in me, that then causes that implant or that chip to start malfunctioning?

13:33.540 --> 13:36.560
Or an injury, a car accident, you know, you hit that point.

13:36.560 --> 13:37.560
Anything, right?

13:37.560 --> 13:41.240
I forbid, you know, I'm the victim of a crime, and someone assaults me and hits me the wrong

13:41.240 --> 13:42.240
way, right?

13:42.240 --> 13:47.160
Or realistically, you know, Elon goes to Mars to become the king, his implant company closes

13:47.160 --> 13:51.680
up shop because of the lag time, and then you're left with an unsupported brainstem

13:51.680 --> 13:52.680
implant.

13:52.680 --> 13:57.400
Right, and it runs apt, and then you get two conflicting implants, and you just die.

13:57.400 --> 14:02.320
I mean, I don't know, I feel like, I almost feel, okay, the law doesn't exist, somebody's

14:02.320 --> 14:03.320
DMing me.

14:03.320 --> 14:07.640
But like, maybe there should be a law that says, for these products, you by law have

14:07.640 --> 14:09.480
to say how long you're going to support it.

14:09.480 --> 14:14.400
You know, these things exist, right, bonding, right, like a bound insurance policy, that

14:14.400 --> 14:19.360
if your company goes out of business, well, that insurance pays out to all the patients

14:19.360 --> 14:24.520
who've gotten this, because I would be so afraid of any of these new things.

14:24.520 --> 14:26.840
Even like mergers and acquisitions, right?

14:26.840 --> 14:31.800
Let's say that like, evil pharma company just buys out the little company that does your

14:31.800 --> 14:32.800
implant.

14:32.800 --> 14:35.080
If you've seen Repo, the genetic opera, it's bad.

14:35.080 --> 14:41.640
I mean, I just, I know that's dystopia, but best of luck to the writer.

14:41.640 --> 14:45.520
Well, if we have time, speaking of dystopia, if we have time, I want to tell you about

14:45.520 --> 14:47.960
my weekend in the metaverse, but we'll see if we get there.

14:47.960 --> 14:48.960
We'll see.

14:48.960 --> 14:50.880
Oh my God, why would you do that to yourself?

14:50.880 --> 14:51.880
I had to try it out.

14:51.880 --> 14:55.000
I had, I was gifted an Oculus, I had to try it out.

14:55.000 --> 14:56.880
Would you like to spend a weekend in Leavenworth too?

14:56.880 --> 14:57.880
It's probably better.

14:57.880 --> 15:00.320
You know, Leavenworth is a wonderful little town.

15:00.320 --> 15:03.440
If you're ever going to make it to the Pacific Northwest, it's a wonderful little town, but

15:03.440 --> 15:04.440
you better...

15:04.440 --> 15:07.320
Well, if I ever make it to the Pacific Northwest, that's probably where.

15:07.320 --> 15:10.640
It's a Bavarian themed town in the hills.

15:10.640 --> 15:12.000
It's pretty adorable, actually.

15:12.000 --> 15:13.320
In the winter, it's sort of perfect.

15:13.320 --> 15:17.880
Hey, before we go on, I just want to give a special shout out to the No Agenda program.

15:17.880 --> 15:21.920
The remix we played for your video game intro, we were told by a listener on Twitter, is

15:21.920 --> 15:24.160
from their show, and that checks out.

15:24.160 --> 15:29.240
They have an amazing community who is producing all kinds of jingles and whatnot for them

15:29.240 --> 15:31.520
all the time.

15:31.520 --> 15:35.720
We don't need to play it because it, you know, it's got the swear words and whatnot, but

15:35.720 --> 15:40.840
we wanted to give them a shout out because that's a fun jingle and it made Mike's day.

15:40.840 --> 15:41.840
That's what really matters.

15:41.840 --> 15:45.080
You know, I always see if I can make you smile with a soundboard clip.

15:45.080 --> 15:46.080
What was that about again?

15:46.080 --> 15:47.600
Is there a way we can glue this together?

15:47.600 --> 15:48.600
I don't know.

15:48.600 --> 15:51.120
I mean, yeah, it would be great, you know.

15:51.120 --> 15:54.720
Maybe Joe could come in and give him an atta boy.

15:54.720 --> 15:55.720
Woo!

15:55.720 --> 15:59.480
Linode.com slash coder.

15:59.480 --> 16:03.480
Go there to get $100 in 60 day credit on a new account and you go there to support the

16:03.480 --> 16:04.480
show.

16:04.480 --> 16:05.480
Linode is the developer's cloud.

16:05.480 --> 16:09.280
They got 11 data centers worldwide and they have been hard at work for 19 years creating

16:09.280 --> 16:13.200
the best experience to host your applications.

16:13.200 --> 16:17.040
If you like to build it yourself from the ground up or you're ready to deploy a stack

16:17.040 --> 16:20.080
that's going to get you set and going in minutes, they've got options for you.

16:20.080 --> 16:26.240
I'm saying like server admin for 20 years or this is your first project, they've got

16:26.240 --> 16:31.240
a route and a path for you and they've got the best customer support in the business.

16:31.240 --> 16:33.320
That is the number one thing I hear from the audience.

16:33.320 --> 16:37.680
Number two is the performance is incredible, but number one is the support.

16:37.680 --> 16:39.640
I hear that like, you know, something blew up.

16:39.640 --> 16:42.120
I did X, Y, Z. I had these questions.

16:42.120 --> 16:44.980
I know they just rolled out these new PCI MVME storage.

16:44.980 --> 16:46.280
Like how do I use that properly?

16:46.280 --> 16:48.000
They answered those questions.

16:48.000 --> 16:49.960
Linode nails it every single time.

16:49.960 --> 16:51.440
The performance is incredible.

16:51.440 --> 16:52.440
That's what I love about it.

16:52.440 --> 16:54.080
That's what made me stick with it.

16:54.080 --> 16:59.520
And now we use Linode for basically just about every bit of hosting we've built that is audience

16:59.520 --> 17:04.360
facing and just about every little bit of hosting we've built that is internally facing

17:04.360 --> 17:05.960
as well.

17:05.960 --> 17:07.840
They really are just always making it better too.

17:07.840 --> 17:10.740
So if you go try it for a little bit, you'll see what I'm talking about.

17:10.740 --> 17:14.760
How the dashboard works, how the information you get when you glance at your system so

17:14.760 --> 17:19.540
you get an idea of how it's doing overall, how they clearly explain what the backup state

17:19.540 --> 17:24.520
is and how simple it is to take advantage of their API with their command line client

17:24.520 --> 17:29.760
or Python libraries or you name it, they've got support for it.

17:29.760 --> 17:31.920
So go get that $100 and really try it out.

17:31.920 --> 17:38.960
Go build something and support the show, linode.com slash coder.

17:38.960 --> 17:43.480
So today we find out that Chris Ladner has left the Swift core team.

17:43.480 --> 17:47.760
He writes, to answer your question, the root cause of my decision to leave the core team

17:47.760 --> 17:51.160
is a toxic environment in the meetings themselves.

17:51.160 --> 17:54.920
The catalyst was a specific meeting last summer.

17:54.920 --> 17:59.560
After being insulted and yelled at over a WebEx, not the first time and not just one

17:59.560 --> 18:02.960
core team member, I decided to take a break.

18:02.960 --> 18:07.680
I was able to get leadership to eventually discuss the situation with me last fall, but

18:07.680 --> 18:11.920
after avoiding dealing with it, they made excuses and made it clear they weren't planning

18:11.920 --> 18:13.420
to do anything about it.

18:13.420 --> 18:16.720
As such, I decided not to return.

18:16.720 --> 18:22.240
They reassure me that they want to, quote, make sure things are better for others in

18:22.240 --> 18:26.640
the future based on what we've talked about, end quote.

18:26.640 --> 18:31.840
And then the core team announced today that they are going to restructure the team's leadership

18:31.840 --> 18:33.360
in the wake of this announcement.

18:33.360 --> 18:37.220
But when you dig into it, it looks like Ladner has really been out since last summer.

18:37.220 --> 18:40.480
And it's just everybody in the public is figuring it out now.

18:40.480 --> 18:41.480
What's your take?

18:41.480 --> 18:44.120
You're more into the whole community like hippie stuff.

18:44.120 --> 18:51.360
But what I know of Ladner is he seems like a pretty reasonable, level-headed, practical

18:51.360 --> 18:52.360
person.

18:52.360 --> 18:57.960
However, this comes on pretty hot, you know, when you start throwing around toxic environment

18:57.960 --> 19:01.720
and that you were getting yelled at, those are some strong accusations.

19:01.720 --> 19:05.680
And I hope that's not true because nobody should be getting yelled at in a work environment.

19:05.680 --> 19:11.440
But I wish we knew both sides of this story in particular because I can't help but feel

19:11.440 --> 19:16.440
in the back of my mind that rockstar mentality still is a thing.

19:16.440 --> 19:19.440
Somebody can get big enough where they can be like, I'm not getting the respect I deserve.

19:19.440 --> 19:22.480
I've said this is the way it is and this is the way it is and you're fighting, why are

19:22.480 --> 19:23.480
you arguing with me?

19:23.480 --> 19:27.260
You know, and that can also be their perspective sometimes and they don't necessarily realize

19:27.260 --> 19:29.520
that's the standpoint they're coming from.

19:29.520 --> 19:31.960
And that can also add friction in a team meeting.

19:31.960 --> 19:35.640
So it's hard to really know what's going on here.

19:35.640 --> 19:38.480
I don't think it's the end of the day for Swift.

19:38.480 --> 19:39.800
I think Swift is going to be just fine.

19:39.800 --> 19:44.880
You know, I think it's interesting that we're getting the story very shortly after we got

19:44.880 --> 19:48.960
some more about the Rust brouhaha.

19:48.960 --> 19:55.000
And it definitely seems like these modes of community management and engagement are, I

19:55.000 --> 20:00.400
don't want to say like being a problem, I think they're changing somehow, right?

20:00.400 --> 20:03.280
I mean, if you want to laugh, read the old Linux mailing list.

20:03.280 --> 20:06.120
It's a woo!

20:06.120 --> 20:12.420
Things get heated or honestly old Linux message boards and somebody, some poor bastard would

20:12.420 --> 20:16.160
come in with a username that had Mike in it and say he was running Mint and people would

20:16.160 --> 20:17.160
be mean to him.

20:17.160 --> 20:19.020
I'm not bitter.

20:19.020 --> 20:21.160
My wife, I worked back then.

20:21.160 --> 20:22.160
Back then?

20:22.160 --> 20:26.920
Back in my day, you just turned the damn thing on and put in the WEP key.

20:26.920 --> 20:27.920
I don't know.

20:27.920 --> 20:34.520
I see this is where I have very little patience for a lot of the like political community

20:34.520 --> 20:35.520
stuff.

20:35.520 --> 20:39.320
Are we seeing more of this or is it just my perception of being like cranky and old and

20:39.320 --> 20:40.320
being a little?

20:40.320 --> 20:41.600
I think everyone is cooked.

20:41.600 --> 20:42.600
Okay.

20:42.600 --> 20:45.000
I think, you know, you're seeing more stories about fights on airplanes.

20:45.000 --> 20:47.520
You're seeing more stories about community fights.

20:47.520 --> 20:52.800
It's just everyone's fried from the last couple of years is what my sense of it is.

20:52.800 --> 20:58.760
I also, reading through all of this, got the sense that Ladner has been concerned about

20:58.760 --> 21:01.360
the technical direction of SWIT for a little bit.

21:01.360 --> 21:05.160
And so you could see how that also adds some friction to the situation.

21:05.160 --> 21:09.720
And I also wonder if the people yelling at him were Apple employees and what Apple's

21:09.720 --> 21:11.600
policy is around that kind of stuff.

21:11.600 --> 21:16.440
I mean, I would imagine if we were to draw a Venn diagram, you know, important people

21:16.440 --> 21:23.160
in the SWIFT projects, people employed by Apple who work on the SWIFT project is probably,

21:23.160 --> 21:26.280
you know, there's a big intersection there, I would assume.

21:26.280 --> 21:30.760
The part that does ring true to his overall point here is that there was yelling going

21:30.760 --> 21:31.760
on.

21:31.760 --> 21:32.760
I bet that is true.

21:32.760 --> 21:35.920
Yeah, that's probably a sign it's time to check out, get out, you know, he doesn't need

21:35.920 --> 21:36.920
to stick around for that.

21:36.920 --> 21:41.960
Also, you got to remember the initial pitch for SWIFT was it was going to be like scale

21:41.960 --> 21:45.620
from scripting to systems development.

21:45.620 --> 21:48.440
That is not a easy nut to crack.

21:48.440 --> 21:52.280
Well, the thing that got you all hot and bothered this week is that Microsoft is apparently

21:52.280 --> 21:58.600
going to require future versions of Windows 11 Pro to have a Microsoft account, even at

21:58.600 --> 21:59.600
setup.

21:59.600 --> 22:04.360
This is something they started doing with Windows like home, and now in the newer versions

22:04.360 --> 22:08.000
of Windows 11, it's still in the like early dev channel.

22:08.000 --> 22:13.080
They've made some improvements, some UI changes, some do not disturb improvements.

22:13.080 --> 22:22.560
But the big new thing is that you can no longer create a local user account for even Windows

22:22.560 --> 22:24.840
11 Pro.

22:24.840 --> 22:28.520
You'll have to use a Microsoft account, you'll have to have an internet connection while

22:28.520 --> 22:30.000
you're setting the computer up.

22:30.000 --> 22:31.800
Now, obviously, Microsoft could change this.

22:31.800 --> 22:36.360
Yeah, this also means though, this is where this kind of grinds my gears to quote Peter

22:36.360 --> 22:37.880
Griffith.

22:37.880 --> 22:45.120
If you are doing what I frequently do, which is purchase Surface Go or Surface tablets,

22:45.120 --> 22:49.800
and just not configure them with user accounts to give to customers as like, you know, this

22:49.800 --> 22:54.360
is your kiosk, that is now not really possible.

22:54.360 --> 22:57.260
You have to buy the special license.

22:57.260 --> 23:01.000
It's funny, like I saw the comments on this I read as Oh, so you're screwing little companies

23:01.000 --> 23:06.080
who like, basically just code to Windows because every literally the nice thing about Windows

23:06.080 --> 23:11.920
is there any random piece of crap I buy on AliExpress for a like dongle or whatever,

23:11.920 --> 23:15.560
almost certainly has a very shoddy, but existing Windows driver.

23:15.560 --> 23:20.040
For those who don't know, AliExpress is like, it's like a Chinese Walmart, but they sell

23:20.040 --> 23:21.040
lots of parts.

23:21.040 --> 23:22.040
Is that fair?

23:22.040 --> 23:23.680
Or Chinese Amazon, I should say?

23:23.680 --> 23:28.280
Yeah, Amazon and Walmart and one maybe, and also eBay, a little bit of an eBay.

23:28.280 --> 23:29.280
A little bit of an eBay.

23:29.280 --> 23:30.280
It's weird.

23:30.280 --> 23:33.960
You can buy like, but you can buy like a random just like, I plug this in and it does NFC

23:33.960 --> 23:34.960
reading, right?

23:34.960 --> 23:39.400
Yeah, yeah, lots of weird random components and parts and gadgets.

23:39.400 --> 23:43.520
And one of the nice things is, you know, these manufacturers all assume that you're running

23:43.520 --> 23:44.520
Windows.

23:44.520 --> 23:47.800
A lot of them also support some variants of Linux.

23:47.800 --> 23:53.520
And that just become a whole of a hell of a lot less really cost effective, right?

23:53.520 --> 23:54.520
I don't like it.

23:54.520 --> 23:55.920
I think you should be able to own your device.

23:55.920 --> 23:56.920
Well, yeah.

23:56.920 --> 23:59.040
And what about those of us that have young kids?

23:59.040 --> 24:01.840
Like, I mean, my kids are not using Windows.

24:01.840 --> 24:06.120
But if they were, I would not want my seven year old daughter to need a Microsoft account.

24:06.120 --> 24:09.480
I don't want to log her into my Microsoft account.

24:09.480 --> 24:11.480
Local accounts are what I would always use for my kids.

24:11.480 --> 24:12.800
I have that exact problem.

24:12.800 --> 24:14.700
My son wants to play Xbox.

24:14.700 --> 24:18.080
And it's like one thing for him to play Minecraft or Plants vs Zombies, right?

24:18.080 --> 24:19.080
I don't care.

24:19.080 --> 24:20.120
Go ahead.

24:20.120 --> 24:22.400
Like when he's logged in as me, he's me, right?

24:22.400 --> 24:24.960
He can just like go in and do stuff.

24:24.960 --> 24:28.320
So if you were going to bet on this, do you think Microsoft tweaks this?

24:28.320 --> 24:30.960
I mean, they already do it for home.

24:30.960 --> 24:33.640
So it's I mean, that's the part that makes me think this might be a lock.

24:33.640 --> 24:37.640
I think what they'll do is what they tend to do have like some super duper enterprise

24:37.640 --> 24:40.800
plan where you go through a salesman, right?

24:40.800 --> 24:42.760
And you can just get around this.

24:42.760 --> 24:47.320
Yeah, I can think if you buy some of the business versions of Windows like already, yeah, but

24:47.320 --> 24:48.320
they cost more money.

24:48.320 --> 24:53.160
I mean, I was just dunking on I wasn't dunking, but I'm a little irritated with the whole

24:53.160 --> 24:55.200
Wi-Fi problem I'm having.

24:55.200 --> 25:01.160
But this is why I'm still super bullish on Linux because, you know, if let's just say

25:01.160 --> 25:05.720
system 76 pulls some nonsense and it's like, oh, you have to have a pop account.

25:05.720 --> 25:08.960
Please never even make that a thing.

25:08.960 --> 25:09.960
Just don't.

25:09.960 --> 25:10.960
You didn't hear that, Carl.

25:10.960 --> 25:11.960
Leave it alone.

25:11.960 --> 25:15.040
I could be like, all right, screw you.

25:15.040 --> 25:17.280
I'm putting on my fedora with Chris, right?

25:17.280 --> 25:18.440
We're going fedora land.

25:18.440 --> 25:19.440
Let's go.

25:19.440 --> 25:20.440
Ha, ha.

25:20.440 --> 25:23.760
And you know, if you're doing embedded devices, there is only one true base OS.

25:23.760 --> 25:24.760
It's called Debian.

25:24.760 --> 25:25.760
It's great.

25:25.760 --> 25:28.080
And also, if it's a server, you could use SUSE.

25:28.080 --> 25:29.160
I like SUSE.

25:29.160 --> 25:30.160
I have a plushie.

25:30.160 --> 25:34.520
You know, my take on this, and this has been my take now for a very, very, very long time

25:34.520 --> 25:38.440
is I have always found when I worked in the industry professionally and looking at it

25:38.440 --> 25:45.080
now as a consumer, I have always found the multiple versions of Windows to be ridiculously

25:45.080 --> 25:50.200
stupid and annoying because we all know it's normalized now.

25:50.200 --> 25:51.200
It's the same thing.

25:51.200 --> 25:53.200
They just unlock the features.

25:53.200 --> 25:54.200
Yep.

25:54.200 --> 25:58.600
It's stupid, arbitrary, marketing dividing lines that they've created to productize a

25:58.600 --> 26:03.240
lineup to make a good, better, best type lineup.

26:03.240 --> 26:05.000
And it's so lame.

26:05.000 --> 26:10.800
One of the things I'm really glad that Apple dropped years ago is that stupid, lame pretense.

26:10.800 --> 26:14.240
And I wish there was just Windows.

26:14.240 --> 26:18.280
You could have pre-setup modes or some stupid crap like that because you know they'd have

26:18.280 --> 26:19.280
to have that.

26:19.280 --> 26:21.000
But I've always found that really annoying.

26:21.000 --> 26:23.780
It feels something like it's out of the 80s or 90s.

26:23.780 --> 26:29.180
It definitely absolutely is something that the biz exec sales type people come up with.

26:29.180 --> 26:32.720
It's not something the engineers are fighting for.

26:32.720 --> 26:39.520
And then they are, of course, from above, dictating from a sales perspective to the

26:39.520 --> 26:44.200
engineering team what features get locked up and how and they have to create all of

26:44.200 --> 26:45.980
that and make all of it possible.

26:45.980 --> 26:50.740
And so it just creates work that's even outside the scope of just working on the core OS features

26:50.740 --> 26:52.220
and bugs.

26:52.220 --> 26:54.200
It's so lame.

26:54.200 --> 26:58.200
And it's a way to price gouge consumers for something that costs them the same amount

26:58.200 --> 26:59.200
to make.

26:59.200 --> 27:04.560
I mean, it is what it is and Microsoft knows better than I do, but I've always found that

27:04.560 --> 27:07.180
such a distasteful aspect of Windows.

27:07.180 --> 27:13.120
And now they're really rubbing it in your face with this stuff because now you've got

27:13.120 --> 27:16.960
to buy an even more expensive version of something that's exactly the same thing as the cheaper

27:16.960 --> 27:21.640
version but just doesn't have this absolutely lame limitation.

27:21.640 --> 27:25.200
I wonder if maybe they're not just trying to squeeze money out of Windows.

27:25.200 --> 27:28.540
Maybe this is everybody's a services company now, right?

27:28.540 --> 27:31.120
Nobody wants to just like make the thing and sell it to you.

27:31.120 --> 27:32.120
Yeah.

27:32.120 --> 27:33.120
You know what?

27:33.120 --> 27:36.040
Watch them in two years start bragging about how many, you know, Microsoft accounts, active

27:36.040 --> 27:37.400
Microsoft accounts they have.

27:37.400 --> 27:38.400
I bet that's what it is.

27:38.400 --> 27:39.400
Cause it isn't isn't.

27:39.400 --> 27:40.400
Yeah.

27:40.400 --> 27:42.660
Cause my Xbox account is just my personal email.

27:42.660 --> 27:44.280
So that is a Microsoft account.

27:44.280 --> 27:48.360
If they can get you to get that account created and set up at go when you're installing the

27:48.360 --> 27:51.500
PC, then you're already logged into the store, man.

27:51.500 --> 27:53.400
You're already one step closer.

27:53.400 --> 27:54.840
That little friction point's been removed.

27:54.840 --> 27:57.880
Wait, is it going to be like Chrome where it can't understand that I have two versions

27:57.880 --> 27:58.880
of me?

27:58.880 --> 27:59.880
One's my personal email.

27:59.880 --> 28:01.600
One's my, the mad botter one that has all the licenses.

28:01.600 --> 28:02.600
Oh God.

28:02.600 --> 28:05.600
Oh, just no, just no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

28:05.600 --> 28:06.600
no accounts.

29:17.600 --> 29:23.240
So Coinbase has kind of just said the quiet part out loud about the App Store that really

29:23.240 --> 29:25.640
just puts it all in perspective.

29:25.640 --> 29:32.200
Coinbase's CEO Brian Armstrong wrote on February 4th, quote, for any app to be listed in Apple

29:32.200 --> 29:36.600
and Google's app stores, it needs to play by the rules of those two companies.

29:36.600 --> 29:44.120
He goes on to say, our approach is to be free speech supporters, but not free speech martyrs.

29:44.120 --> 29:47.480
And so he's essentially saying if a critical partner such as Apple or Google objects to

29:47.480 --> 29:53.720
something and requires its removal, they won't even fight it, they just remove the feature

29:53.720 --> 29:57.560
and they don't bother engaging with that aspect of the business as a company.

29:57.560 --> 30:00.840
They just say, all right, we wanted to try that thing.

30:00.840 --> 30:05.020
Apple has told us no, so Coinbase isn't getting into that business.

30:05.020 --> 30:11.840
That's the level of power Apple has now as a gatekeeper, as queen of the mobile land.

30:11.840 --> 30:17.760
Well, the alternative is you get beheaded by the queen, ala Alice in Wonderland.

30:17.760 --> 30:20.560
So this is dark in a few ways to me.

30:20.560 --> 30:24.960
Coinbase represents a nascent business and a nascent industry that is developing very,

30:24.960 --> 30:28.240
very rapidly and is extremely competitive.

30:28.240 --> 30:35.260
The exchange aspect of the cryptocurrency market is the most competitive element of

30:35.260 --> 30:37.320
the market, I would imagine.

30:37.320 --> 30:41.180
And other exchanges are constantly adding features.

30:41.180 --> 30:44.440
And some of them give zero about Apple.

30:44.440 --> 30:45.960
And so some of them do.

30:45.960 --> 30:50.280
And what some of them have done have just created simplified versions of their exchange

30:50.280 --> 30:52.920
that they release as an app for the iOS app store.

30:52.920 --> 30:56.500
And then if you want the full thing, you go to the web page.

30:56.500 --> 31:00.600
But Coinbase has kind of just gone the opposite route and just said, no, we're not even really

31:00.600 --> 31:05.780
concerned about it as an entire business objective if we can't ship it through the app store.

31:05.780 --> 31:09.260
That to me is almost a chilling effect on a nascent industry.

31:09.260 --> 31:14.520
It's concerning because Coinbase is the largest in the US in this industry.

31:14.520 --> 31:19.280
And if they're essentially cow towing, you can imagine this is an industry wide problem.

31:19.280 --> 31:23.880
Not to say this is a good thing, but what would you have them do that doesn't destroy

31:23.880 --> 31:24.880
their business?

31:24.880 --> 31:26.640
You're stuck with the app store rules.

31:26.640 --> 31:27.640
You're stuck.

31:27.640 --> 31:31.360
If you're the CEO of Coinbase, you have investors.

31:31.360 --> 31:36.080
And I know, you know, we can listen to Scott Galloway and Kara Swisher, who are usually

31:36.080 --> 31:39.560
right about this, that a lot of the founders basically control their boards.

31:39.560 --> 31:43.220
But I don't think any founder can walk into the board and be like, all right, guys, here's

31:43.220 --> 31:44.220
the plan.

31:44.220 --> 31:46.760
We're going to piss off Apple and they're going to throw us off the app store.

31:46.760 --> 31:47.760
All right.

31:47.760 --> 31:48.760
Tim Sweeney aside.

31:48.760 --> 31:49.760
Yeah.

31:49.760 --> 31:50.760
It's a it's a rare thing.

31:50.760 --> 31:51.760
You're right.

31:51.760 --> 31:52.760
Well, that just proves the point.

31:52.760 --> 31:53.760
Yeah.

31:53.760 --> 31:56.080
So it's kind of like in the board would say, no vote of no confidence.

31:56.080 --> 31:57.360
Bye, buddy.

31:57.360 --> 32:03.720
You have to if I mean, if I was making a piece of consumer software, I wouldn't even consider

32:03.720 --> 32:05.360
not putting it on iOS.

32:05.360 --> 32:08.640
I suppose it doesn't surprise us.

32:08.640 --> 32:13.440
But I think it's noteworthy because it is somebody saying out loud what we've been what

32:13.440 --> 32:17.040
we've really been speculating for a while and they're just kind of outwardly admitting

32:17.040 --> 32:19.480
it and they're just kind of admitting it as well.

32:19.480 --> 32:21.960
This is the cost of doing business in this segment.

32:21.960 --> 32:22.960
That's remarkable.

32:22.960 --> 32:27.740
And it makes me wonder if in 20 years we'll look back or even 10 years because things

32:27.740 --> 32:28.740
change pretty quick.

32:28.740 --> 32:34.880
We look back and we realize just how Google and Apple shaped the worlds that we lived

32:34.880 --> 32:39.640
in, how they really controlled what comes to market and what doesn't from not just a

32:39.640 --> 32:44.760
software standpoint, but from a chip and silicon standpoint to all of it.

32:44.760 --> 32:45.760
Right.

32:45.760 --> 32:52.040
So they are setting the pace from everything from car infotainment systems to wearables.

32:52.040 --> 32:54.880
And it's remarkable the controlling grip that they have.

32:54.880 --> 32:57.880
And I think this just demonstrated it to me.

32:57.880 --> 33:01.040
And meanwhile, everybody's freaking out about Facebook, you know, and they're like this

33:01.040 --> 33:02.040
little punk kid.

33:02.040 --> 33:03.040
So, OK.

33:03.040 --> 33:04.040
How are you feeling?

33:04.040 --> 33:05.040
I'm all right.

33:05.040 --> 33:07.840
I mean, it's a little boring.

33:07.840 --> 33:13.080
You know, it's could use a little more transport effects and and popcorn.

33:13.080 --> 33:15.760
So what did you do in Metaverse?

33:15.760 --> 33:20.800
I was really I've been thinking about getting an Oculus Quest recently because I know, I

33:20.800 --> 33:21.800
know, I know.

33:21.800 --> 33:26.240
But I just don't I hate I hate to, you know, run my mouth and not have any idea what I'm

33:26.240 --> 33:27.420
talking about.

33:27.420 --> 33:34.760
So a family member, close family member gifted one to me for my birthday, slightly used,

33:34.760 --> 33:39.080
but in pretty great shape still reactivated my Facebook, I guess, we logged into my Facebook

33:39.080 --> 33:41.040
account for like the first time in two years.

33:41.040 --> 33:43.880
It was never gone, Chris, don't worry.

33:43.880 --> 33:44.880
Set it all up.

33:44.880 --> 33:49.800
And what really pushed it over into something I was actually actively interested in trying

33:49.800 --> 33:56.220
is when I realized that they have these apps to build, like your ultimate virtual home

33:56.220 --> 33:58.800
office that goes with you wherever you go.

33:58.800 --> 34:06.520
And so you picture me right in Lady Joop's, the RV, I can sit up front in a seat and create

34:06.520 --> 34:09.620
a beautiful working environment.

34:09.620 --> 34:16.040
So what I have right now is a studio log cabin with beautiful wood paneling ceiling, panoramic

34:16.040 --> 34:20.960
windows that are it's on top of a hill and down below me is a lake with fog and it's

34:20.960 --> 34:21.960
often raining.

34:21.960 --> 34:28.360
So there's raindrops coming down the window and I'm on a giant couch and I have a giant,

34:28.360 --> 34:33.920
probably 120 inch screen above me, in front of me and two to my side.

34:33.920 --> 34:39.280
And they are bringing in windows from my actual computer and I'm using my keyboard and mouse

34:39.280 --> 34:42.240
and it's a pretty fun, nice, chill way to work.

34:42.240 --> 34:45.680
All right, so you're sitting, you're in the front seat of Lady Joop's, you've got the

34:45.680 --> 34:46.680
Oculus on, physically.

34:46.680 --> 34:51.480
And I've got my computer up front with me and my keyboard and mouse is up there in this

34:51.480 --> 34:52.480
spot.

34:52.480 --> 34:53.960
Is it running some software on your computer?

34:53.960 --> 34:54.960
Yes.

34:54.960 --> 34:57.640
Is your computer still running Fedora?

34:57.640 --> 35:02.840
You can use it with one monitor with Fedora and you can use it with multiple screens with

35:02.840 --> 35:03.840
the Mac and Windows.

35:03.840 --> 35:06.360
So wait, is it a monitor to virtual monitor situation?

35:06.360 --> 35:11.760
Yeah, it creates virtual monitors in there and then it also brings in your primary screen.

35:11.760 --> 35:12.760
Huh.

35:12.760 --> 35:13.760
What's the limitation on Linux?

35:13.760 --> 35:15.440
Is it just they haven't done it yet?

35:15.440 --> 35:16.440
Yeah, I don't know.

35:16.440 --> 35:17.920
I think it's just maybe they just haven't developed it out.

35:17.920 --> 35:18.920
It's still kind of new.

35:18.920 --> 35:21.280
The app I'm using is called Immersed, but there are several of them, so there might

35:21.280 --> 35:23.460
be other ones that have better support.

35:23.460 --> 35:24.460
How does it look though?

35:24.460 --> 35:25.460
Like you can't...

35:25.460 --> 35:26.460
It works pretty good.

35:26.460 --> 35:27.460
It looks pretty good.

35:27.460 --> 35:31.320
The resolution of the actual Oculus itself could be better and that is something I'm

35:31.320 --> 35:33.480
sure they'll do with the Oculus 3.

35:33.480 --> 35:37.000
But I've used it so far for a couple of hours.

35:37.000 --> 35:41.380
I would say I felt like I had more room, it just made me feel like I had more space.

35:41.380 --> 35:44.040
And the other thing that's fascinating is then I brought it here to the studio, put

35:44.040 --> 35:45.880
it on and I had like the same exact working environment.

35:45.880 --> 35:51.480
I thought, oh, there's some efficiencies in creating one ultimate virtual office and then

35:51.480 --> 35:53.200
bringing that with me.

35:53.200 --> 35:57.960
The only limitation is it needs to be connected to a computer to bring in computer screens.

35:57.960 --> 36:03.160
And if the Oculus was more powerful, you could, in theory, run those applications on the

36:03.160 --> 36:04.880
Oculus directly.

36:04.880 --> 36:07.240
And that's where I realized Apple's going.

36:07.240 --> 36:11.760
That's why they're putting M1s in their headset and they're going to charge $2,000 and put

36:11.760 --> 36:13.400
an 8K screen in there.

36:13.400 --> 36:18.840
Because if you put a real beefy CPU in that thing and you up the resolution just a tiny

36:18.840 --> 36:20.620
bit, it's there.

36:20.620 --> 36:22.220
It's so close.

36:22.220 --> 36:23.760
It's so close.

36:23.760 --> 36:25.200
It's alarmingly close.

36:25.200 --> 36:28.280
I did not expect it to be as polished as it was.

36:28.280 --> 36:35.120
The UI to navigate the thing, the experiences, the apps around it, the Oculus app ecosystem.

36:35.120 --> 36:39.280
I even found out there's a whole ecosystem called the side quest ecosystem where you

36:39.280 --> 36:43.400
put the quest into developer mode and you can sideload a whole bunch of VR apps that

36:43.400 --> 36:45.960
aren't in the official store.

36:45.960 --> 36:48.040
It's impressive.

36:48.040 --> 36:50.840
And you wouldn't even really know it's Android.

36:50.840 --> 36:52.120
It's really well done.

36:52.120 --> 36:56.400
And I could definitely see Apple executing on something like this.

36:56.400 --> 37:04.280
And if they integrated this headset with Mac OS or with iPad OS, it would be fire.

37:04.280 --> 37:06.180
It would be unbelievable.

37:06.180 --> 37:10.880
It could be such a great, if I could put on the headset and essentially have my entire

37:10.880 --> 37:14.640
computing environment, huge.

37:14.640 --> 37:15.680
It was great.

37:15.680 --> 37:17.580
And you can have giant screens.

37:17.580 --> 37:19.800
You can have unlimited space.

37:19.800 --> 37:22.940
And then I can have multiple rooms and you can bring other people in.

37:22.940 --> 37:26.520
Oh, last thing, but this was also so great.

37:26.520 --> 37:34.320
You can bring in a virtual web camera that shows up as a video device on your computer.

37:34.320 --> 37:40.240
And you can join Zoom calls and whatnot from your virtual office as your virtual avatar.

37:40.240 --> 37:45.840
And you can place the camera anywhere in the 360 degree space and participate in a Zoom

37:45.840 --> 37:47.560
meeting from your virtual office.

37:47.560 --> 37:48.560
Okay.

37:48.560 --> 37:51.040
So when they see you, are they seeing your avatar or are they...

37:51.040 --> 37:52.040
Yeah.

37:52.040 --> 37:53.640
Are they seeing your avatar chilling in your cool pad?

37:53.640 --> 37:55.000
Does your avatar move with you?

37:55.000 --> 37:56.000
Yeah.

37:56.000 --> 37:58.840
And it uses the microphone to move the lips when you talk.

37:58.840 --> 38:03.360
The motion tracking is insanely precise.

38:03.360 --> 38:04.860
The most precise I've ever experienced.

38:04.860 --> 38:07.200
So every little nuance it's aware of.

38:07.200 --> 38:08.200
Okay.

38:08.200 --> 38:12.480
So in theory, if I got one of these, we could do the show.

38:12.480 --> 38:15.560
I could invite you into my chill pad or there's several...

38:15.560 --> 38:18.540
This is one of the big areas is these social things.

38:18.540 --> 38:22.360
One is called like big room or big screen or something like that.

38:22.360 --> 38:25.560
You get a home theater that you can invite people into and they even provide some of

38:25.560 --> 38:26.560
the streaming content.

38:26.560 --> 38:30.660
So like last night I was watching Star Trek TNG in a virtual living room.

38:30.660 --> 38:33.600
I could bring other people in and they could hang out at my couch and we could watch it

38:33.600 --> 38:34.720
and we see each other in real time.

38:34.720 --> 38:37.100
We talk and we're synchronized video playback.

38:37.100 --> 38:38.100
It's pretty neat.

38:38.100 --> 38:39.100
Oh man.

38:39.100 --> 38:40.920
I might have to actually try this.

38:40.920 --> 38:45.820
I'd say it's better than I expected with the caveat that I can still see they have room

38:45.820 --> 38:46.820
to improve.

38:46.820 --> 38:48.680
The battery life needs to be better.

38:48.680 --> 38:52.680
I think it needs a little more horsepower, but it's surprisingly how well polished it

38:52.680 --> 38:57.320
is and you can stream what people are seeing in VR to your phone or to your desktop.

38:57.320 --> 38:59.920
I think it's just using like Chromecast or something.

38:59.920 --> 39:02.740
So you can help people navigate it by watching on your phone.

39:02.740 --> 39:06.580
Then you can tap a button on the app and it brings up the camera and you can do a side

39:06.580 --> 39:11.320
by side capture of what they are seeing in VR and of course what your camera phone is

39:11.320 --> 39:15.680
actually getting in real life and you can create a little side by side video inside

39:15.680 --> 39:18.900
the Oculus app to capture the experience.

39:18.900 --> 39:19.900
Pretty neat.

39:19.900 --> 39:24.160
Or you can go full screen on their VR and see what they're seeing and you can even launch

39:24.160 --> 39:28.160
some apps for them and change a few settings, which is great when you're demonstrating it

39:28.160 --> 39:29.160
for people.

39:29.160 --> 39:34.400
And you can play Resident Evil 4 because that game was on every platform apparently.

39:34.400 --> 39:36.440
I got Quake 2 last night because of course.

39:36.440 --> 39:37.440
Did you really?

39:37.440 --> 39:41.600
And I got motion sick like an old man.

39:41.600 --> 39:44.320
It really, you move quick in Quake 2.

39:44.320 --> 39:46.520
That was some twitchy first person shooting.

39:46.520 --> 39:48.600
That was really something.

39:48.600 --> 39:52.160
The YouTube VR is surprisingly good too because those are real life images.

39:52.160 --> 39:54.280
So it's as high res as it gets.

39:54.280 --> 39:55.880
This actually does some kind of cool crap.

39:55.880 --> 39:56.960
I know.

39:56.960 --> 40:02.000
After I've used it, I have so little doubt that Apple's working on one of these and that

40:02.000 --> 40:06.000
it's probably not that far away and that I'm probably going to want it.

40:06.000 --> 40:10.280
If they integrate it with the Mac or they integrate it with your phone or tablet where

40:10.280 --> 40:14.840
you can bring those apps in, it's going to be huge.

40:14.840 --> 40:16.200
Oh man.

40:16.200 --> 40:19.900
Very excited because you don't need to buy a big monitor ever again.

40:19.900 --> 40:22.280
You no longer need to buy multiple screens.

40:22.280 --> 40:24.620
I don't need to even worry about a fancy office.

40:24.620 --> 40:29.840
I could be sitting in a little podunk closet and put that thing on and feel like I am in

40:29.840 --> 40:32.760
a beautiful wood cabin.

40:32.760 --> 40:33.760
It's so awesome.

40:33.760 --> 40:34.760
Vader Immortal pack.

40:34.760 --> 40:35.760
Oh yeah.

40:35.760 --> 40:36.760
Yeah.

40:36.760 --> 40:37.760
All right.

40:37.760 --> 40:38.760
I'm buying one.

40:38.760 --> 40:39.760
That's it.

40:39.760 --> 40:40.760
That's what I'm going to do.

40:40.760 --> 40:41.760
Here we go.

40:41.760 --> 40:42.760
Damn it.

40:42.760 --> 40:43.760
Now I want to build something.

40:43.760 --> 40:45.560
Give Apple 30 percent because you know theirs is going to be better.

40:45.560 --> 40:46.560
Oh yeah.

40:46.560 --> 40:47.800
But it's going to be like two thousand dollars.

40:47.800 --> 40:49.880
How much are people paying for GPUs right now?

40:49.880 --> 40:50.880
Oh you're right.

40:50.880 --> 40:51.880
You're right.

40:51.880 --> 40:52.880
You can later too.

40:52.880 --> 40:56.560
You can get a cable to connect it to your computer and you can actually do PC VR games

40:56.560 --> 40:57.560
as well.

40:57.560 --> 40:58.560
Oh wow.

40:58.560 --> 41:02.160
But I actually think the charm of this thing is that it's totally enclosed like a like

41:02.160 --> 41:03.440
a switch.

41:03.440 --> 41:05.040
You know you don't need any computer.

41:05.040 --> 41:08.040
I got it through a family member who got an Amazon refurbished so they got a refurbished

41:08.040 --> 41:09.040
unit.

41:09.040 --> 41:13.280
I bought them and they gave it to me for like a birthday discount for like 180 bucks.

41:13.280 --> 41:14.560
But I was trying to talk West into it.

41:14.560 --> 41:20.080
I found one on Amazon for 350 bucks and that seems like an outrageously great deal too

41:20.080 --> 41:23.120
because when I was pricing it initially after all the accessories I was expecting to pay

41:23.120 --> 41:25.160
like seven hundred dollars.

41:25.160 --> 41:26.160
Yeah.

41:26.160 --> 41:27.400
I mean there's a range of prices you can pay.

41:27.400 --> 41:29.200
If you buy it directly you're going to pay more.

41:29.200 --> 41:30.620
But if you buy it used.

41:30.620 --> 41:32.360
So what accessories do you actually need?

41:32.360 --> 41:36.000
There's all kinds of accessories but I just I picked up a case from Amazon.

41:36.000 --> 41:37.160
I've got it from my dad.

41:37.160 --> 41:41.760
So my dad had like covers for the joysticks or whatever they're called the little handle

41:41.760 --> 41:42.760
things.

41:42.760 --> 41:43.960
But I don't like those.

41:43.960 --> 41:49.380
The thing that really strikes me about it is there is an impressive amount of technology

41:49.380 --> 41:50.760
built in that little headset.

41:50.760 --> 41:53.560
Like it is doing an incredible amount of things.

41:53.560 --> 41:57.260
The Oculus team is at the top of their game.

41:57.260 --> 42:01.640
It's really something and I think people have kind of passed over this because of the Facebook

42:01.640 --> 42:06.320
thing because I admit that also caused me a lot of delay.

42:06.320 --> 42:11.320
But getting past that because what I decided is like this is something I'm just exploring.

42:11.320 --> 42:14.720
I don't think I'm going to go very deep into this Oculus ecosystem.

42:14.720 --> 42:20.080
I don't expect to be buying like the Oculus 3 and the Oculus 4 maybe but I just don't

42:20.080 --> 42:21.940
think this is going to be it for me.

42:21.940 --> 42:24.200
But I wanted to see if the idea held up.

42:24.200 --> 42:27.040
Well I suppose in part if you know if I had to pay seven hundred dollars I probably still

42:27.040 --> 42:28.940
wouldn't have done it to be to be fair.

42:28.940 --> 42:33.240
But because I could get it a discount and because I don't expect to go all in forever

42:33.240 --> 42:37.320
I'm okay with the compromise of using Facebook for a little bit.

42:37.320 --> 42:41.720
You know like to me it's sort of like the same thing of yeah I'm using Google I use

42:41.720 --> 42:44.320
Apple and I got I got a Microsoft account.

42:44.320 --> 42:50.160
It's just not ideal but it's the compromise I make and ultimately I imagine if Apple does

42:50.160 --> 42:56.400
ship something that seems interesting and competitive probably end up getting it now.

42:56.400 --> 43:00.320
Whereas before I probably would have considered mocking something like a headset that's two

43:00.320 --> 43:01.320
thousand dollars.

43:01.320 --> 43:05.920
Okay well add to cart you know what maybe next week I will tell you about my virtual

43:05.920 --> 43:06.920
workspace.

43:06.920 --> 43:10.160
Oh yeah check out the Immersed app.

43:10.160 --> 43:11.480
Here's a few of them in there.

43:11.480 --> 43:13.920
The games are pretty great.

43:13.920 --> 43:14.920
Enjoy it.

43:14.920 --> 43:16.000
Let me know how it goes.

43:16.000 --> 43:17.000
Let us all know.

43:17.000 --> 43:21.080
And if you got any tips out there if you've got one coder dot show slash contact I tell

43:21.080 --> 43:23.080
you what the kids loved it.

43:23.080 --> 43:24.080
That was a whole fight.

43:24.080 --> 43:25.080
Oh I bet.

43:25.080 --> 43:29.160
Oh my gosh dude every every 10 minutes dad it's my turn dad it's my turn dad can I go

43:29.160 --> 43:33.720
first tomorrow on the V.R. I love it.

43:33.720 --> 43:35.320
Hey our new Coderly is out.

43:50.840 --> 43:53.200
Mr. Dominic is there anywhere you would like to send people this week.

43:53.200 --> 43:55.880
Yeah just at Dumanuco on Twitter and Alice Dot Def.

43:55.880 --> 43:58.760
Yeah the holodeck addiction definitely begins.

43:58.760 --> 44:01.080
I had a hard time putting it down last night.

44:01.080 --> 44:02.320
Call me Reginald Barkley.

44:02.320 --> 44:08.360
Could you make your own like models for for the metaverse thing.

44:08.360 --> 44:11.080
Here's what I think you can do because I've seen this on YouTube and if anybody out there

44:11.080 --> 44:13.600
knows please let me know.

44:13.600 --> 44:18.880
But I think you could use the frickin lidar scanner on your frickin iPhone to totally

44:18.880 --> 44:24.080
capture an area create a 3D model and then somehow get that on the Oculus I've seen it

44:24.080 --> 44:25.080
done on YouTube.

44:25.080 --> 44:26.080
Well that sounds really good.

44:26.080 --> 44:30.160
I realized recently like I'd like to capture the studio you know because I won't always

44:30.160 --> 44:31.160
have the studio.

44:31.160 --> 44:32.160
Yeah.

44:32.160 --> 44:33.160
This has been a big part of my life.

44:33.160 --> 44:37.880
I'd like to actually how rad would it be to be able to walk back in the studio in 20 years.

44:37.880 --> 44:38.880
That would be very cool.

44:38.880 --> 44:39.880
Yeah.

44:39.880 --> 44:44.160
So if anybody knows how to capture that stuff let me know or anything else feedback thoughts

44:44.160 --> 44:49.240
on the show responses to thought provoking emails Coder dot show slash contacts where

44:49.240 --> 44:50.680
you do all that.

44:50.680 --> 44:52.420
You can subscribe to get the show weekly.

44:52.420 --> 44:57.100
We have a subscribe link up there as well as general links on the site for that.

44:57.100 --> 45:01.240
Pretty easy links to some of the things we specifically talked about today like immersed

45:01.240 --> 45:05.160
that app I'm using for my virtual office.

45:05.160 --> 45:10.480
That's all over at Coder dot show slash for 54 it's real simple that way and if you'd

45:10.480 --> 45:14.680
like to support the show that doesn't involve money you could just tell a friend someone

45:14.680 --> 45:19.080
who'd be interested word of mouth is the best form of advertising for podcasts and last

45:19.080 --> 45:23.200
but not least you can always send us a boost with a new podcast app that supports value

45:23.200 --> 45:24.200
for value.

45:24.200 --> 45:25.200
We love those as well.

45:25.200 --> 45:26.640
Thanks so much for joining us.

45:26.640 --> 45:51.240
