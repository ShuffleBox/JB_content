00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,600
This is KOTOR Radio, episode 488 for October 17th, 2022.

2
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:19,960
Hey good buddy, welcome back to Jupiter Broadcasting's weekly talk show, taking a pragmatic look

3
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:24,680
at the art and the business of software development and the world of technology.

4
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:29,520
My name is Chris, and joining us every single week, and I smell a little Linux, it's our

5
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:30,760
host, Mr. Dominic.

6
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:31,760
Hello Mike.

7
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:34,720
You will all be assimilated into TUX.

8
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:36,520
So you're still, are you on the Thaleo still?

9
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:39,200
I'm on the Thaleo right now, yep.

10
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:43,560
You know, I can tell, I can almost tell there's a slight sound, it's not bad, there's just

11
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:45,040
a difference.

12
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:49,280
It's actually a step up in quality, so I like it, but it doesn't make any difference because

13
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:50,880
you record locally also.

14
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:55,280
But I can tell now when you're on the Mac, usually, or when you're on the Linux box just

15
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:57,320
by the sound of the remote connection, how about that?

16
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:58,320
Really?

17
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:03,440
It's a little, just a little slightly different, slightly different, but it's sticking it sounds

18
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:04,440
like.

19
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:05,440
Yeah, it's sticking.

20
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:09,760
You know, you never know, Apple could release a shiny tablet, you know how I am, but it's

21
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:13,480
been Thaleo and Dev1 exclusively for a while.

22
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:17,680
I am packing up my Thaleo and sending it back because I just have the review unit.

23
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:20,000
It's a little sad, it's a little sad.

24
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:26,320
I think if I were to build my perfect Thaleo, I talked about this on Love this week, I think

25
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:30,360
I might actually, although I love the Ryzen system, I might actually go for an all Intel

26
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:40,040
box, Intel 12th Gen i7 and these new Intel Arc GPUs that are actual hardware dedicated

27
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:42,200
GPUs that you plug into a PCI slot.

28
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:44,680
Have you seen these?

29
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:50,880
They basically iterated on their integrated GPU, they've made it way more powerful, it's

30
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:55,320
the same open source graphic stack, it's based on the same open source code, so it's fully,

31
00:01:55,320 --> 00:02:00,640
if you have Linux 6.0 and the latest Mesa, you just plug this thing in, you've got 100%

32
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:05,960
Linux compatibility, you don't have to do anything else other than just plug it in.

33
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:06,960
And it's gameable.

34
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:11,720
I don't know if I'd compare it to a high end Nvidia or Ryzen, or I mean AMD, but it is

35
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:12,720
gameable.

36
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:14,280
It's a new era.

37
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:21,280
And like the mid-level one, it's like $280, it's not bad when, you know, the new Nvidia

38
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:24,440
stuff is $600 up, so I'm excited about that.

39
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:28,200
I think they're gonna make for some really great workstations, because you gotta give

40
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:30,200
it this, that Intel stuff is rock solid.

41
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:34,640
An all Intel system, you know, maybe it's not the absolute edge cutting performance

42
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:39,000
thing, but you know, the 12th Gen's are pretty good, and you just get, with Linux, you just

43
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,200
get absolute rock solid stability.

44
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:48,320
You combine that stack with something like ECC RAM, oh baby, oh, Crash would be a thing

45
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:50,840
of the past, no doubt about it, no doubt about it.

46
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:54,120
So yeah, it's a little sad to send it back, but I'm gonna box it up and then I'm gonna

47
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:55,120
think on it.

48
00:02:55,120 --> 00:03:01,160
I may end up replacing my OBS machine with an all Intel Thalio, that may be my route

49
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:02,160
I go.

50
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:06,600
You're all Intel, I'm all AMD, it's like a civil war.

51
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:09,520
So would that make, yeah, I guess that would be I'm team blue, you're team red, something

52
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:10,520
like that.

53
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:11,520
I don't know.

54
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:12,520
Привет, comrades.

55
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:19,560
All right, so Sean asked for our thoughts on something going up in Canada right now.

56
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:24,760
And the term software engineer is under attack, an Alberta regulator says.

57
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:26,100
Calm down, Jordan Peterson.

58
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:27,100
You can't do this every time.

59
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:30,040
I know, it's gotta be, it must have been Peterson.

60
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:34,880
An Alberta regulator says, no, you can't just go around, slap an engineer at the end of

61
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:37,600
a developer's title and make them an engineer.

62
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:44,160
In order to be a, quote, software engineer, they must hold a permit and they must pay

63
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:47,080
fees for that right.

64
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:51,080
This is coming, I think this was started by the Association of Professional Engineers

65
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:55,580
and Geoscientists of Alberta, APEGA for short.

66
00:03:55,580 --> 00:04:00,760
They asked the court to order one of the province's leading software companies known as Jobber

67
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:05,720
to stop using the term engineer in job titles and postings unless they get a permit from

68
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:06,900
the regulator.

69
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:12,960
And over in Quebec, they've successfully sued Microsoft in the early aughts to stop

70
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:17,480
them from calling their graduates of the Microsoft Certified Systems Engineers, engineers.

71
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:19,560
They can't use it.

72
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:23,680
And they gave them a thousand dollar fine, maybe, I don't know if it was per person or

73
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,360
in total, pretty minor fee.

74
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:31,680
But they cannot use the term software engineer without actually being an engineer and then

75
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:35,380
getting licensed and paying a fee.

76
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:39,600
And this is, I guess, happening in Alberta and over in Quebec.

77
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:43,160
And I think there is some truth to this.

78
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:44,960
I mean, I hate to be this guy, but...

79
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,360
Okay, be this guy.

80
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:51,680
I have participated in the watering down of the term engineer.

81
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:55,880
You know, I think we had people when I was at Linux Academy on my department's team that

82
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:56,880
were like...

83
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:57,880
Audio engineer?

84
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:58,880
Yeah, I knew you were going to go there.

85
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:04,020
Audio engineer, podcast content engineer, you know, that kind of stuff.

86
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:08,040
And I've also seen it really abused, like, you know, somebody goes and takes a couple

87
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:12,720
of basic Microsoft certifications and I don't mean to demean it because they're part of

88
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:13,720
building a career.

89
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:17,720
But, you know, Microsoft starts throwing around the term engineer pretty much out of the gate

90
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:22,340
if you learn how to manage a Windows box and now you're an engineer and you're certified

91
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:24,520
by Microsoft as such.

92
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:30,480
So I think it has been watered down, I think in part, maybe to help with wages, you know,

93
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:34,920
to help justify high tech wages and things like that.

94
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:38,720
But I'm curious, do you consider developers engineers and should we be able to use this

95
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:42,820
term without big Govy coming down and demanding fines?

96
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:47,560
So I went back when I saw you put this in the show notes.

97
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:51,480
We have literally covered, not this exact case, because, of course, the Tim Hortons

98
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:56,760
shrinkers decided to, I guess, they don't have a First Amendment per se, right?

99
00:05:56,760 --> 00:06:01,200
So if you really want to hear all about this, listen to old Jordan Peterson, but I would

100
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:05,480
caution you on the newer stuff, something weird happened to him.

101
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:06,760
You know, he spent some time in Russia.

102
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:07,760
Yeah.

103
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:08,760
Yeah.

104
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:09,760
I don't know what happened.

105
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:10,760
He came back a little different.

106
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:11,760
A little bit.

107
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:17,440
I mean, I know some would argue he was always like that, but yeah.

108
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:20,560
We've actually covered this topic several times because there was a bunch of prominent.

109
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:21,560
Really?

110
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:22,560
Yeah.

111
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:23,560
Am I that old?

112
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:24,560
Wow.

113
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:29,560
Not this exact case, but there is a very prominent, particularly in the kind of older engineering

114
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:34,120
developer, I should say, community, that was suggesting that there should be some kind

115
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:35,120
of exam.

116
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:39,560
Way, way, way, are you ready for this?

117
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:43,400
2013, we were talking about this.

118
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:48,480
And one of the very prominent.NET developers in that community was hinting that there should

119
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:53,560
be, you know, this is a person who's big into, like, agile certifications and stuff like

120
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:54,560
that.

121
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:55,560
Okay.

122
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:57,540
And you and I both took a giant dump on it.

123
00:06:57,540 --> 00:07:00,720
You know, maybe I've changed my mind over the years then.

124
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:03,920
I'm going to say, I think we've both kind of changed our mind because I think there's

125
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:06,280
the big difference is age.

126
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:08,640
I think this is one of those things.

127
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:09,760
You know what?

128
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:14,100
Let's talk about a prominent software engineer, Tucker Carlson, for a moment.

129
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:17,760
Everyone is familiar with his software engineering prowess.

130
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:23,140
But I was reminded, thanks, weirdly enough too, as of Reclined's podcast, that early

131
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:28,080
Tucker Carlson was a hilarious liberal, not liberal, Libertarian party boy.

132
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,080
Okay.

133
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:30,080
Okay.

134
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:32,040
I kind of remember him on that Crossfire show with his little bow tie.

135
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:33,040
Yeah.

136
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:37,120
Well, even before that, he was on MSNBC and he was like, I want to have like three girls.

137
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:41,120
He's like, let's drinks and girls, baby, all day long.

138
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:43,920
And now he's like, you know, the family, blah, blah, blah.

139
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:47,440
I don't like you, whatever, conservative stuff.

140
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:48,440
It's just age.

141
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:49,440
Right?

142
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:52,960
You and I were like, we were pretty hardcore on, I mean, Alex, I'm sure we'll find it.

143
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:58,480
We were pretty hardcore against this idea to like, I think some of that on my part was

144
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:00,960
straight up fear, right?

145
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:05,400
Like that I could just simply be disqualified out of my own business if they passed a law

146
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:07,320
that said you had to have the credentials.

147
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,320
Sure.

148
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:09,320
Yeah.

149
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:12,160
I'm going to have an actual nuanced take for once.

150
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:14,640
So part of this is just like Canada is not America, right?

151
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:18,480
In America, this lawsuit could never really happen because first amendment, you can say

152
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:22,040
whatever the hell you want, unless you say it on Twitter and then they will shut down

153
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:23,040
your business.

154
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,420
But that's not the government.

155
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:27,000
That's just yay.

156
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:31,800
I don't think this matters as much as people want it to matter.

157
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:40,360
I understand why to a certain mindset saying you're an engineer might sound better.

158
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:49,160
I would even avoid the title altogether because if you look at the salary wages right now,

159
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:54,800
people are hiring developers, engineers, coders, code monkeys, JavaScript ninjas, if you're

160
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:59,080
doing node apparently, and they're paying, right?

161
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,800
There are also tons of layoffs happening.

162
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:08,800
So we're in this weird transition state, but this is a fight that I understand why if you're

163
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:14,440
maybe super early or just like getting to that intermediate stage and things that you

164
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:21,960
feel a visceral like, well, don't screw me over reaction to, but it really doesn't matter.

165
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:26,720
Your salary is not going to be different if you're working at Dark Matter Dev Inc. and

166
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:32,000
your software engineer level two, or your software developer level two, or your code

167
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,600
monkey Jabberwocky level two, they're going to pay you the same because they have to compete

168
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:36,600
with everybody else.

169
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:40,760
Now, this might matter for things like Microsoft certification, right?

170
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:44,560
What is it, MCSE, Microsoft Certified Software Engineer, isn't that?

171
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:46,360
Yeah, there's a few of them, but that's one of them.

172
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:47,360
Yeah.

173
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:49,760
That might be problematic in good old Canada.

174
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:50,760
I don't know.

175
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:51,760
I'm not Canadian.

176
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:52,800
I don't know how the law works.

177
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:56,520
I'm not a lawyer nor Canadian nor am I a Canadian lawyer.

178
00:09:56,520 --> 00:10:00,600
I have a friend who's a traffic engineer and she's always like dunking on me that coders

179
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:05,240
aren't engineers, sure, but it's getting close, right?

180
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:09,520
I think the question you really want to ask is should they be, right?

181
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:15,760
Should there be some type of software development that you actually have to acquire and maintain

182
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:18,560
a engineering license for?

183
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:22,000
And if so, what is that process like?

184
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:28,920
Is it like a CPA license or like an engineering license, right?

185
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:31,880
You have to take ongoing classes every couple of years.

186
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:34,440
You have to, you know, requalify.

187
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:40,840
I don't know, that gets real messy and real tough because we're not, you know, just think

188
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:45,720
of like the 20 JavaScript frameworks that have been released since we started the show

189
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:47,640
15 minutes ago.

190
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:51,160
How the hell do you properly license people?

191
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:52,160
Or is it more abstract?

192
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:57,920
Okay, well then we go the thing that I hate, the low-level algorithms and design patterns

193
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:04,240
trivia test where it's, all right, man, we have this set of data and I want you to, here's

194
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:09,280
10 sorting algorithms, pick the fastest one, okay.

195
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:13,100
It's still stupid, still impractical because it usually doesn't matter.

196
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:16,400
When I say usually one out of like 10 million times.

197
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:22,320
And we're already, I think, this is one case where shocking, Mike thinks the free market

198
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,320
works, right?

199
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:28,040
I think the market has worked in that, you know, Google needs those dudes and the way

200
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:33,580
Google does it is they make their interview process an incredibly arduous, painful, somewhat

201
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:36,680
maybe overboard experience.

202
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:39,360
I think you could argue too, they're paying an engineer's salary over there.

203
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:43,040
And they're paying it, right, and they're paying, well, it's, although not all engineers

204
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:44,360
make that much money, right?

205
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:48,960
So it's, I think the money argument's a little weaker, but we're already doing it.

206
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:55,560
But you know, your bank, or bank's probably a bad example, but your Dunder Mifflin up

207
00:11:55,560 --> 00:12:00,920
in Scranton who just needs another Java developer to keep their damn HR system running kind

208
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:04,760
of doesn't care if you use the less efficient sort algorithm.

209
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:08,280
You know, I agree with everything you're saying in principle.

210
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:14,080
I think where I get hung up is human behavior shows us that we do place value on certain

211
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:18,840
terms and the word engineer has just kind of become one of those respected terms, kind

212
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:20,320
of like a doctor.

213
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:26,600
So it makes sense that we would have kind of co-opted its use to bring some of that

214
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:31,880
official shininess over to this new field to legitimize it a little bit.

215
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:37,200
And I think in doing so, we got away with applying engineer to one thing, and then we

216
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,920
tried applying it to another type of work, and then another, and now it's just sort of

217
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:43,960
anyone's an engineer, you just actually literally just put engineer in the job title, and that's

218
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:44,960
just human behavior.

219
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:50,440
Do you think it was intentional, or was it because in the 50s and 60s, like the original,

220
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:55,360
you know, software developers, engineers, whatever, maybe more so the early 70s, it

221
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:57,920
was a lot more related to actual engineering, right?

222
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:02,720
So like you were working on these circuits, you were, you know, I think, I mean, it's

223
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:05,080
just it's JavaScript's fault.

224
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:09,600
Yeah, well, there's that maybe a little bit of real basic and visual basic in there as

225
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:10,600
well.

226
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:11,600
Right.

227
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:16,620
The problem is the craft or art or I firmly I mean, this is an argument against calling

228
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:17,620
it engineering.

229
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:19,840
It is in no way a science.

230
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:20,840
Like I did.

231
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:21,840
It's just not a science.

232
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:24,200
I know people get pissy when I say that.

233
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:27,840
The reason you know, it's not a science is because there are many different ways to do

234
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:29,320
the same thing.

235
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:35,760
And most importantly, you improve over time and practice, which makes it an art.

236
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:36,760
That's how that works.

237
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:37,760
Right?

238
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:42,500
If this the very, you know, Renaissance way to think about it, but that's generally where

239
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:44,120
you go.

240
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:47,600
So I don't know, is the term developer or less offensive to you?

241
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,640
Well, it clearly hasn't been enough.

242
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:53,920
You know, they've clearly felt the market I'm speaking that they broadly just have felt

243
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:57,480
like because otherwise we would just work on software developer instead of software

244
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:58,480
engineer.

245
00:13:58,480 --> 00:13:59,480
All right.

246
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:00,480
I'm going to fry some Klingon bacon here.

247
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:01,480
Oh, all right.

248
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:02,480
Oh, geez.

249
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:04,640
You know, the Targs have particularly tough bacon.

250
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:07,160
Yeah, we're really going to get that oil hot.

251
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:08,920
You know why it's called why it's called engineering?

252
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:12,200
I'm just going to go with this because we're all nerds.

253
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:15,880
And when it started, a bunch of Star Trek nerds were like, which which section of the

254
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:16,880
enterprise would we be?

255
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:17,880
Engineering, of course.

256
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:18,880
I'd be Scotty.

257
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:19,880
Scotty.

258
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:20,880
Right.

259
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:21,880
Yeah.

260
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:22,880
Yeah.

261
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:23,880
I guess that could be it.

262
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:30,800
I mean, I don't think there's a center circle ball of white coated nineteen sixties eyes.

263
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:31,800
We're like, right.

264
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:36,320
Hey, we'll make four hundred dollars more a year if we say we're engineers and maybe

265
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:42,920
what we're seeing up there in Quebec and in Alberta is a swing back to kind of reclaiming

266
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:45,220
the sanctity of the engineer term.

267
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:48,360
Every actual licensed engineer I know hates, hates this.

268
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:49,360
Right.

269
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:52,760
And could you imagine, though, if we did bring some sort of licensing to software engineering,

270
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:56,040
it just seems like it would stifle innovation like I wonder it would be great for me.

271
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:59,560
How does something like rust come along in this license world?

272
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:01,600
Is rust recognized by a board?

273
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:02,600
And then you can be.

274
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:08,800
You and I both know someone who would gleefully go on Twitter and say that if you are not

275
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:12,960
a licensed rust engineer, then you are not a real developer.

276
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:13,960
We know this dude.

277
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:14,960
It's not me.

278
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:15,960
Yeah.

279
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:24,720
Linode dot com slash coder Linode makes the cloud simple, affordable and accessible to

280
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,200
anyone at any skill level.

281
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:31,120
And when you go to Linode dot com slash coder, you'll get one hundred dollars in 60 day credit

282
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:36,860
to try it out, to really get a feel for what Linode is like fast, reliable.

283
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:41,680
Those are words that come to my mind and honestly, a great deal, 30 to 50 percent less than the

284
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:43,640
hypervisors out there.

285
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:49,720
Linode's app marketplace makes it super easy to deploy a lot of popular open source software

286
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:52,160
and the next cloud deployment has been taken to the next level.

287
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:56,360
In fact, Linode seems to be working directly with the next cloud project and they just

288
00:15:56,360 --> 00:16:02,680
published a really great interview and background on Frank, the founder of next cloud and next

289
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:06,560
cloud, the company and kind of how they're organized as a group.

290
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:07,680
That's not a super long read either.

291
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:09,160
So I'll link to this in the show notes.

292
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:13,880
If you're not familiar, next cloud provides like a open source productivity suite now

293
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:17,600
closer to Office 365 with their hub three that they just announced, which will be released

294
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,080
soon.

295
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:25,240
You basically have an alternative to the Google workplace product, Office 365, Slack, all

296
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:31,440
of that in one self hostable package that you can deploy with just a couple of clicks

297
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:32,800
on Linode.

298
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:38,020
Same with GitLab and other just absolutely essential tools, including some cloud IDEs.

299
00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:42,360
Or if you prefer, which is honestly the route I often take if time allows, you can build

300
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:46,320
it up from the ground on Linode and today they have 11 data centers and throughout next

301
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:49,440
year they're going to fire up a dozen more.

302
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:52,000
They are their own ISP, so their connections are super fast.

303
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,500
They've got dedicated CPU rigs with AMD epic CPUs.

304
00:16:55,500 --> 00:17:01,640
They've got dedicated GPU rigs with the super high end Nvidia data center GPUs in there

305
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:07,040
and they've got systems that will just be what you need to run a blog, maybe something

306
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:10,580
simple for yourself, like a gallery site, or maybe your own Nextcloud instance just

307
00:17:10,580 --> 00:17:11,580
for a couple of people.

308
00:17:11,580 --> 00:17:13,360
Like the whole range is there.

309
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:18,600
Our matrix server for Jupiter broadcasting is a 48 core Linode.

310
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:19,600
It's a monster.

311
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:21,120
It won't always be that way.

312
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:27,960
In fact, we started, I think like maybe a four core and we scaled up as demand needed

313
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:31,740
the same rig, the same install all the way up to 48 cores.

314
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:34,840
I think it's like 128 gigs of RAM.

315
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:39,720
It's something just astronomical mind blowing and for somebody who was super happy when

316
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:44,440
his computer had two megs of RAM and that was after I put an upgrade stick in and we're

317
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:48,500
just scale it back down once we've reconfigured it with more workers and whatnot.

318
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:53,520
It's so powerful what you can do with Linode, the tooling, the backups, the snapshots.

319
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:57,500
It's truly one of our secret weapons here at JB that lets us have the reach and the

320
00:17:57,500 --> 00:18:03,440
infrastructure of the billion dollar companies when we're just a small little bespoke podcast

321
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:04,440
shop.

322
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:05,440
So go try it for yourself.

323
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:13,000
Go try it for your business and go get that $100 linode.com slash coder.

324
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:17,880
So the internet's pretty upset this week because it seems with a little bit of tweaking, you

325
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:25,560
can quote block public code that copilot emits and what you end up with, surprise, surprise,

326
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:29,400
seems to be quite a bit of copy written code when you change that setting.

327
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:34,360
And this was noticed over, I don't know, was it the weekend by Tim Davis on Twitter and

328
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:40,040
he writes, with at GitHub copilot and the public code block setting, it now emits large

329
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:44,580
chunks of my copy written code with no attribution and no LGPL license.

330
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:50,060
For example, and he shows a simple prompt with a sparse matrix transpose CS, it produces

331
00:18:50,060 --> 00:18:57,800
his exact code and he has his original code in the screenshot up and then he pulls up

332
00:18:57,800 --> 00:19:04,560
the copilot produced code and it's line for line identical and it seems clearly like it's

333
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:07,720
just reproducing his code without his permission.

334
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:14,080
And this has provoked the conversation that copilot, much to I think your concern, it's

335
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:15,080
actually happening.

336
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:21,840
It is enabling copyright laundering, code laundering essentially, and you can just use

337
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:25,640
somebody's copy written code and then when somebody comes after you, you can just put

338
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:33,640
your hands up and say, I didn't, a copilot gen, I didn't, I had no idea.

339
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:34,640
People are getting pissed.

340
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:37,540
Yeah, so we should define our terms real fast though, right?

341
00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:44,640
So apparently public code in code pilot parlance means permissive licenses, I think that's

342
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:45,640
what it sounds like.

343
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:46,640
All right.

344
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:52,360
And when they say, when you say copy written code, we are not talking private repos here.

345
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:57,600
We are talking code that is in fact public, is in fact open source, but is under a more

346
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,400
aggressive license you could say, right?

347
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:01,940
Like a GPL, LGPL, whatever.

348
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:07,720
Before I get into some concerns on this, I have some really bad news for you guys.

349
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:08,720
Uh oh.

350
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:10,920
People are doing this all the time.

351
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:14,960
People who even like engineering developers, code monkeys, whatever we're calling them

352
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:20,280
now who don't involve themselves in the Linux community.

353
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:24,080
I know for a fact, routinely just steal GPL code.

354
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:25,080
Oh, oh sure.

355
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:27,520
Yeah, I, I, I, I, yeah, yeah, yeah, right.

356
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:29,240
So this isn't like a big change.

357
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:34,880
In fact, I would say, you know, your dumb sort algorithm when I, this Tim Davis guy

358
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:39,080
is actually an academic, so his stuff is real, but like you're, you're dumb, like, you know,

359
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:41,240
iterating through some dictionary.

360
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:47,560
If somebody happens to copy that via code pilot unwittingly, eh, come on buddy.

361
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:49,880
You didn't, you know, come on.

362
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:54,440
The other thing is I'm going to push back a little, even though I'm what was one of

363
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:57,280
the earlier persons concerned about this.

364
00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:03,440
If you put a prompt that looks, first of all, the prompt thing in code pilot is super, super

365
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:04,440
problematic.

366
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:05,440
I agree with that.

367
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:07,960
You shouldn't be able to ask the code genie to generate you code.

368
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:11,440
It should just do it intuitively for lots of reasons.

369
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:16,320
One, if you do it intuitively, it looks at your own code first locally, which code cohesion

370
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:18,720
is the thing you want that it's good for you.

371
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,760
It's good for your organization.

372
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:22,760
End of rant.

373
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:29,440
But if you, you know, string together a prompt intentionally trying to get your code back

374
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:35,320
and succeed, that's a little, that's a little sus as the kids would say, right?

375
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:37,040
That's a little, I mean, fair point.

376
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:41,820
You've made your point, but you've made your point, you know, in the way that lots of lawyers

377
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:43,960
make their point that if the glove fits, you must acquit.

378
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:47,500
And if Wookiees live on indoor, like it's a totally contrived argument.

379
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:52,620
What about Jeremy Saller's argument that you could basically use this for illegal source

380
00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:53,620
code laundering?

381
00:21:53,620 --> 00:21:56,960
That's just automated by GitHub is that you could just literally find any piece of code

382
00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:01,480
you want under an incompatible license, and then you just keep probing copilot until it

383
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:02,480
reproduces it.

384
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:05,520
And then you have plausible denied ability later.

385
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:07,880
Now this is a way to kind of copy that GPL code.

386
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:11,920
Like you were saying, people do already and put it in there like, you know, close source

387
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:15,300
company app or whatever operating system.

388
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:20,000
But now you can do that with this tool and also have legal deniability.

389
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,480
So it's like, it just makes it even easier to get away with it now.

390
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:24,480
Okay.

391
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:30,540
So what I would say generally is that there's a lot of overheated takes on this.

392
00:22:30,540 --> 00:22:37,660
And I think that's a little silly calling it code laundering is, uh, one of the things,

393
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:41,280
so this is a little dangerous territory that I think pushes people away from the FOSS community

394
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:44,580
is the more militant aspects of it.

395
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:49,800
People aren't just running around looking to rip off, rip off your open source project.

396
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:55,800
They're doing it by accident because either they don't know, or in, I guess, very, very

397
00:22:55,800 --> 00:23:01,040
few cases, it's a business decision made by some startup who I hate to break it to you.

398
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:05,000
But when you sue them, they're probably by the time the lawsuit hits a judge, they'll

399
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:09,960
probably be bankrupt for other reasons, right?

400
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:14,640
So this is like the biggest tempest in the littlest teapot.

401
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:17,920
And I know there's going to be a visceral reaction to that because I understand the

402
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:23,320
people who've truly philosophically believe in FOSS for its own sake.

403
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:28,560
This is like, you know, the Virgin Mary being the centerfold and playboy, but not only does

404
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:33,800
this not matter, to be honest, reading some of these takes put me off.

405
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:37,600
It's one of those things that every time I come into this community, I kind of get like,

406
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:42,280
all right, you guys need to like have a shot of reality.

407
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:45,640
Most code that I've seen code generate is actually bad.

408
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:49,040
I'm just saying like, it's not good.

409
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:54,320
So if some super, you know, I'll get accused of gatekeeping here, but super like newbie

410
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:59,460
person who just came out of a boot camp wants to rip off some code I have in a public repo

411
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:08,040
or a gist and just like try to shoehorn it into their project, what would you like me

412
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:09,040
to do?

413
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:10,040
Should I sue them?

414
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:12,640
Should I sue GitHub?

415
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:16,800
I mean, I'm pretty sure GitHub has in that EULA that you indemnify them.

416
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:20,040
So here's something I've noticed recently.

417
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:24,520
And all of this is prefaced with I think Twitter is pretty much a dumpster fire.

418
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:29,040
And in all of these cases, if people just stayed the fuck off Twitter, they would have

419
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:34,300
a lot easier simpler life and a lot less stress and things would be a lot smoother professionally.

420
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:38,320
And you know, an example of this is Hector Martin, who I have a lot of respect for because

421
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:45,060
Hector has led the charge on porting Linux over to Apple's M1 hardware and the Asahi

422
00:24:45,060 --> 00:24:47,760
Linux project has incredible success.

423
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:51,120
But Hector is also involved in this culture of like, got to have a hot take.

424
00:24:51,120 --> 00:25:00,320
And it seems GitHub has entered this size and territory now where every single action

425
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:01,320
GitHub takes.

426
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:02,320
Pun.

427
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:03,320
Wow.

428
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:04,320
TM.

429
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:05,320
Action TM.

430
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:06,320
Yeah.

431
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:07,320
Yeah.

432
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:10,960
There is both a massively positive reaction and a massively negative reaction.

433
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:15,880
And GitHub is so large that when they do something, anything, they end up touching things with

434
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:17,820
negative consequences.

435
00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:23,500
And so on October 14, GitHub tweets, this handy action flag issues and PRs that go untouched

436
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:25,080
for a certain amount of time.

437
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:28,920
Try it with your repo today and start closing out those old stale issues.

438
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:32,560
And it's an action that, you know, you could set an X amount of time and it will go through

439
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:35,600
and close certain issues and PRs that have been untouched.

440
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:37,400
So it's an issue of janitor effectively.

441
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:38,400
Yeah.

442
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:42,180
Hector Martin quote retweets that don't do this ever.

443
00:25:42,180 --> 00:25:45,320
This is insulting and disrespectful to your users.

444
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:51,520
Everybody is entitled support from volunteers and FOSS projects and they absolutely do deserve

445
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:55,600
not to have the issues they took time to file actively thrown away.

446
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:58,440
If you haven't fixed this bug, it stays open.

447
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:04,280
This then kicks off a conversation that between Hector and other people that essentially devolves

448
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:10,800
into if you use this action, you hate free software and you hate free software users.

449
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:16,420
And it goes from like, you know, like here's the thing, here's a perfectly reasonable way

450
00:26:16,420 --> 00:26:17,420
to tweet this.

451
00:26:17,420 --> 00:26:23,420
You could tweet, hey guys, here's a suggestion, you know, quote retweet and say, in my experience,

452
00:26:23,420 --> 00:26:25,560
this actually can discourage future contributions.

453
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:28,760
You might want to consider not using this.

454
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:32,280
But the reality is every project is unique.

455
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:35,400
Everybody has different use cases because you could argue that also in a free software

456
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:39,720
project, people open up a lot of bogus PRs and a lot of bogus issues that the project's

457
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:43,640
never going to touch and they pile up and they pile up and they become overwhelming

458
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:47,880
and demotivating to the developers because they have hundreds of open issues that they're

459
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:49,860
never going to touch, but they don't know what to do.

460
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:54,000
Like we have a small GitHub for Jupiter broadcasting and that's already come up a couple of times

461
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,680
as like, well, what do you do with these issues that don't really fit here?

462
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:57,680
They're not really a problem.

463
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:58,680
They're more of somebody's opinion.

464
00:26:58,680 --> 00:26:59,680
Like, what do you do?

465
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:00,840
Do you just close it?

466
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:03,400
Do you say thanks for your contribution, then close it?

467
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:05,520
Do you just let something come along and clean it up?

468
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:07,320
Like there really is never a right answer.

469
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:11,500
And so when you go in so hard and so hot on these takes, I can't help but lose respect

470
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:15,800
for somebody a little bit because it's just, you boil it down to this sort of like, don't

471
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:18,300
do this ever.

472
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:19,300
And it's like, well, wait a minute.

473
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:21,920
Now that's just never the right recommendation.

474
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:26,000
It's funny because, you know, we follow many of the same people on Twitter.

475
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:32,000
I also follow this very large, I would say larger than the kind of more experienced FOSS

476
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:37,680
developers we're talking about, community of, love you guys, but super newbie developers

477
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:40,280
that have just come out of bootcamp.

478
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:41,280
And they love co-pilot.

479
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:42,280
Do you know why?

480
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:46,160
Because they literally don't know how to do that iterate through the dictionary thing

481
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:49,000
I was joking about, right?

482
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:54,840
And I don't know, we always talk about accessibility and not, you know, quote unquote, gatekeeping,

483
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:57,400
which is a term I fricking hate.

484
00:27:57,400 --> 00:28:03,200
What is that, so as soon as you slap like a license on it, I also don't think you should

485
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:06,560
wantonly violate open source licenses.

486
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:11,780
I don't, but the idea that this wasn't going on before co-pilot and the idea that the answer

487
00:28:11,780 --> 00:28:19,960
is to codify some militant force of angry senior developers who are going to scold you

488
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:25,000
like you're in a British boarding school seems stupid to be honest.

489
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:29,520
It seems really dumb because you know what the biggest threat to open source projects

490
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:31,560
is on average?

491
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:35,920
Not being, bringing enough people in to maintain them over the long haul.

492
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:38,540
Not a problem if you're the Linux kernel, sure, because everybody, you know, that's

493
00:28:38,540 --> 00:28:41,680
prestige and you have big money behind you.

494
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:47,660
But I'm not sure that our response, and I truly believe that code pilot is being used

495
00:28:47,660 --> 00:28:53,340
by a lot of these junior just out of bootcamp devs as a crutch and maybe that's not good

496
00:28:53,340 --> 00:28:54,440
for their learning.

497
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:55,440
Maybe it is.

498
00:28:55,440 --> 00:29:00,560
I think we're going to need a couple of years to figure that out, but regardless of whatever

499
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:07,800
mistakes they may make, I don't think having, you know, an openly hostile kind of honestly

500
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:12,160
condescending DBAG reaction is the way to go.

501
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:17,080
I feel bad because I like some of these people, and I used to do a lot of this angry crap

502
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:24,920
on Twitter and it never gets you the result you want, I would say.

503
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:28,160
Go there to get a free personal account for up to 20 devices and it's a great way to support

504
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:29,160
the show.

505
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:31,080
Tailscale is a zero config VPN.

506
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:32,720
It'll get on any device in like minutes.

507
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:33,720
It's impressive.

508
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:37,040
It'll manage your firewall rules and it works from anywhere.

509
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:40,400
Devices connect directly to each other using WireGuard's noise protocol.

510
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:46,720
So it builds you a flat mesh network with the absolute best VPN in the business.

511
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:50,520
And you can quickly and easily create a secure network between your machines.

512
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:59,360
I'm talking servers, VMs, iPad, Android phone, Raspberry Pi cluster, a single Raspberry Pi,

513
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:00,360
you name it.

514
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:02,120
And Tailscale will manage the firewall.

515
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:06,900
It'll take care of the NAT if you have it or even carrier grade double NAT, it even

516
00:30:06,900 --> 00:30:09,040
manages to work with that.

517
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:12,800
And Tailscale will support DNS in that flat network and they just announced a partnership

518
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:14,840
with NextDNS.

519
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:18,640
So now you can put a DNS resolver using NextDNS in there or you could use something like Pi

520
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:20,720
Hole or just straight up bind.

521
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:25,240
It'll let you choose exactly how you want to manage it and then you can do name resolution

522
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:27,200
for all your machines in the Tailscale network.

523
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:30,960
And there's Tailscale Send which is like Airdrop but for all of your machines that have Tailscale

524
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:34,240
including your Linux boxes of course.

525
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:37,320
There's things like Tailscale SSH that helps you manage your SSH keys.

526
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:39,600
You log in with your Tailscale credentials.

527
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:44,160
It's powerful stuff and it's surprisingly simple to get going.

528
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:49,400
And you can use it for free up to 20 devices when you go to tailscale.com slash coder.

529
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:54,000
This is truly one of those tools that I advocate in my personal life to my friends and my family.

530
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:57,640
Literally this weekend, I was getting my dad set up with Tailscale.

531
00:30:57,640 --> 00:30:58,640
I'm surprised I hadn't done it earlier.

532
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:00,880
I just hadn't had a chance to see him.

533
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:02,240
Now he's got it set up though.

534
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:03,240
Go try it out.

535
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:04,240
See why I love it.

536
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:11,280
See why everybody around us, everyone at JB uses it, tailscale.com slash coder.

537
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:17,360
So the Wall Street Journal and Business Insider have been hitting Meta week after week on

538
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:19,160
a scheduled attack.

539
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:23,480
And I've grabbed a couple of pieces because they're just eviscerating.

540
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:29,080
The first one that I noticed Meta sunk 15 billion dollars building the Metaverse.

541
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:30,680
Where did the money go?

542
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:35,320
They say that precise details of where the money has gone remain fuzzy.

543
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:40,120
Some experts express disappointment that Meta and the updates that Meta announced last week

544
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:45,740
with their Meta keynote, which I watched parts of.

545
00:31:45,740 --> 00:31:53,440
The biggest thing they announced was legs for avatars and the new Quest hardware.

546
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:58,280
Which is not even, I don't even have a tinge of desire to buy.

547
00:31:58,280 --> 00:32:00,040
And we're still using the Quest one.

548
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:01,040
We just used it this weekend.

549
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:02,280
We really enjoyed it.

550
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:06,080
But I don't even have the slightest tinge to buy the $1200 Quest hardware.

551
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:09,560
So they are kind of a disappointment in that regard.

552
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:15,560
And then next, this one is super damning, I think.

553
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:19,680
Most Metaverse users don't even last a month.

554
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:24,960
Internal documents show that Meta's Horizon Worlds platform is struggling bad to retain

555
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:25,960
users.

556
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:29,080
This is the kiss of death for these platforms.

557
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:34,560
So if you can get the hardware, you know, like you can maybe pick up a Quest one now

558
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:41,200
for $400, most Metaverse users don't return to the Horizon Worlds platform after the first

559
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:43,200
month of usage.

560
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:44,200
They are losing users.

561
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:48,760
So people buy the hardware, and I have to say, that is absolutely the way it worked

562
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:49,760
for us.

563
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:53,360
The very first thing my kid wanted to do when I gave it to my oldest is he wanted to check

564
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:54,360
out the Metaverse.

565
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:55,840
He checked it out for one night.

566
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:59,120
I don't think they've ever gone back.

567
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:02,920
My middle child said she checked it out for one night, and then she's never gone back.

568
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:07,040
They'll play Beat Saber, you know, they'll do that stuff.

569
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:08,040
Metaverse sucked for them though.

570
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:09,040
What are your thoughts?

571
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:10,040
I don't know.

572
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:11,960
This is exactly what my experience was.

573
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:15,000
I mean, I have the Quest as well.

574
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:19,880
I think I went in the Metaverse for a whopping 10 minutes, then I went back and fought Darth

575
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:20,880
Vader.

576
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:21,880
I apologize.

577
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:25,800
I don't remember the name of the game, but it's, I mean, I'm sure if you have a Quest

578
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:29,440
and you listen to the show, you've probably fought Darth Vader too.

579
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:30,440
That is good times.

580
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:34,600
But then I was like, okay, let me buy this other game.

581
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:35,600
It was garbage.

582
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:40,480
My stepdaughter, honestly, it looked like she was taking some sort of seizure, but she

583
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:45,840
did the Beat Saber game to Lady Gaga quite a bit until she like almost busted her ass.

584
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:49,020
That pretty much put an end to that.

585
00:33:49,020 --> 00:33:56,280
And it is sitting in my closet, I joke you not, laying wrapped in my coderly robe.

586
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:58,200
Something Meta about that actually.

587
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:00,760
Yeah, I don't, I don't know.

588
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:03,880
I know you and I talked a lot about this being for like virtual meetings or virtual events.

589
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:09,040
I don't, I don't know that I could actually tolerate wearing it for more than like 15,

590
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:10,040
20 minutes.

591
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:11,040
Yeah.

592
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:12,040
Yeah.

593
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:13,040
This is definitely not the one, right?

594
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:17,960
You know, when I see people who have stuck with the Quest, like they use it actively,

595
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:19,680
they've replaced the headgear stuff.

596
00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:20,920
They've replaced the straps.

597
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:23,800
They've added a ton of stuff to make it more comfortable.

598
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:30,080
Part of the problem is, is that there is a heavy duty set of lenses and a smartphone

599
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:31,520
on the front of this thing.

600
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:35,780
And so it's pulling down on your face constantly.

601
00:34:35,780 --> 00:34:40,640
And I already am getting what I call a tranche in my hair, which is a real tragedy.

602
00:34:40,640 --> 00:34:42,120
Oh yeah, from headphones.

603
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:43,120
Yep.

604
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:44,620
From the headphones and from my CPAP.

605
00:34:44,620 --> 00:34:48,440
So I wear a strap all night that goes in the same place my headphones do.

606
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:50,120
And then I wear headphones all day.

607
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:53,280
And then when I play them, when I play on the Quest, I'm putting a strap on again.

608
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:55,180
And so I get this tranche.

609
00:34:55,180 --> 00:35:00,160
It's like I'm basically, I have a strip of balding in the center of my head.

610
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:04,360
It's just the hair has parted like the ocean from straps all the time.

611
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:08,440
And so like the last thing I want to do is put another strap on.

612
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:13,280
It's just, it needs to be a lighter device and it needs to be more comfortable than I

613
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:14,280
could see it.

614
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:15,280
I could see it.

615
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:16,460
I still love the idea.

616
00:35:16,460 --> 00:35:20,760
The one thing they touched on more in their more recent keynote, to back up just a moment

617
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:22,400
to kind of set the context.

618
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:25,800
You remember how we talked about recently, the first couple of Apple watches, they really

619
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:29,920
hadn't figured out fitness and then they really honed in on fitness.

620
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:36,560
I feel like maybe they're going that direction with the Quest and home offices and you know,

621
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:40,920
work from anywhere setups where you have an awesome virtual office and because they made

622
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:46,280
a couple of references to how they're putting a lot of work into a new virtual office space

623
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:48,760
where they're creating their own first party app.

624
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:52,920
You have a virtual office, you pull your desktop screens in and you can do conferencing in

625
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:54,080
there as well.

626
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:56,600
They made a reference to down the road.

627
00:35:56,600 --> 00:36:04,400
Their goal would be your entire computer is in that Quest headset and I actually think

628
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:05,400
that could work.

629
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:07,360
So you put, you know, it's powerful enough.

630
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:10,600
I mean, imagine if you had, you know, iPad Pro hardware in there.

631
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:15,440
You put that thing on, it is your entire computer so you don't need to like bring in the screens

632
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:17,040
from your laptop or your desktop.

633
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:18,160
It has all your screens.

634
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:24,760
It has all your apps and you just put it on and you're in your perfect workspace wherever

635
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:29,280
you're at and you and I played with this a little bit and it was early days when we looked

636
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:35,200
at it, but if somebody like Meta or Apple really focused on that idea, I think that

637
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:40,960
could be the killer app like fitness was the killer app for the watch because that with

638
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:45,160
work from home and work from anywhere because work from home is really just work from the

639
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:49,480
internet and so if you could like for me, I could be sitting in my passenger seat of

640
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:50,480
the RV.

641
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:52,760
I put that headset on, boom, I'm in my office.

642
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:53,760
I've got all my screens.

643
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:54,760
I've got all my apps.

644
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:57,160
I've got all my messages in their current state.

645
00:36:57,160 --> 00:37:00,760
That sounds super powerful to me and I can't be the only one that would use the crap out

646
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:01,760
of that.

647
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:03,760
Yeah, I don't know.

648
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:05,800
Yeah, I know.

649
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:07,000
I agree.

650
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:11,320
It seems, it does seem, it seems just as sketch as it did two, three years ago.

651
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:15,480
I feel like for the last three to five years, the industry has been searching for the next

652
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:16,480
new thing, right?

653
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:21,360
The next mobile, the next iPhone, whatever it is, and these are all solutions desperately

654
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:23,320
searching for a problem.

655
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:26,120
Like I work in a home office.

656
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:27,120
It's fine.

657
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:31,720
Yeah, although as homes get smaller and we all get packed into smaller and smaller Japanese

658
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:35,000
style apartments, maybe you don't have room for a computer desk.

659
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:39,240
I honestly think you and I will live to an age where the computer desk is looked at as

660
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:43,160
like those antique TVs that were like an entire credenza.

661
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:47,760
I think that's how we'll view the computer desk and the idea that you had a room that

662
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:52,760
had a desk with screens that you just sat at all day will look archaic and well, no

663
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:54,300
wonder everybody was so overweight.

664
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:57,760
That's I think honestly where hopefully by the time you and I are dying, that's how the

665
00:37:57,760 --> 00:37:59,120
world will look at computer desks.

666
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:01,720
Well, but isn't this what we've been hoping for for a long time, right?

667
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:03,120
The Star Trek tablets.

668
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:07,880
I mean, Microsoft is the closest to what I think is actually going to happen.

669
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:12,640
They're just Microsoft and you know, are cursed to never succeed in the consumer space other

670
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:13,640
than Xbox.

671
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:14,640
Right?

672
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:15,640
Yeah.

673
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:18,160
You know where the HoloLens is alive and well?

674
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:19,160
JPL.

675
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:23,200
When you walk the JPL campus, which I had the opportunity to do recently, they have

676
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:24,200
HoloLens.

677
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:28,880
They're kind of like QR codes, but more complicated throughout the campus.

678
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:33,000
So that way you can sync up your HoloLens to different areas as you're walking the JPL

679
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,000
campus.

680
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,000
Yeah.

681
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:39,280
And I think of just like the surface, the idea that your main device, I mean, most of

682
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:43,160
the time I'm not working at my Thale home, I'm working on the Dev one because you hit

683
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:44,160
the nail on the head.

684
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:50,000
The idea of just sitting at a desk and like in my case, my bedroom, you know, and being

685
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:56,820
totally locked in is not conducive to the new world of work from home when you have

686
00:38:56,820 --> 00:38:58,080
kiddies running around.

687
00:38:58,080 --> 00:39:02,060
Yeah, it's not conducive to flow and it's not good for the body.

688
00:39:02,060 --> 00:39:08,000
And now that I'm getting old, it's like I notice that if I just work a few extra hours

689
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:12,920
a day, so say, so I've been staying at the studio since last Coder because I'm getting

690
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:16,840
some work done on JOOPS and I pick her up after today's episode.

691
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:18,620
Because I'm here, I work longer.

692
00:39:18,620 --> 00:39:24,120
I work basically from like six a.m. to like six thirty seven p.m.

693
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:28,560
And I notice that my RSI is significantly worse just by adding a couple of hours more

694
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:30,880
to my day or just consistently working longer.

695
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:34,200
Like it's not unusual for me to work those hours, but maybe it's unusual for me to work

696
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:36,320
those hours like seven days in a row.

697
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:38,920
And as I do that, I can feel my hands are starting to hurt.

698
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:41,840
It's my my body is just getting old.

699
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:43,800
I got to take more breaks and I got to move about more.

700
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:47,800
And I think part of the way to do that is using different equipment and working in different

701
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:49,420
work positions.

702
00:39:49,420 --> 00:39:52,440
So I got to wrap my head around like, what is the best tool when I want to do this kind

703
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:54,520
of thing and where should I do that from?

704
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:57,040
I think I'm going to spend a little bit of time this winter kind of figuring that stuff

705
00:39:57,040 --> 00:40:03,960
out just to kind of try to habitualize a new routine of working.

706
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:09,040
And what I'm hoping for, although who knows, is sort of like train myself like a dog.

707
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:13,760
Like when I'm in this area and I'm using this equipment, I'm doing this task.

708
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:18,820
And so maybe I get into flow a little bit easier because it's like I'm training my body,

709
00:40:18,820 --> 00:40:25,200
my mind, this place, this equipment, these apps go, you know, I could see it working.

710
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:26,200
I don't know.

711
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:27,200
Why not?

712
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:29,160
If you can work from the Internet, you can work from anywhere.

713
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:31,400
Well, unless you have a data cap.

714
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:32,400
Yeah.

715
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:33,400
Yeah.

716
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:34,400
Oh, man.

717
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:35,400
Let's not forget about Comcast.

718
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:38,360
Or like, you know, technical issues like this last road trip was just horrendous.

719
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:40,880
Or it's, you know, three months out of the year in Florida.

720
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:41,880
Yeah.

721
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:48,960
Ask not what your podcast can boost for you, but what you can boost for your podcast.

722
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:51,000
We got some boosts into the show this week.

723
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,080
Thank you, everybody who boosted in.

724
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:55,600
We do just select some of them to come onto the show, but we read all of them.

725
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:56,760
I appreciate all of them.

726
00:40:56,760 --> 00:41:01,880
And our first one came in from Soham with nineteen eighty four sets.

727
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:02,880
Hmm.

728
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:03,880
Hmm.

729
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:04,880
I see what you did there.

730
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:05,880
Boost.

731
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:12,520
He says every episode you all get so close to realizing capitalism is doomed by definition.

732
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:15,400
Come on over to the red side.

733
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:16,400
Do we?

734
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:17,400
Is that what we do?

735
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:18,740
I don't know if I agree with that.

736
00:41:18,740 --> 00:41:21,520
I feel like we recognize that it's sick.

737
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:22,520
It's it's definitely sick.

738
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:25,960
I don't know what else is doing so well.

739
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:28,880
I like how we have a communist underground that listens to the show.

740
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:29,880
I know.

741
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:30,880
I know.

742
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:31,880
It's really kind of it's very Dostoevsky.

743
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:34,560
It's it's like it's it's kind of perfect, isn't it?

744
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:36,120
We appreciate you, comrades.

745
00:41:36,120 --> 00:41:39,280
Yeah, we can we can reach across to all sides.

746
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:41,960
Works from home boosts in with a thousand sets.

747
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:47,280
B-O-O-S-T. Regarding Chris's uniform, I have two words for you.

748
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:48,280
Shoulder pads.

749
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:51,240
Yes, it's nineteen eighties, nineteen eighty four.

750
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:52,480
It's perfect.

751
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:54,240
You know, they're going to come back, right?

752
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:55,280
You know, they're going to come back.

753
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:57,240
So let's just get ahead of the trend.

754
00:41:57,240 --> 00:42:01,920
So now that now that I am back from the road trip, I have been considering this a lot.

755
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:03,460
I'm giving it some thought.

756
00:42:03,460 --> 00:42:05,480
I've been looking for where I can source stuff.

757
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:08,840
So I am beginning the process of figuring out the uniform.

758
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:09,840
Oh, my God.

759
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:10,840
Yeah, it's happening.

760
00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:11,840
It's it's happening.

761
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:15,960
Optimus Gray boosts in with twenty forty eight sets coming in hot with the boost.

762
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:20,040
I'm boosting Coder because this has to do with Chris's wardrobe and uniform.

763
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:21,040
Jesus Christ.

764
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:22,040
Velcro, guys.

765
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:25,160
OK, let me say Velcro sleeves and upper left chest.

766
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:29,520
I mean, maybe you could wear the same shirt but have Velcro patches for luck.

767
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:30,520
Oh, my God.

768
00:42:30,520 --> 00:42:34,560
For Coder and for self-hosted.

769
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:35,560
That's great.

770
00:42:35,560 --> 00:42:39,120
Said I'd buy a self-hosted Velcro patch all day and then the Bitcoin dad talks.

771
00:42:39,120 --> 00:42:41,080
You can wear a patch for that show.

772
00:42:41,080 --> 00:42:42,360
This is a great idea.

773
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:46,520
It's just one shirt with different Velcro patch patches depending on the show you're

774
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:47,520
doing.

775
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:49,520
That's I mean, that means we have to do it.

776
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:51,240
We'd have to launch a whole patch line investigation.

777
00:42:51,240 --> 00:42:53,240
You know, you'd be like the Thaleo of shirts.

778
00:42:53,240 --> 00:42:57,200
You have all the different face plates.

779
00:42:57,200 --> 00:43:00,720
Also keep keeping in with our 80s theme because now Velcro is back.

780
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:01,720
OK.

781
00:43:01,720 --> 00:43:02,720
Yeah.

782
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:03,720
Right.

783
00:43:03,720 --> 00:43:04,720
Yeah.

784
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:05,720
Right.

785
00:43:05,720 --> 00:43:06,720
I mean, there's something to this here.

786
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:07,720
Shoulder pads and Velcro and patches.

787
00:43:07,720 --> 00:43:14,040
John eight came in with I think our biggest boost of the episode with seven thousand sets.

788
00:43:14,040 --> 00:43:17,040
Seven thousand for the seven percent interest rate.

789
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:18,040
Ouch.

790
00:43:18,040 --> 00:43:19,040
Yeah.

791
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:23,160
And then CPI was up since we got together again.

792
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:24,160
Every seven days.

793
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:25,560
Oh, it's bad.

794
00:43:25,560 --> 00:43:26,760
It is something, man.

795
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:28,840
We are watching some incredible times.

796
00:43:28,840 --> 00:43:33,280
And also, it really shows you just how long all of this stuff takes to work its way through

797
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:34,280
the economy.

798
00:43:34,280 --> 00:43:35,280
Right.

799
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:38,480
Because the Fed has basically been hawkish since November of last year.

800
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:41,860
We're almost a year now in a hawkish action by the Fed.

801
00:43:41,860 --> 00:43:43,440
And inflation is still increasing.

802
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:47,640
Hey, question, if you go to the unemployment line, you say you're an engineer or developer,

803
00:43:47,640 --> 00:43:48,640
which is better?

804
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:50,840
Might be something to think about.

805
00:43:50,840 --> 00:43:51,840
Yeah.

806
00:43:51,840 --> 00:43:52,840
Think about that, everybody.

807
00:43:52,840 --> 00:43:57,560
Bond boosted in with one, two, three, four sets to love the truthful take on crypto.

808
00:43:57,560 --> 00:43:58,780
That's right.

809
00:43:58,780 --> 00:43:59,780
No B.S. here.

810
00:43:59,780 --> 00:44:04,960
By the way, since we've been live, top of Hacker News or at least it was a half hour

811
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:09,640
ago, former FBI director says they actually loved crypto the whole time because it was

812
00:44:09,640 --> 00:44:12,560
far easier to track than real money.

813
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:14,840
One hundred percent underscored.

814
00:44:14,840 --> 00:44:19,960
Everybody that tells you that like Bitcoin is great for cybercrime and criminals has

815
00:44:19,960 --> 00:44:22,040
no idea what they're talking about.

816
00:44:22,040 --> 00:44:25,920
Every single transaction is traceable on the block chain, especially if you're using a

817
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:27,520
centralized wallet, kids.

818
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:28,520
Yeah, that's.

819
00:44:28,520 --> 00:44:29,520
Yeah.

820
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:31,800
Well, and just about every Bitcoin you buy today, unless you use something like Robo

821
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:34,920
stats is it's tracked from the moment you buy it.

822
00:44:34,920 --> 00:44:36,760
They have your name, your ID, your information.

823
00:44:36,760 --> 00:44:40,960
When you buy that Bitcoin, they know that address is associated with your identity.

824
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:45,520
The exchanges will hand that over immediately to the authorities when they want it.

825
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:55,040
There is the most private, secure, untraceable way to pay for crime is cash, art, precious

826
00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:56,040
metals.

827
00:44:56,040 --> 00:44:57,520
And that's truly what the criminals use.

828
00:44:57,520 --> 00:45:00,000
They don't use Bitcoin, Monero potentially.

829
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:03,920
But the value of Monero is so low that you and the liquidity of Monero is so low that

830
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:06,020
you can't move really anything serious.

831
00:45:06,020 --> 00:45:08,120
You can't do like a big drug deal in Monero.

832
00:45:08,120 --> 00:45:11,680
You know, I guess that depends on your definition of big, but there's just not enough.

833
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:14,720
There's also not a lot of liquidity in crypto.

834
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:15,720
It's not a huge market.

835
00:45:15,720 --> 00:45:18,140
So you can't move millions of illegal dollars.

836
00:45:18,140 --> 00:45:22,120
And if you did, it would fundamentally shift the price.

837
00:45:22,120 --> 00:45:26,960
Like the entire community would notice if like 10 million dollars of illicit funds move

838
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:33,440
through the Bitcoin network and it would be so obvious and it would be so traceable.

839
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:35,320
It's not what you want to use for illegal activity.

840
00:45:35,320 --> 00:45:36,620
So this is your PSA.

841
00:45:36,620 --> 00:45:41,400
If you want to join the heights of organized crime, as Chris and I apparently have, buy

842
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:42,400
some Van Gogh.

843
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:43,480
There you go.

844
00:45:43,480 --> 00:45:44,480
In cash.

845
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:45,480
Hunter's got pictures.

846
00:45:45,480 --> 00:45:46,480
He'll sell.

847
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:47,480
He takes diamonds of payments.

848
00:45:47,480 --> 00:45:53,080
I joke, but that does give you a little insight into how the elite do that kind of business

849
00:45:53,080 --> 00:45:54,080
off the record.

850
00:45:54,080 --> 00:45:55,080
It's fascinating stuff.

851
00:45:55,080 --> 00:46:02,920
If you put the political stuff aside, it's fascinating.

852
00:46:02,920 --> 00:46:04,120
Just a couple of thank yous out there.

853
00:46:04,120 --> 00:46:06,520
We got 2048 sats from our 30s.

854
00:46:06,520 --> 00:46:12,700
He says, sending in some thanks with the sats he earned, just listening to podcasts in fountain.fm.

855
00:46:12,700 --> 00:46:18,720
And we've got a classic row of ducks from Mr. Quackers, Quacka Wacka.

856
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:19,720
It's a treasure.

857
00:46:19,720 --> 00:46:20,720
Yippee.

858
00:46:20,720 --> 00:46:21,720
Coming in once again.

859
00:46:21,720 --> 00:46:24,880
We see you out there, Mr. Quackers and appreciate you appreciate everybody who boosts in.

860
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:29,440
You can go get yourself a brand new spanking new podcast app and new podcast apps dot com.

861
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:32,900
These are podcasting 2.0 compatible along with the boosting.

862
00:46:32,900 --> 00:46:38,500
There's a bunch of other great 30 other fantastic features that a really brilliant, really fast

863
00:46:38,500 --> 00:46:40,540
moving community are developing.

864
00:46:40,540 --> 00:46:41,760
It's really exciting times.

865
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:45,120
We talk about it actually a lot on office hours, if you're curious, office hours, not

866
00:46:45,120 --> 00:46:46,120
here.

867
00:46:46,120 --> 00:46:49,220
So I try to get it all out over there so I don't fill these shows up with something I'm

868
00:46:49,220 --> 00:46:50,720
just so super excited about.

869
00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:54,260
I think it's just really time the podcast industry had some improvements that were done

870
00:46:54,260 --> 00:46:57,460
decentralized that aren't tied to Apple or Spotify.

871
00:46:57,460 --> 00:47:01,220
It's a movement that you can join by upgrading to a podcasting 2.0 compatible app at new

872
00:47:01,220 --> 00:47:03,200
podcast apps dot com.

873
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:08,340
I want to say a big thank you to our members to you invest in the ongoing production of

874
00:47:08,340 --> 00:47:09,340
these shows.

875
00:47:09,340 --> 00:47:12,720
And as a thank you, we have created an ad free feed for you so you get a nice tight

876
00:47:12,720 --> 00:47:14,900
coder still produced by Drew.

877
00:47:14,900 --> 00:47:16,520
Just no ads in there.

878
00:47:16,520 --> 00:47:19,540
And of course, you get the coderly report when a fresh one is available for you every

879
00:47:19,540 --> 00:47:21,380
single quarter, which will be coming up soon.

880
00:47:21,380 --> 00:47:26,380
You can join at Coder QA dot co or you can support every show and get every show on the

881
00:47:26,380 --> 00:47:29,160
network ad free at Jupiter dot party.

882
00:47:29,160 --> 00:47:32,460
Mr. Dominic, is there anywhere you want to send the good people this week?

883
00:47:32,460 --> 00:47:37,580
Well, after your admonishment about Twitter, you're right.

884
00:47:37,580 --> 00:47:39,700
I was going to go on Twitter, but you know what?

885
00:47:39,700 --> 00:47:42,080
Let's challenge ourselves for seven days.

886
00:47:42,080 --> 00:47:44,620
Let's just like be nice to the other tech nerds.

887
00:47:44,620 --> 00:47:45,940
There's not that many of us.

888
00:47:45,940 --> 00:47:47,700
We could do it for seven days.

889
00:47:47,700 --> 00:47:48,700
Seven days.

890
00:47:48,700 --> 00:47:49,700
We could do it.

891
00:47:49,700 --> 00:47:51,780
You know where people are actually genuinely nice?

892
00:47:51,780 --> 00:47:52,780
Our matrix chat.

893
00:47:52,780 --> 00:47:57,620
That is shorter that show slash matrix going 24 seven good people, not a huge crowd, but

894
00:47:57,620 --> 00:48:00,140
a really good crowd in there.

895
00:48:00,140 --> 00:48:01,140
That's a spot, too.

896
00:48:01,140 --> 00:48:02,300
And sometimes Mr. Dominic pops in.

897
00:48:02,300 --> 00:48:03,300
I do.

898
00:48:03,300 --> 00:48:05,380
And sometimes I play Magic the Gathering with the people in there.

899
00:48:05,380 --> 00:48:06,380
I saw that.

900
00:48:06,380 --> 00:48:07,380
That's so great.

901
00:48:07,380 --> 00:48:09,460
I believe I've thus far gone undefeated.

902
00:48:09,460 --> 00:48:10,460
So, yeah.

903
00:48:10,460 --> 00:48:13,020
Oh, very nice.

904
00:48:13,020 --> 00:48:17,060
If you are on the Twitter, you can check out at the Mad Botter Inc, you know, or the podcast

905
00:48:17,060 --> 00:48:18,060
at Coder Radio Show.

906
00:48:18,060 --> 00:48:19,060
You could do that.

907
00:48:19,060 --> 00:48:20,060
I suppose.

908
00:48:20,060 --> 00:48:22,020
I mean, there is the whole network to add Jupiter signal.

909
00:48:22,020 --> 00:48:23,020
I don't know.

910
00:48:23,020 --> 00:48:24,020
I don't know.

911
00:48:24,020 --> 00:48:25,020
It's weird.

912
00:48:25,020 --> 00:48:26,020
You know, we have the Telegram group.

913
00:48:26,020 --> 00:48:27,020
That's not Twitter.

914
00:48:27,020 --> 00:48:28,020
That's podcasting.com.

915
00:48:28,020 --> 00:48:29,020
Telegram.

916
00:48:29,020 --> 00:48:30,020
I don't know.

917
00:48:30,020 --> 00:48:31,020
Most people listen.

918
00:48:31,020 --> 00:48:32,020
Just want to listen.

919
00:48:32,020 --> 00:48:33,020
They don't even need any of this social crap.

920
00:48:33,020 --> 00:48:34,020
God, that's so nice.

921
00:48:34,020 --> 00:48:35,020
So simple.

922
00:48:35,020 --> 00:48:39,100
But then again, I'm part of the problem because I like talking to people, you know, don't

923
00:48:39,100 --> 00:48:40,100
know what to do with that.

924
00:48:40,100 --> 00:48:41,580
I like posting memes on Twitter.

925
00:48:41,580 --> 00:48:43,420
Yeah, that is fun.

926
00:48:43,420 --> 00:48:47,140
Well, links to what we talked about include any memes or hot Twitter threads over at Coder

927
00:48:47,140 --> 00:48:49,060
dot show slash four eight eight.

928
00:48:49,060 --> 00:48:50,540
You'll find our contact form there.

929
00:48:50,540 --> 00:48:51,540
We want your emails.

930
00:48:51,540 --> 00:48:53,220
We need more emails into the show.

931
00:48:53,220 --> 00:48:55,380
And we say you should probably get the RSS feed.

932
00:48:55,380 --> 00:48:56,380
I mean, just to be a pro.

933
00:48:56,380 --> 00:48:57,380
Go grab that RSS feed.

934
00:48:57,380 --> 00:48:58,380
That's what we say.

935
00:48:58,380 --> 00:49:01,740
You can join us live Jupiter at two Mondays at nine a.m.

936
00:49:01,740 --> 00:49:02,740
Pacific.

937
00:49:02,740 --> 00:49:27,140
See you next week.
