00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
This is KOTOR Radio, episode 482 for September 5th, 2022.

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:20,080
Hey good buddy, welcome back to Jupiter Broadcasting's weekly talk show, taking a pragmatic look

3
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:25,000
at the art and the business of software development and the world of technology.

4
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,920
My name is Chris over here on the West Coast and our hostess with the mostest over on the

5
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:30,640
East Coast, it's Mr. Dominic.

6
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:31,640
Hello Mike.

7
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:35,160
Happy Labor Day greetings for Florida, where we don't believe in paid time off unless you're

8
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:36,160
retired.

9
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:38,160
Or in podcasting either, have you noticed?

10
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:39,160
Yes.

11
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:40,160
The only holiday we take is Christmas.

12
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:41,160
We take Christmas, yes.

13
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:42,160
Yeah.

14
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:43,160
Yeah.

15
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:46,560
I don't think we do a show on Thanksgiving, but that's just because we both like to eat.

16
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:47,560
Yeah.

17
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:49,760
We've got to make room for the food.

18
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:50,760
How are you feeling?

19
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:51,760
You sound a little stuffed up.

20
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:52,760
A little stuffed up.

21
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:58,140
You know, I went to TCGCon last week and one thing that comes with those great in-person

22
00:00:58,140 --> 00:00:59,680
events is the conference flu.

23
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:00,680
Yeah.

24
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:02,160
You always got to get, remember we used to call that the con crud.

25
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:03,160
Now we just call it COVID.

26
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:04,160
Oh, oh.

27
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:06,320
How did it go though?

28
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:08,280
Would you do it again knowing you're going to get sick?

29
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:09,280
Last week was TCGCon.

30
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:10,280
It went great.

31
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:11,280
We talked about it.

32
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:16,280
This weekend was the Dominaria United MTG pre-release.

33
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:18,920
Oh, whoa, whoa.

34
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:21,560
I did two weeks in a row.

35
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:23,520
This is another magic event.

36
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:24,520
Another magic event.

37
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:28,480
I did two days of planes walking and tapping that mana.

38
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:30,400
I tapped that mana so hard.

39
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,760
It was amazing.

40
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:36,320
So Squirrely Dave was asking for stats.

41
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:37,320
Here we go.

42
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:39,760
Five and O, standard.

43
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:40,760
Boom.

44
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:41,760
Won that one.

45
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:42,760
Ha!

46
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:46,860
Did a sealed arena sealed, which is the digital version.

47
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:47,860
Five and three.

48
00:01:47,860 --> 00:01:48,860
That's not a win.

49
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:49,860
All right.

50
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:53,000
Did a in-person sealed.

51
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,600
Five and two.

52
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:58,520
Some reason the arena always has until you lose to three.

53
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:00,200
The in-person one is based on who shows up.

54
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:02,520
So that was okay.

55
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:06,880
I will say that five is my lucky number.

56
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:13,080
I think what happens is as I progress through the day into the evening, I get more tired.

57
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:14,080
Sure.

58
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:16,320
And just a little more lazy.

59
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:18,020
So yeah, also played some Commander.

60
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:19,720
It was a long weekend.

61
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:23,540
If you stay at it, you can probably overcome some of that sleepiness.

62
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:25,160
You can probably train that out a little bit.

63
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:27,440
But also, you just kind of started this.

64
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:28,440
You're doing pretty good.

65
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:29,440
Right?

66
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:30,440
This is the second event.

67
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:31,440
You're doing pretty good.

68
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:32,440
Pretty excited.

69
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:36,240
I'm going to, you know, the COVID gods permitting, I'm going to go to TamperNerdCon in November.

70
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:38,240
I'm playing in two events there.

71
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:39,240
Yeah.

72
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:40,240
Ha!

73
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:41,240
Oh, man.

74
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:42,240
That's great.

75
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:43,240
Well.

76
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:44,240
Well.

77
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:45,240
I'm looking forward to hearing how that goes.

78
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,240
Yeah.

79
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:47,240
Come on, folks.

80
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:48,240
Hit me up on arena.

81
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:49,240
Let's do this.

82
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:50,240
Oh, gosh.

83
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,240
Oh, no.

84
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:52,240
This is going to become a whole thing.

85
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,240
All right.

86
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:59,200
Well, moving right along before it takes roots, ChunkyPie wrote in about RSI and he had a

87
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,200
few hot tips.

88
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:01,200
He's in his 40s.

89
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:04,160
He's been using keyboards since high school.

90
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:06,960
And of course, every job he's ever had, keyboards.

91
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:10,280
He's now learning to become a developer, keyboards.

92
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:13,440
And his big lesson, he says, is the ergonomics really matter.

93
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:16,760
And the sooner you start taking the ergonomics seriously, the better off you likely will

94
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:17,760
be.

95
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:20,120
And as he puts it, keyboards aren't going to go away anytime soon.

96
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:22,640
So it's best to adapt your workspace now to optimize.

97
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:25,000
We got a few notes on the RSI subject.

98
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,320
So thank you, everybody.

99
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:30,160
I appreciate your thoughts there because I agree with the sentiment, like take advantage,

100
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:33,280
get yourself a good working setup today.

101
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:37,060
And it's sort of like an investment in your tools, which is your body parts.

102
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:38,280
We also got some feedback from Adam.

103
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:40,440
He says, hey, guys, love the show.

104
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:45,600
For RSI issues, well, it's taken me a few years, but I think I found the perfect solution,

105
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,400
at least in my case.

106
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:50,920
My desk chair is actually a Staples gaming chair, which has the armrest sitting at the

107
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:52,880
same height as my desk.

108
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:57,920
For keyboards, I need a split ortholinear keyboard that lets you split or rebound.

109
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:58,920
I have two mice.

110
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:03,520
I switch between them, a Logitech MX Master as my main, and then I have an Anker ergonomic

111
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:05,280
vertical mouse.

112
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:09,960
Using this combination has cured 95% of my RSI.

113
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:11,840
And actually, I'll jump in there, Adam.

114
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,460
I also do this at home.

115
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:15,080
For some reason, I don't do it much at work.

116
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:17,240
But at home, I switch between two different mice.

117
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:21,040
I have the MX vertical, and I have a trackpad.

118
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:23,680
I think the trackpad is probably harder on my hands overall.

119
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,600
The verticals are really cool mice if you've never seen those.

120
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:32,860
They look weird, but they really work because you change how you move the mouse.

121
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:36,600
Instead of a side-to-side wrist action, it's a side-to-side arm action.

122
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:39,440
It's much easier on the old wrist.

123
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:41,640
And then there was a topic, Mike, that I talked about.

124
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:45,720
Just this is what I effing love about this show.

125
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:50,440
You and I will just randomly toss something out there just as an aside, and then the audience

126
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:51,440
takes and runs with it.

127
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:52,760
Because we've got some boosts about this, too.

128
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:53,760
And Adam wrote in on email.

129
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:58,840
He says, on the topic of uniforms, I can't believe this, but we had multiple people writing

130
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:01,280
about uniforms.

131
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:02,280
I touched on something.

132
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:03,280
I don't know.

133
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:04,960
Maybe there's something to it.

134
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:09,240
Adam says, my daily work uniform is a black t-shirt, black cargo shorts, black socks,

135
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:11,120
and dark blue shoes.

136
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:15,440
I work construction, so all black hides the copious amounts of sweating that I do.

137
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:19,320
With my regular clothes, it's mostly just jeans and khakis and a white or black t-shirt.

138
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:22,640
I do have a few novelty shirts, like he has his old Last Tux t-shirt.

139
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:25,320
But he kind of has like, I don't know if I'd call that a uniform.

140
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:29,080
He kind of has like a set of small range of clothing.

141
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:30,560
That is almost too complicated for me.

142
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:33,360
I want just like the same thing all the time, almost.

143
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,680
But we'll see.

144
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:35,680
We'll come back to that later.

145
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,120
And then Adam had, he had three points.

146
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,760
This is his third point, his last point.

147
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:40,600
And this one he's taken us to task on.

148
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:44,160
On a side note, why is everyone raving about the launch keyboard?

149
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:49,480
I know it's made by System76, but I've seen that build quality and that layout before.

150
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:52,840
Also, the firmware isn't as open source as everyone claims.

151
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:54,840
It's based off of QMK.

152
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:55,840
That is open source.

153
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:58,840
Also, I'm not sure if you all mentioned it, but I don't think they're going to be able

154
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:01,840
to support wireless anytime soon because of QMK.

155
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:04,880
I don't mean to rain on anyone's parade, but I have been in the mechanical keyboard world

156
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:10,840
for several years and the launch isn't anything new, but keep up the great work.

157
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:18,960
So I thought this is an interesting little snapshot here because Adam mentions the build

158
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:25,000
quality before, but I don't think he's ever owned a launch and I'm holding the launch

159
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
right now in my hands.

160
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,160
And so I don't know how he can comment on the build quality, which is excellent.

161
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:31,480
But you know, there's an interesting thing here.

162
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:34,120
It's like I went and did a little digging around on the open source stuff.

163
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:38,800
It looks like projects that integrate with the launch, like the keyboard configurator,

164
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:43,960
it's GPL, the FWEPD stuff is all GPL, the layout, the design, the CAD drawings, that's

165
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:44,960
all GPL.

166
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:48,280
I don't know if everything in the firmware is GPL.

167
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:53,400
I don't really know if it's further than any other keyboard vendor or most keyboard vendors

168
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:55,640
take it, is that good enough?

169
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:56,640
Is that where that line is?

170
00:06:56,640 --> 00:07:02,200
And then the other thing is, if somebody else has made a keyboard like this, it doesn't

171
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:06,320
really matter if System76 is introducing it to a new market, a market that maybe hasn't

172
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:11,400
bought that stuff before, but trust the build of System76, so they're willing to spend that

173
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:14,560
money on a keyboard when maybe they weren't before, because that's me.

174
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:17,800
It was just about the time the launch came around where, you guys know on the history

175
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:21,680
of the show, I was starting to just consider mechanical keyboards for my RSI, and they

176
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:24,160
happened to just nail the timing with the launch.

177
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:28,560
But I was never in that market really before, and it kind of opened my eyes to that.

178
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:29,560
Yeah.

179
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:32,720
I mean, the other thing is, you know, longtime listeners know that there used to be a brand

180
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:35,880
of mechanical keyboard that I religiously used.

181
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:40,320
People they sense, I don't know if they got a PE bio or what happened, but their quality

182
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:45,480
has just gone way down in recent years, and they've focused on kind of more whiz-bangy

183
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:46,480
features.

184
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:48,560
I don't know, more competition's good, right?

185
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:54,840
I think I'm using the launch, I'm still testing out the launch small one, the Lite, with the

186
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:55,840
pink switches.

187
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:57,200
I think it's pretty good.

188
00:07:57,200 --> 00:08:00,200
I prefer the bigger one because I like the USB hub.

189
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:04,840
One fair point in his email, though, yeah, right, wireless would be better, but then

190
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:07,200
you lose the USB hub.

191
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:11,360
But for the Lite, definitely wireless, because there is no hub.

192
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:16,480
Still, I kind of like the idea of there's lots of different configurations, lots of

193
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:19,980
different keyboards made by lots of different vendors, and you just got to find the right

194
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:20,980
one for you.

195
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:22,160
It's like building your lightsaber.

196
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:26,920
Yeah, and you know, there's lots of different hands, and different hands fit better with

197
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:27,920
different lightsabers.

198
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:28,920
Right.

199
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,440
Not every Batlet is for you.

200
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:31,780
You have to find the right one.

201
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:33,260
Let me tell you.

202
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:34,260
Let me tell you.

203
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:35,440
One ear's sewed back on.

204
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:36,440
Let me tell you.

205
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:37,440
Exactly.

206
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:38,440
Not my ear.

207
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:39,440
Not my ear, of course.

208
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,520
And everybody's different.

209
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:43,560
We all have different appearances, heights, weights.

210
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:45,960
For instance, take a look at Takuvma and Kalish.

211
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:47,480
How much more different could you get?

212
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:49,680
Yeah, I agree with you there.

213
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:55,120
So speaking of keeping things similar, perhaps even uniform, DeckBot wrote in about the uniform

214
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,120
lifestyle.

215
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:58,640
He says, you were discussing the uniform lifestyle.

216
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:03,020
Where I come from, like my work, there's no such requirement, but I do occasionally travel

217
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:06,400
for customers, so I'm allotted five free t-shirts a year.

218
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:10,840
The choices between salesy, a white or blue button-down shirts with tastefully embroidered

219
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:15,120
logos on the breast, or just black polos featuring the embroidered logo.

220
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:18,920
Naturally, I chose the black polos since the customer portion of the floor is typically

221
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:22,900
a dirty industrial environment where everything is coated in metal dust, especially the Linux

222
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:26,040
welders I'm working with.

223
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:27,040
Right on, DeckBot.

224
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:28,480
Tell me more about that.

225
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:32,440
After a decade of free polos, my wardrobe evolved into a collage of corporate black

226
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:37,480
polos with generations of marketing and obsoleted logos and slogans that generally pair well

227
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:39,740
with jeans.

228
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:41,440
That hits, right?

229
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,440
That hits.

230
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:47,260
A decade of free polos, my wardrobe has evolved into a collage of corporate black polos with

231
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:50,440
generations of marketing and obsoleted logos.

232
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:51,440
That hits.

233
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,440
That hits.

234
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:53,440
Okay.

235
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:59,740
He says, in the morning, my choices devolved into what is clean and how old is the logo?

236
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:00,740
That also hits.

237
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:04,480
He says, I tend to hang the clean laundry in the back of the closet and just pull shirts

238
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,680
from the front so all shirts are cycled evenly.

239
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:07,840
I try to do something similar.

240
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:11,580
He says, I hear JB has a bunch of shirt merch on some websites.

241
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:15,240
Five to 10 shirts should set you up for daily wear, leaving you nerd shirts for special

242
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:18,000
occasions, save from daily wear, tear, and abuse.

243
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,400
Thanks for all the shows, DeckBot.

244
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:24,480
This is something a couple of people touched on is, maybe I should buy my own swag.

245
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:29,600
I do actually have pretty much all my clothes on my own swag, but they're all old swag.

246
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:33,400
I feel like I need to do a whole new refurb and then just buy a bunch of them.

247
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:35,040
But we'll see.

248
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:36,360
I appreciate the thoughts on uniforms.

249
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:39,760
We'll leave it there until we get to the boosts for now, but please do keep it coming.

250
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:41,280
Although, I haven't talked to you about it.

251
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:43,360
I don't know if it's possible.

252
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:47,120
At some point in the next two weeks, it'd be really great if we record a double.

253
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:50,920
You don't have to, but it would just make travel time a little easier that first week.

254
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:51,920
Yeah, sure.

255
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:52,920
Let's do it.

256
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:56,320
So I'm thinking we need the audience to send in as many boosts and contact forms as possible

257
00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:01,000
to help fill our bags, so that way we have plenty to go through, so that way we don't

258
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,280
miss a beat on the prerecords.

259
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:09,920
And then our last email today comes in from Daniel, and he wants to talk about remote

260
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:10,920
work.

261
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:14,760
And I've been kind of thinning these out, not really including most of these, but he

262
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:18,200
touched on one thing in here that put it over the line, so I wanted to conclude it in the

263
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,200
show.

264
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:22,480
He writes, I've been listening for a good five years at this point, and I really love

265
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:23,480
the show.

266
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:25,240
I wanted to comment on the remote debate.

267
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:29,600
I will concede that the tooling is good enough to get the job done effectively.

268
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:32,040
That even includes pair programming.

269
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:37,600
Nevertheless, losing the social side of things is a deterrent to the work culture.

270
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:41,520
If you like to play pickleball after work, for example, I might be a little nicer about

271
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:45,280
the fact that you're failing to execute and putting me behind on something.

272
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:50,400
But if you're just a name on a screen, well, you're getting blamed in the nicest way I

273
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:51,960
can think to do so.

274
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:57,200
Chris, you've called this out before, when we see each other as humans, we work better

275
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:00,840
and it's very hard to see each other as humans if all we do is talk to each other during

276
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:04,440
a stand up, even if you have a stand up meeting.

277
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:08,320
Some of us actually like people.

278
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:12,740
Daniel has touched on something that I want to phrase a little bit differently than throw

279
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:14,720
it at you.

280
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:16,900
I have experienced this with myself.

281
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:23,120
When I have met someone in person and I conceptualize them as a three dimensional human being that

282
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:28,760
has an entire life and problems and I actually see it and I learn a little bit about them,

283
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:34,920
maybe I spend some time with them, I am more generous in a text only conversation.

284
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:37,560
I am more generous about things slipping.

285
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:44,060
I am more understanding about their situation versus before then, even though if you would

286
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:47,560
have asked me before I had met them, I would have told you I was doing those things because

287
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:49,680
I honestly thought I was.

288
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:52,960
But I was doing to the best of my ability for the character that I conceptualized in

289
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:56,920
my mind that I'm interacting with in a low bandwidth means.

290
00:12:56,920 --> 00:13:01,040
But when I met them in person and that exchange became high bandwidth and I learned things

291
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:04,520
about them, perhaps they didn't even want to volunteer, but it's just observational.

292
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:12,280
I built out a more complete model of that person in my mind and that model seems to

293
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:15,560
afford me more empathy for them now.

294
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:19,120
And I think that makes a big difference in the workplace and the only way you can have

295
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:24,360
it is if people spend not just like a day together, but maybe some significant amount

296
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:25,360
of time together.

297
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:31,360
And I think that makes for a well oiled team and again, I see it here with the JB team.

298
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:37,400
When we get together for stuff, for events, the team really gels people because their

299
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:43,220
friendships really kind of reignite, it really kind of gets people fired up for a while.

300
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:49,140
And it's just there's no way of replicating it online hard as we might try.

301
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:52,480
And that has made them more productive and it's true for all businesses I've ever been

302
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:53,480
involved in.

303
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:54,480
And it's just inescapable.

304
00:13:54,480 --> 00:14:00,120
Yeah, I mean, we're never going to be able to 100% replicate the experience.

305
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:05,760
I just keep falling back to it kind of doesn't really matter because the ship has already

306
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:06,960
sailed.

307
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:12,000
In our industry, remote work is a is a is a fait accompli for the most part.

308
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:16,400
I mean, even Apple's struggling to drag people back to the office, right?

309
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:19,080
It's kind of like a natural disaster happened.

310
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:22,240
And now we have to deal with this and we're going to have to learn a new way.

311
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:23,720
That's literally what happened.

312
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:24,720
Exactly.

313
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:25,720
You might be right.

314
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:26,720
You might be right.

315
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:27,720
I think you're right.

316
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:28,720
Depending on what you think of certain lab.

317
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:29,720
Heyo.

318
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:30,720
Let me get the bacon.

319
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:31,720
Let me get the bacon.

320
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:35,120
Now, I follow what you're saying, actually.

321
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:38,960
It's sort of it's like, yes, all those things are true.

322
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:43,320
And still, we are going to have to figure out a way to do this.

323
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:45,520
Insert standard metaverse plug here, I suppose.

324
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:46,520
Well, let's do it on.

325
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:47,520
You know what?

326
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:50,160
Let's just do it on small scales as we can individually.

327
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:53,280
Let's take it upon ourselves, individual responsibility, blah, blah, blah, blah.

328
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:54,280
That's the worst.

329
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:55,280
I know.

330
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:56,280
Right.

331
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:57,280
In other words, come hang out with us on the West Coast.

332
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:58,280
We're going to be in southern Oregon.

333
00:14:58,280 --> 00:14:59,840
We'll be in northern California.

334
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:02,640
We're doing JPL and we're doing a meet up near JPL.

335
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:05,600
So even if you didn't get your name picked, you can still come hang out with us on the

336
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:06,600
30th.

337
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:12,440
And we'll also do another meet up in Oregon in the northern Oregon area on October 7th.

338
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:15,120
All of this is at meet up dot com slash Jupiter Broadcasting.

339
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:19,000
And we also have our West Coast crew where we're chatting about details, answering individual

340
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:23,400
questions, bit dot l y slash West Coast crew.

341
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:26,040
We'll have new swag on board, brand new swag.

342
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:28,920
We'll be doing some geocaches as we go out.

343
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:31,800
And of course, I'll be doing some shows on the road.

344
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:34,920
In fact, starting to freak out a little bit about that.

345
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:37,960
So, you know, send us in your feedback.

346
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:41,000
Coder dot show slash contact or send us in a boost.

347
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,040
New podcast apps dot com.

348
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:48,440
More appreciated than ever when I'm out there burning gas on the road.

349
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:50,520
Linode dot com slash Coder.

350
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:53,420
That's where you go to get one hundred dollars in 60 day credit on a new account.

351
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:56,480
And it's just a great way to support the show while you're checking something really awesome

352
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:57,480
out.

353
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:59,160
I love Linode.

354
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:01,880
And what does love got to do with it?

355
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:08,840
I mean, you might just think it's an old fashioned notion, but I'll tell you, love is performance.

356
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:11,040
Love is knowing you're supported.

357
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:16,080
Love is knowing that there are 11 data centers around the world dutifully serving your data

358
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:20,960
up to your customers, your clients, your friends and your family or yourself.

359
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:27,160
Linode's been building servers designed to run Linux in the cloud the fastest, most reliable

360
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:32,400
and most economical way possible for nearly 19 years.

361
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:34,480
That's why I say go try it for yourself.

362
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:40,000
That hundred dollars will really let you actually try it at Linode dot com slash Coder.

363
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,400
I like to mention the stuff that appeals to me.

364
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:45,980
And like one of the very first things that always comes to mind is the performance that

365
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:47,240
really does stand out.

366
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:53,320
But you know, we're almost three years into this and it has been perfect, really.

367
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:58,000
I mean, I do not regret a single moment of hosting, feel even more fired up and passionate

368
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:02,040
about that choice as time has gone on.

369
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:07,520
And as a business owner, but even just as, you know, an enthusiast, when you make that

370
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:12,120
choice, when you make a technical foundational choice and it continues to pay off, it continues

371
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:17,040
to give dividends, it continues to be a good choice, that feels really good.

372
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:19,180
It's like I made the right choice there.

373
00:17:19,180 --> 00:17:20,180
That has been great.

374
00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:23,400
That's something that is not a problem I have had to deal with.

375
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:26,600
And they're 30 to 50 percent cheaper than the major hyperscalers out there that just

376
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:30,000
want to lock you into their duopoly platforms with their esoteric language for the crazy

377
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,880
things they call the different services that they've ripped off from the free software

378
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:34,880
community.

379
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:35,880
Like that's how they make their money.

380
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:39,060
And then they haven't even architected their businesses in a way where they can provide

381
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:43,520
the support that you need, especially when it's something that's mission critical.

382
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:45,200
And Linode's done all of that.

383
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:48,520
And I think it all starts in the DNA.

384
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:51,520
Linode started because they were passionate about the technology.

385
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:55,520
They saw where this virtualization tech, this user mode Linux stuff that was coming, they

386
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:57,180
saw where that could go.

387
00:17:57,180 --> 00:18:00,960
And now, 19 years later, I think they have the best set of options in the business as

388
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:02,880
they've whittled away and built something incredible.

389
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:04,080
So go try it out.

390
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:05,080
Support the show.

391
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:06,080
Maybe learn something.

392
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:13,520
And get $100 for 60 days on a new account, linode.com slash coder.

393
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:17,800
So the show's been on the air for a really long time, really, really long time.

394
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:21,680
We don't even have the entire back archive on the new website yet because we just launched

395
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:24,800
the new website last week, but we are adding it.

396
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:26,440
And it goes back basically 10 years.

397
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:28,320
I don't even know how that's possible.

398
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:32,500
We've exceeded the run of Linux Action Show by some bit.

399
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:36,680
We are on a roundhouse kick to 500 episodes.

400
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:41,720
And since we're sitting here on a Labor Day recording the pod, we thought, why don't we

401
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:47,760
look back at this last decade on how tooling has changed, processes, workflow, remote work,

402
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:48,760
platforms.

403
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:53,160
Let's just look back in time.

404
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:56,820
And I'm curious if you have any places you want to start on, you know, things that feel

405
00:18:56,820 --> 00:19:01,760
like major shifts for you, maybe specifically around tooling and things like that.

406
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:02,760
Yeah.

407
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:06,640
So I think a lot has changed since we started the show in terms of day-to-day work, right?

408
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:10,880
I seem to remember talking a lot about, you know, manual testing and QA departments and

409
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:18,120
yeah, let's pour one out for them while we're pouring one out for Sun.

410
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:19,120
Yeah.

411
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:20,120
There it is.

412
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:21,120
There it is.

413
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:22,120
There it is.

414
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:23,120
Automated testing, right?

415
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:27,400
What I guess you would call TDD was much more of a debate than it is now.

416
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:28,960
If it is at all.

417
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:34,480
In particular, the whole DevOps idea basically didn't exist 12 years ago.

418
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:36,760
And I was a little hostile towards it too.

419
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:38,240
You were hostile, you know.

420
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:39,280
I'm a little hostile.

421
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:40,520
I'm going to pat us on the back.

422
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:45,560
We did call Docker before it was called Docker when they were.cloud, was that their name

423
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:46,560
at the time?

424
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:48,680
Yeah, we had the CTO on, yep.

425
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:54,600
I remember very distinctly feeling like the blurring of developer and sysadmin was a very

426
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:55,600
bad practice.

427
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:57,560
Am I still going to feel that way?

428
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:58,700
You had some fee-fees.

429
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:00,440
You had some strong fee-fees, yes.

430
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:01,440
I did.

431
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:02,440
I did.

432
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:06,160
Now, to be fair, the tooling has improved tremendously and things like Ansible have

433
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:11,280
come along and Git and that stuff has really, really made quite a big improvement.

434
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:16,760
And now, now I'm the guy that's like deploying changes by updating things on GitHub and then,

435
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:21,120
you know, letting just things happen in the background and rebuild things for me.

436
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:23,360
It's a very strange sensation.

437
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:25,640
It's a strange energy, that's for sure.

438
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:28,480
But it's the de facto standard now.

439
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:34,400
In fact, you know, I talked about this, T&B, we moved back to GitHub for the most part

440
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:38,320
because it's just got too hard to fight the tide with a small team.

441
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:43,000
It's just easier to set up the either direct GitHub integration, you know, with something

442
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:48,320
like a DO apps or Heroku, which Heroku is going through some changes.

443
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:52,280
It's, we should talk about, we need to have a heart to heart with Heroku.

444
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:55,120
There's some, some stuff's going on over there.

445
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:58,980
I'm not quite sure I understand it other than that they killed their free tier and raised

446
00:20:58,980 --> 00:20:59,980
all their prices.

447
00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:00,980
Oh yeah.

448
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:04,880
Which seems adorable, but yeah.

449
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:06,960
Don't even get me started on GitHub actions, right?

450
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:08,880
You got a problem, they've got an action.

451
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:09,880
It's amazing.

452
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:10,880
Yeah.

453
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:13,680
I could see a lot of our publishing pipeline based around GitHub actions.

454
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:14,680
Why not?

455
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:16,320
It's, it's pretty powerful.

456
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:21,120
The way we've been able to use actions, the way it just works with Hugo, it is, it is

457
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:26,540
so, it is so smooth for the deployment of the new site and it makes it possible for

458
00:21:26,540 --> 00:21:29,400
way more people to participate in the process.

459
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:33,560
And in the old sysadmin days, I would have had to have managed it all with user accounts

460
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:38,720
and groups and SSH keys and FTP access.

461
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:41,000
It truly was a worse way of doing things.

462
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:46,440
And now people can publish things to the website based on like their GitHub level of permissions.

463
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:51,840
And that makes participating in a community project way more doable.

464
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:56,800
It also adds a layer of, this is kind of a double edged sword with standardization, right?

465
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:57,880
And abstraction.

466
00:21:57,880 --> 00:22:01,160
Like you really, you know, you don't necessarily, not everyone in the, in the process even knows

467
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:02,160
what's going on.

468
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:03,920
They're not our hosting sponsor right now.

469
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:10,480
But I just, can I just call out a DO's app platform, which is effectively those sons

470
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:11,480
of bitches.

471
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:13,120
It's effectively just Docker containers.

472
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:14,120
Yeah.

473
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:18,880
And all they've done is basically saved you the hassle of having to know how to like register

474
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:24,120
on Docker hub and like, or even run your own little Docker hub and do all of this yourself,

475
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:26,680
set up, you know, engine X or whatever you're using.

476
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:31,320
You just point it to a GitHub repo, give it a little YAML file and bam, it pulls it out.

477
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:33,360
Umbral is a project for self hosting.

478
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:35,200
It's very much the same thing.

479
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,200
Same idea.

480
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:37,200
Yeah.

481
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:38,200
You just get a dashboard.

482
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:40,880
You click the thing like from an app store, which, you know, just an open source.

483
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:44,240
And it just does all the Docker stuff, all of the routing stuff in the background for

484
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:45,240
you.

485
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:46,240
Oh, well they all have that.

486
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:47,240
I don't know.

487
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:48,240
It has like, they have a whole list.

488
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:49,240
If you want to just like pull up.

489
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:50,240
I want GitLab.

490
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:51,240
I want Rails.

491
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:52,240
I want chicken.

492
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:53,240
Please.

493
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:54,240
Mammix.

494
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:55,240
Did I just go to Mammix?

495
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:59,480
Mammix is a very compressed version of what's happened to the car industry.

496
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:04,400
You and I came in just as they were starting to seal up the engines and we watched them

497
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:09,460
go from like open engines that anybody could work on and build to fully sealed up engines,

498
00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:13,080
but now way more available to, and there's way more people that can like deploy this

499
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:14,120
stuff now.

500
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:19,040
And that's what we've witnessed in a really compressed timeline in the run of the show.

501
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:23,080
To the point where orchestrating your containers has become a thing, right?

502
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:25,440
There's like a million consultants you want to go around.

503
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:27,240
They used to sell you agile training.

504
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:29,120
Now they want to sell you Kubernetes training.

505
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:30,120
Yes.

506
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:31,120
Oh my gosh.

507
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:36,680
And that's, you know, that's kind of, I don't have it on the list, but another big thing.

508
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:40,480
What the hell happened to the middle managers?

509
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:47,200
I haven't dealt with a PM who was a pure PM in probably like four years.

510
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,200
Yeah.

511
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:49,200
I think they're out there.

512
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:53,920
There's probably a large organizations, but otherwise it's always double duty.

513
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:56,040
Now it's always somebody else doing double duty.

514
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:59,720
It seems like, yeah, there's definitely like a PM person, but they're always like also

515
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:05,280
the DBA or they're like, you know, the guy who runs all the get stuff or he, the one

516
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:09,360
wizard of Kubernetes who orchestrates all their containers, right?

517
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:12,960
Or the, or your manager's also playing the role as PM, which is like kind of just doing

518
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:13,960
double duty.

519
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:18,160
But you know, I, I'm not necessarily against it because a lot of the PM hasn't been the

520
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:22,720
best thing to come along and it's sometimes it's added a, you know, it's, it, it adds

521
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:24,520
stakeholder creep having a PM.

522
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:26,800
No, I think we should do a jaunty jig on their grave.

523
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:27,800
I think it's good.

524
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:28,800
I'm saying this is a feature.

525
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:32,000
I thought we were going to, I thought we were going to disagree on this.

526
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,000
Oh, no.

527
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:38,360
I mean, I think if, you know, I like the lead, if you have a DBA, the DBA is a good PM.

528
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:40,760
The lead developer is probably a great PM.

529
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:41,760
Like what is a PM?

530
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:44,840
He organizes your Kanban board and that's another one.

531
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:47,600
Just the agile has eaten the damn world.

532
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:48,920
There's no argument anymore.

533
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:50,760
You're doing agile.

534
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:54,600
And I know our friend Adam's going to get mad at me, but even like a vet modeling, very

535
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:57,580
agile ask, very influenced by agile, right?

536
00:24:57,580 --> 00:24:59,800
It's all agile.

537
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:05,340
There's no one outside of maybe the DOD, even then doing waterfall it's over.

538
00:25:05,340 --> 00:25:07,000
And that's a big change.

539
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:10,480
If you go back, that was a huge, that was a huge discussion for years.

540
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:16,000
This huge, huge discussion for years, you know, I didn't even realize it would happen,

541
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:20,440
but looking back, there's a, there's like the master switch and, and into the plex.

542
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:26,560
There's a couple of books that are really good at showing how tech is kind of following

543
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:31,280
the trends of the radio industry and the car industry and all these previous industries

544
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:33,760
that have come along, even cable television.

545
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:38,360
And one trend that happens in there is these kinds of philosophies, economics even, right?

546
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:41,160
You've had Austrian economics and Kenzie and economics, right?

547
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:49,880
And over time, it just seems that a predominant philosophy does take over.

548
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:55,000
And you just don't even, when, when it reaches that kind of mass threshold, you don't even

549
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,400
realize it's happening because it's just normal now.

550
00:25:57,400 --> 00:26:00,320
It's just the way everybody, and maybe we don't even call it that anymore, right?

551
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:02,080
It's just the way things are.

552
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:03,760
It's just the way you do things now.

553
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:08,600
You know, I didn't even realize I was doing agile until I had to do the notes for the

554
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:14,240
show today and I was like, well, let's see, I have a combine born of weekly deliveries.

555
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:19,840
I deploy to production at least twice a month.

556
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:25,560
The only thing I don't do is standups because I mean, although we kind of do, we have a

557
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:30,640
daily check-in, but we don't do like, like there was some stupid ceremony in agile, right?

558
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:34,680
Like the, you know, the agile consultants were basically, I think flimflam men, right?

559
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:36,740
Well, that's always the stuff that turned me off.

560
00:26:36,740 --> 00:26:39,600
As soon as you get to the ceremony stuff, I started getting turned off.

561
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:43,760
I remember one, one place I was a contractor at, they had like this little ball.

562
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:47,120
It was like one of the, one of those Apple promo balls.

563
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:48,120
It was like kindergarten.

564
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:53,140
You couldn't talk unless you had the ball and you had to toss the ball, like playing

565
00:26:53,140 --> 00:26:55,920
catch for, you know, 30 year olds.

566
00:26:55,920 --> 00:27:01,480
I hate that stuff so much and I, I know it's about team building and it even sometimes

567
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:05,640
works on me when I'm forced to participate, which I hate even more, but I still hate it.

568
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:06,640
I never want to do it.

569
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:07,800
It feels like a huge waste of my time.

570
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:09,240
I'm a professional.

571
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:12,120
I'm always going to be as professional and polite as I can.

572
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:16,120
And we'll build a team bond based on the good work and the wins.

573
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:17,480
That's how you build a team bond is wins.

574
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:20,600
Well, and there's always the one dude who just can't catch and somebody's coffee lands

575
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:21,640
in a Mac book.

576
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:23,160
We're going to say that's what happened.

577
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:25,640
We're going to say that we're going to use that excuse.

578
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:26,640
Yeah.

579
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:27,640
Right.

580
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:28,640
Okay.

581
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:29,640
Very good.

582
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:30,640
Yeah.

583
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:32,200
You know, one of the things, uh, just kind of while we're touching on all of this is

584
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:33,400
what we have landed on.

585
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:37,680
And I think it's for the better is a lot of my processes now are just self-documenting

586
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:40,880
where in the past all the documentation required me to generate it.

587
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:45,160
Like when I pushed a production, there's a commit log there where I leave a note, right?

588
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:49,700
When I configure something in like Nix, there's a configuration comment that I leave behind

589
00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:53,580
or like when we deploy something for the web server and ansible that's self-documenting

590
00:27:53,580 --> 00:27:55,640
ansible is self-documenting now.

591
00:27:55,640 --> 00:28:01,040
And that is a game changer for me because I sometimes do documentation and I do it really

592
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:04,560
good and then I, and then I like burn out for a year and then I don't do it for like

593
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:05,560
a year.

594
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:08,480
So it's a lot of this stuff, a lot of these processes, not all of them, but a lot of these

595
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:14,040
processes now, you know, the kids these days, uh, they're self-documenting and I think that's

596
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:15,040
a net positive.

597
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:16,040
Yeah.

598
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:17,040
I would just like to add to that list.

599
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:22,280
The, uh, fast API, the thing Alice has written on, it's, uh, got beautiful self-documentation

600
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:25,040
and I know the.net folks have something similar.

601
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:29,040
Uh, shout out to Wes again for turning me on to fast API a couple of years ago.

602
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:30,040
Super helpful.

603
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:31,040
You want to talk a little remote?

604
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:32,700
I mean, that's the elephant in here.

605
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:33,700
I feel like.

606
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:34,700
Yeah.

607
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:37,720
I mean, so, you know, we talk about remote all the time.

608
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:42,720
I would actually like to twist this into an actual doing development remotely.

609
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:44,440
Not like, is it good for management?

610
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:45,440
Are people lonely?

611
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:46,440
You know, whatever.

612
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:48,120
Are they wearing pants?

613
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:53,780
I kind of, so, you know, I've been doing the code pilot experiment and it is comically

614
00:28:53,780 --> 00:28:56,520
bad when it's bad.

615
00:28:56,520 --> 00:29:01,600
But I realized, and again, this kind of came to me last night when I, when I first pitched

616
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:04,360
you on this idea for the show.

617
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:06,880
The problem is it's too ambitious.

618
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:09,680
It shouldn't be trying to write your application good for you.

619
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:12,400
It should just be a linter on steroids.

620
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:13,800
Sure.

621
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:17,200
So let's take the Python case or let's, you know, I think a more common case, let's take

622
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:19,240
the TypeScript case.

623
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:25,520
You have TS lint, which is a very good TypeScript linter code pilot should augment that and

624
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:28,280
say TS lint says you violated this rule.

625
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:30,620
I looked on the public GitHub repos.

626
00:29:30,620 --> 00:29:34,120
This is how people doing something that looks similar, because I can already do that, right?

627
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:37,760
Tell you code that looks similar to yours have gotten around this.

628
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:42,360
Would you like to accept my solution to satisfying the linter rules?

629
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:44,420
Oh, that's so actually helpful.

630
00:29:44,420 --> 00:29:45,680
That would actually be helpful.

631
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:51,100
And I could see a world where you, GitHub, they do all kinds of crap.

632
00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:52,400
Why not do this?

633
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:58,120
Have different accepted linter style guides and say, you know, all right, the mad botter

634
00:29:58,120 --> 00:30:03,840
is adopting, you know, for Ruby, which is a little looser than Python, right?

635
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:08,440
All these things with the exception of all methods must have parenthesis, right?

636
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:15,320
None of this, you know, my method space parameter stuff, which is true, which is our style guide.

637
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:18,660
And GitHub copilot, you just need to know that.

638
00:30:18,660 --> 00:30:25,040
And anybody who's logged into our GitHub on VS code or whatever, you flag that as an error.

639
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:26,040
Oh, man.

640
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:29,880
See, and that's when you have to work with other vendors or the customer looks at your

641
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:30,880
code.

642
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:33,480
You just look so much more professional when you have one style.

643
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:37,560
Additionally, we're kind of just accepting linters as a fait accompli here.

644
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:42,640
Linters were kind of a new, like not new, new, but they have come a huge way in terms

645
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:44,520
of what they can check for.

646
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:45,520
And way more common.

647
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:46,520
Way more common.

648
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:50,960
If you if you use JetBrains at all, they're built in VS code is always trying to tell

649
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:51,960
you that you suck.

650
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:57,040
So you know what I really like about your idea, your tweak to copilot here is it's also

651
00:30:57,040 --> 00:31:01,560
verifiable if it's doing a good job or not, because you're saying, OK, here's my here's

652
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:02,560
my standard.

653
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:05,120
I want to be you know, I want you to compare me to.

654
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:07,720
And that is, did it meet the standard or not?

655
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:11,080
And is copilot recommending based on the standard?

656
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:15,280
That's really easy to determine success where right now it's so ambiguous.

657
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:16,280
So nebulous.

658
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:18,880
And of course, you could do that with most of these linters anyway, right?

659
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:23,520
They all have configs and, you know, things like Rubocop is the one I use for Ruby.

660
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:24,520
And yeah, I can tell it.

661
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:27,720
Listen, I I hate I forgot the thing I hate.

662
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:32,480
There's a oh, I think it's too strict on the line length thing because I like to write

663
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:37,720
objective C style method names that are like Chris gets up, puts on his robe and ties the

664
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:40,640
sash and make a cup of coffee.

665
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:41,920
That should actually be two methods.

666
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:45,440
Oh, this this must be a good day if I'm tying the sash.

667
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:48,600
Or a really bad day, depending on how you look at it.

668
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:50,280
Why can't GitHub copilot?

669
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:51,280
And I think it can.

670
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:52,280
Right.

671
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:53,280
I think this is a choice to have to make.

672
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:54,280
Be like, all right.

673
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:56,720
I'm the copilot for your organization.

674
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:59,720
Don't worry about any config files in your individual repos.

675
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:02,320
I'm just enforcing this globally.

676
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:03,940
It knows what language you're writing.

677
00:32:03,940 --> 00:32:05,740
It knows what framework you're using.

678
00:32:05,740 --> 00:32:06,740
It knows if you're sleeping.

679
00:32:06,740 --> 00:32:08,000
It knows if you're awake.

680
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:12,920
Yeah, I'd like that in our show docs just for markdown, you know, be be be be tidy that

681
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:14,400
up for us.

682
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:16,920
Huh, clippy at the next level.

683
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:18,560
That would be really great.

684
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:19,560
How did we get to there?

685
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:20,560
I love that.

686
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:23,520
But I think that's oh, because you're talking about remote tooling, remote tooling.

687
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:26,800
That's a great example of tooling that could actually help people that are developing remotely

688
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:29,940
on their own that don't have somebody they can tap the shoulder on.

689
00:32:29,940 --> 00:32:31,840
That's a great that's a great example.

690
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:32,840
I could see it getting there.

691
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:33,840
That doesn't seem impossible.

692
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:38,520
And it actually seems easier than what they're what they seem to be trying to do.

693
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:39,520
Right.

694
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:40,520
Right.

695
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:42,200
I mean, the linters already exist.

696
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:43,260
They're all open source.

697
00:32:43,260 --> 00:32:48,080
You could just and they they usually output to like standard out because you can run them

698
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:49,360
on the command line.

699
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:54,180
So I'm pretty sure you could just intercept those messages like ah, the TSLint actually

700
00:32:54,180 --> 00:32:56,600
has like really good documentation on the error code.

701
00:32:56,600 --> 00:33:00,760
So they could have a simple dictionary of the error codes, look it up and look for code

702
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:01,760
that looks similar.

703
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:05,820
It's all stuff they already do, except for the tying into the linter part.

704
00:33:05,820 --> 00:33:12,360
My benchmark for remote tooling, and if the tooling is comprehensive and complete, is

705
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:19,000
it exactly the same tooling commands and infrastructure when I'm like in Juneau, Alaska?

706
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:22,360
And if I'm in the office at a desk, are we using the same tools?

707
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:24,800
Are we, you know, exact same processes?

708
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:28,840
Then I think, yeah, at a tooling standpoint, everything's even and it's pretty easy to

709
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:29,840
get there today.

710
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:30,840
You just have to pick the right stuff.

711
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:34,840
So, yeah, getting and, you know, in a lot of ways when you're talking about it from

712
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:40,780
the developers perspective, remote work might be the best thing to have happened to them

713
00:33:40,780 --> 00:33:43,160
in the last decade, right?

714
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:45,480
It's so great from a focus standpoint.

715
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:52,060
My home setup is almost, maybe with the exception of once, has always been so much superior

716
00:33:52,060 --> 00:33:53,060
to my work setup.

717
00:33:53,060 --> 00:33:56,920
Because I always, you know, I'm tinkering, I got my chair, I got my desk, I got my screens

718
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:57,920
the way I like them.

719
00:33:57,920 --> 00:34:03,600
I got the machine that's a ridiculous overbuilt performance hound, at least I used to back

720
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:04,600
in my day.

721
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:06,800
But you know what I mean, like you can really build it your way.

722
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:10,520
You can play your music, you can have your environment, your food, you know.

723
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:14,520
You don't have to worry about interruptions, you know, that's why some people like combine

724
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:18,000
working from home with working late too, because then no one's awake, no one's messaging you

725
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:21,200
and the two together really let you get in flow.

726
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:22,200
And that's what it's all about.

727
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:27,400
You all have seen my three 4am Twitter postings when I start my day to do coding before my

728
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:30,200
wonderful Pokemon obsessed son wakes up.

729
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:34,440
Oh, Wes has a good add on for the linters.

730
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:37,180
I can't believe I forgot that language servers.

731
00:34:37,180 --> 00:34:44,320
You can have hardcore IDE level debugging in the command line independently running.

732
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:46,240
Hello, Wes.

733
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:48,560
Welcome to the Coder Radio matrix chat room.

734
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:49,560
Welcome to the matrix.

735
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:51,760
The show has a dedicated chat room on matrix.

736
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:55,720
We'll have well, you can just go to Coder dot show slash matrix and you can join it

737
00:34:55,720 --> 00:35:00,000
while we're live or when we're not either way with the chat is always going for the

738
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,000
show.

739
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,000
We got a dedicated spot.

740
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:05,320
I see somebody added an item to our little bullet point list here.

741
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:08,040
Well, two items, really.

742
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:12,160
I think it's I could have added a third now that I think about it, too.

743
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:17,960
Don't you find it fascinating that over the last decade, unquestionably, Linux and Apple,

744
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:23,760
both in their own ways, have just exponentially grown, but not at the cost of Microsoft?

745
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:24,760
Right.

746
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:28,520
Didn't we early on when this show started, I think we looked at the market as a zero

747
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:31,040
sum game mostly.

748
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:35,480
In reality, there was just plenty of money for all of them to soak up, apparently.

749
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:38,800
And so Apple has become an absolute behemoth.

750
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:41,900
They were barely in the enterprise when we started the show, barely in the enterprise

751
00:35:41,900 --> 00:35:43,680
when we started the show.

752
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:47,600
And now they're a massive player, tons of MacBooks in the workplace.

753
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:50,120
It's very common for developers to have MacBooks now.

754
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:51,120
Super common.

755
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:56,280
Linux, there's Linux in the workplace, Linux on the server, Linux vendors, more developers

756
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:57,460
choosing Linux.

757
00:35:57,460 --> 00:35:58,960
That's been an exponential growth.

758
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:01,560
Linux and half the **** in your house, right?

759
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:03,640
And Microsoft didn't have to go broke for any of it to happen.

760
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:09,640
In fact, Microsoft is more integral to developers outside the Microsoft ecosystem than they

761
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:10,640
ever have been.

762
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:12,960
I was like, Microsoft is weirdly on that Linux badwagon, right?

763
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:17,280
You know, when you talk about Azure, they have the whole Linux IoT platform, too.

764
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:18,280
Yeah, yeah.

765
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:19,760
And they're continuing to update it.

766
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:22,520
Yeah, they sell lots of Linux over there.

767
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:25,480
Yeah, they've got two distros they're making now.

768
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:26,560
They're CBL Mariner Distro.

769
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:31,740
They just recently updated it to make it possible to run on a wider range of hardware.

770
00:36:31,740 --> 00:36:36,080
They're kind of like beginning to build it to run on stuff that's not just Microsoft

771
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:39,720
purpose hardware or virtual machines, which maybe I don't know how far they go with that,

772
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:42,080
but I find that to be fascinating.

773
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:47,440
There's so much going on and that is it's so rich now and you've really had to find

774
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:51,540
your niche, I think, for most people that are at least trying to ride these trends.

775
00:36:51,540 --> 00:36:54,080
People that have just kind of picked their thing and they've been doing it for a decade

776
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:55,080
and still working for them.

777
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:56,080
God bless.

778
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:58,440
But for most people that are trying to ride these trends, like you've really had to kind

779
00:36:58,440 --> 00:37:00,480
of niche down and you've had to go through that.

780
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:04,200
You know, you've kind of had to niche down and you had to find a niche that was complementary

781
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:06,800
to your skill sets and the team you could build.

782
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:10,280
And you know, when we started, you weren't talking about the snake a lot or hosting on

783
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:11,280
Linux.

784
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:14,980
You know, you were really focused more on the consumer side and maybe general and building

785
00:37:14,980 --> 00:37:18,320
tools for developers, perhaps individual developers.

786
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:23,840
Yeah, no, I definitely gone through a religious conversion of I'm a little more extreme than

787
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:24,840
you.

788
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:30,600
I think these front end services are going to not services front end, like maybe a phrase

789
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:33,480
that it's all going to be the web in some form or another.

790
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:34,480
Really?

791
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:35,480
Yeah.

792
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:36,480
Oh my God.

793
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:38,760
This might be, I've been corrupted by just writing lots and lots of business software

794
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:43,480
for the last couple of years, but no one wants to pay for, you know, what I used to call

795
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:48,880
double native and it's probably not worth it for most business cases.

796
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:53,920
Honestly, the thing holding the web back is, is Apple.

797
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:58,200
Apple's just outright refusal to make mobile Safari good.

798
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:05,480
I mean, yep, but ironically, some of the most complicated web apps in existence are shipping

799
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:07,640
as iOS apps in the app store.

800
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:09,800
I just shipped one for somebody.

801
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:10,800
Yeah.

802
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:11,800
Yeah.

803
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:13,980
So there's, it is happening.

804
00:38:13,980 --> 00:38:18,320
So like because of that, those pieces are that groundwork, that skill set, all of that

805
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:23,480
is getting laid, even though it might be shipping as an iOS quote unquote native app, the tooling,

806
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:24,880
all of that.

807
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:25,880
I think you're right.

808
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:27,680
And here's what I think too.

809
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:32,480
I think historically things revert to the mean, you know, like the web is the mean,

810
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:35,840
the web is the standard general platform.

811
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:39,860
That's why the web's running on Linux servers because that's another general standard tech

812
00:38:39,860 --> 00:38:41,140
platform.

813
00:38:41,140 --> 00:38:47,540
And inevitably, inevitably you just, you just give up, you concede and you just use the

814
00:38:47,540 --> 00:38:48,880
general tech platform.

815
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:50,800
It's just the way it goes.

816
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:54,320
Even if you package that up as an app, it's still going to be using web technologies on

817
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:55,320
the backend.

818
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:59,640
And you, and you look at some of the biggest fricking iOS apps out there, some of the top

819
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:06,160
apps on the iOS app store, they can reconfigure parts of that UI on the backend like nobody's

820
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:08,120
business because it's all web rendering.

821
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:13,440
We talked about a Ionix new offering for that last week, the same exact idea.

822
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:17,520
You can reconfigure and even call capacitor plugins as long as the plugins already in

823
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:21,480
your bundle, right, without updating the actual app.

824
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:25,480
You know, there is a, there is kind of a little bit of disappointment here though.

825
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:28,840
I would have bet a few years ago that web assembly would be a much bigger part of our

826
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:29,840
day-to-day lives.

827
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:30,840
Yeah.

828
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:31,840
Yeah.

829
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:33,080
And that just didn't happen again.

830
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:40,200
And I think because of Apple, maybe because if it doesn't work on iOS, well, damn.

831
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:41,720
It's kind of why start the project.

832
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:43,640
It's kind of a non-start, especially in the States.

833
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:50,640
I know some of our European audience who we tenderly love is another way to put that.

834
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:54,520
I believe yesterday or it must have been Friday, I saw a headline that iOS user market share

835
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:56,000
has actually just surpassed Android.

836
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,000
Did you see that?

837
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,000
Is that possible?

838
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,000
I just believe I saw that.

839
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,000
I find that incredibly hard to believe.

840
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,000
In the US maybe.

841
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,000
Maybe.

842
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,000
Yeah.

843
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,000
I'll double check it.

844
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:08,360
But my point is, if you had an existing platform, an existing application and iOS came along

845
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:11,640
and it didn't support iOS, that didn't wreck your world.

846
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:17,120
But today in 2022, a project is a non-starter if it's not going to support iOS.

847
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:18,120
Yeah.

848
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:19,120
Android.

849
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:24,000
Let's just say a lot of devs don't do a whole lot of testing on Android Chrome because it's

850
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:27,540
basically Chrome, right?

851
00:40:27,540 --> 00:40:28,880
Just we're on iOS.

852
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:31,720
Have you seen the leaks that came out this morning?

853
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:35,760
Definitely definitely definitely not from Apple PR shutting down expectations for the

854
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:37,880
iPhone announcement tomorrow.

855
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:38,880
You called this.

856
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:39,880
I think you might be right.

857
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:42,360
Ironically, elephant in the room again.

858
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:43,360
Several of them.

859
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:44,520
Get them out of here.

860
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:45,580
Several elephants.

861
00:40:45,580 --> 00:40:47,520
This is coming out on the day of the Apple event.

862
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:48,520
Yeah.

863
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:50,160
So tomorrow it's Monday now for us.

864
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:52,440
So today for you, I guess.

865
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:53,440
Yeah.

866
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:54,560
And so maybe we'll be wrong, but you're right.

867
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:58,840
The leaks seem to suggest smaller notch is the big new feature.

868
00:40:58,840 --> 00:40:59,840
Smaller notch.

869
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:00,840
Maybe a slightly better camera.

870
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:01,840
Yeah, of course.

871
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:02,840
Yeah.

872
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:05,520
And if you're like me and dropped your iPhone and you don't want to pay the repair, you

873
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:06,520
might get one anyway.

874
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:07,700
Although I'm running at 12.

875
00:41:07,700 --> 00:41:12,920
So for me, there probably is more change right in terms of processor and all that.

876
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:13,920
Yeah.

877
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:15,760
Oh, actually, it might be worth an upgrade for you.

878
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:16,760
Yeah.

879
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:20,760
So it's who who could have leaked something like that?

880
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:24,240
Who could the source who could have known be?

881
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:27,320
That Mark Gurman sure seems to have the right phone number.

882
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:28,320
Sure does.

883
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:29,320
That source is.

884
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:32,120
And it sure seems to never get caught by Apple somehow.

885
00:41:32,120 --> 00:41:33,120
Sure is strange.

886
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:34,120
It's weird.

887
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:35,120
It's weird.

888
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:40,760
But Apple's iPhone overtakes Android with more than half of the U.S. market share.

889
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:43,200
I believe that there are no more iPhones in the U.S.

890
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:47,960
Well, and if you've ever like sat in a pub, you'll know that Samsung is betting all in

891
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:53,480
on folding phones, which oh, my God, they're like fourteen hundred dollars to they're really

892
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:54,480
expensive.

893
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:55,480
It seems ridiculous.

894
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:56,480
I don't.

895
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:57,480
Yeah.

896
00:41:57,480 --> 00:42:02,040
And the thing is, the headline isn't Apple's iPhone 13 overtakes Android.

897
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:03,500
It's all iPhones.

898
00:42:03,500 --> 00:42:06,400
And Apple loves selling old iPhones.

899
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:07,400
And what is that?

900
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:08,720
The iPhone or whatever, the real cheap one.

901
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:11,000
I got one for for my grandma.

902
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,720
Still a solid phone.

903
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:13,720
She loves it.

904
00:42:13,720 --> 00:42:14,720
It comes in cute colors.

905
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:15,720
I mean, why not?

906
00:42:15,720 --> 00:42:16,720
Yeah, it's a good size.

907
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:17,720
It's got decent battery life.

908
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:19,840
You know, it's a decent it's a decent deal.

909
00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:20,840
She's happy.

910
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:24,680
Got her that in a in a past gen iPad, Benny.

911
00:42:24,680 --> 00:42:27,800
She loves it.

912
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:30,260
Tailscale dot com slash coder.

913
00:42:30,260 --> 00:42:32,760
Go there to get a free personal account for up to 20 devices.

914
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:35,880
And of course, you support the show if here's what's up.

915
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:39,040
This is just a little bit of talk between you and me.

916
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:41,600
I don't want don't share this to anybody else, but I just want to have a private moment

917
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:42,840
with you.

918
00:42:42,840 --> 00:42:49,000
If you do nothing else today but install tailscale, you can call today because that that's going

919
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,120
to set you up forever.

920
00:42:51,120 --> 00:42:54,000
Like tomorrow's work is a little bit easier.

921
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
I love tailscale.

922
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,700
It's so quick to get going to select after like two minutes.

923
00:42:58,700 --> 00:43:02,000
You're done for the day, you know, because I'm giving you permission to take the rest

924
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:05,340
of the day off when you go to tailscale dot com slash coder.

925
00:43:05,340 --> 00:43:11,920
You're going to set up a zero config mesh VPN in just a couple of minutes that manages

926
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:16,680
firewall rules, takes care of that dreaded carrier double net situation some of us find

927
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:23,000
ourselves in, and it connects all your devices directly to each other using WireGuard's noise

928
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:24,000
protocol.

929
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:25,340
The good stuff.

930
00:43:25,340 --> 00:43:29,320
This is the stuff that we hoped we'd see hit the market once WireGuard became a thing.

931
00:43:29,320 --> 00:43:34,000
When it was a twinkle in our eyes, you can quickly and easily create a secure network

932
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:38,360
between your servers, your computers, your virtual machines, your cloud instances.

933
00:43:38,360 --> 00:43:40,920
I even have it as an add on to home assistant.

934
00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:43,640
It's just so wonderful.

935
00:43:43,640 --> 00:43:45,300
And then additionally, you can share with people.

936
00:43:45,300 --> 00:43:49,340
You can set up ACLs that supports DNS if you want to put a DNS server in there.

937
00:43:49,340 --> 00:43:55,580
For me, the real fundamental shift in my game was when I realized all these various devices

938
00:43:55,580 --> 00:44:01,480
like at the studio, at home, my kids' computers, my VM machines I'm working on for projects,

939
00:44:01,480 --> 00:44:07,940
my VPSs, they all now have a static IP on this mesh network.

940
00:44:07,940 --> 00:44:12,520
So then I started realizing, well, I'll just connect to that IP all the time.

941
00:44:12,520 --> 00:44:14,640
And it has changed the way I do networking.

942
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:17,120
No more inbound firewall rules, gone.

943
00:44:17,120 --> 00:44:20,520
I don't have to worry about any of that stuff anymore.

944
00:44:20,520 --> 00:44:23,860
Now my bookmarks for like the web apps and services that I use that I run on different

945
00:44:23,860 --> 00:44:26,940
servers and stuff, they're all using the tail scale IP.

946
00:44:26,940 --> 00:44:28,160
So it's the same bookmark.

947
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:32,920
It's the same IP when I'm at home, when I'm at the studio, when I'm over at the kid's

948
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:36,280
house, it is the same everywhere.

949
00:44:36,280 --> 00:44:40,260
You guys, when we got to that point and then I started doing sharing with different members

950
00:44:40,260 --> 00:44:45,880
of the JB team and we really just, we have built our own little private internet and

951
00:44:45,880 --> 00:44:47,860
it's been so easy with tail scale.

952
00:44:47,860 --> 00:44:52,520
And now tail scale has tail scale SSH, which just makes managing your SSH connections even

953
00:44:52,520 --> 00:44:54,080
easier.

954
00:44:54,080 --> 00:44:55,680
Keep connected with tail scale.

955
00:44:55,680 --> 00:44:56,680
It'll change your game.

956
00:44:56,680 --> 00:45:02,720
It's on the level of like file sync and the types of technologies, you know, collaborative

957
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:05,280
editing chat.

958
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:09,960
Like it's just a fundamental tool now, a fundamental tool and it couldn't be built better.

959
00:45:09,960 --> 00:45:15,580
It's a great app, a great team, and you can try it for free for up to 20 devices and support

960
00:45:15,580 --> 00:45:19,240
the show when you go to tailscale.com slash coder.

961
00:45:19,240 --> 00:45:21,600
It just doesn't get any better than that.

962
00:45:21,600 --> 00:45:23,280
I'm thrilled to tell you about tail scale.

963
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:29,960
Go try it out, tailscale.com slash coder.

964
00:45:29,960 --> 00:45:33,720
Well speaking of Apple, you ready to get yourself an Xcode cloud subscription.

965
00:45:33,720 --> 00:45:37,840
They're now generally available for developers after launching in beta in June.

966
00:45:37,840 --> 00:45:38,840
I am not.

967
00:45:38,840 --> 00:45:39,840
No.

968
00:45:39,840 --> 00:45:44,480
But Mike, this is a whole category of people that have to have access to Apple's platform

969
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:46,040
that they could monetize.

970
00:45:46,040 --> 00:45:47,040
No.

971
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:52,160
Here's a little bit of the details.

972
00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:56,440
It's like 15 bucks a month for the base plan.

973
00:45:56,440 --> 00:46:00,920
Subscriptions can be like more expensive if you want to add more compute hours.

974
00:46:00,920 --> 00:46:06,640
So 15 bucks a month gets you 25 compute hours, which is, you know, you know what that means.

975
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:11,360
However long you use some of the back end, you can get 100 compute hours for 50 bucks,

976
00:46:11,360 --> 00:46:18,360
150 compute hours for 100 bucks a month and a thousand compute hours for 400 a month.

977
00:46:18,360 --> 00:46:23,680
You can configure Xflow to upload and build in the cloud and Apple is going to offer 25

978
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:28,360
compute hours per month at no cost until the end of 2023 so you can try it out and get

979
00:46:28,360 --> 00:46:29,360
real hooked.

980
00:46:29,360 --> 00:46:33,200
You know, so you can now you can build on your MacBook Air and upload it to Apple.

981
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:36,240
This has really got to be about getting things ready for Xcode on iOS.

982
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:38,160
Nah, I don't think so.

983
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:39,160
No?

984
00:46:39,160 --> 00:46:42,560
Wouldn't you think in order to have a really complete iPad development experience where

985
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:45,960
you can build applications for Apple's various platforms, you're not going to want to build

986
00:46:45,960 --> 00:46:46,960
all that on an iPad?

987
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:47,960
I mean, you could.

988
00:46:47,960 --> 00:46:52,640
But wouldn't you just, you know, you do everything on the iPad and you upload it to Xcode cloud

989
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:55,160
and let it build and deploy to the App Store?

990
00:46:55,160 --> 00:46:59,800
I think to make the development experience on iPad good, this is not like the most pressing

991
00:46:59,800 --> 00:47:01,320
issue.

992
00:47:01,320 --> 00:47:06,920
For instance, you'd have to fix multitasking on iPad, which I don't know how they would

993
00:47:06,920 --> 00:47:07,920
do.

994
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:08,920
Yeah.

995
00:47:08,920 --> 00:47:09,920
Yeah.

996
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:13,760
So, you know, I actually think this is for the enterprise because, you know, code signing

997
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:14,760
is a pain in the butt.

998
00:47:14,760 --> 00:47:18,880
And I can imagine lots of organizations that like hire a contractor, the contractor gets

999
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:21,240
in a dispute, quits, gets fired, whatever.

1000
00:47:21,240 --> 00:47:25,620
And oh, he had all the private keys for all of our iOS stuff and our push notifications

1001
00:47:25,620 --> 00:47:26,880
and whatever.

1002
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:29,320
We need to now regenerate everything and revoke all the keys.

1003
00:47:29,320 --> 00:47:32,360
It's a huge hassle, huge pain in the butt.

1004
00:47:32,360 --> 00:47:36,560
I've had people ask me to do it for them many times when they've either had a nasty breakup

1005
00:47:36,560 --> 00:47:38,760
with a vendor or whatever.

1006
00:47:38,760 --> 00:47:42,320
In a lot of ways, this is almost like a Jenkins for our Xcode.

1007
00:47:42,320 --> 00:47:47,280
Wouldn't it in theory allow an enterprise to deploy cheaper Macs as well with lower

1008
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:48,280
end hardware?

1009
00:47:48,280 --> 00:47:50,360
You know, just something enough to run Xcode.

1010
00:47:50,360 --> 00:47:54,520
Yeah, but the MacBook Airs are damn powerful now and they're not that expensive.

1011
00:47:54,520 --> 00:47:55,520
Today.

1012
00:47:55,520 --> 00:47:56,520
Right.

1013
00:47:56,520 --> 00:47:59,560
Well, the 20% Tim Cook markup could happen, I guess.

1014
00:47:59,560 --> 00:48:02,880
No, I just, you know, you take this thing out a few years, I could see it.

1015
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:06,280
I think where this would really take things to the next level is if it let you develop

1016
00:48:06,280 --> 00:48:08,000
on other platforms other than Mac OS.

1017
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:09,000
They will never do that.

1018
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:10,000
Never.

1019
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:11,000
Never.

1020
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:13,800
I would pay for it if they did that.

1021
00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:14,800
Yeah.

1022
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:15,800
Right?

1023
00:48:15,800 --> 00:48:21,280
I mean, the truth is if you're a medium sized business enterprise, it's just better to buy

1024
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:27,960
a Mac mini, put it in a closet somewhere and centralize all your code signing that way.

1025
00:48:27,960 --> 00:48:30,280
And you spend what?

1026
00:48:30,280 --> 00:48:35,760
If you really want to go balls to the walls, you spend what 2100, 2200 once.

1027
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:36,940
Take the write off, right?

1028
00:48:36,940 --> 00:48:38,400
And then you throw it in the closet.

1029
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:41,600
I have a very sad Mac mini for that reason.

1030
00:48:41,600 --> 00:48:45,920
Although my goddamn MacBook Air is faster than it, which now is a MacBook Pro 16 inch,

1031
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:52,520
but all right, so I guess they're not getting a subscription out of you.

1032
00:48:52,520 --> 00:48:56,080
No, you know, I mean, there are things they could add to it, right?

1033
00:48:56,080 --> 00:49:00,900
Like there used to be, I forgot the name of the service, but where they would actually

1034
00:49:00,900 --> 00:49:06,240
test it on different devices and form factors and send you back the screenshots of an automated

1035
00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:12,680
like Selenium script running and touching different touch points that would be of value.

1036
00:49:12,680 --> 00:49:16,880
But again, this is kind of a product of their own success.

1037
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:19,980
Xcode doesn't suck as much as it used to.

1038
00:49:19,980 --> 00:49:25,120
And you could basically do this locally with, well, Selenium, which, but to be clear, the

1039
00:49:25,120 --> 00:49:28,440
thing I just described does not appear to be a service they're offering, right?

1040
00:49:28,440 --> 00:49:33,040
This really does look like running your Xcode tests, making a build, handling distribution

1041
00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:36,480
in the Xcode Cloud.

1042
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:38,840
All right, well, let's round out the show with a few boosts.

1043
00:49:38,840 --> 00:49:44,360
We got 2000 stats from Nev who boosted into the show a reliable booster.

1044
00:49:44,360 --> 00:49:49,520
He says, Chris, I've been living the UbiForm lifestyle, the uniform lifestyle for 10 years

1045
00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:50,520
now.

1046
00:49:50,520 --> 00:49:52,440
It's just a plain white t-shirt and jeans.

1047
00:49:52,440 --> 00:49:57,440
My biggest recommendation is that you have a few optional clothes like maybe a basic

1048
00:49:57,440 --> 00:50:02,040
pair of khakis, maybe a few polo shirts, because every now and then you'll want to switch it

1049
00:50:02,040 --> 00:50:03,040
up.

1050
00:50:03,040 --> 00:50:05,080
But honestly, it's been fine.

1051
00:50:05,080 --> 00:50:09,660
It's one less decision I have to make in the morning other than, is it a pants or is it

1052
00:50:09,660 --> 00:50:11,520
a pajamas day?

1053
00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:16,120
Okay, I'm kind of really liking this idea, and I'm not sure if I can tackle it right

1054
00:50:16,120 --> 00:50:21,160
now because you would not believe the chore list I have to get ready for the...

1055
00:50:21,160 --> 00:50:24,680
It's one of these things where getting ready for the road trip, three or four things go

1056
00:50:24,680 --> 00:50:28,280
on the chore list every day and maybe one thing comes off.

1057
00:50:28,280 --> 00:50:30,600
So it's pretty stressful at the moment.

1058
00:50:30,600 --> 00:50:36,880
So I don't think I want to take on redoing my whole wardrobe, but I am really liking

1059
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:38,580
this uniform idea.

1060
00:50:38,580 --> 00:50:41,640
So I'm going to touch on this.

1061
00:50:41,640 --> 00:50:46,600
If I come up with something that's like with JB branded, I may just make it available for

1062
00:50:46,600 --> 00:50:47,800
those of you who want to try it too.

1063
00:50:47,800 --> 00:50:53,680
I'm sure it'll get a total of four sales, but I might try it because I like...

1064
00:50:53,680 --> 00:50:58,800
I mean, I was thinking about, I don't like wearing other people's logos.

1065
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:03,280
Like I'm going to go to the meetup, I should be wearing JB swag, but I don't know.

1066
00:51:03,280 --> 00:51:07,400
All my swag either doesn't fit or it's too small, because I've gotten fat or it's faded.

1067
00:51:07,400 --> 00:51:08,960
The stuff that does fit, it's faded too.

1068
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:09,960
It's all old.

1069
00:51:09,960 --> 00:51:13,760
Yeah, you should totally wear JB stuff to the shows.

1070
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:15,200
This is one more thing to add to my list.

1071
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:17,320
He's making a list.

1072
00:51:17,320 --> 00:51:18,400
All right.

1073
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:23,200
Next boost came in from WM2222sats, a row of ducks.

1074
00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:25,560
He says, thanks for your thoughts.

1075
00:51:25,560 --> 00:51:29,640
He boosted in last week, mentioned that he was on the spectrum and having some challenges

1076
00:51:29,640 --> 00:51:31,560
with his workers and kind of feeling left out.

1077
00:51:31,560 --> 00:51:35,020
He says, I think I needed to hear what you guys said, especially the part about it just

1078
00:51:35,020 --> 00:51:36,120
being work.

1079
00:51:36,120 --> 00:51:38,560
I don't have to be friends with any of my coworkers.

1080
00:51:38,560 --> 00:51:42,480
I guess I just had a lot of unrealistic expectations going in.

1081
00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:45,360
I would add that my last message didn't really paint a clear picture.

1082
00:51:45,360 --> 00:51:48,680
There was somewhat some hostile things I had to deal with, but I think I'm just going to

1083
00:51:48,680 --> 00:51:51,480
avoid putting too much into this semi-public forum.

1084
00:51:51,480 --> 00:51:53,040
He says, you don't have to read this on air.

1085
00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:54,280
I just wanted to thank you all.

1086
00:51:54,280 --> 00:51:57,000
But I wanted to read it on air because I think it was an interesting reflection that you

1087
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:58,000
made WM.

1088
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:01,320
And I would say, don't write them off either.

1089
00:52:01,320 --> 00:52:07,280
You have friends and you have acquaintances and both are valuable.

1090
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:12,800
And a work acquaintance is a lot like a friend, but sometimes when you stop working there,

1091
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:15,020
that relationship kind of fades away.

1092
00:52:15,020 --> 00:52:18,580
But while you're there, it's a good, healthy social dynamic that's productive.

1093
00:52:18,580 --> 00:52:21,600
So build acquaintances is what I would say.

1094
00:52:21,600 --> 00:52:25,100
And then if they turn into friendships, that just happens organically.

1095
00:52:25,100 --> 00:52:28,400
But if they don't, that's fine.

1096
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:30,120
You know, you just get your work done.

1097
00:52:30,120 --> 00:52:31,940
Everybody's there to get paid.

1098
00:52:31,940 --> 00:52:35,680
So we had somebody boost in from Castamatic with no name, but I wanted to read this boost

1099
00:52:35,680 --> 00:52:36,800
on the air.

1100
00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:40,480
They sent in 5,000 sats.

1101
00:52:40,480 --> 00:52:42,760
They call these things wardrobe capsules.

1102
00:52:42,760 --> 00:52:47,200
It's a stupid name, but I've been living the hashtag uniform lifestyle for a few years.

1103
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:48,520
It's hecking great.

1104
00:52:48,520 --> 00:52:54,000
If the haters lean into it, all right, I'm feeling good about that.

1105
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:55,680
I'm going to do it, dude.

1106
00:52:55,680 --> 00:52:57,280
I'm doing it.

1107
00:52:57,280 --> 00:52:58,280
I'm doing it.

1108
00:52:58,280 --> 00:52:59,360
I'm going uniform style.

1109
00:52:59,360 --> 00:53:02,120
If you if you want to join me, you're welcome, but I'm going.

1110
00:53:02,120 --> 00:53:11,040
I recommend a nice pair of black, incredibly tight slacks and a gold long sleeve shirt.

1111
00:53:11,040 --> 00:53:14,340
You got to have a couple of pips on the one chest, right?

1112
00:53:14,340 --> 00:53:16,160
Maybe some sort of triangle logo.

1113
00:53:16,160 --> 00:53:19,200
All right, and just walk around in that every day.

1114
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:22,280
You know, I hear those fabrics are designed for comfort, so that should be great.

1115
00:53:22,280 --> 00:53:26,240
Well, you got to have your iPhone out and sound like you're scanning everything.

1116
00:53:26,240 --> 00:53:28,400
Maybe have the AR mode on.

1117
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:33,400
I have this app called Science Scanner or Sci Scanner, which is just a it's a knockoff

1118
00:53:33,400 --> 00:53:37,000
tricorder, but they can't call it a tricorder because they get sued and they can't use the

1119
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:41,720
tricorder sounds, unfortunately, but it still looks like a tricorder.

1120
00:53:41,720 --> 00:53:46,320
I hate to admit that I have gone to a Ren Faire and done the Star Trek lost thing.

1121
00:53:46,320 --> 00:53:47,320
Yes.

1122
00:53:47,320 --> 00:53:48,320
Yes.

1123
00:53:48,320 --> 00:53:49,320
Yeah, it's terrible.

1124
00:53:49,320 --> 00:53:56,920
Johnny is our big booster this week with 10000 sats.

1125
00:53:56,920 --> 00:54:00,240
After listening to last week's episode or whichever it was, when we talked about Google

1126
00:54:00,240 --> 00:54:06,440
reporting that dad for taking pictures of his son for telemedicine, he says, Goodbye,

1127
00:54:06,440 --> 00:54:07,600
Google.

1128
00:54:07,600 --> 00:54:13,400
And I got to tell you, Mike, I'm still thinking about that story every day.

1129
00:54:13,400 --> 00:54:14,840
You're haunted.

1130
00:54:14,840 --> 00:54:18,360
Last night, Wes and I were like, you know, we were talking about, is it time for me to

1131
00:54:18,360 --> 00:54:21,720
get a new Android device and kind of get an updated experience with Android?

1132
00:54:21,720 --> 00:54:24,840
Because it's been since the pixel three and maybe I'm getting a little out of date.

1133
00:54:24,840 --> 00:54:25,840
Yeah, yada, yada, yada.

1134
00:54:25,840 --> 00:54:26,840
And I start looking at it.

1135
00:54:26,840 --> 00:54:28,880
You know, the price seems kind of fair.

1136
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:29,880
And then I think.

1137
00:54:29,880 --> 00:54:35,020
No, you know what, I'm not going to get any more ties to this company like that line's

1138
00:54:35,020 --> 00:54:36,020
been crossed.

1139
00:54:36,020 --> 00:54:37,020
I'm done.

1140
00:54:37,020 --> 00:54:40,800
And I'm going to take my photos off of Google.

1141
00:54:40,800 --> 00:54:46,480
I have not been using Google Maps for a while that also I sort of crossed that line last

1142
00:54:46,480 --> 00:54:47,880
summer.

1143
00:54:47,880 --> 00:54:51,440
And I think that story was it.

1144
00:54:51,440 --> 00:54:56,480
It's not like it's I'm not freaking out, but I in my mind.

1145
00:54:56,480 --> 00:55:01,520
Google is now kind of like a hostile territory, like they're not actively hostile, but it's

1146
00:55:01,520 --> 00:55:04,920
like I've walked into a bad neighborhood and I need to be really careful and I probably

1147
00:55:04,920 --> 00:55:08,880
need to just maybe move my assets out of that neighborhood.

1148
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:09,980
And it's really stuck with me.

1149
00:55:09,980 --> 00:55:12,360
It's not it has not faded since we've talked about that story.

1150
00:55:12,360 --> 00:55:15,960
I'm I'm really disturbed by what Google did.

1151
00:55:15,960 --> 00:55:19,920
So there's that, I guess.

1152
00:55:19,920 --> 00:55:20,920
Sometimes maybe that's a good thing.

1153
00:55:20,920 --> 00:55:25,280
Maybe that was the that was the story I needed to hear to kind of make it stick.

1154
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:26,280
Perhaps we'll see.

1155
00:55:26,280 --> 00:55:29,080
It's so damn hard.

1156
00:55:29,080 --> 00:55:30,080
Like Google search.

1157
00:55:30,080 --> 00:55:31,080
I don't know if I can stop using that.

1158
00:55:31,080 --> 00:55:33,260
I don't find any other stuff is good.

1159
00:55:33,260 --> 00:55:38,480
Gmail find that to be the best Google apps for business.

1160
00:55:38,480 --> 00:55:39,480
Also good.

1161
00:55:39,480 --> 00:55:40,620
Although I don't really care so much about that.

1162
00:55:40,620 --> 00:55:42,360
It's more about my personal stuff.

1163
00:55:42,360 --> 00:55:45,440
DPG comes in with our last boost of the week that's going on air.

1164
00:55:45,440 --> 00:55:47,180
But thank you, everyone who boosted.

1165
00:55:47,180 --> 00:55:49,200
They all get read.

1166
00:55:49,200 --> 00:55:50,800
Sometimes I'll read extra ones that don't make into the show.

1167
00:55:50,800 --> 00:55:53,480
I'll read them in the live stream.

1168
00:55:53,480 --> 00:55:54,640
So your support is appreciated.

1169
00:55:54,640 --> 00:55:58,120
And DPG comes in with eight thousand eighty five sats.

1170
00:55:58,120 --> 00:55:59,120
B-O-O-S-T.

1171
00:55:59,120 --> 00:56:04,080
He says in honor of the new Ryzen processors, I thought this amount was appropriate.

1172
00:56:04,080 --> 00:56:05,840
Love the show.

1173
00:56:05,840 --> 00:56:08,160
The new Ryzen's look so great.

1174
00:56:08,160 --> 00:56:09,160
Yeah.

1175
00:56:09,160 --> 00:56:10,160
Yeah.

1176
00:56:10,160 --> 00:56:12,320
I hope I hope to have more on that in the future.

1177
00:56:12,320 --> 00:56:15,640
I'm feeling like it is time for a new machine.

1178
00:56:15,640 --> 00:56:20,360
I wanted to get a new desktop before the pandemic and then the supply chain went crazy and I

1179
00:56:20,360 --> 00:56:21,360
thought I can wait.

1180
00:56:21,360 --> 00:56:23,040
And now I'm really itching.

1181
00:56:23,040 --> 00:56:24,040
I like Bill.

1182
00:56:24,040 --> 00:56:26,560
I have built up momentum.

1183
00:56:26,560 --> 00:56:28,040
Also just a shout out to Golden Dragon.

1184
00:56:28,040 --> 00:56:31,480
He said, hey, guys, just 19 shows until episode five hundred.

1185
00:56:31,480 --> 00:56:32,480
Keep up the great work.

1186
00:56:32,480 --> 00:56:37,000
We got seventeen oh one sats, an enterprise boost from user seventy nine one.

1187
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:38,600
He just wanted to boost some joy in.

1188
00:56:38,600 --> 00:56:40,320
He says, please keep the broadcast coming.

1189
00:56:40,320 --> 00:56:45,000
And we got two hundred and twenty two sats from oh a guy one who said, you know what?

1190
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:47,440
Keep the advertising pitches in from time to time.

1191
00:56:47,440 --> 00:56:53,040
I didn't grab any this week, but every now and then, sparingly, I'll throw a advertising

1192
00:56:53,040 --> 00:56:54,880
pitch email in that we get.

1193
00:56:54,880 --> 00:56:59,920
We have had weeks where we have got more of those pitches than we've actually got an email

1194
00:56:59,920 --> 00:57:00,920
from the audience.

1195
00:57:00,920 --> 00:57:01,920
Yeah.

1196
00:57:01,920 --> 00:57:02,920
Yeah.

1197
00:57:02,920 --> 00:57:03,920
It's usually.

1198
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:06,480
Isn't like the end of the quarter, we usually get hammered.

1199
00:57:06,480 --> 00:57:11,320
Yeah, that's got to be it is they got to figure maybe you're getting ready for the next quarter

1200
00:57:11,320 --> 00:57:14,960
and you're going to take anything, you know, you'll just and that does happen.

1201
00:57:14,960 --> 00:57:18,760
You know, that is the thing is there's and I was just listening to Strattick.

1202
00:57:18,760 --> 00:57:24,660
I don't know if you follow Ben Thompson still, but he interviewed the former CEO of Anchor,

1203
00:57:24,660 --> 00:57:29,960
the podcasting platform that Spotify bought, and it will send chills down your spine.

1204
00:57:29,960 --> 00:57:34,720
They have figured out that their path to making a lot of money is to monetize the hell out

1205
00:57:34,720 --> 00:57:39,100
of little podcasts, you know, podcasts with a few hundred downloads, a few thousand downloads

1206
00:57:39,100 --> 00:57:42,000
and just ram them up with dynamic ads and stuff.

1207
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:43,900
So but like aggregate aggregate.

1208
00:57:43,900 --> 00:57:47,800
So they'll go to what they'll they'll sell like ten thousand downloads, but they'll do

1209
00:57:47,800 --> 00:57:50,760
it by running it across, you know, a thousand shows.

1210
00:57:50,760 --> 00:57:52,620
That's super sneaky.

1211
00:57:52,620 --> 00:57:56,060
And the only way they can do it is by you have to be on their platform.

1212
00:57:56,060 --> 00:57:58,360
They have to be able to dynamically reencode your file.

1213
00:57:58,360 --> 00:58:01,600
They have to be able to have to do it in their player so they can track everything that the

1214
00:58:01,600 --> 00:58:03,280
player is doing.

1215
00:58:03,280 --> 00:58:06,400
And the thing is, is they're coming to podcasters who are struggling and they're just saying,

1216
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:07,400
here's a check.

1217
00:58:07,400 --> 00:58:08,400
Come on our platform.

1218
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:11,320
Well, you can work with one of our consultants to migrate over to our platform.

1219
00:58:11,320 --> 00:58:13,560
Would you like to schedule a call?

1220
00:58:13,560 --> 00:58:18,160
And they're going to basically YouTube up Spotify is going to YouTube up podcasting.

1221
00:58:18,160 --> 00:58:19,280
That's why we do the boost, right?

1222
00:58:19,280 --> 00:58:21,080
So anyways, go get a new podcast app.

1223
00:58:21,080 --> 00:58:23,340
Let's keep this thing decentralized new podcast apps dot com.

1224
00:58:23,340 --> 00:58:26,340
Let's not let let's not let's not watch that go this direction.

1225
00:58:26,340 --> 00:58:30,300
My God, let's not watch another thing go this direction, please.

1226
00:58:30,300 --> 00:58:32,320
Also big thank you to our members who make that possible.

1227
00:58:32,320 --> 00:58:35,800
You guys are playing a huge role in letting us be picky, choosing the sponsors we work

1228
00:58:35,800 --> 00:58:36,800
with.

1229
00:58:36,800 --> 00:58:40,080
I genuinely love working with Linode and Talescale.

1230
00:58:40,080 --> 00:58:43,240
Use the hell out of them every single day, right?

1231
00:58:43,240 --> 00:58:45,560
That doesn't just accidentally happen.

1232
00:58:45,560 --> 00:58:49,680
It's because we had the runway, the opportunity to work with those folks.

1233
00:58:49,680 --> 00:58:52,520
So thank you, everybody over there, Coder QA dot co.

1234
00:58:52,520 --> 00:58:54,680
Go listen to the Coderly and our Matrix room.

1235
00:58:54,680 --> 00:58:56,200
Everybody hanging out in our new Matrix chat.

And that might be good on the road trip.

1239
00:59:01,840 --> 00:59:02,840
You know, you never know.

1240
00:59:02,840 --> 00:59:03,920
There might be updates in there.

And of course, you can watch the show on Monday's nine a.m. Pacific noon Eastern over at J.B.

Live dot TV or Jupiter to Mr. Dominic.

1243
00:59:13,600 --> 00:59:14,600
Where should we send folks?

1244
00:59:14,600 --> 00:59:16,720
Give them some wisdom, some resources.

1245
00:59:16,720 --> 00:59:17,720
Well, sure.

1246
00:59:17,720 --> 00:59:22,960
So wisdom never tap out before your attacks that always play stuff in your second main

1247
00:59:22,960 --> 00:59:24,240
face.

1248
00:59:24,240 --> 00:59:25,920
There's your wisdom.

You'll get coding magic and my October fest.

1251
00:59:32,720 --> 00:59:33,720
Sell it brought.

1252
00:59:33,720 --> 00:59:34,720
So you I knew you.

1253
00:59:34,720 --> 00:59:35,720
Yes.

1254
00:59:35,720 --> 00:59:37,920
I knew I did.

1255
00:59:37,920 --> 00:59:40,080
This is my favorite time of year for cooking with beer.

1256
00:59:40,080 --> 00:59:43,600
So it looks so good.

1257
00:59:43,600 --> 00:59:47,680
Wes and I were actually working on some studio stuff and we hadn't just eaten some fried

1258
00:59:47,680 --> 00:59:48,680
tip.

1259
00:59:48,680 --> 00:59:49,680
I think we would have had to cook up some brats.

1260
00:59:49,680 --> 00:59:50,800
We love the beer.

1261
00:59:50,800 --> 00:59:51,800
Beer soaked brats.

1262
00:59:51,800 --> 00:59:52,800
It's came out good.

1263
00:59:52,800 --> 00:59:53,800
Yeah.

1264
00:59:53,800 --> 00:59:54,800
Yeah, I bet.

1265
00:59:54,800 --> 00:59:55,800
