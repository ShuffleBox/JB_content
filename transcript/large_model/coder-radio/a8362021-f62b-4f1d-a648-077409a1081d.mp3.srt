00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
This is KOTOR Radio, episode 436 for October 18th, 2021.

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Hey, good luck and welcome into Jupiter Broadcasting's weekly talk show, taking a pragmatic look

3
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
at the art and the business of software development and the world of technology.

4
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
This here episode is brought to you by a cloud guru.

5
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:32,000
You know, they have that cloud playground, Azure, AWS and Google Cloud sandboxes on ACG's credit card, not yours.

6
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Get certified, get hired, get learning at a cloud guru dot com.

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:42,000
My name is Chris and joining us with credit card in hand, ready to pounce, it is our host, Mr. Dominic.

8
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Hello, Mike.

9
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Hello, Mr. Fisher.

10
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Hello, sir.

11
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Full disclosure, you and I are recording this on a Monday just after Apple's new Mac event.

12
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
So we'll talk about it a little bit today.

13
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
It's called Mac Day, right?

14
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Yeah, but by the time people are listening to this, they're probably feeling like it's been Mac week and they're kind of done with it.

15
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
So we understand that we do grok that.

16
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
But we got to find out is Mike getting a new Mac.

17
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
So what do you think?

18
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Holy ****.

19
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
If I'm getting a new Mac, you think holy ****.

20
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I think you have to like and I'm not even exaggerating when I say this.

21
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:27,000
I truly think this is probably the most significant Mac upgrade I've ever seen in 30 years.

22
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Yeah, it is.

23
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Yeah, I'm not really.

24
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I could tell you why.

25
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:42,000
OK, the current problem I have with my Apple computers is a deep feeling of betrayal and disappointment in my iMac Pro.

26
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Oh, because for my workloads, which have nothing to do with video editing, right?

27
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:52,000
It is consistently either matched or lapped by my MacBook Air M1.

28
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
OK, you're losing me.

29
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Well, so just hear me out, right?

30
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:02,000
The gating factor is not how quickly I can like bootstrap a Python workload anymore.

31
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Sure, sure.

32
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
It's just fast enough.

33
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
So was the iMac, to be fair.

34
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
I track what you're saying.

35
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:13,000
You're saying really all this additional performance and cores and RAM doesn't really change your day to day job.

36
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
This is unusually reasonable and logical.

37
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I don't really know how to process this.

38
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I don't know.

39
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I mean, right now, the gating factor to my development progress, right?

40
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Like making forward progress is like getting developable specs and speccing out features.

41
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
And I could see that.

42
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:42,000
My gate factor was the RAM, because if I was going to make a transition to something where the Mac OS would be the primary OS, I'd need a lot of overhead for virtualization.

43
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:49,000
And 16 gigs of RAM sort of was a killer for me, but also just the display limitations of the M1 were also a bit of a killer for me.

44
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:53,000
There's ways around it with like Thunderbolt display port adapters and whatnot.

45
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,000
But I thought that was a you know, I'm not a big fan of having to do that.

46
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I should just the hardware should be able to support multiple screens.

47
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,000
You don't want to dongle up your way to glory.

48
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
And, you know, the rumors got it right.

49
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
16 inch and 14 inch, just as expected.

50
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Increased resolutions and pixel density as expected.

51
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Touch bar is gone.

52
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:23,000
And I said before the event started to Alex, my co-host on Self Hosted, I said, if Apple adds the ports back, that's a pretty big reversal.

53
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:29,000
And if they get rid of the touch bar, that's pretty much Apple addressing the criticism from most of the diehard Mac users.

54
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
And they did both those things.

55
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Plus, they added 120 Hertz ProMotion to the display.

56
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
And they've added MagSafe back.

57
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:44,000
And it's faster now you get 50 percent charge in 30 minutes and you can get up to like 32 gigs of RAM.

58
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,000
No, I'm sorry. Sixty four gigs of RAM on the on the on the top one.

59
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:55,000
For me, the numbers that really impress me these days and they nail nail the timing on this is the performance to power ratio.

60
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Because in the back of my mind, I'm always kind of thinking, well, what if I want to go work out of the woods for a week and I'm running off solar and it's the winter and there's very little solar.

61
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Having something that just even if the numbers were like 10 to 20 percent less than what they claimed on stage, which I don't think they will be at 30 watts.

62
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Is truly a revolutionary breakthrough in the PC industry.

63
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:31,000
In some workloads, the M1 Max chip is using 100 watts less than an AMD or Intel part of similar speed, 100 watts for me.

64
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
And that's a continuous thing, right?

65
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:38,000
So that that means a continuous draw and they're maxing out in the high 30 range.

66
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,000
They haven't they didn't say specifically what it was, but on their chart it was 30 watts.

67
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,000
That means my whole family has more power for longer.

68
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Like I can stretch the solar. I guess that's a big deal.

69
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:53,000
And they're really nailing that right now in a way that nobody else in the industry is.

70
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:57,000
You make a good point. Maybe I'm being a little too cold, cold water on this.

71
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:04,000
But if you've like been rocking a 2015, 20, whatever, even like a 2019 might be pushing it.

72
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:13,000
But any of the Intel Macs and you don't have like the need to virtualize Windows on Intel, which is a thing I still do on my Mac Pro for all the I give it because I have to do it for client projects.

73
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:17,000
It's kind of a no brainer, which scares me for like the Linux vendors.

74
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Yeah, yeah. Because the prices are steep.

75
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:25,000
I mean, the model I would buy, I did get into the configurator.

76
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:31,000
And it's like thirty eight hundred dollars and it's almost thirty nine hundred dollars.

77
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Yeah. And then it's over four grand after shipping.

78
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Right. And then you get taxed into. Yeah. Yeah.

79
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:45,000
The shipping I think was free, but the taxes for my spec'd out one that I was just checking out before the show, before the configurator page went down was forty three hundred dollars after tax.

80
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Yeah, it's a lot, but it's definitely a multi-year computer.

81
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:58,000
You know, for us, Mac so rarely comes through the studio that every Mac JB's ever bought is still around in some capacity.

82
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:05,000
They just get relegated to lesser and lesser important tasks like none of them are really involved at all in production anymore.

83
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:12,000
But they do other things, ancillary things like, you know, maybe run a sound board or, you know, my kid can play Minecraft on it.

84
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:20,000
And they they are some of them are, you know, 10 years old, like they really last, especially when you just want to play a Java app or something.

85
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:25,000
It's pretty impressive. So I'm not so worried about long term the the price.

86
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:32,000
But up front, it's just high enough that I have to go, all right, well, let's be sensible about this.

87
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
First thing I have to do is I have to replace the JB core server here.

88
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:42,000
But then once I get that up and going like and I'm actually I'm extremely, extremely thankful.

89
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:47,000
We had a listener, the real zombie, send us an amazing Dell.

90
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
It's a it's used to him. Right. But it's it's brand new to me.

91
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:57,000
And it's loaded to the gills with like three hundred and eighty four gigs of RAM and like 24 cores of CPU.

92
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Like, it's just incredible. I mean, it's going to be a powerhouse system.

93
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:05,000
But I still have to get like nearly 30, 40 terabytes worth of storage for it.

94
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:09,000
So I want to get all that stuff figured out. Then I think I'm going to look at this real hard.

95
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
You know how I like to operate like I'm going to get something.

96
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,000
I'm generally going to get it before the tax when the tax season is over.

97
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,000
So that way it goes under these this year's taxes. And so it'll be and I think it's going to happen.

98
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:26,000
I just I feel like I need to do a little more research on virtualization and what it's like to run Linux on this.

99
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:36,000
And then the other story that's going to be really interesting is if the Asahi Linux guys get Linux running on the M1 Max and Pro, that is going to we don't know yet.

100
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,000
That could be a whole different ballgame or everything could just work and it could just work faster.

101
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:47,000
We just don't know yet. And when we start to get signs of that, even just early signs, that'll probably also.

102
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Well, or I'll buy it before then. It's coming soon, I think it's this is the one I've been waiting for.

103
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:57,000
I see. I feel like if you really want it, this is the money you're waiting for. And you you probably want to cover it, too.

104
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Right. Even in the other shows that are more Linux focused, I wouldn't wait too long because those ship times are going to get rough.

105
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Yeah. Yeah. With the part shortage. I think you might be right. I've been thinking about that.

106
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Yeah. And I think, too, like I think a lot of people in the Linux community for the thinking of the other shows, I think they kind of have blinders on this one.

107
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:23,000
They'll they'll they'll have they'll joke about the notch or they'll they'll mock the price.

108
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:29,000
And they're failing to see like what is truly a value here is to certain types of professionals.

109
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:36,000
This has an incredible set of appealing features from from battery life and performance, but also.

110
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:44,000
The speaker system on the MacBook Pro 16. Is better than any other PC out there, and I've even had vendors send me their laptops

111
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:53,000
where they've boasted about this impressive Dolby system with a subwoofer built in that they've they've worked with this so-and-so musician to make this amazing sound system in the laptop.

112
00:08:53,000 --> 00:09:07,000
And it's a joke compared to the MacBook Pro 16. They also have a multi-mic array set up in the laptop that actually gives you a usable microphone for video conferences.

113
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:16,000
And you don't sound like that's the one thing that is that does ever so slightly tempt me because I spend my life in the nightmare that is in meetings.

114
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,000
And when you bring it all together, the new keyboard is good.

115
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:27,000
These new screens with promotion. Is it new? You know, since the since 2019, it's not the magic.

116
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:32,000
It's not the or it's not the butterfly anymore. It's the magic keyboard. They fix the damn keyboard.

117
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Right. You take the good, solid industrial design, the super high resolution screen, the very good audio system, the improved camera.

118
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:49,000
And the M1 Max and Pro performance with the battery life and you add that all together.

119
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:54,000
I don't really think there is an X86 based laptop that actually competes on all of those points.

120
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Now, like yourself, not everyone needs that stuff.

121
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:03,000
So it's not like I'm not sitting here saying it's a laptop for everyone, but I just think they nailed it.

122
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:11,000
I think I was expecting what we got with the M1 Pro. And when we saw 32 core on the M1 Max, that's when they broke my brain.

123
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Yeah, I mean, I'm kind of surprised that the SD card made a return.

124
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Oh, yeah. And the ports. I forgot about the ports. Right. That's a big deal to MagSafe.

125
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:27,000
I'm actually it's not clear to me if that's like can you charge via USB-C as well?

126
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Because I have just a ton of USB-C stuff.

127
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:35,000
I know. I sure hope so. But what happens if both of them are providing power?

128
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Does it default to the MagSafe? I hope. But who knows?

129
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:42,000
I assume it does. But my fear is that you can't charge via USB-C.

130
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:48,000
So that like for all your peripherals, you got to carry USB-C cables and you have to carry this MagSafe cable.

131
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Yeah, that would suck. Yeah, but no, it's good stuff.

132
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Yeah, we don't really know how the GPU stacks up to the mid tier and high tier Nvidia or AMD GPUs yet.

133
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:03,000
We can look at the numbers and get an idea that's competitive, but we don't really know.

134
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:09,000
And, you know, there's a lot of workloads out there that are just simply designed for DirectX or Vulkan.

135
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:15,000
And so these machines will never be applicable. But it does look really good. They didn't screw it up.

136
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Right. And that's what we can say. They didn't screw it up. They made very compelling laptops again.

137
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:26,000
And it's been a while since I've had that. I've had that feeling about Apple. It's been years, really.

138
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Yeah, it's good stuff. All right. A long timer is stuck at a fork in the road, Mike.

139
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:37,000
And he writes it. You remember K.P. Vauk or K.Pauk? Yeah, you remember him.

140
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:42,000
He's been a listener since 2014. Says Koder is one of his can't miss podcasts.

141
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:47,000
And he's got two questions for us. He says, I work as a senior software engineer for a large corporation.

142
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:52,000
It's a major Department of Defense contractor recently due to the White House mandate.

143
00:11:52,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Oh, I know where this is going. My employer has implemented a policy stating all employees must receive their final vaccination by November 24th.

144
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Now, without getting into the whole hot button issue of the covid vaccine, its effectiveness and mandates,

145
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:11,000
I've yet to decide if I want to follow through with the shot or if I want to find employment elsewhere.

146
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Do you all know of any resources for finding software engineering jobs that employers who are not mandating all workers be vaccinated?

147
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:24,000
He goes on to say, My second question is, do you have any advice for getting through the H.R.

148
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Tech buzzword filters? An example of this is on my end.

149
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:34,000
I got turned down over the past year by GitLab for just not having, quote, significant professional experience with Ruby on rails.

150
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:38,000
And over the last five years, I've worked on many different framework backends,

151
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:45,000
including Java, Tomcat, Node.js, Express, Python, Flask, ASP.net, C sharp go.

152
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,000
He's even played around with Django, which we'll get into in a bit.

153
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:54,000
He says that I feel like I have a lot of qualifications, but I don't have specific buzzword qualifications,

154
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:58,000
even though I could learn those skills very quickly. Any advice would be appreciated.

155
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,000
And you all never again find an exit strategy from the show.

156
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Well, so to his first question about trying to, you know, leave over the mandate or whatever, that's everybody's that's your decision.

157
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:22,000
I would I would say you're probably at the right time and place to do it just because the job market's so hot right now that it is a job seekers market at the moment in terms of hiring.

158
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Now, in terms of getting around buzzword filters, what are your thoughts on that?

159
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Do you do you come up with a way or do you just find a way to incorporate the buzzwords into your now?

160
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:36,000
You just lean. You just embrace the demon blood that is the buzzwords.

161
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,000
I mean, it sucks. Right. But what are you going to do? Right.

162
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:46,000
But if the company is big enough to have a char, I mean, everybody who kind of knows what they're doing will know that your resumes have B.S.

163
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:51,000
anyway. I mean, you could you could try sending them a PowerPoint before I interview with you.

164
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:57,000
I'd like to present a case as to why buzzwords are a bad way to review candidates. And no, it's not going to work.

165
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:03,000
You just got to get past the HR folks. I mean, it's it's annoying. It's yeah, you just do right there.

166
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:11,000
They're there for a reason. And that reason is to actually don't understand why HR gets in front of hiring.

167
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Oh, you know why? Oh, I know what they're really for. Oh, I know what they're really for.

168
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Yeah, it's totally 100 percent about cover your bottom for the company.

169
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Right. Like there's so many laws and rules and it varies state by state to about hiring.

170
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,000
And I know this because and you've you must have witnessed this as well.

171
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:37,000
It was so loosey goosey when I first started doing it like and I was a kid back then.

172
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:41,000
And they just have me come in and sit in on any old interview and ask any old question.

173
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:53,000
And then, you know, we'd sit around afterwards and talk about the candidate. And there was no no like rep from HR that stopped by and said, Mr. Fisher, before you go into that interview, be sure you don't ask these questions like none of that.

174
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:57,000
And then as time went on, oh, man, you you became a partner with HR.

175
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,000
You no longer went out and did the interviewing and the hiring yourself.

176
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,000
You worked in a partnership with HR to find the candidate.

177
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:11,000
And they are the front line to help keep you from being inundated with applications, which is the reason they tell you, which is in part true.

178
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:15,000
That's part of it. But it's also about covering the bottom of the company.

179
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:24,000
My first interview was with somebody who ran a tech company, but was from a very different, more loose industry.

180
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,000
And her first question to me was like, hey, so you got a girlfriend.

181
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Maybe you don't like girls. Well, like right into like, how old are you? Like, oh, yeah. You know, which training did you take?

182
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Oh, yeah. That area sucks. Like, whoa. And I didn't know. I mean, in a weird way, it was it was very disarming because I was like, oh, OK, I'm like, you know, I was super young.

183
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:47,000
I was like 19. I was interviewing for some contracting thing, but it disarmed me.

184
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,000
But now I'm like, I would never ask those questions ever.

185
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:57,000
And I mean, I know KP knows this because he's listened to the show since 2014, but there there is a game you can play here.

186
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:01,000
You can look at as a game or a genuine opportunity, but social engineering. That's what it is.

187
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,000
I mean, yeah, you you you you engineer it.

188
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:10,000
And like we said last week, you could even engineer the resume a little bit for the for the specific place you're applying.

189
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:18,000
But also and this is another thing we see on the show all the time, participate in an open source project that is using these languages and get involved and get on their GitHub

190
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:22,000
and get out there a little bit. And you can point to that as experience.

191
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:27,000
So you can say I have all these on job experience with everything from Java to go.

192
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:33,000
But I also have community free time experience, which demonstrates that you have a passion for this stuff.

193
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:38,000
And I've worked with Ruby with XYZ open source project. Here's a link to their GitHub.

194
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Man, that works. We hear from people all the time. That works. And it's something that we didn't mention last week.

195
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,000
But it's something we try to mention from time to time. All right.

196
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Nate is plagued by his and his just his general dev environment setup. He says, Hi, Mike and Chris.

197
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:57,000
I'm a longtime listener and PHP web developer turned into a Salesforce developer.

198
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:08,000
I recently started a side project for mostly education purposes on using Python with fast API per Mike suggestion and Angular that integrates within Salesforce.

199
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:12,000
This project, like others, I've started to learn a new framework or language or an API,

200
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:18,000
but it's been plagued by a seemingly tedious process of setting up my development environment.

201
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:26,000
There seems to be 50 different popular tutorials for setting up an Angular environment or a Python development environment for various purposes.

202
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Added on to that, there's often the magic scripts that just do a plethora of things that really I don't even think are often needed.

203
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:38,000
And oftentimes I find I get into actually building and get working on something and then encounter an issue with my environment

204
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:44,000
that blocks me from proceeding until I determine how to correct it or I just start over with a whole new environment.

205
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Consequently, well, very little progress is made on actually building what I want to build.

206
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:54,000
So how do you go about setting up your environment for something that might be newer to you?

207
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Are there go to resources that you trust? Is it something wrong with my process?

208
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:05,000
I understand that setting up an environment is part of the learning, but it seems just disproportional to my end goals.

209
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:10,000
I would love any help I can get so that way I can actually learn new skills and build my projects.

210
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Nate, so he's getting stuck on the environment setup.

211
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:19,000
And I wonder if this is something maybe you used to run into that maybe you've normalized now.

212
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:27,000
That would be a nice stream. So now this is I mean, I know this feels like a terrible answer, man.

213
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,000
It's always bad. Anytime you have to have a new tool chain.

214
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:35,000
For me, any time macOS updates, I have like a 50% chance of it just breaking all my homebrew packages

215
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:40,000
and having to go through that arduous process of reinstalling everything.

216
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:44,000
I mean, you asked about Python specifically.

217
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:50,000
I think the fast API tutorials, but more importantly, the example apps on GitHub are good.

218
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Like anything else, it's always going to be annoying to set up tool chain.

219
00:18:55,000 --> 00:19:00,000
It's going to be some dumb thing that didn't link right together.

220
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:05,000
For Python specifically, VS Code and PyLance do make it somewhat less painful,

221
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:09,000
but you're still going to have to set up Postgres or whatever database.

222
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,000
And that's still going to be a manual process.

223
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Yeah, I mean, not to tie two emails together, but for anybody doing Rails like the last writer,

224
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Go Rails actually has a great step-by-step getting set up with Ruby and Rails on all the platforms, including WSL.

225
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
But that's super rare.

226
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:32,000
I guess maybe I could attempt to write one for getting set up with fast API,

227
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:38,000
but the problem is some package is going to update somewhere on some distro or macOS,

228
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,000
and it's going to be out of date.

229
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
It's always bad.

230
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:47,000
For instance, macOS Monterey is coming out on the 25th. Guess who's not upgrading?

231
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Right, because you know it's going to be a bad time.

232
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
It's going to break my setup.

233
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:56,000
I will mention, just as a reminder, our friends over at Cloud Guru

234
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:02,000
do have a certified entry-level Python programming course that is a good starting place.

235
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,000
It also helps you prep for a certification if you want it,

236
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:08,000
and it covers the environment you'll be working in.

237
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:15,000
It also covers some Python fundamentals like the data types, control flow structures,

238
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
functions and generators, all that kind of stuff,

239
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:21,000
but you'll feel pretty comfortable by the time you finish that course.

240
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:25,000
So go look for the certified entry-level Python programmer course,

241
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:29,000
or I'll have a link in the show notes for that, and that's from a Cloud Guru at cloudguru.com.

242
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:37,000
But additionally, on top of that, I feel like this project is being solved at a software level

243
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:40,000
by several different places at the moment.

244
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:45,000
One of our friends over at Fedora are trying to solve this essentially with Silverblue,

245
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:50,000
where you'll have an immutable system that you can update and you can roll back

246
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,000
if something doesn't work right, and the applications and their data

247
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
are completely separate from the operating system,

248
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:58,000
and they use an environment called Toolbox.

249
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:02,000
And Toolbox creates pet containers where you actually install everything

250
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,000
inside these pet containers that are isolated from the core operating system.

251
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:11,000
You just launch a terminal emulator, just looks like a regular old Linux terminal with Bash,

252
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:16,000
but it's actually inside a container environment that can access your file system

253
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
as if it was a regular terminal.

254
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:22,000
And anything you install and create in there is in that contained environment

255
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
and doesn't go on the host operating system.

256
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:28,000
So you can upgrade, say, your version of Fedora or whatever it is,

257
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:32,000
and that environment remains consistent and persistent.

258
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Containers are another way this is being solved,

259
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,000
and I think one of the reasons you're seeing container use explode

260
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:41,000
is because it gives developers a predictable environment.

261
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:45,000
And that's what's been the secret success of containers,

262
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,000
is that is such a needed thing for creating your applications

263
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
or delivering your applications.

264
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:54,000
So what you're stumbling onto, Nate, is kind of a core problem that the industry

265
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:58,000
has been throwing a lot of engineering resources at solving recently.

266
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
So you're not alone on this one, my friend,

267
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,000
but perhaps you could be using a more modern workflow.

268
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
And if you're just starting out,

269
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,000
why not look into running your Python development environment out of a container?

270
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
It's not that crazy.

271
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
People do it already.

272
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:14,000
And then you can move it, you can upgrade your OS,

273
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,000
and as long as your container still starts, you're going to be good to go.

274
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:21,000
It's not like the perfect solution, and it would be really, really nice

275
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:25,000
if desktop operating systems were better at this kind of thing.

276
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:28,000
But the very flexibility that lets you install a development environment

277
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,000
and access those libraries and components from all the different applications

278
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,000
is the very thing that makes this so tricky.

279
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:38,000
So Josh writes in, and he has our last email for the week,

280
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:42,000
and he knows that you and I are not big on virtual events,

281
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,000
but he wonders what we thought about virtual developer events,

282
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:49,000
specifically developer conferences like the upcoming.NET 2021 conference

283
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
on November 9th.

284
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:55,000
The Google I.O. has been a thing that's going to be virtual for a while.

285
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:58,000
He's curious what we think, and do we actually end up trying out

286
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,000
any of the new stuff, like the new APIs that get announced

287
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
at these virtual events?

288
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:06,000
He says, thanks for our time, curious to know our thoughts, Josh.

289
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,000
So specifically, virtual events for developers.

290
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
What are your thoughts on that?

291
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:15,000
I do not like them.

292
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
I feel like they lose a lot.

293
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:20,000
I feel like, in a way, they're kind of inauthentic.

294
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
I mean, the presenters do a great job.

295
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,000
I'm not trying to be whatever.

296
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:30,000
But part of it is seeing something cool in a presentation,

297
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,000
and then having a chat with the presenter after,

298
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:36,000
or even just huddling with maybe the people you know,

299
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
the folks you know at the convention, and being like,

300
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,000
is that how I would do it?

301
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,000
I don't know.

302
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:44,000
Or if you're an iOS developer, back in the day when I did that full time,

303
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
they have to do that on Android?

304
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
That sounds terrible.

305
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,000
Yikes.

306
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,000
Too much?

307
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:53,000
I mean, it's the same way I feel about the general tech conferences

308
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:56,000
that we've talked about at length for the last month or two.

309
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,000
I think you lose something over Zoom, or Google, or whatever,

310
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
you know, voice chat you're using.

311
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,000
A hundred percent.

312
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
And enthusiasm is one of them.

313
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
You know, getting excited about stuff.

314
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,000
Unless you have a Hollywood production budget for your virtual event.

315
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:12,000
I like that Sage Alicia in the chat room says that, you know,

316
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
I worked Python professionally on Macs,

317
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
and almost every developer team had their own environment

318
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,000
set up slightly differently.

319
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:20,000
He says, some systems are using Python from Mac OS,

320
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,000
installing it from Homebrew.

321
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
Others are installing it from PyEnvironment.

322
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
Others were installing it via Anaconda.

323
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
Like, it's just all over the place.

324
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,000
It's gross, really.

325
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
You know, Josh, back to the virtual events.

326
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:34,000
I go into in our coderly, which is going to be out this week,

327
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,000
our coderly report.

328
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:39,000
I go into why I think virtual conferences have a massive reckoning coming,

329
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
which I got a little insider info on that.

330
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:44,000
But that aside, which I'll leave that for the coderly,

331
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
there can be a positive.

332
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,000
So I'll focus on the positive of virtual events.

333
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:54,000
The positive is, they do become available to people who could never make it.

334
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:59,000
You know, people who couldn't travel, or it was too far, or whatever.

335
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
They just couldn't make it.

336
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,000
Now they can attend.

337
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,000
So there's that.

338
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:10,000
Additionally, because it's new, like, it's still kind of,

339
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:15,000
still kind of possible to sometimes, at the right virtual event,

340
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:19,000
actually have a conversation with the presenter, like in a side chat room.

341
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
Because there's not hundreds or thousands of people hitting them at once,

342
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
all the time, or her.

343
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,000
It can happen, though.

344
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
And so sometimes that can be a positive.

345
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,000
People are a little more accessible because the event itself is just a little less.

346
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
There's less going on, right?

347
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
Like, after they're done with their Zoom presentation,

348
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:36,000
they turn off their camera, the next person goes,

349
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
and they're just sitting there at their computer answering chats.

350
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,000
And so sometimes you can reach people that you couldn't reach in person

351
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
because they'd have a whole crowd around them.

352
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:46,000
To be honest, I'm reaching for that one.

353
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:52,000
That is me trying to find something that I feel like is a positive,

354
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
outside of just the accessibility.

355
00:25:54,000 --> 00:26:00,000
What I would really like to see happen is a pretty significant reduction

356
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,000
in virtual events, which I think is going to happen.

357
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:09,000
I think it's already, the reckoning's already begun.

358
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:13,000
And I'd like to see in-person events try harder at streaming

359
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:17,000
and doing virtual aspects and making the presentations available online,

360
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,000
quickly posting the videos.

361
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:21,000
And that's really all that needs to be done.

362
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
If they could just get the videos turned around quicker.

363
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
And it's possible, you know.

364
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:28,000
You could, this show is live streamed right now.

365
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,000
And with a push of a button on several different streaming platforms,

366
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:34,000
I could make that live stream available.

367
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
Now, we prefer to edit and refine the show.

368
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:41,000
But for a presentation at an event, totally usable.

369
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:45,000
So there's just a workflow issue there, I think, Josh.

370
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
And I hope that people figure that stuff out.

371
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:51,000
And I hope the in-person events tick back up again.

372
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
What do you say we move on to some hoopla?

373
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,000
You feel like...

374
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,000
I don't believe you.

375
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,000
Feel like talking about some hoopla?

376
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,000
Hang on.

377
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
My Singleton service just destroyed all my databases

378
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
for my AAA game that made billions of dollars.

379
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
Oh, man.

380
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,000
Yeah.

381
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,000
So I love Diablo.

382
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
Always raised in the dark lord.

383
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
Stay wild and listen.

384
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,000
That's right.

385
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:15,000
And I've Diablo 1, Diablo 2, all the Diablos.

386
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,000
Is there a Diablo 3?

387
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,000
I don't know.

388
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:20,000
What about the bad one, Diablo 3?

389
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
Yeah, I don't remember that one.

390
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,000
That's right.

391
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
I love Mac OS,

392
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:28,000
except for that whole three-year period of keyboards that didn't work.

393
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,000
Yes.

394
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,000
Right, sure, sure.

395
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
So this is funny, right?

396
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:35,000
Multiple outages, data loss, as you said,

397
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:41,000
caused by, again, essentially an internal wound.

398
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
Oh, technical debts of mother.

399
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:46,000
It's funny because the only other MMO that I'm familiar with

400
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
on the internal structure,

401
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,000
what eventually got them was the same kind of like login,

402
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:54,000
spin up a new instance process,

403
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
was just bogged down with technical debt,

404
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:59,000
which sounds like exactly what happened to the Diablo 2 servers.

405
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:03,000
And then, of course, they had to do all kinds of really user hostile things,

406
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:07,000
like they had to throw up a rate limit and queue up users,

407
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
so that way people go to launch their video game

408
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
and they'd have to be told to wait.

409
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:14,000
And back in my day, like when Diablo 1 came out,

410
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
you just installed it on your damn computer and played it.

411
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,000
But now...

412
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,000
It was shareware too.

413
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,000
There was a shareware version.

414
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,000
Yeah, yeah.

415
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
Like you could do like the first...

416
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,000
First dungeon.

417
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,000
You could get to, right?

418
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,000
Yeah, yeah.

419
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
Yeah, that's what it was, the first dungeon.

420
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:30,000
Yeah, that was fun too because those local games,

421
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
when you got bored with them,

422
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
you could start modding them.

423
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,000
And same with Minecraft.

424
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,000
Like this is...

425
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
My son still prefers to play the Java edition of Minecraft

426
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:41,000
because after you've played it for a lifetime,

427
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
you get bored and you want to start experimenting with it

428
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
and you want to add and change things in the game.

429
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
And these remote games,

430
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
the anti-cheat stuff prevents that.

431
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
And sometimes they prevent you from playing.

432
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:54,000
The one true version of Minecraft is the Java version.

433
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
So yeah, Diablo 2.

434
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
All the money in the world, right?

435
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,000
And they still go down.

436
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:03,000
Well, but first of all, I love the...

437
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
And there's a link to this in the show notes,

438
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:08,000
the technical rep who wrote this.

439
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,000
Because he says,

440
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:13,000
to maintain the integrity of the original Diablo 2 experience,

441
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
we kept the legacy code.

442
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:18,000
Translation, stop yelling at us.

443
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,000
It's those bastards from the 90s that did this.

444
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:24,000
Like, it's a tried and true in the consulting world.

445
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
You blame the other developers every time.

446
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,000
You just say,

447
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:30,000
those guys, they don't know what they're doing.

448
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:33,000
But my favorite thing,

449
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:37,000
I mean, let's not get too much in the weeds here,

450
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
but they have Diablo 2.

451
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
It's not some indie game that like you're...

452
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
It's not Celeste, which Celeste is awesome.

453
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,000
You should play Celeste.

454
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:49,000
But you have to log in because, you know,

455
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:52,000
got to get that sweet, sweet licensing money.

456
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
You have regions, right?

457
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,000
North America, Asia, Europe.

458
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
And I think there might be a Pacific region,

459
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,000
like the islands.

460
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,000
In World of Warcraft,

461
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:02,000
which apparently this is not running on the same infrastructure

462
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:05,000
because World of Warcraft does not have this problem.

463
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,000
Fine.

464
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
You would think you're logging into your region,

465
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
but it turns out there's like a master,

466
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:14,000
like a login and game creation service that is a singleton,

467
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
which means there can only ever be one.

468
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:20,000
In the known universe that just got hammered

469
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:25,000
because it was written in the nineties and not ready for one.

470
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:29,000
Diablo 2 is probably more popular now than it was then, right?

471
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
Because nostalgia plus new people.

472
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:34,000
Also, people's gameplay habits have changed, right?

473
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
I also had Diablo 2.

474
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
It was on CD-ROMs.

475
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,000
I played it offline.

476
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,000
Yeah. Okay.

477
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,000
Right.

478
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
So yes, children,

479
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:47,000
the computers used to have this tray in the beige box that they came in

480
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
where you would hit a button, it would open,

481
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
and you put a round frisbee in it.

482
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
Or a cup, depending on...

483
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,000
You could have a...

484
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,000
Well, I hope not.

485
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
I mean, the game, Diablo 2,

486
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:01,000
its initial release date was in the year 2000.

487
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,000
So it's, you know...

488
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
Yeah, it was developed in the nineties, though, right?

489
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
Yeah, absolutely it was.

490
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,000
Yeah.

491
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,000
I mean, there's a series of books,

492
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,000
stay a while and listen,

493
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:13,000
and I apologize, I forget the author's name, I highly recommend them.

494
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,000
There's two of them.

495
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:17,000
And they talk about the development of Diablo 1 and Diablo 2.

496
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:20,000
And if you read those books,

497
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:23,000
you will know the old adage, never get into networking.

498
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:28,000
Because making that stuff work on early aughts slash 1990s modems,

499
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
not fun.

500
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
So the whole thing crashed.

501
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:35,000
And because of the way they architected the system,

502
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:39,000
they not only had to implement these, let's just say, obnoxious,

503
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:43,000
like logging queues and rate limiting,

504
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:46,000
they actually lost like a day and a half of data.

505
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,000
Yeah, that's a shame.

506
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:51,000
Because the database kept trying to back itself up,

507
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:54,000
which meant it couldn't resolve right transactions.

508
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:58,000
And I know we're getting deep into like why databases are scary.

509
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:01,000
But this is just like a classic,

510
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
like this is a multi-building system.

511
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:06,000
Like this is a multi-billion dollar company.

512
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
This is amazing.

513
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:12,000
And I'll do another book recommendation,

514
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:15,000
Exercising Legacy Code, I believe is the title.

515
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
This is like the best case.

516
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
I encourage you all to read it.

517
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:24,000
This is the best case study for why working with legacy code that was written,

518
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
maybe not, I'm not saying the code is bad, right?

519
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
But it was written with different expectations

520
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
about what the environment would be like.

521
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,000
And different use scale.

522
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,000
Different use scale, definitely different scale, right?

523
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:36,000
Different, just like the whole concept of networking was different.

524
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:41,000
It's one of the worst and most complicated problems.

525
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:45,000
So someone in the email has mentioned that I had done some military contracting.

526
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:50,000
This is the challenge in that field because everything is basically old.

527
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,000
Sure.

528
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:55,000
You would be horrified to see how much work Windows XP is doing

529
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
or was doing a few years ago.

530
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
I feel their pain.

531
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:04,000
I also love the amount of sass in this post that I'm amazed they were allowed to write.

532
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:07,000
What I don't love is they put in apostrophes in the URL,

533
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:10,000
which make it basically impossible to copy correctly.

534
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,000
Well, this is brutal.

535
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:15,000
So the issue starts happening on a Saturday during peak user time.

536
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:20,000
And the problems continue on into Monday and Tuesday, like just issue after issue.

537
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
Like you get one thing back up and working,

538
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:25,000
then the players slam the service and the next thing breaks.

539
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:33,000
And unbelievably, by Wednesday, a week after constant login issues and crashes,

540
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:37,000
the game had its highest ever concurrent players.

541
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:42,000
Hundreds of thousands of players in one region alone, Blizzard said.

542
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
Ready your ion cannons, kids.

543
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:48,000
That is, I mean, and that was just like in the Australian region, I guess, too.

544
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
But in the U.S. you had the highest concurrent users at the same time.

545
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:53,000
It's, what's going on?

546
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:56,000
Why are these old games as they're getting such?

547
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
Yeah, I know.

548
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
But, you know, like except for the Warcraft three remake,

549
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:06,000
it's just when you and I were growing up, like everything our parents liked was stuff from like their high school years.

550
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:11,000
And when, you know, their glory days and they just never really like my folks just, you know,

551
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
sometimes that's where their tastes are rooted.

552
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:20,000
But it seems like the stuff that came out during our formative years remains very popular.

553
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:27,000
Like you see them keep remaking the movies that were from the 80s and the 90s and you see them keep these video games.

554
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:32,000
I mean, Nintendo has built an entire empire on refreshing nostalgia, you know,

555
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:42,000
and it's remarkable that these old games clearly were good games and it wasn't just rose tinted glasses because this is an astounding stat to see.

556
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:47,000
This is their highest concurrent users ever for a 20 year old piece of software.

557
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:53,000
OK, but I mean, a Pink Floyd album is like multigenerationally popular.

558
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:58,000
I have a there's a 14 year old who lives in my house that she loves the nostalgia trip.

559
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:02,000
Right. Stuff older than from when you and I were growing up.

560
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
I think it's just the classics are the classics.

561
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:08,000
Yeah, I suppose. And maybe it's a confluence of the arts refined to a certain point,

562
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:14,000
the technology was a certain point and the budget for the build and the storytelling, it was all at the right spot.

563
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
Or can I fry some bacon?

564
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:19,000
Oh, you know what? I love bacon, as long as it's not that stuff with the nitrates.

565
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:24,000
You know, you got to cut that out. This is from Tristan, which there's your reference.

566
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:33,000
Maybe it's because new games, Diablo three are incorporating microtransactions and like loot crates and stuff like that too much.

567
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:37,000
And the old games were like, you buy the game, you have the game.

568
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:42,000
I love the idea that consumers on mass don't like that stuff.

569
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
That seems I like that. Let's go with that. That's a good theory.

570
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:48,000
I can tell you, my son is an avid Nintendo fan. Yeah.

571
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:51,000
A little too much. We got to limit that.

572
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:55,000
But he now prefers the regular Mario games like iPad games.

573
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:59,000
He won't touch them because like this is crap. Straight up Mario.

574
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:02,000
You've got the game. You've got the game. If there's a secret, you find the secret.

575
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:06,000
You've got the secret. It's 60 bucks, but you're not getting nickel and dime.

576
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:12,000
You buy it once unless unless you're Reese and you decide to spill your apple juice on the cartridge.

577
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:15,000
But generally, you've got it once. Yeah, I mean, sure.

578
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:22,000
I actually would be willing to bet you Nintendo will find clever ways to resell that game to your son over and over again his entire life.

579
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:29,000
I just I'm signing up for the fifty dollar upgrade to the Nintendo online service because right because I need those sweet, sweet Genesis games.

580
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:32,000
And you know what? They're their Nintendo game.

581
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:36,000
They're guess what? Surprise, surprise. Their emulation is spot on. They do a great job.

582
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:39,000
It's so good. It is. It is a lot of fun.

583
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:45,000
And those old games like like we're just saying, the Super Super Mario that came out with the SNES.

584
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:48,000
Oh, yeah. I'll sit down and I'll play that and I'll enjoy the hell out of it.

585
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:52,000
I play it to go to bed. Yeah. Really? Super Mario World.

586
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:56,000
Yeah. The SNES one. Yeah. The first one. Yeah. The first one on the SNES.

587
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:00,000
Yeah, that's I like to sit down and see how fast I can bust through the first world.

588
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:06,000
Oh, yeah. And I got it. Then you always you get you got to get the secret above the first ghost house.

589
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:09,000
You know what I'm talking about? Yeah. You got to get the thing where you can jump ahead.

590
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:13,000
Yeah, that's that's so nice. And then get Star Road going. Oh, yeah.

591
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,000
Yeah, I'm a yeah, I'm a big fan of that stuff.

592
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:18,000
And it just really does hold up. And you're right. It's so nice to have the whole game.

593
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:23,000
Just one more nostalgia trip. Sonic two or Sonic three.

594
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:30,000
You drink a bunch of Red Bull and you see how fast you can go through it.

595
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:40,000
Linode dot com slash coder. That's where Blizzard should be hosting their Diablo two servers. That's where we host everything because the performance is incredible and the stability is top notch.

596
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:43,000
There are hosting provider now for over two years.

597
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:50,000
I started there because I was I was honestly just a little curious to see how Linode does things because they've been around since 2003.

598
00:37:50,000 --> 00:38:00,000
Way before all the big like crazy VC funded fly by night VPS came in and before the big hyperscalers.

599
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:04,000
So how does somebody who's been doing this? How does a company that's been doing this for 18 years?

600
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
How do they evolve and how do they keep competitive?

601
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:12,000
I was curious because I'd seen them at the advance. I'd seen them supporting the community and I tried it out.

602
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:19,000
Well, when it was time to go independent, I was so happy and I was by this point I was I was well into using Linode.

603
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:24,000
I contacted them and said, I'd love to have you on the network as a sponsor. We're going independent again.

604
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:32,000
Let's let's work together. And man, has that been awesome because now all of you are seeing what's so great about Linode.

605
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:38,000
And it's so refreshing in this age to have something just as straightforward as Linode.

606
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:44,000
You go there. The pricing is very clear. It's very simple. Every system you get is going to outperform.

607
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:47,000
It's going to it's going to exceed your expectations.

608
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:52,000
They have fantastic customer support, clear, clean documentation.

609
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:56,000
It's all there and it's just a breath of fresh air. It's so nice.

610
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:01,000
Plus, they've been around forever and they're independently owned, independently financed.

611
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,000
They, you know, they have paid their way.

612
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:08,000
They're not taking like VC funding where they have to have total world domination or bust.

613
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:13,000
And you can do things like a five dollar a month server and just load it up with like for me personally,

614
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:17,000
I recommend SyncThing and a photo gallery that sits on top of that and just start there.

615
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:22,000
Or go deploy your own GitLab server. They have one click deployments for developer environments.

616
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:27,000
So that's another thing to consider is if you'd like to get started with a development environment in the cloud,

617
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:30,000
they make that really, really straightforward and you can support the show while checking it out.

618
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:37,000
So you go to linode.com slash coder, get one hundred dollars in 60 day credit on your new account and you support the show.

619
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:42,000
Linode.com slash coder. Go there, sign up, see what I've been saying, experience it for yourself.

620
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:45,000
That hundred dollars is going to actually let you test it and push it.

621
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:55,000
That is a statement of confidence on Linode's part. And I think you're going to love it. Linode.com slash coder.

622
00:39:55,000 --> 00:40:00,000
Moving right along in the hoopla, let's talk a little Django.

623
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:05,000
Might be time for a few hard things for Django lovers to hear.

624
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:10,000
But I think we have to face it. Not a lot of excitement around Django these days.

625
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
Well, so this is a complicated story, right?

626
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:17,000
Because this piece of hoopla, I think is correct, as is the next piece of hoopla.

627
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:21,000
Oh, great article. The decline of Django or Django or Django? I don't know.

628
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:26,000
Xamarin, Xamarin, right? I think it's a good post. I think you should read it,

629
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:29,000
especially if you're getting into Python and wondering what framework you should pick.

630
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:33,000
The answer is fast API. Yeah. Or flask.

631
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:37,000
I could still see Django being appealing, though, just because it has such a body of work.

632
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:42,000
It is so extensively documented and there are so many success stories out there.

633
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:46,000
Yes. I mean, if you're a Python developer and you're going to inherit a legacy app,

634
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:51,000
it's probably going to be Django or fast API. I'm sorry. Or flask.

635
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:56,000
The thing is Django, as this article puts very well, it hasn't exactly.

636
00:40:56,000 --> 00:41:02,000
You know, a lot of work is being put into the async stuff for Python and Django just isn't there.

637
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:05,000
It's been worked on for six years, hasn't happened.

638
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:08,000
But I'm going to just make this argument.

639
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:12,000
What's wrong with Django just kind of being done?

640
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:16,000
It's a website framework, right? It's like Rails.

641
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:19,000
In fact, it was like the Rails for Python.

642
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:24,000
And it's kind of fine. I mean, there's nothing wrong with it.

643
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:29,000
You can totally ship decent applications.

644
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:33,000
Or hell, if you're just doing a site for some small business or even medium business,

645
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:38,000
Django is a great choice, much like Rails is, right?

646
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:42,000
Maybe it's not the newest, sexiest thing.

647
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:46,000
It is slowly losing market share.

648
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:52,000
I personally don't use it for reasons that make a lot of sense for my use case analysis.

649
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:57,000
And, you know, clients are in between fast API and flask

650
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:00,000
leaning more in the future towards fast API.

651
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:03,000
Fast API was newer, it's matured now.

652
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:06,000
But there's nothing wrong with Django.

653
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:11,000
I like this article, but I don't think technologies ever die, right?

654
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,000
I live in Florida.

655
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:18,000
And when I'm riding on my gator, going for happy hour...

656
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,000
Do you have a saddle?

657
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:22,000
No, no, you've got to ride the gator bear.

658
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:25,000
Governor DeSantis actually stops you if he sees you riding on a gator.

659
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,000
I've heard that, yeah.

660
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:30,000
He says, I heard you're a software developer.

661
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,000
Our unemployment system went down again.

662
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:34,000
Do you happen to know COBOL?

663
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
Hey, you there on the gator.

664
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:39,000
The gator part aside is a thing that really happened.

665
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:42,000
The state of Florida was sending out notices to every company

666
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:46,000
registered as a software developer and actually calling me like,

667
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
yo, dogs, do you guys know COBOL?

668
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,000
Hey, you know what?

669
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:50,000
Not a bad approach.

670
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:53,000
If the unemployment system or whatever is down,

671
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,000
get that back up as fast as possible.

672
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,000
That's what I say.

673
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,000
Well, one, I love you, Florida.

674
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,000
Do you think they got it back up fast?

675
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,000
No, of course not.

676
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:06,000
No, they probably got scammed at least twice.

677
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:09,000
And so the next time somebody writes in asking, you know,

678
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:13,000
they're like 19, 20, they want to know what language they should learn,

679
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,000
I'm going to say COBOL because the amount of money

680
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,000
the state paid to get that site back up.

681
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:18,000
No kidding, right?

682
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:19,000
Holy crap.

683
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:22,000
So my point being, one, yay, Florida.

684
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:26,000
Two, none of this stuff ever really dies, right?

685
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:27,000
Objective C is still around.

686
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:32,000
I still get the quarterly call that there's some legacy crazy Mac thing

687
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:36,000
or iOS thing in Objective C that someone needs a hand on.

688
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
And it's great because you get to charge them a lot.

689
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:39,000
That's true.

690
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:43,000
That can be a specialty and it can be a good source of income.

691
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:47,000
This is exactly the point I was going to make right down to the COBOL.

692
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,000
It is so true.

693
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:54,000
And Django may, while it's definitely out of the hype cycle,

694
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:59,000
a lot of times in technology, right as they're about to be replaced

695
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:02,000
by the next thing, they get pretty good.

696
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:06,000
Like that iteration, generally the iteration that comes out

697
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:09,000
just after the hype cycle has passed, after people are using it,

698
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:12,000
people have moved on, they're adopting something else.

699
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:17,000
I swear in technology, a lot of times that's when the original thing

700
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:22,000
gets really good, well refined, and also a lot of the money interest

701
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:25,000
kind of relax a little bit because there's a new thing they're focused on

702
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:30,000
and that's no longer their baby, which eventually fades and is bad.

703
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:34,000
But initially, actually I think is a good thing for technology.

704
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:39,000
And so I would not be surprised if that applied to Django completely.

705
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:42,000
That's totally how the cycle works.

706
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:45,000
I also think this is another old man theme, right?

707
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:48,000
That once you're around long enough, you realize that the thing you started doing

708
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:51,000
may not necessarily be the thing you end doing.

709
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:56,000
It seems like most of the world has moved on to Python 3.

710
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,000
It just took a few years.

711
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:01,000
Only 3% of Python developers are still using Python 2

712
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:04,000
in a survey that was conducted by JetBrains.

713
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:07,000
49% are using it for web development, that doesn't surprise me.

714
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:10,000
The next most common use case, surprise, surprise,

715
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,000
data analysis and then machine learning, shocker.

716
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
Yeah, I'm not surprised at all.

717
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:17,000
Mobile development, 3% of use cases.

718
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,000
What are you people doing?

719
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,000
I don't know.

720
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:25,000
It's more common to use Python in games than it is mobile development.

721
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:30,000
Embedded development at 6%, which I guess is technically different than mobile.

722
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:33,000
And then networking programming 16%.

723
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:36,000
The bottom of the list is actually more interesting to me than the top of the list

724
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,000
because the top of the list is everything.

725
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
Can I just jump back real quick?

726
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
So embedded is super different than mobile, right?

727
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,000
It's like your IoT devices.

728
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:45,000
Yeah, that makes sense.

729
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,000
I just didn't expect to see them broken out.

730
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,000
But yeah, I get it, right?

731
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:54,000
Oh no, because there's accelerated versions of Python that worked really, really well

732
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:57,000
in like those single board, blah, blah, blah.

733
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:01,000
I guess it's sort of surprising it's so low with that considered, you know?

734
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:05,000
Well, C++ will never die.

735
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:08,000
Yeah, I suppose that's true.

736
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:13,000
Web Frameworks, NumPy, Pandas are the top two.

737
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:18,000
And Web Frameworks, you ready?

738
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:19,000
Number one is Flask.

739
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:20,000
Number two is Django.

740
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:24,000
Number three, FastAPI with only 14%.

741
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:27,000
But you know, what do you expect?

742
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:28,000
It's early days.

743
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:29,000
So good.

744
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:30,000
This all rings pretty true, yeah.

745
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,000
What are your takeaways from this?

746
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:36,000
The snake has a long tail and the future looks bright.

747
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:42,000
Yeah, and I think the other takeaway is, is that 45% of respondents who are developing

748
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:46,000
Web Frameworks are working in Django still.

749
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:47,000
That's huge.

750
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,000
Yeah, of those working in Python, yes.

751
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:50,000
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

752
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:55,000
Well, my biggest was actually over half of the dev survey, granted this is a JEP range

753
00:46:55,000 --> 00:47:00,000
survey, whatever that means, if that skews it, encountered Python in their educational

754
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:01,000
experience first.

755
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:03,000
Oh, yeah.

756
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:06,000
It's your site time, so someone can call me on this prediction next year.

757
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:11,000
If that's true, then the cohorts that are like the junior-junior developers now are

758
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:14,000
like going to be coming out of school this year, even like, you know, not really in the

759
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:15,000
field yet.

760
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:19,000
If all of these people have like good experiences with Python when they're young, I wouldn't

761
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:21,000
be shocked if Python continues to be popular.

762
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:22,000
Oh, absolutely.

763
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:26,000
I mean, my point is as they go up the ladder and they get decision-making authority, right?

764
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
Ah, hmm.

765
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:34,000
I think the only other thing that was notable from this JEP range survey was that Visual

766
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:37,000
Studio Code showed up as the number two editor.

767
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:40,000
I don't know if that's with their extensions or not.

768
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:43,000
Well, did you see the asterisk JEP range put on that?

769
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,000
Please note we asked our own users.

770
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:46,000
Thank you.

771
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:50,000
That's why I find it so surprising is this is amongst their, it's probably, it's even

772
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:53,000
larger in the general population, no doubt about it.

773
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:57,000
I would argue that that's one and two the other way where VS Code is probably bigger

774
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:59,000
than PyCharm Pro.

775
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:06,000
Even amongst JetBrains' own customers, Visual Studio Code has a very healthy second place

776
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:09,000
nipping at the heels of PyCharm Professional Edition.

777
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:10,000
They got to be looking at that.

778
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,000
Dude, I live in VS Code.

779
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,000
If I were them though, I'd be like, okay, all right.

780
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:20,000
Well, we welcome our new VS Code Overlord and all things are extensions in VS Code now.

781
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,000
No, I kid, I kid.

782
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:26,000
Actually, you're joking, but they have a very healthy business called ReSharper where they

783
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:29,000
sell a Visual Studio proper extension.

784
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,000
Why not sell a VS Code extension?

785
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:32,000
Yeah.

786
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:33,000
Sure, there's a way to do it.

787
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:34,000
Could it happen?

788
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:35,000
Why not?

789
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:38,000
You just have to log into your JetBrains account to get it to run.

790
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,000
To activate it or whatever.

791
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:43,000
I mean, I doubt Microsoft with all their you can do whatever you want developers, I doubt

792
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,000
they're going to block that.

793
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:47,000
No, I would think that they'd actually like the idea.

794
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:52,000
They would love it if VS Code became a dev platform for like actually targeting, not

795
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:53,000
for just working.

796
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:55,000
They'd probably happily integrate an app store.

797
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:57,000
Hell, I would probably buy that extension.

798
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:58,000
Yeah, sure.

799
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:02,000
Oh, well, let's not, let's not give him any ideas.

800
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:06,000
Microsoft Visual Studio Code app store with its own currency.

801
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,000
And I'm over here back in Vim.

802
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:12,000
Exactly.

803
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:13,000
Oh, God.

835

datadog.com slash CoderRadio.

836
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,000
All right, I don't know why I want to do this.

837
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:01,000
I guess I'm a glutton for punishment.

838
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:04,000
But I want to talk a little Facebook.

839
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:05,000
Why?

840
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:08,000
I know, I know, I know.

841
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:14,000
The Internet brought the capability for people like yourself and people like me,

842
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:19,000
even though we don't often choose to do it, to have the tools and marketing power

843
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:24,000
that traditionally only the mainstream media outlets gave you access to.

844
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,000
They were the gatekeepers to the public.

845
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:29,000
Magazines, papers, television, radio.

846
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:31,000
There was no Internet at.

847
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:35,000
Then the Internet came along and companies like Facebook and Google came up

848
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:38,000
with very clever ways to build ad platforms.

849
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:42,000
And then they made it accessible to small developers, to small business

850
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:45,000
developers and other small businesses around the world, mom and pop shops,

851
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:47,000
et cetera, et cetera.

852
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:48,000
Are they perfect?

853
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:49,000
Are they a good company?

854
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:51,000
Do I use Facebook?

855
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:52,000
No.

856
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:57,000
But they provide a critical role for medium to small businesses to get access

857
00:51:57,000 --> 00:52:00,000
to consumers who might want to buy their goods via advertising.

858
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:03,000
It's a good old clean system in that regard.

859
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:07,000
How they get that data, I don't necessarily agree with.

860
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:10,000
But what I feel like is happening right now, for better or for worse,

861
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:13,000
is Facebook is getting attacked.

862
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:17,000
And they're getting attacked by media companies that have a massive,

863
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,000
multiple conflicts of interest.

864
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:24,000
Number one, media companies, what they really are, are platforms for advertising.

865
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:25,000
They get eyeballs.

866
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:27,000
They sell ads to advertisers.

867
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:31,000
The advertisers then get their product in front of those eyeballs.

868
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:33,000
Facebook is also that exact system.

869
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:38,000
They are competing for the same eyeballs and the same exact advertisers.

870
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:43,000
You got to appreciate that the media companies that are going after Facebook,

871
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:47,000
they're competing with Facebook for the same paycheck.

872
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:50,000
It is life and death for these companies.

873
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:55,000
On top of that, social media is a time sink that takes people away

874
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:56,000
from their platform.

875
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:59,000
So not only is Facebook sucking up advertisers,

876
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:01,000
but they're sucking up eyeballs and people's time.

877
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:06,000
That's also an existential threat to everything from the Wall Street Journal

878
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:09,000
to CNN and some dude's blog.

879
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:15,000
And while I'm not here to defend Facebook, as you and I are recording

880
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:20,000
on a Monday at noon Pacific time, there are 30 plus journalists

881
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:25,000
finishing up a coordinated series of articles based on new leaked documents

882
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:27,000
out of Facebook, and it just keeps coming.

883
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:32,000
Over the last six weeks, there has been round and rounds of whistleblowers

884
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:37,000
and leaks, and a lot of it has been mischaracterized as boogeyman technology.

885
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:41,000
And I don't like the tracking, but it's been hyperbolic coverage

886
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:46,000
that is in a coordinated attempt to shut Facebook down, to knock it down,

887
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:49,000
to get it regulated, to reduce its reach, to do whatever they can

888
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:52,000
to just take a chunk out of Facebook.

889
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:57,000
And it's everything from whistleblowing about how Facebook affected the elections

890
00:53:57,000 --> 00:54:02,000
to how their AI platforms are inadequate at moderating

891
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:06,000
and that they need to have more moderators and more fact checking.

892
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:13,000
And it's like this omnidirectional attack on Facebook from all sides.

893
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:18,000
And I think no one wants to see Facebook succeed.

894
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:19,000
No one loves Facebook.

895
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:23,000
So we're all just sitting back and watching the show eating our popcorn.

896
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:28,000
But really what you have is a giant traditional media organizations,

897
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:32,000
just a traditional legacy media, attacking new media.

898
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:36,000
And the new media, like say Facebook goes away, right?

899
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:37,000
They're gone.

900
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:42,000
The world may be better overall, but small businesses and medium businesses

901
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:46,000
will lose access to customers.

902
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:50,000
And I know this is essentially Facebook's argument, but it is real.

903
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:53,000
If Facebook went away and Twitter is censoring you,

904
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:59,000
you can't go to NBC and run an ad about Alice in the nightly news.

905
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:02,000
You can't go to the New York Times and advertise Alice

906
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:05,000
because they'd want $300,000 from you.

907
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:09,000
Where Facebook and Google, and you notice how Google manages

908
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:11,000
to avoid all the scrutiny, that's another thing.

909
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:15,000
A lot of these issues they bring up, Google is also just as guilty of,

910
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:18,000
if not more guilty, especially with YouTube.

911
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:21,000
But that's not their target right now.

912
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:25,000
Right now their target is Facebook because they have billions of active users.

913
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:30,000
But they will pivot, mark my words, they will pivot to Google eventually

914
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,000
after they take care of Facebook.

915
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,000
I know I'm defending advertising and all of that,

916
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,000
but I just wish people would see what's happening.

917
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,000
Like maybe we're all okay with it.

918
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,000
Maybe we're fine with this happening.

919
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:43,000
But at least I just wish we'd all acknowledge that we're watching

920
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:47,000
one group of competitors all gang up and murder another competitor.

921
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:50,000
Yeah, I mean everybody's got their own incentives, right?

922
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:54,000
I don't know, to me it's possible that everybody's kind of evil.

923
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:55,000
True.

924
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:58,000
You know, I just tried some Facebook ads for Alice

925
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,000
and that was a rough experience.

926
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,000
Yeah, that's why I wanted to bring this up actually,

927
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,000
because I know you know how invasive the ad tech is.

928
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:08,000
Yeah, and really what I got was a bunch of people posting images

929
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:13,000
saying like, F Facebook, you know, whatever, like anti-advertising stuff.

930
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:16,000
Which I then had to pay for, so I killed that.

931
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,000
So it was basically fake views.

932
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:21,000
You're getting people who saw your ad, but they would respond pissy.

933
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:23,000
They would respond pissy at Facebook,

934
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:26,000
but then like that's posted on the Mad Botter page for Facebook.

935
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:29,000
Like obscenities and stuff like that.

936
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:32,000
That sucks. That sucks.

937
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:33,000
I don't know, right?

938
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:40,000
I don't feel that they do a great job of serving anybody really.

939
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:42,000
Except for themselves.

940
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:45,000
I mean, it's such a tough problem.

941
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:47,000
I do think they're making tons of money.

942
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:50,000
I do think they're like a very practical advertising platform

943
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:51,000
for small businesses.

944
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:54,000
But right now there's so much vitriol aimed at them.

945
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:58,000
And also they've lost a lot of their targeting ability, thanks to Apple.

946
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:02,000
I just think about your situation where you're not going to events.

947
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:05,000
You're literally, you had a problem where Twitter was blocking you.

948
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:07,000
And so you couldn't really promote on Twitter.

949
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:12,000
Like your avenues for promoting the launch of Alice are narrowed by this stuff.

950
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:17,000
And how are you ever going to get eyeballs if things keep trending this way?

951
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:20,000
Because between just moderation issues

952
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:24,000
and then media companies ganging up to murder Facebook,

953
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:27,000
like it's taking away your options.

954
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:29,000
And I hate to defend Facebook.

955
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:32,000
Like I said, I'm a glutton for punishment apparently,

956
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:36,000
but it does seem ultimately like a loss for people like yourself.

957
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:41,000
Well, and I'll be honest, like the MadBotter.com is still blocked by Twitter.

958
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:43,000
Wow, really?

959
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:46,000
And I can't get anyone from Twitter to respond.

960
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:50,000
Man, I mean, it just hurts more than ever during the pandemic with nothing going on.

961
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,000
Right. And with no explanation.

962
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:54,000
I mean, there was a false positive for malware,

963
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:57,000
but that was resolved weeks ago and you fill out their form

964
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:58,000
and there's no one to respond to.

965
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:01,000
Ironically, they emailed me asking if I want to buy ads.

966
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:06,000
So I respond with my complaint to the email and they don't respond.

967
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:08,000
When you were Facebook advertising,

968
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,000
do you think you kind of targeted geeks

969
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:12,000
and that's why they reacted badly to the advertising?

970
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:15,000
Because they didn't want to see ads because they're, you know, tech geeks?

971
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:19,000
Yeah, I guess I did target kind of like geeks and engineering.

972
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:22,000
Yeah, because it seems like something that our kind care about.

973
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:28,000
But I don't think, you know, my family who uses Facebook just as a way to like keep tabs on people,

974
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,000
I don't think they care.

975
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:33,000
I think they like sometimes the advertising, they buy crap off of it.

976
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:37,000
You know, I just feel like there's so much bad blood right now

977
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:43,000
that unless I want to take on another job of moderating the comments and stuff on the Facebook page,

978
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:46,000
I'm not sure that I want to do it.

979
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,000
Yeah, they all are dumpster fires

980
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:51,000
and part of me does like watching them getting taken down a peg

981
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:54,000
until this mob comes for your favorite tech company and eventually will

982
00:58:54,000 --> 00:59:02,000
because the reality is that anything, even to a degree, JB is a threat.

983
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,000
Now, we're not a threat at the scale Facebook or Google is,

984
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:09,000
so I don't think it'll ever be an issue for smaller content creators and platforms.

985
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:14,000
But truly, the problem here is that Facebook undermines their business model

986
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:20,000
and we are witnessing quite the hit job and it's a dirty one too.

987
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:23,000
You know, these insider leaks and stuff, it's dirty play.

988
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:30,000
And I don't know, I guess too, if you're maybe not in the media business as much as I remotely am,

989
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:35,000
maybe you don't see it because you don't quite understand the whole advertiser

990
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:40,000
and eyeballs dynamic and how that's life and death, perhaps.

991
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:43,000
But they'd know what they're doing.

992
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:47,000
And, you know, they slam Facebook for causing political division

993
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:52,000
and spreading misinformation when they're the kings of it.

994
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:54,000
You know, that's the ironic part.

995
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:56,000
Yeah, and, you know, just to undercut my own point,

996
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:59,000
I'm complaining that Facebook is too permissive.

997
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:02,000
Like Twitter, like somehow we got flagged at one point

998
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:05,000
and they won't do anything and there's no one to talk to, right?

999
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:13,000
Because Twitter's thing is we'd rather ban than have, you know, get negative blowback.

1000
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:15,000
And my thing is, if you're going to start playing editor

1001
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:17,000
and you're going to ban certain content,

1002
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:20,000
you got to have a system in place for when you get it wrong.

1003
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:22,000
Like in the old days of the internet,

1004
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:25,000
what would happen is maybe your domain would show up on an email blacklist

1005
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:29,000
and then, you know, a bunch of lazy email administrators who were one person

1006
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:31,000
managing a server of a thousand users.

1007
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:35,000
You're like, it was a long shot you were ever going to get off their list.

1008
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:41,000
But this is 2021 and they built this thing in recent last years too.

1009
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:46,000
They could have built this tooling such to solve this problem,

1010
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:47,000
but it wasn't a priority.

1011
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:49,000
It just didn't matter to them.

1012
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:53,000
And that to me is arrogance because you create this communications platform

1013
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:56,000
and then you begin to censor the communications platform.

1014
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:59,000
Sometimes it's justified, sometimes it's not.

1015
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:03,000
And you don't create any mechanism to solve for when it's not,

1016
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:06,000
even though it's the nature of these kinds of tools.

1017
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:07,000
It's arrogance.

1018
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:10,000
And, you know, it shows you where their priorities are.

1019
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:11,000
So whatever.

1020
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:15,000
I just, I guess I wanted to bring it up because of our recent conversation

1021
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:20,000
about kind of limited avenues for you to get the word out about a product launch

1022
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:27,000
and clear and obvious public murdering we are watching happen right now.

1023
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:30,000
You've kind of turned me around a little bit because for the little guy,

1024
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:34,000
like, you know, when Facebook says hurting us is hurting small business,

1025
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:36,000
they're obviously being disingenuous.

1026
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:37,000
Yeah.

1027
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:39,000
But it is kind of like, I gotta tell you,

1028
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:43,000
I'm super unhappy that I had to split off the Alice stuff into a different domain

1029
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:45,000
so I could post it on Twitter.

1030
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:46,000
Right. That's crazy.

1031
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:49,000
That was like, that was like a weekend of hell that I didn't need.

1032
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:54,000
And I'm pretty sure that what happened with the Mad Botter site was two issues.

1033
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:57,000
I think they didn't like the Thaleo giveaways.

1034
01:01:57,000 --> 01:02:01,000
Because if you go right now to the Mad Botter Twitter account

1035
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:05,000
and click on the URL in the Twitter account, you can go to it.

1036
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:06,000
You just can't post it.

1037
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:09,000
But they come up with a warning that it might be spammy.

1038
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:13,000
So I think because I don't use the corporate account very much

1039
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:17,000
and I don't tend to promote things on that URL much.

1040
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:21,000
And when I do, it's usually the, you know, whatever,

1041
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:23,000
we were doing one for election day.

1042
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:25,000
I think that's actually what they did.

1043
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:29,000
Well, too bad there's no way for them to simply expose what filter.

1044
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:32,000
Right. They could just say, we saw this post, it looks fake.

1045
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:34,000
Tell us it's not fake. Right.

1046
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:36,000
Do some sort of human challenge or something.

1047
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:38,000
Make me fill out one of those stupid captions.

1048
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:42,000
Right. Like make me fill out the form or help make me email someone

1049
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:44,000
and have them like ask me.

1050
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:45,000
Right.

1051
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:48,000
Or could it be happening millions of times a minute?

1052
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:50,000
And so they just can't simply deal with the scale.

1053
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:52,000
Then that would suggest that the system isn't working properly.

1054
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:54,000
So either they can't do it because of scale,

1055
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:57,000
which means it's broken or they're arrogant pricks.

1056
01:02:57,000 --> 01:03:01,000
Well, the problem is if the if the action they take is you simply can't post

1057
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:05,000
a small businesses domain, then.

1058
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:08,000
The answer that we can't handle the complaints telling us it's a false

1059
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:12,000
positive because it takes too long and we don't have the manpower.

1060
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:15,000
That's that's not a good system. Right.

1061
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:18,000
I mean, I had a thing I was talking on Twitter that this needs to be less like

1062
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:22,000
a private company, more like a utility where the punishment needs to be that

1063
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:24,000
you're you're not perma blocked.

1064
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:28,000
You're like they are happy to solicit me for ad money.

1065
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:29,000
That's the funny part.

1066
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:35,000
Yeah. So it's it's like they didn't even properly flag it in their system that

1067
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:40,000
like, you know, like the irony or maybe that you're a bad user even like it's

1068
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:43,000
it's very it is seems very specific to like that link.

1069
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:47,000
It's the domain. It's a it's there's a false positive on the URL.

1070
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:50,000
But there's no way to actually talk to a human.

1071
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:54,000
I mean, we used to joke years ago about the Google support Python script.

1072
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:58,000
Right. There's just no way to talk to someone to say this is just a mistake.

1073
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:01,000
Calm down. You know, let's let's work together on this.

1074
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:05,000
Even if there is something you don't like, fine, we can change it.

1075
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:09,000
But it's just like you can fill out this form and they explicitly tell you when

1076
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:14,000
you fill out the form that they're not going to reply.

1077
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:16,000
It's like dealing with the IRS.

1078
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:17,000
It's like, how will you know?

1079
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:19,000
Hey, your next paycheck will be garnished.

1080
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:21,000
You'll figure it out.

1081
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:22,000
Wow. I don't know.

1082
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:25,000
You know, what we clearly need is decentralized social media and a

1083
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:27,000
decentralized Web ad system.

1084
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:28,000
I'm looking at Matrix.

1085
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:29,000
I'm not joking.

1086
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:30,000
I am. Well, that could be.

1087
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:31,000
Yeah, that actually is true.

1088
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:33,000
That Matrix is pretty great.

1089
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:36,000
I do like it, but I don't think it's.

1090
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:39,000
I don't know. I don't think it's the full solution.

1091
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:41,000
I don't know. That's all that's all my defense I have for Facebook.

1092
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:44,000
I just wanted to point it out that's what's happening.

1093
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:49,000
And while maybe a net good for Facebook to go away, it will also have

1094
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:52,000
ramifications that are extremely beneficial to the very companies that

1095
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:54,000
are taking them out right now.

1096
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:57,000
And that will be bad for small business.

1097
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:59,000
But it is what it is.

1098
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:03,000
Perhaps another solution will be born out of the ashes and be better than

1099
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:08,000
ever like a phoenix rising my space, my space on the block chain.

1100
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:12,000
By the time you're hearing this episode, the new quarterly report for

1101
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:15,000
our members should be out with lots of good stuff in there.

1102
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:18,000
If you're not a member yet and you want to support the show and get access

1103
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:21,000
to our quarterly report, go to Coder QA dot co.

1104
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:22,000
You support the show.

1105
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:26,000
You get a limited ad feed and you get those quarterly reports that come

1106
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:27,000
out every quarter.

1107
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:28,000
And we appreciate that.

1108
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:32,000
Coder QA dot co with a new quarterly coming out soon.

1109
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:36,000
Go find Mike while he still is on Twitter at Dumanuco and his companies at

1110
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:37,000
the Madwater Inc.

1111
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:38,000
For how much longer?

1112
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:39,000
Who knows?

1113
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:40,000
Get it while it's still there.

1114
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:42,000
Great.

1115
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:43,000
I know, right?

1116
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:45,000
We should be careful because we used to joke about this kind of stuff with

1117
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:46,000
Apple and then they took it.

1118
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:48,000
It wasn't it wasn't that funny.

1119
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:49,000
Yeah.

1120
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:52,000
And so also go to Alice Dot Dev while you still can.

1121
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:53,000
