00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:45,640
My name is Chris and joining us every single week is our hostess with the Mac, it's Mr.

10
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:46,640
Dominic.

11
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:47,640
Hello Mike.

12
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:48,640
Wait, hostess?

13
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:49,760
Did I have a surgery I'm not aware of?

14
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:51,680
Do you still have the M1 by any chance?

15
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:52,680
Yes, I do.

16
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:54,960
I just thought maybe it got sent back since we talked last.

17
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:56,600
No, well, you know what?

18
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:58,680
This time the love has stuck.

19
00:00:58,680 --> 00:00:59,680
Oh, oh, okay.

20
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:01,640
Well, we're going to talk about that in the show today.

21
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:05,240
Yeah, I do have some axes to grind first.

22
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:06,240
Oh my gosh.

23
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:07,240
Here we go.

24
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:08,240
Here we go.

25
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:09,240
Here we go.

26
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:12,520
First of all, why do we not have a shaman?

27
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:13,520
Yeah, I know.

28
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:14,520
You know what?

29
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:18,320
We've been around way longer than the Q conspiracy theory.

30
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:23,120
I want a dude in a Viking helmet with like objective C brackets, like tattooed on his

31
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:24,120
chest.

32
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:25,120
Wearing a robe.

33
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:26,120
Oh, goddammit.

34
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:28,520
You know it's going to be a robe, bro, man.

35
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:29,520
Come on.

36
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:31,240
The robe rows were out in force this week.

37
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:33,000
Hey, don't you besmirch the robe rows.

38
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,080
No, I think it's a coup, frankly, by the robe.

39
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:40,120
They're overthrowing the power of the Coderadio program and we're pushing the robe agenda

40
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:41,120
forward.

41
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:42,120
There's no doubt about it.

42
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:44,480
We're just going to become a show exclusively about robes.

43
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:45,480
That's all it's going to be every week.

44
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:48,200
We're going to go to a hotel, get a robe.

45
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:51,080
This is a little more chintzy than last week.

46
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:55,280
Fat cat in the chat room says he's going to get a robe tattooed onto his entire body.

47
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:57,080
That seems like the way to go, to be honest with you.

48
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:58,080
I don't know how it works.

49
00:01:58,080 --> 00:01:59,880
Let us know, fat cat.

50
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:03,400
I moved office spaces this week.

51
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:08,640
So the studio has two upstairs office spaces and I moved to the other one.

52
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:10,560
But it was a nice chance to just redo everything.

53
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:14,980
So I got myself a standing desk forever ago, to be honest with you.

54
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:17,600
It's embarrassing how long ago I bought that, but never put it together.

55
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:23,760
So I finally got that put together and had the help of the wife and family over, helping

56
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,960
me just move stuff and clean stuff up.

57
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:29,840
Angela came over and helped grab a few things and wrangle kids.

58
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:34,320
We just kind of got a big chunk of work done and I got myself a whole new workspace set

59
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:35,320
up.

60
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:36,320
It's really nice.

61
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:39,360
It's like coming into a whole new work experience now.

62
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,360
It's changing my game.

63
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:43,560
I'm feeling the vibe, the new office vibe.

64
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:49,320
I actually ordered a replacement standing desk and every second that I'm on this very,

65
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:52,600
not strong enough to hold my computer, Amazon Day6 desk.

66
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:53,600
Oh yeah.

67
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:54,600
Yeah.

68
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:57,280
Autonomous, I think is the brand, Autonomous IO.

69
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,040
That's the one that I bought too.

70
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,040
That's what I got.

71
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:05,200
And so it's got four memory positions and I mean really everything's working pretty

72
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:08,960
well except for now I have to kind of redo my wiring setup because I need to get longer

73
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:12,240
cables and stuff like that for the all the way up mode.

74
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:16,640
I think I want to mount the power adapt to the power brick for all the plugs.

75
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:18,920
I want to mount that to the wall possibly.

76
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:23,320
So I got to do things a little differently now, but for the first time, I'm investing

77
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:24,320
in me.

78
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:31,440
I'm even getting myself, get ready for this, a desk stand for my MagSafe adapter so I have

79
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:34,040
an actual spot and I can tidy the cord up.

80
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:35,800
I mean that's how fancy I'm getting.

81
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:36,800
That is pretty fancy.

82
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:40,560
I'm going to have like a metal pedestal for my phone, just set it down and it charges.

83
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:44,640
I'm done with the wires all over the place and the pucks all over the place, looking

84
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,440
like Doc Brown's desk or something.

85
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:47,440
I'm done with that.

86
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:48,440
You know?

87
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:51,680
I feel like I'm a gentleman now.

88
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,960
I got a gentleman desk.

89
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:56,960
I got one of them big mouse pads too, so like the whole thing's down, you know?

90
00:03:56,960 --> 00:04:02,700
I have to tell you, working on this little desk, I understand what Dark Matter developers

91
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:04,400
must feel like.

92
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:07,720
It's like I have literally, this is the worst thing ever.

93
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:13,200
If I move my hand to slightly the wrong way, something is spilling into this iMac Pro,

94
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:18,680
which frankly is what it deserves because it's just trounced by the M1, but it was still

95
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:20,160
$5,000.

96
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:25,320
How are you getting the angle of the spillage because the iMac's not like, I see a laptop,

97
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:28,720
that's a target because the most vulnerable components are laying just right there on

98
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:29,720
the table.

99
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:32,400
You could easily knock something into the keyboard, which spills into the main board

100
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:33,400
and it's dead.

101
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:36,880
But an iMac, that's like up on a foot, you know?

102
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:40,220
It's way harder to get the beverages to the really important components.

103
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:41,220
You really got to aim.

104
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:43,960
You doubt my ability to destroy Apple equipment.

105
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:44,960
No.

106
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,440
It seems like a bet.

107
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:49,680
I think what it is, is I'm just trying to fantasize how you're going to pull it off.

108
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:54,960
Like a ricochet or you were stacking shelves and maybe there was like a beverage up there

109
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:58,160
that the kid set that you didn't even know was there and the shelf falls and it falls

110
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,160
inside.

111
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:01,160
The drink comes off the shelf and pours into the iMac.

112
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:04,640
Just do a little flair bartending and like miss.

113
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:06,120
Which is probably happening all the time at your place.

114
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:07,120
I'm sure.

115
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,120
Yeah.

116
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:11,280
Well, not anymore, but those were the days.

117
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:12,280
Okay.

118
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:13,280
Well, so we got a lot of feedback.

119
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:14,800
I mean, a lot of feedback.

120
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:18,600
And so if your email doesn't make it into this show, it may make it into the next one.

121
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:21,200
But we did ask people a little bit about their setups.

122
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:25,360
And now I'm really curious because they just redid mine and it really came down to like,

123
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:30,640
man, if I'm going to redo my desk and I have to pull everything out of here anyways, maybe

124
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:32,680
I should just move rooms where it's got a better view.

125
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:33,680
It's got airflow.

126
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:36,800
You know, it was a, it was a big setup.

127
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,800
So then people are starting to write in and tell me about their steps.

128
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,240
I'm like, oh, that's a good idea.

129
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,280
Maybe I'll do that.

130
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:47,280
So Eric wrote in with his setup for a, he's a suspicion and a software developer by day.

131
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:54,360
I think he dabbles with R and he said for work, I use a 2018 MacBook Pro and he does

132
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:56,040
sometimes have a choice.

133
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:58,640
He has a choice between that or severely locked down windows.

134
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:01,520
So you know, might as well go with the Mac.

135
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:05,720
He does some day work with MacBook and Docker containers and VS code.

136
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:07,940
They mostly use office 365.

137
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:11,060
He has a persistent team up session going on all the time, logged into some of their

138
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:15,160
nodes with a web based IDE called R studio server.

139
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:19,200
But he's been starting to use VS code a lot more with a remote extension for personal

140
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:20,340
projects at home.

141
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:21,500
And I love this.

142
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:24,520
It allows him to, you know, like modify Docker and stuff like that remotely.

143
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:29,160
But then he took it to the next level, Mike, and you may already know about this, but I

144
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:34,180
wanted to mention it for the audience in case you didn't know is what Eric is kind of migrating

145
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:41,220
to and I have set up at home and love it is VS code in a web browser and it's code server.

146
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:45,740
It's open source and it's essentially VS code in a tab.

147
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:50,040
And it's just so handy to like throw that up on a Linode or on like a local server that

148
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:55,080
I have in the RV where I don't use it super often because I prefer to have VS code local.

149
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:59,280
But every now and then I'm on a machine and it's just nice to have a centralized editor

150
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:03,580
and you can even edit local files on your server if you set it up particularly the way

151
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:05,380
I have it.

152
00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:10,120
So are there, I guess there would be performance implications because it's literally an electron

153
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:11,120
app, right?

154
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:13,480
So yeah, it's really kind of cool.

155
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:17,960
I keep wanting this to be a thing and someone's going to have to correct me, but I think it

156
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:20,560
was cloud nine.

157
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:25,840
Yeah, years ago we talked like way when we were first talking about Docker with this

158
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:28,720
whole idea that like you are, you know, you'd go back to the eighties, right?

159
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:33,040
Your terminal would be just like a really, you know, that eight hundred dollar laptop

160
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:36,240
from Best Buy and your ID would live in the cloud.

161
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:39,200
This is kind of that dream, only it's now it's VS code.

162
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:41,760
Yeah, because I guess all my extensions would actually just work, right?

163
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:48,080
Because it's just running on another Ubuntu box or if you're, you know, have taste, SUSE.

164
00:07:48,080 --> 00:08:00,320
By the way, I happened to be listening to a certain unplugged podcast of the Linux variety.

165
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:01,320
Anything you'd like to share?

166
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:04,480
Well, yeah, I was running SUSE in secret for a week.

167
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:06,800
I got to admit I was doing that.

168
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:11,080
I felt like it would derail the show, so I didn't mention it.

169
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:13,840
And then afterwards I thought, you know, maybe, you know, once I probably should have just

170
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:14,840
brought it up.

171
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:18,560
But, you know, I got to say it was all right.

172
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,120
It wasn't it wasn't great.

173
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:25,680
I unlike probably you, I find you asked to be a vestige of years gone past.

174
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,320
But you really want to use Zipper, though.

175
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:28,320
Yeah, I mean, I know.

176
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:29,320
I know.

177
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:31,080
But I'm just talking about for configuring the system in general.

178
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:35,040
I actually am not a huge fan of Zipper either.

179
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:40,000
I definitely like it more than something like RPM or apt RPM or or something like that.

180
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:48,100
But I think these days it's probably of like, say, Archdebian Red Hat varieties.

181
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:51,580
It's probably my and then you throw SUSE and it's probably my least favorite package manager

182
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:52,580
of that group.

183
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:56,440
OK, I mean, I will say there are niceties in apt that I miss.

184
00:08:56,440 --> 00:09:00,800
It just seems slow to really slow to do any zipper.

185
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:03,760
It just really seems like I'm really waiting for the package manager.

186
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:08,080
There's a lot of steps in Zipper that I think, you know, I kind of started to kind of hone

187
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:14,000
in on the aspect I could really see liking about SUSE and that would be leap on my server,

188
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,320
tumbleweed on my laptop and desktop.

189
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:20,960
That kind of that kind of idea does resonate with me a lot.

190
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:24,680
And you know, long term, I think they've made some some clever choices in some areas.

191
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:30,000
So it's like all things with Linux, it's kind of pick your set of compromises and your sets

192
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
of wins.

193
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Really.

194
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Is that another way to say half broken?

195
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:44,200
Oh, see, well, I think what I prioritize is simple, minimal and whenever possible, built

196
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,200
in.

197
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:49,160
So if there's a way to just do a way to do something that system D just does it already

198
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:55,480
or like I prefer to go that route like one of the reasons it's silly, but we we talk

199
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:56,480
about it on plug.

200
00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:00,760
We actually chose to run Arch Linux on our server here in the studio, and it's actually

201
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:03,560
kind of an important server to us.

202
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:11,040
But everything, with the exception of net data and Samba, everything runs in a container.

203
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:16,400
And so we keep arch on an LTS kernel and we update it semi frequently.

204
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:19,720
And really everything that we need is taking place in Docker.

205
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:24,460
And what I love about the setup is it is a minimum viable server.

206
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:26,020
It doesn't have anything extra.

207
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:27,920
It doesn't have any additional packages.

208
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:32,100
It literally has just what you need to get that environment functional.

209
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:35,120
And so it has a really low maintenance surface because of that.

210
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:37,360
And it has it's just kind of secure by default.

211
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:43,160
And it feels like with SUSE, it's kind of the kitchen sink distro, you know, even the

212
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:46,960
way you download it, they've got like the four point two gig DVD image or do you want

213
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:52,320
the net install or do you want the five I five eighty six optimize or the X 64 optimized

214
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:56,760
images and all of that just sort of feels kind of like the old school baked in approach

215
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:59,340
of Linux and there are advantages to it.

216
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:02,920
I prefer the minimum distro kind of thing myself for servers.

217
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:08,040
If you're playing the code radio drinking game, we've had Robros, SUSE, lizards, arch

218
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:13,040
and rust and R. And by the way, Eric, I believe, is the host of the R podcast.

219
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:14,040
Very good.

220
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:15,040
You should go listen to it.

221
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:18,840
You are probably suffering from alcohol poisoning right now.

222
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:19,840
So sorry.

223
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:20,840
All right.

224
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:24,400
If you're taking shots, the code radio drinking game, you're getting wrecked.

225
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:25,760
Oh, and objective C.

226
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:26,760
All right.

227
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:27,760
Go throw that in.

228
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:28,760
And the M1.

229
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:29,760
Did you say that?

230
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:30,760
Because if you didn't, I did.

231
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:31,760
Two shots for the M1.

232
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:32,760
Oh, and I said something insulting about Linux.

233
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:35,160
So that there we go.

234
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:40,360
So let's talk about a dev living the M1 lifestyle right now.

235
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:44,800
Kent writes in, says, hey, guys, responding to your question on last week's show, I work

236
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:48,520
at an education company and currently I'm building a new website to replace the in-person

237
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:51,540
training they used to do well because of Covid, obviously.

238
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:57,360
My dev machine of choice is the M1 MacBook Air with 16 gigabytes of RAM and a 35 inch

239
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:58,960
external monitor.

240
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:04,680
It's ultra wide 3440 by 1440 resolution because the company wants to integrate with their

241
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:06,200
WordPress and WooCommerce site.

242
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:10,760
I'm working in PHP for the back end, but building out a front end for a section of the WordPress

243
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:12,600
site with Flutter web.

244
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:16,680
Eventually this code will be reused to also launch mobile apps for Android and iOS.

245
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:22,720
And he says, by the way, sign me up for two robes, one for me and one for the lady.

246
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:23,920
I love it, Kent.

247
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:24,920
You got it.

248
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:28,440
Two robes, bros.

249
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:29,440
So good.

250
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:33,960
It's like I just, you know, I had an intuitive moment with the audience.

251
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:35,680
I just struck a chord with them.

252
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:38,440
Morgan writes in with a quick rundown of their setup.

253
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:40,160
You mentioned wanting to know a little bit about our setups.

254
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:44,440
Well, my main programming language is Go Bash and I work with Terraform and Ansible.

255
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:48,360
A little bit of Podman and K8s is in there, too, with WireGuard connecting everything

256
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:52,380
using Fedora and CentOS Stream now working good.

257
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:56,000
And then we use SystemD with a bit of Bash glue to tie it all together.

258
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,840
I'm split between maintaining our Linux distribution, managing the cloud component of our product,

259
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:04,000
and then of course, keeping our infrastructure for our factory working and hacking on the

260
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,980
code bases for these different projects and sending it upstream when possible.

261
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:15,040
He's working at a place, or they're working at a place called Holopot.com, H-O-L-O-P-L-O-T.com

262
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:17,900
in case I'm ready to replace my HomePods with something more pro.

263
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:23,240
And I checked out their site and holy shit, Holopot Plot, sorry, I keep messing that up.

264
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:26,240
It's H-O-L-O-P-L-O-T.com.

265
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:27,240
Looks incredible.

266
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:28,240
Like incredible speakers.

267
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:30,200
Yeah, you got to go look.

268
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:34,700
We had a few people write in, somebody wrote in with a solution on how to use Homebrew

269
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:40,200
on ARM and Intel, depending on which version you want with only one terminal, using different

270
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,560
environment variables or something.

271
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:44,360
I'll put a link to that in the show notes if people are interested.

272
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:45,960
Yeah, that was an interesting approach.

273
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:48,600
I think your approach is just simpler and easier to...

274
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:54,240
The only thing that's annoying with my approach is I wish I could set a different visual profile

275
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:55,920
for like Rosetta Terminal and...

276
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:57,240
Why aren't you using iTerm?

277
00:13:57,240 --> 00:14:00,960
I mean, you've had a week, give it a go, come on.

278
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:03,720
It's a better terminal than the Mac OS Terminal, I tell you what.

279
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:05,680
Okay, why is it better?

280
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:06,880
First of all, it just looks a little bit better.

281
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:12,720
It has a lot more configuration options and it has the themes that you're looking for.

282
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:16,440
What I like about it now, you don't have to do it this way, but you can even set it as

283
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:19,880
sort of like that drop down Quake Terminal style terminal.

284
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:20,880
You can actually...

285
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:24,100
There's lots of guides to configure iTerm like that, so you can hit a key on your keyboard

286
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:25,760
and it just drops down from the top of your screen.

287
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:29,000
All right, well, I'll tell you what, as we do the rest of the feedback, I will live install

288
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
it.

289
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
How about that?

290
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,400
I really like the iTerm layout that I have, so you might like it.

291
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:34,400
I think it is pretty good.

292
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:38,920
I mean, in theory, that would solve my problem because then iTerm could just be like...

293
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:43,480
Because the little dirty secret is I'm almost always in Rosetta Terminal because...

294
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:46,560
The dirty secret is I'm always angry.

295
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:50,740
The dirty secret is I use a lot of Ruby gems and Python packages that are not compiled

296
00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:51,740
for ARM.

297
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:59,780
We also got a tip that you can switch to the Visual Studio Code Insider builds, which I

298
00:14:59,780 --> 00:15:04,520
guess are starting to support the M1.

299
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:08,720
It wasn't super clear from the feedback, but I guess if you get the Insider builds, you

300
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:10,600
get M1 support.

301
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:12,920
That might be something to think about too.

302
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:17,560
So of course, some setups aren't as swanky as the M1.

303
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:22,440
Josh writes in, he says, I work as a system admin, primarily in a Windows environment.

304
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:26,640
I've been doing a lot of PowerShell scripting and PowerShell Linux is a different bag than

305
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:28,160
in Windows.

306
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:30,920
Things like AD integration, registry edits, etc.

307
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:35,400
When I'm not in the office on my Windows machine, I have a ThinkPad T440P running for

308
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:41,800
door 33 and I have Windows 10 and I have server VMs.

309
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:46,660
I'm guessing he probably means Windows Server VMs with VS Code for development.

310
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:51,080
One thing that I noticed is that I really end up spending more time in the VMs than

311
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:52,880
on my host machine.

312
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:56,680
So he said I felt like my environment was just kind of unique and janky enough that

313
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:59,520
I wanted to share it all.

314
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:06,640
And then, devastatingly adds, I also want to throw some shade on the robe bros.

315
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:09,400
I just perked right up.

316
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:15,120
The only people I know who wear robes are my 60 plus year old parents.

317
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,120
Inappropriate.

318
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:19,660
Well actually, if you live in the south, there are some other people who wear robes but you

319
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:21,960
definitely don't want to hang out with them.

320
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:25,960
I feel like our feedback speaks for itself.

321
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:27,520
There are robe bros out there.

322
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:28,520
We are proud.

323
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:32,280
Robe bros also includes ladies, I will mention.

324
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:36,360
And we are uniting and we are going to change the agenda.

325
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:41,080
And it's not just men, it's not just women, it's even those tiny humans.

326
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:46,920
Reece writes in, very short and simple, I'm 13 years old and I want a robe, hashtag robe

327
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:47,920
bros.

328
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:48,920
So thank you, Reece.

329
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:49,920
All right, all right.

330
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:50,920
Stop corrupting the youth.

331
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:54,440
This has gone way too far.

332
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:56,040
I'm telling you, it speaks to the people.

333
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:57,040
It speaks.

334
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:58,040
It speaks to the people.

335
00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:01,640
You're going to have a riot on your head if you don't come up with robes.

336
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:04,120
You know, I think robes are going to bring peace because you know what?

337
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:05,920
When you're wearing a robe, you're comfortable.

338
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:07,880
And who wants to riot when they're comfortable?

339
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:09,920
So last week, that's what we needed.

340
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:16,360
Come into JB Studios, we got robes, cannabis, and scotch and you just sit back and listen

341
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:17,360
to a podcast.

342
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:22,140
Yeah, I feel like the robes are not the operative functioning things there.

343
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:29,520
So I appreciate Reece lodging their vote and I love that we have 13 year old listeners

344
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:30,520
too.

345
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:31,520
So we have a few more setups.

346
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:33,060
I just want to blast through really quick.

347
00:17:33,060 --> 00:17:38,800
Like I said, there's a whole bunch sent in and if you don't hear yours here, I may cover

348
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:42,520
it next week or I may just reply directly back to you.

349
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:46,800
Before I do that, I want to mention that a cloud guru has the Red Hat certified system

350
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:48,880
administrator exam prep.

351
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:53,440
In this course, they cover the skills and concepts necessary to pass the Red Hat R-H-C-S-A

352
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:57,440
exam using a mix of lessons and hands-on labs.

353
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:01,840
They tie it all together with a challenge lab that really helps you test your skills.

354
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:05,580
So if you're looking at getting Red Hat certified, check out the link in the show notes and get

355
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:10,720
started at the cloudguru.com or go specifically to this course with the link that we'll have

356
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:11,720
in our show notes.

357
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:15,800
It's a cloud guru's Red Hat certified system administrator exam prep.

358
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:18,720
The best way to learn is by doing.

359
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:22,320
For more feedback, this one is an AWS stack from Paul.

360
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:27,440
Hey there, just writing it with my typical dev stack by day I specialize in AWS and serverless

361
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:28,920
technologies.

362
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:34,160
All of our APIs are deployed to AWS Lambda and written in Express.js.

363
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:38,760
We use a combination of DynamoDB and Aurora Serverless for our databases.

364
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:42,900
Our front ends are written in Vue.js or Angular depending on the developer and for mobile,

365
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:44,760
we leverage the Merian forms.

366
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:50,920
Outside of the day job, I write my games in either straight C or minimal C++ and open

367
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:56,560
GL and SDL and sometimes I'll pair it with a little good old C sharp and mono game.

368
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:58,680
That's Paul on the AWS Lambda stack.

369
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:03,560
In fact, you know, Mr. Dominic, we've got a handful of people using AWS.

370
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:07,840
So I kind of condensed them down into Paul's email, but that set up, you know, some sort

371
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:14,540
of JavaScript framework, AWS serverless, probably mentioned three or four times by

372
00:19:14,540 --> 00:19:17,120
people that sent in emails, which that's kind of interesting.

373
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:18,120
I think.

374
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:22,200
Yeah, last year I briefly did a project on a Lambda using F sharp, believe it or not.

375
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:26,860
It was, it's one of those things that was so straightforward in terms of getting it

376
00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:31,600
set up that it's almost, we didn't really cover it too much, but I mean, it's exactly

377
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:32,860
what it says on the tin, right?

378
00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:33,860
It's a serverless thing.

379
00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:39,060
It turns on, runs your functions, you know, data in, all I was doing is data in data out.

380
00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:43,960
You know what it is about iterm I just realized not to jump around like a maniac, the developers

381
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:45,920
wear robes when they code.

382
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:46,920
How did you know?

383
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:49,440
You're a little predictable.

384
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:51,600
It feels like a Linux terminal on Mac OS.

385
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:55,100
It feels like the configuration you get with a Linux terminal emulator.

386
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:59,160
So Susan wrote in with a really solid arch set up, Susan from Nepal.

387
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:02,180
They said that they've been listening to the show for quite some time and really love it.

388
00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:06,600
In regards to the question we asked about people's work setups and their stack, their

389
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:11,040
development machine is a six year old ASUS laptop, but it's held up really well.

390
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:17,520
It has a fourth gen i7, 16 gigs of RAM, an NVIDIA 950M in there, and it just keeps working.

391
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:20,680
The dedicated graphics was a total waste of money as I haven't played a single game on

392
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:25,880
this machine in about 12 years, she says, yeah, I know, right?

393
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:28,960
The project we're working on our company is large and takes some time to build around

394
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:29,960
five minutes.

395
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:34,400
So instead of buying a new powerful machine, we refactor the entire application into modules

396
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:38,720
and leverage that to reduce the build time significantly.

397
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:43,720
Now the build time is in, for the different modules, between five to 40 seconds in general.

398
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:49,560
The OSs that they've hopped through are Linux Mint and Kali and Ubuntu, but in the last

399
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:52,040
few years have settled on Arch.

400
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:57,640
It's only broken once, that was for Kernel 5.9 and an Intel video driver, but they quickly

401
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:58,720
found the solution on the forum.

402
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:05,760
And other than that, it's really simple, lightweight, that combined with, he says, or they say,

403
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:11,400
they were a GNOME fanboy, but they were having annoying problems where the display would

404
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:15,040
stutter from time to time and just got little issues, little paper cuts on GNOME, switched

405
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:17,160
over to Plasma, never looked back since then.

406
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:23,320
So the Arch Plasma setup has been totally rocking for them and rock solid, super smooth,

407
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:28,660
uses less resources without compromising features and makes for a great workstation.

408
00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:33,420
And I just love that, to get Susan's take from Nepal and the idea of these, sometimes

409
00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:35,200
we talk about these absolute latest machines.

410
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:41,180
This is a 12-year-old laptop running Arch and she's getting perfectly good performance

411
00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:43,800
from it and working, getting the day job done.

412
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:48,380
And the approach, instead of throwing more hardware at it, was to break the application

413
00:21:48,380 --> 00:21:54,360
up into modules and then build the modules as needed, which go much faster, totally a

414
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:55,360
valid approach.

415
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:57,640
Yeah, that's not that crazy at all.

416
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:59,880
Probably easier for maintenance long-term as well.

417
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:02,800
So that's also a win when doing that.

418
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:03,800
Okay.

419
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:07,680
So the last one, the last one we have for this episode, we have a batch for next week

420
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:12,680
too, but Mike wrote in and after selling his company and sticking around for a while and

421
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:16,400
kind of getting the bonus for sticking around, they kicked off what they thought would be

422
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:19,800
a four-month project, they're now 14 months into it.

423
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:28,160
They're using AWS, Lambda, DynamoDB, Elasticsearch, S3 of course, CloudWatch.

424
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:31,440
For the CICD, they're using CodePipeline and CodeBuild.

425
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:35,800
Their infrastructure as code is Terraform running in the Terraform cloud.

426
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:39,660
Go on the server side with some JavaScript and Java where there's existing third-party

427
00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:42,040
libraries that are superior and available.

428
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:45,920
They use, and this is something I wanted to ask, but they use Go's built-in unit testing

429
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:46,920
capabilities.

430
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:49,800
Side note, I think that's the question for next week's episode.

431
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:51,480
How do you test?

432
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:52,480
Is it old school?

433
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:53,480
Is it manual?

434
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:54,480
You're not testing.

435
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:59,200
You have very specific methodology for building and testing.

436
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:00,360
Coder.show slash contact.

437
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:01,360
How do you test?

438
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:02,360
I'd love to know that.

439
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:03,880
But here's the interesting thing that Mike says.

440
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:07,880
My development machine is the XPS 13, the 9380 version.

441
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:14,640
Usually docked to a Dell UltraSharp 27 4K monitor, JetBrains for the IDE, and SmartGit

442
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:16,520
for Git interactions.

443
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:18,520
Serverless has been great.

444
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:24,520
Switching to serverless has zero regrets for doing so, and follows the latest best practices

445
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:28,840
and uses the right CI and CD tools for each deployed environment.

446
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:29,840
And they love it.

447
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:32,680
He says, I'd love to hear what people are doing for unit testing.

448
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:37,640
I've grown increasingly dependent on my unit tests to confidently make changes in my platform.

449
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:41,080
I'm approaching 4,000 unit tests across my code bases.

450
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:44,000
I recently upgraded from Angular 9 to 11.

451
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,720
It took me about an hour, and that included patching a few issues I discovered thanks

452
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:48,720
to my tests.

453
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:52,040
I couldn't imagine doing it without the tests.

454
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:54,040
I think it's a great question that Mike brings up.

455
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:56,440
Mike, listener Mike, how do you test?

456
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:57,440
Let us know.

457
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:58,440
Coder.show slash contact.

458
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:03,400
Yeah, testing is one of those things, you're never going to be where you need to be on

459
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:04,400
it.

460
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:07,560
You know, and it bites you in all forms, too, because there's also not just, there's not

461
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:10,800
just, this is the one that bit me, is my environment.

462
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:13,380
I updated my environment, and that broke.

463
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:18,840
And so then production, and a production application broke, and I didn't realize it because I forgot

464
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:20,600
to test the underlying platform stuff.

465
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:22,680
I just tested the application.

466
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:24,600
So that, you know, you're always learning.

467
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:31,160
It feels, that has to be, I think, I think the mindset is, I'm just going to keep evolving

468
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:32,960
this all the time.

469
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:35,640
It's like a checklist that I have for the RV.

470
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:40,720
I've been driving that RV now for like five years, and I still, from time to time, add

471
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:42,360
up, I need to start checking this.

472
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:46,480
In fact, I'm not kidding you, last night I had a nightmare that I forgot to check something

473
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:49,320
and I was driving down the road with my awning sticking out.

474
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:52,760
That's when I woke up, I woke up like, crap, did I?

475
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:54,880
Okay, it was just a dream.

476
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:58,680
See, if you were wearing a robe, you never would have made that mistake.

477
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:02,640
No, right, because you have one robe for when you're lounging and one robe for when you're

478
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:03,640
road ready, obviously.

479
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:04,640
Oh my god.

480
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:08,880
Yeah, well, there is room for a multi-robe lifestyle, no doubt about it.

481
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:11,720
You have your winter robe, your evening robe, and your combat robe.

482
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:12,960
Well, you clearly have to.

483
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:15,280
I mean, you don't want to wear your winter robe in the summer.

484
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:17,600
You wouldn't be comfortable, and the robe's all about being comfortable.

485
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:20,300
You can't wear a white robe after Labor Day, so.

486
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:21,720
And not be a gentleman.

487
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:24,680
And you know, sometimes it's special night with the ladies, you want to have a nice red

488
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:25,680
velvet robe.

489
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:26,680
I mean, you might.

490
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:27,680
I don't know.

491
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:28,680
Maybe you don't.

492
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:29,680
It's more black velvet.

493
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:33,040
I'm with you so far.

494
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:34,360

00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:41,200
Linode is the largest independent cloud for developers.

497
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:45,280
They're our cloud hosting provider for Jupiter broadcasting right now as we are doing this

498
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:46,280
show.

499
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:52,400
We're streaming on a brand new Jupiter.tube PeerTube instance hosted on Linode.

500
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:56,800
And here's what's great about it is on the back end, I'm using Linode's object storage

501
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:58,160
to store the videos.

502
00:25:58,160 --> 00:26:02,720
So when we post a video on there, it goes through all the various different coding styles

503
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:08,640
that you need for like mobile and low resolution and HD, and then it stores them on object

504
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:09,640
storage in Linode.

505
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:14,240
And the reason why that is fantastic is not only are those files now available via URL

506
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:17,960
if we want to link to them directly and it means they download super quick and they load

507
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:22,520
up in the player super quick, but it means we don't have to like carve off like a terabyte

508
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:27,760
of block storage and then use like 300 gigs and know that OK, well maybe in like six months

509
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:31,800
we might be using 700 gigs, so we better go for a terrible like you don't have to do any

510
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:33,160
of that with object storage.

511
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:36,880
You just use it as you need it and it's super easy to get access to it because it's all

512
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:42,820
S3 compatible and Linode costs 30 to 50% less than major cloud providers like AWS, Google

513
00:26:42,820 --> 00:26:44,160
Cloud and Azure.

514
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:50,720
You get a nice balance of technology and price and you can get something like $5 a month.

515
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:56,480
What I did for our PeerTube instance is I first we tried it just like a two core machine,

516
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:59,300
four gigs of RAM and did a proof of concept.

517
00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:02,720
We ran that for about 24 hours.

518
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:06,440
We got an idea of what we wanted and maybe what we might change and then we just nuked

519
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:10,560
that one and we just set up a new one in the production data center we want to deploy on

520
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:15,080
and this time I went for something with four CPU cores so that way we can render video

521
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:19,580
that gets uploaded and leave a couple of cores available for live streaming and it's all

522
00:27:19,580 --> 00:27:21,680
set up and it's ready to go in seconds.

523
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:25,440
And if you want to get a gaming server going, they have all of the options right in there

524
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:30,380
to set up a lot of popular game servers like a like a Minecraft server for example or or

525
00:27:30,380 --> 00:27:34,800
an arc server or many others and they have a lot of the options you might want for the

526
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:40,480
game server, but like maybe it's a creative world versus survival or any kind of mod settings

527
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:44,340
you might want, they're all in the setup for you right there and an easy to click use interface

528
00:27:44,340 --> 00:27:47,240
and then you hit deploy and you got your own custom server.

529
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:50,160
So if you want to use it for your business like we do or you just want to use it for

533
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:14,000
So there's some hoopla this week I'm a little worried that we're touching the third rail

534
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:23,280
on this one because there's there is just so much going on right now where world news

535
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:30,200
is getting into tech and one kind of hit close to home since we were on the air jet brains

536
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:36,960
really went under the magnet magnifying scope thing what do you call it microscope microscope

537
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:40,720
thank you jet brains got kind of called out in a way for potentially being like a back

538
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:45,320
door for Russian hackers and really got a lot of fun throwing at it.

539
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:51,280
Yeah well that was brought to us by the little bull so and the New York Times actually yes

540
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:55,840
yeah yeah they said there that Russian hackers may have piggybacked on a tool developed by

541
00:28:55,840 --> 00:29:01,280
jet brains which is based in the Czech Republic to gain access to federal government and private

542
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:05,880
sector systems you know all the solar winds they say American intelligence agencies and

543
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:11,720
private cyber security investigators are examining the role of the widely used company jet brains

544
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:17,960
in a far reaching Russian hacking officials are investigating whether the company founded

545
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:24,240
by three Russian engineers in the Czech Republic with research labs in Russia were breached

546
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:29,640
and used as a pathway for hackers to insert back doors into the software jet brains said

547
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:36,300
on Wednesday that it was not aware of any investigation at all nor is aware of any compromise

548
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:43,480
and that the team is trying to get more information from the FBI does everything to Russia yeah

549
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:49,240
I know right and you know it's it's unnamed U.S. officials it's unnamed cyber security

550
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:55,780
experts and they say things like security experts warn that months long intrusion could

551
00:29:55,780 --> 00:30:00,840
be the biggest breach of the United States network in history but that's like well yeah

552
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:06,400
okay if all this is true and they compromise systems and they were in for a month or three

553
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:11,000
then yeah it'd be a really big deal but they throw that in there as if it's already true

554
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:17,560
as if it's already happened it's it's bull so gather around children when you are hosting

555
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:23,560
software yourself that you buy from a vendor such as I don't know team cities a popular

556
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:29,220
solution that jet brain sells and you do not update said software or you are not managing

557
00:30:29,220 --> 00:30:34,520
your hosting right that can be a problem I have a huge issue here because the way the

558
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:39,600
story was reported it makes it sound like like the jet brains like they're updating

559
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:44,920
tool or whatever was completely compromised all the solar winds right not the case what

560
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:50,240
it looks like and you know no one's gonna confirm this yet but I'm hoping that at some

561
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:56,480
point they do is that there were at least one potentially more unpatched out-of-date

562
00:30:56,480 --> 00:31:04,120
improperly configured team city instances that were being self-hosted by various customers

563
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:09,600
and that is a vector for compromise just like if you have an unpatched out-of-date WordPress

564
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:20,120
instance on a server somewhere right so this is nonsense it's nuanced because

565
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:26,000
it involves understanding that software can be created by a company and deployed by a

566
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:30,400
user incorrectly and then be used as a vector of attack and if you don't understand that

567
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:35,080
nuance it just looks like well jet brain sells a bad product right you have to understand

568
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:40,900
that if a customer is hosting a vendor software and managing it themselves that they are ultimately

569
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:45,080
responsible for the security of said software yeah and I actually think that's the biggest

570
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:49,520
disservice by kind of labeling all of this as nation state attacks it sort of reduces

571
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:54,120
the responsibility of the sys admins that set that up in the first place like that's

572
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:58,740
on them they set that up incorrectly and it didn't really take somebody with sophistication

573
00:31:58,740 --> 00:32:03,760
it took somebody who was willing to crawl the web and I when I saw this what my first

574
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:08,680
thought was is how does this impact a guy like Mike who maybe has clients who know he

575
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:14,280
uses these tools do you worry about it hurting your reputation by association I actually

576
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:18,480
took to Twitter as one does these days because I was pretty concerned right because we use

577
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:23,040
Ruby bind we use pie charm it's we're basically a jeopardy shop we actually don't use team

578
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:29,800
city though so there's that yeah it's it's not great right I don't you know is it going

579
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:35,860
to make us dramatically change our tooling no VS code is slowly but surely making us

580
00:32:35,860 --> 00:32:42,280
do that yeah I mean if I was using team city I think I might be more concerned having said

581
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:47,280
that now that they're you know publicly in caps and red letters with the hammer and sickle

582
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:52,760
next to it publicly known to like non people in the industry as a Russian company which

583
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:59,800
they are not from the Czech Republic different country that maybe isn't great having said

584
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:04,280
that a lot of my clients particularly those in like regulated industries also are JetBrains

585
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:09,900
customers so you know if you're doing Java you're probably wanting you're at least looking

586
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:15,200
at IntelliJ it may be that their brand and reputation withstands this but yeah I think

587
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:19,440
they had they're gonna get some crap from like people like honestly stupid congressmen

588
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:26,040
who are gonna want to like grandstand right yeah I hope I hope there's nothing to be concerned

589
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:33,240
about I I guess I'd be lying if I didn't say now I kind of have like a bit of doubt about

590
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:38,280
the company like just a little bit of hmm you know okay like I'm gonna kind of keep

591
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:42,240
my eye on them now and I think that's super unfortunate because they don't deserve that

592
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:45,720
before that their action so far had had really you know what they've done is they've made

593
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:48,740
a good product and they've charged for that product and that seems like it's been a pretty

594
00:33:48,740 --> 00:33:53,520
good business model so maybe this will blow over I hope I don't think it's gonna really

595
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:57,480
affect them I mean it might I could see it may be affecting like the team city line which

596
00:33:57,480 --> 00:34:01,880
I sure I don't mean to downplay that I know that's a big product for them but just not

597
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:07,040
the way I run my process so not something I'm interested in I mean I just just like

598
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:12,720
from my own experience switching the entire IDE infrastructure and the plugins and all

599
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:17,080
the custom crap you've probably written for them for your entire company based on one

600
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:23,840
very shoddily reported New York Times article that sounds expensive and bad so okay now

601
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:27,760
the other thing that's obviously going on right now that has huge ramifications for

602
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:33,840
our industry is parlor as we recorded now is offline I'm not really familiar with it

603
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:38,400
but I know it's a social network that's like an alternative to Twitter that has gotten

604
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:43,400
famous for a lot of well-known people on the right to switch to it after Twitter had started

605
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:47,320
fact-checking or whatever and you know this whole thing is all kind of been going down

606
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:52,140
for the last couple weeks if you want more context you can always check out unfiltered

607
00:34:52,140 --> 00:34:55,440
unfiltered.show but there's been a lot of changes a lot of things have been happening

608
00:34:55,440 --> 00:35:01,840
very fast and sometimes you know I think for the better and some I think have have been

609
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:07,760
sort of like oh boy now the genie's out of the bottle on that one and an AWS pulling

610
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:13,720
the plug on parlor that was a moment where I went oh whoa well that feels like a whole

611
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:17,000
other level did you get that sense?

612
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:21,360
So I gotta be honest with you I don't know what the hell parlor was until this week.

613
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:26,520
Yeah they went from being famous to offline in about a week.

614
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:32,680
And I just want to like make sure I understand it's effectively Twitter right but like with

615
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:33,680
no rules?

616
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:39,100
Right right well I don't know I really don't know about that but I know that it's been

617
00:35:39,100 --> 00:35:44,040
like promoted as like the free speech social media or whatever which of course attracts

618
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:46,120
all kinds right.

619
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:50,080
The question that I had after this happened is it's one thing right if Twitter says okay

620
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:53,820
we're gonna close your account because that's their service well AWS that's really kind

621
00:35:53,820 --> 00:35:58,980
of become like the infrastructure of the internet that's a whole other level and a lot of dominoes

622
00:35:58,980 --> 00:36:00,160
fall after that.

623
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:04,720
So but it wasn't AWS first right it was the App Store I think right?

624
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:07,760
Right Google Play and then the App Store.

625
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:13,200
And then like Dio preemptively came out and said they wouldn't host them.

626
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:16,700
So like there's a lot of weirdness here right there's a lot of reporting that like maybe

627
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:20,080
the guy who founded parlor's wife is a Russian spy.

628
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:21,080
Oh Russian?

629
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:27,720
A Russian and this makes me want to talk about honey traps for a minute.

630
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:35,520
You have Unfilter we have this I have my company where are these Russian women for us Chris?

631
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:38,200
Where were they when we needed them?

632
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:40,560
Where is our honey trap money is what you're saying?

633
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:43,520
Right you want the you want the girl and the investment in rubles.

634
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:48,360
I mean Jupiter Broadcasting is a podcast network has a reach that far exceeds many very popular

635
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:49,360
magazines.

636
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:53,400
You know somebody ought to be in here you know getting some propaganda in this we got

637
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:57,880
a platform but no none of that Putin money.

638
00:36:57,880 --> 00:37:00,000
Just like a little gas prof cash.

639
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:04,760
Yeah they got tons of oil money man come on they got so much oil money that they used

640
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:09,200
to build nuclear powered lighthouses have you looked that up have you seen that on YouTube?

641
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:10,200
No that's nuts.

642
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:15,240
One of these days you should look up nuclear powered lighthouses blow your mind what they

643
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:16,240
were doing.

644
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:21,720
So come on just a little bit our way would you but I agree what I find to be interesting

645
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:26,280
is the details that have come out now that parlor is suing Amazon it kind of because

646
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:29,920
in the lawsuit it sheds a little bit of light on Amazon's rationale for banning parlor they

647
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:35,440
say this is according to Amazon the team said that it was troubled by repeated policy violations

648
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:40,320
the email cited 98 posts that incited violence it included screenshots of a call to hang

649
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:47,240
traders as well as exoneration to start systematically assassinating liberal leaders and supporters

650
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:51,240
of the black lives movement matter and others in January.

651
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:54,360
Amazon said publicly they cannot provide services to a customer that is unable to effectively

652
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:57,120
identify and remove content that encourages or incites violence.

653
00:37:57,120 --> 00:38:01,200
I mean if that you know that kind of that kind of stuff like OK well where does Amazon

654
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:02,200
draw the line.

655
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:05,880
Maybe that is where they should be drawing the line but it was just still kind of surprising.

656
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:08,120
I mean obviously all that stuff is gross right.

657
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:09,120
Yeah.

658
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:13,600
I have no defense for it but I do wonder like if you're if you're a small startup and you're

659
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:18,240
doing some kind of platform does that mean like if you just like fail to moderate your

660
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:22,240
platform because you're like three guys in a dorm room AWS is going to kick you off if

661
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:23,240
you get big enough.

662
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:27,920
I think it definitely means that now because I feel like I mean I don't think any of that

663
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:33,760
stuff is good and this climate will make it such that any service that is centralized is

664
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:35,240
vulnerable like that.

665
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:39,120
Well that's problematic.

666
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:46,640
I mean we think of Twitter as like the strongly you know kind of like woke moderated platform.

667
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:48,880
Back in the day Twitter was a garbage pit.

668
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:49,880
Good point.

669
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:53,000
Remember Twitter porn which is still a thing but it was like people were doing revenge

670
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:56,400
porn and like harassment of girlfriends and boyfriends.

671
00:38:56,400 --> 00:39:00,760
If you actually look at the whole history of Twitter it may have been more of a garbage

672
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:04,480
platform for longer than it's been a woke politically correct platform.

673
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:05,480
Right.

674
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:10,840
And then it just you need money to like moderate this crap right like that's one and they want

675
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:11,840
to sell ads.

676
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:16,720
Well but like you at some point moderation requires actual moderators and humans are

677
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:17,720
expensive.

678
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:18,840
That's my point.

679
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:24,640
So like I wonder if this is the standard which I kind of am coming dangerously close to saying

680
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:27,000
this shouldn't have happened which I kind of don't agree with because if you're calling

681
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:31,800
for political assassinations that's obviously not good and potentially a crime.

682
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:37,320
But could you make a new Twitter in a dorm room or a new Facebook in a dorm room and

683
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:42,760
actually satisfy these requirements in a realistic way.

684
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:46,880
The reason why I say no is because this isn't where it ends.

685
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:48,080
OK where does it go.

686
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:49,420
It's an evolving issue.

687
00:39:49,420 --> 00:39:56,200
Not only is a loud speech an evolving and usually narrowing issue but I really kind

688
00:39:56,200 --> 00:40:00,840
of am concerned about other issues that don't seem that impossible.

689
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:08,680
I could see even within 2021 it comes up a pretty big debate about the US law requiring

690
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:10,720
back doors and encryption.

691
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:14,840
It was something that the Obama administration fought for really hard.

692
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:21,040
It was something that I mean you can find tons of James Comey on YouTube talking about

693
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:26,280
it and I could see the issue too if radicalization in the US is becoming a bigger and bigger

694
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:32,320
problem then the need to get access to these private communications is going to become

695
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:34,160
a bigger and bigger issue.

696
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:41,720
And so what happens when a service refuses to do that and what is going to be sort of

697
00:40:41,720 --> 00:40:43,960
the system's response to that.

698
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:47,960
And so just like you may have to moderate or else you're going to be held liable you're

699
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:52,680
also likely going to have to meet legal requirements when it comes to encryption to operate in

700
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:53,680
the US.

701
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:55,600
That's also going to tighten the noose a little bit.

702
00:40:55,600 --> 00:41:00,840
I mean so that's just that's just one example of how the goalpost will always be moved because

703
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:03,160
society is always always moving.

704
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:10,300
So you kind of get down to the argument of things change whatever you have to change

705
00:41:10,300 --> 00:41:11,300
with them.

706
00:41:11,300 --> 00:41:15,200
But do you let the market decide that and like you just fail if your platform sucks.

707
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:21,360
Well I mean you feel you figure if this is if this becomes the new normal it will create

708
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:24,000
demand for something that's not censored.

709
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:27,600
It will create demand for something not if you can't host it anymore.

710
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:28,600
Well yeah.

711
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:32,680
Or you have to use the tools like you have to build your own system you have to build

712
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:35,840
your own email server you have to host that yourself you have to build your own e-commerce

713
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:36,840
platform.

714
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:39,440
Yeah but that's that's such a lift.

715
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:43,400
I mean but it is easier than ever.

716
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:44,400
You know.

717
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:45,400
True.

718
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:48,320
There's a lot of packages out there or Docker images or you know I mean there's a lot of

719
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:49,600
options out there.

720
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:51,120
See I'm very of two minds on this.

721
00:41:51,120 --> 00:41:55,480
I don't like obviously what I've seen of Parler is probably the worst of it right.

722
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:57,600
Because it's right when it got taken down.

723
00:41:57,600 --> 00:41:58,600
Yeah.

724
00:41:58,600 --> 00:42:02,080
But I have no problem with like a private business saying hey because I think you guys

725
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:04,280
are you know unacceptable.

726
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:08,240
I would use a different word but we're not going to serve you anymore.

727
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:13,000
You know we're not a public utility and you like if I just like fired a client because

728
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:17,340
whatever or I refuse to take a client because of whatever it's I think when you get into

729
00:42:17,340 --> 00:42:22,320
cases like it's all it's less the AWS when it's more the app store one that kind of bothers

730
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:27,800
me a little bit because it's like there is no other way to develop on that platform.

731
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:33,360
Yeah well the web but yeah yeah but you're you're gimped in a lot of ways right.

732
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:37,120
And history has shown us specifically with social media platforms people want a native

733
00:42:37,120 --> 00:42:38,120
local app.

734
00:42:38,120 --> 00:42:41,520
Well because they want to do photos want to do filters and it's possible but it's never

735
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:43,200
going to be as good of an experience.

736
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:47,920
But again like I wish it wasn't parlor do you know what I mean it would be easier to

737
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:53,400
kind of get on my heels and be like you know like when hey.com got like pushed around by

738
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:55,840
Apple that that was easy right right.

739
00:42:55,840 --> 00:43:02,240
This is like well you guys actually did like a way way over any reasonable line you know.

740
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:07,000
So I don't know I I sort of miss and this is where we're going to be a little you and

741
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:12,720
I are going to pour one out for Sun I sort of miss the ideal of like the 90s when like

742
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:16,840
the Internet was becoming a thing and people are just going to develop their software man

743
00:43:16,840 --> 00:43:21,880
and you download the member shareware and it'd be great and we'd be happy and you'd

744
00:43:21,880 --> 00:43:24,760
have like a million little dev shops doing all these crazy things.

745
00:43:24,760 --> 00:43:28,240
And they'd be like news groups that would specifically be like for these types of people

746
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:32,640
in software that really geek out about this particular thing and computers and that was

747
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:33,640
great.

748
00:43:33,640 --> 00:43:38,080
I actually still have a very active Usenet connection to you really.

749
00:43:38,080 --> 00:43:42,400
I do I do although I don't quite use it for the same thing anymore but I do follow what

750
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:43,440
you mean.

751
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:51,680
And also I guess this is me being an old man but I yearn for a time before Twitter.

752
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:52,680
Yeah.

753
00:43:52,680 --> 00:43:56,000
Like things were so much better in a lot of ways.

754
00:43:56,000 --> 00:44:03,000
Just slowing the pace of conversation and allowing time for thought and deliberation

755
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:07,820
and not creating a discourse where your goal is to get as many likes and retweets as possible

756
00:44:07,820 --> 00:44:12,440
so you're always turning the dial up so that we always are getting people engaged.

757
00:44:12,440 --> 00:44:14,720
I think it just brings out the worst in people.

758
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:15,920
It's negative incentives right.

759
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:21,400
You're always like I look at my own stats because I'm a I see I'm an attention enthusiast

760
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:24,620
I was going to say something else there and it's just true.

761
00:44:24,620 --> 00:44:30,360
Like if I can say something mean about Linux that like triples engagement if I say something

762
00:44:30,360 --> 00:44:34,400
nice about Linux it doubles it if I say something negative about Apple forget about it I can't

763
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:36,520
even keep up with the notifications.

764
00:44:36,520 --> 00:44:37,680
That's so true.

765
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:43,400
It's like yes for sure yes yes and if we really wanted to play the game we'd intentionally

766
00:44:43,400 --> 00:44:48,280
say something incendiary about Linux or Apple and then we'd cut it and we'd clip it and

767
00:44:48,280 --> 00:44:53,760
then we'd post that as a standalone bite on Twitter and blast it out off to the races.

768
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:54,760
Right.

769
00:44:54,760 --> 00:44:55,760
Yeah.

770
00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:56,760
And that's what people do.

771
00:44:56,760 --> 00:44:57,760
It's just all right.

772
00:44:57,760 --> 00:45:03,440
Well so let's let's shift gears to a little bit of tech because in your M1 endeavors one

773
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:07,160
of the things we were talking about last week specifically was the state of Docker and not

774
00:45:07,160 --> 00:45:09,800
being ready for the M1 platform.

775
00:45:09,800 --> 00:45:13,420
I guess have you had any more experiences with trying to get Docker working on that

776
00:45:13,420 --> 00:45:15,300
sucker is the situation improved.

777
00:45:15,300 --> 00:45:19,680
So there is a development release of a Docker version for the M1.

778
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:20,680
OK.

779
00:45:20,680 --> 00:45:22,400
It's still in dev mode.

780
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:26,780
It's it's not there yet but you know like we talked about when this M1 first came out

781
00:45:26,780 --> 00:45:30,960
this is going to be a problem that Docker is going to solve pretty quickly.

782
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:31,960
Yes sure.

783
00:45:31,960 --> 00:45:34,720
I would bet my hat in 60 days we're not talking about this anymore.

784
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:37,080
That seems pretty aggressive but.

785
00:45:37,080 --> 00:45:42,440
So do you know like they must be doing some sort of VM right.

786
00:45:42,440 --> 00:45:43,700
They must be doing some sort of.

787
00:45:43,700 --> 00:45:48,280
They have to move over to Apple's new hypervisor is the problem which you know to be honest

788
00:45:48,280 --> 00:45:52,840
with you I mean maybe it's totally flushed out but you kind of wonder like what's this

789
00:45:52,840 --> 00:45:57,440
how complete of a product how solid is just that because it seems like those are that's

790
00:45:57,440 --> 00:46:02,760
new plumbing for the OS to begin with and it may be one of those things that needs a

791
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:07,320
little bit iteration itself but it is interesting to see that they're just plugging away at

792
00:46:07,320 --> 00:46:08,320
it.

793
00:46:08,320 --> 00:46:09,720
I'm just I was just going through it.

794
00:46:09,720 --> 00:46:13,160
Yeah it looks and it looks like they're getting a pretty good amount of engagement too.

795
00:46:13,160 --> 00:46:14,960
So it's going to it'll get there won't it.

796
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:15,960
You're probably right.

797
00:46:15,960 --> 00:46:16,960
I don't know.

798
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:17,960
You.

799
00:46:17,960 --> 00:46:22,920
The only thing I think your prediction is just a little optimistic if that new set of

800
00:46:22,920 --> 00:46:27,720
virtualization APIs and Mac OS ends up being kind of half baked then there's really not

801
00:46:27,720 --> 00:46:30,040
it's a kind of out of Docker's hands there's nothing they can do.

802
00:46:30,040 --> 00:46:34,360
I would be very surprised if that's the case because remember people want to run Windows

803
00:46:34,360 --> 00:46:43,040
on Mac too in VMS and that's like a core feature for them data dog dot com slash coder radio

804
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:48,760
data dog is the unified monitoring and analytics platform that gives you comprehensive visibility

805
00:46:48,760 --> 00:46:52,560
into cloud hybrid and multi cloud environments.

806
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:56,260
The key is you can really quickly analyze the performance of your Linux servers and

807
00:46:56,260 --> 00:47:02,260
applications in real time you get customizable dashboards that are beautiful.

808
00:47:02,260 --> 00:47:06,120
You should go to data dog dot com slash coder radio just to kind of get an idea of what

809
00:47:06,120 --> 00:47:07,240
the UI is like.

810
00:47:07,240 --> 00:47:10,440
But the nice thing is is these dashboards give you the ability to do all kinds of things

811
00:47:10,440 --> 00:47:14,520
like troubleshoot issues in seconds get a unified view of your metrics your traces your

812
00:47:14,520 --> 00:47:21,880
logs all in one place and they have just turnkey integrations for over 400 different technologies

813
00:47:21,880 --> 00:47:25,560
and you can use data dog as a monitor your Linux boxes the containers and the applications

814
00:47:25,560 --> 00:47:30,580
inside them and then pull in metrics and other data from the rest of your entire stack across

815
00:47:30,580 --> 00:47:36,240
multiple clouds to get visibility and health into the performance of your entire infrastructure

816
00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:37,580
and applications.

817
00:47:37,580 --> 00:47:43,180

00:47:47,080 --> 00:47:48,580
Yep that's awesome.

820
00:47:48,580 --> 00:47:52,400
It's a nice looking T-shirt too you see when you go to the data dog dot com slash coder

821
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:58,160
radio URL and that's a great way to get started experience the UI and how you can lay it out.

822
00:47:58,160 --> 00:48:03,480
It's so slick data dog dot com slash coder radio go there start a free trial get one

823
00:48:03,480 --> 00:48:07,340
dashboard set up and then you get yourself a free T-shirt.

824
00:48:07,340 --> 00:48:10,840
Thanks to data dog for sponsoring the coder radio program and thanks to everybody who

825
00:48:10,840 --> 00:48:17,160
supports our show by going to data dog dot com slash coder radio.

826
00:48:17,160 --> 00:48:21,180
So let's do a little M1 update.

827
00:48:21,180 --> 00:48:24,360
You must have a little bit better sense of the battery life at this point.

828
00:48:24,360 --> 00:48:25,360
Days.

829
00:48:25,360 --> 00:48:26,360
Days.

830
00:48:26,360 --> 00:48:27,360
It's out of control.

831
00:48:27,360 --> 00:48:29,480
I actually forgot where I put the charger.

832
00:48:29,480 --> 00:48:34,980
You know I gosh I got I am thinking maybe I I'm trying not to talk myself into buying

833
00:48:34,980 --> 00:48:36,700
one and then you.

834
00:48:36,700 --> 00:48:37,700
You need to do it.

835
00:48:37,700 --> 00:48:38,700
Yeah.

836
00:48:38,700 --> 00:48:39,700
Yeah.

837
00:48:39,700 --> 00:48:40,700
Yeah.

838
00:48:40,700 --> 00:48:41,700
Just get the air get.

839
00:48:41,700 --> 00:48:42,700
I don't.

840
00:48:42,700 --> 00:48:43,700
So I did bump it to 16.

841
00:48:43,700 --> 00:48:46,160
If I should if I was going to do it I should have done it as like a Christmas gift for

842
00:48:46,160 --> 00:48:49,880
my wife or something you know you should have done it at the end of the year for the

843
00:48:49,880 --> 00:48:50,880
write off.

844
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:53,560
I just missed the taxi window too.

845
00:48:53,560 --> 00:48:56,240
I wonder if those business now I shouldn't even I shouldn't even do a business.

846
00:48:56,240 --> 00:49:01,360
I just I am kind of curious about what it's generally like and you know people been telling

847
00:49:01,360 --> 00:49:04,360
me that it's something you really got to experience to fully understand.

848
00:49:04,360 --> 00:49:05,360
All right.

849
00:49:05,360 --> 00:49:07,780
I am going to tell you right now.

850
00:49:07,780 --> 00:49:14,020
Giving having given it a second chance and less of like a whatever kind of I snarky I.

851
00:49:14,020 --> 00:49:19,840
Yeah it is my favorite computer that I have ever owned ever ever even like the nostalgia

852
00:49:19,840 --> 00:49:22,680
days of of years past.

853
00:49:22,680 --> 00:49:25,840
I wish it ran Snow Leopard.

854
00:49:25,840 --> 00:49:29,880
By the way if you're not blacked out by now you're going to be in trouble.

855
00:49:29,880 --> 00:49:32,360
Yeah that's got to be on somebody's drinking game.

856
00:49:32,360 --> 00:49:34,640
I mean yeah Big Sur is no snow leopard.

857
00:49:34,640 --> 00:49:37,000
Big Sur is the worst part of it.

858
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:44,600
But just like not having to think about plugging in and this thing goes from asleep to I'm

859
00:49:44,600 --> 00:49:52,760
in my works workspace in like almost instantaneously that is nice and somebody saying but Linux

860
00:49:52,760 --> 00:49:59,800
in the chat Gavin is I'm hoping that system 76 or Dell or one of those guys can somehow

861
00:49:59,800 --> 00:50:12,320
match this because the hardware benefits the speed the no fan no fan it's it's awesome

862
00:50:12,320 --> 00:50:22,600
like it I literally I like maybe I could see a world where I just work on a MacBook Air

863
00:50:22,600 --> 00:50:26,720
for a while because that's the for those who don't listen every week that's the model I

864
00:50:26,720 --> 00:50:32,440
have the MacBook Air it's I mean it's fast enough even in Rosetta I don't notice any

865
00:50:32,440 --> 00:50:37,120
noticeable slowdowns I mean obviously the iMac Pro and the Thaleo have like more RAM

866
00:50:37,120 --> 00:50:40,640
and dedicated GPU so that's a little like certain things are a little unfair right like

867
00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:47,480
the Thaleo runs the flight simulator the air doesn't for obvious reasons but as a day-to-day

868
00:50:47,480 --> 00:50:54,360
computer if the apocalypse ever ends and I can go on trips again having a laptop that

869
00:50:54,360 --> 00:50:59,960
one has no fan and two barely ever needs to be charged is gonna be a game changer for

870
00:50:59,960 --> 00:51:04,200
me yeah the battery life seems just like it would be it would fundamentally change the

871
00:51:04,200 --> 00:51:09,240
way I would use the computer oh and as more people have it particularly like them the

872
00:51:09,240 --> 00:51:16,080
Super Mac community a lot of the like pain points I experienced the first go-around have

873
00:51:16,080 --> 00:51:21,480
just either been people know workarounds or have been resolved and honestly when stuff

874
00:51:21,480 --> 00:51:26,400
starts getting ported to ARM I think I'm gonna see additional performance increases from

875
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:30,400
where I'm at now yeah that's kind of the funny thing huh it's not even as fast as it's gonna

876
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:36,080
be in a year right this machine like if I can manage not to pour a goddamn martini into

877
00:51:36,080 --> 00:51:42,480
it or Earl Gray depending on the week it might actually last me more than six months yeah

878
00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:46,240
which is you know that's a lot of commitment for me you know I'm a little good little shy

879
00:51:46,240 --> 00:51:50,120
you know I mean you just miss it but that is that Linux thing is the major blocker for

880
00:51:50,120 --> 00:51:55,160
me that's why I ended up going the route of the x1 and then tried out the XPS 13 and now

881
00:51:55,160 --> 00:52:01,360
I was I was fantasy specking myself a galago pro they don't have the dedicated Nvidia graphics

882
00:52:01,360 --> 00:52:07,480
until February though we all know I'm a shell for system 76 I'm joking by the way people

883
00:52:07,480 --> 00:52:13,360
have read it I am not in fact a show I can't unhear the galago's fan now yeah no fan is

884
00:52:13,360 --> 00:52:17,960
such a big deal too I love that for recording especially recording when I'm on the go like

885
00:52:17,960 --> 00:52:24,840
even the iMac Pro oh gosh oh no oh no don't stop it stop it I can't think about it but

886
00:52:24,840 --> 00:52:29,380
that no fan deal no fan that no fan is a big deal because when I'm on the go my mic is

887
00:52:29,380 --> 00:52:35,820
often right next to my laptop I am super tempted to just take because I've I mean this is way

888
00:52:35,820 --> 00:52:40,560
inside how Mike setting up his new workstation but I have two workstations once the Thalia

889
00:52:40,560 --> 00:52:47,440
because it does specific things and once the iMac because I stupidly bought an iMac Pro

890
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:52,480
I sort of think the iMac Pro is just gonna become the MacBook Air workstation and that's

891
00:52:52,480 --> 00:52:56,140
it what do you mean you're not even gonna use it I keep going back and forth but like

892
00:52:56,140 --> 00:53:02,880
every time the fan kicks in a part of my soul dies you're like what what is this the 90s

893
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:08,560
what is this spin and rest in this thing yeah it's like it's like my dog's hair like just

894
00:53:08,560 --> 00:53:13,360
caking in this piece of crap like you know I don't want to tempt you because you are

895
00:53:13,360 --> 00:53:19,400
like super Linux guy but it's the it's the damn console vacation of computers and it's

896
00:53:19,400 --> 00:53:24,520
so frustrating you know don't don't don't buy one because the fan you you will you won't

897
00:53:24,520 --> 00:53:30,200
go back right fanlessness yeah it really is it is frustrating because a lot of the performance

898
00:53:30,200 --> 00:53:35,920
it really appeals to me the battery life the no fan really appeals to me I also I am I'm

899
00:53:35,920 --> 00:53:39,560
pretty convinced that it's just a great chip like Apple probably really knows what they're

900
00:53:39,560 --> 00:53:43,080
doing and it's sort of the ultimate expression of their idea of a computer where that's an

901
00:53:43,080 --> 00:53:47,780
all-in-one that they build from the ground up the hardware OS all of it it's an interesting

902
00:53:47,780 --> 00:53:53,000
idea but without that escape hatch you've been able to load Linux on there I'm just

903
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:57,640
like it just wouldn't be as useful for me it would be a slam dunk if I was still in

904
00:53:57,640 --> 00:54:02,280
a corporate environment and I had a lot of meetings and calendar invites and all that

905
00:54:02,280 --> 00:54:06,120
kind of you know just stuff that you want to stay up to date with and all that and ran

906
00:54:06,120 --> 00:54:11,340
slack a lot and did all that like I could see it for sure but right now like my main

907
00:54:11,340 --> 00:54:15,160
production tools they haven't been ported to m1 so there's that as well so I'd be running

908
00:54:15,160 --> 00:54:22,240
a lot of stuff under Rosetta well I will say like one of the more interesting effects that

909
00:54:22,240 --> 00:54:30,200
it's had on me I'm weirdly getting used to like native Mac apps again and I'm getting

910
00:54:30,200 --> 00:54:34,720
like you mentioned slack I'm getting increasingly frustrated with slack because it's such an

911
00:54:34,720 --> 00:54:39,120
obvious electron app and doesn't like follow the conventions the right way of for those

912
00:54:39,120 --> 00:54:42,440
who have been listening for a long time I was an iOS developer back when you sort of

913
00:54:42,440 --> 00:54:47,280
like that was like full-time what I did so I lived in the Mac for like ever before I

914
00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:51,720
even really did much with Linux other than college which you know everybody fools around

915
00:54:51,720 --> 00:54:57,720
with Linux in college the like poorly done electron apps really stand out on Mac OS where

916
00:54:57,720 --> 00:55:02,560
they don't on Linux to me I think part of that is just like there's such conventions

917
00:55:02,560 --> 00:55:07,560
on Mac for like how the keyboard shortcuts are supposed to work yep yep we're on Linux

918
00:55:07,560 --> 00:55:10,160
everything is kind of like written in its own weird way and you just have to know the

919
00:55:10,160 --> 00:55:17,560
application but like airmail fantastical and no fan yeah I'm just gonna keep saying it

920
00:55:17,560 --> 00:55:22,600
Chris yeah I do hear that imagine sitting in your rope with no fan yeah you know you

921
00:55:22,600 --> 00:55:27,560
know my my x1 and the XPS 13 I really don't they do have a fan but it's very minimal don't

922
00:55:27,560 --> 00:55:30,660
hear it much so it's my it's getting much better on the Intel side too with the later

923
00:55:30,660 --> 00:55:37,240
processors but you know I think for me my I would I mean the battery life does sound

924
00:55:37,240 --> 00:55:40,880
really good I don't know I'd be tempted I'd be really tempted if they had if some of my

925
00:55:40,880 --> 00:55:44,800
production applications were ported I mean I already am tempted I'm just always tempted

926
00:55:44,800 --> 00:55:50,640
from a technological like tinkering standpoint my one concern is how can they ladder this

927
00:55:50,640 --> 00:55:55,840
up to like a MacBook Pro 16 because if they can actually do that with with like a similar

928
00:55:55,840 --> 00:56:01,260
performance increase that you would have gotten from the errors of Intel age and the sixteens

929
00:56:01,260 --> 00:56:06,760
of you know the last whatever with the I nines I think right if they have the same delta

930
00:56:06,760 --> 00:56:13,080
of performance those machines why would you not get one yeah I just I will right I mean

931
00:56:13,080 --> 00:56:17,960
yeah if anything where like especially for the unfiltered show because I do I do that

932
00:56:17,960 --> 00:56:21,680
all the processing myself there's no editor anything you know an hour and a half show

933
00:56:21,680 --> 00:56:26,320
takes forever to process it really is a pain in the butt don't even don't even get me started

934
00:56:26,320 --> 00:56:33,000
on trying to encode that much video it just is a time it just takes forever it's like

935
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:36,880
you work all day on something and then it's the evening and you just want to go home and

936
00:56:36,880 --> 00:56:41,720
you're sitting here waiting while your laptop just maxes out and anything that may be dramatically

937
00:56:41,720 --> 00:56:46,040
improved that time would would be pretty hard for me to say no to I've actually thought

938
00:56:46,040 --> 00:56:51,760
about to like well you know the nice thing about the PC architecture is it is possible

939
00:56:51,760 --> 00:56:59,160
to build a just all out powerhouse PC system that outflanks anything an M1 machine could

940
00:56:59,160 --> 00:57:04,440
do you know you could you could really get like a thread ripper going 128 gigs of RAM

941
00:57:04,440 --> 00:57:11,080
four terabytes of PCIe SSD storage you know you could really put a nice GPU in there and

942
00:57:11,080 --> 00:57:16,160
get something that really cranks maybe like an AMD 6800 series GPU and that thing and

943
00:57:16,160 --> 00:57:22,840
it would blast the doors off the M1 I suspect but you know I'd be looking at three thirty

944
00:57:22,840 --> 00:57:27,000
five hundred you know four or five thousand dollars if it's a pre-built you know maybe

945
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:32,040
even more of it you know six seven depending on the on the manufacturer and it just feels

946
00:57:32,040 --> 00:57:38,440
like give it a year and a half and there and Apple's gonna lap it but it is it has crossed

947
00:57:38,440 --> 00:57:42,240
my mind and it's what drew you know if drew was on the show right now what he'd be telling

948
00:57:42,240 --> 00:57:48,740
me I bet you is build a really powerful Linux system and do all the production tools under

949
00:57:48,740 --> 00:57:55,880
Linux and with a combination of wine and native tools and get 90% of the benefit with without

950
00:57:55,880 --> 00:58:00,680
having to switch platforms because that's the one thing that's still nice about x86

951
00:58:00,680 --> 00:58:05,480
right is if your work case demands it you can really build a system that's really specific

952
00:58:05,480 --> 00:58:09,800
to you and what I struggle with Apple now is the console vacation of these machines

953
00:58:09,800 --> 00:58:15,560
it's like yeah okay I could I could get the same exact thing in various varieties either

954
00:58:15,560 --> 00:58:20,560
with active cooling or without and I can run one operating system and it's not even one

955
00:58:20,560 --> 00:58:24,240
I particularly want to run I don't want to run Big Sur like I probably wouldn't buy a

956
00:58:24,240 --> 00:58:30,000
PC that only ran Windows 10 and it's just that is enough friction that I haven't pulled

957
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:33,960
the trigger yet but in reality I'm not going to build that rise and thread ripper system

958
00:58:33,960 --> 00:58:38,160
I don't have time to do that I don't have the funds I'm not going to do it but I like

959
00:58:38,160 --> 00:58:43,120
that it's still possible and that's not an option with the M1 I mean your best bet is

960
00:58:43,120 --> 00:58:47,080
adding compute via Thunderbolt but you can't even do an eGPU at this point at some point

961
00:58:47,080 --> 00:58:52,360
we need to talk about eGPUs again because that that was the dream that never came yeah

962
00:58:52,360 --> 00:58:57,240
so this is the thing right I and by the way the MacBook Air that I keep salivating about

963
00:58:57,240 --> 00:59:01,480
was only $1,200 so I would argue that like every other you just buy a better one yeah

964
00:59:01,480 --> 00:59:07,720
which and they like god damn it I hate to admit it but dang it it's true the price points

965
00:59:07,720 --> 00:59:12,480
pretty good right it's yeah I have been thinking about selling the X1 Carbon and maybe getting

966
00:59:12,480 --> 00:59:18,880
an XPS 13 but it's 20 the XPS 13 I'd want to be $2,200 right $1,400 and it's a better

967
00:59:18,880 --> 00:59:23,200
performance and multi-day battery life and a platform that's only getting faster and

968
00:59:23,200 --> 00:59:29,040
has a lot of interesting features and excitement and it's hard to justify that $2,200 even

969
00:59:29,040 --> 00:59:34,080
if I could sell the the X1 Carbon for $1,200 well your justification would be like Linux

970
00:59:34,080 --> 00:59:39,800
is a must-have right yeah you can't hot platforms like I do all the time really I guess you

971
00:59:39,800 --> 00:59:45,600
can obviously but you wouldn't make a lot of sense for other reasons yeah but I worry

972
00:59:45,600 --> 00:59:51,380
a little bit because like the reason they limit to 16 gigs of RAM is because the Apple

973
00:59:51,380 --> 00:59:56,080
Silicon cannot handle more than that I hope this isn't like and it seems silly that it

974
00:59:56,080 --> 00:59:59,760
even could be but like some sort of weird technical limitation they haven't been able

975
00:59:59,760 --> 01:00:05,800
to overcome because that although I take it back because this machine has never felt slow

976
01:00:05,800 --> 01:00:11,480
the MacBook Air for me yeah so what do I care if it has 16 gigs of RAM or 24 or 32 right

977
01:00:11,480 --> 01:00:16,620
right maybe if more things start using virtualization if you know having to use virtualization for

978
01:00:16,620 --> 01:00:22,340
more tasks because because it is ARM and not x86 maybe that starts to become a thing but

979
01:00:22,340 --> 01:00:26,920
so far that doesn't seem to be the case huh yeah huh well I'm gonna I I like following

980
01:00:26,920 --> 01:00:31,840
along I tell you what I don't know if I'm gonna I was the other when I after because

981
01:00:31,840 --> 01:00:37,160
after the show I kept messing around with that XPS 13 and I loaded more things on there

982
01:00:37,160 --> 01:00:41,640
and I just like oh my gosh this is I think I like a lot better than the ThinkPad I like

983
01:00:41,640 --> 01:00:48,440
the ThinkPad keyboard and I like the weight of the ThinkPad X1 better but the XPS 13 that

984
01:00:48,440 --> 01:00:56,720
11th gen CPU and that screen and that build quality whoof it's just hard to beat that

985
01:00:56,720 --> 01:01:02,200
even as even at an i5 it's just a great config so I legitimately I've just I hate that I'm

986
01:01:02,200 --> 01:01:07,200
always in this zone I'm it's like I can never just get the right setup I think for me the

987
01:01:07,200 --> 01:01:11,520
perfect maybe the perfect world is some sort of remote desktop solution I don't I don't

988
01:01:11,520 --> 01:01:16,480
know I feel like I'm perpetually spinning between machines but the last thing I probably

989
01:01:16,480 --> 01:01:21,400
should do is introduce an M1 in there but sometimes it feels a little tempting I mean

990
01:01:21,400 --> 01:01:26,640
it will be the last machine you introduce I can guarantee that and then the next thing

991
01:01:26,640 --> 01:01:31,800
you know I'd be putting an M1 at my desk and it's just welcome to the M1 action show and

992
01:01:31,800 --> 01:01:39,360
I'm on the other I'm using Mac mini colo Marco warmants coming on yes I don't think so no

993
01:01:39,360 --> 01:01:44,000
