00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,760
This is KOTOR Radio, episode 451 for January 31st, 2022.

2
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:19,880
Hello friends and welcome into Jupiter Broadcasting's weekly talk show, taking a pragmatic look

3
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:24,940
at the art and the business of software development and the world of technology.

4
00:00:24,940 --> 00:00:29,500
My name is Chris and joining us every single week, perhaps right next to the barbecue,

5
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:30,500
it's our host, Mr. Dominic.

6
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:31,500
Hello, Mike.

7
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:34,560
Hi, I'm cooking up some shrimp on the bobbin tonight.

8
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:36,880
Ooh, that was bad.

9
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:37,880
It was bad.

10
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:38,880
It was real bad.

11
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:44,000
You know, when you try to go Australian, it's like, ooh, I'm going to get a boomerang in

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,560
the mail, a dead fish with wrapped around a boomerang.

13
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:50,760
I'm like 10% hung over this morning, but I think that was pretty bad.

14
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:51,760
Only 10%?

15
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:52,760
Yeah, I did pretty good.

16
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:55,480
You know, we had the meetup at the studio last night.

17
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:56,480
That's right.

18
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:58,600
Folks came in before we started Linux Unplugged.

19
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:04,200
We did a little meet and greet, did the show, and then did a big cookout.

20
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:05,200
People stayed till about 8pm.

21
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:06,760
It was a good group.

22
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:10,720
You know what's super common is there's usually always a good portion of Coder fans at these

23
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:11,720
meetups.

24
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:12,960
With their M1 Macs, yes.

25
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,160
That did happen, yeah.

26
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:19,480
Jose came in from Puerto Rico, which is incredible.

27
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:22,320
He's visually impaired, too, so it's even more impressive that he manages to make it

28
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:24,640
all the way up here in the Pacific Northwest.

29
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:27,080
He's a brave man, and I'm going to visit one day.

30
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:30,320
He came up from Puerto Rico, so he's probably the furthest away.

31
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:31,320
He's like, yeah, okay, all right.

32
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:33,520
I've got to get going because I've got a project I'm working on, and he's going to use the

33
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:38,400
whole flight home to work on his project.

34
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:39,400
That's pretty great.

35
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:42,880
It sounds like he's working a lot in Python these days, but yeah, just a lot of people

36
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:43,880
came in.

37
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:45,320
They wanted to see the space.

38
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:47,080
I showed them my photo album of you.

39
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:48,680
We talked about you a little bit.

40
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:50,160
I'm sorry, photo album?

41
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:55,320
Yeah, you know, I like to print them out because I used to have them just on an iPad, but it

42
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:59,800
just feels more special when we can sit there and flip through them together.

43
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:04,400
Some of them I just made up, so I just Photoshopped you into a couple of them.

44
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,840
How many of these are of the Phantom Menace?

45
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:11,760
The bulk of them I did back then, but I updated it recently before the meetup just because

46
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,280
people want to see that.

47
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:18,480
People were disappointed that I didn't have Lady Joops parked here at the studio because

48
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,760
nobody knows what to expect.

49
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:24,480
When you say you have a podcasting studio, that could be a closet, right?

50
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:30,920
It could be something like the MKBHD massive warehouse that he has that is totally too

51
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:31,920
big.

52
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:37,240
But what we have is it's a townhouse that I used to own, then well, I still own it,

53
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:43,480
but I used to rent it out and my renters moved out and JB moved in years ago.

54
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:48,480
And so it's a house that has spots that are dedicated for recording, right?

55
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:52,920
But it's just a house, so nobody knows what to expect when they get here, which is great

56
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:55,320
because they're just completely unaware.

57
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:59,920
So they thought like Lady Joops would be parked here and I'd be giving tours of the RV.

58
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:01,760
But no, we weren't able to do that.

59
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:04,320
Maybe at a future meetup, but it was a lot of fun.

60
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:07,640
People brought a ton of food, so now I don't have to grocery shop for like the week because

61
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:11,960
people left what they brought, so there's like basically an army's worth of cookies

62
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:12,960
here still.

63
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:13,960
That sounds like a party.

64
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:17,060
See, one day I will make it up to the Pacific Northwest.

65
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:21,700
One day when we are, not only are we like traveling again, but maybe Linux Fest is back.

66
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:23,480
That'd be when I would head up here.

67
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:24,480
One day.

68
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:28,640
Just as it's getting nice at the end of April.

69
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:33,160
First of all, we got a couple of emails, but you know what, audience, you got to be sending

70
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:34,160
us more emails.

71
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:35,840
That's a big part of this show.

72
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:36,840
If you don't send us emails-

73
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:38,120
Get out of here.

74
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,120
Then there's no show.

75
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,720
The show, we just pack it up.

76
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:43,920
We come on, we say thank you to our sponsors and we put it out in the feeds.

77
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:46,040
And so if you don't send us emails, that could happen.

78
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:49,260
So you got to go to coder.show slash contact.

79
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:51,320
If you've been thinking about it, because now's the time.

80
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:52,320
That's inappropriate.

81
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:53,640
It is not.

82
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:56,960
But we did get an email in from listener, Chris.

83
00:03:56,960 --> 00:04:00,160
And he writes a little while ago, I think maybe it's actually quite a while ago, Mike

84
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:04,720
mentioned that he rewrote a Ruby service in C++ for performance.

85
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:08,840
Oh, blessed performance, he says, I'm curious to know what prompted Mike to do so.

86
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:11,540
Was it an observation by Mike and his team?

87
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:13,280
Was it a client complaint?

88
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:16,280
Was there something that was just taking way too long?

89
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:21,640
He goes on to say, I don't want to say that I have a similar problem at work, but I have

90
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:22,640
a similar problem at work.

91
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:26,280
And I'm curious to know what the thought process was and the steps taken in order to implement

92
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:27,640
such a change.

93
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:29,400
Thanks so much.

94
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:30,400
Great question.

95
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,840
Yeah, so both, right?

96
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:38,120
So the version of it that was written in Ruby was kind of, we've got to get this to market,

97
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:40,900
get it to ship for the customer.

98
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:42,900
And we knew it would be slow.

99
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:46,960
We did a little bit of monkeying around with the optimizations.

100
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:50,800
But at some point, the level of voodoo we were doing to try to speed it up in Ruby was

101
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:55,320
silly when doing it, quote unquote, the naive way in C++, and just compiling it as like

102
00:04:55,320 --> 00:05:00,240
a native, you know, like a.o file that we just called was significantly faster.

103
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:06,240
Now, when I say significantly, I mean, fast enough for us, which was pretty fast.

104
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:09,840
And it didn't require like the craziest Ruby code you've ever seen, right?

105
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:14,480
It was pretty straightforward, because we could do all kinds of, thank you, the compiler

106
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:17,000
for yield optimizations.

107
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:22,220
I don't think this is that big of a crisis type war story, because it's something we

108
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:24,140
knew was going to be slow.

109
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:30,240
We just shipped the slow Ruby version, because we had to, we had a deadline.

110
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:33,640
And when it came down to optimizing it, we tried for like a week to try to optimize it

111
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:34,720
in Ruby.

112
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:39,440
But it was actually me, I did a quick, simple, like just command line app in C++.

113
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:42,360
And literally just put it in the slash bin of the Rails app.

114
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:46,860
It was like, look how much faster this very, very bad version of the C++ is.

115
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:52,040
If we even wrote some like halfway decent C++ application that could do this, that our

116
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:58,640
Rails app can call, that solves all our problems, and we don't have to, you know, sacrifice

117
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:01,880
a few puppies to Cthulhu to get this to work.

118
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:02,880
The Ruby one worked, right?

119
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:05,760
It was just slow to get it to work performantly.

120
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:06,760
That's what happened.

121
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:10,720
Maybe like a thousand lines of C++ later.

122
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:16,520
We haven't had to touch it, I don't know, it's been like maybe eight months, nine months.

123
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:21,360
What I think I just heard in there is it kind of sounds like when you originally created

124
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:25,540
the Ruby version, you kind of knew in the back of your minds, we should probably come

125
00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:27,000
back and readdress this.

126
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:31,000
And so when it came time to look for low hanging fruit, that was one of the first place you

127
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
looked.

128
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,440
So this was a specific use case for this Rails app that had to do like this one weird thing

129
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:41,120
with this weird pseudo-proprietary mapping file format.

130
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:43,680
You know, the whole time going in, it was eyes wide open, right?

131
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:47,760
We knew it was bad, we had but we did it, the customer was okay with it, then we came

132
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:52,800
back and fixed it, we quote unquote fixed it, right, we just, you know, made it faster.

133
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:58,520
I don't know, the more I work in Ruby and Python, specifically Python, the more I'm

134
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:03,240
struck like these are all just like, all these libraries, these gems, these pip packages,

135
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:07,440
not all, but many of them are just wrappers over C or C++.

136
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:10,040
And this might just be like old curmudgeonly Mike here.

137
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:15,160
But I just don't think it's a huge deal to call into a lower level language for performance

138
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:17,880
reasons from one of these high level languages.

139
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:21,440
When the majority of the time, I'm thinking particularly now with the new thing with the

140
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:25,560
new version of Alice, the challenge is like figuring out like what the weird hitches in

141
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:29,520
her reading the data structures, not necessarily performance.

142
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:33,600
But certainly when performance is an issue, there's just obvious benefits.

143
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:39,440
There's a million Python, kind of call them compilers, but million Python interpreters

144
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:43,280
that are like, super fast, all right, there's one that runs on dotnet that we covered a

145
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:45,160
couple months ago.

146
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:51,040
There's ways to compile, transpile Python into C, C++, I don't use any of that stuff

147
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:53,440
because I think that's a little too magical for me.

148
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:57,720
I guess Chris, my thing is I don't think this is that crazy of a use case.

149
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:03,540
So yeah, I mean, if for Chris who's writing, consider it, I seriously would consider it.

150
00:08:03,540 --> 00:08:08,500
Now it's got to be like regular vanilla C++, right?

151
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:09,960
But yeah, it works.

152
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:10,960
It's good.

153
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:14,680
I think it's a smart thing to do if you need it.

154
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:17,120
I mean, other things can be hindering your performance though, right?

155
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:21,600
So if I'm looking at, let's say a Rails app, or even like a Flask or Django app, the first

156
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:24,000
thing I look at is not this type of performance thing.

157
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,840
This was just because we were dealing with graphical mapping files.

158
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:30,180
Obviously like the first thing you look at is database, right?

159
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:32,820
You look at Active Record or SQL Alchemy.

160
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:35,900
That's almost certainly where you're going to hit most of your bottleneck in those type

161
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:37,460
of applications.

162
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:42,320
And that is not solved by just rewriting something in a new performance language.

163
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,560
That's a good, well-rounded answer.

164
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:44,560
I like that.

165
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:46,000
That's a good question too.

166
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,200
If you're listening to the show and you hear us discussing something and you want to know

167
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:53,000
the thinking behind it, that's a great kind of email to send in, coder.show.com.

168
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,200
I'm going to mention it again because we need them.

169
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:58,160
We did get a comment via Matrix.

170
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:00,440
Alex wrote on free software funding.

171
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:04,280
He said, I was thinking about the funding issue over the weekend.

172
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:08,940
One of the aspects of funding I'd like to see is trying to get funding targeting open

173
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:12,160
source software for end users.

174
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:15,960
I think getting corporations to help pay is great, but I often think the type of corporate

175
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:19,440
common software that is useful for huge companies and the types of software that's good for

176
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:22,720
us users is quite different.

177
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:27,200
If funding came from users or end user distros, I think you'd see different kinds of open

178
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,200
source software get built.

179
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,840
I kind of liked the general premise here.

180
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:34,360
It's something I've been thinking about too, and I feel like you could kind of talk me

181
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:36,160
down a little bit probably.

182
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:42,440
I think what we need in order to get even the fraction of the healthy desktop software

183
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:48,740
ecosystem that Mac OS has, and if you think about it, Mike, like how big of a market could

184
00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:54,560
the pro Mac user who's willing to spend money on things like rogue Amoeba software or Bartender,

185
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:58,900
could that market really be that much larger than the enthusiast desktop Linux market?

186
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:03,040
It just seems to me that there is a lot of software on Linux that doesn't have a cloud

187
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:06,980
angle that a vendor isn't going to be able to sell their server product by investing

188
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:11,580
in, so it never really gets a lot of long-term investment on the Linux side.

189
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:17,060
If there was a way for users to directly fund, and this would have to be a way that allows

190
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:22,880
practically anyone in any country to fund because you'd need the net to be so freaking

191
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:23,880
wide.

192
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:28,880
It couldn't just be like US users or Western users because you're only going to get a tiny

193
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:32,980
fraction of people that actually participate, so it's got to essentially be a net that includes

194
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:37,840
the entire world, but if you could do it, you might be able to get a few decent long-term

195
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:41,500
desktop Linux applications if you could crack that nut.

196
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:47,100
I grant you there are millions of more Mac users than desktop Linux users, but I wonder

197
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:51,820
how many Mac users there are that are savvy enough to go buy these third-party apps to

198
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:55,100
modify their Mac experience or have a special note-taking app.

199
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:59,260
That's got to be, what, a 10% of the Mac user base?

200
00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:03,740
Maybe even less, maybe 5% of the Mac user base, which has got to be somewhere in the

201
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:10,260
spitting distance of the desktop Linux enthusiast user base, but these could be way off.

202
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:12,780
Yeah, so I think there's a couple questions.

203
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:18,320
The general size of desktop Linux users versus Mac users, I don't have any data on that.

204
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:24,540
I know we always laud that Linux has been gaining, but I think it's gaining not at a

205
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:25,540
huge pace.

206
00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:29,860
The other thing is I think there's just a cultural difference.

207
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:33,600
Folks on the Mac kind of expect to pay for things.

208
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:37,260
Folks on Linux, and I know this is like broad generalizations will get me hammered a little

209
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:42,080
bit here, but in terms of desktop, you know what, folks on the Macs will pay 10 bucks

210
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:45,140
for a little cute utility app.

211
00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:48,020
That just doesn't happen on Linux very much, right?

212
00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:54,460
I once purchased from the developer a piece of Linux desktop software and tried to repackage

213
00:11:54,460 --> 00:12:00,060
it up, clean it up a little bit, and resell it, and yeah, that dude only made enough to

214
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:05,740
buy a cheeseburger, and that's why he sold it to me for not that much money, and it's

215
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:07,420
a hassle.

216
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:09,660
I just don't, I think it's a cultural thing.

217
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:13,580
Now I think there's money to be made in the Linux world, and I think all that money is

218
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:14,580
on the server.

219
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:18,260
I do agree that right now that is true.

220
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:26,100
I do agree, and the only like crack in this what has been a wall of truth for a decade

221
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:31,620
now that I see is Steam, and things like good old games, GOG.

222
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:37,740
Like you have a growing demographic of Linux users who are willing to pay like $60 for

223
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:39,140
a video game.

224
00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:44,420
I wonder if that user base grows and just general Linux grows, perhaps we are going

225
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:50,680
to see ex-Mac users, ex-Windows users who are more comfortable paying for software,

226
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:55,160
or people like myself who I run a business, so if a piece of software helps me do my business,

227
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:56,540
I'm willing to pay for it.

228
00:12:56,540 --> 00:13:01,020
Like that user base has to be growing, but there's no mechanism to monetize it.

229
00:13:01,020 --> 00:13:03,220
Well, okay, hang on.

230
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:07,900
There's a big, so if you want to compare like people who buy stuff from Rogo Amoeba, you

231
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:13,020
need to compare them to people who buy that type of utility software, not to gamers, right?

232
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:16,860
There's a lot of Mac gamers who have PS5s and Xboxes and play games on Mac.

233
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:18,180
Yeah, I suppose that makes sense.

234
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:23,060
Yeah, I suppose because that's one's gaming, it's leisure, it's entertainment, and the

235
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:24,860
other is like utilities and working.

236
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:25,860
Right.

237
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:29,300
I mean, is there, I mean, I guess the question we end up really wanting to ask, but it's

238
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:35,220
a bit awkward, is why isn't there the Ubuntu, you know, or whatever Linux version of a Panic

239
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:37,460
software or Rogo Amoeba?

240
00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:39,260
Why is that not a thing?

241
00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:41,240
That's got to be a hundred different things, right?

242
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:47,520
It's got to be shifting SANS, GTK, X11, Wayland.

243
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:51,780
It's got to be, you know, different changes in a young ecosystem.

244
00:13:51,780 --> 00:13:56,620
And then I think, I'm trying to argue against your cultural assertion, but I think that

245
00:13:56,620 --> 00:13:58,580
could be part of it.

246
00:13:58,580 --> 00:14:00,380
That definitely seems like part of it.

247
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:05,300
I struggle with it because I really do believe that if you make it, like it's like the iTunes

248
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:06,300
model, right?

249
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:11,900
Like what Steve Jobs recognized is if we made buying music easier than pirating it, on average,

250
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:13,140
people will just buy the music.

251
00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:14,140
Yeah.

252
00:14:14,140 --> 00:14:15,940
I don't think people are pirating the software for Linux.

253
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:18,500
I think what it is, is it's always, right?

254
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:23,740
One of the big benefits of Linux, in fact, is that for much commercial software that

255
00:14:23,740 --> 00:14:29,820
you might buy on Mac OS, Windows, there is an open source alternative on Linux.

256
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:36,380
Now this is less and less true as things crossover where stuff is also free on Mac OS and Windows.

257
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:42,260
But I remember back in the day, we're talking Ubuntu like 904, 910 days, what was it called?

258
00:14:42,260 --> 00:14:43,420
Everybody uses it now.

259
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:44,420
Oh my God.

260
00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:45,420
The graphics tool.

261
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:46,420
Was it Blender?

262
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:47,420
Oh, Blender.

263
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:48,420
Yeah, sure.

264
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:49,420
That's huge.

265
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:50,420
Right.

266
00:14:50,420 --> 00:14:52,020
And that was just like such an OBS, right?

267
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:53,020
Open source.

268
00:14:53,020 --> 00:14:54,020
I don't know.

269
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:57,220
When I say it's culture, I don't mean I'm not trying to denigrate folks.

270
00:14:57,220 --> 00:14:58,940
It does seem kind of true.

271
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:02,580
And I do think in a way, it's really super beneficial for so many parts of the world

272
00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:04,620
that this software is available and free to them.

273
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:06,220
They couldn't afford to pay for it.

274
00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:08,140
And I don't feel like using it as piracy.

275
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:13,020
But when you said that, part of me feels like, no, but I do kind of consider it piracy of

276
00:15:13,020 --> 00:15:14,820
the developer's time.

277
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:20,460
Never ever giving them anything in exchange for years of work just isn't sustainable.

278
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:25,060
It's so funny, though, because there is no Mac server software to speak of, right?

279
00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:28,140
I mean, there is Mac OS server, but it's kind of a joke.

280
00:15:28,140 --> 00:15:33,020
No, mostly you install Docker, and then you run it that way.

281
00:15:33,020 --> 00:15:36,540
So it's kind of like, I don't know, I see lots of healthy businesses, especially like

282
00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:40,060
enterprise software tools that people are licensing and selling that are effectively

283
00:15:40,060 --> 00:15:42,700
built on top of Linux and work, and it's great.

284
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:47,480
I just don't see your boutique.

285
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:50,780
The other problem would be with, and I know this is where you're definitely in trouble,

286
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:53,020
with the kind of fragmentation of the desktops.

287
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:57,540
One of the things that Mac users who buy, because remember, we're talking about a small

288
00:15:57,540 --> 00:15:59,820
percentage of Mac users here, too.

289
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:03,060
Most people who have Macs don't know anything about Panic, don't know anything about Rogue

290
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:04,060
Amoeba.

291
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:08,580
And they would be damned if they ever paid those kind of prices for a small, not little,

292
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:11,340
but independent software.

293
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:16,060
But the reason people do buy them is because those two developers in particular and many

294
00:16:16,060 --> 00:16:23,260
of your classic Mac OS software vendors are committed to doing things, quote, the Apple

295
00:16:23,260 --> 00:16:24,260
Mac way, right?

296
00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:29,420
They quickly update when the user design language, user UX language changes.

297
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:30,820
They follow the trends, right?

298
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:34,540
Monterey comes out, they make things look more like Monterey, they clean it up.

299
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:40,020
I think you'd be hard pressed to do that on desktop Linux, unless you just said, I only

300
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:44,780
do like KDE and only do KDE Plasma, and if you customize it, my app's going to look weird.

301
00:16:44,780 --> 00:16:49,300
I have to say, even kind of then, like we're seeing this on the GNOME side, some apps that

302
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:54,660
really try to stick with where GNOME's going, but what seems to be happening over the years

303
00:16:54,660 --> 00:17:01,380
is that an app stays strong for a while, then it kind of fades, and just a replacement eventually

304
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:06,500
comes along, and it's kind of like a reset of the whole application, sort of re-back

305
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:10,340
to basics, kind of like when Apple like threw out an app and just restarts it over again

306
00:17:10,340 --> 00:17:12,260
and has very limited functionality.

307
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:15,380
That seems, we kind of seem to be in a cycle of that on the GNOME side, in my personal

308
00:17:15,380 --> 00:17:19,740
opinion, and not completely, but there are definitely some apps that just seem like we've

309
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:26,180
done this before, but now they're reimagined in the new design paradigm.

310
00:17:26,180 --> 00:17:33,580
I find it to be a problem that I think you would hate this answer, but all of your buddies

311
00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:37,860
over in the Web3 camp are solving this with their tokens.

312
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:38,860
This is what these tokens do.

313
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:44,380
They have governance tokens, and these tokens allow you to have special status, or essentially

314
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:50,500
they fundraise projects by selling these tokens, which is a total securities nightmare and

315
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:54,180
could potentially be abused on a Ponzi scheme, but that's where they're trying to go with

316
00:17:54,180 --> 00:17:59,980
some of these coins and tokens is a revenue model that doesn't involve selling something

317
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:07,040
like a product, but selling a token, almost like a stake in it, like a stock in the project.

318
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:12,700
Some of them have potential and some of them don't, but that's, I think, why some of this

319
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:13,700
is gaining traction.

320
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:19,120
There's so much hype in that Web3 camp right now is because the one thing they have solved

321
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:20,120
is money.

322
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:25,100
There's a lot of money over there, and they're not asking how the hell do we fund these projects

323
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:26,100
over there.

324
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:28,260
That's not the problem they have.

325
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:33,700
I can't say it's a better way to go, but they solved the funding problem.

326
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:37,700
Speaking of funding, did you see that Sony announced that they're buying Bungie?

327
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:41,140
I did, because you have to clap back, right?

328
00:18:41,140 --> 00:18:42,140
Wow.

329
00:18:42,140 --> 00:18:43,140
That was quick.

330
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:44,140
Yep.

331
00:18:44,140 --> 00:18:45,140
That was...

332
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:48,700
Destiny is a good game, so now they've got Destiny.

333
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:54,420
Well, and ironically, Bungie was the original developer of Halo, which was originally supposed

334
00:18:54,420 --> 00:18:56,940
to be a Mac OS game, so we're full circle here.

335
00:18:56,940 --> 00:18:58,140
It's pretty wild.

336
00:18:58,140 --> 00:19:02,200
Sony says that Bungie will remain an independent subsidiary.

337
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:03,200
This is crazy.

338
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:08,060
Only, they only paid $3.6 billion, so they paid like nearly $60 billion less.

339
00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:10,300
Well, Bungie is not Activision.

340
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:11,300
Yeah, for sure.

341
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:12,300
For sure.

342
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:13,300
For sure.

343
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:14,460
And Sony's already in a pretty good position.

344
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:21,860
Destiny is a great game series, so snapping that up is actually pretty brilliant.

345
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:23,420
lino.com slash coder.

346
00:19:23,420 --> 00:19:27,420
Go there to get $100 in 60-day credit on a new account, and you go there to support

347
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:28,420
the show.

348
00:19:28,420 --> 00:19:29,660
It's lino.com slash coder.

349
00:19:29,660 --> 00:19:31,300
Just remember that URL.

350
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:35,980
I was just talking to my friends over at Linode, and I got a little inside scoop on what's

351
00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:39,300
coming next, and you guys are going to absolutely love it.

352
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:41,660
I can't tell you about it yet, but you know I will.

353
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:42,660
You know I will.

354
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:44,540
I absolutely love this company.

355
00:19:44,540 --> 00:19:48,580
I mean, I'm just so damn impressed as a customer, but when I talk to them, and I hear about

356
00:19:48,580 --> 00:19:52,360
what they're working on, I'm super excited about the future of Linode.

357
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:56,760
You know, they started in 2003 because they just love the technology stack.

358
00:19:56,760 --> 00:20:00,420
They saw what they think they could do with this, you know, who knew back then, right?

359
00:20:00,420 --> 00:20:03,380
And now, over 18 years later, they're the largest independent cloud provider in the

360
00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:07,020
world with 11 data centers around the world.

361
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:11,860
But they really have just kept focused on building the best cloud computing platform

362
00:20:11,860 --> 00:20:15,180
to make it simple, affordable, and accessible to all.

363
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:18,740
Maybe you've been doing this for 20 years, or maybe this is your first project.

364
00:20:18,740 --> 00:20:20,160
Go try out Linode.

365
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:25,420
They've got great documentation, the best customer service, the performance is excellent,

366
00:20:25,420 --> 00:20:27,660
their dashboards are easy to understand.

367
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:32,740
I'm used to like working through those kinds of things, but what impressed me was how the

368
00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:35,940
team has just wrapped their heads around it.

369
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:38,800
Anyone who's wanted to get into it, even people who've never really set up a server can understand

370
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:40,060
that interface.

371
00:20:40,060 --> 00:20:41,060
It really is pretty great.

372
00:20:41,060 --> 00:20:46,020
And they got one click deployments for some of the best open source applications out there.

373
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:49,140
Maybe you're ready to move to your own GitLab instance.

374
00:20:49,140 --> 00:20:51,160
Linode can make that really straightforward.

375
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:54,880
And their pricing is 30 to 50% cheaper than those huge duopolies that want to lock you

376
00:20:54,880 --> 00:21:00,900
into their crazy interfaces with their crazy terminology and processes that are only applicable

377
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:03,060
to that platform.

378
00:21:03,060 --> 00:21:05,460
It's just kind of gross, really.

379
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:09,140
And then Linode backs it with tons of great features and services, stuff that makes the

380
00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:11,820
computing experience even better.

381
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:15,620
Bulletproof backups that are easy to understand exactly where you're at or kick off another

382
00:21:15,620 --> 00:21:18,500
one with status updates on where it's at.

383
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:24,380
Cloud firewalls, S3 compatible object storage, VLAN support, DDoS protection, a powerful

384
00:21:24,380 --> 00:21:26,620
DNS manager, and much, much more.

385
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:27,620
So go check it out.

386
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:30,860
I can tell you about it all day long, but you got to experience it.

387
00:21:30,860 --> 00:21:34,100
And that $100 really does let you try it out.

388
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:36,180
So go to linode.com slash coder.

389
00:21:36,180 --> 00:21:45,060
Get $100 for 60 days on a new account, and you support the show, linode.com slash coder.

390
00:21:45,060 --> 00:21:48,900
During the Epic versus Apple lawsuit, I don't know if this made it on the air.

391
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:50,540
I think it did, but maybe it didn't.

392
00:21:50,540 --> 00:21:52,020
But we definitely discussed it off air.

393
00:21:52,020 --> 00:22:02,140
It looked like Apple was implying that Microsoft was behind the scenes giving Epic lawyer time,

394
00:22:02,140 --> 00:22:06,900
emails, information to help Epic win their fight against Apple.

395
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:10,540
And Mike and I remember we both saw this and we're like, this is a weird thing for Apple

396
00:22:10,540 --> 00:22:11,540
to claim.

397
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:12,540
You remember that little exchange?

398
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:13,540
Yeah.

399
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:14,540
Yeah.

400
00:22:14,540 --> 00:22:15,540
It seemed a little odd.

401
00:22:15,540 --> 00:22:19,240
Well, it turns out it was true.

402
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:28,780
Now we know because 35 US states led by Utah and Microsoft have officially thrown their

403
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:31,900
weight behind Epic's appeal.

404
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:36,300
And in addition to that, get ready for this.

405
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:43,220
The Biden administration is also joining this pack in the appeal against the Apple versus

406
00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:44,220
Epic decision.

407
00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:48,180
That's an allegedly neutral party, though, right?

408
00:22:48,180 --> 00:22:53,980
Where the federal government and White House leads, Microsoft always follows.

409
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:56,660
This has been a very common thing, if you notice, like with the whole tick tock thing

410
00:22:56,660 --> 00:23:02,000
with Trump, when it comes to the Pentagon stuff, there is a real tight connection between

411
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:06,060
what the White House wants and what Microsoft is willing to do.

412
00:23:06,060 --> 00:23:07,860
And I've noticed that for a while.

413
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:10,380
So it's no accident, I think, that this has been going on.

414
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:12,420
This is fascinating.

415
00:23:12,420 --> 00:23:20,380
Because you've got these 35 states, Utah at the top, you got Microsoft and the Biden administration,

416
00:23:20,380 --> 00:23:25,060
supposedly being neutral, that are all now gunning, along with Epic, that are all now

417
00:23:25,060 --> 00:23:27,180
gunning for this appeal.

418
00:23:27,180 --> 00:23:32,800
I'm just kind of taking all of this in, trying to figure out like, what's the end game here?

419
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:34,620
Because they're not going to stop with Apple, right?

420
00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:36,260
They're going after Google.

421
00:23:36,260 --> 00:23:44,780
So Microsoft is kind of using the very system that came after them around Internet Explorer,

422
00:23:44,780 --> 00:23:48,940
hobbled them for a decade plus, and now has made them a compliant lapdog of the federal

423
00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:49,940
government.

424
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:55,780
Microsoft is now using that very tool, that was probably an awful experience for them,

425
00:23:55,780 --> 00:24:00,100
to go after their two biggest competitors, Apple and Google.

426
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:05,720
They're taking the machine that chewed them up, and now they're turning it against their

427
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:10,260
competitors in what is an absolute killer move.

428
00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:16,580
I think this is, right here, showing us that Microsoft has not lost its teeth, it's just

429
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:19,380
been doing more kind of behind the scenes stuff.

430
00:24:19,380 --> 00:24:23,780
But now with everyone's cards on the table, they had to put their name out there because

431
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:26,780
they had to go in on this appeal.

432
00:24:26,780 --> 00:24:32,920
They were perfectly happy remaining a silent player in this, even though Apple's lawyers

433
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:36,140
did try to out them, it just never got any traction.

434
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:42,100
And still no one's really talking about it, but it's right here, Fosspatent has the filings,

435
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:46,580
and it all started because they wanted to slip an app store into Fortnite, Epic did.

436
00:24:46,580 --> 00:24:48,740
Now what, Microsoft wants Game Pass.

437
00:24:48,740 --> 00:24:51,260
I think that's what pissed off Microsoft and got them involved.

438
00:24:51,260 --> 00:24:53,580
You sound like very excited about this.

439
00:24:53,580 --> 00:24:55,740
I think it's going to be a hell of a fight.

440
00:24:55,740 --> 00:25:01,500
Has Apple raised the cost of software to the end consumer?

441
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:02,940
Or cost to be raised?

442
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:06,460
I would say it's caused the cost of software to be lowered.

443
00:25:06,460 --> 00:25:07,460
Then you're beat.

444
00:25:07,460 --> 00:25:08,460
You're beat.

445
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:09,460
That's it.

446
00:25:09,460 --> 00:25:10,460
You got nothing.

447
00:25:10,460 --> 00:25:11,460
Right?

448
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:15,620
In the EU, you've got something, but you know how we feel about the EU.

449
00:25:15,620 --> 00:25:17,140
You got nothing in the United States.

450
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:21,620
Antitrust is, did they raise, did it cause prices to go up for the consumer?

451
00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:22,620
Yes or no?

452
00:25:22,620 --> 00:25:28,020
The answer is no, because they've basically destroyed small development jobs.

453
00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:29,020
You're done.

454
00:25:29,020 --> 00:25:30,020
Right?

455
00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:33,020
So all they've done is taken value from independent developers.

456
00:25:33,020 --> 00:25:37,060
Now if a law were to be changed, that would be different, right?

457
00:25:37,060 --> 00:25:43,440
If Congress got out of what I can only consider its 30 year bender, maybe they could do something

458
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:45,620
and sober up for a day or two.

459
00:25:45,620 --> 00:25:49,740
It's funny because I keep reading these stories about Apple and I am very much on the side

460
00:25:49,740 --> 00:25:52,880
of this is horrible, this shouldn't exist.

461
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:57,900
If I understand what I'm reading about the law and what kind of very, very smart legal

462
00:25:57,900 --> 00:26:03,780
analysts are writing, Apple's mean, but being a dick is not illegal.

463
00:26:03,780 --> 00:26:04,780
It's just not.

464
00:26:04,780 --> 00:26:05,780
Right?

465
00:26:05,780 --> 00:26:07,280
Being super powerful is not illegal.

466
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:08,440
I can see that.

467
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:15,360
And I think what the hope is, is that new precedent or new law gets created as a result.

468
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:17,780
You know, some Congress critter wakes up, but-

469
00:26:17,780 --> 00:26:20,260
So Tim Cook calls Nancy Pelosi a few more times.

470
00:26:20,260 --> 00:26:21,260
Yeah.

471
00:26:21,260 --> 00:26:27,140
So I also struggle to actually understand what Apple did wrong here.

472
00:26:27,140 --> 00:26:30,980
I wish there wasn't a green versus blue bubble thing that they had iMessages for Android.

473
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:34,900
I wish they had third party payment options for the app store.

474
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:37,540
I wish they didn't take such a commission, right?

475
00:26:37,540 --> 00:26:42,660
But I also wish that Walmart let me buy music that has swearing in it.

476
00:26:42,660 --> 00:26:43,760
It's their store.

477
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:45,220
They make the rules.

478
00:26:45,220 --> 00:26:47,160
That's always been the case.

479
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:51,980
And even just this quarter, they weren't the top phone maker.

480
00:26:51,980 --> 00:26:55,580
Samsung took the top spot for smartphones in 2021.

481
00:26:55,580 --> 00:26:56,580
For 2021.

482
00:26:56,580 --> 00:26:58,820
Samsung has 20% of the market.

483
00:26:58,820 --> 00:27:01,180
They sold 272 million phones.

484
00:27:01,180 --> 00:27:04,060
There are more Samsung phones than there are iPhones.

485
00:27:04,060 --> 00:27:06,760
And Samsung is just one brand of Android.

486
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:09,460
So I don't buy the monopoly argument here.

487
00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:11,100
I just don't buy that.

488
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:13,060
And I also don't buy that Epic's the victim.

489
00:27:13,060 --> 00:27:14,460
They knew the rules of the store.

490
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:18,260
I don't like the rules, but they knew the rules of the store and they shipped an app

491
00:27:18,260 --> 00:27:21,180
store in their crappy gaming app.

492
00:27:21,180 --> 00:27:26,700
So I feel like what's happened here, and I really hate to say this because it makes me

493
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:30,820
sound like I'm defending Apple, but I'm just telling you like I see it.

494
00:27:30,820 --> 00:27:34,060
I think Apple built the best product.

495
00:27:34,060 --> 00:27:36,020
They brought a lot of customers.

496
00:27:36,020 --> 00:27:40,340
And now the losers are trying to use the legal system to punish Apple.

497
00:27:40,340 --> 00:27:44,460
But Apple didn't do it by like how Microsoft did it back in the day where they bullied

498
00:27:44,460 --> 00:27:49,520
OEMs into shipping Windows and Internet Explorer and threatened to break them if they didn't

499
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:50,780
do it, right?

500
00:27:50,780 --> 00:27:52,700
Apple didn't pull those kind of moves.

501
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:57,980
They just built a good product with really strict, clear rules that everybody understood

502
00:27:57,980 --> 00:27:58,980
up front.

503
00:27:58,980 --> 00:28:01,260
These are the rules of the land.

504
00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:03,420
And consumers responded to that.

505
00:28:03,420 --> 00:28:07,180
And for some consumers, it meant they can now install apps on their phone without worrying

506
00:28:07,180 --> 00:28:08,180
about it being malware.

507
00:28:08,180 --> 00:28:09,820
Like that's a huge game changer, right?

508
00:28:09,820 --> 00:28:11,260
Yeah, I absolutely agree.

509
00:28:11,260 --> 00:28:14,020
So my thinking on all this Apple stuff has evolved.

510
00:28:14,020 --> 00:28:17,700
There's two types of Apple, let's call it dickery.

511
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:22,140
There's kind of accidental dickery or like kind of petulant dickery.

512
00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:26,820
So for instance, I consider all the stuff we're like, oh my God, a formal Apple engineers

513
00:28:26,820 --> 00:28:27,820
app is on the App Store.

514
00:28:27,820 --> 00:28:29,460
But you know who really cares about that?

515
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:30,780
Indies, people like me, right?

516
00:28:30,780 --> 00:28:34,180
That doesn't matter for the mass market because, okay, they did their friend a favor.

517
00:28:34,180 --> 00:28:36,520
They featured their stuff, whatever.

518
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:37,620
And there's accidents, right?

519
00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:41,180
Where the rules are a little vague and like one reviewer sees it this way and another

520
00:28:41,180 --> 00:28:42,180
sees it that way.

521
00:28:42,180 --> 00:28:46,140
And sometimes things get approved and then not approved or you can, you know, I've had

522
00:28:46,140 --> 00:28:48,540
those awkward back and forths.

523
00:28:48,540 --> 00:28:51,440
That's like just incidental in a way.

524
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:53,880
That's kind of, well, it's a huge App Store.

525
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:55,780
There's always going to be some failure rate.

526
00:28:55,780 --> 00:28:57,580
Think about, think about our own code, right?

527
00:28:57,580 --> 00:29:01,260
There's always some percentage of functions that are buggy.

528
00:29:01,260 --> 00:29:04,660
The other kind is they're not making a mistake.

529
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:08,020
They're doing it on purpose because it's their business model.

530
00:29:08,020 --> 00:29:10,860
I would just call it, you know, looking out for themselves.

531
00:29:10,860 --> 00:29:14,540
I mean, they just got another pissing context with, what was it?

532
00:29:14,540 --> 00:29:15,540
Is it Denmark or?

533
00:29:15,540 --> 00:29:16,540
Yeah.

534
00:29:16,540 --> 00:29:17,540
The Netherlands.

535
00:29:17,540 --> 00:29:18,540
Yeah.

536
00:29:18,540 --> 00:29:19,540
Yeah.

537
00:29:19,540 --> 00:29:20,540
And they don't care, right?

538
00:29:20,540 --> 00:29:23,780
Because they're in the business of the App Store in the eighties.

539
00:29:23,780 --> 00:29:25,660
We decided to change the standard, right?

540
00:29:25,660 --> 00:29:30,060
Robert Bork, you should listen to the verge if you don't, you learn a lot.

541
00:29:30,060 --> 00:29:36,540
And a standard has changed and on the existing standard of what a monopoly is.

542
00:29:36,540 --> 00:29:40,540
They are certainly not a monopoly in any way, shape or form.

543
00:29:40,540 --> 00:29:46,820
And they have not caused prices for consumers of software to rise.

544
00:29:46,820 --> 00:29:47,900
This is my thing.

545
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:53,100
And while I wish it had to be an open App Store, I wish I had this, I could sideload.

546
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:57,100
I wish that iMessage wasn't a siloed platform.

547
00:29:57,100 --> 00:30:00,460
I failed to actually understand what law they broke.

548
00:30:00,460 --> 00:30:05,420
And so where I kind of begin to backslide into, and I'd love the audience's thoughts

549
00:30:05,420 --> 00:30:09,020
on this is maybe, maybe I'm missing, maybe they did break some law here.

550
00:30:09,020 --> 00:30:15,380
But it seems to me like what we're saying is if you just do a really good job, become

551
00:30:15,380 --> 00:30:20,640
super successful, ultimately corporations will work with the government to come after

552
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:23,460
you to take some of that success away.

553
00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:27,460
And so you kind of get punished if you break the law and you kind of get punished if you

554
00:30:27,460 --> 00:30:28,660
don't break the law.

555
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:30,420
There really seems to be no difference.

556
00:30:30,420 --> 00:30:34,500
In fact, often it seems like people that break the law get away with things for longer.

557
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:38,420
All they've done here is build a platform that has a lot of users, but they don't even

558
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:40,580
have the majority of users.

559
00:30:40,580 --> 00:30:45,660
What they did was they did what Apple always does and what every luxury brand does.

560
00:30:45,660 --> 00:30:48,340
They targeted the whales, right?

561
00:30:48,340 --> 00:30:50,900
They targeted the people who are actually willing to spend money, frankly, it almost

562
00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:53,260
goes back to our Linux desktop conversation.

563
00:30:53,260 --> 00:30:58,140
But also Apple also has like been screwed in cases like this, not legal cases, but they

564
00:30:58,140 --> 00:31:04,020
had a lawsuit with Qualcomm about the antenna, LTE antenna licensing.

565
00:31:04,020 --> 00:31:05,020
I recall, yeah.

566
00:31:05,020 --> 00:31:11,220
Because Intel was so this is not a, this is a true story, so at making the parts that

567
00:31:11,220 --> 00:31:15,220
Apple needed, they ended up having to settle with Qualcomm, right?

568
00:31:15,220 --> 00:31:20,460
They bought into, they bought this division of Intel's modem business settled with Qualcomm

569
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:28,000
because this is a problem I think I in the past and many of our listeners have at their

570
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:33,100
scale, it is not about like their feelings or emotions.

571
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:34,100
It's a business.

572
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:37,460
So did Apple want to pay Qualcomm stupid percentage of the phone?

573
00:31:37,460 --> 00:31:39,340
No, that's why they sued them.

574
00:31:39,340 --> 00:31:40,820
But when Intel couldn't deliver, guess what?

575
00:31:40,820 --> 00:31:41,820
They sucked it up.

576
00:31:41,820 --> 00:31:46,140
Sally, they paid Qualcomm and they bought the people from Intel kind of as a hedge.

577
00:31:46,140 --> 00:31:47,260
Intel continued.

578
00:31:47,260 --> 00:31:49,780
Why are there no Nvidia MacBooks anymore?

579
00:31:49,780 --> 00:31:55,740
Well, the story is that in two, I might get the year wrong so we can correct it next week.

580
00:31:55,740 --> 00:31:57,740
I think it was like 12 or 13 was it?

581
00:31:57,740 --> 00:32:00,580
Yeah, there was 12 or 13, one of the first aluminum MacBook Pros.

582
00:32:00,580 --> 00:32:02,060
Might've been a little earlier.

583
00:32:02,060 --> 00:32:03,700
The Nvidia chips overheated.

584
00:32:03,700 --> 00:32:08,540
I had one of these all the time and Nvidia would not pony up for the repairs.

585
00:32:08,540 --> 00:32:12,380
Though Apple got pissed and decided they didn't want to deal with Nvidia.

586
00:32:12,380 --> 00:32:13,380
But guess what?

587
00:32:13,380 --> 00:32:14,380
They did that because it cost them money.

588
00:32:14,380 --> 00:32:15,380
Right?

589
00:32:15,380 --> 00:32:16,380
They didn't do it because they were...

590
00:32:16,380 --> 00:32:17,380
Right.

591
00:32:17,380 --> 00:32:18,380
They paid for the repairs.

592
00:32:18,380 --> 00:32:19,740
They wanted Nvidia to help out and Nvidia refused.

593
00:32:19,740 --> 00:32:20,740
Right.

594
00:32:20,740 --> 00:32:22,860
They took care of the end customer, myself included.

595
00:32:22,860 --> 00:32:24,860
And you know, so I don't know.

596
00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:29,900
I mean, I also like as much as I would like to see the apps to open up, it is real unfair

597
00:32:29,900 --> 00:32:34,620
if we can go back and retroactively change laws and say that, well, this thing that was

598
00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:39,940
okay, even though it's kind of of you is now not okay.

599
00:32:39,940 --> 00:32:42,640
And we're going to go back and punish you for what you did before, even though we said

600
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:43,640
it was okay.

601
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:44,780
I mean, how can you do that?

602
00:32:44,780 --> 00:32:45,780
You can't...

603
00:32:45,780 --> 00:32:51,820
I feel like you just can't unring the spell in a way that isn't like pure straight up,

604
00:32:51,820 --> 00:32:55,220
you know, big brother comes in and literally says, or we'll throw you in jail.

605
00:32:55,220 --> 00:33:00,540
It does go back to our discussion about Linux desktop users being willing to pay.

606
00:33:00,540 --> 00:33:05,220
Because when you're a business and you're looking at markets to address for your product,

607
00:33:05,220 --> 00:33:06,620
you consider those kinds of things.

608
00:33:06,620 --> 00:33:11,260
And Apple has decided, and they figured this out a while ago, we're going after a percentage

609
00:33:11,260 --> 00:33:18,280
of the market that is willing to have a credit card on file with us all the time.

610
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:20,340
That's like a baseline for an Apple customer.

611
00:33:20,340 --> 00:33:21,580
You got to have an Apple account.

612
00:33:21,580 --> 00:33:24,340
You need to get a form of payment on file.

613
00:33:24,340 --> 00:33:27,620
That eliminates a good percentage of Linux users right there, right?

614
00:33:27,620 --> 00:33:29,500
But they know what their demographic is.

615
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:33,460
So they build a product that will sell to that demographic.

616
00:33:33,460 --> 00:33:38,820
And they realized that the App Store could address an issue that has traditionally plagued

617
00:33:38,820 --> 00:33:41,740
large platforms like Windows.

618
00:33:41,740 --> 00:33:45,040
And thank God they did because it would have been a nightmare if they hadn't.

619
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:50,860
And so they built a product with the App Store that involved that crappy review process that

620
00:33:50,860 --> 00:33:56,460
involved sandboxing, but at the end it meant you could pop on an app on your phone like

621
00:33:56,460 --> 00:33:57,880
it's candy and try it out.

622
00:33:57,880 --> 00:34:01,940
They trusted these things, so they'd be willing to try out some app called Candy Crush and

623
00:34:01,940 --> 00:34:02,940
install it on their phone.

624
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:04,940
And that changed the market.

625
00:34:04,940 --> 00:34:08,460
They truly did innovate in that regard.

626
00:34:08,460 --> 00:34:10,980
And the market rewarded them for it.

627
00:34:10,980 --> 00:34:15,860
Yeah, I keep like, and I know I rail against the App Store all the time, I struggle to

628
00:34:15,860 --> 00:34:20,740
see what a better system would be like for people who are effectively like our non-technical

629
00:34:20,740 --> 00:34:22,940
family members, and I'm sure we all have them.

630
00:34:22,940 --> 00:34:28,020
Because for us, fine, yes, I know how to go into my Discover Card app and create a one-time

631
00:34:28,020 --> 00:34:31,300
use credit card number if I'm on Joe Blow's website, right?

632
00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:32,300
Fine.

633
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:36,100
Honestly, I don't want my mom to be able to input a random credit card into an iPhone

634
00:34:36,100 --> 00:34:37,100
app.

635
00:34:37,100 --> 00:34:38,100
I just don't.

636
00:34:38,100 --> 00:34:39,100
I think it's bad.

637
00:34:39,100 --> 00:34:45,380
And she's a pretty technical person, but I don't want my dad in his late 70s doing it.

638
00:34:45,380 --> 00:34:50,020
There's a reason that you're not seeing independent developers blogging about the glory that

639
00:34:50,020 --> 00:34:53,500
is the Amazon Fire app store, because it's a piece of shit.

640
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:58,060
Windows Phone, my beloved, my beloved, failed.

641
00:34:58,060 --> 00:35:01,460
Because you know why Microsoft failed?

642
00:35:01,460 --> 00:35:06,320
Microsoft is really good to developers, really bad to customers, right?

643
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:09,740
Microsoft worked with the carriers as partners because they're also their customers.

644
00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:14,100
Where Apple, Apple's big innovation, I would argue, forget the APIs, they always say it's

645
00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:16,140
the APIs, screw the APIs.

646
00:35:16,140 --> 00:35:19,540
The security stuff, you can make arguments against it.

647
00:35:19,540 --> 00:35:23,500
It was getting the carriers out of that transaction with the end customer.

648
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:26,100
Yeah, it was saying no to Verizon.

649
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:28,360
Java ME was a nightmare.

650
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:33,660
You might get, what, 5%, 10% of your app, and that's if the carrier and the phone manufacturer

651
00:35:33,660 --> 00:35:36,900
were doing what it was really to have your phone pre-installed, unless we want to talk

652
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:42,740
about POM, and if you want to talk about POM, we'll cry about WebOS together.

653
00:35:42,740 --> 00:35:43,740
It's fine.

654
00:35:43,740 --> 00:35:48,500
But I don't know, should they have this, quote, control?

655
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:49,500
It made the difference, right?

656
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:55,340
I had a Sprint Android phone that would get push notifications about football team wins.

657
00:35:55,340 --> 00:35:56,780
There's nothing I could do to remove the app.

658
00:35:56,780 --> 00:36:02,100
Oh, I had that on my first smartphone, was a Verizon Droid, and it really, really thought

659
00:36:02,100 --> 00:36:03,100
I liked football.

660
00:36:03,100 --> 00:36:04,100
Yeah, same thing.

661
00:36:04,100 --> 00:36:08,380
Yeah, and I did not care at all, and I kept getting push notifications about it, and that's

662
00:36:08,380 --> 00:36:10,540
when I realized this really matters.

663
00:36:10,540 --> 00:36:11,820
This really matters.

664
00:36:11,820 --> 00:36:16,300
And that was an innovation, and it did change the market, and it did get them a lot of customers.

665
00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:21,180
We're never going to be able to educate the average Joe user, Joe or Jane user.

666
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:25,780
I think one of the mistakes a lot of us in our community make is a lot of the things

667
00:36:25,780 --> 00:36:31,340
we just take for granted as like, oh, of course, you have 2FA on, right, naturally.

668
00:36:31,340 --> 00:36:34,820
That's a big hurdle for a lot of people, and that's just one instance.

669
00:36:34,820 --> 00:36:35,820
I don't know.

670
00:36:35,820 --> 00:36:36,820
If not them, then who?

671
00:36:36,820 --> 00:36:42,540
I certainly don't want, again, my dad or mom or whoever is cell phone to be as open

672
00:36:42,540 --> 00:36:43,540
as a Windows PC.

673
00:36:43,540 --> 00:36:45,260
How many times have I had to reinstall Windows?

674
00:36:45,260 --> 00:36:46,540
Or Android, to be honest.

675
00:36:46,540 --> 00:36:47,540
They don't get Androids.

676
00:36:47,540 --> 00:36:48,540
Android doesn't exist.

677
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:53,860
I legitimately bought my mom an iPhone and just said, here, mom, take this.

678
00:36:53,860 --> 00:36:55,820
I cannot handle this.

679
00:36:55,820 --> 00:36:59,940
She lost all of her pictures twice on Android.

680
00:36:59,940 --> 00:37:03,340
She had years of issues, and she just kept going in, and the carrier would just like

681
00:37:03,340 --> 00:37:08,020
sell her on a phone, and it was always the Android phone, and it was an absolute disaster.

682
00:37:08,020 --> 00:37:12,500
They give her just an unbelievably cheap phone that had maybe 16 gigs of storage.

683
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:14,140
It's just painful.

684
00:37:14,140 --> 00:37:18,460
So I eventually just bought her an iPhone and said, here, mom, just use this.

685
00:37:18,460 --> 00:37:19,540
And it's been great.

686
00:37:19,540 --> 00:37:22,660
Your mom could drive to an Apple store if there's one by her and be like, hey, my phone's

687
00:37:22,660 --> 00:37:23,660
not working.

688
00:37:23,660 --> 00:37:30,540
And most of the time, they'll just fix it with very little questioning.

689
00:37:30,540 --> 00:37:33,180
Datadog.com slash Coder Radio.

690
00:37:33,180 --> 00:37:34,180

710
00:38:50,900 --> 00:38:53,380
The iPad, however, not doing so well.

711
00:38:53,380 --> 00:38:57,580
iPad sales are down, Mac sales are up, iPad sales down.

712
00:38:57,580 --> 00:39:00,380
So Google feels like tablets are the future.

713
00:39:00,380 --> 00:39:05,100
Google says that they're focusing on tablets, they've staffed up a new division.

714
00:39:05,100 --> 00:39:09,140
We believe they say the future of computing is shifting towards a more powerful and capable

715
00:39:09,140 --> 00:39:10,140
tablet.

716
00:39:10,140 --> 00:39:14,140
We're working to deliver the next chapter of computing and input by launching seamless

717
00:39:14,140 --> 00:39:19,180
support across our platform and hero experiences that unlock new and better ways of being productive

718
00:39:19,180 --> 00:39:20,420
and creative.

719
00:39:20,420 --> 00:39:21,420
This is great.

720
00:39:21,420 --> 00:39:22,740
It's 2011 again.

721
00:39:22,740 --> 00:39:23,740
Everything's awesome.

722
00:39:23,740 --> 00:39:25,020
I mean, I love this.

723
00:39:25,020 --> 00:39:26,860
This is how I knew this was going to be awful.

724
00:39:26,860 --> 00:39:30,500
They are doing the thing that they did originally, where they're going to take the current version

725
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:33,180
of Android and fork it for tablets.

726
00:39:33,180 --> 00:39:34,540
It's Honeycomb part two.

727
00:39:34,540 --> 00:39:35,540
They're doing the same thing.

728
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:36,540
Yeah.

729
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:42,780
So they're going to have Android 12L, a mid-cycle release of Android that's dedicated to tablet

730
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:43,780
functionality.

731
00:39:43,780 --> 00:39:45,780
Oh, they won't learn.

732
00:39:45,780 --> 00:39:46,780
No.

733
00:39:46,780 --> 00:39:48,420
Why won't they learn?

734
00:39:48,420 --> 00:39:50,740
I can't believe they're going to try this again.

735
00:39:50,740 --> 00:39:56,700
They have job openings for it and they also want to develop relationships with developers

736
00:39:56,700 --> 00:40:01,900
to create ink first hero apps, is their quote.

737
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:04,620
Oh, sweet mother of pearl.

738
00:40:04,620 --> 00:40:07,540
Ink first, which probably just means, you know, they're going to have a big focus on

739
00:40:07,540 --> 00:40:08,540
pen input.

740
00:40:08,540 --> 00:40:09,540
So all these things are coming with.

741
00:40:09,540 --> 00:40:10,660
Oh, that sounds fun.

742
00:40:10,660 --> 00:40:14,380
So when people buy the cheapest possible stylus and the cheapest possible tablet and your

743
00:40:14,380 --> 00:40:16,140
app doesn't work right and you have to.

744
00:40:16,140 --> 00:40:18,820
Because it will be a race to the bottom, like it always is with these things.

745
00:40:18,820 --> 00:40:19,820
Absolutely.

746
00:40:19,820 --> 00:40:22,740
It'll be, well, the carriers need something to give away to get you to sign that extra

747
00:40:22,740 --> 00:40:23,740
data plan.

748
00:40:23,740 --> 00:40:27,600
Oh man, I wonder how bad this is going to go.

749
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:31,260
In some ways, I've always felt Android is actually a better tablet platform.

750
00:40:31,260 --> 00:40:32,260
I agree with that.

751
00:40:32,260 --> 00:40:35,860
I've liked iPhone with iOS and I've liked Android on a tablet.

752
00:40:35,860 --> 00:40:36,860
I always thought that was nice.

753
00:40:36,860 --> 00:40:41,740
Well, I see for me, Android would be great on the tablet as a, like an internal enterprise

754
00:40:41,740 --> 00:40:43,300
tool for customers, right?

755
00:40:43,300 --> 00:40:47,020
Developed Android is what I do a lot with the surface right now.

756
00:40:47,020 --> 00:40:52,940
The problem is that the minute you give them the Android option, everybody's looking at

757
00:40:52,940 --> 00:40:57,860
the cheapest tablets they can find and your, your code ends up having to apologize for

758
00:40:57,860 --> 00:40:59,860
whatever crap they bought on AliExpress.

759
00:40:59,860 --> 00:41:03,780
So yeah, absolutely, I've had some great apps that just run absolutely horrible on cheap

760
00:41:03,780 --> 00:41:04,780
Android tablets.

761
00:41:04,780 --> 00:41:10,140
You know, I was chatting actually with some folks last night at the meetup and how kind

762
00:41:10,140 --> 00:41:12,580
of funny it is cheaper these days.

763
00:41:12,580 --> 00:41:19,940
If you want to get, say the magic keyboard with an iPad, you just better off getting

764
00:41:19,940 --> 00:41:22,620
a MacBook Air, a low end MacBook Air.

765
00:41:22,620 --> 00:41:28,700
It's cheaper to get a Mac than it is to get a fully decked out iPad tablet these days.

766
00:41:28,700 --> 00:41:31,220
That's got to be why Apple's iPad sales are down.

767
00:41:31,220 --> 00:41:35,540
And I'd like to know how Google is going to solve that problem because Chromebooks are

768
00:41:35,540 --> 00:41:40,740
essentially sort of offering the same kind of value story.

769
00:41:40,740 --> 00:41:46,020
So the only real way I could see them offering something competitive there is if they tried

770
00:41:46,020 --> 00:41:47,020
to make them cheap.

771
00:41:47,020 --> 00:41:50,700
They're either going to go the pro route and make them way too expensive or they're going

772
00:41:50,700 --> 00:41:52,180
to have to do the race to the bottom.

773
00:41:52,180 --> 00:41:53,460
They're going to make them cheap.

774
00:41:53,460 --> 00:41:54,460
There's no way they're not.

775
00:41:54,460 --> 00:41:55,460
Yeah.

776
00:41:55,460 --> 00:41:56,460
When they say they're working with OEMs.

777
00:41:56,460 --> 00:41:57,460
Yeah.

778
00:41:57,460 --> 00:41:59,980
Google are bad people doing bad things for bad reasons.

779
00:41:59,980 --> 00:42:01,340
Google doesn't work well, do they?

780
00:42:01,340 --> 00:42:02,980
They just are broken.

781
00:42:02,980 --> 00:42:04,900
Google is not good at making hardware.

782
00:42:04,900 --> 00:42:05,900
You know what they were good at making?

783
00:42:05,900 --> 00:42:06,900
Wave.

784
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:07,900
And they killed it.

785
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:08,900
God damn it.

786
00:42:08,900 --> 00:42:09,900
Wow.

787
00:42:09,900 --> 00:42:10,900
Nice.

788
00:42:10,900 --> 00:42:11,900
Another one every week.

789
00:42:11,900 --> 00:42:12,900
You're on a streak.

790
00:42:12,900 --> 00:42:13,900
I love it, dude.

791
00:42:13,900 --> 00:42:14,900
That's fantastic.

792
00:42:14,900 --> 00:42:15,900
I have to say.

793
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:20,300
Yeah, I'm just surprised that there's no mechanism internally that sort of checks this stuff.

794
00:42:20,300 --> 00:42:22,220
At least it seems outwardly there is.

795
00:42:22,220 --> 00:42:25,260
They bought Motorola at one point and they were like, oh no, what are we doing?

796
00:42:25,260 --> 00:42:26,420
This is crazy.

797
00:42:26,420 --> 00:42:28,220
You would hope internally, right?

798
00:42:28,220 --> 00:42:31,980
They've looked and said, okay, when we did Honeycomb, which right, these are back like

799
00:42:31,980 --> 00:42:34,020
Android three, Android four days.

800
00:42:34,020 --> 00:42:35,020
It's three.

801
00:42:35,020 --> 00:42:36,020
Honeycomb is three.

802
00:42:36,020 --> 00:42:37,020
They just had a bump, right?

803
00:42:37,020 --> 00:42:41,660
Honeycomb is three point X, which is important because it ended up diverging quite a bit

804
00:42:41,660 --> 00:42:43,380
from from main, right?

805
00:42:43,380 --> 00:42:45,660
So that's that's why this is bad.

806
00:42:45,660 --> 00:42:46,660
Right.

807
00:42:46,660 --> 00:42:48,980
There's like a whole UI change right around then.

808
00:42:48,980 --> 00:42:49,980
It's it's a big divergence.

809
00:42:49,980 --> 00:42:50,980
Yeah.

810
00:42:50,980 --> 00:42:51,980
I see that way.

811
00:42:51,980 --> 00:42:52,980
Yeah.

812
00:42:52,980 --> 00:42:53,980
You got to hope internally.

813
00:42:53,980 --> 00:42:58,220
Okay, team, what did we do wrong back then?

814
00:42:58,220 --> 00:42:59,220
You forked it.

815
00:42:59,220 --> 00:43:00,220
Yeah.

816
00:43:00,220 --> 00:43:01,220
And then they just repeated that mistake, though.

817
00:43:01,220 --> 00:43:02,220
Yeah.

818
00:43:02,220 --> 00:43:06,900
I mean, and but in all fairness, obviously, iPad OS is a fork, right?

819
00:43:06,900 --> 00:43:12,460
But they did that at a time when they were developing the OS and when they announced

820
00:43:12,460 --> 00:43:16,580
the next version, they announced that they were separating the OS is right.

821
00:43:16,580 --> 00:43:19,900
They did it at release time where this is mid cycle.

822
00:43:19,900 --> 00:43:24,500
They are forking mid cycle, which means Android 13 will be a totally different thing and there

823
00:43:24,500 --> 00:43:27,100
will still be Android 12 L users out there.

824
00:43:27,100 --> 00:43:28,100
Yes.

825
00:43:28,100 --> 00:43:29,100
Okay.

826
00:43:29,100 --> 00:43:34,460
So iPad OS is a fork, but that often remerges with the main, right?

827
00:43:34,460 --> 00:43:37,760
I would say iPad OS is a fork on layers, Android.

828
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:42,800
The way they seem to have done it is Honeycomb, for lack of a better word, or Android tablet

829
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:46,900
is effectively its only it's like the Huawei derivative of Android, right?

830
00:43:46,900 --> 00:43:49,100
It's like its own thing.

831
00:43:49,100 --> 00:43:55,560
And so far, I mean, iPad OS 15 point whatever and iPhone OS 15 point whatever are are super

832
00:43:55,560 --> 00:43:56,740
close to each other.

833
00:43:56,740 --> 00:44:01,100
You know, there's a bunch of get merges there that have happened over and over again, right?

834
00:44:01,100 --> 00:44:02,100
Yeah.

835
00:44:02,100 --> 00:44:03,100
Oh, man.

836
00:44:03,100 --> 00:44:04,100
What an embarrassment.

837
00:44:04,100 --> 00:44:06,340
I kind of I'd be curious, though.

838
00:44:06,340 --> 00:44:11,020
You know, I'll watch I'm going to keep an open mind if they could come out with an iPad

839
00:44:11,020 --> 00:44:17,140
pro like tablet that had a good quality keyboard, some decent apps.

840
00:44:17,140 --> 00:44:20,740
You know, I'd consider it.

841
00:44:20,740 --> 00:44:21,740
I would love it.

842
00:44:21,740 --> 00:44:27,180
I mean, for these enterprise cases, I would much rather be doing Android than Windows

843
00:44:27,180 --> 00:44:30,260
for reasons of, you know, good Windows tablets.

844
00:44:30,260 --> 00:44:31,260
There's like three.

845
00:44:31,260 --> 00:44:32,260
They're all made by Microsoft.

846
00:44:32,260 --> 00:44:33,740
There you go.

847
00:44:33,740 --> 00:44:37,660
I think these iPad sales are cyclical.

848
00:44:37,660 --> 00:44:42,300
Last night, my wife was kind of giving me a hard time because she would like an iPad

849
00:44:42,300 --> 00:44:47,900
with an LTE connection because she's doing mobile care now after the covid shutdown.

850
00:44:47,900 --> 00:44:50,620
So she's now doing where she's going out to see clients.

851
00:44:50,620 --> 00:44:55,980
And so she'd love to have an iPad for her chart notes instead of having to take a tablet.

852
00:44:55,980 --> 00:44:57,940
And she's like, you know, I have expected you.

853
00:44:57,940 --> 00:45:02,020
I expected by now you would have upgraded your iPad because I've had this thing since

854
00:45:02,020 --> 00:45:03,020
2018.

855
00:45:03,020 --> 00:45:09,740
I got the 2018 iPad pro and it's just been such a solid little tablet that I haven't

856
00:45:09,740 --> 00:45:10,740
needed to buy it.

857
00:45:10,740 --> 00:45:11,740
I know you're in a similar situation.

858
00:45:11,740 --> 00:45:15,760
I think a lot of people out there bought in 2018 because that's when they kind of redid

859
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:17,660
the design too.

860
00:45:17,660 --> 00:45:23,260
And I think the sales drop off until Apple really releases a pretty substantial upgrade

861
00:45:23,260 --> 00:45:27,340
and that last one was close, but it's still not quite enough.

862
00:45:27,340 --> 00:45:32,020
I get more and more years out of these iPads than I do out of a laptop.

863
00:45:32,020 --> 00:45:34,300
And that's got to affect the sales as well.

864
00:45:34,300 --> 00:45:39,220
And so I am looking for a tablet because my wife would like one for what she does.

865
00:45:39,220 --> 00:45:40,220
So we'll see.

866
00:45:40,220 --> 00:45:43,340
Either I'll end up getting one and she'll take mine or maybe one of these Android ones

867
00:45:43,340 --> 00:45:45,260
will come out and she'll like that.

868
00:45:45,260 --> 00:45:46,260
Keep my eye out.

869
00:45:46,260 --> 00:45:49,040
I do think there is a long term use case for them.

870
00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:52,500
They're not updated as frequently because it's just a slower market.

871
00:45:52,500 --> 00:45:55,420
And for people that are using it, it's like more low key usage.

872
00:45:55,420 --> 00:45:58,940
I want to say thank you to our Coder QA members.

873
00:45:58,940 --> 00:46:02,880
The new Coderly has been put together by Drew and will be out later this week.

874
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:07,860
So if you would like to sign up, you get access to that and all previous Coderly reports.

875
00:46:07,860 --> 00:46:13,460
Go to CoderQA.co or you can become a network member and support all the shows.

876
00:46:13,460 --> 00:46:16,180
It's a great way to help us stay independent.

877
00:46:16,180 --> 00:46:21,860
And anytime we can diversify the income of the network and make sure that a as large

878
00:46:21,860 --> 00:46:27,340
as possible percentage comes from the audience, that is a financial incentive to always just

879
00:46:27,340 --> 00:46:31,860
remain absolutely focused on making our audience happy because they're the ones paying the

880
00:46:31,860 --> 00:46:32,860
bills.

881
00:46:32,860 --> 00:46:36,420
I think it's the best way to fund media personally.

882
00:46:36,420 --> 00:46:40,300
If I could, it'd be the only way media was funded, but we're not there yet.

883
00:46:40,300 --> 00:46:45,260
But you can help us get a little bit closer at CoderQA.co or Jupiter.party for the whole

884
00:46:45,260 --> 00:46:46,260
network.

885
00:46:46,260 --> 00:46:51,140
Well, Mr. Dominic, is there anywhere you'd like to send people before we wrap up this

886
00:46:51,140 --> 00:46:52,140
week?

887
00:46:52,140 --> 00:46:53,940
Follow me on Twitter at Dumanuco.

888
00:46:53,940 --> 00:46:58,980
And if you are in Florida and want to be a Python developer, you should let me know.

889
00:46:58,980 --> 00:46:59,980
Hmm.

890
00:46:59,980 --> 00:47:00,980
Hmm.

891
00:47:00,980 --> 00:47:01,980
Very nice.

892
00:47:01,980 --> 00:47:04,660
Contact the show at Coder.show slash contact.

893
00:47:04,660 --> 00:47:06,700
You can subscribe at Coder.show slash subscribe.

894
00:47:06,700 --> 00:47:09,620
If there's an episode you liked, send it to a friend.

895
00:47:09,620 --> 00:47:12,900
Word of mouth is the best way to help a podcast grow.

896
00:47:12,900 --> 00:47:14,180
We're always appreciative of that, too.

897
00:47:14,180 --> 00:47:16,700
It's a great way to support the show without spending a dime.

898
00:47:16,700 --> 00:47:19,740
But of course, we're just grateful you listen and download as well.

899
00:47:19,740 --> 00:47:20,940
And we'd love to have you join us live.

900
00:47:20,940 --> 00:47:24,500
We do it on Mondays at noon Pacific, 3 p.m. Eastern at jblive.tv.

901
00:47:24,500 --> 00:47:28,980
You can hang out in our chat room, help us title it, do a little pre-show.

902
00:47:28,980 --> 00:47:33,540
Sometimes we get on some topics like we did this week and we get a good discussion going.

903
00:47:33,540 --> 00:47:34,860
Anyways, we'll wrap it up there.

904
00:47:34,860 --> 00:47:37,420
Thanks so much for joining us on this week's episode of the Coder Radio Program.

905
00:47:37,420 --> 00:48:04,060
And we'll see you right back here next week.
