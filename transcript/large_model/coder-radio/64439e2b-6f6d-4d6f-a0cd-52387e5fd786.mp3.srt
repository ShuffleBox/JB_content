00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
This is Koto Radio, episode 344 for February 11th, 2019.

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,560
Welcome to Koto Radio, Jupiter Broadcasting's weekly talk show, taking a

3
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:38,200
pragmatic look at the art and the business of software development and its

4
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:44,960
related technologies. My name is Chris in the rainy, cold Texas area and joining us

5
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:50,700
every single week is our host in Florida, the man who navigates the swamps to be

6
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:56,680
here every single week is Mr. Dominic. Hello Mike. Misa here once again. Oh good,

7
00:00:56,680 --> 00:01:01,120
good. But to make sure we offset all the jar jar, we have been joined by the third

8
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:08,320
pole of our stool and that is the one, the only, Wes Payne. Hello Wes. Hello and

9
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:12,440
don't worry I've got a lightsaber to deal with that jar jar problem. What do

10
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:15,160
you think of being the third leg of the stool, right? Because our stool doesn't

11
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:18,920
hold up properly without that third leg. I will say sometimes you guys are swaying

12
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:23,280
a little bit to and fro but sometimes that's fun. I don't know what

13
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:27,620
that could be caused by. It's good to be back. We wanted to try a

14
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:31,560
little three-way for one episode. We're just trying things out. Wes you have been

15
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:35,280
doing a killer job sitting in. Everybody writes in just says how much they hate

16
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:38,960
it. They're constantly going on about how awful of a job you do. That's how you

17
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:43,760
know you do something right, right? Everybody loves it. Everybody loves it

18
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:47,460
and we got some good feedback into the show so let's start out there. Email

19
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:51,320
comes in from Steve and it's about employment versus self-employment and

20
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:55,240
I'm sensing a theme here. He says I just have a comment regarding an episode a

21
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:59,440
few weeks back regarding being employee or working for oneself. There are

22
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:02,920
definitive benefits if you find the right employer and it looks like Linux

23
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:07,440
Academy is one for Chris. I decided to do what Chris did, accept employment. After

24
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:12,200
all I was struggling as a self-employed individual but this new employer started

25
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:17,080
to change my hours working till 7 or 9 p.m. and they also started to have me do

26
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:22,360
work that I was not hired to do but I continued forward since I appreciated

27
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:26,800
having a regular paycheck. But one morning we received a company-wide

28
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:31,320
notice. Our employer was concerned about how often people went to the bathroom.

29
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:36,560
Shortly after that we had to start asking permission to take a break, eat

30
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:41,880
lunch and so on. I finally had to give my resignation notice. I guess like a

31
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:47,560
marriage the challenge is finding the right mate or employer. Steve that's a

32
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:52,520
great email and so on the panel here Mike you're the self-employed one what

33
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:57,480
are your thoughts on this? So I have never heard of such a crazy like you

34
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:03,280
can sort of situation crazy that's that's pretty terrible I don't have a

35
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:06,200
lot of experience with the whole I get a paycheck every two weeks thing because I

36
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:13,480
was self-employed very young but I you know you know Chris tax and in West tax

37
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:17,760
seasons coming up and it's one of those it's that time of year when I start to

38
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:23,640
think what the hell is wrong with me? It's true. So however someone told me I

39
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:27,480
couldn't take a pee that would I can't even believe we're having this

40
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:34,080
conversation like I know isn't that it's not technically torture like it seems

41
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:39,760
like a huge waste of everyone's time that kind of micromanagement. That's like a

42
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:43,040
full-time job just approving potty breaks. I mean Chris come on you're a

43
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:46,920
big shot VP at a big Linux company now. It's true. If one of your employees got

44
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:49,840
up from his desk was like or your reports got up from his desk to the

45
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:54,560
men's room or the ladies room you wouldn't you know track that right like

46
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:58,000
that seems. Well I mean as Wes knows I did ask him to install that camera there

47
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,680
in his bathroom so we could just keep track of things. Yeah but it's been there

48
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:04,440
for months. Yeah I mean we just need baseline metrics Mike that's all just

49
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:08,120
baselines. I thought that was part of our health initiative now. Well that's for

50
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:13,800
that's why I have the analyzer in the urinal but that's for other reasons. You

51
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:17,120
know I wanted to jump ahead in our in our show notes here and maybe this would

52
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:20,040
be a good time to tackle this story about the psychological trap of

53
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:24,600
freelancing. Not that I'm now I'm not like mr. anti freelance anti independent

54
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:27,680
work I don't mean to come across that way. You're like a reformed alcoholic it's

55
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:34,880
terrible. A little bit I mean I I guess I would say that I feel better about it

56
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:39,120
now than I did at the time of the acquisition which I felt pretty good

57
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:43,000
that's why I went along with it but now having been here for a bit I do feel

58
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:48,840
better about it. There's um having having worked independently for about a decade

59
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:54,400
the reach you get as being part of a larger company that has more resources

60
00:04:54,400 --> 00:05:01,880
is it says it's just at a whole other scale and I find myself having to really

61
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:06,800
combat like small thinking like how do we do things super hyper crazy by the

62
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:11,280
skin of our teeth cheap and how do we do something that a ten-person team does

63
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:14,080
with a four-person team like I have to break all of that way of thinking a

64
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:18,520
little bit because it limits what I can achieve and that's been a hard that's

65
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:24,360
been a hard shift but I think there's a bigger mindset that I developed as an

66
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:28,520
independent contractor or as a freelancer and I wonder if you suffer

67
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:34,800
from this too Mike and it's this it's this unbelievable amount of value that

68
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:38,200
you learn to attach to your time where now everything in life you're you're

69
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:42,040
you're measuring against how much time is that going to take how much time does

70
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:45,880
it take me to wash my car how much time does it take me to mow the lawn and that

71
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:48,760
becomes like this sick way of thinking about things because it sucks all the

72
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:52,960
joy out of life the audience doesn't know but you guys know I was just on a

73
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:57,600
brief four-day trip up north mostly business but I of course my family's

74
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:03,040
from there so I went to visit and we had a minor issue with a client project and

75
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:11,040
I just went into this I don't even know what to say like you stay yeah it was it

76
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:15,860
was it was more like when they Bruce Banner just freaks out and becomes the

77
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:21,360
Hulk and I was like sorry kid can't play sorry which is a board game I'm sure

78
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:25,320
most people are familiar with oh we all know sorry Mike yeah of course I have to

79
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:32,080
you know rewrite this doku instance because reasons right and I realized

80
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:37,400
something not only did it make no difference materially to TMB my my

81
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:43,680
company the client didn't even notice the problem right there was no material

82
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:48,040
difference between doing it on Saturday we're just letting it go until Monday

83
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:53,480
but I've gone into this and I this is why when you sent me this article I was

84
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:57,600
like damn and also I would love to after this jump back to the small thinking

85
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:03,680
thing yeah it's it freelancing should be the in the DSM it's a form of sickness

86
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:07,880
mm-hmm yeah there's actually been research that's what this article talks

87
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:10,880
about we'll have linked in the show notes that explains the psychology

88
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:15,200
behind this state of mind people who attach dollar signs to their time or

89
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:20,200
value time like money tend to be overwhelmingly less happy than those who

90
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:26,360
don't because they're non working hours suddenly seem less important quote-unquote

91
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:31,160
free time gets tainted with guilt because there's a cost associated with

92
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:40,000
it wow that's me that I am I have to I have to struggle to not have the

93
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,920
weekends be hell because I feel like I am wasting so much time around the house

94
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:49,440
if I'm not working and so much so that sometimes just to relieve my anxiety

95
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:54,080
I'll carve out a couple hours on Saturday to work even though I work all

96
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:58,760
day Sunday every week right six days a week on the exact opposite I work all

97
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:02,960
day Saturday but then I'm always looking to see can I hustle you know a few hours

98
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:07,320
like Sunday like after church or whatever and the thing is is that what

99
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:11,720
this article points out curious your thoughts on this West is we're seeing a

100
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:16,960
bigger shift in the economy where a lot of traditional salary jobs are going

101
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:21,920
more towards contract gigs and more and more people are becoming independent

102
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:28,080
contractors in a sense so it seems like this could become a larger issue yeah

103
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:31,120
you're right I mean contractors into playing a pretty big role at a lot of

104
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:34,880
organizations and there is sort of this thought that okay well if you can

105
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:38,480
convert money to time and with the salary you've already negotiated you're

106
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:41,760
kind of set until your next review period and you hope for a promotion and

107
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:46,200
and with freelance maybe you think yeah I could I could just work more but it's

108
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:49,280
already so difficult to actually carve out time for yourself and I think that

109
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:52,880
affects salaried people too right you might want to be pushing to finish a big

110
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:55,880
project and you might have the reverse problem I'm now guilting yourself about

111
00:08:55,880 --> 00:09:00,680
not actually taking any time off from work yeah yeah that's true salaried

112
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:04,800
folks are not necessarily immune from this because now I mean it's crossed my

113
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:07,520
mind once or twice but this is just how I work it's now it's like okay if I work

114
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:10,960
six or seven days a week well it's not what I get paid for I get paid for five

115
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:14,600
days a week but that's just the way my job works but you want it and you want

116
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:18,320
to think about holistic outcomes right because we're not just there to turn out

117
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:22,200
parts on a factory line yeah you're trying to make real things yeah yeah and

118
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:26,320
it's a it's a process for what we make and it just takes time so the question

119
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:30,800
is like what do you do if you get trapped in this mindset and I've managed

120
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:34,120
to pull this trick on myself a couple of times but their research shows it

121
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:38,000
actually is really something you can do and that is if we tell ourselves that

122
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,720
leisure time is another means to achieve the goal or financial outcomes we're

123
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:46,560
striving for that can make us more likely to take the breaks that we need

124
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:51,400
and maybe even enjoy them more and be happier in general so you can if you can

125
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:56,280
convince yourself that there is a sense in a sense a monetary value or a brain

126
00:09:56,280 --> 00:10:00,480
downtime value that makes you more productive ultimately if you can buy

127
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:04,360
into that which I believe is true then it makes a little bit easier to enjoy

128
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:08,160
your downtime it's a it's a process though it's like Mike was saying it's

129
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,480
something you always struggle with but you wanted to circle back to the small

130
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:15,400
versus big thinking Mike yes so I would love to learn more about how your

131
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:21,920
thinking has changed because I had some very long conversations when I was up in

132
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:26,520
New Jersey for my business regarding things we can do things our competitors

133
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:31,520
are doing and you know the reality of being super small and severely

134
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:38,200
financially constrained mm-hmm yeah so I think the biggest difference is in

135
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:42,240
hiring potential you know we're we're kicking around the show ideas like how

136
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:45,640
could we pull that off and then it takes like ten minutes of the conversation

137
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:49,600
before we go well I guess we could hire somebody to do that and like that's a

138
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:54,480
big mentality shift for us because having the resources to hire people at a

139
00:10:54,480 --> 00:11:00,320
decent income with benefits and all of that was just not even something that

140
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:03,720
was possible for us but I'll tell you this like that the scale is is pretty

141
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:07,800
different really because I think I've told you this before it I think they

142
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:13,960
spend more easily easily in beverages and and lunches then we probably had as

143
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:17,400
an entire budget for Jupiter broadcasting and that's just there you

144
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:23,720
know Linux Academy is the largest online cloud training platform and there's they

145
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:26,840
are an institution now they have like 120 something hundred and twenty five

146
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:30,080
people working here now and so they're just at a totally different scale and

147
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:35,080
it's meant the biggest problem that we've run into is how do we do things at

148
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:39,360
a larger scale that make a difference and that are worth doing how do we do

149
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:43,040
something that maybe attracts a million people instead of five hundred thousand

150
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:47,320
people those kinds of things in it it's it's a little outside of my reach right

151
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:53,240
now because it's not an area I spent so much time so long in the trenches

152
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:57,760
getting by with if I spend money on something that means it's an area I

153
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:02,720
don't spend money in in another place and it may even mean it could ruin us if

154
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:05,560
it doesn't go well like there's all these decisions that had to be made let

155
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:09,000
alone even being able to hire people that I spent so much time in that mindset

156
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:14,200
that I have to I have to constantly catch myself and what I've been doing is

157
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:20,360
been looking at setting really large goals that try to make us re

158
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:24,920
adjust the lens in which we're looking at the problem so we we readdress the

159
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:28,840
problem in a new way of thinking right has to become the default position think

160
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:32,320
right about it instead of focusing on the small day-to-day stuff yeah yeah

161
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:34,840
West knows my struggles pretty well because it's something we talk a lot

162
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:38,360
about in our in our meetings you know we have we have ketchup meetings and

163
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:41,200
department meetings and stuff and we're trying to we're just still trying to as

164
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:46,080
a group trying to hammer this stuff out it's a it's a there are advantages to

165
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:51,440
being lean and small especially in efficiency in direction changing you

166
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:54,680
know this isn't working let's move being able to go with your instinct those

167
00:12:54,680 --> 00:13:02,960
things are your strengths when you're small but customer support and internal

168
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:09,600
feature development and expansion and and growing and growing new shows just

169
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:13,640
are much more possible when you have a larger budget an example of that would

170
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:16,920
be the choose Linux show that we recently launched it just wasn't

171
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:22,240
possible before to have to have the time and the resources to pay an editor and

172
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:26,000
pay hosts and all that stuff it just we were maxed out without taking on

173
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,960
substantially more advertisers and so it took a different business model really I

174
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:35,480
think for us to change the game because the business we were in before was

175
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:40,440
advertising based podcasts of a niche market and now the business we're in is

176
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:45,320
a much larger online training business which just has a larger customer base

177
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:49,920
for one thing so I think part of it Mike is is mentality and part of it is just

178
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:53,480
the core business that we were in versus what we're in now our my job hasn't

179
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:59,520
changed much but the company I'm part of has interesting yeah yeah I'm sure

180
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:03,160
another piece of it is obviously capitalization right bigger company yeah

181
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:07,120
everything's just slightly larger or slightly yeah significantly larger do

182
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:11,480
you find that you're running up against limitations of the size of bad water

183
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:18,800
well I mean we had a little R&D project go south very recently so we run into

184
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:22,360
the problem of we have lots of interesting ideas on things we can do

185
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:29,240
and very little capital with which to do them right sure so we have to pick one

186
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:35,280
and if it doesn't work out that hobbles us for at least a quarter and that

187
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:39,360
doesn't even start to get into any potential like you know we do this for a

188
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:42,000
long time right I've had all kinds of crazy things like consulting client

189
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:47,560
files bankruptcy right you can't get paid like there's all all kind you know a

190
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:50,400
dispute client feels like something's not done but there's all kinds of things

191
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:55,360
that have happened over the years but the most painful one is actually when

192
00:14:55,360 --> 00:15:00,680
you know we sit down we look at like we do this every year we sit down we look

193
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:04,520
at the year ahead we always have this fantasy of going towards a more

194
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:11,640
productized business and we see you know let's say five opportunities we pick one

195
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:19,480
try to work it out for you know a month or two and we realize we just don't have

196
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:25,240
the other the financial strength or the you know in some cases marketing know-how

197
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:30,320
to actually do it which becomes pretty you know there can be other means right

198
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:36,360
we didn't sometimes when things require hardware that can be tough yeah we

199
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:40,880
definitely feel it I mean I tend to think of things in terms of like revenue

200
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:45,120
against investment or investment against revenue and our biggest problem is

201
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:49,760
really we should pick a couple of these and try them out but we always every

202
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:56,800
year we have to pick one or two some do some don't and that's pretty it's a

203
00:15:56,800 --> 00:16:00,200
pretty risky hand right it's like going to Atlantic City and just betting it all

204
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:08,640
on double zero and roulette yeah only if you don't win it's it's it's your job

205
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:13,200
plus everybody else working with you and repercussions are severe mm-hmm

206
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:17,760
probably tied into this too is how much identity especially in America we tend

207
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:20,960
to associate with our career so it's not even like that you just you know oh you

208
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:23,960
start a business and it didn't work out unless you had you just move on right

209
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:29,040
that was that was a lot of your life and thoughts and investments yeah yeah

210
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:34,200
really yeah I agree one way to always measure success is in number of laptops

211
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:42,360
and it seems that listener Emma that's what I'm calling her now because I'm

212
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:47,800
sure she listens she has some feedback for average system 76 customers not even

213
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:52,680
for Mike specifically Emma tweets out today Emma who is in charge of support

214
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:58,320
over at system 76 she's the happiness manager to put it technically and so

215
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:03,840
today is clean out your computer day hashtag keep your laptop fans of clear

216
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:09,320
of dust and debris and so system 76 asks what's your best computer cleaning tip

217
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:15,080
which Emma responds to the system 76 account to keep at Domenico away from

218
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:20,720
and make sure all beverages are in a separate room you're getting sick burned

219
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:27,120
by the system 76 staff in public now you realize that you know this is a this is

220
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:35,480
a gross gross misrepresentation I have never destroyed more than seven laptops

221
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:41,720
in the year yeah and a good portion of the more MacBooks to be fair you know

222
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:47,640
what and and honestly they wanted to go it was that's true that's true that's

223
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:50,960
true I mean there's part of the up it's part of the Mike's built-in

224
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:55,680
obsolescence obsolescence program right exactly Apple wishes I could destroy

225
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:58,800
more MacBooks for people just like kind of walk around oh there you go there you

226
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:02,400
go West Payne's kind of like the I'm somewhere in the middle right I don't I

227
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:04,800
don't go through his machines as fast as you do but I think I go through a

228
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:09,640
pretty high clip but West Payne you were rocking like one of the original

229
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:15,240
original XPS is for six or seven years or something yeah that's right is it

230
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:22,760
was it that long it did feel like 12 years yeah it's like that DS9 episode

231
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:26,880
with the O'Brien and he's in prison in his mind it was like that but with a

232
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:31,200
laptop I think it's just mostly like especially if I'm doing more development

233
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:36,000
stuff I I don't need very much you know like an electron app here or there a

234
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:40,560
chrome a chrome session and a terminal yeah now you know doing more doing more

235
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:46,320
stuff with with content creation it is nice to have a beefier Rick mm-hmm yeah

236
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:49,800
I think the one thing I the one somebody just tweeted me recently said hey do you

237
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:53,920
guys still like your Lenovo t480 oh yeah right and I said yes although I think at

238
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:57,960
this point I might be inclined to go high DPI however we do rely on a couple of

239
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:01,800
applications that don't have high DPI support so I don't know but that would

240
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:05,000
be the one thing I might change about the t480 as soon as I've got one of those

241
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,760
kernels and and maybe we do already but with the the recent changes so that

242
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:12,840
there's better high DPI support when you have to go log into an actual terminal

243
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:16,960
you know console on on your laptop when you have to fix something then I'll

244
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:21,680
switch yeah all right okay so and that'll probably be about another ten

245
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:30,860
machines or so yeah right I think so well Wes you found this great this great

246
00:19:30,860 --> 00:19:37,600
article on css tricks comm on what hooks mean for view and I wanted you to share

247
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:41,800
what you found with the class today yeah okay well maybe we can start with like a

248
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:46,720
little quiz Mike have you do you use view are you react where do you fall in

249
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:51,640
the single page application framework camp I was originally in angular but

250
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:56,240
when it was angular JS back in the day I have done some view I you know I don't

251
00:19:56,240 --> 00:20:00,440
have any current projects using any of these heavy frameworks the last one I

252
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:06,320
did use was view though but it was it was the least of major version back hmm

253
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:11,280
yeah okay well you know obviously in the in the JavaScript world everything has

254
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:14,880
to change at a lightning pace yeah and this is this is no different so you

255
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:19,240
might have seen some of the hubbub around hooks over in react so when I saw

256
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:22,720
this about view adding hooks as well I thought that was an interesting sort of

257
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:26,360
convergence of design and really I mean they talked about that right here in the

258
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:30,560
article that it is sort of you know what you what you end up with is a crossover

259
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:35,560
between react and view they use a lot of the same language the API is similar the

260
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:38,240
benefits are slightly different and that's where it gets interesting so the

261
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:43,640
idea of hooks it's a more functional way to do react and at its core I think

262
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:47,480
react is a pretty functional idea it's really like you've got a render function

263
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:51,320
and so you've got some state some data and then you've built this component

264
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:54,800
that takes that data and then produces produces your view that gets rendered

265
00:20:54,800 --> 00:21:00,080
onto the page whatever that structure of divs and forms whatever you're building

266
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:06,280
right now the most common JavaScript API for all those react internals is pretty

267
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:09,760
at least somewhat object oriented there's a lot of classes involved you

268
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:13,040
might have higher-order components where you're passing state through or nesting

269
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:17,440
it or like a factory or something and it's just always felt at least to me

270
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:22,120
sort of like an impedance mismatch now not everyone thinks that and there's you

271
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:27,040
know so many users of that API but recently they added hooks and the basic

272
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:31,160
idea is just do this all with functions so you've got your you know you've got

273
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:34,680
your component and you have a hook and you basically say like I need a little

274
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:38,560
piece of state give me some state and that's it you call the function you get

275
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:42,200
your state and you can do this multiple times and then the react engine knows

276
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:46,240
that once that state changes it needs to rerender whatever component you've just

277
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:49,320
made that's how it gets to do all the fancy virtual dom diffing and all the

278
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:54,080
performance benefits it also means like one of the general

279
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:57,560
trends I think we've seen is trying to have more composition because we end up

280
00:21:57,560 --> 00:22:00,920
with these really complicated components with multiple levels that that you want

281
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:03,360
to try to share as much stuff between so you don't have to keep reinventing it

282
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:06,320
but you want to do that in the same way where you're not constantly passing

283
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:10,160
state all around and have like ten arguments to your functions right that's

284
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:15,080
just not really tenable to do so so hooks are one way to do that now view

285
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:19,360
view doesn't really have that problem because it didn't have the same sort of

286
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:23,680
object-oriented API and they even already had stateless functional

287
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:29,520
components if you wanted them but they also used this idea of mixins and maybe

288
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:32,080
Mike can can tell us a little bit more about mixins if we want to get into that

289
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:36,120
and it just they just don't compose well so I thought what was neat is it is the

290
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:39,200
view camp had some of the same ideas probably were influenced by some of the

291
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:43,160
thoughts that the react camp had in terms of like this is just a nice way to

292
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:48,240
handle state in a way where you can compose and and combine elements and

293
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:52,720
components together with minimal fluff minimal just arbitrary nesting that you

294
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:56,320
kind of have to do and in a way that scales better and it's cleaner and then

295
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:58,680
mixins

296
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:07,720
well okay so I definitely see their case for it yeah so it's pretty new you can

297
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:12,200
go try it if you want we will have links and in the in the docks of course it's

298
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:16,280
just something to play with I do a lot of the Clojure script stuff and we've

299
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:19,200
kind of already had this style of approach we do we pray for just like

300
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:22,680
have some functions you have a little state past you it's passed into your

301
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:26,320
function somehow you track when that state changes yeah and you rerender the

302
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:29,400
thing now I don't know it's kind of controversial if if the Clojure script

303
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:33,040
communities kind of redo things and sort of like rebase on top of the hooks

304
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:37,240
mechanisms or keep the way that they've already done it now time will tell but

305
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:40,960
I think it's nice to see this this sort of trend of ideas something that I find

306
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:45,160
at least personally more pleasing to develop with find its way to the larger

307
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:53,240
JavaScript community okay so in the case of someone using a mixin in view the

308
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:57,680
hooks I see I'm completely unfamiliar with few hooks and so this is post

309
00:23:57,680 --> 00:24:02,900
dating me right this is newer what what is the advantage of a hook over a

310
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:06,400
mixin other than mixins being kind of like sloppy right I get why they're not

311
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:14,320
great yeah so yeah oh cool no is it I'm just trying to conceptually is it if I'm

312
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:18,520
not using Clojure script right is it the key I just JavaScript just yeah

313
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:24,480
ECMA script JavaScript whatever will it like I personally don't like mixins

314
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:29,200
because I think they're frankly cause more problems than they solve assuming

315
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:32,840
you have a large enough scale of code right you have big enough code base yes

316
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:35,980
exactly right they're kind of like weird magic and they don't always make it

317
00:24:35,980 --> 00:24:39,480
explicit where logic is coming right you don't know what the hell is happening

318
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:42,560
basically yeah so that's actually one of the main things that they talk about

319
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:46,840
here is that that you know folks really do do a lot of what what mixins do but

320
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:49,440
they make it explicit where logic is coming from so you have a little bit

321
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:51,760
more documentation and when you have to dive into a big code base that you

322
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:54,360
haven't touched for six months should be a little bit plainer about what's

323
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:58,840
actually happening how the data is flowing okay so on a like talk to me

324
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:02,880
like I'm five level the reason I might use hooks is because they are

325
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:08,480
effectively more maintainable or they solve the same problems as mixins but

326
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:12,400
are far more maintainable yeah more maintainable simpler and more

327
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:18,600
composable mmm very cool limitation on if I'm using TypeScript JavaScript

328
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:25,280
Clojure scripts Clojure script has one library now I think it's called the H X

329
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:29,640
that's that's using hooks otherwise reagent the main one already has a

330
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:32,220
somewhat somewhat similar thing where you basically just define a function

331
00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:36,280
that returns a data structure and that defines your component view hooks are

332
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:41,840
available already with you with the view 2.x but they're still experimental so if

333
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:44,960
you're gonna play with them just just be aware of that I assume that the API

334
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:48,600
works regardless of TypeScript or just regular JavaScript no I might be crazy

335
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:51,440
because I like I said I mostly use angular now in fact I've been playing

336
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:57,400
with ionic 4 which is just a addition to angular but doesn't react have

337
00:25:57,400 --> 00:26:04,040
something like this already yeah yeah so react head hooks first okay yeah and

338
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:07,320
they they've been in development for a while and then they kind of just

339
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:13,520
recently became generally available and people started really using them by the

340
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:18,580
time this show ends up on iTunes there'll be a new version yeah be

341
00:26:18,580 --> 00:26:24,280
relevant anymore so you guys can just skip this chapter yeah nice good find

342
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:27,960
Wes I love it I appreciate the breakdown definitely

343
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:32,800
definitely out out of my paygrade but fascinating to learn about looks like

344
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:36,600
there's gonna be a whole bunch of federal funding for AI projects Mike so

345
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:41,840
you should use that use that small size of the mad bot or to a pivot into AI as

346
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:46,600
quick as possible yeah yeah I guess there's gonna be an executive order sign

347
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:51,800
that prioritizes federal funding for AI and will create resources for AI

348
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:58,280
research establish standards and more it seems like that could be that could be a

349
00:26:58,280 --> 00:27:03,960
pretty big deal to legitimize the field of AI development I might be wrong that

350
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:08,600
seems like a big news story yeah this is this is a literally breaking news for me

351
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:13,200
so I have to take a look at it yeah yeah it developed while we were after we were

352
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:16,600
actually already connected in recording I just saw it go by on the feeds it's

353
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:23,200
been to me as just the way things happen not necessarily like enshrining it in

354
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:28,320
invalid validity but more like it's it's one more peg on the system as like oh

355
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:31,960
right I like the hipster tech companies started using it and you saw some real

356
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:36,240
results but then like okay finally like the slower moving cycles of government

357
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:39,920
money are coming out to actually fund this right which will build out the

358
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:43,880
industry I mean that kind of you can you can get a loss you can get a nice

359
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:48,120
healthy business that lives off of federal contracts and funding and it all

360
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:52,700
it may also lead to AI being used more in scientific research which could have

361
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:56,680
other kinds of benefits it could be a really big deal and I think that the

362
00:27:56,680 --> 00:28:00,920
overall effect adds not legitimacy isn't the right word because it's not that

363
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:07,520
it's not a legitimate field right now but it feels like it sort of enshrines

364
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:13,240
it in like it's now a it's now a codified tier of the tech industry in

365
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:18,360
the States and yeah you're right like the stodgy the stodgy folks over there

366
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:21,280
in the government there yeah they're hip to it now too they're funding it's not

367
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:24,920
cool right and that will create a lot of business around it that'll create a lot

368
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:29,600
of money for development and resources around it which will build out that

369
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:33,400
industry base it'll draw more people into the field and it's all part of a

370
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:39,440
cycle if it's successful obviously but you know just anecdotally there is a lot

371
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:43,760
of requests for machine learning courses at Linux Academy coming in from students

372
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:47,640
it seems to be a field that people generally the trend seems to be if

373
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:52,280
people are beginning to look at that job field more then they start requesting

374
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:55,200
that training so there's sort of a correlation between people looking for

375
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:58,760
jobs in an industry and the amount of requests that Linux Academy gets for

376
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:03,320
that kind of training and machine learnings way up on the list and that

377
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:06,920
would mean that either there's at least a perception of and possibly really an

378
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:10,880
increase in people you know companies hiring for those roles or people

379
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:14,600
interested or thinking that companies will want more of those staff we should

380
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:17,240
come up with a way to use machine learning wouldn't that be cool like

381
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:21,440
something to analyze our podcasts like and analyze something about the podcasts

382
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:24,840
I don't know something oh yeah all right let's go with something so they

383
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:29,160
absolutely yeah I think so we'll just try to train a model that generates

384
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:32,280
podcasts when we really don't want to go that's what that's what I was thinking

385
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:37,200
of actually kind of along those lines today Nvidia announced that they are

386
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:43,760
open-sourcing their face rendering technology called style Gan or it's

387
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:49,760
style GAN and it creates these super realistic faces I mean I'll put a link

388
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:53,560
I'll drop a link in the chat room so you guys can see it it's there it's really

389
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:56,920
something like you would look at the pictures of these faces and you would

390
00:29:56,920 --> 00:30:00,440
think that they are real human being faces it's it's beyond the candy

391
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:04,440
of them are like a little bit weird but most of them are just yeah you know

392
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:07,280
especially and it probably helps that there's enough diversity in the human

393
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:10,480
faces you know there's just a lot of true at least at least for how attuned

394
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:14,240
we are to looking at faces there's a lot of range yeah I mean in here they're

395
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:20,920
even putting babies faces there is like this this this Asian gals face here has

396
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:25,240
like like oily like like you know she's got like her super moisturized skin

397
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:29,800
coming back from the from the gym yeah it's just amazing and they're

398
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:35,960
open-sourcing it today hyper realistic face generator so it's coming it's

399
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:38,960
coming they part of what they're what part of what it really is that they're

400
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:41,800
open-sourcing is the data set because obviously that's what you need for

401
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:45,240
something like this right looks like a year the repo here seems that it's

402
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:49,840
Creative Commons licensed ah thank you thank you yeah it's something like

403
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:56,240
70,000 cropped and lined up headshots that it uses as source material to

404
00:30:56,240 --> 00:31:00,280
generate the faces and that's part of what they're open-sourcing is that

405
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:04,520
70,000 high-quality PNG images Wow yeah that is that's a huge thing you don't

406
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:07,160
always see that you know it's like oh yeah we got this cool algorithm but

407
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:11,420
here's the data collecting all of your data to actually make a model and you

408
00:31:11,420 --> 00:31:17,400
know it's not it's not a trivial thing to get 70,000 headshots that are

409
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:22,640
essentially all lined up the same way cropped the same way I mean it can be

410
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:26,800
automated to a point but somebody had to go take those pictures yeah take those

411
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:29,680
pictures filter through clean the day you said make sure that all of them are

412
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:33,200
actually worthy of inclusion and won't mess things up yeah and that you're like

413
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:36,680
allowed you know what are these sourced from there's probably that question too

414
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:41,800
yeah yeah you you assume Nvidia has that part taken care of right and then here

415
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:46,280
they also say this part of it they're releasing pre-trained models which are

416
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:51,840
stored as PKL files which are pronounced pickle yeah and they're just up on

417
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:55,760
Google Drive so you can go grab a pickle file off of Google Drive fresh hot

418
00:31:55,760 --> 00:32:01,080
pickle up on Google Drive and generate your own fake face and use that as your

419
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:05,280
own your you know this would be a great way to be anonymous online but make it

420
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:09,520
look like you're a real person and then you combine this with deep fakes and you

421
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:15,680
can have a YouTube channel all the endless possibilities and you'd script

422
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:21,640
it all with Python and there is some Python results that we could talk about

423
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:26,960
today there is an annual Python developer survey that's officially

424
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:29,920
annual now because this is the second one they've ever done the Python

425
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:34,200
Software Foundation got together with jet brains and conducted an official

426
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:38,760
annual Python developers survey you guys want to hear about some of the things

427
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:43,080
they found interested at all and in the world of Python and just for some weeks

428
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:46,880
22 because there's there's some like some background is I mean pythons kind

429
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:51,080
of old right it came out in the 90s and it's had multiple faces it's been used

430
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:55,800
as a teaching language it has you know semi-prominent web development

431
00:32:55,800 --> 00:33:00,760
framework and then now it's having something of a resurgence before AI yeah

432
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:06,120
yeah exactly which is which is exactly why it ended up in this part of the show

433
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:11,920
so 84% of Python users in the survey use Python as their main language by the way

434
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:17,000
also I did a little looking at their data set and their data set seems fairly

435
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:20,760
legit they have all of their source material posted up in the show which we

436
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:26,680
will link in the show notes the average respondents were 20 somethings about 39%

437
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:35,520
of them were 20 somethings 31% though so almost a third 30 to 39 and then 12% 40

438
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:40,400
to 49 with only 7% being 18 to 20 but so that's the age range and then

439
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:46,640
experience in the IT field 25% of them had 11 plus years in the IT field so

440
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:49,200
that's a little bit of the and it's all over the world that they surveyed

441
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:54,720
although most of the respondents are in India and the US 21% in the United

442
00:33:54,720 --> 00:34:00,280
States and 16% in India with the United Kingdom coming in at 6% in Germany at 5%

443
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:06,400
China 4% France for Russia 3 Canada 3 alright so that's that's our that's our

444
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:11,720
base that we're getting our answers from an 84% of those people use Python as

445
00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:18,080
their main language half of them that were surveyed also use JavaScript the

446
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:22,920
2018 stats were pretty similar to the 2017 results in this regard with one

447
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:27,560
significant difference in here being that there's a pretty noticeable jump

448
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:36,200
in bash and shell usage it's grown from 36% in 2017 to 45% in 2018 so Python

449
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:39,320
developers are using more bash what do you make of that mr. West what do you

450
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:44,720
think that is I wonder if that's just sort of the general trend in in

451
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:47,720
developers doing more operations work are they just having more access to

452
00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:52,280
bash terminals they have to kind of muck around more right systems yeah I wonder

453
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:55,360
if it's that and then Mike do you think I'd be crazy to suggest that it's also

454
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:58,880
more of them are using Linux in general that's exactly what I was gonna say I

455
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:03,480
think the correlation between Python developers and Linux usage particularly

456
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:06,920
now that we're in this are we still in a Mac Exodus by the way can we still say

457
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:11,760
that or is that I don't know I think it's stabilized a little bit with the

458
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:16,240
Mac Mini and the iMac Pro I feel like it's sort of stabilized out a little

459
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:21,240
bit and Windows still isn't that great yeah yeah although Windows even with

460
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:24,600
all the great Linux options it has it's just more like the core OS hasn't really

461
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:27,920
gotten I think it's like they're all just there but they've all gotten a

462
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:34,840
little more competitive over the last 12 months even the Linux side so but yeah I

463
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:38,040
think they I think they still lost quite a bit I think it's still I've always

464
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:42,920
felt like the max exodus was going to be something that was just ongoing as

465
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:49,200
people got sort of bored of the sandbox of macOS or the limited laptop choices

466
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:53,160
or desktop choices that they might want to just look at an open source desktop

467
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:57,600
stack all together I've always kind of felt that but we'll see we'll see if

468
00:35:57,600 --> 00:36:00,560
that continues to bear out it's Apple's game to lose really going on to your

469
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:07,120
point West 58% of respondents are using Python to do data analysis that's pretty

470
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:11,240
significant I wonder what data analysis counts as because that's kind of a

471
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:14,440
broad question right because you don't have to be a data scientist to do data

472
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:18,000
analysis it might just be like munging through a whole bunch of XML or JSON to

473
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:21,800
process in in some pipeline that you're using I bet just that's a lot of it I

474
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:25,840
bet you that's that is I bet you that is a lot of it 52% are using it for web

475
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:32,960
development 43% DevOps and pretty strong 38% are using it for machine

476
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:39,960
learning that's about a 7% jump not not a substantial but a 7% jump from 2017 I

477
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:43,320
think that's worth worth noting in its own I think it's worth noting that data

478
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:47,580
analysis has now become more popular than web development I think that's also

479
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:51,680
interesting and worth noting and it just shows you where pythons at right now and

480
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:55,320
it's not none of its bad or good it's just where it's at and it's someone it

481
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:57,880
speaks I think to some of the particular things that pythons done well which is

482
00:36:57,880 --> 00:37:04,760
mostly accumulated a lot of accelerated libraries implemented in C or assembler

483
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:08,640
or Fortran and then linked against the main Python implementation that make it

484
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:13,480
good for that and so well Ruby or node or whatever else of the days can come up

485
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:17,320
and easily start being like look at this hot new web framework it's harder to be

486
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:23,320
like look at these neat highly optimized linear algebra implementations but there

487
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:27,480
is a bit of a story here isn't there about how Python has sort of kept up

488
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:32,400
with staying relevant and has managed to grow its user base and managed to find

489
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:38,160
newer and newer use cases and still grow out its ones that it has a stronghold in

490
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:42,520
that's okay so we we have to talk about then in this survey which is crazy and

491
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:45,400
it might it probably just speaks right we have to be aware of whatever

492
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:49,920
selection involved for the people who actually took the survey right 84% use in

493
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:55,440
Python 3 yeah that's crazy yeah that's a pretty big jump

494
00:37:55,440 --> 00:38:00,480
or am I just old and no too many people who are stuck on Python 2 Python for

495
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:05,280
some time yeah it has but I still come across stuff on Python 2 all the time

496
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:09,560
and I think for a long time we were it was you know it was the joke it was like

497
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:13,200
how not to do a language transition because everyone was like well we

498
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:16,040
already built this giant code base in two and we don't trust the two to three

499
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:20,080
converter so like we don't need three and it took a while before like Django

500
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:23,080
fully worked with three or you know a lot of the big libraries but it seems

501
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:27,960
like now you know several or many of the larger tech companies that are based on

502
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:31,680
it have changed to Python 3 it's the default I think a lot of people are

503
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:35,760
using distros have switched so it's kind of a new Python 3 era so I think that's

504
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:42,880
kind of it because 38% of respondents get Python from the distribution repo or

505
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:47,160
homebrew or whatever like the OS provided installation method is 38% are

506
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:51,120
doing that and so it doesn't get updated until those get updated and if you're on

507
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:57,120
a maybe a rel from a you know release or two ago maybe that that could lead to

508
00:38:57,120 --> 00:39:01,200
that leg a little bit in and getting people to switch over that could be part

509
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:05,160
of it and I think that's probably pretty astute there mr. pain you got also

510
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:09,200
figure there's cloud providers that play a role in this and if those cloud

511
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:13,620
providers are pushing the version forward on a reliable cadence then that

512
00:39:13,620 --> 00:39:18,720
is also making developers push forward 55% of Python users who use cloud

513
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:25,200
platforms prefer AWS Google platform comes in second followed by heroku then

514
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:29,600
digital ocean and then Azure which I thought was interesting and then about a

515
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:33,640
third of the respondents said no cloud solutions for me I run it all on

516
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:42,880
premises and as you guessed Mike 69% of respondents are using Linux as their

517
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:49,000
primary development OS yeah 69% huge that's huge doesn't mean it's their only

518
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:54,520
OS but it means it's the OS they spend their time in developing Python Windows

519
00:39:54,520 --> 00:40:06,320
came in 47% Mac OS 32% and BSD at 1% but hey it made it it hit 1% right it got

520
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:09,880
invited to the debate and that's what counts that's true it did show up on the

521
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:13,740
map I guess no surprise here pie charm is the most popular tool for Python

522
00:40:13,740 --> 00:40:20,060
development with 35% share however a little disruption here a new

523
00:40:20,060 --> 00:40:30,280
contender VS code has gone from 7% in 2017 to 16% in 2018 becoming the second

524
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:35,760
most popular editor for Python development VS code it's not surprised

525
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:38,800
sandwiched right in between the pie charm professional edition which is the

526
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:41,800
most popular and then the pie charm community edition yeah third most

527
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:46,400
popular and then boom VS code right there how about that it's more popular

528
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:50,240
than the pie charm community edition and then I mean you know we don't we talk

529
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:54,360
about it for a lot of other reasons but hey it's it's open source well not not I

530
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:57,920
don't know about technically the version that you download that's compiled for

531
00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:03,120
you but in theory it's open source hmm I have nothing bad to say about VS code

532
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:07,200
really I think Microsoft nailed it so it doesn't really surprise me to see it's

533
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:12,960
growing and I I've been using a good name yeah yeah given LibreOffice a good

534
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:15,920
name actually the other day I loaded up LibreOffice writer for the first time

535
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:18,800
and you know a decade or whatever it's been and I'm like this is so

536
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:23,400
lightweight and quick it's using so little RAM my whole perspective on

537
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:29,360
LibreOffice writer has changed because of all the electron apps I use now so

538
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:32,600
there you have it things change okay just a couple more around us all out

539
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:37,440
then we're done here more than half of Python users are employed full-time 19

540
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:42,280
percent are students and 13% are self-employed or freelancing it's a

541
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:51,120
small group now Mike 13% the few the proud yep yeah so that's pretty much it

542
00:41:51,120 --> 00:41:53,960
then we had the ages in here there's several I don't anything else jump out

543
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:57,840
at you about this survey Wes I get people a lot of people working as a

544
00:41:57,840 --> 00:42:02,320
team a lot of people working independently that worked that jumped

545
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:07,200
out of me 48% work on a team and 48% work on their own with 4% work as an

546
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:13,200
external contractor or trainer 4% oh you know I also noticed that a lot of 25%

547
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:18,200
had 11 plus years in IT and that kind of makes sense I don't know a lot of the

548
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:22,560
people I know who are decent at Python who might not be quote-unquote Python

549
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:25,720
developers but use it anyway are people that just learned it as a scripting

550
00:42:25,720 --> 00:42:31,600
language coming up in the 2000s mm-hmm yeah yeah I guess that kid that could

551
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:35,880
make it stick to that's why that's why Apple's always tried to get folks when

552
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:40,040
they're in a in a very impressionable stage with IT and computers to use max

553
00:42:40,040 --> 00:42:44,400
now Google's doing oh yeah segment I also want one other thing before we go

554
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:50,080
is flask is doing great which is a more lightweight web play as Django's the big

555
00:42:50,080 --> 00:42:53,760
one that's like rails but flask is is a nice little guy so it's nice to see you

556
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:57,840
doing well yeah that is cool you know I want to say to that I've noticed that

557
00:42:57,840 --> 00:43:03,240
Python and the Python community at large do a really good job of reaching out to

558
00:43:03,240 --> 00:43:07,920
kids in a way that I don't see a lot of other communities doing and so I think

559
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:11,820
that's pretty great too so I think a tip a hat as a parent I just got to say tip

560
00:43:11,820 --> 00:43:16,680
of the hat to them for doing that I think that's really cool now Mike

561
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:21,680
wanted to get together here on on the Koda radio program and use the brain

562
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:31,360
trust of all of us to imagine near a future perhaps a far distant future

563
00:43:31,360 --> 00:43:38,360
where the iOS App Store has been opened up for all or maybe even maybe even an

564
00:43:38,360 --> 00:43:42,560
alternate reality just for the sake of conversation let's say that when the

565
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:47,280
Large Hadron Collider went online the universe split Donald Trump became

566
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:54,660
president and Apple opened up the App Store to everyone so we have two

567
00:43:54,660 --> 00:44:00,600
parallel universes now yeah yeah so it's less opening to everyone and more even

568
00:44:00,600 --> 00:44:06,040
if you kept the app review policies everyone gets the same financial deal

569
00:44:06,040 --> 00:44:10,560
okay all right I can work with those rules yeah let's let's even stick with

570
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:13,680
the financial stuff first there's also it's the same it's like the same share

571
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:17,720
same cut and also like it's the same kind of crap then get you rejected but

572
00:44:17,720 --> 00:44:23,240
it's just the standard is applied from like Joe's Joe's text app to Netflix

573
00:44:23,240 --> 00:44:30,280
app yeah exactly so so the thing that really kind of triggered me on this of

574
00:44:30,280 --> 00:44:34,560
course was the Facebook Google shenanigans from last week but the

575
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:38,680
response of particularly like ATP and some of the other more Apple focus

576
00:44:38,680 --> 00:44:43,240
podcasts kind of being like well of course there are different deals for the

577
00:44:43,240 --> 00:44:47,960
big boys versus the little guys which is like sure right like for a long time it

578
00:44:47,960 --> 00:44:52,720
has been widely reported that Netflix hasn't has never paid 30% to Apple right

579
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:57,360
they've always get a sweetheart deal right and Microsoft doesn't either and

580
00:44:57,360 --> 00:45:01,680
you know Facebook's app theoretically can be rejected but let's be honest

581
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:06,680
that's that doesn't really happen right well and I think that's why they're like

582
00:45:06,680 --> 00:45:11,080
of course they're special deals applications like Instagram Facebook

583
00:45:11,080 --> 00:45:17,720
Netflix Amazon Prime maybe they are they are value adds to the platform and

584
00:45:17,720 --> 00:45:23,320
without those you don't have as strong of a platform as a Android

585
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:28,760
I would argue that Android has so many other deficiencies which send your hate

586
00:45:28,760 --> 00:45:34,800
mail to Alan broadcasting calm that one I don't I don't think let's just take

587
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:38,460
the case of Facebook because Facebook and Instagram are the same company now

588
00:45:38,460 --> 00:45:47,080
right if Apple told Facebook so-and-so feature violates our guidelines in the

589
00:45:47,080 --> 00:45:51,720
Facebook app which Facebook really dump iOS those are the most valuable mobile

590
00:45:51,720 --> 00:45:55,480
users in the world I would imagine they'd probably double down on their web

591
00:45:55,480 --> 00:46:01,960
app well they're still a mobile Safari then right and they're gonna be pretty

592
00:46:01,960 --> 00:46:05,760
plus you just can't spy very well with a web app so how's that gonna work right

593
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:10,280
well that's exactly what I'm getting at right like it it's weird I found myself

594
00:46:10,280 --> 00:46:15,200
in a strange position because I I have in the past been very understanding if

595
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:19,920
not slightly annoyed at Apple's kind of draconian app review policies but the

596
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:28,720
financial stuff in particular you know Netflix getting a 15% I know it's not

597
00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:33,560
called the App Store feed right the App Store cut I get why because they make

598
00:46:33,560 --> 00:46:39,280
billions of dollars but don't you think that's going to put the next Netflix

599
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:44,180
right the you know West clip West flicks whatever at a fundamental

600
00:46:44,180 --> 00:46:50,240
disadvantage because they're cut to the platform vendor who I mean I gotta be

601
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:54,800
honest I'm not even like I have lots of issues with this whole walled garden

602
00:46:54,800 --> 00:47:00,640
thing now but they're they're cut is double when when you're smaller you're

603
00:47:00,640 --> 00:47:05,920
not operating at very much efficiency at all compared to your larger competitor

604
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:14,160
so it feels to me the state we have now in trenches the larger more established

605
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:19,360
companies and actually Apple giving them better deals well there may be

606
00:47:19,360 --> 00:47:24,360
legitimate reasons for it is a backdoor way for them to also stifle their their

607
00:47:24,360 --> 00:47:27,720
potential competition right it's like this is kind of the same argument that

608
00:47:27,720 --> 00:47:31,800
people were making for net neutrality in some ways that the big the big companies

609
00:47:31,800 --> 00:47:35,400
have more leverage and little ones won't be able to start also just real quick

610
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:39,780
FYI West flicks is just great finish great British bake-off and Star Trek on

611
00:47:39,780 --> 00:47:48,280
a continuous loop well I mean it you know we had that New York Times report

612
00:47:48,280 --> 00:47:52,240
where Facebook Facebook employee basically said yeah our entire business

613
00:47:52,240 --> 00:47:56,240
strategy is if we see us we track what you're doing on your phone if we see a

614
00:47:56,240 --> 00:47:59,240
startup that's potentially going to compete with us we either buy them or

615
00:47:59,240 --> 00:48:04,480
clone them right it's all a snap what they did to snapchat right they

616
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:07,720
implemented a bunch of their features and Instagram right yeah you I mean you

617
00:48:07,720 --> 00:48:10,960
have to you right is that whatever quote-unquote dominant market position

618
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:16,360
right there they're doing it in a pretty I would argue pretty shady on it yeah

619
00:48:16,360 --> 00:48:23,240
okay it's in your face kind of way too right and they because they're big they

620
00:48:23,240 --> 00:48:27,640
somehow have this leverage with the platform vendor what if we went into to

621
00:48:27,640 --> 00:48:33,320
Chris's alternate universe and Apple just said you know what we are the best

622
00:48:33,320 --> 00:48:37,520
platform for making money on mobile in at least North America and Europe right

623
00:48:37,520 --> 00:48:42,040
I can't speak to other places so here's the deal everybody gets the same deal

624
00:48:42,040 --> 00:48:46,400
this is it this is the human interface guideline this is the app review rules

625
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:51,280
and it's 30% then after the first year is 15% if you're doing a subscription

626
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:57,420
which is the current policy no side deals no accommodations that's what it

627
00:48:57,420 --> 00:49:05,080
is do you really believe that Netflix would drop their iPad app now Netflix I

628
00:49:05,080 --> 00:49:08,840
would argue is in the best position to do a PWA because they're not that

629
00:49:08,840 --> 00:49:13,520
interested in spying on you but like I would eat my hat if Facebook or

630
00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:19,440
Instagram did right Google certainly wouldn't abandon the platform Microsoft

631
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:27,000
is so busy abandoning Windows right now that I doubt they'd abandon iOS or am I

632
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:30,800
insane I mean is this just like Mike going off the rails well it's a I think

633
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:36,640
it's a per case situation here so take Amazon here's a great case study when

634
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:43,040
they bought Comixology and when they bought audible they removed the ability

635
00:49:43,040 --> 00:49:47,600
to buy books or comics within the app because of Apple's cut and said if you

636
00:49:47,600 --> 00:49:50,200
want to buy in fact they weren't even very clear about it because Apple's

637
00:49:50,200 --> 00:49:53,560
policies won't let you but you have to just suss out if you want to purchase

638
00:49:53,560 --> 00:49:58,000
something you have to launch your web browser and go to their website and buy

639
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:02,640
it and so this has happened and been like this now for years years now so

640
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:07,600
there is some precedent for a large tech company to say hey we can make do

641
00:50:07,600 --> 00:50:12,880
without you we're big enough we don't need you so I there it could happen so

642
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:16,320
this is the exact point so you actually set up the point perfectly now let's

643
00:50:16,320 --> 00:50:22,840
say let's say Facebook created a competitor to Comixology and for

644
00:50:22,840 --> 00:50:27,680
whatever weird reason Apple made a side deal with Facebook right uncle Tim and

645
00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:32,680
a marquee boy got together and made a deal that Facebook's comic app would

646
00:50:32,680 --> 00:50:38,600
only pay 10% and that comic app would have the convenience of selling through

647
00:50:38,600 --> 00:50:42,720
the App Store through an app purchase their their you know issues and

648
00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:49,040
subscriptions where Amazon's Comixology couldn't Amazon that is Apple putting

649
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:52,880
their finger on the scale right there at a material disadvantage and we haven't

650
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:56,240
even gotten into the fact that there's an editorial function of the App Store

651
00:50:56,240 --> 00:51:03,840
and they could feature whoever they want true let me ask you this it seems like

652
00:51:03,840 --> 00:51:09,320
it's it what we're really running up against is pressures on a model that

653
00:51:09,320 --> 00:51:12,960
needs to be changed like the App Store has been around for eight or nine years

654
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:17,120
now and this has essentially been the model with the slight adjustment to

655
00:51:17,120 --> 00:51:21,080
subscriptions recently but recently is like in the last two years like that's

656
00:51:21,080 --> 00:51:25,640
what's recent I think what has to be looked at is the value the App Store

657
00:51:25,640 --> 00:51:30,880
provides to the developer if they're hosting a bunch of game asset files and

658
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:35,160
they're streaming that using the Akamai CDN all around the world to people's

659
00:51:35,160 --> 00:51:40,280
devices as levels load that's a that's a that's a 30% value definitely yeah

660
00:51:40,280 --> 00:51:43,400
because you're hosting my files you're you're making all the back-end

661
00:51:43,400 --> 00:51:47,920
infrastructure that's that's valuable however if I'm a streaming application

662
00:51:47,920 --> 00:51:53,120
that is simply just loading a video player and then streaming the contents

663
00:51:53,120 --> 00:51:56,000
from my server and I'm paying for the bandwidth and I'm paying for the video

664
00:51:56,000 --> 00:52:01,720
hosting and I'm bringing the bulk of the value to the relationship then I think

665
00:52:01,720 --> 00:52:06,680
it's inappropriate to ask for 30% of the revenue there needs to be a re-analysis

666
00:52:06,680 --> 00:52:11,720
of the value that Apple brings versus the value that the app provider brings

667
00:52:11,720 --> 00:52:14,800
sure and if Apple's hosting the majority of the infrastructure then they price it

668
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:17,240
that way if it's a streaming app and perhaps they could just make a broad

669
00:52:17,240 --> 00:52:22,440
category streaming applications we only take a 10% cut I agree with that but

670
00:52:22,440 --> 00:52:25,680
that's that's not exactly the argument here right because you have to compare

671
00:52:25,680 --> 00:52:29,800
Apple to Apple's so pun intended right again I'm just saying I think that's the

672
00:52:29,800 --> 00:52:33,880
way you fix this because you're right it does stifle it does stifle the little

673
00:52:33,880 --> 00:52:37,800
the the smaller app developer but as a as a private business or I mean as a

674
00:52:37,800 --> 00:52:41,080
business as a as a as a company that's supposed to make money Apple has every

675
00:52:41,080 --> 00:52:44,600
right to do that but let's just say there was like JB book which was a

676
00:52:44,600 --> 00:52:49,920
fledgling competitor to Facebook and you did the exact same thing that Facebook

677
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:55,480
did in this latest hubbub your dev account would have simply been deleted

678
00:52:55,480 --> 00:52:59,480
we're talking about we're talking about last week's enterprise developer right

679
00:52:59,480 --> 00:53:04,640
you would have no dev account your apps would have been pulled done you know and

680
00:53:04,640 --> 00:53:11,840
put out of business I think I agree with that mm-hmm so that is Apple picking a

681
00:53:11,840 --> 00:53:17,480
winner right that that's I mean I know I'm gonna sound very like because I do

682
00:53:17,480 --> 00:53:20,920
believe that these app stores actually are in some I'm not a lawyer but in some

683
00:53:20,920 --> 00:53:29,040
way they need to be regulated with an antitrust eye because basically while I

684
00:53:29,040 --> 00:53:34,760
know Tim Cook personally doesn't like Zuckerberg if he did and him let's just

685
00:53:34,760 --> 00:53:40,280
say you know for whatever reason he decided that Facebook was the one true

686
00:53:40,280 --> 00:53:44,480
social network Apple could simply not allow any other social networks on their

687
00:53:44,480 --> 00:53:50,520
platform they have that power they have the power to as they just did last week

688
00:53:50,520 --> 00:53:55,760
allow one developer to violate and yes they did some PR slap on the wrist which

689
00:53:55,760 --> 00:54:01,160
was nice but there was no real repercussions other than you know a

690
00:54:01,160 --> 00:54:06,280
minor day and a half of chaos at Facebook headquarters the face of it

691
00:54:06,280 --> 00:54:10,680
that's and Google and we're talking you're talking tens of thousands of

692
00:54:10,680 --> 00:54:13,960
employees and contractors look at what they did to small developers right look

693
00:54:13,960 --> 00:54:19,520
what they did to the developer of the dash app on Mac which was a a API

694
00:54:19,520 --> 00:54:25,240
documentation and dev documentation macOS application who had a minor problem

695
00:54:25,240 --> 00:54:28,760
with his account because he was from I don't know the exact I don't remember

696
00:54:28,760 --> 00:54:32,800
the details but I remember I spoke to him he was basically he had a problem he

697
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:35,800
had to use a Eastern European card and Apple freaked out cuz they thought it was

698
00:54:35,800 --> 00:54:41,960
fraud they just threw him out with no communication that would never happen to

699
00:54:41,960 --> 00:54:49,200
Facebook right Facebook intentionally and overtly violated the policies and

700
00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:54,440
got little more than a slap on the wrist now to play devil's advocate here

701
00:54:54,440 --> 00:54:59,480
wouldn't the argument be on Facebook side well that's that's the that's the

702
00:54:59,480 --> 00:55:04,500
reward we get for making our products so appealing to end users that they

703
00:55:04,500 --> 00:55:10,880
demanded on the platform and and that's and Apple's Apple's defense is we we've

704
00:55:10,880 --> 00:55:15,960
we worked business to business with an important quote-unquote partner of ours

705
00:55:15,960 --> 00:55:19,920
on the App Store to make sure that we had a quick resolution to an application

706
00:55:19,920 --> 00:55:23,440
that's really important to our users now I grant you Facebook's actual core app

707
00:55:23,440 --> 00:55:26,680
was never at risk here but if we're talking about like the response of

708
00:55:26,680 --> 00:55:30,200
closing someone's developer account which thus kicked them out of the App

709
00:55:30,200 --> 00:55:33,640
Store as a result of that I don't think that was ever gonna happen to Facebook

710
00:55:33,640 --> 00:55:39,320
because of those two pretty defensible positions and that's a really shitty

711
00:55:39,320 --> 00:55:45,360
thing to say when you're an independent developer who's up against that but that

712
00:55:45,360 --> 00:55:48,720
is the way these businesses work because of the demand of users so there's a

713
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:52,880
famous Greek quote right the weak suffer what they must which is basically what

714
00:55:52,880 --> 00:55:59,160
you're saying so let's say if we had Chris book again by failing to be as big

715
00:55:59,160 --> 00:56:04,320
and as important as powerful as Facebook you will be inherently disadvantaged by

716
00:56:04,320 --> 00:56:10,120
what is supposed to be in quotes a neutral platform vendor

717
00:56:10,120 --> 00:56:13,720
it would be we just don't have a lot of neutral platform vendors there's always

718
00:56:13,720 --> 00:56:16,600
humans who are picking and choosing and making decisions and they're gonna

719
00:56:16,600 --> 00:56:21,000
always have in other spaces there are rules right let's say you know I really

720
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:25,800
don't want a competitor to open next door to me right but I cannot get Sun

721
00:56:25,800 --> 00:56:29,480
biz which is the Florida State Department's you know business

722
00:56:29,480 --> 00:56:33,080
corporation registry of course to forbid the registration of another development

723
00:56:33,080 --> 00:56:40,080
shop Apple can Apple can say hey you just can't be on the App Store true right

724
00:56:40,080 --> 00:56:43,960
or you can't make this style of application right I was good I yeah I

725
00:56:43,960 --> 00:56:48,240
was gonna say the web is the is the one true platform except one of the reasons

726
00:56:48,240 --> 00:56:52,680
we switched our Jupiter broadcasting YouTube in bed videos back to YouTube

727
00:56:52,680 --> 00:56:58,680
from our own hosted mp4 feeds is because several carriers out there are free

728
00:56:58,680 --> 00:57:03,560
rating YouTube and I'm competing against free so if you watch a video on our

729
00:57:03,560 --> 00:57:08,320
website it is going against your data if you watch it on YouTube it's free and

730
00:57:08,320 --> 00:57:12,640
that we looked at that and went well people aren't watching because of that

731
00:57:12,640 --> 00:57:17,280
so now we're embedding YouTube videos again and there's not really a neutral

732
00:57:17,280 --> 00:57:21,960
platform right it's the exact same issue of I think what is it t-mobile likes

733
00:57:21,960 --> 00:57:27,480
likes Netflix and Verizon likes YouTube right something weird like that yeah I

734
00:57:27,480 --> 00:57:29,760
don't know I think it's crazy I think everything should be forced to be

735
00:57:29,760 --> 00:57:35,640
neutral but again you can write Alan as you put a broadcasting calm I was gonna

736
00:57:35,640 --> 00:57:39,880
I was gonna go to Linux but then really you have I mean correct me if you think

737
00:57:39,880 --> 00:57:43,720
I'm wrong here West but even even Linux distributions aren't a neutral

738
00:57:43,720 --> 00:57:48,800
distribution platform because you have the opinions of maintainers and and what

739
00:57:48,800 --> 00:57:52,800
not that have to get the software in the distributions I don't really even think

740
00:57:52,800 --> 00:57:56,840
Linux is like a truly neutral distribution platform yeah I mean it's

741
00:57:56,840 --> 00:58:00,760
hard to know quite what neutral is I think at least there there's at least

742
00:58:00,760 --> 00:58:07,520
more more rules and at least in some distributions if you want you could step

743
00:58:07,520 --> 00:58:11,760
up and volunteer to maintain things and she'll be able to lobby for inclusion of

744
00:58:11,760 --> 00:58:14,240
whatever software you wanted if you were gonna do that work and you just don't

745
00:58:14,240 --> 00:58:18,200
have that option it's funny too that you haven't seen like I can see high you

746
00:58:18,200 --> 00:58:20,640
know 30% or whatever when you're when you're starting off you're trying to

747
00:58:20,640 --> 00:58:24,880
bootstrap but we all know how much cash Apple has right 30% is just quite the

748
00:58:24,880 --> 00:58:30,560
it's quite the cut yeah the issue is that they have to drive services revenue

749
00:58:30,560 --> 00:58:34,520
that's the only area of strong growth they have in that area that the market's

750
00:58:34,520 --> 00:58:38,360
watching very closely and so any cuts they make in this area take from

751
00:58:38,360 --> 00:58:42,520
services right I'm just like at one point to kind of sharpen my argument

752
00:58:42,520 --> 00:58:48,760
here because I feel like it's not just the preferential treatment it's there is

753
00:58:48,760 --> 00:58:54,040
a documented list of rules and the punishments are for you know I started

754
00:58:54,040 --> 00:58:57,840
when I was development the apps were opened right or bright before it open

755
00:58:57,840 --> 00:59:03,400
actually the punishments have been well documented over the years Facebook in

756
00:59:03,400 --> 00:59:07,520
particular is is such a privileged place where they cannot only get preferential

757
00:59:07,520 --> 00:59:12,040
treatment like you know call an Apple rep and get an answer they can actually

758
00:59:12,040 --> 00:59:20,320
openly and unapologetically violate the rules and just you know simply get

759
00:59:20,320 --> 00:59:25,640
probation for murder one basically which seems crazy to me that that would ever

760
00:59:25,640 --> 00:59:31,240
be acceptable yeah I mean I I can't disagree with you and we didn't even get

761
00:59:31,240 --> 00:59:35,440
to the conversation around the amount of control that Apple has and why I think

762
00:59:35,440 --> 00:59:39,920
the real reason it was such a minor punishment is because if they had gone

763
00:59:39,920 --> 00:59:44,580
any longer it would have started the conversation do we want to let Apple

764
00:59:44,580 --> 00:59:48,440
have this much control over the internal functions of Google and Facebook and

765
00:59:48,440 --> 00:59:52,640
other major corporations because the answer that is no and if they had put

766
00:59:52,640 --> 00:59:56,520
the pressure on any longer you know that would have been the conversation the

767
00:59:56,520 --> 00:59:59,560
only reason it didn't go that direction is because they pretty much tied things

768
00:59:59,560 --> 01:00:04,120
up in a day and a half and problem solved but if it had gone to a week that

769
01:00:04,120 --> 01:00:07,520
would have been that that would have been the focus of the conversation I mean

770
01:00:07,520 --> 01:00:12,600
PWAs are getting better every year and I I wouldn't be surprised if in the future

771
01:00:12,600 --> 01:00:16,920
these type of internal like order your burrito apps aren't just going to be

772
01:00:16,920 --> 01:00:23,520
PWAs and and that's the world we're going to I agree now we have we have to

773
01:00:23,520 --> 01:00:29,080
get going but mr. Payne you have any final thoughts you know I think that I

774
01:00:29,080 --> 01:00:31,480
think that wraps it up I mean there's so much more to talk about here and we'll

775
01:00:31,480 --> 01:00:34,800
we'll continue to see how this developments and how how this develops

776
01:00:34,800 --> 01:00:38,720
and how Apple does Apple actually embrace PWAs does that gonna be a thing

777
01:00:38,720 --> 01:00:41,800
is that I was just gonna see more on Android and in the Apple remains it's a

778
01:00:41,800 --> 01:00:45,720
little pristine wall to garden I don't know now you probably just have to keep

779
01:00:45,720 --> 01:00:48,920
tuning into coder radio maybe you could subscribe I don't know where to do that

780
01:00:48,920 --> 01:00:53,440
hmm maybe coder dot show slash subscribe we'd love to know your thoughts to coder

781
01:00:53,440 --> 01:00:57,920
dot show slash contact and links for everything we talked about today coder

782
01:00:57,920 --> 01:01:02,440
dot show slash 344 I want to before we go I got a couple of picks and I do want

783
01:01:02,440 --> 01:01:06,840
to say this we have to take all of this commentary on Apple about and the App

784
01:01:06,840 --> 01:01:10,920
Store and put it in the frame of the fact that I'm sitting right here with an

785
01:01:10,920 --> 01:01:14,400
iPad Pro right now so they're doing something right because one of the

786
01:01:14,400 --> 01:01:18,040
reasons I bought the iPad Pro is because it has the best apps and there is that

787
01:01:18,040 --> 01:01:22,280
reality and that aspect of the App Store is it it sells products so I don't I

788
01:01:22,280 --> 01:01:24,600
don't like what they're doing and I think everything you brought up is a

789
01:01:24,600 --> 01:01:27,360
valid point and I think they need to restructure based on the value they

790
01:01:27,360 --> 01:01:32,080
bring developers but they are doing some things right speaking of right I think

791
01:01:32,080 --> 01:01:35,560
you found a virtual machine in the web browser to learn see Wes this sounds

792
01:01:35,560 --> 01:01:41,520
awful right oh oh I'm here I'm here and I did I did find that so I don't know

793
01:01:41,520 --> 01:01:45,120
about you guys but especially like learning Linux I think it's a great example there's

794
01:01:45,120 --> 01:01:49,240
a lot of interactivity you know you type something wrong into the shell and it

795
01:01:49,240 --> 01:01:52,480
yells at you or maybe it deletes all your files but either way you feel bad

796
01:01:52,480 --> 01:01:57,480
and you got that fast feedback and and as as Mike will probably a test it's the

797
01:01:57,480 --> 01:02:00,320
same reason you do stuff in development like like test-driven developments

798
01:02:00,320 --> 01:02:04,200
you've got all these tests you know quickly if you make a change did you

799
01:02:04,200 --> 01:02:08,520
break anything did it actually work oh yeah it's harder to do that in C right

800
01:02:08,520 --> 01:02:11,880
like in Python or Ruby or even Java these days you can pull up a REPL you

801
01:02:11,880 --> 01:02:15,680
kind of play around get a feel for things see you got to go understand

802
01:02:15,680 --> 01:02:19,680
install install a compiler figure out how it works there's no like handy

803
01:02:19,680 --> 01:02:23,000
package manager or anything and then you have to go reason about this old

804
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:27,760
language that was designed to be like a slightly better assembler enter mini C

805
01:02:27,760 --> 01:02:32,760
which is just like an in browser embedded C environment for learning so

806
01:02:32,760 --> 01:02:37,080
it'll it'll show you what the what the what the compiled output looks like and

807
01:02:37,080 --> 01:02:40,880
sort of disassemble it a little bit and clarify what what's going on and then it

808
01:02:40,880 --> 01:02:45,960
shows you a big old hunk of memory and lets you step through it obviously you

809
01:02:45,960 --> 01:02:48,640
know if you're a professional C developer you can do all of this with all

810
01:02:48,640 --> 01:02:53,560
of your existing toolers all of your existing tooling GDB all sorts of stuff

811
01:02:53,560 --> 01:02:57,120
but if you're just getting started learning C isn't always easy especially

812
01:02:57,120 --> 01:03:01,760
if you're coming from like JavaScript I think this would be a great tool that's

813
01:03:01,760 --> 01:03:06,180
a cool find it's open source to links to all that in the show notes as mentioned

814
01:03:06,180 --> 01:03:11,440
earlier and you're on fire with the fines this week West nice job see geez

815
01:03:11,440 --> 01:03:15,920
you are you are good you are a sleuther of the Internet it's like a sponge now

816
01:03:15,920 --> 01:03:20,960
my sleuthing has gone in a weird direction this week I after that

817
01:03:20,960 --> 01:03:24,920
conversation about Apple being a kingmaker I thought it would be good to

818
01:03:24,920 --> 01:03:30,640
lighten the mood a little bit and I found a browser extension that I just

819
01:03:30,640 --> 01:03:34,840
suggest you install for a day I wouldn't leave this on forever we maybe give it a

820
01:03:34,840 --> 01:03:41,960
go it is a extension that adds a laugh track to any YouTube video on YouTube

821
01:03:41,960 --> 01:03:46,160
I'll give you an example here and a richer country than it was when I

822
01:03:46,160 --> 01:03:53,680
assumed office less than two years ago we are standing up for America and for

823
01:03:53,680 --> 01:04:00,400
the American people and we are also standing up for the world so you can

824
01:04:00,400 --> 01:04:05,440
play that along within a YouTube video and it makes everything better it's just

825
01:04:05,440 --> 01:04:08,640
a nice it's a nice thing to have and you can find a link to that in the show

826
01:04:08,640 --> 01:04:11,080
watch that's everything I think I'm gonna use it on Jupiter broadcasting

827
01:04:11,080 --> 01:04:15,000
videos that's not a bad idea I should that's what I should have got a clip of

828
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:19,040
that would have been that have been really good mr. Payne thank you thank you

829
01:04:19,040 --> 01:04:22,800
for not only filling in but sticking around now that we're gonna we're trying

830
01:04:22,800 --> 01:04:26,200
this out let us know what you guys think I'm still traveling so there probably be

831
01:04:26,200 --> 01:04:29,800
some more just a Wes and Mike episodes but when we get a chance from time to

832
01:04:29,800 --> 01:04:34,200
time we're gonna try to do the three of us love to know your thoughts coder dot

833
01:04:34,200 --> 01:04:38,480
show slash contact and I think I think I also registered coder radio dot show but

834
01:04:38,480 --> 01:04:42,280
I don't remember anymore so coder dot show slash contact to let us know what

835
01:04:42,280 --> 01:04:45,360
you think go get more Wes not only is the only Linux

836
01:04:45,360 --> 01:04:50,080
unplugged program but he's also on the revamped tech snap joined by Jim Salter

837
01:04:50,080 --> 01:04:55,600
from ours technica and very soon they have a deep dive coming up on network Q

838
01:04:55,600 --> 01:04:59,160
OS which could be very handy when developing and testing software they

839
01:04:59,160 --> 01:05:03,160
just did an episode deep dive on ZFS on Linux in the situation there and much

840
01:05:03,160 --> 01:05:07,320
more so go check out tech snap dot systems for that thank you us for being

841
01:05:07,320 --> 01:05:10,460
here mr. Dominic where do you want to send people this week I follow at

842
01:05:10,460 --> 01:05:15,840
diminuco on Twitter boom easy peasy but I won't say lemon

843
01:05:15,840 --> 01:05:21,660
squeezy Wes stay safe in the snow up there it's crazy 70 year snowstorm yeah

844
01:05:21,660 --> 01:05:24,360
I think the easiest way is to just keep podcasting right that way you'll know

845
01:05:24,360 --> 01:05:29,680
I'm yeah yeah we'll check in on you from time to time make sure you're live by

846
01:05:29,680 --> 01:05:32,600
being subscribed all the show that's just a great idea Wes well thank you

847
01:05:32,600 --> 01:05:35,640
everybody so much for being here I'm at Chris LAS on the Twitter the network is

848
01:05:35,640 --> 01:05:57,320
