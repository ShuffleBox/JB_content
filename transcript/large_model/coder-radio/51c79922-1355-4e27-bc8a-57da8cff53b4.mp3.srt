00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,080
This is KOTORadio, episode 489 for October 24th, 2022.

2
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:19,440
Well hey good buddy, welcome back to Jupiter Broadcasting's weekly talk show, taking

3
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:25,240
a pragmatic look at the art and the business of software development and the world of technology.

4
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:30,320
My name is Chris, and freshly celebrated, it's our host, Mr. Dominic.

5
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:31,320
Hello Mike!

6
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:32,320
Hello, hello, hello.

7
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:35,160
You still got that party glow?

8
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:36,160
Feeling good?

9
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:40,760
I'm feeling good, yeah, I've already been coding of course, because you can't stop.

10
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:44,880
So for those that weren't listening carefully last week, Mike snuck off and got married

11
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:45,880
this weekend.

12
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:46,880
I did.

13
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:47,880
Congratulations!

14
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:48,880
Thank you, thank you.

15
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:49,880
That's pretty exciting.

16
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:51,400
Yeah, good stuff.

17
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:57,520
You know, I mean, I said to myself after my first divorce, I'm never doing this again,

18
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:58,520
you know?

19
00:00:58,520 --> 00:00:59,520
Amen.

20
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:00,520
Never doing this again.

21
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:04,840
I'm a bachelor for the rest of my life, and then you know, you find the right lady and

22
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:05,840
you change your mind.

23
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:06,840
And then you do it again.

24
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:07,840
Yeah.

25
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:08,840
Yeah.

26
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:10,960
So in a few more years we'll be here, we'll be doing it all over again, but we'll do it

27
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:11,960
together.

28
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:14,960
No, I'm super happy for you guys.

29
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:17,680
Hopefully not, but yes, it's certainly possible.

30
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:20,720
I hope you gifted her like a KOTOR robe.

31
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:22,400
She already had a KOTOR robe, okay?

32
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:23,400
She was, she was-

33
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:24,400
Of course, right.

34
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:25,400
Well-prepared, yeah.

35
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:27,120
That's how you knew she was the right lady.

36
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:31,360
Your wardrobe choices, particularly your robe choices, are super important.

37
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:33,700
Oh yeah, they say a lot about a person.

38
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:38,200
And I did see on the Twitters this morning that there isn't quite a lot of wardrobe conversation,

39
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:39,200
sir.

40
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,200
I know.

41
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:43,600
You know, it's interesting that it strikes a note with people, you know, we get both

42
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:48,560
ends of the spectrum on the uniform stuff and on the wardrobe stuff.

43
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:53,480
I will tell you that behind the scenes I took a stab at putting together like a mock uniform

44
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:55,280
online and I just hated it.

45
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,280
I hated it.

46
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:59,080
I'll talk about that more in the future though.

47
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:02,160
I thought maybe we'd talk about something that really has our chat room fired up this

48
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:03,260
morning.

49
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:04,840
They were talking about it on the entire pre-show.

50
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:08,840
It's a story from a few years ago, but it's been getting shared around this week quite

51
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:11,320
a bit and it kind of hits our wheelhouse.

52
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:13,380
But before we get there, why don't we back up a little bit?

53
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:17,560
Some follow up on our discussion about software developers calling themselves engineers and

54
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:20,740
how up in Canada they were getting fined for that.

55
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:26,480
And in Quebec they even sued Microsoft for their Microsoft certified engineers program

56
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,800
and made Microsoft change the name.

57
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:29,800
Well Hank tweeted at us.

58
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:34,240
He says, the software engineer title, here's some background, engineers in the US can actually

59
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:39,080
take the exam and provide some other bona fides that entitle them to that title and

60
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:44,320
license of a professional engineer, which is, you know, usually just shortened to engineer

61
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:46,100
as Hank points out.

62
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:50,920
The title among other things provides some benefits, such as being an expert witness

63
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:53,300
in the court of law.

64
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:58,160
My fishing buddy on the other hand is in pollution control and the engineering title is required

65
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:01,080
in order to submit permit applications.

66
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:04,680
Calling someone a software network audio etc engineer is technically not correct if they're

67
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:09,480
not certified and the benefits of doing so in those fields would be slim, but it is common

68
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:12,120
use and language.

69
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:16,200
We really got a lot of feedback about this engineering title thing, but the thing that

70
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:23,320
really got people riled up is a few years ago in the state of Oregon, a man wrote in

71
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:31,240
about a bad algorithm essentially they were using to run the stoplights and do the stoplight

72
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:32,240
camera.

73
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:33,240
Yes, I remember this.

74
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:34,240
Yes.

75
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:36,480
He got fined for using the term engineer.

76
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:40,520
So we wrote in, this is like back in 2014 or something like that, but he writes into

77
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:44,800
the electronic to the whatever in Beaverton, Oregon, I don't know, you know, the I triple

78
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:45,800
E, I think.

79
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:46,800
Yeah.

80
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:47,800
Whoever it was.

81
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:51,640
And he says, Hey, I've noticed that there's a flaw with the way the math was done here.

82
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:56,120
Essentially you guys are doing the math as if this was a straightaway for a stoplight,

83
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:57,480
but it's a turning lane.

84
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:58,480
So people have to slow down.

85
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:04,240
He says, quote, they only looked at the vehicle traveling safely directly through an intersection.

86
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:07,680
However the equation they developed is not used for turning lanes.

87
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:12,220
When you make a turn, you slow down, but that's not accounted for in their solution.

88
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:16,040
So people are getting caught in red light cameras for making safe turns.

89
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:20,600
So he reached out to the engineering board, his local sheriff and 60 minutes, he wrote

90
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:23,940
them a letter and it was actually, you know, he shared it with vice.

91
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:25,880
It seems like a totally reasonable letter.

92
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:28,600
He says, you know, I am concerned it puts the public at risk.

93
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:32,220
I'd like to present these facts for your review and your comments.

94
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:36,820
The response he got back was a fine from the Oregon state board of examiners for engineering

95
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:38,400
and land surveying.

96
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:43,040
They responded back with, quote, their law prohibits the practice of engineering in Oregon

97
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,040
without registration.

98
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:49,640
At a minimum, the use of the title electronics engineer and the statement I am an engineer

99
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:51,400
creates violations.

100
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:58,120
In January of that year, they fined him $500 for practicing engineering without being registered.

101
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:02,260
So to be clear, his job title is electronics engineer.

102
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:05,560
He wrote a letter saying, hey, I think you made a boo-boo with the way you're doing the

103
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:09,160
calculation so people are getting red light fined.

104
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:13,360
And their response was a $500 fine and tell him to stop using the title engineer.

105
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,080
And it turns out he was right.

106
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:19,280
He says, I'm not a practicing engineer, it's just basic mathematics, Newtonian laws of

107
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:23,240
motion to make calculations that talk about what I found.

108
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:28,560
The engineering board, however, said he is not free to publish or present his ideas.

109
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:31,420
He says, when I first got the letter, I felt like I was being violated and shocked that

110
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:34,620
I could be treated like this in the USA.

111
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:37,360
And they're trying to restrict him from sharing this information.

112
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:41,440
I don't know how, because this has been years ago, so I don't know where it really led to.

113
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:45,120
And the guise of why he can't share it is because, well, you're not a certified engineer,

114
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,120
so this might be wrong.

115
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:49,760
For public safety, you can't go around talking about this, when in reality, they just wanted

116
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:51,400
to cover up their screw up, no doubt.

117
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:54,880
Yeah, we got a bunch of feedback about this.

118
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:58,840
And the emails I didn't read till this morning also attest to it.

119
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:02,660
Licensing is often used to keep people out of the field, right?

120
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:08,360
You can listen to, I think it was Ezra Klein years ago, or Matt Glaze, he has had a great...

121
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:14,360
They're very, very progressive guys, but they had a great thing about how certain more jerky

122
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:18,960
organizations will use licensing to actually racially segregate fields.

123
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:24,120
It's like you can't attain a certain level of license if your name codes as black or

124
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:26,080
Spanish or whatever.

125
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:28,800
In this case, I guess, like you're saying, they just wanted this.

126
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:33,360
I remember the story when it first came out, and it was kind of like a coder success story,

127
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,360
right?

128
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:35,360
This dude, like...

129
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:38,920
Because the other part of it, if I recall correctly, wasn't the county or the municipality

130
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:43,560
making money because the traffic light was overly aggressive?

131
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:46,640
Yes, that's got to be part of why they don't want him talking about it.

132
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:47,640
Right.

133
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:53,140
And by the way, I am not by this organization's definition an engineer, but I was for many

134
00:06:53,140 --> 00:07:00,320
years a member of IEEE, the Institute of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, so I'm not sure

135
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:01,320
how that works.

136
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:07,520
They were happy just saying, I feel like I'm reverting to 2014 Mike, if you give this kind

137
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:11,880
of gatekeeping power, someone's going to use it to be an ass.

138
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:18,080
And maybe the risk of some idiot doing something in JavaScript and screwing something up is

139
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:22,160
worth it, where they shouldn't be using JavaScript or something like that, right?

140
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:31,040
Is worth it to prevent this kind of draconian gatekeeping, in this case, I think, sort of

141
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:32,040
ass covering, right?

142
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:33,040
Nonsense.

143
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:38,720
You see, I think maybe what you're touching on is kind of a fundamental way that conservatives

144
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,320
versus progressives view the world.

145
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:46,560
I think the liberal progressive take, remember this is Orkin, would be, well, the idea of

146
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:49,980
this institution and what it's trying to accomplish is sound.

147
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:54,880
The problem is the execution and the corruption that inevitably sneaks in.

148
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:59,680
And so we just need a way of renewing these institutions and washing out this corruption.

149
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:00,680
Yeah, okay.

150
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:01,680
Sure.

151
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:02,680
I don't know, right?

152
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:03,680
It's never...

153
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:08,660
So what you're saying is, okay, Thomas Jefferson, let's burn it down every couple of generations

154
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:09,660
and start over.

155
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:10,660
Forescoring, my friend.

156
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:11,660
That's what I'm saying.

157
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:12,660
It'll never happen though, right?

158
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:13,660
Like it's...

159
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:17,600
I am sure someone from IEEE is going to write in and say, hey, Dick, you can pay for the

160
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:21,440
membership but it doesn't make you an engineer.

161
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:22,440
I don't know.

162
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:25,080
I guess I completely reversed myself in a week.

163
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:29,200
I think we should aggressively fight against this because you know why?

164
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:36,400
I've been on some really scummy bidding processes and I know for a fact that what will happen

165
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:38,840
is once there is some sort of licensure...

166
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:41,140
And who's to say there won't be different ones, right?

167
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:46,280
Like five different, 10 different, 20 where someone will lobby.

168
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:49,800
I could particularly see government agencies falling for this.

169
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:59,000
Oh, well, to really hit this standard of quality, you need to be a Martian software certified

170
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
engineer.

171
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:06,340
And only the Martian Engineering Institute can give you that or it just becomes like

172
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:07,340
a puppy mill, right?

173
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:08,340
You just have to pay.

174
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:09,560
Isn't that what the tech industry does now?

175
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:13,920
The Microsoft certifications, the RHEL certifications, Cisco certifications?

176
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:16,800
Because people don't care that much about them.

177
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,280
And they're open enough.

178
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:21,920
No one at RHEL, no one at Red Hat is trying to stop people from getting it.

179
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:24,440
In fact, they're encouraging it, right?

180
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:26,160
Microsoft would love for...

181
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:29,240
And we know this for a fact, they would love for me to come on and tell everyone to take

182
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:31,720
a Microsoft software engineering class.

183
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:33,560
You basically should not.

184
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:37,020
But Sun used to push this, right?

185
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:41,200
And Oracle tried for a while with the Java...

186
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:44,200
They had like a whole weird journeyman master, like they had a whole...

187
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,200
The Duke crew.

188
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,200
The Duke crew.

189
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,200
That's what it was.

190
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,120
Yeah, they had a whole thing.

191
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,960
It's basically nonsense.

192
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:55,720
I mean, I don't know.

193
00:09:55,720 --> 00:10:02,020
I guess if I look at the fact that it takes our country, sorry, Europeans, but it takes

194
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:07,600
our country, what is it like 40 times the amount to build anything as it does anywhere

195
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:13,680
else and twice as long, somebody can correct the statistics, but it's huge.

196
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:18,760
If you're asking me that we should turn software into that by adding more hurdles to jump,

197
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:20,440
I'm just going to say no.

198
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:24,040
If that's true, though, how badass must we be if people still want to build here after

199
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,920
all that?

200
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:26,920
We must be the best.

201
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:33,720
Well, if you've been to like an airport recently or, I don't know, driven on any road in Florida,

202
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:38,960
I can tell you that we need to, honestly, we need to get some dudes over from China

203
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:41,540
to teach us how to build things again.

204
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:46,440
There is Chinese airports, Chinese train stations, I'm not even going to mention Japan's bullet

205
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:51,520
trains, hell, European train stations, right, the metro, much better.

206
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:56,880
Can I tell you what bothers me about this story, about this gentleman who rode in and

207
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:59,500
then got fined for larping as an engineer?

208
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:02,600
That the cops obviously narked him out to the engineering floor.

209
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:06,400
Yeah, actually, like, what is that process, right?

210
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:07,400
Right.

211
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:10,680
Yeah, somebody got pissed and was like, all right, let's forward this on.

212
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:13,560
Yeah, that also crossed my mind.

213
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:19,080
I think what disturbs me if I really kind of think about my reaction to this story and

214
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:25,000
I dig down what's underneath that reaction, it's that these institutions that we've kind

215
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:30,360
of pegged as our guiding signal of what's good, what's accurate, what we can trust,

216
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:34,640
you know, this guy is an engineer, I can trust him so he can build this thing for me.

217
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:38,000
They seem petulant and petty and corrupt.

218
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:43,580
And the fact that a complaint about a totally legit issue with how the red light cameras

219
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:49,440
are being triggered, ends up getting forwarded to this organization who not only finds him,

220
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:53,460
but then actively attempts to suppress the information when he tries to share it publicly.

221
00:11:53,460 --> 00:11:57,620
They find him, but they find him with the force of law behind them.

222
00:11:57,620 --> 00:12:02,720
So presumably were he to refuse to pay, the sheriff will just come collect the $500, right?

223
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:08,000
I guess it makes it feel like the rule makers aren't playing by the rules, and yet we have

224
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,960
to follow the rules.

225
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:12,700
I disagree a little.

226
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:15,040
They're making rules that favor their club, right?

227
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:17,860
They favor their organization.

228
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:20,080
They made the rule, right?

229
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:26,080
This engineering organization made the rule and got that local municipality or state to

230
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:29,920
make their rule the law that you can't even say, I'm an engineer.

231
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:30,920
What if you wear a t-shirt?

232
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:31,920
I'm an engineer.

233
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:32,920
Fine.

234
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:33,920
Fine.

235
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:34,920
You're going to get a fine.

236
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:35,920
Fine.

237
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:36,920
There's $500.

238
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:37,920
I guess it just, it's chilling.

239
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:39,000
It's chilling as a small business owner.

240
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
That's what it is.

241
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,700
Honestly, when I get down to it, when I get, it's to me and when I think about trying to

242
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:46,200
run a business and I try to think about the next few years and the challenges that are

243
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,200
coming.

244
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,200
Oh man.

245
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:52,080
And I think the goalies and the rule keepers aren't even, aren't even really following

246
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:53,080
the rules.

247
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:54,660
It's just so frustrating.

248
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:57,840
But let's move on to actually making that money.

249
00:12:57,840 --> 00:13:03,080
So if you ever get into independent software development or IT contracting like I did or

250
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:09,760
advertising sales, you often have to enter the realm of estimations.

251
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:15,400
And you know how much our dear Mr. Dominic loves doing estimates on projects.

252
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:21,040
In fact, if it wasn't for his outlandish estimate, when I first started talking to him, we probably

253
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:29,360
wouldn't be doing this podcast today because the estimate was too damn high.

254
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:35,320
So you found this great medium piece, Seven Estimation Anti-Patterns.

255
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:37,560
And I have a feeling there's some inspiration in here.

256
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:39,040
Where do you want to start?

257
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:40,400
So there's some good stuff, right?

258
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:46,240
We covered this a couple of years ago, not this piece, but one of the many predecessors

259
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:47,760
to it.

260
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:52,440
And basic premise, I'm sure everybody listens to this, probably knows.

261
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:55,440
Estimates are hard.

262
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:56,440
And yeah, that's it.

263
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:57,440
All right.

264
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:58,440
Yeah.

265
00:13:58,440 --> 00:13:59,440
There we go, everybody.

266
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:06,960
So this guy who is a relatively prominent TypeScript developer, we'll just, we'll forgive

267
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:10,640
him, has seven anti-patterns.

268
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:12,760
Now some of them are like Ladoi.

269
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:14,120
So I'm just going to burn through them.

270
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:15,120
Estimates because we have to.

271
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:18,360
The podcast following order sucks, but hey, that's life.

272
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:23,920
He said, I strongly disagree with that being an anti-pattern.

273
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:29,520
And I think anti-pattern might be more better phrased mistakes in this case.

274
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:32,200
But I'm all right.

275
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:35,040
We're going to talk about the hashtag no estimates at the end here.

276
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:39,920
I am just going to assert for my evaluation of his seven anti-patterns that just throwing

277
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:45,560
your hands up, stamping your feet and saying, I refuse to estimate anything is a pink slip

278
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:47,320
inducing moment for you.

279
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:48,480
No kidding.

280
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:49,780
That only works for doctors.

281
00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:51,080
Nobody else gets away with that.

282
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:52,080
Right.

283
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:54,760
We'll talk about it at the end, but I'm going to totally table that.

284
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:58,640
His second anti-pattern is neglecting different estimation opinions.

285
00:14:58,640 --> 00:14:59,880
He's got a point, right?

286
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:04,640
So there's like powerful personalities that can be on a team, people who see things differently.

287
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:09,900
It is good to get most people's feedback, but the dude who just came out of bootcamp

288
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:15,820
a week ago and the guy who was like an engineer at Bell Labs for 20 years, I might consider

289
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:18,160
awaiting their opinions slightly differently.

290
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:19,980
I don't know.

291
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:22,160
One estimator to rule them all.

292
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:23,160
Little weird.

293
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:28,700
I've never actually seen this in the real world, but I guess having like one lead developer,

294
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:32,400
she just estimates everything.

295
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:35,960
I guess this man has seen that if he has, that does seem crazy to me.

296
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:37,480
That seems bizarre.

297
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:41,640
I could tell you what we do at TMB is we just be just double or triple blind everything.

298
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:47,520
So more senior people go and we estimate and then we come back to each other and why did

299
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:49,080
you think this and why did you think that?

300
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:51,440
And then we usually, yeah.

301
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:54,840
I could definitely see someone that reviews them, reviews an estimate.

302
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:55,840
Like yeah, absolutely.

303
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:56,840
Yeah.

304
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:57,840
Estimating taking forever.

305
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:59,920
This is the one I thought was pretty late.

306
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:04,480
Like yeah, you can't spend three weeks estimating something in today's world.

307
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:05,480
We just don't live in that world.

308
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:06,480
Right?

309
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:07,480
Yeah.

310
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:08,760
The deal will be closed by the time you get them your estimates.

311
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:09,760
Right.

312
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:10,960
Closed by somebody.

313
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:11,960
By Chris Fisher LLC.

314
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:12,960
Right.

315
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:13,960
I mean.

316
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:18,400
And I got to say this is an area I actually did struggle with a lot is I could get really

317
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:21,520
bogged down in trying to make sure I thought of all of the hardware components and all

318
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:26,040
of the time we would need to configure things and I could spend days and that was something

319
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:30,720
I had to train out of myself is more high level, you know, explain more so they understand

320
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:32,560
there could be some price variation here.

321
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:35,040
You know, you don't have to actually get all of the details right then.

322
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:36,040
Right.

323
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:39,680
You could spend hours on AliExpress searching for all the different Raspberry Pi dongles

324
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:42,660
and attachments and components you can buy.

325
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:45,760
But maybe just find one that you can get in decent quantities.

326
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:47,160
Yeah.

327
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:48,720
Estimates need to be correct.

328
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:56,760
This one, again, I was tempted to say Ladoi, but he's got a point, so I'm going to quote

329
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:57,920
him a little bit.

330
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:01,600
The urge to have correct estimates is an anti-pattern that is based on the misunderstanding that

331
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:06,640
through knowledge or analysis will result in a clear path towards doing the work.

332
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:11,440
And whenever something took longer or shorter, it shows a lack of knowledge or insufficient

333
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:12,440
analysis.

334
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:16,560
It came off as kind of mean to me.

335
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:19,120
But the more I thought of it, he's right.

336
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:23,840
Estimates can be wrong because customers exist and change their mind.

337
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:24,840
Right.

338
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:30,920
Or Mary Sue wasn't at the original meetings because she wasn't there for vacation or whatever.

339
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:34,400
And now she's back and it turns out she's like the director of brand or whatever at

340
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:35,780
that company.

341
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:38,640
And she actually really, really needs this animation and you guys didn't estimate it

342
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:41,180
in and it's a pain in the butt because it's not built into iOS.

343
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:44,840
This is maybe a real world story moving on.

344
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:48,880
Wait, wait, before you do, I took it another way.

345
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:54,480
I took that as from the client's perspective, from the customer's perspective.

346
00:17:54,480 --> 00:18:05,400
If you estimate $15,000 and it comes in at $43,000 or $22,000 or even $18,000, they will

347
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:08,480
think you didn't estimate correctly.

348
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:12,720
Even if they are actually the ones that caused the scope creep, they're the ones that had

349
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:19,840
to send you back three times to change the colors, their first reaction is going to be

350
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:22,400
it's your fault because you're the person selling to them.

351
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:26,200
You told me it's going to be $15,000, now you're telling me it's $18,000.

352
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:27,340
You must have estimated wrong.

353
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:29,160
What did you get wrong?

354
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:30,240
That is a very good point.

355
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:32,680
I could definitely see reading it that way.

356
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:36,880
The other sad truth with that is, unfortunately, it's almost always your fault even when it's

357
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:38,300
not right.

358
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:42,880
If you want to keep the relationship, keep them as a customer, you're going to have to

359
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:47,480
not eat the money, definitely don't eat $30,000, but find a way to change the conversation

360
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:53,840
from well, Mary Sue was on vacation in Maui when this decision was made and we didn't

361
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:59,680
bid that into, okay, obviously, we need to change course here.

362
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:03,120
It's an uncomfortable conversation, but you basically got to get more money out of them.

363
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:10,560
I think the only way to really do that, in my experience, successfully is constant expectation

364
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:15,760
setting, letting them know, hey, the way this is going right now, this is going to cost.

365
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:20,640
Just like immediately, as soon as the conversation comes up, you start bringing up how that could

366
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:22,720
increase the cost.

367
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:26,800
If you don't, it just gets harder and more awkward to mention it as time goes on.

368
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:30,200
Well, it's like any relationship, right?

369
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:37,440
The deeper into unhappiness you are with each other, the harder even little, Chris and I

370
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:38,440
are both divorced, right?

371
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:43,280
I won't speak for Chris, but when everybody's getting along, forgetting to turn on the dishwasher

372
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:45,160
is nothing.

373
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:49,720
When everybody's been fighting for six months, you will go to war for that.

374
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:51,120
Yeah, right.

375
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:52,120
That's so well put.

376
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:53,120
All right.

377
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:58,680
His last one, one of the most harmful anti-patterns of estimates is how they are misused as commitments

378
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:03,140
by people outside the team, people with power over the team.

379
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:06,520
And after everything I discussed already, it is probably clear that this is dumb.

380
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:08,240
Still many developers are in this position.

381
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:12,360
I actually totally reject this one.

382
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:15,720
And his headline for this estimates are turned into commitments.

383
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:17,540
I'm curious what you feel about this, Chris.

384
00:20:17,540 --> 00:20:23,000
My take is the end client, the end customer, the business stakeholders, the product managers,

385
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:30,160
your fellow developers, the DBAs, the QC people, your dog, right?

386
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:33,080
People need to know when things are roughly going to be done.

387
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:37,920
They need to know what things are going to roughly cost within reason, even if it's not

388
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:41,600
like this is what the entire project costs forever and ever and ever.

389
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:45,760
This is like what your monthly runway is going to be or something in that ballpark.

390
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:52,880
I just don't agree that they're not some form of maybe not firm in stone like Moses's

391
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:55,760
Ten Commandments, but they're like a soft guideline, right?

392
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:57,200
They're a soft commitment.

393
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,200
They have to be.

394
00:20:58,200 --> 00:20:59,200
Right.

395
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:00,200
Unfortunately.

396
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:06,520
I mean, I guess if you had some sort of super awesome modern hipster tooling that everybody

397
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:12,200
could go and check the status of the of the project and get real time updates, that could

398
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:15,560
substitute some kind of estimate that gets circulated.

399
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:16,880
But so it's funny you bring that up.

400
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:18,880
I did some searching.

401
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:24,440
There is a cottage industry of SAS companies who want to sell you their whiz bang.

402
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:27,100
We will estimate for you tool, huh?

403
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:30,400
Is it like based on like hook it to your Trello and we'll figure out your velocity or hook

404
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:31,400
it to your Jira.

405
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:32,400
A lot of Jira.

406
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:33,400
Yeah, I see.

407
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:34,400
Huh?

408
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:35,400
Yeah.

409
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:36,400
Of course.

410
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:37,400
Of course there is.

411
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:38,400
Yeah.

412
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:39,400
Kind of.

413
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:40,400
You say it.

414
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:43,680
Now you say, like, it sounds like a good idea.

415
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:49,040
It feels like one of those ideas that's like super seductive, but always that's like the

416
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:50,040
fourth martini.

417
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:52,160
It sounds like a good idea.

418
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:54,260
Definitely won't be tomorrow.

419
00:21:54,260 --> 00:21:56,840
Until some sort of tooling is adopted, probably in the metaverse.

420
00:21:56,840 --> 00:22:00,800
Yeah, it's always going to act as a way to at least that rough milestones.

421
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:05,360
So wait, wait in the metaverse when you're doing estimating, I got to do this.

422
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:06,360
You'll pop right in.

423
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:08,200
It'll just be this giant Trello board, right?

424
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:10,960
There'll be this floating Trello board right there in the middle of the room.

425
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:14,900
You described a nightmare I keep having, actually, where Trello cards are just like spinning

426
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:16,720
at me like ninja stars.

427
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:17,720
Right.

428
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:18,720
You got to dodge them.

429
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:19,720
There's so many.

430
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:20,720
You open up a door.

431
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:22,440
They just come piling down on top of you.

432
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:26,380
It's the most horrific game of Beat Saber ever played.

433
00:22:26,380 --> 00:22:30,680
Every card is marked high priority.

434
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:32,240
So but in the metaverse, I like this.

435
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:35,800
If the sales guy gives an estimate, can you walk in the metaverse and smack him in the

436
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:37,800
back of the head?

437
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:39,600
You'll have actually a virtual martini.

438
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:41,800
You could just, you know, toss on his face.

439
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:45,400
Well, you know, we could get the Ferengi to hook us up with some Synthohol and just pour

440
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:48,040
it on him.

441
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:50,200
So the last one is others do the estimation.

442
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:53,120
This is my slap the sales guy in the back of the head one.

443
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:54,120
I agree.

444
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:55,120
That's a bad idea.

445
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:58,320
Sales guy, their job, collect sale, make commission.

446
00:22:58,320 --> 00:22:59,640
Their job.

447
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:02,840
Usually a lot of them don't care about actually like managing the customer relationship.

448
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:05,220
The good ones do, but they're very expensive.

449
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:07,640
So yeah, got to watch that.

450
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:10,800
It's kind of like bearing the lead.

451
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:16,040
This is the number I in my experience, the number one issue can be in this situation.

452
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:19,880
Sales will promise the moon for the to get to close the sale and they'll say that engineering

453
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:20,880
can do anything.

454
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:21,880
I mean, they really will.

455
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:27,840
It's been I know it's a cliche, but I have witnessed it happen over and over again and

456
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:33,400
it's unbelievable what they and then now that's what the customer expects.

457
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:35,820
And that was the very at the very beginning of the relationship.

458
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:38,760
They have that expectation and you're constantly trying to live up to that.

459
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:39,760
All right.

460
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:40,760
I was having flashbacks.

461
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:41,760
Yeah.

462
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:49,560
So, OK, let's talk about the very vocal, very angry Twitter.

463
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:51,920
No estimates, guys.

464
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:55,000
I still don't buy it.

465
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,000
I just don't buy it.

466
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,640
I talked about it years ago.

467
00:23:57,640 --> 00:24:00,360
We got a lot of spicy emails about it.

468
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:01,880
I don't know where you're working.

469
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:03,880
I don't know what you're doing.

470
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:09,440
Even like internal product products or projects, there is absolutely no way you don't need

471
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:10,920
to know what things cost.

472
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:13,800
Well, maybe they are doing government contracts.

473
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:16,600
OK, Raytheon, you don't count.

474
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:17,600
I agree.

475
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:18,600
It seems impossible.

476
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:22,840
The only way it could possibly work is if it was like internal proposals and somebody

477
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:24,120
else just dealt with budget.

478
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:29,920
Well, I had it explained to me several times and it's just so foreign from anything I've

479
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:30,920
ever seen.

480
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:33,560
How would how would even work like the customer?

481
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:38,920
I mean, part of opening the door to the relationship is the estimate process and the emails that

482
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:39,920
come back and forth.

483
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:42,200
Like that's part of the courting part process.

484
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:46,880
I don't understand how you land the sale without an estimate at some point eventually.

485
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:51,560
So let me let me try to steel man their argument and I'll tell you why I rejected out of hand.

486
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:56,360
So the best version of their argument is the estimates are effectively lies.

487
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:59,000
You're troubling the relationship by starting it off.

488
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:02,360
You know, you're always going to they basically believe you're always going to underestimate,

489
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:05,560
which I think is actually like as a premise, probably true.

490
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:06,560
Right.

491
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:09,960
It's I would say, you know, on average, it's more true than not.

492
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:13,240
It's one of those things I think we would all agree on on its face, but we don't have

493
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:15,360
the numbers.

494
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:18,460
You know, you want to keep a it's very like super duper agile.

495
00:25:18,460 --> 00:25:22,160
You want to keep a tight connection with the customer and you want to keep things flowing.

496
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:28,280
But where I don't what they don't talk about is that sales process that you were just talking

497
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:36,320
about, because I don't know what niche they're in, but there are other vendors who would

498
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:38,900
be more than happy to take a contract from you.

499
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:40,240
He doesn't want to do an estimation.

500
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:41,240
No problem.

501
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:42,240
We will.

502
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:44,280
You know, entities have processes, right?

503
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:47,600
Businesses have processes and a lot of that process.

504
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:53,240
They have revolver on RFPs for pressure proposals and writing proposals is a thing that happens.

505
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:59,160
Now I definitely have adopted a little bit of the no estimate attitude is I'm not going

506
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:01,160
to do like a 14 page proposal.

507
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:04,760
I usually try to do a one or two page or broad strokes.

508
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:08,960
You know, this would be like an hourly or a weekly or whatever, however kind of arrangement

509
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:11,320
we're doing run rate.

510
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:18,560
But the idea to just do nothing to just say, hey, you'll find out later seems a little

511
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:20,480
hardcore.

512
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:24,200
I am happy to hear from you all again.

513
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:26,800
Perhaps I have misunderstood something.

514
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:32,520
I would love to know some real world cases, even if it was, you know, in confidence where

515
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:39,040
this has actually worked because I have never in my very, very long time of doing this started

516
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:43,520
a conversation where someone didn't ask me at least how long something was going to take,

517
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:44,520
right?

518
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:50,360
If not, you know, directly opening the money conversation in the first first meeting.

519
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:51,480
So I don't know.

520
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:58,800
The other the other, I guess, elephant in the room here is Agile XP, which I get.

521
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:00,920
It's called Beast now, which is insane.

522
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:01,920
Oh, yeah.

523
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:04,360
I don't know Twitter.

524
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:08,560
We got to rebrand everything so we can be gurus right and sell consulting services.

525
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:09,560
Yeah.

526
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:13,120
And plus, if you give it a newer, cooler name, you know, maybe you can bring in some more

527
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:15,600
people because it's not that old weird agile thing.

528
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:16,880
This is beast.

529
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:18,840
This is beast mode, baby.

530
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:20,680
Tiger's blood.

531
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:21,680
Tiger's blood.

532
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:24,480
If anybody gets that reference, good work.

533
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:27,920
That is one way to avoid the big overarching estimate.

534
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:31,560
And that is basically what I do.

535
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:33,800
But you're still giving an estimate of some sort.

536
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:39,840
You're giving a whether it's monthly, weekly, biweekly, a sprint, you probably have a very

537
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:44,800
stable run run rate, you definitely have to tell the customer if that run rate is going

538
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:48,320
to go up and get their approval for that, right?

539
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:51,520
Let's say you're adding someone or removing someone.

540
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:57,720
And I think the the dirty little thing behind agile is it really assumes a time and materials

541
00:27:57,720 --> 00:28:04,000
billing structure where you're de risking really the project for everybody, but definitely

542
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:07,120
for you.

543
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:09,400
Because you're not doing a ton of design upfront, right?

544
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:12,800
You're not doing BDuff, you're not doing waterfall.

545
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:17,840
Sometimes problems last over a decade, or in this case, 30 something years.

546
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:22,120
Sometimes they are in fact hard.

547
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:23,600
Linode.com slash coder.

548
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:27,680
Go there to get $100 in 60 day credit, it's a great way to support the show and try out

549
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:28,680
Linode.

550
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:31,720
So it's Linode.com slash coder.

551
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:35,040
Linode is just simply fast, reliable cloud hosting.

552
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:37,960
You've got to try it for your next project, maybe for your personal site.

553
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:41,220
It's what I use personally, it's what we use for the business too.

554
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:44,880
Especially now that Linode has been rolling out these MVME upgrades, systems just got

555
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:49,240
MVME disk and all of a sudden, my existing Linode systems were getting faster.

556
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:52,520
And now of course, you can deploy systems with MVME from the get go.

557
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:56,100
And Linode has recently announced they're going to open a dozen new data centers over

558
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:57,100
next year.

559
00:28:57,100 --> 00:29:01,520
And you know, Linode is their own ISP too, so the connections are super fast.

560
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:06,340
Oh man, I meant to pull up this GPU rig, I wonder if I can get logged in fast enough.

561
00:29:06,340 --> 00:29:11,200
So over the weekend, we set up a GPU rig for Linux Unplugged because we were playing around

562
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:12,680
with stable diffusion.

563
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:20,400
And until that point, I had been using it on my M1 Ultra Max Diffusion B, but then we

564
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:29,720
threw stable diffusion on a Linode with an RTX 6000 GPU and 32 gigabytes of RAM and eight

565
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:31,380
CPU cores.

566
00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:34,920
And I believe, although I was trying to verify this, but I'm pretty sure I saw this too,

567
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:40,280
I believe it has a 40 gigabit connection to the internet.

568
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:44,040
That's so crazy and I mean, surprise, surprise, right?

569
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:49,840
But it smokes my MacBook Max Ultra machine on the stable diffusion stuff.

570
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:54,280
I mean, stuff that the MacBook would take like a couple of minutes to do, this thing

571
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:56,320
does in like 10, 20 seconds.

572
00:29:56,320 --> 00:30:00,720
The Linode infrastructure is so fast and powerful because on the other end, right, I've got

573
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:02,760
these little itty bitty Linodes too.

574
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:06,900
I've got what they call a Nanode, which is just this tiny little box that we use just

575
00:30:06,900 --> 00:30:10,640
to do status checking of our systems, you know, just to do health checks and make sure

576
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:12,480
everything's online.

577
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:14,760
And the scale there is incredible.

578
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:21,680
I've got systems with one gig of RAM and I've got systems on Linode with 96 gigs of RAM

579
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:24,340
and 48 CPU cores on that one too.

580
00:30:24,340 --> 00:30:29,980
I mean, the range is, it's so great and the pricing is still 30 to 50% cheaper than anything

581
00:30:29,980 --> 00:30:33,600
at the hyperscalers and you get the full machine.

582
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:35,680
Like I get, this whole Linode is mine.

583
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:38,000
I have root access, I log in, I set everything up.

584
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,660
It's screaming fast.

585
00:30:39,660 --> 00:30:41,760
They also have dedicated physical boxes available now.

586
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:45,680
Of course, they have S3 compatible object storage, totally compatible with Kubernetes

587
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:52,400
and your other infrastructure management tools, great DNS tools, firewalls, node balancers,

588
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:54,840
you name it, Linode has got it and the pricing is right.

589
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:57,600
Plus you're going to get a hundred bucks if you support the show and go to linode.com

590
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:58,600
slash coder.

591
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:01,880
You can really try just to buy anything out with that hundred dollar credit.

592
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:02,880
So go try it out.

593
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:03,880
See why we love it.

594
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:04,880
Linode.com slash coder.

595
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:12,080
You know, a lot of people are listening thinking, if he just got married, what's he doing on

596
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:13,080
the show?

597
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:15,960
Because that's what people said to me on Sunday when I said, yeah, join us.

598
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:17,920
It's going to be a great coder because Mike just got married.

599
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:21,120
You know, give him a congrats, come into the chat room, say hi to him.

600
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:22,480
And people are like, what?

601
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:29,480
He's coming to work on Monday after he just got married, which I did something very similar.

602
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:31,200
What are we just a glutton for punishment?

603
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:35,520
Well, you're up there in Seattle and I didn't want you to, you know, I was a little afraid

604
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:38,000
you were feeling those Microsoft vibes.

605
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,720
Yeah, I got you.

606
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:41,720
I got you.

607
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:42,720
Yeah.

608
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:43,720
You know, that's true.

609
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:44,720
It's dark days up here.

610
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:49,080
So you and I, we got a band together and stay strong because you asked me over the weekend

611
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:54,200
and I have heard from a couple of listeners who worked at Microsoft.

612
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:59,280
I say worked the, although they were laid off a bit ago actually July, I think.

613
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:03,960
Yeah, not with this recent, most recent round, but Microsoft is laying off, quote, under

614
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:07,520
1000 workers, 999, baby.

615
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:08,520
Yeah.

616
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:13,760
But that's after there's also been some low key layoffs for the last few months.

617
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:16,600
And then of course, I thought Brad Sam's on Twitter had an interesting point.

618
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:20,300
He says, I get the companies have to make priorities and cuts happen, but it's odd when

619
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:26,080
that same company is trying to spend $70 billion on acquisition.

620
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:28,160
It feels odd.

621
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:34,320
That is a hard like $70 billion feels like a lot of money right now to basically control

622
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:35,960
the console video game market.

623
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:37,360
I don't think that's too bad.

624
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:38,360
Yeah.

625
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:42,240
I mean, to be to be the Disney of video games, ultimately, it's probably not too bad, but

626
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:47,600
it does seem hard when you're laying off people, but still spending 70 bill to bring in, you

627
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:50,000
know, a company that's riddled with issues.

628
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:57,160
However, I had to think about this Microsoft, Apple and Google have been doing this layoff

629
00:32:57,160 --> 00:33:02,840
thing and they're doing it low key, but they are occasionally making announcements.

630
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:04,760
Now, why would a company make an announcement?

631
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:14,320
Why would they do some that are low key on the DL and then announce some via press release?

632
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:17,880
And when a company releases something like a might when a public company like Microsoft

633
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:23,380
or Apple release something via press release, in part, they're signaling to the market.

634
00:33:23,380 --> 00:33:25,680
They're signaling to Wall Street.

635
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:30,720
And what Microsoft and Apple and Google are signaling is we're taking leadership on this

636
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:31,720
issue.

637
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:38,840
We recognize that the last 10 years of loose money, zero interest rates, everybody's been

638
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:40,800
at a party with free alcohol.

639
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:41,800
Think of it that way.

640
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:44,460
That's actually what's been going on in the financial markets.

641
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:51,380
The Fed's been throwing a banger of a party for a decade and the bar has been free.

642
00:33:51,380 --> 00:33:58,220
And so companies have been sucking up billions of dollars and they've been hiring like crazy

643
00:33:58,220 --> 00:34:02,080
in the name of what investors call chasing beta.

644
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:08,060
And what that roughly means is they're chasing something that doesn't return value today,

645
00:34:08,060 --> 00:34:13,080
but will likely one of these bets will pay off big in the next decade.

646
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:15,960
And so you're chasing future return.

647
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:20,720
And what's happened because rates have gone up, what, 65%, 70%, I mean, the rates are

648
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:24,080
going and they're continuing to go up, the interest rate, the price of money is continuing

649
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:30,240
to go up, the bar is now charging and the price is going up monthly.

650
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:35,120
And so now what investors are seeking and they're looking for it really bad right now,

651
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:38,460
really hard, is what they call alpha.

652
00:34:38,460 --> 00:34:39,880
That's return today.

653
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:40,880
That's value return.

654
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:44,120
This is your Warren Buffett type investor, your value investor.

655
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:47,080
You invest in things that are making money today.

656
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:51,160
And the view by investors has become it's time.

657
00:34:51,160 --> 00:34:53,680
You've just had a decade of free money.

658
00:34:53,680 --> 00:34:57,920
If you didn't produce something that returns money at this point, it's time for you to

659
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:59,120
die.

660
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:05,140
And so you're seeing the very large companies take a leadership role in pivoting to value.

661
00:35:05,140 --> 00:35:11,060
Apple has paused production of the iPhone 14 Pro because demand is soft and they want

662
00:35:11,060 --> 00:35:13,180
to keep revenues up.

663
00:35:13,180 --> 00:35:19,080
They're doing layoffs, Google, Microsoft, Apple layoffs, and then you have your mid

664
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:25,600
to small tech companies that have just been pumped with series A, B, C, D, even F rounds

665
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:30,000
of funding, which is we're going to look back at that as ludicrous and they're dying off

666
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,120
and they're going to be laying off.

667
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:33,840
Saved by acquisition, some of them, right?

668
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:34,840
Right.

669
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:35,840
Yeah.

670
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:38,840
Or I should say the investors, the VCs will be saved by acquisition.

671
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:39,840
Yeah.

672
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:42,400
The companies will be strip mined for IP and the most valuable.

673
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:43,400
Right.

674
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:47,640
One might think of Twitter in this case, who, I mean, Elon Musk has to be their best friend

675
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:48,640
right now.

676
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:49,640
Somehow.

677
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:54,720
Supposed 75% layoffs, he's, how could, is that, could that be real that he's really

678
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:55,720
thinking that?

679
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:56,720
Yeah.

680
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:57,720
Cause the company's not worth 50.

681
00:35:57,720 --> 00:35:59,120
I mean, wouldn't everybody else has covered it.

682
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:00,880
It's the math is stupid, right?

683
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:01,880
That's something.

684
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:02,880
Don't tweet drunk or high.

685
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:04,160
That's all I got to say.

686
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:07,840
And don't send letters through the SEC drunk or high either.

687
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:15,280
I feel bad for the people being laid off, but like every bender, this one had to end.

688
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:16,280
Yeah.

689
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:17,720
But the hangover could be pretty significant.

690
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:20,320
It's well, it's going to be full on withdrawals, right?

691
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:22,840
Until the bar goes free again, which I imagine it will at some point.

692
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:24,600
I'm hoping it doesn't.

693
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:28,160
Early episodes of the show, I used to rail against these companies that don't in fact

694
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:29,160
make money.

695
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:30,160
Right.

696
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:31,160
They don't turn a profit.

697
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:35,540
These startups, they just, you know, they, they burn through money and they just get

698
00:36:35,540 --> 00:36:41,640
acquired as an acqui-hire or they get acquired and they get acquired based on their potential

699
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:43,240
future revenue.

700
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:47,360
And then everybody who's in a leadership role or on the board, I may or may not have firsthand

701
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:52,520
experience with this, gets a payout based on the theoretical stocks that they own that

702
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:55,380
are going to be worth something at some point in the future.

703
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:59,420
And so there's this massive exchange of money, even though the company never necessarily

704
00:36:59,420 --> 00:37:05,200
got profitable and sustainable, but they had a future potential value and that's what they

705
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:06,200
get.

706
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:08,720
Some of that is that there's a ratio of that, that they get bought for and then everybody

707
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:09,720
gets paid out.

708
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:10,720
Yeah, absolutely.

709
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:14,440
Or I mean, I shouldn't name the company, but there was a company, I did not work there.

710
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:19,020
I did not contract there, but I knew some of the developers there in New York that did

711
00:37:19,020 --> 00:37:25,360
basically a Netflix for books style thing, a large tech company bought them simply to

712
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:27,400
kill them.

713
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:29,420
That was it.

714
00:37:29,420 --> 00:37:30,420
That is so common.

715
00:37:30,420 --> 00:37:31,420
Oh yeah.

716
00:37:31,420 --> 00:37:34,080
And Zapier, can you just buy us?

717
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:35,080
We'll go away.

718
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:38,320
But that is like, what's up?

719
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:48,600
That's so, it's just, it was such a Roman-esque bacchanalia that it had to stop.

720
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:52,080
If you watch the show, We Crashed, a lot of people think, well, that's insane.

721
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:53,080
That's a joke.

722
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:55,640
I've seen like that.

723
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:58,200
I've seen literal penis statues.

724
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:06,440
I've seen parties that can only be described as like Dante-esque, some circle of hell that

725
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:08,800
no one's coming out of their happy, right?

726
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:11,480
There's no way the money printer doesn't turn back on.

727
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:12,480
Come on.

728
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:16,360
There's no way, because there are just things on the books that the government is committed

729
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:21,800
to paying that somebody has to buy that debt.

730
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:26,360
And the issue is, is that that debt is getting less and less attractive to buyers right now.

731
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:29,360
And so inevitably the buyer of last resort will be the Federal Reserve.

732
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:31,720
They'll step in, they'll start buying the government's debt again.

733
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:32,720
Yeah.

734
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:33,720
It'll have to happen.

735
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:37,880
If that happens, then in the, particularly in whatever sector is hot right now, but this

736
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:42,800
last round it was tech, and in particular like consumer software, you're going to have

737
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:49,120
these boom and bust cycles, whatever, whether there's B2B software or something else, you're

738
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:55,400
going to have these crazy, honestly, if that's true, now's the time to start your business,

739
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:57,000
get some foundations.

740
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:02,000
And when the bar says happy hour, take that VC money, baby, and get out, get out in five

741
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,000
years.

742
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:07,440
I mean, look what happened is instead of, instead of chasing traditional investments

743
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:11,120
like bonds and things like that, investors went after tech.

744
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:12,440
That's what they went after.

745
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:16,000
And they stopped, they stopped caring about the fundamentals.

746
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,960
And so a company didn't necessarily have to make profit in order for everybody to get

747
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:19,960
paid out.

748
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:28,280
What's happening is we have a massive glut of under skilled tech leadership out there.

749
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:33,520
The whole leadership team for so many of these companies, and you guys know this is true,

750
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:38,040
are totally mediocre because they didn't have to be great.

751
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:41,300
They weren't fighting for absolute survival.

752
00:39:41,300 --> 00:39:45,960
There wasn't this natural selection where the absolute rock stars of the companies are

753
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:54,240
the ones that get promoted because the profit came from the investments, not from the product.

754
00:39:54,240 --> 00:40:00,080
And so it created a culture of extremely weak leadership.

755
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:03,040
And some of that has to be rained out as well.

756
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:08,000
I mean, I would like the money printer to stay off for a while because the longer we

757
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:13,140
keep raising rates, the longer the money printer stays off, the more of this gets cleaned out

758
00:40:13,140 --> 00:40:14,140
of the system.

759
00:40:14,140 --> 00:40:19,880
Unfortunately, the worse it gets, the more jobs, the more of the supply chain gets damaged,

760
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:22,680
the more long term damage that gets done to the economy.

761
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:26,440
So part of me doesn't want it to keep going, but I would love to see some of this get cleaned

762
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:27,440
up.

763
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:28,440
Okay.

764
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:33,040
But isn't this kind of, okay, I see what you're saying, the supply chain.

765
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:37,640
But isn't part of that because of just how easy it was for these companies when the,

766
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:40,920
when the ale was flowing freely, so to speak?

767
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:41,920
Yeah.

768
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:43,520
That they didn't build up the muscles, right?

769
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:47,800
These are like, these are like, I have a Tibetan spaniel, these dogs would never survive in

770
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:48,800
nature ever.

771
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:49,800
Exactly.

772
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:51,800
Or, but a wolf could, right?

773
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:57,040
Hell, a husky could, a beagle could, we need to, I don't know, be better breeders.

774
00:40:57,040 --> 00:41:01,880
Someone's going to hashtag that, it's going to be bad.

775
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:08,520
Mike gets married, extols young tech entrepreneurs to be better breeders, gets canceled by GLAD.

776
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:13,840
Just I'm thinking of like startups I've seen that were so stupid on their face.

777
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:20,440
I don't know how those guys survived the call home to mom, let alone a board meeting, right?

778
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:25,840
I mean, you're probably right though, since if unemployment hits what, like 8%, the government

779
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:32,160
will freak out and it'll be absinthe and gin for everybody.

780
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:36,280
There's already, no, supposedly it was leaked to the Wall Street Journal that the Federal

781
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:40,240
Reserve is considering making changes to their current strategy.

782
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:44,800
Janet Yellen just earlier this week came out and said, we think it's getting a little dicey,

783
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:47,400
it might be time for a policy change.

784
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:51,200
So I don't know, I think we're already starting to actually see it, unfortunately.

785
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:55,520
Doesn't it chap your ass though, like businesses like ours and like our friends at System76

786
00:41:55,520 --> 00:42:02,760
and other places that actually just like managed to survive and, you know, actually make money.

787
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:04,960
They kind of missed out on this.

788
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:08,120
But if they keep the pressure up for long, all our customers could be gone.

789
00:42:08,120 --> 00:42:12,000
Well, yeah, but so how do you say, so there's no way to solve the problem.

790
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:17,520
Basically we go into another drunken bender or we what, it's the ice age?

791
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:18,520
I don't know.

792
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:20,080
I mean, that's above our pay grade.

793
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:23,760
I think what a lot of people that are listening are probably thinking, well, that's, you know,

794
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:29,400
once we go through one more bender and, you know, maybe we make it a few more years and

795
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:32,880
by the time that bender is wrapped up, maybe a CBDC is ready.

796
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:34,480
That's what I think probably a lot of people would speculate.

797
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:35,480
I don't know.

798
00:42:35,480 --> 00:42:36,480
I really have no idea.

799
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:39,360
But, you know, the one thing that's remarkable is they always manage to pull a trick out

800
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:45,520
of their hat and keep things going, you know, so it's almost safe to bet on that, I suppose.

801
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:47,200
I think it's interesting.

802
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:53,300
Our sponsor, Talescale, I noticed was super savvy about the way they raised funds recently

803
00:42:53,300 --> 00:42:55,840
in December of last year or somewhere around there.

804
00:42:55,840 --> 00:43:01,200
Like I think their leadership clearly saw this downturn coming and made some really

805
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:05,480
clever moves to invest long term in their infrastructure because I think they suspected

806
00:43:05,480 --> 00:43:08,160
that, you know, the money printers were stopping as well.

807
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:11,680
And so there's tech companies out there that will thrive in this environment.

808
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:13,960
I'm legitimately a little nervous about it.

809
00:43:13,960 --> 00:43:17,720
You know, it's sort of like I'm just a monkey in a zoo.

810
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:20,600
I don't really have any say over what the zookeepers do.

811
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:26,660
So I should just sit back and try to enjoy my cage and swing from the branches and see

812
00:43:26,660 --> 00:43:27,660
what happens.

813
00:43:27,660 --> 00:43:33,160
But I think actually in some ways you and I are better positioned.

814
00:43:33,160 --> 00:43:38,520
If we had a staff of 30, 40 or 100, I think you and I would probably be in more of a panic

815
00:43:38,520 --> 00:43:39,520
mode right now.

816
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:40,520
Oh, yeah.

817
00:43:40,520 --> 00:43:41,520
Oh, yeah.

818
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:42,520
So we'll see.

819
00:43:42,520 --> 00:43:45,200
Batten down the hatches, another storm approaches.

820
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:50,840
Always an uplifting show for you guys.

821
00:43:50,840 --> 00:43:52,460

It allows you to manage SSH connections between your boxes.

828
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:19,360
It has AirDrop like functionality so you can send files between all of your Talescale network

829
00:44:19,360 --> 00:44:25,680
machines, your devices, your Linux boxes, Windows, Mac, Android, you name it.

830
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:29,680
I use it on a Raspberry Pi, I use it on my VMs, I use it on my physical systems.

831
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:33,960
I even install it on my Home Assistant instance using the Home Assistant add on.

832
00:44:33,960 --> 00:44:38,600
It's just super powerful and it puts all of my devices on a flat network with static IPs

833
00:44:38,600 --> 00:44:40,240
and you can throw DNS in there.

834
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:41,520
Now you're doing name resolution.

835
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:44,400
Doesn't matter if you're at home, the coffee shop, you're at work.

836
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:47,920
It's all the same IP, all protected by WireGuard.

837
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:52,040
It's a mesh network that gets up and running in under two minutes and they've got so many

838
00:44:52,040 --> 00:44:55,280
great features that just take it to the next level that once you start using those different

839
00:44:55,280 --> 00:45:00,200
things like subnet routing or like I mentioned this Talescale send, like these tools you

840
00:45:00,200 --> 00:45:03,360
start combining them and it really improves your workflow.

841
00:45:03,360 --> 00:45:07,760
It makes it possible to get access to files and services regardless of where you're at

842
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:11,440
without ever having to open up a firewall port.

843
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:15,960
I've closed all my firewall ports, no more inbound traffic from the internet.

844
00:45:15,960 --> 00:45:16,960
That's great.

845
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:20,280
So go see for yourself, go see why I love it so much, why everybody here at JB uses

846
00:45:20,280 --> 00:45:26,240
it and try it for free for up to 20 devices at talescale.com slash coder.

847
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:32,000
One more time to support the show you go to talescale.com slash coder.

848
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:37,880
You know the reason why I've been wanting to talk about this with you is because I think

849
00:45:37,880 --> 00:45:44,920
one undeniable kind of interesting retrospective aspect of this show is we have stumbled into

850
00:45:44,920 --> 00:45:51,280
documenting really interesting trends, Apple's pivot to services, Microsoft's pivot to embracing

851
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:54,920
open source, buying GitHub, like that whole trajectory where they went.

852
00:45:54,920 --> 00:46:00,360
Our show has covered the span of Microsoft hates Linux to Microsoft loves Linux and now

853
00:46:00,360 --> 00:46:03,240
they're, you know, now we know where they're at.

854
00:46:03,240 --> 00:46:07,080
Like we've covered a lot of interesting trends, Docker obviously we'd love to mention.

855
00:46:07,080 --> 00:46:12,560
And I think the one that we're stumbling into now only because we're older and we've seen

856
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:15,440
a few things now, we kind of see it coming.

857
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:20,940
I think we're watching a reshaping of our tech industry, a reshaping of the very industry

858
00:46:20,940 --> 00:46:26,240
that you and I have watched develop over the last decade while the money printer go burr.

859
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:29,800
We're watching it now rebuild itself.

860
00:46:29,800 --> 00:46:32,640
And the question at this point is, is how far does it go?

861
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:33,640
Is it surface level?

862
00:46:33,640 --> 00:46:35,880
Does it end up being more structural?

863
00:46:35,880 --> 00:46:37,400
Time will tell.

864
00:46:37,400 --> 00:46:41,140
And I suspect the real action actually happens next year.

865
00:46:41,140 --> 00:46:46,560
But I think people that listen to this show are going to have hopefully a better understanding

866
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:48,760
of what's going on in real time.

867
00:46:48,760 --> 00:46:51,040
And the great thing about this show is it's two way street.

868
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:55,480
People send in emails and boosts and we start the conversation and I think we actually inevitably

869
00:46:55,480 --> 00:46:59,040
work out what's really going on well before most people get there.

870
00:46:59,040 --> 00:47:03,480
And it's been a really fascinating thing to kind of watch over the years of this show.

871
00:47:03,480 --> 00:47:08,200
And another one of these things that I am convinced is happening, I'm kind of here for

872
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:14,240
it, but it's absolutely happening, is it is open Zuck hunting season.

873
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:18,400
I was sitting on the couch last night after Linux Unplugged with Wes.

874
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:22,460
And I was just telling Wes, I was like, Wes, like every Sunday I see these pieces come

875
00:47:22,460 --> 00:47:27,200
out from Fortune, Business Insider and Wall Street Journal and they're always like these

876
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:30,360
hit pieces on Zuckerberg and Meta.

877
00:47:30,360 --> 00:47:34,200
Sometimes they're good and juicy and sometimes they're really just weak sauce, but man they

878
00:47:34,200 --> 00:47:35,200
crank them out.

879
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:37,780
One of them at least cranks them out on the regular.

880
00:47:37,780 --> 00:47:44,320
And I refreshed my feeds literally as I was saying that, and I saw a couple of these land.

881
00:47:44,320 --> 00:47:45,320
That's incredible.

882
00:47:45,320 --> 00:47:46,920
I have links in the show notes.

883
00:47:46,920 --> 00:47:51,340
One is quote, this is the headline quote, Mark Zuckerberg's 10 billion plan to make

884
00:47:51,340 --> 00:47:57,760
it impossible for remote workers to hide from bosses, done, done, done.

885
00:47:57,760 --> 00:48:01,360
You know what it really comes down to is, well, if you're in the metaverse, they'll

886
00:48:01,360 --> 00:48:05,480
know when you're logged in and we don't even know what the physical implications are of

887
00:48:05,480 --> 00:48:08,040
being in the metaverse all day, so that could be bad.

888
00:48:08,040 --> 00:48:09,040
That's like the root.

889
00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:11,640
Dammit, Zuck, 1984 wasn't a how-to guide.

890
00:48:11,640 --> 00:48:12,640
Yeah, right.

891
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:14,720
And then here's the other one that landed.

892
00:48:14,720 --> 00:48:17,720
Mark Zuckerberg should make Facebook, Facebook again.

893
00:48:17,720 --> 00:48:23,080
The Meta CEO should prioritize growing engagement and revenue on the company's core apps and

894
00:48:23,080 --> 00:48:25,480
drop this Meta crap.

895
00:48:25,480 --> 00:48:30,940
And then very quietly, The Wire published a retraction.

896
00:48:30,940 --> 00:48:36,480
They retracted two recent stories about Meta's x-check program and says that it's using quote

897
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:41,240
independent external experts to investigate its coverage overall.

898
00:48:41,240 --> 00:48:45,360
I think something's going on there and they've discovered a little insider bias.

899
00:48:45,360 --> 00:48:52,240
Now I'm no Mark Zuckerberg fan, but I definitely recognize a sustained media campaign when

900
00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:53,240
I see one.

901
00:48:53,240 --> 00:48:57,900
There is clearly just people just trying to take Mark and Meta down.

902
00:48:57,900 --> 00:49:03,440
It's always either about Mark Zuckerberg or how Meta is crap every single time.

903
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:07,160
And I don't know, maybe it gets clicks or maybe there's just something else at play.

904
00:49:07,160 --> 00:49:08,160
What do you think?

905
00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:09,480
Is my is my bacon tasty?

906
00:49:09,480 --> 00:49:15,440
I think your bacon's tasty, but what kind of bacon I need before I, you know.

907
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:19,080
Well, actually, Mark Zuckerberg hunted this bacon himself and he smoked.

908
00:49:19,080 --> 00:49:20,080
Oh, Jesus.

909
00:49:20,080 --> 00:49:21,080
That's right.

910
00:49:21,080 --> 00:49:22,080
Yeah.

911
00:49:22,080 --> 00:49:23,080
You know how he likes to hunt his own meat.

912
00:49:23,080 --> 00:49:25,920
He's a strange man.

913
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:29,880
The problem is, as you were talking about the Zuck, I kept picturing the bad guy in

914
00:49:29,880 --> 00:49:33,920
Batman versus Superman, the kid who plays Lex Luthor.

915
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:38,440
And I'm honestly, I think that's a better, you know, the Facebook movie than the actual

916
00:49:38,440 --> 00:49:39,880
the Facebook movie.

917
00:49:39,880 --> 00:49:42,760
It's kind of who he is, right?

918
00:49:42,760 --> 00:49:44,000
He's I don't know.

919
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,600
It's I'm sure it's a caricature.

920
00:49:46,600 --> 00:49:51,640
But have you have you watched him like some of his earlier talks?

921
00:49:51,640 --> 00:49:53,480
Yeah, he's gotten better.

922
00:49:53,480 --> 00:49:54,480
He's been coached clearly.

923
00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:55,480
Oh, yeah.

924
00:49:55,480 --> 00:49:56,480
I was talking with who was it?

925
00:49:56,480 --> 00:49:57,480
Wasn't Kara Swisher.

926
00:49:57,480 --> 00:49:58,480
It was Lex Friedman.

927
00:49:58,480 --> 00:49:59,480
Lex Friedman.

928
00:49:59,480 --> 00:50:00,480
Thank you.

929
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:01,480
Was was pretty good.

930
00:50:01,480 --> 00:50:06,080
But like, I wouldn't say he is Lex Luthor, but he's definitely Luthor curious, right?

931
00:50:06,080 --> 00:50:07,080
He's Luthor adjacent.

932
00:50:07,080 --> 00:50:10,960
The man comes out and says he wants to be like Octavius Caesar.

933
00:50:10,960 --> 00:50:13,000
That's that's just a big statement, right?

934
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:16,960
That's just those whose history is not quite as nerdy as mine.

935
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:19,840
That would be the Emperor Augustus.

936
00:50:19,840 --> 00:50:21,080
It's just a lot, right?

937
00:50:21,080 --> 00:50:22,680
It's I don't know.

938
00:50:22,680 --> 00:50:25,160
I mean, he's a rich guy.

939
00:50:25,160 --> 00:50:30,480
His company has done some ethically questionable stuff, we could say.

940
00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:36,480
And I do think like all these big companies are kind of evil in their own way, in that

941
00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:42,000
they are amoral constructs that are designed to extract as much labor and capital out of

942
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:47,480
the world as possible while contributing as little as possible.

943
00:50:47,480 --> 00:50:49,920
But damn, they just need a better front man.

944
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:53,240
Like, I don't know what to say.

945
00:50:53,240 --> 00:50:57,140
You can't convince me that like Apple is not evil.

946
00:50:57,140 --> 00:51:01,040
But Tim Cook like knows to be like, I love Alabama football and let's go help out some

947
00:51:01,040 --> 00:51:03,920
kids over here and whatever, right?

948
00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:07,640
Did you see the video of him at the Formula One racing waving the sign?

949
00:51:07,640 --> 00:51:08,640
No, I didn't.

950
00:51:08,640 --> 00:51:09,640
Oh, God.

951
00:51:09,640 --> 00:51:11,560
He could not look more disinterested.

952
00:51:11,560 --> 00:51:13,700
I think he was probably just nervous and focused.

953
00:51:13,700 --> 00:51:20,160
But with the sunglasses and his overall resting grump face, he just could not look more disinterested

954
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:24,520
in waving the Finnish flag.

955
00:51:24,520 --> 00:51:25,520
You should find it.

956
00:51:25,520 --> 00:51:26,520
It's floating around on Twitter.

957
00:51:26,520 --> 00:51:27,520
I see.

958
00:51:27,520 --> 00:51:28,520
I don't watch racing.

959
00:51:28,520 --> 00:51:30,240
But yeah, I would definitely like to see that.

960
00:51:30,240 --> 00:51:35,200
It's like Satya Nadella, even better example.

961
00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:37,560
He seems like a genuinely nice guy.

962
00:51:37,560 --> 00:51:43,960
But his job is to maximize the amount of capital and labor Microsoft can extract and minimize

963
00:51:43,960 --> 00:51:46,060
the amount it contributes.

964
00:51:46,060 --> 00:51:51,760
That is why they all have this double Irish Dutch tax going on with these inversions,

965
00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:54,840
which by the way, no one's talking about now that we're potentially going to war.

966
00:51:54,840 --> 00:51:55,840
Just throwing that out there.

967
00:51:55,840 --> 00:51:56,840
Yeah.

968
00:51:56,840 --> 00:51:59,120
We what happened to all like that was really heating up there for a minute.

969
00:51:59,120 --> 00:52:00,120
Yeah.

970
00:52:00,120 --> 00:52:01,120
Elizabeth Warren was up in arms.

971
00:52:01,120 --> 00:52:02,120
You know, they were going to go now.

972
00:52:02,120 --> 00:52:03,120
Oh, no.

973
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:06,720
The ridiculous tax structures of these companies are OK.

974
00:52:06,720 --> 00:52:07,860
Cool.

975
00:52:07,860 --> 00:52:09,400
Maybe suck should take more coaching.

976
00:52:09,400 --> 00:52:14,240
I can't convince me he's more evil than than most of the rest.

977
00:52:14,240 --> 00:52:15,720
I don't maybe he is right.

978
00:52:15,720 --> 00:52:16,720
I don't know.

979
00:52:16,720 --> 00:52:18,600
It's like on the tech CEO scale.

980
00:52:18,600 --> 00:52:22,440
I'm not sure on the CEOs of all of the world's companies.

981
00:52:22,440 --> 00:52:23,440
Definitely not.

982
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:24,760
There's some nasty characters.

983
00:52:24,760 --> 00:52:28,960
Well, let's take a jaunt over to the fossil fuel industry and meet those gentlemen.

984
00:52:28,960 --> 00:52:29,960
Right.

985
00:52:29,960 --> 00:52:30,960
I don't know.

986
00:52:30,960 --> 00:52:34,240
Or the military industrial contracting complex, perhaps.

987
00:52:34,240 --> 00:52:37,920
I think they're great and they should hire me.

988
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:38,920
Was that was that Mr. Cheney?

989
00:52:38,920 --> 00:52:39,920
Excellent.

990
00:52:39,920 --> 00:52:40,920
Thank you, Mr. Vice President.

991
00:52:40,920 --> 00:52:42,760
See, I didn't get shot.

992
00:52:42,760 --> 00:52:49,920
Asked not what your podcast can boost for you, but what you can boost for your podcast.

993
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:52,640
Trev Dev boosted in with 2000 sats.

994
00:52:52,640 --> 00:52:53,640
All right.

995
00:52:53,640 --> 00:52:56,000
The uniform crap is just another expensive distraction.

996
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,800
I have two drawers in the house, a shirt drawer and a bottom store.

997
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:02,720
Buy whatever T-shirts or jeans that you like and worry less about the tomato sauce.

998
00:53:02,720 --> 00:53:03,720
Damn.

999
00:53:03,720 --> 00:53:06,520
Yeah, he's coming in hot there, I should say, really.

1000
00:53:06,520 --> 00:53:09,480
I probably should have played coming in hot with the boost.

1001
00:53:09,480 --> 00:53:10,760
Yeah, that's hot.

1002
00:53:10,760 --> 00:53:18,000
I feel like it's a lot of upfront thought and figuring out, but then years of not having

1003
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:19,000
to think about it.

1004
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:20,000
You're paying your taxes early.

1005
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:21,080
Is that that's what you're saying?

1006
00:53:21,080 --> 00:53:22,080
I kind of.

1007
00:53:22,080 --> 00:53:23,080
Yeah.

1008
00:53:23,080 --> 00:53:24,080
Yeah.

1009
00:53:24,080 --> 00:53:26,720
It's like I'm buying a lifetime membership to like easy clothing, but I got to pay the

1010
00:53:26,720 --> 00:53:28,140
fee upfront.

1011
00:53:28,140 --> 00:53:32,000
That's kind of my thought, although we'll see, because I am worried that I get a uniform

1012
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:33,680
and then like I'm bored with it in a month.

1013
00:53:33,680 --> 00:53:39,040
What happens if you get a uniform in like four years, one piece is discontinued?

1014
00:53:39,040 --> 00:53:40,040
Yeah.

1015
00:53:40,040 --> 00:53:41,960
I don't know, because that seems super possible.

1016
00:53:41,960 --> 00:53:46,240
I've thought about do I like I mean, if I really liked it, I would probably every now

1017
00:53:46,240 --> 00:53:49,880
and then try to buy a couple of extra just so I'd have.

1018
00:53:49,880 --> 00:53:54,320
I mean, you know, and then I suppose if it if it if it ran out, I could always do a uniform

1019
00:53:54,320 --> 00:53:55,320
update.

1020
00:53:55,320 --> 00:53:56,320
Yeah, it seems like a lot of work, though.

1021
00:53:56,320 --> 00:53:57,320
I mean, that's like a distro update.

1022
00:53:57,320 --> 00:53:59,520
I'm not sure I won't even touch that.

1023
00:53:59,520 --> 00:54:01,880
Anonymous pleb boosted in with a row of ducks.

1024
00:54:01,880 --> 00:54:04,120
This old duck still got it.

1025
00:54:04,120 --> 00:54:07,680
Two thousand two hundred and twenty two stats corporatism is doomed.

1026
00:54:07,680 --> 00:54:10,760
Corporatism is innate to humans and critical for civilization.

1027
00:54:10,760 --> 00:54:17,200
FYI, I'm using Bitcoin and lightning to send anonymous messages and tips right now.

1028
00:54:17,200 --> 00:54:20,200
Anonymity with Bitcoin is possible with the right tools.

1029
00:54:20,200 --> 00:54:22,880
Yeah, fair enough.

1030
00:54:22,880 --> 00:54:23,880
Fair enough.

1031
00:54:23,880 --> 00:54:28,920
I suppose there are ways you can also do coin joins and whatnot to hide your coins, but

1032
00:54:28,920 --> 00:54:29,920
it's not perfect.

1033
00:54:29,920 --> 00:54:32,720
I would be careful.

1034
00:54:32,720 --> 00:54:36,640
Marcel boosted in with seventeen oh one enterprise sets.

1035
00:54:36,640 --> 00:54:37,640
Make it so.

1036
00:54:37,640 --> 00:54:42,440
In America, does the First Amendment protect you if you say you're a medical doctor or

1037
00:54:42,440 --> 00:54:43,440
a financial adviser?

1038
00:54:43,440 --> 00:54:46,360
If you're not, I'm actually curious.

1039
00:54:46,360 --> 00:54:50,180
I didn't think of the freedom of speech angle, but I'm a Canadian and we don't have that

1040
00:54:50,180 --> 00:54:51,240
per se.

1041
00:54:51,240 --> 00:54:53,240
That's totally a thing in Canada.

1042
00:54:53,240 --> 00:54:57,120
I have a master's in electrical engineering, but I'm not, quote, an engineer because I

1043
00:54:57,120 --> 00:54:59,320
didn't do an exam and pay my fees.

1044
00:54:59,320 --> 00:55:00,760
Well, how about that?

1045
00:55:00,760 --> 00:55:04,280
So he has a master's in electrical engineering, but he's not considered an engineer.

1046
00:55:04,280 --> 00:55:08,400
I think if you went around and said you're a doctor or a financial adviser, you might

1047
00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:11,520
have the right to say that, but you also have the right to get your ass sued.

1048
00:55:11,520 --> 00:55:12,520
Well, wouldn't it?

1049
00:55:12,520 --> 00:55:14,640
Well, yeah, you might get your ass kicked, but wouldn't it be?

1050
00:55:14,640 --> 00:55:16,880
I mean, we're not lawyers, right?

1051
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:20,720
But until you actually commit fraud, you're just a jackass.

1052
00:55:20,720 --> 00:55:26,820
Like if every untrue statement that you heard was a crime, I encourage our Canadian listeners

1053
00:55:26,820 --> 00:55:30,080
to come to a bar in the American South.

1054
00:55:30,080 --> 00:55:31,800
They call them tall tales.

1055
00:55:31,800 --> 00:55:32,800
They're just bull.

1056
00:55:32,800 --> 00:55:33,800
Yeah.

1057
00:55:33,800 --> 00:55:34,800
Yeah.

1058
00:55:34,800 --> 00:55:35,800
Everybody be in jail.

1059
00:55:35,800 --> 00:55:36,800
Yeah.

1060
00:55:36,800 --> 00:55:39,200
Or if you think about like all the influencers who exaggerate their credentials on, you know,

1061
00:55:39,200 --> 00:55:42,520
the social media sites, all of Instagram just gone.

1062
00:55:42,520 --> 00:55:43,520
Yeah.

1063
00:55:43,520 --> 00:55:44,520
Right.

1064
00:55:44,520 --> 00:55:45,520
Yeah.

1065
00:55:45,520 --> 00:55:46,520
Yeah.

1066
00:55:46,520 --> 00:55:47,520
So you could say dumb stuff.

1067
00:55:47,520 --> 00:55:51,840
Generally it's if you like rob somebody or attempt to commit fraud, you're, you're probably

1068
00:55:51,840 --> 00:55:56,100
guilty of a crime again, not attorneys, but isn't that why that kid who threw that stupid

1069
00:55:56,100 --> 00:55:57,100
party got in trouble?

1070
00:55:57,100 --> 00:56:00,740
I forgot his name, but you can like pretend to be this rich party planner.

1071
00:56:00,740 --> 00:56:05,520
It's when you actually take people's money that you've, the guy who got them all, FEMA

1072
00:56:05,520 --> 00:56:09,040
had to go help the rappers and the hip hop folks, remember?

1073
00:56:09,040 --> 00:56:11,560
Oh, not the fire island thing.

1074
00:56:11,560 --> 00:56:12,560
Are you thinking?

1075
00:56:12,560 --> 00:56:13,560
Yeah.

1076
00:56:13,560 --> 00:56:14,560
It was something.

1077
00:56:14,560 --> 00:56:15,560
Yeah.

1078
00:56:15,560 --> 00:56:16,560
Fire.

1079
00:56:16,560 --> 00:56:17,560
It was fire festival or something.

1080
00:56:17,560 --> 00:56:18,560
Fire festival.

1081
00:56:18,560 --> 00:56:19,560
That was it.

1082
00:56:19,560 --> 00:56:20,560
Yeah.

1083
00:56:20,560 --> 00:56:21,560
Okay.

1084
00:56:21,560 --> 00:56:22,560
Yep.

1085
00:56:22,560 --> 00:56:23,560
All right.

1086
00:56:23,560 --> 00:56:24,560
Right.

1087
00:56:24,560 --> 00:56:25,560
The crime wasn't his Instagram feed and he was lying the whole time.

1088
00:56:25,560 --> 00:56:26,560
The crime was that he actually took their money.

1089
00:56:26,560 --> 00:56:27,560
It's an interesting point that there's a bit, there is quite a distinction there between

1090
00:56:27,560 --> 00:56:28,560
Canadians and the States as well.

1091
00:56:28,560 --> 00:56:32,400
Which also, I got to say, I think triggered Optimus Grey last week.

1092
00:56:32,400 --> 00:56:34,400
He came in with 2048 sats.

1093
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:35,400
B-O-O-S-T.

1094
00:56:35,400 --> 00:56:36,960
Mike, I was triggered.

1095
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:39,240
Canada, Mexico, Brazil are in America.

1096
00:56:39,240 --> 00:56:41,440
What you call America is the USA.

1097
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:42,960
The United States of America.

1098
00:56:42,960 --> 00:56:43,960
Oh God.

1099
00:56:43,960 --> 00:56:47,840
We do use America in place of USA here, but Canadians are also Americans.

1100
00:56:47,840 --> 00:56:50,000
Canadians are not United States citizens though.

1101
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:51,480
Sorry, I had to.

1102
00:56:51,480 --> 00:56:53,200
I just got triggered.

1103
00:56:53,200 --> 00:57:00,280
You know, I had this from family up in Canada when I referred to the States as America.

1104
00:57:00,280 --> 00:57:05,640
I got pulled aside and I got a talking to like, you need to understand something.

1105
00:57:05,640 --> 00:57:06,880
This is all America.

1106
00:57:06,880 --> 00:57:08,760
The continent is America.

1107
00:57:08,760 --> 00:57:11,520
And they are very annoyed by this.

1108
00:57:11,520 --> 00:57:14,200
This is something that they take quite seriously.

1109
00:57:14,200 --> 00:57:15,200
And you know what?

1110
00:57:15,200 --> 00:57:16,200
That's fair.

1111
00:57:16,200 --> 00:57:19,960
I just wonder is Optimus, is he a sneaky hidden Canadian?

1112
00:57:19,960 --> 00:57:22,080
I'm not sure why he got upset.

1113
00:57:22,080 --> 00:57:24,400
Enjoying his Tim Hortons and not sharing it.

1114
00:57:24,400 --> 00:57:25,400
Yes.

1115
00:57:25,400 --> 00:57:26,400
I wonder.

1116
00:57:26,400 --> 00:57:27,400
All right.

1117
00:57:27,400 --> 00:57:28,960
We're going to round out our last couple of boosts.

1118
00:57:28,960 --> 00:57:31,320
This one is also a row of ducks.

1119
00:57:31,320 --> 00:57:33,800
Things are looking up for old duck.

1120
00:57:33,800 --> 00:57:36,260
This row of ducks came in from Purple Dog.

1121
00:57:36,260 --> 00:57:37,680
My car is eight years old.

1122
00:57:37,680 --> 00:57:40,220
My phone gets updates three to five years at best.

1123
00:57:40,220 --> 00:57:44,320
I just want open standards in any device that can implement it.

1124
00:57:44,320 --> 00:57:50,160
So this is something I wonder if there's going to become a DIY community around electric

1125
00:57:50,160 --> 00:57:51,160
cars.

1126
00:57:51,160 --> 00:57:52,160
I don't know if you see it.

1127
00:57:52,160 --> 00:57:53,880
There's YouTube channels that build their own electric cars.

1128
00:57:53,880 --> 00:57:59,920
But electric cars are a lot less complicated than a gas or a diesel vehicle.

1129
00:57:59,920 --> 00:58:04,360
You know, you can get a couple of electric motors, a battery pack, they can be platforms

1130
00:58:04,360 --> 00:58:06,480
that get sold as kits.

1131
00:58:06,480 --> 00:58:13,340
It really feels like cars are turning into the next geeky tech landscape.

1132
00:58:13,340 --> 00:58:19,000
My buddy Alex on Self Hosted bought this equipment that he hooks up to the ODB two port on his

1133
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:20,400
golf.

1134
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:25,680
And now he can adjust things like the noise and sounds that his exhaust makes.

1135
00:58:25,680 --> 00:58:31,120
He can tweak things, he was able to get astronomical increase in horsepower just by adjusting things

1136
00:58:31,120 --> 00:58:32,120
in software.

1137
00:58:32,120 --> 00:58:34,740
And then you eventually need to replace components to accommodate for it.

1138
00:58:34,740 --> 00:58:41,640
But all of it is just tunable as different software profiles because the platform that

1139
00:58:41,640 --> 00:58:48,240
that Golf R is built on is also used in Audis and they have that same engine in a van and

1140
00:58:48,240 --> 00:58:50,480
they have that same engine in a Passat.

1141
00:58:50,480 --> 00:58:53,480
And they just use it in these different vehicles.

1142
00:58:53,480 --> 00:58:56,760
They swap out some of the components, maybe some things are a little more robust than

1143
00:58:56,760 --> 00:58:59,960
other parts, and they put a different software stack on there.

1144
00:58:59,960 --> 00:59:05,000
And he got that software stack and he put it on his Golf R and he got a huge increase

1145
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:06,560
in horsepower.

1146
00:59:06,560 --> 00:59:08,920
And it's just, you know, it's a tinkerer's thing.

1147
00:59:08,920 --> 00:59:12,520
It's a whole community around tinkering and messing with this stuff.

1148
00:59:12,520 --> 00:59:13,520
I find that interesting.

1149
00:59:13,520 --> 00:59:15,320
Yeah, I think that could happen, right?

1150
00:59:15,320 --> 00:59:18,680
There's always been a kind of a car enthusiast community, so why not?

1151
00:59:18,680 --> 00:59:19,680
I like it.

1152
00:59:19,680 --> 00:59:20,680
Yeah.

1153
00:59:20,680 --> 00:59:21,680
I hope it sticks.

1154
00:59:21,680 --> 00:59:22,680
Neve Boostin with 2008Sats.

1155
00:59:22,680 --> 00:59:23,680
BOOST!

1156
00:59:23,680 --> 00:59:31,080
In 2008, did you know that the number three search term on Google was, what is Java, behind

1157
00:59:31,080 --> 00:59:34,360
financial crisis and then who is Obama?

1158
00:59:34,360 --> 00:59:37,320
Oh, how far the world has come.

1159
00:59:37,320 --> 00:59:43,520
Always Mike as a guy's, uh, eos, eos, what's eos, is that a magic thing?

1160
00:59:43,520 --> 00:59:44,520
Oh God.

1161
00:59:44,520 --> 00:59:51,280
Is this e h o s as a guy, he was, no, maybe it just means that as a guy, your ethos has

1162
00:59:51,280 --> 00:59:53,200
fallen in love with common Lisp and Lua.

1163
00:59:53,200 --> 00:59:54,200
Oh no.

1164
00:59:54,200 --> 00:59:55,200
Oh my God.

1165
00:59:55,200 --> 00:59:58,200
Neve says he has a dedicated Emacs machine.

1166
00:59:58,200 --> 00:59:59,680
Could you think about that?

1167
00:59:59,680 --> 01:00:04,580
A computer in your room that only runs Emacs.

1168
01:00:04,580 --> 01:00:06,120
Is this a thing people are doing?

1169
01:00:06,120 --> 01:00:11,520
Does anybody else out there have a computer that only does one thing and is it a full

1170
01:00:11,520 --> 01:00:12,520
computer?

1171
01:00:12,520 --> 01:00:14,800
I don't know about you and Emacs people, how they're running Emacs.

1172
01:00:14,800 --> 01:00:15,800
No, no.

1173
01:00:15,800 --> 01:00:19,200
I'm wondering, like, do some people have like a machine that does something else, like a

1174
01:00:19,200 --> 01:00:22,000
dedicated computer that just runs a single application?

1175
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:23,000
Oh yeah, dude.

1176
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:26,080
What about all the, all the, uh, all the Plex people, right?

1177
01:00:26,080 --> 01:00:27,080
Yeah.

1178
01:00:27,080 --> 01:00:30,280
Well maybe a media server or something, but I'm talking like a PC or something.

1179
01:00:30,280 --> 01:00:34,320
Maybe it, I mean, maybe Neve's doing a tablet, but I'm just trying to picture like a desktop

1180
01:00:34,320 --> 01:00:40,560
PC with a mouse and a keyboard and a screen, a tower PC that's just running all the time,

1181
01:00:40,560 --> 01:00:42,020
but nothing but Emacs.

1182
01:00:42,020 --> 01:00:44,040
You can live in Emacs.

1183
01:00:44,040 --> 01:00:47,480
I'm just, Neve is blowing my mind.

1184
01:00:47,480 --> 01:00:49,160
Also yes, we're out your neck beard.

1185
01:00:49,160 --> 01:00:50,160
Yeah, absolutely.

1186
01:00:50,160 --> 01:00:51,160
Yeah.

1187
01:00:51,160 --> 01:00:52,160
Yeah.

1188
01:00:52,160 --> 01:00:53,160
Just thank you.

1189
01:00:53,160 --> 01:00:55,400
We got 20,000 SATs from Mitch.

1190
01:00:55,400 --> 01:00:57,680
That's the developer of the Podverse app.

1191
01:00:57,680 --> 01:01:03,640
Podverse is an open source GPL podcasting 2.0 compatible app for Android, Mac, Linux,

1192
01:01:03,640 --> 01:01:04,640
iOS.

1193
01:01:04,640 --> 01:01:09,440
Well, I say Mac, I meant iOS and the web.

1194
01:01:09,440 --> 01:01:10,440
Try it out.

1195
01:01:10,440 --> 01:01:11,440
It's great.

1196
01:01:11,440 --> 01:01:16,440
We got 48 SATs from R30s and thank you everybody else who boosted in or streamed in.

1197
01:01:16,440 --> 01:01:17,540
We didn't make it on the show.

1198
01:01:17,540 --> 01:01:21,640
We do just select some of them, but we read all of them and I'm working eventually.

1199
01:01:21,640 --> 01:01:26,400
We have a couple of projects in the pipeline, but we will eventually probably pipe in the

1200
01:01:26,400 --> 01:01:30,360
boost for Coder like into a Slack channel or something so they're even easier for everybody

1201
01:01:30,360 --> 01:01:31,360
to see.

1202
01:01:31,360 --> 01:01:32,360
But we'll work on that.

1203
01:01:32,360 --> 01:01:33,360
It's actually pretty awesome.

1204
01:01:33,360 --> 01:01:35,660
Dave Jones is a master.

1205
01:01:35,660 --> 01:01:36,880
I love the system he built.

1206
01:01:36,880 --> 01:01:41,840
Like I don't know if he intended to build the perfect system for us, but he created

1207
01:01:41,840 --> 01:01:48,640
like a rust back end for these boosts that get stored in a database and there's an API.

1208
01:01:48,640 --> 01:01:50,280
It's really quite choice.

1209
01:01:50,280 --> 01:01:56,320
So we're going to leverage that to send the boosts programmatically to different team members

1210
01:01:56,320 --> 01:01:59,700
based on like what show they participate in and all that kind of stuff.

1211
01:01:59,700 --> 01:02:02,000
It's coming one day down the road.

1212
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:07,380
We're also working on a special members channel for our Coder QA team.

1213
01:02:07,380 --> 01:02:11,620
So they'll have a way to send in special messages and we're working on, although this is all

1214
01:02:11,620 --> 01:02:12,620
really early.

1215
01:02:12,620 --> 01:02:15,400
So you're going to hear me talk about this stuff for a while, but we're working on ways

1216
01:02:15,400 --> 01:02:20,760
to upgrade the member feeds with new podcasting 2.0 features as well.

1217
01:02:20,760 --> 01:02:21,760
It's very exciting.

1218
01:02:21,760 --> 01:02:22,760
It's a lot of work.

1219
01:02:22,760 --> 01:02:26,180
It's some big changes for us, but it's all in the pipeline.

1220
01:02:26,180 --> 01:02:30,680
So you can become a member at coderqa.co you'll get the Coderly report when we record it soon.

1221
01:02:30,680 --> 01:02:34,160
It'll be, it'll be slightly delayed this quarter, but we will get it out to you.

1222
01:02:34,160 --> 01:02:37,200
I've been trying to brainstorm on a topic too.

1223
01:02:37,200 --> 01:02:41,200
So I'll chat with you about that offline so I got an idea, but Mr. Dominic, is there anywhere

1224
01:02:41,200 --> 01:02:42,680
you want to send the people this week?

1225
01:02:42,680 --> 01:02:50,400
I'm at Twitter at Domenico and go to alice.dev if you need any automation or data conversion

1226
01:02:50,400 --> 01:02:51,400
goodness.

1227
01:02:51,400 --> 01:02:52,400
Absolutely.

1228
01:02:52,400 --> 01:02:53,600
You can join the show live.

1229
01:02:53,600 --> 01:02:58,600
We do it on Mondays at 9 a.m. Pacific noon Eastern over at Jupiter.tube.

1230
01:02:58,600 --> 01:03:02,840
Thanks to what we talked about today or coder.show slash four eight nine, you'll find our feed

1231
01:03:02,840 --> 01:03:03,840
over there.

1232
01:03:03,840 --> 01:03:04,840
That's also our contact page.

1233
01:03:04,840 --> 01:03:07,960
If you want to send an email into the show, we do appreciate and read all of those as

1234
01:03:07,960 --> 01:03:08,960
well.

1235
01:03:08,960 --> 01:03:14,240
And then last but not least, I suppose you could follow the show on the Twitter or something.

1236
01:03:14,240 --> 01:03:15,240
I don't know.

1237
01:03:15,240 --> 01:03:19,120
You could, then, you know, when it's out at Coda radio show, what I would do is I just

1238
01:03:19,120 --> 01:03:22,600
subscribe in a podcast app, then you don't need to follow us on Twitter and you still

1239
01:03:22,600 --> 01:03:23,960
know when it's out.

1240
01:03:23,960 --> 01:03:26,320
That's I'm a podcast pro.

1241
01:03:26,320 --> 01:03:27,320
So that's a pro tip.

1242
01:03:27,320 --> 01:03:28,320
All right, everyone.

1243
01:03:28,320 --> 01:03:31,640
Thank you so much for joining us on this week's episode of the Coda radio program.

1244
01:03:31,640 --> 01:03:58,720
And we'll see you right back here next week.
