00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,640
This is KOTOR Radio, episode 470, recorded June 9th, 2022.

2
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:20,200
Hello friends and welcome into Jupiter Broadcasting's weekly talk show, taking a pragmatic look

3
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:25,480
at the art and the business of software development and the world of technology.

4
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:31,240
My name is Chris and joining us in his podcasting position, it's our host, Mr. Dominic.

5
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:32,240
Hello Mike.

6
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:33,240
You're here.

7
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:35,000
Yes, you are.

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
You are.

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,120
And honestly, that's 80% of the battle, my friend, maybe even 85.

10
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:41,120
You know what I mean?

11
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:43,280
That's what I'm sticking with right now.

12
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:49,960
I sometimes overdo it and I'm in denial about overdoing it until my health starts to fail

13
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:53,040
and then I zoom out and go, oh, I did it again.

14
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:55,400
You know, I did it again.

15
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:57,840
Boy, I am so damn busy and I've been thinking about it.

16
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:58,840
Why is it?

17
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:04,400
As a podcaster, you know, why is the guy who's doing podcasts, why am I so effing busy and

18
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:09,840
I just keep getting busier and I have ways of gauging this, like, you know, when like

19
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:14,440
you got emails in your inbox that are like about sales and closing a sale, but you just

20
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:17,520
like haven't gotten to it for a week because you just haven't gotten a chance to get to

21
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:18,520
your email.

22
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:22,680
It's kind of weeks, weeks, I'm having weeks of that right now.

23
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:26,560
And it's like, I thought when I restarted the indie thing, I'd take all these things

24
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:32,240
I learned and I'd avoid this problem all together again, you know, I'll do better this time.

25
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:33,240
No, it's way worse.

26
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:34,240
It's way worse.

27
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:35,240
This time will be different.

28
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:36,240
No, it's worse.

29
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:37,240
And you know what I realized?

30
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:42,720
A, I went from having a big team to a real small team, but B, I repeated a critical mistake

31
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:45,160
that I made last time, an absolute critical mistake.

32
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:49,000
And this is a bit of wisdom I want to pass on to people out there thinking about starting

33
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,720
a side hustle or doing their own gig, only do one job.

34
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:57,440
I didn't realize it, but I gave myself two jobs.

35
00:01:57,440 --> 00:02:03,800
We got a whole slate of shows over at jupiterbroadcasting.com and that running those shows and creating content

36
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:07,880
and going through and all the follow-up that it requires, all of the work that, you know,

37
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:11,420
when you have four or five shows, that's more than a full-time job, my friends.

38
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:16,140
But then the other thing I did because I was the best candidate for it is I'm also the

39
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:18,240
ad sales guy, right?

40
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:20,340
I'm the one that communicates with the sponsors.

41
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:24,720
I go out there and essentially with ad sales, you're always selling because you're always,

42
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:27,400
these deals take sometimes six months to line up.

43
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:30,860
You're always following up your every, you know, every opportunity you get, you're jumping

44
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:33,000
onto a video call or doing a meeting.

45
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,660
You're always replying to questions or modifications.

46
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:38,260
It's a full-time job itself.

47
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:42,880
And both of them never end, right?

48
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:46,080
There's always a show within a couple of hours that within a few hours that needs to start,

49
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,660
I need to start working on.

50
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:50,380
I always have to be working on the sponsor stuff, always.

51
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:54,500
Because if you stop, then like three, four, five months down the road, all revenue stops

52
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:55,500
coming in.

53
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:57,300
It's like, it's bad, right?

54
00:02:57,300 --> 00:03:02,260
And so, I think it's a super common mistake in new media that a lot of people that start

55
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:05,060
their own new media company think it's a really common mistake.

56
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:08,380
And then I think what happens is most of them burn out.

57
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:10,520
Like they don't make it 15 years, right?

58
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:13,940
They make it five, 10 years at most, and then they burn out.

59
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:18,580
But I just keep going because I'm in denial about it until I like look around and see

60
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:22,380
like all the rubble around me of things that I have failed to do or forgotten about or

61
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:23,380
didn't get to.

62
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:25,100
And I'm like, oh, I've done it again.

63
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:28,420
And then I start realizing, oh, my health's kind of, I'm kind of falling apart.

64
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:29,420
What's going on?

65
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:31,820
Oh, I'm such an idiot.

66
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:37,340
And I can't believe I find myself here like almost once a quarter at this rate.

67
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:42,000
It's so frustrating because I'm just so helpless apparently.

68
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,420
Do you just, you know what I'm looking?

69
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:46,500
I'm looking just to just tell me you struggle like this, too.

70
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:47,500
I just need to know.

71
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:48,500
I need to know.

72
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:49,500
It's not just me.

73
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:54,220
Between, you know, IT infrastructure, dev, sales, I mean, I don't I don't know how you

74
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:56,300
avoid not having two or three hats, though.

75
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:57,300
Right.

76
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:58,300
Because there's the whole infrastructure side of things, too.

77
00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:00,300
Thank God I get help from Wes on that.

78
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:03,140
And Alex, you know, Alex has been really helpful there, too.

79
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:04,260
Those guys are great.

80
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:05,900
But yeah, there's a lot there.

81
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:11,260
So just my bit of wisdom that I am my lesson I have learned from this is when you're creating

82
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:17,500
a job for yourself, try to give yourself just one job and then try to delegate all that

83
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:18,500
stuff you can.

84
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:20,460
It's really hard depending on the niche you're in.

85
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:22,580
Sometimes there isn't the revenue to delegate.

86
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:24,100
That's always the number one feedback that always comes in.

87
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:26,580
Oh, Chris, you just need to learn to delegate.

88
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:27,580
All right.

89
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:33,660
Well, send that with a with a hundred thousand dollar boost and I'll hire somebody not delegate

90
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:35,460
in the meantime.

91
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:37,180
I'm going to have to figure it out on my own.

92
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:42,180
Well, we got we got a bunch of feedback, people who are working in remote virtual desktops,

93
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:45,180
something you and I brought up recently on the show.

94
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:47,300
And I wanted to get to some of this.

95
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:48,300
Alex Gates wrote in.

96
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:54,140
He said, my last gig, we configured a medium sized Azure virtual desktop environment and

97
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:56,260
it was really good.

98
00:04:56,260 --> 00:04:58,540
Anyone that got it pretty much ditched their laptops.

99
00:04:58,540 --> 00:05:03,340
This is primarily because limitations for budgets on new hardware, of course.

100
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:07,740
Big, crappy company laptops over a powerful remote system.

101
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:08,860
That makes sense.

102
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:14,480
The virtual desktops are all RDP based, like I imagine most dev boxes would be.

103
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:17,740
They did end up having a lot of engineers using the environment with 3D accelerated

104
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:20,280
CAD setups even.

105
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:24,620
In a gig like that, I take a virtual remote desktop over a local one any day of the week,

106
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:28,380
assuming it was on an RDP based system.

107
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:33,140
And that actually seems to be surprisingly the maker or breaker is what is the what is

108
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:35,100
the remote connection protocol being used?

109
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:38,400
Citrix and RDP seem to be the favorite of the audience, and then it kind of goes downhill

110
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:39,500
from there.

111
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:43,820
And that just can make all the difference with the latency of the connection.

112
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:45,740
Kind of on the same line.

113
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:51,740
Patias shared the joys and the sorrows of running their dev environment on the Google

114
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:52,740
cloud infrastructure.

115
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:59,220
They write, I'm a dev ops person for a web hosting company here, and I got some sorrows

116
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:02,860
and some joys of remote VMs, the joys.

117
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:06,540
I have easy access to support developers and see what they are seeing in real time and

118
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:10,780
deploy the same automation on the same OS as our staging and prod environments.

119
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:12,060
All right.

120
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:13,140
I've done remote support.

121
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:15,860
I acknowledge remote supports way better there.

122
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:17,140
And the staging stuff.

123
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:21,700
This again, I think, is an area that comes up where people want something they can easily

124
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:24,340
stage, easily deploy to all the developers.

125
00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:26,340
The biggest issue is resource consumption.

126
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:32,700
VSCode has a bunch of useful extensions like Live Share and IntelliSense and our devs love

127
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:33,700
it.

128
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:37,980
But sometimes it can use one gig of RAM for each remote session.

129
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:41,600
So resource consumption issues can also run us out of memory.

130
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,340
That can be a problem, though.

131
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:47,780
This seems like a common issue with any sort of virtual desktop environment, at least ones

132
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:48,780
that I've run into.

133
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:51,700
We're planning on moving back to local dev environment based on Docker, but that will

134
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:55,060
also mean another platform that needs to be maintained since we need to replicate any

135
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:58,260
changes from our current VM and Ansible based setup in Docker.

136
00:06:58,260 --> 00:06:59,740
There you go.

137
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:03,900
I mean, that was really, I think, the highlights of it.

138
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:06,240
We got a note too from Summer Evans.

139
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,580
They love the remote setup.

140
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:13,560
They say, when the pandemic started, I was working as a.NET developer at a Windows desktop.

141
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:15,940
We weren't allowed to bring home our desktop computers.

142
00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:18,900
So I ended up remoting into my desktop.

143
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:20,380
It was horrible at first because of bad internet.

144
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:24,260
But now that that's been fixed, I work at a company where I work on open source now.

145
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:27,860
And I have a VPS set up on my own with TMUX and a remote in there for most of my daily

146
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:28,860
work.

147
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:29,860
I like it a lot.

148
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:32,780
I can switch between computers quickly and resume my work at TMUX is way more lightweight

149
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:33,780
than anything graphical.

150
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:34,780
I see.

151
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:38,020
I wonder how that holds up if the internet connection is crappy.

152
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:41,180
That's definitely where it goes sideways, huh?

153
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:42,180
Yeah.

154
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:45,980
So that's getting better, especially, you know, a lot of home connections are wired.

155
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:46,980
I don't know.

156
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:47,980
Right.

157
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:48,980
I mean, have you ever heard of Comcast?

158
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:49,980
Oh, yeah.

159
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:51,540
No, I mean, we know.

160
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:53,580
We know just doing this show for years.

161
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:58,180
There's some days where things are just bad and there's nothing you can do about it.

162
00:07:58,180 --> 00:08:01,560
Squirrely Dave wrote in to say that he works in Citrix when remote.

163
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:06,540
And then when he goes into the office, they issue him a Chromebook, which he says, I mean,

164
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:10,940
that's fine because, quote, I don't actually get any work done in the office.

165
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:12,340
I mean, but I like it.

166
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:13,340
It was a jab at you.

167
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:14,340
It totally was.

168
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:15,780
It was right on the chin.

169
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:16,780
Right.

170
00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:17,780
Yeah.

171
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:19,900
We got more feedback and we'd love to collect some more.

172
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:22,300
We're recording another episode on Monday in our regular time.

173
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:28,260
We're doing a special recording right now, a special.

174
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:29,260
That's right.

175
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:33,160
Coder on a Thursday because we're getting ready for some travel.

176
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:35,940
So some extra feedback would be great.

177
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:41,060
Go over to Coder dot show slash contact or grab a new podcasting app and send us in a

178
00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:42,060
boost.

179
00:08:42,060 --> 00:08:46,600
A quick mention about the London meetup coming up in August.

180
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:48,140
There's been a day change.

181
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:52,060
So be sure you're going to meet up dot com slash Jupiter Broadcasting and you've joined

182
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:53,060
the meetups.

183
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:55,800
That way, you know all the deets because there are some flight changes.

184
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:57,380
So there's a slight day change.

185
00:08:57,380 --> 00:09:01,660
Everything's over at meetup dot com slash Jupiter Broadcasting because, yes, Alex from

186
00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:07,300
self-hosted will be in London in August and there is a meetup getting organized.

187
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:08,300
Mike and I won't be there.

188
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:10,260
Well, at least not this time.

189
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:17,380
But when we land that big Ford EV sponsorship and we got, you know, big Ford money, maybe

190
00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:18,380
we'll go do a show in London.

191
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:19,780
I got that big Ford energy.

192
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:20,780
I like it.

193
00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:24,060
I like it.

194
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:29,700
Tail scale dot com slash code or go there to get a free account up to 20 devices.

195
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:32,020
I love tail scale.

196
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:37,980
It is a zero config VPN installs on any device in minutes and not a week goes by where I

197
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:42,260
don't see multiple community members lives change because of tail scale.

198
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:46,060
Not exaggerating happened this morning before I sat down to record.

199
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:47,980
Maybe that's why I'm super hyped right now.

200
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:52,120
A great conversation our telegram group about a user who was transitioning from a really

201
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:58,740
kind of brittle open VPN setup to tail scale and then using ACLs and exit nodes to really

202
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:00,780
complete the picture for them.

203
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:01,780
It's so great.

204
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:06,060
You see, devices connect directly to each other using WireGuard's noise protocol encryption.

205
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:09,600
You build a mesh VPN network powered by WireGuard.

206
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:13,820
You can quickly create secure ACLs to to share one machine with somebody.

207
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:15,340
It'll bust through carrier grade net.

208
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:17,500
I can attest to that.

209
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:22,260
I have been in like I'm not even kidding, like triple net deep and tail scale still

210
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:23,300
works.

211
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:26,340
That's how I keep all my family's computers connected so I can do remote support when

212
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:28,300
my kids aren't at home with me.

213
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:31,620
It's super handy for getting into my work systems, prepping for a show when I'm on the

214
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:34,180
road and you'll get it running on just about any.

215
00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:35,180
I've got it on Raspberry Pi.

216
00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:36,180
I got it on my iPhone.

217
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:37,180
I got it on an iPad.

218
00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:38,620
I got it on my Linux boxes.

219
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:40,980
It's part of my basic NixOS configuration.

220
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:44,820
Now when I deploy a NixOS box, it deploys with tail scale.

221
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:45,820
Seriously.

222
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:53,000
So go try it for yourself for free up to 20 machines at tailscale.com slash coder.

223
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,060
This is the modern way to do VPNs.

224
00:10:56,060 --> 00:11:00,180
Every other VPN I've ever used feels so old after I've switched to tail scale.

225
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:06,700
Go try it for yourself, tailscale.com slash coder.

226
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:12,980
Well I got my HP dev one since we gathered together last time and I know you've been

227
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:17,720
going all in using it as your daily driver since we last chatted.

228
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:19,940
I think this is worth talking about more.

229
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:25,100
In fact, I think this is going to be a big topic of conversation in the Linux community

230
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:26,420
over the next few weeks.

231
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:29,620
Yeah, I think so too.

232
00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:30,620
You go first.

233
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:33,700
I've been waiting for your feedback and you have been quite the tease.

234
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:35,580
I have been saving it for the show.

235
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:36,580
You coquettish bastard.

236
00:11:36,580 --> 00:11:37,580
Sorry.

237
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:43,300
I just wanted to kind of get your live reactions out there.

238
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:44,300
Capture it raw.

239
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:52,900
I feel like this is potentially a laptop that is going to fill a very critical space in

240
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:54,760
the Linux ecosystem.

241
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:59,580
So traditionally, I can tell you that we have been lacking just something very simple.

242
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:04,580
When somebody comes and says, hey, I'd like a great laptop to run Linux, what do you recommend?

243
00:12:04,580 --> 00:12:07,820
You have to need a chart of are they a ThinkPad person potentially?

244
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:09,380
Are they going to be an XPS person?

245
00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:12,060
Should we be sending them to system 76?

246
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:15,760
There's all of these potential avenues you could go down and you have to ask them all

247
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:16,760
of these questions.

248
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:21,780
And there's not just a go to this website and order this configuration.

249
00:12:21,780 --> 00:12:24,500
And that is exactly how it is on the MacBook world.

250
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:29,300
Pretty much anybody could go buy a MacBook Air M2 now, whatever model they want, even

251
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:33,660
the base model, and it's going to be good enough for 90 percent of people out there.

252
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:35,540
We haven't had that in Linux.

253
00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:37,460
We've had all of these variables.

254
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:42,300
And so I have felt for a long time that Dell was so close to cinching that if Dell just

255
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:49,140
made it a little bit more discoverable, a little simpler, a little less of a Dell experience

256
00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:55,060
to get the XPS, and if they just kind of leaned into it a bit more instead of kind of fade

257
00:12:55,060 --> 00:13:03,020
like they seem to be, the XPS could have really kind of grabbed that Linux king crown of laptops.

258
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:07,540
In fact, today as we record a brand new XPS 13 has just been announced, not the Linux

259
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:12,420
edition, but a new XPS 13 that Linux edition will probably be based on at some point in

260
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:13,420
the future.

261
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:17,540
That's been announced and it's more in a direction I'm not a huge fan of.

262
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:21,540
I mean, it has a new Intel processor in there, it has a smaller motherboard, it has better

263
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:22,540
battery life.

264
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:28,980
Those things are good, but it has one USB-C port on each side, two USB-C ports total.

265
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:32,460
It has a butterfly style chiclet keyboard, right?

266
00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:39,620
It's going the wrong direction in other areas and it's also based around an Intel platform,

267
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:43,700
which for some of us there's just less enthusiasm about these days.

268
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:48,720
So it just kind of wasn't quite getting that king status.

269
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:52,460
And you'd really like it to be a piece of hardware that comes from a tier one OEM vendor

270
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:57,860
that can ship, that has scale, that has deep supply chain connections, that kind of stuff,

271
00:13:57,860 --> 00:14:00,020
especially these days.

272
00:14:00,020 --> 00:14:06,900
And the HP Dev 1, I think is the best candidate for the king of Linux laptops crown that we

273
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:09,740
have seen in a long time.

274
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:12,500
And it just took them getting the formula right.

275
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:15,980
You can tell where they decided to take risks and you can tell where they decided not to

276
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:17,100
take risks.

277
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:21,980
And the risk that they decided to take here was to make a Linux focused laptop.

278
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:26,140
And then they didn't take a lot of risks with the hardware design.

279
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:30,020
It's not really anything exceptional, but it's also not below anything you'd expect.

280
00:14:30,020 --> 00:14:33,100
It kind of just got it right there in the middle with the hardware design.

281
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:34,100
Do you agree with that?

282
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:36,580
Yeah, I think it's good.

283
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:40,980
It's definitely, if you're looking for like a wafer thin MacBook Air, this is probably

284
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:46,180
not for you, but if you're looking for a more practical is the word that comes to mind.

285
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:48,780
With a slightly better design look than say like a ThinkPad, right?

286
00:14:48,780 --> 00:14:53,100
It's got that magnesium alloy chassis, which at first I thought might be plastic.

287
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:54,580
I couldn't tell because it was so light.

288
00:14:54,580 --> 00:14:56,380
I actually thought it was plastic.

289
00:14:56,380 --> 00:15:00,660
So then it really kind of came down to how does it work for me?

290
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:04,820
And I'm still planning to throw like a bunch of synthetic benchmarks at it and a lot of

291
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:06,540
scenarios which I haven't done yet.

292
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:11,140
And I haven't still gotten a good grasp of its battery life capacity.

293
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:18,340
But I do feel like I have a very good grasp on how it works for my kind of maximum workload

294
00:15:18,340 --> 00:15:19,340
scenario.

295
00:15:19,340 --> 00:15:24,940
It's like when I sit down and I set up a laptop for the first time after I've reloaded it,

296
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:30,580
I will have Steam downloading and installing a game in the background while I have apt

297
00:15:30,580 --> 00:15:38,180
or whatever DNF whatever installing packages while I also have flat pack installing like

298
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:43,380
30 packages and I will have all of this going while I'm also browsing the web, probably

299
00:15:43,380 --> 00:15:44,580
watching some YouTube.

300
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:46,260
I have a matrix chat open.

301
00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:47,260
Absolutely.

302
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:48,260
I have telegram open.

303
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:49,260
Absolutely.

304
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:50,620
Probably have slack open as well.

305
00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:55,020
I probably three or four desktops virtual desktops deep while I'm doing this or I'm

306
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:56,020
doing all that.

307
00:15:56,020 --> 00:16:03,220
If I'm not downloading a Steam game, I'm precaching the shaders for like, you know, the performance.

308
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:04,220
That's generally how I work.

309
00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:07,580
It's a very ADD style where I have a lot of things going on at once.

310
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:12,140
And so if I can install a flat pack and a dead package at the same time, I will.

311
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:17,740
And why not during all of that, which I was doing for a solid three, four hours, the fans

312
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:22,780
never kicked up that typically almost that just never happens on a Linux laptop.

313
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:28,940
Even during the precaching of the shaders for my games, the fans did not kick up.

314
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:30,780
The performance never lagged.

315
00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:33,020
It never it never missed a beat.

316
00:16:33,020 --> 00:16:34,060
I was very impressed.

317
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:40,020
The only time I heard the fans actually go on was when the game finally started.

318
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:45,140
Even then, the speakers are so damn good that it was absolutely no issue.

319
00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:49,580
And even with the fans going, it's still quieter than every other laptop I have once the fans

320
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:56,420
kick up that maybe maybe aside from the MacBook when when I had that experience.

321
00:16:56,420 --> 00:17:01,100
I started getting a little more serious about the laptop because I was like, OK, I just

322
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:06,420
threw a lot at this and then it loaded my frickin video game.

323
00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:09,420
And then I played my video game on this thing.

324
00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:12,500
That's a big deal, because if I've got a thousand bucks to spend, if I've got twelve hundred

325
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:15,840
bucks to spend, I game very rarely.

326
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:18,440
But when I do game, I want to be able to do that.

327
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:20,240
And that's getting better and better on Linux than ever.

328
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:26,380
In fact, it's an area where the Linux desktop is significantly more competitive than the

329
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:27,680
Mac desktop.

330
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:32,820
And so that's an area where if I'm going to have a Linux box, I want to be able to play

331
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:34,340
video games.

332
00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:37,660
But on my ThinkPad, where it's all an Intel configuration, the Intel graphics are just

333
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:38,840
not powerful enough.

334
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:43,540
And on other systems where I have a Intel and Nvidia, it's a real pain in the neck to

335
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:44,540
manage that.

336
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:48,900
And it makes it harder to flip between distributions like a maniac.

337
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:55,220
This it strikes that balance because that built in integrated AMD GPU is good enough

338
00:17:55,220 --> 00:18:02,260
that I was playing Halo last night on it and it was totally playable.

339
00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:03,300
How new for you, though?

340
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:04,300
Let's get to the heart of them.

341
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:07,240
Oh, I haven't played Halo since like the early Xbox days, man.

342
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:08,620
So it was rough.

343
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:10,300
Yeah, I tried.

344
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:12,020
I tried some infinity myself.

345
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:14,780
It wasn't a good idea.

346
00:18:14,780 --> 00:18:20,420
The other game that I threw at it, which is always very complex, and it sort of it murders

347
00:18:20,420 --> 00:18:26,380
every other system I have, unfortunately, for whatever reason, is Star Trek Online.

348
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:29,540
It's not even that new of a game, but maybe it's just not super optimized.

349
00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:32,380
Star Trek Online, say you.

350
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:33,380
Mm hmm.

351
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:34,940
So like a 10 year old MMO.

352
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:38,860
Okay, I was thinking, what was I thinking, Stowe?

353
00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:39,860
Yeah, it's Stowe.

354
00:18:39,860 --> 00:18:40,860
Yeah.

355
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:41,860
Yep.

356
00:18:41,860 --> 00:18:42,860
Yeah.

357
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:43,860
You know, they've they've kept it going.

358
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:44,860
It's there still.

359
00:18:44,860 --> 00:18:45,860
It's still going, man.

360
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:48,260
And so I loaded it on there, which I have.

361
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:53,500
I have legitimately like 10 years of experience of getting this game working on Linux.

362
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:56,260
So it's like a great test for me in that regard.

363
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:58,140
It's so frickin flawless now.

364
00:18:58,140 --> 00:19:06,180
And I'm not a big, big gamer, obviously, but I absolutely felt like this laptop would accomplish

365
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:10,620
all of my gaming needs, which is a nice box to check for this thing.

366
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:15,300
And on top of that, I feel like this is not like a blow away trackpad, but it's an above

367
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:16,300
average trackpad.

368
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:20,520
It's better than probably every other trackpad out there on on a Linux machine.

369
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:23,900
This probably has the best speakers of any Linux laptop shipping today.

370
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:26,140
What was your impression of the speakers?

371
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:30,700
So I was surprised that I could easily do slack and zoom calls such as the one we were

372
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:36,220
on, which some pro plugged the show because, you know, you got to have that going without

373
00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:40,020
like a headset or mic or anything, and it was pretty good.

374
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:45,220
You know, I start off iffy and then I fell in love with the machine until I might as

375
00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:47,140
getting sent back for a replacement.

376
00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:48,860
Oh, oh, yes.

377
00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:49,980
So tell us what happened there.

378
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:53,180
The USBC charging has just stopped working.

379
00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:59,300
So after a good hustle by the system, 76 people to try to figure out, you know, what was the

380
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:03,900
software, it was concluded that it's actually a hardware issue.

381
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:05,760
Could have shorted out whatever.

382
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:09,620
So I will unfortunately be HP dev one list.

383
00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:14,380
I do have the review unit, but it's such a pain in the butt to kind of move into a whole

384
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:18,660
system just to have to wipe it, knowing that if I wait till like Monday or Tuesday, I'll

385
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:22,620
have another one, according to HP.

386
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:25,460
So super good support, though.

387
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:30,420
And other than that one issue, I would this was is going to be my daily driver once I

388
00:20:30,420 --> 00:20:31,940
have the repaired unit.

389
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:36,060
And the reason I care so much about the USBC, are we allowed to talk about that little meeting

390
00:20:36,060 --> 00:20:37,060
we were in or no?

391
00:20:37,060 --> 00:20:38,300
Yeah, I think we should mention it.

392
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:42,380
You and I were on a call with HP and system 76 where they're kind of giving us the background

393
00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:44,860
deets on how this all came together and whatnot.

394
00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:49,660
Yeah, one of the things I had mentioned was like, okay, so if it has USBC, and it has

395
00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:53,740
power over USBC, because at the time of the call, it was still working, it like died like

396
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:59,380
two hours later, theoretically, this could be kind of the ideal, you know, I'm just sometimes

397
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:02,900
your home, sometimes you're on the go, just plug in one cable, and you'll have your whole

398
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:04,380
workstation ready to go.

399
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:09,540
Yeah, that port that USBC port does do power delivery and display.

400
00:21:09,540 --> 00:21:12,720
So when that you know, when it works, you know, let's talk about this for a second.

401
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:16,260
So you know, when you're looking at this, what what makes this like a work machine?

402
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:18,940
Like is this a is this a viable ThinkPad competitor?

403
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:21,140
Is this a real work machine?

404
00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:24,140
And there, there's a couple things that we learned in that call.

405
00:21:24,140 --> 00:21:31,540
And that is is that system 76 and HP kind of have a ongoing contract of some kind, you

406
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:32,540
know, some relationship

407
00:21:32,540 --> 00:21:41,660
Yeah, and Carl, the CEO of system 76 in that call said that system 76 is doing quote, indefinite

408
00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:50,960
q&a on every pop OS, kernel release, every firmware release for the dev one, system 76

409
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:53,160
and HP are both doing q&a.

410
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:58,660
And then then they ship it upstream with just with with pop OS, just all other pop OS stuff.

411
00:21:58,660 --> 00:22:02,380
So there's not like a special repo or anything for the dev one users.

412
00:22:02,380 --> 00:22:08,660
But in that conversation, Carl said that the first couple of prototypes they got just arrived

413
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:13,940
as parts in a box, not even assembled, and that they actually assembled the first one

414
00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:17,660
that they got to play with themselves, they put it together, and they brought that up

415
00:22:17,660 --> 00:22:20,960
to mention it's you know, there's real serviceability here.

416
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:26,200
In fact, the the the HP laptop, the original HP laptop that this dev one is forked from

417
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:31,160
has a 10 out of 10 on the iFixit repairability score.

418
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:32,780
So these are things that I think about.

419
00:22:32,780 --> 00:22:37,140
If I'm thinking about a work machine, right, if I'm thinking about like, I'm thinking about

420
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:42,660
Brent, right, I'm thinking about Wes, I'm thinking about our our hosts like Mike and

421
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:43,660
like Alex.

422
00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:47,660
And I'm thinking about what if JB got to a point where when we start working with somebody

423
00:22:47,660 --> 00:22:52,420
just to make sure we had a really good setup, we just sent them a machine pre configured

424
00:22:52,420 --> 00:22:56,700
ready to go to connect in this is your podcast laptop.

425
00:22:56,700 --> 00:23:00,960
This would check those boxes for me, it would have the performance, it would have the noise

426
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:03,920
profile that I'm looking for in a machine I record with.

427
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:11,300
And it has the support HP has dedicated support staff just for the dev one line.

428
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:12,300
That's a big deal.

429
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:13,860
Like that's a real commitment from a company side.

430
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:18,160
And I'm curious what you picked up on this, but they won't come right out and say it obviously.

431
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:22,880
But I think they intend this to be like something iterating on like they do another dev one

432
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:27,800
in a year or so like this could be a multi product line kind of thing if this first one

433
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:28,800
is successful.

434
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:32,460
Yeah, I mean, I think you kind of tried to hold their feet to the fire a little bit.

435
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:39,660
I think in our call right where it's pretty clear that this is not a one time deal.

436
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:45,620
I'm curious if they stick with the AMD infrastructure there.

437
00:23:45,620 --> 00:23:50,540
It seems at least to my you know, off the cuff testing, it seems super fast.

438
00:23:50,540 --> 00:23:54,980
And that's just what the base 16 gigs of RAM I mean, I was playing XCOM and getting my

439
00:23:54,980 --> 00:24:00,980
ass handed to me just with fantastic fidelity, though.

440
00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:01,980
Again, this isn't a paid.

441
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:02,980
This is not again.

442
00:24:02,980 --> 00:24:03,980
Yeah.

443
00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:04,980
Nobody's paying us for this.

444
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:05,980
Nobody's paying us.

445
00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:06,980
Mike bought his own.

446
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:07,980
I literally Yeah, that's why.

447
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:08,980
That's why I can get a return.

448
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:12,900
And I'm you know, I will I will do the same if at the end of my review, which I think,

449
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:14,820
you know, I'm trending that way right now.

450
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:18,740
I haven't thrown like a lot of my media and coding jobs that I haven't done a lot of that

451
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:19,740
stuff yet.

452
00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:24,740
But one of the things that's giving me a pretty good sense that it's going to work out and

453
00:24:24,740 --> 00:24:29,420
another reason why I think this is a good work laptop is it's an open source driver

454
00:24:29,420 --> 00:24:30,980
stack in there.

455
00:24:30,980 --> 00:24:35,180
And ultimately, when it comes to Linux laptops, that's usually when things start getting a

456
00:24:35,180 --> 00:24:39,180
little buggy on you is somewhere in the driver stack, something isn't working.

457
00:24:39,180 --> 00:24:46,080
As Mike knows, as Mike has run into over the years, Mike is god damn you Qualcomm.

458
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:51,780
This is one of the reviews, one of the strangest ones I've ever done in that usually I fall

459
00:24:51,780 --> 00:24:57,380
in love when I open the box, because I'm easily bribed by stand ups of robot guys.

460
00:24:57,380 --> 00:25:01,460
But then I start to like see all the flaws, right, the fan kicks up, I get moody about

461
00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:04,780
it, I get a decimal reader, things like that.

462
00:25:04,780 --> 00:25:09,660
This one I was kind of like, okay, well, actually, is that not a plastic?

463
00:25:09,660 --> 00:25:11,880
The battery life is actually pretty good.

464
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:16,420
Look at it adjusting the screen based on the content on the screen to try to minimize battery

465
00:25:16,420 --> 00:25:20,380
usage, but keep the same relative level of brightness, which I don't know if you've noticed

466
00:25:20,380 --> 00:25:22,220
but it does that if you leave that on.

467
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:23,220
Yeah.

468
00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:24,220
And it's a hell of a screen too.

469
00:25:24,220 --> 00:25:29,340
I mean, Visual Studio Code still thinks I'm 16 and have like, you know, vampire vision.

470
00:25:29,340 --> 00:25:32,740
So I got to go got to do the command, whatever it is the command shift plus there that's

471
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:33,740
zoom in a little bit.

472
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:35,700
That's that's that's just VS code.

473
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:37,740
I have literally been working in it nonstop.

474
00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:44,100
In fact, I'm probably up until today when I you know, I wanted to like see was a software.

475
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:48,420
So I did the restore thing, you know, the boot into recovery restore.

476
00:25:48,420 --> 00:25:52,300
It's not software, but it's now wiped and ready to be returned.

477
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:53,300
Thousand Nits.

478
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:56,340
I ended up turning it down because it's stupidly bright.

479
00:25:56,340 --> 00:26:00,980
But when I'm sitting in Florida on my porch working and it's Florida, it's super nice

480
00:26:00,980 --> 00:26:04,180
to have it not be completely washed out.

481
00:26:04,180 --> 00:26:05,980
I do tons of video calls.

482
00:26:05,980 --> 00:26:09,520
I look like a potato, but that's not its fault.

483
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:14,300
If these AMD Ryzen chips keep going the way I think they're going, and if system 76 and

484
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:18,100
HP stick with that platform, this could be a super viable.

485
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:19,820
And I think it even is today.

486
00:26:19,820 --> 00:26:21,740
Superviable MacBook alternative.

487
00:26:21,740 --> 00:26:23,660
Plus you get all the games.

488
00:26:23,660 --> 00:26:24,660
And I mean, I'm not.

489
00:26:24,660 --> 00:26:25,660
All right.

490
00:26:25,660 --> 00:26:28,340
So like XCOM 76.

491
00:26:28,340 --> 00:26:31,480
I downloaded Age of Empires four, but didn't get to play it yet.

492
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:32,480
And Sonic Mania.

493
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:34,860
So I'm not like, you know.

494
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:36,420
Super gamer due to, you know.

495
00:26:36,420 --> 00:26:40,840
So I'm sure like for the serious newer stuff, you need the GPU.

496
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:45,900
But if you like indie games or just kind of puzzle or strategy games, this is just fine.

497
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:48,620
Also, did you try their insane mouse?

498
00:26:48,620 --> 00:26:49,620
Not yet.

499
00:26:49,620 --> 00:26:50,620
No.

500
00:26:50,620 --> 00:26:53,780
It downloaded the app, the mouse configurator.

501
00:26:53,780 --> 00:26:57,500
If you were like a real gamer, I have a feeling you could do all kinds of crazy.

502
00:26:57,500 --> 00:27:00,580
I don't know if this is still a thing, but like Starcraft macros.

503
00:27:00,580 --> 00:27:04,740
Yeah, it did seem like that mouse has support for essentially little mini macros.

504
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:09,300
Well, it has programmable, I forgot what they call them profiles or context, something like

505
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:14,100
that, in that app that was written by system 76 for that mouse on that machine.

506
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:15,100
Yeah.

507
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:16,100
It's an interesting bit.

508
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:18,820
So HP has decided to complete the picture of this.

509
00:27:18,820 --> 00:27:24,840
You can add a system 76 launch keyboard and their mouse, which they are they're actually

510
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:26,780
pretty proud of this mouse.

511
00:27:26,780 --> 00:27:30,940
They actually dedicate a little bit of their presentation to the mouse.

512
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:31,940
And you know what?

513
00:27:31,940 --> 00:27:34,740
After they talked about it, I was like, oh, oh, that's why that's why they like it so

514
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:35,740
much.

515
00:27:35,740 --> 00:27:39,220
They call it the HP 935 creator wireless mouse.

516
00:27:39,220 --> 00:27:43,160
It's an 80 dollar addition, but they boast 12 weeks of battery life.

517
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:46,660
It does a USB-A dongle or it'll do Bluetooth.

518
00:27:46,660 --> 00:27:49,500
Like Mike said, it has four different profile supports.

519
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:53,100
And then system 76 made that custom GUI for it.

520
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:56,060
They're trying to complete a whole picture here, but you notice there's kind of a hole

521
00:27:56,060 --> 00:27:57,660
in this picture they're trying to complete.

522
00:27:57,660 --> 00:27:58,660
Yeah, I did.

523
00:27:58,660 --> 00:28:03,620
I think I believe I brought it up that they really should have some calibrated HP monitor

524
00:28:03,620 --> 00:28:09,160
that's calibrated like that panel in the laptop that is USB-C and it's just optimized to be

525
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:10,620
the plug in workstation.

526
00:28:10,620 --> 00:28:14,900
Yeah, something that it's like consistent across the two screens.

527
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:15,900
That'd be perfect.

528
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:18,760
And apparently nobody else thought of that on the call.

529
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:20,140
Maybe that's for Gen 2, right?

530
00:28:20,140 --> 00:28:24,900
Because if this thing sticks around, you get the sense that things like Core Boot are going

531
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:25,900
to be part of it.

532
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:26,900
Core Boot was on the list.

533
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:33,900
We asked them about that and they just ran out of time for version one is what they said.

534
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:39,500
The highlight of the call, I think, would be my fondness of liquor coming up as a quality

535
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:41,540
assurance metric they have.

536
00:28:41,540 --> 00:28:42,740
Amazing.

537
00:28:42,740 --> 00:28:44,020
Actually happened.

538
00:28:44,020 --> 00:28:45,100
Nicely done, Carl.

539
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:46,100
Nicely done.

540
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:50,020
Michael Dominic, I understand you were going to do some spill testing.

541
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:51,980
But yeah, so that actually happened.

542
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:55,700
They mentioned it and it does supposedly have a spill proof keyboard.

543
00:28:55,700 --> 00:29:02,100
I tried to get them to really get specific and they were like, well.

544
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:06,700
Well, you know, yeah, I'm like, well, and then of course I had to tell them it was broken

545
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:09,700
and the first thing I have to say, I did not spill anything.

546
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:12,700
Of course you did.

547
00:29:12,700 --> 00:29:14,500
I had to open with that.

548
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:15,500
I said it's just got to start.

549
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:16,500
Of course you did.

550
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:19,180
Yeah, because they know you, man.

551
00:29:19,180 --> 00:29:20,180
They know you.

552
00:29:20,180 --> 00:29:21,180
They know me.

553
00:29:21,180 --> 00:29:26,100
I'm still kind of getting acquainted with it, but I, like you, had a very similar experience

554
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:32,360
where I took it out of the box, I got it plugged in, but I am so damn busy that I didn't even

555
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:35,100
power it on for probably, you know, the next day.

556
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:39,260
I just didn't get, I didn't even get to it because, you know, I don't know, I got a lot.

557
00:29:39,260 --> 00:29:44,100
And so I fired up, I have set up so many laptops over the years that I can start to get a sense

558
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:48,380
of a machine pretty quickly and get an idea if it's going to be making a lot of noise

559
00:29:48,380 --> 00:29:52,540
and if it feels hot and okay, you know, those, it's passing all of those things.

560
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:54,500
It's doing a really good job.

561
00:29:54,500 --> 00:30:00,380
It wasn't until I wrapped up the workday and I just kind of, I put everything away and

562
00:30:00,380 --> 00:30:03,780
I just stayed here at the studio a little bit so I could take advantage of the bandwidth

563
00:30:03,780 --> 00:30:07,700
and I just started throwing everything at it because I was kind of in a rush.

564
00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:11,260
And so, you know, I was using it in anger as they say, although, you know, not angry,

565
00:30:11,260 --> 00:30:14,000
but just slamming everything at it.

566
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,580
And that's when it started to impress me.

567
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:18,720
You know, when a machine can take everything and still has, you can tell it still has more

568
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:20,840
to give, I like that a lot.

569
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:24,020
And you can upgrade this thing to 64 gigs of RAM.

570
00:30:24,020 --> 00:30:26,540
So if you need more headroom than 16 gigs, you can do it.

571
00:30:26,540 --> 00:30:29,860
I just don't think you can do it at time of configuration.

572
00:30:29,860 --> 00:30:33,340
But I get the sense too that you could probably replace other components in there as well.

573
00:30:33,340 --> 00:30:37,140
I'm tempted to open up my review unit and see just how serviceable it really is because

574
00:30:37,140 --> 00:30:38,820
they did stress that.

575
00:30:38,820 --> 00:30:39,820
I don't know.

576
00:30:39,820 --> 00:30:44,940
I'm tempted to say this thing is a contender for the crown of king of Linux laptops.

577
00:30:44,940 --> 00:30:46,580
They are in it to win it.

578
00:30:46,580 --> 00:30:47,880
They really are.

579
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:51,980
And we did ask them, how did this relationship come to be?

580
00:30:51,980 --> 00:30:56,460
That was a question that was asked, which they weren't going to touch on.

581
00:30:56,460 --> 00:31:02,680
And it sounds very much like HP got serious about wanting to get into this segment and

582
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:05,900
realize they needed a topic expert.

583
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:14,100
And my observation on that call that we had is that HP intimately understands the hardware,

584
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:19,100
the supply chain and the relationships, like relationships with AMD.

585
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:26,180
But System76 truly intuitively understands the Linux community and shipping a product

586
00:31:26,180 --> 00:31:27,940
for that crowd.

587
00:31:27,940 --> 00:31:31,300
And so I think those two things are actually working pretty well together.

588
00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:34,460
It sounds like HP realized they needed that topic expert.

589
00:31:34,460 --> 00:31:38,620
HP reached out to Carl, took a little bit of time.

590
00:31:38,620 --> 00:31:40,540
They started talking.

591
00:31:40,540 --> 00:31:44,500
They kind of realized, OK, actually, there is some things that kind of work here.

592
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:50,500
And specifically, Carl said, at the end of the day, this is an opportunity to reach more

593
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:54,180
Linux users on a tier one hardware OEM.

594
00:31:54,180 --> 00:31:57,240
And they didn't build Pop OS to only run on System76 hardware.

595
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:59,640
They built it for anyone to use.

596
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:03,320
So it gets Pop OS out there, too, which is a great thing for them.

597
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:06,100
But I feel like they actually committed.

598
00:32:06,100 --> 00:32:11,260
When you hear that they just kind of banged out a GUI tool to configure HP's mouse and

599
00:32:11,260 --> 00:32:15,740
that they're doing a definite Q&A and they have dev ones in-house that they're testing

600
00:32:15,740 --> 00:32:23,060
firmware releases on and kernel releases on, it seems like often when System76 does something,

601
00:32:23,060 --> 00:32:24,580
they really go all in on it.

602
00:32:24,580 --> 00:32:32,620
So I'm interested to see where this product line goes and when I can get my monitor.

603
00:32:32,620 --> 00:32:34,180
Linode.com slash coder.

604
00:32:34,180 --> 00:32:37,860
Go there to get $100 in 60 day credit on a new account.

605
00:32:37,860 --> 00:32:39,940
And it's a great way to support the show.

606
00:32:39,940 --> 00:32:41,980
Linode is fast, reliable cloud hosting.

607
00:32:41,980 --> 00:32:45,580
Everybody in this audience eventually has a need for that.

608
00:32:45,580 --> 00:32:50,980
And unlike those crazy, hyper-complicated duopoly platforms that want to lock you into their

609
00:32:50,980 --> 00:32:57,580
esoteric interface with their esoteric names for everything, Linode is classic hosting

610
00:32:57,580 --> 00:32:58,740
where you have full control.

611
00:32:58,740 --> 00:33:00,580
I mean, don't get me wrong.

612
00:33:00,580 --> 00:33:01,940
They got a great dashboard.

613
00:33:01,940 --> 00:33:08,260
They make it super easy to do one click deployments and manage your DNS and set up VLANs and work

614
00:33:08,260 --> 00:33:12,740
with whatever infrastructure management tools you might have, like Terraform, Ansible, Kubernetes,

615
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:13,740
etc.

616
00:33:13,740 --> 00:33:17,900
But also, if you just want to stand up some infrastructure, if you just want to take advantage

617
00:33:17,900 --> 00:33:23,100
of some really fast, really reliable, really well-supported hosting, you want to run something

618
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:29,740
on Linux, you want to build a project, Linode is great for that, for an individual or for

619
00:33:29,740 --> 00:33:30,740
a business.

620
00:33:30,740 --> 00:33:33,380
Like I run my family gaming servers on Linode.

621
00:33:33,380 --> 00:33:36,980
I've mentioned this before, Starbound, fun little game, right?

622
00:33:36,980 --> 00:33:39,900
Minecraft, kids love it.

623
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:43,860
Why not create a safe space for them on the internet on my own Linode or like my own Sync

624
00:33:43,860 --> 00:33:46,180
thing server, stuff like that.

625
00:33:46,180 --> 00:33:47,180
But we use it on our backend.

626
00:33:47,180 --> 00:33:51,780
In fact, we're using it more than ever and pretty soon it'll be powering so much more.

627
00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:56,700
And to that end, Linode has just upgraded their managed database services.

628
00:33:56,700 --> 00:33:59,940
So earlier it was just MySQL.

629
00:33:59,940 --> 00:34:01,300
And they launched that in May.

630
00:34:01,300 --> 00:34:04,500
And that's been super helpful because Linode knows how to do this stuff.

631
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:05,900
They know how to do hosting.

632
00:34:05,900 --> 00:34:08,220
They can take care of that.

633
00:34:08,220 --> 00:34:12,020
Well this week they've added Postgres and MongoDB.

634
00:34:12,020 --> 00:34:14,260
Well we use Postgres for several things.

635
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:17,500
And Wes and I are already talking about migrating to this.

636
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:19,580
Why wouldn't you, right?

637
00:34:19,580 --> 00:34:23,220
Outsource the responsibility of that maintenance and monitoring.

638
00:34:23,220 --> 00:34:26,940
All the burdens that make running a database a pain in the butt.

639
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:28,140
Outsource it to Linode.

640
00:34:28,140 --> 00:34:30,100
Let their experts do it.

641
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:33,960
I am so hyped that they finally launched this and I can't wait to switch some of our backend

642
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:35,100
stuff over to it.

643
00:34:35,100 --> 00:34:36,460
That's just great.

644
00:34:36,460 --> 00:34:38,440
I also love their object storage.

645
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:40,180
I think you'll be blown away.

646
00:34:40,180 --> 00:34:42,500
I think you'll be really impressed.

647
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:43,500
Go try it.

648
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:47,460
You'll get that $100 and support the show.

649
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:53,020
What you do, right now in your browser, you go to linode.com slash coder.

650
00:34:53,020 --> 00:34:57,100
That's a vote of confidence for the coder program and it gets you that $100 for 60 days

651
00:34:57,100 --> 00:34:58,420
on a new account.

652
00:34:58,420 --> 00:35:03,300
Linode.com slash coder.

653
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:05,000
Well we have a little bit of leftovers.

654
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:11,420
Just brief leftovers from WWDC and we have some text editor news, drama going on I suppose.

655
00:35:11,420 --> 00:35:13,620
So let's start there.

656
00:35:13,620 --> 00:35:20,060
GitHub has announced they are sunsetting the Atom text editor and the original creator

657
00:35:20,060 --> 00:35:25,900
of Atom has announced that he's introducing Zed, a collaborative code editor written in

658
00:35:25,900 --> 00:35:26,900
Rust.

659
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:27,900
He's going out like that?

660
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:28,900
That's right.

661
00:35:28,900 --> 00:35:29,900
He's coming back.

662
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:34,420
Yeah, although Zed was announced first I believe in the order of events and then the sunsetting

663
00:35:34,420 --> 00:35:37,380
of Atom was announced and you caught that.

664
00:35:37,380 --> 00:35:38,940
You were like, this is weird.

665
00:35:38,940 --> 00:35:43,180
The Atom guy just announced a new project.

666
00:35:43,180 --> 00:35:52,460
And of course it's built in Rust because everything is built in Rust these days.

667
00:35:52,460 --> 00:35:56,140
There's a better way to write code.

668
00:35:56,140 --> 00:35:59,300
Mission critical tools should be hyper responsive.

669
00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:03,140
Real time collaboration products are better software.

670
00:36:03,140 --> 00:36:05,660
Conversations should happen close to code.

671
00:36:05,660 --> 00:36:08,220
Oh yeah, it definitely needs a chat client.

672
00:36:08,220 --> 00:36:14,060
I was just complaining to my wife that ultimately every tech product evolves to have a chat

673
00:36:14,060 --> 00:36:15,060
platform.

674
00:36:15,060 --> 00:36:17,260
Every tech product ultimately has a chat platform.

675
00:36:17,260 --> 00:36:21,060
No, no, no, no.

676
00:36:21,060 --> 00:36:23,060
Honestly I'd give it a go.

677
00:36:23,060 --> 00:36:25,020
I'd give a Rust text editor a go.

678
00:36:25,020 --> 00:36:27,460
I will too just because it's not Electron.

679
00:36:27,460 --> 00:36:29,780
Yeah exactly.

680
00:36:29,780 --> 00:36:32,940
Any thoughts about Atom sunsetting?

681
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:35,180
I mean it was inevitable, right?

682
00:36:35,180 --> 00:36:41,860
You know, VS Code exists, they were under the same parent, right, GitHub effectively

683
00:36:41,860 --> 00:36:44,220
because Microsoft bought GitHub.

684
00:36:44,220 --> 00:36:47,260
So only one could survive, I don't know.

685
00:36:47,260 --> 00:36:50,500
How many Electron editors do you need?

686
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:51,500
Just saying.

687
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:52,500
Yeah.

688
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:53,500
Yeah, I agree.

689
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:54,500
I agree.

690
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:59,660
It feels a little sad because whenever something gets replaced and killed, you know, it's just

691
00:36:59,660 --> 00:37:01,260
but it is the right call.

692
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:04,020
I happen to know there's audience members out there that love Atom.

693
00:37:04,020 --> 00:37:08,380
Yeah, you hear from them every once in a while every time VS Code releases a new feature

694
00:37:08,380 --> 00:37:09,380
that's tied to Azure.

695
00:37:09,380 --> 00:37:13,260
They're like, ha ha, see, we warned you.

696
00:37:13,260 --> 00:37:16,180
But alas, they also owned Atom.

697
00:37:16,180 --> 00:37:17,180
I think you're right.

698
00:37:17,180 --> 00:37:18,180
Get off my bridge.

699
00:37:18,180 --> 00:37:23,420
All right, little WWDC leftovers, just a couple of things that didn't make it into our show

700
00:37:23,420 --> 00:37:29,340
because I don't know, I was moderately disappointed with our coverage, mostly things I didn't

701
00:37:29,340 --> 00:37:32,460
mention because I was in such a rush.

702
00:37:32,460 --> 00:37:37,460
But then again, I listened to some other podcast coverage and they get so drunk on the hype

703
00:37:37,460 --> 00:37:38,460
that it's embarrassing.

704
00:37:38,460 --> 00:37:40,220
I was going to say, what are you disappointed in?

705
00:37:40,220 --> 00:37:42,580
We managed to stay like not Apple high.

706
00:37:42,580 --> 00:37:43,900
I do think we did a good job there.

707
00:37:43,900 --> 00:37:46,180
We did not get crazy.

708
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:48,260
We did get a follow up from Apple.

709
00:37:48,260 --> 00:37:51,780
Stage manager on the iPad does require an M1 iPad.

710
00:37:51,780 --> 00:37:54,940
Only the M1 iPads have that virtual memory space.

711
00:37:54,940 --> 00:38:01,100
We suspected, that's right, so speculated, but Apple confirmed.

712
00:38:01,100 --> 00:38:06,220
Also didn't mention it in our coverage, no tease of the Mac Pro, which seems late at

713
00:38:06,220 --> 00:38:14,100
this point, and no hints at all about AR or VR, even though that was massively hype before

714
00:38:14,100 --> 00:38:15,160
the event.

715
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:18,600
There was nothing there that kind of implied that.

716
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:22,140
But I think the big thing that we didn't know at the time we recorded, but we now know after

717
00:38:22,140 --> 00:38:31,380
the fact, Apple has created a binary for x86 Linux boxes that's Rosetta.

718
00:38:31,380 --> 00:38:36,940
They've created Rosetta 2 for Linux that'll work on any modern ARM processor, any ARM

719
00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:42,780
processor that meets the 8.2 spec or later can run this Apple Rosetta binary.

720
00:38:42,780 --> 00:38:47,640
Now you got to get your hands on it and the way you get it is pretty ridiculous.

721
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:51,860
You have to be on a Mac using a hypervisor that's probably Apple's and then you have

722
00:38:51,860 --> 00:38:56,880
to mount a directory inside your VM to get access to it.

723
00:38:56,880 --> 00:39:00,500
But assuming, and I believe it's already happened, the Linux community just figured out how to

724
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:02,840
extract that and I think that's already happened.

725
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:10,780
You can throw this conceivably in an x86 container and then go run it on an ARM 8.2 or newer

726
00:39:10,780 --> 00:39:11,820
CPU.

727
00:39:11,820 --> 00:39:14,500
Doesn't have to be a Mac box in theory.

728
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:19,060
Rosetta for Linux, an actual Linux ELF binary.

729
00:39:19,060 --> 00:39:20,140
That seems like a big deal to me.

730
00:39:20,140 --> 00:39:23,700
That also seems to signal that Rosetta is going to be around for a long time and we're

731
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:26,940
going to be able to run x86 apps on Macs for a long time.

732
00:39:26,940 --> 00:39:27,940
Yeah.

733
00:39:27,940 --> 00:39:30,500
I mean, I think this is going to be important for some developers.

734
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:31,500
Yeah.

735
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:33,620
Rosetta has got at least five to 10 years, right?

736
00:39:33,620 --> 00:39:37,620
I guess the difference, although I don't know, I just was reading speculation, I guess the

737
00:39:37,620 --> 00:39:45,600
difference was Rosetta 1 contained a lot of code licensed from IBM and Rosetta 2 is an

738
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:47,540
Apple creation.

739
00:39:47,540 --> 00:39:51,340
So they own it all so they could just run it forever and definitely if they wanted to.

740
00:39:51,340 --> 00:39:52,340
Then why not?

741
00:39:52,340 --> 00:39:59,580
I mean, maybe not forever, but also just a side note, not really relevant to the show,

742
00:39:59,580 --> 00:40:04,820
but we didn't really understand at the time, but Apple announced a buy now pay later service

743
00:40:04,820 --> 00:40:08,760
and Apple is actually going to be the lender in that situation.

744
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:10,540
Apple has just turned into a lender.

745
00:40:10,540 --> 00:40:13,380
I believe they're working with Goldman Sachs again on this.

746
00:40:13,380 --> 00:40:20,200
They will handle the lending themselves for a buy now pay later offering using Apple pay.

747
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:21,520
How dystopian is that?

748
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:25,260
It's a long way from the kids with the rainbow apple and the pirate flag.

749
00:40:25,260 --> 00:40:26,260
That's for damn sure.

750
00:40:26,260 --> 00:40:27,260
Wow, man.

751
00:40:27,260 --> 00:40:28,260
Wow.

752
00:40:28,260 --> 00:40:33,820
I mean, we're talking asset trips and ashrams to, we're in a deep partnership with our good

753
00:40:33,820 --> 00:40:38,020
friends at Goldman Sachs and we're now a bank.

754
00:40:38,020 --> 00:40:44,740
Also just to kind of round this out, Intel CEO Pat was talking big at an event, you know.

755
00:40:44,740 --> 00:40:46,500
The word you're looking for is drunk.

756
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:47,500
Yeah.

757
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:50,400
I think he might've been drunk or at least delusional.

758
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:55,700
He said in a quote, in an interview to Axios, he said that they think they can win Apple's

759
00:40:55,700 --> 00:40:56,700
business back.

760
00:40:56,700 --> 00:41:00,780
He says, quote, Apple decided they could do a better chip themselves than we could and

761
00:41:00,780 --> 00:41:05,340
you know, they did a pretty good job, so what I have to do is create a better chip than

762
00:41:05,340 --> 00:41:06,940
they can do themselves.

763
00:41:06,940 --> 00:41:11,860
I would hope to win them back, to win a piece of their business as well as many other pieces

764
00:41:11,860 --> 00:41:13,780
of their business over time.

765
00:41:13,780 --> 00:41:19,340
Now, in other news, I just got this text message transcript, Tim, I'm sorry.

766
00:41:19,340 --> 00:41:20,340
What did I do?

767
00:41:20,340 --> 00:41:21,340
Please call.

768
00:41:21,340 --> 00:41:22,340
No reply.

769
00:41:22,340 --> 00:41:24,780
Tim, I miss you.

770
00:41:24,780 --> 00:41:26,540
Now it's, now, wait, wait, now it's 2 30.

771
00:41:26,540 --> 00:41:28,040
The bar has closed.

772
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:33,260
You know what, Tim, if you like that M1 so much, then you can have them.

773
00:41:33,260 --> 00:41:36,640
Next day around noon, Pat, you're starting to scare me.

774
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:37,640
Please leave me alone.

775
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:38,640
It's over.

776
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:41,580
I have my own chip engineers now.

777
00:41:41,580 --> 00:41:42,580
All the best.

778
00:41:42,580 --> 00:41:43,580
I wish you a happy life.

779
00:41:43,580 --> 00:41:44,580
Oh man.

780
00:41:44,580 --> 00:41:45,580
Your friend, Tim.

781
00:41:45,580 --> 00:41:49,620
Pat wakes up three hours later at 3 30.

782
00:41:49,620 --> 00:41:51,420
Tim, you're killing me.

783
00:41:51,420 --> 00:41:52,860
I miss you so much.

784
00:41:52,860 --> 00:41:55,140
Have you heard about Gen 12?

785
00:41:55,140 --> 00:41:56,140
Question mark.

786
00:41:56,140 --> 00:41:57,140
Happy face.

787
00:41:57,140 --> 00:41:59,860
No reply.

788
00:41:59,860 --> 00:42:01,340
That is probably exactly what happened.

789
00:42:01,340 --> 00:42:02,340
I think you nailed that.

790
00:42:02,340 --> 00:42:03,860
I think I just got it, right?

791
00:42:03,860 --> 00:42:04,860
I got it.

792
00:42:04,860 --> 00:42:10,580
You know, I watch sometimes the CNBCs and the Intel, Pat comes on, he comes on there,

793
00:42:10,580 --> 00:42:11,580
the Intel CEO.

794
00:42:11,580 --> 00:42:12,580
It's so sad.

795
00:42:12,580 --> 00:42:17,300
And, and they're like, boy, looking at the numbers, Intel is sort of set for like devastating

796
00:42:17,300 --> 00:42:19,820
losses in the latter half of the year.

797
00:42:19,820 --> 00:42:20,820
And he's like, sure are.

798
00:42:20,820 --> 00:42:21,820
I'd be, oh wait.

799
00:42:21,820 --> 00:42:22,820
No, no.

800
00:42:22,820 --> 00:42:23,820
He's like, no, no.

801
00:42:23,820 --> 00:42:24,820
It's going to be great.

802
00:42:24,820 --> 00:42:28,740
There's going to be a big surge of computer purchases in the fall.

803
00:42:28,740 --> 00:42:29,740
And have you heard of Ohio?

804
00:42:29,740 --> 00:42:30,740
Ohio, right?

805
00:42:30,740 --> 00:42:31,740
Yeah.

806
00:42:31,740 --> 00:42:32,740
Oh man.

807
00:42:32,740 --> 00:42:35,980
Like he's just, oh anyways, they're so screwed.

808
00:42:35,980 --> 00:42:36,980
They're so screwed.

809
00:42:36,980 --> 00:42:39,260
But Qualcomm though, they, they are bullish.

810
00:42:39,260 --> 00:42:40,260
They're going to nail this.

811
00:42:40,260 --> 00:42:45,340
Qualcomm's chief executive said on Thursday, they believe the company actually will have

812
00:42:45,340 --> 00:42:51,140
the best chip on the market soon with help from a team of chief, with help from a team

813
00:42:51,140 --> 00:42:56,100
of chip architects who formerly worked at Apple, but now work at Qualcomm.

814
00:42:56,100 --> 00:42:57,100
That's how you do it.

815
00:42:57,100 --> 00:42:58,100
That's how you do it.

816
00:42:58,100 --> 00:43:00,020
Qualcomm's like, we're not even going to pretend anymore.

817
00:43:00,020 --> 00:43:02,060
We're just going to bribe a bunch of dudes from Apple.

818
00:43:02,060 --> 00:43:03,060
Let's go.

819
00:43:03,060 --> 00:43:04,060
That's pretty impressive.

820
00:43:04,060 --> 00:43:05,060
That is.

821
00:43:05,060 --> 00:43:09,660
For the record, if you guys like the sad breakup text message of tech executives, I have many

822
00:43:09,660 --> 00:43:12,180
of those in the bank.

823
00:43:12,180 --> 00:43:15,580
I feel like it could be a series right there.

824
00:43:15,580 --> 00:43:19,780
We did have a couple of boosts come in, but the show, as we record this year's show, I

825
00:43:19,780 --> 00:43:22,780
think our show has only been out for like 12 hours, 13 hours.

826
00:43:22,780 --> 00:43:23,780
Yeah.

827
00:43:23,780 --> 00:43:24,780
We're like back to back.

828
00:43:24,780 --> 00:43:30,940
But the golden dragon sent us in 222 sats, missed a duck, minus one duck today.

829
00:43:30,940 --> 00:43:32,300
So I can get through a week on these sats.

830
00:43:32,300 --> 00:43:35,700
Glad to hear that the dev one is a great system to dev on.

831
00:43:35,700 --> 00:43:40,380
Maybe one you should go full inception on and dev on the dev one using the dev one Linux

832
00:43:40,380 --> 00:43:41,380
distribution.

833
00:43:41,380 --> 00:43:42,380
Whoa.

834
00:43:42,380 --> 00:43:43,980
He sent that in live to the show.

835
00:43:43,980 --> 00:43:44,980
Very sneaky, Doug.

836
00:43:44,980 --> 00:43:45,980
Damn.

837
00:43:45,980 --> 00:43:46,980
All right.

838
00:43:46,980 --> 00:43:47,980
Very nice.

839
00:43:47,980 --> 00:43:49,980
I feel like you get a special boost, Yale, for sending that in live.

840
00:43:49,980 --> 00:43:50,980
Boost.

841
00:43:50,980 --> 00:43:53,200
We also got a thanks from Cos Peeland.

842
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:56,500
He sent in his classic 3690 sats.

843
00:43:56,500 --> 00:43:59,860
And then we got one in here that I think is going to get you fired up.

844
00:43:59,860 --> 00:44:01,660
I almost don't want to read their name.

845
00:44:01,660 --> 00:44:02,660
See if I can find it.

846
00:44:02,660 --> 00:44:05,780
Because I don't want to read their name on air.

847
00:44:05,780 --> 00:44:06,780
It's Egon?

848
00:44:06,780 --> 00:44:07,780
No.

849
00:44:07,780 --> 00:44:12,140
I'm pretty sure if you don't, we're just going to assume it's Egon.

850
00:44:12,140 --> 00:44:13,140
Yeah.

851
00:44:13,140 --> 00:44:14,140
No.

852
00:44:14,140 --> 00:44:15,140
No, it wasn't Egon.

853
00:44:15,140 --> 00:44:16,140
I know there was one more in here.

854
00:44:16,140 --> 00:44:17,140
Here it is.

855
00:44:17,140 --> 00:44:18,140
Here we go.

856
00:44:18,140 --> 00:44:19,140
Here we go.

857
00:44:19,140 --> 00:44:20,140
All right.

858
00:44:20,140 --> 00:44:27,040
So this was actually a pretty generous 5,000 sats boost from Crashmaster 18.

859
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:31,620
And he's asking about an app that smells a lot like Alice, and he wants to know if you're

860
00:44:31,620 --> 00:44:32,620
familiar with it.

861
00:44:32,620 --> 00:44:34,660
But I don't even want to give them a plug on air.

862
00:44:34,660 --> 00:44:35,820
Oh, I've not.

863
00:44:35,820 --> 00:44:39,940
I will PM you the name of this.

864
00:44:39,940 --> 00:44:41,420
Here, I'll put the boost in here.

865
00:44:41,420 --> 00:44:43,660
See if you've recognized that name.

866
00:44:43,660 --> 00:44:44,980
Now you tell me.

867
00:44:44,980 --> 00:44:47,260
Anyways, Crashmaster wanted to know.

868
00:44:47,260 --> 00:44:49,300
So I'll pass it along to you.

869
00:44:49,300 --> 00:44:51,780
You go get them, you know?

870
00:44:51,780 --> 00:44:56,460
I hate to see you go into war on the air, but Crashmaster wanted you to be aware.

871
00:44:56,460 --> 00:44:57,460
Mm-hmm.

872
00:44:57,460 --> 00:44:58,460
I'll take a look.

873
00:44:58,460 --> 00:44:59,460
I do not.

874
00:44:59,460 --> 00:45:00,460
This does not look familiar.

875
00:45:00,460 --> 00:45:01,460
All right.

876
00:45:01,460 --> 00:45:02,540
Well, I also want to thank our members.

877
00:45:02,540 --> 00:45:03,660
Thank you very much.

878
00:45:03,660 --> 00:45:07,400
We get offers to do things that you would be surprised.

879
00:45:07,400 --> 00:45:09,900
We have gotten offers to do paid hardware reviews.

880
00:45:09,900 --> 00:45:12,560
We have gotten offers to do paid interviews.

881
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:17,060
We get approached by all kinds of sponsors that are kind of probably not the sorts that

882
00:45:17,060 --> 00:45:19,100
you would probably prefer to hear from.

883
00:45:19,100 --> 00:45:20,500
And you've created chip executives.

884
00:45:20,500 --> 00:45:23,180
Well, I would take that sponsorship.

885
00:45:23,180 --> 00:45:25,660
I would take that and tell money like that.

886
00:45:25,660 --> 00:45:26,900
Would I use the Intel machine?

887
00:45:26,900 --> 00:45:28,500
No, but I would take their money.

888
00:45:28,500 --> 00:45:29,780
I would love that.

889
00:45:29,780 --> 00:45:33,460
But no, you notice how we don't have mattress sponsors, right?

890
00:45:33,460 --> 00:45:36,860
Or like a Squarespace, like these ones that, you know, come on.

891
00:45:36,860 --> 00:45:41,920
Have you noticed a lot of the higher end podcasts are now offering you, shall we say, sausage

892
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:44,280
pills for male enhancement?

893
00:45:44,280 --> 00:45:45,880
Isn't that fascinating to watch?

894
00:45:45,880 --> 00:45:51,260
Also having a membership feeds let us do things like avoid dynamic inserts on our back catalog

895
00:45:51,260 --> 00:45:53,100
to monetize the back catalog, right?

896
00:45:53,100 --> 00:45:58,140
It's just the membership is it's it's like a real key pillar to how we do the show.

897
00:45:58,140 --> 00:46:01,860
So thank you to our Coder QA team at Coder QA dot co.

898
00:46:01,860 --> 00:46:03,900
As a thank you, get an ad free version of the feed.

899
00:46:03,900 --> 00:46:06,660
I am working also on a live version of the feed, but it's going to take a little bit

900
00:46:06,660 --> 00:46:11,740
of tech back end work and you get the Coderly report, Coder QA dot co.

901
00:46:11,740 --> 00:46:16,680
I think we should also mention that you and I will not be live the week of the 20th, Monday

902
00:46:16,680 --> 00:46:17,680
the 20th.

903
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:22,420
You and I are traveling and there will be no Coder live that week, but we will have

904
00:46:22,420 --> 00:46:23,760
one in the feeds.

905
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:27,940
So we should clarify we are traveling, but because of the laws of physics, we are not

906
00:46:27,940 --> 00:46:33,380
traveling to the same place or together or at the same time in the same space, because

907
00:46:33,380 --> 00:46:34,380
that would right.

908
00:46:34,380 --> 00:46:36,940
That would be you can't have two atoms share the same.

909
00:46:36,940 --> 00:46:41,900
Oh, can we just do a quick Star Trek update before we oh, oh, yeah, totally.

910
00:46:41,900 --> 00:46:42,900
You got a strange already.

911
00:46:42,900 --> 00:46:44,400
You got a strange worlds update already.

912
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:50,180
I continue to like strange worlds and I have once again finished the original series.

913
00:46:50,180 --> 00:46:53,300
Oh, season three could be the trickiest to get through.

914
00:46:53,300 --> 00:46:54,300
I just finished it.

915
00:46:54,300 --> 00:46:55,300
I've tossed.

916
00:46:55,300 --> 00:46:56,300
Yeah, I just finished it.

917
00:46:56,300 --> 00:46:57,460
I know that can be a little tricky.

918
00:46:57,460 --> 00:46:59,100
It's not that's not the best season.

919
00:46:59,100 --> 00:47:05,020
The last episode is super weird, but I'm at a I'd say a fork, but it's more of a trident

920
00:47:05,020 --> 00:47:06,460
in the road.

921
00:47:06,460 --> 00:47:10,460
The obvious choice, I think, is next generation, but that's the one I've watched the most.

922
00:47:10,460 --> 00:47:16,100
Yeah, I'm a big fan of bald dudes who pretend to be French, but are definitely British.

923
00:47:16,100 --> 00:47:19,100
Yes, they try to retcon that in Picard, by the way.

924
00:47:19,100 --> 00:47:20,100
Do they really?

925
00:47:20,100 --> 00:47:21,100
Yeah, they do.

926
00:47:21,100 --> 00:47:22,100
They try to.

927
00:47:22,100 --> 00:47:26,700
And then, of course, there's like, well, should I give disco another chance because, you know,

928
00:47:26,700 --> 00:47:29,160
Star Trek with good effects is actually kind of cool.

929
00:47:29,160 --> 00:47:35,420
And then there's the one I keep neglecting because I just it's enterprise.

930
00:47:35,420 --> 00:47:40,960
I mean, I was hoping you were going to say that I've never really given it a fair shake.

931
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:47,060
So that's I just finished season one of Enterprise and I'm just starting season two this week.

932
00:47:47,060 --> 00:47:48,060
Probably this weekend.

933
00:47:48,060 --> 00:47:55,780
Season two, and I initially didn't love Enterprise, but I watched all of it when it aired.

934
00:47:55,780 --> 00:48:00,420
And I have to tell you, rewatching it now, if it's been a while since you watched it

935
00:48:00,420 --> 00:48:04,820
rewatching it now, it is so much better than I remember.

936
00:48:04,820 --> 00:48:09,620
And I think in part because Discovery and Picard have changed my perspectives a little

937
00:48:09,620 --> 00:48:18,820
bit, this this is the last Trek filmed in the traditional Trek style with the character

938
00:48:18,820 --> 00:48:25,180
actors that spanned multiple series and the some of the same production crew.

939
00:48:25,180 --> 00:48:31,080
So it has a very familiar style, but it has the best effects of any of the Trek series.

940
00:48:31,080 --> 00:48:37,980
And the other thing that is extremely enjoyable is everyone is competent at their jobs.

941
00:48:37,980 --> 00:48:40,700
And and they're ahead of the audience most of the time.

942
00:48:40,700 --> 00:48:44,300
Like, you know, when you're watching something, I mean, the characters, not the actors.

943
00:48:44,300 --> 00:48:45,300
Yeah.

944
00:48:45,300 --> 00:48:46,300
Yeah.

945
00:48:46,300 --> 00:48:48,940
You know, like when you're watching something on Discovery and you're like, well, you know,

946
00:48:48,940 --> 00:48:52,100
if they would just do X, Y, Z, this problem would be solved and it's not really a big

947
00:48:52,100 --> 00:48:53,100
deal.

948
00:48:53,100 --> 00:48:56,620
And they don't do that for like three episodes and it drives you crazy in Enterprise.

949
00:48:56,620 --> 00:49:01,100
Right as you start going, well, you know, if they would just they do it, they do it

950
00:49:01,100 --> 00:49:03,820
because they're competent and they're smart.

951
00:49:03,820 --> 00:49:06,660
And it's it's so much better than I expected.

952
00:49:06,660 --> 00:49:08,260
It's so much better.

953
00:49:08,260 --> 00:49:11,080
And it has been very enjoyable to go back and rewatch it.

954
00:49:11,080 --> 00:49:14,660
And if I'm enjoying season one this much, I can't imagine how much I'm going to enjoy

955
00:49:14,660 --> 00:49:19,740
season three and four, because I remember season one and two being the rockiest of them.

956
00:49:19,740 --> 00:49:23,660
And I was just looking at Rotten Tomatoes, you know, now has an audience average score

957
00:49:23,660 --> 00:49:25,580
of seventy nine percent.

958
00:49:25,580 --> 00:49:32,620
And the actors who play Malcolm and Trip, they've recently started a podcast called

959
00:49:32,620 --> 00:49:33,620
Shuttle Pod One.

960
00:49:33,620 --> 00:49:35,140
I believe it's just based on their episode.

961
00:49:35,140 --> 00:49:36,940
They did overcast.

962
00:49:36,940 --> 00:49:37,940
Yeah.

963
00:49:37,940 --> 00:49:40,180
And it's it's on YouTube as a video production, too.

964
00:49:40,180 --> 00:49:43,940
And they've been bringing on former directors and their costars.

965
00:49:43,940 --> 00:49:49,740
They just did one with Rick Berman and they just did a two parter with Brandon Braga.

966
00:49:49,740 --> 00:49:52,420
And you know, they were the people running production at the time.

967
00:49:52,420 --> 00:49:57,180
So you get like I just started watching Enterprise again and then they launched that podcast

968
00:49:57,180 --> 00:50:00,860
and then they're bringing on people and they're talking behind the scenes about the first

969
00:50:00,860 --> 00:50:01,860
few seasons.

970
00:50:01,860 --> 00:50:04,900
It has been so neat.

971
00:50:04,900 --> 00:50:06,700
It's a you got to go Enterprise, man.

972
00:50:06,700 --> 00:50:07,860
You've got to do it.

973
00:50:07,860 --> 00:50:08,860
You got it.

974
00:50:08,860 --> 00:50:09,860
Can I throw two curveballs at you?

975
00:50:09,860 --> 00:50:11,300
Oh, yeah, of course.

976
00:50:11,300 --> 00:50:14,780
I have never completed all of Stargate, but I love Stargate.

977
00:50:14,780 --> 00:50:15,780
OK.

978
00:50:15,780 --> 00:50:19,300
And if I want to be a deep nerd, although I don't know that I have the stomach for this

979
00:50:19,300 --> 00:50:22,660
one, Babylon Five, man, I have tried Babylon Five.

980
00:50:22,660 --> 00:50:23,660
I can't get through that.

981
00:50:23,660 --> 00:50:26,420
I feel like I should like it, but I've never made it past.

982
00:50:26,420 --> 00:50:27,860
I can't get through that first season.

983
00:50:27,860 --> 00:50:29,340
I've tried so hard.

984
00:50:29,340 --> 00:50:33,540
I just watched a YouTube or recap the Babylon Five series and it did make me want to watch

985
00:50:33,540 --> 00:50:34,540
it.

986
00:50:34,540 --> 00:50:36,740
But Enterprise isn't going anywhere.

987
00:50:36,740 --> 00:50:37,740
Right.

988
00:50:37,740 --> 00:50:40,540
So you could do a little bit of deviation.

989
00:50:40,540 --> 00:50:41,780
Have you done The Expanse yet?

990
00:50:41,780 --> 00:50:42,780
No, I have not.

991
00:50:42,780 --> 00:50:44,580
Is that a comedy or is that Orwell?

992
00:50:44,580 --> 00:50:45,580
That's Orwell.

993
00:50:45,580 --> 00:50:46,580
Whatever.

994
00:50:46,580 --> 00:50:47,580
Yeah, that's Orwell.

995
00:50:47,580 --> 00:50:48,580
Oh, boy.

996
00:50:48,580 --> 00:50:49,580
Oh, boy.

997
00:50:49,580 --> 00:50:52,420
I used to just watch TNG over and over again.

998
00:50:52,420 --> 00:50:53,420
I'm freaking out.

999
00:50:53,420 --> 00:50:54,420
Oh, God, Mike.

1000
00:50:54,420 --> 00:50:55,420
Oh, God.

1001
00:50:55,420 --> 00:50:56,940
I would kill to be you right now.

1002
00:50:56,940 --> 00:50:59,980
I am so jealous that you haven't seen The Expanse yet.

1003
00:50:59,980 --> 00:51:02,300
So where is The Expanse available to me?

1004
00:51:02,300 --> 00:51:03,300
Amazon Prime.

1005
00:51:03,300 --> 00:51:04,300
OK.

1006
00:51:04,300 --> 00:51:10,460
And I took three passes at the first few episodes because I didn't like the character it initially

1007
00:51:10,460 --> 00:51:15,900
focuses on, but that character isn't the main character of the series.

1008
00:51:15,900 --> 00:51:20,620
And by the time I got through the first season, I was really into it.

1009
00:51:20,620 --> 00:51:24,740
In fact, if a wizard came out of a genie, a genie came out of a bottle and they said

1010
00:51:24,740 --> 00:51:27,040
to me, Chris, you can have one wish in the world.

1011
00:51:27,040 --> 00:51:29,800
It wouldn't be, you know, rich.

1012
00:51:29,800 --> 00:51:32,640
It wouldn't be that I live forever.

1013
00:51:32,640 --> 00:51:33,760
It wouldn't be any of that.

1014
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:37,900
It would be make Star Trek like The Expanse.

1015
00:51:37,900 --> 00:51:38,900
It is.

1016
00:51:38,900 --> 00:51:39,900
Oh, you're writing some checks.

1017
00:51:39,900 --> 00:51:40,900
So good.

1018
00:51:40,900 --> 00:51:41,900
It is so good.

1019
00:51:41,900 --> 00:51:44,720
It's it's what's going to be our future.

1020
00:51:44,720 --> 00:51:45,720
What The Expanse.

1021
00:51:45,720 --> 00:51:48,780
It's almost it's almost it's almost inevitable.

1022
00:51:48,780 --> 00:51:53,540
It's if humanity just kind of spread out into our solar system, but we never go beyond our

1023
00:51:53,540 --> 00:51:54,540
solar system.

1024
00:51:54,540 --> 00:51:55,540
Right.

1025
00:51:55,540 --> 00:52:00,840
Because when because this this show actually takes place with the use of the limitations

1026
00:52:00,840 --> 00:52:01,840
of space.

1027
00:52:01,840 --> 00:52:02,840
Right.

1028
00:52:02,840 --> 00:52:06,520
Because they don't have like crazy technology that wouldn't actually exist.

1029
00:52:06,520 --> 00:52:10,880
Combat is incredible because it's like it really, really would be in space.

1030
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:13,540
And they nail the realism so well.

1031
00:52:13,540 --> 00:52:16,420
They make such good characters, such good storytelling.

1032
00:52:16,420 --> 00:52:19,700
And then on top of that, the books are incredible.

1033
00:52:19,700 --> 00:52:24,620
And it's one of those rare things where the books don't really take anything away from

1034
00:52:24,620 --> 00:52:25,740
the show.

1035
00:52:25,740 --> 00:52:28,000
They just add more context.

1036
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:32,000
You could watch the show and never read the books, or you could watch all of the show

1037
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:35,380
and then read the books, or you could read the book and watch the show together.

1038
00:52:35,380 --> 00:52:36,380
Like I've done all of that.

1039
00:52:36,380 --> 00:52:37,380
Oh, my God.

1040
00:52:37,380 --> 00:52:38,380
Sold.

1041
00:52:38,380 --> 00:52:39,380
Sold.

1042
00:52:39,380 --> 00:52:40,380
That's what I'm doing.

1043
00:52:40,380 --> 00:52:41,380
It's so great.

1044
00:52:41,380 --> 00:52:44,700
And the audiobooks from Audible are some of my favorite audiobooks of all time.

1045
00:52:44,700 --> 00:52:46,140
You know, you got to go look up The Expanse series.

1046
00:52:46,140 --> 00:52:48,140
It's kind of hard because there's like a lot of those books.

1047
00:52:48,140 --> 00:52:51,880
Only the first six books are really where the TV show takes place.

1048
00:52:51,880 --> 00:52:55,260
Some of the best television ever created ever.

1049
00:52:55,260 --> 00:52:56,620
And just give you an idea.

1050
00:52:56,620 --> 00:53:01,500
So the show started on sci fi, but it was so expensive to produce that sci fi shut it

1051
00:53:01,500 --> 00:53:02,500
down.

1052
00:53:02,500 --> 00:53:05,340
But the fans love the show so much they freaked out.

1053
00:53:05,340 --> 00:53:08,200
And one of the fans was Jeff Bezos.

1054
00:53:08,200 --> 00:53:11,900
So Jeff Bezos just bought the whole thing and moved it over to Prime.

1055
00:53:11,900 --> 00:53:12,900
Yeah.

1056
00:53:12,900 --> 00:53:13,900
Thanks.

1057
00:53:13,900 --> 00:53:14,900
So good, man.

1058
00:53:14,900 --> 00:53:15,900
I.

1059
00:53:15,900 --> 00:53:18,420
We're so spoiled.

1060
00:53:18,420 --> 00:53:19,420
I'd love to watch that again.

1061
00:53:19,420 --> 00:53:20,420
All right.

1062
00:53:20,420 --> 00:53:21,420
So.

1063
00:53:21,420 --> 00:53:26,020
So with apologies to Captain Archer yet again, that seems to keep happening every year.

1064
00:53:26,020 --> 00:53:28,800
The Expanse it is and I see that there's seven seasons currently.

1065
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:29,800
So this will take a while.

1066
00:53:29,800 --> 00:53:30,800
Yeah.

1067
00:53:30,800 --> 00:53:31,800
But they're not too long.

1068
00:53:31,800 --> 00:53:32,800
They're so good.

1069
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:33,800
So, so good.

1070
00:53:33,800 --> 00:53:34,800
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

1071
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:35,800
Oh, so good.

1072
00:53:35,800 --> 00:53:36,800
Oh, man.

1073
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:37,800
Anyways.

1074
00:53:37,800 --> 00:53:38,800
I got it.

1075
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:39,800
I got to go lay down now.

1076
00:53:39,800 --> 00:53:40,800
I'm so excited.

1077
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:41,800
Let's let's wrap this up.

1078
00:53:41,800 --> 00:53:42,800
I'm I'm I'm for Clempt now.

1079
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:45,100
Is there any way you want to send people this week?

1080
00:53:45,100 --> 00:53:46,940
Go to Alice.dev.

1081
00:53:46,940 --> 00:53:48,420
Nice and easy.

1082
00:53:48,420 --> 00:53:49,980
He's at Dumanuco on the Twitter.

1083
00:53:49,980 --> 00:53:50,980
We'll have links there.

1084
00:53:50,980 --> 00:53:51,980
I'm at Chris Ellis.

1085
00:53:51,980 --> 00:53:56,060
The podcast is at Coder Radio Show and the whole network's at Jupiter signal.

1086
00:53:56,060 --> 00:53:59,380
You know, there's a whole network of shows.

1087
00:53:59,380 --> 00:54:04,140
We did a breakdown on that Rosetta story, the details of that in Linux action news.

1088
00:54:04,140 --> 00:54:08,900
And I'm going to do my Linux user's perspective review on Linux Unplugged of the HP Dev 1.

1089
00:54:08,900 --> 00:54:13,380
I'll throw some benchmarks at it, really push it all the way in Sunday's Linux Unplugged.

1090
00:54:13,380 --> 00:54:14,980
So check that out.

1091
00:54:14,980 --> 00:54:18,480
Links to what we talked about today at coder.show slash four seven zero.

1092
00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:21,220
That's where you'll find our contact form and our RSS feed.

1093
