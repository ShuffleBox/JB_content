00:00.000 --> 00:15.520
This is Koda Radio, episode 411 for April 26th, 2021.

00:15.520 --> 00:19.160
Hello and welcome in to Jupiter Broadcasting's weekly talk show, taking a pragmatic look

00:19.160 --> 00:23.940
at the art and business of software development and the world of technology.

00:23.940 --> 00:26.480
This episode is brought to you by Cloud Guru.

00:26.480 --> 00:32.660
You know, Cloud Guru has Cloud Playground, Azure, AWS, or Google's Cloud Sandboxes on

00:32.660 --> 00:36.920
their credit card, ACG's credit card, not your credit card, theirs.

00:41.140 --> 00:46.640
My name is Chris, and joining us all set up on his brand new Windows-powered machine,

00:46.640 --> 00:48.120
it's our host, Mr. Dominic.

00:48.120 --> 00:49.120
Hello, Mike.

00:49.120 --> 00:54.400
I see you're trying to bait me, but actually, I did have to get bailed out to this show

00:54.400 --> 00:57.200
40 minutes late by the M1 MacBook Air.

00:57.200 --> 01:01.560
And therefore, I have prepared, I actually prepared this song before, but it's even colder

01:01.560 --> 01:02.560
now.

01:02.560 --> 01:03.560
Okay.

01:03.560 --> 01:06.560
Just like my hero, Dean Martin, we do have a brief musical intro.

01:06.560 --> 01:12.320
Chris, can you drum me in or something?

01:12.320 --> 01:15.160
That's the production quality you've all come to expect.

01:15.160 --> 01:16.160
Do-re-mi.

01:16.160 --> 01:17.160
Intel sucks.

01:17.160 --> 01:18.840
Okay, here we go.

01:18.840 --> 01:21.680
Imagine there's no M1.

01:21.680 --> 01:24.360
It's impossible to try.

01:24.360 --> 01:29.520
Noble below us, not above us, only Evo.

01:29.520 --> 01:32.920
And you need to know a lot about processor architectures available today to understand

01:32.920 --> 01:33.920
that joke.

01:33.920 --> 01:39.200
But basically, it's not an awesome time to be Intel.

01:39.200 --> 01:40.760
I think soundboard, Mike, said it best.

01:40.760 --> 01:42.080
What, do you got a vape pen there?

01:42.080 --> 01:45.040
I think you're nuts.

01:45.040 --> 01:49.120
I just spent roughly $2,400 on another ThinkPad, so.

01:49.120 --> 01:50.120
What?

01:50.120 --> 01:51.120
Boom.

01:51.120 --> 01:52.920
You could have got an iPad Pro for that money.

01:52.920 --> 01:58.360
Well, it turns out that I'm doing a disturbing amount of.NET these days.

01:58.360 --> 02:02.760
I've kind of been keeping it secret under the Python stuff, but that never stopped.

02:02.760 --> 02:06.520
And well, Chris, there's a time in every young man's life.

02:06.520 --> 02:08.480
I mean, hold on, we got to back up.

02:08.480 --> 02:12.960
Before you go too far, $2,400 on a ThinkPad, like what did you get?

02:12.960 --> 02:14.480
Did you get something super sweet?

02:14.480 --> 02:15.480
Me?

02:15.480 --> 02:16.480
Never.

02:16.480 --> 02:17.480
I always go for low-end machines.

02:17.480 --> 02:18.480
Uh-huh.

02:18.480 --> 02:19.480
So what is this thing?

02:19.480 --> 02:23.920
It might be, in a hypothetical world that definitely is not legally actionable, it might

02:23.920 --> 02:26.960
be the newest X1 Carbon.

02:26.960 --> 02:27.960
Oh.

02:27.960 --> 02:28.960
Basically maxed out.

02:28.960 --> 02:29.960
Yeah.

02:29.960 --> 02:30.960
Yeah.

02:30.960 --> 02:31.960
Okay.

02:31.960 --> 02:32.960
All right.

02:32.960 --> 02:33.960
That's a good call.

02:33.960 --> 02:34.960
Yeah.

02:34.960 --> 02:35.960
The one with Windows on it?

02:35.960 --> 02:36.960
Indeed.

02:36.960 --> 02:37.960
Oh.

02:37.960 --> 02:38.960
So you got the Gen 9 then.

02:38.960 --> 02:40.200
That's nice, because the Linux version is Gen 8 only still.

02:40.200 --> 02:41.200
I hope.

02:41.200 --> 02:42.200
Did I get the Gen 9?

02:42.200 --> 02:45.400
Chris, if I could have paid another $1,000, I would have got the Gen 10.

02:45.400 --> 02:48.040
I mean, who do you think you're talking to?

02:48.040 --> 02:49.040
Right.

02:49.040 --> 02:50.040
Who are you?

02:50.040 --> 02:51.040
Hi.

02:51.040 --> 02:52.040
Hang on.

02:52.040 --> 02:53.040
I got the receipt right here.

02:53.040 --> 02:57.120
$2,443.86, if you're going to be a little bitch about it.

02:57.120 --> 03:02.840
The part number, for those of you who are going to be assholes, is 2-0-X-W-0-0-3-G-U-S.

03:02.840 --> 03:04.600
Are there any other questions?

03:04.600 --> 03:05.600
In fact, you know what?

03:05.600 --> 03:08.200
Let's look down this whole bill of materials, because I don't do any show prep.

03:08.200 --> 03:09.200
i7?

03:09.200 --> 03:10.200
i5?

03:10.200 --> 03:11.200
What?

03:11.200 --> 03:12.200
All right.

03:12.200 --> 03:13.200
You're just fucking with me now, right?

03:13.200 --> 03:14.400
Well, I'm just wondering how committed you are to this.

03:14.400 --> 03:15.400
You know what?

03:15.400 --> 03:17.280
My little brother is staying with me for a couple weeks.

03:17.280 --> 03:18.760
He showed me an i5 machine.

03:18.760 --> 03:19.760
Yeah.

03:19.760 --> 03:24.160
I poured a PBR on top of it in front of him while he was trying to save his homework to

03:24.160 --> 03:25.160
teach him a lesson.

03:25.160 --> 03:27.800
You got to make sure that you pass on wisdom when you can.

03:27.800 --> 03:28.800
That's right.

03:28.800 --> 03:32.840
That is a fictional story for any attorneys, assistants who are listening.

03:32.840 --> 03:33.840
Yeah.

03:33.840 --> 03:34.840
That's not...

03:34.840 --> 03:35.840
Mike does not actually abuse his brother.

03:35.840 --> 03:38.000
Mike has some actual problems.

03:38.000 --> 03:44.920
No, this is, of course, an 11th Gen i7, 2.8 gigahertz, but turbo's up to 4.7.

03:44.920 --> 03:48.480
At that point, I don't think you can actually hold it on your lap, but hey.

03:48.480 --> 03:52.840
Windows 10 Pro, because WSL is the best distro of Linux.

03:52.840 --> 03:57.320
I did not go for the touchscreen, even though I said I was going to, for reasons of battery

03:57.320 --> 03:58.320
life.

03:58.320 --> 04:02.040
16 gigs, which I still think is an inadequate amount of memory, but...

04:02.040 --> 04:03.040
Yeah.

04:03.040 --> 04:07.720
One terabyte, blah, blah, blah, PCIe, Intel Iris graphics, yeah, Intel, you'll still never

04:07.720 --> 04:10.960
be as good as the M1, and you should just go cry and cut yourself, I don't know.

04:10.960 --> 04:14.960
The Intel 11th Gen Z graphics are a big improvement.

04:14.960 --> 04:16.880
It's a huge leap over the 10th Gen.

04:16.880 --> 04:19.480
I mean, there's still Intel graphics, but they're way better.

04:19.480 --> 04:20.480
They still suck.

04:20.480 --> 04:26.640
Oh, and I will say $260 of this, we're buying their special USB-C QHD IPS monitor and docking

04:26.640 --> 04:28.560
station because I'm psychotic.

04:28.560 --> 04:31.360
You must be expecting you're going to be spending some serious time on this machine, working

04:31.360 --> 04:32.360
on something.

04:32.360 --> 04:36.720
This is going to be my full-time machine for the next nine months, and the other Lenovo

04:36.720 --> 04:42.960
is going to one of my employees because we somehow, when I say somehow, gather round,

04:42.960 --> 04:43.960
children.

04:43.960 --> 04:46.640
Let me tell you a story about the days before Diablo rose.

04:46.640 --> 04:49.400
Say a while and listen.

04:49.400 --> 04:52.560
Somebody got really frustrated with Linux drivers.

04:52.560 --> 04:53.560
Who is this, you?

04:53.560 --> 04:54.560
No, no.

04:54.560 --> 05:02.120
This is a theoretical warrior in Tristil, Trizial, wherever the hell Diablo takes place.

05:02.120 --> 05:03.160
Tell what Diablo.

05:03.160 --> 05:04.400
It's World of Warcraft.

05:04.400 --> 05:05.400
There was a gnome.

05:05.400 --> 05:06.840
He was mad about Linux drivers.

05:06.840 --> 05:07.840
He was a mage.

05:07.840 --> 05:12.440
He had some girl troubles, but he was trying real hard.

05:12.440 --> 05:15.000
He gave everything he had to Objective-C.

05:15.000 --> 05:17.440
This is, again, a fictional character.

05:17.440 --> 05:18.440
Right.

05:18.440 --> 05:19.920
Sounds made up completely.

05:19.920 --> 05:23.080
He was swiftly struck down, see what I did there?

05:23.080 --> 05:25.320
And then he went to the dark side.

05:25.320 --> 05:31.320
He went deep, deep into the core, the.NET core.

05:31.320 --> 05:39.480
Secretly, he was still talking to nature, to the pythons, to the vipers, to the pythons,

05:39.480 --> 05:46.560
and yet, slowly, the influence of that deep.NET core got to him.

05:46.560 --> 05:53.800
Then he came out, finding he had no mana, no gold, no rubies, and no crystal meth to

05:53.800 --> 05:54.800
sell.

05:54.800 --> 05:56.720
Have you heard of, I think it's Ximarin.

05:56.720 --> 05:57.720
Have you heard of this?

05:57.720 --> 05:58.720
I think you're going to like this.

05:58.720 --> 06:00.560
No, it's called Maui these days.

06:00.560 --> 06:03.560
Yeah, it is, actually.

06:03.560 --> 06:04.840
And now it's for all platforms.

06:04.840 --> 06:12.640
He looked at.NET and said, this is truly a dark sorcery, but version one, bad.

06:12.640 --> 06:14.520
Version two, terrible.

06:14.520 --> 06:17.160
Version three, questionable ethics.

06:17.160 --> 06:19.920
Version four, unforeseen consequences.

06:19.920 --> 06:22.620
Version five, the guilt of what we've done.

06:22.620 --> 06:25.540
But version six, this time will be different.

06:25.540 --> 06:27.520
So it goes with version six.

06:27.520 --> 06:37.400
This completely fictional gnome named Mikhail sold a bunch of.NET work because he's insane.

06:37.400 --> 06:39.680
I mean, because he's a very good advisor.

06:39.680 --> 06:40.680
I see.

06:40.680 --> 06:41.680
I see.

06:41.680 --> 06:44.680
So this is a complicated World of Warcraft plotline, I got to say.

06:44.680 --> 06:47.080
It's probably one of the more complicated ones I've ever heard of.

06:47.080 --> 06:53.000
But essentially, I guess this character who's totally made up and fictional, Mikhail, he

06:53.000 --> 06:57.500
is just feeling good about.NET 6 and decided, let's go out there and tell some people we

06:57.500 --> 06:58.500
can do this.

06:58.500 --> 07:01.000
And then somebody, what happened is somebody bit.

07:01.000 --> 07:03.080
I'm not sure that he's feeling good.

07:03.080 --> 07:10.000
I would describe this more as he was in a low place.

07:10.000 --> 07:17.480
You know, his rupees were down and a, I don't want to say void demon.

07:17.480 --> 07:20.200
You could say Microsoft, but I would say void demon.

07:20.200 --> 07:26.760
Or maybe, I don't know, principality from hell, maybe, if you know your Catholic school.

07:26.760 --> 07:31.880
Came to him and said, but my son, imagine using one language that is awfully familiar

07:31.880 --> 07:37.520
to C Sharp, if you remember the old Coco API, and writing everything.

07:37.520 --> 07:39.520
And also, you've been doing this for years.

07:39.520 --> 07:42.840
But this time, just sign this little contract.

07:42.840 --> 07:44.400
It's an open source agreement.

07:44.400 --> 07:46.660
It'll be fine.

07:46.660 --> 07:48.040
The hissing was weird.

07:48.040 --> 07:50.320
I felt like the snake jazz was a little much.

07:50.320 --> 07:51.320
Yeah.

07:51.320 --> 08:01.560
I mean, McHale felt the snake jazz so much, somehow, within 36 hours, he solved his booking

08:01.560 --> 08:02.560
problems.

08:02.560 --> 08:06.120
You know, this McHale guy, he's probably responsible for a lot of stuff.

08:06.120 --> 08:09.760
You know, I hear he spills drinks all the time on other people's laptops.

08:09.760 --> 08:12.200
Not even his own, but other people's laptops that are definitely not his.

08:12.200 --> 08:17.720
Well, again, in this deeply hypothetical world, the questionable morality of someone who would

08:17.720 --> 08:23.600
make a deal with the dot net core demons, obviously, that takes a toll on you psychologically.

08:23.600 --> 08:25.680
I can see that.

08:25.680 --> 08:26.680
So how do you recover?

08:26.680 --> 08:27.680
What do you do?

08:27.680 --> 08:28.680
Alcoholism, of course.

08:28.680 --> 08:29.680
I mean, oh, yeah.

08:29.680 --> 08:30.680
Okay.

08:30.680 --> 08:31.680
Okay.

08:31.680 --> 08:32.680
Well, that should take care of it.

08:32.680 --> 08:33.680
That's problem solved right there.

08:33.680 --> 08:38.840
Now, do you feel like maybe you and I should just dispense some advice because we got some

08:38.840 --> 08:40.120
emails into the show.

08:40.120 --> 08:42.800
Let's just give them some great advice.

08:42.800 --> 08:43.800
All right.

08:43.800 --> 08:45.920
So anonymous writes in.

08:45.920 --> 08:46.920
That's the spirit.

08:46.920 --> 08:47.920
Yep.

08:47.920 --> 08:53.360
My last contract job gave me a laptop and all my home office stuff.

08:53.360 --> 08:57.160
It's been over six months now, and they don't seem to want the laptop back.

08:57.160 --> 09:01.960
I started using the second display, but been thinking maybe I should image the laptop and

09:01.960 --> 09:03.800
start loading Linux on it.

09:03.800 --> 09:06.480
It's not mine, but the company doesn't seem to want it.

09:06.480 --> 09:07.480
And so I followed up.

09:07.480 --> 09:08.480
I sent him an email.

09:08.480 --> 09:10.160
I said, are you really sure they don't want it?

09:10.160 --> 09:15.440
And his response to me was, when I was on my way out the door, they said, we'll contact

09:15.440 --> 09:20.800
you probably in the future, but we never collected the laptop from the last guy.

09:20.800 --> 09:23.920
And then they sent him on his way with the laptop and he says the company buys him in

09:23.920 --> 09:25.680
three year leases.

09:25.680 --> 09:28.740
And so it's like, you know, almost on its second, it's on the second year of a three

09:28.740 --> 09:29.740
year lease.

09:29.740 --> 09:32.120
And he's wondering if, should he, what should he do with this laptop?

09:32.120 --> 09:34.880
Should he just leave in his closet and wait for the phone call?

09:34.880 --> 09:37.120
Should he call them up and say, Hey, I got this laptop.

09:37.120 --> 09:38.960
Are you sure you're never going to collect this thing?

09:38.960 --> 09:42.240
Which they would almost inevitably say, oh yeah, of course, send it to us.

09:42.240 --> 09:48.320
Or should he try to back it up somehow, image it and start using it as like a test machine?

09:48.320 --> 09:49.320
What would you do?

09:49.320 --> 09:50.320
Hmm.

09:50.320 --> 09:53.000
I, again, I need, I need Mr. King.

09:53.000 --> 09:54.000
Good thing.

09:54.000 --> 09:55.000
He's here.

09:55.000 --> 09:56.520
Stay a while and listen.

09:56.520 --> 09:59.280
So I want to recite for you.

09:59.280 --> 10:04.920
Let's just say, but some generous edits, the story of Aladdin, a young man from somewhere

10:04.920 --> 10:05.920
in the desert.

10:05.920 --> 10:06.920
I really don't know.

10:06.920 --> 10:08.220
Let's just say Baghdad.

10:08.220 --> 10:11.740
And he got a laptop from his then employer.

10:11.740 --> 10:13.640
They didn't care for six months.

10:13.640 --> 10:15.440
He wrote some IP on it.

10:15.440 --> 10:17.200
And then they're like, well, technically that's our machine.

10:17.200 --> 10:18.760
We own the IP.

10:18.760 --> 10:24.520
That laptop goes in a special box where top men take care of it.

10:24.520 --> 10:26.940
If you, again, Indiana Jones, right?

10:26.940 --> 10:27.940
Do not touch it.

10:27.940 --> 10:28.940
Do not use it.

10:28.940 --> 10:29.940
Do not format it.

10:29.940 --> 10:33.120
You put it in a little box and you never ever touch it.

10:33.120 --> 10:34.120
Oh really?

10:34.120 --> 10:35.120
Hmm.

10:35.120 --> 10:36.120
By your own.

10:36.120 --> 10:37.120
Here's the thing.

10:37.120 --> 10:40.560
And I think this is being colored because I have had this happen to me several times.

10:40.560 --> 10:45.320
You know, like work provided machine or client provided machine or, or whatever, a review

10:45.320 --> 10:46.480
unit.

10:46.480 --> 10:50.040
And I, I sent him an email, said, like, I'm ready to send it back, you know, give me the

10:50.040 --> 10:52.100
shipping label and it'll be off.

10:52.100 --> 10:55.780
And I never hear from them and I'll follow up and I never hear from them.

10:55.780 --> 10:56.780
And it just sits there.

10:56.780 --> 11:00.480
And I always think to myself, I should be doing something with that.

11:00.480 --> 11:03.400
I have a machine here right now that I need to send back.

11:03.400 --> 11:04.400
And it's that same situation.

11:04.400 --> 11:07.060
And I think to myself, I should do something with that.

11:07.060 --> 11:10.540
But then I feel guilty and I'm like, I can't, I can't even just play around with it because

11:10.540 --> 11:11.840
you know, it's not mine.

11:11.840 --> 11:16.520
If you work hard on your own IP and let's forget if you're an open source IP, whatever,

11:16.520 --> 11:18.900
but actually you still have the same concern.

11:18.900 --> 11:22.840
You don't want that stupid liability because you wouldn't spend a thousand dollars or even

11:22.840 --> 11:24.780
use the laptop you have at home.

11:24.780 --> 11:25.820
Not worth it.

11:25.820 --> 11:27.000
It's never worth it.

11:27.000 --> 11:28.420
Put it in a box.

11:28.420 --> 11:29.420
Forget about it.

11:29.420 --> 11:30.960
Like the one ring of Saran.

11:30.960 --> 11:31.960
Hang on now.

11:31.960 --> 11:32.960
I'm going to be invisible for a few minutes.

11:32.960 --> 11:37.280
You know, he may just want to use it for a learning GNOME 40.

11:37.280 --> 11:38.920
Maybe he's not writing in the apps.

11:38.920 --> 11:39.920
Maybe he's not doing.

11:39.920 --> 11:42.120
Format it because that's their data.

11:42.120 --> 11:43.560
You do nothing.

11:43.560 --> 11:44.840
Don't touch it.

11:44.840 --> 11:50.120
Treat it like the angry nun at Catholic school that was kind of hot, but you, you wait, oh,

11:50.120 --> 11:51.720
this is Mikhail talking again.

11:51.720 --> 11:54.520
You can tell he's got a slightly different voice, you know, different cadence too.

11:54.520 --> 11:55.520
And so you could talk.

11:55.520 --> 11:56.520
I could totally tell.

11:56.520 --> 11:57.520
I'm glad you're back though.

11:57.520 --> 11:58.520
I'm no, no, it's Mike.

11:58.520 --> 11:59.520
So I'm glad Mike's back.

11:59.520 --> 12:00.520
Cause Mike was just telling us that was Mikhail.

12:00.520 --> 12:01.520
So obviously Mike's back now.

12:01.520 --> 12:02.520
I'm so confused.

12:02.520 --> 12:03.520
Yeah.

12:03.520 --> 12:04.520
Seriously.

12:04.520 --> 12:05.520
You know what?

12:05.520 --> 12:06.520
I don't agree with you, Chris.

12:06.520 --> 12:07.520
He should do nothing.

12:07.520 --> 12:08.520
No, you're right.

12:08.520 --> 12:09.520
You're no, you're absolutely right.

12:09.520 --> 12:10.520
You're saying the right thing.

12:10.520 --> 12:13.120
I just, I know where he's at, but I think you're probably right.

12:13.120 --> 12:16.200
And if they don't want to, if they don't want to back, how nice of a computer could it actually

12:16.200 --> 12:17.200
be?

12:17.200 --> 12:21.680
Well, they leased it and they're really forking over the leasing company, but that leasing

12:21.680 --> 12:23.840
company also would have rights to anything on the laptop.

12:23.840 --> 12:28.460
So it, this is a, this is a, no, you're just tripping into a harness.

12:28.460 --> 12:29.460
Don't touch it.

12:29.460 --> 12:31.260
What's the statute of limitations though?

12:31.260 --> 12:33.400
Five years go by and this thing's still in his closet.

12:33.400 --> 12:38.120
At what point does he just say, you know what, I'm going to clone this hard drive or I'm

12:38.120 --> 12:41.760
just going to physically remove the hard drive and put a new hard drive blank disc in.

12:41.760 --> 12:44.200
I'll put this one on the shelf and I'm going to start using it.

12:44.200 --> 12:45.200
Like at what point?

12:45.200 --> 12:46.200
What's the statute of limitations on this?

12:46.200 --> 12:48.320
I mean, at that point you have a five year old machine.

12:48.320 --> 12:50.520
You've put a new hard drive in at your expense.

12:50.520 --> 12:53.120
You could just buy a new laptop and get a much better machine.

12:53.120 --> 12:55.280
I mean, that's like silly fraud, right?

12:55.280 --> 12:56.280
Like you're right.

12:56.280 --> 12:57.280
You're no, yeah.

12:57.280 --> 12:58.280
Okay.

12:58.280 --> 12:59.280
So there's really no way around it.

12:59.280 --> 13:03.300
I, what I would probably do then is I would get ahold of them again and remind them once

13:03.300 --> 13:07.120
again and just get this thing out of here, which is what I always actually end up doing

13:07.120 --> 13:10.240
is I always just end up playing the email game tag.

13:10.240 --> 13:11.240
You're it.

13:11.240 --> 13:12.240
You know, that kind of thing.

13:12.240 --> 13:15.400
I put them in cold storage because that's very scary for them, but we could talk about

13:15.400 --> 13:16.400
that later.

13:16.400 --> 13:18.980
I mean, McHale puts them in cold storage, right?

13:18.980 --> 13:21.660
You would never, we got an update from Matt.

13:21.660 --> 13:26.200
Now you might not remember Matt, but Matt, uh, he had, uh, he had a tale of woe and you

13:26.200 --> 13:27.880
had one piece of advice for him.

13:27.880 --> 13:28.880
Get a hobby.

13:28.880 --> 13:29.880
And you told him to get a hobby.

13:29.880 --> 13:30.880
Did I?

13:30.880 --> 13:31.880
Yeah.

13:31.880 --> 13:35.980
Matt wrote in good day, Mike and Chris, I wrote in a little while ago lamenting over

13:35.980 --> 13:40.200
my current situation with work, feeling like I'm in a rut and having lost my motivation

13:40.200 --> 13:41.400
for it.

13:41.400 --> 13:42.680
And yes, Mike was right.

13:42.680 --> 13:43.680
It's mostly SharePoint.

13:43.680 --> 13:44.680
I work with.

13:44.680 --> 13:45.680
So one point to him.

13:45.680 --> 13:46.680
Stop right there.

13:46.680 --> 13:47.680
Stop right there.

13:47.680 --> 13:49.480
There was a very important part of that sentence.

13:49.480 --> 13:50.480
Mike was right.

13:50.480 --> 13:52.440
Listeners, you know what to clip.

13:52.440 --> 13:53.520
You know what it is.

13:53.520 --> 13:54.520
Mike got lucky.

13:54.520 --> 13:56.920
That's what it was.

13:56.920 --> 13:57.920
That's what they're going to clip.

13:57.920 --> 13:58.920
You son of a.

13:58.920 --> 14:00.080
No, you, you did totally call it.

14:00.080 --> 14:01.080
It was SharePoint.

14:01.080 --> 14:02.080
I remember that.

14:02.080 --> 14:03.320
And I remember agreeing with you at the time.

14:03.320 --> 14:07.240
Uh, he also thinks everybody who wrote in to kind of chat with him a little bit via

14:07.240 --> 14:08.240
the show.

14:08.240 --> 14:09.240
I love this.

14:09.240 --> 14:10.240
I love that.

14:10.240 --> 14:11.240
I'm really glad that Matt wrote in and gave us an update too.

14:11.240 --> 14:12.680
Cause I was wondering how he was doing.

14:12.680 --> 14:15.000
He says, I guess I had lost my way a little bit.

14:15.000 --> 14:19.360
I'd essentially automated myself out of having to babysit the systems that I supported and

14:19.360 --> 14:21.720
well, everything just works.

14:21.720 --> 14:25.120
Sure I'd have the standard monthly stuff to get done, like updates and patching, but it

14:25.120 --> 14:28.520
all basically just tells me when there's something I need to care about.

14:28.520 --> 14:29.640
And you're right.

14:29.640 --> 14:31.920
And when you guys are right, you are right.

14:31.920 --> 14:33.240
Hobbies is where it's at.

14:33.240 --> 14:37.800
Some ago I tried to get into rust development and wrote an RSS alert to watch feeds and

14:37.800 --> 14:41.320
get a notification using pushover when it contains certain keywords.

14:41.320 --> 14:45.120
That was fun, but I wanted to turn it into desktop GUI application.

14:45.120 --> 14:48.140
And well, I just kind of gave up at that point.

14:48.140 --> 14:52.900
The closest I got was using GTK RS, but it just felt clunky and it seemed like half the

14:52.900 --> 14:56.880
time some of the GTK bindings weren't really even working yet.

14:56.880 --> 14:57.880
It's more than half.

14:57.880 --> 14:58.880
But yeah.

14:58.880 --> 14:59.880
Savage.

14:59.880 --> 15:00.880
You burn GTK RS.

15:00.880 --> 15:01.880
You burned.

15:01.880 --> 15:03.640
I decided to properly give Python a go.

15:03.640 --> 15:07.120
For some reason I've avoided it in the past, but it's been really fun.

15:07.120 --> 15:08.600
Python has been around for so long.

15:08.600 --> 15:10.880
There seems to be an answer to just about everything.

15:10.880 --> 15:14.640
I'm currently using open CV to do a bunch of stuff and it's been awesome.

15:14.640 --> 15:17.540
At some point I'll return to rust because I have an idea for an app that will probably

15:17.540 --> 15:20.080
make me about 75 a year.

15:20.080 --> 15:24.000
I think he's trying to go for that Thalia there, but also it's mostly because rust seems

15:24.000 --> 15:25.560
to have a pretty big future.

15:25.560 --> 15:26.560
Thanks again.

15:26.560 --> 15:27.560
Love your work.

15:27.560 --> 15:28.560
Matt.

15:28.560 --> 15:32.080
That's a super big thank you, Matt, for taking the time to write in and follow up on how

15:32.080 --> 15:33.280
you're doing.

15:33.280 --> 15:36.640
I hope things continue in that direction for you.

15:36.640 --> 15:40.440
When you do write that app that's going to make you $75,000 to win that Thalia, you let

15:40.440 --> 15:41.560
us know.

15:41.560 --> 15:44.840
I think he meant $75.

15:44.840 --> 15:46.440
Still nobody's claimed it yet.

15:46.440 --> 15:47.440
Hang on.

15:47.440 --> 15:48.440
We're betting a robe here.

15:48.440 --> 15:49.440
Are you ready?

15:49.440 --> 15:50.440
Okay.

15:50.440 --> 15:51.440
These are precious items now.

15:51.440 --> 15:52.440
It's your problem.

15:52.440 --> 15:54.600
You're the idiot who said he was going to make robes.

15:54.600 --> 15:55.600
I know.

15:55.600 --> 15:56.600
I know.

15:56.600 --> 15:57.600
I know.

15:57.600 --> 16:04.440
If you win more than $10,000 US, living in the United States with a job on a desktop

16:04.440 --> 16:07.040
Linux app, I will buy you a robe.

16:07.040 --> 16:08.040
There you go.

16:08.040 --> 16:10.840
I think this is a third robe bet, and let me tell you something.

16:10.840 --> 16:14.920
This is like betting on the Chicago fans here.

16:14.920 --> 16:16.160
We don't want to do that.

16:16.160 --> 16:18.380
We're doing robe future trading is what we're doing right now.

16:18.380 --> 16:20.380
We're doing robe futures.

16:20.380 --> 16:24.200
I'm pretty sure I have a bunch of Slack messages from you saying, I'm never going to do this

16:24.200 --> 16:25.200
again.

16:25.200 --> 16:26.200
This was a goddamn nightmare.

16:26.200 --> 16:27.200
What the...

16:27.200 --> 16:29.440
By the way, I enjoyed my beer this afternoon.

16:29.440 --> 16:30.440
Oh yeah?

16:30.440 --> 16:31.440
In your stein?

16:31.440 --> 16:32.440
At 10 in the morning.

16:32.440 --> 16:33.920
Let me tell you something.

16:33.920 --> 16:39.480
The only silver lining on the robe is I have gotten my game down.

16:39.480 --> 16:44.600
We have taken like 300 orders now through the Jupiter garage, and we're shipping stuff

16:44.600 --> 16:47.440
out nearly daily, and we're rocking it.

16:47.440 --> 16:51.400
That LUP stein, that Linux unplugged stein, that's some quality stuff there.

16:51.400 --> 16:52.400
I know.

16:52.400 --> 16:53.400
I know.

16:53.400 --> 16:54.400
It's great.

16:54.400 --> 16:56.520
I feel like the robe was kind of your alpha, and I'm a little pissed off actually.

16:56.520 --> 16:57.520
Yeah.

16:57.520 --> 17:02.520
Well, it was like literally jumping into the deep end, and what I didn't appreciate too

17:02.520 --> 17:07.440
is that supply chains have been screwed up this year as well, which now I have a sense

17:07.440 --> 17:12.440
of, and now I have an idea of what companies to work with and which ones to avoid, but

17:12.440 --> 17:14.240
that was just all new territory for me before.

17:14.240 --> 17:15.240
Yeah.

17:15.240 --> 17:19.000
No, but I think it's time for some hashtag robe justice.

17:19.000 --> 17:22.000
Is that like mob justice, but for robes?

17:22.000 --> 17:25.760
It's all of the Coderadio road people are going to march on Lady Jeeps.

17:25.760 --> 17:29.000
Now, good thing she's mobile because that's going to be very hard for her.

17:29.000 --> 17:32.600
I better get like a push bar on the front so I can just mow people down.

17:32.600 --> 17:34.760
I'm going to just throw LUP steins at you.

17:34.760 --> 17:37.240
That's the plan.

17:37.240 --> 17:43.860
I've sold, get this, two network attached storages in five days through the Jupiter

17:43.860 --> 17:44.860
garage store.

17:44.860 --> 17:52.960
A free NAS, and then Alex sold a Helios arm device because what I've done is I've set

17:52.960 --> 17:57.440
up like this garage sale concept and I'm selling out all of the old swag archives that we have

17:57.440 --> 18:02.560
because we still have stuff from the old shows like last and stuff that are like really valuable

18:02.560 --> 18:08.320
and that I thought this is my opportunity to learn how to do fulfillment domestically

18:08.320 --> 18:13.400
and internationally with items I already have in stock that I'd like to clear out to make

18:13.400 --> 18:14.720
room for future inventory.

18:14.720 --> 18:17.400
Aren't you a real basic swag?

18:17.400 --> 18:20.960
Oh yeah, yeah.

18:20.960 --> 18:23.440
Just with Lunduk's face on it and like the real basic logo.

18:23.440 --> 18:26.160
I was like, oh, that's you, not me.

18:26.160 --> 18:28.760
I shall not dunk another JB host.

18:28.760 --> 18:31.040
I knew where you were going with that.

18:31.040 --> 18:33.400
Oh my God.

18:33.400 --> 18:37.000
Mike has some feelings about what are real programming platforms and what aren't.

18:37.000 --> 18:42.040
But you know, like it really worked out as a clever way to do it with something that

18:42.040 --> 18:47.440
we already had that meant, because what I realized is I need to be in more control of

18:47.440 --> 18:48.440
the fulfillment.

18:48.440 --> 18:51.920
And that was the biggest mistake here.

18:51.920 --> 18:53.160
But I don't have any idea what I'm doing.

18:53.160 --> 18:56.360
I don't have any idea how to figure out how to build things for shipping.

18:56.360 --> 19:00.200
We're figuring all of that now and we're doing a pretty good job of it.

19:00.200 --> 19:05.920
So I feel like that's the silver lining of the robe outcome is that like as a business

19:05.920 --> 19:09.480
now, which we don't talk about super often on that side, but as a business, we're starting

19:09.480 --> 19:13.880
to take it a lot more seriously and we've started to get our game figured out and dialed

19:13.880 --> 19:14.880
in.

19:14.880 --> 19:19.360
And the moment we put stuff up, the free NAS sold in three minutes.

19:19.360 --> 19:20.360
Jesus Christ.

19:20.360 --> 19:21.360
Yeah.

19:21.360 --> 19:24.280
Alex's NAS sold in 20 minutes.

19:24.280 --> 19:27.760
The swag bags, the moment I put them up on the garage, they sell.

19:27.760 --> 19:33.580
And you know, these are just like random swag bags of like stickers and sometimes shirts

19:33.580 --> 19:34.580
and just...

19:34.580 --> 19:35.580
Hook a brother up.

19:35.580 --> 19:36.580
Yeah.

19:36.580 --> 19:37.580
Okay.

19:37.580 --> 19:38.580
Yeah.

19:38.580 --> 19:39.580
I will make a note.

19:39.580 --> 19:40.580
I totally should.

19:40.580 --> 19:41.560
And I'm also putting like postcards in there with like a little thank you note on there

19:41.560 --> 19:44.180
because sometimes people leave little notes in their orders.

19:44.180 --> 19:47.540
And that whole thing, it's been like the last three weeks that I've been doing this.

19:47.540 --> 19:51.720
That whole thing has been every lesson I've got burned on the robe, I took and I applied

19:51.720 --> 19:56.140
to this system that we're doing, one of the whole rooms in the studio has been completely

19:56.140 --> 20:01.320
transformed into like a swag bag, a ship and package operation room.

20:01.320 --> 20:02.320
It's funny.

20:02.320 --> 20:04.300
I have a trailer that's been transformed into something too.

20:04.300 --> 20:09.120
Me and my good friend Walter really breaking it out.

20:09.120 --> 20:13.440
I hope it means now that as a business, I've got my S figured out and it's something like

20:13.440 --> 20:18.620
I can just now execute on a regular basis and not have these huge cock ups like before.

20:18.620 --> 20:21.180
I have so many questions.

20:21.180 --> 20:23.800
How do you not screw up the trademarks all the time?

20:23.800 --> 20:25.060
Like that is my Achilles heel.

20:25.060 --> 20:27.140
I get hammered on trademarks.

20:27.140 --> 20:30.900
West Paints as he confirms their studio is now a post office extension.

20:30.900 --> 20:32.740
Do you guys get a pension?

20:32.740 --> 20:35.340
Wait, do you guys get like a federal pension now?

20:35.340 --> 20:39.420
You hire a thousand monkeys as your lawyer and then one of the monkeys gets it right.

20:39.420 --> 20:40.420
You know what?

20:40.420 --> 20:42.940
I often think I don't have a very good lawyer.

20:42.940 --> 20:43.940
A good lawyer.

20:43.940 --> 20:44.940
Really?

20:44.940 --> 20:48.300
That's something like when I was younger, I thought was not a good thing to spend money

20:48.300 --> 20:49.300
on.

20:49.300 --> 20:52.780
And now that I'm older, I feel like that was that was like that was a key part in getting

20:52.780 --> 20:54.260
the company to go independent again.

20:54.260 --> 20:58.780
And all of that was a good legal team because I'm going to like I'm supposed to be doing

20:58.780 --> 21:01.300
those coder name.

21:01.300 --> 21:02.300
I can't say.

21:02.300 --> 21:05.860
Yeah, it turns out there's a company with the same name and wasn't too thrilled.

21:05.860 --> 21:09.100
A couple of other employees happened to listen to JB.

21:09.100 --> 21:11.740
You know, I'd never worked with lawyers at the scale I worked with.

21:11.740 --> 21:16.660
I had I think at one point, I don't I think I can say I think at one point three or four,

21:16.660 --> 21:20.740
I think I had four lawyers working for me.

21:20.740 --> 21:23.960
And I've never done anything like that where I've actually had a whole team.

21:23.960 --> 21:30.060
And that is extremely expensive, you know, like pay it off for a very long time kind

21:30.060 --> 21:31.140
of expensive.

21:31.140 --> 21:36.800
But they are they were very, very thorough, extremely thorough and very helpful.

21:36.800 --> 21:40.240
And I realized it was it was essential to getting everything, you know, to basically

21:40.240 --> 21:45.720
rebooting a business from something that was merged to then be independent again and re

21:45.720 --> 21:49.760
separating out all the IP and all of that was just this massive task.

21:49.760 --> 21:52.960
And to show some teeth that like you couldn't just get rolled.

21:52.960 --> 21:57.660
Well, there's that and and and not to speak for the other party, but the other party really

21:57.660 --> 22:00.860
isn't interested in dealing with some guy, you know, there it's it's a legal team on

22:00.860 --> 22:01.860
their side, too.

22:01.860 --> 22:04.980
And that's they're more interested in interfacing with lawyers directly.

22:04.980 --> 22:07.180
That's just how they prefer to do it, too.

22:07.180 --> 22:08.800
And to make sure all the bases are covered.

22:08.800 --> 22:13.620
So yeah, so I guess it kind of makes me now I kind of laugh because I was going to say

22:13.620 --> 22:15.940
this next email is about a super expensive item.

22:15.940 --> 22:22.020
But then when I think about it in the terms of my lawyer bill, this is a teeny tiny drop

22:22.020 --> 22:23.100
in the bucket with this.

22:23.100 --> 22:27.500
So Mikel writes and no, it's actually Listener Michael writes in and he's following up on

22:27.500 --> 22:32.460
your your kind of request for feedback on the AirPod Max's.

22:32.460 --> 22:36.940
Get this and this kind of unfortunate thing, but it led the silver lining is he sent us

22:36.940 --> 22:37.940
an email.

22:37.940 --> 22:43.020
He said I had to fly, unfortunately, from California to Texas for a family emergency

22:43.020 --> 22:46.300
the same day that episode four hundred and ten was released last week's episode.

22:46.300 --> 22:47.300
I'm sorry.

22:47.300 --> 22:48.300
Yeah.

22:48.300 --> 22:52.820
He says a day ahead of the trip, I purchased the AirPod Max's or how do you say it?

22:52.820 --> 22:53.820
I purchased AirPod Max.

22:53.820 --> 22:54.820
I'm not sure how.

22:54.820 --> 22:57.300
No, I thought it was plural.

22:57.300 --> 22:58.300
Isn't it not plural?

22:58.300 --> 23:00.140
They always say AirPod or iPhone.

23:00.140 --> 23:01.140
They never say I don't know.

23:01.140 --> 23:02.140
But there's two.

23:02.140 --> 23:03.140
All right, whatever.

23:03.140 --> 23:04.140
Let's just move on.

23:04.140 --> 23:05.140
It's stupid.

23:05.140 --> 23:07.900
But it's it's when you read it out loud, you're like, how am I actually supposed to say this?

23:07.900 --> 23:13.940
Also, side note, often a trip is a just is my justification for getting a new piece of

23:13.940 --> 23:14.940
gear as well.

23:14.940 --> 23:18.540
So I'm right there with you on that one, Michael.

23:18.540 --> 23:22.820
So he decided to buy himself the AirPod Max's or AirPods Max.

23:22.820 --> 23:23.820
That's probably how you say it, right?

23:23.820 --> 23:31.080
AirPods Max to enjoy a bubble of tranquility, he says, hoping that maybe the fellow passengers

23:31.080 --> 23:33.640
around him were not creating a tube of death.

23:33.640 --> 23:38.680
The sound isolation, he has to say, on the AirPod Max's was totally canceled out one

23:38.680 --> 23:40.660
hundred percent of the airplane noise.

23:40.660 --> 23:44.420
I didn't find it particularly hot or uncomfortable, didn't really cause any sweat accumulation

23:44.420 --> 23:46.500
over the couple of hours of usage.

23:46.500 --> 23:50.280
California to Texas is what, two and a half, three hour flight?

23:50.280 --> 23:54.380
It was my first time watching a movie with spatial audio, and it really added an extra

23:54.380 --> 23:56.060
level to the experience.

23:56.060 --> 23:59.020
After six hours of usage, the battery is still at sixty six percent.

23:59.020 --> 24:02.900
So unlike the AirPods Pro and performing the single pod charging dance here, I know you

24:02.900 --> 24:07.420
where you swap out the one pod at a time, these batteries last all day.

24:07.420 --> 24:09.980
Is it worth six hundred dollars after tax?

24:09.980 --> 24:15.660
I haven't had over-the-ear headphones since 2010 when my Bose QC2 died.

24:15.660 --> 24:20.940
So not being a place to really replace anything else or compare, I feel like I like them quite

24:20.940 --> 24:21.940
a bit.

24:21.940 --> 24:23.940
I feel okay about them.

24:23.940 --> 24:25.820
So there you go, Mike.

24:25.820 --> 24:27.180
He feels okay about them.

24:27.180 --> 24:30.220
I think he's still a little sour about the cost, but functionally they worked pretty

24:30.220 --> 24:31.980
well for traveling.

24:31.980 --> 24:34.340
So there you go, now you have a justification to pick some up.

24:34.340 --> 24:38.060
No, I'm going all Windows these days, so I'm getting the Surface Pods.

24:38.060 --> 24:40.700
Right, you gotta get those Surface, the Surface ones.

24:40.700 --> 24:42.420
Wait, is that a real thing?

24:42.420 --> 24:44.780
I think they do have a pair of headphones.

24:44.780 --> 24:48.260
I was making a joke that they just copy Apple, but Jesus, really?

24:48.260 --> 24:49.940
Yeah, yeah, I think they do.

24:49.940 --> 24:51.700
Did I accidentally slam Microsoft?

24:51.700 --> 24:52.780
And I really don't mean to.

24:52.780 --> 24:54.900
I'm sorry, Beelzebub, I apologize.

24:54.900 --> 24:58.820
Yeah, hey, if you're doing, if you're going all in on the.NET, how come you didn't get

24:58.820 --> 25:01.020
a Surface Book?

25:01.020 --> 25:04.220
For the kind of ThinkPad money you just dropped on that carbon, you could probably get yourself

25:04.220 --> 25:05.940
a pretty nice Surface Book.

25:05.940 --> 25:07.740
Do you want the joke reason or the real reason?

25:07.740 --> 25:08.740
Well, I both, I suppose.

25:08.740 --> 25:11.420
No, I want to know why, because they seem like they're decent computers now.

25:11.420 --> 25:12.420
That keyboard.

25:12.420 --> 25:15.260
Oh yeah, yeah.

25:15.260 --> 25:20.160
It's better than happiness or positive forward goals in your life.

25:20.160 --> 25:23.260
That keyboard is what dreams are made of.

25:23.260 --> 25:24.260
Yeah.

25:24.260 --> 25:25.900
It's the Maltese Falcon of keyboards.

25:25.900 --> 25:26.900
Okay.

25:26.900 --> 25:32.180
I mean, I think they've actually gotten worse over the years myself, but they still are

25:32.180 --> 25:33.980
coming from a place of being pretty good.

25:33.980 --> 25:37.980
This is where Chris is trying to figure, is Mike joking, or is he going psycho?

25:37.980 --> 25:41.260
No, I mean, I agree they're good keyboards, so.

25:41.260 --> 25:45.940
Well, I'm assuming it's as good as the other Lenovo that is going to one of my employees,

25:45.940 --> 25:46.940
right?

25:46.940 --> 25:52.780
Now, if it is not, believe me, there will be hours of coverage on this one keyboard.

25:52.780 --> 25:57.460
Special breaking edition of the Koda radio program, breaking midweek with a special edition

25:57.460 --> 25:58.820
just to cover the keyboard.

25:58.820 --> 26:06.380
I will fly to China and probably get shot, but I will fly to China to scold the keyboard

26:06.380 --> 26:07.540
engineer.

26:07.540 --> 26:09.060
Could you imagine flying for that long?

26:09.060 --> 26:11.020
I just, people that do that, you're like.

26:11.020 --> 26:12.160
For a bad keyboard?

26:12.160 --> 26:13.940
People that can fly for that long are a different breed.

26:13.940 --> 26:14.940
I just couldn't do it.

26:14.940 --> 26:18.340
I could do anything to scold someone ruining the ThinkPad keyboard.

26:18.340 --> 26:22.180
Yeah, I guess, when you got a passion project like that.

26:22.180 --> 26:24.460
No, no, no, no, no, I stop.

26:24.460 --> 26:27.180
I am like the Liam Neeson of keyboards, OK?

26:27.180 --> 26:28.780
You have a certain set of skills.

26:28.780 --> 26:29.780
I have no skills.

26:29.780 --> 26:31.780
I'm just a maniac.

26:31.780 --> 26:37.140
Oh, OK, so you're like Liam Neeson with no skills.

26:37.140 --> 26:38.140
None.

26:38.140 --> 26:45.100
I can barely zip my fly, but if they ruin my favorite keyboard, all of a sudden I become

26:45.100 --> 26:46.140
Ra's al Ghul.

26:46.140 --> 26:49.420
I heard the news that ThinkPad, the ThinkPad keyboard's coming out with this new design

26:49.420 --> 26:51.460
called the, I think it's called the butterfly keyboard.

26:51.460 --> 26:52.460
You're going to love it.

26:52.460 --> 26:57.020
I have never heard a more hateful piece of content on my life to it is going to ban us

26:57.020 --> 26:58.020
for hate speech.

26:58.020 --> 27:00.860
I think I'm going to say I'm going to call Tim and that's it.

27:00.860 --> 27:01.860
We're off.

27:01.860 --> 27:02.860
We're done.

27:02.860 --> 27:05.340
The whole of J.B. is gone because you had to say that slur, man.

27:05.340 --> 27:08.660
There goes that new podcast membership deal that I was working with them on, although

27:08.660 --> 27:13.340
you know that Apple really is like settling butterfly lawsuits now, right?

27:13.340 --> 27:14.620
Yeah, that's true.

27:14.620 --> 27:15.620
We should.

27:15.620 --> 27:16.620
We should come up with them.

27:16.620 --> 27:17.940
Maybe that'd be a good like finance strategy for the show.

27:17.940 --> 27:25.300
I have enough of them if they can only ignore the very obvious liquid damage.

27:25.300 --> 27:27.260
Linode.com slash coder.

27:27.260 --> 27:30.460
You know, Linode is the largest independent cloud computing provider.

27:30.460 --> 27:34.900
They've been around since 2003 and they have focused on making their product fantastic.

27:34.900 --> 27:37.660
They're easy to use and they have a powerful cloud dashboard.

27:37.660 --> 27:42.740
I talk about their servers a lot because we use the snot out of Linode servers.

27:42.740 --> 27:48.300
I generally deploy on their East Coast and their Texas server and for my personal stuff

27:48.300 --> 27:52.740
I deploy in California, but they've actually got 11 data centers around the world.

27:52.740 --> 27:54.060
Super fast connections.

27:54.060 --> 27:55.060
Really fast.

27:55.060 --> 27:57.500
Years ago, Linode became their own ISP.

27:57.500 --> 28:01.220
By the way, just kind of like a side advantage of being around forever on the internet and

28:01.220 --> 28:06.720
before AWS even started is you can do things like you become your own ISP.

28:06.720 --> 28:10.260
They're just doing the stuff that makes their service even better, whatever it takes.

28:10.260 --> 28:16.460
And one of the things I love that can change your game is their simple one click application

28:16.460 --> 28:17.580
deployments.

28:17.580 --> 28:22.380
If you want to just get something up and running really quick with a great default setup, maybe

28:22.380 --> 28:26.320
it's just a base system with containers that are ready to go and then you'll just go pull

28:26.320 --> 28:27.980
down the containers you want specifically.

28:27.980 --> 28:29.500
Or maybe you want the full stack.

28:29.500 --> 28:32.140
They've got a whole bunch to choose from.

28:32.140 --> 28:37.220
Also they've got some personal systems like gaming systems and file sync systems that

28:37.220 --> 28:38.860
you might just want to use for yourself.

28:38.860 --> 28:43.040
And with their whole range of prices, and they're generally 30 to 50% cheaper than the

28:43.040 --> 28:46.560
other cloud providers out there, there's something that's going to work for you.

28:46.560 --> 28:51.060
So go get that $100 credit by going to linode.com slash coder.

28:51.060 --> 28:52.540
Go sign up for a new account.

28:52.540 --> 28:53.540
Go to that URL.

28:53.540 --> 28:57.460
Get the credit and try it out for 60 days because there's a lot to do, including S3

28:57.460 --> 29:01.220
compatible object storage, which could be a great way to do some configuration backup

29:01.220 --> 29:03.500
to the cloud or run a static website.

29:03.500 --> 29:05.380
There's a lot you can do there.

29:05.380 --> 29:09.700
And you can try it all out in their really easy to use dashboard.

29:09.700 --> 29:10.700
It's simple.

29:10.700 --> 29:11.700
It's powerful.

29:11.700 --> 29:12.700
And you're going to love it.

29:12.700 --> 29:13.700
It's just one thing you got to do.

29:13.700 --> 29:16.120
You just got to go to linode.com slash coder.

29:16.120 --> 29:22.260
Get that $100 in 60 day credit and of course you support the show.

29:22.260 --> 29:25.260
Linode is dedicated to offering the best in virtualized cloud computing.

29:25.260 --> 29:31.900
So go to linode.com slash coder, support the show and get that $100.

29:31.900 --> 29:35.980
What do you think about covering this question we got on Twitter?

29:35.980 --> 29:41.960
And it really comes down to why is recruitment in tech just such a fricking disaster?

29:41.960 --> 29:45.580
We had somebody, Henry Tweedis, he says, I was recently brought into a firm.

29:45.580 --> 29:50.620
I was told by the CTO during hiring that I was going to be the sole developer and I'd

29:50.620 --> 29:52.380
have free choice of technology.

29:52.380 --> 29:56.900
Now I learned that they're telling me to use node plus express plus Mongo monoliths.

29:56.900 --> 29:57.900
Why oh why?

29:57.900 --> 30:04.180
Well, I'm sorry, I wasn't listening until I heard node and Mongo and then I, my heart

30:04.180 --> 30:06.700
literally stopped and I started bleeding.

30:06.700 --> 30:09.540
Have you ever seen the exorcism of Emily Rose?

30:09.540 --> 30:11.620
You're all with the stories and movies tonight.

30:11.620 --> 30:13.760
Yeah, that's a, that's a lot of blood, man.

30:13.760 --> 30:15.660
That's a, we don't start on time.

30:15.660 --> 30:17.380
I just really lose control.

30:17.380 --> 30:22.200
Yeah, no, just, um, well if you need the money, take the money, but understand that when you're

30:22.200 --> 30:25.660
writing node, you're doing a bad thing.

30:25.660 --> 30:29.460
When you're using Mongo DB, definitely questionable.

30:29.460 --> 30:32.940
When you're doing both at the same time, it feels like a, he got a little bait and switch

30:32.940 --> 30:33.940
eh?

30:33.940 --> 30:37.700
Well of course, because no good developer would volunteer for that job, right?

30:37.700 --> 30:40.660
Don't tell him no, cause you're trying to get me to say something crazy, which I will

30:40.660 --> 30:41.660
gladly do.

30:41.660 --> 30:43.540
Would you like to be a guard at Stalag 13?

30:43.540 --> 30:45.700
No, I don't think so.

30:45.700 --> 30:48.220
Would you like to be an officer in our, in our military?

30:48.220 --> 30:49.220
Yes.

30:49.220 --> 30:50.220
Congratulations.

30:50.220 --> 30:51.220
You're the commandant.

30:51.220 --> 30:52.220
No, that's bad.

30:52.220 --> 30:54.860
See, I wasn't sure if you were going to take the route of, of course he should just do

30:54.860 --> 30:57.940
whatever they want because he took the job, but you're right, they totally bait and switched

30:57.940 --> 30:58.940
him.

30:58.940 --> 31:01.100
There are certain things we don't do for money.

31:01.100 --> 31:03.460
One of them is JavaScript on the server.

31:03.460 --> 31:05.100
I know we've talked about this.

31:05.100 --> 31:06.100
I should know better.

31:06.100 --> 31:09.740
And I, I've spent between the shelf where we are 13 theory at.

31:09.740 --> 31:12.140
I think it's like our hundredth year, man.

31:12.140 --> 31:13.140
I mean, think about it.

31:13.140 --> 31:15.780
I mean, I, we don't even sound like the same people anymore.

31:15.780 --> 31:16.780
It's been so long.

31:16.780 --> 31:22.780
The only thing I haven't changed my mind on is one no needs to fix it.

31:22.780 --> 31:30.420
Okay, one of the seven things I haven't changed my mind, all right, the seven holy grails.

31:30.420 --> 31:34.980
JavaScript does not belong on the God damn server.

31:34.980 --> 31:38.100
I did it once and it cost me a fortune.

31:38.100 --> 31:39.100
Don't do it.

31:39.100 --> 31:40.820
It's a bad idea.

31:40.820 --> 31:45.460
If you need the money, understand that you're screwing over your employer and that's fine.

31:45.460 --> 31:48.900
Listen, if they're dumb enough to buy that and they deserve what they get, they're probably

31:48.900 --> 31:50.420
running Zeus on the server too.

31:50.420 --> 31:52.420
If they're that dumb, let's be honest.

31:52.420 --> 31:57.700
You want to go here, you want to, you want to do this fucker?

31:57.700 --> 31:59.140
I can't help it.

31:59.140 --> 32:00.140
You got me riled up.

32:00.140 --> 32:01.140
I can't help it.

32:01.140 --> 32:02.140
Now you got me all riled up.

32:02.140 --> 32:03.140
Oh yeah.

32:03.140 --> 32:04.680
They're so dumb cause they're running a stable operating system.

32:04.680 --> 32:08.660
Not like some like a boon to where canonical is like, Oh my God, we need money.

32:08.660 --> 32:09.660
We'll make a deal with anybody.

32:09.660 --> 32:12.700
The canonical has got to skirt up and slag out to anybody.

32:12.700 --> 32:14.460
All of a sudden they're best friends with Microsoft.

32:14.460 --> 32:16.780
At least I say that I'm a prostitute.

32:16.780 --> 32:18.820
He's a jackass.

32:18.820 --> 32:20.700
Even Barack can't save you this time.

32:20.700 --> 32:21.700
No.

32:21.700 --> 32:22.700
Yeah.

32:22.700 --> 32:23.700
As you were, as you were.

32:23.700 --> 32:24.700
I mean, so you're right.

32:24.700 --> 32:25.700
So should he quit?

32:25.700 --> 32:26.700
No, of course not.

32:26.700 --> 32:27.700
Take the money.

32:27.700 --> 32:29.660
What are you, a pie?

32:29.660 --> 32:36.340
Take the money, but tell them, like you should warn them that you're using deeply questionable

32:36.340 --> 32:40.020
language that is not meant for backend technologies.

32:40.020 --> 32:45.380
And if you're using node, that is a single threaded situation, which is exactly what

32:45.380 --> 32:49.460
you don't want for, I know somebody's going to send in, will these high activity websites?

32:49.460 --> 32:52.380
Yeah, I know, but it's a pain in the ass to get it to work.

32:52.380 --> 32:53.380
Also Mongo.

32:53.380 --> 32:54.380
Yes.

32:54.380 --> 33:00.340
Let's make our application faster by doing magical things that like kind of work, but

33:00.340 --> 33:03.980
you know, are dangerous and have some questionable ethics behind them.

33:03.980 --> 33:08.240
That's your another half life reference, or you could use a good database.

33:08.240 --> 33:12.660
The answer to your problem is Postgres and my SQL.

33:12.660 --> 33:19.180
If you are old, I'm like PHP, but Postgres it's just Postgres.

33:19.180 --> 33:22.900
Old classic, reliable, stable.

33:22.900 --> 33:25.340
I don't want to, I don't want to hear about Cassandra.

33:25.340 --> 33:27.180
I don't want to hear about Pollyanna.

33:27.180 --> 33:30.060
I don't want to hear about Susie Q. I don't want to hear about Mongo.

33:30.060 --> 33:32.060
No, some of those were made up.

33:32.060 --> 33:35.540
Don't bring, don't bring any of those up, especially the Susie Q one that gets me so

33:35.540 --> 33:36.540
fired up.

33:36.540 --> 33:42.220
Postgres in fact has some of the definitely questionable features that Mongo brought to

33:42.220 --> 33:46.740
the world because it was, they had to, they were forced, their hand was forced.

33:46.740 --> 33:47.740
What could they do?

33:47.740 --> 33:52.100
These jackasses in California decided why should we have data integrity?

33:52.100 --> 33:55.860
No, let's just pin our data to a table and give it a night or I'll never forget.

33:55.860 --> 33:58.100
That is a, I should attribute that extra normal.

33:58.100 --> 33:59.100
Great videos.

33:59.100 --> 34:01.740
And I agree with them, except on their Ruby thing, Ruby's great.

34:01.740 --> 34:03.740
They're just wrong.

34:03.740 --> 34:05.160
Everything about what you said is bad.

34:05.160 --> 34:08.020
So clearly he takes them for everything they're worth while looking for a new job.

34:08.020 --> 34:09.020
Is that what you're saying?

34:09.020 --> 34:10.620
I mean, cause they're, they're never going to be successful.

34:10.620 --> 34:12.940
So right, right.

34:12.940 --> 34:16.340
This is Karen Ebers questions to ask next time.

34:16.340 --> 34:18.300
And you tell me what you think of these.

34:18.300 --> 34:21.880
Number one, the number, this is what the, the person getting high, you know, when they,

34:21.880 --> 34:24.100
when they say, do you have any questions for us?

34:24.100 --> 34:25.580
Which is always like the hardest things.

34:25.580 --> 34:26.580
Like what the hell do you say?

34:26.580 --> 34:27.940
Here's what you say.

34:27.940 --> 34:30.700
You ask them, how did you start your last team meeting?

34:30.700 --> 34:34.460
Cause you're trying to get a sense for what kind of w yeah, what kind of place it is.

34:34.460 --> 34:35.460
All right.

34:35.460 --> 34:36.460
Here's another one.

34:36.460 --> 34:39.900
Number two, do you fully disconnect during the holidays and vacations?

34:39.900 --> 34:40.900
Hmm.

34:40.900 --> 34:42.220
I mean, everything is yes.

34:42.220 --> 34:43.220
They're never going to say yes.

34:43.220 --> 34:44.220
Yeah.

34:44.220 --> 34:45.220
Yeah.

34:45.220 --> 34:46.220
They're going to say yes.

34:46.220 --> 34:47.220
You might be able to get a read.

34:47.220 --> 34:50.420
Well, I see where she's going, but yeah, you might be able to get a read.

34:50.420 --> 34:55.020
Like, uh, I know one time I had a new boss come on the scene who was like an always connected,

34:55.020 --> 34:57.340
always online and then expected you to be online.

34:57.340 --> 35:01.380
And I wish I had known that because you know, I found out the hard way.

35:01.380 --> 35:02.380
Here's number three.

35:02.380 --> 35:05.920
I don't know if I love this one cause this also seems like they'd kind of dodge, but

35:05.920 --> 35:08.620
number three, describe a recent success or win.

35:08.620 --> 35:09.740
That's a question you're asking them.

35:09.740 --> 35:10.740
Okay.

35:10.740 --> 35:14.180
Could you, could you describe to me one of your team's recent successes or wins is the

35:14.180 --> 35:16.460
question you would supposedly ask?

35:16.460 --> 35:17.460
I don't know.

35:17.460 --> 35:21.980
I mean, cause the manager would feel they couldn't bash on a teammate, even if the teammate

35:21.980 --> 35:22.980
forked up.

35:22.980 --> 35:23.980
Right.

35:23.980 --> 35:24.980
But I like it.

35:24.980 --> 35:25.980
I kind of like it.

35:25.980 --> 35:28.940
But here's the problem when you're hiring.

35:28.940 --> 35:34.060
And if you're me, which that's a set of, that's almost like using note and Mongo at the same

35:34.060 --> 35:35.060
time.

35:35.060 --> 35:37.820
That's just a bad set of constraints.

35:37.820 --> 35:41.220
The thing I'm looking for an interview is this asshole going to suit me.

35:41.220 --> 35:43.900
So someone who's asking me these tough questions, I don't care how good you are.

35:43.900 --> 35:44.900
I don't want you.

35:44.900 --> 35:45.900
Yeah.

35:45.900 --> 35:46.900
You do it.

35:46.900 --> 35:48.940
You might be able to get away with telling me how you started your last team meeting,

35:48.940 --> 35:51.260
but it's actually such a, no, that's perfectly cool.

35:51.260 --> 35:54.700
I actually liked the question, but they like, tell me the last time you could see it, even

35:54.700 --> 35:55.700
that would be like, what?

35:55.700 --> 35:59.060
Oh, um, uh, no, really?

35:59.060 --> 36:00.060
What's wrong with that?

36:00.060 --> 36:02.100
Like I could say we talked about our weekend, right?

36:02.100 --> 36:03.780
Like that's what we usually do.

36:03.780 --> 36:06.620
We talked about, you know, we all have kids.

36:06.620 --> 36:08.220
It's just, it's just so unusual.

36:08.220 --> 36:09.220
Is it?

36:09.220 --> 36:14.140
I would say I have never been on the other side of the coin except for like down back

36:14.140 --> 36:16.780
in 19, 1874 when objective C was popular.

36:16.780 --> 36:17.780
Yes.

36:17.780 --> 36:18.780
Yes.

36:18.780 --> 36:19.780
Yeah.

36:19.780 --> 36:20.980
I would say we both agree.

36:20.980 --> 36:23.180
Try to ask the, tell me how you started your meeting one.

36:23.180 --> 36:24.780
What's the, what was the next question?

36:24.780 --> 36:25.780
Well they have a couple other ones.

36:25.780 --> 36:30.620
I just don't really like a lot like, uh, uh, tell me, tell me about a time a team member

36:30.620 --> 36:34.180
changed your mind or what's your ideal person for this role.

36:34.180 --> 36:38.140
I can tell you about a time I had a team member who sent a racially insensitive comments to

36:38.140 --> 36:42.460
a customer and he changed my mind about his employment.

36:42.460 --> 36:43.460
That's easy.

36:43.460 --> 36:44.460
Next.

36:44.460 --> 36:45.460
Next question.

36:45.460 --> 36:49.940
Who have you promoted and why promoted something cause they did a good job.

36:49.940 --> 36:52.140
And why is because they did a good job.

36:52.140 --> 36:54.780
So that's the, uh, yeah, that's a, yeah.

36:54.780 --> 36:55.780
Okay.

36:55.780 --> 36:56.780
And here's the last one.

36:56.780 --> 37:00.260
And again, these last few, I don't really think these are going to work, but I get where

37:00.260 --> 37:01.260
they're going.

37:01.260 --> 37:02.260
I get where Karen's going with this.

37:02.260 --> 37:04.300
My jerk off a white guy answers are going to be great.

37:04.300 --> 37:05.300
So let's go.

37:05.300 --> 37:07.540
How do you focus on your own growth and development?

37:07.540 --> 37:09.260
My growth is not your concern.

37:09.260 --> 37:10.260
Next.

37:10.260 --> 37:13.300
Well, that doesn't help us here.

37:13.300 --> 37:14.300
Does it?

37:14.300 --> 37:18.060
Uh, that, uh, yeah, that's probably what they would say, right?

37:18.060 --> 37:19.060
I'm the president of the company.

37:19.060 --> 37:20.060
That is my answer.

37:20.060 --> 37:21.060
Right?

37:21.060 --> 37:22.060
Yeah, that's true.

37:22.060 --> 37:23.360
I, I could kind of see that.

37:23.360 --> 37:27.440
There was one I left out, but I do now looking at the list, I see here's one last one.

37:27.440 --> 37:29.700
Tell me about a disagreement or conflict on the team.

37:29.700 --> 37:30.700
One time.

37:30.700 --> 37:31.700
Interesting.

37:31.700 --> 37:32.700
I actually liked this one.

37:32.700 --> 37:37.260
I, you know what I would have to pick if there's too many to count, but like we've changed

37:37.260 --> 37:38.260
it.

37:38.260 --> 37:42.340
In all our wars of hybrid mobile platforms, there's been many, it would take more time

37:42.340 --> 37:48.620
to think of a good answer to that, but definitely, um, yeah, particularly in terms of actually

37:48.620 --> 37:49.620
I would say job.

37:49.620 --> 37:50.620
I forget the hybrid stuff.

37:50.620 --> 37:51.620
JavaScript frameworks.

37:51.620 --> 37:55.900
In fact, we covered it on the show, the view versus angular fight versus react.

37:55.900 --> 37:58.560
It was mostly a few versus angular.

37:58.560 --> 37:59.560
That was brutal.

37:59.560 --> 38:03.620
That was like at some point that started getting weirdly personal.

38:03.620 --> 38:06.980
Like people started getting, taking, yeah, that's actually a good question.

38:06.980 --> 38:08.380
So I actually don't think these are all bad.

38:08.380 --> 38:10.520
I mean, would I actually answer them honestly?

38:10.520 --> 38:11.520
Of course not.

38:11.520 --> 38:12.760
But I don't know.

38:12.760 --> 38:16.260
You still might be able to get something out of the answers people give you to those.

38:16.260 --> 38:19.260
Well, what I would get out of someone who asked me this question is that I'm not going

38:19.260 --> 38:24.340
to hire them, but Hey, listen, if it makes you feel better, well, I was just, you know,

38:24.340 --> 38:28.460
I was trying to think of what to do for our, our poor tweeter who, uh, Henry who tweeted

38:28.460 --> 38:29.460
us.

38:29.460 --> 38:31.220
Henry, can I, can I give you some advice?

38:31.220 --> 38:36.060
If you're working for a small or looking to work at a small business, the thing that person

38:36.060 --> 38:39.300
is most afraid of is getting sued by his employees.

38:39.300 --> 38:43.260
And any employee that looks like a troublemaker is not going to get hired.

38:43.260 --> 38:45.260
Yeah, that's probably very true.

38:45.260 --> 38:46.260
Mm hmm.

38:46.260 --> 38:47.260
Yeah.

38:47.260 --> 38:48.260
I mean, Chris, come on, act me up.

38:48.260 --> 38:49.260
Right.

38:49.260 --> 38:51.300
Someone who, who like gives you attitude on the interview that you're not going to be

38:51.300 --> 38:52.300
impressed.

38:52.300 --> 38:56.100
You might be like, wow, they have skills, but also, I mean, you have a team of 17 lawyers,

38:56.100 --> 38:57.100
so you're like, whatever.

38:57.100 --> 39:02.060
Well, no, it's, it's, um, it's about, well, it's kind of along the same lines of picking

39:02.060 --> 39:05.540
a good lawyer is an extremely expensive decision and it's one you do.

39:05.540 --> 39:06.540
Right.

39:06.540 --> 39:08.220
Hiring a bad employee is the same thing.

39:08.220 --> 39:10.020
You weigh a lot of pros and cons when you do it.

39:10.020 --> 39:14.020
They're very expensive and they're necessary business things that you have to do, but it's

39:14.020 --> 39:20.140
a very expensive thing and it's not just cost of like wage, it's, it's equipment costs,

39:20.140 --> 39:22.540
it's training time, it's integration time.

39:22.540 --> 39:26.500
It's any mistakes that get made while that person's coming up to speed that have to be

39:26.500 --> 39:30.700
dealt with that affect the business in some way, which always happens, um, all that stuff

39:30.700 --> 39:32.460
factors into the cost.

39:32.460 --> 39:38.660
So I will tell you the worst I've only had two employees that I've ever fired.

39:38.660 --> 39:42.100
One actually did the thing I said, sent religiously insensitive things to someone.

39:42.100 --> 39:46.420
That's just like when I say insensitive, I mean like outright just bad.

39:46.420 --> 39:47.420
You're fired.

39:47.420 --> 39:48.420
Goodbye.

39:48.420 --> 39:50.120
Go fork yourself.

39:50.120 --> 39:53.580
The other one just couldn't admit that he made a mistake.

39:53.580 --> 39:56.820
Then he made the same mistake again and a cost.

39:56.820 --> 39:58.940
It wasn't like windows phone eight money.

39:58.940 --> 40:00.140
There you go, Chris.

40:00.140 --> 40:01.140
I gave it to you.

40:01.140 --> 40:07.620
Good old times, but it was, you know, it was certainly more than a bar tap.

40:07.620 --> 40:10.100
So and he was kind of a prima donna.

40:10.100 --> 40:12.240
I got to tell you, I don't hire prima donnas.

40:12.240 --> 40:15.580
So if somebody came to me, I like some of these questions, but if somebody came to me

40:15.580 --> 40:19.980
were a small company with these kinds of questions, some of them would have been okay, but like

40:19.980 --> 40:25.300
no, I'm sorry, but I don't care how well you did on the programming test.

40:25.300 --> 40:26.820
You're not getting a job cause you're, you know what?

40:26.820 --> 40:28.820
You're not going to meld with team.

40:28.820 --> 40:30.220
You're not going to be a team player.

40:30.220 --> 40:31.620
You know, it does work.

40:31.620 --> 40:36.260
And of course this sounds self-serving, but I hear this a lot from the audience is when

40:36.260 --> 40:42.460
the interviewee is asked, what do you do to, you know, train up and, and, and stay within

40:42.460 --> 40:43.460
it.

40:43.460 --> 40:48.820
When people say podcasts, I listened to podcasts, uh, it counts, you know, cause it, I think

40:48.820 --> 40:53.060
that shows that people are, but that's backfires because when they say they listen to stuff

40:53.060 --> 40:56.340
like Linux action news, yeah, well then they don't get the job.

40:56.340 --> 40:57.340
Yeah, obviously.

40:57.340 --> 40:59.540
Well, they get fired on the, I mean, they don't even get the job.

40:59.540 --> 41:03.060
I mean, now they get, they, they call the police, they escort them out the building.

41:03.060 --> 41:06.380
The worst in the like, oh, I listened to this great coding podcast called ATP and I just

41:06.380 --> 41:07.380
said, get the f**k out.

41:07.380 --> 41:11.700
Like it's just, and I sit there like I'm like a little dog waiting for a tree.

41:11.700 --> 41:15.140
Any, any other coding podcasts you listen to?

41:15.140 --> 41:19.580
I kind of put my Coderadio, you know, coaster, like I kind of push it forward.

41:19.580 --> 41:20.580
Any, any others?

41:20.580 --> 41:24.980
It's like, no, you know, but it does, it demonstrates that somebody has enough interest that they're

41:24.980 --> 41:26.900
going out and seeking out content and listening to it.

41:26.900 --> 41:30.380
And that's a good, I think that's a good data point for a hirer to say, oh, this person

41:30.380 --> 41:32.300
is actually interested.

41:32.300 --> 41:34.720
Not if it's ATP or developing with respect.

41:34.720 --> 41:36.960
Or yeah, let's be honest, our show, right?

41:36.960 --> 41:40.180
That's a bad sign.

41:40.180 --> 41:41.660
There's cursing in that podcast.

41:41.660 --> 41:47.820
Did the man who used to write Objective-C and had his life destroyed by Swift get upset?

41:47.820 --> 41:53.560
You know, Tim Cook emails me every week, Michael, the APIs are the same.

41:53.560 --> 41:58.700
If you would calm down and get off that goddamn Lenovo, just like open X, go to once, you

41:58.700 --> 41:59.700
would see it.

41:59.700 --> 42:03.020
Yeah, but then he leaves sent from my iPad in the signature and that's just so lazy.

42:03.020 --> 42:04.200
No, it's worse.

42:04.200 --> 42:06.940
He says sent from my Apple car and I'm like, Uncle Tim, is that true?

42:06.940 --> 42:08.660
And he's like, wink.

42:08.660 --> 42:14.100
Honestly, if I was a higher up Apple exec, I totally would change my signature to say

42:14.100 --> 42:15.580
sent from Apple car.

42:15.580 --> 42:16.900
I mean, why not?

42:16.900 --> 42:18.540
Have some fun with it.

42:18.540 --> 42:19.940
You know, just have some fun with it.

42:19.940 --> 42:22.980
We are way over, but WWC is coming.

42:22.980 --> 42:25.060
I just want to take an Apple tangent.

42:25.060 --> 42:26.340
OK, go ahead.

42:26.340 --> 42:31.540
As I said last week, I don't believe it's like physics wise viable to get the batteries

42:31.540 --> 42:36.460
that small to make functional AR glasses.

42:36.460 --> 42:41.260
But if they can, that is going to be an iPhone level of it.

42:41.260 --> 42:46.700
You know how you do it is by making the phone do all the CPU tasks and just it's a Bluetooth

42:46.700 --> 42:47.980
connection back to the.

42:47.980 --> 42:49.540
That's still it's still a lot, though.

42:49.540 --> 42:50.980
I thought about it when you said that last week.

42:50.980 --> 42:56.620
It's still I mean, think about it, just the visual rendering to have it not be crap.

42:56.620 --> 42:59.500
And remember, you don't want it to be crap because you'll damage people's eyes.

42:59.500 --> 43:03.180
Yeah, that's why I think you got to figure it's going to start as more like a headset.

43:03.180 --> 43:04.180
I don't know.

43:04.180 --> 43:08.300
I mean, but I've seen so I think we talked about last week Microsoft has a contract,

43:08.300 --> 43:12.140
the US Army for the HoloLens, and they do some manufacturing stuff.

43:12.140 --> 43:18.040
I have since been very impressive in our dotnet, joking aside about me selling my soul to Satan.

43:18.040 --> 43:22.740
The Microsoft AR stuff is super impressive, but they're Microsoft.

43:22.740 --> 43:27.720
They couldn't sell crack to a crack head in the consumer space.

43:27.720 --> 43:35.520
If Apple can somehow just like break into their labs, steal the HoloLens, make it less

43:35.520 --> 43:42.140
Blade Runner and go on, it would be maybe they do an app store model.

43:42.140 --> 43:43.940
They'd make the whole thing just to sell apps, dude.

43:43.940 --> 43:45.980
The whole thing at the end of the day just be to sell apps.

43:45.980 --> 43:50.340
Yeah, I love apps.

43:50.340 --> 43:52.100
I did well in the app store way back when.

43:52.100 --> 43:54.420
I got to tell you, the app store is a waste of time.

43:54.420 --> 43:55.740
But that's how they would do it.

43:55.740 --> 43:56.900
That's how they do glasses.

43:56.900 --> 43:59.100
You can't app store enterprise software.

43:59.100 --> 44:00.180
You just can't.

44:00.180 --> 44:01.380
I agree.

44:01.380 --> 44:04.420
They might do some sort of management distribution for that.

44:04.420 --> 44:06.260
Yeah, but they try to tie.

44:06.260 --> 44:11.480
Okay, there is a long conversation for next week about how Apple deals with developers

44:11.480 --> 44:18.140
deal with the enterprise.

44:18.140 --> 44:22.420
Analyze code level performance across your environment and troubleshoot issues faster

44:22.420 --> 44:23.900
with Datadog.

44:23.900 --> 44:27.740
Datadog has this continuous profiler that automatically collects profiles from your

44:27.740 --> 44:30.220
production servers all the time.

44:30.220 --> 44:37.180
So you can go back like a time wizard at any point and quickly analyze your data.

44:37.180 --> 44:41.780
Only instead of doing it with your hands like a wizard, you're doing it with the mouse and

44:41.780 --> 44:42.880
their dashboard.

44:42.880 --> 44:47.040
Get a unified picture of your environment by correlating code performance metrics with

44:47.040 --> 44:49.420
your other monitoring data in real time.

44:49.420 --> 44:51.220
I'm talking full stack.

44:51.220 --> 44:54.060
Log management also worked in there with that continuous profile.

44:54.060 --> 44:58.340
You can check application performance, server performance, site performance, get it across

44:58.340 --> 45:03.380
the whole picture of time and bring it all together with their beautiful live dashboards.

45:03.380 --> 45:09.220
You can pinpoint the cause of issues fast, communicate the problem, and identify future

45:09.220 --> 45:11.860
problems and make decisions as well.

45:11.860 --> 45:18.020
So go try Datadog's products for free for 14 days by visiting datadog.com slash coderradio.

45:18.020 --> 45:22.020
And for a limited time, if you start a free trial and create one dashboard, you'll get

45:22.020 --> 45:23.020
a free Datadog t-shirt.

45:23.020 --> 45:24.020
Yeah, that's right.

45:24.020 --> 45:25.020
I said swag.

45:25.020 --> 45:29.360
So you got to go to datadog.com slash coderradio.

45:29.360 --> 45:30.820
That does three things.

45:30.820 --> 45:33.060
You get that free 14-day trial.

45:33.060 --> 45:37.340
You get in there, you create a dashboard, you get a t-shirt, and you support the show.

45:37.340 --> 45:42.860
So that's datadog.com slash coderradio.

45:42.860 --> 45:47.100
So David writes in, I know you guys have been thinking and talking about the Epic versus

45:47.100 --> 45:50.860
Apple battle and its long-term ramifications for the developer market.

45:50.860 --> 45:54.900
I know that Epic isn't necessarily one of those companies that's fighting for good given

45:54.900 --> 45:56.300
their emails.

45:56.300 --> 46:03.340
However, do you think that Apple basing the iPad Pro now on the M1 changes things?

46:03.340 --> 46:08.100
When phones and tablets were introduced, they were not considered general computing devices.

46:08.100 --> 46:12.740
They had these low-end custom processors, and they were not expected by law or practice

46:12.740 --> 46:16.700
to offer any way to install software outside the App Store.

46:16.700 --> 46:24.920
But now, the iPad has an M1, which could technically make it a general computing device, no.

46:24.920 --> 46:29.700
And if that's true, that changes the implications for what that expectation is and may have

46:29.700 --> 46:32.300
ramifications for Epic's case.

46:32.300 --> 46:36.180
Perhaps Epic could argue that now that the iPad Pro has a desktop class processor, it

46:36.180 --> 46:42.280
is essentially a general computing device, yet runs the same iPad OS which locks it down.

46:42.280 --> 46:47.500
This would imply that the iPad should be considered a general computing device, and that the stranglehold

46:47.500 --> 46:51.860
that Apple has been installing and insisting on would have to be removed, and that it would

46:51.860 --> 46:54.900
have to be a fair marketplace model.

46:54.900 --> 46:58.060
And if it wasn't, it would be hurting the consumer.

46:58.060 --> 46:59.060
What do you think?

46:59.060 --> 47:00.060
I think you're insane.

47:00.060 --> 47:01.580
But David, I love you.

47:01.580 --> 47:03.940
I mean that, and keep listening, and do buy a rope.

47:03.940 --> 47:07.580
And if you've already bought a rope, send your emails to Chris because, I don't know,

47:07.580 --> 47:09.720
he's sewing them by hand.

47:09.720 --> 47:17.660
So we're expecting a lot from either a judge who's probably 96 years old, or the legislative

47:17.660 --> 47:23.340
branch who, I don't know if you've watched the news, but one of my, is it Senator Gates,

47:23.340 --> 47:24.760
Congressman Gates?

47:24.760 --> 47:27.260
He's pretty busy with underage hookers.

47:27.260 --> 47:28.260
Oh yeah.

47:28.260 --> 47:30.260
Good old Matt Gates.

47:30.260 --> 47:31.260
Good old Matt Gates.

47:31.260 --> 47:33.460
So listen to Unfilter, by the way.

47:33.460 --> 47:38.420
Chris can't plug it, but I can because I, frankly, I do whatever the fuck I want.

47:38.420 --> 47:46.520
So no, your argument, it's very well reasoned and just like simply wrong.

47:46.520 --> 47:49.820
Apple is going to do whatever they want to do until someone stops them.

47:49.820 --> 47:53.580
It makes no difference what chip is in the machine.

47:53.580 --> 47:54.580
That's my take.

47:54.580 --> 47:56.700
Actually, that seems to be Apple's take now.

47:56.700 --> 47:59.880
And this is something that Extreme Tech pointed out.

47:59.880 --> 48:03.020
It's a bit of a mind bender when you stop and think about it.

48:03.020 --> 48:09.020
Traditionally, every time you've bought a PC, since PCs existed, the entire pricing

48:09.020 --> 48:13.100
structure was predicated around the CPU model.

48:13.100 --> 48:16.920
You know, are you getting the i5 model or are you getting the i7 model?

48:16.920 --> 48:21.860
But now what Apple has done is if you want to buy a MacBook Air or a MacBook Pro, Apple

48:21.860 --> 48:23.760
will sell you one with an M1.

48:23.760 --> 48:25.980
If you want to buy a Mac Mini, you get an M1.

48:25.980 --> 48:29.860
If you want the iMac or the new iPad Pro, you get an M1.

48:29.860 --> 48:38.460
Apple is saying that the right CPU for a $700 computer and the right CPU for a $1,700 computer

48:38.460 --> 48:39.740
is the same chip.

48:39.740 --> 48:43.700
It's the right chip if you want maximum battery life and it's the right chip if you want optimal

48:43.700 --> 48:45.240
CPU performance.

48:45.240 --> 48:49.300
It's the same chip across the board, which is slightly different cooling differences

48:49.300 --> 48:51.580
that affect performance.

48:51.580 --> 48:53.820
But they're not basing the price on the CPU anymore.

48:53.820 --> 48:54.820
There are other differences.

48:54.820 --> 48:55.820
But yeah.

48:55.820 --> 48:56.820
Yeah.

48:56.820 --> 48:57.820
Well, yeah, that's what makes the price difference now.

48:57.820 --> 49:01.220
But now it's the same CPU and the same RAM across the board now.

49:01.220 --> 49:04.100
It's a kind of a big change in pricing.

49:04.100 --> 49:05.100
It's not.

49:05.100 --> 49:07.340
I'm going to fight you a little bit on the same RAM.

49:07.340 --> 49:08.700
And also, I wouldn't be shocked.

49:08.700 --> 49:11.220
I mean, OK, fine.

49:11.220 --> 49:13.700
I'm going to be an Apple fanboy for a second.

49:13.700 --> 49:17.660
The problem is the M1 is such a leap forward that Apple can get away with a bunch of nonsense

49:17.660 --> 49:18.660
right now.

49:18.660 --> 49:19.660
Yeah.

49:19.660 --> 49:22.980
It's going to be five years and we're going to see M1's, M2's, M3's.

49:22.980 --> 49:28.180
Well, I mean, give it till the next next M1 revision, like the M1X comes out.

49:28.180 --> 49:31.460
It's not going to seem like such a big deal that there's an M1 on the iPad when there's

49:31.460 --> 49:32.460
M1X's out there.

49:32.460 --> 49:35.740
No, it's it's it's not going to be the next revision.

49:35.740 --> 49:37.080
You're under your underestimate.

49:37.080 --> 49:38.300
It's going to be longer than that.

49:38.300 --> 49:39.300
Yeah, it's still going to look.

49:39.300 --> 49:40.300
Yeah, you're right.

49:40.300 --> 49:41.940
Yeah, it'll be years while it still looks really impressive.

49:41.940 --> 49:44.220
Right now, Apple has leaped forward.

49:44.220 --> 49:46.100
And this is a guy who's doing a bunch of Windows work.

49:46.100 --> 49:50.180
So and believe me, if it wasn't if it didn't make sense for me to be working in Windows

49:50.180 --> 49:53.860
with a heavy use of WSL, which we can talk, you can talk about today, but we'll talk I'll

49:53.860 --> 49:55.260
talk about next week.

49:55.260 --> 49:58.660
I would still be on the MacBook Air, which I'm on right now because for some reason,

49:58.660 --> 50:01.700
Windows couldn't figure out where the hell my microphone was.

50:01.700 --> 50:03.900
Or maybe I don't know how to use Windows, whatever.

50:03.900 --> 50:10.900
But the M1 is kind of a it's a what do you say it's a sun shower event, right?

50:10.900 --> 50:17.780
It's so much better than what came before that Apple is getting murder right now.

50:17.780 --> 50:20.700
But in a couple of years, we're going to see differentiation.

50:20.700 --> 50:22.180
It's not going to be one year.

50:22.180 --> 50:24.980
It's going to be I would I think five.

50:24.980 --> 50:25.980
Chris says three.

50:25.980 --> 50:26.980
And you know what?

50:26.980 --> 50:29.900
I think Chris didn't say three, but I think three is more fair.

50:29.900 --> 50:30.900
Chris is right.

50:30.900 --> 50:31.900
It's not five years.

50:31.900 --> 50:32.900
It's forever.

50:32.900 --> 50:33.900
Right.

50:33.900 --> 50:34.900
I mean, I'm on this MacBook Air.

50:34.900 --> 50:35.900
Let me tell you.

50:35.900 --> 50:36.900
There is no fan.

50:36.900 --> 50:37.900
I'm streaming.

50:37.900 --> 50:38.900
I have three browsers open.

50:38.900 --> 50:39.900
I have Slack open.

50:39.900 --> 50:45.940
I actually didn't even realize I I have Visual Studio Code open with a flask app running

50:45.940 --> 50:47.140
in the background.

50:47.140 --> 50:50.820
And then I have three terminals running Postgres.

50:50.820 --> 50:52.260
And there has been no degradation.

50:52.260 --> 50:53.260
Right.

50:53.260 --> 50:54.980
Like it's the M1 is just silly.

50:54.980 --> 50:55.980
Yeah.

50:55.980 --> 50:56.980
And they know it.

50:56.980 --> 50:58.740
Apple is getting all of the recognition.

50:58.740 --> 51:01.060
That's why they call it an M1 in the iPad Pro.

51:01.060 --> 51:03.300
They could have called it an A14X.

51:03.300 --> 51:04.940
They could have called it the A15.

51:04.940 --> 51:05.940
It's just branding.

51:05.940 --> 51:08.100
They're trying to tie it to the to the rifle, right?

51:08.100 --> 51:09.100
M1 Grand.

51:09.100 --> 51:10.100
No, I'm not.

51:10.100 --> 51:11.100
I'm not joking.

51:11.100 --> 51:12.100
I really think they are.

51:12.100 --> 51:13.100
No, no.

51:13.100 --> 51:15.540
I think they're trying to tie it to just all of the success and hype they're getting around

51:15.540 --> 51:16.540
the M1.

51:16.540 --> 51:19.620
They just want to ride that train so much so that they're willing now to just immediately

51:19.620 --> 51:25.540
blur the product naming line just to just to capitalize on the momentum of the successful

51:25.540 --> 51:26.540
branding.

51:26.540 --> 51:27.820
No, I think it's just it's the same chip.

51:27.820 --> 51:29.940
No, I I believe it.

51:29.940 --> 51:30.940
But I believe that if.

51:30.940 --> 51:35.220
Oh, but I'm saying the original name of the M1 in the MacBook Air was because I think

51:35.220 --> 51:36.220
because of the.

51:36.220 --> 51:37.220
I could be wrong.

51:37.220 --> 51:40.420
I could be wrong about this, but the M1 Springfield, the M1 Grand doesn't seem like Apple, but

51:40.420 --> 51:41.420
you might be right.

51:41.420 --> 51:42.420
Yeah.

51:42.420 --> 51:43.420
But Tim Cook would kill anybody for a buck.

51:43.420 --> 51:44.420
I mean, come on.

51:44.420 --> 51:45.420
That's true.

51:45.420 --> 51:46.980
Here's the question I'd love to have answered.

51:46.980 --> 51:52.740
Does the M1 in the iPad Pro have the same Intel extensions that the one in the Mac does

51:52.740 --> 51:58.460
to make Rosetta possible or is it actually running a different set of instructions?

51:58.460 --> 52:02.980
Is it truly the M1 SoC or is it essentially the same CPU?

52:02.980 --> 52:04.140
So they're just calling it that.

52:04.140 --> 52:08.020
It might not have all the Intel stuff on there because why would they for an iOS device?

52:08.020 --> 52:09.980
Even if it has the extensions, they wouldn't allow it.

52:09.980 --> 52:10.980
Oh, yeah.

52:10.980 --> 52:11.980
Yeah, they wouldn't let you use it.

52:11.980 --> 52:12.980
No, why?

52:12.980 --> 52:13.980
Of course.

52:13.980 --> 52:14.980
So what's the point?

52:14.980 --> 52:15.980
Why put the extensions in?

52:15.980 --> 52:16.980
So then it's not really, truly the M1.

52:16.980 --> 52:20.420
I'm going to take your argument even further since we're doing this extra long Coderator

52:20.420 --> 52:21.420
today.

52:21.420 --> 52:25.140
I think the M1 in the iPad is artificially crippled by their policies.

52:25.140 --> 52:26.420
Oh, well, of course.

52:26.420 --> 52:27.420
Yeah.

52:27.420 --> 52:28.420
Oh, for sure.

52:28.420 --> 52:32.220
If I could convince all of my customers that I just sold a bunch of crap to not crap, but

52:32.220 --> 52:37.940
you know, software to run MacBook Airs with the M1, I would literally not give a about

52:37.940 --> 52:38.940
anything.

52:38.940 --> 52:39.940
Right.

52:39.940 --> 52:41.700
I would just write software in the most sloppy way possible and it would work.

52:41.700 --> 52:43.500
I mean, yeah, they wouldn't know.

52:43.500 --> 52:44.500
They wouldn't know.

52:44.500 --> 52:45.500
They wouldn't know.

52:45.500 --> 52:46.500
And here's the thing.

52:46.500 --> 52:47.500
Here's the thing, too.

52:47.500 --> 52:51.140
You know, your your thing with that is the policies, the policies, the policies.

52:51.140 --> 52:55.460
And my thing with that is even once they fix the policies, the OS and the window management

52:55.460 --> 52:57.060
are still too weak.

52:57.060 --> 53:02.420
The policies, even with the the chips, those iPads have always been powerful.

53:02.420 --> 53:03.420
Oh, yeah.

53:03.420 --> 53:04.420
The first iPad Pro.

53:04.420 --> 53:05.420
Yeah.

53:05.420 --> 53:06.420
For years.

53:06.420 --> 53:08.340
I mean, this has been my hobby horse for how many years?

53:08.340 --> 53:14.200
The problem with the iPad is not the processing power or the graphical engine.

53:14.200 --> 53:16.220
It's that Apple will just say no.

53:16.220 --> 53:17.220
Absolutely.

53:17.220 --> 53:19.140
I mean, we don't want to go into bitter.

53:19.140 --> 53:20.140
I know.

53:20.140 --> 53:25.600
Here's my here's my last thing that drives me crazy is in the latest update to Big Sur.

53:25.600 --> 53:31.980
They now support dynamic mouse resizing of iOS applications that you run on M ones.

53:31.980 --> 53:37.980
So these these iOS applications that you run on the M one desktop can support resizing

53:37.980 --> 53:38.980
with your mouse.

53:38.980 --> 53:44.260
You can have multiple iOS windows and you can resize them independently on the Mac desktop.

53:44.260 --> 53:46.860
But you can't do it on a 13 inch iPad.

53:46.860 --> 53:47.860
What don't you understand?

53:47.860 --> 53:48.860
That's intentional.

53:48.860 --> 53:49.860
I know it is.

53:49.860 --> 53:51.880
And that's why it makes me so cranky.

53:51.880 --> 53:52.880
Fix that.

53:52.880 --> 53:54.480
Read my lips.

53:54.480 --> 53:59.140
They want to have a price differential between what they consider a, quote, computer and

53:59.140 --> 54:00.620
what they consider an appliance.

54:00.620 --> 54:04.740
But then don't call it the M one then, because the M one, it just it makes that expectation

54:04.740 --> 54:05.740
worse.

54:05.740 --> 54:08.680
Oh, because, you know, the next question is, why not just let me run Mac OS on the thing

54:08.680 --> 54:09.940
if it's got an M one in it?

54:09.940 --> 54:10.940
Right.

54:10.940 --> 54:13.220
You know, that's and they know they know that question's coming when they name it the M

54:13.220 --> 54:14.380
one Mac OS needs to go.

54:14.380 --> 54:18.780
In fact, I five years, there's no more Mac OS and they may call it Mac OS.

54:18.780 --> 54:19.780
But who spicy?

54:19.780 --> 54:23.540
Yeah, it'll be like some sort of Rosetta layer of Mac OS compatibility.

54:23.540 --> 54:25.260
No, it'll be.

54:25.260 --> 54:29.020
Oh, well, at least Fedora will still be around.

54:29.020 --> 54:32.380
Listen, I did spend a couple of days in Fedora.

54:32.380 --> 54:33.380
It was beautiful.

54:33.380 --> 54:36.060
It's too bad that I can't, you know, change your background.

54:36.060 --> 54:37.140
Yeah, I know.

54:37.140 --> 54:38.140
I didn't say it.

54:38.140 --> 54:39.140
You are.

54:39.140 --> 54:45.300
OK, so I went through the hassle and it truly is a hassle to install the latest Windows

54:45.300 --> 54:46.300
10 insider builds.

54:46.300 --> 54:47.300
Are you an insider?

54:47.300 --> 54:48.300
Oh, yeah.

54:48.300 --> 54:50.020
Oh, you're spicier than me.

54:50.020 --> 54:51.020
Go on, sir.

54:51.020 --> 54:53.500
Well, that's so that way I can get the latest and greatest WSL.

54:53.500 --> 54:54.900
And the spiciest diarrhea.

54:54.900 --> 54:57.040
Yeah, Microsoft has improved some things here.

54:57.040 --> 55:02.420
The fact that you can actually get a Windows insider ISO and you can download an ISO image

55:02.420 --> 55:08.700
from Microsoft, that is actually an improvement from the way things have been historically.

55:08.700 --> 55:10.980
So that was that, you know, every time now I know it's not new anymore.

55:10.980 --> 55:12.260
I know it's been like this for years.

55:12.260 --> 55:15.740
But every time I do it, because it's not very often, I still am like, wow, look at this.

55:15.740 --> 55:19.580
I'm downloading an ISO from I'm downloading an ISO of Windows and it's legal.

55:19.580 --> 55:21.960
It just feels great.

55:21.960 --> 55:26.420
So you install it and of course, I have the X1 Carbon Gen 8.

55:26.420 --> 55:31.220
And of course, the SSD control in there is too new for Windows 10 to have a built in

55:31.220 --> 55:32.220
driver.

55:32.220 --> 55:33.220
Of course.

55:33.220 --> 55:38.800
And of course, Intel only certifies their driver for specific released builds of Windows.

55:38.800 --> 55:41.400
So I had to go through this whole rigmarole to extract.

55:41.400 --> 55:43.700
And of course, one more, of course.

55:43.700 --> 55:48.440
Of course, the download for the Intel driver is a dot exe.

55:48.440 --> 55:53.820
So the only way I can extract it is by running the extractor in wine, getting the files that

55:53.820 --> 55:57.000
I need and then copy them over to a thumb drive.

55:57.000 --> 55:59.460
It's just like it feels like the 90s.

55:59.460 --> 56:00.800
It's really rough.

56:00.800 --> 56:04.940
But then you get in there and like my Intel video card was just automatically detected

56:04.940 --> 56:06.540
and everything just set up just fine.

56:06.540 --> 56:10.000
I didn't really have to hassle with a single frickin driver for the most part once Windows

56:10.000 --> 56:12.640
update did all of its things.

56:12.640 --> 56:16.100
And yeah, I could have installed more stuff for the Lenovo from the site.

56:16.100 --> 56:19.200
But I just thought, you know what, I'll just keep it basic.

56:19.200 --> 56:23.720
And I started using this new command line tool that Microsoft is working on for WSL.

56:23.720 --> 56:24.720
And it's just WSL.

56:24.720 --> 56:26.880
And it's a simple that you can find documentation on.

56:26.880 --> 56:27.880
It's really simple.

56:27.880 --> 56:30.740
And you can do things like WSL dash dash install.

56:30.740 --> 56:36.020
And the idea of this command is you go from a Windows 10 instance with no WSL subsystem

56:36.020 --> 56:38.520
at all to just a fully set up and working.

56:38.520 --> 56:39.920
But it's not totally done yet.

56:39.920 --> 56:43.020
So it like gave me an error message and didn't give me a complete install.

56:43.020 --> 56:46.420
So I still ended up kind of installing things the traditional way and kind of doing some

56:46.420 --> 56:49.680
of that work, like going and getting my Ubuntu installed manually with this was supposed

56:49.680 --> 56:50.680
to do for me automatically.

56:50.680 --> 56:53.280
And so that stuff was kind of rough.

56:53.280 --> 56:56.760
But the experience immediately improves now with the new Windows terminal.

56:56.760 --> 56:58.520
They've really nailed it there.

56:58.520 --> 57:02.640
And the fact that you can have each tab have a different WSL instance.

57:02.640 --> 57:07.640
So you can have, I had SUSE and Ubuntu and Kali in a tab.

57:07.640 --> 57:09.880
I'm sorry, which one did you have in a tab?

57:09.880 --> 57:12.120
SUSE, it's this distribution I just love.

57:12.120 --> 57:13.120
I use it everywhere.

57:13.120 --> 57:14.120
I should just try it out.

57:14.120 --> 57:16.840
Soundboard.

57:16.840 --> 57:23.980
And the reason I was doing this is now in the insider builds of Windows 10, WSL has

57:23.980 --> 57:26.960
added support for graphical Linux applications.

57:26.960 --> 57:28.920
Okay, but those don't exist.

57:28.920 --> 57:32.920
Well, you know, the classics, the classics that are made by the free hippies out there

57:32.920 --> 57:37.280
that you get on your Linux desktops that guys like me feel at home on.

57:37.280 --> 57:38.280
Oh, yes.

57:38.280 --> 57:39.280
Tux racer.

57:39.280 --> 57:40.280
Right.

57:40.280 --> 57:41.280
G edit, of course.

57:41.280 --> 57:42.280
G edit on there.

57:42.280 --> 57:44.320
Geary, which I think is great.

57:44.320 --> 57:46.440
Geary just had a big update, actually.

57:46.440 --> 57:48.840
Geary 40 just came out with a better layout.

57:48.840 --> 57:51.160
They made it better by ripping my code out, yes.

57:51.160 --> 57:57.280
Short version of this is what Microsoft has done here is short and sweet.

57:57.280 --> 57:58.280
It's amazing.

57:58.280 --> 57:59.520
That's my take on it.

57:59.520 --> 58:01.640
It's really incredible.

58:01.640 --> 58:06.080
Technically what they're doing is they're taking a distribution, CBL Mariner that they've

58:06.080 --> 58:09.920
created for Azure for their Kubernetes instances.

58:09.920 --> 58:13.760
They've taken that distribution as far as I understand it, and they have built on top

58:13.760 --> 58:20.040
of that PulseAudio, a bunch of like the GTK and Qt library stuff and a Wayland server

58:20.040 --> 58:23.680
as well as a free desktop, RDP.

58:23.680 --> 58:27.740
So what they do is they spin up a distro in real time.

58:27.740 --> 58:34.000
When you launch a graphical WSL application, they spin up this distro and then they use

58:34.000 --> 58:39.660
Western and Wayland to communicate directly with a local RDP instance.

58:39.660 --> 58:44.400
They've sent the code upstream to free RDP to support this stuff, so they've upstreamed

58:44.400 --> 58:46.360
the code work they've done.

58:46.360 --> 58:51.460
And it uses RDP to essentially tunnel the application's graphics back to the Windows

58:51.460 --> 58:55.920
host as it's right there on your Windows box like all the other native applications including

58:55.920 --> 58:58.800
a taskbar entry, the icon, everything.

58:58.800 --> 59:02.020
Even the drop shadow around the application is there.

59:02.020 --> 59:08.400
And they're using Wayland, which is ironic because it'll actually likely lead to application

59:08.400 --> 59:13.560
developers on the Linux desktop improving their Wayland support so that they're compatible

59:13.560 --> 59:17.840
with WSLG, which I just find ironic and juicy.

59:17.840 --> 59:20.360
But once you launch it, it's like it's a native application.

59:20.360 --> 59:24.120
It gets access to your local Windows file system if you want it to.

59:24.120 --> 59:26.360
And here's the best part, Mike.

59:26.360 --> 59:33.280
They have a library that's open source that scans the.desktop file of the Linux desktop

59:33.280 --> 59:40.000
apps, reads the path, the application icon, and then goes and creates all of the corresponding

59:40.000 --> 59:44.120
entries in the start menu for you for those Linux GUI apps.

59:44.120 --> 59:48.280
So for the user experience, it's go to the start menu, go to your programs menu or whatever

59:48.280 --> 59:52.960
it is now, and go to that icon and click it, and then it just does everything in the background

59:52.960 --> 59:56.760
and you just get an application up on your screen, all powered by WSLG.

59:56.760 --> 59:59.680
I mean, that's a great user experience, don't you think?

59:59.680 --> 01:00:01.000
I think it is.

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:04.720
And meanwhile, they have a really nice, competent terminal where I've got three or four different

01:00:04.720 --> 01:00:06.720
distros running simultaneously.

01:00:06.720 --> 01:00:15.160
Isn't it nice to have your Unix software and an operating system that can run 97% of the

01:00:15.160 --> 01:00:16.160
software in the world?

01:00:16.160 --> 01:00:20.080
Well, and you see a really sweet workflow that they're doing now where they have like

01:00:20.080 --> 01:00:25.400
VS code executing and building stuff in WSL and then displaying you the results on your

01:00:25.400 --> 01:00:26.400
Windows host.

01:00:26.400 --> 01:00:27.640
You mean what I was doing all day?

01:00:27.640 --> 01:00:29.200
Yeah, building Linux apps on Windows.

01:00:29.200 --> 01:00:30.400
It's crazy.

01:00:30.400 --> 01:00:33.680
It's almost like Windows is a super Linux distro.

01:00:33.680 --> 01:00:36.280
Who do we say the best Linux distro?

01:00:36.280 --> 01:00:39.080
Well, you know, I've been thinking about this.

01:00:39.080 --> 01:00:45.200
You get several Linux environments, you get Linux native Wayland applications, and you

01:00:45.200 --> 01:00:49.720
get the Adobe Suite compatibility, you get Steam and gaming compatibility, obviously,

01:00:49.720 --> 01:00:51.600
like there are a lot of perks to it.

01:00:51.600 --> 01:00:54.300
I do totally appreciate the value it brings.

01:00:54.300 --> 01:01:00.000
This one doesn't bother me as much as the M1 does because the Apple platform, that's

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:01.880
a totally different platform.

01:01:01.880 --> 01:01:05.920
But this is just more Windows users using Linux.

01:01:05.920 --> 01:01:06.920
No, it is.

01:01:06.920 --> 01:01:10.920
Because I'll tell you, man, I was happy to be done after my weekend.

01:01:10.920 --> 01:01:13.960
Windows is still Windows and it's arcane in a lot of ways.

01:01:13.960 --> 01:01:15.520
And I was like, okay, see you later.

01:01:15.520 --> 01:01:17.680
And I just walked away immediately.

01:01:17.680 --> 01:01:18.680
I was good.

01:01:18.680 --> 01:01:23.080
Will the senator from the great state of the Nile please yield his time?

01:01:23.080 --> 01:01:28.160
But I really think, I mean, even if it means, you know, in the big grand scheme of things,

01:01:28.160 --> 01:01:30.100
Linux's success is in the server space.

01:01:30.100 --> 01:01:31.220
That's where Linux is king.

01:01:31.220 --> 01:01:32.220
That's what I was going to say.

01:01:32.220 --> 01:01:33.220
Okay, fair enough.

01:01:33.220 --> 01:01:34.220
Yeah.

01:01:34.220 --> 01:01:36.100
I was going to talk about our friend Alan, right?

01:01:36.100 --> 01:01:40.500
You could be a open, and I know he's a BSD guy, but whatever.

01:01:40.500 --> 01:01:43.520
You could be a Linux guy and still work on the server.

01:01:43.520 --> 01:01:48.760
Actually, Jay LaCroix, he actually just wrote another edition of Mastering Ubuntu Server.

01:01:48.760 --> 01:01:49.760
Great guy.

01:01:49.760 --> 01:01:53.640
I met him at, oh my God, years ago at some System 76.

01:01:53.640 --> 01:01:55.000
Someone will tell me because I talked about it a bunch.

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:57.400
Oh yeah, like the super fan stuff or something like that.

01:01:57.400 --> 01:02:00.960
Yeah, we were, they made me dress up like a hobbit and somebody else was an elf.

01:02:00.960 --> 01:02:01.960
It was weird, but-

01:02:01.960 --> 01:02:04.120
Yeah, they made you, yeah.

01:02:04.120 --> 01:02:08.720
I totally wasn't like body checked in TSA dressed like a hobbit.

01:02:08.720 --> 01:02:10.440
And I said, unhand me you bloody orc.

01:02:10.440 --> 01:02:14.000
And he said, sir, are you, are you making, I said, no, no, it was a racial thing.

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:15.920
I'm sorry, officer.

01:02:15.920 --> 01:02:21.000
He made the point to me, and I didn't like it, but we had a private conversation where

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:22.000
he was trolling me.

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:24.200
So the trolling me part was fine.

01:02:24.200 --> 01:02:29.240
But I'm wasting my time buying powerful computers because all I'm doing is controlling powerful

01:02:29.240 --> 01:02:30.240
servers.

01:02:30.240 --> 01:02:31.240
Right?

01:02:31.240 --> 01:02:32.240
You just need a terminal.

01:02:32.240 --> 01:02:37.440
Whether that terminal is Windows Terminal, which I mean the Windows Terminal app, not

01:02:37.440 --> 01:02:38.440
the C prompt.

01:02:38.440 --> 01:02:39.440
Right?

01:02:39.440 --> 01:02:43.400
Mac Terminal, which is, you know, ghetto Z, well, let's say it's actually a good terminal

01:02:43.400 --> 01:02:44.400
now.

01:02:44.400 --> 01:02:45.400
Z shell.

01:02:45.400 --> 01:02:49.760
Or, I mean, if you like broken things, something on Linux, unless you're using POP, which

01:02:49.760 --> 01:02:50.760
is great.

01:02:50.760 --> 01:02:51.760
Wow.

01:02:51.760 --> 01:02:55.760
Although they should get rid of gnome as quickly as they can.

01:02:55.760 --> 01:02:56.760
It's fine.

01:02:56.760 --> 01:02:57.760
Right?

01:02:57.760 --> 01:02:58.760
Like you don't, you don't need a desktop.

01:02:58.760 --> 01:03:00.840
You don't need a tower unless you're Chris or you're me.

01:03:00.840 --> 01:03:01.840
In the broad strokes.

01:03:01.840 --> 01:03:05.040
I think you're 100% right, which is why it's funny.

01:03:05.040 --> 01:03:10.760
All of the little niddly fiddly, nuancey convenience features turns out to be what makes all the

01:03:10.760 --> 01:03:15.520
difference when in the broad strokes, what you need is a terminal and a web browser.

01:03:15.520 --> 01:03:20.280
And that I find to be ironic and I think is why we have been chewing on tooling so much

01:03:20.280 --> 01:03:25.380
again recently is because it turns out that when that's the reality, almost the little

01:03:25.380 --> 01:03:28.240
details matter more than the big details in that way.

01:03:28.240 --> 01:03:33.820
Because in broad strokes, you could virtualize Linux on a Mac, you could run WSL on Windows,

01:03:33.820 --> 01:03:37.200
or you could just run the Linux desktop because in broad strokes, you're probably going to

01:03:37.200 --> 01:03:40.960
at the end of the day, it's the stuff running on the server that's making the money.

01:03:40.960 --> 01:03:43.200
But then it comes down to, well, how does it wake up?

01:03:43.200 --> 01:03:45.200
How does the security system work?

01:03:45.200 --> 01:03:49.560
How does it protect the end user or small things like how does it work with a printer

01:03:49.560 --> 01:03:52.160
or a video camera or a mic interface?

01:03:52.160 --> 01:03:54.880
It turns out it hasn't worked in 40 years.

01:03:54.880 --> 01:03:58.240
That kind of stuff all of a sudden matters a lot more in that reality.

01:03:58.240 --> 01:04:03.960
I for myself was like, I just don't like the way you have to manage Windows.

01:04:03.960 --> 01:04:07.720
And I think it comes down to a part of just sort of the design philosophy of how Windows

01:04:07.720 --> 01:04:08.720
was created.

01:04:08.720 --> 01:04:11.560
I think it just doesn't really jive with the way I use computers.

01:04:11.560 --> 01:04:16.720
And so when my WSL experiment was done and I'd gotten what I wanted from the experience,

01:04:16.720 --> 01:04:21.840
I was like, OK, you know what, I feel good because I think it's maybe, yeah, maybe it

01:04:21.840 --> 01:04:23.280
keeps more people on Windows.

01:04:23.280 --> 01:04:27.160
But ultimately, I think if Windows bugs you, that's not going away.

01:04:27.160 --> 01:04:31.780
What it's more likely to do is give all of those dark matter developers out there that

01:04:31.780 --> 01:04:37.080
have been stuck on Windows because of corporate policy forever, they now have access to actually

01:04:37.080 --> 01:04:42.280
legitimate Linux tools, not some half baked implementation that's essentially reverse

01:04:42.280 --> 01:04:47.000
wine, but something that's really running the Linux kernel, gives you genuine environment

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:52.240
supported by the upstream distributions, and now, very soon, unless you're on the insider

01:04:52.240 --> 01:04:56.440
build, but now essentially will give you access to graphical applications.

01:04:56.440 --> 01:05:00.360
So if you're listening to like your favorite Linux podcast or development podcast and we

01:05:00.360 --> 01:05:04.360
happen to mention a Linux app, you don't have to be left out on that because you have access

01:05:04.360 --> 01:05:10.120
to Ubuntu's repos and SUSE's repos and ARCH's repos and Debian's repos and Fedora's repos

01:05:10.120 --> 01:05:11.640
all on Windows.

01:05:11.640 --> 01:05:15.320
So I kind of wonder if it isn't just going to make more Linux fans long term, but I guess

01:05:15.320 --> 01:05:16.720
we'll just wait and see.

01:05:16.720 --> 01:05:20.620
It may steal a few Linux users too, or it may just be a wash.

01:05:20.620 --> 01:05:25.560
But that M1 and that Mac platform, that's a different story because there, your best

01:05:25.560 --> 01:05:31.320
option is virtualizing the ARM version of Linux, which fundamentally reduces your application

01:05:31.320 --> 01:05:35.280
compatibility and tool compatibility and doesn't likely reflect what you're going to be running

01:05:35.280 --> 01:05:36.720
in production in the cloud.

01:05:36.720 --> 01:05:40.240
The biggest threat to desktop Linux is not the M1.

01:05:40.240 --> 01:05:44.720
The M1 is the biggest threat to life on Earth as we know it, because when it becomes sentient

01:05:44.720 --> 01:05:49.020
and decides that we've treated it badly by running our stupid electron apps, which were

01:05:49.020 --> 01:05:50.840
needlessly wasteful.

01:05:50.840 --> 01:05:54.760
That's what that ML part of the chip does.

01:05:54.760 --> 01:05:59.440
Every time you launch Slack or Teams, it's just like, you son of a bitch.

01:05:59.440 --> 01:06:04.120
The reality is that when the M3 comes out, it'll have like a whole bio, it'll have like

01:06:04.120 --> 01:06:08.520
a biological part of it that is just part human, part machine.

01:06:08.520 --> 01:06:10.860
There's no M4.

01:06:10.860 --> 01:06:12.760
It ended at the M3.

01:06:12.760 --> 01:06:18.120
Or at least we did and we don't know.

01:06:18.120 --> 01:06:22.660
Up until recording this show, I had a fantastic day on Windows.

01:06:22.660 --> 01:06:27.120
And honestly, I'm going to say it was my fault that the Windows thing broke because I denied

01:06:27.120 --> 01:06:29.560
access at first to the microphone.

01:06:29.560 --> 01:06:31.240
Chris is going to choke me in Slack later.

01:06:31.240 --> 01:06:32.520
Well, no, you're not.

01:06:32.520 --> 01:06:36.040
People do that all the time accidentally because they're always popping up asking you crap

01:06:36.040 --> 01:06:37.040
constantly about cookies.

01:06:37.040 --> 01:06:39.160
There is so much crap popping up.

01:06:39.160 --> 01:06:40.160
Yeah, yeah.

01:06:40.160 --> 01:06:41.160
No, guests do that all the time.

01:06:41.160 --> 01:06:42.800
And then it's a whole rigmarole to get out of it.

01:06:42.800 --> 01:06:45.720
And I restarted, but it wouldn't take it, it wouldn't pick up.

01:06:45.720 --> 01:06:54.940
Other than that issue, I had a wonderful 14-hour workday because today was a busy day working

01:06:54.940 --> 01:06:57.760
in Windows doing mostly Linux-y work.

01:06:57.760 --> 01:07:01.760
And soon even Linux-y graphical work if you want for some reason.

01:07:01.760 --> 01:07:02.760
Yes.

01:07:02.760 --> 01:07:05.460
And if I ever do that, it's time to have me locked up.

01:07:05.460 --> 01:07:07.760
It's called the Baker Act, time to do it.

01:07:07.760 --> 01:07:08.760
All right.

01:07:08.760 --> 01:07:11.280
Well, anything you want to plug before we get out of here this week?

01:07:11.280 --> 01:07:16.400
Yeah, I would like to plug you should hire me for Windows development work or server-side

01:07:16.400 --> 01:07:17.400
Python work.

01:07:17.400 --> 01:07:18.400
Right.

01:07:18.400 --> 01:07:19.880
I mean, now that he's got this Windows box, let's put it to use.

01:07:19.880 --> 01:07:21.440
Oh, I'm curious to know what you think about it.

01:07:21.440 --> 01:07:25.320
So do you know ish-ish how long you're going to have to wait to get it?

01:07:25.320 --> 01:07:26.320
Like a rough idea?

01:07:26.320 --> 01:07:28.280
I ordered it, paid for expedited shipping.

01:07:28.280 --> 01:07:33.480
They're like, oh, congratulations on your order five minutes later.

01:07:33.480 --> 01:07:35.400
We're experiencing unusual delays.

01:07:35.400 --> 01:07:36.400
We'll let you know.

01:07:36.400 --> 01:07:37.400
Yeah.

01:07:37.400 --> 01:07:39.600
Everything's super delayed right now.

01:07:39.600 --> 01:07:43.800
My think pad was, and that was a while ago, but everything during the pandemic has been.

01:07:43.800 --> 01:07:46.760
Well, when you do get it, I'll be curious to hear your thoughts on it.

01:07:46.760 --> 01:07:50.080
Also should probably mention a new Coderly is out.

01:07:50.080 --> 01:07:54.680
If you are a Coder QA member, Mike and I have the Coderly report out and available for download

01:07:54.680 --> 01:07:58.000
in the feed or in your members download area at CoderQA.co.

01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:00.920
And honestly, if you're not, do you need to buy that much food a month?

01:08:00.920 --> 01:08:01.920
Right.

01:08:01.920 --> 01:08:02.920
I mean, it's not even that much really.

01:08:02.920 --> 01:08:04.080
And you know, it helps this show go.

01:08:04.080 --> 01:08:06.080
You get the limited ad feed and that Coderly.

01:08:06.080 --> 01:08:07.200
It's worth it for the Coderly.

01:08:07.200 --> 01:08:10.080
The Coderly is a, you thought this was a therapy session.

01:08:10.080 --> 01:08:12.040
Me and Chris just, we hold each other.

01:08:12.040 --> 01:08:13.040
Yeah.

01:08:13.040 --> 01:08:15.600
Wes has to actually end the show for us because we're just like.

01:08:15.600 --> 01:08:18.560
Wes basically has to just take care of the whole thing, you know, and if it wasn't for

01:08:18.560 --> 01:08:22.320
Drew doing the introductions, I don't know, I don't know where we'd be with that.

01:08:22.320 --> 01:08:24.600
Turned out though, thanks to those guys, it turned out.

01:08:24.600 --> 01:08:26.120
Wait, Drew is real?

01:08:26.120 --> 01:08:30.240
That are a very sophisticated AI running on a prototype M2 chip.

01:08:30.240 --> 01:08:32.120
I thought Drew was an M1.5.

01:08:32.120 --> 01:08:35.720
He might be, I mean, have you heard those dulcet tones?

01:08:35.720 --> 01:08:36.720
Those can't be real.

01:08:36.720 --> 01:08:41.400
He scolded me for swearing not loud enough because it didn't pick up on the mic.

01:08:41.400 --> 01:08:44.000
And that's exactly the thinking of a machine.

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:47.720
Well, if you're going to beep, you know, you want to beep with the, with some, with some

01:08:47.720 --> 01:08:48.920
humor and you get to sort of.

01:08:48.920 --> 01:08:51.200
You're going to say that Intel is permanently f***ed.

01:08:51.200 --> 01:08:53.280
You need to say it with passion.

01:08:53.280 --> 01:08:54.280
Right.

01:08:54.280 --> 01:08:57.560
And you want, you want that F in that, in that beep, you know, you want part of the,

01:08:57.560 --> 01:08:58.560
you know, for the.

01:08:58.560 --> 01:09:01.800
It needs to be a hard F. It needs to be like all the way.

01:09:01.800 --> 01:09:06.560
You could find our sponsor, a cloud guru on social media, just slash a cloud guru, just

01:09:06.560 --> 01:09:07.560
about anywhere.

01:09:07.560 --> 01:09:11.000
That's like a website, you know, like YouTube or the Twitters or any of it.

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:12.000
Corn hub.

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:13.000
Probably not.

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:14.000
You could find Mike on Twitter.

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:15.000
He's at Dumanuco.

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:16.680
His company's at the Mad Botter Inc.

01:09:16.680 --> 01:09:17.920
I'm at Chris LAS.

01:09:17.920 --> 01:09:22.680
I think I don't really tweet much, but I do try to read my ads and reply, you know, like

01:09:22.680 --> 01:09:23.680
a gentleman.

01:09:23.680 --> 01:09:25.040
The network's at Jupiter signal.

01:09:25.040 --> 01:09:26.040
So that's there.

01:09:26.040 --> 01:09:27.280
If you want network news.

01:09:27.280 --> 01:09:28.280

Yeah.
